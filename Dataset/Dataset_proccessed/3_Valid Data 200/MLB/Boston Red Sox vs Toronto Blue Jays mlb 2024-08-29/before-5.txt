Toronto Blue Jays vs Boston Red Sox Prediction

I’m sticking with the Blue Jays. Francis is on a nice run right now. He’s 3-0 over his last three starts with just two earned in 22.0 innings. As for Crawford, he’s 1-2 in his last trio with nine earned runs in 15.2 innings of work.

On Wednesday the Blue Jays couldn’t solve Brayan Bello with just two hits in his 8.0 innings (and none from closer Kenley Jansen). I like Toronto to get the bats going better on Thursday.
