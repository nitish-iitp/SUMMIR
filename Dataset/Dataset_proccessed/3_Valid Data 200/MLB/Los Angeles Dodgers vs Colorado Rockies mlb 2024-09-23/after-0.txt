LOS ANGELES (Kyodo) -- Shohei Ohtani led off the bottom of the ninth inning with a tying home run before Mookie Betts' walk-off homer in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday.

Ohtani went 4-for-5 with an RBI and two stolen bases to push his season homer-steal totals to 53-55, while San Diego Padres right-hander Yu Darvish became the first Japanese pitcher to reach the 2,000-strikeout milestone.

At Dodger Stadium, the Rockies jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first and made it 4-0 in the third against Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who gave up five hits and walked three in three innings of work.

The Dodgers scored three runs in the seventh to pull within 5-4 before back-to-back ninth-inning home runs by Ohtani and Betts.

Ohtani also had three singles in the game, improving his batting average to .301.

The two-time unanimous American League MVP has gone 14-for-18 (.778) with five home runs, 13 RBIs and six steals since Sept. 19, the day he became Major League Baseball's first member of the 50-50 club.

In yet another feat, Ohtani scored two runs in the game to raise his season run total to 128, one more than the previous single-season high by a Japanese player -- set by Ichiro Suzuki in his major league debut season of 2001.

At Petco Park in San Diego, Darvish got a no-decision after allowing two runs in 6-1/3 innings in the Padres' 4-2 come-from-behind win over the Chicago White Sox.

The second-place Padres stayed three games behind the Dodgers in the National League West. The 38-year-old Darvish fanned nine to push his career strikeout total to 2,003.

"Just very grateful," Darvish said. "Many people, the Rangers, Dodgers, Cubs and Padres, have supported me. This is what I've achieved with all these people. I'd like to thank everyone."

At Wrigley Field, Chicago Cubs left-hander Shota Imanaga (15-3) won his sixth consecutive start, throwing seven shutout innings in a 5-0 victory over the Washington Nationals.
