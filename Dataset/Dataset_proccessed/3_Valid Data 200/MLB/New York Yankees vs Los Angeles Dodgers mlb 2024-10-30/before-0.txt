Yankees force Game 5

The New York Yankees aren’t finished just yet, and neither is this World Series.

Facing a potential sweep, the Yankees fell behind early but came back on Anthony Volpe’s grand slam then pulled away late to beat the Dodgers, 11-4, in Tuesday’s Game 4 at Yankee Stadium.

Before breaking the game open in the eighth inning, the Yankees had only five hits and the bottom of their lineup had driven in their first seven runs, but it worked. On a night when staying alive was the only thing that mattered, the Yankees finally got the big hit they needed, then managed to add on until the game was well out of reach.

Volpe, a homegrown shortstop from nearby Morristown, N.J., made a bad read while running the bases in the second inning. The mistake might have cost the Yankees a chance to tie the game, but redemption came an inning later on a first-pitch slider that Volpe hit 390 feet to left-center field. The grand slam put the Yankees in front 5-2, their first lead since the 10th inning of Game 1.

The Dodgers pulled within a run two innings later, but Yankees rookie Austin Wells — who had been stone cold at the plate — hit a solo homer in the sixth, and the Yankees piled on with five runs in the eighth. Aaron Judge finally got a hit, drove in a run, and went all night without a strikeout. Five Yankees relievers combined for five scoreless innings while allowing just one hit to a Dodgers lineup that, coming into the game, seemingly couldn’t be stopped.

Freddie Freeman’s fourth home run of the series — he’s hit one in every game — gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead in the first inning, but this time the Yankees fought back. Their bullpen made up for a so-so outing by rookie starter Luis Gil (four runs in four innings), Volpe and Wells combined to reach base six times, and No. 9 hitter Alex Verdugo drove in two runs.

The Yankees will turn to ace Gerrit Cole on Wednesday, and the Dodgers will counter with mid-season acquisition Jack Flaherty. It’s a Game 1 rematch that didn’t seem certain when the day started, but it turns out, this World Series has at least one more game to play.

Leiter Jr. on his long night

Getty Images

Yankees reliever Mark Leiter Jr. struck out Shohei Ohtani on a 3-2 splitter with one out in the seventh and a runner on second. The moment helped preserve a 6-4 lead before the Yankees broke open the game late.

And yet, it might not have been Leiter’s most impressive feat of the night.

Before he entered the game in the seventh, Leiter first warmed up in the second inning.

When a reporter asked Leiter about the challenge of coming in five innings after first warming up, he didn’t hide his emotions. He let out a deep breath and joked that he was glad a video camera had just departed the locker room scrum.

“That’s a tough one,” he said. “It really is. I think that’s a really hard thing to do in general. In the regular season, it’s a really difficult task to kind of be locked from the first pitch of the game on. But I do believe that the playoffs presents a different aspect where you kind of are expecting that a little more.

"Because every inning could be the leverage inning. Every moment could be the turning point in the game. It’s not as surprising in the playoffs. You see it all across the board.”

What to watch out for in Game 5 tomorrow

The big dogs are back.

It’s Gerrit Cole vs. Jack Flaherty, the World Series Game 1 starters, back for a second round in Game 5. The Yankees did what they needed to do Tuesday night, beating the Dodgers in a bullpen game to give Cole — the Californian now pitching for his childhood favorite team — another chance to take the ball in this World Series. Now he’s got to make it count. Cole, the 2023 AL Cy Young winner, has a 2.82 ERA in four starts this postseason.

Behind him, the Yankees bullpen has been taxed heavily over the past three games, as neither Carlos Rodón, Clarke Schmidt nor Luis Gil went longer than four innings. Reliever Clay Holmes has pitched in every game this series; Luke Weaver, Tim Hill, Jake Cousins and Mark Leiter Jr. have appeared in three of four games. A long start from Cole would be a relief, but manager Aaron Boone won’t have the cushion to give anyone, even his ace, a long leash.

Flaherty, another Californian now pitching for his childhood favorite team, pitched well in Game 1, throwing 5 1/3 innings of two-run ball. However, his overall numbers in these playoffs — a 6.10 ERA in four starts — are soured by a blowup start against the Mets in Game 5 of the NLCS. The Dodgers acquired the rental right-hander at the trade deadline to be their guy in big games this fall, so this is just the right spot for him — starting opposite Cole with a chance to close out the World Series.

Because Tuesday’s bullpen game went sideways so early, with Daniel Hudson serving up a grand slam in the third inning, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was able to give the rest of his “A” bullpen the night off. That’s a luxury the Yankees have not had. The Dodgers will have the more rested bullpen in Game 5.

'Let’s just win one'

Yankees closer Luke Weaver had three words to describe Tuesday's 11-4 victory.

"Pretty. Monumentally. Huge."

"It just feels good to feel what the win's like," he said. "It feels like the energy kind of re-surged."

Weaver noted a simple message from Yankees manager Aaron Boone before Tuesday's game.

"Let’s just win one."

Weaver offered a similarly simple outlook for the rest of the series.

"Why not?"

Anthony Volpe

It was a moment made for television: a Hall of Fame Yankees shortstop interviewing the newest homegrown Yankees shortstop who’d just hit a go-ahead grand slam in the World Series.

“You’ve got a lot of kids in the New York area,” Derek Jeter said to Volpe on the FOX postgame show, “that want to grow up and be you.”

Volpe grew up in New Jersey wanting to be Jeter, and in Game 4, Volpe had his Jeter moment. Volpe’s go-ahead grand slam in the third inning seemed to change everything for the Yankees. Finally playing with a lead, their bats came alive and their bullpen was unbeatable. (And just for good measure, Volpe added a double, a walk, three runs, and a terrific play in the field.)

“The win’s hit me,” Volpe said. “Nothing else has hit me yet.”

There will be plenty of time for the totality of this night to wash over him, because especially if the Yankees come back in this series, Volpe will be watching footage of his grand slam for the rest of his life.

“I was hustling,” Volpe said. “I didn’t know I got it, and then I blacked out right when it went out.”

Daniel Hudson

It was surprising to see Hudson come unglued. He’s been so steady out of the Dodgers bullpen. He just didn’t seem to have it in Game 4. After throwing six sliders to strike out Juan Soto leading off the third inning, Hudson, on consecutive first-pitch fastballs, drilled Aaron Judge and gave up a scorched single to Jazz Chisholm Jr. He got ahead of Giancarlo Stanton, then walked him. After Anthony Rizzo popped out, in stepped Anthony Volpe. Two outs. Bases juiced. Hudson’s first offering was a low-and-in slider that caught too much of the zone. Volpe smoked it, and the Dodgers suddenly were chasing from behind in a bullpen game.

Chisholm Jr.: 'We love making history'

Getty Images

Yankees third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. stood in front of his locker late on Tuesday after a Game 4 win, holding a stack of two big boxes. He looked like a man who stopped to do an interview in the middle of unpacking his kitchen. But he wanted to keep talking. It was here that he disclosed the Yankees’ new mantra, the only one they have as they still trail the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-1 in this World Series.

“Last night, we all said: ‘We love making history,’ ” Chisholm said. “So that’s what we’re trying to do right now.”

Chisholm was referencing a specific postgame discussion from Monday night, when the Yankees dropped Game 3 to go down 3-0 in the series. But actually, he said, it started back in Los Angeles after Game 2.

“We always talk about it,” he said. “We were down 2-0 and we still said, ‘Hey, this (expletive) ain’t gonna be easy, but this is what we’re made for. Who doesn’t want to make history? (Expletive). I know I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books and being a a part of it. So let’s do it.”

It probably doesn't need to be said: No team in World Series history has won series after trailing 3-0. And the Yankees are just the first such team to even force a Game 5 since Cincinnati in 1970 against the Baltimore Orioles. The Reds, it should be said, lost Game 5.

Pivotal moment No. 2: Boone turns to Weaver

Getty Images

Mark Leiter Jr. struck out Shohei Ohtani, but Yankees manager Aaron Boone made sure he didn’t get beat by Mookie Betts (or Freddie Freeman lurking behind him) without using the best pitcher at his disposal, closer Luke Weaver.

Bringing Weaver into the game in the seventh was early, but it was in the biggest spot — and unless something went wrong for the Yankees, it would be the last they’d see of Betts and Freeman on the night.

Weaver struck Betts out on five pitches, targeting him up in the strike zone.

A starter until last season, Weaver went back out for a second inning of work and retired Freeman, Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy in order.

The Yankees’ five-run eighth inning let Boone send out Tim Mayza for the ninth to take over for Weaver, leaving him at 21 pitches and available for Game 5 behind starter Gerrit Cole.

Pivotal moment No. 1: Volpe's grand slam

Getty Images

Deliverance came with one swing.

To set the scene: The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the first inning thanks to another Freddie Freeman homer. The Yankees answered with a run in the second inning, but a base-running blunder from Anthony Volpe may have cost them a chance to tie the game.

Now in the third, Anthony Rizzo had just popped out with the bases loaded. The Yankees squandering another opportunity felt like an inevitability. But on a night where they still struggled with runners in scoring position, Volpe provided the grand-slam salvation this team has been searching for.

The redemption for Volpe’s earlier mistake came on the first pitch from Daniel Hudson, a slider low and over the plate. He swung and crushed it 390 feet to left field. Like that, the Yankees went from down and out to up 5-2 in the third inning. The big swing was courtesy of the local kid who grew up in Morristown, N.J. and grew up to become the Yankees shortstop.

“I was hustling. I didn’t know I got it,” Volpe said on the Fox postgame show. “And then I blacked out right when it went out.”

Volpe finished 2-for-3 with a walk, two stolen bases and three runs scored. His grand slam turned the tide in favor of the Yankees for the first time since Freeman’s Game 1 walkoff.

Clay Holmes: ‘We know it’s not over yet’

The Yankees knew they needed a victory Tuesday to keep their season alive.

But in the moments after a 11-4 win in Game 4, reliever Clay Holmes said they also understood how a victory could tilt the outlook of the series. The biggest reason: They had ace Gerrit Cole ready to start Wednesday.

“In the back of our heads, we knew that,” Holmes said of the Cole factor. “As bad as a loss feels, two losses feel, three feel, we know what one win can feel like. I think we knew that. Just take care of today. We got Gerrit here tomorrow. Take care of tomorrow.

“And that momentum starts to build. We know it’s not over yet.”

Holmes recorded four outs on Tuesday while striking out two and not allowing a base runner. He helped the bullpen log five scoreless innings while allowing just one hit.

“Do or die, there’s not much cushion there,” Holmes said. “We were ready for it.”

Edman on fan interference: 'Unacceptable'

Tommy Edman's reaction to the fan interference play with Mookie Betts in the first inning: "That looked ridiculous from my perspective. The guy was trying to yank his glove off, pulling at his wrist, looked like he got ejected, and I’m glad he did. I’ve never seen anything like that. That was unacceptable."

Casparius on Betts fan-interference play: 'Never seen anything like that'

Dodgers starting pitcher Ben Casparius speaking after Game 4 about the Mookie Betts/fan-interference play: "Never seen anything like that. It was interesting, especially I think it being the second or third pitch or the game, an interesting start to the game for sure.

"Well one, I was happy it was an out. … I think it definitely was one of those moments like here we are, this is a big game. You know Mookie played for the Red Sox for a long time, he's played a lot of games at Yankee Stadium and I’m sure they’ve given him a hard time throughout his career. So it was one of those moments like here we are, let’s go."

Your views on World Series Game 4

Pat M: Probably too little too late but that’s more like it. Bare minimum at least we avoided the indignity of a sweep.

S.B.: That Volpe first player in WS history to have 4+ RBI & 2x steals stat was insane.

Nathan S.: Dodgers may be about to blow the series. They have found creative ways to lose in the playoffs and this could be another.

Danny H.: Game 5 here we come! Can Yanks make a series out of it, Cole will have a lot to say about it!

Stephen B: Yankees did a good job hitting against LA's JV pitching staff.

Don’t get cute with Aaron Judge 🤷

The Dodgers didn’t get cute, exactly. It’s not like it was Judge who beat them in Game 4. He singled, walked, was hit-by-pitch and reached on an error, so, it was an eventful night, but the pitching plan seemed to stay consistent. Judge saw a lot of spin. He fouled off a few pitches in his first at-bat and seemed more in control than in previous games. He drove in the game’s final run in the eighth inning on a Brent Honeywell slider over the heart of the plate. It was a proper slump-buster, but it’s not a matchup Judge would get in a close game.

Force Luis Gil to the fastball ✅

As I wrote on Slack in the fifth inning, Gil’s command made me want to punch a hole in the TV. He was not sharp. He only walked two over four innings, but he was constantly spraying. The Dodgers generally didn’t chase the slider. By the fourth inning, Gil was throwing almost exclusively fastballs and changeups. He gave up two homers and four runs. The Dodgers got to him. They just couldn’t get anything going against the Yankees bullpen.

End it ❌

For the first time since 1970, and only the fourth time ever, a World Series that was three games to none is headed to a Game 5. It’s Gerrit Cole vs. Jack Flaherty. Dodgers fans will be feeling significantly more heartburn Wednesday than they did tonight, but the series is still tilted heavily toward in their favor. As in, nobody has ever blown a 3-0 lead in the World Series. But that thought doesn’t feel so comforting right now, does it?

Betts not focused on fan interference

Mookie Betts on the fan-interference play: "It’s irrelevant, we lost."

On how his hand is feeling: "Perfectly fine."

On whether that was as aggressive as he's seen fans get: "It doesn’t matter. We lost, it’s irrelevant, I’m fine, he’s fine, everything’s cool. We lost the game, that’s what I’m kind of focused on, turn the page.

"Everything’s fine."

Get a lead ✅

This wasn’t looking good when Freddie Freeman homered (again) in the first inning, but Anthony Volpe’s third-inning grand slam gave the Yankees their first lead since the 10th inning of Game 1. And with that, they finally had an opportunity to play from a position of strength. Having finally gotten the big hit they’d been missing, the Yankees offense was awakened, and they made that lead too big to catch in the eighth.

Leverage Gerrit Cole ✅

The idea was, even without Cole pitching in this game, the Yankees had a chance to take advantage of his looming presence in Game 5, and manager Aaron Boone seemed prepared to do exactly that. Closer Luke Weaver seemed to be on track for a seven-out save before that big eighth inning made it unnecessary, and after Luis Gil got in trouble in the fifth, Boone went to high-leverage Tim Hill and Clay Holmes to get through that inning.

Make the rotation matter 🤷

We’ll see how much this matters going forward, because the Dodgers didn’t have to use any of their high-leverage pitchers in this game. They lost it, but Landon Knack going four innings — when the game was still relatively close — helped the Dodgers at least keep their bullpen rested for this Game 5 showdown against Gerrit Cole.

My final thoughts on Game 4

Yanks did what they had to do, but Dodgers have a lot of arms saved in the ’pen.

Gonna be a great game tomorrow. Can’t wait. Yanks are gonna need Cole to go deep in order to win, and the Dodgers have seen the Yanks bullpen too much. That’s a real thing in a seven-game series.
