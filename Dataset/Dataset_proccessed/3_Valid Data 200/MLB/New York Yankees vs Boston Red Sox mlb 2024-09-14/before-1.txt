Boston Red Sox vs New York Yankees Prediction 

New York has won two very close games to start this series and they are creating some space between themselves and the Orioles in the AL East. The Yankees are 41-32 at home this year, while the Red Sox are 39-34 on the road. Boston has struggled over the last couple of weeks and they could really use a solid start from Bello, who has picked up quite a few wins this season. New York is going with Gerrit Cole, who has been dominant in recent outings, and I am not going to pick against him here. Take the Yankees on the run line.
