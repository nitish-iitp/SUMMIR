Non-tendered by Rockies
The Rockies non-tendered Rodgers on Friday.
Impact Rodgers was one of the Rockies' more productive bats in 2024, slashing .267/.314/.407 with 54 RBI across 539 plate appearances. However, the team -- seemingly willing to give Aaron Schunk a look at second base -- will let Rodgers enter the open market after six seasons in Colorado.

Still out Sunday
Rodgers (hamstring) is not in Sunday's lineup against the Dodgers.
Impact Rodgers appeared off the bench in Saturday's game after being scratched from the lineup, but he'll remain out of the starting nine in the finale. Aaron Schunk will start at second base and bat eighth.

Hamstring issues return
Rodgers was scratched from the lineup ahead of Saturday's game versus the Dodgers due to left hamstring soreness.
Impact Rodgers missed two games earlier in the week due to left hamstring problems before returning to action Friday, and his injury will now cause him to sit down once again. Aaron Schunk will fill in as Colorado's second baseman and may be in line for another start Sunday if Rodgers is unable to play in the season finale.

Back in Colorado lineup
Rodgers (hamstring) will start at second base and bat sixth in Friday's game against the Dodgers.
Impact Rodgers missed each of the previous three contests with left hamstring tightness but has improved enough to give it a go in the series opener versus the Dodgers. After putting up a .936 OPS in August, Rodgers has cratered to a .496 OPS in September.

Out again Thursday
Rodgers (hamstring) remains out of the lineup for Thursday's game against the Cardinals.
Impact Rodgers has now missed three starts in a row with left hamstring tightness, though he had indicated previously he did not expect it to be a long-term absence. Aaron Schunk will get another start at second base in Thursday's series finale.

Nursing hamstring injury
Rodgers is out of the lineup for Wednesday's game against the Cardinals with a left hamstring injury, Patrick Lyons of JustBaseball.com reports.
Impact Rodgers missed a couple starts earlier this month with right hamstring tightness, but it's apparently an injury to his other hamstring that will keep him out of the lineup Wednesday for the second day in a row. For his part, Rodgers doesn't seem too concerned about the injury, as he said he would be available off the bench for an at-bat, if needed. Aaron Schunk will cover the keystone Wednesday in Rodgers' stead.

Pair of hits Sunday
Rodgers went 2-for-4 with a double, two RBI and a run scored in Sunday's loss to the Dodgers.
Impact Rodgers had three hard hit balls in play and had a double that would've been a home run in 11 ballparks. Rodgers last homered Aug. 30 and has just five RBI total this month while hitting just .183 with a 36.4 percent strikeout rate in 18 games.

Back in lineup
Rodgers (hamstring) is starting at second base and batting fifth for Monday's game against the Diamondbacks.
Impact Rodgers was not in the starting lineup for the Rockies' last two games due to right hamstring tightness, but he did pinch hit for Aaron Schunk in the seventh inning of Sunday's 6-2 loss to the Cubs. Rodgers has slashed .283/.325/.455 with seven home runs and 22 RBI over 200 plate appearances since the All-Star break.

Dealing with hamstring tightness
Rodgers is out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the Cubs due to hamstring tightness, Patrick Lyons of JustBaseball.com reports.
Impact The injury will cost Rodgers a second straight start, but the Rockies don't seem to believe he's at risk of landing on the 10-day injured list. In fact, Lyons relays that the second baseman could be back in the lineup as soon as Monday's game against the Diamondbacks. Over the final two weeks of the season, the Rockies will play nine of their 12 games at hitter-friendly Coors Field, making Rodgers a more appealing fantasy option than usual if he's able to shake off the hamstring injury.

Scratched Saturday
Rodgers was scratched from the lineup ahead of Saturday's game versus the Cubs.
Impact The Rockies have not yet provided a reason for removing Rodgers from the starting nine, but more information should come in the near future. In the meantime, Aaron Schunk will step in to start at second base while batting ninth.
