The Dodgers and Padres will play a winner-take-all Game 5 of their National League Division Series on Friday night at Dodger Stadium, with the winner hosting the Mets in the NLCS two days later. Let’s look at the first four games of this series, heading into Game 5.

It’s been evenly matched so far, which each team splitting the two games at their home park, winning a close affair in the first home game then losing a blowout in the second game.

Through four games of the NLDS, the Dodgers and Padres have two wins apiece. Each team has reached base 46 times via hit, walk, or hit by pitch. Los Angeles has scored 22 runs, and the Padres 21.

The road team has scored first and homered in the top of the first inning in all four games so far.

Wednesday night’s win at Petco Park in San Diego was the Dodgers’ first road playoff victory since Game 5 of the 2021 NLDS in San Francisco, snapping a seven-game postseason skid while wearing the road grays.

Longevity and positional versatility

Kiké Hernández got the start at third base in Game 4, and was 2-for-4, giving him eight different postseasons with the Dodgers in which he started a game, along with 2015-20 and 2023. That matched Justin Turner (2015-22) for the most such years in Dodgers franchise history.

Both Pee Wee Reese (1941-56) and Jim Gilliam (1953-66) started in seven different postseasons, which for those two were all World Series games.

With no more pitchers hitting, Dave Roberts doesn’t get to double-switch any more. Just give him this indulgence, okay?

Chris Taylor also now has seven different years starting a postseason game with the Dodgers (2017-22, 2024), as he started in centerfield in Game 4. He and Hernández actually swapped positions twice, with Hernández moving to the outfield in the third inning with Michael Kopech on the mound, then back to third base in the sixth with Evan Phillips pitching.

“A lot of running. I like the running in between innings from third way better than the one from center,” Hernández joked after the game, per Dodger Blue.

Taylor added one more switch in the ninth inning, when Andy Pages came in to spell Teoscar Hernández on defense and went to center field, with Taylor shifting to left field. Taylor is the only Dodger ever to play third base, center field, and left field in the same postseason game, and he’s done so twice, along with Game 4 of the 2021 NLCS.

In the regular season, Taylor is one of two Dodgers to pull off the 3B-CF-LF trifecta in a game, doing so on September 18, 2019 against the Rays. Tommy Davis is the other Dodger to pull this off, starting in left field at the Pirates on July 29, 1961 before later moving to center then third base.

More notes

Dodgers six-through-nine batters had just eight hits, all singles, in 39 at-bats (.205) during the first three games of the NLDS, with two runs scored and one RBI. In Game 4, that group was 5-for-16 (.313) with three RBI and three runs scored, Gavin Lux’s two-run home run in the seventh to cap the scoring.

The 8-0 win in Game 4 was the Dodgers’ most lopsided shutout win in postseason history, one run better than Game 5 of the 1965 World Series against the Twins. The Dodgers have 22 shutout wins in their postseason history.

The Dodgers are 10-6 in winner-take-all games in the postseason, including 5-3 during this current run of 12 playoff appearances in a row. They’ve won the last three such games — 2020 NLCS Game 7 over Atlanta, the 2021 wild card game over the Cardinals at home (Taylor, hello), and Game 5 of the 2021 NLDS in San Francisco.
