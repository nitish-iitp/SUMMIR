Baseball: Ohtani hits 44th home run as Dodgers outslug D-backs

 KYODO NEWS - Sep 1, 2024 - 14:33 | Sports, All

Shohei Ohtani hit his National League-leading 44th homer and drove in two runs in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 8-6 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday.

Tommy Edman broke a 6-6 tie with a two-run single in the top of the ninth inning as the Dodgers extended their NL West lead to six games by taking the first two of a four-game set against the second-place D-backs at Chase Field.

Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman hit consecutive homers for the Dodgers to lead off the game against Merrill Kelly.

It is the fifth time this season that the Japanese slugger has homered leading off the first inning.

In his next trip to the plate, Ohtani hit a game-tying sacrifice fly in the second inning after Arizona turned a 3-0 deficit into a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the first.

Ohtani finished the night 1-for-5 while his 98 RBIs tied him with Marcell Ozuna of the Atlanta Braves for the NL lead.

Last year, Ohtani claimed his first home run title by hitting 44 for the Los Angeles Angels. The two-way star hit a career-high 46 home runs in 2021, the year he won the first of his two American League MVP Awards.

Among other Japanese players in the majors, Houston Astros left-hander Yusei Kikuchi (7-9) picked up the win after striking out 12 in seven innings of one-run ball in a 5-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals.

Kikuchi is 3-0 with a 2.57 ERA in six starts since he was acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays in late July.
