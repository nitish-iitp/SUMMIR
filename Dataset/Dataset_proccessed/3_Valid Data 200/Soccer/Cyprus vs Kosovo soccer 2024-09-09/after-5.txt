Kosovo will face Cyprus on Monday

Cyprus will face Kosovo at the AEK Arena on Monday in another round of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign. The home side kicked off their Nations League campaign on a winning note and now sit second in Group 2 with three points from an obtainable three.

They picked up a narrow and hard-fought 1-0 victory over Lithuania at the Arvi Arena on Friday, with AIK striker Ioannis Pittas scoring the sole goal of the game late in the first half.

Kosovo, meanwhile, continued their slow start to life under German boss Franco Foda when they faced Romania in their tournament opener on Friday. They were beaten 3-0 by the Tricolours at the Fadil Vokrri Stadium and could have no real complaints about the result after managing just one shot on target throughout the match as they extended their winless and goalless streak against Romania.

Cyprus vs Kosovo Head-to-Head and Key Numbers
Monday's game will mark just the third meeting between Cyprus and Kosovo, with the visitors winning their previous two matchups.
The two teams last faced off in a Nations League clash back in September 2022 which the Dardanelles won 5-1.
The hosts have managed just two clean sheets in their last 17 games across all competitions.
Kosovo have failed to score any goals in four of their last five matches.
Cyprus were ranked 127th in the latest FIFA rankings and now sit 21 places behind their midweek opponents.
Cyprus vs Kosovo Prediction

Cyprus are on a run of back-to-back victories after winning just one of their previous 13 matches. They have, however, won just one of their last seven games on home soil and could struggle here.

Kosovo have lost their last three games on the bounce and have won just one of their last six matches. Despite their poor form, the visitors are the stronger side ahead of the midweek clash and should come out on top here.

Prediction: Cyprus 0-2 Kosovo

Cyprus vs Kosovo Betting Tips

Tip 1 - Result: Kosovo to win
