Burkina Faso kept their campaign to qualify for Afcon 2025 on track as they beat Burundi 2-0 in their qualifier at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Stadium on Sunday evening.

The result sees the Stallions retain top spot in Group L, putting them in pole position to qualify for the next edition of the continental showpiece next year.

Right from the onset, Burkina Faso put pressure on Burundi and grabbed the lead as soon as the fifth minute through Mohamed Konate who received an assist from Cedric Badolo.

The match was evenly balanced at times, but it was clear that the Stallions had the intention of scoring throughout.

Burundi managed to get their feet on the ball more in terms of possession as the match progressed, but could not find an equalising goal approaching the halftime break.

As the second half got under way, the Swallows tried to get back into the game and had a few set-piece opportunities with free-kicks, but could not capitalise.

In the closing stages of the match, Burkina Faso delivered the final blow in the fourth minute of stoppage time as Bertrand Traore got his name on the scoresheet, making the most of a corner.

The result sees Burundi remain third in the standings, still with only three points, delivering a blow to their chances of qualifying with Senegal four points ahead with a game in hand.
