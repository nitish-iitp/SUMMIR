Current Africa Cup of Nations Qualification standings for Comoros vs Gambia September 4, 2024

Both Comoros and Gambia are trying to go higher in the current group standings as they get ready to play each other in the Africa Cup of Nations Qualification on September 4, 2024. Their hopes of moving on in the tournament could be decided by the outcome of this match.

Comoros Results

Comoros has had a varied run in their last five matches, displaying moments of both strength and weakness.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
07.07.2024	COP	Comoros vs Mozambique	2-3	L
05.07.2024	COP	Comoros vs Angola	1-2	L
02.07.2024	COP	Comoros vs Zambia	1-0	W
30.06.2024	COP	Kenya vs Comoros	0-2	W
27.06.2024	COP	Comoros vs Zimbabwe	0-1	L

Comoros has struggled for consistency, with two wins and three losses in their last five matches. Their victories over Zambia and Kenya suggest they have the potential to compete strongly, particularly against mid-tier teams. However, their losses, especially the close match against Mozambique, indicate a need for improvement in maintaining leads and closing out games.

Gambia Results

Gambia has experienced a similarly inconsistent period in their last five matches, with a blend of wins and losses.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
11.06.2024	WC	Gabon vs Gambia	3-2	L
08.06.2024	WC	Gambia vs Seychelles	5-1	W
23.01.2024	ACN	Gambia vs Cameroon	2-3	L
19.01.2024	ACN	Guinea vs Gambia	1-0	L
15.01.2024	ACN	Senegal vs Gambia	3-0	L

The Gambia has also had inconsistent results recently, although they did win a high-scoring match against the Seychelles, scoring five goals. But they clearly have problems on defense, as seen by the six goals they gave up in their defeats to Senegal and Gabon. These outcomes suggest a club that can score goals but is weak on defense.

Comoros vs Gambia Head-to-Head

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
15.06.2023	AFCON Qual	Comoros vs Gambia	1-1
12.10.2021	AFCON Qual	Gambia vs Comoros	2-0
19.11.2019	WC Qual	Comoros vs Gambia	1-2
10.09.2018	AFCON Qual	Gambia vs Comoros	1-1
05.06.2017	AFCON Qual	Comoros vs Gambia	0-0
