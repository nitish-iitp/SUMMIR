Cameroon showed no mercy against Kenya as they beat the Harambee Stars 4-1 at the Japoma Stadium in Douala, Cameroon, in their 2025 AFCON qualifier on Friday evening.

The result sees Cameroon remain top of the Group J standings with seven points after three games, two points ahead of second-placed Zimbabwe.

The Indomitable Lions showed resilience and the drive to score from the very beginning and were rewarded early when a challenge in the box led to them being awarded a penalty.

Vincent Aboubaker opened the scoring as he converted the spot kick in the eighth minute. 

Martin Hongla doubled their lead in the 39th minute and it seemed as though it would be one-way traffic.

Kenya managed to pull a goal back through Michael Olunga in the 41st minute, reducing the lead and causing Cameroon a bit of tension as the first half drew to a close.

Bryan Mbuemo restored their two goal cushion in the dying minutes of the half to take a 3-1 lead, leaving the Harambee Stars with loads of work to do.

Cameroon continued to punish the visitors as Christian Bassogog put them three goals ahead in the 55th minute, scoring the final goal of the encounter.

Changes were made by Kenya coach Engin Firat, but they were unfortunately unable to recover, and the match ended 4-1, with the home team grabbing all three points after an entertaining evening of football in Douala.
