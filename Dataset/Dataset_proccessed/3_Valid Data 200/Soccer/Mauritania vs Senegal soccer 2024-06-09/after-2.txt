Key Chelsea player already injured on international duty confirms Official federation
Originally posted on Chelsea News  |  By Simon Phillips  |  Last updated Jun 9, 2024 9:53 AM ET

Chelsea’s biggest nightmare during this summer has become reality already, with a key player being injured on international duty before any of the major competitions have even started.

The Euros begin this weekend, and there are other competitions on this summer as well including the Copa America. Chelsea have a lot of players out representing their countries, and they would have been hoping to avoid any serious injuries to their players after the high amounts of injuries they have had in the squad recently.

Unfortunately, Nicolas Jackson has already picked up a ‘serious’ injury, and that is according to the Senegalese football federation themselves.

They posted on their official X account late last night that Jackson has picked up an injury. Their statement reads:

‘Jackson injured his right ankle during the Senegal-DRC match on June 6, 2024. Radiology examinations (MRI) carried out on June 7 revealed a serious sprain of the ankle. He will therefore be unavailable for the Mauritania – Senegal match on June 9, 2024.’

Serious ankle sprain

That does not sound good at all, even if they have only confirmed that Jackson will miss one game.

It is almost definitely going to be a lot longer out for Jackson though.

According to Bupa UK, sprained ankle recovery time will depend on how bad your sprain is. The most common sprains affect the ligaments on the outside of your ankle (lateral ankle sprains). The average time it takes people to return to sport after a lateral ankle sprain is 16 to 24 days. But it can vary a lot between people.

Mild-to-moderate sprains should heal enough to walk on within a few weeks. But it may take up to two or three months to get back to normal and play sports. If you have a very bad ankle sprain, it may take several months to recover, especially if you need surgery. There’s a risk of injuring your ankle again, especially in the first four to six weeks.

Marcus Rashford is poised to enter the New Year having been completely frozen out of the Manchester United first-team. Indeed, Ruben Amorim is laying down the law at Old Trafford, whether it makes him a popular figure or not. His decision to omit the boyhood Red for four successive games has continuously raised the eyebrows of supporters. Initially, he was dropped for the Manchester derby along with Alejandro Garnacho due to their performances in training, although the latter has since returned to the fold and featured in the last three matches – albeit off the bench. That hasn’t been the case for Rashford, however. Whatever Amorim is seeing from him at Carrington has left him far from satisfied, and questions will only continue to be raised over the player’s off-pitch antics the longer his absences go on. Has Rashford played his final game in a United shirt? The situation came so out of the blue that fans began speculating whether there was more going on than what meets the eye. For example, some supporters contemplated whether INEOS had instructed Amorim to force the 27-year-old out in hopes of sanctioning the exit of one of their highest earners in January. Rashford takes home £325,000 a week in M16 and has done so since he put pen to paper on a lucrative new deal in 2023. Since then, you’d struggle to pick out even a handful of performances that could justify such a wage. He is contracted to the club until 2028, and at this rate, there are doubts as to whether he’ll even be a United player by the end of the campaign. Reputable Red Devils journalist Andy Mitten shared a damning verdict on the England international when speaking with talkSPORT, and it’s certainly justified some of Amorim’s methods behind the madness. “Every previous manager has had issues with Marcus Rashford,” Mitten revealed. “I’ve spoken to them. They’ve told me in confidence going back years and years and years.”

LeBron James assumed 50-year-old Michael Jordan thinks he could…

As a huge Michael Jordan fan, LeBron James has always been well aware of the pride the six-time NBA champion holds in being recognized as arguably the greatest player of all time. Even though they rarely engage in conversation, Bron assumed that among the things MJ is possibly thinking about whenever his name is mentioned is beating him in a 1-on-1 game. Knowing Jordan's unwavering confidence, sometimes borderline arrogance, "The King" was quite certain about his speculation. "He probably thinks he can beat me 1-on-1 right now [laughing]," the four-time MVP said in an interview with ESPN's Chris Broussard in 2013. "I know he probably thinks that. I know MJ definitely thinks he can beat me 1-on-1 right now." LeBron was right about reading MJ's mind LeBron might've been right about Jordan's take regarding a hypothetical one-on-one game between them. After all, in a famous interview just a year later, "His Airness" addressed the subject in an unfiltered and candid manner, saying only Kobe Bryant could beat him in a game of 1-on-1. "If I was in my prime, who would I wanna play 1-on-1? That list is very long. Start off with Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant in his prime, LeBron in his prime, Wade in his prime, Melo. That's a good start. And I don't think I would lose, other than to Kobe Bryant because he steals all of my moves," the six-time NBA champion once said. The MJ vs. LeBron GOAT debate Unfortunately, basketball fans never had the opportunity to witness a face-off between Bron and Jordan. Nevertheless, this has not diminished the fervor of discussions among fans. In fact, it has only intensified the ongoing debate regarding who deserves to be called the rightful NBA GOAT. To this day, fans, analysts, former NBA players, and even some celebrities engage in spirited MJ vs. LeBron debates, presenting statistics, anecdotes, and personal opinions to support their stance. This serves as a testament to Jordan and James' immense impact on the game and the culture of basketball. As long as basketball exists, the discussions about who truly reigns supreme will likely endure. And even though the two have yet to develop a deeper relationship like some of the other NBA legends—including MJ and Kobe—their NBA legacies will forever be intertwined.

Raiders rumored to trade Maxx Crosby to Super Bowl contender

The Las Vegas Raiders are almost finished with another lost season, but the off-season will provide plenty of questions to answer. The Raiders are 3-12 after defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 16, and they will be hoping to win consecutive games for the first time this season against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. While the season as a whole has been disappointing, few have felt the frustration as much as superstar pass rusher Maxx Crosby. Crosby, who underwent season-ending ankle surgery before Week 15 against the Atlanta Falcons, has been the centerpiece of the Raiders defense for a considerable amount of time. However, after venting about his frustrations with the team on his podcast, some have taken it as a sign that Crosby wants out. Teams in need of a pass rusher will reach out to the Raiders to see what they can get, and one of those teams who would reach out is the Buffalo Bills. “With Von Miller aging, trading for Crosby would give (Buffalo Bills defensive end Greg) Rousseau a viable pass rusher to help on the other side,” said The Wright Way Network’s Marissa Myers. “With the Bills being contenders as well, Crosby would enter a better winning culture and prolong the Bills Super Bowl window.” The Bills have been one of the highest-flying teams in the NFL this season, lead by quarterback and MVP candidate Josh Allen. While the offense has continued to click, the defense has struggled at points due to injuries and inconsistent performance. Bringing in Crosby would give the Bills a staunch defensive line with Rousseau and defensive tackle Ed Oliver. If the move pans out, the Bills would generate enough pressure on offenses to make up for any deficiencies in their own back end. That being said, there is no guarantee this will come to pass. First of all, Crosby has not indicated he is anywhere close to requesting a trade, as well as explicitly mentioning he will have conversations with the Raiders’ front office. Secondly, the price to acquire Crosby would be steep for any team, much less one in the Raiders’ own conference. Any package coming back would have to include a first-round pick and a promising young player, at the very least. Crosby’s comments may be getting blown out of proportion a bit, but it appears the trade rumors are returning once again.

Joel Klatt Names Two Best Teams in College Football

The second round of the 2024 College Football Playoff is set to begin in just a few days. College football fans are eager for this round to be more exciting, especially after the first round featured no games won by single digits. A highly anticipated game this weekend features a rematch between the No. 1 Oregon Ducks (13-0) and the No. 8 Ohio State Buckeyes (11-2). The Ducks narrowly won in their previous encounter, 32-31 at home. The Buckeyes hope to avenge that regular season loss and advance in the playoff. Fox Sports' Joel Klatt appeared on "The Ryen Russillo Podcast," discussing this upcoming game. Klatt said he thinks it could be among the best two teams in the sport. "In a lot of our minds, a good chance that these are the two best teams in the sport," Klatt said. "That these are the two best teams in college football." The regular season matchup was close, with Oregon outgaining Ohio State 496-467. However, the Buckeyes suffered setbacks due to mistakes, incurring five additional penalties totaling 45 yards more and committing two turnovers. Nevertheless, Ohio State is likely to look for similar aerial success. Quarterback Will Howard had an impressive performance, completing 80% of his passes for 326 yards and two touchdowns, marking both a season-high and just one yard shy of his career best. The Ducks, too, will aim for success in the passing game, as quarterback Dillon Gabriel threw for 341 yards and two touchdowns with a completion rate of 68%. The quarterback who performs better on New Year's Day at 5:00 p.m. ET on ESPN may decide which team advances to the semifinals.
