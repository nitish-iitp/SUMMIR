Argentina player ratings vs Colombia: Enzo Fernandez falters as Lionel Messi-less Albiceleste lose Copa America final rematch to James Rodriguez-inspired Cafeteros

Colombia vs Argentina

Lionel Scaloni's side were ineffective without their main man in a disappointing loss in World Cup qualifying

No Lionel Messi, no fun. Argentina looked short of ideas going forward without their star man, and surprisingly frail at the back at times as they were thoroughly outplayed by Colombia in a deserved 2-1 away defeat in World Cup qualiifying.

Messi, still absent with the high ankle sprain he suffered in the Copa America final the last time these two sides met, might have made the difference here. But when others were asked to pick up the slack, Argentina went quiet.

The home side were good value for their opener in the first half, which came via a well-worked corner routine. James Rodriguez floated a cross to the far post, and Yerson Mosquera dutifully nodded home after La Albiceleste fell asleep.

Lionel Scaloni's men offered a response after the break, though, as Nico Gonzalez darted beyond the Colombia defence before finishing through the keeper's legs to level proceedings.

The home side grabbed a deserved second, however - albeit in dubious circumstances. Daniel Munoz was adjudged to have been fouled by Enzo Fernandez in the box - a decision given after a lengthy VAR check. James, excellent on the night, smashed home the resulting penalty, despite the usual gamesmanship from Emi Martinez.

And Colombia were relatively comfortable for the rest of the contest, as although Argentina offered some interesting attacking ideas, they seldom threatened the home side's goal. By the end of it all, Scaloni could only watch as his team were convincingly beaten.

GOAL rates Argentina's players from Estadio Metropolitano...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Emi Martinez (5/10):

Helpless to stop the opener. His usual sh*thousery didn't work on James' penalty, either.

Gonzalo Montiel (5/10):

Removed at half-time after a poor first half in which he picked up a silly yellow and didn't do much else.

Cristian Romero (5/10):

Not the most comfortable showing for the Tottenham man. Spent a lot of time struggling to contain first Luis Diaz, then Duran.

Nicolas Otamendi (6/10):

Probaby the better of the two centre-backs on the night, winning his tackles and staying reasonably solid.

Lisandro Martinez (6/10):

His side of the pitch was a bit more secure. Missed a good chance at the end of the first half. Clearly more comfortable in the middle rather than as a makeshift left-back.

Midfield

Rodrigo De Paul (6/10):

Up for the fight, but wasn't good enough when he got the ball. Dragged into some unnecessary stuff with Diaz.

Enzo Fernandez (4/10):

A truly forgettable showing. Completed very few of his passes, and didn't have much of an impact on play in midfield. Also conceded the match-winning penalty.

Leandro Paredes (6/10):

Completed 100% of his passes without really having an influence on the game. Argentina are more effective with Mac Allister in his role.

Nico Gonzalez (6/10):

More or less anonymous until he scored a memorable equaliser.

Attack

Lautaro Martinez (4/10):

Back to his usual national team disappearing act after a star showing at Copa America

Julian Alvarez (5/10):

Failed to put a shot on target, and struggled to get on the same wavelength as Martinez.

Subs & Manager

Nahuel Molina (5/10):

A bit more effective than Montiel at full-back after being introduced at half-time.

Marcos Acuna (6/10):

Agreeably scrappy, and tidy with the ball.

Alexis Mac Allister (7/10):

Injury prevented him from starting, and Argentina were much better when he was on the pitch.

Giovani Lo Celso (N/A):

Hardly touched the ball.

Paulo Dybala (N/A):

No time to make an impact

Lionel Scaloni (6/10):

Went for a similar XI to the one that won Copa America for him a few months ago, and, just like then, Argentina were mostly outplayed. His side turned it on late, but didn't really deserve a result. Disappointing, but not catastrophic.
