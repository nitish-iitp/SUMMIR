Ángel Di María commented on Argentina’s 1-0 win vs. Ecuador.

Di María scored the only goal of the match for Argentina in their win. Speaking to the media after the match, here is what he had to say about his goal:

“I never thought that Cuti (Cristian Romero) was going to give it to me because the pass he made was terrific. It was a deserved win.”

In regards to the team and the Copa America:

“We have to continue working as always and stay as united as we are.

“Ecuador is an opponent that we can meet at the Copa America. We know that it is going to be more than a complicated tournament. Today was a good match to show how we are.

“The important thing is that we are well and with the hope of achieving more goals.”

Argentina will play Guatemala on Friday.
