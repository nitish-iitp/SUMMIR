CROATIA 2-2 ALBANIA - KLAUS GJASULA SCORES DRAMATIC LATE EQUALISER AFTER OWN-GOAL TO SNATCH DRAW AGAINST CROATIA
BYPAUL HASSALL

UPDATED 19/06/2024 AT 17:48 GMT

Klaus Gjasula went through the gamut of emotions on Wednesday. His own-goal – just two minutes after an equaliser from Andrej Kramaric – saw Croatia go 2-1 up against Albania after they were on course for a famous one. But Gjasula wrote the final part of the script in dramatic fashion, popping up late into added time to sweep home an equaliser that gave Albania their first point of Euro 2024.

Klaus Gjasula followed up an own goal with a stoppage-time equaliser as Albania stunned Croatia to secure a 2-2 draw following a breathless Group B encounter in Hamburg.
Sylvinho’s Red and Black minnows struck the fastest goal in Euros history in their opener against Italy and they made another rapid start here as Qazim Laci squeezed a header home on 11 minutes.

Albania were perhaps guilty of being too passive in the remainder of their defeat to The Azzurri, but that wasn’t the case on this occasion as Kristjan Asllani and Rey Manaj both missed good opportunities to double the underdog’s tally.

Croatia were shaky at the back and pedestrian in possession but that all changed in the second half as they laid siege to the Albanian defence.
The pressure eventually told with two goals in two minutes. First, birthday boy Andrej Kramaric cut a lovely finish into the bottom corner before a clinical move down the left ended with substitute Gjasula turning into his own net via an unfortunate ricochet 14 minutes from time.
However, Gjasula would redeem himself in the fifth minute of stoppage time as he finished off a flowing move down the left to earn the minnows a priceless point.
The result sees Albania remain in third spot behind Italy and leaders Spain, who both have three points ahead of the top two in Group B facing off on Wednesday evening. Croatia sit bottom with a vastly inferior goal difference.
The Croatians will now face Italy on Monday evening with it all to do to reach the Last 16 while Albania will continue to dream against one of the tournament favourites Spain.
TALKING POINT – THE END OF AN ERA FOR CROATIA?
The Vatreni have seemed ageless for so long, reaching the latter stages of countless tournaments with Luka Modric the jewel in their crown.
However, it looks like those creaking legs are finally being exposed. The humbling against Spain raised more than an eyebrow and this surprise draw was some way short of the strong response Zlatko Dalic and his players were talking up ahead of this match, despite an much-improved second-half showing.
It's not over, but it could take something special to see them progress from here, with even a spot as a best third-placed team a tall order given they end with reigning champions Italy and have a negative goal difference.
As for Albania, what spirit and desire. The Red and Blacks scared Italy and could have been a couple of goals ahead prior to Croatia’s second-half revival. It’ll be another tough one against Spain, but they have caught the imagination in the competition and La Roja will know underestimating them would be to their cost.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - THOMAS STRAKOSHA (ALBANIA)
The Brentford shot-stopper made eight saves overall and was a key part in his country deservedly getting something out of a rollercoaster game.
