Preview: Cyprus vs. Latvia - prediction, team news, lineups

Underperforming nations Cyprus and Latvia meet in Larnaca for an international friendly on Thursday evening.

The two nations struggled in Euro 2024 qualifying but did both register a win in the autumn internationals, which they will hope to take positives from heading into the first set of fixtures this year.

In the first meeting between these two nations since the late 1990s, Cyprus will hope to replicate the two friendly successes they enjoyed over Latvia when the Baltic nation had not long gained independence.

The Cypriots were dealt a harsh hand in Euro qualifying though, being drawn with Spain, an ever-improving Scotland, Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard's Norway, and a Georgia side who may still reach the finals through the playoffs.

Temuri Ketsbaia has been slightly fortunate to keep his job given the criticism that has come in for him after eight defeats from eight in that section, being one of just five nations not to pick up a single point.

Cyprus also struggled in League C of the Nations League campaign which preceded qualifying, as a 5-1 defeat in Kosovo meant they finished bottom of their group, below Northern Ireland.

A shock win over neighbours Greece did limit some of the damage, but that remains their last competitive win, almost two years ago.

They would go on to beat Israel in a friendly in November 2022, but they would need to wait another 12 months to taste victory again, beating Lithuania in their last outing.

Latvia fared slightly better in Euro 2024 qualifying, but like their upcoming hosts, finished bottom of their group.

The Baltic nation were at least able to put some points on the board, as a win over Armenia, which ended their prospects of qualifying, means Latvia finished with three points.

Latvia are one of many nations who have enjoyed relative success thanks to the Nations League, and the last campaign proved enjoyable for them.

A 10-month spell between November 2021 and September 2022 saw Latvia go unbeaten in eight, winning six, with only two non-competitive outings.

However, ending that Nations League campaign with a defeat at home to Moldova and a draw in Andorra has ended up being costly, and that allowed Estonia to take a place in the Euro 2024 playoffs ahead of them, as the League D representative.

Manager Paolo Nicolato will also need to provide great encouragement to lift this side out of their current slump, as they enter this friendly having lost 10 of their last 11 fixtures.

After missing the last few Cyprus squads, striker Pieros Sotiriou is back at Ketsbaia's disposal for this encounter and is in contention to start.

Fellow attacker Marios Elia left the last camp early, but he is back along with Kostakis Artymatas, while Andreas Filiotis remains out injured for the hosts.

Latvia will be without important defender Antonijs Cernomordijs, who is a late withdrawal from the squad due to injury, while Davis Ikaunieks, Bogdans Samoilovs and Kriss Karklins have all missed out.

Over half of the squad play their football domestically, but there are some playing at a higher level in Europe, such as striker Roberts Uldrikis, who netted his 12th goal of the season for Cambuur in the KNVB Beker semi-finals recently.

Cyprus possible starting lineup:
Mall; Andreou, Karo, Laifis, Ioannou, Anderson Correia; Kyriakou, Kyprianou, Gogic, Charalampous; Kastanos

Latvia possible starting lineup:
Steinbors; Savalnieks, Maksimenko, Balodis, Ciganiks; Jaunzems, Tobers, Savaljevs, J Ikaunieks; Uldrikis, Gutkovskis



We say: Cyprus 1-1 Latvia

Neither nation has shown much to get excited about over the past 12 months apart from one-off performances against fellow weak opponents recently.

Both have attacking players playing at a decent level across Europe, but incoherent offensive play and defensive frailty is what will likely be on show in this underwhelming encounter.
