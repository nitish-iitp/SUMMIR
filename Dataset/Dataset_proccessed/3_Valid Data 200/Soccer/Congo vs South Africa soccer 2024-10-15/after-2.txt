BAFANA’S AFCON QUALIFICATION FATE LIES IN THEIR HANDS

Bafana Bafana is on the verge of securing their qualification for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations following their group K qualifiers’ match against Congo Brazzaville at the Nelson Mandela Bay stadium in Gqeberha on Friday evening. Bafana thrashed The Red Devils 5-0 courtesy of goals from Bathusi Aubaas, Lyle Foster, Iqraam Rayners and a brace by Teboho Mokoena.

The South African national football team arrived in Congo Brazzaville on Sunday afternoon as they prepare to battle it out against the same opponent with victory set to secure them qualification for next year’s continental showpiece in Morocco. Currently, Bafana and Uganda are level on 7 points after three matches in Group K with Congo-Brazzaville are on 3 points from their three matches while South Sudan are yet to register a victory.

The clash between Bafana and Congo will take place at the Stade Alphonse Massamba- Debat de Brazzavile which feature a synthetic pitch and Bafana coach Hugo Broos has voiced out his concern about the pitch following their light training session where a light drizzle helped to cool down the scorching daytime temperatures.

“My only concern is to see the pitch there. It’s a synthetic pitch,” Broos said. We’ve already had bad experiences with synthetic pitches in the past if they are not good. I think of the one in Rwanda, which was really bad. Let’s hope that the pitch is good and we can make or play our best football like we are used to because this team will want revenge,” Broos added.

“So we have to prepare for that also and be ready again for the difficult game but if we can achieve our level, play with same mentality, then we have big opportunity to win the game also.”

The kick-off is set for 6pm and the 1996 AFCON champion will look for nothing but a victory in order to book their ticket to Morocco next year.
