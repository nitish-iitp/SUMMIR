Wirtz nets Germany's fastest goal in friendly win over France
ByReuters
Updated: Mar 24, 2024, 03:51 pm

Florian Wirtz scored Germany's fastest international goal after seven seconds as the Euro 2024 hosts earned a confidence-boosting 2-0 friendly victory over France on Saturday to bag their first win in their last four games.

Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann was desperate for a good start to the year ahead of the tournament on home soil in June and that is exactly what he got.

- Football's fastest goals: Is Wirtz among quickest ever?

Wirtz surprised the French with his long-range effort for his first international goal after a well-practised move and pass from Toni Kroos, back from a three-year international retirement.

The goal was a few hundredths of a second faster than the previous German best, Lukas Podolski's seventh-second goal against Ecuador in 2013.

The hosts gradually took control and Kylian Mbappé forced a fine save from Germany's Marc-André ter Stegen to protect their lead in the 26th minute.

"We had a very good start and the kickoff was planned exactly that way," Germany's Nagelsmann said.

"It was important to protect the lead and after the break we improved further and carved out more chances. I am very satisfied with the way we fought. It is what we wish, to give it all every time.

"We got a confidence boost from this game. We are on a good path and played a very good game today."

France pushed for an equaliser with Ousmane Dembélé and Adrien Rabiot but it was the Germans, under pressure to improve after only two wins in their last 10 matches before Saturday, who scored again.

They doubled their lead early in the second half with Wirtz picking out Jamal Musiala with a cross and he cut back for Kai Havertz to finish the move.

France ran out of ideas in the second half and had to wait until late in the game for substitute Olivier Giroud to miss two chances before Germany defender Antonio Ruediger hit his own post as he tried to clear a ball.

"We weren't there, that's obvious," said France coach Didier Deschamps after his 150th game in charge. "The Germans played a high level match today. When we see our start to the match, with this goal, we are standing still.

"The Germans did things better than us. In terms of commitment and aggression, we were below. The first person to blame is me," he added.

Germany play the Netherlands on Tuesday when France face Chile.
