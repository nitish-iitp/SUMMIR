Nations League: Lithuania – Cyprus (live match)
 2024-09-06 16:10 © lff.lt

On Friday, the Lithuanian national team will start a new cycle with a match against Cyprus launching the new Nations League season.

The meeting will be broadcast live on the LRT Plius channel (broadcast link).

The match at the Marijampolė stadium will begin at 7 PM.

"I wouldn’t want the attention from the match to shift to the background due to circumstances that are somewhat bizarre. The stadium had become our home, and due to certain circumstances, we won’t be playing here. It’s a shame it happened this way.

We are at a stage where we are growing and gaining experiences. We weren’t prepared; we didn’t know what the circumstances might be after such major events, how much time it takes for the field to return to the required condition. I believe that everyone connected to this will learn from the mistakes made, as we all learn, and such things won’t happen again in the future,” said Lithuania's head coach Edgaras Jankauskas about the transfer of the match from Kaunas to Marijampolė.
