Match Time & Date:

Prediction: 1-1

	

Cyprus

Lithuania will be aiming to kick off their Nations League campaign in great manner when they take on Cyprus at S. Dariaus ir S. Girėno stadionas. Lithuania failed to impress in the EURO 2024 qualifiers, with the team collecting only six points in the process, but they are surely capable of matching Cyprus in front of home fans. Edgaras Jankauskas’ men are tough to beat at home, but, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from Friday’s qualifier as well.

Goalkeepers Deividas Mikelionis and Mantas Bertasius have received their first call-ups for the September matches. The Cypriotes, on the other hand, aim to build on a routine 4-1 win over San Marino, but beating Lithuania on the road is easier said than done. Taking everything into account, we predict that the two sides are going to share the spoils in Friday’s encounter. A man to watch in the away team will be Verona forward Grigoris Kastanos.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (LITHUANIA):

Lithuania was occupied by Soviet Union in 1940 and 50 years later they regained their independence. The Lithuania national football team played their first official game on June 24, 1923, with the team suffering a heavy 5-0 loss to Estonia in Kaunas.

The former Soviet republic have yet to book their place at the finals of a major tournament, but they were competitive in the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifiers as they managed to play out a draw with Germany on the road. Lithuania managed to beat Scotland in the qualifiers for the 2004 European Championship, but they eventually failed to book their place at the showpiece tournament in Portugal. Marius Stankevicius is considered Lithuania’s most notable footballer as he played for the likes of Lazio, Hannover, Sampdoria, Sevilla and Valencia in the past.

LFF Stadium is the home ground of the Lithuania national football team and the venue, who capacity is 5.067, was opened in 2004. Lithuania play their home games on artificial turf.
