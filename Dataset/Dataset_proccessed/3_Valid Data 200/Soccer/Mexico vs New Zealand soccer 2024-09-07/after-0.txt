TAB odds

Mexico are paying $1.33 to continue their winning run against the All Whites, who are paying $7.00 to pull off an impressive win, with the draw at $4.50.

Ben Old is set to make his first All Whites appearances since moving to France to join Ligue Un club Saint-Étienne.

Player to watch

Ben Old (All Whites midfielder): After making a big move from the Wellington Phoenix to Saint Ettiene in France during the New Zealand winter, the 22-year-old will be eager to make an impression in the All Whites setup, with the start of World Cup qualifying just around the corner in October. Old has impressed amidst Saint Ettiene’s poor start to the Ligue Un season.

History

The All Whites and Mexico have met seven times over the years, including in a home-and-away playoff for a place at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Both those matches ended in defeats for New Zealand, as did the four others this century, the most recent of which was a 2-1 loss at the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia. The All Whites did have a 4-0 win when they hosted Mexico in 1980, ahead of their first successful World Cup qualification campaign.

Who do you think will win?
