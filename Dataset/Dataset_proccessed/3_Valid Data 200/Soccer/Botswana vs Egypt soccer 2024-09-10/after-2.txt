Cairo, September 10, 2024: The Egyptian national football team, under the leadership of Hossam Hassan, is set to face Botswana in a pivotal second-round match of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers. The game will kick off at 7:00 PM Cairo time at the Francistown Stadium in Botswana, which has a capacity of 26,000 spectators.

Egypt currently leads the group with 3 points, tied with Mauritania on goal difference, while Botswana is in third place with no points. This match is crucial for both teams, as Egypt looks to solidify its position at the top of the group, while Botswana hopes to gain their first points.

Hossam Hassan has worked closely with his players to prepare for this encounter, urging them to focus on scoring an early goal and maintaining balance between attack and defense. The team will need to be disciplined to counter Botswana, especially on their home ground, where they will likely play with extra motivation. Hassan’s tactical plan will focus on quick transitions and utilizing the speed of Egypt’s star players, particularly on the wings.

Injuries have forced Hassan to make adjustments to his lineup. Key players like Imam Ashour, Omar Marmoush, and Mostafa Mohamed are unavailable due to injury, and experienced defender Ahmed Hegazy will miss the match due to personal reasons. Despite these setbacks, Hassan has opted to retain Hamdi Fathi and Rami Rabia in central defense, while relying on Mohamed Elneny, Marawan Attia, and Zizo to control the midfield.

The attack will feature a formidable trio of Mohamed Salah, Trezeguet, and Osama Faisal. Salah, Egypt’s captain and key player, will lead the offensive charge, with his pace and finishing ability expected to be crucial in breaking down Botswana’s defense. Trezeguet’s creativity and Osama Faisal’s presence as a central striker will complement Salah’s efforts, providing Egypt with a balanced and potent attack.

The starting lineup is expected to feature Mohamed El-Shennawy in goal, with Mohamed Hani, Hamdi Fathi, Rami Rabia, and Mohamed Hamdi forming the defensive line. The midfield trio of Attia, Elneny, and Zizo will provide both defensive cover and attacking support, while Salah, Trezeguet, and Faisal will be tasked with leading the attack.

This match represents a key opportunity for Egypt to strengthen their position in the AFCON qualifiers, but they must remain cautious against a determined Botswana team. A win would put Egypt in a strong position in the group, while Botswana will be motivated to pull off an upset in front of their home crowd. Hassan's team will need to execute their game plan effectively to come away with the crucial three points.

Egypt's expected lineup for today’s match includes:

Goalkeeper: Mohamed El-Shennawy

Defenders: Mohamed Hani, Hamdi Fathi, Rami Rabia, Mohamed Hamdi

Midfielders: Marawan Attia, Mohamed Elneny, Zizo

Forwards: Trezeguet, Mohamed Salah, Osama Faisal

The team is eager to secure the win and claim all three points.
