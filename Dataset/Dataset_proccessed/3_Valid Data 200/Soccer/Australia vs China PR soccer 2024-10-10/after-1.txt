A bit of fire from Ivankovic at the end of his press conference when one of the travelling Chinese journalist reads of several stats that painted Hu Hetao’s performance tonight in a poor light. The coach cutting a defiant figure.

China coach Branko Ivankovic, speaking through a translator, is asked about his side being without a point after games against Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Australia.

“Like we mentioned in the press conference before, we’ve played against Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Japan in our last four games. They are all the top teams in Asia. It was a tough game, we need to be more excellent and better so we can pick up points. And we were close to a point in this game. So what we need to do now is to carry on. Our target has always been the top four of this group so we can play in the next stage of qualification. So what we need to do is keep our passion and fight for our next game, which is really important. The real fighting is just about to start.”

THE FULL-TIME WHISTLE BLOWS & THE POPOVIC ERA STARTS IN EARNEST!
Australia triumphs over China 3-1, with goals to Miller, Goodwin & Velupillay.

Really can’t overstate how important that comeback was for Australia. Yeah, it wasn’t the greatest performance in the world by any stretch of the imagination but they got the win. The amount of air that was let out of their tyres when China went ahead was palpable and with a trip to Japan on the agenda, that would have been magnified exponentially had they not been able to come back.

Instead, they can now head to Tokyo with a win under their belts and – with a game against Saudi Arabia at home to come next month – some kind of margin for error against a side that has looked a class above in Asian qualifying.

Full Time! Australia 3-1 China

A wave of relief hits the stadium as Men At Work’s “Down Under” wrings out across Adelaide Oval. Thanks to goals from Miller, Goodwin, and Velupillay, the Socceroos are on the board in the third phase of Asian qualification. Exhale.

Three goals. Three points. 👏

Goal! Australia 3-1 China. Nishan Velupillay (90+)

A goal on debut for Velupillay! What a moment for the kid!

The Socceroos knock the ball around the penalty area and after O’Neill’s effort is blocked to his feet, the Melbourne Victory attacker controls the ball, swivels, and picks out the top corner.

A dream debut for Nish 🤩

He added the finishing touches on our win to seal the points in stoppage time ⏱️

90 Mins: Velupillay with a neat little move to beat his marker and burst down the right flank. He opts to play an early ball to the back post – not the worst idead in the world given the players were headed there – but can’t find Bos.

88 Mins: Back-to-back chances for Bos and McGree on the left but neither are able to beat the defenders in front of them and trouble Wang.

07.01 EDT

86 Mins: Bos gets down the left but carries the ball out before he’s able to get his cross in.

The linesperson keeps their flag down, though, erring on the side of caution with VAR on play, and the crowd gets to give a small cheer after Goodwin puts the ball into the net just in case. But it’s not a goal.

84 Mins: The thoughts of Rob Haigh on the emails as the Socceroos inch closer to a vital win: “Thrown in at the deep end is an understatement, but if they finish with 3 points then all well and good. These players know they’re in a tournament now and nothing is a given, they’ve to step up to the plate.”

77 Mins: The crowd figure is in and it’s a new Socceroos’ record at Adelaide Oval: 46,291 in attendance. AFC regulations prevented Football Australia from selling standing room tickets on the ground’s hill, meaning it couldn’t challenge the all-time football record at the venue.

Amazing Adelaide 😍

76 Mins: Tonight’s game represents the early kickoff for today’s Asian qualifiers.

Later tonight Jordan will host South Korea, group A leaders Uzbekistan will host Iran, Qatar meets Kyrgyzstan, Oman hosts Kuwait, the UEA clashes with North Korea.

Bahrain is set to welcome Indonesia to Riffa, Saudi Arabia and Japan have a heavyweight showdown in Jeddah, and Iraq plays Palestine.

06.48 EDT

73 Mins: China are showing more urgency as they go chasing something from this game.

A loss tonight would make it three on the bounce in this phase of qualification and almost drive a stake through their hopes of qualification already at this early stage. They’ve been given absolutely no favours with their draw, playing Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Australia first up.

65 Mins: A Mexican wave has broken out at Adelaide Oval. That probably merits another seven years without a game if you ask me.

60 Mins: Confidence is starting to return for the Socceroos now that they’ve got the lead, McGree finding a yard of space to send a shot across the face of goal.

58 Mins: Behich wins a corner on the left that Goodwin swings onto the head of Geria. It loops off the newly introduced defender’s head and goes just wide.

10 Oct 2024
06.31 EDT

56 Mins: This is the second time in as many games that China has taken the lead only to subsequently fall behind. Last time out, however, it was a 90th minute goal from Hassan Kadesh that lifted Saudi Arabia to a 2-1 win. We’ve still got plenty of football to play here.

55 Mins: Just as they did after Miller opened the scoring, China quickly move up the other end and try to find an immediate response. Zhang’s long range effort is charged down and Australia eventually scramble it away.

Goal! Australia 2-1 China. Craig Goodwin ('53)

Craig Goodwin you star!

The hometown hero with an absolute thunderbolt of a goal to put Australia ahead. He receives a pass from Irvine in the middle of the park and drives forward and, with space opening up in front of him, blasts a shot from outside the box with that wonderful left foot of his that beats Wang.

Craig Goodwin. It's what he does 🔥

He scores a beauty from distance in front of his hometown to put us in front 🚀

The thoughts of the email inbox at halftime!

Patrick O’Brien: “China are playing 6-2-2 when defending. Even a good Australian side would find it hard to unpick that lock!”

Phil Withall: “I’ve a feeling it’ll take something special for Australia to get anything from this game now, let alone a win.

“The Chinese have a defensive set up that is looking very solid, a bank of five seems to be always present, with numbers quickly coming in to support. Need someone to find something special or the World Cup dream is pretty much over.”

Rob Haigh: “Well, in the light of Arnold’s resignation, the job remains in the same place: difficult bordering on impossible because, if Oz dont get the win here, Japan will finish the job.”

Australia’s players are making their way back into the pitch and it looks like we’re set for a double change. Irankunda and Deng look to be making way for Riley McGree and Jason Geria – the former returning after missing the last window through injury and the latter making his first appearance for the Socceroos since his lone cap in 2017.

Share
10 Oct 2024
06.16 EDT

Miller’s goal, officially recorded at 45+2, ended a 207 minute wait for the Socceroos to open their account in this phase of qualification.

Xie’s goal was also the first time an opponent had put the ball into their net during this phase of qualification – the goal conceded against Bahrain an own goal from Souttar – but the defence has not looked the kind of assured unit its reputation in Asia would suggest they should be against a side like China.

The stats at halftime tell a tale of domination: Australia seeing 81% of possession and sending in eight shots to China’s two.

That tale would be a false one, though.

Both sides will head into the break with only one shot on target -- their goals -- to their name, with the longstanding struggles that the Socceroos have had with the ball when asked to get past a low block showing no signs of abating even with the switch from Arnold to Popovic in the dugout.

It’s definitely not one for the neutrals, as neither side has been good.

Half-time: Australia 1-1 China

Miller’s late goal has the hosts level heading into the halftime break after Xie had the visitors ahead in the 20th minute. A massively important goal for the Socceroos, who were looking increasingly bereft of confidence after falling behind and struggling to break down their opponents defence.

45+ Mins: China are having their best spell of the game, winning another corner and then one more for good measure. Irankunda boots the latter way to end the half.

Share
10 Oct 2024
06.01 EDT

45+ Mins: After a VAR check of Miller’s goal sends a shiver through the spine of every Australian watching, China promptly add to the tension by going right up the other end and launching a rare attack.

Souttar slides in to prevent Zhang getting a shot off and the resulting corner is cleared away.

Goal! Australia 1-1 China - Lewis Miller (45+)

Australia’s difficult relationship with creating chances from open play continues but set pieces are always there for them!

After Behich wins a free kick on the left, Goodwin drives a ball into the top of the six-yard-box and Miller rises up through a mass of players to nod it home.

Lewis Miller with his first for the #Socceroos 💪

He connects with Goodwin's delivery to bring us back to 1-1 before half time ⏱️
