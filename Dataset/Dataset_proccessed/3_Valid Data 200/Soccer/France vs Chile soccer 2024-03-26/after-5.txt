France World Cup winner Frank Leboeuf has criticised Didier Deschamps for his handling of Arsenal defender William Saliba ahead of Euro 2024.

The 23-year-old has been one of Arsenal’s standout performers this season as Mikel Arteta’s side continue their push to win the Premier League and the Champions League.

But Saliba was left on the bench by Deschamps for France’s 2-0 defeat to Germany on Saturday evening, meaning he has now started in just two of France’s last 18 matches.

Saliba is expected to start France’s second friendly against Chile in Marseille on Tuesday evening, however, in the build-up to the game he received criticism from Deschamps, who claimed the Arsenal defender does things ‘he does not like’.

When asked to name France’s weakest area of the team ahead of Euro 2024, Leboeuf told ESPN after the loss to Germany: ‘I would say defence right now.

‘It used to be strong. But it’s like Didier Deschamps is wondering who is the best duo at centre-back.

‘He tried something else [for the defeat to Germany]. In the middle of the park I would say we have a list of fantastic players, how they are going to match together is going to be a question mark but the talent is there. When you see the names of the players in the middle of the park for France, it’s crazy.

‘Didier has to find the right four players to play as defenders. When he does so, we will be very strong.’

When it was suggested that Saliba is currently France’s strongest defender, Leboeuf replied: ‘Yeah, I agree.

‘That’s a real question for me. I don’t understand why Saliba isn’t playing all the time.

‘He showed to the world that he is the best defender in the world right now, well, the best French defender right now playing for a big club.

‘I don’t know why he’s not playing there. He’s absolutely tremendous. He should deserve the chance to show it at that level.’

Benjamin Pavard received criticism for his performance in the 2-0 defeat to Germany on Saturday and while Leboeuf has been impressed with the 27-year-old’s impact at Inter this season, he feels Deschamps needs to ‘rethink’ his defence ahead of Euro 2024 this summer.

‘He signed for Inter Milan last summer, he’s been absolutely fantastic for Inter Milan as a centre-back, you can ask any Inter Milan fan, they’d say Pavard is a fantastic centre-back,’ Leboeuf said.

‘Pavard is a great defender. Is he the best? In France I don’t think so, we have much better centre-backs than him but that’s Didier Deschamps’ choice, but I think he has to rethink that because it didn’t work [against Germany].’
