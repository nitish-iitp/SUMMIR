Both aiming to pick up their first wins of the third round, Kyrgyzstan and North Korea will clash at Stadion Im in Bishkek on Tuesday night for an AFC Cup World Cup qualifier.

The White Falcons suffered a heavy defeat at the home of Qatar last time out, whilst Chollima played out a share of the spoils with the United Arab Emirates.

Alongside Group C strugglers China, Kyrgyzstan are one of two sides in the third round of AFC World Cup qualifying who are yet to collect any points from their opening three section matches, meaning that their potential spot in North America in 2026 is in serious doubt.

The White Falcons commenced their October international window with a heavy defeat at the home of the 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar, who eased past their stuttering visitors 3-1 courtesy of goals from Almoez Ali, Ibrahim Al-Hassan and an own goal from Tamirlan Kozubaev.

Hurtling towards the fourth match of the section, Kyrgyzstan find themselves rooted to the bottom of the Group A standings with zero points, four points behind fourth-placed Qatar who are occupying the lowest of the places that allow progression into the next round of qualifying.

The White Falcons put up a good fight during their most recent home contest back at the start of September, although goals from Joel Kojo and Odijon Abdurahmonov could not prevent the hosts at Stadium Im losing 3-2 against early pacesetters Uzbekistan.

Whilst their Under-20s women's side enjoys success on the global stage, the North Korea's senior men are failing in their attempts to qualify for a first World Cup finals since South Africa in 2010, with Tuesday's visitors yet to earn a win from three matches in Group A of third-round qualifying.

That being said, Chollima have recorded respectable back-to-back draws with Qatar and United Arab Emirates since a narrow loss to leaders Uzbekistan on September 5, meaning that North Korea are not a million miles away from converting minor points into a much-needed maximum.

It looked as if North Korea were hurtling towards a second defeat of the section when Yahya Al Ghassani fired the hosts ahead at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium on Thursday night, but a last-minute strike from Jong Il-Gwan forced a share of the points in Al Ain against the UAE.

Sitting in fifth place - five points behind second-placed Iran - Chollima will be viewing Tuesday night's trip to Kyrgyzstan as a major opportunity to record their maiden victory of the third round as they thrive to keep their faint World Cup ambitions alive into the New Year.

Finding the net from midfield in impressive style last time out, Alimardon Shukurov is set to retain his spot in the engine room for Kyrgyzstan on Tuesday night.

Despite scoring in the wrong goal against Qatar, defender Kozubaev should keep his place in the backline alongside Valeri Kichin and Eldiyar Zarypbekov.

Struggling to pose a consistent threat against the 2022 World Cup hosts, the White Falcons could make some attacking alterations for this clash.

Regardless of his crucial penalty miss versus the UAE, former Juventus and Cagliari forward Kwang-Song Han will hold onto his spot in the North Korea side.

There is set to be some changes for Chollima in the attacking line, though, with 22-year-old Jo-Ruk Ri hooked off during the half-time break on Thursday night.


Kyrgyzstan possible starting lineup:
Tokotaev; Mischenko, Zarypbekov, Kichin, Kenzhebaev; Abdurahmonov, Uzdenov, Shukurov; Uulu, Kojo

North Korea possible starting lineup:
Ju-Hyok; Ok-Chol, Kum-Song, Yu-Song, Pom-Hyok; Chung-Song, Kuk-Chol, Kuk-Bom, Il-Song; Kwang-Song, Kuk-Jin



We say: Kyrgyzstan 1-2 North Korea

Both desperate to earn their first wins of the section, we are expecting an attacking affair between Kyrgyzstan and North Korea on Tuesday night.

The White Falcons have struggled to get going in the section so far, meaning that we can imagine the visitors edging to victory in Bishkek.
