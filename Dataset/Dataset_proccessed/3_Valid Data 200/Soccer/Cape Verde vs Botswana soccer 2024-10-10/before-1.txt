Cape Verde will host Botswana at the Estadio Nacional de Cabo Verde in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match on Thursday.

The hosts are seeking to win two consecutive matches in this qualifying campaign, while the visitors are aiming to claim their first points.

After suffering a 3-0 defeat to Egypt at the Cairo International Stadium in their first match, Cape Verde's dream of a fifth AFCON appearance was reignited with a 2-0 victory over Mauritania in their second match.

Ryan Mendes, who was part of the attacking trio, emerged as the hero of the day, scoring a brace, the first of which was from the penalty spot in the first half and the second in the 75th minute.

Following this result, the Blue Sharks occupy second place in Group C with three points, narrowly ahead of third-placed Mauritania, who have the same number of points but a lower goal difference.

The upcoming matches against Botswana, the first encounters between the two nations, will be crucial in determining the final standings within the group.

The Blue Sharks have demonstrated defensive resilience in recent games, keeping six clean sheets in their last eight matches across all competitions, and they have also been formidable at home, remaining unbeaten in their last five matches, winning four and drawing one.

Meanwhile, Botswana's hopes of a second AFCON appearance – their only one was in 2012 – appear likely to be delayed given their poor start to the current qualifying campaign.

Didier Gomes Da Rosa's men lost 1-0 to Mauritania in their first match, before being thrashed 4-0 by Egypt in their second match a couple of days later.

The defeat extended Botswana's winless run across all competitions to five matches – two draws and three losses each – leaving them bottom of Group C with no points, having conceded five and scored none.

Didier Gomes was appointed as the head coach of the Zebras in November ahead of the World Cup 2026 qualifiers, and he has recorded only two wins so far – both in World Cup qualifying matches.

The home side have also failed to score in seven of 12 matches under the French coach, while they have conceded 14 times in that period.

Cape Verde deployed a front three of Gilson Tavares, Mendes, and Helio Varela in their last match, and they may retain this attacking trio for Thursday's clash.

Mendes, the Blue Sharks' record goalscorer with 20 strikes, is the man to watch, while Dailon Livramento and Willy Semedo will be hoping to start after playing as substitutes in the previous match.

Meanwhile, Botswana will be without Thatayaone Kgamanyane and Mpho Kgaswane, who sustained injuries while playing for their club sides.

Midfielder Gape Mohutsiwa has delivered strong performances in the opening two defeats, and he is crucial to any potential upset by the Zebras.


Cape Verde possible starting lineup:
Varela; Fernandes, Costa, Diney, Moreira; D. Duarte, L. Duarte, Pina; Mendes, Tavares, Varela

Botswana possible starting lineup:
Phoko; Mangolo, Ditlhokwe, Kopelang, Velaphi; Mohutsiwa, Gaolaolwe, Majafi; Ramotse, Orebonye, Seakanyeng



We say: Cape Verde 2-0 Botswana

Cape Verde are clear favourites heading into this clash, as they are a significantly superior team and have been impressive at home, facing a Botswana side that lacks quality across all departments.
