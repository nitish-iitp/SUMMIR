Cyprus vs. Lithuania Friendly Match Preview – Prediction, Team news, Lineups
By Sports Weez - November 18, 2023

Cyprus and Lithuania will meet in Limassol for a friendly match, concluding their Euro 2024 qualifying campaigns, although neither side posed a threat to the top two spots in their respective groups.

Both nations had disappointing Nations League performances and are not eligible for a playoff spot.

Match Preview:

Cyprus endured a disappointing Euro 2024 qualifying run, suffering an 8th consecutive defeat against Spain with a 3-1 loss.

Temuri Ketsbaia’s team struggled to compete, conceding early goals, but managed to break their goal drought with Kostas Pileas netting in the second half.

Cyprus’ only win in their last 14 competitive matches came unexpectedly against Greece in the Nations League last year.

Lithuania, in contrast, had a better qualifying campaign, securing their position above Bulgaria in their group.

Despite a recent 2-0 loss to Montenegro, Edgaras Jankauskas’s team managed to gather four points against Bulgaria, including a notable away win in Sofia.

They also posed a threat to stronger opponents, notably holding Hungary to a draw and scoring a late equalizer against Montenegro.

Team News:

Cyprus manager Ketsbaia might experiment with the lineup but could call upon key players like Grigoris Kastanos. However, Demetris Christofi is omitted due to limited club game time.

Lithuania will miss Eligijus Jankauskas and Paulius Golubickas due to injuries, while Artemijus Tutyskinas remains a long-term absentee.

Possible Lineups:

Cyprus:(5-3-2)

Mall;

Andreou, Pileas, Gogic, Laifis, Anderson Correia;

Kyriakou, Kyprianou, Charalampous;

Kastanos, Pittas

Lithuania:(4-3-3)

Gertmonas;

Lasickas, Girdvainis, Lekiatas, Sirvys;

Utkus, Vorobjovas, Gineitis;

Slivka, Paulaskas, Cernych

Prediction:

Both teams aim for a positive end to their campaigns. Cyprus seeks to break their losing streak, while Lithuania aims for an away result.

Predicting a 1-1 draw, considering Lithuania’s struggles away from home and Cyprus’s determination to end on a positive note in this low-stakes encounter.
