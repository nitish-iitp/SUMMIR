FRANKIE Musonda says Chipolopolo are going all out this evening against Morocco in their must-win and final 2023 AFCON Group F match at Stade Laurent Pokou in San Pedro.

Chipolopolo face The Atlas Lions in a boom-or-bust fixture that will see them either stay or make an early departure from the AFCON Ivory Coast is hosting from January 13 to February 11.

Musonda said in an interview in San Pedro that Zambia is eager to redeem itself after 1-1 draw’s in their opening two Group F fixtures against DR Congo and Tanzania.

The highlight came with the last game against Tanzania on January 21 that saw Chipolopolo seeing the play with 10 men in the final 47 minutes after Roderick Kabwe was sent off late in the first half in which they were down one-nil before Patson Daka’s 88th minute equaliser.

“Of course, we are disappointed obviously not to win the game but under the circumstances of the red card, a point is better than nothing and it gives us a chance in the last game to qualify,” Musonda said.

Technically, Zambia’s qualification to the last 16 is dependent on clinching one of the four best third place finishers slots.

Others in the third best race are hosts Ivory Coast, Algeria, Namibia, Cameroon together with Ghana who despite finishing on 2 points were by press time in with an outside chance.

“There is still a lot of fight in this team,” Musonda said.

“We have overcome many challenges together before so this is another one, we are going to have to give our everything.

“We know we are going to have to be at our best to be in with a chance but we will focus on the next game and yeah, we are going to give it everything.”

This will be Chipolopolo and The Atlas Lions third AFCON meeting where Morocco have an edge with one win and a draw.

Zambia lost 1-0 at Egypt 1986 and drew 1-1 at Burkina Faso 1998 and in both matches, Chipolopolo made group stage exits
