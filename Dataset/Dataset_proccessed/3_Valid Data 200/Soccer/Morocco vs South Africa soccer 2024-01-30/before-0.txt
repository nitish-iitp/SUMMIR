The final match in the last 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations sees Morocco take on South Africa at Stade de San Pedro on Tuesday night.

The winner of this match will move on to the quarter-final, where they will face either Cape Verde or Mauritania, who square off a day before.

Widely tipped as the tournament's strongest contenders before a ball was kicked, Morocco are targeting their second AFCON title in history.

The Atlas Lions initially lived up to expectations in their opening match, dispatching group minnows Tanzania by a convincing 3-0 margin. However, their quest for a smooth run hit a snag in their second outing, a frustrating 1-1 draw against DR Congo, before finishing off the group stage with a 1-0 win over Zambia.

Walid Regragui's side finished the group stage with seven points, four ahead of the second-placed Congo DR, and will now look to dispatch South Africa for a place in the next round.

Bafana Bafana are familiar foes for Morocco, having played them twice during the qualifying series for this tournament, with both teams picking up one win each.

The Atlas Lions, who have reached the quarter-finals in two of the last three AFCON editions, with 2019 being the exception, will be looking to go all the way to match their best performance, which was lifting the trophy in 1976.

Regragui, who was not on the bench in the win over Zambia, will be back on the touchline on Tuesday, after CAF lifted the ban imposed on the 48-year-old following an incident in the aftermath of their group game against DR Congo.

South Africa huffed and puffed their way into the round of 16, finishing second in Group E with four points, level on points with third-placed Namibia, but with a superior goal difference.

Hugo Broos's side began their AFCON campaign with a deflating 2-0 loss to Mali. However, they bounced back in style with a convincing 4-0 win over Namibia before concluding the group stage with a goalless draw against Tunisia.

Bafana Bafana have reached the quarter-finals in two of their last three AFCON appearances, and will be aiming to replicate that feat when they take on Morocco.

Head-to-head, South Africa hold a slight edge in this fixture, boasting three victories from eight meetings, with two losses and three draws completing the picture.

However, the Atlas Lions claimed the spoils the last time these teams met at AFCON. That, though, was their only win in five encounters between the two sides in the tournament's history, with South Africa coming out on top twice and the other two matches ending in stalemates.

Noussair Mazraoui has yet to see action in this tournament and remains a doubt for Morocco. However, the centre-back pairing of Romain Saiss, formerly of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and West Ham's Nayef Aguerd are expected to start.

Youssef En-Nesyri, who missed the win over Zambia, is set to return to the starting XI and lead the line on Tuesday.

South Africa suffered no fresh injury concerns after their match against Tunisia. Given their solid performance last time out, it would not be a surprise if Broos named an unchanged lineup.

Evidence Makgopa, still searching for his first goal in the tournament, should headline the attack once more, supported by Percy Tau, Themba Zwane and Thapelo Morena.


Morocco possible starting lineup:
Bono; Hakimi, Aguerd, Saiss, Chibi; Amrabat; Ziyech, Ounahi, Amallah, Boufal; En-Nesyri

South Africa possible starting lineup:
Williams; Mudau, Xulu, Mvala, Modiba; Mokoena, Sithole; Zwane, Tau, Morena; Makgopa




We say: Morocco 3-1 South Africa

South Africa may offer strong resistance, but the gulf in quality between them and their opponents, Morocco, will ultimately prove decisive. The Atlas Lions have seen off the opposition with impressive composure throughout the tournament, and we anticipate another assured showing from them.
