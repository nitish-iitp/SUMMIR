Start as you mean to go on

Two games down at this tournament and we have already seen plenty of goals.

There were six in Munich yesterday and four just now in Cologne.

More of the same going forward, please!

Player of the Match: Granit Xhaka

Getty Images

Granit Xhaka came into Euro 2024 on the back of a fantastic season at Bayer Leverkusen and he seems determined to carry it on.

Playing just 15 miles from Leverkusen's home today, he was sublime and is the deserving winner of the Player of the Match award.

Although, had Embolo been introduced any earlier, I think the former Arsenal man might have had to concede it!

Hungary disappointed after pre-tournament promise

Getty Images

Switzerland were outstanding in that game, Hungary really disappointing.

It was the structure of the team that got Marco Rossi's side to the finals automatically, but it really let them down today — the use of Szoboszlai as build-up, creator, and striker was puzzling.

Death by 1000 (well, 22) passes

Getty Images

Embolo's goal was lovely on the eye and Aebischer's was a beauty, but Switzerland's first goal was a work of art.

There were 22 passes in the build up to Duah's goal, the third longest passing sequence leading to a goal at the European Championship on record (since 1980).

Embolo joins Shaqiri in the history books

Getty Images

By scoring today, Embolo has become just the second Switzerland player to score in successive European Championships, having scored against Wales at Euro 2020.

The first player was Xherdan Shaqiri who scored at Euro 2016 and 2020 — and he could make it three in a row as he is part of Switzerland's squad in Germany.

Switzerland win 3-1 in Cologne!

FT Hungary 1-3 Switzerland

The perfect start to Euro 2024 for Switzerland who have put themselves in an excellent position to make the knockouts.

They were much the better team for an hour, but then wobbled as Hungary drastically improved.

The introduction of Embolo from the bench made the difference, though and he put the rubber stamp on the victory with a lovely stoppage-time finish.

A man born for tournament football!

90+5' Hungary 1-3 Switzerland

Embolo has had so many months and seasons ruined by injuries, but he always comes alive at major tournaments for Switzerland.

He was in the right place to capitalise on a horrendous header from Orban and, as Gulacsi raced out to meet him, Embolo just lifted the ball over his head and into the back of the net.

He has had such an impact on this game since coming on in the 74th minute.

Embolo seals it for Switzerland!

90+3' Hungary 1-3 Switzerland

A terrible header from Orban, but an excellent finish from Embolo and that will be enough for the three points!

Switzerland miss golden chance to seal the win

90+2' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Switzerland perhaps should have sealed the victory there.

More great work from Embolo left him bearing down on goal from the halfway line and he had Fabian Rieder for support. The substitute took the ball round Gulacsi but his touch was too heavy and took him too wide and Hungary managed to recover.

Brilliant Gulacsi save keeps out Xhaka header

90' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Another big intervention from the Hungary goalkeeper who reacts brilliantly to keep out Xhaka's near-post header from a corner.

What made it even harder for Gulacsi was that it flicked off Szoboszlai's head on its way through — great reflexes from the 34-year-old.

Switzerland manager Yakin shown a yellow card, too

88' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Murat Yakin was then given a yellow card after his reaction to not getting the advantage from referee Slavko Vincic.

Switzerland were through on goal and that could have sealed the game.

Bolla shown a yellow card

87' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Another straightforward yellow card for the referee to hand out as Bolla stops the progress of Amdouni with a cynical foul.

Switzerland seem unhappy that an advantage was not played as they had a chance to continue the attack, but I think it would have been offside.

Embolo making a real difference

Getty Images

85' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Embolo has been excellent for Switzerland since coming on from the bench.

His hold-up play has been superb and it is helping his side get up the pitch while also taking significant pressure off his defensive team-mates.

The Hungary defenders don't quite seem to know how to live with him.

The crosses keep coming from Hungary

82' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Switzerland are creaking as the Hungary pressure is turned up another notch.

They feel their best route to a result is by loading crosses into the penalty area but, so far, the team leading the match are dealing with them. First Akanji headed clear then the relatively diminutive Rodriguez did the same.

Two more changes for Hungary

80' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

A pair of changes for Hungary.

Somewhat surprisingly, Bournemouth's Kerkez is withdrawn. Although, it is quite clearly a change of formation as he is replaced by striker Martin Adam.

In defence, Szalai is off with Marton Dardai on in his place.

Hungary pushing for an equaliser

Getty Images

78' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Where was this Hungary side in the first hour of the match?

They have looked like 11 completely different players in the last 15 or 20 minutes and have now got a real chance of getting a point here. Although, Switzerland's experienced defence is holding strong against waves of crosses into the penalty area.

Embolo replaces Vargas

74' Hungary 1-2 Switzerland

Another change to Switzerland's attacking ranks as Breel Embolo — a man who feels synonymous with his nation's major tournament success in recent years — is introduced in place of Vargas.
