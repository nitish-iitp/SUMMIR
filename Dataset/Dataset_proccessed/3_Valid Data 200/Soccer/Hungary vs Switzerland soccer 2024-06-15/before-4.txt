Hungary vs Switzerland odds
Hungary 23/10
Draw 9/4
Switzerland 5/4

This is only the second time these two nations are meeting in the finals of a major tournament.

The last time was at the World Cup in 1938, in which Hungary won 2-0.

Switzerland are favoured to come out on top in this though at 5/4.

That's not only down to their squad but it's also down to their recent form against Hungary in all competitions.

The Swiss nation have won six of their last nine games against Hungary, not losing to Hungary since 1998.

This game has seen a fair few goals in their last few meetings, with Switzerland beating Hungary 3-2 and 5-2 in the World Cup qualifiers in 2016 and 2017 respectively.

Of course the teams have changed a lot since then, seven years is a long time with goalscorers in that 5-2 win including Granit Xhaka, Fabian Frei, Steven Zuber and Stefan Lichtsteiner.

The Swiss have gone unbeaten in their last four games, drawing twice and winning another two.

And Xhaka is still a key part to their midfield and should play a leading role in this tournament as he has in all other major tournaments since 2014.

He played 33 games in the season just gone for Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen and alongside former Premier League player Xherdan Shaqiri, should give them some hope in reaching the knockouts at least.
