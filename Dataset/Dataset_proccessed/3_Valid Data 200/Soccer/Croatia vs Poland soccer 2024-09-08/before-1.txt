Can Poland’s Momentum Stop Croatia’s Struggles in Osijek?
Croatia have failed to win any of their last four matches.
Poland have scored in six consecutive games but have yet to keep a clean sheet in the same period.
Croatia’s current winless run includes two draws, indicating a high chance of shared points.
Best Bet


Under 2.5 Goals @ 17/20




BET HERE


Reasoning
Under 2.5 goals is a reasonable bet. Both Stoke and Hull have struggled in attack, scoring just five goals combined in their league matches. A cautious, low-scoring affair is likely, with limited chances.

Odds subject to change



	

On Sunday evening, Croatia face Poland in a UEFA Nations League clash at the Opus Arena, Osijek. Both teams are eager to make a mark in this competitive group, with Croatia looking to recover from a tough opening defeat against Portugal. Poland, on the other hand, head into the match buoyed by a thrilling 3-2 victory over Scotland. With both nations having underwhelmed in recent international tournaments, this match presents an opportunity to change their fortunes.

The best betting value for this encounter lies in backing Poland to avoid defeat, with a draw or an away win emerging as the most plausible outcomes. While Croatia have been a dominant force in international football over the past few years, their current form raises significant doubts. After failing to secure a win in their last four matches, Croatia are clearly struggling to find consistency. Their most recent defeat against Portugal exposed vulnerabilities, especially with several key players missing and their defence not at full strength.

Poland, in contrast, are on a more solid footing, despite their own defensive frailties. They arrive in Osijek with momentum, having edged out Scotland with a dramatic penalty win. Poland have shown resilience by finding the back of the net in six consecutive games, making them dangerous in attack, particularly with Robert Lewandowski leading the line. Although Croatia’s midfield duo of Luka Modric and Mateo Kovacic remains formidable, the lack of a reliable backline could expose them to Poland’s attacking threats.

Moreover, Croatia’s poor recent record suggests they may struggle to keep Poland at bay. They’ve conceded at least one goal in five of their last six outings, and with a shortage of defensive depth due to injuries, it’s difficult to see how they will prevent Poland from scoring. Given that Poland have scored three goals in their last match and have been consistent in front of goal, the likelihood of them snatching a point or more is high.

BettingTips4You.com expert Wolfgang Shotten emphasises this by stating, “Croatia’s lack of defensive cohesion, paired with Poland’s attacking prowess, makes the Draw/Poland Double Chance the standout choice here. Poland’s ability to score, coupled with Croatia’s struggles, suggests a low-risk, high-reward bet.”

Looking at the stats, Poland’s performance in the Nations League so far shows their ability to both score and concede, as evidenced by their 3-2 win over Scotland. With Croatia allowing two goals in their opener, it’s clear both teams have their weaknesses at the back. However, Poland have managed to find ways to win or draw tight matches. With Croatia’s inconsistent form and missing players, a draw or a Polish win becomes increasingly likely.

Correct Score Prediction: 1-1 Draw

Given the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, the most reasonable prediction for the final score is a 1-1 draw. Croatia have managed to score in six of their last seven matches, so finding the net against Poland should not be an issue. However, their ongoing defensive problems mean that keeping a clean sheet is improbable. Poland, buoyed by their recent attacking form, are expected to score as well. With both teams possessing strong attacking units but showing defensive frailties, a 1-1 draw reflects the balance of power in this matchup.

A draw is also consistent with the idea that both teams are not at their peak performance levels. Croatia’s defence is lacking cohesion, while Poland have struggled to keep clean sheets. Both teams to score is a logical conclusion, and a low-scoring draw fits perfectly with the tactical setup each side is likely to employ.
