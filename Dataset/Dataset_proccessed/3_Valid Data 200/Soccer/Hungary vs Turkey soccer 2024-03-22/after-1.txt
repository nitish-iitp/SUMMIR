The Hungarian national soccer team has maintained an unbeaten streak since November 17, 2022, with 12 matches played. Among these, the highlight was qualifying for the European Championship.

If they manage to avoid defeat today in their first European Championship preparation match, they will be aiming to break an old record, reported Magyar Nemzet.

The last time the national team enjoyed such a successful run was over 20 years ago, between March 2000 and April 2001, when they remained unbeaten for 12 matches. Under the coaching of Marco Rossi, the national team will face Turkey in their first 2024 preparation match on Friday.

If they maintain their winning streak, they will extend it to 13 games, surpassing the record set in the early 2000s.

Interestingly, the last team to achieve a comparable streak was the “Golden Team” (“Aranycsapat”), who won 15 of 18 games and drew three after losing the 1954 World Cup final. Their streak was halted in February 1956, when they were defeated, ominously, by the Turkish team scoring 3-1 in Istanbul.

Regarding the match between Hungary and Turkey scheduled for today (Friday, March 22) at 8:45 pm in Puskás Arena, Budapest, the game will be played in front of a full house. Therefore, the fan information page of the Hungarian Football Association advises spectators to arrive at the venue at least one and a half hours before kick-off and to utilize public transportation.
