Travis Head's unbeaten hundred completes Australia fightback after spinners star

Dwarshuis injured on debut but Labuschagne leads fightback with ball then bat

Australia 317 for 3 (Head 154*, Labuschagne 77*) beat England 315 (Duckett 95, Labuschagne 3-39, Zampa 3-49) by seven wickets

It was a tale of two unconventional opening batters at Trent Bridge, both aggressive left-handers, both with a love of placing bat on ball, especially through anything remotely off-line or length. But where Ben Duckett's innings ended tamely, on 95 from 91 balls, to open the door for a spirited Australia fightback, Travis Head's powered onwards and upwards, to 154 not out from 129, and ultimately to a seven-wicket victory in the first ODI.

That converted century, Head's sixth in 66 ODIs and his second against England, was the fundamental reason why Australia overcame the odds, including a sickness bug that robbed them of a swathe of key names, not least Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc - two of the "big three" (alongside the absent Pat Cummins) without any of whose presence Australia had lost each of their last eight completed ODIs against England.

The other reason was the resilience of their makeshift attack, stretched to eight personnel including four spinners once Ben Dwarshuis - fresh from bowling Phil Salt on his international debut - had been forced to leave the field after just four overs with a strained pectoral muscle.

At the scene of their then-record pummelling in 2018, and with Duckett and Will Jacks proving once again what an invitingly flat pitch Trent Bridge can be, Australia had been bracing themselves for another huge chase at 213 for 2 in the 33rd over.

But then, up popped the lesser-spotted legbreaks of Marnus Labuschagne, whose haul of 3 for 39 in six overs not only included the key scalps of Duckett and Harry Brook, both to looping return catches, but also lit a fire under Australia's premier leggie Adam Zampa, who responded to a leaky first three overs with final figures of 3 for 49.

Matthew Short's offspin also returned a maiden ODI wicket, and when Head served notice that this contest now belonged to him, by picking up Jacob Bethell and Adil Rashid with consecutive deliveries, England had been bowled out for 315 in a dramatic collapse of 8 for 102 in 17.1 overs. In total, Australia's spinners claimed 9 for 190 in 30.4: it was a combined impact that England's own spin cohort, led by Adil Rashid - who remains one wicket shy of 200 in ODIs - couldn't come close to matching.

Labuschagne, like Head, was only just warming up in that phase of the game. After arriving almost slap-bang in the middle of Australia's chase, at 169 for 3 in the 27th over after Cameron Green had become Bethell's maiden ODI wicket, there was almost no one better equipped to act as a foil to the now free-flowing Head. His pitch-perfect innings of 77 not out from 61 balls included the winning boundary off Jacks with a full six overs left unused, to cap an unbroken fourth-wicket stand of 148 from 107 balls.

This was the de facto reboot of England's ODI fortunes, after their destruction at the 2023 World Cup and leaving aside a barely remembered campaign in the Caribbean in December. A new-look team, led for the first time by Brook, showed promise in patches, not least during Duckett and Jack's 120-run stand for the second wicket from exactly 100 balls. But even while the going was good in the first half of their innings, Eoin Morgan in the Sky commentary box considered their approach to be no better than "measured", the sort of damningly faint praise that suggested they ran the risk of being mown down by a more emphatic performance.

So it proved, with Australia outgunning England by 10 sixes to eight, five from Head, and three from Steve Smith in a notably aggressive cameo at the top of the order. After the early loss of Mitchell Marsh, Smith's commitment to attack pushed his team ahead of the rate at 69 for 1 after the powerplay, and allowed Head, with a run-a-ball fifty, to settle in for the longer haul.

Head had a moment of fortune on 6, when Brydon Carse - in from the boundary at deep point - all but clawed down a replica of Ben Stokes' "you cannot do that" epic from the 2019 World Cup. But the feature of Head's early innings was a fascinating duel with Jofra Archer, making his first ODI appearance in 18 months. Armed with the new ball, Archer bowled a handful of unplayable deliveries, including a cutter that left Head wide-eyed with wonder, but he was also picked off for 53 runs in six overs, including a fabulous flick for six off the toes that obliged him to return the look of incredulity.

For England, it was a case of what-might-have-been, not least for Duckett, whose self-admonishment was plain as day after he gave away an international century for the second time this month, after his 86 in the Oval Test against Sri Lanka.

In his first opportunity to reprise that now-familiar opener's role in ODIs, Duckett took particular toll of a nervy Sean Abbott, clubbing four fours in an over en route to a 49-ball fifty, meaning that Marsh was already searching for alternate bowlers, even before it had been confirmed that Dwarshuis had strained a pectoral muscle with an off-balance shy from the outfield.

Zampa had been the scourge of England's batting in their most recent ODI encounter, claiming 3 for 21 at Ahmedabad in the 2023 World Cup. However, Jacks thumped his second ball back over his head for six, and as the hundred stand came up in 86 balls, he'd leaked 27 runs in his first three-over foray by the end of the 19th.

In his 100th ODI, however, Zampa couldn't be kept out of the action for long, as Jacks drove on the up to cover, but by the time Brook had stepped into two superbly poised drives over cover for six off Short's part-timers, England were ominously placed on 201 for 2 after 30 overs.

Enter Labuschagne, for what seemed to be a speculative spell of legbreaks. However, his impact was that of a perfectly deployed secret weapon. With the fourth ball of his spell, he landed a googly that stuck just enough in the pitch to confound Duckett's back-foot push, and he reached to his left to pluck the simplest of caught-and-bowleds. One over later, out came that googly again, and Brook this popped another mistimed push straight back to the bowler.

Jamie Smith came and went for 23, caught in the deep two balls after Aaron Hardie at deep midwicket had been forced to sacrifice a chance in order to save the boundary, and at 256 for 5, England's hopes of a 350-plus innings were back in the hands of their main men from the T20I series, Liam Livingstone and Bethell, who was making his second format debut of the week.

Zampa, however, still had three overs up his sleeve, and no sooner had he returned to the attack, Livingstone chose to take him down. It was a suboptimal option. A huge thrash through the line skewed to Green at long-on, and the rest came meekly. Far too meekly, as it turned out.
