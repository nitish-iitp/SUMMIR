That's it for today, though. England's World Cup is over.

We'll always have Lord's, Stokes, Jofra and the super over.

Bye for now.

I think it is a misconception when you hear how softly Jos Buttler speaks because underneath that he is fiercely competitive and he'll be so disappointed.

They'll have come here with great hope of doing something special and defending that title.

But the way have exited the tournament, even with a much better performance today, they will go home with a huge tinge of disappointment that they didn't give a fantastic account of themselves.

Deep down he will be hurting and will take that to heart but that will give him motivation to push on and hopefully propel this team to better things.

'We made mistakes in our bowling, fielding and batting'

Pakistan captain Babar Azam: "Very disappointing with the performance of my team, all the players.

"We are trying our best but unfortunately we had a couple of loose games. After the three games we got some momentum and if we had won the South Africa match, I think it would have been a different story.

"But we made mistakes in our bowling, fielding and batting.

"After the first 10 or 15 overs, we bowled a few loose deliveries and with the spinners, the main thing is that we are not taking wickets."

On lack of wickets for the spinners: "That has a big effect because you need wickets in the middle overs. If your spinners don't take wickets then you have to rely on your fast bowlers. But the margin of error is very small."

On if the side needs refreshing: "We'll sit together and let's see. We take a lot of positives from the last six weeks and we will discuss our mistakes also.

"I will try my best to pitch in with my experience."

More from David Willey on his England retirement: "Did I think I would play this many games for England? Not not at all. I think if I look about my academy times and growing up I was never the best player. I have found a way with my resilience to keep chipping away to be part of this group, which is just an incredible group of white ball cricketers. I am immensely proud of that and every game I've played.

"I have been fortunate to have such a great support network round me to pick me up when I've been down. My wife back home will be watching. She has picked me up many a time so a massive thank to her. I am proud every time I have pulled on this shirt and sung that national anthem.

"That T20 World Cup win Australia was one of my favourite moments. I had my family there, my kids running around in the confetti. That was special after the disappointment of 2019, when I felt out of love with the game and found my back into the side. I think every time you go out there and take a wicket it's special."

England all-rounder Ben Stokes on Sky Sports: "People will be frustrated and a bit flabbergasted at the way things have gone. If anyone knows why things have gone how they have gone, they would be a genius. It's something we have to get over, because there's always something to play for. You're only as good as your next game.

"We've struggled to put in consistent performances. We've not kept our foot on the throat.

"Success is brilliant, but failure can be an unbelievable thing to give young players experience. Failures can take you to the next level.

"A reset might be a bit strong. When you like a players England have available, it is very exciting. In terms of this group, it's a decision not up to me. Everyone knows the class this dressing room has.

On his own future: "The reason I stepped away was through workload. I'm Test captain and there's a lot I want to do with that team. It's something I'll have to think about quite hard."

England captain Jos Buttler: "It's nice to put in a good performance. It probably sinks in more right now. There's lots to reflect on.

"We got off to a really good start. The guys in the middle set it up brilliantly for the end. That's what we know we're capable of.

"We should have been able to cope without Ben when he was injured. Lots of us haven't performed in the way we wanted to. We should have been good enough to deal with that.

"The World Cup as a whole has been a disappointment. Wherever we go from here, today was a good day.

"David Willey has been fantastic. He always finds a way. he's got great skills and is proper competitor. He'll be properly missed in the dressing room.

"It's not going to be a drastic change of playing style, like 2015. We know where we need to go. That doesn't mean a huge clearout, it's just pushing on from here."

You looked at the squad that was picked and, on the surface, there weren't too many people who you felt should be in that were outside of the 15.

That suggests that, more or less, you've got the best players that are available to you. But it was quite contentious to leave Jason Roy on the eve of the tournament.

I think that was quite destabilising. The contract stuff was quite destabilising. At that stage it was almost like they were after a good news story in the middle of the carnage.

The thing I will look back on is that they didn't play like England. In the games they got hammered, they didn't play like England. That is what is frustrating.

Player of the match David Willey: "Obviously the tournament hasn't gone to plan for us as a whole which is a real disappointment. Obviously it would have been nice to go out on a high but for me personally to perform and enjoy the last few games, get to 100 wickets is special for me. It was a nice way to finish. It would have been have that and to make a final as well, but it's a small win.

"I think you only have to look around the dressing room. We have a phenomenal group of players with massive talent. We have underperformed here which is disappointing. We should have done better.

"Did the contract situation motivate me? Yes. I think Keysy [Rob Key] said 'I hope you can prove me wrong' so maybe I have done it over the last few games. People might have frowned upon the timing there, but for me personally there's not many opportunities to walk away from cricket on your terms. I wanted to enjoy my last three games and not be looking over my shoulder thinking one bad performance I'd be out the side."

England will be deeply disappointed. In the last two games they've played the way they wanted to for the rest of the tournament.

Aggressive with the bat, imposing, and then looking to take wickets with the ball. They've executed that in the last couple of games and there will be an element of frustration when they're looking back at the entirely of this campaign that it took them so long to do that.

There is going to be an inquisition and questions about selection decisions and how they move this forward now and how they make sure the last eight years of amazing stuff is not wasted.

Mixed emotions today, a nice way to finish a World Cup that has been vastly disappointing.

England will finish seventh in the table with three wins. Pakistan are fifth, just two points off the top four. That's a second successive fifth-placed finish at a World Cup for Pakistan.

Jos Buttler just stood on his own for a while on the boundary edge after shaking hands.

Ben Stokes then came up to him, put an arm around his shoulder and then gave him a few big pats on the back.

Whatever you say about how England played when it mattered in this tournament, they have not fallen apart like they could have.

They deserve credit for that.

There are some smiling faces out there as David Willey leads them off. He missed out in 2019 after doing so much of the hard work in dragging England up the rankings in the years before.

He was an integral part of that. He's getting a lot of slaps on the back from the Pakistan players as well.

Good to see, that's a proper farewell.

I think a lot of England fans will find this result annoying. They’ve shown what they are capable of. Where has this England been?

The cameras are on Willey as he shakes hands withy all of the Pakistan players and staff, most who have a nice word for him. England have reached the Champions Trophy. Not really a prize they were expecting to have to fight for at the beginning of this tournament.

A pretty disastrous campaign at least ends with two victories.

They'll go home disappointed at how this tournament has gone, how they've fared. The recriminations will start tomorrow when managing director Rob Key holds a press conference.

This rather weary group of players have not been remotely happy about the way they've played. To a man, they've been devastated about how this campaign has been played.

Oh, miles high. This time there's a fielder under it, Ben Stokes with probably the safest hands in the England team. Haris Rauf is disappointed, he wanted a few more. England win their final game but both teams head out. David Willey is getting congratulations from players on both sides.
