9.40pm After suffering back-to-back losses in this World Cup, Australia get their campaign up and running with a victory over Sri Lanka in Lucknow. As for Sri Lanka, they slip to their third successive defeat in the tournament. Zampa and captain Cummins did the damage with the ball in the middle overs before Inglis and Labuschagne did the job with the bat in the middle overs in Australia's chase of 210. Marsh also contributed to the win, with 52 off 51 at the top. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we did bringing it to you. Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Madushka Balasuriya, Venkat Raghav and Chandan Duorah. Goodbye and good night.

Zampa, Player of the Match: To be honest, did not feel great. Been sporting a back spasm for a couple of days but maybe bowled better [today]. I think that was the captain's decision to bowl the offspinner to the lefties...Personally, I couldn't bowl better in the last game and to be honest, I feel I can do better but good to be at the better end of the result tonight. Again, I didn't feel at my best but want to try and keep my wicket-taking attitude. We have a big game against Pakistan in Bangalore; that's going to be a tough one.

Mendis: Pathum and KP batted well for the opening partnership but after that the middle order struggled. If we scored 290-300, it would have been good on this pitch. I think we didn't rotate the strike enough and played more dots. I think the last two games we batted, but today we struggled a bit and we have six more matches to perform better. I have confidence in my batting unit. I think Madushanka bowled really well and got two early wickets. I hope Dasun and Matheesha recover quickly.

Cummins: Yeah, happy today. It was probably that nothing was said and it was just on the back of two losses...The energy in the field was nice to start with and everything else flowed. Again, they started really well but the way all the bowlers came in, hit the wicket, and did their job, it was a great effort. I can't read these wickets. About 300 [would've been par] maybe. Outside noise doesn't bother us too much. I hope so, all parts of the game came together at the end. We're sort of underway in the tournament and hope we keep it up.

Mitch Marsh speaks to Star Sports: It was a really good day for us. We came into the game with a little bit of pressure after the slow start, but our experienced guys stood up today. We're away. I wouldn't say soul-searching but there was plenty of hurt [after the loss to South Africa]. Hopefully, that's a stepping stone for us in the right direction. Just making up for his [dad's] strike rate. I felt like I was batting well tonight and I probably got ahead of myself (on the run-out). The boys were calm and the way we finished it off was great. I actually went for one over, but I was shut down. We have a heap of options - three quicks, Zampa, Maxwell, Stoin and myself. He [Cummins] always has a calm demeanor. The way he bowled and his bowling changes were fantastic. Inglis is a fighter and loves a contest. He plays spin well and backs his skills. First of all, he has power and hopefully it's the start of a long career for him.

Wellalage to Stoinis, SIX runs

Stoinis creates swinging room and launches a mighty six over long-on! Pushed through too full on middle, Stoinis backs away and pumps it down the ground. Lucknow's Super Giant finishes it off for Australia at the Ekana Stadium

Harin Bansal: "I don't understand why we are expecting so much from Hasaranga. He isn't a great bowler in ODIs. Look at his record. All the 5-fers, or 6-ers have against minnows during WC Qualifiers. Otherwise, he doesn't have much to show in ODIs"

4
Wellalage to Stoinis, FOUR runs

Steps back and carves it through point. There's a man there, he dives to his right, but he can't get to it. That's how powerfully he hits the ball. The fielder didn't really have a lot of distance to cover but he had no time

33.5
•
Wellalage to Stoinis, no run

Appeal for lbw, but Stoinis has a big front foot stride and it's well outside the line of off stump as he goes for the sweep

33.4
•
Wellalage to Stoinis, no run

Goes back to a slider on middle and leg and doesn't really make contact with the ball.

33.3
2
Wellalage to Stoinis, 2 runs

Backs away to the flatter delivery angling into leg stump - which he may have expected - and lashes it through extra cover

33.2
4
Wellalage to Stoinis, FOUR runs

Powerful slog sweep. As soon as he sees there's room to free the arms, he goes for the shot and he does not hold back. Stoinis smashes spin. And he lives up to that reputation here

33.1
W
Wellalage to Inglis, OUT

Taken at point after a juggle. Inglis looks to carve a ball that doesn't really come onto him. Lovely work from Wellalage. He made sure there was no pace on it and Inglis was desperate for some. So much so he ends up losing balance, his eagerness to go at the ball making him meet it out in front of his body and the drive he aims over cover ends up much squarer, in Theekshana's hands. Good innings from Inglis though.

Madushanka to Maxwell, no run

No room again, and this time it's the change of pace, so Maxwell looking to cut only ends up with an inside edge

Sameer Okaz: "So Australia winning this one and we might see a thrillerrr on Friday, A confident Australia vs wounded (UNPREDICTABLE) Pakistan..Woah!"

Madushanka to Maxwell, no run

Looks to heave the length ball angling into the righ-hander, but makes no contact

AB: "Maxwell is saving his legs. All his runs have come in boundaries...Waoww"

Madushanka to Inglis, 1 run

Backs away from a bouncer so he can ramp it away towards the boundary at third, Madushanka's face tells a story as he watches Kumara back away from the catch in order to protect the boundary.

32.3

Madushanka to Maxwell, 1 run

Swings hard at a back of a length ball, once again throwing that front leg aside to get the room he wants. Mis-hits through midwicket

Madushanka to Maxwell, no run

Targets the pads, Maxwell was looking to clear the front leg and launch, but suddenly he found no room to free the arms
