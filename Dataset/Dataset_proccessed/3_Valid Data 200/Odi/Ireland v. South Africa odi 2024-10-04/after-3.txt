IRE vs SA, 2nd ODI, LIVE Scores and Updates: Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the 2nd ODI between Ireland and South Africa taking place at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi today!

South Africa won the toss and opted to bat first.

Captain’s Comments:

Paul Stirling (IRE): Maybe start well as we did yesterday and hopefully, we can have a better peformance as the game goes on. The scoreline seems to be a bit harsh, we were more in the game. Not getting a big partnership put us into trouble. There were really good balls but if we can negate them for longer phases, we will do well.

Temba Bavuma (SA): Same as the last game, we will bat first. The wicket looks good and it looks a bit on the drier side. It did, there was more off the wicket, the bowlers were able to hit the stumps. It did quicken up as well, seemed challenging for the batters. Extra pace under the lights assisted our bowlers. Tony is recovering, he is resting tonight. Verreynne is playing today.

Playing XIs:

Ireland: Andrew Balbirnie, Paul Stirling(c), Curtis Campher, Harry Tector, Stephen Doheny(w), George Dockrell, Mark Adair, Andy McBrine, Gavin Hoey, Graham Hume, Craig Young

South Africa: Ryan Rickelton(w), Temba Bavuma(c), Rassie van der Dussen, Tristan Stubbs, Kyle Verreynne, Wiaan Mulder, Andile Phehlukwayo, Bjorn Fortuin, Lizaad Williams, Lungi Ngidi, Ottneil Baartman

We are back for Ireland’s reply. If they chase 344 runs down, it will be a record chase on this venue. South African players then stride out and take the field. Followed by Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie who walk out to open for Ireland. Lungi Ngidi to start with the new ball.

… The Run Chase …

Ireland’s bowling unit put in a collective effort, with four bowlers chipping in with a wicket each to keep South Africa’s momentum in check at various stages. Although, it wasn’t enough to put a half on the run rate of Proteas. Now though with a daunting target of 344 ahead, Ireland will need a strong start from their top order to set the tone. The likes of Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie will be key in providing a solid foundation. They do have the quality, but need to be smart in their approach. Do join us shortly for the second essay to find out how things pan out.

Kyle Verreynne is in for a quick word. He reflected on the team’s recent form, emphasizing how the tough series against Afghanistan pushed them to reform their approach as a batting unit. He mentioned that the wicket played a bit slower, which led them to focus on using the square boundaries effectively with flicks and punches. He stressed the importance of maintaining a positive mindset and focusing on securing the win. With 343 on the board, he believes it’s a strong total and that the team’s goal is to finish the game with a convincing margin.

The real game-changer, though, was Tristan Stubbs. Having shown promise in the first ODI, he elevated his performance with a sensational unbeaten 112 off 81 balls, his first ODI ton. He received strong support from Wiaan Mulder, who chipped in with 43 valuable runs in the death overs. South Africa scored 61 runs in the final 5 overs. Now, South Africa head into the break with a commanding total, leaving Ireland with a steep chase ahead.

After electing to bat first, South Africa got off to a strong start with Ryan Rickelton and Temba Bavuma looking solid against the new ball. The duo built a steady platform, but just as things were shaping up, Bavuma had to retire hurt due to an injury. Ireland seized the opportunity when Campher removed Rickelton, bringing them back into the contest. However, that glimmer of hope quickly dimmed when Rassie van der Dussen and Kyle Verreynne combined for a crucial partnership of 58 runs. Verreynne, impressing in his return to the side, notched up a half-century, though van der Dussen couldn’t capitalize on his start.

Hats off to Tristan Stubbs, what a sensational knock from the youngster. The 24-year old lad is making a loud announcement in the 50-over format. South Africa have posted a huge target in this contest, and would be confident heading back into the break. Ireland just found it a bit difficult to create wicket-taking opportuinities in the middle phase, which might’ve taken the game away from them. This wicket though is very batting-friendly. Ireland would still believe they can pull a rabbit out of the hat here.
