The BCCI has cleared the air about Team India donning an alternate match kit for the World Cup match against Pakistan at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

After kickstarting its ICC World Cup 2023 campaign against five-time champions Australia, hosts Team India led by Rohit Sharma will meet Afghanistan and arch-rivals Pakistan in the round-robin stage of the showpiece event. India's blockbuster match against arch-rivals Pakistan will be contested at the famous Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday. In the lead-up to the mouthwatering clash between the traditional rivals, Team India was in speculation about wearing an orange/saffron jersey for match No.12 of the ICC World Cup.

India sported an alternate kit for the 2019 edition of the ICC World Cup in England and Wales. The Men In Blue were also seen sporting an orange training jersey in the build-up to India's World Cup 2023 opener against Australia in Chennai. Will India be wearing an alternate jersey in the World Cup 2023? The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has quashed the media reports ahead of the Indo-Pak encounter in Ahmedabad.
