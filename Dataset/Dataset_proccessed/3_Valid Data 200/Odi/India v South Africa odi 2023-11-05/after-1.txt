Virat Kohli marked his 35th birthday with his second century of the World Cup as India thumped South Africa by 243 runs at Eden Gardens to maintain their 100% record in the group stage.

Sunday’s contest featuring the top two teams in the tournament so far proved to be anything but, with Ravindra Jadeja claiming five wickets as South Africa were skittled for 83 runs in 27.1 overs, pursuing an imposing target of 327 to win.

After India made 326-5, the Proteas’ chase began disastrously, as they lost half their side for 40 runs inside 14 overs. Jadeja (5-33) and Mohammed Shami (2-18) wreaked havoc while Mohammed Siraj (1-11) and Kuldeep Yadav (2-7) also played their part in the big win.

Like their opponents, South Africa had already secured their semi-final place but will gain little confidence for the knockout stages. Marco Jansen emerged as their highest scorer with 14 runs, having been hit for 94 runs in nine overs by India’s batters.

Earlier, Kohli’s unbeaten 101 had put the hosts in charge and moved him level with fellow Indian great Sachin Tendulkar on 49 one-day international hundreds. Kohli also took his tally past 500 runs in the tournament, dropping anchor in a solid third-wicket stand of 134 with Shreyas Iyer, who hit 77 with seven fours and two sixes.

Kohli made sure of his ton in the 49th over as India finished with 326-5 on a slow Kolkata wicket, thanks to late hitting by Jadeja (29 not out). After electing to bat first, India made a blazing start before Rohit Sharma fell for a 24-ball 40 as he looked to launch first-change Kagiso Rabada over mid-off.

After reaching 91-1 in the powerplay, the hosts lost opener Shubman Gill (23) to an unplayable delivery from Keshav Maharaj in the 11th over. It took another 26 overs for the next wicket to fall, with Shreyas dismissed by Lungi Ngidi, who suffered an apparent hamstring injury later on to compound South Africa’s dismal day.
