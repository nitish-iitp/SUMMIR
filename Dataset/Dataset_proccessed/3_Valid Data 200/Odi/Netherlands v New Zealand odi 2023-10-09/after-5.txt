Thanks for your company today. It's been lovely covering this game. Action comes thick and fast in the World Cup. There's a double-header tomorrow, with England taking on Bangladesh in the morning game, and then Pakistan will try to seek revenge after their narrow Asia Cup defeat against Sri Lanka in the afternoon match. For now, it's time for me, Rvel Zahid, to say goodbye on behalf of Himanshu Agrawal and our scoring team. Sayonara!

Here's the match report that covers all the major events of the day Top-order batters, five-star Santner make it two in two for New Zealand

Netherlands ran out of gas against a quality bowling line-up. They suffer a heavy defeat, but their quest to search for their first win in the World Cup will continue. Ackermann emerged as the top-scorer with 69, but he didn't get much support from his teammates. Santner proved to be the chief tormenter, picking up a sensational fifer, while Henry chipped in with three wickets, and Ravindra continues to evolve as a fantastic all-rounder, bowled a very economical spell. For Netherlands, it's about learning from each game and making amends. They showed promise in patches; the spinners bowled well, but they lost control in the final few death overs. As long as they maintain their spirit and intrinsic motivation, they will certainly pose more challenges to the more experienced and established sides in this World Cup

Scott Edwards: New Zealand have got a quality bowling attack. You are not going to chase down 320 with 40s and 50s...we needed to bigger partnerships. We will speak about that with the boys. There's definitely going to be some positives; we need to rectify our errors in the next seven games. For us, it's another game and we'll play our best game and try to win (on next game)

Tom Latham: I think we did a great job with the bat, built partnerships and put up a great score. Any time in the middle is valuable, partnership after partnership allowed us put good runs on the board. (fifth bowling option Ravindra) the guys have bowled beautifully, we made sure they don't bowl too many overs and I was proactive with the changes...spinners were outstanding and the big boys did a great job upfront and squeezed them...great to see him (Lockie Ferguson) back. It's about adapting as quickly as possible and acclimatize to the weather (in Chennai).

Richard: "A C Smith kept wicket for England at the start of his career. He ended it as a swing bowler. I was at the match with 3 test wicketkeepers on the field (Smith, Kanhai, Murray), and someone else (Jameson) keeping wicket!"

Mustafa Moudi: "Though the Australia side doesnt looks settle but they have high chances of making it to the top 4 due to a favourable scheduling. Their last 2 matches are against Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Unless there is any upsets, they can win both of them by the required NRR and easily make it to the Semi-Finals !!"

Henry to Engelbrecht, OUT

Prompts an error! Banged in short and he doesn't need any second invitation, he goes for the pull but the ball grew on him and he hasn't got the elevation, Conway at deep square charges in and pockets the catch low down. Netherlands in complete disarray here
