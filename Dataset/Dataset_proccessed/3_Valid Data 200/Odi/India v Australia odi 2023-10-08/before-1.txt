Australia captain Pat Cummins said he was optimistic about his side’s performance in Indian conditions as the team tries to reclaim the ODI World Cup crown and add to its record of five titles.

“It feels like we’ve got plenty of game-time coming into the World Cup. We had ODIs in South Africa, India, and the warm-up games,” said Cummins during an event hosted by Carrera Eyewear here on Thursday.
