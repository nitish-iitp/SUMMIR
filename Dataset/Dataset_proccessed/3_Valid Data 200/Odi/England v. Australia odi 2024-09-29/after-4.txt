Australia win by 49 runs (DLS) and win the series 3-2

Mother Nature has beaten Mother Cricket, and Australia have beaten England to win the ODI series. It was an odd game, played with half an eye on the weather, but in the end Australia were emphatic winners.

Their spinners squeezed the life out of England, who slipped from 202 for 2 in the 25th over to 260 for 8 and then 309 all out. Travis Head took four wickets, then got Australia off to a flyer alongside Matthew Short. It soon become apparent that only rain could save England; it arrived five balls too late with Australia well ahead on DLS.

It’s still hammering down, so my advice is to follow one of the other 48 live blogs we have on the go. There’s very little chance of any more play at Bristol.

Rain stops play

20.4 overs: Australia 165-2 (Smith 36, Inglis 28) Adil Rashid returns to the attack and is pulled for four by Smith when he drops short. England have been hammered, which looked unlikely when Harry Brook was smashing Adam Zampa for six sixes in nine balls earlier in the day.

The rain has arrived, five balls too late for England, and that will probably be it for the day. It’s good that Australia got to 20 overs as they thoroughly deserve to win this game. England’s attempt to waste time was shabby but at least they didn’t stoop too low.

Australia lead by 45 runs on DLS

20th over: Australia 158-2 (Smith 31, Inglis 27) England have lacked concentration and intensity in the field, and I suspect they thought this game would be rained off.

Inglis hits Carse for successive sixes, a smooth pull and a top-edged hook over fine leg. We now have a game, whatever happens with the weather, and England need probably three wickets before it rains. Might as well get the slips in.

29 Sept 2024
11.22 EDT

19th over: Australia 144-2 (Smith 30, Inglis 14) Olly Stone returns to the attack and is belted for a couple of boundaries by Inglis. Australia are nearly there now; barring something biblical, the umpires will surely complete the 20th over before taking the players off.

18th over: Australia 133-2 (Smith 29, Inglis 4) Potts manfully completes the over. Maybe I’m being harsh and it was a genuine injury. Maybe.

29 Sept 2024
11.16 EDT

17.4 overs: Australia 133-2 (Smith 29, Inglis 4) Potts replaces Rashid, either to slow the game down or because Potts is more likely to dismiss Smith. He was sitting on Rashid fairly comfortably.

The forecast for this evening is abysmal, so once the players go off there is almost no chance of any more play.

Potts calls for a change of boot after four balls. Nah, come on, this is really poor from England. They’ve spent the last few years atop the moral high ground so it’s not a great look to stoop to this nonsense in an attempt to save a bilateral ODI series.

“We’ve seen this movie before…” says Ricky Ponting on Sky, referring to the Cardiff Test of 2009.

Play is about to resume. England need two wickets in the next three overs to be ahead on DLS.

29 Sept 2024
11.10 EDT

17th over: Australia 132-2 (Smith 28, Inglis 4) Smith emerges from his bunker to pick Carse up over backward square leg for six. That’s a brilliant stroke, although with time running out – the groundstaff are poised – it might be better to push every delivery straight back to the bowler.

And now, with rain imminent and Australia three overs away from victory, it’s time for a drinks break. Regulations 1-0 Commonsense.

29 Sept 2024
11.05 EDT

16th over: Australia 125-2 (Smith 21, Inglis 4) No sign of England trying to slow the game down. Rashid hasn’t played Test cricket for a while but this is essentially a mini Test match, with Smith focussing almost entireley on survival. Two singles from the over.

Share
29 Sept 2024
11.03 EDT

15th over: Australia 123-2 (Smith 20, Inglis 3) Carse, on for Potts, rushes one past Inglis’s attempted forcing shot. Hang on, he nicked it! England barely appealed and didn’t even discuss a review. Oh well.

One run from the over. Smith has gone into defensive mode, knowing Australia will win if we get to 20 overs and they are only two wickets down.

Share
29 Sept 2024
10.59 EDT

14th over: Australia 122-2 (Smith 20, Inglis 2) Four singles from Rashid’s over. More importantly for Australia, it only took two or three minutes; they’re now six overs away from a series win.

Share
29 Sept 2024
10.57 EDT

13th over: Australia 118-2 (Smith 18, Inglis 0) I think the rain is going to have the final word but England will be back in the game if they can take two more quick wickets. If Australia are four down after 20 overs the DLS par score will be 158.

WICKET! Australia 118-2 (Short c Smith b Potts 54)

Well bowled Matthew Potts. Short had punched the previous ball for four, a terrific stroke through extra cover, and tried to repeat the shot. Potts found just enough seam movement to take a thin edge through to Jamie Smith.

12th over: Australia 113-1 (Short 54, Smith 17) Adil Rashid, England’s likeliest source of wickets on this pitch, comes into the attack. I know he doesn’t like bowling in the Powerplay but in this unique situation England sure missed a trick by holding him back.

Anyway, here he is. He starts with a teasing legbreak that turns sharply to beat Short, who looks nowhere near as comfortable against spin. A fine over – only two from it – ends with Short inside-edging safely on the leg side.

Share
29 Sept 2024
10.48 EDT

11th over: Australia 111-1 (Short 53, Smith 16) Carse replaces Stone and is smoked over midwicket for six by Short. That takes him to a blistering 23-ball fifty, facilitated by some, a-hem, imperfect bowling from England.

The rest of Carse’s over is good, with two runs from the other five deliveries. The problem is that Australia are around 50 ahead of the DLS par score, so England need wickets plural.

From Cricbuzz - most runs as captain in a bilateral ODI series vs Australia:

312 - Harry Brook (England, 2024)
310 - Virat Kohli (India, 2019)
285 - MS Dhoni (India, 2009)
278 - Eoin Morgan (England, 2015)
276 - Babar Azam (Pakistan, 2022)

10th over: Australia 103-1 (Short 46, Smith 15) Smith drives Potts wide of mid-off for four. It was in the air for a while but expertly placed.

Potts has troubled Smith in this series, though, and he nips another one back to hit Smith high on the leg. Short ends the over with a clip to fine leg for four: Australia have scored 103 in the Powerplay.

REVIEW! Australia 93-1 (Smith not out 10)

Potts has changed ends to replace Carse, which is a bit of a strange decision. And a brilliant one: Potts has struck first ball! Smith played all around a full delivery that came back off the seam to hit him in front.

Smith reviews the decision - and replays show the ball would have missed leg stump! Turns out it did too much off the seam, even from such a full length.

9th over: Australia 93-1 (Short 42, Smith 10) Olly Stone starts a new spell with a loosener that Smith cuts easily for four. Short fresh-airs an attempted pull before chipping mid-off for four. It teased Brook but eventually cleared him fairly comfortably.

Share

10.34 EDT

The latest forecast is for the rain to begin in 40 minutes. Then there’s around 15 minutes of light rain, then the heavy stuff. It’ll be interesting to see what England do if they are facing certain defeat and the umpires ask them to finish the game in the rain. Hopefully Harry Brook will channel his inner Keith Miller and keep the players out there.

8th over: Australia 84-1 (Short 38, Smith 5) Steve Smith is this close to dragging his first delivery back onto the stumps. His second is a wide, and he edges the third wide of slip for four. An excellent start from Carse, who has shown a lot of promise in these white-ball series.

“Watching on telly from a wet and windy morning in Manhattan (looks like similar weather to Bristol),” says Thomas Walker. “Loving this early Aussie onslaught, but is seems ridiculously easy to reach the boundary on this ground; is it actually that small? How does it compare to other fields around the world? I’m intentionally not calling it a ‘stadium’ because it literally looks like someone’s backyard.”

Vic Marks was saying on TMS earlier that the playing area is much smaller than it was in his day. I think the straight boundaries are particularly short.

WICKET! Australia 78-1 (Head c Salt b Carse 31)

Travis Head slaps Brydon Carse’s first ball straight to cover. It was a slightly odd shot, a flamboyant back-foot drive that was never likely to clear Phil Salt. That’s an important wicket for England, partly because it’s Head and also because it will increase Australia’s DLS target if we get 20 overs.

7th over: Australia 78-0 (Short 38, Head 32) A chance goes begging. Short, trying to hoick Potts over midwicket, sliced the ball miles in the air towards Rashid at short third man. The ball swirled horribly in the breeze and Rashid couldn’t lay a hand on it. To compound his misery, it bounced up to hit him flush in the coupon.

Short edges a boundary wide of Rashid before pulling flat and hard for six. It’s brilliant batting but I’ve no idea why England keep feeding his favourite shot.

“Silly question to ask given the anti-draw Bazball philosophy,” begins David Howell, “but could England plausibly speed up/slow down the over rate to increase/decrease the chances of getting to 20 overs based on who would win? Because it really could be that marginal from the radar forecast I’m seeing...”

Both teams could if they wanted, yeah, but I don’t think they will. It might be different if it was a World Cup final.

10.22 EDT

6th over: Australia 66-0 (Short 27, Head 31) Harry Brook gambles by introducing Will Jacks in the Powerplay. It doesn’t quite pay off: Head has hammered him for 20 runs. He drove four through extra cover, blasted six over mid-off and then pulled another over mid-on. A withering cut for four completed the marmalisation.

Share
29 Sept 2024
10.17 EDT

5th over: Australia 46-0 (Short 27, Head 11) Six more to Short, slugged over square leg and out of the ground off the bowling of Potts. He is such a good puller, so goodness knows why England are feeding him. Potts does it again next ball and is dragged through midwicket for four more.

Potts adjusts his length after that and is a bit unfortunate when Short thick-edges another boundary. He has 27 from 13 balls and Australia have belted 30 from the last two overs.

Share
29 Sept 2024
10.14 EDT

4th over: Australia 32-0 (Short 13, Head 11) Olly Stone’s second over disappears for 16. Head clipped him to fine leg for four, then Short pummelled consecutive short balls for four through the covers and six over midwicket.

The forecast has improved slightly, so it’ll be touch and go whether they get 20 overs in.

Share
29 Sept 2024
10.10 EDT

3rd over: Australia 16-0 (Short 2, Head 7) Potts goes around the wicket in an attempt to cramp Head for room. He does it very well at first, then errs and is punished with four leg-byes. After scoring two from his first 12 balls – I know – Head times an excellent first boundary past backward point.

Share
29 Sept 2024
10.05 EDT

2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Short 2, Head 2) Stone has a strangled shout for LBW when Short pushes around a good nipbacker. Too high. England have started pretty well, with Stone, as he has all summer, bowling an excellent line.

1st over: Australia 4-0 (Short 2, Head 1) Australia’s DLS target depends on how many wickets they lose; we’ll keep you posted on that if the innings gets close to 20 overs.

Travis Head plays a couple of nice strokes in Matthew Potts’ first over without beating the infield. Three singles and a leg-bye from the over.

Thanks Tim, afternoon everyone. In the first 142 years of international cricket there was only one 2-2 draw between England and Australia, a ding-dong affair in 1972. Since then there have been two more, in the Ashes series of 2019 and 2023, and we’re facing a third at Bristol today.

If the weather forecast is correct, there won’t be enough time to bowl the 20 overs needed for a result, and I doubt even Travis Head can knock off a target of 310 in 15 overs. It’s dry in Bristol right now, so the runchase will begin at 3pm, but the apocalypse is imminent.

That was fascinating. Ben Duckett was steady, Phil Salt flamboyant and Harry Brook sensational, but the Australians have far more experience than this England side and it began to tell at the halfway mark. Steve Smith, back in his old job, gave a masterclass in managing part-time spinners on a small ground.

If England can get Travis Head early, they will have a good chance. But the most likely winner is probably the rain, followed by the Aussies. That’s it from me for another season. Thanks for your company, correspondence and thoughts on whether England should declare. Our own master, Rob Smyth, will be along soon.

WICKET! Rashid c Labuschagne b Head 36 (England 309 all out)

Rashid’s excellent innings comes to an end as Head collects his fourth wicket. He finishes with 4-28, but the last-wicket stand raised 33 and lifted England past 300. What an entertaining innings.

09.20 EDT

49th over: England 308-9 (Rashid 36, Stone 8) Smith keeps Connolly on and Rashid sees a chance. He cuts the first ball for four and whips the second for four more. The crowd give him the acclaim he deserves.

09.19 EDT

48th over: England 292-9 (Rashid 27, Stone 7) Smith turns back to his big gun, Head, but the batters do well, milking him for singles.

“England have managed to stage a tale of two innings in just the one, switching from total domination to utter capitulation,” says Colum Fordham. “Great batting from Duckett and Brook and wonderful spin bowling from Messrs Zampa. Maxwell and Head. Hope the weather permits some sort of Australian innings so we have a proper decider.

”Great idea to have a 5 match ODI series in England in September. Sheer Genius.” Colum, you’re an old friend of the OBO, but I’m not sure about that last point. A five-match series is a great idea, and even if the weather has the last word, it’s been good enough for us to enjoy a pulsating series.

47th over: England 292-9 (Rashid 25, Stone 4) Big enough to admit his mistake, Smith takes Starc off after one over and shows some faith in Cooper Connolly, the one spinner to struggle today. The batters take three singles.

Share
29 Sept 2024
09.13 EDT

46th over: England 289-9 (Rashid 24, Stone 3) A few minutes ago Smith was bullish enough to have a short leg, but now, as Maxwell bowls his last over, there’s no catcher in place. “Very defensive field,” scoffs Eoin Morgan. Maxwell concedes four runs and finishes with a thrifty 10-0-49-2.

09.09 EDT

45th over: England 285-9 (Rashid 22, Stone 1) When you have eight bowlers and there’s only one wicket left to take, you can do whatever you like at the death. Smith, reverting to orthodoxy, brings back Mitch Starc. Rashid says thanks very much, glides the first ball for four and clips another for two. Nine off the over – a glimmer of joy at last for England.
