Another what-could-have been performance from Pakistan. Australia continue their upward surge. The tournament will hit 20 games tomorrow. So, it's hotting up. A few ebbs and flows to go, let's hope there are some close games along the way. For now, it's goodbye from me, Ekanth, my report-writing co-commentator, Danyal Rasool, and our scorers, Chandan Duorah and Ranjith P.

Shalabh: "Historically ODIs have rarely been close contested. Maybe it is perpetual T20 hangover which forces to expect close contest every time."

Pat Cummins, Australia captain: That was great. Pretty tough playing here but good to get a win. Proper from the openers, it set the tone and we want to take the game on like that. The key in ODIs is to carry on. You get one breakthrough and it looks tough for the next guy. Batting for long, like our openers did, was great. Zampa has been awesome. Showed his class, he's a wicket-taker. Babar and Iftikhar were big wickets. We're coming off two wins and have a three or four-day break before the next game. Can take a couple of days off, then get into work. We've set the benchmark in the last two games and gotta keep that going.

Babar Azam, Pakistan captain: First 34 overs in the bowl and field cost us. We dropped Warner and such batters don't spare you. This is a big-scoring ground and we missed our mark. Credit to quicks and spinners for coming back in the last 15, who hit their lengths and the stumps. Message for the batters ahead of the chase was that we can do it. We've done it and the ball comes well under lights. We started well. We got small partnerships but needed big ones in the middle overs while chasing a 350+ score. Honestly, we have to get up to the mark in the first ten overs with ball and partnerships in the middle with bat.

Anjan: "Australia- 19 and Pakistan - 6, the no. of sixes determined the outcome of the match."

Karthik: "My theory about more one-sided or large defeats in this worldcup is due to removal of strike rotation when a wicket falls, this has allowed bowling teams to put pressure on new batsman straightaway."

Aqeel: "Everytime a wicket falls, I keep checking if no-ball is being checked. What's the rule? How de we know if no-ball will be checked?" The third umpire checks it

David Warner, POTM The groin is okay. Just a bit sore, all cramps at the moment. Stand with Marsh with awesome. Once we got the pace of the wicket, we tried to set it up for the incoming batters. Committing and batting my skills was pleasing. Had a good hit yesterday. It helps when you hit it off the middle, and playing on this ground as well. Marsh and I tried to bat till 35 and we thought we could go big in the back half. We need to work on going big at the end though. It's what you do as a team. Every run's valuable. Part of my DNA is running fast between the wickets. Stoinis struck with his bumpers and Cummins also went into the pitch to get the well-set Shakeel and the burgeoning 57-run stand. Pakistan have lost their last five wickets for 36 runs, which is a worrying pattern in a tournament where NRR can play a key role. But it's their bowling that'd probably hurt more.

10:07pm Another game that's not close, although it threatened to be. Imam and Shafique gave Pakistan a great start, with that 134-run opening stand, but Stoinis came in to nip them out. Zampa ensured that the batters in the middle order getting set couldn't go big. In the end, that was the difference: Australia got two hundreds and Pakistan two fifties. Wickets-wise, Zampa getting Babar out on the pull by cramping him for room was striking, as was having Rizwan pinned in front after the batter went across for the sweep.

Mz: "2019 was a very similar match, dropped catches and middle order collapse by Pakistan." Yeah, someone mentioned that earlier comment too I think

Andy C: "Surely Shaheen will get his sensible head on here and try to shepherd 20 off the last 5 rather than slog and get out?" Um...

Cummins to Shaheen Shah Afridi, OUT

Even better shot but straight to Marnus at deep midwicket. Australia win by 62 runs. It was into the pitch again, Shaheen danced down and pulled it flat again, but went straight to the fielder

Cummins to Shaheen Shah Afridi, FOUR runs

Forces a pull to cow corner. Not far from going over actually. It was a bouncer just outside off, Shaheen swatted it flat and far.

Vikram: "Just on cue, Stark strikes."

Starc to Hasan Ali, OUT

Starc's streak is alive. Hasan went across and tried to pull it fine while swivelling, ball went off the underedge to the keeper. Starc went into the pitch again and angled it in around sixth stump.

Starc to Shaheen Shah Afridi, 1 run

Short over leg, doesn't rise much but is pacy enough to induce the top edge. Goes in front of square leg

Starc to Shaheen Shah Afridi, FOUR runs

Full toss is wide at 133ks, Shaheen reaches out and carves it on one knee. Deep point runs to the left and slides a bit too early

Vysakh Vinayan: "Just heard in the comms, Starc has never gone wicketless in a World Cup match! Wow, looks like streak is ending tonight." Could but not yet. He returns now

Hazlewood is able to follow Hasan this time. The room-making leaves him with a bounce over head at 137ks, he falls over as he lunged back to let it go

Hasan's swinging hard for what it's worth. Shortish ball outside off, tries to go square on the off side. Beaten on the top edge

Zampa to Nawaz, OUT

Zampa's got his fourth, thanks to great reaction and deception! He pulled the length back and darted it at 97ks outside off after seeing Nawaz charge. The batter tried to push it to cover after being unable to get to the line. He got beat on the outside edge and Inglis did the rest.

Zampa to Shaheen Shah Afridi, 1 bye

Beats pretty much everything, goes to short 45. Slow googly at the stumps, Shaheen made room and tried to lump it straight. Missed it and it went over the stumps and off the keeper's gloves

Graham : "Hard to believe how much better Australia look now than they did in their first 2 games."
