ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES – Ireland Men ended their ODI series against South Africa Men in style on Monday, claiming a 69-run victory in Abu Dhabi with 23 balls to spare.

Ireland had tied the T20I series that preceded the three-game ODI series, which South Africa had claimed by virtue of winning the first two matches.

They ensured a winning finish with a superb all-round performance, beating South Africa in convincing fashion.

Captain Paul Stirling starred with the bat, making 88 from 92 deliveries, but there were a number of contributions throughout the order and Ireland’s seamers then drove home the advantage with ball in hand.

Stirling earlier called correctly at the toss for the first time in five attempts and, after electing to bat, flourished alongside Andrew Balbirnie.

The pair made 101 for the first wicket, setting a new best for Ireland’s highest opening partnership against South Africa in ODI cricket.

The opener brought up his half century, his 30th in the format for Ireland, before Balbirnie (45) pulled Lizaad Williams into the hands of Tristan Stubbs on the leg-side boundary just five runs short of his own 50.

Ireland’s skipper was unrelenting in the Abu Dhabi heat, before eventually departing in the 35th over.

Curtis Campher (34) and the returning Lorcan Tucker (26) provided further contributions, while Harry Tector’s rapid 60 from 48 was a welcome return to form for the 24-year-old and took Ireland to 284-9 from their 50 overs.

Both Mark Adair and Graham Hume quickly settled into their work with the new ball, picking up a wicket apiece to dismiss both openers and leave South Africa stunned at 8-2.

Adair then made it 10-3 by trapping stand-in skipper Rassie van der Dussen lbw at the start of the fifth over, the score now 10-3 and Ireland cock-a-hoop.

Kyle Verreynne (38) looked to find a way back for his team but couldn’t build on his start and by the time he fell to Craig Young, the Proteas were struggling at 59-4.

A 47-run partnership between Jason Smith and Andile Phehlukwayo frustrated Ireland until the latter top-edged a pull shot to Young, earning Fionn Hand a first wicket on his ODI debut.

Smith kept up the charge and reached a well-made half century but could only watch on as Bjorn Fortuin (11) was bowled by Matthew Humphreys and Williams became Young’s third wicket.

Ireland sensed victory but Smith moved up a gear and was closing in on a century until he gave a chance to deep third off the bowling of Hume, leaving Ireland just one wicket away from a famous win.

Hume picked up that wicket in the 47th over, delivering the perfect end to Ireland Men’s international year.
