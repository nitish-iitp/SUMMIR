Magnificent 177 to sink Bangladesh maintains winning streak as South Africa semi-final looms

f you’re a casual cricket watcher in Australia, you might not have twigged that Bangladesh are a pretty good team these days. They win at home more often than not, and especially in 50-over cricket have won regularly on the road. By their standard, this World Cup has been dismal. One win early before Afghanistan built confidence, one win late when Sri Lanka were out of contention. In between, scores from 142 and 256, beaten easily five times in a row.

On form, then, even though the result could not affect the semi-final standings, it was a surprise Australia conceded as many as 306 in their final group game in Pune on Saturday. A potential hiccup was overridden when Mitchell Marsh brought to life the Marshmallow Man – a relentless, cheerful, monster of an innings that ploughed through everything in its path, reaching 177 not out in a sweet final explosion.

Marsh had made a flying visit home to bid farewell to his grandfather. “I’m sure my nana and mum and all the family are watching at home, and hopefully it put a smile on their face,” he said. “My pop was a great man, and they celebrated his life yesterday afternoon, and I’m sure they had a few beers as well.”

There have been 10 higher scores in one-day international chases, led by Glenn Maxwell’s 201 not out in Australia’s previous match. But where Maxwell’s rescue from seven wickets down seemed a miracle, Marsh’s at first drop seemed inevitable, supported with little alarm by David Warner and Steve Smith in consecutive century partnerships.

But for all the good cheer of the second innings, the first innings was not a great sign in a World Cup where Australia’s opening bowlers have struggled, allowing teams to build strongly through the first 20-30 overs. Bangladesh were 170 for two at barely past the halfway mark, on track for more like 350 than the score they posted. Even Marsh might have struggled with that.

Afghanistan a few days earlier were 172 for two at one point against Australia, and nearly reached 300. England at 102 for two were in the hunt for a mid-range chase. New Zealand reached 168 for two and nearly chased 389. Pakistan were 175 for two just past halfway, Sri Lanka 165 for two at a similar point. South Africa, the waiting semi-final opponent, were 197 for two, while the likely finalist India reached 167 for three on the way to a small target.

Mitchell Starc was rested against Bangladesh, having taken only early wickets in two of his eight games, but the rejig with Pat Cummins taking the new ball and Sean Abbott at first change did not change the trend. It is tribute to Australia’s late-overs bowling and heavy run-scoring that this team has ended the group stage with seven wins in a row, but two imposing batting opponents could punish this tendency in the knockouts.

Something else that has not gone to plan, but this time to Australia’s benefit, has been Marnus Labuschagne playing every game. Two months ago, he was due to captain Australia A instead of going to the World Cup, selectors citing a lack of consistency. What followed has been a scarcely believable cascade of coincidence.

First, Smith picked up a wrist injury, opening a place for Labuschagne on the South Africa warm-up tour. Then he was into the XI as a concussion substitute for Cameron Green. Two good innings from there, and Ashton Agar reaggravating a calf problem, let him sneak into the squad, while Travis Head’s inclusion while recovering from a broken hand opened up a few possible matches.

Selectors might still have gone for two all-rounders, but Marcus Stoinis tweaked a calf. Head might have returned for game five against the Dutch but was held back a week. Australia barely got away without a sixth bowling option against New Zealand, so Green returned against England, but Marsh had to return home to be with family. As he returned against Afghanistan, Smith missed out with an attack of vertigo. When Smith recovered to play Bangladesh, Maxwell was rested after his double-ton exertions.

Each time it has been Labuschagne facing the drop and each time fate has intervened. In the meantime, he has made himself one of Australia’s most valuable fielders. His mad boundary save in the final over in Dharamsala may have won the New Zealand game. Against Bangladesh, he produced two run-outs: racing 29 metres to slide and return the perfect throw from deep square, sitting up for the keeper to slam on to the stumps, then the second sprinting from cover, diving forward to underarm and hit direct, like a tribute to his South African heritage.

Those efforts knocked off Mahmudullah, Bangladesh’s player of the tournament, and Najmul Hossain Shanto, the best next-gen talent. As Labuschagne’s contributions build, Smith’s unbeaten 63 in the game may have been a score he needed, as well as one that coincidentally denied Labuschagne the chance to bat. With Maxwell to return for the semi-final, the choice of who makes way is not quite as clear as it was.
