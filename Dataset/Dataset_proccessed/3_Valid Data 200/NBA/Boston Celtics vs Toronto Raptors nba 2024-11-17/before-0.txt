Three rows of coaches and so little coaching when it counts!!!
Did anyone other than me notice Davion Mitchell NOT double team Tatum in final ticks of OT??? Despite there being no time left on the clock for another pass. He just stood there and guarded empty space…… – 11:44 AM

NEW @CLNSMedia — Jayson Tatum, even after 11 straight misses, boasts an underrated record with the ball in his hands for the last shot. He now has 11 game-tying or go-ahead shots late since ’20, the most in the NBA: clnsmedia.com/jayson-tatum-g… – 4:27 AM

Tatum had missed 11 straight game-tying or go-ahead shots in the final 5 sec. of the 4Q/OT before Saturday’s winner over Toronto (SAT’s 4Q miss not listed). Last make was that great back court play for the GW 3 @ PHI in ’23. pic.x.com/faTy9kqYnW – 3:12 AM

Saw Neemias Queta with Davion Mitchell’s jersey over his shoulder after the game tonight. The #Kings’ 2021 draft picks led SAC over the #Celtics in that Summer league’s championship. Mitchell told me Queta seeked him out for the swap: “He said, ‘let me get that,’ I said, ‘bet, no – 12:52 AM

@RealBobManning
RJ Barrett has 21 PTS 12 AST and just saved Toronto with a 3 before the shot clock. #Raptors stay within 2 and Poetl is heading to the FT line for a career high and to tie the game. – 10:10 PM

Jakob Poeltl is one point short of tying his career high of 31. He has 30 in 26 minutes on 14 for 17 FG. #Celtics are letting him work and he’s hitting everything. #Raptors – 10:00 PM

The Raptors are even worse than the Celtics at defending the rim
Boston needs to just attack, attack, and attack some more – 9:31 PM

2pt game at half and it wasn’t looking that way when the Celtics jumped out to a 14-4 lead. Jak has been outstanding and good to see RJ look closer to his best with 9-5-5 at the half.
Boston shooting just 29.6% on threes and bench battle going the Raps way too 14-5 – 9:12 PM

@PayalDoshiTV
Good things happen when you hang around. Toronto finished the half strong . – 9:11 PM

lol celtics more than tripled raptors’ 3-point attempts in the first quarter – 8:40 PM
John Karalis
@John_Karalis
16 of Raptors 26 points have come in the paint. C’s allowed 17 FGA in the paint already. That continues to be a problem for them. – 8:40 PM

@RealBobManning
No trouble offensively. #Celtics get couple stops around the rim, White hits a 3 and Queta lands a lob from Tatum. 9-4 BOS. – 8:17 PM

The Celtics City Edition jerseys look particularly odd with the standard green of the parquet
Totally unbecoming of a franchise with this much history – 8:16 PM
Bobby Manning
@RealBobManning
Rim troubles continue as #Raptors score their first two looks inside. – 8:15 PM
Cameron Tabatabaie
@CTabatabaie
Raptors start the game with a light press and some strong perimeter defense
This was something that gave the Celtics issues against the Hawks and the Warriors – 8:13 PM

@John_Karalis
Wow…. just saw Bruno Fernando giving illegal hugs to the Celtics coaching staff… a total breach of psychological protocol – 8:11 PM
