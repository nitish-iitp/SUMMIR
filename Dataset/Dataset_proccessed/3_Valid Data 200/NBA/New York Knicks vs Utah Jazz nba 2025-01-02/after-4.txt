No Jalen Brunson and Deuce McBride? No problem.

The New York Knicks won their ninth straight game on Wednesday night, courtesy of a comfortable 119-103 win over the Utah Jazz at Madison Square Garden.

Brunson, 28, did not play due to a coach’s decision per a foot injury sustained—as he recently joined the Knicks injury report. The man who’d usually fill in as the point guard, McBride, also did not play due to hamstring tightness.

Nevertheless, Tom Thibodeau‘s squad handled its business in its first home game since Mikal Bridges‘s heroic effort against the San Antonio Spurs on Christmas Day. And it was the big man who led the way.

Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 31 points and 21 rebounds in the businesslike victory Wednesday night. Towns became the last Knicks player since the great Patrick Ewing to collect over 30 points and 20 rebounds in multiple games in a single season.

The first quarter featured a closely contested game, as the Jazz enjoyed a one-point lead after the first frame. However, the home team outscored Utah 32-21 in the second quarter to take control.

Key contributors to the victory include Mikal Bridges, who tallied 27 points on 12 of 17 from the floor, and Josh Hart, who used his energy en route to a triple-double (15 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists).

Cameron Payne got the start at point guard and played 36 minutes. Although it turned out to be a tough shooting night—2-9 from the field—Payne helped pace the offense with 9 assists (to 3 turnovers) and 3 steals.

Utah cut a 10-point halftime lead to 8 after the third quarter, led by Colin Sexton’s efficiency. The former Cleveland Cavaliers’ guard finished with 25 points on 10 of 13 shooting and 4 of 5 from beyond the arc, including 4 assists and 4 rebounds.

What helped pace the Jazz was Jordan Clarkson’s 25 points off the bench. However, sharpshooter Lauri Markkanen couldn’t find anything all night, shooting just 6-22 including 1-10 from three (16 points).

With a shortened bench, Thibodeau played just eight players. Newcomer Landry Shamet played 11 minutes (2 points), whereas rookie Tyler Kolek also scored 2 points while chipping in with 4 assists in his 11 minutes.

The red-hot 24-10 New York Knicks are now just 0.5 games behind the Atlantic Division-leading Boston Celtics (24-9). They’ll next turn their attention to a Friday night road game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, where old friend Isaiah Hartenstein awaits.
