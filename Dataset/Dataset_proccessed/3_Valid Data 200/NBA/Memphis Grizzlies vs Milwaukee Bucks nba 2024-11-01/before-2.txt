FanDuel NBA Promo Offer: 50% Profit Boost for Thursday NBA Games on 10/31/24
FANDUEL STAFF
2mo

The NBA is back, and FanDuel Sportsbook has plenty of ways to get in on the action. Ahead of Thursday's four-game NBA slate, FanDuel Sportsbook has a special promotion for ALL customers.

All customers get a 50% Profit Boost Token for NBA game(s) taking place on October 31st, 2024!

Thursday's action tips off at 8:10pm ET when the Milwaukee Bucks take on the Memphis Grizzlies. Milwaukee has limped to a 1-3 record to start the year, but they still feature a pair of stars in Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard. Memphis hasn't gotten off to a hot start either, carrying a 2-3 record into tonight's game. The Grizzlies did get Ja Morant back last night, but they're expected to be without several key rotation pieces.

As a result, the Bucks are 6.5-point road favorites as of Thursday morning. The total is set at 232.

Full Bucks-Grizzlies odds can be found below, while all NBA odds can be found on FanDuel Sportsbook.
