Zach Edey and the Memphis Grizzlies played the Brooklyn Nets on Monday at home. Edey's eighth NBA game was off to a promising start. After tallying at least 10 points in his last three games, he had six in the first quarter alone against Brooklyn. He went 3 of 3 from the floor, adding three rebounds and two blocks.

Edey and the Grizzlies led 30-23 in that stretch. Memphis outscored Brooklyn by four in its rookie center's 6:11 minutes of play.

Edey played four minutes in the second frame, which wasn't as eventful as the first. He missed his only shot attempt and grabbed one rebound. He remained a game-high +3 on the floor for the Grizzlies.

Edey raised his level in the second half and added 19 points to finish with a career-high 25 points. He shot 8 of 8, including one 3. Edey also added seven more rebounds and two blocks.

Zach Edey shatters rookie records but Memphis falls short against Brooklyn

Zach Edey had a career night, but it came in a losing cause against the Brooklyn Nets as the Memphis Grizzlies lost 106-104. Edey shattered rookie records, becoming the first rookie with a 20/10 game, shooting at least 90% from the floor.

He was a force in the second half amid the Grizzlies' struggles, helping them keep it close. However, the Nets edged ahead in the clutch behind another Dennis Schroder masterclass. The German finished with 20 points and six assists, shooting 7 of 15, including 2 of 7 from 3-point range.

Meanwhile, the Grizzlies got 25 points and nine assists from Ja Morant on 10 of 22 shooting. A relatively quiet night from the rest of the roster and 3-point shooting struggles in the absence of Desmond Bane hindered Memphis' chances of avenging Wednesday's loss to Brooklyn.

Nevertheless, Zach Edey's performance can give the team some confidence as the Grizzlies look to bounce back and string a lengthy winning stretch together over the coming weeks.
