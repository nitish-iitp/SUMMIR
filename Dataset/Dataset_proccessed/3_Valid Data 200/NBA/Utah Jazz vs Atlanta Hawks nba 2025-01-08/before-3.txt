This is what Utah’s roster looks like 🩼🩼🦽🩼🩼🦽🦽🦽🦽 … with Clarkson, Collins & George all missing tonight’s game it literally opens up 25+ FGA, and Lauri will be the one to eat those attempts up. Atlanta allows the SECOND MOST PPG to PF’s and after going over in 11 of 28 games this year I can guarantee he will start going over to end the year and reach an equilibrium… not only can I guarantee that he’s gonna eventually go over a lot more in the coming months, but I love the fact that this is his highest line of the season, as the bookmakers are herding sheep towards his under, or atleast away from his over. Don’t be a 🐑 be a 🦈

W.Kessler u12.5 Rebs-115
0.87u
THE BOUNCE 📽️: 11.09 Rebs

Kessler is coming off two monster rebounding games with 17 and 16 rebounds, but this is a solid spot to fade a high line. Over these last two, Kessler is averaging 24 rebound chances per game, so he has been very efficient in those two. Over the last 10, it drops to 20 rebound chances per game.

Having John Collins back in the lineup is big, who provides another good source of rebounding for this Utah team (averages 10-15 rebound chances per game).

ATL is not a great matchup either, allowing the 14th most rebounds per game to opposing centers. A big part of that is ATL runs with a ton of pace (2nd highest pace this season). Running a lot in transition doesn't allow opponent defenses to get set, which can spread the rebounding around on the team. In 2 games vs ATL last season, Kessler had 12 and 9 rebounds. ATL also ranks 8th in offensive rebounds per game this season.

Finally, there's a chance ATL could run away with this one early if Utah can't keep up with scoring, which could limit Kessler's late game minutes here. It'll probably be sweaty, but I'm here for it.
