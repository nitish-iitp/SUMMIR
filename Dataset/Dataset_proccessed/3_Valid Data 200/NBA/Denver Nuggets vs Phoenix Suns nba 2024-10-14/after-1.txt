Phoenix Suns vs Denver Nuggets: Game summary

Suns coach Mike Budenholzer opened the game without any of his starters. Royce O’Neale, Ryan Dunn and Monte Morris carried the visitors in the early going. The frontcourt pairing of Bol Bol and Mason Plumlee looked awkward.

Aaron Gordon, Nikola Jokic and Michael Porter did the heavy lifting for the hosts. Russell Westbrook finally debuted for the Nuggets in front of a wildly cheering home crowd. Denver led 33-26 after the first quarter.

Basketball fans got a vintage "Joker" performance from Jokic in the first half. He already had 14 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Murray struggled, scoring just two points on 1-for-6 shooting, including 0-for-3 from deep.

Ryan Dunn led the Suns with 11 points while the rest of the starters had 20. Phoenix's bench stepped up but Budenholzer's crew trailed 51-60 by halftime.

After trailing by nine points at halftime, the Suns steadily worked their way back to the game. Mason Plumlee and Bol Bol, who struggled together in the first half, led the initial surge. Royce O'Neale and Monte Morris took over later in the period.

Michael Porter Jr. and Julian Strawther starred for the Denver Nuggets in the third quarter. Denver's defense, though, allowed Phoenix's mostly second-stringers to cut the lead to 90-88 before the fourth quarter.

The final frame mostly featured the benchwarmers from both teams. Clutch shots from Ryan Dunn and Damion Lee allowed the Phoenix Suns to walk away with a 118-114 win.
