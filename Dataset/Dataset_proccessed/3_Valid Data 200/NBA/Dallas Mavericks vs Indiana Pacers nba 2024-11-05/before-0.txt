Why is Dereck Lively II not playing tonight against Pacers? Latest injury update for Mavericks center (Nov. 4) (Image Source: Imagn)

Dereck Lively II will not play Monday against the Indiana Pacers. He was a late scratch for the Dallas Mavericks an hour before tipoff. The Mavericks say he's out, citing a right shoulder sprain. According to ESPN's Tim McMahon, Lively suffered the injury during a pre-game shoot-around.

It was the second night of a back-to-back, and the Grizzlies could have benefitted from his presence against the frontcourt of Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner. Lively has been exceptional this season, averaging 9.3 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists, shooting 70.6%.

Dereck Lively II was practicing 3-pointers before Monday's game

Dereck Lively II is looking to add to his offensive game. He was seen working on his 3-point shooting before Monday's contest, too. Lively already has a tremendous post-game with elite footwork and finishing ability at the rim that makes him tough to guard for opposing bigs at his size. A 3-point shot could elevate his game further and help the Mavericks even more.

He's yet to attempt a 3 in six games this year, but that could change soon.

“I have been working on that for a long time, slowing building on it and slowly building on the confidence. As soon as I got it, it was going right up,” Lively said on Oct. 3.

However, Lively remains cognizant of the fact that he doesn't have to forcefully look to attempt 3s. He wants it to be natural. Lively has shown a knack of playing winning basketball and making efficient plays. His goal continues to ensure his teammates benefit from it.

“Whatever shots come to me, I am going to take. I am not going to be out there searching for three because I have many teammates on my team that I would rather have shoot the ball more than me," Lively said.

His gravity in the post sees defenses collapse easily, opening up the 3-point shot for the Mavericks' shooters on the perimeter. Dallas will hope he can get going soon amid his injury setback and build his confidence in the 3-point shot that will draw defenses out of the paint and create space.
