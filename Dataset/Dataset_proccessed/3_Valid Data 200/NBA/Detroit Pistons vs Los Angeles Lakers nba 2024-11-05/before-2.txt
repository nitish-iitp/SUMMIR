Dalton Knecht of the LA Lakers is one of the top rookies of the young season so far. Knecht earned rotational minutes under coach JJ Redick with an impressive preseason. The Lakers also needed shooting off the bench, which he provides and shoots 34.8% from deep this season.

Knecht did not get a lot of minutes on Monday night, playing in just eight minutes as the Lakers lost to the Detroit Pistons 115-103. He finished with five points on perfect shooting 2-for-2. He didn't get an opportunity to play in the second half as the Lakers were trying to come back from a big deficit.

Anthony Davis had a game-high 37 points plus nine rebounds and four assists, but it wasn't enough to prevent the defeat. LeBron James added 20 points, eight rebounds and 11 assists, while Austin Reaves contributed 17 points, four rebounds and four assists.

The Detroit Pistons managed to stave off any comeback attempts from the LA Lakers in the second half. Lakers coach JJ Redick didn't put Dalton Knecht back in the game in the final two quarters and went with his starters. They managed to bring it down to five points in the fourth period, but the Pistons made another run.

Knecht made both of his shots in the game although his defense was nearly non-existent when he was in the court. The Pistons increased their lead when the Lakers bench was playing, which highlighted the Purple and Gold's lack of depth.
