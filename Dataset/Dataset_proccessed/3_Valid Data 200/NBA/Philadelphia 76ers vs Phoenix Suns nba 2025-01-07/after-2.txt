Phoenix Suns Bradley Beal said he received no indication that he was going to be benched for the first time in nine years ahead of Sunday's matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers.

"A little difficult."<br><br>Bradley Beal was surprised by benching, said he wasn't given an indication about it.<br><br>"Coach made a decision. I'm not going to sit there and argue with him. I'm not going to sit here and be a distraction. I'm not going to sit here and be an asshole." <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Suns?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Suns</a> <a href="https://t.co/wBBTNTDWEG">pic.twitter.com/wBBTNTDWEG</a>

Beal scored 25 points off the bench, including 20 in the second half, to help the Suns end a four-game losing streak with a 109-99 win over the Sixers.

Beal said after the game that he hadn't heard from the Suns regarding a potential trade, which he would need to sign off on thanks to the no-trade clause in his contract.

The star guard, who waived the clause in order to facilitate his trade from the Wizards to the Suns in 2023, would need to do the same in order for Phoenix to move him ahead of the Feb. 6 deadline.

"I need to be addressed because I hold the cards," Beal said Monday. "Until I'm addressed and somebody says something different, then I'll be a Sun."

Head coach Mike Budenholzer said after the game the decision to bench Beal and Jusuf Nurkić was made because the Suns "needed to make a change" after a four-game losing streak.

"They're two important players for us, two very good players for us," Budenholzer said, adding: "They're pros. I talked to each of them individually. They want what's best for the team."

Mike Budenholzer discussed the Suns' starting lineup change, saying the team needed to shake things up. Went on to say that Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkic took the news like pros <a href="https://t.co/b8I9KQp3Y4">pic.twitter.com/b8I9KQp3Y4</a>

Adding Beal and Nurkić to the reserves allowed the Suns' bench to outscore the Sixers' bench 54-7 in the comeback victory.

But Beal made it clear after the game that he considers himself a starter. Where the Suns place him in the lineup going forward could potentially influence his willingness to consider a trade if Phoenix looks to move him.
