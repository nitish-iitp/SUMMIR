Death taxes & KD shitting on the Hawks. He has scored 26+ in 12/13 games vs this team, and scored 25+ in 24/27 games vs this team. His career PPG is only higher vs his old team the Thunder, and oddly enough the Pistons. But he does average 29+ PPG vs the Hawks. Not only that but tonight Jalen Johnson is sitting, and KD will have the opportunity to serve the #1 pick Risacher with a classic NBA “welcome to the league moment”. Oh yeah and this season Hawks allow 4th most points to PF’s including Johnson in the lineup. I see them giving up even more than usual with him out tonight

Jalen is out so Hunter should step in as the #2 option for ATL. He’s covered this line in 4/5 games w/o Jalen, with the only miss being on the hook and he was in early foul trouble - AVG 19.8 PTS and 15.2 FGA.

Hunter’s taken 14+ FGA in 4/5 w/o Jalen and would most likely have gotten to ~14 if it wasn’t for foul trouble last game. In games he takes 12+ FGA, he’s covered this line in 16/20 games - AVG 20.75 PTS.

PHX is a good MU for him as well. They rank #22 in DRTG and really struggle vs. wings who aren’t checked by Dunn. I’m expecting Dunn to get the Trae assignment as he typically takes the opposing teams best player/ball dominant player (on Melo last game).

Recent wings vs. PHX:
- Bridges: 21 PTS
- Oubre: 26 PTS
- Mathurin: 13 PTS
- Kuminga: 34 PTS

B.Beal o3.5 Ast+100
1u
Despite the move to the bench, Beal still has seen 30 minutes in both games.

His assists line is set at 3.5, a number he has now hit in both games off the bench with 5 and 5 on 9 and 8 potentials.

When he has played the Hawks, he has had no difficulty dishing the rock. Against Atlanta he has recorded 10 and 9 assists on 14 and 18 potentials when he's played with KD and Book.

The Hawks allow the third most assists per game to their opponents and considering they play at the second-fastest Pace in the league this is a clear Pace Up spot.

When Beal has had at least 5 potential assists he’s hit this prop in 55% of games this season and if we go up to 8 potentials he had an 80% conversion rate this season.
D.Hunter o17.5 Pts-115
1u
The Hawks face off against the Phoenix Suns and will be without one of their key contributors in Jalen Johnson.

Without Johnson, I’m targeting De’Andre Hunter. Hunter is averaging 19.7 ppg this season in 27.9 minutes per game. When he doesn’t share the floor with Jalen Johnson, he sees his scoring increase by over 1 point per 100 possessions - it is not incredibly stark; however, it is a slight move in the right direction.

I expect this game to be fairly fast Paced given the Hawks’ ability to speed up their opponents. Plus, the Suns’ defense is now bottom 10 in the league.

Hunter has exceeded this mark of 17.5 points 8 of his last 10 games and I like him to do so again on Thursday night.
