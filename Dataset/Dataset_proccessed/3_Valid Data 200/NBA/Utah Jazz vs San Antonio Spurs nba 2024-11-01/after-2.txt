Victor Wembanyama bounced back from one of his worst NBA outings with a rare 5×5 to lift the San Antonio Spurs to a 106-88 victory over the Utah Jazz on Thursday night in Salt Lake City.

A night after scoring a career-low six points in a loss at Oklahoma City, Wembanyama amassed 25 points, nine rebounds, seven assists, five blocks and five steals.

It was the second time the 20-year-old had accomplished the so-called 5×5 (five of each category), and Wembanyama joined Hakeem Olajuwon and Andrei Kirilenko as the only NBA players ever to do it more than once. Olajuwon did it six times, Kirilenko three.

Chris Paul contributed 19 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and two steals to help San Antonio win on the second night of a back-to-back set. Keldon Johnson added 13 points, Jeremy Sochan scored 11 and Sandro Mamukelashvili chipped in 10 points.

Collin Sexton led Utah with 16 points. Keyonte George scored 15, and John Collins added 14 points and 11 rebounds.

The Jazz played without leading scorer Lauri Markkanen (back spasms).

Utah led 53-47 at halftime but fell apart in the third quarter en route to a fifth straight loss to begin the season. The Jazz, who shot 39 percent, are the only winless team remaining in the NBA.

Harrison Barnes scored six points for the Spurs in a 16-2 run to open the second half.

San Antonio forced Utah into 12 turnovers in the third quarter while seizing momentum. The Spurs outscored the Jazz 30-14 in the period, turning a six-point halftime deficit into a 77-67 lead going into the final quarter.

Utah surged to a 30-19 lead by the end of the first quarter. Former San Antonio player Patty Mills sparked his new team with all nine of his points off the bench in that quarter.

Mills played for the Spurs from 2011 through 2021, helping them win the 2014 championship.

Utah started two rookies because of injuries. Kyle Filipowski had 12 points and five rebounds, filling in for Markkanen, while Cody Williams, the 10th overall draft pick, scored two points and secured five rebounds.
