SACRAMENTO KINGS
Kings' De'Aaron Fox Tweets 'My Bad 😔🙋🏾' After Falling 1 Point Short of Kobe Record
JOSEPH ZUCKER
NOVEMBER 17, 2024

B/R

Sacramento Kings star De'Aaron Fox offered a mock apology after he fell just short of matching an impressive scoring record set by Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant.

Fox dropped 49 points on Saturday in a 121-117 win over the Utah Jazz, one night after his 60-point showing in an overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. According to NBA.com, it's the second-best combined scoring output on consecutive nights over the last 50 years, only one point less than Bryant.

Somebody must have alerted Fox to the fact:

My bad 😔🙋🏾‍♂️

Fox missed four of his eight free throws in the fourth quarter. While inconsequential toward the final outcome, leaving four points at the charity stripe prevented the 2022-23 All-Star from making history.

De'Aaron Fox just said that DeMar DeRozan, Trey Lyles and Malik Monk all gave Fox hell for missed free throws tonight.<br><br>Fox shot 14/19 from the line. <a href="https://t.co/CZfpgTiwXH">https://t.co/CZfpgTiwXH</a>

Still, Sunday's performance is impressive enough in its own right.

Fox shot 16-of-30 from the field and got to the free-throw line 19 times. The Jazz simply had no answer for him when he was attacking the basket. The 6'3" playmaker nearly had a double-double, too, dishing out nine assists.

Up next for Sacramento are the Atlanta Hawks, who rank 25th in defensive rating, per NBA.com. Don't be surprised if Fox is once again flirting with a 50-point outing.
