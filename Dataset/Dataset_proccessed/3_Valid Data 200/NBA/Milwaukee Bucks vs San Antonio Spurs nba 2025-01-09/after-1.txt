MILWAUKEE BUCKS
Damian Lillard: Wemby 'More Different' Than Any Player I've Played Against in NBA

Milwaukee Bucks star point guard Damian Lillard got an up-close look at the impact San Antonio Spurs second-year phenom Victor Wembanyama can have on the court during Wednesday night's game between the two teams.

"He's always in range to block a shot, to change a shot. … It's more different when he's on the floor than any other player that I've played against," Lillard told reporters of Wembanyama after Milwaukee's 121-105 win, per The Athletic's Fred Katz.

Lillard led the Bucks with 26 points in the victory, but that doesn't mean he had an easy time against Wembanyama. Katz highlighted an instance where Wembanyama's presence under the basket deterred Lillard from taking the open lane to the rim and forced him to pass the ball back out instead.

Wembanyama had 10 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in one of his worst performances of the season. It was his first time scoring under 15 points since Nov. 7.

Still, the 2024 Rookie of the Year is a superstar in the making, and he will continue to garner respect from veterans like Lillard over the course of his development.

Lillard and the Bucks will be going for their third straight win when they face the Orlando Magic on Friday, while Wembanyama and the Spurs will be trying to end a three-game skid when they meet the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday.
