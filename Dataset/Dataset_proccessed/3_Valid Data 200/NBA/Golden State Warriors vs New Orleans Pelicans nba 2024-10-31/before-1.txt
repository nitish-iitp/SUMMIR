Pelicans Head Coach Willie Green

ON GUYS STEPPING UP AMIDST THE INJURIES:

“I’ll tell you guys the same thing we told our group, there’s no moral victories, but those guys competed. They competed, they played together, they secured the ball, they got some quality looks. We didn’t shoot the ball great tonight, but we battled our tails off being down some guys and we took a step in the right direction, and now we’ve got to get home and get healthy. I’m real proud of the guys that stepped up tonight, Jamal (Cain), J.R.E. (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl), Brandon Boston Jr., you know everybody that touched the floor they just gave it everything they had.”

ON DEALING WITH ADVERSITY SO EARLY IN THE SEASON:

“You know what, it’s a part of life, it’s a part of sports, and I truly believe that when you face difficult times it prepares you for something greater in the end, and so we’re in a situation right now where we’re facing some adversity. Our goal is to stick together, continue to work at it, continue to go out and have joy when we play, and I saw that tonight even though we didn’t win the game. We will get home and just build from here and get some guys back.”

ON IF LESSONS FROM LAST YEAR’S SLOW START CAN PROPEL THEM THIS SEASON:

“All of these experiences you go back and think about how we handled them, and it prepares you, and so every team at some point is going to go through some difficulties throughout the year. Sometimes there’s injuries, there can be other factors. Right now, ours is injuries, we’ve got some main guys out and we’ve just got to continue to take it day by day and get through it.”

PELICANS GUARD JORDAN HAWKINS

ON THE INJURIES PILING UP:

“I think it’s similar to last year coming in, so just taking advantage of all these minutes, just play as hard as I can. Guys get a chance to play that aren’t usually in the rotation. Just trying to grind out as much as we can, compete and play hard.”

ON HOW HE FEELS POSTGAME FOLLOWING THE BACK SPASMS AND ROLLED ANKLE:

“I’m fine. My back is tightened up, but I’ll be alright.”

ON GETTING OVER THE HUMP:

“Like I said, I was telling the guys we’re not even 10 games in yet. It’s a long season, and its only October, so we gotta keep our heads up. Losing the game without some of our guys, so we’ll be fine. I’m not worried at all, just want the team to stay together, the biggest thing for us is staying together. It’s a very long season.”

ON HOW THEY STAY TOGETHER:

“We have veteran leaders, have our veteran leaders step up. I think I can start leading more as well, start telling guys, start encouraging the guys, be that kind of leader.”

PELICANS FORWARD BRANDON INGRAM

ON THE AMOUNT OF ADVERSITY NEW ORLEANS HAS HIT OVER FIVE GAMES:

“It is a lot to process. I think it is a testament, some more preparation, not knowing who is on the floor, and it is a different approach to the game. We are limited on guys. We had some guys go out tonight again, so we just have to figure it out, keep building, try and be the best with what we have. We have to tighten up some screws, we know we can’t have a lot of errors right now, so we have to tighten up. We have to go back tomorrow, get our rest, and be ready for Indiana, try to go over the game plan and execute it the best way we can, and continue to just build.”

ON IF THERE IS ANY CONCERN ON HOW THE TEAM IS RESPONDING TO ITS ADVERSITY:

“Well we’ve had guys out, but this was the first game where it was up to me and Zion (Williamson) as key players on the floor, so we just gotta figure it out. We know we have to give more offensively, but we definitely have to give more on the defensive end and we have to have that energy every single time we come out, and we have to do our job.”

ON HIS NIGHT OFFENSIVELY:

“Yeah, a couple double teams. I was just trying to make the right play, finding guys in transition. I thought I made the right plays but of course those attempts have to get up, especially if we want to have a chance to win. And I have to find my offense on the floor, while getting double teamed, while seeing different bodies, so I will figure it out.”

ON WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET OUT OF THIS RUT AS A TEAM:

“Worry about us, play hard. Everyone has to do their job and just keep going. Adversity hits, we just stay together, we don’t splinter, we just try and get the best of each other.”

PELICANS FORWARD ZION WILLIAMSON

ON THE AMOUNT OF ADVERSITY NEW ORLEANS HAS HIT OVER FIVE GAMES:

“You know, nobody likes losing, but you have to look at the positives in it. We did play more aggressively. We just have to find our rhythm, especially me, offensively. I just have to make it happen. I don’t put it on anyone else. I take full responsibility for that, I just have to make it happen, it is just where we are at with it.”

ON HOW HE HAS BEEN FEELING ABOUT HIS OFFENSIVE GAME:

“Last game I had much more success because I was more patient. I think tonight I was forcing the issue more, taking shots over two or three guys when I had a kick out or a better look. I just have to get ready to be patient.”  

ON THE CURRENT MESSAGE FROM THE COACHING STAFF:

“Stay the course. I go through this story every year, it is what it is. People don’t rock with me, they say this, they say that, it is a part of the game. Personally, I just need to stay like that when the script gets flipped.”

ON YVES MISSI’S SO FAR:

“Since I saw him work out for the first time in Laguna Beach this past summer, he’s made tremendous leaps since then. He works hard and day by day he gets better. I am excited that we have him on this team and I am excited to see his progression.”

ON CREATING OFFENSE MOVING FORWARD:

“I have to find more off-ball movement, because no matter where I catch the ball, there are three or four people there. I have to play basketball with more intention, like chess, because I am in year six, I am not new. I just have to make it happen. I don’t have anything else to say, I just have to make it happen.”

WARRIORS HEAD COACH STEVE KERR

ON DRAYMOND GREEN’S LAST FEW GAMES AND HIS DEFENSE ON ZION WILLIAMSON:

“He’s still one of the best defenders in the world that’s for sure. The way he battled out there but also the way he led, his energy, talking to the team at timeouts, at halftime. He was fantastic. He just made it hard on him, seven free throws for Zion that’s a good number for us. You just worry he’s going to have one of those games where he gets 14, 15 free throws. Draymond has a unique ability to be physical without fouling. It’s because he’s so smart, he knows the angles, he understands how to use his strength, and his long arms to make people have to shoot over him. He’s an incredible shot challenger. I think (Brandon) Ingram had a three late and Draymond just went from the middle of the paint all the way to the three-point line and got a piece of it. It was just amazing to watch how smart he is and how active he is.”

ON TONIGHT BEING A MORE DEFENSIVE FOCUSED GAME COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT:

“With all of their guys out—I mean they're missing half their roster—and the way last night’s game went this was a little bit of a letdown game possibility. I thought we let our guard down in the early second quarter, I let my guard down a little bit. I didn't like a couple of my decisions early second quarter. That allowed them to get back in the game. I give them a lot of credit they were playing really good defense, switching everything, making it difficult on us. We had all those turnovers in the second quarter. But our guys settled down in the second half, only two turnovers the whole half. That’s the kind of game you just have to find a way to win and I thought we did that with our defense.”

WARRIORS FORWARD/CENTER DRAYMOND GREEN

ON GUARDING ZION WILLIAMSON ON BACK-TO-BACK NIGHTS:

“Hurts. It was fun man. He’s gotten so much better, just playing him over the first four years of his career. Like you can tell in previous years that he was getting in better shape, like he was starting to take the game more serious, and you could just kind of see gradual steps. You can tell now he’s been in the gym working and improving to get better. To me what that looks like is so worried about everyone talking about weight, and I’ve struggled with that so I know that struggle, so that’s just the only focus, and it looks like now he has that so in check he can actually focus on his game, and he’s gotten so much better. So it was a tough battle. He got the best of me last night and I just wanted to come out and put up a better defensive performance than I did last night.”

ON HIS DEFENSIVE START TO THE SEASON:

“I wanted to come into the season in great shape. I know when I come into the season in great shape that is the key to me having a great season, that is the key to this team having a great season. It’s been all summer watching everyone talk about Chet (Holmgren) and Wemby (Victor Wembanyama), and what they're doing defensively. Don’t forget about Dray. So I want to be in that conversation as well and I think I’ve earned the right to at least be in the conversation. So every game I’m coming out here motivated defensively to get back on the first team all defense. I think I had a really good year last year defensively. I just didn't play enough games. So it’s a goal of mine to get back on that team and then put myself back in the Defensive Player of the Year category is a goal of mine. So when I’m matching up with these guys that’s my mindset. Like I said, it’s not going to work out every night, he had what 31 last night, something like that, on a very efficient 12-for-19 or something. So I just wanted to make him take tougher shots tonight, try to meet force with force, and I was able to get a couple strips. Then also my teammates helping me, I’m not going to sit here and act like it’s just all me. We’re shrinking gaps, flying around, getting deflections, showing the crowd, it’s always a team effort. No one guy is ever stopping a superstar in his sleep by yourself. But in saying that, got to meet the force with force and I wanted to do a better job of that tonight than I did. He put a couple wounds on me last night, he spins, and I was out of bounds somewhere. So I wanted to have a bounce-back game tonight.”

WARRIORS GUARD BUDDY HIELD

ON DRAYMOND GREEN THE LAST FEW GAMES:

“He’s the heart and soul of the team. You hear people talk about it from watching it from the outside but when you’re in the present with him, the way he’s so vocal, the way he talks and everybody listens, everybody just follows. He just has this competitive edge, this competitive spirit that’s unmatched. You really don’t get to know him unless you’re in the fire with him. That’s how special it is. He might not put up 30 points, 25 points a night, but he does all the intangibles to help you win basketball game, guarding Zion (Williamson) and holding him 5-of-20, him when the game’s not going well, making timely threes and keeping the offensive flow. That’s what a winning player does. Hats off to him man I got to see full tilt on it just being here and seeing how much he meant to this franchise. He’s a heck of a leader and everybody follows him. Still a lot to learn from him, he's got a lot of wisdom and he means the world to everybody.”

ON DRAYMOND GREEN’S THREE-POINT SHOOTING TONIGHT:

“Good. I keep telling him he belongs to this world. The Warriors shoot threes and I keep telling him he has a clip on him, to keep shooting.”

ON WHAT HE HAS LEARNED ABOUT DRAYMOND GREEN’S DEFENSE:

“First of all he’s just gifted. He’s twitchy, he’s vocal, he understands it. There’s a reason why he’s a Defensive Player of the Year. He’s mastered defense, like Steph (Curry) mastered offense. He’s just one of those guys that understands defense. He knows the position, he knows when he’s late, when he’s on time, he knows when to x-out, he just has a knack for it. I see why him and Steph have that two-man tandem together, they just understand. He knows when to bail his teammates out. Sometimes in some games he’ll get five stops in a row, I’ll be on the bench and Melt (De’Anthony Melton) is like ‘yo Draymond just got five stops in a row’ and nobody is talking about it. That’s the little things he does and it speaks volumes.”

WARRIORS CENTER/FORWARD TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS

ON THE KEYS TO LIMITING ZION WILLIAMSON TONIGHT:

“Really just everyone that guarded him did a great job on him. Started with Draymond (Green), I think he got him frustrated. Then just team defense. Just knowing which way to send guys and having help because he’s a load to handle.”

ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI ON THE COURT:

“Yeah me and BP have been playing together since last summer and we kind of know what tendencies we like on the floor, he’s always looking for me. He made some great passes and he ended with eight or nine assists. He needs to continue to do that because it really helps our team.”

ON IF THIS IS BETTER DEFENSIVE TEAM THAN LAST SEASON:

“I think we’re a lot different, the matchups that we’ve tried on the floor. The new guys that we brought in, they're more defensive minded players and I think that’s something that we need and so far with just the additions of Coach Stack (Jerry Stackhouse) and his philosophies I think that’s helped us tremendously. We just got to continue to grind and continue to view his teaching, and look at it, watch film, and stuff of that nature so we can be the best team possible on the defensive end.”

WARRIORS GUARD BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI

ON WHETHER HE FEELS THIS TEAM IS BETTER DEFENSIVELY THAN LAST YEAR:

“100 percent. I think that we are really good off covering for each other. As crazy as this sounds Jerry (Stackhouse) has really dumbed it down to the point where everyone understands the principle of what we are trying to do. Everything is super regulated where he tries to eliminate enough grey area as possible. Everything is kind of black and white. We make adjustments accordingly. I think that really helped us, especially through training camp to what we are trying to get to. Like I said he has dumbed down the grey area part of things. Made it super black and white so everyone is on the same page.”

ON WHAT FEELS DIFFERENT DEFENSIVELY SO FAR THIS SEASON:

“I think defensively everything is just congested for the other team. You can feel that. When I am out there it feels like they just don’t have anywhere to go in the paint. Last year we were giving up the rim. The only way they really scored tonight was in transition or on turnovers that we had. We had like 12 at the half and two in the second half. Once we took that away, holding an NBA team to 89 points is pretty tough.”

ON IF THE TEAM’S PROCESS FOR CHALLENGING CALLS IS BETTER THIS SEASON:

“I don’t necessarily think that it is a better process. I think Draymond (Green) is better with his emotional reaction to some things. He understands whether we have a legitimate shot at it. He has been really good with deciphering that, we have only challenged on his five fouls and we have won four out of five of them. He has done a better job of, whether he agrees with the call or not, at the end of the day, is it worth challenging. He has done a great job deciphering that.”
