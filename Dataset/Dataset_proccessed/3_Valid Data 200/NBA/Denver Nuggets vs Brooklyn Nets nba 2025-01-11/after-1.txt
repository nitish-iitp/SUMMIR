In addition to helping the Denver Nuggets secure their sixth win in the past eight games on Friday night, Nikola Jokić and Russell Westbrook made history against the Brooklyn Nets.

The Nuggets duo became the first pair of teammates to record triple-doubles in the same game multiple times in the same season in the 124-105 victory.

TRIPLE-DOUBLE MACHINES 👊👊<br><br>🔋 Jokić: 35p, 15a, 12r<br>🔋 Russ: 25p, 10a, 11r<br><br>They are the first pair of teammates in NBA history to both record a triple-double in the same game MULTIPLE TIMES in a single season 🤯 <a href="https://t.co/oAJg8IB8Ul">pic.twitter.com/oAJg8IB8Ul</a>

Jokić had 35 points on 14-of-21 shooting, 15 assists and 12 rebounds in 38 minutes. Westbrook finished with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 36 minutes.

Aaron Gordon's injury led to Nuggets head coach Michael Malone moving Westbrook into the starting lineup on Dec. 27. The former NBA MVP started seven times in the first 28 games.

In nine games since Westbrook joined the starting five, the Nuggets are 7-2. This stretch does coincide with an easier part of the schedule, with their wins over the Nets, Detroit Pistons, Utah Jazz, Atlanta Hawks, San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers.

The two best teams that Denver has played during this run were losses to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics by a combined 26 points.

Westbrook is doing his part in these games, averaging 15.4 points on 53.5 percent shooting, 8.2 assists and 7.4 rebounds. He has recorded three triple-doubles so far this season.

Jokić remains an unstoppable machine with 15 triple-doubles in 32 starts. He is right on the edge of averaging a triple-double for the season with 31.6 points, 13.0 rebounds and 9.9 assists per game.

There were questions during the offseason about Westbrook's fit with the Nuggets when he was rumored to be joining the team. He has acclimated nicely to playing with a strong central force like Jokić thus far.

The Nuggets have climbed up to fourth in the Western Conference standings with a 22-15 record. They are within three games of the Houston Rockets for the No. 2 seed, with those two teams set to meet for the first time this season on Jan. 15 in Denver.
