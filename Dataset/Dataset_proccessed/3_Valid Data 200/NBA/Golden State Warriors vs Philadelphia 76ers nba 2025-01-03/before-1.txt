The Golden State Warriors (17-16) pounced early and never looked back, dismantling a red-hot Philadelphia 76ers (13-19) with a commanding victory on January 3.

Golden State Warriors Top Performers:

Stephen Curry 30 PTS | 8-8 3PT | 10 AST | 53.2 FPS

Curry was nearly perfect from the field, recording his fourth 30+ point and 10+ assist production since last month. His recent performances have been a rollercoaster, but a favorable matchup ahead could see him maintain his elite level.

Draymond Green 15 PTS | 7 AST | 3 BLK | 38.7 FPS

Green overcame his ongoing back injury and delivered another well-rounded performance, his third in a row.

Jonathan Kuminga 20 PTS | 5 REB | 5 AST | 35.5 FPS

Kuminga is showing consistent growth, having put together four consecutive strong all-around games.

Dennis Schroder 15 PTS | 6 AST | 2 STL | 34.8 FPS

Schroder continues to struggle offensively but has managed to score in double figures in four of his last five games.

Andrew Wiggins 15 PTS | 7 REB | 4 AST | 31.4 FPS

Wiggins is battling a hamstring injury but played today. His scoring and rebounding have been on and off, but he remains a key contributor for blocks.

Philadelphia 76ers Top Performers:

Joel Embiid 28 PTS | 14 REB | 2 BLK | 54.8 FPS

Embiid continued his dominant run, averaging 31.0 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.5 stocks in his last four games.

Tyrese Maxey 14 PTS | 6 AST | 4 STL | 41.6 FPS

Maxey had a rare off night after averaging 29.6 points over his last eight games, but he remains a top-tier contributor. He’s been knocking down threes, staying reliable at the line, and showing noticeable growth on the defensive end.

Guerschon Yabusele 13 PTS | 6 REB | 2 AST | 23.2 FPS

Yabusele has settled into a steady role and has scored in double figures in five of his last six games.

Paul George 19 PTS | 3 3PT | 2 REB | 19.4 FPS

George turned in a disappointing performance, failing to contribute in any meaningful way outside of scoring.

Ricky Council IV 12 PTS | 2 REB | 1 AST | 15.9 FPS

Council has the ability to score and contribute defensively, but his playing time is limited.

Biggest Disappointment of the Game:

Buddy Hield 3 PTS | 1-5 3PT | 1 REB

Hield’s shooting has been a disaster lately, going just 3-for-26 over his last five games.
