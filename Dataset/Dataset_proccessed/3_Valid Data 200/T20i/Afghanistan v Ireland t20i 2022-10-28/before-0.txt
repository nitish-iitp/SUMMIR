Format: T20I

Venue: Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne

AFG vs IRE Preview
Ireland’s victory over England in their most recent match will boost their morale as they return to the same field.
Since they haven’t won a game, Afghanistan would be under pressure, and these circumstances don’t favor them.
Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie, Ireland’s starters, are in good shape, which increases the team’s chances.

 

On Friday afternoon, Match 25 of the 2022 T20 World Cup will feature Afghanistan vs. Ireland. After losing to England and having their match against New Zealand called off before a ball had been played, Afghanistan is still searching for their first victory of the season. On Wednesday, Ireland defeated England at this location in a memorable victory. The Super 12 stage match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground gets underway at 15:00 local time.

Although they have had trouble winning recently, Afghanistan still has a good record against Ireland overall. They’ll want to capitalize on Ireland’s supposedly weak spot against fast bowling.

After defeating England in their most recent game, Ireland will feel certain they can defeat any team in this championship. They defeated Afghanistan in their most recent IT20 match, so they will be very confident going into this game.

AFG vs IRE Weather Report

The weather for Friday afternoon in Melbourne is expected to be extremely muggy and rainy.

AFG vs IRE Match Toss Prediction

Although Ireland defeated England on Wednesday by electing to bat first, we anticipate that both captains will opt to field first for this game.

AFG vs IRE Pitch Report

The vast boundaries in Melbourne are challenging to clear, thus it is never the simplest venue to bat. You may anticipate that the surface will provide grip for the spinners and assistance to quick bowlers.

Given the predicted bad weather, this may end up being a rain-shortened match with very little batting time for both teams.
