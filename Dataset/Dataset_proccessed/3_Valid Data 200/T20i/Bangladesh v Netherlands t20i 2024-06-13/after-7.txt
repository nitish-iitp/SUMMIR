Goodbye for now!

That’s it from our live coverage of Bangladesh against Netherlands.

It’s in Bangladesh’s own hands now ahead of their final match against Nepal.

We’re all gearing up for the big one on Friday between USA and Ireland, which could seal Pakistan’s fate.

Do join us for that one if you can.

For now, though – from me, Kevin Hand – it’s goodbye.

Next up on Al Jazeera

USA against Ireland on Friday is our next live action on Al Jazeera.

Anything other than a defeat for USA will see them qualify and Pakistan depart the tournament.

The forecast is not great and a point will be enough for the co-hosts.

‘Shakib’s calmness was the key’

Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto is all smiles and lauds his team for “showing character in a very important game”.

“Shakib’s calmness was key to our innings on a pitch where we didn’t know what would be a good score to defend,” he said after the match.

Shanto said he’s happy with the venue and has no complaints.

“It’s a very good outfield. The wicket was a bit difficult early on, but it was still really good to bat on.”

‘Super Eight progression a little bit out of our hands’

The Netherlands’ captain Scott Edwards said his team were not up to the mark in “all three facets of the game”.

“We weren’t up to it,” he said after the match.

“[Bangladesh] kept wickets in hand in the last five overs. It was always going to be hard bowling with windy boundaries.”

Edwards said his batters wanted to have a strong run in the middle overs.

“We knew they quality bowlers at death so we tried to get those runs through the middle.”

With Bangladesh moving ahead of them on the points table, Edwards admitted Super Eights progression is “a little bit out of [our] hands now.”

Nepal could still topple Bangladesh

Nepal have only played twice and have one point from the washout with Sri Lanka.

Their final game is against Bangladesh, which could be a thriller, but first up, it’s South Africa.

‘Rishad took the game away from the Netherlands’

Shakib al-Hasan, Bangladesh’s hero with the bat, says the wicket wasn’t easy in the beginning.

“It was important for someone from the top four to bat through, so I’m happy I could do it,” he tells the tournament broadcasters.

“We posted a challenging total – 160 is always a good score in a World Cup game.”

The veteran player praised young leg-spinner Rishad Hossain for bringing his side back in the game when the Netherlands seemed to be sailing away.

“Rishad took the game away from the Netherlands, so credit to him and the bowlers.”
