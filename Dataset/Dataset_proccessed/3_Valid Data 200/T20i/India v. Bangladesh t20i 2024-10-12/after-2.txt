Suryakumar Yadav revealed Gautam Gambhir’s strong message to the Indian team before the T20I series against Bangladesh. On Saturday, October 12, India beat Bangladesh by 133 runs in the third and final game at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.

Suryakumar said that India wanted to have cricketers who are selfless and not worry much about personal landmarks. He heaped praise on Sanju Samson for playing his shots freely and helping India post a massive score of 297 for the loss of six wickets.

Samson racked up the second-fastest hundred by an Indian in T20Is and went on to score 111 runs off 47 balls with 11 fours and eight sixes. He was also involved in a partnership of 173 runs for the second wicket with Suryakumar.

"I think we've achieved a lot as a team. Had said wanted to have selfless cricketers and want to be a selfless team, enjoy each others' performances. That camaraderie is coming off. Gauti bhai said the same thing before the series that no one is bigger than the team, no matter you are on 49 or 99, you have to hit the ball out of the field. That's what Sanju did today,” Suryakumar said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Suryakumar, who became the second-fastest Indian to the landmark of 2500 T20I runs, also talked about the importance of players needing to be flexible to build more options in the line-up.

“We have to be flexible when it comes to batting and bowling. Bowlers who can have to chip in. Batters have to be flexible and their performances were commendable,” Suryakumar added.

After posting the mammoth score, India restricted Bangladesh to 164 for seven. Ravi Bishnoi was the pick of the bowlers for them with figures of 4-1-30-3. Mayank Yadav also impressed with two wickets to his name.
