Hyderabad: India's Washington Sundar celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Bangladesh's Tanzid Hasan during the third and final T20 International cricket match between India and Bangladesh at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, in Hyderabad, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024.

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Highlights: Sanju Samson’s 40-ball hundred and quickfire knocks from Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya powered India to a 133-run win against Bangladesh in the third and final T20I at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.

The series sweep was completed after India put on a record 297-run total on the back of a superb batting performance before the bowlers restricted Bangladesh to 164.

Batting first, India were off to a quickfire start on the back of Samson’s measured attack. The opener also tonked five consecutive sixes off Rishad Hossain before motoring to his maiden T20I ton. Hardik and Riyan Parag added the final touches as India smacked 22 sixes to deflate Bangladesh.

The Men in Blue were hardly ruffled in the previous two encounters in Delhi and Gwalior, where their all-round efforts proved too much for Bangladesh. Najmul Shanto’s men have struggled with the bat, failing to tonk maximums at the same rate as India in the series.

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Ravi Bishnoi

Bishnoi, India's youngest bowler to reach 50 T20I wickets, speaks: Feeling great with this small milestone. It's a good pressure when you have a healthy competition in the team. I wanted to make the most of this opportunity. It feels good to see the game from the outside as well. You need to work on yourself and work on things accordingly. I had a break for a few days, so I tried to make the most of it

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Clean sweep in Hyderabad

The off-side field in the circle is packed and yet Nitish offers width that Hridoy uses to tap over point for FOUR. Low full-toss from Nitish and Towhid toes it down the ground. Riyan Parag steams in from long-on and nearly pulls off a blinder before the final delivery. Terrific commitment in the field. India beat Bangladesh by 133 runs, clinching the series 3-0. The fireworks go off in Hyderabad.

22:38 (IST)

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: 19th over

Mayank Yadav fails to nail down a wicket to finish his quota. Attempts a deft slower delivery to finish as the batters sneak in a tight single. Only a matter of six deliveries now. 

22:31 (IST)

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: WICKET!

Bishnoi to Rishad, OUT! Third one for Bishnoi and the extra bounce off the deck doing the damage again. Rishad simply got height and no distance on that. That is where Samson and Suryakumar were on a higher grade tonight, taking on spin and that extra bounce from the surface expertly. Short from Bishnoi and Hridoy wallops it over wide long-on for SIX.

Rishad Hossain c Abhishek Sharma b Ravi Bishnoi 0 

22:26 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: WICKET!

Nitish to Mahedi, OUT! A slower delivery from Nitish and Mahedi taps it straight down to the long-on fielder. Easy for Parag in the deep as Bangladesh fritter away. The change of pace works for Nitish as he completes the over, conceding only three from it.

Mahedi Hasan c Parag b Nitish Kumar Reddy 3 (9b)

22:23 (IST)

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Runs dry up

Varun Chakaravarthy constricts Mahedi with a splash of his variations. Four dots and a single before Hridoy retains strike with one run. BAN 135/5 in 16 overs

22:19 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Mahmudullah perishes

Mayank Yadav to Mahmudullah, OUT! Mahmudullah attempts to take on the pace but he sends it straight to the long-on fielder. That's it for Bangladesh's most capped T20I player in the format. Mahmudullah trudges back in despair in what was his final T20I. Mahedi Hasan is in at 7.

Mahmudullah c Parag b MP Yadav 8 (9b 1x4)

22:16 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Hridoy battles on

Hridoy has worked out some interesting angles to earn his runs here. Chakaravarthy darts the ball in yet again and Hridoy creams it behind square for FOUR. Bangladesh are well out of the chase already but at least there isn't a complete surrender as yet.

22:08 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: WICKET!

Bishnoi is in the mood tonight and he makes up for lost time with his second wicket. Flatter delivery and Litton slaps it straight to the deep mid-wicket fielder. 50 wickets for Bishnoi - the second fastest Indian to the mark. A decent partnership comes to an end as Mahmudullah walks in.

Litton Das c sub (NT Tilak Varma) b Ravi Bishnoi 42 (25b 8x4)

21:53 (IST)

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Abhishek rolls his arm

Interesting from SKY to hand Abhishek Sharma the ball. He skims through a tidy over as Litton Das makes room to carve the ball through extra cover for a FOUR. BAN 94/3 in 10 overs

21:49 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: BAN keep a fight on

Chakaravarthy attempts a rare leg-break and Towhid Hridoy belts it over mid-wicket for SIX! Varun immediately checks his lines with quicker deliveries. Nine from the over. BAN 86/3 in 9 overs

21:46 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: A rare fumble

Bishnoi's pace has kept the batters on their toes. A touch of width outside the off-stump but Litton glides the ball through short-third with the pace. A sloppy effort from Mayank Yadav has conceded FOUR runs. BAN 77/3 in 8 overs

21:42 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Shanto's brain-fade

Ravi Bishnoi to Najmul Shanto! OUT! He really cannot keep the reverse-sweep within himself, can he? Bishnoi sends in a quick slider down leg as Shanto unfurls the reverse-sweep, only for it to get the top-edge. Easy catch for Samson.

Najmul Hossain Shanto c †Samson b Ravi Bishnoi 14 (11b 1x4 1x6) 

21:32 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Litton unleashed

Nitish Kumar Reddy into the attack

Fuller delivery outside the off-stump and Litton Das flays the first ball through extra cover for FOUR. Shortens his length and Litton works it behind square for FOUR. Short delivery outside off and Litton has all the time to smear it through extra cover for FOUR. FOUR more as Litton slaps a length ball through point. Nitish is erring in his lines here, offering enough width for Litton. Make that five in the over. Nitish offers another loosener and Litton leans into a slap over cover for FOUR! BAN 59/2 in 5 overs

21:29 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: WICKET

Washington Sundar into the attack

Sundar to Tanzid, OUT! A cut straight to short-third. A bit of extra bounce off the deck for Sundar and Tanzid's slice lobs up to the fielder. Ltton Das walks in at 4.

Tanzid Hasan c Varun b Washington Sundar 15 (12b 3x4)

21:28 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Mayank errs

Mayank is a bit all over the place tonight, losing his lines for a wide before overstepping to concede a no-ball. Shanto has also creamed a couple of boundaries, a six and a four, using the extra pace off Mayank.

21:19 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Tanzid gives a charge

Tanzid heaves Hardik for a couple of deliveries across the line and fetches two FOURs. He's a bit fortunate with the first of those hits after Washington Sundar spills a catch in the deep. BAN 17/1 in 2 overs

21:07 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: WICKET first ball!

Parvez Emon and Tanzid Hassan open the batting for Bangladesh. Mayank Yadav takes the new ball tonight.

Mayank to Emon, OUT! A rip-snorter from Mayank first up and Emon cannot break out of that bumper. The ball lobs up straight to first slip and Mayank strikes straightaway! Najmul Shanto walks in at 3. 

Parvez Hossain Emon c Parag b MP Yadav 0 (1b)

21:04 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Back for the chase

India have obliterated Bangladesh with that spellbinding attack in what one would otherwise call a 'dead rubber'. Samson, Suryakumar and Hardik gave no respite for the poor lengths and tactics from the Bangladesh bowlers on a belter of a pitch.

20:50 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: India storm to record 297!

Can India get to 300? Hardik tonks another SIX over deep extra cover, waiting on that slower-bumper from Tanzim and nailing it to perfection. Tanzim to Hardik, OUT! Yorker and a reflex helicopter but a one-handed stunner at long-off stops Hardik short of his fifty. Tanzim to Nitish Kumar Reddy, OUT! He falls first ball. Short ball onto the body and Nitish pulls it straight to the square-leg fielder. Birthday boy Rinku whacks the final delivery for SIX and India finish on 297 - the highest T20I score by a Full-Member side! 

20:44 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Parag falls

In the air and caught? Oh wait, it's a SIX! A fine grab at the long-on fence off Parag's slog but Tamim fails to stay within the ropes. A gentle nudge and Parag gets away yet again. Matters worsen for Bangladesh and Taskin as he oversteps but he follows up with two yorkers. Taskin to Parag, OUT! He finally runs out of lives as he attempts to ramp Taskin past the keeper. A gentle feather and Litton holds onto it. Rinku Singh is in, can India get to 300? Taskin helps the cause with another no-ball. A single follows before Hardik's rash slice flies over short-third for FOUR. IND 282/4 in 19 overs

20:40 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: When it is not your day...

Bangladesh are shell-shocked and nothing will tell you that more than the last two deliveries. A fumble between Hardik and Parag would have surely ended up in a run-out at the non-striker's any other day but not tonight. Parag offers them a chance to redeem themselves next delivery with a miscued hit but  Emon spills a catch as he runs in from long-on. Hardik rubs in more salt onto the wounds as he smacks another SIX down the ground. India record their highest T20 total!

20:33 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: 250 up for IND!

Mahedi offers a full-toss and Parag wallops it over mid-wicket for a massive SIX. He strays to the pads this time and Parag biffs it squarer for FOUR. Bangladesh are jaded and out of this contest already. Slot, slot and there's another one in the arc and Parag crunches it over long-on for a 111m SIX! 250 up for India!

20:28 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Hardik on fire

Hardik has been in supreme confidence all series in terms of striking. Tanzim feeds him a full-toss and Hardik tosses it over mid-wicket for SIX! Unreal hitting. Hardik has matched up to Samson's shot from earlier on in the innings here. Tanzim has darted in a yorker and Hardk flays it over extra cover for SIX, standing deep in the crease. The bottom-hand muscle doing all the talking there. IND 234/3 in 16 overs

20:24 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: WICKET!

Mahmudullah slides the ball down leg and Suryakumar drags it past fine-leg for FOUR. Mahmudullah to Suryakumar, OUT! Gone this time. Flatter delivery with extra bounce off the deck and Suryakumar's attempt to heave the ball across lands in the mid-wicket fielder's hands. A stupendous knock from the skipper. Rarely overshadowed on his day but Suryakumar has done his bit. Hardik Pandya walks in. IND 213/3 in 15 overs

Suryakumar Yadav c Rishad Hossain b Mahmudullah 75 (35b 8x4 5x6)

20:21 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Samson departs

Mustafizur to Samson, OUT! The carnage ends. Samson fails to clear the leg-cutter from Fizz this time over mid-wicket. Suryakumar embraces him as he trudges back. Samson takes a huge monkey off his back with this knock and gets a standing ovation from the crowd. Riyan Parag is in at 4.

Sanju Samson c Mahedi Hasan b Mustafizur Rahman 111 (47b 11x4 8x6)

20:12 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: HUNDRED FOR SAMSON

100 for Sanju Samson in only 40 balls as he drills Mahedi down the ground for FOUR. It is the second quickest hundred by an Indian, only bettered by Rohit Sharma's 35-ball ton against Sri Lanka in 2017. Sublime knock with absolute purity in shot-making. IND 190/1 in 13 overs

20:05 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: 12th over

Taskin sends in a beamer and immediately raises a hand of apology. Now that was not going to deter SKY who smites the very next delivery over cover for SIX! Taskin attempts to vary his lengths and sides to both Samson and SKY to make amends. Only a couple of singles to end the over. IND 179/1 in 12 overs

20:02 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Is 300 on the cards?

Mind you, it is very well on the cards. 300, that is. Suryakumar has motored past his fifty now and the balls are simply pinging off Samson's blade. IND 166/1 in 11 overs

19:58 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Sixes galore

Samson in otherwordly mode now. Rishad errs by offering deliveries in the slot one and Samson goes on and produces his best moment in international colours. Five sixes in a row, in a spectacular arc between long-off and long-on, and Samson moves into the 90s. IND 152/1 in 10 overs

19:48 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Clobbering time

No half-measures here. SKY and Samson are expertly picking lengths to smoke out of the ground. Mahedi goes flat in the air and Suryakumar has foreseen a might swing over wide long-on for SIX. 

A stopppage in play as one of the floodlights has gone off. Back on after the delay. SKY and Samson finish the over with a couple of singles. IND 122/1 in 9 overs

19:46 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: SHOT from Samson!

Sanju Samson has perhaps played the SHOT of the series there. Mustafizur sprays the ball with angle across the turf and Samson arching back in his open stance flays it over cover for an audacious SIX! 83m that too. The languidity in movement. All class there from, SS. IND 113/1 in 8 overs.

Sanju Samson on a roll! ?

A MAXIMUM over extra-cover off the back foot ?

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Samson unleashed

Sanju Samson gets to a 22-ball FIFTY on the back off two exquisite shots on the off-side against Rishad Hossain. He muscles the leg-break over long-off and gets to his half-century and pumps his fists in delight. That surely has meant a lot to him. IND 98/1 in 7 overs

FIFTY off just 22 deliveries ?

This has been an entertaining knock so far from Sanju Samson! ??

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Record Powerplay for India

Tanzim zips the ball in sharply and Samson gets away with a leading edge towards cover, quick single to rotate strike. Tanzim overpitches and Suryakumar drills the ball down the ground for FOUR. Carnage unleashed! Suryakumar has found his feet and he is unleashing a brutal assault here. He biffs a length delivery over long-on for SIX and nimbly flicks one through mid-wicket for another FOUR. Thwack! Six more over mid-wicket from SKY and India equal their highest T20I Powerplay score.

19:29 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Samson and SKY clobber Taskin

Samson continues to use the depth of the crease adeptly to disrupt the lengths of the bowlers. Taskin angles it in yet again as Samson makes room and hacks it through mid-wicket for a fifth FOUR off him in successive overs. Taskin darts in a yorker and Samson digs it out for a single. Length delivery and there comes out another SKY hook for SIX past fine-leg. IND 63/1 in 5 overs

19:20 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Samson on song

Mustafizur Rahman into the attack

He starts with the leg-cutter from over the wicket and beats Samson's outside-edge. This will be a tricky phase for Samson to counter. Another slower delivery and Samson mistimes the pull towards the mid-on fielder, no run. Samson remains rooted to the crease, anticipating the slower ball on length. He gets right in his arc as he makes space for the pull and another FOUR. Leg-cutter in the slot and Samson pummels the ball straight down the ground for SIX! He follows up with a single to backward square. IND 47/1 in 4 overs

19:14 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: WICKET!

Tanzim Hasan into the attack

Tanzim to Abhishek, OUT! The short ball ploy works instantly. Tanzim cramps up Abhishek and the mistimed pull lobs up straigh to the mid-wicket fielder. Abhishek's series comes to a disappointing end as Suryakumar Yadav walks in at 3. A full swinging yorker and the ball deflects off Suryakumar's back toe. But Bangladesh appeal for an lbw and go up for a review. Poor call that as the ball is pitching outside leg. You cannot probably try to bump SKY out, Tanzim. A loose short ball towards the front shoulder and Suryakumar parries it over the keeper for SIX! A stoppage in play as the Zing bails falter. Tanzim skids the ball through to the pads and Suryakumar clips it through square for FOUR, beating the fielder in the deep. IND 35/1 in 3 overs

Abhishek Sharma c Mahedi Hasan b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 4 (4b 1x4)

19:07 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Samson 4,4,4,4

Taskin Ahmed into the attack

Taskin goes for the stumps straightaway and Samson taps it to the mid-off fielder. Samson shows the bowler all three stumps and smears the fuller delivery through cover for FOUR. Back-of-a-length delivery and Samson slaps it exquisitely through extra cover for FOUR more! There goes another one. Taskin strays to the pads and Samson flicks elegantly through mid-wicket for FOUR. Make that 4 in a row. Slower-delivery onto the pads. Samson waits on it and flicks it past backward square-leg for another FOUR. IND 23/0 in 2 overs

19:02 (IST)
12 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Abhishek goes over cover

Spin to start proceedings, Mahedi Hasan takes the new ball. Samson on strike. 

Short delivery onto the pads and Samson nudgs it towards short mid-wicket. Another short ball and Samson drags it to wide long-on for two runs. Samson follows up with a drive to mid-off for a single. It only takes Abhishek two balls to step out and wallop a drag-down delivery through extra cover for FOUR. IND 7/0 in 1 over

19:01 (IST)

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Focus on Samson

He may have the team management's backing for his aggressive intent but life could be pretty tough for Sanju Samson without a high-impact knock here. Can he light up Hyderabad, a venue where he scored an IPL ton back in 2019, tonight?

TOSS: India win the toss and opt to bat

Suryakumar: We would like to bat firsst, looks a good wicket. These are the things we want to do. Set a target and defend the total with dew around. I think it's important to continue with the good habits, it will have a good impact on us. We just want to give freedom, the guys want to make an impact. Happy with the way the guys are playing. Arshdeep misses out, Bishnoi comes in.

Shanto: I am happy to bowl first, toss doesn't matter. We have two changes. Tamim and Mahedi are in. We need to take responsibilities as batters. We need to improve, need to execute our plans. Hopefully we do something special in the 40 overs.

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Pitch Report

It's a high-scoring venue. 63m and 68m square boundaries. 77m down the ground. There is a bit of moisture and it looks a touch soft because of the overnight rain. The pitch is a mix of red and black soil. It's still a flat pitch, but there will be assistance for the bowlers, says Abhinav Mukund.

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Can Abhishek bring the SRH vibe?

Abhishek Sharma lit up the IPL in Hyderabad for SRH last season. The Punjab left-hander smashed 284 runs at the venue at an astounding  249.12 strike-rate. Abhishek has had a quiet series so far where a run-out in the first match even prompted his mentor Yuvraj Singh to make a cheeky dig at him.

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Bangladesh's 'genetics' problem

Bangladesh's assistant coach Nic Pothas has pinned the blame on the genetics for the Tigers' poor six-hitting record. “They have much stronger players. We are working on our strength and conditioning, but you can’t fight genetics," Pothas told reporters on Friday.

“If one player weighs 95-100 kg and another is 65 kg, naturally the heavier player will hit the ball further. Of course, timing and technique are important, and we are constantly working on those aspects,” he added.

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: The making of Nitish Kumar Reddy!

The Nitish Kumar Reddy show was expected at some point, but boy did he light up the Arun Jaitley Stadium in some style in the previous game. Nitish's blistering 74 was the second-highest score by an Indian before turning 21. The Andhra all-rounder has been touted as the next Hardik Pandya, but he emerged from the age-group circuit as a record-breaking batter who idolised Virat Kohli. Here is Tanishq Vaddi and Sandip G retracing Nitish Kumar Reddy's cricketing journey

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Bangladesh's sixes woes

India and Bangladesh have been poles apart in terms of their striking abilities. The hosts have smashed 22 sixes in only two games while Bangladesh have only managed two sixes on two decent batting surfaces so far.

The IPL 2024 season in Hyderabad saw a torrent of maximums. 136 sixes were hit in only six IPL games in Hyderabad last season, with an average of 22 sixes/game.

India vs Bangladesh 3rd T20 Live: Ten Doeschate backs Samson

Sanju Samson may have appeared to squander two starts in the previous two games in Gwalior and Delhi. But he has found the backing as an opener from India's assistant coach, Ryan ten Doeschate.

“If you look back at the first two games, Sanju, getting a quick start in the first game in Gwalior would have been easy for him to knock it around and get a fifty. But you can see he's trying to push the boundary, and the messaging has been pretty consistent with that. We want guys to expand their own game, we want to move cricket forward like it is going at the time, and we want to be prepared for the big crunch moments that are coming up in the next 18 months,” Doeschate remarked on Friday.

Even Nitish Kumar Reddy, a single player, hit as many sixes as the entire Bangladesh team. When asked about this difference, Bangladesh's assistant coach, Nic Pothas, blamed it on genetics.

He said that Indian players are naturally stronger and have better genetics for hitting sixes. Pothas said that Bangladesh is working on strength and conditioning, but they cannot compete with the genetics of Indian players. He also said that heavier players tend to hit the ball further, but timing and technique are also important. Bangladesh is constantly working on improving these aspects of their game.(READ MORE)
