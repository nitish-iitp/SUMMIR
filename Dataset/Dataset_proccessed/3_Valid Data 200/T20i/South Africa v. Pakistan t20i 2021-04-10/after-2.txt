South Africa vs Pakistan 1st T20 Live Cricket Score Streaming: After beating South Africa in the ODI series, an upbeat Pakistan will look to continue their winning run when they take on the Proteas in the first T20 at The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg. South Africa have a depleted squad with Quinton de Kock, David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Anrich Nortje all leaving for IPL after the second of the three ODIs against Pakistan. Adding more misery is an injury to Temba Bavuma. Reeza Hendricks has also withdrawn on paternity grounds. Hence, skipper Klassen has a tough task at hand.

For Pakistan, it is yet another chance to assert their authority and win their fifth series. Earlier, Opener Fakhar Zaman hit a second successive century to help Pakistan win the deciding one-day international against South Africa by 28 runs and take the series 2-1 on Wednesday. Fakhar made 101 and captain Babar Azam 94 from 82 balls to propel Pakistan to 320-7 batting first at SuperSport Park. South Africa was 292 all out as three players made half-centuries but none converted them to big scores.
