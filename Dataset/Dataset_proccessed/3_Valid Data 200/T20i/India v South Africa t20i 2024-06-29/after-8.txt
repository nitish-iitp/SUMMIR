T20 WORLD CUP: INDIA CLAIM STUNNING WIN OVER SOUTH AFRICA TO TAKE TITLE, DESPITE HEINRICH KLAASEN'S BATTING HEROICS
BYJAMES HILSUM

UPDATED 29/06/2024 AT 20:22 GMT

The ICC Men's T20 World Cup reached an incredible climax at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, as this superb India side overcame South Africa with an enthralling seven-run triumph. Heinrich Klaasen broke the record for the fastest half-century in a T20 World Cup final, but ended up on the losing side. The bowling of Hardik Pandya, Arshdeep Singh, and Jasprit Bumrah proved crucial to India's win.

Rohit Sharma of India lifts the ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup Trophy following the ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup West Indies & USA 2024 Final match between South Africa and India at Kensington Oval on June 29, 2024 in Bridgetown, Barbados

India won the T20 World Cup for a second time after a pulsating seven-run victory over South Africa at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.
Rohit Sharma’s side showed their class after recovering from an inauspicious start at 34-3 to finish with an ultimately unassailable 176 to seal their first title since 2007.

South Africa admirably faced the daunting task of needing 177 runs to win, but fell short after being restricted to 169-8.

YESTERDAY AT 16:19

It looked like being a different story when The Proteas made rapid inroads into India’s top order, following some blistering bowling which reduced India to a measly 34-3 after 4.3 overs.
But India rallied superbly from that point, and consolidated with an impressive fourth-wicket stand of 72 runs between Axar Patel and Virat Kohli.
The stubbornness of Axar and Kohli helped India on their way to a highly respectable total - the latter scoring 76 runs off 59 balls, including six fours and two sixes, to test South Africa’s resolve.
Kohli continued stoically after Patel was run out by Quinton de Kock, and another sizeable stand of 57 with Shivam Dube sapped South Africa’s energy even more.
He was eventually sent packing after taking 76 runs from 59 balls, as he was caught by Kagiso Rabada off the bowling of Marco Jansen.  
Dube and Ravindra Jadeja were the last two to go, leaving South Africa needing 177 runs to lift what would have been their first T20 World Cup title.
This would involve achieving the highest T20 international chase on this ground, and a fast start was needed.
Their cause was not helped by Reeza Hendricks and Aiden Markram both falling to Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh respectively, leaving South Africa at 12-2.
De Kock and Tristan Stubbs provided a much-needed third-wicket stand of 58, which ended when the latter was bowled for 31.
South Africa reached the 100 mark when Heinrich Klaasen hit his third six of the afternoon, and India's total seemed more attainable.
The key wicket of De Kock followed after his attempt for a six went straight into the hands of Kuldeep Yadav.
Klaasen’s huge hitting was turning the tide in South Africa’s favour, and The Proteas plundered 24 runs in a costly 15th over for India.
But just when South Africa thought they had genuine hope, Klassen was caught by an outside edge to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant off Hardik Pandya.

Bumrah beautifully bowled Jansen for just two, but the moment of the final came when Suryakumar Yadav took one of the great catches in World Cup history at long-off to stun South Africa.
David Miller has so often seen teams home with the bat and South Africa's hopes rested on his shoulders.
He climbed into a full toss from Pandya, but could only watch on in bewilderment as Yadav pouched the ball on the boundary edge, before having the presence of mind to flick it into the air, step over the rope and back into the field of play again before completing the catch.
A review was required, but Miller had to go once the catch was confirmed and India closed out the match five balls later as South Africa's wait for a World Cup win continued.
