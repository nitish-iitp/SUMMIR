'A big win for us'
published at 19:11 British Summer Time 8 June 2024
19:11 BST 8 June 2024

South Africa captain Aiden Markram: "We've got to give a lot of credit to how the Netherlands played, we knew they'd be up for a scrap. They applied a lot of pressure to us.

"It is a game of cricket ultimately and they've proven many times they can beat the best teams in the world. There isn't a mental block or anything and once a team gets a bit of momentum, particularly the Netherlands, they make things quite tricky. It shows we're moving forward as a squad and dealing with these things better.

"It is big for us. The wins aren't always going to be pretty and convincing but if you look at 12-4 not many people are giving us a chance from there and it is massive for the team, environment and confidence to win.

"We've been good with the ball and in the field, lots of energy. The top order need to take responsibility when given the opportunity to."

'We were one wicket away'

Netherlands captain Scott Edwards: "Obviously extremely close. With 110 on the board, only an over can change a game. Credit to South Africa, they bowled extremely well. We had a nice partnership but then they batted extremely well at the end.

On the pitch: "It's hard to tell. There was more in it in the start but it was just different.

On the Netherlands' form: "I think we pride ourselves on playing good tournament cricket. It is probably a little bit about that, but not to be today."

How long did you have faith for?: "Right until that last six, I back our guys. I felt like we were one wicket away. If we got David [Miller], we would've had a shot."

'A good finish in the end'

Player of the match, South Africa's David Miller: "My heart is a whole lot better now! It was a good finish in the end I suppose.

"The pitch played a bit better than the first game. Credit to the Netherlands guys, they bowled really well and hit an area really well. Me and Stubbo [Tristan Stubbs] just needed to create something and keep the scoreboard ticking along.

"It was a low total so we wanted to show some intent and not go into our shell but they made it difficult but we just ground it out as well as we could.

"We have got over the line with our tailenders in the past so I had faith in the boys. I felt the first ball of the penultimate over made me feel like we could finish the game."

It wasn't a very David Miller-like innings but that shows the calmness in his head.

He knew exactly what he was doing not taking the single off the last ball of the 18th over.

With two overs to go, South Africa needed 18 runs to win and David Miller has found all of them with seven balls of the innings to spare.

That is exactly why they didn't run off the last ball of the previous over.

It has been a gritty innings from David Miller but he is doing the job here.

Brilliant from Miller. He's just proved exactly why Maharaj did not take that single.

Bowled! Brilliant from Van Beek!

Jansen went to smash it through the covers. Instead, Van Beek beats the bat and castles the top of middle stump.

Suddenly, the Netherlands gain a big confidence boost.

Thwack!

A massive shot from David Miller brings his side less than 20 away from the target.

Clipped off the leg side and it absolutely flies over deep square leg for six.

As long as Miller stays in, South Africa can feel confident.

A brilliant over from Bas de Leede with a wicket and only four runs coming from it.

A blow however for South Africa as the short ball to end the over catches new batter Marco Jansen's hip and he is now receiving treatment.
