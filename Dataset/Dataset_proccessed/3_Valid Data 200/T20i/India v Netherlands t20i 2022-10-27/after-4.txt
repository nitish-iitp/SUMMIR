India captain Rohit Sharma: When you're expected to win, the pressure is a lot more. This was a near-perfect game for us. Won't say we were in a spot of bother at the start, wicket was on the slower side and we couldn't play our shots right at the start. With the ball, we were clinical. I'm not entirely happy with the way I batted, wouldn't say it was a perfect knock. Just to get some runs under my belt was good. Have to get runs, good looking or ugly looking, doesn't matter. Important to keep that confidence ticking.

Netherlands captain Scott Edwards: Definitely the noisiest crowd I've played in front of. It was an awesome experience. It was always going to be tricky chasing 180. Thought we bowled reasonably well, if you don't get wickets, with the batting order they've got, would've been tough to restrict. Looking forward now to our game against Pakistan.

Suryakumar Yadav is Player of the Match for his 25-ball 51* "Just wanted to express myself. Message was loud and clear when I went in to bat. Wanted to go at 8-10 an over. Enjoying batting with Kohli."

He made his name with his end-overs yorkers, but over his short international career so far, Arshdeep Singh has shown he has other weapons too. New-ball swing, for one, and also a mean bouncer, writes Karthik Krishnaswamy in our #LiveReport.

9.30pm India coast to a win in the end to go top of Group 2. Netherlands have bowled and fielded well, but were shortchanged with the bat on the face of some top class bowling from India.

Bhuvneshwar, Arshdeep, Shami - all of them hit their straps with the new ball. Ashwin and Axar, who bowled all of four overs between them against Pakistan, had a good workout with the ball.

Arshdeep Singh to van Meekeren, FOUR runs

Drilled down the ground, beats mid-off and Netherlands finish with three back-to-back boundaries.

19.5

Arshdeep Singh to van Meekeren, FOUR runs

Top-edge and four more! Does well to dig it in and angle it towards the batter's head, van Meekeren is off balance as he swings hard and gets a top edge that flies over the keeper's head

Arshdeep Singh to van Meekeren, no run

Fires in an excellent yorker but the batter is struck outside the line of leg as it comes honing in. Good ball, but not good enough for the hat-trick. Hands on heads, a wry smile, he knows it's a chance missed.

Arshdeep on a hat-trick. He'll bowl from around the wicket

Arshdeep Singh to Klaassen, OUT

Comes from around the wicket and floors Klaasen with another rip roaring yorker that strikes him on the pad. Big appeal from Arshdeep, but this isn't given. India review Replays confirm this was definitely a lot closer than it appeared in real time. The umpire wasn't convinced, Arshdeep definitely was. India eventually took the review literally at the last second. Ball tracking comes back to show this would've crashed into leg stump. So Arshdeep gets a second in the over.

Arshdeep Singh to van Beek, OUT

Does him with a superb bouncer! Van Beek really late on the pull, ends up toe-ending this to DK behind the stumps. He made the mistake of looking to pull him off the front foot. Arshdeep did superbly well to dig it in and get that to zip off the pitch. This has been an excellent over from him.
