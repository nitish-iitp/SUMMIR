That's all from us here today, but thank you for following us throughout an enthralling contest.

We'll leave you with the winning moment, and you can read Matthew Henry's match report from Saint Lucia if you missed any of the action.

But there's still plenty more cricket to enjoy. Join us for our live coverage of West Indies v USA which starts at 1:30 BST tomorrow morning, a game that could have big implications for England's qualification hopes.

Bye for now!

It's pretty ominous if South Africa haven't played their complete game yet. These tense wins will give them a huge amount of confidence if they are going to shake their reputation of losing it in big games.

Their bowling attack of Jansen, Nortje, Rabada, Maharaj, Baartman and Shamsi (when selected) is a pretty formidable one.

South Africa captain Aiden Markam: "Getting to those last three overs and it looks like the odds are against you, to hang in there and get the win shows a lot of skill, but it comes from a lot deeper than that. Fighting spirit really helped us today.

"I thought the powerplay was decent but the pitch definitely got slower. We probably wanted another 10-20 runs if we are being greedy so we knew we had to squeeze them in the field.

"We are getting closer to the complete game. We are not there yet but we are on the right track.

"We have trust in each guy on the day that they can put in a performance. We are not looking too deeply, just letting them express themselves.

"You want to give the bowler's the freedom to bowl their best balls, but you have to give credit to Liam and Brooky, they put us under the pump."

On his catch: "I'll take it, I'm grateful it stuck. Happy to hold on and it made a big difference."

So, South Africa are sitting pretty at the top of group two with wins over the West Indies and now England.

Jos Buttler's men still hold second spot but West Indies could still take them on net run-rate if they win their final two games, and England don't beat USA by a huge margin.

In group one, Australia and India join South Africa in the unbeaten club (India had one game washed out in the group stage). They look like strong favourites to go through over Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

'De Kock's innings was the difference'
published at 19:17 British Summer Time 21 June 2024
19:17 BST 21 June 2024

England captain Jos Buttler: "I'd say it was lost in the powerplay. Quinton de Kock came out and played with really good intent and we couldn't really match that. I think we were about 20 behind them at the end of our first six.

"The wicket did slow up, which allowed us to pull it back in the middle and we were happy to be chasing 160. But yeah, that innings was the difference.

"It's still a good pitch but a little slower than we probably expected. I'm proud of how we responded with the ball after their good powerplay, and Brook and Livingstone had an excellent partnership there to take us so close. At one stage we were favourites but T20 cricket is never that simple, and credit to South Africa for closing it out.

"We restricted a really powerful line-up to what we thought was a par score so that was a great effort.

"It was important for those two to get that time in the middle, for Liam in particular, but he's very understanding that it's how T20 cricket goes sometimes if you're batting at 5, 6, 7. He handles it well, but he's hitting the ball brilliantly in the nets and took it into the middle today.

"We know we're still in it. We played well today, we just didn't quite get over the line."

Some of the catching on display today has been very special.

Here are just a few of the best.

Player of the match, South Africa's Quinton de Kock: "We have seen a couple of night games here but the surface plays differently at night than it does during the day. They can be two very different surfaces.

"My plan was to just bat as long as I can and score as many runs I can. That was pretty much it. I don't really carry or lose confidence, I just get on with my game. So that is what I focused on.

"I thought we bowled really well, especially in the powerplay. We controlled it really nicely. Overall we were pretty solid and to defend on 160 on a decent pitch is a good effort."

England were in real trouble at 61-4 after 10 overs.

But Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone went on a rampage towards the end, smashing 52 balls from three overs at one stage.

From nowhere, England were in with a shout until Aiden Markram pulled off a sensational piece of work to get rid of Brook and swing the game back in South Africa's favour.

As Steven Finn says, England are not out of contention yet - but they need a big win against the USA which will put them in a good position. But if West Indies beat the USA and South Africa, it could come down to net run-rate.

But for the Proteas, that will give them confidence. It was a proper graft, a real team effort.

Quinton de Kock led the way with the bat, David Miller backed him up. There were wobbles with the ball as Liam Livingstone and Harry Brook fought back, but Marco Jansen and Anrich Nortje held their nerve.

I still think a decent win against USA will be enough, but they will need other results to go their way.

South Africa were very impressive. They held their nerve and they have been accused of not doing that in World Cups in the past. This was a big test for them.

A hammer blow.

Harry Brook tries to get an early boundary and it looks like it might be going over mid-off but Aiden Markram tracks back and takes a fantastic catch over his shoulder.

The skipper may have just changed the game for his side.

Heartbreak for Harry Brook that he can't finish it off, but he batted beautifully.

Well bowled, Marco Jansen.

Seven from it and no boundaries - but Brook is on strike for the last.

England need 14 from the last over. (We'll have a super over if it's tied).
