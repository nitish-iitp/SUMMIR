England take on Sri Lanka in a do-or-die clash.

England will have everything to play for when they take on Sri Lanka in their last T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday, November 5. The equation is pretty clear-cut for Jos Buttler and Co. A win against Sri Lanka, irrespective of the margin, will put them in the semi-finals and knock Australia out. However, a loss for them will send the Aussies into the knockouts.

England have had a mixed campaign so far, with a loss against Ireland being the low point. However, they would go into the must-win clash against the Lankans high on confidence, having toppled New Zealand in their previous match.

There were plenty of positives for the Englishmen from that game. Skipper Buttler led from the front with 73 off 47, while Alex Hales also scored an impressive fifty. The bowlers then did a good job of restricting the Kiwis.

Sri Lanka might be eliminated from the semi-final race, but they will be no pushovers. The Asia Cup champions will be keen to sign off on a high and make life difficult for England.
