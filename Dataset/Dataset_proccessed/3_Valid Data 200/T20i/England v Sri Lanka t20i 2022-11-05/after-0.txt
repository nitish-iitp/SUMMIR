Ben Stokes curbed his aggression as the pitch slowed down•AFP/Getty Images

England 144 for 6 (Hales 47, Stokes 42*) beat Sri Lanka 141 for 8 (Nissanka 67, Wood 3-26) by four wickets

England are through to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, knocking Australia out in the process, thanks to a four-wicket win over Sri Lanka.

It was an anxiety-riddled chase in the final match in Group 1, despite a target of 142 looking well within reach after openers Jos Buttler and Alex Hales posted 75 for the first wicket inside eight overs. But a series of unforced errors saw six wickets fall in the space of 65 deliveries, for the addition of just 54. The trio of Wanindu Hasaranga, Dhananjaya de Silva and Lahiru Kumara split those dismissals evenly between them and for a moment an upset looked well and truly on the cards.

But Ben Stokes - as ever - saw England over the line with 42 from 36 that only contained two fours but allowed a constant ticking over the score to drag his team along before Chris Woakes’ cut for four confirmed victory with two balls left. It was a far closer than it should have been, especially after the strong work to keep Sri Lanka to a modest total after opener Pathum Nissanka (67) got them off to a flyer after Dasun Shanaka opted to bat first upon winning the toss.

For Australia, now officially done as defending champions, they will wonder what might have been having relinquished the opportunity to surpass England’s net run rate with their own modest win over Afghanistan on Friday.

England pick up eight from Kasun Rajitha's 19th over in ones and twos, plus a bonus wide. Stokes gets the strike for the last, with five more needed to book England a place in the semi-finals... Red rover?

Lahiru Kumara steps up with a brilliant 18th over, conceding just two singles and then having Sam Curran caught on the hook at fine leg! Chris Woakes walks out at No. 8, with 13 needed from the last two overs - the rate back above a run a ball for the first time in a long while. Australia fans, do you dare to hope?

England's requirement from the last three overs

Stokes and Sam Curran opt for safety first in seeing off Maheesh Theekshana's final over for six. They're closing in now, despite the middle-overs wobbles.

All on Stokes?
Ben Stokes shapes up for the sweep shot•Getty Images

From 75/0 to 111/5. A batter down. English fans right now are probably looking at the remaining 31 runs and feeling a degree of panic. And rightly so.

We know this is not an easy pitch to start on and that Sri Lanka's spinners are some of the surest on the circuit. At the same time, the dismissals of Brook, Livingstone and now Moeen were self-inflicted. England need to be smarter and those smarts seem to be coming from Ben Stokes' end. A lot has been made of his ideal position in the format, and with Malan's hamstring injury, the allrounder came in at number three and is keeping his strike rate above 100 even if the boundaries are proving hard to come by. If he's there at the end, England win. Simple as.

Now then...

After an explosive start - 70/0 after the Power Play - both Jos Buttler and Alex Hales have fallen to Hasaranga. England are 82 for two at the start of the 10th over, 60 still to get off 65. Granted, because of that early work, they should coast this. But as we've seen, it's not the most straightforward pitch to start on and new batters will be starting against spin. And remember - Dawid Malan won't bat...

Pace on the ball = Pace off the bat - PART DEUX

Rajitha's first over goes for 12. Kumara's first over goes for 14. We saw how effective pace off the ball was in that first innings and England need to make hay against the seamers. Right on cue, Wanindu Hasaranga comes into the attack - and he goes for 12! Dexterous use of weight from Buttler - back to cut for four, right over his front leg to smash down the ground for six - puts England above the rate, to 50/0 after the first five overs. They'll need to stay there.

A reminder of those fast v slow numbers from the first half:

Sri Lanka post 141 for eight

Very much an innings of two halves for Sri Lanka: runs followed by not that many runs. They managed just six boundaries after the seventh over - at which point they were 65 for one, which is as much a feather in England's cap as it is a stain on theirs.

Sri Lanka stumble in the final 10 overs

Pathum Nissanka started beautifully and has perhaps shown England the way here - target the smaller boundaries. Five of his seven boundaries were sixes which showed how power rather than precision works best on this surface.

Meanwhile, the Sam Curran death bowler glow-up continues...

England need 142 to make it through to the semis

Malan off!

Big blow for England here as Dawid Malan pulls his groin in the field. As a good player of spin and a left-hander, he'd have been key in the chase. Given it's an internal injury, he'll be unable to come in at his usual sport of number three. Is this an opportunity for Ben Stokes to move up the order? A big decision incoming for Buttler as he looks to close out this innings. The silver lining for England is that Malan is replaced by Superman (Chris Jordan).

Five overs to go, 116/3.

Pain and pressure

Right, so something to keep tabs on here with Pathum Nissanka. He had to get treatment halfway through the 10th over after turning his ankle diving to make his ground (just!). The running has been a little patchy, but the opener hasn't really bothered with getting runs with his feet.

That being said, England have done brilliantly to stem the flow and there's every chance he will focus on swinging harder as he approaches a second half-century of the competition. Especially as they lose their third - Charith Assalanka scuffing Stokes to Malan in the ring at backward point to make it 84 for three in the 11th.

Mark Wood has been on the podium for the fastest quicks at this World Cup. But Mendis and Nissanka aren't phased. The latter flicks the first delivery from the Durham man over square leg, the former ramps over third man with ease for the second six of the over. The third over goes for 17. A stunning start from Sri Lanka's openers...

Sri Lanka win the toss and will bat first!

Dasun Shanaka says he is batting first because of a used surface at Sydney and the fact teams batting first have won the last five matches at this venue. Jos Buttler admitted he wanted to do the same for the same reason. You'd assume this will be decided by the spinners in the second half.

Just one change across either team - Chamika Karunaratne comes in for Pramod Madushan.

Sri Lanka: 1 Kusal Mendis (wk), 2 Pathum Nissanka, 3 Dhananjaya de Silva, 4 Charith Asalanka, 5 Bhanuka Rajapaksa, 6 Dasun Shanaka (capt), 7 Wanindu Hasaranga, 8 Chamika Karunratne, 9 Maheesh Theekshana, 10 Kasun Rajitha, 11 Lahiru Kumara

England: 1 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 2 Alex Hales, 3 Dawid Malan, 4 Ben Stokes, 5 Liam Livingstone, 6 Harry Brook, 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Sam Curran, 9 Chris Woakes, 10 Mark Wood, 11 Adil Rashid

Welcome!

Roll up, roll up - the final game of Group 1 is upon us! After all the back of forth of the last two weeks, the equation is very simple for England: beat Sri Lanka and head through to the semi-finals.

But of course, nothing to do with Sri Lanka is straightforward, and would it really be a surprise if Jos Buttler’s men get turned over with so much of the world watching for what some feel will be a formality of a win? I’m expecting a bit of a scare, and we’ll find out if it’s a nightmare in a few hours time.
