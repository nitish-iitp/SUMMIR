India vs Hong Kong Highlights, Asia Cup 2022 Updates: India beat Hong Kong by 40 runs to qualify for the Super Fours. Batting first India had set a target of 193 runs thanks to fifties from Suryakumar Yadav and Virat Kohli. In reply, Hong Kong started well as the young Indian pacers faltered. But once the Indian spinners came into picture, Hong Kong chase lost steam. Although Nizakat Khan and Babar Hayatt tried their best, but they eventually fell short.

Suryakumar Yadav and Virat Kohli both scored fifties and made sure India reach a stiff total of 192/2 against Hong Kong. India had to bat first and lost the wicket of Rohit Sharma early. Later KL Rahul was also dismissed after a slow 36 off 39 balls. Nevertheless, from here Suryakumar Yadav took over and launched the Hong Kong spinners across all corners. He raced to his fifty in no time, but only after Kohli got to his first international fifty since February. SKY launched the Haroon for four SIXES off his final over as he brought up his fifty. He remained unbeaten at 68 off 26 balls. Kohli was unbeaten at 59 off 44.

India will have to bat first after Hong Kong win toss and opted to bowl in their opening game in this year’s Asia Cup. One of the lone qualifiers this season, Nizakat Khan won the toss and played his first ball on the front foot, opting to bowl first. Instead of taking first strike, they chose to bowl and take their chances against a mighty batting order like India’s. Meanwhile coming back to Men in Blue, it must be mentioned that Rohit has made just one change to the side, bringing in Pant for Hardik which means DK keeps his place.

Two days after a thrilling start to their Asia Cup 2022 campaign, defending champions India will take on Hong Kong at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium tonight. In a much-awaited clash, old rivals India and Pakistan produced a last-over finish with the contest living up to its billing. A combined bowling display saw Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya bowling out Pakistan for 147. Pakistan bowlers fought well though pushing the chase into the final over but a brilliant Pandya wasn’t done yet as he then starred with the bat to seal India’s five-wicket win with a six.
