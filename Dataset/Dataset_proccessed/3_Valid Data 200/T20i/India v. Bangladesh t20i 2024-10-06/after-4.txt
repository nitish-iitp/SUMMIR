India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I LIVE Score: We walked the talk as per decisions taken at team meeting: Suryakumar

"We just tried to back our skills and what we decided in the team meeting, we just walked the talk. The way we batted, showed our character," Suryakumar said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

"You always learn something new playing every game. There will be a few areas to improve, we'll sit down and talk about it before the next game."

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I LIVE Score: What Najmul Hossain Shanto said?

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I LIVE Score: After the match, Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto said, as quoted by Cricbuzz, "Yes, I think we didn't start well. In T20, first six overs is important but we didn't do well. The plan was to play positive cricket but we had to manage some overs how we want to approach. Looks like we didn't have much plan but we need to do proper plan in the next match. We need to focus on rotating the strike, T20 is not only about hitting. If we keep wickets in hand, we can get a good score. We didn't score many runs. Rishad bowled well and Fizz was also good but we didn't have enough runs.

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I LIVE Score: What Suryakumar Yadav said?

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I LIVE Score: Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav said after the match, as quoted by Cricbuzz, “We just tried to back our skills and what we decided in our team meetings, it worked out. The way the guys showed character playing on a new ground and the way we batted, it was great. It's a good headache to have when you are on the field on whom to bowl. Every time you have an extra option, it's a good thing. You learn something new every new game. There are always a few areas to improve on, we will sit down and talk about it in the next game."

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I LIVE Score: Arshdeep Singh becomes ‘Player of the match’

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I LIVE Score: Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh was awarded as the 'Player of the Match' for picking up 3 wickets at an economy of 3.65 and giving away just 14 runs.

After the match, Singh said, “There's breeze from the end I was bowling. I didn't get the wicket the way I wanted but the ball is coming good from the hand. It's minor changes in the run-up, in the wrist, I keep learning and exploring things. The experience is there, the more you play the better you get. Everyone bowled well, especially Mayank was very good. I guess the best thing in this format is how well you can adapt to the situation, to the wicket and to the ground dimensions as well. My motive is how well I can adapt and how quickly I can adapt."

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Dinesh Karthik says Nitish Reddy not in the same mould as Hardik Pandya

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Speaking on Cricbuzz, Dinesh Karthik said, “I wouldn't put him in the Hardik Pandya mould, and I say that because you are not guaranteed four overs from Nitish Kumar Reddy at the moment. He could go on to become that, but what we can be very excited about is his batting talent. He is an outstanding fielder—one of the quickest in the country—so that is another major plus," 

"What I really like about him is - playing for SRH is not easy as a middle-order batter because the tempo with which Head and Abhishek starts is very different to any other IPL team, they just get off to a flyer. What Nitish Reddy did really well was coming and continuing that tempo, and that requires skill. It's one thing taking 5-6 balls, taking your time and exploding, but a lot of times, he was able to maintain the momentum or run rate that the openers and number have set and that I love about him. It's not an easy skill, and it tells me that he is a man who is very sure of the shots he wants to play," the former Indian wicketkeeper added

06 Oct 2024, 05:46:03 PM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Will Mayank Yadav debut today?

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Speaking on his YouTube channel, Aakash Chopra said, "It is a big question (if Mayank should play). There are three contenders who not only we but even the franchises will have their eyes on because Mayank Yadav can be retained for four crores if he doesn't become a capped Indian. Similarly, KKR can retain Harshit Rana and the SunRisers Hyderabad can retain Nitish Kumar Reddy for four crores if they don't become capped Indians."

"Either you are a fast bowler or a medium pacer. It is either or. You have fast-tracked him. You have said that his first-class performances do not matter to you, or how much cricket he has played doesn't matter to you. So if you have picked him, play him. You do not pick a sword to keep it in a sheath," the former cricketer added

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Suryakumar Yadav gives insight on famous World Cup catch

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Speaking on The Great Indian Kapil Show Season 2, Surya said,  "When I ran, I noticed that the ball was quite far away. Then I saw Rohit bhai, he was at the other side, standing in long on. Then I thought I should run, catch the ball and throw it back in. Even if it was three or four runs, we would have a chance of winning. When the ball got closer, there was a chance to catch it and throw it back in. When I caught it after throwing it back inside, it was a great feeling,"
