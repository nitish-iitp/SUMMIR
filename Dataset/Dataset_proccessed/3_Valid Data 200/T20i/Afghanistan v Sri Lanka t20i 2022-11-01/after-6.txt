Afghanistan vs Sri Lanka Live Score, T20 World Cup 2022, AFG vs SL Latest Updates

Dhananjaya de Silva has guided Sri Lanka to a comprehensive victory over their Asian counterparts, Afghanistan! This has been a comfortable win for Sri Lanka and they keep their chances of making it to the semi-finals alive with a 6-wicket win.

They negotiated a tricky run chase with ease with the top order finally putting up a steady performance. Afghanistan will exit the tournament with this loss and will find themselves looking back at the two washed-out games. They have a chance to dent Australia’s hope and pick up a consolation win in their last fixture.

Afghanistan did not get much swing at the start of the inning but Mujeeb Ur Rahman took an early wicket once again. After losing Pathum Nissanka quite early, Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Mendis steadied the inning thereafter.

Afghanistan bowlers however failed to take wickets in quick succession which allowed their opponents to accumulate runs at a steady pace. They once again depended on their lead spinner Rashid Khan to help them out but his two wickets were not enough to win Afghanistan this game.

After Mendis’ dismissal, Charith Asalanka and Bhanuka Rajapaksa came out to play handy supporting roles for Dhananjaya de Silva who reached an outstanding half-century. His 66 of just 42 balls guided Sri Lanka to an easy win with 9 balls to spare.

While, on the other side Afghanistan have not yet performed at the best of their abilities and find themselves out of the competition.

AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: Will Rashid Khan take another one?

Huge appeal for LBW as Rajapaksa misses his slog, Rashid Khan seems convinced, on-field umpire says no and Afghanistan take the review.  Ugh! Unlucky Rashid. Very narrow margins. UltraEdge confirms no bat involved but ball tracking shows wickets and it’s given for umpire’s call.

Concussion check for Asalanka is done and all positive news. He’s doing fine. Now, Azmatullah Omarzai comes to bowl his first against Sri Lanka. Dhananjaya and Aslanaka look for a good partnership as they run for quick ones and twos.

Uh oh! A Wide! Overall a good over by Azmat, just 7 runs from the over. SL 59/2 in 9

NOV 01, 2022
17:29 IST
AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: Rashid Khan Comes in, Kusal Mendis Goes Back.

Afghanistan introduce ace bowler Rashid Khan and great decision from the skipper as Rashid is here at the right time to build more pressure on Sri Lanka and there…he brings in big breakthrough.

Mendis decided for a sweep against Rashid’s spin but only manages a top edge straight up and Gurbaz completes the catch. Nearly a collision between the fielders but all smiles as Afghanistan build pressure on the Lankans. SL 52/2 in 8

NOV 01, 2022
17:25 IST
AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: Big Over!

SIX! Mendis looks to shift gears after a slow start in the powerplay. Fareed Ahmed serves full and middle, Mendis just stands there and bangs it over the bowler’s head for the maximum. It’s purely stand and deliver shot. CLASSIC ONE!

And now it’s Four! Great way for ending the over. A big one for Sri Lanka as they bag 16 runs in this one. SL 44/1 in 7

Consecutive Boundaries!

Kusal Mendis releases pressure after back-to-back fours against Fareed Ahmad. First, Mendis gets the pull and smashes it cleanly over midwicket and pulls again, though not quite cleanly as the last but enough to clear the infield and touch the ropes. SL 23/1 in 5

NOV 01, 2022
17:11 IST

It’s undoubtedly Harsaranga’s day as he stumps Mujeeb ur Rahman this time. Rahman comes in front to play it across the line but misses it. Afghanistan now restricted to 144/8 in 20 overs

Great day for Hasaranga as he ends his spell with three wickets but now…will Sri Lanka be able to chase it down? Stay tuned…

NOV 01, 2022
16:45 IST

Theekshana bowls a slower to Nabi and Gulbadin Naib wants a second but Nabi sends him back. Is this going to be a run out? Oh no! Naib slips, loses his bat, does a rolley polley there into his crease but all in vain. The throw from the deep is quite accurate and Mendis takes the bails off. Naib looks in pain as he holds his elbow and walks off. More pain for Afghanistan as they lose their fifth wicket. AFG 132/5 in 18.

AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: No Ball!

Rajitha is right on his length, keeps the pressure on Afghanistan batters but wait…here he’s overstepped and it is a no-ball. Very tight call, though.

Will Gulbadin smash a six on this free-hit? No! Well bowled from Rajitha. Once again a slower one, outside off but Nabi fails to capitalise this one and it’s a dot ball. AFG 125/4 in 17

NOV 01, 2022
16:26 IST
AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: Najibullah Zadran Out!

Dhananjaya bowls it fuller around off and this time there is some extra flight to that delivery,  but Najibullah Zadran looks quite aggressive to smash a big hit and clear long-off but ughh!

Hasaranga takes it in the deep. A crucial wicket for Sri Lanka just at the right time. AFG 113/4 in 16.

NOV 01, 2022
16:20 IST
AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: AFG 104/3 in 15

Just five runs from the fifteenth over as Najibullah Zadran and Gulbadin Naib struggle against Sri Lanka bowlers to hit big shots. Only five overs left in the game and Afghanistan have wickets in hand.

NOV 01, 2022
16:15 IST
AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: AFG 99/3 in 14

No doubt, why Sri lanka bank on Wanindu Hasaranga. He is right on his track and has given space for the Afghanistan batters to make runs. Just four runs from this over and Afghanistan in bit of a trouble as they are still a run short of the 100 run mark at the end of 14th over.

NOV 01, 2022
16:11 IST
AFG vs SL T20 World Cup Live Score: Ibrahim Zadran OUT!

OUT! Big Wicket for Sri Lanka!

Lahiru Kumara bowls this one on a good length and outside the off pole, Zadran looks to smash it over the mid off fielder for a boundary but he mistimes and sends it straight to Bhanuka Rajapaksa at mid off. Another wicket for Kumara.

Well… Zadran was batting well but it’s third wicket loss for Afghanistan. AFG 90/3 in 12.2
