With the two-Test series against Bangladesh done and dusted and India winning it comprehensively, the two sides will shift their attention to the T20Is. The reigning T20 World champions will host the Tigers in the first of the three T20Is in Gwalior on October 6 (Sunday) in Gwalior.

With India picking a handful of players based on their IPL exploits, it will be interesting to see how many are given an opportunity in the playing XI. Captain Suryakumar Yadav, who started his full-time stint as T20I captain with a 3-0 series win over Sri Lanka, has announced Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson as the new opening pair. Tearaway pacer Mayank Yadav is also likely to make his international debut.

Bring on the #INDvBAN T20I Series opener 🙌

Meanwhile, for Bangladesh, it will be their first T20I since Shakib Al Hasan announced his retirement from the format. With conditions in India encouraging batters as well as bowlers, it will be interesting to see how the likes of Towhid Hridoy, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Rishad Hossain, Rakibul Hasan, and others showcase their skills.
