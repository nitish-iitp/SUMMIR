India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Pratyush Raj's report from Kotla

The pre-winter T20I evening had a midsummer IPL-night feel in New Delhi. India's template under the new regime has been the same, which helped them lift the T20 World Cup in Barbados. "Keep the strike rate up, don't worry about the milestones," former India coach Vikram Rathour had told The Indian Express on India's batting mantra of going all out in the T20s after the Adelaide disaster in the 2022 T20 World Cup. On Wednesday, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rinku Singh walked the talk. (READ MORE)

Abhishek comes in and gets through another over. It is hard to estimate why Surya has deployed Abhishek here apart from two right-handers but it has worked. He bowled tightly and made sure the run rate had gone up. As we update Mayank is brought into the attack.

21:28 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Nice bowling from India

It is highly improbable Bangladesh will get to the total from here on. However, what they can do here is build a partnership and give India a scare and they too can take a bit of confidence into the next game. However, it won't be easy India is bowling very nicely.

India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Sundar gets one

Sundar comes in and creates the breakthrough. It is Najmul Hossain Shanto who tried to take on the off-spinner and was caught at long-on clever captaincy from Suryakumar Yadav to introduce the spinner in the first six overs of the innings. 

21:10 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Attacking start from Bangladesh

Well well, Bangladesh has made its intentions clear here as well. As soon as the Indian seamers are missing their marks they are hitting the ball into the stands.

21:05 (IST)

09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Good start for Bangladesh

09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Pull back from BAN

09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Can spinners keep things tight?

India might look to target the spinners on this ground. As pacers might have the cushion of pace variations however, spinners need to get spot on their lengths on this wicket. As given the dimensions of the grounds even a mistimed delivery can be deposited into the stands. After 8.3 overs IND 66/3

19:35 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Time for partnership

Nitish Reddy and Rinku Singh have an exceptional opportunity to build a partnership here. However, they need to reassess what a good score on this surface is. In IPL the surface did deliver hig-scoring grounds but this wickets seems to be a bit two paced. After 7.2 overs IND 53/3

19:31 (IST)
09 OCT 2024

19:25 (IST)
09 OCT 2024

19:15 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Abhishek departs

09 OCT 2024

India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Fireworks for IND

Mehidy has taken the new ball for Bangladesh however, there was no turn-on over and both Sanju Samson and Abhishek were in no mood to see out the over either. They just sat back on the book foot and punched the ball through the gaps. Ominous signs for Bangladesh already. After 1.1 overs IND 15/0

19:00 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Let's go!

Expect a high-scoring affair today. We are unsure about the dew however, Bangladesh needs to restrict India to a competitive total if they need to have any chance of winning of this game. The crowd is buzzing expect another cracker of a game at least from Indian batting perspective. 

18:54 (IST)

India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Pitch report by Abhinav Mukund

The second T20 international promises to be a run-fest. On this pitch, a lot of runs have been scored historically in the past. Not a big ground by any stretch of imagination. 55m and 63m square, 72m straight down the ground. This has been a fabulous pitch in the IPL. It's been 200+ consistently. It seems really hard, it's going to be a nightmare for the bowlers to bowl on this surface. It looks like one of those surfaces where even 200 might not be enough. Recently, a local T20 tournament, 300 runs were scored on this same surface. Teams that have batted first have won the games - five out five in the IPL. I'll bat first, but with the dew around, you never know."

18:46 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Washington Sundar ahead of game

I just try to be on top of my game, no matter if I'm playing a match or not. Every practice session, I need to be at the top of my game, I need to feel that I am hitting my best rhythm. If I am not hitting my best rhythm, I'll try and see where I am lacking and try and really work on it. When I walk back home, I'll have to be at the top of my rhythm. This is something that I have been telling myself constantly. Eventually when the game happens, I am ready no matter when. With my bowling in particular, run-up and synchronization of both my arms are very important. That's something I constantly focus on. Some of the other things that probably come naturally to me and I don't really focus too much on that. But these two things keep changing especially with the fact that I play different formats every now and then. With regards to that, I really need to be on top of my game, especially with what format I am playing at that time. I am just grateful for all the opportunities that I am getting, no matter where I am thrown at, it could be powerplay, it could be middle overs, it could be death overs at times, really looking forward to put up best performances for the team.

18:40 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Najmul Hossain Shanto

I'll like to bowl first. Looks a good wicket, I think dew might come in the second innings. If you look at all the international matches and IPL, looks a pretty good wicket, big score in all the matches. It (winning their last 2 matches in Delhi) gives us a lot of confidence, but today is a new day, we have to play to our strength and give our best. Top of the order, as a batting group, we need to focus on the first first six overs. Shoriful isn't playing, Tanzim Sakib plays.

18:40 (IST)
09 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Suryakumar Yadav at toss

We were looking to bat first as well. We did bowl in the first game. I spoke to a few groundsmen and they said there was a little bit of dew. We wanted to challenge our bowlers to bowl with the wet ball and see what we can do. The amount of talent in the dressing room, it's very difficult to express that. I am just happy sitting back, relaxing now, watching them play and my job has becme very easy. You have to be one step ahead when you're playing this format. Looks very good. We are unchanged.

India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Reason for throwdown specialists

“One of the main reasons for that is our coaching system. With the Indian team now, as it has been for a little while, we have three dedicated throwdown specialists and generally, we get four nets. Two nets are used for full-fledged bowling; in the other two nets, there is always someone who wants extra batting. Most of the batters finish their 20–25 minutes of batting, after which there are between three and five men waiting with weapons in their hands – I am referring, of course, to the sidearm or the slinger. Across formats, all our batters only bat, they don’t bowl at all,”

18:19 (IST)

India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Lively net session

The atmosphere in India's bowling nets was lively and competitive. Tilak Varma and Rinku Singh were joking around and comparing their international wicket-taking records.

India vs Bangladesh 2nd T20 Live: Bangladesh weakness

Bangladesh's batting is a major weakness in their team. They struggled against India's disciplined bowling and need to improve their batting performance to be competitive.
