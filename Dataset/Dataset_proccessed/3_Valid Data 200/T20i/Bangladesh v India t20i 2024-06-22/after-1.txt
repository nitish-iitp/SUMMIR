Goodbye for now!

That’s it from our live coverage of India against Bangladesh at the T20 World Cup.

A win for Australia against Afghanistan in the next Group 1 match will mean both India and the Australians qualify for the semifinals.

We’ll be back on Sunday with holders England’s chances of qualifying in the balance when they take on USA.

Do join us if you can.

For now, though – from me, Kevin Hand – it’s goodbye!

Rohit Sharma analyses India’s performance

“We know what is expected of us and what we need to do and how we need to play,” the India captain said at the post-match ceremony. “We adapted to the conditions – there is a small factor here in that -and then be smart.

“All batters need to play their role. We saw only one guy got fifty and we still got 195. How you put pressure on the opposition is what matters. All the batters did that from the word go.

“We have to understand conditions as well, but there is a lot of experience in that squad and we back them to make those decisions on the field.

“The way Hardik batted was excellent but the way we batted to put us in a very good state to set the platform to finish that game was brilliant.”

Najmul Hossain Shanto reflects as Bangladesh exit the T20 World Cup

“We were thinking about 160-170 but, the way they bat, credit goes to them,” the Bangladesh captain told the ICC broadcast.

“We have a lot of batting options but we didn’t show the intent we needed – especially in the first six overs and I should have finished the game.

“I should mention Rishad and the way he bowled in this tournament. He has done well.”

Hardik Pandya is Player of the Match

“We played really good cricket. More than anything we stuck together and executed our plans. In certain situations everyone has stepped up at the right times,” he told the ICC broadcast.

“Batters wanted to use the breeze, so I put the ball in short and bowl wide so it was just about being one step ahead of the batters.

“As a group, we can get better in a lot of places. Losing wickets in bunches is something we would like to rectify and get better at. Otherwise, everyone is looking good and in the right mind.

“For me, I’ve always been very fortunate to play for the country. It was a freak injury in the [2023] Cricket World Cup, I did try to come back but I’ve been putting in the hard work to get the opportunities for luck to come my way.

“Luck comes to people who work hard. It doesn’t come to people who sit at home.”
