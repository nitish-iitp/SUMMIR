TEAM USA MENMATCH REPORT
USA STUN BANGLADESH IN HISTORIC T20I WIN
By USA Cricket MediaMay 22, 2024

May 21, 2024

Hosts USA stunned International Cricket Council (ICC) full-member Bangladesh by five wickets in the opening match of the three-match T20 International (T20I) series, here at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in Houston, Texas. Harmeet Singh (33*of 13 balls) and Corey Anderson (34* of 25 balls) starred for the USA men’s cricket team in the historic win, given it was the first ever international fixture between the two nations.

USA skipper Monank Patel put the visitors in after winning the toss and Bangladesh compiled a competitive 153/6 at the end of 20 overs. Towhid Hridoy led the Bangladesh effort with a 47-ball 58 and was last man out of the last ball of the innings. He received good support from the experienced Mahmudullah, who scored 31 off 22 balls.

The USA in response lost their skipper early to an unfortunate run-out at the non-striker’s end, but were ahead of the game at the 10-over mark, having lost two wickets for 66.

Muztafizur Rahman then first turned hero for Bangladesh with twin strikes of Steven Taylor and Aaron Jones in the 12th over to bring the Tigers back into the game, and then evened it up conceding two sixes off his last two balls of the 18th, as Harmeet Singh began his match-winning cameo.

He clobbered three sixes and two fours and forged a 60-run unbroken partnership with Corey Anderson, who also came good in the end, when it mattered most. Player of the Match Harmeet Singh deservedly hitting the winning four.

Brief Scores

Bangladesh 153/6 of 20 overs (Towhid Hridoy 58 of 47, Mahmudullah 31 (22)/ S. Taylor 9/2); lost to USA 156/5 of 19.3 overs (Corey Anderson 34* (25), Harmeet Singh 33* (13), Steven Taylor 28 (29) / Muztafizur 41/2).
