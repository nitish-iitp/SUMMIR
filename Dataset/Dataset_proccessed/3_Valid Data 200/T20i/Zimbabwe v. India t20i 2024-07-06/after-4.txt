India vs Zimbabwe Highlights: Chasing 116 runs at Harare against Zimbabwe, India lost all its wickets at 102 and lost by 13 runs in the first T20I of the 5-match series on 6 July. 102 is India's lowest all out total in T20Is in the last eight years.

For India, Shubman Gill scored 31 runs and Washington Sundar scored 27 runs. Apart from this, no other batter could score more.

While for Zimbabwe, Sikandar Raza and Tendai Chatara took three wickets. Also, Brian Bennett, Wellington Masakadza, Blessing Muzarabani and Luke Jongwe picked one wicket each.

Earlier, Zimbabwe had scored 115 runs after losing 9 wickets. Brian Bennett (22), Dion Myers (23), Clive Madande (29) and Madhevere (21) scored some good runs for the team.

For India, Ravi Bishnoi took 4 wickets, Washington Sundar picked 2 wickets, while Mukesh Kumar and Avesh Khan took one wicket each.

A young side, India, will take on Zimbabwe in the first match of the Sports 5 T20I series at the Harare Sports Club on Saturday. Notably, this will be the first time the Men in Blue have played in Zimbabwe since 2016.

The Zimbabwe series has taken on new significance following the T20 World Cup victory and the subsequent retirements of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja from T20 cricket. With fresh blood in the side, the Men in Blue will be looking to continue their winning ways.

Zimbabwe, on the other hand, come into this series after losing their last series against Bangladesh 4-1 in May. Meanwhile, Sikandar Raza's side failed to qualify for the T20 World Cup.

India vs Zimbabwe Squads:
India (Playing XI) - Shubman Gill (C), Abhishek Sharma, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Riyan Parag, Rinku Singh, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar, Khaleel Ahmed.

Zimbabwe (Playing XI) - Tadiwanashe Marumani, Innocent Kaia, Brian Bennett, Sikandar Raza (C), Dion Myers, Johnathan Campbell, Clive Madande (WK), Wessly Madhevere, Luke Jongwe, Blessing Muzarabani, Tendai Chatara.

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: Here's what Shubman Gill said

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: Shubman Gill said after the match, as quoted by Cricbuzz, “We bowled pretty well, we let ourselves down in the field. We were not up to standard and everyone looked a bit rusty. We spoke about taking time and enjoying our batting but it didn't pan out that way. Halfway through we had lost 5 wickets, would've been best for us if I stayed there till the end, very disappointed with the way I got out and the rest of the match panned out. There was a bit of hope for us but when you're chasing 115 and your no.10 batter is out there, you know something is wrong."

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: Sikandar Raza becomes ‘Player of the Match’

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: Sikandar Raza becomes ‘Player of the Match’. He said after the match, as quoted by Cricbuzz, “Feel really happy about the win. Need to take one game at a time. The job is not done, series is not over. World champions play like world champions so we need to be ready for the next game. This isn't a wicket where you get bowled out for 115. Credit to the bowlers of both sides. Clearly an indication we need to up our skills. I said I don't care about the result as long as we could be true to the crowd and changing room, we had our plans, we stuck to it and we backed our guys. Our catching and ground fielding was amazing but we did make some errors, shows there's room for improvement. We knew the fans would lift us up and give us energy, credit to them, it helped us."
