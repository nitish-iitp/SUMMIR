Hello and Welcome to the live coverage of the India vs Zimbabwe match by India Today.

19:48 IST:
Right then! India came out on top and won the series 3-1 and have outplayed Zimbabwe in all the departments in the 4th T20 with the last T20I coming up on the 14th of July 2024. Sunday. The match is scheduled at 4.30 pm IST (11 am GMT) but you can join us early as we bring you the pre-match excitement. Till then, have a great time.
19:46 IST:
Shubman Gill, the India captain, expresses his happiness with his first series win as captain but acknowledges that the job is not yet complete with one game left to play. He mentions that chasing was a key focus and is pleased they accomplished it. Gill praises the team, calling them a great bunch of players, and hopes to lead them forward. He also notes that he hasn't discussed potential changes with the coach yet and will inform everyone at the toss if there are any, adding a chuckle at the end.
19:45 IST:
Yashasvi Jaiswal is the Player of the Match for his outstanding knock of 93 runs off just 53 balls. He says that he really enjoyed his batting and he had plans for different bowlers as well. Adds that the new ball was coming onto the bat nicely but once it got older it was a bit slow. Says that he thought about the hundred but adjusted to the conditions and just tried to stay there till the end. Ends by saying that it was great batting with Gill out there.
19:44 IST:
Sikandar Raza, the Zimbabwe captain, reflects on the match, stating that the wicket was slightly on the slower side initially, possibly due to it being a bit damp. He mentions that their target was around 160, which they considered to be a par score. However, given India's exceptional batting performance, Raza acknowledges that even 180 runs might not have been sufficient. He expresses hope that his team will come back stronger in the final game of the series. Raza emphasizes the importance of bouncing back well in all three departments. He adds that even if they end up losing the series 2-3, it would still be a satisfactory outcome.
19:32 IST:
... TIME FOR THE PRESENTATIONS ...
19:32 IST:
Khaleel Ahmed is up for a flash interview. He says that he is very happy with his performance. Adds that he has been able to adapt to the conditions and execute his plans well. Tells that he was missing the atmosphere of being in the Indian dressing room and is glad to be back again. Mentions that everyone is equal and no one is bigger than anyone and says that he was practicing a lot when he was part of the reserve squad for the T20 World Cup.
19:33 IST:
In response, India’s opening duo made light work of the target. Jaiswal’s dazzling innings, coupled with Gill’s steady and assured performance, ensured that India reached the target with ease, without losing a single wicket. This comprehensive victory highlights the depth and talent of the young Indian side, signaling a bright future for Indian cricket. As the players leave the field, all smiles and jubilation are evident in the Indian camp, having secured a dominant series win. The final match of the series, now a dead rubber, will still be an opportunity for India to showcase their depth and for Zimbabwe to salvage some pride. Stay tuned for the upcoming presentations.
19:34 IST:
Earlier in the day, Shubman Gill won the toss for the fourth consecutive time on this tour and opted to bowl first on a fresh pitch. Despite the initial struggles of debutant Tushar Deshpande and Khaleel Ahmed with the new ball, Zimbabwe's opening pair, Tadiwanashe Marumani and Wessly Madhevere, added a solid 63 runs for the first wicket. However, India's fifth and sixth bowlers, Abhishek Sharma and Shivam Dube, managed to break this partnership by taking crucial wickets in consecutive overs. Following these dismissals, Zimbabwe struggled to maintain momentum as wickets fell at regular intervals. Nonetheless, skipper Sikandar Raza put up a valiant fight, scoring an aggressive 46 off 28 balls. In doing so, he became the first Zimbabwean batter to surpass 2000 T20I runs, a remarkable achievement in his illustrious career. Despite Raza's efforts, once he was dismissed in the 19th over, India effectively restricted Zimbabwe to 152/7 in their allotted 20 overs on a seemingly good batting surface.
19:30 IST:
Well, it has been a Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill show to decide the series against Zimbabwe as India won by 10 wickets and chased down 153 runs in 15.2 overs. It has been a batting brilliance by both the opening batters from India. Shubman Gill, the skipper of this young side, scores his second half-century of the series along with Yashasvi Jaiswal who was the star of the chase, scoring 93 not out off just 53 balls.

18:11 IST:
India, on the other hand, will be happy with their overall bowling effort. They were not able to pick up a wicket in the Powerplay for the first time in this series but pulled things back nicely in the middle and death overs. It was the part-timers who got them the breakthroughs this time as Shivam Dube and Abhishek Sharma removed the openers to shift the momentum. Khaleel Ahmed was decent as well and got a couple of wickets to his name. Tushar Deshpande had a tough debut but managed to get his maiden T20I wicket while Washington Sundar also chipped in with one. Ravi Bishnoi did not pick up any wickets but was very economical and put the pressure on te batters. Their bowlers were clever with the pace variations at the death and restricted the hosts just over 150. However, Zimbabwe have already defended a low total in this series and will take confidence from that, but this wicket looks like a batting deck and India will back themselves to seal the series here. Join us in a bit for all the exciting action in the second essay.
18:06 IST:
Zimbabwe failed to finish with a flurry but still posted a fighting total here! Zimbabwe were finally able to build up a good opening stand for the first time in this series. Both the openers got off to decent starts and were able to utilize the Powerplay as well none of them could play that long knock and lost their wickets in quick succession. They suffered a mini-collapse after that in the middle overs but it was their skipper Sikandar Raza who took them out of the trouble with a fighting knock of 46 off just 28 balls. However, he had to perish at the death and the hosts huffed and puffed to their way over the 150-run mark. They will feel that with the start that they got, they should have got 15-20 runs more here.
