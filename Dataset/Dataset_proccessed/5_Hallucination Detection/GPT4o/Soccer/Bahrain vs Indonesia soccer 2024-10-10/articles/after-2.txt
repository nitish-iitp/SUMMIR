JAKARTA, NETRALNEWS.COM - A match between Bahrain and Indonesia's national football teams in the third round of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers might be replayed after the Garuda squad was 'robbed' on Thursday (October 10, 2024). Indonesia's national team had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Bahrain at the Bahrain National Stadium. The result was largely due to a controversial decision made by Omani referee Ahmed Al Kaf. Al Kaf frequently made questionable calls against Indonesia throughout the match.

One of the most notable decisions was regarding the additional injury time. The second half was given six minutes of added time, despite the match not having many stoppages. However, the game ended nine minutes after the regular time, even though only six minutes of additional time had been allocated. Due to the extended injury time given by referee Al Kaf, Bahrain managed to score an equaizer in the 90+9th minute. For Indonesia, the draw felt more like a defeat. The unfair result for Indonesia's national team could potentially lead to a legal challenge, and a rematch could be arranged. A similar case occurred during the 2016 World Cup Qualifiers, in a match between South Africa and Senegal for the 2018 World Cup.

The match, held in November 2016 at Peter Mokaba Stadium, saw Ghanaian referee Joseph Lamptey award a controversial penalty to South Africa after Kalidou Koulibaly was mistakenly judged to have handled the ball. The penalty was successfully converted by Thulani Hlatshwayo, giving South Africa 2-1 victory over Senegal. As a result, referee Lamptey had to be escorted off the field. The Senegal Football Association did not remain silent and filed a protest to FIFA. As a result, a few months later, referee Lamptey was banned from officiating matches for life, and the South Africa vs Senegal match was ordered to be replayed.

The rematch was held 12 months later, at the same stadium, but with a different outcome--Senegal won 2-0. This victory secured Senegal's spot in the 2018 World Cup.
