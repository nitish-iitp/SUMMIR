        "The Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) has formally submitted a protest letter to both FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) regarding the controversial refereeing.",
        "PSSI's complaint focuses on the referee Ahmed Al-Kaf\u2019s decision to extend stoppage time beyond the indicated six minutes, allowing Bahrain to equalize.",
        "PSSI argued that the additional time was unjustified and raised concerns that the referee appeared to be waiting for Bahrain to score.",
