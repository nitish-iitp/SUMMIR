We said: Gambia 1-1 Tunisia
While Tunisia are still ranked in the top 10 sides in the CAF region, their performances over the last year have been well below expectations. Gambia, on the other hand, have been steadily improving over the same period, and if they can find a way to tighten up defensively, we could see them moving up the rankings in the coming months. The Carthage Eagles are considered the favourites here, but we feel the Scorpions will be able to earn a share of the spoils in this one. Read more.
Data Analysis

Our analysis of all available data, including recent performances and player stats up until an hour before kickoff, suggested the most likely outcome of this match was a Tunisia win with a probability of 39.45%. A win for Gambia had a probability of 33.31% and a draw had a probability of 27.2%.

The most likely scoreline for a Tunisia win was 0-1 with a probability of 11.1%. The next most likely scorelines for that outcome were 1-2 (8.33%) and 0-2 (7.16%). The likeliest Gambia win was 1-0 (10%), while for a drawn scoreline it was 1-1 (12.9%). The actual scoreline of 1-2 was predicted with an 8.3% likelihood. Our data analysis correctly predicted that Tunisia would win this match.
