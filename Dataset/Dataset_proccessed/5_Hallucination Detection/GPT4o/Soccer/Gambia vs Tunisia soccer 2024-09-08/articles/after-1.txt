Gambia and Tunisia lock horns in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Sunday

Gambia and Tunisia return to action in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they square off at the Stade El Abdi on Sunday. Both sides picked up contrasting results in the opening game, with the Eagles of Carthage claiming a narrow victory over Madagascar.

Gambia were denied a dream start to their quest for a place in Morocco as they played out a 1-1 draw with Comoros in the Group A opener on Wednesday.

Troyes midfielder Youssouf M'Changama put Comoros in front with a 37th-minute strike but Musa Barrow netted on the stroke of halftime to force a share of the spoils.

Gambia, who are 132nd in the latest FIFA World Rankings, have failed to win eight of their last nine matches across all competitions, with a 5-1 victory over Seychelles on June 8 being the exception.

Tunisia, on the other hand, kicked off their qualifying campaign with a 1-0 victory over Madagascar at the Stade Olympique Hammadi Agrebi on Thursday.

Veteran midfielder Ferjani Sassi spared the Eagles of Carthage’s blushes as he netted in the eighth minute of stoppage time to hand them a last-gasp victory over their East African counterparts.

With Thursday’s result, Tunisia have gone four straight games without defeat across all competitions, claiming three wins and one draw since losing on penalties against Croatia in a friendly on March 23.

Gambia vs Tunisia Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
This will be the third meeting between Gambia and Tunisia, with Faouzi Benzarti’s men picking up two wins in their previous two encounters.
Tunisia are unbeaten in six of their last seven AFCON qualifying games, picking up five wins and one draw since June 2022.
Gambia have won just one of their last nine matches across all competitions while losing six and claiming two draws since September 2023.
Tunisia have gone five straight competitive games without defeat, picking up two wins and three draws since a 1-0 loss against Namibia on January 16.
Gambia vs Tunisia Prediction

Fresh off the back of a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Madagascar, Tunisia will head into the weekend with confidence as they look to make it two wins from two in the qualifiers.

While we expect Gambia to put up a fight, we predict Benzarti‘s side will come away with another narrow victory at the Stade El Abdi.

Prediction: Gambia 1-2 Tunisia
