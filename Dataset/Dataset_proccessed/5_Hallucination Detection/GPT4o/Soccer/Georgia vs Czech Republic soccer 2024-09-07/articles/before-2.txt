Preview: Georgia vs. Czech Republic - prediction, team news, lineups

Georgia and Czech Republic kick off their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaigns with an opening fixture at the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium in Tbilisi on Saturday evening.

Both nations are in action for the first time since competing in the same group at Euro 2024 and will be seeking to gain promotion from League B Group 1 along with Ukraine and Albania.

Georgia competed at a major tournament as an independent nation for the first time in their history over the summer and, as the lowest-ranked side at Euro 2024, surprised many by reaching the knockout rounds.

Willy Sagnol's men picked up four points from three group-stage games, including all three in a vital 2-0 victory over Portugal, and edged themselves into the last 16 as one of the best third-placed teams.

Georgia's fairytale journey was eventually ended by champions Spain, losing 4-1, but the Crusaders exited the tournament in Germany with their heads held high, and Sagnol is now targeting a successful campaign in the Nations League.

Currently ranked 70th in the world by FIFA, Georgia secured promotion from League C of the Nations League in 2022-23 after winning five and drawing one of their six matches to comfortably finish top of their group ahead of Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Gibraltar.

Georgia have only lost three of their last 11 internationals in all competitions, including two against Spain, while their home record also bodes well ahead of Saturday's clash with Czech Republic, as they have lost just one of their last 13 matches in front of their own fans since November 2021.

Three years after reaching the quarter-finals at the European Championship, Czech Republic crashed out in the group stage of Euro 2024, finishing rock bottom with only one point.

That solitary point was collected from a 1-1 draw with none other than Georgia - Patrik Schick's second-half goal cancelled out a first-half penalty from Georges Mikautadze - while they also lost to both Portugal and Turkey by 2-1 scorelines.

Ivan Hasek, who was appointed head coach in January, won each of his first four games in charge of Czech Republic prior to Euro 2024 and is now tasked with reigniting the spark that they had earlier in the year as they endeavour to kick-start their Nations League campaign in positive fashion.

Ranked 47th in the world by FIFA after falling 13 places since the conclusion of Euro 2024, Czechia were relegated from League A of the 2022-23 Nations League after losing four of their six group matches, finishing behind Spain, Portugal and Switzerland.

Hasek's side will be hoping to improve their away form, as they enter Saturday's clash against Georgia having won just three of their last 13 internationals on the road, excluding Euro 2024 matches - they did beat Norway 2-1 in their most recent away game in March, though.

Georgia midfielder Jaba Kankava, 38, has retired from international football after earning 101 caps for his country, while the likes of Solomon Kvirkvelia, Nika Kvekveskiri, Levan Shengelia and Giorgi Kvilitaia have all been omitted from Sagnol's squad since Euro 2024.

Liverpool's new signing Giorgi Mamardashvili, who has returned to Valencia on loan, made a remarkable 29 saves at Euro 2024 - more than double his nearest challengers - and he is expected to start between the sticks on Saturday.

Georges Mikautadze, one of six players to share the Euro 2024 Golden Boot with three goals, now plies his trade in Ligue 1 with Lyon and is set to start for Georgia in attack, while Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and 117-cap captain Guram Kashia could also be named in the first XI.

As for Czech Republic, midfielder Matej Jurasek has withdrawn from the squad due to injury, while Antonin Barak, Jindrich Stanek, Tomas Holes and David Jurasek are notable absentees from Hasek's squad.

Bayer Leverkusen's Matej Kovar is set to become Czechia's new number one goalkeeper and he could be protected by a back three of Robin Hranac, Ladislav Krejci and David Zima, with Vladimir Coufal and either Lukas Provod or uncapped Matej Rynes playing as wing-backs.

Patrik Schick has scored 20 goals in 40 games for his country and is set to start up front, while captain Tomas Soucek is expected to earn his 73rd cap in centre-midfield.


Georgia possible starting lineup:
Mamardashvili; Lochoshvili, Kashia, Dvali; Kakabadze, Kochorashvili, Altunashvili, Tsitaishvili; Davitashvili, Mikautadze, Kvaratskhelia

Czech Republic possible starting lineup:
Kovar; Zima, Hranac, Krejci; Coufal, Soucek, Kral, Rynes; Lingr, Hlozek; Schick




We say: Georgia 1-1 Czech Republic

Having trailed at half time in each of their last four Nations League matches, Czech Republic will hope to put their stamp on proceedings early doors and quell the attacking threat of Georgia.

Both sides will fancy their chances of success on Saturday, but we can see the spoils being shared on this occasion, as they did at Euro 2024.
