Ryan Casey gets in touch: “While this Euros has been wonderful so far, I do wonder if we are on the way to perhaps the worst “Golden Boot Race” of the modern era. Only 4 players have two goals, and not necessarily impressive prospects going forward. Fullkrug seemingly hasn’t won a starting spot, and I don’t know if Musiala will be given the same freedom if Germany face tougher opposition in the knockouts (his two goals came against IMO the two worst teams at the tournament, although I guess Hungary will likely be through). As for Mikautadze and Schranz, they could both be going home tomorrow. Still, this format has 4 knockout games, so someone could takeover a la Griezmann 2016.”

“My nomination for best player from another team is France’s mini-sized midfield enforcer Ngolo Kante. I had to pinch myself watching France to believe that it wasn’t his younger brother or something like that. Out of sight is out of mind, and he’d disappeared from everybody’s radar after injury and leaving Chelsea/moving to Saudi. But there he is, running the show and seemingly back to his very best form. Can France benefit from his resurgence by actually “doing a goal” all by themselves ? Good spot from Deschamps, re-calling him to the squad and starting XI.”

Julian Borrill gets in touch: “In today’s preamble it was suggested that for Croatia to qualify they needed:

Portugal to beat Georgia

Turkey to beat Czech Republic

England to beat Slovenia by three or more goals

Denmark to beat Serbia

“However I think that 3rd needs to be qualified should England win by exactly 3 goals. A score of 3-0 would leave Croatia ahead on goals scored, while 5-2 or higher would similarly favour Slovenia. However if it ends 4-1 then it would be down to the disciplinary record, where Slovenia are currently 4-7 ahead. So along with everything else Croatia need to be hoping for a card-happy referee today.”

Perhaps Mikel Arteta might consider this option at Arsenal.

Per Reuters – The people have spoken and it is not good news for Germany striker Kai Havertz, who faces a battle to hold on to his starting place in their European Championship last-16 tie on Saturday.

German newspaper Bild ran a poll of who should start between misfiring forward Havertz and Füllkrug, who has come off the bench to score twice for the tournament hosts, including a last-gasp equaliser against Switzerland on Sunday.

With more than 160,000 votes cast, 90% of fans are in favour of Füllkrug, a clear message to coach Julian Nagelsmann.

“Füllkrug has a chance to start, but Kai has the same chances,” Nagelsmann told reporters, though he will wait to see who their last-16 opponents are before making a decision.
Germany will face the runners-up in Group C, to be decided later on Tuesday, a position currently held by Denmark. “Kai had three good chances (against Switzerland), and he was annoyed that he didn’t take two. He still played a good game.

“Füllkrug provides arguments for both things. To continue to act as a substitute because he does it really well. Or to play from the start. It is both a joy and a sorrow for him that he fulfils the (substitute) role well.”

Good afternoon, let’s start with an email from Francis Mead: “I honestly hope I’m wrong but I don’t think Gallagher is the solution. Yes, he will run and press - but I don’t see great passing ability or control from him - he doesn’t give us enough in those areas. Rooney’s solution I feel is much better.”

After my Group D permutations post, John Brennan has flagged up some potentially head-spinning Group E scenarios:

I’m a bit of a nerd about tables & permutations around 3rd place and I want to put this out there to see if I’m right or missing something. If Romania & Slovakia draw tomorrow they will both go through no matter what. They will both be on 4 points which is already guaranateed for best 3rd place. Then if there is a winner in the other game between Belgium & Ukraine, the winner will top the group with Romania & Slovakia in 2nd & 3rd place. If Belgium & Ukraine draw, Ukraine will finish bottom of group as they have a worse goal difference than all the other teams in group.

It’s not totally unique as there was a similar situation in Euro 2004 where Denmark & Sweden could both qualify with a 2-2 draw in their final group game and it finished ... 2-2.

That’s correct as I see it, John. All four teams could feasibly end up on four points, with one of them going home.

Some Swiss coaches have had their laptops stolen in Düsseldorf. This also comes via Reuters:

Switzerland coaches had computers stolen in Düsseldorf during Euro 2024, though no sensitive data or information about their next match against Italy has been compromised, the team said today.

Video analysts responsible for preparing data and tactical information for team coaches were not impacted as they were at Switzerland’s base camp in Stuttgart, a spokesperson for the team said, confirming three laptops were taken.

Those affected were part of a delegation of junior national team coaches who were travelling across Germany to observe and analyse matches.

“No sensitive data or no information about the upcoming match against Italy has been lost,” the official said in an email.

Switzerland have reached the knockout stages of their sixth successive major tournament and play Italy in Berlin on Saturday.

Georgia deny political interference in selection

Georgia coach Willy Sagnol said only he selects the national side, responding angrily when asked whether forward Budu Zivzivadze’s playing time at Euro 2024 had been limited because of his reported criticism of a new law on foreign agents.

The national team’s first major tournament appearance has created a buoyant mood in Georgia, where there have been huge protests against a controversial law requiring certain organisations to register as “agents of foreign influence”.

Georgia play already-qualified Portugal in their final group game on Wednesday, when victory would secure a place in the last 16. Zivzivadze has played only six minutes at Euro 2024.

“I want to take proper decisions based only on football fact,” Frenchman Sagnol told reporters on Tuesday. “I can’t accept that any longer - I’m a football coach, nothing else. Who plays and who doesn’t play, it is my entire decision, that’s it,” he added.

Sagnol believes his side are unfortunate to have only one point from their performances in the first two matches.

He said: “If, before the competition, we would have been told maybe on your third match you will still have the possibility to qualify, I think we would all have signed these documents immediately.”

Group D permutations ahead of 5pm KOs

Gah, it’s still around four hours until those tantalising 5pm games.

A reminder that the Netherlands must match or better France’s result to top Group D, while Austria look in good shape to qualify as one of the best third place teams, although a point will significantly help their case. If Austria beat the Dutch, they’ll go through and could even top the group if France drop points.

Poland are already out.

Favourite non-England player at Euro 2024? Joseph Mellin chimes in with a solid suggestion:

My favourite player so far has been Radu Dragusin. I love a defender who takes centre stage and performs so well that you can’t ignore them. Complete control and plenty of quality going forward. I’m a Villa fan and my two favourite players are McGrath and Laursen, who had this habit. Spurs have a good one there. Do they fancy some FFP related swapsies?

It might not happen tonight, but Paul Scholes is of the belief that Kobbie Mainoo could and should be the fulcrum of England’s midfield for the best part of the next decade.

“I see Kobbie Mainoo in this England squad, in this England team for the next 10 years at least,” he told TNT Sports.

“He’ll bring quality into that midfield area that we’ve really lacked. He knows the position, he’s played the position. He’ll help Declan Rice. He’ll help Jude Bellingham and he could possibly knit the whole thing together.”

OK, OK, one more email re selection chat and it comes from Liam Crowley.

It’s a shame that Wayne Rooney’s England XI is so readily dismissed (probably by Southgate as well as yourself to be fair), because it’s absolutely the right one to go with. Mainly because it’s the only one that actually plays players in their actual positions (baffling decision not to take a fit left-back not withstanding).

You’re now sending emails about Alexander-Arnold and Gallagher in your droves but I’m not sure I have the energy to stretch out the debate any longer. My personal two penn’orth is that Mainoo ought to start alongside Rice, but sadly that’s not likely to happen.

Some more emails on Trent Alexander-Arnold and the pros and cons of picking him:

Chris Kirkham says: “I agree with keeping Trent. His range of passing is unequalled. Talents like his have to be nurtured, not squandered in favour of runners and grifters. England’s problem is having nothing on the left side to help the midfield or get to the byline. I’m a Liverpool supporter but I feel Grealish should have been taken, with any left-footer picked behind him.”

Keiran Betteley weighs in: “In answer to Peter Tomlin, the issue with Trent is not that he can’t occasionally play a nice pass, we know he can and that’s why many people want him in the team. The issue is that as a defensive mid his positional sense is just not good enough, both on and off the ball. He doesn’t cover the right spaces when the opposition has the ball and thus leaves us exposed, and he doesn’t move into the right spaces when we have the ball and are trying to play through. That makes it really easy for the opposition press because he’s not giving his teammate (e.g. Rice, Stones or Walker) an easy out ball.

“If you’re going to play him, it likely needs to be instead of Walker (or with Walker as a third centre back, though I’m not a fan of that option). That removes Walker’s obvious inadequacies with the ball at his feet. I’m not sure Southgate trusts him enough to be the sole defensive option on the right flank and thus he’s a bit snookered.”

Mbappé ready for France return despite 'hindering' mask

The two 5pm games today are Netherlands v Austria and France v Poland. Both should be extremely watchable. All eyes will be on Kylian Mbappé and whether he starts – with a protective mask on – for Les Bleus.

Didier Deschamps said the swelling on Mbappé’s broken nose had reduced. The France manager said his captain was “raring to go” despite the injury.

“The reason he is wearing the mask is because he needs to protect his face in case certain instances occur,” he said. “It is maybe hindering but it’s something you need to get used to. It’s like when you have the 3D glasses, though now we have masks that are quite thin, as thin as possible.”

On email, Peter Tomlin has some fresh suggestions for Southgate …

I really don’t understand all the criticism of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Genuinely, he has been the only creative player in the England team in the first 2 games, not to mention the warm-up matches!

In the Sebia game he set Walker up for a great chance, he put countless balls through to Saka in both games, including the one he headed wide, he has created way more than any other player, he’s a threat on free-kicks & corners, he made more forward advances than anyone else, etc, etc.

When he was taken off last game we created nothing. Gallagher has a lot of energy but where will that get us? I am genuinely concerned about tonight’s game now. Even the Guardian gave [TAA] a score of 4 out of 10 for the last match despite the fact that he was our best midfielder!

He has been criticised because he lost the ball twice. On one of those occasions he won the ball back! When Guehi did it, he was praised for his recovery. Kane gave the ball away & cost us a goal, Stones has given the ball away twice on the edge of the area, as has Trippier. I’m not saying Trent has been outstanding but, Walker & half a game for Bellingham apart, he’s probably been the best of a poor bunch. I would be looking elsewhere to make changes.

Trent should be RWB with Walker, Stones & Guehi in the middle & Gomez at LWB, Bellingham, Rice & Foden across midfield, Kane & Saka in front.

Please will somebody agree with me?

Do you think Southgate is hoping that Gallagher is the modern day equivalent of Hargreaves under Sven. Running around loads and letting the better players get on with the exciting stuff like passing and scoring goals.

So it looks like it’ll be Conor Gallagher providing an injection of energy and work ethic into the England midfield tonight. As critical as people may be of Southgate for such a change, England do require a vast improvement in their pressing and the Chelsea man will help there. Kobbie Mainoo might have been the more pulse-raising selection, or perhaps Jude Bellingham dropping into the No 8 role, but Gallagher has done well twice off the bench.

Here’s the Guardian’s snippet on him, from our complete guide to every player at Euro 2024:

UK police have said there were no arrests and no reports of disorder last night, as 10,000 England fans descended on the centre of Cologne before the Slovenia game.

Scenes around the Heumarkt were lively throughout the day and at around 10pm the streets were thronged with young fans drinking, cheering and singing songs about the Scots. But in an atmosphere that would have seemed unlikely a generation ago, crowds were peppered with families, as well as tourists trying to join in (and capture events on camera).

The UK Football Policing Unit said this experience was “indicative of what we have seen across Germany so far, with the vast majority of England fans behaving extremely well.”

All the noises from the England camp suggest that it will be Conor Gallagher that replaces Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield against Slovenia and these fresh quotes from Declan Rice to 5Live this morning only seem to strengthen that theory. Rice played with Gallagher in the youth teams at Chelsea before moving to West Ham. The quote about Rice “feeling safe and secure” with Gallagher is mildly interesting, might be that he doesn’t feel the same with TAA.

I have played with Gallagher at academy level, played against him at Palace and Chelsea. He is a team-mate I would love to have on my team, he works his socks off, you feel so secure and safe in there with him. I think he has surprised so many people this year with his ability on the ball, how he breaks forward with it, how he gets into the box, scores goals. I think he is a really positive player and he has come on so much over the past few years as well, you can really see that within himself how confident he is.

Every time I get to play with Con, it hasn’t been much, I have really enjoyed it because I know him really well as a guy, I know his family really well and he is a lovely boy and it is another great chance to stamp our mark.

This was the goal that did for Croatia. Quite a strike.

Not sure there has ever been a more desperate player of the match photo.

However, there was quite a nice moment in the post-match press conference.

Preamble

The morning after the night before. Croatia and Italy fans will be waking up in Leipzig with very different hangovers. Croatia came within a minute or two of leapfrogging their opponents into second place in Group B, but ultimately a 98th-minute Mattia Zaccagni screamer means it is the Azzurri that join Spain in the last 16.

Spain top the group with nine points, five goals scored, none conceded. Albania finish bottom and despite having their moments and a raucous set of fans, are out of Euro 2024. Here’s how things finished in Group B.

Pos\tTeam\tP\tGD\tPts
1\tSpain\t3\t5\t9
2\tItaly\t3\t0\t4
3\tCroatia\t3\t-3\t2
4\tAlbania\t3\t-2\t1

Croatia are not yet out, as they still have slim hopes of qualifying as one of the four best third-placed teams of the six groups. But on just two points they need a very particular set of results to be one of those teams.

 Portugal to beat Georgia
 Turkey to beat Czech Republic
 England to beat Slovenia by three or more goals
 Denmark to beat Serbia

As per Uefa, the four best third-placed teams across the six groups are determined, in the order given, by the following criteria:

1) Higher number of points
2) Goal difference
3) Goals scored
4) Higher number of wins
5) Lower disciplinary record
6) Position in the overall European Qualifiers rankings

A lot of those results do indeed seem likely, but as anyone that has ever put an accumulator on, these things rarely happen all at once.

That was yesterday, this is today. We have a whopping four games for you today, every one of them a potential cracker.

France v Poland (5pm BST)
Netherlands v Austria (5pm)
Denmark v Serbia (8pm)
England v Slovenia (8pm)

“FOUR games, Jeremy. That’s insane”.
