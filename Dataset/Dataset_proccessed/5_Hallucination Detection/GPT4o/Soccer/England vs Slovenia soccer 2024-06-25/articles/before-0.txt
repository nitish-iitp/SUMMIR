Slovenia have warned England they will be taking shots from distance - because they don’t believe Gareth Southgate’s side will bother to close them down.

The only goal the Three Lions have conceded here in Germany was when Denmark midfielder Morten Hjulmand took aim from 30 yards during last Thursday’s 1-1 draw in Frankfurt.

Much has been made of England’s inability to press opponents - captain Harry Kane said they didn’t know who was supposed to go and when - and the Slovenians say they are ready to exploit that weakness, especially striker Benjamin Sesko and his lethal right boot.

‘England conceded outside of the box – they’re not really the best at closing down this area, 20, 25 metres away from goal,’ said midfielder Timi Max Elsnik.

‘It’s like adidas on purpose make balls for tournaments to be lighter, faster, just because they want attractive football and the goals you see they’re unbelievable. It’s always like this, like in South Africa, the Jabulani, in Brazil, in the last World Cup. It’s like they make special kind of balls, and they produce more spectacular goals.

 Are Harry Kane and Declan Rice right to bite back at Gary Lineker's criticism or have they been needlessly wound up? 

‘You can really shoot this one from 30 metres, and if you hit it well the keeper has small chances. Sesko is always looking for the opportunities, and he’s definitely going to try to score against England.’

Elsnik made his professional debut at Derby County under Gary Rowett, and he told his former manager’s podcast, ‘Breaking Lines’, that Slovenia do not fear England. A draw should be enough to see them through on three points.

‘If you put them (England) under pressure, if you’re confident in yourself, they have problems also, like we saw in the first two games,’ he said. 

‘For us, it’s just mentality. Don’t be scared of them, like we weren’t scared of Denmark and Serbia. They all have two legs, like we do. Two feet. They’re humans. It doesn’t matter how much they’re worth.’
