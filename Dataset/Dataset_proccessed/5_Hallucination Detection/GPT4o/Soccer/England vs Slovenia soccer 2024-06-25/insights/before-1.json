        "ITV's lead presenter Mark Pougatch has become embroiled in a journey from hell as he attempts to reach Berlin to host England's clash with Slovenia.",
        "Gareth Southgate's side need to beat Slovenia to be assured of top spot and avoid facing hosts Germany in the Last 16.",
        "Boss Southgate is hopeful Pougatch will enjoy the game if he finally does make it to Berlin. England have endured a difficult opening two games so far, though are all but assured of a place in the knockouts.",
        "Southgate stated: 'Whatever I say is fairly irrelevant, we have to do it on the pitch. We're all on the same page. The route forward was pretty simple to highlight and we have to go and deliver it. I'm expecting we do that tomorrow.'",
        "Southgate added: 'The mood is very good. We know the world we live in, there will always be external noise but it shouldn't affect us. What's important is the internal. The performance is what we're focussing on. The results have basically put us in the next round already and now we want to top the group.'"
