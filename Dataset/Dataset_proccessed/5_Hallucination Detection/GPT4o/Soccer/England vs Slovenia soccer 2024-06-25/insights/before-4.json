        "Euro 2024 Group C all boils down to the events of Tuesday evening, where England and Slovenia clash at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne aiming to fulfil their knockout aspirations.",
        "Gareth Southgate's men have accrued four points from a possible six courtesy of a slender success over Serbia and disappointing draw with Denmark, but they cannot finish any lower than third and will be confirmed as group winners with a victory.",
        "Even a point would be enough to guarantee a top-two ranking for the Three Lions, who are two points better off than both Denmark and Slovenia, who have played out two 1-1 stalemates with the Scandinavians and Serbia thus far.",
        "By virtue of conceding a last-minute goal to the latter, Matjaz Kek's men sit third in the standings, but the formula for them is also simple; win and they are through.",
        "Interestingly, Slovenia have the edge on England when it comes to overall form in recent months, as Kek's men have gone unbeaten in their last eight matches, while the Three Lions have just two wins to shout about from their last seven contests."

        "England and Slovenia's inaugural battle came in a 2009 friendly at Wembley - a game that Kek was also in charge of the visitors for during his first spell as head coach - but Defoe and Frank Lampard ensured that his London stopover would be a miserable one."
