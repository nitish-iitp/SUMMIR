For me is strange with Hategan appointments. He didn't have a domestic games in 8 stages !!!, but he is appointed for european games. I don't understand really his situation.

Another interesting fact is that he gets Italian VARs, of course nothing really new for him, because even before the terrible event, he was used to do so. But... he could easily appear with Romanian VARs in some cases, given also that they are trusted by UEFA. You can see indeed Barbu with Coltescu.
It seems as he is a bit "disconnected" from the Romanian reality, but his path as UEFA referee continues regularly. We were already informed that indeed he can't work with Kovacs. But before all, that's just for discussion, after the incident he had, one must only be happy in all cases watching him on the field!
At moment I would say that it seems rather difficult to be back at the very old times, but no care and no worry about that.

Trefoloni has left (unexpected) his role in the Italian Association and now he would be without any duty, but I see that he is getting more and more assignments in UEFA, and also very important ones. Something important for him coming in Nyon? I think that, based on observation, one can't exclude that. We will see. Hard to think he will stay without an official position for a too long time, but yes, I already know the question some readers will do... another Italian after Rosetti and Collina? Maybe another position for him? We'll see. Just my idea, at moment.
At the same time, we didn't read Velasco name in recent times, as before. It is possible he is the VAR supervisor for committee, but strange that he hasn't appeared in any single game as observer on last months.
About the appointments, mostly regular choices, but well... Treimanis from the dream to Elite referee now assigned to that game! Very surprising even if you think that commitee ranks him at moment "only" as regular and experienced Cat.1.

I would choose Kovacs.

Istvan Kovac was a bad and terrible referee in the last Euro. Why did you choose him to referee a match of this size?

Philipp S2 September 2024 at 14:07

a) He wasn't and isn't a bad referee, he just had one bad game at the EURO. His other match was fine as was his EL final before. No need to keep him away from big matches, I think
b) It's only NL MD1. The game is sonorous, but not really very important.
c) Unlike several alternatives, he hasn't refereed the two teams recently.

Who would be your choice?

Mouiz bousiouda2 September 2024 at 20:23

I will choose referee Felix Zwayer to referee the France vs Italy match.

I'm surprised UEFA focus on Balázs Berke. He was terrible in POLTUR friendly in June. Now he got UECL play-off and quite good AZESWE in UNL.

Typical of Rosetti, now Schärer gets everything. There would be also other options inside the Elite category, but this is the management. I don't say that he shouldn't get games, but so many big assignments in a short time, when you have so many referees to appoint, well, it's not good management for me. And the Swiss could have easily got another game! No problems on that.
We have also Jovanovic back, in the competition that cost him a lot of his Elite Career when he officiated Italy - England, but surely, as somebody said earlier, it was an unfair treatment later, with definitely not enough number of assignments in a very long time.
Confirmation of the focus on Saggi as next Norwegian after Eskas, with Undiano Mallenco as observer and a very good game, I would say. But he must definitely improve...

Good assignment to me; new names like as Barbu, Berke, Petrescu Saggi, Delajod and Sharer for big match. I appreciate especially the attention to Saggi and Petrescu. Three Romanian appointed in only one match day is a good result for the federation. I'm curious to see if all of them will be assisted by compatriots in VAR role. A pity disappointed for Treimanis, his match is far away from first class category

So, Oliver the man for replacements, after having made the same in a qualifier, but in that case it was for a compatriot.
Really sorry again for Jovanovic, whatever the reason is, hard times continue for him, without an end.

For Saturday:
Turpin sees Germany again after the EURO opener. GER-HUN have been some challenging matches in the last years, so no surprise to have a top referee there. Will be interesting, whether appointments this season will indicate Letexier as number 1 and Turpin as number 2 in France now or whether they will get similar matches.
Rumsas as first non-Elite in league A, confirming that he is a candidate for promotion. Probably some interesting CL games will follow for him to test him further.
With Sanchez and Grinfeeld two referees from the lower half (or third) of the Elite category in league B. IRL-ENG obviously an interesting pairing and GEO-CZE the rematch of an EURO game. So reasonable appointments.
Good games for Godinho and Schnyder. The Swiss certainly is on a good development path, while the Portuguese hasn't made much progress in the last years (no EL debut yet).
Rather disappointing games for Lukjancukas and Balakin, who both had CL last season, while Minakovic gets a normal appointment as NL debut.

Good analysis, I just indeed wanted to say that Balakin appointment for that game, doesn't suit then with the treatment by committee so far, given also the participation at EURO as reserve referee. One should expect more to justify what he has achieved so far. A better game was definitely possible, of course not a very big match, but at least something in the middle.
Sanchez Martinez for the UK derby, I expect a good performance this time by the Spanish referee.
Rumsas at moment can be maybe considered as candidate nr. 1 for being promoted to Elite category on December.

Almost all observers for CL MD1 have been assigned, at moment only two games are missing and of course one involving an Italian team (Juventus). Only one committee member so far, in Monaco - Barcelona, Sajin. Another interesting assignment could be Vassaras for Bayern game at home against Dinamo Zagreb. Here a test for Cat. 1 is fully expected.
Most of the appointments seem to indicate experienced Elite referees in charge, like Dutch observer Koopman for Milan - Liverpool.
Rocchi will observe Celtic - Slovan, another Category 1 in development can be expected here.

Northern Irish referee Keith Kennedy (FIFA between 2017-2021) has passed away at the age of 33.

He was present at the very first day of competition in the inaugural UEFA Nations League, handling LATAND on September 6, 2018. Referees who 'kicked-off' the UNL as a tournament that day were Orsato, Taylor, Turpin, Massa, Meler, Jorgji, Maae and Kennedy.

May he rest in peace, my condolences to his loved ones and Northern Irish refereeing.

Yes

Ferd5 September 2024 at 21:07

When?

Chefren5 September 2024 at 21:33

I don't (and I can't!) know exactly when, but since observers started to appeared yesterday (and maybe the day before, since I hadn't checked) for CL games, we should think that referees have been appointed during the UEFA Course (it started on Monday but I'm sorry I don't have more detailed info about).

Ferd5 September 2024 at 22:14

I understand the Champions League referee appointments but isn't it a little early for the Europa League appointments?There are still 20 days until the Europa League matches.Is it right to make appointments this early?

Chefren5 September 2024 at 22:20

The committee works in this way by years, even 20 days before is possible. Once you have planned your names for Champions League, you can manage the rest for Europa and Conference, one answer to your question can be that we will not see same referees in CL the week before and then also the week after in Europa League, so waiting 6 or 7 days more before doing the other assignments doesn't make that relevant difference, if you look only at the long time.

Very poor game from Berke, considering how fair it was. Several soft fouls called, and a few completely missed. Also could (should) have sent GK off with the penalty incident in 80'.

Missed penalty in 45'+3' leading to OFR.
80' I agree with YC because not-genuine DOGSO doesn't almost exist nowadays...

Chefren5 September 2024 at 21:03

Here the one given after OFR (OFR not shown in the video):

Then the direct call in second half:

MQ5 September 2024 at 21:34

I know that DOGSO reds are exceedingly rare in similar situations, but I feel that you have to separate the attempted save (the initial lunge with his legs) from the panicked grabbing of the attacker's foot following it. I can't view that as a single action.

What kind of observer is Rien Koopman? Is he known or rather unknown?

Rather long time experienced observer for regular Elite referees.
Nothing particular if he is appointed, should mean just a "normal" game for the referee involved.

Quite controversial RC for DOGSO after OFR by Siebert. Initial call was penalty and YC, then changed since the challenge clearly occurred outside. But it rather looked like the attacker grabbed the defender‘s arm which caused the defender to fall into the attacker. Swiss commentator labeled the decision as scandalous.

In all cases, YC a bad decision whether inside or outside, please tell me how that one, once whistled, should be considered as fair challnge to play ball. The German referee should have issued red card in all cases, both inside and outside the box. Impossible to think about a SPA...

Jonas5 September 2024 at 22:32

6 YC in for minutes, 1 was a second YC for Swiss Captain. Fully correct, but Siebert honestly lost the game a bit there

lukas0865 September 2024 at 22:52

Looks like a clear offensive foul before the first red card (pulling an arm causing defender to fall). Plus AR was at least 7 meters behind the line so it was impossible for him to correctly detect if the foul was inside or outside the penalty area.
Then a foul (step on hand) before 1-0, all Swiss players raised their hands to stop the game but Danish continued playing and scored a goal. A smart referee would stop the game when the ball was in the neutral zone.
From that moment it was impossible for Siebert to re-gain control. Dirty fouls, another red card etc.
If there was a question about Zwayer vs. Siebert, I have no doubts after this match.

Don't think it was a foul before 1:0, to play on was the right decision. But agree about the first red card, better decision would have been whistling offensive foul by Danish attacker. Also Embolo could have been sent off, the Swiss really lost their heads after going 1:0 down. Difficult match for Siebert...

I mut answer to a criticism I made about Treimanis appointment, well, given the final score, but even before, one could say that they tried to give the best possible to those country, in a game that could have ended with an epic outcome. Indeed, this has happened.
After 20 years, same result, San Marino wins a game, but this wasn't a friendly.
There was a disallowed LIE goal in first half, tight offside in the build up missed by AR1.

Second penalty whistled by Nyberg, very clear one. Defender going deliberately against attacker. Referee behind with a good positioning, as it had been for previous whistle. This is what committee wants to see, not only correct decision, but how you take them, being ready, and with a physical condition helping you in following the action. Very good on such crucial scenes by the Swedish, I think you can't blame him too much for the handball, that's almost impossible to see and rather always VAR stuff (but if you call it live, you are a phenomenon). Further issues with technology for th Swedish, and a very good way to deal with, calling both coaches and explaining something. I think he is experiencing in such months, as Mikael said some weeks ago, the most challenging times of his international career, at least so far. He is doing well, I think.

Was the OFR by Siebert that led to the first RC according to protocol? I think that inside/outside penalty area is a purely factual decision and therefore an OFR is not necessairy. Or am I missing something?

Good question! As stated above by Chefren, YC and penalty for DOGSO wouldn‘t be correct either since it was not an attempt to play the ball. So, maybe Siebert did not deem the foul as DOGSO but SPA. In this scenario, an OFR would make sense. But of course we don‘t really know

Chefren6 September 2024 at 12:31

The OFR is never wrong when there is one of the four motivations that the protocol provides, as in this case the red card to be issued.
It has become a standard to move from outside to inside and viceversa without calling to the monitor, but this is not an obligation, in all cases the referee could go and see before the change.
In this specific case, then, it is evident that Siebert had not understood the nature of the foul at all, so it was right to go and see first and, obviously, we can't exclude that the VAR also communicated to him that there could have been a foul before (further addition for the analysis to the video).

I'm watching KAZ-NOR. There isn't too much to mention so far. However, I don't understand why they gave Lindhout this game in the first place. His strengths are his fitness level, pace and he has mastered the advantage signal. His style is lenient and background-minded, hence he would suit perfectly to, let’s say, technical and fair teams, with a dynamic display. However, UEFA keeps assigning him to rather sloppy and/or physical games, where he cannot show his strongest aspects. If we compare how UEFA has always used, lets say e.g. Turpin, to his strengths? For the record, I don’t say that Lindhout is doing a poor job. I just noticed that for the last 2 seasons or so, UEFA never really puts him in his strength, which is a pity imo.

@DrMr: Good job. I expect you to do that everytime from now on there is anything even remotely questionable on the blog!

It also changes nothing regarding the fact that UEFA on one hand thinks Group D matches need referees like Balakin while they are completely fine with having non-FIFAs as FOs. How easily that can go wrong was shown by the Olympics.

I expect you also to admonish everyone who commented on the FO choices there! I expect you to be very very familiar with the refs that were FOs there of course. ;)

Slovenia - Austria: OFR for handball. Correct call by VAR Popa.
Impossible to see live for referee, even more from his position, and it was very quick, as always happens with handballs. The replay showed a more than evident deflection with a totally open arm, unnatural position. Video suggests it was a very big penalty, but almost impossible to detect live.
I really don't know how much these situations can be penalizing for referee, here not only Petrescu didn't see and it was impossible, but he absolutely didn't expect that.

Five YCs for Saggi at HT, all correct/supportable IMO: TUR11 in 25' (reckless illegal charge), WAL8 in 28' (SPA, both holding and tackle), WAL11 in 29' (off-the-ball kick), TUR9 in 31' (UB/aggressive behaviour towards opponent after possible PK, Saggi played on with no VAR intervention) and TUR22 in 39' (SPA)

(Context: He gave a PK for handball to a defender who saved the ball with his knee/thigh, nowhere close to a handball)

For me Delajod has never reached a fully trusted level in France. He is not as strong as Wattelier for example. He didn’t even look convinced by giving that penalty. Bizarre

Chefren6 September 2024 at 22:21

Watched the situation, quite late whistle, one can't be sure that it was a direct call by Delajod, but maybe even by AR2 (but in that case, extremely strange...). Possible that Delajod delayed the whistle only for knowing what would have happened later, but he didn't have the proper reaction of a referee ready to whistle a penalty when the incident happened.
It's confirmed that the French has a rather "aggressive" way of refereeing, including both calls and cards. Something that now many referees try to avoid for keeping themselves safe in modern football.
BTW in such incidents, players must be aware that VAR will solve everything, there isn't any need to go crazy, it's even worse because you can get cards, but yes, it's easy to talk, while on the pitch it's definitely different :)

OFR is a very interesting case, indeed.
Video: https://dubz.co/c/f59e27
Very sliding tackle. No contact with ball, I think soft contact with the right foot of attacker, but also a bit of scene by him in my opinion. Certainly, arguments are clear for a whistle, but I don't know how much for OFR. To me in this circumstance, the strong reason for allowing VAR to intervene was NO BALL... but then we can discuss about the rest for sure.

Chefren7 September 2024 at 12:14

And the keeper does nothing in my opinion, if foul, only by defender, i think.

Not a challenging game for Schaerer, just some situations in second half to be rewatched (first half very fair).

1' Goal after a few seconds from kick off, Donnarumma making complaints against the referee, management
https://streambug.org/cv/bb7173
It has been explained that the Italian goalkeeper said to Swiss referee that he was not ready with his gloves when game was kicked off, so he added that referee had to wait for his OK. That'a simply incredible, very sorry to say, but it is not the first time, the Italian goalkeeper just wants to be a protagonist in all situations, of course 0 responsibility for Schaerer, who could have even booked him for dissent...

49' YC for impeding goalkeeper action, correct decision.
https://streambug.org/cv/ec0407

53' Possible YC for SPA / reckless challenge, I don't think it was a clear SPA. Short whistle by referee indicates the management in his mind about the moment of the game.
https://streambug.org/cv/af9638

54' Possible YC for reckless, advantage is OK, ball coming to a temmate in a better position (but then back, just bad luck for referee), nevertheless for me missed clear card for this tackle from behind.
https://streambug.org/cv/cfb43d

60' Penalty area incident and YC
https://streambug.org/cv/6c7a32
Two incidents in the same clip. OK About the YC, mandatory. The penalty area incident is a supportable play on, but penalty could have been whistled (never VAR stuff). We have two couples of players holding each other, but the one on Retegui was extyremely risky for defender. I think the arm of Italian player on opponent was reason for no intervention, but, especially at the end and when ball is already passed, you see from last replay how much clear this shirt pulling was. Then, the last challenge with the two players close to goal line: nothing to report.

Faroe Islands - North Macedonia 1-1 with two penalties awarded by Lithuanian referee.
6' (FO) - holding after corner kick (and YC for not genuine SPA)
49' (MK) - tripping
For the rest pretty easy game.

The first penalty was unfortunately nonsense. Of course, both players were holding each other, but no one expected a penalty, not even the player who was supposedly being held. Letting the game continue is the right decision here.

Chefren7 September 2024 at 18:43

I agree. It was rather a very soft call, absolutely unexpected in the context of that moment, after the whistle I had a doubt it was maybe for handball. OK, supportable about the holding, but very harsh, better not to whistle I think. However, observer can back referee because never a clear mistake.

Penalty by Balakin in the added time of first half: how much it was keeper committing a foul against attacker, than the latter going deliberately against keeper (different paths for the two players involved), to get a call? I think this penalty was "built" very well by attacker, VAR can do nothing. Keeper booked, he had a reaction against Balakin, to me at the border of a second YC.

Ersöglü777 September 2024 at 19:07

Also a decision where letting play continue would have been the better choice. It's truly a problem that many referees believe that if there is a minimal contact, the better decision is to give a penalty, but unfortunately this is not the right approach to be honest.

The problem is also in today's culture about a penalty, this has reached the maximum in Italy. Minimum contact = always penalty. Referees can be afraid they have missed a big one, in most of the incidents they immediately whistle without working mentally for a while before taking a decision and yes, it's easier to make a call than to play on because you feel you have done something, while the contrary NO CALL would leave in you some worries. Of course that's not valid for all referees, but most of today football works in this way.
