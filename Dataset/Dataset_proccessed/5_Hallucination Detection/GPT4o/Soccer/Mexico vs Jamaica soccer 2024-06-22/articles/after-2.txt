Hello to all and welcome to our live coverage of Mexico vs. Jamaica!

Compartir en Twitter

Mexico have participated in the Copa America a total of 10 times in the past. They've had a good amount of success overall, having finished runners-up twice and third place on three other occasions. But since 2007, they didn't make it past the quarterfinals in the three tournaments they played.

Jamaica have only participated in two editions of the Copa America, in 2015 and 2016. They didn't make it out of the group in either year. In fact, they are yet to score a single goal and earn a single point through six Copa America games in their history.

This Jamaica team has been on a good run as of late, so this could be their opportunity to finally break through in the tournament. As for Mexico, expectations are high as always, although they've grown used to disappointing in these types of international tournaments in recent years.
