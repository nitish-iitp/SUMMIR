India vs Mauritius Inter-Continental Cup, Live Streaming: India men's football team will be taking on Mauritius in the opening match of Inter-Continetal Cup on Tuesday in Hyderabad. Seeking to put the heartbreak in the World Cup Qualifiers behind, the Indian men's football team will look to start from scratch under new head coach Manolo Marquez.
