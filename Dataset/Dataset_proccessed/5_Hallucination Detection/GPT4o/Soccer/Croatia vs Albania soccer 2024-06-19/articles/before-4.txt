How Albania could line up against Croatia
By Jonathan O'Shea

Beaten in their Euro 2024 opener last weekend, Albania cannot afford to lose again on Wednesday, when they meet Group B rivals Croatia in Hamburg.

Another defeat would almost certainly mean elimination, so Sylvinho will consider making changes to the XI that lined up against Italy last time out.

Winger Jasir Asani - a key player in qualifying - has recovered from an ankle injury and may still start in the final third.

If required, Arber Hoxha - who plays for Croatian giants Dinamo Zagreb - could be called upon to deputise against some familiar faces; Besiktas forward Ernest Muci is another contender.

Having almost snatched a late equaliser against Italy, former Barcelona striker Rey Manaj is also vying for promotion from the bench, after Chelsea's Armando Broja failed to make much of an impact in Dortmund.

One man that did make his mark on Saturday night was Nedim Bajrami, who took just 23 seconds to score the fastest goal in European Championship history.

The Swiss-born star joins Lecce's Ylber Ramadani and Kristjan Asllani of Inter Milan in a talented midfield trio, while another Italy-based player, Berat Djimsiti, captains the Eagles from central defence.

Albania possible starting lineup: Strakosha; Hysaj, Ismajli, Djimsiti, Mitaj; Asllani, Ramadani; Laci, Bajrami, Asani; Broja
