Guinea vs Senegal LIVE!

The holders look in ominous form as their title defence continues to thrive at the Africa Cup of Nations. Already through to the last 16 after back-to-back opening wins, Senegal confirmed their spot as Group C winners on Tuesday night and maintained their 100 per cent record in defence of their first title from 2021 as they brushed aside their west African neighbours in a feisty derby clash in Yamoussoukro.

After a torrid first half low on quality that featured no shortage of flashpoints, centre-back Abdoulaye Seck headed home a Krepin Diatta free-kick to give the Lions of Teranga a deserved lead shortly past the hour mark, with Sadio Mane missing a huge chance and also seeing a goal chalked off for offside.

Mane turned provider for substitute Iliman Ndiaye to wrap up the victory on the cusp of stoppage time, with Guinea pipped to second spot in Group C courtesy of Cameroon's dramatic late win over The Gambia in Bouake. However, Kaba Diawara's side will still advance with four points as one of the four best third-place group finishers at the tournament. Follow Guinea vs Senegal reaction from AFCON live below!

Cameroon will now face Group A runners-up Nigeria at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium in Abidjan on Saturday night for a place in the quarter-finals.

Guinea look set to face surprise Group A winners Equatorial Guinea at Abidjan's Alassane Ouattara Stadium on Sunday, while Senegal will meet a third-place team from Group A or F - so either hosts Ivory Coast or likely one of DR Congo, Zambia or Tanzania - back at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium next Monday night.

Ghana are now confirmed as out.

23 JANUARY 2024

It's all over in Bouake, with Cameroon winning 3-2 to rescue their AFCON campaign and pip Guinea to second place behind Senegal in Group C!

Guinea finish third, but four points will be enough to take one of those four slots for the best third-place group finishers.

Guinea 0-2 Senegal

Full-time

Senegal easily through as Group C winners as the holders maintain their 100 per cent start to their first AFCON title defence.

Will it be second or third for Guinea, though? We await the full-time score from Bouake...

Guinea 0-2 Senegal

95 mins: By the way, that third Gambia goal in Bouake was eventually ruled out for handball!

That means Cameroon are still heading through as runners-up from Group C, with Guinea likely having to make do with third.

They would still go through as a best third-place team with four points, though.

Unless they can score late here and jump back into second on goal difference. Six minutes of added time almost up...

23 JANUARY 2024
Guinea 0-2 Senegal

93 mins: Guinea work Edouard Mendy for the first time tonight in stoppage time as a swivelling Morgan Guilavogui volley is well saved by the former Chelsea goalkeeper.

Guinea 0-2 Senegal

It is absolute carnage in Bouake, by the way.

Cameroon went 3-2 ahead and were going through in second place at Guinea's expense for a moment, but it's now 3-3!

Crazy drama at AFCON yet again.

GOAL! Guinea 0-2 Senegal | Iliman Ndiaye 90'

90 mins: And that wraps it up on the cusp of stoppage time!

Former Sheffield United forward Ndiaye with an excellent finish from Mane's tidy assist to put this game to bed.

Fulham's Fode Ballo-Toure is also on.

23 JANUARY 2024
Guinea 0-1 Senegal

88 mins: Wow, The Gambia took a shock lead against Cameroon but they've been pegged back just a minute later.

2-2 now in Bouake with time running out.

23 JANUARY 2024
Guinea 0-1 Senegal

85 mins: GOOOAAA... NO!

Iliman Ndiaye plays a lovely through ball to Sadio Mane, who slots home past Ibrahim Kone.

But the offside flag is rightly raised and this won't count.

1-0 to Senegal it remains.
