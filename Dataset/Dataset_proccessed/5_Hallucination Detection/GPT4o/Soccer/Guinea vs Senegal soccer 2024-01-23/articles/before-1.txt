Injury & team news

Guinea will face the absence of their captain, Francois Kamano, who received a straight red card in the 1-1 draw against Cameroon in the initial game. Serhou Guirassy is uncertain for the match due to a hamstring strain, while Mohamed Bayo is expected to lead the frontline once again.

Senegal, on the other hand, may continue to be without defender Moussa Niakhite, who missed the second game due to an injury sustained in the first. Midfielder Lamine Camara and striker Habib Diallo could potentially be absent after sustaining injuries in the 3-1 victory over Cameroon in the last match. Nicolas Jackson may earn his first tournament start in the forward position, and veteran Idrissa Gueye could be included in the starting XI to compensate for the team’s injuries.
