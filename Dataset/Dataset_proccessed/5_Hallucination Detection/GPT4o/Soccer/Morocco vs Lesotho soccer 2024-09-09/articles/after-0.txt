Ibrahim Diaz led the Moroccan national football team, today, to a difficult victory against Lesotho (1-0), at the Adrar Stadium in Agadir, in the second round of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

National coach Walid Regragui made several changes to the national team starting lineup, such as the inclusion of Adam Aznou at left back, Dari for Aboukar, and Richardson for Amrabat in the defensive midfield.

The beginning of the first half witnessed strong pressure from the Lions on the Lesotho defense in order to score an early goal.

Despite Morocco’s dominance in the first half, the national team did not succeed in reaching the Lesotho net, and this half ended in a negative draw (0-0).

In the second half, the Moroccan national team continued to put pressure on the Lesotho defense.

In additional time, Ibrahim Diaz managed to conquer the Lesotho net to give the Moroccan national team a hard-fought victory.

It is worth mentioning that the Moroccan national team had won its first match by four goals to one against Gabon last Friday at the Adrar Stadium in Agadir.
