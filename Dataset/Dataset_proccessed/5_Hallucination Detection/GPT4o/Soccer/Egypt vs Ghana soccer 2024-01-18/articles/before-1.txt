Former Black Stars midfielder Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu has expressed confidence in Ghana’s potential to secure victory against Egypt in their second group stage match at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).

The Black Stars are scheduled to face the Pharaohs on Thursday, January 18, 2024. Both teams are eager to secure their first win in the tournament.

Despite Egypt’s 2-2 draw against Mozambique and Ghana’s 2-1 defeat to Cape Verde in their respective opening matches,

Badu remains optimistic about the Black Stars’ chances against Egypt.

In an interview with the media, Badu acknowledged the challenge of the encounter but expressed hope for Ghana’s success with the right preparations.

“Playing against Egypt will be a very crucial game. They drew against Mozambique and will now want the points against Ghana. The Black Stars also need to win against Egypt, but I think it will be difficult. It is a crucial game on Thursday, but I am very optimistic that with the right start and preparations, we can sail through against them,” said Agyemang Badu.

The former Black Stars midfielder highlighted the importance of coach Chris Hughton’s proper selection for the match against Egypt.

As both teams aim for a crucial victory to enhance their tournament prospects, the upcoming clash promises to be a closely contested and highly anticipated encounter, set to kick off at 8 p.m. on Thursday.

If Ghana loses, it puts them out of the competition, even though there will still be one last match to play against Mozambique.
