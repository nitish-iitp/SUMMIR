Matchday LIVE with Steyn, Kumble and Moody

That is all from Chepauk, ladies and gentlemen. A topsy-turvy ODI that will go down as one of India's better wins. Australia have a lot to think about. See you tomorrow for more ODI World Cup action.

10.05pm Time for the presentation.

Winning captain Rohit Sharma: "Good feeling to come out on top. (Bowling and fielding) Magnificent. Especially the fielding. The fielding was something we really put our effort on. It was a great effort. In conditions like this it can be tough sometimes. We knew there would be assistance for everyone. Seamers got reverse, spinners bowled in nice areas. All in all a great effort. (Nervous at 3 for 2?) Yes I was to be honest. You don't want to start like that when chasing a target. Credit to Australia, but some loose shots there as well. But that happens, you want to get off the mark and score quickly in the powerplay. Hats off to Virat and KL - the way they stuck out there to create a match-winning partnership. (Adapting to next surface?) That will be the biggest challenge moving forward because we will play in different conditions. Might have to change combinations too and as a team we are prepared to do that. (Crowd) Chennai never disappoints. Crowd was brilliant from word go. For them to sitting in the heat and cheering says a lot."

Losing captain Pat Cummins: "(How far short was the score?) Atleast 50 odd. Tough trying to defend 200. (Challenges of batting?) Really good bowling attack. And facing spinners was tough. Was the kind of wicket you had to get yourself in. (Kohli drop) I've already forgotten about it! Not ideal, especially for his calibre. Four down for 10 would've been amazing but wasn't to be. (Hazlewood) Always poses questions with the ball. (What to tell the team before next game?) Have to have a review. Obviously a tough surface. Its just one game out of nine, no need to dwell over that. No regrets [about toss.]

Stat alert: India's 2/3 is the lowest score at the fall of third wicket from which any team went on to win in men's ODIs.

9.55pm In December 2021, Rohit Sharma had said "I want middle order to prepare for '10 for 3' situations." Today that situation arrived, and the team stood up. He'd be mighty pleased.

KL Rahul is the Player of the Match. "There weren't a lot of conversations with Kohli. I had just taken a shower and was hoping to put my feet up for half an hour after the fielding innings, but I had to come in. Virat said that I should play like Test cricket for a bit. Happy to play this for the team. There was a bit of help for the fast bowlers early on. Towards the end, the dew played a bit of a part for them. It was still two-paced. It wasn't a great wicket to bat on, neither was it too difficult. I think it was a good cricket wicket, that's what you get in South of India especially in Chennai. (Last shot) I hit it too well. I wanted to get a hundred by going four and six. Hopefully some other time I can get it."

9.51pm Two points for India, crawling out of a very big hole today, and its all thanks to KL Rahul (97*) and Virat Kohli (85). A stunning partnership when the pressure was extremely high. Rohit Sharma waits to meet Rahul and then gives him a tight hug. Rahul and Kohli share a smile as well before the teams shake hands.

The partnership was terrific but do not forget how the bowlers operated for India. Jadeja's three was the headline act, but Kuldeep and the rest chipped in too. "Chak de India" reverberates around the stadium and time, now, for a breather.

41.2
6
Cummins to Rahul, SIX runs

Game, set, and match - Rahul finishes on 97 and India win by six wickets. Rahul wanted to chip it over cover for four and have a shot at a century. But his timing is so good that he clears the boundary over cover! Nonetheless, he celebrates just how anyone would celebrate a ton, a fitting way to end the game.

Good length ball around off. Punched to cover

You know victory is imminent when the stadium plays Ma Tujhe Salam. Australia will feel disappointed not capitalising after India were 2 for 3.

Full ball around leg stump again. Rahul uses his feet once more to muscle this one over Hardik's head! Safe shot with mid-off up

40.1
6
Maxwell to Rahul, SIX runs

Shellacked! Maxwell goes full from around the stumps. Rahul comes dancing down the track and then uses his full bat swing to hammer a six over long off once more. Terrific footwork to get inside the ball's line from that angle and then execute the shot

Imagine Dragons' "Believer" playing in the stadium. A tribute to the India fans who kept hope when they went down 2/3.
