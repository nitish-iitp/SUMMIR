Has there been anyone better than Rohit Sharma when it comes to leading from the front in World Cup 2023? The India skipper was at it again as he took the responsibility of steering the team on a tough pitch at the Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium in Lucknow against defending champions England on Sunday, October 29.

Rohit Sharma missed his 8th World Cup hundred by 13 runs but his knock of 87 was worth its weight in gold as he steered the team on a pitch that was twe paced in Lucknow. It was Rohit Sharma's 5th 40-plus score, which includes a hundred and an 86, in the ongoing tournament.

Rohit Sharma showed he is capable of playing in all gears even as he promised before the World Cup that he would be more aggressive at the top. Rohit held the Indian innings together as wickets were falling around him with the top-order having a rare off day.

In Lucknow, Rohit got to his fifty in 66 balls, days after he hit a hundred in just 63 balls in a match-winning knock against Afghanistan in New Delhi, flaunting his rich experience and ability to adapt to different conditions, something that the top batters have been struggling to do in World Cup 2023.

Rohit Sharma tried to put pressure on England leg-spinner Adil Rashid in the 37th over as he tried to take the risk during his partnership with Suryakumar Yadav. However, Rohit hit it straight to the deep mid-wicket fielder Liam LIvingstone, falling for 87 in 101 balls. Rohit wonderfully mixed aggression with caution as he hit 10 boundaries and 3 sixes in a knock that would give him a lot of joy.

Rohit looked dejected as he was caught in the deep as the India captain looked determined to stay there till the end and steer the team to a competitive total.

Notably, it was the 4th time Rohit Sharma got out for 80s in ODI cricket in 2023. Only two other batters have gotten out in 80s as many as 4 times in a calendar year in ODI cricket.

Rohit Sharma - 4 in 2023
George Bailey - 4 in 2013
Kumar Sangakkara - 4 in 2006

Notably, Rohit Sharma had a chance to get to 100 against Pakistan in their World Cup 2023 match but the skipper fell for 86 to Shaheen Shah Afridi in a comfortable chase of 192 runs.

83 in 67 balls against Sri Lanka in Guwahati in January
81 in 57 balls against Australia in Rajkot in September
86 in 63 balls against Pakistan in Ahmedabad in October
97 in 101 balls against England in Lucknow in October

India huffed and puffed to 229 for 9 in 50 overs against England in Lucknow, thanks to a handy 49 from Suryakumar Yadav in the end and useful contributions from Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav.
