        "Sri Lanka will be up against the West Indies in the 2nd match of the West Indies in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2024. The match will be played at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Kandy on 23rd October 2024 at 02:30 PM IST.",

        "The pitch at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Kandy will allow for good stroke play and the batters will find it easy to bat on the surface. The surface will not allow a lot of assistance to the bowlers and wicket taking is going to be difficult. The average 1st innings score at this venue in the last 20 matches is 228 runs. The team winning the toss should look to bowl first as the majority of the games played on this ground have been won by the chasing side.",
        "Temperature is expected to be around 25.74 \u00b0C with 84% humidity. 1.97 m/s winds are expected. Cloud cover expected, so expect some movement to aid the pace bowlers. There is moderate rain expected which may affect playing conditions.",
        "In the 65 matches played between these 2 teams, batters of both teams have earned the most fantasy points for their respective teams so far."
