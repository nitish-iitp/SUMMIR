'Cover the entire ground': Sunil Gavaskar's message to ICC amid rain-marred Florida leg

In Short
India vs Canada Group A game was washed out due to wet oufield
3 out of the 4 games in Florida have been abandoned due to rain
Gavaskar said venues across the world need to have covers for the entire ground

Legendary Indian batter Sunil Gavaskar expressed his frustration over lack of covers for the entire ground at Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida. Gavaskar's comments came after India's final Group A game of the T20 World Cup against Canada was washed out due to rain on Saturday, June 15.

Despite no rain in Lauderhill on Saturday morning, a wet outfield due to overnight showers led to the Group A game getting washed out without a ball bowled. The pitch and the square were covered on Saturday morning, but the outfield had taken a lot of water from the overnight showers.

The umpires had two inspections before India's final Group A game was abandoned. Notably, the USA's game against Ireland on Friday was also washed out due to a wet outfield and rain in Florida on Friday. The result ensured USA's progress to the Super 8s while Pakistan, who had their eyes on Florida weather, were knocked out of the T20 World Cup in the group stage.

"My request to the ICC is to ensure there is cover for the entire ground if there is an ICC match. If the venue doesn't have the covers, don't give it to that venue. Give it to a ground that has got all covers," Gavaskar told Star Sports after India and Canada shared points in Florida.

'DON'T GIVE ANY EXCUSES'

Gavaskar said ICC has to ensure that grounds, especially hosting ICC events, have enough money to have larger covers. The former India captain said that each and every venue should have covers for the entire ground regardless of the drainage facility.

"It's something that the ICC needs to do. All the ground organisations have to have covers that cover the entire ground. This business of covering only the square... everybody has got money now.

"You can't give the excuse that you don't have money for covers. However, good your ground drainage system is, you have covers, the grounds will dry faster. People will get to see some cricket. It's so important for that important. We saw all those guys come from Tampa, Texas. They have travelled long. Here in America, where do they get to see so many top-class players? Give them the opportunity.
So get the covers for the entire ground. Everybody can do that," he added.

Sanjay Manjrekar, who was also on broadcast duty on Saturday, highlighted how Sri Lanka handled rain interruptions during the Asia Cup last year with larger covers that covered the entire part of the field.

Notably, three out of the four matches allotted to Florida in the T20 World Cup 2024 have been washed out due to rain. Pakistan will take on Ireland in their final game of the tournament on Sunday at the same venue and weather forecast for the game doesn't look promising either.
