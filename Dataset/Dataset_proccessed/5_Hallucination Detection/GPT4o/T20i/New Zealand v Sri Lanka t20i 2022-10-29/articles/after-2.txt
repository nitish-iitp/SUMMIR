And on that note, it's time for us take our leave. The points table should be updated shortly, and remember, tomorrow is a triple header with BanvZim, NedvPak and IndvSA all taking place. So be sure to join us for that. Until then, for myself, Shashank Kishore and Chandan Duorah, it's goodbye!

NZ skipper Kane Williamson: "[what did you think of the match?] Yeah it was interesting, the wicket was different to what we were expecting. It was tennis ball-ey, got stuck on the surface, the cutters were really effective, little bit variable I think - as opposed to the last pitch we were on. So I guess trying to make those sort of adjustments on the same sort of grounds is important, and Sri Lanka were also really good at the top. And then Glenn Phillips and Daryll Mitchell put together a partnership, and it was an incredible knock to get a very very good total on this surface. [On Phillips?] Any hundred is amazing and you see it all the time on good surfaces, and here you see a guy trying to have to work really, really hard to get his team out of trouble. And then to try and move that pressure on to the opposition, and he just did it incredibly well."

SL skipper Dasun Shanaka: "I think we started really well, particularly in the first 10 overs. But credit to Glenn Phillips who played an outstanding knock. We also dropped a few catches. 160 is always a tough ask with their bowling attack, but also Boult and Southee bowled really well up front. [losing so many wickets in the powerplay?] There's a way to chase big totals, and in the first couple of tables you have to give yourself a chance. We never got settled in the wicket. [approach the next two games] If we get a couple of wins, we're still in with a chance of qualifying, so just looking forward to that."

JOYDEEPSINGHGIL: "I'm sure if sl didn't drop Phillips catch nz score would've below 135 and sl would've chased that amount of runs could've rain biter match than completely one sided today wasn't sl day they misfielded missed run out chances too and dropped the crucial catch of Phillips which eventually costed them this match." 'Ifs' and 'ands' etc., but had SL approached that chase smarter it might not have mattered.

Rohit: "Will join hordes of others in hopes of getting this published - Phillips won by 2 runs." Ha! You're not wrong Rohit. Lucky you I guess.

Glenn Phillips is the Player of the Match for his 64-ball 104: "[discussions at 3 for 15] Me and Daryll were really clear we wanted to be as positive as possible, and try and make the right positive choice. On a pitch like that it was a little difficult to hit the slower ball, so it was just about getting through and trying to get to a competitive total. At the end of the day I think we were a little bit above par. [how much did you enjoy your innings] I try to entertain as much possible, and today it worked out well. But the way the bowlers bowl and the catches that were taken, it was incredible from the team as well. [what does it mean to score a century in a WC?] It's absolutely indescribable, but for it's just about sticking to my process."

10.25pm Well, that's that and what started as quite a harrowing test of New Zealand's credentials has ended in a romp. Following on from Glenn Phillips' masterful century to help put up a competitive 167, Tim Southee and Trent Boult broke the back of the Lankan chase to reduce Sri Lanka to 8 for 4 inside the powerplay. There was the faintest of hopeful glimmers when Dasun Shanaka and Bhanuka Rajapaksa were at the crease, but the ask by that point seemed always beyond them. In the end the chase just petered out, as NZ recorded their second straight comprehensive win of the tournament. They're well on their way to the semis, barring something calamitous, while Sri Lanka now need to win their remaining two games and hope other results go their way.

Asim: "Sri Lankan in the crowd look so happy. Wondering if the scoreboard is malfunctioning." There's an old Sri Lanka saying "nava gilunath ban choon" which roughly translates to, "even if the ship sinks, the band will play". Pretty much what you're witnessing here.
