New Delhi,UPDATED: Oct 29, 2022 15:32 IST

New Zealand's Glenn Phillips destroyed Sri Lanka's bowling attack as he smashed a century at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The 25-year-old took on the Sri Lankan bowlers after the Kiwis lost three early wickets in their Super-12 encounter.

Coming in at 7/2, Phillips started off slowly, alongside captain Kane Williamson. But once the captain departed thanks to a sensational delivery by Kasun Rajitha, Phillips took on the mantle for the Kiwis and started smashing the ball around.

Phillips took on the role of the aggressor as he was supported by Daryl Mitchell in the first half of the Kiwi innings. However, Mitchell couldn't hold on for long, losing his wicket after scoring 22 runs off 24 balls. Jimmy Neesham was the next to walk in for New Zealand but couldn't make much difference, departing without even hitting double figures.

Even though wickets kept falling around him, Phillips continued his onslaught on the Sri Lankan bowlers and went on to complete his century in just 61 balls. The 25-year-old smashed 10 boundaries and 4 sixes against the Sri Lankans as he pulled New Zealand back into the game. He was eventually dismissed by Lahiru Kumara, getting caught by Dasun Shanaka after slicing a short ball, only to chip it high towards long-off running in.

With this knock. Phillips became the first batter to score a century in World Cups while coming in to bat in the middle order. He joins former Kiwi skipper Brendon McCullum as the only two New Zealanders to hit a T20 World Cup hundred. McCullum hit a 58-ball 123 against Bangladesh in 2012.

Phillips' knock helped the Kiwis register 167/7 on the board after 20 overs against Sri Lanka in their Super-12 encounter at the SCG.
