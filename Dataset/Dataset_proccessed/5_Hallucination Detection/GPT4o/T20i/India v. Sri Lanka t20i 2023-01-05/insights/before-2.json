    "Others": [
        "Suryakumar Yadav would want to pick up where he left off in the previous year. While he was dismissed trying a fancy shot in the first game, Suryakumar rarely goes two games in a row without a big score. The dynamic Indian batter was sensational for India in 2022, amassing 1164 runs at an average of 47 while striking at a mind-boggling rate of 187. Suryakumar smashed two T20I hundreds and nine fifties in the year.",
        "Wanindu Hasaranga had a pretty good campaign in the recent LPL, where he picked 10 wickets at an economy of 6.41. He also smashed 77 not-out in just 34 balls in Qualifier 2. Hasaranga has a terrific record in T20I cricket with 86 wickets in 52 matches at 6.67 rpo, striking every 13 balls."
