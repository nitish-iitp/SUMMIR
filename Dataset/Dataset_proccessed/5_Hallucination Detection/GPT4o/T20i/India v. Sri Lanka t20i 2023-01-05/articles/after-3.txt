23-year-old Arshdeep Singh set an unwanted record on Thursday, January 5 as he bowled the most number of no-balls by an Indian bowler in a T20I series. The left-arm pacer came up with a shocking first over after returning to the team for the 2nd of a 3-match T20I series against Sri Lanka at the MCA Stadium in Pune.

Arshdeep Singh became the first Indian bowler to bowl as many as 3 no-balls on the trot as he began his spell in the 2nd T20I on a shocking note. Arshdeep gave away 19 runs in the 2nd over of the match as Sri Lanka gained momentum.

IND vs SL, 2nd T20I Live Updates

Arshdeep first over-stepped in the 5th delivery of his fist over of the match after captain Hardik Pandya won the toss and opted to field. Hardik then over-stepped two more times even as Kusal Mendis made full use of the free-hits, hitting a boundary and a six.

Arshdeep's shocking first over helped Sri Lanka push ahead after a tidy first over from captain Hardik. Sri Lanka scored 55 without losing a wicket in the powerplay.

With the hat-trick of no-balls, Arshdeep took his no-ball tally in the nascent stage of his T20I career to 12. Arshdeep also became the first Indian bowler to bowl 3 no-balls in an over in T20Is. Arshdeep has bowled more than one no-ball in a series on 4 occasions, which includes Asia Cup 2022.

Arshdeep Singh missed the first T20I of the New Year due to illness. The left-arm pacer recovered from the illness and replaced Harshal Patel, who leaked aplenty in the 2nd T20I.

India retained Shivam Mavi and Umran Malik while Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel continued to don the spinner's role in the team's first assignment in the New Year.
