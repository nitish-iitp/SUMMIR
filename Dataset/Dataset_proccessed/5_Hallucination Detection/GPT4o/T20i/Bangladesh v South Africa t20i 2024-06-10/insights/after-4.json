        "A win against Bangladesh in New York will put South Africa on top of Group D at the T20 World Cup 2024.",
        "South Africa go into their clash against Bangladesh knowing a win will all but seal their spot in the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup.",
        "The Proteas have had two contrasting encounters on the tricky pitch at New York\u2019s Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, but they will take the experience of playing two matches when they meet Bangladesh on Monday.",
        "Should Aiden Markram\u2019s side win, they will consolidate their top position in the so-called group of death which also includes Sri Lanka, the Netherlands and Nepal.",
        "Markram is wary of the threat Bangladesh pose, especially with their all-round bowling attack.",
        "The Proteas have played all their matches in New York so far and have a slight edge over Bangladesh, who last played at the venue in a June 1 warm-up match against India, and Markram said the greater knowledge of the conditions will help them plan better.",
        "Bangladesh enjoyed great support in their first match against Sri Lanka in Dallas, and Markram expects more of the same in New York but said his side will focus on the action inside the boundary ropes and not beyond.",
        "Bangladesh\u2019s coach Chandika Hathurusinghe said his team was \u201crelieved\u201d to have got over the line against Sri Lanka in their first match, but he expects them to perform better in their remaining three group games.",
        "Bangladesh\u2019s batting has been poor in recent games but middle-order batters Liton Das and Towhid Hridoy have hit form in the T20 World Cup.",
        "Hathurusinghe said the South African bowling attack can pose problems for his side but they are ready for \u201ca good fight\u201d.",
        "The much-talked about New York pitch seems relatively settled since its opening match between India and Ireland, although bowlers should still find plenty of assistance.",
        "The weather forecast is partly cloudy with a light breeze. Intermittent light showers could disrupt the game for a brief period.",
        "South Africa enjoy dominance over their South Asian opponents in the T20 formats, having won all of their eight encounters comfortably.",
        "Bangladesh squeezed past Sri Lanka in their opening game, but only just. Prior to the World Cup, they lost a T20 series against co-hosts USA and won a closely-fought T20 series at home against Zimbabwe.",
        "South Africa were able to overcome a strong Dutch challenge in their second game, largely thanks to David Miller\u2019s heroics with the bat.",
        "South Africa lost a T20 series against West Indies 3-0 shortly before the World Cup."
