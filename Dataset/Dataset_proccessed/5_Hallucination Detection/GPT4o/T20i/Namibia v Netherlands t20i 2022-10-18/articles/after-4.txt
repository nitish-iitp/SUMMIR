Netherlands beat Namibia by 5 wickets | Namibia Vs Netherlands Live Score, Match 5

Right then. That's it from the coverage of this game. More cricketing action coming your way as Sri Lanka take on the United Arab Emirates in the second match of the doubleheader. Do switch tabs to follow the action at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT). Cheers!

Scott Edwards, the captain of the Netherlands says that they don't wanna be known as the team that leaves it late but is stoked with the win. Adds that they did well to get the runs at the top and they knew Namibia had strong death bowlers but they managed to get over the line and is happy with the opportunity they have given themselves to make the next round.

The skipper of Namibia, Gerhard Erasmus says that they could not keep things tight in the field which made it easier for the opposition. He says that they lacked with the blade, and probably even Netherlands struggled with the same but they ran well.

Bas de Leede is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his match-winning effort with both bat and ball. He starts by jokingly saying that some of his teammates might be bitter about him snatching most of the wickets. He says the self belief has always been there and adds that it feels really good to clinch two close games and it does really well for their side.

The Presentation ceremony...

Earlier in the game, Gerhard Erasmus won the toss and elected to bat first which didn't turn out well as they lost as many as 3 wickets inside the Powerplay. It was then a steady knock played by Jan Frylinck that kept them in the game but they could only manage to put on 121 runs on the board. The Netherlands bowled extremely well as a group just like they did in the first game. In reply, Netherlands got off to a flier thanks to Vikramjit Singh and even after Namibia were able to pick up wickets towards the end and the game got close, Bas de Leede ensured that his side got over the line.

The Namibian new ball bowlers were not as effective as their counterparts. Just when Netherlands were running away with the game though, Namibia clawed their way back into the game with quick wickets. Namibia gave it their all but just didn’t have enough runs in the bank for their bowlers to defend and will now have to win their final game if they are to have a strong chance of making it through to the next round.

What an incredible finish to the game but it is Netherlands who hold their nerves and make it 2 wins out of 2 to go top of the group table. Max O'Dowd and Vikramjit Singh provided a great start for Netherlands in their pursuit of 122. The opening pair stitched a 59-run partnership. Despite a mini collapse towards the end, Bas de Leede steadied the ship and saw Netherlands home courtesy of his unbeaten knock.
