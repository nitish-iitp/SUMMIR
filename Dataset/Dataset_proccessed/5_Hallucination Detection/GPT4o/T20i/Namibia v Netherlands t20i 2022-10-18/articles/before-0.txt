Namibia vs Netherlands Head to Head in T20Is, ODIs, & Records

Team Netherlands and Namibia will face each other in match five of the first-round encounters of the 2022 T20 World Cup. The match will be played at the Simonds Stadium, Geelong on October 18 (Tuesday).

To note, this will be both teams’ second match in the tournament. While Namibia will take on Sri Lanka in its tournament opener, the Netherlands will face UAE in their first encounter on the same day.

Coming back to Namibia vs Netherlands, the former came on top during their last meeting in the 2021 T20 World Cup. Despite putting up a 160+ score on the board, the Dutch side could not defend the target as Namibia won that contest by six wickets with one over to spare.

Talking about both teams’ performance in the T20 World Cup, both teams have faced each other once. While Namibia managed to defeat the Netherlands once during the last concluded T20WC, the Dutch side holds the edge in overall T20I records after winning two games.

Namibia has also registered a T20I victory against the Dutch side after they defeated them in a match played in a quadrangular series in 2013.

The 2022 T20 World Cup is expected to kickstart soon and the fans can get all the information related to the tournament including, T20 World Cup points table, predictions, previews, and reviews by simply following Crictracker.
