By USA Cricket MediaMay 20, 2024

Houston, TX, May 21, 2024: The USA men’s national cricket team is prepared to compete against Bangladesh at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in a significant three-match T20 International (T20I) series. This will mark the inaugural encounter between the two teams in T20I cricket. The upcoming series will serve as valuable preparation for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, scheduled to be co-hosted by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and USA Cricket in June.

Series Schedule :

USA v Bangladesh – 1st T20I ( Tuesday, May 21, 2024)
USA v Bangladesh – 2nd T20I (Thursday, May 23, 2024)
USA v Bangladesh – 3rd T20I (Saturday, May 25, 2024)

Start Time: 10 AM CST

The USA Team enters the upcoming series with a strong sense of assurance, having secured a commanding 4-0 victory against Canada in the previous month. Captain Monank Patel played a pivotal role by scoring 120 runs in three innings, supported by notable performances from Steven Taylor, Andries Gous, Corey Anderson, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, and Nitish Kumar.

Harmeet Singh emerged as a game-changing all-rounder with outstanding bowling skills, clinching the Player of the Series title for his six wickets at an impressive average of 12.55 per dismissal, alongside contributing 48 runs during the series.

Conversely, Bangladesh will arrive in the USA following a successful 4-1 series triumph over Zimbabwe. Despite a recent eight-wicket loss in their final match, they displayed consistent all-around excellence throughout. However, due to injury, experienced fast bowler and vice-captain Taskin Ahmed will be absent from the squad, with Hasan Mahmud stepping in as his replacement. With seasoned players like Shakib Al Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman on their side, Bangladesh is anticipated to be the favored team at the start of the series.

Both teams boast a mix of seasoned players and exciting young talent, making this series a thrilling prelude to the World Cup. The USA will aim to leverage their home advantage and continue their winning momentum. Meanwhile, Bangladesh will look to fine-tune their strategies and build confidence ahead of the global event.

USA Squad: Monank Patel (captain), Aaron Jones (vice-captain), Andries Gous, Corey Anderson, Ali Khan, Harmeet Singh, Jessy Singh, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Nitish Kumar, Nosthush Kenjige, Saurabh Netravalkar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Steven Taylor, and Shayan Jahangir.

Bangladesh Squad: Najmul Hossain Shanto (Captain), Hasan Mahmud, Litton Das (WK), Soumya Sarkar, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Shakib Al Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah Riyad, Jaker Ali, Tanvir Islam, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, and Hasan Mahmud.
