Backs against the wall yet again, Braves tab Fried to save their season against Padres

But really, what can Fried do if the offense doesn’t deliver?

The Braves have been in a pseudo-do-or-die mode for a while now, but on Wednesday night, they will face their second elimination game in three contests. After last night’s 4-0 loss in San Diego, the Braves now need to win two in a row to advance... or they’ll be sent packing with another first round exit.

In the game previews, we generally talk about the starting pitchers. In that vein, the Braves have Max Fried starting tonight on regular rest. Though his season started in particularly gruesome fashion, Fried’s basically just been Fried for a while now — he finished the regular season with 3.4 fWAR in 29 starts (174 1⁄3 innings), which included a month-long-ish layoff for an injury. Since becoming a full-time starter in 2020, Fried’s xFIP has been 3.33... and his xFIP this season was... 3.33. So, yeah, he’s Max Fried, just with some frustrating ball-in-play, sequencing, and HR/FB stuff. (If you adjust for park and league, we’re talking 63/74/79 from 2020-2023, and 78/84/82 this year; the lines are ERA-/FIP-/xFIP-.)

Fried is coming off a game where he nearly Madduxed the Royals, finishing with a 9/2 K/BB ratio in 8 2⁄3 innings; Raisel Iglesias came on after a few baserunners got on in the ninth and threw a single pitch to end the game on a flyout. Amusingly, though Fried was excellent, neither his FIP (1.78) nor xFIP (2.83) are among his top four starts of the year — but it was one of his three best starts by Game Score (v2) given his longevity.

The Padres, though, are not quite the Royals offensively (nor the Cubs or Marlins, two other teams that Fried dominated this year). Fried didn’t face them in San Diego this season, but he did have a crappy outing against them in Atlanta: a horrid 2/3 K/BB ratio in 4 1⁄3 innings, in a game the Braves ended up losing 3-1. Fried actually repeatedly danced through the raindrops in that game until the fifth, when four straight Padres reached and then a fielder’s choice added on to score all three runs. One of those batters reached via walk, the other four were all grounders, and only one had a hit probability above 50 percent. Fried didn’t help himself with the walks and lack of punchouts in the game, but that’s the sort of thing that’s happened to him here and there... he and the Braves are hoping if not praying that it doesn’t happen to him again tonight.

The thing is, though, that Max Fried could be just as great as he was against the Royals (or the Marlins, or the Cubs), but the Braves are still going to have to score to avoid having their season end tonight. The zombified lineup they’re running out there has to perpetually deal with the fact that there are a bunch of blah bats in it, and all the ball-in-play shenanigans even when balls are struck well, and while they do generally score enough to make good on the excellent pitching they get nearly every day, there’s no more time for “generally” at this point. Either they overcome the zombies and/or the increased drag, or they don’t and that’s it for 2024.

Tonight, part of the thing they need to overcome is going to be Joe Musgrove, who missed a huge part of this season with elbow inflammation, but nonetheless posted 1.4 fWAR in 19 starts spanning 99 2⁄3 innings. Musgrove’s line is a pretty good 98/98/92, albeit with an elevated xERA that suggests that he too can give up and subsequently strand some hard-hit doubles or whatever.

Usually, when a guy goes on the shelf two separate times with elbow issues, you kind of expect him to be having a crappy year, but that’s not really the case with Musgrove. He was clearly horrible in April (only one non-awful start in seven tries), hit the shelf after a great outing to begin May, missed three weeks with elbow concerns, had a blah start, had a good start, and then missed pretty much the next three months. Since coming back, though, he’s been tough to handle: 54/65/79, with his only kinda-sorta-questionable start being the one where he came back and had a 1/1 K/BB ratio in 4 1⁄3 innings where his former team, the Pirates, didn’t scratch across a run. Other than that, he’s basically been dominant, save for one outing where he had a 7/1 K/BB ratio but got tagged for three homers by the Giants.

That is, suffice to say, a real problem for the Braves. Musgrove has a deep pitch mix and good command, and while the Braves would just love to sit on his fastball, there’s little chance he’s going to let them do so. They’re probably going to be best off seeing if they can figure out what sequences lead to fastballs and curves and trying to take advantage of the fact that he’s generally in the zone, and hope that Musgrove doesn’t catch on and start ramming cutters and sweepers down their gullets before they do some damage... but that strategy is also predicated on actually doing said damage from the jump. The alternative is just hoping that Fried and Musgrove can trade blows until someone blinks late, but given Fried’s occasional propensity for being killed by dumb stuff orthogonal to his pitching quality, that’s a dangerous game too.

Musgrove hasn’t faced the Braves since 2022, when the Padres beat Atlanta in both of his starts — one was dominant, and one was less so but featured a late Padres rally.

Anyway, it’s win or go home time again, quite literally.
