        "Atlanta Braves ace Chris Sale, the favorite for the National League Cy Young Award, is out for the Wild Card Series against the San Diego Padres because of back issues.",
        "Manager Brian Snitker said the Braves will be without their top starting pitcher when they face the Padres in a best-of-three series that begins Tuesday.",
        "Journeyman Grant Holmes stepped in for Sale against the Mets, throwing one-hit ball over four innings as the Braves won 3-0 to clinch a wild-card berth.",
        "Snitker said Sale (18-3, 2.38 ERA) has dealt with back issues periodically all season, though the issue became more problematic after his most recent start, a five-inning stint against Cincinnati on Sept. 19 that was notable for a drop in velocity.",
        "Sale was scheduled to start last Wednesday against the Mets, but the game was rained out. He kept getting pushed back, with Snitker insisting that he was simply trying to save the left-hander for an elimination game.",
        "General manager Alex Anthopoulos insisted the latest round of back spasms only cropped up after a throwing session on Sunday.",
        "Anthopoulos said it was decided before the start of the doubleheader that Sale would not be able to go. Holmes said he got the word he was starting the second game about a half-hour before taking the mound.",
        "Snitker made the injury sound more serious after the doubleheader, conceding that Sale will not be available until the second round at the earliest.",
        "Now, the team is left pondering its options, which include bringing up a pitcher from the Triple-A roster to take Sale's spot against the Padres.",
        "Top prospects Hurston Waldrep and AJ Smith-Shawver have continued throwing since the end of the minor league season. So has Ian Anderson, who has struggled with injuries since going 4-0 with a 1.26 ERA over eight starts in the 2020 and '21 postseasons."
