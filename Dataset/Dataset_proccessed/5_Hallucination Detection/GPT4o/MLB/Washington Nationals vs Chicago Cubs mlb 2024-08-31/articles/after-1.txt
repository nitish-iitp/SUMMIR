BN  Chicago Cubs  Enhanced Box Score: Cubs 5,....
Enhanced Box Score: Cubs 5, Nationals 3 – August 31, 2024

CHICAGO CUBS

Even as old friend DJ Herz was spinning a no-hitter through four innings tonight, I have to admit that I didn’t feel particularly fatalistic about the Cubs. They’ve been playing well enough of late, scoring enough runs, that I just thought they very well might come back and win this one. Not dramatic, super-huge-comeback-style, but just a feeling that two runs was not an especially large deficit. (You know how it feels when the opposite fear lives inside of you, that two runs is obviously completely insurmountable for the Cubs. This just wasn’t that.)

Isaac Paredes broke up the no-hitter to open up the 5th, and the Cubs started scoring from there. They got three before Herz departed (once again, the best 8-9 hitters in baseball!), and ultimately scored another that was charged to Herz.

Javier Assad posted a Quality Start, and you’ve just got to happily take that every time. Really good to see Tyson Miller bounce right back tonight, and also really good to see Jorge Lopez (groin) healthy back out on the mound. The Cubs are going to need him if they’re going to make this run.

Good night for Nico Hoerner, who had a couple hits and scored a couple runs, and he SHOULD HAVE had a walk instead of a strikeout on his line (blown 3-2 call). We’ll give him the Ankin Law “Making it Personal” Player of the Game honors just to make up for it.

Another win. Keep on Flying that W.

Full box score.
