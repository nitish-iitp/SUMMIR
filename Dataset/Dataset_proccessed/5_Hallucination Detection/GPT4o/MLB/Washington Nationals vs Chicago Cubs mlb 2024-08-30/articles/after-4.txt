Cubs stay hot, keep pace in wild-card race as short bullpen pushes through

WASHINGTON — The Chicago Cubs are enjoying one of their hottest stretches of the season. They’ve won four straight, 10 of 13 and after being seven games under .500 less than a month ago, they’re now 69-66. But during the past two weeks, they’ve lost a half-game in the wild-card standings — they’re five games back — due to the Atlanta Braves also rarely losing.

Still, manager Craig Counsell is known for his September runs — and he’s just one day away from his month. Friday night’s 7-6 win over the Washington Nationals wasn’t the prettiest of victories, but the Cubs don’t need oil paintings, just wins.

Cubs ace Shota Imanaga was a little rusty at first, giving up two runs in the first. Imanaga shared after the game that the mound made it difficult to use his lower half and he didn’t get a feel for it until the fourth. But a seven-run second by the Cubs allowed him to go on the attack and get through six innings, giving up just three runs on four hits while striking out eight and walking just one.

“After that, based on how I felt, my job there was go out there for six innings and three or less earned runs,” Imanaga said through interpreter Edwin Stanberry. “That’s what happened.”

The Cubs started the second inning with four straight hits, including a two-RBI double by Pete Crow-Armstrong that put the team up a run. Cody Bellinger capped off the frame with a two-run shot, giving the Cubs all the runs they’d score on the night. They’d need each one of them.

But the offense stalled after that. As good as it’s been of late and as important as Imanaga has been this season, it was a short bullpen that pushed through Friday night.

Nate Pearson relieved Imanaga in the seventh and faced the minimum — giving up one hit and striking out two — in two scoreless frames. Pearson needed just 17 pitches to get through two and touched triple digits three times.

“I think Nate’s been really great on the attack,” Counsell said. “Just go after hitters with your stuff. Power slider, good fastball, just go after hitters. He’s pitched really well. You throw the seventh and eighth in a winning game, big two innings for sure. He did great and set us up.”

Pearson went first-pitch strike against five of the six batters he faced. Since joining the Cubs, Pearson has a 2.34 ERA in 15 1/3 innings with a 26.8 percent strikeout rate while walking just 3.6 percent. He’s given up three home runs, something that bit him while in Toronto, but his 0.72 WHIP has helped him limit the damage.

Ultimately, he looks like a key piece of the future if the Cubs can continue to work with him in the offseason. But the focus remains 2024 for those in the clubhouse.

The ninth wasn’t nearly as easy. Tyson Miller had to face four batters from the left side — the Nationals used their bench wisely against him — and allowed three of them to reach. Drew Smyly entered, walked CJ Abrams, struck out Keibert Ruiz and then allowed a two-RBI single to Jacob Young.

In came Keegan Thompson to face the recently called-up Dylan Crews with the tying and winning runs on base and two outs. Crews is one of the top prospects in baseball and was the No. 2 pick in last summer’s draft. He made his debut earlier in the week and homered Wednesday then again earlier in the night against Imanaga.

“Obviously, he’s a good player,” Thompson said. “Hit a couple homers the last few days. But nothing really changes. Still have to go after him in the strike zone, be aggressive and try to make pitches.”

Thompson needed five pitches to retire Crews, getting him to swing through a curveball to end the game.

“Big moment,” Counsell said. “Keegan’s been so good against right-handed hitters this year. The strikeouts stand out. He’s been awesome against them. He threw a curveball tonight and it was a nasty curveball. Credit to Keegan for coming in a tough spot and making some tough pitches.”

Thompson has now faced 50 righties this season and has struck out 38 percent of them. Righties have just four hits against him, all singles. He’s been up and down this season and dealt with injuries, but was huge Friday night.

Thompson was needed because Porter Hodge was down after throwing 36 pitches Wednesday, the second time he worked in two days. Even with Thursday’s off day, Counsell wasn’t going to push it with the young reliever who has become so important to the team.

Jorge López, who has been dominant since joining the team, hasn’t pitched since last Friday in Miami. López injured his groin Monday in warmups but threw a bullpen earlier Friday and is expected to be available this weekend. Counsell wasn’t going to use him Friday night, though.

The Cubs may use Jordan Wicks as a starter this weekend, but Javier Assad will pitch Saturday evening. Perhaps Wicks will join the team Sunday when rosters expand to 28. If he does make a start, Imanaga may go on normal rest Wednesday at Wrigley against the Pirates. If that happens, Kyle Hendricks’ next start could be skipped.

The Cubs also got some bullpen reinforcements when they picked up Shawn Armstrong, who was designated for assignment by the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cubs released Tomás Nido to make room for Armstrong on the 40-man and will need to make another roster move if they activate him Saturday, as expected.

“Just somebody with some experience,” Counsell said. “Losing Julian (Merryweather) and unsure on López’s status going into today. Somebody we think is capable of filling the Merryweather gap essentially for a little while. Happy to have him, a guy that’s put up some good big-league innings.”

Armstrong struggled with the Tampa Bay Rays this season but was solid with the Cardinals after being traded there at the deadline. In 12 2/3 innings with St. Louis, Armstrong had a 2.84 ERA with a 24.5 percent strikeout rate and a 4.1 percent walk rate. He had a 1.38 ERA in 52 innings with the Rays in 2023.

After Héctor Neris was released and Smyly was placed on waivers and went unclaimed, remaining with the team, some have questioned the Cubs’ desire to compete. But that’s not how Counsell views it.

“We’ve never stopped competing,” Counsell said. “The guys in there have done a great job, and that’s not gonna stop until the season’s over.”

When the season ends is the question. The team is playing as well as it has all season. Is it too little, too late? Is Atlanta too hot to catch? Perhaps. But Counsell’s Cubs aren’t quitting just yet.
