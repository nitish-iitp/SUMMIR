WASHINGTON — It’s a good thing the Cubs scored seven runs in the second inning Friday against the Nationals.

With a four-run lead going to the ninth, the Cubs turned to right-hander Tyson Miller to shut the door. Miller has been effective in late-inning situations, but he didn’t have it on this night, allowing a run and leaving two other runners on base in a third of an inning.

With runners on first and third with one out, manager Craig Counsell turned to veteran left-hander Drew Smyly, who walked a batter to load the bases. He then struck out Keibert Ruiz for the second out before allowing a two-run single to Jacob Young. Just like that, the Cubs were clinging to a one-run lead.
