The Mets and Phillies are back for Game 2 of the NLDS after a thrilling Game 1.

The Amazin’s used another late rally — with five runs in the eighth inning — to take Game 1, 6-2.

Luis Severino is slated to get the start for the Mets against Phillies lefty Cristopher Sánchez in Game 2, which starts at 4:08 p.m. ET at Citizens Bank Park.

The Mets right-hander won Game 1 of the NL Wild Card Series, allowing four runs over six innings against the Brewers.

Will the Phillies bounce back to even the series, or will the Mets take a 2-0 heading back to Citi Field?

Mark Vientos is the Mets’ main man right now
By Jon Heyman

PHILADELPHIA — Francisco Lindor and Pete Alonso are the biggest names, and biggest stars, on the team from Queens. They are 1 and 1A on your list of orange-and-blue luminaries.

But the kid Mark Vientos is the main man now. Of that there is no denying, and no doubt.

The kid who always thought and said he could rake is doing it up big on the biggest stage. And if he had just a little more help, the Mets would be heading home in a commanding position instead of tied at one game apiece after Philly’s rousing 7-6 walk-off victory Sunday.

Vientos hit a pair of book-end two-run homers, including one to tie things in the ninth. He also doubled and walked in his five plate appearances that carried the potential to be labeled an all-time great Mets performance if only the Mets had hung on. Vientos provided the best of the Mets’ daily late-game heroics, but this time the Phillies beat the Mets at their own game, staging three late-game rallies to even the Division Series.

Phillies answer Mets’ ninth-inning magic with Nick Castellanos walk-off to tie NLDS
By Mike Puma

PHILADELPHIA — Another almost improbable Mets victory turned into a gut punch Sunday night.

One miracle short, the Mets couldn’t survive the bottom of the ninth after Mark Vientos’ second homer of the game a half-inning earlier had his team harboring dreams of heading to Queens within a victory of reaching the NLCS.

But Tylor Megill surrendered a walk-off RBI single to Nick Castellanos in the bottom of the inning, sending the Mets to a 7-6 loss to the Phillies in Game 2 of the NLDS at Citizens Bank Park.
