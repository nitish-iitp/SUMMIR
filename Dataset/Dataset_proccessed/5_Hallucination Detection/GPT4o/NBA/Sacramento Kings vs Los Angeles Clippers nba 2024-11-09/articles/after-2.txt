Kevin Porter Jr. scored nine points in the fourth and Los Angeles withstood a late push by the Kings, who cut the deficit to four with under three minutes left.

Takeaways

Clippers: Los Angeles, looking to hold down the fort until star Kawhi Leonard returns from right knee inflammation, is above .500 for the first time this season after a 2-4 start. Powell and Harden are both averaging more than 20 points per game.

Kings: Sacramento was 3 of 26 from 3-point range and made just one 3 in the second half. The Kings are in the bottom five in the NBA in 3-point shooting, entering the game at a 32.5% clip.

The Kings cut a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit to four with under three minutes to play, but Powell and Amir Coffey hit consecutive 3-pointers to push the lead back to double digits.

Key stat

Powell has blossomed early this season, scoring 20 points or more for the eighth straight game and finally notching a double-double in his 10th season. He has taken advantage of more playing time with Leonard injured and Russell Westbrook and Paul George no longer on the team.
