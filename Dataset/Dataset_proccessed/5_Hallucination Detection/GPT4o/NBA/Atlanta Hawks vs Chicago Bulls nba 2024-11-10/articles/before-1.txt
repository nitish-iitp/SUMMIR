Zach LaVine returned to the Chicago Bulls lineup on Saturday night after a three-game absence due to an injury. LaVine remains a vital part of the Bulls despite being linked to trade rumors over the past two seasons. How did he perform tonight against the Atlanta Hawks?

LaVine finished the game with 18 points, two rebounds and seven assists. He had a strong first half, but only scored four points in the second. Nevertheless, he was pivotal in the Bulls' come-from-behind 125-113 win over the Hawks at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

Seven other Bulls players reached double figures, including Ayo Dosunmu, who had a team-high 19 points off the bench. Nikola Vucevic and Coby White also scored 18 points each, while Josh Giddey had 13 points, six rebounds and seven assists.

How did Zach LaVine perform against the Hawks?

Zach LaVine had a solid first quarter with seven points, but the Atlanta Hawks took control of the game late in the period. It was a back-and-forth contest to start the contest before Atlanta went on a 16-6 run to end the period. They led by as much as 15 points before taking a 37-24 advantage after the first quarter.

In the second quarter, LaVine helped keep the Chicago Bulls afloat by scoring eight more points. The Bulls managed to get the lead down to just eight points, but the Hawks were just scoring too much, with 70 points after two periods.

It was the same story in the third quarter as the teams traded shots, but the Hawks were in control. Zach LaVine went scoreless in the period, but it was Nikola Vucevic and the bench that kept the Bulls in the game.

Atlanta looked fatigued to start the final period, so the Bulls pounced early in the period to get the lead back with around eight minutes remaining in the game. LaVine scored four crucial points at the four-minute mark to help stave off a Hawks rally as Chicago earned a 125-113 victory.

What's next for Zach LaVine and the Chicago Bulls?

With their win on Saturday, the Chicago Bulls snapped a three-game skid to improve to 4-6 for the season. The Bulls are back home for their next game on Monday, but it's a tough matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The Cavs are the only perfect team in the NBA this season with a record of 11-0. Chicago has the momentum to possibly make things interesting versus Cleveland.

Following that game, the Bulls will play three of their next four games on the road in New York, Cleveland and Detroit. The only home game during the stretch is against the Houston Rockets on Nov. 17.
