LeBron James became the first person in NBA history to play as a teenager and past the age of 40 as the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

James, who made his NBA debut as an 18-year-old in 2003, turned 40 on 30 December.

He scored 23 points in the 122-110 defeat at the Crypto.com Arena in LA, but 27 from Jarrett Allen helped Cleveland to an eighth straight win.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, James last year became the NBA's all-time leading points scorer.
