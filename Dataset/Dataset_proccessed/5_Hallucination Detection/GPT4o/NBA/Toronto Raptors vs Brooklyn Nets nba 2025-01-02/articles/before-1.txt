TORONTO (AP) — Scottie Barnes had 33 points and 13 rebounds and the Toronto Raptors snapped an 11-game losing streak by beating the Brooklyn Nets 130-113 on Wednesday night.

Immanuel Quickley returned to the lineup for Toronto and contributed 21 points and a season-high 15 assists. He played for just the fourth time this season, returning after missing 22 games because of a torn ligament in his left elbow.

Gradey Dick scored 22 points and Ochai Agbaji added 14 as Toronto won for the first time since a home win over Indiana on Dec. 3.

The Raptors were coming off a franchise-worst 54-point loss at Boston on New Year’s Eve. Toronto scored 71 points against the Celtics, the fewest by any NBA team this season.
