Not all of them are pretty, but nearly one week removed from losing by 36 to the Utah Jazz, the Miami Heat enacted vengeance and squeaked past Utah, 97-92, Thursday night inside Delta Center.

The Heat just lost 39.6 percent and 28.0 percent from 3-point range, but Tyler Herro led the way with 23 points, seven rebounds and five assists on 7-of-17 shooting, including 4-of-10 from 3-point range. He was followed by sophomore forward Jaime Jaquez Jr., who tallied a season-high 20 points, including a critical above-the-break 3-pointer to put the Heat ahead by five points with 1:03 left.

Utah shot 39.8 percent, including 11-of-36 (30.6 percent) from 3-point range on the night. Lauri Markkanen and Collin Sexton had 23 points apiece, though the former had a game-high six made 3-pointers on 15 attempts.

Both teams combined for just 87 points on 34.5 percent shooting in the first half.

Jaquez’s triple in the fourth quarter tied a season-high for made 3s in a single game–doing so last on Dec. 26 against the Orlando Magic. Up to this point, he had not made multiple 3-pointers in a single game. Though he’s continued to produce in Jimmy Butler’s absence, scoring at least 13 points in his fourth straight game and 16 in his last three.

Miami’s win Thursday moves them to 19-17, while the tanking Jazz drop to 9-27. The Heat will have a prime opportunity to extend their winning streak to three games Saturday against the Portland Trail Blazers, the fourth of their six-game road trip.

Just throwing this out there. What if the Heat trade Jimmy straight up for Dame?
I bet the Bucks would do it

Latest news. It seems Butler took a not too subtle shot at Riley in his coffee shop. What an idiot.

Jimmy Butler to employee of his coffee shop: That’s what bosses do. We build you up, we don’t break you down

Let’s see if Jimmy says the same thing after that employee misses the equivalent of weeks of work.

Or when the employee says I’m totally unhappy here and I may go to work for the competition down the street unless you give me a big raise.

This video sums up Jimmy Butler’s motivation. It’s not about Riley not putting a better team around him. It’s not about getting joy back from basketball. It’s about money!

I realized that when he said he didn’t want to play for certain teams that he would have had a really good chance to go deep into the playoffs with. He only wants to play for the team that gives him the max and that’s a team trading with gets very complicated because we don’t want Beal. It changed my opinion on the situation and only made me want to trade him or let him walk. I am surprised he is so money oriented when he is so wealthy already.
And, I am heartened by our recent play. I am surprised we can beat some of the lesser teams without Jimmy and it says a lot. If we get someone to replace Jimmy, which we will, and Ware develops more, we could still be a decent team going forward.
JJJ making threes makes his effectiveness much higher. And Nico being able to power forward inside is where he becomes more effective. Both have made promising progress recently, maybe partly because Jimmy isn’t here.
As they become viable players, we can do more things, including possibly trading someone to strengthen other areas. Hopefully, Jimmy’s eventual loss will result in us getting another big, which is our biggest need right now, but we need another point guard too.
All in all, there is more optimism around here after an emotional time.

Exactly right 30. Jaquez and Jovic no longer have to live in Butler’s shadow. They can now flourish and be all they can be. I would love to see the Heat get a good replacement for Butler, another center (like Vuc) and a PG. I still think Jaquez would make a good starting guard next to Herro. Then if the team can get someone like Ingram for Butler, all it will need will be another big as Ware continues developing. He is definitely going to be a rebounder and inside presence next to Bam soon.

Recall that not even us fans really knew Bam’s full potential until we shipped Hassan out of town. It makes a lot of sense that our young guys will start to spread their wings once they’re forced to step up in Jimmy’s absence.

That’s better than the alternative. This team could have fallen apart after Butler’s suspension and that devastating Sacramento loss. It didn’t. Heat culture lives! These guys are quitters like some folks. The core is young and the trajectory is upward. They are only going to get better.

Glad to see the team rebound from that 35 point blowout the last time they played Utah. To be fair to the Jazz, four players who scored a total of 71 points last game were out (Sensabaugh, Collins, George and Clarkson). Nonetheless, this was a game the Heat was supposed to win and did.

The team is still making avoidable mistakes, especially careless turnovers. Those need to be cut down or it will cost them against the better teams. Interestingly, Jaquez made 3 of 5 3-point shots (60%) while the rest of the team made just 6 of 30 (20%). Overall, the team shot 25.7% from 3 point range while Utah shot 41.3%. Several of Miami’s misses were wide open uncontested shots.

Jaquez probably would have had 12-15 assists (instead of 7) if his teammates were hitting their 3’s. Jaquez has several skills normally found in a point guard, rather than a small forward. If the team could trade for someone like Kuzma or Ingram, Jaquez (6’6″) could start at guard alongside Herro (6’5″), either Ingram (6’8″) or Kuzma (6’9″) at SF, Bam (6’9″) at PF and Ware (7’0″) at center. That dog could hunt!

If Washington would take Butler for Kuzma and Brogdon in trade, Jimmy would likely want to opt out after the season and become an unrestricted free agent. He could then entertain offers and sign with the highest bidder -or- push for a sign & trade with a team such as Phoenix. Washington could then be out from under Kuzma and Butler’s contracts and have considerable cap space to fast track their rebuild with young players they can pick up in the draft, or obtain via free agency and trades. If Jimmy does not decide to opt out, Washington would be free to trade him as a one year rental to the highest bidder.

Sounds like a plan to me.

I dont like Kuzma, but Ingram can fit in. I just wonder, if he is a Miami heat type of player.

Maybe it’s my imagination, but it seems like Jovic and JJJ play their best basketball when Jimmy is out.

I think it was true last season and I know it’s true this season

Ugh. I really hope Jimmy doesn’t come back.

I wish him the best with his next team. I hope he finds so much joy he’s whistling ‘zippy-de-doo-da’ out his asshole.

But I have enjoyed the past couple games more than any other games all season. Let’s add someone like Brandon Ingram and move on with our lives.

No mas Jimmy. That greedy troublemaker has burned his bridges in Miami. If he comes back, sit his ass at the end of the bench and wait for him to get out of line so he can be suspended again…and again. Wanna play hardball Jimmy? Pat knows hardball.

Jimmy quit on the team. He’s gone. Don’t you get it? Time to move on once he pulls his head out of his ass and quits insisting to be traded to Phoenix for Beal. FTS!

Apparently not if his agent told the Grizzlies and Nuggets not to trade for him. That would’ve given him one of the best chances to get a ring this season.

That’s all a smokescreen heat. His ego was damaged when Pat said that anyone who isn’t in the game should keep his mouth shut then gave Ban an extension this summer and not him. He never got over that.

Once Durant started coaxing him to push for a trade to Phoenix, it all came together. The “Disgruntled/Disruptive Jimmy” reared his ugly head after being dormant for a few years. Just as he had done in Chicago, Minnesota and Philly, he made a fuss in order to get traded where he wanted to go. Unfortunately for him, Riley don’t play dat shit.

Now Jimmy’s stuck in “no man’s land” with his thumb all the way up his @$$ and is running out of options. Riley is not going to take Beal and his ridiculous three year $160M contract for Butler. Unless the Suns can find a third party willing to take Beal, no way Jimmy goes to Phoenix.

The only other possible way Jimmy goes to Phoenix is if the Suns are willing to trade Booker for Butler. Devin is also getting very frustrated with all the losing and the Beal drama going on in Phoenix. That trade would work and still may happen.

I’m talking about his personal life, not his game. Life is more than just basketball. There’s stuff like hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts and elections going on in the world too.

I think he’s from Pacific Palisades, and is currenlty in California helping with relief from the fires.

Two reasons I want him back in the lineup:

(1) passing is contagious, and when he’s in there the entire team passes the ball better.

(2) If we get him in there with Jovic, JJJ, Duncan, and Tyler, we’ll have a full whitewash. And unless someone can correct me, I believe it will be the first whitewash in Heat history
