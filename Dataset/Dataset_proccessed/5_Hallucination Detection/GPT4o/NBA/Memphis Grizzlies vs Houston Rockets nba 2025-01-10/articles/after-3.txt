Concerned about Desmond Bane’s ankle injury? We’ve got all the updates you need! After missing one game, the Grizzlies star made his return Thursday, contributing 16 points in Memphis’ narrow 119-115 loss to the Houston Rockets.

Let’s break down Desmond Bane’s injury, recovery, performance, and what his return means for the Grizzlies’ season push!

The Memphis Grizzlies guard scored 16 points on efficient shooting (6-of-10 from the field, 2-of-5 from three), adding four rebounds, four assists, and two steals in 27 minutes during a close 119-115 loss to the Houston Rockets. He finished as the team’s third-leading scorer behind Ja Morant (27 points) and Jaren Jackson Jr. (21 points).

Desmond Bane’s injury occurred in early January, causing him to sit out Memphis’ January 6 matchup against the Dallas Mavericks. Before the setback, he had been in strong form, posting at least 22 points in four straight games. The Grizzlies upgraded Bane to active just hours before tip-off after initially listing him as questionable for the Houston game.

His return couldn’t have come at a better time for Memphis, currently third in the Western Conference with a 24-14 record. Over his last 10 games, Bane has averaged 20.9 points, 6.5 assists, 5.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals in 30.1 minutes per game. His well-rounded play has been key, especially with Marcus Smart still out and Ja Morant recently returning from a shoulder injury.

Though the Grizzlies fell to Houston, Bane’s presence is a major boost as they push for the playoffs and improve their standings. His consistency on both ends is vital for a team fighting for a top spot in the West. With Memphis in a tight race, Bane’s scoring, playmaking, and defensive impact will be crucial moving forward.
