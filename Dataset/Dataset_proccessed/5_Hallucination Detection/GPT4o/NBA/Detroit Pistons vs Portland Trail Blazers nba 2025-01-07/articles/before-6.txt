NEW YORK — Cole Anthony scored 24 points, Wendell Carter Jr. had a season-high 19 off the bench and Orlando shut down a New York team missing Karl-Anthony Towns for a victory.

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 15 points for the Magic, who are missing their top four scorers because of injuries but didn’t need too much offence the way they defended. They limited the Knicks to 4-for-22 shooting from 3-point range and didn’t allow a make in the second half until Cam Payne’s basket with 8.2 seconds remaining.

Jalen Brunson and Mikal Bridges each scored 24 points for the Knicks, who were held to their lowest point total of the season in their season-high third straight loss. Towns, averaging 25.3 points and an NBA-leading 14 rebounds, sat with right knee pain.
