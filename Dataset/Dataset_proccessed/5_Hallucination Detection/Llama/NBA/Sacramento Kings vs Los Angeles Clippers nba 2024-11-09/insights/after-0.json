        "Sabonis is off to a solid start to the season averaging 20.3 PPG, but has had two 28+ point games vs. LAL & UTA (both who are in the bottom-4 in defensive rating) to inflate his average.",
        "Zooming out, he’s only achieved this prop in 37.5% of his games this season.",
        "His next matchup will be vs. Ivicia Zubac and the Clippers, a team he’s historically not fared well vs.",
        "Last season, without DeRozan, he averaged 16.3 PPG, and went under in 3 of the 4 meetings.",
        "The one game he went over was when scored he 22 PTS, where 9 came off 2nd Chance and 6 came from the line.",
        "In that same game, he saw Daniel Theis for 29.6% of his possessions, but because Zu is a staple in the offense now, backup Cs are seeing less minutes while his 📈 from 26.4 to 34.5 MPG.",
        "Playing Zu more has also fixed up LAC’s struggles in limiting 2nd chance points to the LOWEST rate compared to the 8th highest right last season.",
        "Zu has also helped anchor the defense to be bottom-8 in limiting PTS to the Roll Man and Free Throws (33% of Sabonis PPG).",
        "Recent C vs. the Clippers include Ayton, Nurkic, Chet, & Drummond all going under 18 points with Wemby the only one to go over (he’s more mobile than most).",
        "All that to say, it’ll be tough all game for Sabonis to pile up points."
