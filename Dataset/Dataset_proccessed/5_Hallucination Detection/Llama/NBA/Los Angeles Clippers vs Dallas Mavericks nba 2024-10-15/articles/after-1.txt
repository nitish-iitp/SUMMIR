The Western Conference playoff picture could look slightly different in 2024-25 than it did during the Mavericks’ run to last season’s NBA Finals.

Klay Thompson’s addition is expected to keep the Mavericks in contention to make another deep postseason run. The Oklahoma City Thunder should remain a dominant fixture in the West with another year of continuity, plus the offseason additions of Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein. The Minnesota Timberwolves will look different after they traded Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks, but they’re still expected to compete behind Anthony Edwards and Dallas native Julius Randle.

Not to mention Nikola Jokic’s Denver Nuggets and Ja Morant’s Memphis Grizzlies. So where does that leave the LA Clippers?

The Clippers finished with the fourth seed last season and secured the third Pacific division title in franchise history. However, LA was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the fifth-seeded Mavericks, which marked the end of Paul George’s time in his hometown of Los Angeles. George left the Clippers to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers in free agency. As a result, the expectations for the Clippers have significantly decreased, even as the team embarks on a new era inside a brand-new arena.

James Harden, who signed a two-year, $70 million contract extension in the summer, will shoulder the burden of the offensive load for the Clippers. Kawhi Leonard won’t play in the preseason as he continues to recover from offseason knee surgery.

When healthy, the Clippers should be competitive, but Leonard’s recent injury woes place a precarious outlook on the Clippers’ chances to contend for an extended playoff run.

They return Ivica Zubac and Terance Mann, two key members of their rotation, but they’ve also added Kevin Porter Jr. and Kai Jones — two athletic wings that could provide an immediate impact on defense and in transition offense.

Dallas got an early look at this year’s version of the Clippers, along with a sneak peek of Intuit Dome, during Monday’s preseason game. LA came away with a 110-96 win over the Mavericks, who were without Luka Doncic (left calf contusion) and Kyrie Irving (rest).

P.J. Washington returned to the lineup after missing the last two exhibition games due to left hip tightness and finished with 10 points, three rebounds and three steals. Klay Thompson struggled on the offensive end and went scoreless, missing all nine of his shot attempts, including six 3-pointers. Quentin Grimes had his best game of the preseason with a team-high 20 points.

The Mavericks remain winless in preseason play, but they’ve been ravaged with injuries. They’ll host Milwaukee at American Airlines Center for the preseason finale Thursday.

Veteran forward Derrick Jones Jr. played against his former team for the first time since joining the Clippers in free agency. He appeared in 76 games and averaged a career-high 8.6 points last season with Dallas. He helped his new team Monday with 12 points and four rebounds.

Mavericks coach Jason Kidd was asked after Saturday’s practice about facing Jones for the first time since his decision to leave Dallas, but instead emphasized his own team as the main priority. Kidd reflected on Jones’ brief stint with the Mavericks again on Monday.

“He was all about work, so just being consistent,” Kidd said during his pregame news conference. “For Derrick, I thought he was consistent for us both on and off the floor. If he didn’t play, he didn’t complain. He came to work the next day. He’s a pro. The Clippers are very lucky to have him.”

After being the final team to play against the Clippers while they still called Crypto.com Arena their home, the Mavericks were also able to be a part of history as the first opponent to ever play against LA in their new arena.

“We were here [Sunday] and being able to have shootaround here, they’ve done an incredible job,” Kidd said. “I think Clippers fans should be happy. When you look at the fan experience, it’s gonna be like no other. It’ll be exciting to be the first visiting team here tonight, to experience that.”
