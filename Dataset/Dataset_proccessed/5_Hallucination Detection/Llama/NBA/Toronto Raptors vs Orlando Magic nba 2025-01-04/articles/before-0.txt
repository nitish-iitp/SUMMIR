Orlando Magic guard Jalen Suggs left Friday's 106-97 victory over the Toronto Raptors in a wheelchair after suffering a back injury.

Suggs attempted a steal and landed awkwardly on the court. He was eventually ruled out for the remainder of the contest due to back spasms.

The 23-year-old was in a lot of pain and will be re-evaluated Saturday, Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said postgame, according to The Athletic's Eric Koreen.

Suggs recorded six points on 2-for-7 shooting in 13 minutes before exiting the game.

Rookie forward Tristan da Silva stepped up in Suggs' absence, leading the team in scoring with 25 points. Goga Bitadze almost recorded a triple-double, contributing 11 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists.

The Magic have been bit by the injury bug - Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner have missed significant time with oblique injuries. Moe Wagner is out for the season due to a torn ACL, and the team is also missing Anthony Black and Gary Harris due to respective back and hamstring injuries.

Suggs is averaging a career-high 16.8 points, along with 4.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.5 steals, and a block this campaign.

The former fifth overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft made the All-Defensive second team last season.
