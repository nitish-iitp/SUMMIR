Reed Sheppard and the Houston Rockets host the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. It's an interesting matchup as the Warriors are without Steph Curry. With that in mind, there's a slight chance that Rockets rookie Sheppard could see some minutes against Golden State.

Interestingly, the Rockets didn't put Sheppard on the floor in the first quarter. His opportunities to play on the hardwood have been very few so far. Last game, the Rockets rookie only played five minutes against the Dallas Mavericks. It's slightly surprising given how Sheppard had significant playing time in his first two NBA games.

By the end of the opening period, the Golden State Warriors secured a huge 38-20 lead despite not having their star player.
