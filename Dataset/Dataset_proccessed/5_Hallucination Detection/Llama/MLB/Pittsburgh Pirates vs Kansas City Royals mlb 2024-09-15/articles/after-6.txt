MLB’s annual Roberto Clemente Day always special in Pittsburgh

The 23rd annual Roberto Clemente Day was being celebrated throughout Major League Baseball on Sunday, but the love, respect and appreciation for the Hall of Fame outfielder’s life and career is more grand in Pittsburgh than anywhere else.

Prior to the Pirates’ series finale against the Kansas City Royals at PNC Park, the sons of “The Great One” -- Roberto Jr., Luis and Ricky -- threw out ceremonial first pitches in unison. Then Roberto Jr.’s young sons -- Roberto Clemente III and Leo Roberto -- signified the start of play by shouting “Play Ball” into an on-field microphone. Plus, all fans in attendance received a collectible Clemente baseball card.

Pitcher David Bednar -- the Pirates’ nominee for MLB’s prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for the third straight year -- was recognized during an on-field ceremony. Standing with him were team chairman Bob Nutting, Clemente’s three sons and Pirates great Andrew McCutchen -- who was the recipient of the Clemente Award in 2015. In addition, a player from each of Pittsburgh’s Minor League affiliates and development teams was saluted for outstanding contributions to the community in the cities where they played this season, in conjunction with the Pirates Community Commitment Program.

The icing on the cake was the fact that all Pirates players and coaches in uniform were proudly wearing jerseys that featured No. 21 as a tribute to Clemente -- a 15-time All-Star, 12-time Gold Glove winner, four-time batting champion, National League MVP (1966) and two-time World Series champion (1960 and 1971) during his 18 seasons with Pittsburgh (1955-1972). Oh, and the No. 21 was also cut into grass in right field in front of the Clemente Wall, which is 21 feet high.

“The annual league-wide celebration of Roberto Clemente is a special day, but for Pittsburghers and our fans it means so much more,” Nutting said. “In wearing his No. 21 on the field and making a positive impact in the lives of others within our community, we are proud to continue to carry on his legacy.”

Tragically, Clemente was killed in a plane crash on New Year’s Eve in 1972 while on a mission to deliver relief supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. In the spirit of his dedication to community service, on Friday, Pirates players, coaches and members of the front office participated in the team’s annual Roberto Clemente Day of Service, presented by Fanatics. Volunteers donated their time to projects related to the pillars of Pirates Charities -- namely youth baseball and softball, military appreciation and support for cancer and mental health programs.

“Everyone in the organization is truly inspired by Roberto Clemente’s legacy,” Pirates president Travis Williams said. “It’s special to be able to honor what a great player he was on the field, but probably his true legacy is what he did in the community. That continues to inspire us to go out and give back to the community here in Pittsburgh.”

One of Friday’s community service activities was making improvements to three fields at Brighton Heights Park that are home to hundreds of youngsters involved in the Northside RBI program. A large Pirates contingent that included Williams, general manager Ben Cherington, members of the Clemente family, corporate partners Duquesne Light, Fanatics and SportsNet Pittsburgh -- plus players such as Yasmani Grandal, Joey Bart, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Bailey Falter and Jalen Beeks -- spent time weeding, trimming grass, and resurfacing the infield as well as the mound and the home-plate area.

The Pirates displayed their appreciation for the military, with the help from the Veterans Leadership Program, at a drive-thru food distribution center in Pittsburgh’s Strip District that provided grocery items to more than 150 veterans and their families. Meanwhile, at PNC Park, members of the team’s front office were busy writing notes and letters of appreciation that will be delivered to World War II veterans via the Gary Sinise Foundation.

Pirates players and coaches also visited the Allegheny Health Network Exercise Oncology and Resiliency Center, where they provided instruction to cancer patients during morning workout class. A meet-and-greet also took place, and Pirates staff delivered hats with notes of encouragement attached to them to AHN Cancer Institute patients and provided pastries and coffee to the staff there.

At the Women’s Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, the Pirates and corporate partner Sheetz prepared lunch for the residents and staff, reorganized and replenished items of need for the distribution center, and delivered breakfast to the staff and volunteers who support the residents.

Finally, in association with Hispanic Heritage Month, the Pirates visited Pittsburgh’s Latino Community Center where they restocked the food pantry, assembled snack packs and meals for children affected by food insecurity, and provided toys and activities for the center’s early childhood room.

Altogether, nearly 150 Pirates front office and corporate partner volunteers, and upwards of 40 players and coaches, took part in the day of service on Friday, giving back to the Pittsburgh community. Roberto Jr. was impressed by the comprehensive effort that was conducted in honor of his father.

“It’s truly amazing that after all these years when you hear the name Clemente, it signifies goodwill, getting involved and serving others. And that’s stronger than ever,” he said. “It’s awesome that when you hear my father’s name, baseball is secondary. To see everyone come together like this in honor of Dad’s legacy and have a positive impact on the lives of so many people is wonderful.

“My father came to Pittsburgh in 1955 and the love affair that Pirates fans have with him started then. More than 50 years after he passed, that love affair is as strong as before. The way he felt about the people in Pittsburgh and the love and respect they gave back to him is something that keeps on giving. My dad is loved everywhere, but here in Pittsburgh, it’s very, very special.”

Bednar, who’s in his fourth year as a member of the Pirates, is a two-time All-Star closer. He was born and raised in Western Pennsylvania and graduated from Mars High School, about 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh. The 29-year-old right-hander was a Pirates fan long before he became a Pirate, and being nominated for the Clemente Award again means a great deal to him.

“It’s a huge honor,” he said of the award that annually recognizes the MLB player who best represents the game through extraordinary character, community involvement, philanthropy and positive contributions on and off the field. “Obviously, what Roberto meant to this city and baseball as a whole, and all of his efforts on and off the field, is truly incredible. I want to try and carry his legacy on.”

Said Williams: “There’s no cause that David Bednar doesn’t say yes to. That’s really special, and we’re super thankful to have him, not only for what he does on the field but also out in the community. Being a Pittsburgh kid and having grown up here, being nominated for the Clemente Award means that much more to him.”

Bednar has shared that giving back to the community is a major part of his life, not just his baseball career.

“I’m fortunate to have great role models in my parents, and now my wife [Casey] is equally about giving back and helping out the community,” he said. “To have that support system and have everyone pulling in the same direction is huge -- along with Pirates Charities and Bob Nutting. They all do a great job giving back and spreading a lot of love throughout the community.”

On the Pirates’ end, that’s never more evident than it is during their Clemente Day of Service and MLB’s Clemente Day.
