        "The Orioles gained a game in the AL East race and sit only a half-game back with 24 games remaining.",

        "Dean Kremer is unlikely to make his next scheduled start after taking a liner off his forearm Saturday, so Eflin’s return from the injured list offers a much-needed jolt for the September postseason race."
