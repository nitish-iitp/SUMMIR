        "Bahrain have suffered just the two defeats in their last nine matches in all competitions.",
        "Shin must decide whether to tinker with his Bahrain XI, it not necessarily being a simple decision to change players who started a 5-0 defeat.",
        "Justin Hubner may lead to Wahyu Prasetyo being brought into the team, providing that Talajic sticks with a back five.",
        "Bahrain possible starting lineup: Lutfalla; Emmanuel, Baqer, Benadi, Al-Khulasi; Madan, Al-Asfoor, Haram, Marhoon; Al-Aswad, Abduljabbar",
        "Indonesia possible starting lineup: Paes; Walsh, Ridho, Idzes, Prasetyo, Verdonk; Ferdinan, Tjoe-A-On, Jenner, Oratmangoen; Struick"

    "Others": [
        "We say: Bahrain 2-1 Indonesia",
        "Although Bahrain lost heavily last time out, we cannot ignore that they managed to defeat Australia in their first game on away territory. With that in mind, we are backing a narrow home victory in Riffa, which would keep them in the top three as a bare minimum."
