Rabat - Whether Morocco will build on their 4-1 win against Gabon is a question that will be answered in hours, as the Atlas Lions face Lesotho in an AFCON qualifier game later today.

The match will take place at 8 p.m., bringing key football players as part of coach Walid Regragui’s lineup.Moroccan cuisine

Both Morocco’s Arriyadia sports channel and beIn Sports 1 broadcast tonight’s game.

Speaking at a pre-match conference on Sunday, Regragui spoke of the effectiveness and the limits of the offensive  strategy he used against Gabon.

“We scored goals, but our defensive fallback wasn’t as intense and quick,” he said, adding that the match against Lesotho will enable his team to tighten up spaces and be strong in the battle for second balls.

Regragui also pledged to give opportunities to young players during today’s match to gain in confidence and maturity as they vie to represent Morocco on the continental stage. 

The head coach noted his cautious approach to choosing the right moment to give young players a chance.

The Atlas Lions are well aware that no match is a walkover in Africa, a lesson learned from experiences in both previous AFCON tournaments and qualifiers.

The latest continental campaign in Cote d’Ivoire ended in bitter disappointment for Morocco, with the Atlas Lions suffering an early exit following a 2-0 defeat to South Africa in the round of 16.

Despite the Atlas Lions’ recent 4-1 victory against Gabon, criticism has persisted. Many fans have maintained that the team still needs to elevate their performances to meet the standards required to win a major trophy in upcoming tournaments..

As a result, tonight’s game is set to serve as another platform for fans to assess whether the Atlas Lions are on an upward trajectory as they prepare to finally rise to the occasion when Morocco hosts the next Africa Cup of Nations.
