        "Croatia have got out of tougher situations. Their slogan – 'Best when it's hardest' – is wholly apt. It didn't quite gel in the first two matches, but on both occasions things looked better in the second half. Dalić will surely make several changes, possibly leaving out Marcelo Brozović, moving Luka Modrić and Mateo Kovačić back and playing the talented Luka Sučić in front of them. Dalić must find a way; when the going gets tough, he usually does.",
        "Facing Croatia with the fear of elimination could be a huge mistake. Italy can certainly play better than they did in Gelsenkirchen."

        "Only one team have successfully defended their EURO crown, yet the minimum expectation for Italy is a knockout place and they have work to do. As do Croatia."
