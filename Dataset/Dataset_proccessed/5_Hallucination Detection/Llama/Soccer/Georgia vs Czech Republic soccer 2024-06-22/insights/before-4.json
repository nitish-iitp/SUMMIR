        "On paper, it’s easy to understand why Czechia is entering the favorites, particularly after such a disciplined performance on Tuesday, but this matchup has a different feel and I see value in picking the teams to share the points in what should be a tight, cagey clash.",
        "Georgia have picked up draws against Scotland and Greece in the past 12 months, and they’re capable of a similarly competitive effort against a solid but unspectacular Czechia team.",
        "It may not be pretty but I like this price for a draw, even with both nations needing a victory."

        "Georgia vs Czechia same-game parlay (SGP): Draw, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia anytime goalscorer, Under 4.5 cards (+2,400 at Betano)",
        "The Czechs had just 27% of the possession against Portugal, buying into a compact defensive game plan to frustrate Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes, but can they flip the switch and come out of their shell against a Georgia team ranked 75th in the world?",
        "The quality of Valencia keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili helps their chances of grabbing a point and it took some terrific Turkish strikes to get past him on Tuesday.",
        "Even if there’s a hint of desperation in the air with two teams sitting on zero points, I don’t see a flurry of cards at Volksparkstadion, so I’m adding the Under on 4.5 cards for my SGP.",
        "Much depends on captain Tomas Soucek in midfield.",
        "With the early tournament nerves out of the way, I expect a better effort from Georgia here. Willy Sagnol’s men are good enough to make this a real contest and it only takes an instant for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to create a moment of magic.",
        "Strike partner Georges Mikautadze stepped up against Turkey with a first-half equalizer and their link-up play offers another path to goal.",
        "Georgia have the underdogs tag for this June 22 battle in the latest Euro 2024 odds, but my free Georgia vs. Czechia predictions and Euro 2024 picks point to a more even contest."
