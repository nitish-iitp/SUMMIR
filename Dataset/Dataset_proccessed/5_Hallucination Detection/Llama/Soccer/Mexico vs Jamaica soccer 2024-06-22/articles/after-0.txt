Mexico player ratings vs Jamaica: Edson Alvarez injury overshadows narrow El Tri win against Reggae Boyz

El Tri started Copa America out with a victory, but losing Edson Alvarez brings cloud to tournament

Mexico are entering a new era. Their veterans of old, players like Memo Ochoa, Hector Herrera and Chucky Lozano are seemingly out of the national team picture. They are undergoing a rebuild of sorts, but at the same time, they knew that Copa America 2024 was their chance to prove to the world that they are among the game's elite and one of the best in CONCACAF.

They took on one of their regional opponents in the Reggae Boyz Saturday, and it was the perfect test to begin the tournament.

Nothing went to plan - at all.

Article continues below

Jaime Lozano's squad lost their captain and star player Edson Alvarez to a hamstring injury just 30 minutes into the match, and from there on out, it was just messy.

Santiago Gimenez, their superstar forward, had just 16 touches across 68 minutes. The attack was a nightmare all night, with little to no service from wide areas, and Orbelin Pineda failing to connect the midfield and attack centrally.

Lucky for El Tri, they didn't need their attack to get their winner.

In the 69th minute, fullback Gerardo Arteaga stepped up to score a belter of an effort from the edge of the box, handing them the winner in their 1-0 victory.

Jamaica, meanwhile, had initially scored only to see it called back for an offsides on Michail Antonio in the 50th minute. Other than that moment, the Reggae Boyz failed to be much of a threat.

For Lozano and Co. in a tight Group B, it was a really important three points. However, this sort of performance won't be enough throughout the tournament if they want to make any sort of run.

GOAL rates Mexico's players from NRG Stadium.

Goalkeeper & Defense

Julio Gonzalez (6/10):

Played his role well, made a few saves and kept a clean sheet.

Jorge Sanchez (7/10):

The Porto fullback operated his flank well and was defenisvely sound.

Cesar Montes (7/10):

A rock on the backline. Defended well, was rarely beaten and was the leader needed after Alvarez's departure early in the first half.

Johan Vazquez (6/10):

Struggled with passing and linking well with the midfield, but played his role well defensively.

Gerardo Arteaga (7/10):

My goodness, have a hit. Not the best performance from him, but that goal makes up for it. He stepped up when El Tri needed him.

Midfield

Luis Chavez (7/10):

A composed showing; he stepped up massively when they needed him. Good tempo control, good patience on the ball, all around, a solid showing.

Edson Alvarez (N/A):

Was removed from the match 30 minutes in with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. Could be a terrible blow.

Attack

Uriel Antuna (6/10):

Struggled to provide width and any sort of dynamic to the attack. Lozano will expect more out of him from a creative perspective.

Orbelin Pineda (6/10):

Not his best evening, but he didn't do anything wrong, either. He created one big moment and completed 78% of his chances.

Julio Quinones (5/10):

A few promising moments, but lacked a clinical touch when entering the box. Failed to provide any sort of service into the box when tasked.

Santiago Gimenez (4/10):

Hard to blame him with no service in the attack, but he was a ghost the entire match. Was removed in the 67th minute after a lifeless showing.

Subs & Manager

Luis Romo (8/10):

He stepped in for Alvarez and was brilliant in the midfield. Had the assist on Arteaga's strike, too.

Carlos Rodriguez (6/10):

Arrived off the bench in the second half, but didn't impact the match much.

Guillermo Martinez (6/10):

Replaced Santi, but in the same way as the Feyenoord striker, had no service.

Roberto Alvarado (N/A):

Subbed on late to help close out the match.

Erick Sanchez (N/A):

Subbed on late, replaced Luis Chavez.

Jaime Lozano (5/10):

Losing Alvarez is less than ideal - that's understood. However, the El Tri attack was abysmal Saturday night. The tactics set up by Lozano failed Gimenez, Quinones and Antuna. A brilliant strike from their fullback saved Mexico - that won't happen against one of CONMEBOL's elite later in this tournament.
