COMMENTRY
That’s it from this game then! The decider is to be played on the 17th of this month. That game begins at (1330 GMT). Till then, goodbye and take care.
Charith Asalanka says it’s an important win for them. The toss was very important and he’s happy he won the toss. Adds 160 would have been a par score and the openers set the tone for them. Credits the way Dunith Wellalage played. Ends by saying he wants to win the series.
Rovman Powell says they did well to keep them down to 160. Adds the wicket wasn’t at its best and Sri Lanka used it to their advantage. Mentions they have an opportunity to reflect on their mistakes and do well in the next game. Ends by saying he’s looking forward to the decider.
Pathum Nissanka, MAN OF THE MATCH, he says he had a special plan when he played the spin bowlers. Adds he had a target in mind.
Earlier in day, after winning the toss and elected to bat, Lanka were off to a good start courtesy their openers. Pathum Nissanka was the star with a half ton. However, Lanka didn’t have the finish they would have liked and finished with a score just above 160 but that proved to be enough by some margin.
For West Indies, they just couldn’t cope up with the turn and bounce the Sri Lankan batters were getting. They just never got off the blocks. Just the one batter touched the 20-run mark and that speaks volumes about their struggles with the bat in this game. They were bowled out for their 4th lowest total in T20Is.
A thumping win then for Lanka to level the series! Their spinners have spun a web around the West Indian batters. It was Dunith Wellalage who began things as he got King and after that, wickets just kept falling. Theekshana too joined the party and so did Asalanka and Hasaranga. Matheesha Pathirana also got a wicket to his name at the end. Overall, it was an outstanding performance from the hosts.
In over# 17 0W	Maheesh Theekshana 7/2(3.1)
OUT! BOWLED! Flatter and on middle, the carrom ball. Alzarri Joseph looks to flick but misses, plays the wrong line and it crashes the stumps. Sri Lanka level the series. They win by 73 runs.

OUT! GONE! The captain goes and that could be the end of Windies. Shorter and angling down leg. Powell looks to help it away but gloves it to the keeper who dives to his left and takes it. First wicket to a seamer as well.
