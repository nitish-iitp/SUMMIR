New Zealand vs Sri Lanka, T20 World Cup 2022 live score

New Zealand vs Sri Lanka, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Glenn Phillips scored 104 off 64 balls after which Trent Boult recorded figures of 4/13 as New Zealand gave Sri Lanka a 65-run hiding and put one foot in the semi-finals. The Kiwis had got off to a shaky start in the powerplay but Phillips turned the tables with a strong partnership with Daryl Mitchell. His century helped New Zealand score 167/7 after which Trent Boult and Tim Southee sent the Sri Lankans tumbling in the powerplay. Southee started with a wicket-maiden after which Boult went on to take four wickets as Sri Lanka struggle to provide any kind of a challenge.

T20 World Cup Live score: New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by 65 runs

Stumping ends the match but a slight pause in the handshakes there. Wonder if the umpires indicated to Kane Williamson that they might be checking something. But then they resume the handshakes in a couple of seconds. Comprehensive win for New Zealand, first time they are bowling out teams in consecutive matches in the T20 World Cup. New Zealand now have one foot in the semi-finals.

New Zealand vs Sri Lanka Live: OUT! Shanaka's resistance ends

Wicket No.4 for Boult. Short delivery that Shanaka tries to pull, can't get hold of it properly and it is caught at the square leg boundary. 

Shanaka c Mitchell b Boult 35 (32), Sri Lanka 93/9 in 17 overs

NZ vs SL T20 World Cup live score: Sri Lanka 82/8 in 15 overs 

Captain Dasun Shanaka farming strike now, as is expected. Sri Lanka need 86 to win from the last five overs. May not be impossible yet, but pretty improbable.

Oct 29, 2022 4:28 PM IST
T20 World Cup Live score: FOUR! Misfield from Sodhi

Shanaka dabs Ferguson to third man where Sodhi lets the ball pass through his hands and it rolls away to the boundary. 

Oct 29, 2022 4:25 PM IST
New Zealand vs Sri Lanka Live: OUT! 

Theekshana edges Santner to slips off the very next ball. Sri Lanka down to their last two wickets now. New Zealand are going to end up with a frankly absurd net run rate if they can wrap up this match in the next couple of overs. 

Theekshana c Neesham b Santner 0 (3), New Zealand 65/8 in 12.3 overs

Oct 29, 2022 4:23 PM IST
NZ vs SL T20 World Cup live score: New Zealand finally drop a catch

Wasn't an easy catch but you wouldn't expect a Kiwi to drop that. Shanaka goes high up into the night sky off the second ball of the over, bowler Santner and Conway  look at each other for a second before the former goes for it and that may have been the difference. Never settled underneath it and misjudged  where the ball was falling and at last, New Zealand drop a catch. 

Oct 29, 2022 4:20 PM IST
T20 World Cup Live score: OUT! The wickets keep tumbling

Hasaranga hits it to Kane Williamson at mid-on who takes a sharp catch diving forward. New Zealand are not giving any lifelines to Sri Lanka, unlike what the latter were kind enough to do earlier in the day. 

Hasaranga c Williamson b Sodhi 4 (6), Sri Lanka 64/7 in 11.4 overs  

Oct 29, 2022 4:13 PM IST
New Zealand vs Sri Lanka Live: OUT! Dangerman Rajapaksa goes!

The fightback ends and this might just be the game. Toe ends this lofted shot and holes out at mid-on. Sri Lanka down to their last four wickets now, Hasaranga walks into the middle. 

Rajapaksa c Williamson b Ferguson 34 (22), Sri Lanka 58/6 in 10 overs

Oct 29, 2022 4:03 PM IST
NZ vs SL T20 World Cup live score: SIX! Rajapaksa hits his 2nd biggie

Well technically this would be his first real biggie, considering the first six was the flattest of them all. Sodhi drags down the length and Rajapaksa muscles it over deep midwicket.  

Oct 29, 2022 3:58 PM IST
T20 World Cup Live score: OUT! Santner strikes first ball!

Just one man out in the deep and Chamika Karunaratne finds him with aplomb. Karunaratne backs away early to open up the off side, Santner goes short and the batter readjusts for a pull shot, that goes straight down the throat of deep midwicket.  

Karunaratne c Boult b Santner 3 (8), 24/5 in 6.1 overs
