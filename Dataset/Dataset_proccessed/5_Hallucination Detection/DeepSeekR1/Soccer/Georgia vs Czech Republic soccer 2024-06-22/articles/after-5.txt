Georgia earned its first-ever point at a major tournament in a 1-1 draw with the Czech Republic at Euro 2024 on Saturday.

Video reviews were in the spotlight as the Czechs had a goal for Adam Hlozek disallowed for hand ball. Georgia, the only team making its debut at Euro 2024, then took the lead with a Georges Mikautadze penalty given for hand ball by Czech defender Robin Hranec.

The Czech team got back into the game when a header rebounded off the post and Patrik Schick scored with his chest. Schick went off with a calf injury soon after.

Georgia could have won but Saba Lobjanidze shot narrowly over the bar with the last kick of the game on a counterattack.

The draw means that both teams almost certainly require a win in their last group games to qualify for the knockout stages. Turkey and Portugal are the other two teams in Group F. They play later Saturday.

Follow all the reaction from Georgia v Czech Republic below - plus build-up to Turkey v Portugal at Euro 2024:

Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne embody the best and worst of Belgium in vital win over Romania

Romelu Lukaku stood with his back not only to goal, but to the raucous mass of crimson behind it. From somewhere within that throng, a plume of red smoke billowed towards the roof of the stadium. It might as well have been a warning to Romania, but just one minute into this critical Euro 2024 clash, they did not have time to heed it.

Lukaku, so often maligned for his endeavours with Belgium, executed his hold-up to perfection, fending off Andrei Burca and cushioning the ball into the stride of Youri Tielemans. The midfielder did the rest, driving the ball low and hard past Florin Nita.

Full-time! Belgium 2-0 Romania

90+4 mins: Belgium get the job done!

After a shock defeat to Slovakia in their opening match, Belgium needed to come here and get the win. The consequences of beating Romania mean that all four teams in Group E have three points after two games each.

It will be a nail-biting end to the group stages for all of them. Youri Tielemans and Kevin De Bruyne scored the goals, Belgium take the win and move one step closer to the last-16.

85 mins: Belgium try to put the game to bed with Leandro Trossard slipped into the box on the right hand side. He holds onto the ball a little too long and his square pass to Lukaku is blocked and cleared.

82 mins: That goal should be enough for Belgium. There was a VAR check to see whether the goal should stand as De Bruyne was possibly offside.

The result fell Belgium’s way and they have a two goal lead at last.

GOAL! Belgium 2-0 Romania (De Bruyne, 79’)⚽️

79 mins: Has Kevin De Bruyne won this game for Belgium?

A hopeful ball is punted up the pitch by Koen Casteels and drops beautifully for De Bruyne who makes a run in between the centre-backs.

As the ball bounces into the box, De Bruyne beats Florin Nita to it and pokes it into the ground, past the goalkeeper and over the line.
