EURO 2024
BELGIUM 0-1 SLOVAKIA: ROMELU LUKAKU DENIED TWICE BY VAR AS GROUP E FAVOURITES STUNNED AT EURO 2024
BYDANIEL HARRIS

UPDATED 17/06/2024 AT 20:22 GMT

Romelu Lukaku had two goals chalked out by VAR as Belgium slumped to a 1-0 defeat against Slovakia at Euro 2024. Slovakia took an early lead courtesy of Ivan Schranz after Jeremy Doku gave away the ball near his own penalty area. Lukaku thought he had equalised in the second half - twice - but technology intervened to deny him, once for offside and once for a handball in the build-up.

‘I want to be a fair loser’ - Tedesco refuses to criticise officials after Belgium loss to Slovakia

A performance of discipline, aggression and intensity gave Slovakia a shock win over Belgium, Ivan Schranz’s early goal enough to snaffle the points.
The Red Devils will still back themselves to qualify for the last 16, but they have put themselves under pressure and looked a long way from contention.

Belgium started the game well with Jeremy Doku to the fore. But then on seven minutes, he passed the ball across his own box and it was intercepted, a lovely flick from Robert Bozenik setting Juraj Kucka for a shot, and though Koen Casteels saved it, Schranz was there to slot home a smart finish.

Though Belgium were a little better in the second half, especially once Lois Openda came on, and Romelu Lukaku had two strikes disallowed by VAR –-one for a marginal but definite offside and the other, far more harshly, for handball by Openda in the build-up.
By and large, though, Slovakia defended well, recording their biggest win since beating Italy in the 2010 World Cup. With matches to come against Romania and Ukraine, they will fancy themselves to make the last 16 from here and rightly so, while Belgium - and Domenico Tedesco in particular - have much thinking to do.
TALKING POINT - WHERE DO BELGIUM GO FROM HERE?
Once upon a time, Belgium were a side with the potential to contend for trophies. And though they never quite forced themselves into a major final, their win over Brazil at the 2018 World Cup was one of the great performances.

The problem they have now, though, is that their golden generation have aged, either still in the team because there is no one else or replaced with players who are less good.

As such, perhaps they need to change things. One thing Tedesco might do is freshen up his XI with young players - Openda did more than enough to keep his place after coming on as sub, while Johan Bakayoko also looked more likely to make something happen than Leandro Trossard.
As well as change personal, he might also try to change mindset: there are various reasons Belgium lost, but perhaps the most significant among them is that Slovakia played with greater moxie and desire: they did not expect to win, they expected to give everything, which turned out to be enough for the win. But had The Red Devils done likewise, things might have worked out differently.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - LUKAS HARASLIN (SLOVAKIA)
This could have been almost any Slovakian, but Haraslin gets the nod because he was a constant menace, his enterprise and devil setting the tone.
PLAYER RATINGS
Belgium: Casteels 6, Castagne 5, Faes 6, Debast 6, Carrasco 5, Mangala 5, Onana 5, Trossard 5, De Bruyne 6, Doku 5, Lukaku 5. Subs: Bakayoko 6, Tielemans 6, Openda 7, Lukebakio 6.
Slovakia: Dubravka 7, Pekalik 7, Vavro 8, Skriniar 8, Hancko 8, Kucka 7, Lobotka 7, Duda 7, Schranz 7, Bozenik 8, Harslin 8. Subs: Strelec 6, Suslov 6, Duris 6, Obert 6.
KEY MOMENTS
3’ - DOKU, PLAYING ON THE RIGHT, IS IMMEDIATELY INTO THE ACTION
He rides a tackle from Hancko, screeches into the box, and squares for De Bruyne, who slides in trying to score, only to send the ball square to Lukaku who, on the half-turn clobbers his finish into Dubravka's chest. That was a good save, but also a good chance, and that's the thing with Lukaku: he lacks the class to find deft finishes so every effort is a high-percentage, low-tariff punch.

7’ - GOAL!! Belgium 0-1 Slovakia (Schranz) Now then! Almost very game has had an early goal and here's another - but who predicted this one?! Slovakia win the ball deep inside the Belgium half when someone, Doku I think, gives it away. Bozenik then backheels to Kucka, and though his shot is saved by Casteels, he can't shovel away form danger, and from an acute angle, Schranz volleys home! He might've been offside at the point of the initial shot ... but VAR says not!

56’ - GOAL!! BELGIUM 1-1 SLOVAKIA (LUKAKU) The corner goes short and for once Slovakia switch off, Trossard allowed time to curve a luscious ball to the far post, where Onana heads back across - he's celebrating before the ball's over the line, so good is his knock-back - and Lukaku pokes home.

57’ - BUT WAS LUKAKU OFFSIDE?
He may have been, you know!

58’ - NO GOAL!! BELGIUM 0-1 SLOVAKIA
BLukaku was fractionally ahead of the play when Onana won his header, and Belgium will be feeling very sorry for themselves.


86’ - GOAL! BELGIUM 1-1 SLOVAKIA (LUKAKU) As I was saying! Tedesco has tried everything and it's Openda who gives him what he needs, chasing a long ball and beating Vavro for pace, skirting around his outside and cutting back for Lukaku to punch back whence it came. Salvation!

89’ - THIS IS GOOD
We see soundwaves which prove ball-to-hand contact, it takes it away from Vavro, and this is going to be disallowed!

89’ - NO GOAL!! BELGIUM 0-1 SLOVAKIA Romelu Lukaku has now had two goals ckalked off - just about correctly this second time. The handball was accidental but perceptibl,e and effective in helping Openda lose Vavro.
KEY STAT
Since FIFA began its world rankings, no side has beaten an opponent as many places above it as Slovakia (48th) beating Belgium (second).
