India faces Canada in the T20 Cricket World Cup.

The 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is underway, co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. This is the ninth time this event has been staged. In 2022, Australia hosted this event, with England defeating Pakistan to win the tournament. We’re currently in the group stage of the tournament, with Saturday featuring a Group A meeting between India and Canada. India has already clinched a spot in the next round thanks to its undefeated record so far in the tournament, while Canada sits fourth in the group standings and looks poised to exit the competition in the group stage.

India has advanced out of the group stage in every ICC T20 World Cup. It won the first one back in 2007 and was a semifinalist in 2022. The win over Pakistan goes a long way toward keeping that streak alive.

Canada is competing in its first ICC T20 World Cup. It appears that journey will end with an early exit, but simply getting to this tournament is an accomplishment for a Canadian side that hasn’t had a ton of success historically. The team has qualified for the main Cricket World Cup four times but has never advanced out of the group stage there either.
