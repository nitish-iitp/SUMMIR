South Africa choked in front of a spirited Netherlands and crashed out of the T20 World Cup after suffering a 13-run defeat in their must-win match in Adelaide on Sunday.

The Temba Bavuma-led side, who were one win away from securing a semi-final spot, threw away their chances. South Africa's defeat means that India have qualified for the last four stage. The second semi-finalist from Group 2 will be decided on the result between Pakistan and Bangladesh.

If the match gets washed out, then Pakistan will be through based on better net run rate. But if either of the two sides win, then that team will join India in the semi-finals.

Colin Ackermann's late-hitting took Netherlands to 158/4 after put into bat. Netherlands had a slow start, with openers Stephan Myburgh and Max O'Dowd adding 58 runs for the first wicket.

Aiden Markram ended South Africa's frustration as he dismissed Myburgh for 37. Keshav Maharaj then ended O'Dowd (29) struggle as South Africa reduced Netherlands to 97/2 in 12.4 overs.

Suddenly, Netherlands found their momentum as Tom Cooper and Colin Ackermann started to take on the South African bowlers with their brilliant strokeplay. Cooper played a knock of 35 off just 19 balls before Maharaj foxed him with the lack of pace.

Ackermann, however, carried on to ensure his bowlers have something to defend. The right-hander remained unbeaten on 41 off 26 balls.

In reply, South Africa had a horrendous start as they lost their openers Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma in the powerplay overs. Although Proteas had enough wickets in hand, they pressed the panic button and messed up the run chase.

Brandon Glover returned with the figures of 3/9 in his two overs as he bagged the crucial wickets of Rilee Rossouw (25) and David Miller (17). Fred Klaassen joined the party as South Africa continued to lose wickets in regular intervals. With asking run rate shooting, South Africa crumbled and were restricted to 145/8.
