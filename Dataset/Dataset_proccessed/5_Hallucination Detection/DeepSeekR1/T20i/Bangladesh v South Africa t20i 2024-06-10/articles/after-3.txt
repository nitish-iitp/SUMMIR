Just the one game tomorrow, Pakistan taking on Canada in New York. That's probably the start of Pakistan's run to the title.

As for today, catch up with everything that happened in New York in Timothy Abraham's match report.

See you soon.

South Africa are top of Group D with three wins from three. The rest is up for grabs. No other team has more than one win. Bangladesh are probably favourites because they have already beaten Sri Lanka, but the Netherlands and even Nepal might fancy they are in with a shout.

South Africa captain Aiden Markram: "I think it got pretty nerve racking in the final over and it can make you mentally tired. Sometimes when you get on the right side it makes for good entertainment.

"Fortunately that ball could've gone anywhere and if that catch was missed it would've been a different conversation. Luckily we got on the right side of victory.

"It all depends on the situation and where you want to drag the game out or use players to attack and take wickets. The seamers were bowling really well and we wanted to drag the game out.

"It was fantastic for Klaasen and Miller to get some runs and the two of them were a great partnership."

'A match we should have won'

Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto: "I think this is a match we should have won. Last couple of overs they bowled well, it can happen in cricket.

"I think Rishad is very good. He's worked very hard and is showing our skills. We've struggled with leg-spin the last 10-15 years, we've got lucky.

"Thanks to all the supporters, I hope they come to the West Indies as well."

'It'll be good confidence for the boys'

19:21 BST 10 June 2024

Player of the match Heinrich Klaasen: "It was not a nice one to watch, it was good that the boys got it over the line.

"The wicket is not too great for strokeplay. David showed us how to bat on this wicket in the last match and we applied that today. We were about 10 runs short.

"Luckily we've got experience in the changing room. We had to play with less of a one-day mindset today.

"It'll be good confidence for the boys, we've had three pressurised games now."

It's just tough for both sides to bat on this pitch and every game we've had have been low-scoring thrillers.

Samuel Kirkwood: Whoever decided on that rule needs to be sacked. Can say what you like but at end of day those 4 runs have cost Bangladesh. At very least ball should be re-bowled.

And here's the wording from the playing conditions...

"If following a Player Review request, an original decision of Out is changed to Not out, then the ball is still deemed to have become dead when the original decision was made. The batting side, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, shall not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a Not out decision, other than any No ball penalty."

I'm being asked about the dead ball rule in the event of an overturned lbw. I have a funny feeling it goes back to England's James Taylor and a World Cup game against Australia. I think it cost him a century.

In fact, Bangladesh only managed four runs off the bat in the last over.

Say what you want about that New York pitch, but the cricket there has been gripping.

Maharaj bowled three full tosses in the final over, but Bangladesh did not find the boundary off any of them. South Africa have three wins from three and are pretty much through.

South Africa win by four runs

Ban 109-7

It's a full toss, but Taskin can only smear it for a single.

South Africa survive and have still never lost a T20 to Bangladesh.

Those four leg byes would have forced a super over.

Mahmudullah c Markram b Maharaj 20 (Ban 108-6)

Incredible!

It looks like Mahmudullah has won it for Bangladesh, but Aiden Markram gets around the long-on rope to take a clutch catch.

Six or our, six or out. The game in one ball.

Markram holds on. Mahmudullah can't believe it.

Six needed off one. Taskin Ahmed the man to do it...

Caught at long-on! Did Jaker Ali need to do that?

Seven off three. Six for a super over.

Rishad Hossain the new man.
