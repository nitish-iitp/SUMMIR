Fans were treated to an extended matchup between Reed Sheppard and Stephon Castle

In the previous two games between the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs, basketball fans clamored for more action between Reed Sheppard and Stephon Castle, who was picked one spot after Sheppard in the draft. Udoka and Mitch Johnson, who is filling in for Gregg Popovich, gave the fans what they wanted.

Castle started and played 25 minutes. He and Sheppard took on each other during most of their stints. The Spurs rookie finished with five points, two rebounds and three steals. He went 2-for-8, including 1-for-5 from deep.

The next meeting between the two will be on Feb. 27 when the Rockets host the Spurs in Houston.
