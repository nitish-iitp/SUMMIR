        "Mark Vientos became the first Met to hit multiple homers in a postseason game since Michael Conforto on October 31, 2015, in Game Four of the World Series against the Kansas City Royals. The last to do it in a playoff (postseason but not the World Series) game was Carlos Beltran, who did so in Game Four of the 2006 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals. Luis Severino put up a Quality Start, scattering six hits around six innings."

        "A walk-off single by Nick Castellanos with two outs in the bottom of the ninth gave the Philadelphia Phillies a 7–6 win over the New York Mets, evening the best-of-five NL Division Series at one game apiece. The single capped off a see-saw battle at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, a game that saw the teams combine for seven runs in the final three innings. Bryce Harper hit a walk-off grand slam in the ninth inning. Bryson Stott ripped a one-out, two-run triple to the right-field corner, putting the home nine back in front. He scored on a dribbler to third by J.T. Realmuto, sending the game to the ninth with the Phillies leading, 6–4."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Carlos Mendoza praised his 'ability to slow the game down' and have awareness of the situation. He added, 'He continues to come through. It was pretty impressive the way he went the other way and took Sánchez deep, a pitch up in the zone (that he) drove to right field. But then we get down, he gets on top of a fastball from Strahm and ties the game in the ninth. Aaron Judge expressed pride in the team's resilience after the comeback win. The coach highlighted the victory as a pivotal moment in their playoff push."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Phillies made two sparkling defensive plays in the top of the second to save at least one run. With no outs and a runner on second, second baseman Bryson Stott made a leaping grab of a J.D. Martinez liner up the middle to take away a sure single. Two batters later, first baseman Bryce Harper made a two-out diving stop to his left to field a hot Francisco Alvarez grounder that certainly would have scored the runner from second. What made these plays even bigger was that they erased a throwing error by third baseman Edmundo Sosa, which is what got the runner to second in the first place. Castellanos made a sliding catch with two outs in the top of the ninth to rob Pete Alonso of a single to shallow right. The Phillies made two sparkling defensive plays in the top of the second to save at least one run. The game went into the bottom of the ninth with the Phillies leading, 6–4. The last to do it in a playoff (postseason but not the World Series) game was Carlos Beltran, who did so in Game Four of the 2006 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals."
