        "Bradley Beal was benched for the first time in nine years in the Phoenix Suns' game against the Philadelphia 76ers, a move that reportedly caught him by surprise as he hadn't received any indication it was going to happen.",
        "Beal scored 25 points off the bench, including 20 in the second half, to help the Suns end a four-game losing streak with a 109-99 win over the Sixers.",
        "Head coach Mike Budenholzer said the decision to bench Beal and Jusuf Nurkić was made because the Suns 'needed to make a change' after a four-game losing streak.",
        "Beal made it clear after the game that he considers himself a starter.",
        "Beal stated that he hasn't heard from the Suns regarding a potential trade, which he would need to sign off on thanks to the no-trade clause in his contract.",
        "Beal would need to do the same in order for Phoenix to move him ahead of the Feb. 6 deadline.",
        "Beal said Monday, 'I need to be addressed because I hold the cards. Until I'm addressed and somebody says something different, then I'll be a Sun.'"
