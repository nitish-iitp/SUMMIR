Dallas Mavericks vs LA Clippers player stats and box score for Oct. 14 | 2024 NBA preseason

The Los Angeles Clippers had a winning debut at their new home, the Intuit Dome, as they torched the Dallas Mavericks 110-96 on Monday. The Clippers come off a preseason win against the Brooklyn Nets and added another win to their kitty, while the Mavericks continue to be in dire need of a win-dropping three of their tune-up games so far.

The onus was on Klay Thompson to lead the side with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving being rested. However, the four-time NBA champion went scoreless. Thompson recorded three rebounds and one assist in the first half. The second half saw the Mavericks attempt a comeback as they tallied 24 points in the third quarter compared to LA's 27. Meanwhile, the seasoned forward continued to struggle as he went scoreless in the third stretch as well.
