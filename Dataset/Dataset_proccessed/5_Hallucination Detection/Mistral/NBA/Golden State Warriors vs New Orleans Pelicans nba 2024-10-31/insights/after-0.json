        "Draymond Green believes his name remains in the conversation among the league's best defenders and the film from Wednesday night's win over the Pelicans has great campaign footage",
        "Green consistently takes the challenge of guarding the opposing team's top forwards, with his final block coming on a Brandon Ingram 3-pointer",
        "Green is a 6'5 rim protector who is also skilled at switching out onto the perimeter. He can guard on and off the ball and switch one through five. Very few players in the league are as impactful and versatile defensively and two of them — Victor Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren — are 7-plus footers who are early in their second season, without the decade-plus of production on their resume"
