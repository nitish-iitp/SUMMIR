        "With so many key starters out and both teams well under.500, there was a preseason vibe at the Wells Fargo Center until the Wizards made a serious run in the fourth. Bilal Coulibaly helped Washington rally from a 16-point hole and stretched the lead to 101-98 on a jumper. Eric Gordon hit the tying 3 for the Sixers. Maxey hit 11 of 27 shots and had six assists for the Sixers. Gordon and Kelly Oubre Jr. each scored 15 points. Jared Butler scored 26 points for the Wizards and Corey Kispert had 23."
