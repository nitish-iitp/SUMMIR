        "Guerschon Yabusele's rookie season in 2017-18 saw him step on the court just 33 times, averaging a mere 7.1 minutes played, and scoring 2.4 points and 1.6 rebounds per game",
        "Opportunities remained sparse for Yabusele during his sophomore campaign in Boston and in the summer of 2019, the Celtics waived their 2016 first-round selection",
        "In an effort to recharge his career, Yabusele headed back to China, spending another season in the CBA before returning to his home country",
        "He signed with AVSEL, a team owned by NBA Hall of Famer Tony Parker, of the then-LNB Élite, the highest level of professional basketball in France",
        "Yabusele’s road took another turn in 2021 when he moved to Spain and joined Real Madrid of the EuroLeague, where he’d spend the next three seasons",
        "Fast forward to this past summer, where Yabusele hit the gas, accelerating down the home stretch of his return to the NBA",
        "The 2024 Summer Olympics were in Paris and the now 28-year-old had earned a spot on the French national team",
        "When it was time for an Olympic Quarterfinals matchup with Canada, Yabusele was inserted into the starting lineup for France",
        "Although France ultimately lost 98-87, earning the silver medal, Yabusele’s energetic style of play and ability were evident",
        "Less than two weeks later, the 76ers came calling, and Yabusele’s road led him back to the NBA on a one-year, $2.1 million contract",
        "His preseason performance further proved he deserved to be here, earning himself a spot on Philadelphia’s opening night roster and a firm spot in the team’s rotation",
        "As the 76ers have battled injuries all season in their frontcourt, most notably to Joel Embiid, but also to Andre Drummond, Yabusele has been there to step up",
        "He’s started 14 games this season, helping lead Philadelphia to a 7-7 mark in those contests, compared to the team’s 8-13 record when he comes off the bench",
        "He’s averaging 15.3 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game when playing at least 30 minutes this year",
        "When given an opportunity, just like in the 2024 Olympics, he can make a difference",
        "It’s been a long road for Guerschon Yabusele to get back to the NBA, but it has led him to success, with each twist and turn paving the way for him to create memorable performances such as last night’s against Washington"
