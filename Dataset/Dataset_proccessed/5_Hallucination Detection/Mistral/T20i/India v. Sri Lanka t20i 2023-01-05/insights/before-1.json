        "India had luck on their side as they won the first T20I of the series by 2 runs. The top order failed to get going but the middle and lower order steadied the ship and helped the side to a good total. The bowlers then bowled really well and kept picking wickets at regular intervals. The top order will look to do well in this game. India will be eyeing a series win in this match.",
        "Sri Lanka, meanwhile, had a disappointing loss as they gifted away the game. They used the conditions and bowled exceptionally well. Their top order also failed to do well except for Kusal Mendis. Dasun Shanaka was excellent with the bat while Hasaranga also supported him quite well. Sri Lanka will look to win this game and keep the series alive."

        "The pitch at the MCA stadium is overall a good one for batting but it may be a little two-paced in the first innings before the dew comes in. The spinners and bowlers with variations will get something off the deck in the first innings. Batting will be very easy once the dew settles in. The average first innings score here is 153 runs in T20Is and chasing sides have won 2 out of the 3 games played here.",
        "The weather will be clear and there are no chances of rain."
