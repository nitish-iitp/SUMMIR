Phew, time for us to take a breather... but ah, there isn't any here, with the way this World Cup keeps rolling along. Hop over to live action between Pakistan and Bangladesh, who fight it out for one last semi-final slot. Thanks for joining us for this one though, as Raghav, Shashank and me, Himanshu, bid you goodbye!

Anil Panghal: "How lucky is Pakistan here? They just need to beat Bangladesh - who anyway didn't come to win the cup" --- Well played!

Edwards: "Lost for words! It's going to take a bit of time... we are sort of used to those conditions. It's definitely up there - another big upset for Netherlands in a World Cup! We were still playing for a spot in the next World Cup."

Bavuma: "Hard one to swallow. We had the confidence and belief in ourselves as a unit to make the play-offs. Unfortunately for us, we couldn't do it. Winning the toss and bowling, what they got wasn't ideal. We lost wickets at crucial times. They used the dimensions of the field a lot better than we did."

Time for the captains to speak

So this result means Pakistan vs Bangladesh is a virtual knockout. South Africa's entire top six threw away starts, and as much as some late hitting by Ackermann helped, Netherlands' catching proved crucial in the end: Markram was nabbed sharply at short cover to break a stable stand, and Miller was absolutely snaffled out of nowhere by van der Merwe.

Sachin: "Tournament of such small margins .. SA would be thinking about the washout game with ZIM!!"

Colin Ackermann is the Player of the Match: "Feels fantastic, we really deserved this victory! Boys worked really hard. Come in, and take it deep, and the boundaries flowed at the end. Surface was slow, and was taking a bit of turn."

srinivashvarma: "Loved this world cup.. nothing is granted....hosts out , SA out...no one is formidable....just wow ..wat a game"

Shah Zaib: "How well was Edward The Captain? He marshalled his troops brilliantly."

1.48pm History is made: Netherlands beat South Africa for the first time across any format, and could there have been a better occasion? South Africa's NRR falls below Pakistan's, which means they are officially knocked out. What a game of cricket: South Africa's loss ensures India are through to the semi-final, and keeps the door open for Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Four to end, but it doesn't matter! Netherlands win by 13 runs, and upset the whole of South Africa! Short and wide of off, and flung away to deep extra cover

de Leede to Maharaj, OUT

Slashes to deep point! Maharaj hobbling back symbolises the whole of South Africa's pain: they have surrendered from a winning position. A good length ball just outside off, and hacked forcefully after making room. But all he could do was find the fielder, even if getting it all the way beyond would have hardly made a difference

19.2
3nb
de Leede to Rabada, (no ball) 2 runs

A high full toss that is swung down the ground. Long-on rushes to his right to slide and stop that. Maharaj isn't too fit to run for the second but he still does so as it is also an above-waist no-ball

Ahsan: "What are the chances of SA pulling a Carlos Braithwaite here, still not believing it" --- Maharaj, are you listening?

van Beek to Maharaj, no run

Good length ball, angled down leg side. Maharaj had shuffled across off, and so this cannot be wide even if it ended just outside leg

18.4

van Beek to Maharaj, SIX runs

That should be the game! Hear the Netherlands supporters, and watch their flag flutter at the ground. Klaasen finds deep midwicket, and South Africa are pushed further back. Shortish length on middle and off from de Leede, as Klaasen made room, and rode the bounce to try and pull. But there was the longer boundary, as he found the fielder

Heinrich Klaasen c van Beek b de Leede 21 (18b 0x4 1x6 27m) SR: 116.66
