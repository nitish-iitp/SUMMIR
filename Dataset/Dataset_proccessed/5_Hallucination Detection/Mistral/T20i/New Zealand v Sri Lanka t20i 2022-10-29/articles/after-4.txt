'Anyone can beat anyone'

More from Kane Williamson on TMS: "There’s a lot of cricket left so for us it's about focusing on the next game. As we have seen it doesn’t matter who you play, anyone can beat anyone. There’s match-winners throughout.

"It’s very much about focusing on our plans, our skills, and making adjustments. We are looking forward to the next one.... There are match winners in our team throughout, as in other sides, so it's really trying to put performances together."

Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka: "We started really well, especially in the first 10 overs we bowled really well. Glenn Phillips played an outstanding knock but there are areas we can improve, especially in the fielding, we dropped a few catches.

"Chasing 160 is always a tough ask with their bowling attack. Trent Boult and Tim Southee bowled really well so credit to them."

On the chase:"There is a way to chase down big totals and in the first couple of overs we have to give ourselves a chance. We never gone settled, we failed. Wickets fell at regular intervals."

On rest of the tournament:"If we can finish with a couple of wins then we have a chance of qualifying so we're looking forward to those games."

More from Kane Williamson on TMS: "You always see that the run rate is always important. It's interesting, when you come to these tournaments anyone can beat anyone.

"Conditions suit one team more than the other. You have to try and think on your feet. It’s nice we were able to do that today."

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, speaking to Test Match Special: "If we look at today’s performance it was remarkable on a very difficult surface. To see someone like Glenn change the pressure and put it back on the opposition and get a hundred was remarkable.

"One of the best knocks I’ve seen for sure. Conditions change all the time, and you play against different opposition. To be under pressure and be able to get out of that position and put together a good performance off the back of Glenn’s unbelievable knock was a good feeling for sure."

'Exceptional all round'

More from Glenn Phillips on getting cramp:"I really wanted to stop that two, a bit of a silly decision in hindsight and it felt like there was a sniper in the ground. The boys just said to sit off for the rest of it."

On scoring a century at a World Cup: "It's absolutely indescribable. I've really been trying to stick to my process and use that as a form of win for me. I was more happy with my process than anything today.

On the bowlers: "They swung it up front and then the slower balls they bowled with popping and holding. Getting a few wickets early on is crucial when you're defending a total. The bowling, the fielding, we were high energy... it was exceptional all round."

'I try to entertain'

Player of the match, New Zealand's Glenn Phillips: "Me and Daryl [Mitchell] were clear that we wanted to carry on being as positive as possible (at 15-3).

"On a pitch like that it was difficult to hit the slower balls so, for us, it was getting through and getting to a competitive total. At the end, I think we were a little bit ahead of par.

"When it comes to cricket, I try to entertain as much as possible - whether that is for good or bad but thankfully today was on the good end of things. The way the rets of the boys played, the way the bowlers bowled and in the field, it was an incredible effort all round."

It is an absolutely thrashing of the highest order for New Zealand over Sri Lanka. They were in the game at the start but the innings of Glenn Phillips really took it away.

The opening spell of Trent Boult and Tim Southee put them on the back foot from the off. Unfortunately the game was over for the Sri Lankans very early.

Job done for New Zealand. From 15-3 early in their innings, they have fought back brilliantly. Glenn Phillips led the way, making the most of his good luck after being dropped twice, to hit his second T20 international hundred.

That helped the Black Caps to 167-7 and Tim Southee and Trent Boult quickly reduced Sri Lanka to 8-4 in the reply, ensuring they never came close to chasing it down.

In terms of qualification, New Zealand are almost there. A win over England would seal it. Even if they lose one of their last two matches, their net run-rate should be able to get them into the semis now.

Two overs to go, Sri Lanka need one more to get to three figures - these things make a difference psychologically - and New Zealand need one more wicket to wrap this game up.

The beauty of Trent Boult is the variations. You can't quite tell when he bowls that off-speed ball.

He's a Glenn Phillips hundred away from man of the match.
