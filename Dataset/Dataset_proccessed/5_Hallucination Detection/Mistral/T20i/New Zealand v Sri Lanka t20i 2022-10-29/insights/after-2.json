    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Kane Williamson: [what did you think of the match?] Yeah it was interesting, the wicket was different to what we were expecting. It was tennis ball-ey, got stuck on the surface, the cutters were really effective, little bit variable I think - as opposed to the last pitch we were on. So I guess trying to make those sort of adjustments on the same sort of grounds is important, and Sri Lanka were also really good at the top. And then Glenn Phillips and Daryll Mitchell put together a partnership, and it was an incredible knock to get a very very good total on this surface. [On Phillips?] Any hundred is amazing and you see it all the time on good surfaces, and here you see a guy trying to have to work really, really hard to get his team out of trouble. And then to try and move that pressure on to the opposition, and he just did it incredibly well.",
        "Dasun Shanaka: I think we started really well, particularly in the first 10 overs. But credit to Glenn Phillips who played an outstanding knock. We also dropped a few catches. 160 is always a tough ask with their bowling attack, but also Boult and Southee bowled really well up front. [losing so many wickets in the powerplay?] There's a way to chase big totals, and in the first couple of tables you have to give yourself a chance. We never got settled in the wicket."
