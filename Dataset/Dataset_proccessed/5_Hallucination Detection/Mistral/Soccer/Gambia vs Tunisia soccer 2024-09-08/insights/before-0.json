        "Gambia are currently in second place in Group A with one point, while Tunisia lead the group after beating Madagascar at home on matchday one of the competition.",
        "Gambia kicked off their qualification campaign with a 1-1 draw against the Comoros last week, with Musa Barrow scoring the all-important goal on the stroke of halftime to rule out Youssouf M'Changama's opener eight minutes earlier.",
        "Johnny McKinstry will likely be somewhat disappointed that his side only came away from that match with a point, having dominated possession (67%) and registered a total of 13 shots at goal.",
        "Tunisia made a positive start to their AFCON qualification campaign, beating Madagascar 1-0 at Stade Olympique Hammadi-Agrebi on Thursday night.",
        "However, while the Carthage Eagles were by far the dominant side in the contest, managing 65% possession and 17 shots at goal compared to their opponents' seven, Tunisia only managed to secure the victory in the eighth minute of stoppage time through Ferjani Sassi."
