EURO 2024
ENGLAND 0-0 SLOVENIA: ENGLAND TOP EURO 2024 GROUP BUT FAIL TO SCORE IN UNINSPIRING DRAW, SLOVENIA INTO KNOCKOUTS
BYALI IVESON

UPDATED 25/06/2024 AT 21:43 GMT

England topped their Euro 2024 group but failed to inspire in a goalless draw against Slovenia that was frustrating for their fans. Gareth Southgate will be under more scrutiny given that England have scored just two goals in three group games thus far. For Slovenia, it was delight as they secured their passage to the last 16. Despite the draw they are guaranteed a place in the knockouts.

England topped Group C at Euro 2024 after a goalless draw with Slovenia which will do little to quell the question marks shrouding Gareth Southgate's team.
Bukayo Saka had a goal disallowed in a stale first half - after Phil Foden was clearly offside before crossing him the ball - but such openings were rare and it took until the 30th minute for England to even register a shot on goal.

The introduction of Kobbie Mainoo at the interval, in place of Conor Gallagher, did bring a little more speed to England's passing, but they still lacked urgency and could not break down a disciplined and diligent Slovenia team, who knew a point would be enough to take them through to the knockout rounds.

Slovenia dug in for that draw towards the end, rather than pushing for what would have been a first-ever win at a European Championship, making England's task even harder. Substitute Cole Palmer did have a good chance in added time, but shot too close to the goalkeeper.
England's last-16 opponents are yet to be confirmed, with the Netherlands a possibility. England are however now on the opposite side of the draw to Germany, Spain, Portugal and France, so cannot meet any of those sides until the final.

TALKING POINT - NEW MIDFIELD, SAME STALE ENGLAND
Gallagher replaced Trent Alexander-Arnold in England's only change, but it did not have the desired effect. England moved the ball slowly and none of Gallagher, Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham were able to dictate the flow of the game.
That Gallagher was removed at the break for Kobbie Mainoo showed Southgate's displeasure at his latest midfield combination.
Things did pick up, briefly, after Mainoo's arrival. He was busier than Gallagher, gave England a semblance of a spark and may well have played his way into the starting line-up for England's last-16 tie. Yet even the second half left a lot to be desired.
Palmer, like Mainoo, was bright off the bench and may also now be in contention to start a knockout game on Sunday.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - PHIL FODEN (ENGLAND)
Foden's movement was by some margin the most incisive of England's forward players. The debate will rumble on about England's left flank, but Foden demonstrated his value to the team, regardless of what position he's playing.
PLAYER RATINGS
England: Pickford 6, Walker 5, Stones 6, Guehi 6, Trippier 5, Rice 5, Gallagher 4, Saka 4, Bellingham 4, Foden 7, Kane 5. Subs: Mainoo 7, Palmer 6, Alexander-Arnold n/a, Gordon n/a.
Slovenia: Oblak 7, Karnicnik 7, Drkusic 6, Bijol 7, Janza 7, Stojanovic 6, Cerin 6, Elsnik 5, Mlakar 5, Sporar 6, Sesko 6. Subs: Ilicic 5, Celar n/a, Stankovic n/a, Balkovec
Matchcast: Full match stats and commentary
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
CHANCE! 5' - A deep cross from the left is headed back into the England box, where Sesko has a free header, but there is little pace on the ball and Pickford saves quite comfortably.
DISALLOWED GOAL! 31' - Foden makes a darting run from the left and Rice finds him with a first-time pass, but Foden went just too early. He squares for Saka to tap in, but the flag is up and the goal will not count.
SAVE! 35' - Foden strikes a free kick well, arrowing towards the top corner, but Oblak saves without having to dive. Most were expecting a cross given how far out it was but the goalkeeper was not caught out.
SAVE! 90+2' - A good chance for England late on as Kane unselfishly flicks the ball on to Palmer, cutting in from the right and unmarked, but his low shot is too close to Oblak.
