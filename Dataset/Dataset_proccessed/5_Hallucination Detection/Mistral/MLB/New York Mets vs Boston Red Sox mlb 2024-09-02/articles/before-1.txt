Cash this Pete Alonso Prop vs Red Sox 9/2

Get ready for an exciting matchup as the New York Mets take on the Boston Red Sox on September 2, 2024. In this article, we'll discuss player prop predictions for the Mets' star first baseman, Pete Alonso.

Game Summary

The New York Mets (73-64) will host the Boston Red Sox (70-67) at Citi Field in Queens, New York, for the first game of a three-game series. The game is set to begin at 7:10 p.m. EDT on Monday night. The Mets are currently third in the NL East, while the Red Sox sit third in the AL East. This matchup marks the first time these teams will face each other this season.

Recent performances show a stark contrast between the two teams. The Mets have been playing well, boasting a 7-3 record in their last ten games, with a solid .249 batting average and a 3.10 ERA. In contrast, the Red Sox are struggling, going 3-7 in their last ten, with a disappointing .199 batting average and a 3.24 ERA.

Historically, the Mets have had the advantage against the Red Sox in recent matchups, but with both teams fighting for playoff positioning, anything can happen. The Mets' offense has been led by Brandon Nimmo, who has accumulated 18 home runs this season, and Francisco Lindor, who is hitting .302 over the last ten games. Meanwhile, the Red Sox feature Ceddanne Rafaela, with a powerful lineup that includes Jarren Duran, who has also been hot lately.

Weather conditions at Citi Field are expected to be cloudy, with a temperature of 82°F, making for a comfortable evening for baseball.

Player Prop Odds

Here are the current player prop odds for Pete Alonso:

Batter Hits: Over 0.5 (-175)
Batter Home Runs: Over 0.5 (+450)
Batter RBIs: Over 0.5 (+155)
Batter Runs Scored: Over 0.5 (-105)
Batter Singles: Over 0.5 (+110)
Batter Total Bases: Over 1.5 (+145)
Batter Doubles: Over 0.5 (+420)
Player Analysis

Pete Alonso has been a crucial player for the Mets this season. He has a batting average of .254 with 30 home runs and 80 RBIs. Alonso has shown remarkable power and consistency at the plate, making him a key player to watch in this matchup.

Looking at his recent form, Alonso has been hitting well, notching several multi-hit games and consistently reaching base. His ability to drive in runs is evidenced by his impressive RBI total, and he remains a potent threat to hit home runs, especially against pitchers with high WHIP ratios.

Opposing Analysis

On the mound for the Red Sox will be Brayan Bello, who has a 12-6 record with a 4.66 ERA and a 1.37 WHIP. Bello's performance has been shaky at times, making him vulnerable to powerful hitters like Alonso. The Mets' lineup performs well against right-handed pitchers, enhancing Alonso's chances of capitalizing on any mistakes made by Bello.

Boston's bullpen has also struggled recently, providing further opportunities for Alonso to produce runs and hit home runs. With the Mets' offense in good form, Alonso's potential to score and drive in runs is elevated.

Prop Analysis

Among the various prop bets available, the most appealing might be the "Batter Home Runs" at +450, given Alonso's power and current form. Additionally, betting on "Batter RBIs" at +155 could yield excellent returns, especially if Alonso gets opportunities with runners on base.

The "Batter Hits" prop at -175 is also a strong consideration, as Alonso has been consistently getting on base. However, the odds reflect his likelihood of hitting at least once, which is a safer bet compared to the home run prop. The "Batter Total Bases" at +145 also presents value, particularly if Alonso can get multiple hits.

Starting Pitching Summary - New York Mets

The Mets will start Luis Severino, who has a 9-6 record with a 3.96 ERA and a 1.26 WHIP. Severino has been effective in limiting runs and has shown the ability to strike out batters, making him a formidable opponent. His experience and skill will be key in setting the tone for the game against the Red Sox lineup.

Starting Pitching Summary - Boston Red Sox

Brayan Bello will take the mound for the Red Sox. Bello's 4.66 ERA indicates he has had challenges in keeping runs off the board. His WHIP of 1.37 suggests he allows too many baserunners, which can be detrimental against a powerful offense like the Mets. His ability to contain hitters will be crucial for the Red Sox.

Bullpen Summary - New York Mets

The Mets' bullpen has been mostly reliable this season, with depth that allows them to manage leads effectively. They have a solid strikeout rate and can handle pressure situations, which is essential if the game remains close late.

Bullpen Summary - Boston Red Sox

The Red Sox bullpen has shown inconsistency, which could be a decisive factor in this matchup. Relying on their relievers to hold leads has been a concern, making it imperative for Bello to pitch deep into the game to avoid putting too much pressure on the bullpen.

Team Previews

The New York Mets have been able to leverage a potent offense and effective pitching to maintain their position in the playoff hunt. Their batting average of .256 ranks fifth in MLB, and their offensive capabilities have kept them competitive.

In contrast, the Boston Red Sox have struggled with consistency, particularly in their recent games. With a .249 batting average, they sit in a middle tier offensively and need to find ways to produce runs more effectively.
