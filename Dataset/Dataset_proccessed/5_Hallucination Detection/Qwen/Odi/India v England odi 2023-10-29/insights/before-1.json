        "India versus England was among the most anticipated matches of the 2023 ODI World Cup.",
        "With just one win from five games, England are lurking near the bottom of the points table.",
        "India have looked like the most complete team. With five wins in as many matches, they are the only unbeaten team in the tournament.",
        "The key to India's success is how they start. Rohit Sharma has been setting the tone in the powerplay, striking at 134.01, while Jasprit Bumrah has been doing it with the ball, with an eye-popping economy of 2.90 in the first ten overs.",
        "If India win on Sunday, they will regain the top spot and push England further to the brink of elimination.",
        "India are still without Hardik, who is recovering from his ankle injury. And that means going in with just five frontline bowlers once again.",
        "Coming into the World Cup, Mohammed Siraj was among the most lethal ODI bowlers around, having picked up 30 wickets in 14 matches in 2023. He was striking every third over and had an economy of 4.91. But so far in this World Cup, he has looked off-colour. He has only six wickets in five outings, at an economy of 5.90.",
        "Buttler has scored only 95 runs in five innings at this World Cup.",
        "With no left-hand batter in India's top six, there's minimal value in Moeen Ali's offspin. So he is likely to sit out yet again, with Harry Brook replacing him.",
        "England are the only team against whom Kohli has played more than one ODI and averages less than 50 (43.22)."
