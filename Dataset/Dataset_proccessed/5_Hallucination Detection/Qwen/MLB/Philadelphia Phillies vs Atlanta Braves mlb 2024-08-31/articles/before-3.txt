Atlanta Braves vs Philadelphia Phillies Prediction 

Atlanta was able to get the win in game two of this series on Friday night and they are trying to get back into the NL East race. The Braves are 38-33 on the road this year, while the Phillies are 45-25 at home. Philadelphia has one of the best home records in the MLB this season and they are starting Zack Wheeler, who has been fantastic over the last few weeks. The Braves are going with Max Fried, who has been a little inconsistent, but has had two very good starts in a row. I like how the Braves are playing right now, but I am not going against Wheeler. Take the Phillies here.
