        "Christian Bethancourt hit a single up the middle with runners on first and second, and CF Jacob Young overran the ball, allowing the tying tally to come home.",
        "Nico Hoerner dashed home on a groundout to the pitcher by Ian Happ to put the Cubs ahead.",
        "Hoerner singled and stole second base with one out and Bethancourt at bat. The catcher hit a dribbler in front of the plate and was tagged out by backstop Drew Millas. The catcher then noticed Hoerner was caught in no man’s land between second and third but his throw to second was wild and rolled into center, allowing the run to score and make it a 5-3 game."

        "The Cubs went 18-8 in the month of August, digging them out of the hole they were in after a disastrous May and June.",
        "Regardless, it’s fun to see them winning all these games. If Craig Counsell and company want to screw around and win like 20 games in September and crash the playoff party, I certainly wouldn’t object."
