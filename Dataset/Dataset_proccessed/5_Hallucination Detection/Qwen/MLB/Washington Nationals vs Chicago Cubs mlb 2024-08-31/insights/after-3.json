        "The 80 runs are the club's most in an eight-game stretch since 1935, when Chicago crossed home plate 84 times from Sept. 11 to Sept. 18. The only other seasons where the Cubs had at least 80 runs during an eight-game period came in 1929 and 1930, when MLB's run-scoring levels were historically high."
