        "Even if he’s not the guy who ultimately takes the shot, Curry is going to drag defenders around the floor with him and open space for drives in early offense.",
        "You lot are allowed to be upset that one of ‘your guys’ can’t seem to catch a break, but there is no grand conspiracy against Maxey as a player that prevents him from getting calls.",
        "Embiid deserves to be held accountable for his lack of effort in transition defense, but I think that was the only area where you could say his level of ‘want to’ was off of the pace."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Guerschon Yabusele, I will make sure people in Philadelphia remember you. I appreciate the smart back cuts and rebounding effort even as your team is getting pasted.",
        "If there was an obvious fatigue-based excuse to point to here, maybe you could say he could get off with a warning, but his mistakes were mostly errors of execution.",
        "I am going to write a bunch of nice words about Joel Embiid and then use it to make a negative point.",
        "Kyle Lowry being useless in a Sixers recap. I will reiterate for probably the 25th time, I don't blame him for being ineffective as a small guard deep in his 30s. I blame the coach for starting him and relying heavily on him.",
        "Nurse, at his core, is a guy who wants to play simple, free-flowing basketball."

    "Others": [
        "Fans always want blood when things go wrong, specifically the coach’s blood. And I am not someone who calls for it basically ever, as I put coaches low on the general blame list. Not doing it here.",
        "These are just some thoughts that I can’t escape watching the Sixers right now."
