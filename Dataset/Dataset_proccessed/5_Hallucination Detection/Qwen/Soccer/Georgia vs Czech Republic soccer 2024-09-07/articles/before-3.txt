Prediction: 2-2

	

Czech Republic

Georgia and Czech Republic take on each other at Mikheil Meshki Stadium in what is expected to be one of the most interesting games of Saturday’s program. Georgia did well to make it to the EURO 2024 last 16, but star-studded Spain eventually proved to be a big catch for Willy Sagnol’s troops. Midfielder Anzor Mekvabishvili is back from suspension, while the opposition back-line should have Napoli ace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia at bay.

The Czechs, meanwhile, were performing below expectations at the 2024 European Championship, with the team failing to record a win in the group stages. Czech Republic, though, look sharp in front of goal and that is the main reason why we are going to bet on both teams to score. Despite failing to open his goal-scoring account in the new Bundesliga season, Bayer Leverkusen attacker Patrik Schick is widely expected to lead the line for the visiting team. Hoffenheim defender David Jurasek misses out with injury.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (PATRIK SCHICK):

Patrick Schick is a Czech Republic international who plays for Sampdoria as a striker. Schick was born in Prague on January 24, 1996 and he started his career at the youth team of his home-town club Sparta Prague. The 187-cm-tall attacker, played only four games for the capital club before moving to Bohemians 1905 on loan in 2015.

After ending his loan spell with the Klokani, Patrick Schick moved to Italy, signing a deal with Serie A side Sampdoria for a fee of €4 million. The Czech footballer has been playing for La Samp ever since and you should know that he scored 11 goals in 32 appearances for the club in the 2016/2017 Serie A campaign.

The talented striker, who is very good in the air, scored on his debut for Czech Republic in a 6-0 win over Malta in May 2016. Patrick Schick’s preferred foot is left and his contract with Sampdoria should expire on June 30, 2020.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (GEORGIA):

Georgia are yet another former Soviet republic who have been competing as an independent country since 1990. The Georgians had their international debut on May 27, 1990, with the team sharing the spoils with Lithuania in Tbilisi.

Georgia have been struggling in the qualifiers for both FIFA World Cup and the European Championship ever since they played their first qualifying game and they have yet to book their place at the finals of the major tournaments. The Georgian national football team recorded their biggest win on March 30, 1997, with the team hammering Armenia in front of home fans, but they were demolished by Denmark (1-6) eight years later and that is considered the team’s biggest loss.

The Likes of Kakha Kaladze and Shota Arveladze are considered Georgia’s most famous players. Kakha Kaladze played for Georgia from 1996 to 2011, scoring one goal in 83 appearances for the national team. The left-footed defender won two Champions League titles with Serie A giants AC Milan (2003, 2007).
