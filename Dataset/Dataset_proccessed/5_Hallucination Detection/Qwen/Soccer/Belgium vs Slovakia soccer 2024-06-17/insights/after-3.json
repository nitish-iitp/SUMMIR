        "Ivan Schranz scored Slovakia's quickest goal at a major tournament to take his side to a gritty upset 1-0 victory over Belgium.",

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Domenico Tedesco said that the missed chances were a shame but that there was no need to panic for his Belgian side.",
        "Tedesco's side dominated the 90 minutes but lacked a clinical touch, and when they did find it they were denied by the VAR and the scrambling Slovakia defence.",
        "Belgium will feel they should have been 1-0 up by then as Lukaku was foiled from point-blank range by Slovakia goalkeeper Martin Dúbravka after Jérémy Doku's mesmerising run from his own half.",
        "Lukaku's second goal to be disallowed came late in the second half, with VAR adjudging that substitute Loïs Openda played the ball with his hand before crossing the ball into his teammate."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Belgium were without their preferred central defensive pairing of Jan Vertonghen and Arthur Theate, and with left-winger Jérémy Doku playing on the right in the first half and Yannick Carrasco as a left-wing back, there was a lack of balance to the team.",
        "Slovakia had opportunities too. Casteels had to make a superb diving save from Lukás Haraslín's excellent volley, and they showed excellent defensive discipline as every tackle was celebrated by the Slovak players as if they had scored a goal."
