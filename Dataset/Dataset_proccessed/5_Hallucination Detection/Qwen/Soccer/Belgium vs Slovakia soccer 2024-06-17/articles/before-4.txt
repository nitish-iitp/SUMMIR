How Slovakia could line up against Belgium

Slovakia's squad for Euro 2024 is headlined by Milan Skriniar, and the Paris Saint-Germain defender is in line to win his 69th cap for his national side in their campaign opener against Belgium.

Head coach Francesco Calzona is set to line his side up in a 4-3-3 formation, with Juraj Kucka expected to overcome some fitness issues to feature in midfield.

Denis Vavro is nursing a slight thigh problem, but the defender is expected to be in the XI, with the 28-year-old also an important player for Slovakia.

Ondrej Duda is the leading goalscorer in the squad, finding the back of the net on 13 occasions, and he will feature in midfield for the Falcons on Monday.

Ivan Schranz and Lukas Haraslin, meanwhile, are set to operate alongside Robert Bozenik in the final third of the field.

Bozenik has struck seven times in 40 caps for his country, and the 24-year-old is the first-choice operator through the middle for Calzona's side.

Newcastle United's Martin Dubravka is the first-choice goalkeeper and will feature between the sticks, while the most experienced player in the squad, Peter Pekarik, 37, is in line to win his 128th cap.

Slovakia possible starting lineup: Dubravka; Pekarik, Vavro, Skriniar, Hancko; Kucka, Lobotka, Duda; Schranz, Bozenik, Haraslin
