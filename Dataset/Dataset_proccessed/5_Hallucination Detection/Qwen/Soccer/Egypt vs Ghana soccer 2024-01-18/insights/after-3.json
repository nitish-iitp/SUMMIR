        "Ghana was boosted by the return of Kudus, fit again after recovering from a hamstring injury.",

        "Kudus went close again after the break before Egypt had a goal ruled out through VAR for offside and Marmoush drew a save from Richard Ofori.",
        "Egypt kept pushing and Marmoush finally equalized in the 69th after capitalizing on a botched backpass from Iñaki Williams.",
        "Kudus replied two minutes later with a shot that took a slight deflection off a defender to sneak inside the far post.",
        "Another defensive error from Osman Bukari, who had just replaced Williams, allowed Mohamed to equalize three minutes after that."
