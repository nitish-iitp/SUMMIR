FT
Egypt lost Mohamed Salah to injury but twice fought back from behind to draw 2-2 with Ghana at the Africa Cup of Nations.
Thursday’s Group B game at Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny sparked into life on the stroke of half-time when, just 53 seconds after Egypt’s star man Salah had trudged off with an apparent hamstring issue, the seven-time AFCON champions fell behind to Mohamed Kudus’ stunning opener.
The drudgery of the first half made way for a frantic second period, however, with three goals in the space of five minutes and 10 seconds seeing the pendulum swing back and forth.
Inaki Williams’ dreadful pass enabled the excellent Omar Marmoush to restore parity in the 69th minute, only for Kudus to double his tally 101 seconds later.
Yet Ghana were only able to hold onto their lead for another three minutes, with Mostafa Mohamed tucking home from Trezeguet’s cutback to haul Egypt level once more, though the Pharaohs got lucky when Iddrisu Baba headed wide of a gaping goal in stoppage time.

FT
ALL OVER, ALL SQUARE
FULL TIME: EGYPT 2-2 GHANA
It’s all over in this Group B encounter, with the points shared.
97'
MISS
That was the chance!
Baba met the corner, with El Shenawy in no man’s land, but the Ghana substitute sends his header wide of a gaping goal. What a miss!
96'
END TO END!
That’s a good stop by Ofori, who gets down low to stop Ashour’s effort putting Egypt ahead for the first time in the match. Salisu swung a leg at it, and had he made contact, that could easily have gone in!
Ghana race down the other end, with Semenyo looking to find a way through, but a strong tackle puts it out for a corner. One more chance?
95'
HALF-CHANCE
Semenyo does well to engineer some space on the byline and cut back a low cross into the six-yard box, but he just hits it too close to the Egypt goalkeeper.
94'
ONLY HAVE THEMSELEVS TO BLAME
There’s pensive faces on the Ghana bench. As it stands, they could head into their final Group A match against Mozambique in need of a victory to progress to the last 16.
Can they generate one more chance?
91'
SEVEN MINUTES
That’s how much stoppage time we’ll play now. Can either team find a winner?
89'
DOUBLE CHANGE
Some final switches for Ghana, and Abdul Samed’s game is over as he makes way for Owusu.
The other change is a really strange one, as Hughton drags off Bukari – who only came on to replace Williams 16 minutes ago – and puts on Paintsil.

BACK TO 11
Well, I told you it didn’t look too serious. Abdul Samed is back on the pitch, despite having been taken off on a stretcher. Good old AFCON!
84'
NO PENALTY!
Egypt want a spot-kick after Ashour goes down under pressure from Odoi, but there was nothing doing for the referee – and rightly so. The official has had a good game!
82'
THE STRETCHER’S OUT
Abdul Samed goes down with what looks to be a calf problem.
The stretcher comes out for him, and he is duly taken off, albeit the midfielder looked a bit bemused that it had to be used – it didn’t look that serious! But, it's certainly a blow for Ghana as they look to see this one out and claim at least a point.

79'
FIVE MINUTES, TEN SECONDS
That’s the amount of time between Egypt’s first and second goals, with that deflected effort from Kudus wedged between them. What a game this has turned out to be – and we’ve got just over 10 minutes, plus stoppage, left to play.
75'
COOLING BREAK
Right, they’re taking a few minutes to have a drink, so can we catch our breath now?
This match has been flipped on its head by this whirlwind five minutes, during which – as well as the goals – Williams’ poor night came to an end as he was taken off.
74'
EGYPT AGAIN! 2-2!
This is ludicrous!
After such a drab first half, we’ve now had three goals in the space of five minutes, with some more dreadful Ghana defending allowing Mohamed – who has been largely anonymous – to pop up and tuck home from Trezeguet’s cutback. Incredible scenes.

71'
OH MY WORD! GHANA LEAD AGAIN!
Parity didn’t last long – in fact, it was just one minute and 42 seconds – with Kudus restoring Ghana’s lead!
Odoi, who played his part in Egypt’s goal, responded with a great run down the right that resulted in a throw in. It was taken quickly, with Odoi then threading a neat pass into Kudus, whose finish takes a slight deflection that deceives El Shenawy, and it’s 2-1 Ghana!

69'
GOOOOALLLLLL!!! EGYPT SCORE!
What a shocker from Williams!
He’s hardly had a kick today, but he’s just made a calamitous mistake to gift Egypt their equaliser, and it’s that man Marmoush who gets it.
Williams won the ball back in Ghana’s half but bizarrely hit a back pass that neither Ofori or Odoi were alert to. Marmoush reacted quickly, and brilliantly took it around Ghana’s goalkeeper before coolly slotting home.
It’s 1-1!

68'
TREZEGUET ON
A second change for Egypt, and it’s the experienced Trezeguet who comes on in place of Elneny.
