JAKARTA - The manager of the Indonesian national team, Sumardji, said that his party had sent a warning letter to the Bahrain Football Association (BFA). This was done regarding concerns about laser attacks that usually occur at their homes.

The Indonesian national team will visit Bahrain's headquarters in the Third Round of the 2026 World Cup Qualification at the Bahrain National Stadium, Riffa, Thursday, October 10, 2024.

In addition to being aware of the opponent's game, the Indonesian national team must also anticipate non-technical factors, one of which is in the form of laser disturbances from Bahrain supporters.

Concern arose because previously the Japanese national team had complained about the disturbance. When away on September 10, 2024, their players were disturbed by laser light by Bahrain supporters.

In fact, a video went viral on social media showing the face of the Japanese striker, Ayase Ueda, being highlighted by a green laser beam by Bahrain supporters when he was about to execute a penalty.

Therefore, the Indonesian national team manager, Sumardji, admitted that he had spoken to BFA regarding the matter. He said, BFA promised to monitor supporters more strictly so as not to use lasers.

"FA Bahrain is quite responsive in response to this. Yesterday afternoon (October 7, 2024), we spoke with representatives of the Bahrain federation."

"I asked why there was a laser beam to the face of the opposing player, to disturb the Japanese player?" Sumardji said in information quoted on Tuesday, October 8, 2024.

"I said, it was unfair to play and could damage the nation's name. This has caught the attention of Bahrain and hopefully it will not happen again against the Indonesian national team," said Sumardji.
