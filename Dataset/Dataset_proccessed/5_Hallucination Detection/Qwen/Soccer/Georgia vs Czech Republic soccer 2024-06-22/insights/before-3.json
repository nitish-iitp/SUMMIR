        "Ivan Hasek may freshen up his front line in pursuit of victory.",
        "Bayer Leverkusen striker Patrik Schick scored five times at Euro 2020 and is not likely to be dropped.",
        "Jan Kuchta could make way, with Schick's clubmate Adam Hlozek and Slavia Prague forward Mojmir Chytil both in contention to replace him.",
        "23-year-old Pavel Sulc was a surprise starter on Tuesday, and his place may also be in some jeopardy.",
        "After being restricted to a substitute appearance against Portugal, Fiorentina playmaker Antonin Barak would offer a creative presence in midfield, as Hasek will be keen to take the initiative against less fearsome opponents.",
        "Captain Tomas Soucek is again joined by West Ham United teammate Vladimir Coufal in the starting XI - with 70 caps, Soucek is by far the most experienced player in the squad.",
        "Goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek was kept busy in the Czechs' opener, making a number of saves to keep Portugal at bay until the 69th minute; he starts ahead of another man that featured in Leverkusen's stunning 2023-24 season: ex-Manchester United stopper Matej Kovar."
