        "Croatia have just a point so far after following up their defeat by Group B winners Spain with a 2-2 draw against Albania.",
        "Their once parsimonious back line has already been breached five times, and a positive result in Leipzig will require strong defensive foundations.",
        "Italy were also given a fright by Albania in their opening game – conceding inside 23 seconds – before recovering to win 2-1, though the holders had no answer to Spain next time out.",
        "Only one team have successfully defended their EURO crown, yet the minimum expectation for Italy is a knockout place and they have work to do. As do Croatia.",
        "Spalletti is expected to make some changes to his starting XI, but most of all he will have to work on his players' heads as the Azzurri too often appeared frustrated against La Roja.",
        "Facing Croatia with the fear of elimination could be a huge mistake. Italy can certainly play better than they did in Gelsenkirchen."
