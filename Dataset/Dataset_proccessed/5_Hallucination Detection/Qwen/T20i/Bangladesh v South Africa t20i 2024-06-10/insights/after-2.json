        "Jaker Ali was caught by Aiden Markram on the straight boundary trying to hit the six that would win it for them, and so was Mahmudullah.",
        "Mahmudullah couldn’t believe it, and stood his ground a while, waiting for a review that never came.",
        "Taskin Ahmed needed to hit the last ball for six to win. He couldn’t.",
        "Bangladesh chased only 113. South Africa's innings was a wreck. Bangladesh had brought Tanzim Hasan Sakib to bolster their fast bowling, and gave him the first over. Three deliveries in, this was looking like a dubious move. Quinton de Kock carted him for a six over square leg and then a four through long-on.",
        "Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller batted through the next 14 overs together and put on a match-winning 75, largely against Bangladesh’s spinners."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "It was the second-biggest crowd they have had here during the tournament, a little smaller than India’s, but just as loud.",
        "They had a lot to cheer – everything, in fact, except the one thing they wanted."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It was a shame it ended that way. Bangladesh deserved better, especially Towhid Hridoy, who had held everything together with his fine 37.",
        "In this tournament South Africa, who have a reputation for losing games they ought to win, seem to be winning all the ones they ought to lose."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Bangladesh caught out at the last as South Africa win by four runs.",
        "The number of Bangladeshi-Americans living in New York has tripled in the past decade, and now runs to approximately 100,000."

    "Others": [
        "Bangladesh were chasing only 113. South Africa’s innings was a wreck.",
        "Bangladesh had already been robbed of four leg byes that had ricocheted away off Mahmudullah’s pads."
