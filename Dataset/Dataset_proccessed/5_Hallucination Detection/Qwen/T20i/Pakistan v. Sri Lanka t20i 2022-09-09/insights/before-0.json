        "Babar Azam has been having a poor stretch this Asia Cup",
        "Sri Lanka might swap Asitha Fernando, who has been expensive, for one of the younger quick bowlers Matheesha Pathirana or Pramod Madushan; the latter, if he plays, would be making his debut",
        "There is also a chance of Sri Lanka resting Wanindu Hasaranga so as to not give Pakistan a look at him ahead of the final, and bringing in Jeffrey Vandersay",
        "Pakistan may give Naseem a break for Hasan Ali",
        "There is also a chance that Shadab Khan might be rested, with Usman Qadir coming in"

        "Sri Lanka defeated India in their previous match, after also having beaten Afghanistan",
        "Both economies are on the verge of collapse - Sri Lanka's, it might be argued, is collapsing already; both nations are straining under outsized external debt; and both are negotiating with the IMF for relief",
        "Sri Lanka set a Sharjah ground record when they ran down 176 against Afghanistan",
        "Pakistan chasing 182 against India with one ball to spare was perhaps even more impressive, before Sri Lanka also defeated India with one ball to spare soon after",
        "Sri Lanka's batting has only clicked more recently and, even then, almost exclusively while chasing",
        "Pakistan have relied a little more heavily on Mohammad Rizwan, who is one of only two batters with more than 200 runs in the tournament so far, with 212 at an average of 70.66",
        "On the bowling front, Pakistan perhaps have a clear advantage",
        "If Sri Lanka rest Wanindu Hasaranga, they may bring Jeffrey Vandersay in",
        "If Pakistan rest Naseem Shah, they may bring in Hasan Ali",
        "If Pakistan rest Shadab Khan, they may bring in Usman Qadir"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Four innings, 33 runs, a strike rate of 117: Babar Azam, arguably the best batter in the tournament, is having a poor stretch",
        "If you think Babar's stretch is bad, Charith Asalanka has made 0, 1, 8, and 0 so far, eating up 21 balls for those nine runs",
        "Sri Lanka will likely give him one more game to get it right. But the likes of Ashen Bandara, who had done well in that same domestic competition, is breathing down his neck",
        "As usual, the Dubai pitch is expected to favour the team batting second, with dew perhaps forming in the second innings to hamper the bowlers",
        "It will be the same surface as the one used by India and Afghanistan on Thursday and so, as such, will be worn",
        "Sri Lanka have lost 13 and won only eight T20Is against Pakistan",
        "They won the last three in a row, but that was back in 2019"
