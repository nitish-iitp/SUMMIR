        "India have won all seven completed T20Is against Ireland so far",
        "India played two high-profile games at the last T20 World Cup. They won the one where the pitch was tough to bat on and lost the one where it was considerably easier. They will be pleased that the surfaces at this tournament are proving trickier than expected.",
        "Discipline more than strength seems to be the necessary ingredient to win at this T20 World Cup, which has taken a leap into the unknown.",
        "Jasprit Bumrah holding his length back and prioritising being unhittable first",
        "Paul Stirling to respond with calculated risks to maximise the powerplay",
        "Kuldeep Yadav will make the most of his improved air speed by never giving up the stumps",
        "India's bowling contains plenty of variety but it is centered around Bumrah and Kuldeep, players with the kind of talent that can dominate whole tournaments, let alone a single match",
        "Ireland's batting goes down to No. 8 and it has a reasonable split between power-hitters and shock absorbers",
        "Ireland's bowling is seam-dominated but left-arm spinner George Dockrell could get an over or two against the more orthodox batters in the Indian line-up",
        "The weather in New York is perfect for cricket. Not too hot, not too cold, no worry about dew. The pitch and outfield, however, will be under the scanner again after the events from Monday, where 80 for 4 in 16.2 overs played 77 all out. But things can only get better",
        "India played a warm-up game here, on a different track, and they scored 180"
