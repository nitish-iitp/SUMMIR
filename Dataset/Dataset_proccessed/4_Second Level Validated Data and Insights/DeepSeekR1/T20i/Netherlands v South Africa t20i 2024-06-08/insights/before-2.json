        "South Africa's recent victory against Sri Lanka showcased their formidable bowling attack with Anrich Nortje's standout performance of 4 wickets for just 7 runs. Kagiso Rabada and Keshav Maharaj also contributed significantly, each taking two wickets. Despite this strong bowling display, their batting still has room for improvement.",
        "The Netherlands, led by Scott Edwards, have already shown their capabilities by defeating Nepal in their campaign opener. However, they will face a stern test against a confident and determined South African side."
