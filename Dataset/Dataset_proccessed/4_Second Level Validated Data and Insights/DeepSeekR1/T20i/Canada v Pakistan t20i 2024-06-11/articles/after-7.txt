Canada determined to make the best out of their encounter against Pakistan 
With the stage set for a decisive battle between Canada and Pakistan, Aaron Johnson is keen to use the tricky wicket to their advantage.  

Having overcome Ireland by 12 runs to register their maiden win in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, Canada is prepared for a tough challenge ahead when they take on Pakistan at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium on June 11, 2024.

Batting first, Canada set up a 138 runs target for Ireland to chase, thanks to a steady partnership of 75 runs in 63 balls between Nicholas Kirton and Shreyas Movva.

Although the Irish came quite close to breaking the Canadian hearts with Geroge Dockrell (30 runs in 23 balls) and Mark Adair (34 runs in 24 balls) anchoring their innings, breakthrough spells from Jeremy Gordon and Dillon Heyliger restricted them 12 runs short.

Canada hold their nerve to register their first ICC Men's #T20WorldCup win.

Canadian batsman Aaron Johnson shared the significance of the win for the North American nation.

“It's a historic win. It's our first T20 win against a test-playing nation, and this just shows that Canada has a lot to offer to the world of cricket. I'm pretty sure this will drive a lot of investment in Canadian cricket to show that we are here to compete. We are not just here to be a part of the tournament,” stated Johnson in the pre-match conference.

He added, “I think we have to just take it stride and keep moving forward.”

In their encounter on Tuesday, a loss for Pakistan would eliminate them from the tournament, having already dropped points to the USA and India in their opening two games.

It would, however, take Canada one step closer to creating history as they would draw level with the top two teams from Group A, India and USA, at four points.

Canada and Pakistan have only locked horns once, back in 2008, when the South Asian side secured a 35-run win in the T20 Canada.

But with a lacklustre start for Pakistan in this Men’s T20 World Cup, the Canadians will look to capitalize on their poor form.

Johnson said, “I think they (Pakistani players) are very skilled players. Most of these guys have been going around the world playing league cricket, not only international cricket, so their skills are there. But if you're looking for an opportunity, you have to relish these moments. So, I believe the fact that the wicket is playing some tricks, it levels the playing field for us, and we're looking to use that to our advantage.”
