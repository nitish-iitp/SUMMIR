KEY HIGHLIGHTS
Finn Allen was on fire for New Zealand against Pakistan on Wednesday (January 17).
He scored 137 runs from 62 balls.
During the sixth over of the New Zealand innings, Allen smashed Haris Rauf for 27 runs.
The third T20I of the ongoing five-match series between Pakistan and New Zealand was played at the University Oval in Dunedin on Wednesday (January 17). In the must-win game for Pakistan, New Zealand opener Finn Allen had some other plans, and he scored 137 runs from 62 balls to help the Kiwis get the better of Pakistan by 45 runs and win the third match in a row to seal the shortest format series. The right-handed batter smashed five fours and 16 sixes during his stay at the crease to help the Kiwis post 224 runs on the board, which proved for Shaheen Afridi & Co.
During his 137-run knock in one of the happiest hunting grounds for the Black Caps, Allen collected 27 runs from the second over of Haris Rauf. The 24-year-old welcomed Rauf with a six on the first ball of the sixth over of New Zealand’s innings and then scored two back-to-back boundaries on the second and third deliveries. After conceding 14 runs in the first three balls, the right-pacer bowled a wide ball, and then on the fourth and fifth balls, Allen smashed him for two more big sixes before finishing the over by taking a single on the last ball.
The video of Allen smacking Rauf for 27 runs in an over went viral on the internet.
Here’s the video:
Rauf had made a brilliant start in the third T20I by taking a wicket on the second ball of the match and only conceding two runs in the first over. But Allen had other plans for him. In his third over of the match, Allen again went behind Rauf and, with the help of three back-to-back sixes, collected 23 runs.
In the third T20I against the Kiwis, Rauf conceded a total of 60 runs in four overs but was able to pick two wickets as well.
