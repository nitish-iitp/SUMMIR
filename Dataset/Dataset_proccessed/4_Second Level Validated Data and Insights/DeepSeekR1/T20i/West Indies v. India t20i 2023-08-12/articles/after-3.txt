IND vs WI 4th T20 Live Score: Hardik Pandya's 6 courts controversy

In the last match, Indian skipper Hardik Pandya courted a bit of contoversy when he finished off the match with a 6 which denied his teammate Tilak Varma, standing at the non striker's end, a half century. Former South African captain AB de Villiers, however, did not see anything wrong with thatt.

“I am puzzled by the discussion around Tilak Varma missing out on a 50. It isn’t a landmark, in fact other than a century (which is rare), there are no landmarks in T20 cricket. We are far too obsessed with individual achievement within a team sport. I don’t believe 50s should be recorded in individual stats in T20 cricket. If you have made enough runs quickly enough (avg and SR), that is all that matters,” commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted. To this, de Villiers replied, “Thank you thank you thank you. Finally someone says it!”

India vs West Indies 4th T20 Live Score: Brian Lara on Umran Malik

Legendary West Indies batter Brian Lara said that Umran Malik must learn that bowling fat would take him nowhere unless he adds some tricks quickly.

“He will be a sensation, but very quickly he will have to learn that fast bowling really does not trouble the best players in the world,” said Lara on the YouTube channel ‘Wake Up With Sorabh.’

“You have to have the ability to do something with the ball, be sensible, and maybe understand times when you have to trickle back or understand the times when you have to up the tempo. He is very young and has got a lot of years ahead of him,” he added.

IND vs WI 4th T20 Live Score: Iyer, Rahul's World cup chances

With only 54 days left for the World Cup and India beginning to sweat over their squad combination, it is understood that in case KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer don’t make it to the Asia Cup, their chances of making the cut for the World Cup become slim. There are concerns about the game time and form of the two first-choice middle-order batsmen. The hosts are seeking to end their ICC title drought with only the Asia Cup and three ODIs against Australia left before the World Cup.

Since the start of the year, India have not been able to field their full-strength squad as four of their first-choice players – Rahul, Iyer, Jasprit Bumrah and Prasidh Krishna – have been out injured with all having undergone surgery in recent months. (READ MORE)

India vs West Indies 4th T20 Live Score: Chahal in America with World Cup dreams

A glee spread on Yuzvendra Chahal’s face. His arms went skyward in joy. Then it all paused. He snarled in angst and turned back, shaking his head. He had foxed Brandon King in flight and drop, lured him out of the crease, and produced a thin edge, as the umpire would later judge in the third T20I in Providence. But Sanju Samson’s belated reaction cost him a wicket.

At this juncture of his career, every wicket matters, every run not conceded weighs in, every wicket-less outing conspires, as the scramble for winning a slot in the World Cup drifts into the final stretch. It’s a different format alright, the riffs vastly dissimilar to the one that unfolds in 55 days. But it does not matter — everything flows into the World Cup, every failure, every success, every movement would be viewed and judged through the lens of the mega event.

The story would be the same for the double-header in Florida. A T20 game would be played out in front of hysteric expats. The series of course is at stake, with West Indies leading 2-1 nervously. But there is a bigger game unpacking in the background. (READ MORE)

IND vs WI 4th T20 Live Score: Mukesh Kumar's rise

India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said pacer Mukesh Kumar has shown potential to serve India in all three formats and his workload will be managed accordingly.

“Very happy with the way he has progressed; the thought process, the discussion we had with him and his approach towards the game is fabulous.

“You need someone like him to come here on a tour and play against tough opponents on a different wicket which is never easy. But the way he has gone about it and the character he has shown (makes us) extremely happy.

“Going forward, since we know he is capable of playing all three formats, we need to be smart with his workload management. He has played a lot of domestic cricket and got quality skills out there,” Mhambrey said on Friday.

Rovman Powell had gone with the Roston Chase in the previous game in place of the experienced Jason Holder. However, the off-spinner did not have much of an impact on the game.

India vs West Indies 4th T20 Live Score: Gill set to retain his spot

Though the 23-year-old Shubman Gill has been going through a poor patch, he is likely to retain his place in the side. The surfaces in the Caribbean did not suit Gill’s batting so far so the final two games at this venue might be an ideal opportunity for the youngster to make up for it his low scores so far in the series and display his batting prowess.

Amidst the gloom that descended on Providence, with the clouds getting ominously dark and the groundsmen tugging to the ends of the covers, Suryakumar Yadav shone brightly.

If two supreme fielding efforts had nipped his two previous knocks from blossoming, here he was both impregnable and imperious, nullifying the slowness of the wicket with dexterous use of malleable wrists, supreme spatial awareness and a gymnast’s control of his body.(Read more from our senior writer Sandip G)
