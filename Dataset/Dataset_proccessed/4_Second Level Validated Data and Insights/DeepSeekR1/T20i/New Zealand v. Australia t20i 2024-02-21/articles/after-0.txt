New Zealand vs Australia 1st T20 Highlights: Nz vs Aus, Australia's skipper Mitchell Marsh and Tim David led their team beat New Zealand by 6 wickets at the Sky Stadium in Wellington, while playing the first T2O International match in 3-T20 match series on 21 February. 

Chasing a target of 216 runs to win, Australian batters tried to play attacking shots and kept losing their wickets.

However Travis Head (24) and David Warner (32) did gave a good start before being dismissed by Adam Milne and Mitchell Santner.

Following this, skipper Mitchell Marsh (72*) remained on the crease and built small partnership with Glenn Maxwell (25) and Josh Inglis (20). But Tim David (31*) stood till the last with him and led the Australian team to defeat New Zealand by 6 wickets.

Australian skipper Mitchell Marsh was announced as the 'Player of the Match' for his 72 unbeaten runs and one wicket taken in the first innings.

For the Kiwis, Mitchell Santner picked two wickets, while Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne took one each.

Batting first, Kiwis ended the first innings at Wellington on a total of 215/3, their second highest score at this venue. Devon Conway and Finn Allen provided a stellar start to the Kiwi until Allen was dismissed on a score of 36. Conway then stitched together an over 100 run partnership with Rachin Ravindra, placing the Kiwis over the 150 run mark. The final touch to the innings was put by Mark Chapman and Glenn Phillips who helped the Kiwis go past the 200 run mark.

For Australia, Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins picked one wicket each.

Earlier in the day, Mitchell Santner won the toss and decided to bat first at the Sky Stadium in Wellington. The two teams are set to play 3 T20 encounters, the last for both of them before the start of the T20 World Cup later this year.

The Aussies are also in have been in red-hot form after defeating the West Indies 2-1 for the recently concluded T20 series and will be aiming to replicate this form against their neighbours. Moreover, this young Aussie side would be aiming to give David Warner a warm farewell on his last bilateral T20 series. 

New Zealand, on the other hand, won their last T20I series against Pakistan with a 4-1 margin and will be aiming to dominate their opponents in last T20 matches before the World Cup.

The presence of these big names from both sides means that the first T20 between New Zealand and Australia is likely to be a high-scoring affair. The Sky Stadium pitch, while offering something for the bowlers, is likely to be more in favour of the batsmen, meaning a big score would be the likely outcome.

New Zealand and Australia playing XI: 

New Zealand XI: Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wk), Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Mitch Santner (c), Adam Milne, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson

Australia XI: Travis Head, David Warner, Mitchell Marsh (c), Glenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis (wk), Tim David, Matt Short, Pat Cummins, Mitch Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

New Zealand vs Australia Live Score: "I can't wait to tell him what to do," Marsh said of the role reversal.I'm normally filling in for his press conferences when he's had enough, so I'll get him back at some stage." Cricket.com.au quoted Cummins as saying. 

“But I also feel pretty lucky to have somebody like Pat as another leader within our group to fall back on, and the experienced heads we've got that will help me in certain times throughout this series. I just think their experience (Cummins and Starc), certainly at this level and the three of them (with Hazlewood) work together so well." Aussie skipper noted.

"We're lucky to have those guys back. Over the international schedule you don't see those guys play a lot of T20 international cricket together so to have them back and building towards a World Cup is great." Marsh added.

"The crowd got personal (in 2016), but if they have to get personal that's their character. That's upon each individual if they feel like that's what they have to do. If you want to pay your money to come and abuse people, then you have to go back and lay in your own bed."

New Zealand vs Australia Live  Score: Mitchell Marsh praises Travis Head, David Warner 

New Zealand vs Australia Live Score: "You'll have to find out, we'll announce our team at the toss. There will be certain guys that probably bat in different positions than they have done in the past, but ultimately we're here to win the series. I've batted three for the last 18 months, so I'll be there to start with. And obviously Heady and Davey Warner have been amazing for us over the last period of time, so I daresay that will be the top three," Cricket.com.au quoted Marsh as saying.

 "I thought the way we batted was really impressive, in terms of our ability to just keep going. There were moments when we lost early wickets but one of the things I want from us is to make sure we're backing our skill no matter what. That may look ugly at times, but I think we've got a team that bats right down to eight or nine and can really apply pressure with the bat,"

New Zealand vs Australia Live Score: Mitchell Marsh praises NZ's Finn Allen, '

New Zealand vs Australia Live Score: Speaking at the pre-match press conference, Marsh said, "Finn is an outstanding talent. His record over the past 12 months especially at home in New Zealand, he can take the game away from you in that Powerplay. So the onus is on us to try and take a few wickets in the Powerplay and put them on the back foot," M

New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner was also all praises for this young star, noting,  "Someone who can take the game away from you at the start is pretty important. We know that power game he (Allen) has got, and in that last series (against Pakistan) he showed that if he does get going, he can singlehandedly win a game for us. We know on the flip side that Warner, Head, Marsh; all these guys do the same," 

"It's trying to generate the strike rate in the Powerplay. That's the best time to bat, then cash in if you can after that. We think the combo between Conway and Finn is a good one - Conway likes to have a little look then Finn, obviously, doesn't. It's that kind of combo we are banking on for the World Cup, then Kane (Williamson) and guys like that come in after that," Santner said.
