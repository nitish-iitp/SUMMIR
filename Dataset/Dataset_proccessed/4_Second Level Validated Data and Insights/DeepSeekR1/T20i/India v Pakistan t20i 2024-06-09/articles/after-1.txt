India vs Pakistan, T20 World Cup 2024: Ball by ball commentary - As it happened
India Today News Desk
T20 World Cup 2024,UPDATED: Jun 10, 2024 04:05 IST
India vs Pakistan, T20 World Cup 2024, Ball by ball commentary from New York: India defeated Pakistan by 6 runs in a low-scoring thriller in New York. Pakistan are on the brink of an early exit after their second successive defeat.
Rohit Sharma and Babar Azam
01:36 IST:
Right then, end of a fabulous Sunday in the ICC 2024 Men's T20 World Cup as India pull off another classic win against arch-rivals Pakistan in New York and Scotland aboslutely dismantle Oman across the Atlantic in Antigua. That is all from the weekend but it is a new week next up and it begins with a bang as South Africa take on Bangaldesh at this very venue on Monday, 10 June at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT). You can join us much sooner for the build-up as usual but until then, take care and goodbye!
01:33 IST:
The captain of India, Rohit Sharma says that they did not bat well enough and fell 15-20 runs short. Adds that they needed to string partnerships which they did not. Tells that they were aiming for 140 but he is happy that the bowlers came in and did the job. Feels that there was enough in the pitch for the bowlers and it is a good one as compared to the other games. Adds that everyone showed up with the ball. Lauds Jasprit Bumrah for his effort and says that he is a genius with the ball. States the crowd was superb and they did not disappoint. Ends by saying that there is still a long way to go in the tournament and it is important to stay focused.
01:30 IST:
Babar Azam, the captain of Pakistan says that they bowled well after the first 10 overs and would have taken 120 at the start. Adds that with the bat they started well but lost wickets and took a few too many balls to get going. Mentions that the plan was to plan simple cricket, pick up a boundary and get 5-6 runs but they played a few too many dot balls and the pressure got on the tailenders. Reckons that they weren't up to the mark in the Powerplay and made the same mistakes after 10 overs and says that the pitch was a bit slow and much better in general. Ends by saying that they will reflect on these two games and are looking forward to the next two games.
01:28 IST:
Jasprit Bumrah is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his game-changing spell. He says that it feels really good to get the win. Adds that they were little under par and that the wicket got better to bat under the sun. Shares that the key was to keep things simple and tried to focus on the execution. Further says that the ball was coming out of his hand nicely. When asked about the crowd support, he replies that it felt like they were playing in India and the fans supporting them gave them energy on the field. Says that going ahead, it will be important to focus on the present and will try to get as much confidence as they can.

The Presentation ceremony...
01:30 IST:
Earlier in the game, we had a delayed start due to rain and Babar Azam put India into bat. Pakistan started off well and got rid of Virat Kohli before sending back Rohit Sharma as well. Axar Patel and Rishabh Pant played attacking shots and got a few streaky boundaries away as well. Pant in particular was pretty lucky but did get crucial runs. There was a big collpase though in the latter part of the innings as the middle order crumbled and India sluggisghly made their way to 119. The Pakistani pacers were on it in this game as they generally are but it was Mohammad Amir and Naseem Shah who bowled really well. Shaheen Afridi got a wicket and Haris Rauf did the damage at the back end but it was Amir and Naseem who certainly stood out. 
01:24 IST:
Pakistan in general love chaos and a lot of time chaos loves them back, especially after an uncanny loss but this time around, they have let back-to-back games slip out of their grasp. At the halfway mark in the chase Pakistan looked comfortable but they weren't looking to go after the bowlers and just looked to tick along which was a fatal mistake. Babar Azam started on the front foot but was dismissed and then Mohammad Rizwan who was well settled and had started decently, just went into a shell and was even struck multiple times on the gloves. Fakhar Zaman was another one who came in, showed intent, got a couple of hits away but gave away his wicket. Once they lost wickets just before the death overs, the middle order seemed completely under pressure and even the bad balls weren't put away. They are now on the brink of getting dumped out of the competition and even if they win their remaining two games, it might not be enough to save their campaign.
01:17 IST:
Defending just 119 runs, India needed their ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah to step up and he didn't disappoint one bit. Bumrah had read the pitch really well and every over that he bowled kept on turning the tide in India's favor. He finished with 3 for 14 with 15 dot balls and won the game for his side. Apart from him, the likes of Mohammed Siraj, Hardik Pandya and even Axar Patel bowled well at different stages of the game. That sedate over from Axar that was snuck in just after the 15th over did have an impact as well. Siraj bowled brilliantly up top and Pandya got crucial wickets whilst remaining fairly economical. All in all, Rohit Sharma and co didn't lose hope and took full advantage of their opportunities and now go top of their group.
01:21 IST:
A COMEBACK OF EPIC PORPORTIONS AND THE MEN IN BLUE HAVE DONE IT! Absolute elation in the blue corner and heartbreak in the green corner as Pakistan have gone from being firm favorites to being handed their second-successive loss. India meanhwile just kept chipping away with concedings just 4-5 runs in an over and got it to a point from where they could pile on the pressure, and boy, they did it extremely well. Never a dull day when it is a India vs Pakistan clash and even after all the rain and the long wait times, we have witnessed an enthralling contest.

Arshdeep Singh 4-0-31-1
01:09 IST:
19.6: Arshdeep Singh to Naseem Shah, THAT'S IT! INDIA HAVE DONE IT! Arshdeep Singh steams in from over the wicket and nails the yorker, at the stumps, Naseem Shah can only dig it out to long off for just a single. Dejected faces in the Pakistan dugout. Joy and ecstasy are on the faces of Indian players and fans alike. India win by 6 runs!
01:21 IST:
19.5: Arshdeep Singh to Naseem Shah, FOUR! A boundary but it will not be enough for Pakistan. That should do it for India and now, Arshdeep Singh needs to ensure that he does not concede any extras here. Angling away, fuller as well, Naseem Shah slices it in the air towards deep point where Virat Kohli sprints and puts in a dive to his right but the ball evades him.
01:07 IST:
19.4: Arshdeep Singh to Naseem Shah, FOUR! Innovative and effective! Keeps Pakistan in the game does Naseem. Arshdeep goes searching for the yorker but misses his mark slightly, low full toss, on off, Naseem Shah moves to the off side and plays the scoop over short fine leg for a boundary.
01:07 IST:
19.3: Arshdeep Singh to Shaheen Afridi, Leg bye! Nearly sneaked through! A searing yorker from over the wicket, aimed at the toes, Shaheen Afridi fails to get his bat down in time and gets hit on the toes. The ball rolls off his toes and the batters cross over.
01:05 IST:
19.2: Arshdeep Singh to Naseem Shah, Hurls it full and straight, on off, Naseem Shah clears his front leg and drills it along the carpet to long off. Singles won't hurt India.
01:05 IST:
Naseem Shah is the new batter in.
01:04 IST:
19.1: Arshdeep Singh to Imad Wasim, OUT! EDGED AND GONE! Expertly held by Rishabh Pant and India could not have asked for a better start to the final over. Arshdeep slips in a yorker from over the wicket, angling in, at the toes, Imad Wasim gets cramped for room as he looks to jam it out. Gets an inside edge on it but Pant is equal to the task as he dives low to his right to take it. Imad takes the review more in hope than anything. There is a clear spike on the UltraEdge and this is a body blow to Pakistan.
01:04 IST:
What happened there? A lot of confusion and drama out in the middle and eventually, it is a review taken by Imad Wasim for a caught behind decision. It was given OUT onfield quite late and there were a couple of run out chances involved as well but UltraEdge does show that there was an inside edge. Wasim walks back to the hut as well.
01:02 IST:
Right then, 18 needed off the final over. Arshdeep Singh has been handed the ball by Rohit Sharma and will look to defend 17 runs here. Shaheen Afridi walks out to bat will be at the non-striker's end.

18.6: Jasprit Bumrah to Iftikhar Ahmed, OUT! IN THE AIR AND GONE! A bit of miscommunication but Arshdeep Singh did the job in the end! Jasprit Bumrah closes out the over in the best possible fashion. Bumrah misses his mark as he bowls a low full toss, slanting in on the pads, Iftikhar Ahmed misses out again and skies it high in the air towards deep backward square leg. Arshdeep Singh and Suryakumar Yadav converge and none of them makes the call for the catch. However, Arshdeep settles under it and takes it safely.

18.2: Jasprit Bumrah to Iftikhar Ahmed, Clever, very clever! Being able to bowl with such control is tremendous from Bumrah. Slips in a slower bumper, on off, Iftikhar Ahmed hops but he is not sure what to do with it. Drops his wrists and lets the ball go through. The ball passes well below his head and it is dot.
00:57 IST:
18.1: Jasprit Bumrah to Imad Wasim, Starts from over the wicket and takes all the pace off as he goes into the turf, on middle and leg. Imad Wasim hops to keep it out with a straight bat but the ball grips in the surface and catches the outer half of the bat. It rolls wide of backward point and the batters cross for one.

17.6: Mohammed Siraj to Imad Wasim, Yes, he can. Just a single off the last ball. It leaves Pakistan needing 21 runs off the last 2 overs but remember, one of those will be bowled by Jasprit Bumrah.

00:55 IST:
17.5: Mohammed Siraj to Iftikhar Ahmed, Honing in around middle, on a hard length, Iftikhar Ahmed dabs it in the vacant mid-wicket region for a single as Siraj cuts it off. Can Siraj close out the over well here?

17.5: Mohammed Siraj to Iftikhar Ahmed, WIDE! Siraj seems to be trying to be a bit too much and needs to keep it simple. Digs it in short but the line is down leg, Iftikhar Ahmed cleverly gets inside the line of the ball and lets it go for a wide.

00:52 IST:
17.2: Mohammed Siraj to Iftikhar Ahmed, NO BALL! Oh, no! India cannot afford this. Mohammed Siraj has overstepped. Pitches it right up, on middle, Iftikhar Ahmed drives it a bit too straight and it hits the stumps at the bowling end. Free Hit coming up.
00:50 IST:

The keeper, Rishabh Pant runs to his left and takes it safely near the short fine leg region.

Mohammad Rizwan takes a step or two across the off stump and looks to play a cross-batted shot but the ball sneaks through to castle into the stumps. Rizwan looked steaky in the last few overs and now has to depart.
00:34 IST:
Jasprit Bumrah (2-0-9-1) has been brought back into the attack. How Pakistan play his remaining two overs will be crucial here.

This one drifts in late and Usman Khan is caught on the back foot getting hit on the pads as well. There is a big appeal for LBW but the umpire turns it down and eventually, Rohit Sharma does take the review. There's no bat involved as confirmed by UltraEdge but Ball Tracking comes up with three reds and Axar Patel breaks the stand on his very first ball.
00:12 IST:
Drinks break! It has been fairly easy going for Pakistan in their first 10 overs just like it was for India as well. However, the Pakistan bowlers staged a mighty comeback and the Indian bowlers will have to replicate their counter-parts if they are to have a real shot of winning this game. Mohammad Rizwan has been bruised every now and then but has remained solid and Usman Khan is slowly starting to get going as well. Can India stage a comeback and get the big win over their arch-rivals? Let's find out. Axar Patel is brought into the attack now.

Arshdeep Singh will kickstart proceedings with the new ball for India. Let's play...
23:22 IST:
... THE RUN CHASE ...
23:18 IST:
Right then, the Pakistan bowlers have set the game up nicely for them and the onus is now on their batters to take them over the line. It will be nowhere close to being easy on a tricky surface where the odd ball is stopping in the surface. Despite posting only 119 on the board, India are more than in with a shout and they have the resources to make a match out of this. Wickets in the Powerplay will be of utmost importance and the first six overs will be pivotal in deciding the outcome for the Men in Blue. Back in a bit for what should be an interesting chase.
23:16 IST:
Mohammad Amir is in for a chat. He says that the wicket is a bit tricky and it is a decent total on board and they need to bowl well. Adds that his role was to set the tone for the team and hit the right areas and feels he was able to do his job. Reckons that the batting needs to be sensible from them and a lot will depend on how they start.
23:31 IST:
As for India, this has been a collapse of some enormity, losing their last 7 wickets for just 30 runs and they will certainly be disappointed with their batting effort. Having lost the toss, it was always going to be challenging upfront for their openers. Rohit Sharma got an early maximum away before the rain interruption but post the resumption, neither Virat Kohli nor Rohit could have much of an impact. Sent in at number 4, Axar Patel took his chances as did Rishabh Pant to keep the scoreboard ticking. While Axar could not kick on, Pant continued to live off the edge and ticked along nicely. India had a solid platform at the halfway mark, but the departure of Suryakumar Yadav triggered a collapse as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. India's last hope, Hardik Pandya could not do much either, resulting in India posting just 119 on the board, their lowest score against Pakistan in Men's T20 World Cups.
23:30 IST:
A masterful bowling effort from Pakistan to bowl India out for 119. Having won a crucial toss in overcast conditions, the Pakistan pacers have done Babar Azam justice. It was the new ball attack of Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah that set the tone, removing both Indian openers early. Naseem struck again after the Powerplay but despite that, Pakistan failed to stem the flow of runs and were a bit sloppy with the ball. Brought back into the attack to break the flourishing stand, Haris Rauf answered the skipper's call and gave Pakistan an opening. Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir followed it up as the trio kept chipping away at the wickets. They never allowed India to recover and although a bit of complacency did creep in towards the end in the field, they were able to wrap up the innings. Pakistan have bowled India out for the first time in T20Is, enough to tell you what kind of bowling effort this has been.

Arshdeep Singh doesn't have much of a clue and has to just go for it in the end. Babr throws it at the right end and the keeper Mohammad Rizwan whips off the bails with Arshdeep stranded halfway down the track.

The throw from the deep is a bit wide and Shaheen is somewhat lazy to collect it and lets it through his hands. Siraj gets another extra run.

It is well wide and Siraj picks up an extra run.

Pakistan have been unable to keep the pressure on the Indian batters and have allowed them to gain momentum. They will be hoping that this break in play brings about a wicket for them on which they can build.

23:31 IST:
1.2: Naseem Shah to Virat Kohli, Pulls the length back and bowls it on off, Virat Kohli uses his feet and defends it right under his eyeline.
23:31 IST:
1.1: Naseem Shah to Virat Kohli, FOUR! Class written all over it and Virat Kohli is away! Naseem gets a good away shape on this one, full and outside off, Virat Kohli stays balanced in the crease and extends his hands to cream the drive through covers. Despite the damp outfield, the ball has enough legs to reach the fence.
21:30 IST:
Welcome, back! It is time for Take 2 and the mother of all cricketing clashes is back underway and the big positive is that the skies have cleared up a bit more as well. The umpires are back out in the middle and so are the players of Pakistan. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are set to resume their stay with the latter taking strike for the first ball. Naseem Shah will share the new ball with Shaheen Afridi. Let's go...
21:19 IST:
UPDATE - 9.12 pm IST (3.42 pm GMT) - Positive news! As we had hoped, it was just a passing shower, and the umpires are out to inspect the outfield as we speak. The square stays covered for now and the call on taking the covers off will be taken soon by the match officials, who are currently in a discussion with the head of the ground staff. The covers are being peeled off now, and the stumps are being erected. The Pakistan players have come out, and we should not be far away from resumption now. Right then, play will restart at 9.30 pm IST (4 pm GMT) with no overs lost.
21:18 IST:
UPDATE - 8.55 pm IST (3.25 pm GMT) - Uh, oh! Look who's back? Yes, the rain but it seems to be just a passing shower and hopefully, it just is only a passing shower. Just as Naseem Shah was raring to bowl the second over, the heavens opened up again and the players are off the field. Frustrating for everyone on and off the field but it is just that kind of a day. Stay tuned for further updates. A few minutes later, the rain has really picked up now. Another thing to keep in mind is that there is a buffer of 90 minutes before we start losing overs and if this burst of rain persists for a while longer, we will certainly start losing overs.

22:19 IST:
0.6: Shaheen Afridi to Rohit Sharma, A massive shout for LBW but the umpire shakes his head! Shaheen Afridi is extremely confident but Babar Azam, standing at mid off, spots the inside edge and Pakistan do not take the review. This was very full from Shaheen, on middle, a hint of inward shape, Rohit Sharma went for the flick shot and should consider himself lucky that he got an inside edge on it because he was struck right in front of the stumps. An eventful end to the first over of this game.
22:19 IST:
0.5: Shaheen Afridi to Rohit Sharma, Delivers it on the off-stump line and keeps it on a good length, Rohit Sharma gets a good stride in and dabs it square to cover-point.

0.4: Shaheen Afridi to Rohit Sharma, Gets the ball to angle across from over the wicket, on a good length, Rohit Sharma watcfully shoulders arms.
22:19 IST:
0.3: Shaheen Afridi to Rohit Sharma, SIX! WOW! It does not take long for Rohit Sharma to get going! The Indian skipper picked the bones out of that. Shaheen bowls it around middle and leg, on a length, Rohit Sharma picks up the line and length early and plays the pick-up shot to perfection. Clears deep square leg for a biggie.
22:19 IST:
0.2: Shaheen Afridi to Rohit Sharma, Drags the length back and aims it over middle, not much movement, Rohit Sharma hangs back and stabs it down off the deck with a straight bat.
22:18 IST:
0.1: Shaheen Afridi to Rohit Sharma, Rohit Sharma and India are underway! Shaheen Afridi steams in from over the wicket with a slip in place and pitches it right up, on middle and leg, Rohit Sharma brings his wrists into play and clips it through square leg. The ball holds up in the outfield and Rohit comes back for the second run.
20:50 IST:
Done with the pre-match proceedings and it is now time to play! It has been quite a long wait but it is almost always worth the wait. The umpires are out in the middle and so are the players of Pakistan who spread out on the field. The prolific opening duo of skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli walks out to open the innings for India. Shaheen Afridi has the new ball in hand and is raring to go. Just the one slip in place. Let's go...
20:44 IST:
Just a few minutes left for the big clash! One of the ambassadors of this T20 World Cup and one of India's greatest white-ball players ever, Yuvraj Singh walks out and places that coveted trophy on the podium. Next up the officials walks out and behind them are the two sets of players who will line up for their respective national anthems. It is a sea of blue out in the crowd with a tinge of green here and there. It will be the national anthem of Pakistan first followed by the national anthem of India.
20:35 IST:
UPDATE - 8.30 pm IST (3 pm GMT) - The Super Soppers have done their job, and the outfield has dried up nicely. Play is set to start at 8.50 pm IST (3.20 pm GMT), provided there is no more rain. It has brightened up as well, and let's hope that we do not have any more delays. In case you were wondering, no overs have been lost despite the amount of time we have lost.
20:27 IST:
UPDATE - 8.23 pm IST (2.53 pm GMT) - Great news! The rain has stopped, and the covers are coming off. However, it does not look like we will be starting on time, and we will most certainly be having a further delay to this high-octane clash. The hessian has also been removed, which is a good sign. The match officials are seen in a discussion with the chief of the ground staff and will soon have an update regarding the start of play. Stick around for more news.
20:17 IST:
UPDATE - 8.14 pm IST (2.44 pm GMT) - Oh, no! The rain has returned, and the ground staff are quick to put the covers back on. Fingers crossed that the rain subsides soon enough for us to get going at the scheduled start time of 8.30 pm IST (3 pm GMT).
