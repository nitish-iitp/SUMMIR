Dream11 Fantasy XI tips and guide for the 2nd T20I of India’s Tour Of West Indies 2023 between IND vs WI to be played in Guyana.

The first T20I between India and West Indies ended with a thrilling last-over finish. But the hosts held their nerves to pull off a tremendous win over the No. 1 ranked T20I team. It was surely a shocking loss for the Indians, who didn’t expect it.

But now both teams will lock horns in the second game of the five-match series. This match will take place on August 6 (Sunday) at the Providence Stadium in Guyana. India will look to bounce back and level the series, while West Indies have a great chance to take a 2-0 lead.
