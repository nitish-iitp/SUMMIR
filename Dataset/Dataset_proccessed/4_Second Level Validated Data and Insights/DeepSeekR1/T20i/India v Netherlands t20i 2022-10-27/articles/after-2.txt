PREVIEW

India and the Netherlands will play the 23rd match of the T20 World Cup 2022 on Thursday (October 27) at the Sydney Cricket Ground. This will be the second game of the Super-12 stage for both teams. India defeated Pakistan in their first game as they chased the target of 160 runs on the last delivery of the game. Virat Kohli won the Player of the Match award and played one of his best innings in the shortest format of the game. He along with Hardik Pandya scripted one of India’s best wins which the future generations will talk about every time someone mentions chasing a total.

The Netherlands, on the other hand, lost their opening game of the Super-12 stage against Bangladesh by a mere margin of nine runs. They defeated the United Arab Emirates and Namibia in the first round of the tournament to book their place in the Super-12 stage. The bowlers have done a great job for the Dutch team in almost all the matches so far, however, the batters have failed to join the party on numerous occasions. Against the top-class Indian bowling attack, the Dutch batters will have to deliver more than a hundred percent to give the team an edge.
