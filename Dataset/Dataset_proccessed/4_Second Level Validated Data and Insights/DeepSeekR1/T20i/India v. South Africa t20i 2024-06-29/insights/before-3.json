        "South Africa have the weight of history to deal with, India's brightest stars have resolutely reinvented their games because they really wanted to be here. Winning will mean so much to either side",
        "India arrive in the final with seven wins from eight games (one rained out) and in almost all of them, they've been dominant. The only time they were really challenged was three weeks ago, on a treacherous New York pitch after posting 119 against Pakistan. South Africa arrive in the final with eight wins from eight and they've gone through the ringer. Except each time, with the game on the line, and the pressure at a peak, they coped.",
        "For 40 overs - give or take a Super Over - nothing will matter as much as the ball and bat they will be holding in their hands. But after that, whether they win or lose, both India and South Africa should be reminded that they are excellent teams and exceptional people. They should both be able to share their love with family. Toast their time with colleagues. Chase after their children. Enjoy the compassion of their fans. If any of that is contingent on the colour of the medal around their necks, we're doing something really wrong."

        "This is only the seventh T20 World Cup match between India and South Africa. The first four squeeze into a five-year time-frame between 2007 and 2012.",
        "There isn't a lot to separate India and South Africa on bowling metrics: 56 wickets at an average of 15.21 and economy rate of 6.42 vs 59 wickets at an average of 15.23 and economy rate of 5.95",
        "But the batting is a different story. India average 25.80 and strike at 132.13 with six fifty-plus scores. South Africa average 21.90 and strike at 106.14 with three fifty-plus scores",
        "The final will be played on pitch No. 4, which was used for the games between Namibia and Oman, and Scotland and England. It's the fourth pitch of eight on the square, so neither boundary should be significantly longer than the other.",
        "There is a threat of rain over this final but it does have a reserve day."
