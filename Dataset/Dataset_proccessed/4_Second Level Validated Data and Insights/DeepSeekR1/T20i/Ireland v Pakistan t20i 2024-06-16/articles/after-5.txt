Shaheen Afridi shines with ball and bat as Pakistan beat spirited Ireland
Both sides looked to end their campaigns on a high note.

It was only pride at stake as Pakistan faced Ireland in their final group match in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup at Lauderhill - but both sides put in a feisty display.

After some fine fast bowling, Ireland made 106/9 off their 20 overs - despite being 15/4 at one stage.

Pakistan got over the line thanks to the lofted strikes of Shaheen Shah Afridi - who had taken three wickets earlier on.

Pakistan's sole win thus far this tournament was against Canada, and Ireland are still seeking their first victory of the campaign.

Naseem Shah was replaced by Abbas Afridi for Pakistan, while Ireland also made one change, bringing in Ben White for Craig Young.

Scoreboard: Ireland v Pakistan

Toss: Pakistan win toss and elect to bowl

Pakistan edged Ireland by three wickets in a tense cliffhanger in Florida.

Fast bowlers strike first

It was a festival of high quality quick bowling from Pakistan as they demolished the Ireland top order in double-quick time.

Shaheen Shah Afridi removed both Andy Balbirnie and Lorcan Tucker in the first over, and Harry Tector in the third, while Mohammad Amir dismissed captain Paul Stirling, leaving Ireland on 15/4.

But despite wickets falling regularly, Ireland mustered some resistance – notably 31 from Gareth Delany, and then good work from the tailenders, Josh Little (22 not out) and Ben White (5 not out).

Slower pace also had some effect, with Imad Wasim taking 3/8, removing Delany (caught by Shadab Khan), Mark Adair (caught by Afridi), and bowling Barry McCarthy outright.

Batters make heavy weather of run-chase

Little and White had given themselves something to bowl at, but Mohammad Rizwan and Saim Ayub began the response brightly - both ultimately falling for 17, Ayub caught by Tucker off Adair, and Rizwan caught by Adair off McCarthy.

And it was McCarthy who did the damage to the middle order, removing both Usman Khan and Shadab Khan in the space of three balls, after Fakhar Zaman had been caught by the substitute fielder off Curtis Campher.

It meant that after being 52/2 from their first eight overs, they had now fallen to 57/5, and it was 62/6 when Abbas Afridi went for 17, again caught by the sub off White.

Babar Azam steered the ship home with an unbeaten 32, and it was ultimately Shaheen who got the winnings runs, with 13 off just five deliveries.
