        "The washout left Australia and England vulnerable in Group 1 as they relied on their remaining matches to qualify for the semifinals. England's loss to Ireland and the washout against Australia put their qualification chances at risk, while Australia needed big wins in their subsequent matches to stay in contention due to their poor Net Run Rate (NRR)."

        "The shared points from the washout meant all teams in Group 1, including New Zealand, England, Ireland, and Australia, remained in contention for qualification. New Zealand's strong position and high Net Run Rate gave them an edge over the others."
