Stake becomes principal partner of USA Cricket Men’s National Team

USA Cricket, the governing body of cricket in the United States, has announced a sponsorship deal with Stake, a leading online casino platform.

Through this deal, the brand will serve as the title sponsor for the upcoming USA vs Nepal cricket series, the Stake Stars and Summits Trophy, and more broadly as a principal partner of the USA Cricket Men’s National Team.

This collaboration represents yet another key milestone in the development and marketing of cricket in the United States. The Stake Stars and Summits Trophy is planned to begin on October 17, 2024, with three T20Is between Team USA and Team Nepal at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.

These contests under the lights guarantee to bring spectacular cricket action and highlight the emerging skill of American cricket, as the squad looks to build on their success in June’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024.

As the title sponsor, Stake will play an important role in improving the experience for both spectators and players, emphasising their dedication to sports and interacting with various groups.

USA Cricket CEO, Johnathan Atkeison, commented, “We are excited to welcome Stake as our title sponsor for this series and as a principal partner for our Men’s National Team. Together, our goal is to create memorable experiences for our fans, and to elevate the profile of cricket across the nation. There’s no better way to kick it off than these incredible matches!”

The leading online gaming company, Stake is renowned for its dedication to openness, equity, and creativity. Stake.us has a major social gaming presence in the United States, while Stake.com is a real-money gambling site that operates internationally. This partnership will allow Stake to engage with both new and experienced cricket fans, while also helping to expand the sport in America. As part of the agreement, Stake will host fan interaction activities and giveaways throughout the season.

Dom Rae, Sponsorship Manager for Stake, said, “We’re excited to expand our footprint in American cricket by becoming the Principal Partner of the US Men’s National Team. The sport is on a strong upward trajectory and we’re sure the upcoming matches will showcase the incredible talent leading that growth.”

The Stake Stars and Summits Trophy will be followed by the Cricket World Cup League 2 series, which will include USA Cricket, Nepal Cricket, and the Scotland Cricket Team competing in six ODIs for points towards qualification to the next ICC ODI World Cup. The ODI series will be played at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium from October 25 to November 4.

Back in April, the online casino platform also inked a multi-year partnership with Major League Cricket (MLC).
