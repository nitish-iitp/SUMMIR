Scotland v Australia T20: Watch the best bits from Josh Inglis' 100

6 September 2024

Second T20 international, The Grange, Edinburgh

Australia 196-4 (20 overs): Inglis 103, Green 36; B Currie 3-37

Scotland 126 (16.4 overs): McMullen 59; Stoinis 4-23

Scorecard

Josh Inglis' magnificent hundred helped Australia to a comfortable win over Scotland in the second T20 international of their three-match series.

The Leeds-born wicketkeeper smashed seven fours and seven sixes as he reached three figures in just 43 balls, the fastest ever hundred for Australia in men's T20Is.

Having won the toss and opted to bowl, Scotland made early inroads through the returning Brad Currie, who removed Travis Head for a first-ball duck and had Jake Fraser-McGurk well caught on the long-on boundary by Chris Sole.

However, Inglis and Cam Green (36) then added 92 for the third wicket as the momentum swung Australia's way.

Some lusty blows from Tim David saw the visitors finish strongly after Sole and Currie had stemmed the flow of runs slightly.

George Munsey then took 17 from the first over of the chase, but he and Brandon McMullen were the only Scottish batters to reach double figures in a disappointing batting effort.

Wickets fell at regular intervals, as Australia's bowlers extracted bounce and movement from the Grange wicket.

McMullen continues to impress on the international stage and his 59 featured four fours and four sixes, but when he was superbly caught by David on the long-on boundary, Scotland's slim hopes of victory went with him.

Marcus Stoinis was the pick of the visiting attack, taking 4-23 and bowling 13 dot balls in his 3.4 overs.

The sides meet again on Saturday in the final match of the series.

"It's pretty special to be honest," centurion Inglis said post-match. "To hold that record is really nice.

"There was a bit happening [on the pitch] early doors. Me and Greeny spoke about building a partnership. Once the new ball wore off it got easier. I was just looking to play some good shots and show some intent.

"It's a good opportunity for me to get some game time and try cement my spot. There's a lot of good players but to put some performances on the board is pretty key."
