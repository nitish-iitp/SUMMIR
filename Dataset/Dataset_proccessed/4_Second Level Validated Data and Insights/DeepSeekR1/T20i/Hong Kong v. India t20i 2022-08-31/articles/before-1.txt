Asia Cup 2022: India Should Continue 'Short Ball' Ploy In Future After A Success Against Pakistan

Date – Wednesday, August 31, 2022
Time – 07:30 PM IST
Venue – Dubai International Cricket Stadium, Dubai.

IND vs HK Match Preview:

India began their Asia Cup 2022 tournament with a thrilling win over arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2nd match of the tournament. Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja remained the top scorers for the Indian team with 35 runs each, while Hardik Pandya proved to be the difference with his unbeaten 33 runs off 17 balls at the end, guiding team India to a 5-wicket win in the last over. However, India would be hoping for KL Rahul, who was out for a golden duck against Pakistan, to get back his form against a relatively weaker opponent. 

Indian bowlers impressed one and all with their performance against Pakistan, especially Bhuvneshwar Kumar & Hardik Pandya. Bhuvi and Pandya grabbed 4 and 3 wickets respectively, bowling out Pakistan in the last over of the innings. Arshdeep Singh also picked up 2 wickets while Avesh Khan managed 1 wicket in the 2 overs he bowled. 

For Hong Kong, captain Nizakat Khan has been the top scorer for his team in T20Is this year, scoring 249 runs in 8 innings with three fifties to his name. Batter Babar Hayat has scored 217 runs this year with two fifties while striking at 134.78. 

In the bowling department, right-arm offbreak bowler Ehsan Khan has grabbed 18 wickets in 8 matches this year, the highest for a Hong Kong bowler this year. All-rounder Aizaz Khan has picked up 12 wickets in 8 matches this year while Mohammad Ghazanfar has managed 10 wickets this year.
