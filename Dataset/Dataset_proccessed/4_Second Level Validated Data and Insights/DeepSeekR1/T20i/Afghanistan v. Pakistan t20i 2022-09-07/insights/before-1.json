        "Pakistan is set to face Afghanistan in a Super 4 clash at Asia Cup 2022 tomorrow, September 7 (Wednesday). The Boys in Green will be high on confident following their victory over India in the first match of this round-robin stage. Babar Azam's side held their nerve and clinched a five-wicket win against their archrivals in a see-saw battle in Dubai. A victory against the Afghans tomorrow will ensure their berth in the final of the continental tournament. On the other hand, Afghanistan will look to get back to winning ways after their narrow defeat against Sri Lanka in the first match of the Super 4 stage. This contest will be a do-or-die match for Mohammad Nabi's side as a defeat against Pakistan will knock them out of the competition."
