Back to sky blue: India unveil new jersey for T20 World Cup
Back to sky blue: India unveil new jersey for T20 World Cup
BCCI have unveiled Team India’s new look ahead of the T20 World Cup 2022.

September 19, 2022

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), on Sunday, launched the new Indian cricket team jersey for next month’s T20 World Cup 2022 in Australia.

This India new jersey design, deemed as a lighter shade of blue, comprises petals and triangles. Petals are inspired by the BCCI logo, denoting “loyalty and merit whereas triangles represent a perfect blend of fans’ energy, spirit, and power,” MPL Sports, the kit sponsor, said. The three stars above the BCCI logo in the jersey represent the three World Cups India have won in 1983, 2007, and 2011.

The jersey is similar to the one that Team India sported during the inaugural edition of the T20 World Cup 2007, when a young team led by MS Dhoni lifted the trophy.

To every cricket fan out there, this one’s for you.

Team India is expected to don the new jersey for the upcoming tours and ICC events, beginning with the men's team wearing it for the first time in the Australia T20I series starting from September 20, 2022. 

This is the third time that the jersey design has been tweaked since MPL Sports took over as Team India’s kit sponsor in 2020.

India were previously sporting a jersey with darker shade of blue which had a striped pattern of light blue, along with orange design elements.

Team India will be hosting Australia for a three-match T20I series before South Africa travel to India for a limited-overs bilateral series. 

India’s 2022 T20 World Cup campaign begins on October 23 against Pakistan.
