Goodbye for now!

India have secured top spot in their Super Eight group and will now face England in Guyana on Thursday. (It’s worth keeping an eye on the weather forecast for that one, as it’s looking pretty wet.)

As for Australia, they will now have to nervously watch Afghanistan vs Bangladesh in Saint Vincent.

A win for Afghanistan takes them through to the semifinal stage, and they can even qualify by avoiding defeat by a margin of either approximately 20 runs or three overs.

There’s even a scenario where Bangladesh could qualify, but that would take quite the result.

Anyhow, we will have live coverage of that encounter from 20:30 GMT. You can also read all of the build-up here.

For now, from me and Kevin Hand, thanks for joining us for coverage of a brilliant match in Saint Lucia. Goodbye!

More from Rohit Sharma

India’s captain is back for another interview:

“It is quite satisfying, especially when you play like that,” said Sharma. “We know the opposition and the threat they bring with them. But I thought overall as a team we played well.

“Two hundred is a good score. But when you are playing on a ground like this when wind is such a big factor, then anything is possible.”

India will now face England in the semifinals in Guyana on Thursday, but the Indian skipper is confident his team will not change their approach:

“It will be nice for us [to play England],” said Sharma. “But nothing changes for us. We want to focus on what we want to do as a team.”

‘Come on Bangladesh!’

Australia’s skipper Mitchell Marsh has been speaking after the match:

“It’s disappointing,” he said. “We still technically have a chance to go through, but today India got the better of us.

“Over the course of 40 overs, there are a lot of small margins. But ultimately, India were the better team. Rohit Sharma got them off to an absolute flyer … we have got to give some credit to him.”

Marsh’s final message was one of support for Bangladesh, who can do Australia a favour by beating Afghanistan in the final match of the Super Eights:

“Come on Bangladesh!”

Rohit Sharma named player of the match

After scoring 92 off 41 balls, India’s captain is rightly awarded the player of the match award.

He’s been speaking about his innings: “That’s what I have to do at the top of the order, I need to try and see what the bowlers are trying to do and play accordingly.”

He also touched on the conditions at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium: “I think you have to factor in the breeze but you have to understand that the bowlers are smart and they won’t bowl into the breeze a lot, so you have to open up all sides of the field and not be one-dimensional.”

We’ll hear more from him shortly during the captain’s interviews.

Handshakes all round

There’s a lot of respect between these two sides given their recent history.

India had the upper hand today and can thank their captain – Rohit Sharma – for setting the tone.

His brilliant innings was the platform that this win was built on.

Jadeja drops Cummins

Cummins went for another big one over mid-wicket, but it pulled up short and into the path of Jadeja.

But the chance is put down by the fielder!

It will make little difference for India.

Cummins smashes a six

The wind aids Cummins as he smashes a six over midwicket.

It’s too little too late, but Australia are almost at the 176 target which means Afghanistan have to beat Bangladesh.
