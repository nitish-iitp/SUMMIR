India will take on Afghanistan in their first Super 8 contest of the 2024 T20 World Cup in Barbados on Thursday. The Men in Blue finished Group A as table toppers with seven points from four matches. This included three wins and one washout (Against Canada in Florida).

Afghanistan, meanwhile, beat thumped Uganda by 125 runs before stunning New Zealand by 84 runs in their second match. The Rashid Khan-led side carried on their clinical display into the third match against Papua New Guinea, whom they beat by seven wickets. Afghanistan, however, suffered a 106-run defeat to West Indies in their final group stage match, failing to chase down a target of 219. However, the Asian side had already booked their place in the Super 8 stage, so that defeat did not impact them in a major way.

But having said that, India will pose a different challenge for Afghanistan. Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav will be key to India’s chances with the bat should the Men in Blue suffer another top-order collapse. Pant, however, did not take part in India’s optional training session on Tuesday.

Virat Kohli, who has scored just five runs from three matches this tournament, has opened every game so far along with Rohit Sharma, and the question remains if the team management will pick Yashasvi Jaiswal to open, which will mean Kohli revert back to his No 3 spot. Jaiswal’s only match in West Indies was a T20I at the Providence Stadium in Guyana in August 2023.

The focus will also be on spinners as the action shifts to the Caribbean completely, following the end of USA leg. Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal have not played a game and it will be interesting to see who makes the cut in the playing XI among the two.

Afghanistan cannot be taken lightly. They have match-winners in Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Gulbadin Naib and boast of a quality spin attack of Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Mohammad Nabi.

Let’s now take a look at all you need to know about India vs Afghanistan as far as live streaming is concerned:
