T20 World Cup 2024 Group A Points Table Updated after CAN vs IRE: Pakistan slips below Canada to fourth; India second

Canada registed its first-ever T20 World Cup win when it beat Ireland by 12 runs in its Group A match of the 2024 edition at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on Friday.

JUNE 07, 2024 23:23
C
Ireland 125/7 in 20 overs

Ireland needs 17 runs to win off the last over. Gordon has the ball. Short and Adair goes for the pull and misses. Dot ball. 17 needed off five balls. OUT! High in the air as Adair ends up slicing this and Gordon takes this skier off his own bowling. Ireland needs 17 off 4 balls now. 

Barry McCarthy comes in and gets a couple of runs at square-leg. 15 needed from 3 balls. Swing and a miss from McCarthy and a dot ball. 15 needed from two balls now. Another swing and miss from McCarthy and he scampers through for a bye. Still, 14 needed from one ball. A single at deep midwicket for Dockrell and Canada has registered its first win in the T20 World Cup. 

JUNE 07, 2024 23:17
4
Ireland 121/6 in 19 overs

Ireland needs 28 runs from 12 balls. Sana starts off with a full toss and Adair can only put it away for a single. Driven down the ground by Dockrell for one more. Canada won’t mind that. Ireland needs 26 to win from 10 balls. FOUR! Full toss wide outside off and takes Adair’s outside edge and runs away past the short third-man fielder for a boundary. The batter wants that to be called a no-ball for height but the umpire is not convinced. 

Sana now comes over the wicket. Dot ball. Adair is cramped for room as he looks to drive this. FOUR! Down leg-side and Adair seems to have got some bat on that as the ball runs away to the boundary past the keeper. Low full toss and Adair can only flick it to short fine-leg for a single. 

JUNE 07, 2024 23:14
4
Ireland 110/6 in 18 overs

Ireland needs 36 runs from 18 balls. Heyliger bowls out. Dot ball to start with as Dockrell backs away outside leg and can’t reach out to make connection with this outside off-stump delivery. FOUR! Hammered towards mid-off by Dockrell, falls just short of the fielder and runs away to the boundary. Pushed to mid-off by Dockrell for a quick single now. Adair looks to slash this on the off-side but the extra bounce means he misses it. Slashed away through the gap between cover and mid-off and Adair will come back for a third run. Dot ball to end the over. 

JUNE 07, 2024 23:08
6
Ireland 102/6 in 17 overs

Sana comes back. A couple of singles to start the over. FOUR! Adair shuffles across slightly and flicks this over the circle and finds the boundary at square-leg. Full toss and hacked away by Adair through midwicket for two more. SIX! Swung away over deep fine-leg by Adair and that’s a maximum. 

JUNE 07, 2024 23:04
6
Ireland 88/6 in 16 overs

Siddiqui will bowl out. FOUR! Pulled away by Dockrell and he finds the midwicket boundary. Much-needed for Ireland but it will need many more of these. SIX! Dockrell on the charge. He clears the long-on boundary and gets a maximum. A couple more to end the over. Great stop by Sana in the deep. 

JUNE 07, 2024 23:01
Ireland 74/6 in 15 overs

Heyliger again. Just five runs off it. Dockrell and Adair are playing their shots but cannot really find their timing. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:57
Ireland 69/6 in 14 overs

Saad Zafar will bowl out. Continues to bowl a tight line on the stumps. Adair collects a couple of lucky twos, off the outside and inside edges. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:51
C
Ireland 62/6 in 13 overs

OUT! Thick outside edge and Heyliger has another wicket as Delaney nicks behind. Mark Adair is the new man in. The required rate is almost touching 11 now. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:50
Ireland 57/5 in 12 overs

Another economical over from the skipper Saad. Just four runs from it and Ireland is really struggling now. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:44
C
Ireland 53/5 in 11 overs

OUT! What a catch! Campher goes for the pull and Johnson takes an excellent catch at deep square-leg to leave Ireland five down. 

Curtis Campher c Johnson b Dilon Heyliger 4 (7b)

JUNE 07, 2024 22:33
RO
Ireland 50/4 in 10 overs

Saad Zafar continues. Loud appeal for a catch as Tucker goes for the reverse-sweep and the ball plops to the slip fielder. Huge appeal, not given and Canada reviews. But there is not bat or glove on it, and the ball is also missing off-stump, so no question of lbw either. Tucker survives. 

OUT! And Tucker is run out off the last ball of the over. The running between the wickets has been very poor from Ireland today and something had to give. He cuts to point and hares off for a single but is well short of his ground at the bowler’s end. Ireland in deep trouble. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:31
Ireland 46/3 in 9 overs

Siddiqui continues. Another tight over of spin bowling and the Irish batters are struggling to put the ball away. Just three runs from the over. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:27
B
Ireland 43/3 in 8 overs

Skipper Saad Zafar comes on to bowl and strikes in his first over. OUT! A classical delivery that spins away from the right-hander and Tector is clean bowled. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:19
C
Ireland 36/2 in 7 overs

Whipped away on the leg-side by Tucker for a single as Siddiqui continues. OUT! Balbirnie chips this back to the bowler and Canada has another wicket. Harry Tector is in next. He is off the mark with a tight single. Had the mid-off fielder picked it up and thrown it cleanly, that has gone for all money. Just five runs from the over and the wicket. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:13
C
Ireland 31/1 in 6 overs

Gordon will continue. Carved behind point by Balbirnie for a single. Stirling goes for a big heave on leg-side but misses. He now looks to cuts this uppishly but makes no connection again. OUT! And he goes. Goes for a hack across the line again but gets a top edge and taken by the keeper. In comes Lorcan Tucker. Clipped off the legs to mid-on and he is off the mark with a quick single. FOUR! Sliding down leg-side and clipped away to the boundary by Balbirnie. 

Paul Stirling c Shreyas Movva b Jeremy Gordon 9 (17b 1x4)

JUNE 07, 2024 22:10
Ireland 25/0 in 5 overs

Leg-spinner Junaid Siddiqui into the attack. Balbirnie starts off with a sweep but straight to short fine-leg. Swept again but Balbirnie only gets a bottom edge on it and collects a couple at fine-leg. Balbirnie gets low to sweep again and collects another two at fine-leg. Pushed down the ground by Balbirnie for a single. Stirling steps out and drives this straight to mid-off to end the over with a dot ball. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:06
Ireland 20/0 in 4 overs

Gordon will continue. Pushed through the off-side by Stirling for a single. Short and wide outside off but Balbirnie gets a bottom edge to the keeper trying to flay this on off-side. Pulled away through midwicket by Balbirnie for a couple. He defends the next one back to the bowler with the splice of the bat. Carved to deep third by Balbirnie for a single. 

JUNE 07, 2024 22:01
Ireland 16/0 in 3 overs

Sana again, from around the wicket. Starts off with a couple of dot balls to Stirling. Four dot balls in a row as Stirling cuts this but the point fielder intercepts it. Driven past mid-off by Stirling and he will come back for the third. Stirling is beaten trying to go for an expansive drive off the last ball of the over. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:58
Ireland 13/0 in 2 overs

Jeremy Gordon from the other end. Just three runs from the over as Gordon gets his lines and lengths right. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:58
4
Ireland 10/0 in 1 over

Andy Balbirnie and Paul Stirling will begin the chase for Ireland. Kaleem Sana with the ball. Three wides outside off-stump and a boundary for Stirling to end the over. Ten runs from it and Ireland is off to a flyer. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:35
RO
CAN 137/6 in 20 overs

Adair to bowl the last over. Two singles to begin the over. Just inside the tram-line outside off and not called a wide. FOUR! Slashed over cover and infield and Movva gets a crucial boundary off the fourth ball. Chipped over mid-off next ball by Movva for two more. Chipped to long-off and Movva will only complete a single. 

Shreyas Movva run out (Barry McCarthy/Lorcan Tucker) 37 (36b 3x4)

JUNE 07, 2024 21:29
C
CAN 128/6 in 19 overs

McCarthy bowls out. Kirton slashes the first ball to deep point for just a single. Sliced to point by Movva for one more. Back of a length, angling away, keeps low and beats Kirton. OUT! Kirton is undone by a bouncer, and he gloves this high in the air. A bit of a confusion between the wicketkeeper and the fielder who runs in to take the catch at short fine-leg. OUT! A couple of balls later, Dilon Heyliger is caught at long-on and McCarthy has two in the over. 

Dilon Heyliger c Josh Little b Barry McCarthy 0 (2b)

Nicholas Kirton c Andy Balbirnie b Barry McCarthy 49 (35b 3x4 2x6)

JUNE 07, 2024 21:24
CAN 126/4 in 18 overs

Adair comes back. Movva starts off with a single after driving this straight to mid-off. Guided to short third for one more by Kirton. Short, and Movva slashes this over cover-point for two more. Bouncer and called wide for height. Movva goes for the reverse-scoop but doesn’t really connect and steals a quick single. Yorker and dug out by Kirton for one more. Movva shuffles across now and wants to scoop this behind the keeper but misses again. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:19
4
CAN 119/4 in 17 overs

Little bowls out. Drilled down the ground by Movva for a single. FOUR! Kirton is on a roll here. This is slashed over cover-point and finds the boundary. Flicked through midwicket for two more by Kirton next ball. Bouncer and Kirton ducks under it. Two singles to end the over but nine from it. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:14
6
CAN 110/4 in 16 overs

SIX! Yorker length but Kirton does well to hammer this down the ground for a maximum. FOUR! Down leg-stump and clipped off the pads by Kirton for a boundary behind the keeper. Flicked again for a single by Kirton through leg-side. That’s the 50-run partnership off 44 balls. SIX! Another maximum to end the over. Kirton makes room and clears the long-off boundary with a lofted drive. 18 runs from the over. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:13
CAN 92/4 in 15 overs

McCarthy bowls his third over. Keeps it back of a length largely and induces some plays and misses. Just two runs from the over. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:09
CAN 90/4 in 14 overs

Third over for Little. Eight runs from it as both batters look to shift gears with some intent behind their shots and good running between the wickets. 

JUNE 07, 2024 21:00
4
CAN 82/4 in 13 overs

Young comes back for his third over. Movva defends the first ball back to the bowler. Movva swings and looks to heave this on leg-side but misses. FOUR! Full and Movva lifts this over midwicket with one-hand to find the boundary. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:55
CAN 74/4 in 12 overs

Campher again. Punched away to deep point by Kirton for a single. Off the outside half of Movva’s bat to deep third for a single. Kirton cops a blow on his body as Campher gets this to jag in and bounce a bit extra. Campher goes for the bouncer now but called wide for height. A couple of singles to end the over. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:54
CAN 69/4 in 11 overs

Delany will continue. Six runs from it and Canada is inching towards becoming the first team to breach the 100-run mark at this venue. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:45
CAN 63/4 in 10 overs

Here comes Curtis Campher. Kirton starts off by flicking one off his pads for a single. Run out attempt as Movva guides this to point and takes off for a single. However, it was stopped at point and the fielder takes a shy at the stumps and hits. Movva is well inside the crease though. Now an outside edge for Movva and he will take two more at deep third. Jabbed to deep square-leg by Movva for one more. Two more for Kirton at deep fine-leg to end the over as Campher strays on leg-stump. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:40
C
CAN 57/4 in 9 overs

Gerath Delany into the attack. OUT! He strikes first ball as Bajwa ends up getting a leading edge and Delany takes a good one-handed return catch. Shreyas Movva is the next man in. He is off the mark with a single. Misfield at cover and that allows Kirton to take a single off the last ball of the over. 

Dilpreet Bajwa c & b Gerath Delany 7 (9b 1x4)

JUNE 07, 2024 20:35
4
CAN 53/3 in 8 overs

McCarthy again. Pulled away by Bajwa and falls short of the fine-leg fielder; just a single. Good yorker and dug away to mid-off by Kirton for a single. FOUR! Cracking shot by Bajwa. Lifted straight over the bowler’s head for a boundary. Dabbed to deep third by Bajwa now for one more. FOUR! Kirton swivels and pulls this to the fine-leg boundary. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:30
C
CAN 42/3 in 7 overs

Young will continue. A quick single to start the over. A single for Bajwa behind point. This is dabbed to the point fielder by Pargat for a dot ball. Pargat steps out and lofts this over cover for a couple of runs. Bouncer from Young but it’s too high and called wide. 

OUT! Pargat looks to aerial after stepping out but ends up slicing this to the third man fielder. In comes Nicholas Kirton. He shoulders arms to the first ball he faces. 

Pargat Singh c Josh Little b Craig Young 18 (14b 2x4)

JUNE 07, 2024 20:26
4
CAN 37/2 in 6 overs

Barry McCarthy into the attack. FOUR! Cut away behind point by Pargat and he finds the boundary. FOUR! Drifted onto leg-stump and flicked away by Pargat for another boundary at fine-leg. Dabbed behind point this time for a single by Pargat. Down leg-side again, Bajwa misses the flick and the ball goes through to the keeper after brushing his pad. Three dot balls in a row to end the over. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:21
C
CAN 28/2 in 5 overs

Craig Young into the attack. Low full toss and whipped away through leg-side by Pargat for a single. A couple of dot balls to follow as Johnson defends on the off-side and is unable to squeeze in a single. Now defended back to the bowler by Johnson for a third consecutive dot ball. Pushed to point by Johnson to make it four dot balls in a row. OUT! The pressure was building with all those dot balls and Johnson is caught at deep square-leg as he swivels and flicks this. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:16
4
CAN 27/1 in 4 overs

Going down leg-side again and another wide ball. Sliced dangerously by Pargat over point, just out of reach of the fielder, but the ball plugs into the slow outfield and the batters collect three runs. 

FOUR! Inside edge off Johnson’s bat, and it beats the short fine-leg fielder to run away to the boundary. FOUR! Consecutive boundaries for Johnson and this came off the middle of the bat. Lofted over cover with ease. Full and on the pads and flicked for one more by Johnson. 

Little will continue. Too straight and Pargat whips this behind to short fine-leg. He wants a single but Johnson doesn’t. A bit of confusion between the batters in the middle. A single at deep third for Pargat next ball. 

JUNE 07, 2024 20:10
C
CAN 13/1 in 3 overs

Pargat Singh is in next. He is off the mark with a pull to fine-leg for a single. Jags away from a good length to beat Johnson’s outside edge. 

Adair will continue. OUT! Back-of-a-length and Dhaliwal was looking to cut this over point and ends up carving this to the fielder. 

Navneet Dhaliwal c George Dockrell b Mark Adair 6 (10b 1x4)

JUNE 07, 2024 20:06
4
CAN 12/0 in 2 overs

Here comes Josh Little. Angling away, skids through and stays low to beat Dhaliwal. There is a huge noise as the ball goes through to the keeper. Little thinks there was an outside edge but the umpire shakes his head. Stirling doesn’t review. The ball spat up a bit from a good length and yet again some uneven bounce here. Going down leg-side and called wide. 

Unlucky for Ireland! Replays suggest Dhaliwal had gloved that one to the keeper. Stirling will be kicking himself for not reviewing that one. 

FOUR! Drifted on the pads and flicked away with ease to the fine-leg boundary by Dhaliwal. Driven to mid-off for a single by Dhaliwal off the last ball. 

JUNE 07, 2024 19:59
4
CAN 6/0 in 1 over

Short of a length and this jags away a bit from Johnson, who lets the ball go. FOUR! Short and pulled away to the fine-leg boundary by Johnson. This is slightly fuller and straighter, and a bit of extra bounce has Johnson defending back to the bowler. Too straight again and put away on leg-side by Johnson for a single. Down leg-side again and the ball brushes Dhaliwal’s pads and goes to the keeper’s left. Flicked to short fine-leg for a single by Dhaliwal to end the over. 

Mark Adair will take the new ball. Aaron Johnson and Navneet Dhaliwal are the openers for Canada. 

We are all set to start. A lot of the focus will be on the pitch, obviousy. Remember, India and Pakistan will face off here on June 09, two days from now. 

JUNE 07, 2024 19:54
National anthems

Time for the anthems as both teams make their way to the ground. Ireland’s anthem is up first, followed by Canada’s. 

JUNE 07, 2024 19:48
All you need to know about drop-in pitches in New York
Explained: What is a drop-in pitch being used at T20 World Cup 2024?

The venue that will host India’s group league fixtures - including the big one against Pakistan on June 9 - has so far seen low-scoring games, with Sri Lanka bundling out for 77 in its opener against South Africa. All you need to know about drop-in pitches.

JUNE 07, 2024 19:45
What’s in store in New York?

The conditions here haven’t suited batting one bit. In two games so far, the 100-run marked has not yet been breached. Sri Lanka was bowled out for 77 runs, and South Africa huffed and puffed to chase them down in 16.2 overs. Ireland then was bowled out for 96 against India, and the Men in Blue took a few hits on the body due to uneven bounce even though they chased the target comfortably inside 13 overs.

ICC statement on the New York pitch
T20 World Cup 2024: ICC releases statement on New York pitch after low-scoring matches

The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday issued a statement over the criticism of the drop-in pitch at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York.

JUNE 07, 2024 19:38
Canada Playing XI

Aaron Johnson, Navneet Dhaliwal, Pargat Singh, Nicholas Kirton, Shreyas Movva (wk), Dilpreet Bajwa, Saad Bin Zafar (c), Dillon Heyliger, Kaleem Sana, Junaid Siddiqui, Jeremy Gordon. 

JUNE 07, 2024 19:37
Ireland Playing XI

Andrew Balbirnie, Paul Stirling (c), Lorcan Tucker (wk), Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, George Dockrell, Gareth Delany, Mark Adair, Barry McCarthy, Joshua Little, Craig Young. 

JUNE 07, 2024 19:33
TOSS

Blazing sunshine at toss time, says Ravi Shastri. 

Ireland wins the toss and elects to bowl. Paul Stirling says the leg-spinner Ben White sits out and a seamer comes in. For Canada, off-spinner Nikhil Dutta goes out and leg-spin all-rounder Junaid Siddiqui comes in. 

JUNE 07, 2024 19:32
PITCH REPORT

There was heavy rain overnight so the pitch could be even more sluggish. The square boundaries are skewed, with one 62 metres long and the other 73 metres. A lot of grass has been taken off and the pitch looks much whiter, says Dale Steyn. Could finally be better batting conditions on this pitch, which has come under intense scrutiny of late. 

JUNE 07, 2024 19:10
Canada Predicted XI

Aaron Johnson, Navneet Dhaliwal, Pargat Singh, Nicholas Kirton, Shreyas Movva (wk), Dilpreet Bajwa, Dilon Heyliger, Saad Bin Zafar (c), Kaleem Sana, Jeremy Gordon, Rishiv Joshi/Nikhil Dutta.
