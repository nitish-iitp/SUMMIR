        "The Men in Blue have looked in sublime form in the T20 World Cup 2024. Rohit Sharma and Co have managed to win both their games so far and will be hoping to extend the streak when they lock horns with co-hosts USA next in New York.",
        "USA, on the other hand, has surprised everyone with their performance. They are currently placed second in the group standings just after India on the same points. USA shocked the world when they managed to defeat Pakistan after having won against neighbours Canada in the tournament opener. They will definitely fancy their chances of making history and securing a qualification into the Super 8s stage."

However, in the last few matches, it has gotten a tad better but there’s still a lot on offer for the bowlers and scoring will be difficult.",
        "The match will take place during daytime (local time) and the maximum temperature is expected to be around 25°C with no serious threat of rain."
