        "This was the first cricket match between India and USA across any format.Aaron Jones is currently this T20 World Cup's second-highest scorer.Jasprit Bumrah has an average of four and an economy rate of 2.85 after picking up five wickets for 20 runs in seven overs this tournament.The New York surface has settled enough that the scary up-and-down bounce seen earlier in the competition seems to be a thing of the past.The game is unlikely to be upset by the weather, but it may once again be low-scoring."
