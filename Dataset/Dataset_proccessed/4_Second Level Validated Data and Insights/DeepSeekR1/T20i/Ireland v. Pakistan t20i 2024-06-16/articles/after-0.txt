Shaheen Shah Afridi took Pakistan over the line with a couple of sixes in the 19th over as the Green Shirts closed their T20 World Cup run with a three-wicket win. Afridi was declared the Player of the Match for his crucial 13-run addition at the end and his 22-3 in the four overs earlier in the match.

After hitting a couple of boundaries, Abbas Afridi failed to clear the fence and got caught in the deep in the 18th over. Imad Wasim fell victim to the Irish onslaught of Pakistani batters in the 12th over. Barry McCarthy was the pick of the bowlers for Ireland with his impressive 15-3 figures.

Usman Khan and Shadab Khan followed suit as Pakistan were five wickets down at the halfway mark with 57 on the board. Barry McCarthy got both batsmen out in his third over, putting the brakes on the run chase.

Fakhar Zaman tried to go for the big shot as he got caught at mid-off on the first ball of the ninth over. Green Shirts lost their third wicket at 52.

Mohammad Rizwan got caught off his signature shot in the deep after trying it a couple of times. Pakistan lost their second wicket in the sixth over with 40-2 at the end of the powerplay.

Saim Ayub got beaten for pace as he was caught behind off a leading edge. Pakistan lost their first wicket at 23 at the beginning of the fifth over.

Mohammad Rizwan and Saim Ayub opened the innings for Pakistan to chase down the 107-run target. Mark Adair and Joshua Little into the attack for Ireland. Pakistan are 4-0 in the first over.

Pakistan failed to capitalise on the early wickets against Ireland as the Irish managed to put up 106 on the board with the loss of nine wickets. Batting conditions after rain-hit Florida proved to be quite tricky as Pakistani pacers along with Imad Wasim dominated the first half.

Wasim got a wicket with a collision in the deep as Shaheen Shah Afridi holds on to the catch, dismissing Mark Adair in the 14th over. Barry McCarthy follows lead as Wasim clean-bowled him, leaving Ireland 86-9 after 15 overs.

Wasim was introduced in the 12th over and successfully ends a good partnership for Ireland as they lost their seventh wicket. Gareth Delany is caught at point off a leading edge. Ireland are 76-7 at the end of the 12th over.

The Irish batters regain some ground after hitting Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan for a six each. Pakistan still in search of the seventh wicket as Ireland maintain a decent run rate of 5.9 runs per over. Ireland are 59-6 at the halfway mark of their innings.

Haris Rauf brought into the attack after the end of the powerplay and beat Curtis Campher with pace as he is caught in the field by Saim Ayub due to an untimed shot. Ireland lost their sixth wicket with the score at 33-6 after the end of seven overs.

After hitting Shaheen Shah Afridi for back-to-back boundaries in the fifth over, George Dockrell is caught and bowled by Mohammad Amir who deceived him with a slower delivery. Ireland are 32-5 at the end of six overs.

Afridi struck again for Pakistan in his second over after being denied an LBW review as Harry Tector fell prey to Afridi's swing and pace. Ireland 15-4 after three overs while George Dockrell joins Curtis Campher on the crease.

Mohammad Amir took the new ball from the other end and sent Irish skipper Paul Stirling back to the pavilion for getting caught behind. Ireland struggle at 8-3 after the second over. Curtis Campher joins Harry Tector on the crease.

Afridi opened the bowling attack for Pakistan with two wickets in the first over, sending back opener Andrew Balbirnie and one-down Lorcan Tucker. Ireland Captain Paul Stirling is joined on the crease by Harry Tector as the Irish are 2-2 after the first over.

Pakistan won the toss and decided to bowl first against Ireland in their farewell match of the T20 World Cup 2024. Captain Babar Azam said the decision is based on the ground conditions in Florida where it has not rained today, but the pitch has been under covers for three days.

Earlier, during the pitch report, Ramiz Raja shared that even though there is no rain, the outfield is still quite wet. He was joined by Waqar Younis who said that the groundstaff have done well to prepare the pitch, which has a few green spots that will help the pacers.

They stated that the pitch is a bit damp and soft which will make things difficult for the batters, adding that whoever wins the toss should look to bowl first.

Irish skipper Paul Stirling maintained that he would have liked to bowl first as well and will now look to put up runs on the board. He added, "Ireland managed to beat Pakistan leading up to the World Cup and did not go on to win the series, but this is a World Cup game and the feeling is different".
