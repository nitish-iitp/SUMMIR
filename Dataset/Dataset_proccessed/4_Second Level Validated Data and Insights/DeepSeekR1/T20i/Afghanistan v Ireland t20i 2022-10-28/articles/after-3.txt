Rain forces no-result between Afghanistan and Ireland
October 28, 2022 0

The Men’s T20 World Cup match between Ireland and Afghanistan was abandoned without a ball being bowled because of rain at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Afghanistan’s previous game against New Zealand was also abandoned on Wednesday because of rain at the same venue.

Both sides are awarded a point, leaving Ireland, who stunned England in their last match, third in Group 1, while Afghanistan remain bottom.

England’s match with Australia was also washed out later in the day.

Ireland next face holders and hosts Australia in Brisbane on Monday.

“It’s very disappointing, we’d played good cricket and were looking forward to this but can’t do much about the weather,” said Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie.

“It’ll be like a different country up in Brisbane. We want to push the champions.”

Afghanistan’s next tie is also in Brisbane, against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.

“Most of the players are disappointed, not having played on such a fantastic ground [the MCG],” said Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi.

“But the weather is not in our control, so we have to accept it. We look forward to the future games and hope to win.”

England are now second in the table, level on points with leaders New Zealand and Ireland, while fourth-placed Australia also have three points. Sri Lanka are a point further back in fifth. (BBC Sport)
