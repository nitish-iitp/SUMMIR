        "In the Group A match of the T20 World Cup 2024, India will take on Canada at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Lauderhill. With three straight wins in the group, the Indian cricket team have qualified through to the Super 8 stage of the tournament. Meanwhile, Canada are still in the hunt to make the next round of the T20 World Cup 2024, but they need to defeat the former world champions in their last group stage match and hope for the other results to go their way."
