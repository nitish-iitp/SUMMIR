The weather forecast for Sunday is mixed. I say ‘mixed’; it’s rubbish. There’s a reserve day on Monday, but the forecast isn’t great then either.

If the match can’t be completed, the trophy will be shared. As unsatisfying as that sounds, there is a precedent: the winners of the 2002 Champions Trophy were Sri Lanka and India.

“India have done this before,” writes Tim de Lisle, “right down to the match-losing fifty from Kohli.”

The Sky pundits are discussing whether they were too cautious, particularly at the start of the innings. World Cups do seem to act as a handbrake. I still don’t think they were that far short of par, though. England won what turned out to be a good toss and batted incredibly.

That said, this is a cracking statistic.

“Faced with three hours of teaching that clashed perfectly with the match, I managed to introduce my Italian pupils to the world of cricket as an excuse to follow the contest while allegedly teaching them English. They were a bit bemused to begin with but gradually became interested in the rules and were cheering for the players in red (no moral suasion or attempt to please teacher).

But they also, as Mike Atherton has just pointed out on Sky, hammered Australia in the semis in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

More from Jos Buttler. He’s buzzing

You couldn’t ask for a better runchase. I ummed and aahed over the toss, but gut feel said to chase today. India are sometimes more dangerous when they know what target they need. I thought Adil Rashid was outstanding; that’s the best I’ve seen him bowl in a long while. I thought he was our best chance to pick up wickets and he got the key one of Suryakumar.

The dimensions of this ground suited Chris Jordan and I thought he bowled fantastically well. I don’t think CJ was thanking me too much for bowling him three overs in a row at the death. I thought it was an incredible effort.

It’s too soon to say whether Dawid or Mark will be fit for Sunday. We’ve seen quite a lot of Pakistan recently; they’ve found some great form. At the moment we’re just excited to be in the final. We had the stress of trying to get through the group stages and now we’re in the final.

Jos Buttler’s verdict

[Is that the perfect game?] It feels that way, against such a good side. We always want to start as fast as we can with the bat and be really aggressive. A long batting line-up gives you a lot of freedom. Alex was so hard to bowl to today. We complement each other well and he was fantastic today. We’ll enjoy this win but we know there’s one big dance to go.

Rohit Sharma’s verdict

It’s pretty disappointing. I thought we batted pretty well at the back end, but we were not good enough with the ball. We just didn’t turn up.

It’s all about handling pressure [in the knockout stages]. We have played enough IPL cricket to understand that. The way we started off with the ball was not ideal, which shows we were a bit nervy. You have to give credit to those openers too; they played really well.

The new ball swung a bit for Bhuvi but not from the right areas. We wanted to keep it tight on the stumps. That’s a little disappointing. If you don’t execute your plans, you’ll find yourself in trouble.

The thoughts of Adil Rashid, who bowled marvellously and took the wicket of Suryakumar Yadav

Lovely. One more game and hopefully we’ll get there. I thought we bowled exceptionally well – we were happy chasing 169. There was a bit of turn. You have to get used to being able to bowl in the first Powerplay, I’ve been practising that so that I’m ready if the captain needs me.

[The openers] played magnificently. When they’re in that form nobody can stop them. There was no chat about the approach – just, ‘Boys, go do your thing.’ The job’s not done yet. One more game – play the way we play and hopefully we’ll get over the line.

The player of the match is Alex Hales

It’s a huge occasion, India in a World Cup semi-final, and I’m really happy with the way I played – it’s as special as it gets. This is one of the best grounds in the world to bat on, especially in the Powerplay.

I never thought I’d play in a World Cup again, so to get the chance – in a country I love – is very special.

The partnership of 170 is the highest for any wicket in a men’s T20 World Cup. Buttler can’t stop beaming as he embraces his team mates. He set the tone by taking 12 off the first over from his nemesis Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and then Alex Hales went ballistic. Buttler almost caught him up with a starburst of strokes at the end.

Buttler 80* (49 balls, 9x4, 3x6)

Hales 86* (47 balls, 4x4, 7x6)

And we still don’t know who was down to bat at No3.

ENGLAND WIN BY 10 WICKETS!!!!

16th over: England 170-0 (target 169; Buttler 80, Hales 86) Hales backs away to clatter a slower short ball from Shami over extra cover for four. It almost went for six. Dear me, this is savage.

Buttler finishes an unbelievable runchase in the grand manner, pinging Shami back over his head for one last six. He takes over his helmet, leans back and roars to the heavens.

That, surely, is the best T20 performance in England’s history. They have marmalised a great India team with ten wickets and 24 balls to spare.

15th over: England 156-0 (target 169; Buttler 71, Hales 81) A quiet over from Axar Patel, two from it. Both batters have faced 45 balls; Buttler has a strike rate of 158, Hales 180.

“This is like Brazil losing 7-1 to Germany,” says Vivek Jaitly. “Only if India manages to take a wicket here.”

Ah but Brazil were hosts. That’s what gave it an extra layer of WTF.

14th over: England 154-0 (target 169; Buttler 70, Hales 80) Jos Buttler took a mid-innings break to admire Alex Hales from the non-striker’s end, but he’s back to his spine-tingling best. He dumps Shami over extra cover for four and then makes room to launch a 100-metre six straight down the ground. That’s an unreal shot.

He tries again next ball, doesn’t get hold of it and is dropped by Suryakumar Yadav running back from mid-off. To compound India’s abundant misery he can only punch the ball to the boundary for four more.

“I’m all for a redemption arc but Alex Hales was banned for recreational drug use and the captain refused to pick him after this,” says Niall Mullen. “Seems tough but fair?”

I think it’s the length of the ostracism that most people were unhappy about. I can see both sides, and not only because my subconscious is so terrified of cancel culture that I haven’t expressed an opinion since 2018. Look, I’m sorry, I just don’t feel that strongly either way about Marmite.

13th over: England 140-0 (target 169; Buttler 56, Hales 80) Hales backs away, Pandya follows him, and Hales muscles the ball over mid-on for three.

Buttler scoops the next ball for four, a particularly good shot because Pandya followed him outside off stump. And then he reaches his half-century with a stunning flat six over midwicket. England are taking India to the cleaners.

“At the moment,” says Harsha Bhogle on commentary, “it looks like a contest between two boxers from different weight categories.”

11.45 CET

12th over: England 123-0 (target 169; Buttler 42, Hales 77) Ravichandran Ashwin returns to the attack. He bowled a very good first over, even though it went for 12.

England are so far ahead of the rate that they are able to work Ashwin around for low-risk ones and twos. Buttler hasn’t hit a boundary since the last ball of the Powerplay; with Hales running amok, he hasn’t needed to.

There he goes again! Hales gets down on one knee to dump Ashwin over backward square leg for six more. That’s his seventh six, which equals Jason Roy’s record for an England opener in T20Is. The overall record is Liam Livingstone’s nine, and it’s imperilled.

This is sensational stuff from Hales, up there with his amazing hundred against Sri Lanka in 2014. He slaughters Ashwin’s last ball to the cover boundary to move to 77 from 40 balls. England now need less than a run a ball.

11th over: England 108-0 (target 169; Buttler 38, Hales 66) Pandya’s first ball is pulled flat and hard over midwicket by Hales. That’s his sixth six – I SAID THAT’S HIS SIXTH SIX - and it brings up the century partnership from just 64 balls.

It’s so easy to think of Hales as a punisher, and by heaven does he punish, but his shot selection has been immaculate tonight. We probably don’t give him enough credit for his intelligence.

10th over: England 98-0 (target 169; Buttler 37, Hales 57) England won the Ashes in 2005 because Glenn McGrath hurt his ankle during a game of rugby. If they win this tournament, it might be because Jonny Bairstow decided to have a round of golf.

His replacement, Alex Hales, is batting formidably. He smashes the new bowler Arshdeep’s first ball through wide mid-off for four, then survives a potential run-out chance when Buttler’s straight drive hits the stumps at the non-striker’s end. Hales was well out of his ground, but Arshdeep didn’t get a touch.

There are still five overs of spin remaining; if India are to pull off a stunning victory, they will be key. England need 71 from 60 balls.

11.28 CET

9th over: England 91-0 (target 169; Buttler 34, Hales 51) Buttler gets a peculiar all-run four. He scooped the new bowler Pandya to third man, where Shami tried a simple relay throw to the supporting fielder. And it all went wrong, big time. It went over the fielder’s head and allowed England to turn two into four.

“They could still lose of course,” says Nick Butler, “but Hales showing in this and the previous two matches - all of which were must-win games, just how bizarre and damaging Morgan’s excessive personal vendetta against Hales has been.”

I don’t know. It felt harsh, but I’m loath to judge without knowing exactly what happened. We shouldn’t forget is that Hales would only have been a back-up in 2019 (although he would have played when Jason Roy was injured). One thing’s for sure: that post-match interview the other day redefined the word ‘awkward’.

"As good as it gets, it would be an absolute dream!" 🤩🤞

8th over: England 84-0 (target 169; Buttler 30, Hales 50) A lamentable short ball from Axar Patel is munched over cow corner by Hales. That’s his fifth six – as Tim de Lisle notes, that’s already as many as Hardik – and a single off the last ball takes him to an accomplished, occasionally brutal half-century from 28 balls. England need 85 from 72 balls.

“Evening Rob,” says Phil Withall. “Watching this pair bat, the way they are starting to dominate, they way their mindset is so perfectly predisposed to taking the game to India. I would like to retract my previous, petty comment. Bring on the trumpets…”

7th over: England 75-0 (target 169; Buttler 29, Hales 42) Hardik Pandya was going to bowl, but because he was off the field for a while it will be Ravichandran Ashwin instead. Pandya can bowl the next over.

Ashwin’s second ball turns appreciably to hit Buttler on the pad. There’s an appeal for a bat/pad catch to the keeper but the umpire isn’t interested; nor is Rohit Sharma.

It’s a really good over from Ashwin, with plenty of encouragement for India, but Hales keeps England moving with another sweep round the corner for six. He has 42 from 23 balls and is playing beautifully.

6th over: England 63-0 (target 169; Buttler 28, Hales 33) Let’s not get carried away. England were 70-0 after six overs against Sri Lanka and only just reached a target of 142. But jeez, they are going outrageously well at the moment. Hales sweeps Axar over backward square leg for his third six.

Buttler clunks a pull not far short of midwicket – but he ends the over by crashing a pull stroke over the same fielder for four.

In their last three Powerplays, against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and now India, England have 181-0 from 18 overs.

Terrific hitting this. The first thought is to hit over the field (unlike india who were largely trying to hit through it)

5th over: England 52-0 (target 169; Buttler 24, Hales 26) Mohammed Shami replaces Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2-0-25-0). Hales backs away to pump his second delivery over mid-off for a big six. For the third game in a row, England’s openers are doing serious damage in the Powerplay.

Hales slashes between keeper and slip for four to bring up a rapid fifty partnership from 31 balls. I’m pretty sure this is the first time in England’s T20 history that they’ve had three consecutive opening stands of 50 or more.

4th over: England 41-0 (target 169; Buttler 24, Hales 15) Now then. With two right-handers at the crease, the left-arm spinner Axar Patel is coming on. Buttler backs away to chip his first ball over extra cover for a one-bounce four. That’s an imperious statement of intent.

He tries a similar stroke next ball, but doesn’t middle it and only just clears the fielder running back from cover. In fact it was Pandya, who must have come back on the field between overs.

The ball seems to be stopping in the pitch a bit for Patel, and England are happy to milk the remainder of the over. Eight from it. England need 128 from 96 balls.

11.03 CET

3rd over: England 33-0 (target 169; Buttler 18, Hales 13) Hardik Pandya is off the field, receiving treatment to his left hand. It doesn’t look serious, so I’m sure he’ll be okay to bowl.

It’s Kumar to Hales for the first time. With Pant standing back, the England openers are walking down the pitch quite a lot to counter the swing. Hales does exactly that to launch an emphatic six over extra cover. A handful of ones and twos make it a really good over for England – 12 from it.

10 Nov 2022
10.58 CET

2nd over: England 21-0 (target 169; Buttler 17, Hales 2) The brilliant left-armer Arshdeep Singh, India’s leading wicket-taker in the tournament, shares the new ball. Alex Hales is vulnerable to left-arm inswing – which right-hander isn’t – and leading-edges the first ball through the covers for a single.

Buttler thick edges through backward point for another boundary, which takes him to 16 from seven balls, but Arshdeep closes out the over very well. When Buttler drives a low full toss to mid-off, Kohli throws at the non-striker’s end and seems to warn Hales about backing up illegally. Do bookies offer odds on a Mankad?

10 Nov 2022
10.52 CET

1st over: England 13-0 (target 169; Buttler 12, Hales 0) Buttler walks down the track to his first ball, offering no stroke to an outswinger that is harshly called wide. India’s response is instant – the wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant calls for a helmet and moves up to the stumps. Great stuff.

Buttler reaches outside off stump to crack the first legitimate delivery of the innings through extra cover for four, then – with Pant now standing back again - does the same to the third ball. So much for England having a look.

Kumar responds beautifully to beat Buttler with consecutive deliveries – the first wide and full, the second shorter and straight. And Buttler responds to the response with a measured stroke to the midwicket boundary. Blimey, what a start.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar will bowl the first over. Of course he will.

The players are back out on the field. It’s been said a gazillion times in the last 48 hours, but the contest between Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jos Buttler could be pivotal. Don’t be surprised if Buttler and Alex Hales take a couple of overs to get their eye in.

ENGLAND NEED 169 TO WIN

For much of that innings, England had a degree of control. But with India there is usually chaos at the death, and today was no exception. They (I say they, it was mainly Hardik Pandya) smashed 88 from the last seven overs to take India to what feels like a par total.

A word for Chris Jordan, whose figures of 4-0-43-3 don’t do justice to some very good death bowling.

WICKET! India 168-6 (Pandya hit wicket 63)

Pandya times Jordan devastatingly over midwicket for six, then pulls a full toss for four. He whips the last ball to the boundary as well – but treads on his stumps in the process and is out hit wicket. Those four lost runs might be vital. Even so, that’s an awesome innings from Hardik Pandya: 63 from 33 balls with five sixes, including 59 from his last 24 deliveries.

WICKET! India 158-5 (Pant run out 6)

Pant blazes a wide full toss for a single, which brings the rampant Pandya back on strike. He pings a yorker to the cover sweeper for a single, an outrageously good shot for one, and then Pant misses a wide yorker.

Pandya charges down the wicket, deliberately running Pant out so that he can regain the strike. In the circumstances, that’s smart cricket. (Had it been a catch, the new batter would have been on strike, but because it was a run out they are allowed to cross.)

Three balls remaining.

19th over: India 156-4 (Pandya 52, Pant 5) Sam Curran’s last over disappears for 20! Pant makes room to carve his first ball over backward point for four, then flicks a sizzling yorker for a single.

Another wide yorker is steered deftly for four by Pandya, who then pulls a monstrous six over midwicket. The over finishes with a vicious clip towards cow corner that not even the diving Stokes can stop. That brings up a punishing half-century from Pandya. He scored 4 from his first 9 deliveries; he’s belted 48 from the last 20.

18th over: India 136-4 (Pandya 37, Pant 0) That was a fine catch from Rashid, and it ends a seriously eventful over. The new batter is Rishabh Pant.

WICKET! India 136-4 (Kohli c Rashid b Jordan 50)

Virat Kohli is out, and if that doesn’t isn’t worth an exclamation mark then I don’t know what is! But first, let’s flash back to the start of the over…

Jordan tries to surprise Pandya with a short ball first up. Pandya surprises Jordan by swatting it in to the crowd at midwicket. That’s his second six, and he gets his third next ball with an incredible shot. Jordan didn’t quite nail a leg-stump yorker, and Pandya helicopter-flicked it sweetly over backward square leg.

Jordan, who was tagged at the death in last year’s semi-final, must be having flashbacks. But his response is admirable: a bouncer that beats Pandya and then a perfect yorker that Pandya can only squeeze for a single.

Kohli drives two through extra cover to bring up his usual half-century: 39 balls, four fours, one six. But he falls next ball, squirting a wide yorker to Rashid at short third man. Virat Kohli is out!

17th over: India 121-3 (Kohli 48, Pandya 24) Here comes Sam Curran. He’s been England’s banker at the death in this tournament, but this is an entirely different challenge.

His first ball is short, wide and slammed savagely over the short square boundary for six by Pandya. Kohli punches the air with delight.

The next ball is heaved to deep square leg, where the sprawling Hales does very well to save two runs. Curran nails a wide yorker that is scrunched down the ground, with the non-striker Kohli scarpering back for two. That’s excellent running.

But it’s also an excellent comeback from Curran: six from the first ball, five from the next five.

Three overs to go, and there is absolutely no consensus about what would be a par score.

Don't think this pitch is totally straightforward. 170 could be a winning score

Need a big finish. This isn't enough on this surface. Need 160 minimum by the look of it

16th over: India 110-3 (Kohli 48, Pandya 13) Kohli smiles at his reprieve and then drives Jordan’s next ball through extra cover for four. Glorious batting.

A misfield from Livingstone gives him a single, and then Pandya pulls another to deep square. India score 10 for the third consecutive over.

KOHLI IS NOT OUT!

Well, I thought it was plumb but in fact it was only clipping leg stump. That means it’s umpire’s call and Kohli survives. I can’t decide whether that’s a remarkably good decision from Paul Reiffel or a really poor one.

15.2 overs: India 102-3 (Kohli 43, Pandya 10) Chris Jordan has bowled 10,000 yorkers in the nets, all for a moment like this. If all goes to plan, he’ll be out form this end. He starts inauspiciously, with a leg-side wide to Pandya, and then knocks Kohli off his feet with a sensational yorker.

Paul Reiffel says not out but England go for the review. If it’s pad first, it’s plumber than plumb.

15th over: India 100-3 (Kohli 43, Pandya 9) Livingstone does indeed continue; I suspect this is Woakes’s fourth over that he’s bowling, which would love three from Jordan and two from Curran.

After his usual watchful start, four from nine balls, Pandya smears a terrifying boundary just past the umpire’s head. After a couple of useful dot balls for England, Kohli waves a superb boundary through extra cover. Not even Jordan, running round from long off, could stop that.

India have scored ten from each of the last two overs. If they keep that up they’ll get to 150 – but I suspect they’ll be eyeing closer to 170.

England going with the short straight on fielder (technically short straight hit, but that's not as good a name)
