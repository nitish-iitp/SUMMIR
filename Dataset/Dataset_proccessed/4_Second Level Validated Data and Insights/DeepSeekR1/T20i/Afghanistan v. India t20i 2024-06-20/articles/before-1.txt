Rohit Sharma's Team India are done and dusted with their T20 World Cup group stage games and are currently preparing to counter the Afghan challenge in the Super 8 opener. Their match against Canada was a washout post which they travelled to Barbados for the next round of the ICC event. As soon as the Indian contingency landed in Barbados, they immediately took to beach to rejuvenate themselves with few games of beach volleyball.
India take on their neighbours Afghanistan, a team that has grown from strength to strength in the past few years and pose some good threat to the 'Men in Blue' as far as their bowling department is concerned. The Indian batters have played the Afghanistan players often in the IPL and might read them well. With the Caribbean tracks favouring the spinners, India need to be at the top of their game to counter the Afghan challenge.
'The group wants to go out and do something special, good way to start the second stage of the tournament. Clearly shows that everybody wants to make a difference and obviously we take our skill sessions quite seriously. We are playing the next two games in a span of 3 or 4 days. It is going to be little hectic, but we are all used to this. We travel a lot, we play a lot and that is never going to be an excuse.' said Rohit.
Watch the video here:
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted a video on their social media handle which showcases the Indian team slowly getting into the groove and sweating it out in the training nets before they start their Super 8 round. What grabbed eyeballs was the sight of Rinku Singh rolling his arm over in the Team India nets. The explosive Kolkata Knight Riders batsman is a travelling reserve in the squad and is waiting for his chance to come by in the ongoing World Cup. India play Afghanistan in their first Super 8 round match.
