Ireland pulled off a superb 10-run win over South Africa, their first against the Proteas in T20 internationals, to level the two-match series 1-1 in Abu Dhabi on Sunday (September 29, 2024). Chasing a 196-run target, Aiden Markram's men were restricted to 185 for nine in 20 overs. Catch the cricket scores and ball-by-ball commentary from the IRE vs RSA game, right here.

With the Proteas winning the first game comfortably, Ireland needed to claim victory on Sunday to avoid a series defeat and they did exactly that. Ross Adair smashed a century to lead the Irish batting efforts, and Graham Hume then starred with a three-wicket haul.

Earlier, South Africa captain Aiden Markram won the toss and decided to bowl first against Ireland.

South Africa had eased to an eight-wicket triumph over Ireland in the first match, with Patrick Kruger and Ryan Rickelton starring for the Proteas.

Kruger's four-wicket haul saw Ireland manage 171 from their overs, with Rickleton's knock of 76 from 48 deliveries giving his side a solid foundation to build on.
