        "England will lock horns against USA in their final match of the Super 8s stage in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024. England has two points from two games – with one defeat and one victory. The Three Lions started strong with a win against co-hosts West Indies but then lost against the Proteas. The defending champions will thus need to churn out a win to keep their semi-finals qualification hopes alive."
