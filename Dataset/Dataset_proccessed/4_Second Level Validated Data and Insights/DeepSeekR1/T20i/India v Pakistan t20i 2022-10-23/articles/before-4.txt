India vs Pakistan: Drama, nerves, revenge, and a rain threat
By Mumbai Indians | 21 OCT, 2022

Read it in Hindi.

Read it in Marathi.

This one’s new. Let’s get it out of our system and reverse-jinx it. The biggest worry for an Indian cricket fan is not losing to Pakistan, it is an India-Pakistan encounter, an already-rare species, getting washed out. And sadly, Melbourne’s weather is messing around with our emotions! The forecast, early into the season, shows an 80% chance of rain. 

Never mind, let’s not look there. 

We, the Indian fans, are in search of redemption. The record we’ve proudly held on to since 1992, of being undefeated against Pakistan in World Cups, was brutally taken away from us last year. India 12-1 Pakistan. That’s how it stands. And our Men in Blue return, 364 days later, hungrier, better prepared, with a new strategy, to get the train back on track. Also, importantly, put smiles back on our faces. Batting is clearly India’s stronger suit; bowling is Pakistan’s. That’s where the game was decided in 2021 when Shaheen Shah Afridi ran through India’s top-order, and that’s exactly where it would be in 2022. 

Over multiple ICC Global tournaments in the last ten years, India have gone really close on multiple occasions, but have regularly fallen short of bringing home the silverware. They have the players, they have the intent, they have us fans. When the shrewd strategist and the Hitman avatar of Rohit Sharma comes to the fore, Kohli unwinds into a run-machine, Aapla Dada Surya, does, well, an Aapla Dada, and Hardik Pandya milks his golden run, try preventing India from snatching this one! 

What: The greatest sporting rivalry ever, India vs Pakistan in a World Cup 

Where: MCG, Melbourne 

When: Sunday, October 23, 2022 

What to expect: A proper box-office contest. Lots of drama, lots of off-the-field cheering, and hopefully some pre-Diwali celebrations for all of us.
