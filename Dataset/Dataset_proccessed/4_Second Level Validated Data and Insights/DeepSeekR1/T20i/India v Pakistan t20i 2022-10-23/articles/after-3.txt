It’s a wrap!

So, where do both teams go from here?

India will now head to Sydney, where they play the Netherlands on Thursday.

Pakistan will fly to Perth to regroup and get their campaign back on track. They face Zimbabwe on Thursday. They can take solace in the potent bowling attack they have and should consider today’s result as an anomaly, as most days, their attack can take down any side when on song.

For those who braved the early start like I did, I am grateful for your company and look forward to you joining us next time.

Where did it go wrong for Pakistan?

India looked down and out at 31 for 4 in the seventh over. The spinning tandem of Nawaz and Shadab did well to build on the previous efforts of the pacers as they looked to throttle the run chase.

Pakistan were very much in the driver’s seat and looked to have the match done and dusted when India were staring down the barrel at 54 needed off the final four overs.

Ultimately, it was the pressure of the occasion and the opposition they were facing which proved to be their downfall.

A fatal combination of deciding when to bowl certain bowlers, and bowling error itself, proved to be the difference as the match descended into the final stages.

Kohli’s calculation to take Rauf on in the penultimate over gave India a fighting chance with 16 needed off the final over, before Nawaz suffered a serious meltdown of no-balls and wides to gift India the victory.

Rohit: ‘The best innings Kohli has played for India’

Rohit was in raptures about the man of the moment.

“I have no voice left. We always wanted to make sure we stayed in the game as long as possible. We’ve talked constantly about it. No matter what the situation, you’ve got to believe you can pull through”, he said.

“That partnership [Hardik and Kohli] changed the game for us. We knew it would not be an easy target on that pitch, and that we had to bat out of our skins. Hats off to Virat. It has to go as not one of his best, but the best innings he has played for India.”

Babar: ‘Credit to Kohli’

A rather despondent Babar had this to say about the crazy sequence of events which unfolded.

“We started well in our bowling, but then all credit to Hardik and Kohli. They shifted the momentum and finished the game well.

“We had a chance, and I just asked the boys to believe in themselves, but again credit to Kohli. We can take a lot of positives from the way Iftikhar and Masood played, and how we finished the innings.”

Kohli: ‘I have no idea how that happened’

A visibly emotional Kohli did his best to reflect on the stunning change of events.

“I honestly have no words. I have no idea how that happened. Hardik kept telling me to believe and to stay till the end,” he said.

“The calculation was simple. Nawaz had one over to bowl, so if I could take Haris down, they would panic. Till today I said Mohali was my best T20 innings. Then I got 82 off 52 and today I got 82 off 53. Both are just as special but I would count this one higher due to the magnitude of the game.”

It should be no surprise then that he is deemed the Player of the Match.

India pull off miraculous MCG win!

Have you caught your breath? My fingers are on fire.

Did you ever think the match, when India was teetering at 31 for 4 in the seventh over, would finish in the manner that it did?

Kohli ends up with an unbeaten 82 off 53, which will surely go down as the greatest T20 innings he has played to date, especially when you consider the circumstances and occasion.

One can only doff their hat to superb, under-pressure innings that were timed to perfection.

It was a real masterclass in how to bat and believe even when the situation seems grim.

20 overs. India WIN!

Ashwin is able to clear the infield, as he just needs to find the gap in order to get the quick single.

What an unbelievable game! India were done and dusted, and now you see Kohli sprinting to his teammates as he is clearly battling back a few tears as well.

It just doesn’t get bigger than a World Cup encounter with your rivals to pull off a result like this!

India 160-6 in 20 overs.

19.5 overs. India 159-6

Nawaz delivers another wide!

This is just astonishing. In all my years, I don’t think I’ve seen a team in such a strong position completely fall apart at the seams in the end.

The MCG explodes and India now need 1 off 1 to seal a famous win!

19.5 runs. India 158-6

Nawaz gets his man, although the ball slips down the leg side, which Karthik tries to sweep but ends up hitting his pad.

Rizwan is quickly on it and is able to stump Karthik before he has a chance to regain his ground.

New batsman in will be Ashwin.

India need 2 off 1 now.
