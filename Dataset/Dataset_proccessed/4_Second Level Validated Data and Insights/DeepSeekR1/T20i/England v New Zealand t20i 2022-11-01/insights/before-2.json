    "New Records": [
        "Jos Buttler will become the second player to reach 100 men's T20Is for England and will overtake Eoin Morgan as their all-time leading run-scorer in the format if he makes at least 64 runs in this match"
    ],
    "Key Match Events": [
        "The match is a must-win for England to progress in the tournament, as they will still be alive mathematically even with a defeat but will rely on Afghanistan beating Australia and then defeating Sri Lanka in their final fixture"
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "England's seamers were excellent with the new ball against Afghanistan but were wayward against Ireland, conceding 59 runs in the first six overs, with Chris Woakes coming in for particularly brutal treatment; New Zealand's opening bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee have been lethal with the new ball since arriving in Australia"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "New Zealand have never played a T20I at the Gabba and have a poor historic record there across formats; they have not won a game in Brisbane in the last 20 years"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The game could be won and lost in the two powerplays; Finn Allen has the highest strike rate in T20 history among batters with at least 1000 runs"
