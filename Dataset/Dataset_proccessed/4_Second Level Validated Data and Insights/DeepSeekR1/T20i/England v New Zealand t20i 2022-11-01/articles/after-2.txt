9.49pm So, that's a wrap from the Gabba. England have done what they needed to do to stay in contention. And by the time they take on Sri Lanka in Sydney on Saturday, they'll know what they need to do to qualify for the semi-finals. Here's how the table stands for now. Australia have a chance to improve their NRR with a big win against Afghanistan, but England you sense have a priceless advantage in going last. From Miller, PDP and Chandan, good night!

Chamara Kahapal: "I think you got it wrong. No. of wins is the main factor here, rather than the NRR" Not if the number of wins is level, it isn't...

Kane Williamson: "Credit to the way England played, they played beautifully, put us under pressure from the get-go and were clinical. It was a slightly above-par total. We tried to take it deep, but credit to the way they bowled. It was a fair surface, we were in it in the second half but needed a few things to go our way. Tried to target certain areas of the ground and take it deep.

On dropping Buttler. "One of, if not the best player in the game. If you do that he'll make you pay, made the boundaries look small, which they certainly are not. I thought I squeezed the catch into my chest, a bit embarrassing. Phillips, batting beautifully on some difficult pitches. Long may that continue."

Jos Buttler is the Player of the Match. "We had a poor performance [against Ireland] but a lot of confidence in the group, we left it all out there tonight. A ruthless tournament, SA went out last year with four wins out of five. You expect to be under pressure. I think with our line-up, we bat deep, allows us to take it on an over earlier than you might. The wicket was tricky, but Hales played a great knock and took the pressure off.

"Hales played brilliantly, one of the form T20 players and he's got his chance again. Easy to critique performances but you need to back players in a high-risk game. We pushed beyond 160-165 so 180 was a good score. We've had success batting first against Australia, so being brave and take the positive option, knowing you need to take wickets."

9.28pm So, New Zealand's unbeaten run ends, and if the remaining matches go according to the form book, we are set for a three-way tie in Group 1, with NRR the deciding factor. All eyes on how Australia take on Afghanistan on Friday now... they need a big win to put the squeeze on these two teams...

It looked very dicey indeed for England when Glenn Phillips was dropping bombs in the middle overs, but on a sticky pitch, England's seamers were exceptional in the final quarter, with Mark Wood's third over setting the tone, and Curran and Woakes closing out magnificently. Jos Buttler's 73 was the clincher in the final analysis, along with a key fifty from Hales at the top of England's order.

19.6
1
Sam Curran to Santner, 1 run

Right on the mark again from Curran, bending back in on a yorker length, clipped to long-on, and England win by 20 runs

19.5
•
Sam Curran to Santner, no run

Bouncer, well directed, following the batter and rising sharply off the deck. More precious dots to improve the NRR for England

19.4
•
Sam Curran to Santner, no run

Brilliant blockhole bowling from Curran, another inswinging yorker, curling into the left-hander's toes

19.3
2
Sam Curran to Santner, 2 runs

Inswinger, into the legs, cuffed to long-on, and back for two more

David: "When Phillips hit those two sixes, the game looked gone for England. But whaddaya know? One 3 over mega gltich with Cricinfo bugging out, and the game has turned 180. Thank you, guys. " You're always welcome! Hopefully the gremlins have been vanquished now...

19.3
1w
Sam Curran to Santner, 1 wide

Fired in fuller, Santner walks across his stumps, and England review! Looked like the umpire was going to signal wide, but there might have been a tickle through to the keeper. Doesn't look like it... and no pad either. Wide it is!

19.2
1
Sam Curran to Sodhi, 1 run

Outside off, into the pitch, back of a length, clawed to midwicket

19.1
•
Sam Curran to Sodhi, no run

Ghosts past the outside edge, curling away on the full length, can't connect on the slapped drive. A precious dot, given that NRR is as important as the win now

Curran to close out.

6
Woakes to Santner, SIX runs

Sits back in the crease, and slams a six up and over long-on! A useful strike from Santner, just keeps New Zealand's faint hopes alive. Woakes is frustrated, but that's a mighty stint all the same

18.6
1w
Woakes to Santner, 1 wide

Too wide this time, outside the batter's arc

18.5
2
Woakes to Santner, 2 runs

Back of a length, tight across the left-hander, another attempted pull but rolls out towards long-on.

18.4
2
Woakes to Santner, 2 runs

Crashed on the up, full length outside off, and picked up in the deep

18.3
1lb
Woakes to Sodhi, 1 leg bye

Good aggression from Woakes, pace on this time, into the pitch as the batter advances and wears his attempted pull in the ribs

18.2
1
Woakes to Santner, 1 run

Pushed across the left-hander on the full length, hacked out to deep point and just the single, as the rate leaps towards four a ball

Woakes to Sodhi, 1 run

Thumped through the line, but no timing, another single to mid-on

1
Sam Curran to Sodhi, 1 run

Eased down the ground, another exceptional screw-turning over. It's 20 an over now, and New Zealand need snookers

17.5
1
Sam Curran to Santner, 1 run

Superb from Curran, sees the batter shaping to leg, follows him with the inswinger, and they can only pick off the cramped single to mid-on

17.4
3
Sam Curran to Sodhi, 3 runs

Stabbed off the ribs, up and over backward square, Rashid rushes back at the rope and drags it back well

17.3
W
Sam Curran to Phillips, OUT

Walloped high through the line, and Jordan pouches another! That, surely, is the game for England! Phillips had to put bat through ball, but the tricksy angle and pace off the pitch scuppers his timing. The super-sub is back on the edge of the rope and makes no mistake!

Sam Curran to Santner, 1 run

Short from Curran, sticking in the pitch as Santner leans back on a pull to midwicket

17.1
3
Sam Curran to Phillips, 3 runs

Outside off, slams the drive with excellent placement, but Brook tracks it from deep cover and flings out a hand to intercept! Brilliant commitment to save a single. Still, that's the three a ball needed...

So, the rate is suddenly leaning towards three a ball. Boundaries are essential for Phillips
