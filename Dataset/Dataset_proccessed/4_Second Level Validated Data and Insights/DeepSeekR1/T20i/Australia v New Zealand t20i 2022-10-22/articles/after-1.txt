That’s a wrap

Thanks for joining us tonight.

What a performance that was from New Zealand. The Black Caps batted, bowled and fielded on a different level to the Australians, who will lick their wounds before another match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday in Perth.

Their chances of becoming the first team to go back-to-back at T20 World Cups has taken a huge blow but it’d be unwise to write them off just yet.

Make sure you check out Mal Conn’s match report and all our mastheads for the latest news and analysis throughout the World Cup. Cheers!
