        "LeBron James and Bronny James checked into the game together with four minutes left in the second quarter, prompting a big ovation from the home crowd. LeBron had already started the game and played 13 minutes before he teamed up with his 20-year-old son to make history. They played 2 1/2 minutes on court together, with LeBron missing two perimeter shots and Bronny having an early rebound and missing a tip-in. Bronny's first NBA jump shot was a 3-pointer that came up just short."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "The Lakers were fully aware of the history they would make with this pairing, and coach JJ Redick spoke with the Jameses recently about a plan to make it happen early in the regular season. The presence of the Griffeys likely made it an inevitability for opening night, even though Redick said the Lakers still wanted it 'to happen naturally, in the flow of the game.'"

        "The Jameses and the Griffeys met up during pregame warmups for some photos and a warm chat between two remarkable family lines. LeBron and Bronny joined a small club of father-son professional athletes who played together. The Griffeys made history 34 years ago, and they even homered in the same game on September 14, 1990."
