Nets’ Nic Claxton provides reason for optimism in first start of season
By Brian Lewis
Published Nov. 5, 2024, 12:54 a.m. ET

Nic Claxton finally got his first start of the season, after missing the whole preseason. And he looked like himself in a 106-104 victory over Memphis. 

“Just effort, execution, grit. It was a great game,” Claxton said. “We battled, it was fast-paced, it was fun. It was a good win.” 

The Nets center had 10 points on 5 of 8 shooting — including a rebound and coast-to-coast drive. He grabbed eight boards, handed out three assists, notched a couple of steals and blocked a shot in a season-high 26:38.

“[It was] mostly good. It’s just still getting back into the swing of things. I had like one stint where I was really tired, but other than that, I was good. Just trying to communicate, just find my balance again,” said Claxton, who came through playing both ends of a back-to-back unscathed. 

“[I’m] 100%. I’m good. I’m ready to go, I’m ready to play. I’m ready for whatever.” 

Claxton was sidelined the entire preseason with a hamstring injury. But he’s slowly ramped up and seemed spry against the humongous Zach Edey. He even adjusted as the game went on, not going for blocks as much as playing the position game. 

“Yeah, that’s the game. You know, I’m a rim-protector, so sometimes if I go over and protect the rim, bigs are gonna get easy looks,” Claxton said. “It’s frustrating. But yeah, just trying to use my speed and get out on the break and get them out of position, and it worked.” 

Dorian Finney-Smith had 17 points (6 of 10 and a Nets career-high-tying 5 of 8 from deep) with six boards in 28 minutes. 

He’s been asked to screen, guard centers in drop coverage and guard perimeter players. Finney-Smith is the second player in team history with five 3-pointers and five offensive rebounds in the same game (after Kyrie Irving on Dec. 9, 2022 against Atlanta).

“It’s tough. I’m guarding big men, so I’m using my legs a lot more,” said Finney-Smith. “I’m battling the whole game. But I wanna win, so whatever I gotta do to win, I’m gonna do it. It just feels good to make some shots.” 

Noah Clowney missed Monday’s game with a sore hip, but the Nets big man told The Post he’s hopeful of playing their next game in Boston. 

“It’s sore. But I should be fine. Yeah,” Clowney said of the Friday matchup against the Celtics at TD Garden. The rare span of three days between games should prove helpful. “It’s great. Time to recover, get it right so I can play the next one.” 

Clowney got hurt late in Sunday’s loss. He was listed as questionable with right hip soreness and got ruled out Monday, but the Nets downplayed the injury. 

“He had an MRI [on Monday] morning. Clean, everything clear. But bruised, sore, so we don’t wanna risk it,” coach Jordi Fernandez said. “We wanna make sure he’s OK for, I think it’s gonna be soon. But that’s the status.”

Ben Simmons was rested on the tail end of a back-to-back (managing his back).
