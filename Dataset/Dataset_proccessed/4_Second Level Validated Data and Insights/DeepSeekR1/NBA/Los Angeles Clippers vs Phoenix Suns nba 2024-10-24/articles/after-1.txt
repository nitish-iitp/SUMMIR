The 2024–25 Phoenix Suns season began with a rock fight against the Clippers. You could see that the rust was still present and it served as a reminder that no matter how many preseason games are played, they can’t replicate the intensity of regular season action. Phoenix, who was 10 down in the fourth quarter, came back and won the game in overtime, 116-113.

While there’s no need for overreaction, there’s definitely plenty to react to. The game took place, and as they say, every action prompts an equal or greater reaction, right?

My biggest takeaway from the game is that, despite the coaching change, the Suns fell into an all-too-familiar trap from last season: relying heavily on Kevin Durant in isolation playmaking situations.

Last season, the Suns lacked a true point guard in the traditional sense. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, and Kevin Durant were tasked not only with carrying the scoring load but also handling the ball. It was an experiment that unfolded in slow motion over the year, and we know how that ended.

James Jones smartly went and acquired to quality facilitators while simultaneously signing two players who possess ball security. Tyus Jones and Monte Morris were brought to Phoenix to correct the wrong wrongs from a season ago.

Yet in the very first game of the season, Kevin Durant found himself handling the ball far too often, taking on playmaking duties. KD led the team with a 29.5 usage percentage in the Suns' win on Wednesday.

In case it wasn’t obvious—Durant is 7 feet tall. When he dribbles, the distance between his hand and the ball is significantly greater than that of someone like Tyus Jones. What does that mean? It means there’s more room for error.

Durant is one of the greatest shotmakers in NBA history, and while he’s certainly capable of playmaking, but with this roster he shouldn’t have to.

Kevin Durant committed a team-high seven turnovers last night. Some were simply unforced errors, but others stemmed from him being put in a position to be a playmaker. When he put the ball on the floor in an attempt to make things happen, it didn’t work out.

The Suns’ final shot that forced overtime was pure Kevin Durant brilliance. Isolated at the top of the key, he worked to create space, driving right before spinning back to his left. With three defenders closing in, Durant calmly rose up and drained the 15-footer, a breathtaking moment that showcased his greatness.

But it didn’t have to be that difficult.

If you take a step out and you look at the play, his teammates are standing around watching him. Just like last year. No movement. No back cuts. No attempt to try to put pressure on the defense so they can’t specifically key in on Kevin Durant.

It’s not Kevin Durant’s fault. It’s schematic.

Of course, there will be moments when Kevin Durant is called upon to playmake. You want that option in your offense. But as the clock wound down in the fourth quarter, after Devin Booker fouled out, the Suns leaned on it too heavily. Durant had a staggering 40% usage rate in the final quarter. The Clippers saw it coming, and with the shot clock winding down, they timed their blitzes perfectly, making life difficult for him.

To make matters worse, his teammates weren’t moving off the ball, leaving Durant in an even tougher spot.

The best possessions at the end of the game were the ones in which Tyus initiated the office. That sweet little pick and roll that led to Kevin Durant driving to the basket drawing and one that gave the Suns the lead late? That’s what we need to see more of. That’s what we hope we witness on a regular basis.

Granted, Durant did put the ball on the floor during that play, but he did so in open space, not with a defender smothering him. The priority should be to get KD the ball in areas where he can operate effectively, not just hand it to him and stand around like spectators.

Absolutely, there will be other wrinkles in the offense. Booker will facilitate, Durant will facilitate, and Beal will facilitate. That’s the beauty of this team—they have multiple options to attack late in games, making them a nightmare to defend. However, running the offense through Durant play after play isn’t the solution. You want the ball in his hands, but it’s all about how you get it to him.

Hopefully, last night served as a learning experience for Budenholzer. As a Suns fan, I’ve seen this story play out before, and I’m not keen on reading it again.
