The Utah Jazz pay a visit to the Phoenix Suns at the Footprint Center on Saturday night. Here’s a Utah Jazz vs Phoenix Suns Prediction. This article will include a Utah Jazz vs Phoenix Suns Pick.
Utah Jazz 

The Utah Jazz have been in a real funk as they've lost seven of their last nine games overall. The Jazz will be hoping to avoid a third straight defeat after falling just short to the Heat in a 97-92 loss on Thursday. Lauri Markkanen led the team with 23 points on eight of 24 shooting, Collin Sexton added 23 points with five assists on nine of 18 shooting but no other player finished in double figures in scoring. As a team, the Jazz shot just 39 percent from the field and 11 of 36 from the 3-point line as they worked hard to overcome a slow start and take a 10-point lead. The Jazz got run down in the fourth quarter where they managed just 22 points in a disappointing finish. Patty Mills shot just three of 12 to finish with nine points off the bench while Johnny Juzang shot just two of nine for his five points. 

Phoenix Suns 

Meanwhile, the Phoenix Suns have been in a slump of their own as they've lost eight of their last 11 games overall. The Suns will be looking to build some momentum after taking down the Hawks in a 123-115 home win on Thursday. Bradley Beal led the team with 25 points on 11 of 16 shooting, Kevin Durant and Grayson Allen scored 23 points apiece while Devin Booker tallied 20 points with 12 assists. As a team, the Suns shot a healthy 57 percent from the field and 13 of 33 from the 3-point line. The Suns went back and forth with the Hawks in a free-flowing first half, before they clamped down defensively and held the Hawks to just 20 points in the third quarter to start to pull away.

Utah Jazz vs Phoenix Suns Prediction

The Jazz are still shorthanded with John Collins still out and they have Brice Sensabaugh and Johnny Juzang both listed as questionable, while the Suns are still missing Royce O'Neale with an ankle injury. The Jazz haven't been able to get anything going this season, but they were more than competitive in their narrow loss to the Heat in their last outing. The Suns haven't been much better than the Jazz to be fair, but the Suns are just about at full health and they would've taken plenty of confidence from their win over the Hawks on Thursday. The line is a bit hefty, but the Jazz could be even more shorthanded than they were in their last game. I am looking at the Suns to jump out to an early lead and win this one comfortably at home.
