The strong setback the Rockets will face in the next 2 months

Jabari Smith Jr. will be out for 1 to 2 months after fracturing his left hand

 JORGE P. BORREGUERO | SAT, 01/04/2025 - 17:00   
Jabari Smith Jr., player for Houston Rockets.

Early this morning, the Houston Rockets fell to the reigning champions of the NBA. The Boston Celtics dominated the Texas franchise, even without Jaylen Brown or Al Horford. With a very solid defense, they left no room for Ime Udoka's men.

Furthermore, the Rockets were without Jabari Smith Jr. as the player had fractured his hand during practice just hours before.

The news on his condition is not encouraging. Smith Jr. will have to be out for at least 1 month, with the possibility of extending to 2 months.

Following the defeat against the Celtics, the Houston Rockets maintain a record of 22-12 but remain in 3rd place in the Western Conference.
