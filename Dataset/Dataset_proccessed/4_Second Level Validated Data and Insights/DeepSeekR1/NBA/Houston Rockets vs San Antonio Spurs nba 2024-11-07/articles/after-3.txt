Fred VanVleet recorded his first double-double of the season while Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun combined for 37 points as the Houston Rockets cruised to a 127-100 victory over the visiting San Antonio Spurs in the NBA on Wednesday.

VanVleet paired 21 points with 10 assists and also grabbed seven rebounds while enjoying a remarkable shooting night. He finished 10 of 11 from the floor, including 9 for 9 from inside the arc, to spearhead an exceptional shooting performance for the Rockets on non-3-pointers.

The bench trio of Amen Thompson, Tari Eason and Jock Landale tallied 31 points on 14-for-23 shooting. Thompson and Landale grabbed six rebounds each. The Rockets shot 56.3 percent overall.

The Spurs were undone by their 20 turnovers, which Houston converted into 20 points. Victor Wembanyama scored 15 points but missed 5 of 6 3-pointers, including his first five.
