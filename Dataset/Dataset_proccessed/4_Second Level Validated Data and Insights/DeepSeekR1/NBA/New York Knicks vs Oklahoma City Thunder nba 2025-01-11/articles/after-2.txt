Between two top-five squads, the Oklahoma City Thunder ran the New York Knicks off their home floor. The Thunder collected a 126-101 win over the Knicks. MSG has become OKC's home away from home as it has won seven games in a row there since 2017.

After being in a slump, Isaiah Joe snapped out of it. He scored a career-high 31 points on 11-of-16 shooting and 8-of-11 from 3. The eight outside makes were also a career-high.

It's always a nice treat when a role player goes off — especially against one of the league's best teams. The Knicks had no answer for Joe as he made a deep 3-pointer after a deep 3-pointer.

Here's what Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams and Joe said about his 31-point explosion:

Mark Daigneault

"We know he's capable of it. He's had it before. He hasn't shot the ball this season the way he's wanted to. We were kinda waiting for a game like this. Or at least I was. It was about a matter of time. Great confidence by him. He's just continued to shoot the right ones. Hasn't pressed or gotten timid at all. He continues to play a great floor game, which allows us to play him through the ups and downs of shooting. I was happy for him tonight. That was an unbelievable performance."

Isaiah Joe

"I believe in the law of averages. There's ups and downs. Can never waver. I think just staying consistent with your work off the court, away from the game kinda goes into that. Just having confidence. My teammates have confidence in me. They always find me. Just having confidence in myself and letting it fly."

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

"The percentages always average out. He's an amazing shooter and was in a little bit of a slump. Little bit longer than he'd like. But he's too good of a shooter — mechanically, confidence-wise, touch-wise — he's gonna figure it out. He's gonna balance it out. If you have a bad game, it's gonna balance out somewhere else. He put in enough work in the summertime where now you're a hot shooter, 45% shooter in the NBA, and you shoot 20 this month, next month you're gonna shoot 60."

Jalen Williams

"In the summer he works hard. I'm not really with him in the summer but as a result of how he plays, you can tell he puts work in. He's always in the gym, he's always getting shots. The more you keep shooting when you're that good of a shooter, you're gonna have games like this where you have a breakthrough."
