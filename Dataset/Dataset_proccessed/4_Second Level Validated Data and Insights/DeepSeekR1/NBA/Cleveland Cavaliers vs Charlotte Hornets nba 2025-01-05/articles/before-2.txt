The Charlotte Hornets pay a visit to the Cleveland Cavaliers at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Sunday. Here’s a Charlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers Prediction. This article will include a Charlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers Pick.
Charlotte Hornets 

The Charlotte Hornets have been ice-cold as they've lost 17 of their last 18 games overall and they will be hoping to snap a nine-game losing streak after falling just short to the Pistons in a 98-94 road defeat on Friday. Miles Bridges led the team with 20 points, nine rebounds, and five assists, Mark Williams added 18 points with nine rebounds while Nick Richards chipped in with 10 points, but no other player finished in double figures in scoring. As a team, the Hornets shot just 41 percent from the field and nine of 30 from the 3-point line. The Hornets got off to a great start and looked to be in full control when they poured in 65 points in the first half to lead by 13 points. The Hornets saw all their hard work go to waste in the second half where they scored just 29 points to allow the Pistons off the hook in the end. The Hornets will face the Suns and Lakers following this one. 

Cleveland Cavaliers 

Meanwhile, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been on an absolute tear as they've reeled off 13 wins from their past 14 games and they will be gunning for a 10th straight victory after blowing past the Mavericks in a 134-122 road win on Friday. Evan Mobley led the team in scoring with 34 points, 10 rebounds, and four assists on 14 of 21 shooting, Caris LeVert added 17 points off the bench while Darius Garland chipped in with 16 points and nine assists. As a team, the Cavaliers shot 53 percent from the field and 15 of 40 from the 3-point line as they played excellent defense in the first quarter to jump out to an immediate double-digit lead. The Cavs just kept their foot on the gas until the lead ballooned to 27 points in the third quarter. The Cavs will take on the Thunder after this game.

Charlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers Prediction

The Hornets are still missing the injured LaMelo Ball, while the Cavaliers are still missing Isaac Okoro, and they have Sam Merrill as questionable for this one. Losing streak meetings winning streak as the lowly Hornets attempt to take down the surging Cavaliers, who have barely missed a step over the past three weeks. The line was always going to be massive for this one, but I still don't think it's enough to sway me from backing the Cavaliers to stay hot with another win and cover at home in this one.
