Cam Whitmore scored 18 points off the bench and teamed with Alperen Sengun to lead a decisive second-quarter run that helped the Houston Rockets to a 110-99 victory over the visiting Dallas Mavericks in the NBA on Wednesday.

Sengun tallied 23 points, six rebounds, four assists and five steals as Houston rebounded after dropping the first two games of a five-game homestand. Momentum flipped in the second quarter when Whitmore and Sengun combined to score 20 points during a 23-4 run that turned a 10-point deficit into a 53-44 lead.
