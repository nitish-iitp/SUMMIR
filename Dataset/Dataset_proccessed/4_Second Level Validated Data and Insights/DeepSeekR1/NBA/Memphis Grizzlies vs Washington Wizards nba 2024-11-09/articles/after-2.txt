How many points did Zach Edey score tonight? Memphis Grizzlies vs Wizards box score
Damichael Cole, Memphis Commercial Appeal
Sat, Nov 9, 2024·1 min read

Friday's game was different for Memphis Grizzlies center Zach Edey. For the first time in his brief NBA career, the rookie came off the bench.

He checked into the game with 8:15 left in the first quarter and quickly made an impact in the Grizzlies' 128-104 win over the Washington Wizards.

Playing the Wizards meant going against one of the NBA's most physical centers in Jonas Valanciunas. Edey and Valanciunas had to be separated and received double technical fouls at one point when things got too physical.

Edey filled the stat sheet on Friday night with 3-pointers, blocks, rebounds and free throws.

Here is how Edey fared against the Wizards.

Zach Edey's stats vs. Wizards

Points: 14

FG: 5-for-8

3PT: 1-for-2

FT: 3-for-3

Rebounds: 8

Assists: 2

Steals: 1

Blocks: 2

Turnovers: 3

Fouls: 3

Minutes: 21:43
