Tuesday's 118-97 loss to a Dallas Mavericks team that was without Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving may have been the worst so far this season for the Los Angeles Lakers. Whether they played down to the level of their competition or simply got beat on strategy or athletic ability, it was an inexcusable loss that greatly cooled off the momentum they had been building over the last few weeks.

They have now lost three of their last five games, and they're in danger of ultimately failing to take advantage of this favorable part of their schedule.

One of several Lakers players who didn't play up to his ability was guard Austin Reaves, who shot just 5-of-14 from the field and had just one assist. After the game, he didn't mince words about how poorly he played.

Just days ago, Reaves was in the middle of a stretch of games in which he turned in some of the best performances of his career so far. He has now shot just 36.7% from the field in his last four games, and the periodic fluctuation in his shooting efficiency this season has continued unabated.
