Recap/Analysis: Miller and Melo power Hornets past Pacers

Brandon Miller dominated the third quarter and LaMelo Ball dominated the fourth as the Charlotte Hornets came form behind to beat the Indiana Pacers, 103-83.

THE SUMMARY

The Hornets played some pretty offensive basketball in the first quarter. Brandon Miller and LaMelo Ball made a few smooth driving finger rolls while the 3-point shots weren’t falling. Tre Mann had a stretch where he went on a personal 8-0 run to force a Pacers timeout. The Pacers responded with their own run, and the Hornets led by three after the first quarter.

The second quarter was very not pretty. The Hornets kept finding themselves in late shot clock situations that forced desperation shots that didn’t go in. Their defense forced the Pacers into a similar spot. The one real highlight of the quarter was LaMelo Ball swatting away a Myles Turner shot that led to a run out. He probably should have been given a flagrant foul for getting wrapped up by Jarace Walker, but he didn’t. Tyrese Haliburton had a nightmare quarter with a missed layup, missed dunk, near turnover, and offensive foul in about a two minute span. Both teams had some really sloppy turnovers and ugly misses in a quarter that featured just 33 combined points. It was tied at the half. The Hornets didn’t make a field goal for the final five minutes of the quarter.

LaMelo Ball made a floater on the first Hornets possession of the second half, but that was the only make in a span of 17 attempts that bridged the second and third quarters. A Pacers barrage built up a lead as large as 13 right around the midway point of the third quarter, but that seemed to trigger a Hornets run. They clamped down on the defensive end while Brandon Miller caught fire on offense and got a little help from Tre Mann and Cody Martin. Miller ended up with five 3-pointers and 17 points in the third quarter alone as a 23-2 Hornets run gave them an eight point lead heading into the fourth.

Miller sat to start the fourth. It took a little bit for the Hornets to get the offense going again, but once LaMelo Ball saw a couple of free throws go in, he started his own outburst to put the game away. He scored every way possible—free throws, 3-pointers, and beating defenders one on one. He was the catalyst for a 21-4 Hornets run to end the game.

THE GOOD

The Hornets defense was incredible, especially in the second half. The Pacers, who are normally one of the better teams in the league at generating quick, easy looks, were frequently up against the shot clock and couldn’t find an easy shot attempt. They were run off the 3-point line and funneled into crowds where the Hornets could get hands on dribbled and passes. The Hornets earned the 83 points allowed. They allowed just 57 points in the final three quarters.

Brandon Miller and LaMelo Ball were the superstars the Hornets need them to be. The offense bogged down through the middle of the game, but Miller got it untracked in the third quarter. LaMelo took over when he took a breather to start the third and reinforced his NBA best fourth quarter scoring average.

Moussa Diabate is on the floor to play defense and get rebounds, and that’s what he did. He attempted one shot, but that was a putback on a rebound. He grabbed 15 rebounds, blocked three shots, and poked away a steal. He struggled to catch a couple of passes, but he got his hands on a ton of rebounds and loose balls. He is now the franchise record holder for rebounds in a game without a made shot.

Cody Martin had another really strong game. He looks like an entirely different player on the offensive end of the floor in terms of confidence. He had another 15 point game off the bench.

Tre Mann had another great game off the bench, especially in the first half. He made some tough shots when the offense was otherwise bogged down.

He didn’t do much on offense, but Josh Green was an absolute lockdown defender when he was on the floor.

THE BAD

Not a lot. The offense was rough in the first two-and-a-half quarters, but the Hornets figured out in time to run away with the win.

WHAT’S NEXT

The Hornets visit a 1-7 76ers team that’s missing its two best players.

Last night was a weird game from Haliburton. Dude is having an off start to the season but it’s weird seeing a guy whose typically level headed to play so out of control last night. Like he was trying to do too much at certain points

I’m admittedly extremely biased here, but I really struggle to understand this so-called Melo/Haliburton rivalry. Doesn’t seem like a fair fight from my vantage point. I get that last night was really a really bad outing for him.

Great surge by “the good guys” in the second half. Ball and Miller are certified studs.

Went to the game. One thing for sure, Melo is stronger and can handle contact much better, when Brandon gets stronger those 2 will be a handful. Coach Lee has Melo and Mann attacking the paint more putting pressure on the defense, we shoot a lot of 3s but not living on the perimeter as much. I’ve forgotten just how good a defender Martin is. Diabate needs to be our C3. Sign that guy to a 3 year minimum deal. He plays his role, solid D and grab boards. Green is a solid defender, don’t know what’s happened to his shot. I’ll take Williams over PJ all day, not as explosive offensively, much more engaged on defense. We need a big, don’t think Mark will ever be available for 90% of the season. Last night was encouraging. In the past we would never recover in the 3rd quarter, Brandon absolutely dominated the last 5 minutes. Taj can’t keep up anymore, he’s just too slow.

Why do you (and plenty of other guys) seem to think Mark won’t be available? I get that he hasn’t been playing much, but it’s not like he’s had a horrible injury like torn ACLs, MCLs, etc. His recovery time has been really slow, so I’m not encouraged by that either. But I don’t know how you guys are seeing into the future by saying Mark will never be healthy for a full season. It may be proven true, but aren’t we just depressed that he hasn’t played and being overly negative?

It is not uncommon for big men to have their careers ended before they ever really begin due to injuries. Here’s hoping MW beats the odds.

I think the reason to worry is if he has to have several surgeries to the same joint, or his back. It sounds so far that it’s mostly been a long rehab plan that is making him seem injury prone.

I agree that surgeries would be a more concerning result of an injury for a player.

I’m all for trying to prevent career altering injuries, but I think the question is: at what point is cautiously bringing a player back simultaneously altering the career?

I know that there is not an alternate reality to compare cautious and cavalier rehabbed Mark, but regardless, logic dictates that a cautious approach all but guarantees a level of unavailability. Regardless of if the player is Mark Williams or Joel Embiid, unavailability leads to both individual and collective unreliability. Whether labeled “injury-prone” or “load-management”, the player is factually unreliable as a starting NBA center at this point.

What should be the measure of reliability for a starting NBA center? I think the most charitable definition would be starting at least 50% of a player’s time on a roster and team games played to that relative point of the season with at least 24.1 Min/G.

Is that a cautionary tale or something to aspire towards? Embiid started his career slowly due to injuries, and has never come close to playing a full season…but has been an MVP and finished second 2 other times. If Mark has half of the impact as Embiid, most of us would take that in a heartbeat.

I want Mark to succeed. The guy gets hurt and it takes him a long time to recover. I wasn’t comparing his game to Embiid, which it will never be. I was comparing his recovery time to Embiid.

Vucevic is an aging center that doesn’t play defense. Valanciunas, also aging, also not a good defender. It’s better to go with the defensive-minded bigs that we are developing, to complement Melo and Miller.

Even with a losing record, Hornets are now tied for fourth place in the eastern conference. In related news, the eastern conference is really weak this year.

Melo went 10/29, 5/18 from three, and was a -8 on the night. Yet he looked great, got big buckets, and created a gaudy stats line. Go figure!

Yeah, we’ll see if it was a fluke poor performance by Indiana or if we can clamp down on high powered offenses with regularity.

It will be phenomenal if this becomes a trend, but I wouldn’t count on it.

What are the rules in the league with the number of 10-day contracts that can be given to one player in a season?

My top three are Moses Brown, Biz and McGee.

Moses Brown: 25 year old, 7′ 2″, 260 lb, 7′ 5″ wingspan, 9′ 5″ standing reach. Free agent affiliated with the Knicks’ G-L team, he has excellent size at C.

Veteran of 5 seasons, 150 NBA games, 44 started, in the NBA. He’s been a highly productive player: per 36 minutes he averages 16p, 15r, 1.7b, 1 stl, but only .5 assists, and 1.7 turnovers and 4.4 fouls.

Advanced stats career average: PER: 18.6, True Shooting 57.3%, BPM -2.9.

Given his youth, size and production in the league so far, I’d bring him in for an extended look, and if he’s playing ball at the level he has in the past or better, I’d sign him to a team friendly multi-year minimum contract. He could turn into a half decent asset for us, if he enters his prime and levels up a bit, which is entirely possible at his age.

Biz would give us a big, competent defensive center who has limited ability on offense. He’s kinda like Diabate, but bigger, older and more experience. Gotta love Biz.

McGee is long, experienced and has continued to produce at a high level per minute in recent years. But, he’s 36-37 years old this year and so is at increased risk of decline or injury.

And then again, our emergency plan of Gibson, Diabate and Grant at C has actually looked okay recently. Diabate in particular looks like he could be our C3, and we already have him under contract on a 2-way, which is highly team-friendly. If he has to play too much of the season, though, he’ll have to be signed to a regular contract, and I’d make it a multi-year team-friendly minimum or near minimum contract, if he’d accept it.

Fun couple of wins. This one vs the Pacers was a spectacle! Defense + offense = win.

Diabate! So nice to see someone stepping up off the deep bench when called up.

Props to CoMart for resurrecting his career and playing at a new peak at age 29.

That shooting display by Miller in the 3rd was special. Melo has leveled up with better driving and defense. He should be lock for All Star if he can stay healthy.

Haliburton earned his accolades over the last two years. I don’t know how anyone can deny his accomplishments last year, leading the Pacers into conference finals and leading the league in assists at age 23-24 while scoring a very efficient 20 ppg. Don’t know what’s up with him this year: very rough 9 game stretch, and last night was one of his worst performances of the year.

I guess we can give some credit to Josh and Cody for Haliburton’s bad night? Am I right thinking they had primary cover on him? I wasn’t paying close attention to that matchup.

I think this is actually working out splendidly. Cleveland is a cursed franchise. Imagine having Lebron James for 11 seasons and only mustering a single NBA championship. Do we really think Kenny Atkinson can right decades of futility?

While no game is meaningless, every game rises with consequence as we get closer to the playoffs….so sure let him be undefeated for the least consequential games of the season. Run up the score on the Raptors, Pistons, and Wizards. Capitalize on the Bucks and Lakers still trying to find their rhythm. Grit out an OT win against tanking teams – I’m sure the heavy minutes given to Mitchell, Mobley, Allen, and Garland won’t come back to haunt this team later on…

The biggest failures are those with the most to lose. This start has more ingredients of a failure than it does a 74-win season.

Very fair and valid points.

I think we ultimately got our guy in Coach Lee (and so far splendid new management/FO), but I still think/thought Atkinson was a HR hire for this club.

MJ will continue to be mocked for his futility as an owner, but the effort was truly there mostly. Atkinson screwed us big time. Miles set us back too. Just a horrendous summer a few years ago.

I think it shed a bit of light onto the problems of our org and maybe helped spur MJ to sell. But I can’t help but think of how different the last two years are with him instead of Cliff pt. deaux

As evidenced by his opting out of being in Charlotte and this effort to remain undefeated – Atkinson seems to be a fragile man motivated by hubris and ego. As I’ve observed him since his choice to flake, I grow in certainty that his initial hiring here was symptomatic and indicative of our problems rather than a cure to them.
