Fantasy picks and betting tips for Monday's NBA slate
De'Aaron Fox has been on fire over his last two games. Can you trust him to make it three phenomenal outings in a row? AP
Andre Snellings, ESPN
Nov 18, 2024, 01:32 PM ET

The NBA tips off action for this week with eight games, putting just over half the league on the court for Monday. As always, every game has storylines.

The Chicago Bulls got throttled by the Houston Rockets on Sunday and now have to turn around and travel to see the surprisingly solid Detroit Pistons. Those Rockets travel to Milwaukee to face a Bucks team that may be struggling, but is still led by a superstar in Giannis Antetokounmpo, who may just drop 50 or a triple-double in any given game.

The last time the Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings faced off, Trae Young and De'Aaron Fox combined for 56 points and 15 assists. Of course, over his last two games, Fox has scored 109 points -- by himself!!! This seems like a game where fireworks could happen.

There are plenty of other stories to watch on today's schedule, but we should probably move on. You'll have to wait until tomorrow to talk about the Cleveland Cavaliers' chances at surpassing the 1994 Rockets and 1949 Capitols to become only the second team in NBA history to win their first 16 games of the season.

That's tomorrow's excitement. However, there's a lot of exciting action on Monday's slate. Let's dig deeper into the matchups and identify some fantasy streamers and betting angles for you to consider.

Monday's Stream Team
Jared McCain, Philadelphia 76ers (available in 62.9% of ESPN leagues)
It's not too late to play for free

There's still time to join or create a league in the No. 1 Fantasy basketball game. Your league starts fresh on the first scoring period following your draft.

McCain is in the midst of a scoring explosion that is seeing him soar to the top of the NBA Rookie of the Year race. McCain has taken advantage of the 76ers' vacuum in perimeter scoring/creation with Tyrese Maxey out, and is showing he has the ability to thrive in that role on a nightly basis. Over his past four games (two of them starts), McCain has averaged 28.3 PPG, 4.5 APG, 4.5 3PG and 2.3 RPG in 32.5 MPG with at least 23 points scored in all four games. He should be universally rostered right now, and should be expected to continue his scoring ways on Monday against the Miami Heat.

Malik Beasley, Detroit Pistons (88.3% available)

Beasley has his shot working these days, and has stepped in as the starting shooting guard for the Pistons with Tim Hardaway Jr. (hand) out. Over Beasley's past six games (three of them starts), he has averaged 21.7 PPG, 5.0 3PG, 4.2 RPG and 1.7 APG in 33.2 MPG. He aims for his sixth 20-point effort in seven games on Monday against the Bulls.

Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks (71.5% available)

Okongwu is in the midst of another surge, with back-to-back double-doubles and averages of 13.0 PPG, 10.0 RPG, 1.3 BPG and 1.3 SPG in 28.3 MPG coming off the bench over his past three outings. Okongwu has been outplaying starter Clint Capela for some time now, and seems destined to eventually take over the starting position. Still, even off the bench, he's doing enough on a nightly basis to be worthy of a fantasy hoops roster spot on Monday against the Kings.

Snellings' bets for the day

Odds by ESPN BET

Jared McCain over 20.5 points (-125)

Fantasy basketball risers and fallers: Bub Carrington, Brook Lopez heading in different directions
55dSteve Alexander

It's rare for a player to be listed in both the "streamers" and the "bets" sections of this article, but McCain has earned that. His line for Monday doesn't seem to have caught up with how consistent and dominant his scoring has been of late. McCain hasn't just averaged 28.3 PPG over his past four games. He has also shot 50.6% from the floor and 43.9% from downtown over this stretch. He has at least 23 points in all four games, and could be leaned upon even more heavily on Monday if Joel Embiid sits due to his illness. This kid is a "walking bucket" right now.

De'Aaron Fox over 33.5 points (-110)

Fox is zoning right now, and has easily elevated his scoring to video game levels with his star teammates out. He dropped 60 points on Friday in the first game that DeMar DeRozan (back) sat out, then followed that by dropping 49 points on Saturday with both DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis (back) sidelined. DeRozan and Sabonis are both out again on Monday and Fox is facing a Hawks team he already sliced up for 31 points in their previous meeting. That was in a game where DeRozan and Sabonis both played. Fox has taken a whopping 65 shots over the past two games. He should continue to get plenty of looks and post another big scoring number on Monday.

Cade Cunningham over 6.5 rebounds (-120)

I've actually been betting the over for Cunningham in both rebounds and assists (over 9.5, -110), as well as the combo (over 16.5 total rebounds and assists, even) for more than a week now. All three have been hitting on just about an every-game basis. Over his past eight games, Cunningham has averaged 10.4 APG and 8.8 RPG (19.2 R+A). He has gone over 6.5 rebounds in seven of those games, over 9.5 assists in six of those games (with nine assists in both of the other two), and over 16.5 combined in six of those games (with 16.0 combined in both of the other two). Cunningham is rock-solid consistent right now, and I look for more of the same against the Bulls on Monday.

Bennedict Mathurin over 27.5 total points and rebounds (-115)

Outside of a blip against the Heat on Friday (8 points, 4 rebounds in 29 minutes), Mathurin has been consistently stellar as a scorer and rebounder for weeks now. Over his past nine games, he has averaged 21.9 PPG and 8.6 RPG (30.5 P+R) with four double-doubles. He has gone over this total in five of his past six games and has a strong chance to surpass that number again versus the Raptors on Monday.
