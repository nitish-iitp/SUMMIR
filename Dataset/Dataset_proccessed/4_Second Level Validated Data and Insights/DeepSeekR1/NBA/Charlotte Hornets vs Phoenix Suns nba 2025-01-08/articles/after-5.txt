The 2025 NBA trade deadline plans to bring a lot of fireworks, mainly due to the ongoing Jimmy Butler saga playing out in the public eye.

As the Miami Heat field incoming trade offers for their disgruntled star, other teams prepare to pick directions. Will you be a buyer or seller? What other avenues can be explored?

For the Charlotte Hornets, who currently own an 8-27 record, they are prepared to deploy their exact same strategy from the offseason. According to a league source, Charlotte is ready to help facilitate potential trades around the Association in exchange for future draft capital.

This path is already how Charlotte obtained additional assets from the summer in two transactions: three-second round picks and intriguing young wing Josh Green just to help other organizations shed unwanted contracts.

Although the Hornets do not possess cap space to absorb additional salaries, like the Detroit Pistons do with $14 million, they have a few different players under value contracts who hold value around the NBA.

Charlotte has received exploratory interest from contending teams on a few veterans: Cody Martin and Nick Richards. Both being under contract through the 2025-26 season, Charlotte is listening to offers for the right value. The Hornets are also opening to moving veteran backup point guard Vasilije Micic, especially as they prepare to potentially pay upcoming restricted free agent Tre Mann.

The Hornets’ ideal outcome for their disappointing 2024-25 season would be landing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Duke freshman wing Cooper Flagg, who many executives league-wide view as the consensus No. 1 overall pick, has the potential to help jumpstart an organization like Charlotte alongside LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller.

In the role of a facilitator, a team like Charlotte looms large for other deals around the NBA to help being completed. If the Hornets are able to net what they feel is adequate draft value for taking on a contract, they will capitalize on the opportunity.

For a team like the Phoenix Suns, who are openly and desperately shopping Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkic, Charlotte could come into the picture as a savior of sorts.

The problem here, especially as it relates to Beal, is what the going rate would be take on his massive remaining contract through 2026-27. This season, Beal makes $50.2 million before it goes up to $53.7 million and $57.1 million in a player option year he will absolutely pick up.

Two league executives who spoke to me recently suggesting Phoenix will have to somehow find another future first-round pick to offload Beal, because his value is at an all-time low due to a dip in production and what is viewed as the worst contract in the NBA.

Other teams who could be relieved by the presence of Charlotte as a facilitator are the Bucks, Kings, Lakers and Warriors. These four teams are viewed around the Association as some of the most aggressive teams in the trade marketplace early on.

Over the next month, keep an eye on the Hornets potentially wheeling and dealing to improve their long-term standing.

While it might not be splashy transactions, a team like Charlotte will be key to help other deals get over the finish line before February 6th.
