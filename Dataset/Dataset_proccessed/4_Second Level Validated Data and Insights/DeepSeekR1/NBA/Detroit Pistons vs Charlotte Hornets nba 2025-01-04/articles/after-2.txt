 akash upadhyayJanuary 4, 2025

The Detroit Pistons secured a 98-94 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night, propelled by Tobias Harris’ double-double performance of 24 points and 10 rebounds. The win marks Detroit’s fifth victory in their last six games, showcasing a strong team effort despite the absence of starting guard Jaden Ivey, who is sidelined with a fractured left fibula.

Cade Cunningham contributed 18 points for the Pistons, while Malik Beasley added 12 points off the bench. Tim Hardaway Jr. chipped in with 11 points, and Jalen Duren provided a solid presence in the paint, adding 10 points and 14 rebounds.

The Hornets, who have been struggling with a nine-game losing streak and 17 losses in their last 18 games, were led by Miles Bridges with 20 points, nine rebounds, and five assists. Mark Williams also contributed with 18 points and nine rebounds in the losing effort.

The game remained close throughout, with the Hornets holding a narrow 47-46 lead at halftime. Charlotte finished the second quarter with an 18-6 run, taking advantage of Cunningham being sidelined due to foul trouble. Seth Curry sparked the rally with a three-point play, and Bridges capped off the run by picking off a pass and hitting a 31-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer.

Despite the late surge from Charlotte, the Pistons maintained their composure in the second half to seal the victory. With this win, Detroit continues to show resilience in the absence of key players and keeps their momentum going as they push forward in the NBA season.
