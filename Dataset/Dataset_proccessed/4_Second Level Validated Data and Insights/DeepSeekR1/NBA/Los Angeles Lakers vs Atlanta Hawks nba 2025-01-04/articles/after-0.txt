With a refreshed LeBron James, Lakers’ improved defense has turned around their season

LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick’s halftime message to his group on Friday versus the Atlanta Hawks was simple, but it resonated deeply with a team finally finding its stride and forging an identity: I don’t want to coach a good team. I don’t want to be a part of a good team. I want to be a part of a great team, and I believe this team can be a great team.

Despite the Lakers’ eight-point lead at intermission over the Hawks, who had beaten them in overtime nearly a month prior to cap the Lakers’ second disastrous road trip of the season, Redick was upset with his team’s disregard for the game plan’s details. And he believes those details will ultimately differentiate the Lakers between being a good team or a great one.

The Lakers shored up the areas of focus in the second half — their turnovers, transition defense and scheme against Hawks star Trae Young — en route to a 119-102 win to improve to 20-14 record-wise. Los Angeles has quietly won eight of 11 games and moved up to No. 4 in the West over the past month.

“We’re so much further along than we were on Oct. 22 (when the season started),” Redick said after the game. “So, I’m very encouraged — pleased is the wrong word because you can’t get pleased in this profession. You’re encouraged. And I’m encouraged by our group right now.”

One of Redick’s guiding principles as a coach is that a team will evolve multiple times throughout a season, so he believes a good coach must be willing to adapt to maximize the current version of a group.

And a great example of that philosophy is the Lakers’ past 11 games, during which they have improbably shifted from an offensive-minded group to a defensive-focused one. Over that span, they have posted the league’s 16th-best offense, fifth-best defense and ninth-best net rating. They’ve climbed from being a borderline Play-In Team (they were 12-11 prior to this run) to a team that would host a first-round playoff series if the postseason began on Saturday.

Through their first 23 games, the Lakers had the league’s 26th-ranked defense — a looming death knell for their season. No team with serious aspirations can achieve anything of consequence being a bottom-five team on either side of the ball. But through a tweak of their base scheme, an engaged Anthony Davis, a rejuvenated LeBron James, Max Christie’s emergence and a shift within the rotation to prioritize defensive-leaning players, the Lakers have corrected course well enough to turn their weakness into their strength.

“I think the guys have a very solid understanding that if you don’t defend, you’re not going to play,” Redick said pregame.

This stretch also coincides with the trade the Lakers made on Dec. 29 to bolster their defensive versatility, size and length by swapping D’Angelo Russell and Maxwell Lewis and three second-round picks for Dorian Finney-Smith and Shake Milton, who came from the Brooklyn Nets.

Finney-Smith has fit in seamlessly, defending Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, Anfernee Simons, Trae Young and Jalen Johnson across three games. He’s led the bench in plus-minus in each appearance, making his mark as a utility player who does all the little things that compound and amplify whatever lineup he’s in. The 31-year-old forward has brought a toughness and physicality the group needed by committing hard fouls (on and off the ball), pestering opponents and making things difficult for them.

“I think Doe — his spirit, talk, leadership, all that stuff — he’s got a natural gift for that,” Redick said pregame. “Guys respect him because he plays hard. He’ll continue to evolve as an offensive player/defensive player matchup-wise. Really excited about what a month looks like from now, versus putting any sort of pressure on him to make a massive impact. But like I said before, his impact is not going to necessarily be in the box score every night.”

The Lakers’ defensive shift has not come without some offensive trade-offs. They reduced Russell’s role, both from a minutes and usage perspective, before trading him. Rookie Dalton Knecht, a glaring defensive liability at times, has seen his minutes decrease over the past month as the Lakers have leaned more into the defense of Max Christie, Gabe Vincent and Cam Reddish on the perimeter. On offense, the supporting cast has been less reliable, with role players vastly fluctuating in shot attempts, points and usage nightly.

Los Angeles’ offense has condensed into relying more on James, Davis and Reaves, with no better example than against Atlanta. James had 30 points (on 13-of-20 shooting) and eight assists, Reaves contributed 20 points (on 6-for-18 shooting) and six assists and Davis added 18 points (on 6-for-17 shooting). No other Laker attempted more than nine shots. Lately, there have been multiple games in scotch James, Davis and Reaves are the only double-digit scorers.

Nonetheless, it’s been working, at least enough for the Lakers to continue to rack up wins as they acclimate their new players and evaluate the roster. They have the league’s fourth-best offense over their past six games.

“I think our group is trending in that direction of being a good offensive team and a good defensive team,” Redick said. “I like where our defense is at right now. … So, I think both sides of the ball right now are trending to be a great team. Generally speaking, you need to be pretty good at both. Obviously, if you’re elite at one, you can get away with being average (at the other), but very rarely can you get away with being sh—y at one. So, we’re constantly striving to be better on both ends of the ball.”

James, especially, has been on an offensive tear lately. He’s scored 30-plus in four of his past six games, his best such stretch this season. Over that span, he’s averaging 30 points and 8.8 assists (with only 2.4 turnovers) on 59.0-55.2-88.9 shooting splits. That level of efficiency isn’t sustainable, but James is far removed from his career-worst shooting slump from earlier in the season.

His 30 points against the Hawks also pushed him past Michael Jordan for the most 30-point games in NBA history (563), with his 30th point poetically coming on a turnaround fadeaway. James said he was humbled to set the record and pass his childhood idol.

“It’s someone I idolized in my childhood, and I wear 23 because of him,” James said. “So, to know that I can sit here and be in the room or in the conversation or whatever it is, when you mention MJ, it’s just super-duper dope for me, being a kid from where I’m from.”

The Lakers aren’t content with their recent surge, focusing on the process more than the results. While there has been a lot of improvement, there’s still room for significant growth on both sides of the ball. The offense can struggle with turnovers, stagnancy and cold stretches. Their defense can be exploited in transition, by quick perimeter scorers and on the offensive glass.

“I mean, we’re a ways, to be honest with you,” Reaves said of becoming a great team. “But everybody’s working in the right direction to becoming that.”

As the Lakers evaluate their roster over the next few weeks ahead of the Feb. 6 trade deadline, they will identify which positions and skill sets they will prioritize on the trade market. A better backup center has been a need dating back to the summer. With the loss of Russell, and the recent over-reliance on James and Reaves, there’s a case to be made they could use another perimeter ballhandler and shot-creator. And the group could always use more length and athleticism on the wing.

The next measuring stick will be early next week as the Lakers head out on the road for their only two games outside of California until the end of the month. They face the Houston Rockets (22-12) on Sunday and the Dallas Mavericks (20-15) on Tuesday in two important games with standings implications.

“We know the potential that we have in this group,” Davis said. “We just got to do it on a night-in, night-out basis.”
