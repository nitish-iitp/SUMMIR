Kings 114, Celtics 97: I still can’t believe that happened
The Kings won in convincing fashion to extend the win streak to 6 games.

The Sacramento Kings traveled East for a matchup against the Boston Celtics, but were once again without De’Aaron Fox. The Kings and Celtics played a close, hard-fought, entertaining game through three quarters, and entered the final period with the game tied at 76. That alone would have made me happy, even if the game resulted in the defending NBA champions, who were at full strength, buckling down and handling their business and securing a win on their home court. Instead, it was the Kings flipping the script, buckling down, and beating the Celtics at their own game. The fourth quarter began with Devin Carter leading his own 8-2 run against the Celtics, bombing two rainbow threes and a layup, the only interruption being two Kristaps Porzingis free throws. The Kings never surrendered that lead, the Celtics never got closer than 5, and boos rained down in TD Garden as the Kings won the fourth quarter 38-21 en route to a 114-97 victory.

Carter played fantastic defense in this game that you won’t see in the box score, and ended with 11 points, 4 rebounds, and 1 assist. He played 17 minutes, some of which came as Keon Ellis’ expense. Ellis played 23 minutes, finishing with 6 points, 3 rebounds, 3 steals, 2 assists and 1 block. But there’s no minutes controversy here. Doug Christie shared after the game that he and Ellis were on the same page about allowing Carter to stay in the game because he was doing well (2:30 mark of the video):

I can’t believe I’m this far into this recap without mentioning Domantas Sabonis. Domas was an absolute monster in this game, finishing with 23 points and 28 rebounds. Domas was physical inside and gobbled up rebounds, included 8 offensive boards. The Kings gave Domas plenty of opportunity for offensive rebounds, as there were several stretches where the Kings went cold as a team, but the defense forced similar cold stretches for Boston throughout the game so it balanced out. A big key that I noticed and that Doug talked about after the game (about 1:24 in the above video) was getting Domas to stop complaining to the refs as much, and it’s a welcome change. I know Mike Brown asked for it as well, but the message coming from Doug is working so far.

Keegan Murray had a fantastic game, going 5-of-8 from three and finishing with 19 points, 3 rebounds, 3 blocks, and 2 steals. After the game Keegan talked about how Doug instills confidence in his players:

“Collectively, everything that we’ve been through in December [until] now is just 360,” forward Keegan Murray told reporters. “He’s a coach that instills confidence in every player. Whether you make a mistake or you don’t, whether you make a good play or things like that, he’s going to stay confident in you. With that, the rest of the year that’s huge for us and our confidence going forward.’

DeMar DeRozan and Malik Monk both struggled with their shooting, but both players shot through their slumps, while also sharing the ball. DeRozan finished with 24 points on 26 shots, but also had 9 assists, 4 rebounds, 1 steal and 1 block. Similarly, Monk had 22 points on 24 shots, but added 8 assists, 3 rebounds, 1 steal, and 1 block.

It was an incredible win for the Kings to go into Boston and win in such a convincing fashion. The Kings have now won 6 straight games and are back to .500 for the season. The win brings the Kings up the standings to the 9th seed, and the Kings are 3.5 games back from the 4th seed.

Up Next: The Kings have an early game against the Chicago Bulls on Sunday, tipping off at 12:30 PM PT.

It’s wild how this team can go from a 6 game tailspin to a 6 game dominance, back to back. What is the true identity of this team? I’d like to hope it’s what we’ve seen over the last 6 games, and last night’s drubbing of Boston gives me that hope, but I imagine they are realistically somewhere better than they were to end 2024, but not as good as they have started 2025. A .500 team is still the vibe I’m picking up.

It’s wild, right? You might expect that from team that was missing it’s star player while losing 6 straight, to winning 6 straight after he returned. The Kings did it back asswards. Unless Doug Christie is the second coming of Erik Spoelstra, I can’t explain it.

Irrelevent to the point, but interesting to note that in reading Heat forums, many fans seem to be pretty down on Spoelstra. They find him rigid and uncreative in his rotations and stick with certain players at the expense of younger players who should be getting more minutes. They call him ‘Spobot’. Sounds like some of our complaints with MB. Not that I think he’s in the hot seat or anything, and fans will forever question the coach’s decisions, but I thought it was intersting how the national narrative differs from fans’ options.

Over the last few years he has had to play 2-way guys, 10 day contract players, and g league players because that team hasn’t stayed healthy. Now they have Jimmy to deal with.

Two weeks ago I shifted to a “no expectations” mode. I am still there. On the other hand, this is what I saw in the beginning of the year- or at least what could happen. Losing all the pre-season was not a concern then but should have been a red flag.
These guys are playing free and almost reckless.
Carter has been good and still has flaws. James Hamm worries about the form on his shot but there are quite a few players with low release on 3- Deerick White for one.
LTB chant in both GS and Boston- that has caught on in all arenas. Nice!
There are still roster imbalances. Will Monte address that? or just ride with this vibe?
Alex Len has made a difference with rim protection- and would another more athletic big with rim protection help more? Nick Richards?
Last year Mavs made 2 big moves at this point and it helped.

I have been disappointed in James Ham and his podcast. He has shifted to blaming Monte for everything, Mike Brown wasn’t the problem, Carter won’t get his shot off, Ellis still has many flaws, etc. Just negative vibes from him all season.

Story time.

I used to work for MLB Advanced Media. We worked in the same building as NBC Sports Bay Area on 3rd St. in SF and when the Kings would play the Dubs, the broadcast team would roll up to the office early ahead of games.

One day, I had a Kings shirt on, was walking through the garage to go grab some food and I saw James Ham getting out of a car and walking to the elevator. I yelled “Let’s go Kings!” and he looked at me with what can best described as a mixture of fear and loathing. He put his head down and rolled on. I thought, “what a prick.” I mean, we sucked, I’m out here amid the W’s glory days repping the Kings and this buffoon can’t even crack a smile?

There’s more.

Right behind him, different car, Kayte Christensen gets out, along with Doug Christie (on the broadcast team at the time) and I shout “Sacramento!” Kayte looked at me like I just pissed in her Cheerios. Doug smiled, came up to me and dapped. I thought Doug was pretty goofy as a color analyst despite his occasional awesome insights (amid embarrassingly awkward catch phrases), but at that moment, I thought, “HELL YEAH!” As a fan since 84-85, it meant a lot to me that he gave me 3 seconds of his time and passed on some proper vibes to a freaky fan in the Bay Area who was randomly in a fucking garage he had to walk through to go do his work.

I guess what I’m saying is, James and Kayte are ding dongs and Doug is a dude that has something akin to self awareness, humility, and gave a damn for a sec to a struggling fan that silly, random day. I never forgot it, and I am rooting for him to continue this wild streak of what seems to be a karmic success.

I know James somewhat personally. He’s a good guy. Takes his craft seriously, and he is a self-made man in the industry – no one ever handed him anything. Good dad, FWIW.

I don’t know the circumstances that surrounded your interactions with James, but what you describe is not the James that I have known for the past 17 years. I’m sorry that you had a bad experience.

Coming from you, I hear what you’re laying down.

I’ll throw the petty feelings aside. I’m sure many people have had random interactions with me that left them thinking I’m a buffoon as well. Not that I’m not a buffoon.

My takeaway from this: What’s so funny about peace, love, and understanding?

Cheers, pantless one. You have always served up sneaky, random wisdom.

PS: in case there’s any question in the matter, I never peed in Kayte’s Cheerios

Grant was always the uber douche for me. Petrie & Adelman were cordial but very reserved when I crossed their wake. Carrill put a hand on my shoulder & I would have run through a wall for him – what charisma! Tyreke Evans was cool, Kenny Thomas was a little aloof, Paul Westphal was magnanimous. Brad Miller has always been super chill. Harold Pressley is genuine. Jerry Reynolds is the platinum standard. Joe Kleine gets the silver medal behind Jerry, and B-Jax & Corliss were nice guys as well.

What you wrote about Christie does not surprise me a bit. He would be on my short list of want to meets. I’d love to thank JT for 541 games. IT for standing up for Sac. Mitch Richmond for time served. Gregg Lukenbill for making it all possible.

Is that the same like turning the corner four times in a row?
Or has everything come full circle?

I hope his refound touch from distance will keep up.

First post this year. (I’ve been a Charger fan since the Kings were in Rochester, so forgive me if I’ve been distracted. Of course, that could end today…)

I want to highlight the story of DeMar digging up film of Doug Christie highlights and showing them to the team. That is veteran leadership right there. I wonder if the uppercut was included.

I hope Ellis remains starting when Fox returns. And I hope they can get some size without giving up Carter. But last nights game, wow!

I’m guessing that will be the case, but he numbers suggest that Keon should be getting close to 30+ minutes a game. The team just does considerably better when he’s on the court. I don’t see how that is going to be possible with a healthy Fox, Monk, Huerter, and now Carter. Just too many damn guards.

In my mind, Keon should be the one starting next to Fox. If the offense needs an uptick, bring in Monk. If more defense is needed, bring in Carter. Fox, Monk, and DDR together for long minutes just feel like too much redundancy and not enough defense.

I think we will be seeing more 3 guard lineups, with Ellis at SF for stretches.

With the current roster, play to their strength which is small, fast, and being disruptive to ball handlers. Some match-up won’t work well, but it’s what they have now.

Huerter for an Isiah Stewart type of guy would help balance things a bit, but I don’t see Huerter netting much.

Huerter is at about 24 minutes/game—all of which should be going to Keon. Another few minutes could come from DeRozan who is at 35.5 minutes/game and IMO should be closer to 32. That would at least get Keon into the high 20s.

Could be, but like Hobby said, that is playing a very small lineup. It may work in stints, but I feel the rest of the league will find a quick counter.

If the Kings put forth the same home win % as the average of the teams above them, they would be no worse than 5th in the West right now. If they can figure out a way to win 15+ of their final 19 home games, they could jump the play-in.

Just think about the last three games, all without Fox. Go into SF and beat the Dubs by 30, come back from 17 down in the 4th to beat a tough Heat team, then go to Boston and beat the defending champs by 17. I don’t know how sustainable this is but it’s been a crazy ride lately.

The team is riding a high, and that’s what we want to to continue to see. How they handle adversity- a loss, or two in a row, or more, is next.

Every game is going to bring forth an identity. Right now, I am most impressed with the defensive intensity and the consistent effort.

IF that continues, win or lose, they’ll be fine. My desire is to see a competitive squad- these guys, in this form, with this coach, at this time – are all that. (and a bag of chips would be nice too).

Get The Deus Ox-Machina, some frontcourt relief. Even machines can break down. We’ve seen the team do well with their backcourt star injured, because they have lots of backcourt. Sabonis goes down and it ain’t gonna be pretty.

“Rolling Boxcars” with back-to-back losing and winning streaks is extremely rare. Can’t recall ever seeing this in the NBA before. This looks like a completely different team, and the best the team has looked in any stretch since 2005-2006. I’m doubling down on the DC Kool Aid!

Len and Crowder provide some options for matching supersized lineups so I’m happy to have Crowder on the bench but unless there’s some immediate need to go in and do that I’m happier keeping Crowder on the bench.

This win is a huge statement that Coach DC is the difference maker. While I think the Kings offense looked stagnant at times, and they didn’t shoot the 3 particularly well especially after Q1, it’s all the little things that kept the Kings in the game and then allowed them to separate in Q4. I’m loving what I’m seeing, and I think this season is going to shape up far better than any of us imagined after the first 10 games.

I liked Mike Brown, but I’m glad to see him gone and Doug Christie in his place!

A great win for the Kings. But my feeling is it didn’t phase Boston much.

They are a perennial Contender every year. This game is just Boston grinding and playing bored thru the long season.
Boston, 6-6 over their last 12. They play like they really didn’t put forth much effort.
It was obvious on the court. You don’t allow a guy get 28 boards unless you’re half asleep. Which all I saw were numerous instances of Boston players just standing around and not being active and present on both sides of the ball.

The Kings played 3 solid quarters and ended up winning in a blow out.
An important win, as there was no letdown game.

Some Kings fans may be fooled into thinking the Kings are the same level as Boston because of one game. This i
completely disagree with.
I wouldn’t use this game as a barometer . Boston’s vet team in the playoffs would easily beat the Kings . Where Xs and Os would take precedence over this joy mentality. Boston would lock in.

Regular season victories are more important for some teams morE than others. The others: You know who they are they have already punched their ticket for the playoffs by Feb.That would easily be the Top 4 in both conferences

Playoff basketball is something entirely different and your weaknesses will be exposed and teams will be playing at this highest level.. Listenjng to Mazulla’s post game. He really was apathetic.
No panic, disparaging comments or worry.

Playoff exp does count.
SomeOther teams that have an established level of consistency, culture and winning in the playoffs.
Playing below expectations during the regular season is not a big deal.
At the end of the day a lot of these teams know they will get into the playoffs and the regular season is just a formality.

As an aside, this team could get radically better by trading Fox for more assets and young players.

Fox coming back means he will need max touches. Why? Money, All NBA, Super Ext. I may be in the zero minority. But Fox will want his touches when he gets back. The offense you saw the last 4 games will not be the same. I assure you if that.

A future starting backcourt of Carter and Ellis sounds pretty good to me.

That Hou for Sheppard, Whitmore and Smith plus picks will do it.
