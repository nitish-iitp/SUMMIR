Coup’s Notebook Vol. 81: Erik Spoelstra Sets The Board, Tyler Herro Puts Defenders In Jail, Haywood Highsmith Gets Creative, Devin Booker Continues A Long-Running Bit And Pelle Larsson Goes Shoulders First
Couper Moorhead
November 11, 202410:35 AM EST

The Miami HEAT are 4-5 after their last-second victory in Minnesota, with an Offensive Rating of 111.1 and a Defensive Rating of 112.4. With three games left on their road trip, here’s what we’ve been noting and noticing.

COVER ZERO

Want to see the exact moment Minnesota’s defense was in trouble on Miami’s last-second inbounds play?

It’s all in the setup, Erik Spoelstra lining up his pieces near midcourt – an alignment which has earned a handful of late-game layups in recent years, albeit more often when Miami was already leading and their opponent was playing for a steal – and drawing the defense away from the goal.

There’s no rule saying the Wolves must have all their defenders as far back as Miami is setup, but they followed suit. Sure, there’s an argument for making sure all your players are engaged and trusting your communication, for sticking to the truth of your defensive unit. Even with that said, think of this for a moment in football terms. Miami doesn’t quite need a hail mary, but the situation is a close facsimile of that, needing to get the ball into the scoring zone with time working against you. By setting up like this, Minnesota is not only effectively playing cover zero, no safeties back to defend over the top, they’re also in press coverage, all defenders attached at arm’s length.

Nickeil-Alexander Walker and Anthony Edwards mess up the switch on Rozier’s backscreen, no doubt, and without that snafu there would have been no pass to Nikola Jovic. That’s also exactly the point. Because Minnesota lined up the way they did they were already one mistake away from giving up a free route to the rim. The Wolves gave themselves just about zero margin for error. They had to be perfect.

It's a clever design, too, no doubt. Watch it in motion.

Rozier looping around gives him a chance to get into Edward’s blind spot, leaving everything up to communication. Even if the Wolves had managed that switch fine, Kevin Love was also giving a back-screen for Tyler Herro, springing Herro for a catch going downhill with a slower player in Julius Randle the only one available to step in. In another universe, Herro gets the catch, Randle can’t slide his feet with him and as Mike Conley comes off the inbounder, Duncan Robinson, to get in front of Herro, Robinson then has a free shot for the win.

In other words, Miami beat Minnesota with one permutation of a smart design but they very well could have done so with multiple others. All because Minnesota set themselves up on the razor’s edge.

1-2-3 GO TO JAIL

If Tyler Herro keeps playing like this we’re going to have many, many more opportunities and reasons to write about him, but there is one thing we need to point out forthwith.

Of the 33 players who have run at least 175 pick-and-rolls this season, Herro ranks at the No. 2 spot producing 1.27 points-per. That’s a gargantuan number. Now, that number also comes from tracking data and until you filter down it includes assist opportunities, meaning Herro’s teammates producing 1.59 points-per on his direct passes out of pick-and-rolls, 1.78 on 77 threes.

If you remove those assist opportunities a Herro pick-and-roll has been worth 0.95 points-per, still No. 22 among the 49 players who have used at least 50 actions and still the second-best mark of his career. You might be thinking that the efficiency is probably coming from the fact that Herro is shooting an incredible 45.1 percent from three. That isn’t the case, with only 19 of his threes coming in pick-and-roll actions. Instead, Herro has been highly efficient on two-pointers after using screens as he’s averaging 6.2 screens per 100 possessions that results in a paint attempt, a sizeable jump from his previous career high of 4.9 which came during his Sixth Man of the Year campaign in 2021-22.

He's doing it in a wide variety of ways – quick drives, quicker finishes, shot fakes, screen rejections, the works – but the most noticeable has been the physicality with which he’s putting his man in jail, using the Chris Paul move to keep defenders on his back as he probes the paint.

While it’s not likely that Herro, as it would not be likely for anyone else, continues to shoot this well from three, nor will he probably finish over 70 percent at the rim, this is less about percentages than it is about consistency across matchups. The more comfortable you get playing in tight spaces and through contact, the better you’ll be able to get to your shots against better, longer, more athletic defenders. And when you read those words, you think be thinking about the playoffs, about the postseason viability of Herro’s game, which he spent the summer thinking about after Boston, due to injuries to Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier, defended him as a primary option.

“I took a lot away from last year overall and last playoffs,” Herro said. “Being the first scoring option in that series, I definitely was guarded like that, from Jrue [Holiday] to Derrick White to Jaylen Brown just rotating different guys on me seeing multiple bodies at once. Being very physical off the ball, not letting me get comfortable and not letting me get into my game. I took a lot away from that, to be able to play with a guy leaning on me, a guy having their body on me their entire time and not taking their body off me, that’s something I worked on all summer, just trying to create different space without having the ball in my hands.”

Herro has put pressure on himself, through his own words, to prove what he can do in the postseason the last couple season. Injuries wiped out his chances two years ago and unfairly changed his role last year, but we also don’t need to wait until the playoffs to give him credit for changing his process and his game.

SLAPHAPPY

On another Herro note, he made what might be the best one-on-one defensive play of his career down the stretch against Sacramento, perfectly timing the rhythm of DeMar DeRozan’s shot as he stripped it going up.

Granted Herro had just fouled DeRozan for a four-point play the possession before – Herro had his arm slightly extended approaching a screen and DeRozan wisely made the veteran play to immediately shoot as he felt contact – so this was making up for that a bit, but it takes some gumption to follow up that foul with a swipe at the ball on a huge possession.

Teams aren’t going to stop chasing getting Herro on a switch late in games, but there was an interesting sequence down the stretch against Phoenix that’s worth taking another look at.

With Kevin Durant trying to shake Haywood Highsmith and get the Herro matchup, getting it on this play, Herro and Highsmith attempted a tricky ball-in-air switch to get Highsmith back on his mark before the catch is made. It doesn’t matter in the end because it’s Durant, and Durant can shoot over anyone. It remained a worthwhile attempt.

On the next possession Phoenix has Terry Rozier on Tyus Jones instead of Herro, this time with Herro on Bradley Beal. Instead of just giving the ball to Beal and letting him attack the matchup, Jones calls up Beal for a screen, draws the switch and then calls over Durant to try and get another switch. Herro and Highsmith don’t bite this time as Highsmith shows out on Jones, but because a show requires a recover and Durant is a threat to shoot from anywhere, Highsmith gets caught with a foul.

Better execution next time up for Miami, Highsmith knowing Jones is only looking for the matchup so he fakes the show and recovers out to Durant on the catch.

Again, it doesn’t matter because it’s Durant and there’s only so much you can do, but these are the late-game matchup manipulations and progressions which often decide games. Miami never stopped problem solving, Durant was merely too big, or too long, of a problem.

FOUR ON FOUR

While most of the league has wised up to not attacking Adebayo on switches – he’s defending 3.6 isolations per 100 possessions, in line with his career low rate last season, which is also affected by the amount of drop coverage Miami now plays and the other more attractive mismatch options their roster presents to opposing scorers – nobody has ever been more forward thinking about it than Devin Booker.

We’re thankful for it, frankly, because it’s always good for a laugh watching Booker identify the Adebayo switch and take himself entirely out of the play so the Suns can play four-on-four without him.

Booker first started doing this three seasons ago, back when Phoenix had entirely different personnel around him, and has continued ever since. As long as he keeps doing it, we’ll keep pointing it out.

SHOULDERS FIRST

We’ve talked about how Erik Spoelstra is clearly showing a degree of trust in rookie Pelle Larsson and how much his combination of shooting, cutting and more-physical-than-you-think defense fits right into what Miami wants to do.

What we haven’t talked about quite as much is how much contact Larsson actively seeks out when he puts the ball on the deck. He doesn’t add much in the way of flourishes to his ground game but ever since Summer League he’s shown an ability to drive a closeout and go right into the body of his defender, either bumping to create space or drawing enough contact to get himself to the line.

Here’s two of his drives against Phoenix this week:

These aren’t quite the bruising, weaponized drives that Jaime Jaquez Jr. showed off early in his own rookie season, but they are effective. Even if it’s only going to be two or three of these a game, with the right timing they can be possession-saving attack much in the same way that Caleb Martin could swing a sequence or two with timely aggression.

TIDBITS

-While the HEAT are only taking 28.6 percent of their shots at the rim this season, a number that would have been second fewest last season when Miami had the third-lowest mark at 28.5, they’ve also cut out the vast majority of their non-paint two pointers from their shot diet, just 4.5 percent of their total offense. That means they’re among the league leaders in upper paint shots along with corner three attempts, which is about in line with how things looked last year.

-As per usual, Miami is allowing one of the highest three-point rates in the league along with one of the lowest rim-attempt rates. As per usual, this is by design as it relates to the team’s defensive scheme.

-Minnesota scored just 0.87 points-per-possession against Miami’s zone Sunday night, as Miami ran that coverage 40 times including on 18 possessions in the fourth quarter. Miami, meanwhile, scored just 0.74 against Minnesota man-to-man in the halfcourt, their 26 fast-break points carrying the offense on a defensive-oriented night.

-Miami had 14 steals on their way to those 26 fast-break points. Minnesota had 13 steals of their own and yet generated just four fast-break points. That’s not a split you see every day.
