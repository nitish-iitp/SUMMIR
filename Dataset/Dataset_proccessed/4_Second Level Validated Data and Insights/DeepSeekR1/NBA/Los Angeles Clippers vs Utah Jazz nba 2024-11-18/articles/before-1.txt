James Harden now stands alone at No. 2 in 3-pointers.

Harden, the Los Angeles Clippers guard, connected on the 2,974th 3-pointer of his career on Sunday night and broke a tie with Basketball Hall of Famer Ray Allen for the No. 2 spot on the NBA's list.

Harden's history-making shot came with 6:09 left in the first quarter against the Utah Jazz, him connecting from the right wing. The only player ahead of Harden on the list is Golden State's Stephen Curry, who has made 3,782 3-pointers.

Harden also is 15th on the NBA's career list in points and 13th in assists. The only other player who ranks in the top 15 in scoring, assists and 3-pointers made — appearing on all three lists — is LeBron James, the league's career scoring leader who is fourth in assists and eighth in 3-pointers made.

Allen passed Reggie Miller for No. 1 on the 3-pointers made list during the 2010-11 season and held the record for more than a decade. Curry passed Allen during the 2021-22 season.
