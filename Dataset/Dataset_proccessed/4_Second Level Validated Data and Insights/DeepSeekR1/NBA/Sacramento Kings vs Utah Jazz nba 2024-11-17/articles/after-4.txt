De’Aaron Fox scored 49 points one night after he had a franchise-record 60 in an overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Sacramento Kings beat the visiting Utah Jazz 121-117 on Saturday.

Kevin Huerter added 18 points and Trey Lyles had 17 for the short-handed Kings, who sealed the win on Fox’s two free throws with 1.8 seconds remaining. His 109 points are the most over a two-game span in team history.

Fox was 16-for-30 from the field, 3-for-4 from 3-point range and 14-for-19 from the free-throw line. He had nine assists in a game that featured six ties and 14 lead changes.

Lauri Markkanen led Utah with 25 points. Keyonte George scored 19, Collin Sexton added 18, Jordan Clarkson finished with 17 and John Collins totaled 16.

The Jazz led by as many as 11 in the third quarter before the Kings battled back and tied the game at 107 on Huerter’s 3-pointer with 5:25 remaining in the contest.

Trailing 116-113 with 1:54 remaining, Sacramento scored five straight points on Fox’s jump shot and Jordan McLaughlin’s 3-pointer.

Fox converted 1 of 2 free throws with 38.8 seconds left to give the Kings a 119-116 lead. Clarkson made the first of two free throws with 3.2 seconds to go, and the Jazz failed to grab the rebound when he missed the second attempt intentionally.

Fox made three 3-pointers and scored 18 points on 7-of-7 shooting overall in the first quarter to give the Kings a 35-31 lead.

Sacramento extended its lead to 62-50 with 3:35 left in the second quarter before Utah closed the frame on a 13-2 run to pull within 64-63 at the half.

The Jazz carried the momentum into the third quarter and moved ahead 89-78 with 3:31 left before the Kings rallied to cut their deficit to 94-90 at the end of the period.

Sacramento played without Domantas Sabonis (lower back tightness), DeMar DeRozan (low back tightness) and Malik Monk (right ankle sprain).
