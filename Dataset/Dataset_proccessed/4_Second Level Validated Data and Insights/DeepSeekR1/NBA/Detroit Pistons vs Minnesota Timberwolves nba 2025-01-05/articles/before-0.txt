Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards dropped a career-high 53 points in Saturday's 119-105 loss to the Detroit Pistons.

Edwards also sank a personal-best 10 triples over the contest. He went scoreless over nine minutes in the fourth quarter until making a layup with 22.1 seconds left to reach the milestone.

No other Timberwolves player scored more than 17 points. Five players scored less than 10, with veteran guard Mike Conley recording zero.

The Pistons led by as much as 24 points in the contest.

Minnesota has now lost its last three games and six of its previous 10 to drop its record to 17-17 on the season.

Guard Cade Cunningham led Detroit with 40 points. Malik Beasley added 23 points off the Pistons' bench.

The Timberwolves host the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.
