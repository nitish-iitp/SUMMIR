Leonard Leaves Clippers After Family Evacuated in L.A.

The sports world, as a whole, is not immune from the natural disaster unfolding in Los Angeles.

Los Angeles Clippers superstar Kawhi Leonard has reportedly taken a leave of absence from the team to be with members of his family who were affected by the ongoing wildfires in the L.A. area.

NBA insider Chris Haynes broke the news Wednesday, noting that some of Leonard’s family was forced to pick up their lives and evacuate due to the wildfires.

The Clippers played on the road losing to the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night 126-103.

“You definitely have to take care of home. … Totally had my support 100%,” coach Tyronn Lue told reporters prior to tipoff. “Going back, checking on his family and kids, making sure they’re well. And he got back, and they’re doing OK, so just happy and thankful for that.”

Leonard, who purchased a house in one of the hardest hit areas, the Pacific Palisades in 2021, was set to play in his third game of the season against the Nuggets. The Clippers star made his season debut against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday, January 4 after missing the start of the season with inflammation in his surgically repaired right knee.

He is averaging 10 points in 20 minutes per game.
Elsewhere in the sports world, Wednesday night’s NHL game between the host Los Angeles Kings and Calgary Flames was postponed.

Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL released a statement Wednesday that said it “continues to closely monitor developments in the area and will remain in contact with both clubs and the NFLPA” ahead of Monday nights scheduled playoff game between the visiting Minnesota Vikings and Los Angeles Rams.

Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick told the media on Tuesday that members of his family were among those who evacuated their homes.

“I just want to acknowledge and send thoughts and prayers to everyone in the Palisades right now,” Redick said. “That’s where I live.

“Our family, my wife’s family, my wife’s twin sister, they’ve evacuated. I know a lot of people are freaking out right now, including my family. From the sound of things, with the winds coming [Tuesday night], I know a lot of people are scared. So, I just want to acknowledge that. Thoughts and prayers for sure, and hope everybody stays safe.”

According to CNN, tens of thousands of people were placed under mandatory evacuation orders across Los Angeles County because of multiple wildfires that were exacerbated by hurricane-force winds. Officials said at least five people have died and that number is expected to rise, while thousands of structures and acres have been destroyed.

As for Leonard, he returned to the Clippers’ lineup for Saturday’s game against the Atlanta Hawks and also played in Monday’s contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
