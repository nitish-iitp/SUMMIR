From Pune to Bangalore

That’s it for another day here on Al Jazeera’s 2023 Cricket World Cup live blog.

India with an expected win – perhaps a little more straightforward than expected.

It’s New Zealand up next for the hosts in Dharamsala on Sunday.

Many will view that as a warm-up for the final given they are the form teams so far.

For Bangladesh, they need to pick quickly against South Africa in Mumbai on Tuesday.

For our live blog, it’s on to Bangalore tomorrow and a massive mid-table clash between Pakistan and Australia.

We hope you’ve enjoyed today’s coverage and hope to see you all again tomorrow.

Goodbye!

‘I’m sure it will get louder and louder’: Rohit

India captain Rohit Sharma was beaming at the end after a comprehensive win – their fourth in four games.

“It was a good win. Something that we were looking forward to,” he said.

“We didn’t start off well but the guys pulled it back well in the middle and at the end.

“The last three games that we played, our fielding has been superb.

“It’s something that is in your control. You try to put in as much effort as you can and there was no letting down from anyone.

“The bowlers were pretty smart about the lengths to bowl.

“Hardik pulled up a bit sore but there is no major damage which is good news for us. We will assess it every day.

“Every game in the World Cup is a big game and everybody in the squad has gone through pressure, with stands being full, but it’s been special – everywhere we have played the crowd have not disappointed us.

“I’m sure it will get bigger and bigger and louder and louder as we move along.”

Batters ‘have to take responsibility’: Shanto

Bangladesh captain, Najmul Hossain Shanto, admits his side are coming up short at the moment.

“India are always a very good side and they are always very capable of playing well,” Shanto said.

“I feel we didn’t play our best game but we hope we will in future.

“We started well and if Tanzid and Das batted for a bit longer it would have been a different ball game

“We are not playing our best game. We have to take responsibility as a batting group so I hope so in the next match.”

Kohli is Player of the Match

Indian centurion, Virat Kohli, was understandably delighted with the win and his own performance.

“I wanted to make a big contribution,” he said.

“I’ve had a few fifties in World Cups but haven’t really converted them.

“I just wanted to finish the game off this time around and hang on to the end which is what I’ve done over the years for the team.

“It was a dream start for me with two no-balls and a four and a six. It just calms you down and gets you into the innings. It allowed me to play my game, hit the games and take the boundaries when needed.

“There’s a great atmosphere in the changing room, we are loving each others’ company, that’s why it’s translating like that on the field.

“It’s a long tournament and you need to create some momentum in the changing room for the guys to come out and play like this.

“It’s a special feeling playing home, playing in front of all these people so we just want to make the most of it.”

‘Kohli, Kohli, Kohli!’

The Pune crowd show their appreciation.

Bangladesh may have had a strong recent record against India but that was the hosts’ game from the fall of the first wicket this morning.

Rohit and Gill gave India a similarly perfect start to begin.

Kohli put his mark of class on the finish.

The bad news was the injury to Hardik and India will have to wait on the result of the scan on his ankle.

Bangladesh similarly were hurt by the injury to Shakib Al Hasan ahead of the game.

A century for Kohli and a win for India!

India win by seven wickets!

Kohli sends a six soaring over midwicket for his 48th ODI century.

That was breathtaking.

The manoeuvring of the ball to reach that century with time running out was the work of a true great of the game.

The crowd – needless to say – go wild!

Ninety-seven balls for the century and that was his fourth six.

Four from four for India!

41 overs. India 255-3

A wide for a bouncer that was too short from Hasan means it’s just seven to win and eight for the Kohli century.

In response he drops two to square.

Can Kohli do it?

An inside edge but Kohli survives. Dot ball.

Two more to midwicket off the fourth ball.

A master at work.

They reject the single to deep square off the fifth ball.

Single to end the over and Kohl keeps the strike on 97* with two to win for India.

Kohli is going for it!

India 249-3 after 40 overs.

Eight to win and eight for Kohli’s century.

He sweeps the first ball for four and then hammers a six over midwicket.

A single to end Nasum’s over.

Brilliant.

39 overs. India 238-3

Kohli goes big.

He slaps Hasan back over his head for six.

And then a classy single to end of the over.

He’s onto 81 and 19 to win – just saying!

38 overs. India 229-3

Spin was not meant to play a big role today, but it’s interesting that neither side went after them.

Miraz finishes with 47-2 from his 10.

Six singles off the over.

This fourth-wicket partnership is now worth 51 from 54 balls.
