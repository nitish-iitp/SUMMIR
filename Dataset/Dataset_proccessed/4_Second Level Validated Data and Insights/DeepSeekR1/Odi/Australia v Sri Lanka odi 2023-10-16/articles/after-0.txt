Thanks for joining me tonight!

Australia's win has lifted them to eighth on the ladder, but there are still plenty of matches to go.

Join me again on Friday night when the Aussies take on Pakistan in their next World Cup clash.

Let's get some sleep!

Australia vs Sri Lanka RESULTS | Zampa bowling through back spasms
Damien McCartney
Share post

Adam Zampa has revealed he took his four wickets against Sri Lanka while battling back spasms.

Zampa said was feeling "not great" against Sri Lanka, but rallied to become just the third Australian spinner to take four wickets in a World Cup clash, following Shane Warne (four times) and Brad Hogg (twice).

The performance earned him player of the match honours.

Zampa said a niggling back injury prevented him from bowling at his best in the opening two clashes against India and South Africa, and he was still far from his best against Sri Lanka.

Despite claiming the best figures, Zampa bowled only eight overs and was replaced late in the innings by Glenn Maxwell.

During a stoppage late in the Sri Lankan innings, cameras found him standing on the sideline getting treatment with some kind of belt, believed to be an electrical pulse machine or similar.

"I've been sporting a bit of a back spasm for the last couple of days," Zampa said after the match.

"So yeah, tried to get through this one … I feel like I've felt better, I've bowled better, but sometimes you have those days.

"I felt like particularly in the last game I could have bowled a little bit better. My role is to take wickets, and I haven't quite been doing that to make it easier for the death (bowlers). 

"I feel like I'm a good critic of myself and I feel like I can be doing better, but nice to be on the better end of the result tonight."

Zampa said the call to take him off for Maxwell was made by Pat Cummins, but suggested he might have made it for him anyway.

"He said we're gonna chuck the offspinner on against the lefties, so chance of the 5-fa gone, (but) I don't reckon I would have bowled after anyway – my back was pretty sore."

Australia vs Sri Lanka LIVE | Inglis falls
Damien McCartney
Share post

That was a bit of a rush of blood from Josh Inglis - he's holed out to point for 58.

It looked like it might've been a bit of a slower ball, but Inglis wasn't in position to play the shot and the ball balooned to point where Theekshanan did his absolute best to drop a sitter.

But he's done his job well, and surely Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis now will guide the Aussies home.

Well, Stoinis has spanked his first ball for four, and they need just 14 off 100 balls now.

Australia vs Sri Lanka LIVE | Glenn Maxwell wants to end it
Damien McCartney
Share post

Glenn Maxwell is clearly looking to end this match as quickly as he can.

Batting at six, he gave himself a couple of sighters and then went on the tonk - he's now 28 off just 14 balls and spanked Theekshana and Madushanka in their last two overs.

It's been a spectacular display of batting, and he's got the equation down to just 21 off 108 balls.

But that's drinks, so we'll have to wait a little longer.

Australia vs Sri Lanka LIVE | Labuschagne falls
Damien McCartney
Share post

That was ... not good from Marnus Labuschagne, and again it's Madushanka doing the damage.

Labuschagne gets a short ball, and he was in no position to pull it, but he tried anyway and holed out to the ring fielder at mid-wicket.

But it was some more solid time in the middle for one of the leading Aussie batters who's probably been a little out of touch of late.

Josh Inglis will be hoping he can stay at the crease and see this chase home.

Australia vs Sri Lanka LIVE | 50 for Inglis
Damien McCartney
Share post

Josh Inglis has brought up his first World Cup 50 in perfect style, with a beautiful straight drive down the ground for four.

He and Labuschagne have been chanceless in this partnership, which is now the biggest for the Australians in this tournament.

They need 53 from 22 overs.

Australia vs Sri Lanka LIVE | Steadying again
Damien McCartney
Share post

Marnus Labuschagne and Josh Inglis have steadied the ship again for Australia.

They've got required down below 60.

There have been few chances, and they're both batting sensationally.

"Australia are in complete control here," Ian Smith said in commentary.

Australia vs Sri Lanka LIVE | Marsh out!
Damien McCartney
Share post

At the risk of stating the obvious, a wicket was exactly what the Aussies didn't need there.

Marsh and Labuschagne had put on 57 for the third wicket, but that's just been broken by a disastrous run out that's put Marsh in the sheds for a run-a-ball 52.

Marsh guided one down towards third man, and was a little sloppy running the second. What wasn't sloppy was the throw in, which left Marsh stranded by well over a metre.

"That was a coach-killer," Steve O'Keefe said on Nine's coverage.

Mitch Marsh was run out just after making fifty against Sri Lanka. Nine

Mitch Marsh and Marnus Labuschagne have settled the Aussie innings.

Marsh is close to notching up another half-century, and Labuschagne has played a perfect support role so far.

They're doing exactly what they need to do.
