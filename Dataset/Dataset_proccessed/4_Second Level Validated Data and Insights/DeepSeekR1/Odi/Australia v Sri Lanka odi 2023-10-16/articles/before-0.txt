ICC Cricket World Cup 2023: Australia Vs Netherlands Warm-up Match

Australia's Indian sojourn hasn't started on a good note. The Pat Cummins-led side lost to hosts India in their opening game at Chepauk in Chennai by six wickets. Despite languishing at 2/3, India managed to pull themselves clear and give Australia another drubbing on home soil. The Aussies then faced another tough opposition in South Africa and despite winning the toss, the men from Down Under were bundled out for 177 as they lost back-to-back World Cup games for the first time since the 1992 edition. On Monday (October 16, 2023), the five-time champions face Sri Lanka at Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow. (Match Blog | Scorecard | Full Coverage) 

Sri Lanka have also endured a poor start to their 2023 ODI Cricket World Cup campaign. They were thumped by the Proteas in Delhi. Despite Kusal Mendis providing some fireworks, the Islanders still came up short by 102 runs. Dasun Shanaka's side then faced Pakistan in Hyderabad. Once again, despite a good batting performance, they ended up losing the game as Pakistan chased down a World Cup record target.

Australia's Travis Head has returned to nets having recovered from a fracture on his left hand, and the middle-order batter is expected to travel to India on Thursday to join his country's World Cup squad. He could feature against the Netherlands on October 25 in Delhi, provided he passes the fitness test. For Sri Lanka, their regular skipper Dasun Shanaka has been ruled out of the tournament due to a thigh injury. The all-rounder has been replaced by Chamika Karunaratne. Vice-captain Kusal Mendis will lead the side in Shanaka's absence.

Let's take a look at three vital contests that could decide which way the match goes:

David Warner Vs Dunith Wellalage
David Warner has had a below-par start to what could be his final ODI World Cup appearance. Scores of 41 and 13 for the southpaw has added to the Aussies' problems up the order. With form not on his side, Warner will look to start afresh against Sri Lanka. However, waiting in his wake would be Dunith Wellalage, who knows a thing or two about spinning the ball. The left-arm spinner could get some assistance from the Ekana pitch and his battle with the Aussie veteran would be one to watch out for.

Adam Zampa Vs Kusal Mendis
Another Aussie star who hasn't hit the ground running in this edition is Adam Zampa. The spinner has leaked runs in his two games with no wickets to his name. However, it is too early to write off Zampa and the spinner knows, that one good spell could reignite his and his side's ambitions in this World Cup. Zampa, however, could face the wrath of an in-form Kusal Mendis, who has struck one fifty and one century in his two games. Mendis will look to continue his ominous form in the World Cup. The wicketkeeper-batter will also lead out the troops in place of Dasun Shanaka, who has returned home due to a thigh injury.

Mitchell Starc Vs Sadeera Samarawickrama
Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc might have recorded the feat of being the quickest to achieve 50 wickets in World Cup history, but it will mean for nothing if his side don't go on to lift their sixth title. Starc has not yet provided the fireworks in this World Cup but against an injury-hit Sri Lanka, anything can happen. The 1996 champions do know how to come back in the face of adversity. Sadeera Samarawickrama scored a well-made 108 against Pakistan and thus, his battle with Starc makes it even more interesting.
