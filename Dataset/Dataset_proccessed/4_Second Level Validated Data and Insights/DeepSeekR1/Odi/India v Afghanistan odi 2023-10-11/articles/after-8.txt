One over. South Africa 4-0

Swing first ball for the left-arm quick Starc.

Defended on the front foot by the left-handed de Kock.

An open face brings a single second ball.

Bavuma leaves a wide swinging first ball, the clips a single off the pads next up.

On repeat with the singles for the last two balls of the over.

From Delhi to Lucknow

That wraps up our live blog of a record-breaking match in Delhi.

We’re back tomorrow with South Africa against Australia in Lucknow.

The Proteas thumped records themselves in the opening game, while the Aussies were humbled by India.

It’s a huge match for both.

Hope that you can join us.

But from Patrick Keddie and myself, Kevin Hand, it’s goodbye for now.

England await Afghanistan

For Afghanistan, the onslaught continues as they face defending champions England next.

They have a day longer than India to recover ahead of the game on Sunday in New Delhi.

England are fresh from their first win: a 137-run victory in Dharamsala on Tuesday against Bangladesh – the side that trounced Afghanistan in their opening match.

India ‘mustn’t worry about external factors’ ahead of Pakistan showdown

The biggest game in world cricket awaits in the next match for India as they face Pakistan in Amhedabad, India on Saturday.

Speaking again to the post-match stadium presentation, Rohit Sharma says his side mustn’t get carried away with the occasion when they face their near neighbours.

“It’s quite crucial that we don’t worry too much about external factors.

“We need to come and show up on the ground really well. That will be critical for us going forward.

“Every game we are going to treat it like that. We want to focus on what we need to do on that particular day, what is the pitch like, what sort of combinations we need to play.

“What happens outside is not in our control and we won’t be bothered by that. It’s about focus on what we can control as players.”

Afghanistan captain rues ‘back-to-back’ wickets

Hashmatullah Shahidi says there are no regrets about batting first despite falling a long way short of a competitive score.

“We had a target above 300 in mind in these conditions,” he said.

“We had in mind that India’s batting line up is strong. Unfortunately, back-to-back wickets cost us.

“Our thinking was the surface was good and we wanted to socre more runs and to put more pressure on the opposition.

“After losing three wickets, I was talking to Azmatullah and telling him: ‘Don’t worry about dot balls – we will do it after.’

“We had to build a partnership in that moment.

“We have seven more games and we will try to learn from our mistakes.”

Player of the Match – Rohit Sharma

The Indian captain is the only choice after that record-breaking innings.

Rohit, however, didn’t want to be drawn on the records that fell in his incredible knock: “I don’t want to think about that stuff too much.

“I know it’s a long way to go ahead and I don’t want to lose my focus.

“When you get days like this you have to make it count and make it big.

“It was a good pitch to bat on and I was backing myself to play my natural game. Once you got your eye in, you know the pitch will get easier and easier to bat on.

“Some of it is premeditated because you can’t just keep going and playing those shots. I let my instincts take over as well and playing at the top of the order I know it is my job to get the side off to a good start in the chase.

“I want to back myself to keep doing that and putting the pressure on the opposition.”

Afghanistan in awe – and so are we all

That was brutal with the bat from India.

Records tumbled for Rohit Sharma.

He reaches a seventh World Cup century in 19 innings to surpass Sachin Tendulkar, whose six tons were registerd in 44 innings.

Kapil Dev scored India’s previous fastest World Cup century, from 72 balls, in 1983 against Zimbabwe.

Rohit broke the record by nine deliveries.

Kishan deserved a 50 for his part in the opening stand of 156.

Then Kohli canters to a 50 in front of his home crowd. That innings had it all for India.

After Kohli and KL Rahul put on a masterclass to recover their match against Australia, this one was a brutal destruction from the word go.

Fifty for Kohli and an eight wicket win for India!

Delhi’s darling delivers.

Kohli drives sweetly for four wide of mid-off to start the over then takes a single.

The milestone comes up with a pull for two to move to 51* from 55 balls.

Completely unperturbed today.

The crowd love it.

He chips the final ball of Azmatullah’s over for four over mid-on – and the crowd go wild.

Their hero takes centre stage to win the match only a couple of balls after raising his bat.

34 overs. India 261-2

Shreyas Iyer needs to leave some runs for Virat Kohli here.

The Delhi crowd will want to see their hero hit 50 given that it’s so close.

Iyer smears a pull shot for four towards the end of Fazalhaq Farooqi’s over.

Just 12 to win. Kohli has a strike, though.
