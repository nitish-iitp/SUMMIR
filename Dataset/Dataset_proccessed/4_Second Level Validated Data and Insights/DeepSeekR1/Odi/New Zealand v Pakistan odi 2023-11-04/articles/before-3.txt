On Tuesday, they played Bangladesh at Eden Gardens in a must-win match. After Bangladesh chose to bat first, the Pakistan pacers put on a show to bowl them out for just 204 in 45.1 overs. They chased down the target in 32.3 overs, thanks in large part to a 128-run opening stand between Abdullah Shafique and Fakhar Zaman.

Their next opponents, New Zealand, currently sit in third place in the table, but have lost two consecutive matches, to India and Australia. The Kiwis play South Africa on Wednesday, before the Pakistan game.

Here's all the match details for this Cricket World Cup 2023 clash, including TV information around the world, start time, betting odds and historical meetings in ODIs between the two nations.

Pakistan vs New Zealand predictions, latest betting odds

Pakistan put up an excellent fight against South Africa, and put together a superb performance against Bangladesh to just about keep their top four hopes alive. While New Zealand have been one of the form teams so far, they've lost two successive matches, which could even be three by the time they take on Pakistan.

The Kiwis will still start the game as firm favourites, but recent form could play a role in making this a tighter contest than the World Cup table suggests.
