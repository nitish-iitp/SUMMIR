Trent Boult found form with 3 wickets for New Zealand in Bengaluru

Maheesh Theekshana might not have the strike bowler that Sri Lanka might have hoped him to be at the World Cup but the spinner has chipped in with crucial contributions with the bat in the tournament. Theekshana hit 39 not out in a rearguard effort to help Sri Lanka post a respectable total in their final league game of the World Cup against New Zealand at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday, November 9.

World Cup 2023 Full Coverage

During the course of the innings, Maheesh Theekshana set a new World Cup record by facing 91 balls, the most by a No. 9 batter in the history of the tournament. He broke Andy Bichel's record from the 2003 World Cup.

MOST BALLS FACED BY NO. 9 IN WORLD CUPS

Maheesh Theekshana - 38 not out off 91 balls vs New Zealand in 2023
Andy Bichel - 64 off 83 vs New Zealand in 2003
Imran Khan - 21 not out vs 82 vs England in 1979

Despite a 28-ball 51 from opener Kusal Perera, Sri Lanka crumbled as they lost 5 wickets in the first powerplay. Trent Boult picked up 3 wickets with the new ball, finding some form while Lockie Ferguson, Mitchell Santner and Rachin Ravindra picked up 2 wickets each.

Sri Lanka slipped to 70 for 5 and then to128 for 9 before Theekshana and Madushanka added 43 runs for the 10th wicket.

Theekshana's 91 is also the second most number of balls faced by a No. 9 batter in ODI cricket. Jay Prakash Yadav holds the record after having faced 92 balls in an ODI against New Zealand in 2005. The Sri Lanka tail-ender hit 3 boundaries during his knock as he flaunted his improved batting skills at the death.

Despite Theekshana's effort, Sri Lanka were not able to last the full quota of 50 overs in what has been a disappointing World Cup campaign for the former champions, who are in danger of missing out on Champions Trophy 2025.
