Pitch Report:

The R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo has produced spin-friendly tracks where batters tend to struggle. The average score of the venue is 256 in ODIs. The batters have found it difficult to score runs due to the tracks’ slow nature. Whereas the bowlers, especially the spinners, have managed to use the surface to find some grip and turn to contain runs and take wickets.

Team Analysis:

India

India will be the favourites to win the series with a stacked lineup full of world-beaters. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli return to action for the first time after their T20I retirements and will be the key of the batting lineup against a tricky Lankan bowling attack. On the bowling front, Mohammed Siraj and Kuldeep Yadav will be the most important bowlers while others like Arshdeep Singh and Axar will look to establish themselves in the 50-over format.

India Squad:

Rohit Sharma (C), Ꮪhubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd. Siraj, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Riyan Parag, Axar Patel, Khaleel Ahmed, Harshit Rana.

Sri Lanka 

Sri Lanka will look for massive improvements after a disappointing performance in the T20I series. Playing in their preferred ODIs, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama and Charith Asalanka will look to end the side batting woes evident in the T20Is. Talking about the Lankan bowling, Maheesh Theekshana and Matheesha Pathirana will be crucial while Dunith Wellalage and Asitha Fernando will look to support their strike bowlers.

Sri Lanka squad:

Charith Asalanka (C), Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Kamindu Mendis, Janith Liyanage, Nishan Madushka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dunith Wellalage, Chamika Karunaratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Akila Dananjaya, Dilshan Madushanka, Matheesha Pathirana, Asitha Fernando.

Match Prediction:




Conclusion:

India has a better chance to win this fixture and defeat Sri Lanka to lift the kick of the ODI series with a win.
