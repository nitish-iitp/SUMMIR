Paul Stirling recorded his highest score of the season in Abu Dhabi last night as Ireland turned the tables on South Africa to claim the dead rubber of their one-day international series by 69 runs.

After winning the all-important toss, Stirling led the way with 88 from 92 balls, and was well supported by Andy Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker as the Boys in Green posted a testing 284-9.

South Africa’s top order struggled as the new ball again zipped around under the lights, and were quickly 10-3 and effectively beaten, despite a fighting 91 from Jason Smith.

Mark Adair took two wickets in a probing opening spell, Craig Young and Graham Hume claimed three each and spinner Matthew Humphreys’ frugal seven overs brought him 1-16 as the Proteas were dismissed for 215.

After Friday’s second thumping defeat, the question was asked: Would it have made a difference if Ireland had batted first? The answer provided yesterday was an emphatic ‘Yes’.

It’s hard to over state just how lop-sided this series was, with the result in all three games effectively decided by the toss. In the searing heat of the afternoon, Stirling and Balbirnie were largely untroubled adding 101 for the first wicket, the skipper striking three sixes – the last a gorgeous punch over mid-off.

When Balbirnie was caught in the deep for 45, including four fours and a six over long leg, Campher maintained the momentum with a lively 34 from 36.

Stirling, who scored his first half-century of the year in last week’s T20 win, missed out on a century when he was again bowled through the gate but there was more good news for Ireland as Tector stroked his way back into form with a commanding 60.

Ireland are likely to play another ‘home series’ in Abu Dhabi for commercial reasons but hopefully in the more temperate winter that would ensure fairer conditions for the side bowling first and batting second.
