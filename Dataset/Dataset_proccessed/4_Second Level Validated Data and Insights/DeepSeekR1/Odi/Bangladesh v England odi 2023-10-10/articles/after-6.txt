LIVE Eng vs Ban Score Updates:England revived their 50-overs World Cup title defence as Dawid Malan smashed a career-best 140 and Reece Topley wreaked havoc with the ball in a 137-run hammering of Bangladesh 
LIVE Eng vs Ban Score Updates: England's Reece Topley gestures during the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between England and Bangladesh at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala. (AFP)

LIVE Eng vs Ban Score Updates:  DBangladesh shot out of the blocks, with Liton Das hitting three consecutive fours off the first over bowled by Chris Woakes.

But they were quickly reduced to 14-2, with Tanzid Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto unable to cope with the pace and movement of the towering Topley, who replaced Moeen Ali in the side.

That became 26-3 when captain Shakib Al Hasan was bowled by the paceman and the expensive Woakes then got in on the act, enticing an edge from Mehidy Hasan Miraz, with England captain Jos Buttler taking the catch behind the stumps.

Despite the carnage, Liton looked untroubled at the other end, reaching his fifty off 38 balls as Bangladesh tried to rebuild.

Highlights so far: 

1) Bangladesh won the toss and asked England to bat first. England made one change in their lineup with Reece Topley replacing Moeen Ali.

2) English openers delivered an over 100 run partnership before Bairstow was eventually dismissed by Shakib al Hasan on a score of 52.

3) After the wicket of Bairstow, Root and Malan stitched together another partnership and firmly placed England in the dominant position in the game. 

4) Unable to capitalize on the explosive start, England were restricted to a total of 364 runs. The Bangladesh Tigers bowled and fielded exceptionally well in the last 10 overs, conceding just 66 runs while taking 6 wickets.
