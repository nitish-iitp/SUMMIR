Pakistan have the pace and the exponents of reverse swing so England will look at that game against them and be very worried. I am not sure England have bowlers with those capabilities. They will be looking at that fixture now, especially if that Champions Trophy place is on the line, and it will concern them. Pakistan have stumbled upon a side with balance and it's a shame they didn't find it earlier in the tournament. They cover many bases.

'We need to give the fans something...'

Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan: "We did not get enough runs. I thought the wicket was really good. We lost early wickets again and from there on there were some partnership but not big partnerships where we could go hard in the last 10 overs. It was disappointing with the bat but we should have bowled better. Credit goes to Pakistan with the way they bowled and batted in the first 10 overs.

"Should I bat at number three? We should think about that. At this moment we are not getting runs from the top four batters. I was batting at top four and didn't score runs so my confidence was low too. Luckily I got some runs and I am feeling better so we can talk about it. Changing too many things at this moment makes it difficult but we have to do something. It's not working but we have to keep moving forward and think of something which might work.

"At this moment we have to perform together in all three departments. It's not any individual that can win us games. We need collective performances. Two more matches hopefully we can bounce back. The fans supported us and are behind us whether we are doing well or not. We have to give something back to them so they can smile."

If Pakistan are able to claw their way back into this tournament then Babar Azam will be a key player with the bat. He's maybe got some confusion in his game, but he is the number one ranked ODI batter in the world. It's up for debate whether he needs to up the ante. With his captaincy it is all about seizing the moment in the field.

I think Pakistan gave a better account of themselves. They ran South Africa close the other day and that gave them some belief. Right from the start Shaheen Afridi bowled nicely and got the ball talking. That calmed everyone's nerves in terms of getting themselves into the game. They have boosted their net run-rate with the manner in which they chased the total down. A very professional performance.

Here is the winning moment for Pakistan. A rather low-key end after an innings full of brilliant hitting, especially from Fahkar Zaman.

Pakistan captain Babar Azam: "I congratulate the boys for the way they played in all three departments.

"We know when Fahkar plays the way he can for 20-30 overs it is a different ball game. So we let him play his natural game and it is good to see."

Still believe they can finish in the top four: "Yes. We are trying to win our next two matches and let's see where we stand. We will take a lot of confidence into those matches."

On the performance of his bowlers: "We started well. Shaheen took early wickets. The built a partnership between 15-20 overs but we brought back our main bowlers and took wickets.

"The main thing is we stuck to our length in the middle overs and we took wickets."

I was hoping this result would help lift England off the bottom of the table, but apparently not! Bangladesh are still above them.

I think Babar Azam's captaincy was one of the bright things from today. He was a bit more aggressive with field placings and changing of bowling. He is sometimes accustomed to letting it drift along but it was a bit more assured performance today. It was the little things he was a bit more on the front foot. His batting was a little bit confused, though. He wanted to bat through for 40 off 80 balls but with the run-rate he knew there had to show more intent.

Pakistan had more impetus at the top of the order with Fahkar Zaman. As a bowler you are on the back foot against someone like that. Any fears that this wicket was a dodgy wicket and Bangladesh could put Pakistan under pressure were also allayed by the way he played.

Player of the match Fahkar Zaman, who hit 81 from 74 balls: "After the Asia Cup I practiced a lot of things and thankfully I was feeling very good in the camp and was looking forward to scoring runs for my team. But this is cricket. Today I got a chance and thankfully it paid off.

"It doesn't matter how the wicket will play I know I can hit sixes. My role in the team is to make it easy for my partner so I was just looking to see off the first four overs."

Was net run-rate a factor: "Yes. It was in our mind and after reaching 100 runs we wanted to finish the game before 30 overs."

On what this could do for his career: "After too many failures I was looking to score the first 30 runs and go from there. So I am really happy and hopefully I will make it big in the next game."

There was less expectation on Bangladesh coming into this tournament but given the conditions you might have thought they would have given a good account of themselves. With their selections there seems to have been a lot of muddled thinking.

It has been efficient from Pakistan, without being absolutely ruthless. It was a very comfortable win and after four defeats at least it is a win.

There it is.

Muhammad Rizwan nudges the ball into the off side and scampers through for the single that wraps up a dominant seven-wicket victory for Pakistan.

Their run of four straight defeats is over and their hopes of a semi-final place are still alive - just.

Bangladesh, who have endured a miserable tournament, become the first team to be officially eliminated.

Thanks, Timothy. Every day is indeed a school day

Not sure my stint is going to last that long.

Muhammad Rizwan looks keen to finish this off quickly as he cuts Mehidy Hasan away for another four, he has raced to 23 from 17 balls.

A couple of singles edge Pakistan ever closer to victory, with just 14 more needed.
