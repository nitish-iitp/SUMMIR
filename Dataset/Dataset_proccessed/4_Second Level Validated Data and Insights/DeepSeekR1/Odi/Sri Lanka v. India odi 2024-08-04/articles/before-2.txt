Preview

In the second ODI of the three-match series, Sri Lanka will take on India at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The first ODI between these two teams ended in a tie after India were unable to get past the 230-run total set by Sri Lanka. With that, the series is well and truly alive for either India or Sri Lanka to win, if they emerge victorious in the next two ODIs.

Pitch Report

The pitch at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo wasn’t easy for the batter to get set, especially with the early swing and seam movement for the fast bowlers, followed by the turn for the spinners. With that, the average first-innings score of 225 in ODI cricket at this venue could prove to be tough for either Sri Lanka or India to chase down in the second match of the series.

Team Analysis

Sri Lanka

Pathum Nissanka and Dunith Wellalage scored fifties for Sri Lanka in the first ODI of the series, in two different phases of the innings, to help them post a competitive total of 230 runs on the board. On the bowling side of things, the spin attack of Sri Lanka was quite exceptional in restricting India to a tie after Wanindu Hasaranga and captain Charith Asalanka picked up three wickets each, while Dunith Wellalage took two wickets as well.

India

In pursuit of a par total of 230 runs in the first ODI, the Indian captain, Rohit Sharma, scored a quick-fire fifty to put the team ahead of the run rate, but the rest of the batters weren’t at their best, leading to a tie. The bowling department for India was quite impressive with their performance in the first ODI, with the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav picking up key Sri Lankan wickets.

Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd. Siraj, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Riyan Parag, Axar Patel, Khaleel Ahmed, Harshit Rana

Match Prediction




Conclusion

Although Sri Lanka were able to tie the first ODI against India, the visitors have enough quality and experience at their disposal to get the better of them in the next two matches of the series.
