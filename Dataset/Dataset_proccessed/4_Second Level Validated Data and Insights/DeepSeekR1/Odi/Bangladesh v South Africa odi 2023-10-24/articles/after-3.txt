South Africa defeated Bangladesh by 149 runs in the ICC World Cup 2023 group stage match at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium to leave the Tigers facing an early exit from the tournament after their latest loss. Bangladesh fell to their fourth straight loss so far on Tuesday, having previously suffered defeats at the hands of England, New Zealand and India.

After posting their 3rd 350-plus total in the ongoing World Cup 2023, South African bowlers rallied to bowl out Bangladesh for a meager 145 in only 32 overs. With this record win over the Asian team, the Proteas leapfrogged New Zealand to jump to the second spot behind India in the World Cup 2023 points table.

World Cup 2023, SA vs BAN: Highlights

MAHMUDULLAH's 111 REDUCES DEFEAT MARGIN

Bangladesh suffered their third-largest defeat in World Cup history, largely due to their fragile batting performance. They started cautiously but soon faced a series of setbacks. Marco Jansen took two crucial wickets in the seventh over, dismissing Tanzid Hasan (12) and Najmul Hossain Shanto (0) caught behind, while Lizaad Williams removed Shakib Al Hasan (1) in the next over.

Kagiso Rabada trapped Litton Das (12) leg-before, and Gerald Coetzee (3/62) removed Mushfiqur Rahim (8). Mehidy Hasan Miraz (11) was sent in at No. 7, part of Bangladesh's ever-changing batting order, and was eventually dismissed by Keshav Maharaj (1/32).

Despite the dire situation, Mahmudullah played a remarkable innings, scoring a century and forming crucial partnerships to reduce the margin of defeat. He added 41 runs for the seventh wicket with Nasum Ahmed (19), 37 runs for the eighth wicket with Hasan Mahmud (15), and 68 runs for the ninth wicket with Mustafzur Rahman (11), displaying resilience and determination to keep South Africa on the field as long as possible.

DE KOCK POWERS SOUTH AFRICA TO 382

Earlier, Quinton de Kock's record knock of 174 and Heinrich Klaasen's explosive 90 off just 49 balls highlighted South Africa's formidable batting strength as the Proteas posted a mammoth total of 382 for 5 in the group stage match. De Kock smashed 15 boundaries, including 15 fours and seven sixes, notching up his third century in five innings. His 140-ball innings featured a remarkable late surge, securing him the ninth-highest individual score in World Cup history.

Klaasen, coming off a stunning century against England, returned to form after a two-day break. He blazed his way to 90 runs, hitting eight massive sixes and two fours in quick succession. In his 150th One Day International (ODI), de Kock dominated the Bangladeshi bowlers in challenging hot and humid conditions, nearly batting until the end. While he fell short of a double century, he exhibited remarkable hand speed and agile footwork after a somewhat slow start, unleashing a series of breathtaking shots across the field.

De Kock surpassed India's Virat Kohli for the most runs and also surpassed Australia's David Warner (163) for the highest individual score in this World Cup. And, as has happened a few times recently, South Africa exploded in the final 10 overs to score another 144 runs, led by David Miller's unbeaten 15-ball 34. Markram batted fluently for his 67-ball 60, moving his hands deftly to score seven boundaries, but an inside-out lofted drive found Das at long-on off Shakib in the 31st over, with the Proteas' third wicket stand scoring 131 runs. The fourth-wicket stand was even bigger and better, with de Kock and Klaasen scoring 142 runs off just 87 balls.
