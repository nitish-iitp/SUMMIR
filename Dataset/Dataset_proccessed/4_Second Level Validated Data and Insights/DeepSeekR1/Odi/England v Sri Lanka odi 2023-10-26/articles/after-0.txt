Matthew Mott, England’s Australian coach, finds himself losing to an English coach for the second time in this tournament. First it was Jonathan Trott with Afghanistan, now it’s Chris Silverwood with Sri Lanka. Mott, to his credit, comes out and faces the cameras. “We’ve unfortunately saved our worst form for this World Cup,” he says. “Everyone feels like they’ve let a lot of people down.”

Asked if England have more than a mathematical chance, he demurs. “Realistically, we’re in a bit of trouble.”

He can say that again. But then he has won a World Cup with England – the T20 one, this time last year in Australia. He, like most of the players, has plenty of credit in the bank.

That’s it from us on a chastening day for England. Thanks very much for your company, correspondence and gallows humour. The last word goes to Simon McMahon. “And maybe the most depressing thing about it all,” he reckons, “is that it was the fairest of margins.”

The player of the match is Lahiru Kumara, who took three for 35 and removed Jos Buttler, Liam Livingstone and Ben Stokes. It could equally well have been Angelo Mathews, who roared back from the wilderness to take two wickets and a run-out, or either of the two batters who cruised to victory – Pathum Nissanka and Sadeera Samarawickrama.

So Sri Lanka had four superstars as well as a strong team effort that manifested itself in fine fielding. England had only David Willey playing well, and he’s the one player in their squad who hasn’t just been given a central contract.

Ben Stokes did his best, hanging in there against the odds, and Chris Woakes and Mark Wood showed signs of finding their rhythm. But these are straws to be clutched at. England have been awful. And they’ve lurched from one policy (lots of bits and pieces) to another (specialists) and back.

They’re not out of the World Cup yet, strangely. But they surely soon will be as their next game is against India, who have been remorselessly efficient.

“It’s incredibly tough,” says Jos Buttler. “Incredibly disappointing tournament. Not just short of our best but a very long way. As captain, you feel that a lot – disappointed for myself and all the boys that we’ve not shown a good account of ourselves…” He manages a wry smile. “Can’t fault the guys’ efforts. It' starts at the front and I’ve been a long way short of my best. ”

Sri Lanka go up to fifth in the table, ahead of Pakistan. Both those sides have four points from five games, as do Afghanistan. England have two points from five – won one, lost four – and they are ninth. Their net run rate is awful too (-1.63), but luckily for them the Netherlands’ is even worse (-1.90). So Glenn Maxwell’s big hitting has at least kept England off rock bottom.

Sri Lanka win by eight wickets with almost half their overs to spare – 24.2 overs. This has been the shortest match in the 2023 World Cup. And the lowest ebb for England, who were widely expected to win.

SRI LANKA WIN BY A STREET AND ENGLAND'S MISERY DEEPENS

25.4 overs: Sri Lanka 160-2 (Nissanka 77, Samarawickrama 65) A six from Nissanka, and England are put out of their misery – or rather, pitched into another level of it. They’ve been utterly outplayed.

24th over: Sri Lanka 146-2 (Nissanka 66, Samarawickrama 63) It’s party time now. Samarawickrama goes inside-out to loft Moeen for four, then reverse-sweeps him for four more.

“Re when England were expected to be this bad (drinks break),” says Smylers, “the 11-year-old recently read Young Wisden, published in 2007, in which England are described as ‘Good at: seam bowling, especially at home; being given newspaper columns’ and ‘Not so good at: one-day cricket’. That all sounds pretty accurate again — maybe you should consider a reprint?” Ha. “or anybody desperate, I see the original is available on Amazon for a mere £105.” Blimey.

Fifty to Samarawickrama!

23rd over: Sri Lanka 135-2 (Nissanka 64, Samarawickrama 54) Buttler goes back to seam, in the form of Woakes. Samarawickrama takes a single to reach a fine, attacking fifty off 44 balls with four fours and a six. He celebrates by flipping a full toss for another four. SL need 22: it’s all over bar the handshaking.

Hundred partnership!

21st over: Sri Lanka 124-2 (Nissanka 62, Samarawickrama 45) Nissanka, facing Livingstone, hits an inside-out drive for four to bring up the hundred partnership, 101 off 94 balls. He and Samarawickrama have been far too good.

“You ask if any of us remember when England were this bad,” says Sarah Skelding. “The answer is yes, but please don’t ask for details. It’s still too soon and too fresh even 30 years on.” Ha… 30 years, eh – sounds as if you’re thinking of the Ashes series that did for Graham Gooch’s captaincy.

20th over: Sri Lanka 118-2 (Nissanka 57, Samarawickrama 44) Buttler gives Wood a breather and turns to Moeen Ali, so it’s spin at both ends – from two bowlers who were not wanted in the previous match. The batters do some milking. What would Eoin do? Bring back Willey, most likely.

19th over: Sri Lanka 113-2 (Nissanka 53, Samarawickrama 43) Livingstone continues with his leg-breaks and induces a false shot, but it just plops to the ground in the no-man’s-land beyond midwicket. Only three off the over, as if that matters: Sri Lanka need only 44 more.

Fifty to Nissanka!

18th over: Sri Lanka 110-2 (Nissanka 51, Samarawickrama 42) Nissanka, facing Wood, cuts for two and then eases into a lovely drive that brings up his 50 off 54 balls with six fours and a six. He’s been so good, unflappable and fluent.

Wood has been decidedly better today, which is a crumb of comfort for England as they head for a humbling at the hands of India on Sunday.

17th over: Sri Lanka 103-2 (Nissanka 44, Samarawickrama 42) Faced with those options I mentioned, Buttler picks Liam Livingstone with his liquorice all-sorts. His first ball sits up asking to be slapped away for four and Samarawickrama is happy to oblige. Sri Lanka need another 54.

15.09 CEST

16th over: Sri Lanka 95-2 (Nissanka 43, Samarawickrama 35) A rare bad ball from Wood today, a bouncer that just needs helping round the corner by Nissanka. The target shrivels to 62. Buttler has a rather skimpy set of options – bring Woakes back, try Moeen or Livingstone, bring Willey back … or persuade Stokes to take up bowling again.

“This seems so obvious as to be a mundane observation in the extreme, and yet: confidence and momentum are so important, aren’t they?” says Rob Knap. “This group of players has seemed to collectively maintain both for longer than normal, despite the occasional dips. It’s not unusual for such a successful sports team to suffer such a rapid turnaround in fortunes like this, as others have said today. I can understand motivation and intensity dropping as they realise what’s happening - see Adil’s run-out for an example of that. Willey seems to still have some of that intensity at least (perhaps contract-related?).

“I can only imagine they’re extremely aware of what’s happening, whatever they say publicly (God knows every club cricketer of a certain age understands what ‘losing it’ feels like, whether collectively or individually). It must be pretty depressing for them. I hope they get a sympathetic and appreciative send-off as a team, but I suspect that’s unlikely...”

Sri Lanka are past halfway!

15th over: Sri Lanka 87-2 (Nissanka 36, Samarawickrama 34) Buttler gives Rashid a leg slip, which should be a step forward – but Rashid takes three steps back, offering a drive-ball outside off (single), a nothing ball on the stumps (flicked for six), and long hop outside off (cut for two). That’s 12 off the over, and suddenly Sri Lanka are past halfway – 87 in the bag, just 70 needed. Apart from anything else, England’s net run rate is heading from bad to worse.

14th over: Sri Lanka 75-2 (Nissanka 34, Samarawickrama 24) Wood is bowling pretty well, but these two batters have got their eye in and he can only draw a half-false shot out of them. A magnificent bouncer brings a fence from Samarawickrama, who puts his hands on the line and gets a cut for his trouble. The fifty partnership comes up, off 48 balls, which is exactly the right way to approach a small run chase. Buttler belatedly brings in a slip. Let’s have a Test-match field!

13th over: Sri Lanka 72-2 (Nissanka 33, Samarawickrama 22) Samarawickrama, facing Rashid, tries a scoop and ends up getting it in the neck, but he seems to be OK. This is a better over from Rashid, just three from it. But England need eight wickets fast and he doesn’t look like getting more than one or two.

“Just recovering from two cataract operations,” says David Gaskell. “Is it my imagination or were England better when I couldn’t see them?”

12th over: Sri Lanka 69-2 (Nissanka 32, Samarawickrama 20) Willey takes a break (5-0-30-2) and Buttler plays the only card left in his hand of seamers: Mark Wood. He simply can’t afford to be in his expensive mode, and the heart sinks as his first ball is a long hop, slapped away over backward point by Samarawickrama. Wood recovers well, touching 151kph and beating the bat in the channel not once, not twice, but three times. Give him a slip! Or three!

11th over: Sri Lanka 64-2 (Nissanka 32, Samarawickrama 15) Rashid too starts well before giving Nissanka a juicy half-volley, despatched for four. One reason England are still firm favourites to lose this match is the outfield, which is like an ice rink.

10th over: Sri Lanka 56-2 (Nissanka 26, Samarawickrama 13) Willey gets a fifth over. “He’s fired up,” says Nasser, who knows a bit about that. Willey starts this over well, but then Samarawickrama flicks over his left shoulder and gets four for it as someone I can’t quite make out slides in and shovels the ball onto the Toblerone.

“I don’t think Max Williams should be too worried about the test team,” says Mark Beadle. “Ben [Duckett] and Zak [Crawley] will be in their prime and have England 150+ off 25 overs. Plus, there is actually some decent young players coming through and maybe even Jofra will be fit.” Are you, by any chance, an optimist?

9th over: Sri Lanka 51-2 (Nissanka 25, Samarawickrama 9) On a seaming pitch, England have picked one seamer fewer than in the last game, dropping Gus Atkinson (who might have been worth a place just for his batting). So Buttler brings on Adil Rashid before the end of the Powerplay. Nissanka cashes in with a straight six, the first one of the day not struck by David Willey.

26 Oct 2023
14.32 CEST

8th over: Sri Lanka 43-2 (Nissanka 18, Samarawickrama 8) Willey beats Samarawickrama with the ball that goes straight on across the right-hander. If England do somehow manage to get out of jail here, their 156 will be the second-lowest first-innings score by a winning team in a men’s World Cup. Full list here: it makes you wish that England were facing themselves.

“The timing of the central contracts was completely misguided,” says John Starbuck. “The best option would have been to wait until the end of this tournament and rewarded players appropriately. Don’t the ECB guys know anything?”

14.26 CEST

7th over: Sri Lanka 38-2 (Nissanka 16, Samarawickrama 6) Nissanka is close to being pinned in front by Woakes, but he fights back with a flashing blade – a whip to leg, which Dinesh Karthik thinks is premeditated, and then a cut with fast hands to take it past cover point. He has decided that attack is the best form of defence, and he’s surely right. This is a good contest, for now.

6th over: Sri Lanka 29-2 (Nissanka 7, Samarawickrama 6) Is Sadeera Samarawickrama bothered? He is not. He sees a full one first ball and creams it through the covers. But that was another vital incision from Willey, who has persuaded two good players to play bad shots. He has two for 20 off his three overs.

WICKET!! Mendis c Buttler b Willey 11 (Sri Lanka 23-2)

Willey’s done it again! Possibly a slower ball – Mendis aims a flick to leg which ends up as a steepling top edge, over the keeper’s shoulder. Buttler keeps calm, runs back and ends up holding a very good diving catch. Is this a glimmer of hope we see before us?

5th over: Sri Lanka 23-1 (Nissanka 7, K Mendis 11) Good again from Woakes, going for just two singles. His first three overs have gone for nine, a big improvement on the mayhem of his three earlier appearances. But England need wickets …

4th over: Sri Lanka 21-1 (Nissanka 6, K Mendis 10) Willey starts this over well, swinging the ball in, and Jos Buttler brings in a catcher at a sort of deep short leg. But then that lifter which nearly paid off in the first over goes awry and Mendis upper-cuts it for four.

Willey is clearly rated by Buttler – he’s been preferred today to Sam Curran. But in the break there was an interview with Rob Key, who said the point of this mass hand-out of central contracts was “to make sure we’ve got the best 29 cricketers in England”. What a slap in the face for Willey to find that he’s in the first XI (with a few injuries, as we know) and yet not in the boss’s top 29. What a way to dent a player’s morale in mid-tournament.

3rd over: Sri Lanka 15-1 (Nissanka 6, K Mendis 4) A good over from Woakes! Just two from it. Not that England can win this with thrift – nothing but ten wickets will do.

“This is it,” says Tom van der Gucht. “The moment England stand tall and are counted. The moment they bounce back and launch their attack on the World Cup. The moment they began to believe in themselves. When they lift the trophy in a few weeks, we’ll look back to this day and their unlikely victory as the point they Lit the blue touch paper and went off into the stratosphere.”

2nd over: Sri Lanka 13-1 (Nissanka 4, K Mendis 4) And the next ball is a missed chance! Kusal Mendis flashed at a lifter and Joe Root, at slip, just couldn’t get his hands up fast enough. A great first over from Willey, who has been treated abysmally this week by the England management. They handed out central contracts to 29 players, including every single member of this World Cup squad – except Willey. If he was a Yorkie of an earlier generation, he would have flown home in disgust. As it is, he hit the only six of England’s innings, didn’t get out, and now has a wicket and a near-miss. Give that man a pay rise!

Stokes and Willey were England’s best batters, not that that is saying much, and now they combine to get an early scalp. Perera, looking to turn Willey to the on side, pops a leading edge towards mid-off, and Stokes, for all his ailments, manages to run in and take the catch.

1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Nissanka 4, K Perera 0) Woakes’s opening over is at least not a disaster. The wheels threaten to stay off when he tries to bring his second ball back into the right-handed Nissanka and just succeeds in dishing up a fat legside wide. The next one is straighter but too full, and Pathum Nissanka on-drives it for a handsome four. But Woakes recovers well with some line’n’length.

Nissanka has been in form, which is more than you can say for any of the Englishmen selected for this match. Harry Brook was badly missed.

Here’s a thoughtful take., sent to Rob before he handed over. “Like you,” Max Williams writes, “I find it tough to muster much ‘send ‘em to the stocks!’ righteous indignation. A tournament like this was probably inevitable: great teams tend to flame out. Leaving aside the England Test burnouts of 2007 and 2013-14, consider France and Spain exiting the group stages of the 2002 and 2014 World Cups – both sides were World and European champions at the time. It’s hard enough to engineer a perfect exit from individual sports, let alone get a collective of greats to bow out on top. You always think you have one more in you.

”A similar fate almost certainly awaits the current England Test team – indeed never has a side been more obviously destined to implode spectacularly when their time comes. I’m now extremely worried for the 2025-26 Ashes tour, when most of the team will be deep into their 30s. The Bonfire of Bazball will be quite something.” It will! When we all stay up for the first session at the Gabba, England could be all out by lunch.

“I was trying to work out the most inept defence of a World Cup apart from this one,” says Rob Durbim. “Racked my brain very hard, but I think it’s got to be Australia in the 1992 version. They didn’t get out of the pool and managed all that at home as well...”

Yes that was a shocker because going the tournament they were effectively both England (holders) and India (hosts and huge favourites) ahead of this year’s World Cup. Sri Lanka in 1999 was also very poor, though it was overshadowed by England’s Hitchcockian fiasco.

England raced to 45 for none, though even then they were lucky because Jonny Bairstow should have been out to the first ball of the match. And then it happened.

I still don’t know what ‘it’ was, so let’s deal in numbers: England lost 10 wickets for 111 in 26.5 overs. Ben Stokes top-scored with a defiant, scruffy 43. While he was at the crease there was a soupçon of hope, but it never felt like something brilliant might happen.

England’s demise was shocking, though I’m not sure it was surprising. It fits the profile of their tournament - a great team who, in good faith, took on one job too many.

The two run-outs in particular were a window into England’s soul, and also their collective noggin. Let’s not be too harsh or whiny; this is part of a bigger story. A thoroughly life-afirming story.

32nd over: England 156-9 (Willey 14, Wood 5) Mark Wood doesn’t deserve this. He picks up where he left off against South Africa, blazing Kumara coldly over backward point for four.

Willey, who also doesn’t deserve this, slaps four more over extra cover. If England can get to 220… No.

“Too many people are ready to criticise The Hundred, a fantastic and fun sprint competition that has energised a younger fanbase who find the dull and plodding nature of Test cricket too slow and the time needed to dedicate to a 50 over game too long,” writes Oliver.

“If the point is that this group of cricketers hasn’t played enough 50-over cricket heading into a World Cup, the responsibility falls only at the feet of the ECB for not organising enough ODI before the World Cup. Looking to apportion blame anywhere other than that masks the root of the issue.”

I’d argue it’s more complicated than that. The ODI schedule was compromised because of franchise cricket generally, not so much the Hundred. But let’s not have this debate now, it’s exhausting.

32nd over: England 147-9 (Willey 10, Wood 0) This should be mind-blowing, and yet it feels increasingly logical. As Alex Ferguson once said: “When it goes, it goes quickly, and there’s nothing you can do about it.”

“The damage was most likely done over the last two years,” writes Victor Manley. “No consistent attempts to bring in younger players who hang about being excellent in county cricket. Shall we have the central contracts argument, just for fun?”

What’s this argument? I can’t keep up.

Theekshana bowled a leg-side wide to Willey which was collected by the keeper Mendis. He spotted Rashid daydreaming and threw down the stumps at the non-striker’s end. It’s borderline genius from Mendis but so poor from Rashid, another reflection of England’s mental state. (NB: Clip contains lots of adult language and themes. Not the bit I’ve linked to, but the rest of it.)

WICKET! England 147-9 (Rashid run out 2)

From bad to worse to whatever the hell comes next: Adil Rashid has been run out off a wide! Not stumped, run out. I’ve never seen that before.

31st over: England 144-8 (Willey 10, Rashid 1) Poor David Willey, whose World Cup dream has gone wrong again, just in a different way. He tooks a defiant six, the first of the innings.

I find it hard to be angry at this. It’s disappointing, confusing, frustrating and sad, but this group of players have given us so much joy over the past decade. Has there ever been a better England team in any sport? (That question is interrogative, not rhetorical.) If they aren’t the best, they’re certainly at the top table, and they deserve better than the ‘send them home’ crap. It will not stand, man.

“I know we all still love him, but I’m afraid that was yet another disappointing cameMo,” writes Brian Withington. “And as Woakes is deemed ‘out’ then the much-vaunted returning all-rounder triumvirate providing ‘batting depth’ (of despair?) has gone for 16 runs. Never mind being less than Harry Brook’s expected value it’s less than half f what Atkinson scored against South Africa. And he bowled rather well …”

WICKET! England 137-8 (Stokes c sub (Hemantha) b Kumara 43)

And it’s goodnight from England. Stokes pulls Kumara straight to deep midwicket and walks off chuntering to himself. England’s World Cup defence is over before the halfway point.

30th over: England 137-7 (Stokes 43, Willey 4) The mystery offie Theekshana returns to the attack. He hasn’t taken a wicket – yet – but he played a key role in asphyxiating England after the Powerplay. Four from the over, though it wasn’t particularly comfortable for Stokes.

“Hello Rob from sunny Wiltshire,” writes Jack Jarrett. “Thank you for your duty and dedication to the cause - at least the rest of us can turn off this dire spectacle, and forget about it! However, isn’t about time we started to address the elephant in the room? Joe Root perhaps alluded to it, but the Hundred has been a catastrophic indulgence that has done nothing to help England. We’ve reduced amount of 50-over cricket, reduced access for spectators, and all for a form of the game that the rest of the world has essentially laughed off and ignored. I know Sky and the Beeb are in thrall to it, but it’s about time the rest of us stopped drinking the Kool Aid and woke up to the damage it’s inflicting.”

I can’t. I’m not ready to go there, not again. Please don’t make me.

Ouch! Okay. Well, there are folk who know a lot more about this than me, but my first thought is that this particular mess isn’t really about the Hundred. This group of players haven’t missed any 50-over cricket because of the Hundred. England’s World Cup campaign is a complicated case – lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous.
