9.50pm So then, what an exciting day of cricket, and I'm sure the Netherlands players will be partying long into the night! First we had that nail-biter in Dharamsala. And then, Netherlands bouncing back from a record World Cup loss with a comprehensive victory against Bangladesh. This is how things stand right now, and of course tomorrow will have more action with India taking on England in Lucknow. You can find out all about that game in Hemant Brar's highly informative preview. That will be all from us today. Thanks for tuning in! On behalf of Madushka, Ranjith and Thilak, this is Abhimanyu saying bye bye.

9.35pm Presentation ceremony time:

Scott Edwards, the Netherlands skipper: "[On the total] I was sort of speaking to a couple of guys and we thought that if we could get somewhere around 220+, we would have a chance. [On the bowlers] They have all been brilliant. Probably a bit of everything. The system has been getting better in Netherlands. We have had a good 18 months. We feel like we are putting the work in and we are getting some of those rewards. We spoke at the start of the tournament about giving us a chance at the semis and that looks tricky but that'll remain out goal."

Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan : "I thought we bowled really well but we were sloppy in the field. We should have restricted them to 160-170 from the position we were in. But we have been poor with the bat all tournament and this is as bad as it gets. There is more cricket to come and we have to pick up ourselves and I know it's hard but we have to try to finish the tournament on a high. Throughout the tournament we have been struggling, I don't know what's on the players' minds."

Paul van Meekeren is the player of the match: "Pretty special. We said we wanted to go for the semis, you need to win games. Very happy with how we bounced back after Australia. We were pretty confident. At the halfway mark of our innings we thought 230-240 [par score] and we got there. Dutt and van Beek kept it very tight in the first ten overs. Every training we come in and do 20 minutes of fielding. Bassy [Bas de Leede] got a good throw at the stumps tonight. Hard to pick an individual performance. Pure team performance."

Deepak Sapra: "Eden gardens- always the place for memorable matches. This one will go down as one such for the Netherlands "

Mohan : "Very good fighting spirit by the Netherlands team! Hope their dreams of a semifinal spot comes true!!"

9.25pm Netherlands have won twice at the same World Cup for the first time! Another great lower middle order effort and then a disciplined, aggressive bowling display as well as some superb fielding sees Netherlands beat Bangladesh in Kolkata. What a result to mark the first game at Eden Gardens this World Cup! Bangladesh meanwhile will be ruing another indifferent fielding display, with Edwards dropped twice in one over before he went on to hit what turned out to be a match-winning 68. Edwards wasn't the only contributor though, with Wesley Barresi, Sybrand Engelbrecht and Logan van Beek all playing important knocks. And then van Meekeren led the way with the ball after Aryan Dutt drew first blood. Mahmudullah threatened to throw a spanner in the works, but Bas de Leede's brilliant direct hit ended his stand with Mahedi Hasan and he was also out soon after. Mustafizur and Taskin hung around for a while, but by then it was a matter of when Netherlands will complete the win and not if they will.

42.2
W
van Meekeren to Taskin, OUT

Netherlands have won it! The short ball ploy works, with Taskin this time getting bat on ball with his pull. But Bas de Leede runs to his left from deep midwicket and pouches it! Paul van Meekeren takes a bow, as he should! He picks up his career-best figures as Netherlands register a memorable 87-run win!
