    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Netherlands are a side that pride themselves on overcoming any talent or experience deficits through a laser-eyed focus on the aspects of the game within their control, such as fielding and running between the wickets - the latter has been a particular highlight of their game.",
        "While Sri Lanka will still head into this game as nominal favourites - due to all the usual factors such as player ceilings and big-game experience - the margins between these sides are now arguably as fine as they have ever been."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Lucknow surface in the matches played there so far this tournament has shown a propensity for some uneven bounce, rewarding bowlers that stick to a good length or just short of one. Spinners too have found some assistance. But this one is expected to have a touch more grass on it and will perhaps offer a little more to the seamers. The weather is expected to clear and sunny, and with it being a day game both sides should get similar conditions to play with."

        "Sri Lanka haven't lost the opening three games of a World Cup since 1987, when they lost all six of their matches"
