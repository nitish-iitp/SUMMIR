Netherland vs Sri Lanka Highlights: Kusal Mendis-led Sri Lanka on 21 October registered their first win in the ongoing ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023 at Ekana Sports City in Lucknow, when they defeated the Netherlands by 5 wickets with 10 balls remaining.

Chasing a target of 263, Sri Lankan batters started slow, but picked up pace. However, they lost three batter at very short intervals. Pathum Nissanka (54), Sadeera Samarawickrama (91*) and Charith Asalanka (44) made some quality partnership, that led Sri Lanka to a 5-wickets victory against The Netherlands. 

With this, Sri Lanka moved a position up in the ICC points tally and is at number 9 with 2 points. Despite wining against the Dutch team, they are below it, due to Net Run Rate (NRR) difference. SL have played 4 matches as of yet and won just one.
