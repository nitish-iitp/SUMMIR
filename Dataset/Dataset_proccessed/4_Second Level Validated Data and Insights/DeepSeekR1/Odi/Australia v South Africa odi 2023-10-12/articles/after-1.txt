'It was definitely confusing...'
published at 17:47 British Summer Time 12 October 2023
17:47 BST 12 October 2023

Australia batter Marnus Labuschagne was asked in the post-match press conference about the controversial dismissal of Marcus Stoinis after a review by third umpire Richard Kettleborough.

Kettleborough deemed Aussie right-hander had gloved Kagiso Rabada down the leg side, but replays suggested Stoinis' hand was off the bat when the ball grazed that glove. Kettleborough's explanation was both Stoinis' gloves were touching, but that did not appear to be the case on the pictures shown.

Labuschagne said: “The umpires didn’t really know what was going on, they just saw what we saw. So there wasn’t too much going on. To me it looked like his hand was off the bat, it hit the glove and because they didn’t go to the side-on angle, Marcus and I were just asking, ‘have they checked?’ because they just saw the spike from front on and we didn’t see a close up off the side on.

"It looked like there was clear daylight between the two gloves and the handle. But I have been into the third umpire’s room and the screens are pretty big and much clearer than me looking at a pixelated screen.

“Everyone saw the same thing out there. I don’t know what they were saying. There was some talk that it hit the handle of the bat but it was definitely confusing.

"I’m sure we’ll get clarity or will seek clarity because it’s a World Cup and we don’t want small decisions that can be avoided to affect the outcome of the games. With the position we were in, it’s hard to say it affected the outcome but for the future…”

South Africa captain Temba Bavuma: "I think 311 was a couple over par, probably about 290/300 was par. I'm glad we lost the toss because we were going to chase, but I think Quinton getting a score like that needs to be credited a lot.

What would you have improved about the performance?: "Not much, I think I would be really greedy, we could've been stronger towards the end with the bat but we bowled really well. The bowlers have been under some slack for a while, but the guys really dominated that and did really well but I don't want to be greedy.

What did you say at half-time?: "You've got to acknowledge the batting effort and then the bowling effort, we looked to used our skills. Lungi with the new ball, KG with his skills. Within our team, character is the biggest thing we talk about. We were 2-0 down against the Aussies before this, today we showed our character.

Would you bottle up these first two wins if you could? "I think you can't overlook the good work we've done and achieved. We need take the confidence and learning, celebrate our individual performances, come back tomorrow and look to improve again."

Jared Maobe: In their innings, South Africa looked modest today compared to the first match, yet with their fielding they've shown they posses both dimensions. It's too early, but they look like champions in the making.

Judith T: Are we witnessing the total demise of Australian sport? After their embarrassing exit in the Rugby world cup they follow it up with two humiliating defeats in the Cricket world cup. Brilliant.

Andy Purchase: Too many Test players in this Aussie World Cup team. Physically and mentally drained from a long, punishing schedule in England.

On Steve Smith's lbw decision. Three reds come up and I think the way Smith gets across his crease, he's covering all three stumps. If you hit the stumps, you feel as a bowler it is going down the leg stump. However, it is different because of how far across he is coming. It looked funny in real time, but when you look back, you can see why it has come to that conclusion.

The Cricketer's George Dobell: Still think Australia look dangerous. Tough draw for them to start and not at all sure they have the right wicketkeeper, but that seam attack is daunting. Looking ahead, though, some chance their match against England (4 November, Ahmedabad) could effectively be a knock-out.

'We were well off the mark'

Australia captain Pat Cummins: "I thought Quinton de Kock batted really well, we couldn't get a breakthrough but from where they were, we were quite happy and, on that wicket, thought 311 was chaseable.

"It looked like hard work to bat out there at night and it zipped around more than it did in the day, their bowlers bowled really well, but we were well off the mark.

"If we want to be challenging for this tournament we need to find a way in all conditions. That for the bowlers to take wickets and the batters to score runs.

"Not much needs to be said tonight, everyone's hurting. The next game is here in a few days and we'll regroup.

"I wouldn't say there is any one thing we have to look at. They got a few more than we'd like but there are a few things we want to tidy up."

The accepted wisdom is 12 points will earn you a place in the semi-finals. Australia would need to win six of their remaining seven games to achieve that total.

It wasn't a swashbuckling Quinton de Kock innings. He just built up runs and whenever Australia missed, he just punished them.

'We're pleased but things can change quickly'

Player of the match, South Africa's Quinton de Kock: "It was a great win for the boys. We didn't really know how the wicket was going to play but we assessed conditions really well and played accordingly.

"We knew it was going to be a difficult game but it played well and to our strengths to come out on top.

"We felt they were quite potent up front and discussed our scoring options and then went about our work.

"Definitely thought our score was above par. We felt very comfortable. We knew from the Lucknow IPL team that it does get harder to bat second at night.

"It was sweaty and humid in the field but our bowlers bowled with intensity and didn't give them a sniff up front.

"We are pretty pleased with ourselves but we're only two games in and anything can happen. World Cups are strange and things can change quickly so we'll wake up tomorrow and plan for our next game."

Melinda Farrell: South Africa were aggressive, clinical and ruthless. Sure, there may have been a couple of dubious decisions, but Australia were completely outplayed. A lot of questions and if they’re going to reach the knockouts they’ll have to find answers very quickly.

It was a heavyweight against a lightweight by the end of that. South Africa look strong and they've fumbled into a method they find success with.

Not sure about an Ashes hangover, but I really do think that Australia haven’t recovered from the Lord's backlash. They look like a team physically and mentally drained.
