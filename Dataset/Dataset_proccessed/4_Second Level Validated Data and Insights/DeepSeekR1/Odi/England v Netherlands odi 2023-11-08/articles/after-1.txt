England have already crashed out of the Cricket World Cup, which was sealed by the 33-run defeat to Australia, but restored a small amount of pride with a 160-run win over the Netherlands.

That will hopefully have restored some pride to a side that hit rock bottom during the defeat to Pat Cummins’ side, and it has kept them in the hunt for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025, with only the top eight qualifying for that event.

The victory over the Netherlands has moved England from the foot of the table into seventh place.

There will be plenty of time after the tournament for a full analysis of how England’s title defence could go so disastrously wrong with very few warning signs before the squad departed for India, but for now there is a chance to qualify for the next ICC event, with a game against Pakistan to come on 11 November.

England win by 160 runs

Here’s the match report from Pune:

Ben Stokes smashed his first World Cup century as England picked up a consolation win over Netherlands and raised their prospects of salvaging a place at the Champions Trophy.

The 2019 champions arrived in Pune for a bottom-of-the-table clash with a five-match losing streak behind them and the knowledge that another slip up would see them miss out on ODI cricket’s next global event in 2025.

But despite wobbling once again with the bat – going from 133 for one to 192 for six – Stokes had the will and skill to carry his side to a 160-run victory.

England win by 160 runs

Jos Buttler on Stokes: “Any time you need someone to stand up and take charge he seems to be the guy to do that so we’re delighted to have him in the team.

“I thought it was a really good score.”

On Woakes: “He’s a class cricketer, he’s been a brilliant performer from us for a long period of time, that was a great start for us, and the two guys set the tone really well.”

“It’s nice for us to have a game that means a lot and we’ll prepare really well and go there and hopefully have a good game against Pakistan.”

England win by 160 runs

Scott Edwards: “I thought the bowlers did really well to drag it back but again it got away from us, and same old story with the bat.

“I think we held them quite well until the 43rd over, maybe we could have tried a couple of different plans but I thought they batted well.

“We’ll talk about it and figure out what we could have done better.”

England win by 160 runs

Ben Stokes: “I think more pleased for us to get a victory. A tough World Cup but nice to get back on winning terms today.

“It was obviously a nice wicket to bat on but there was a bit of tennis ball bounce and I wanted to take it as deep as I could and then capitalise at the end.”

England win by 160 runs!

England took the last wicket to secure only their second win of the tournament and bring an end to the five-match losing streak.

It was not perfect, and it was not what they are used to, but they have secured that crucial victory to move off the bottom of the table and into seventh place.

Only the top eight qualify for the Champions Trophy and with any hopes of reaching the knockout stages gone a long time ago that has to remain a priority for England.

Wicket! Dutt out for 1 - Netherlands 174-9

That was an absolute beauty from Adil Rashid, it turned and hit off stump, and there was nothing Dutt could do about that.

It would have done for far better batters than that, England are just one wicket away from their second win of the tournament.

Wicket! Van Beek out for 2! -Netherlands 166-7

One wicket has brought two as it so often does!

Van Beek goes for a big sweep and doesn’t get hold of it, Rashid has his second and Malan has another catch.

Wicket! Edwards out for 38! Netherlands 163-6

Ali has his first wicket in the World Cup.

Edwards goes for a big shot but doesn’t get hold of it at all and it’s a straightforward catch for Dawid Malan.

Netherlands 162-5 (33) Edwards 38, Nidamanuru 31, Rashid 1-44 (6)

Rashid has changed ends in the hope that it will bring another breakthrough and put an end to what is becoming a prolific partnership between Edwards and Nidamanuru.

It was a bit too easy for the batters to just knock it around for singles, six runs from the over.
