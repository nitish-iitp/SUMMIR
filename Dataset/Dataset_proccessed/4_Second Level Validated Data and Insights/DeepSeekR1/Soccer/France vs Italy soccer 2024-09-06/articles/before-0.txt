Preview: France vs. Italy - prediction, team news, lineups

Two giants of international football collide on Friday night, as France and Italy kick off their new UEFA Nations League campaigns at Parc des Princes.

While the Azzurri made a dismal defence of their European title during the summer, Les Bleus exited to eventual Euro 2024 winners Spain in the semi-finals; now, the teams convene in Paris.

Although France reached the last four at this year's Euros - and Randal Kolo Muani's early goal in the semi-final loss to Spain gave hope of making it to the final - they rarely convinced, going out after scoring just once outside of set-pieces and own goals.

Captain Kylian Mbappe, who scored only one goal, broke his nose in the opening game against Austria and returned sporting a mask which seemed to inhibit his play, summing up an underwhelming tournament for the 2022 World Cup finalists.

Once again, Didier Deschamps received some criticism for his reserved tactics, but the long-serving coach will now lead Les Bleus into another campaign, with this season's Nations League next up on the agenda.

In addition to claiming global glory back in 2018, Deschamps was in charge for a French victory in the 2021 edition of UEFA's newest competition, but his team finished a distant third in their group last time around, picking up just five points from six games.

France cannot afford such a sub-par showing again in 2024-25, as the nation that finishes bottom of each group will automatically be relegated, while third-placed teams must take part in a playoff to avoid dropping down into League B.

The top two in Group 2 - which also features Belgium and Israel - will qualify for a new quarter-final round, with the winners of those ties progressing to the finals in June of next year.

If France were quite disappointed with their Euros, it is fair to say that Italy were dismayed, as they scraped through a tough group thanks to Mattia Zaccagni's last-gasp goal against Croatia, before bowing out at the first knockout stage.

Luciano Spalletti's side never really found their rhythm, and few complaints could be made when they were sent packing by neighbours Switzerland in the last 16, abruptly ending their title defence.

Reflective as ever, Spalletti has since spoken of bringing clarity and consistency to the Italian set up, while phasing out some established members of his squad and bringing through new blood.

Italy had arrived in Germany unbeaten in six games since Spalletti succeeded Euro 2020-winner Roberto Mancini, who departed after leading the Azzurri to top spot in their most recent Nations League group, and then to third place in the finals.

Before meeting Israel next week, La Nazionale face a tough start to this season's campaign, against opponents they have lost to in their last three friendly meetings but famously defeated in the 2006 World Cup final.

In fact, Friday's game will be Italy's first competitive meeting with France in some 16 years, so an age-old rivalry will finally be renewed at Parc des Princes.

Didier Deschamps has kept faith with most of his Euro 2024 squad for this month's Nations League fixtures, but free agent Adrien Rabiot and Inter Milan defender Benjamin Pavard have both been dropped.

Bayern Munich winger Michael Olise has been called up for the first time, after impressing at the Olympics by recording seven goal involvements as France claimed a silver medal. Recent Roma signing Manu Kone could also make his senior debut.

Another Olympian, Loic Bade, was added to the squad after Chelsea's Wesley Fofana withdrew, citing his need to work on fitness following a long injury layoff.

Ferland Mendy has also pulled out, with Aston Villa left-back Lucas Digne being brought in to replace him; Italy-based Matteo Guendouzi has been drafted in as midfield cover.

Meanwhile, Italy will be without Gianluca Scamacca - who recently suffered an ACL injury - and Nicolo Barella, who has undergone scheduled sinus surgery.

In all, eight players from Luciano Spalletti's Euros squad are absent - including Gianluca Mancini and Jorginho - but there are first call-ups for Marco Brescianini and Caleb Okoli; Destiny Udogie, Moise Kean and Sandro Tonali are among several players returning.

After his tactical tinkering in Germany, Spalletti has spoken of sticking with a back three for the foreseeable future, so Giacomo Raspadori and in-form Atalanta BC striker Mateo Retegui could start up front in a 3-5-2 formation.


France possible starting lineup:
Maignan; Kounde, Saliba, Konate, T. Hernandez; Kante, Tchouameni, Zaire-Emery; Dembele, Thuram, Mbappe

Italy possible starting lineup:
Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Buongiorno, Bastoni; Cambiaso, Ricci, Tonali, Frattesi, Dimarco; Raspadori, Retegui



We say: France 2-0 Italy

While France have been hit by injuries, their well of talent is deep, whereas Italy are rebuilding from a lower base and remain short of quality in key areas.

As a result, the hosts should take maximum points on the opening matchday, leaving the Azzurri with work to do in their upcoming Group 2 contests.
