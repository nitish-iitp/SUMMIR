Argentina vs Ecuador

The veteran winger provided the key moment of quality in an otherwise drab contest

Angel Di Maria grabbed the decisive goal in a drab contest, as Argentina snagged a 1-0 win over Ecuador with Lionel Messi not in the starting lineup.

The Albiceleste were short of their best, dragged into a chippy contest as Messi watched the first hour from the bench. And although the Inter Miami star eventually entered the fray, this game was won by a moment from another one of Lionel Scaloni's veterans.

Lisandro Martinez had Argentina's best chance early on, forcing a clever stop from Hernan Galindez. The Albiceleste took the lead after 40 minutes, with Di Maria starting a well-crafted move before finishing it with a toe-poke from a tight angle.

Scaloni's side offered admittedly little else for the rest of the game. Messi's introduction inside an hour gave them an extra spark in possession, but not much material to show for it. In the end, their defensive acumen was enough, Ecuador left without a shot on target, while the reigning World Cup champions strolled through a forgettable fixture.

GOAL rates Argentina's players from Soldier Field...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Emi Martinez (7/10):

Relatively untroubled throughout, his only job was to judge a few crosses. Didn't have a save to make.

Gonzalo Montiel (6/10):

Held his position defensively, and rarely ventured forward. His main job was to cover for Di Maria.

Cristian Romero (7/10):

Assisted Di Maria's opener. Put in a few typically ferocious tackles - some of which really should have been called for fouls.

Lisandro Martinez (6/10):

Had a good effort in the first half denied. Reliable at the back after an injury-stunted season with Man United.

Marcos Acuna (6/10):

Got forward a bit, but didn't create many chances from wide areas.

Midfield

Leandro Paredes (7/10):

Received it, moved it, and kept play ticking in an otherwise stop-start game.

Rodrigo De Paul (7/10):

Got stuck in, but spent a lot of his time throwing himself on the ground. Does the dirty work every time.

Giovani Lo Celso (6/10):

Didn't offer his usual creativity from the middle, and spent periods as a spectator.

Attack

Julian Alvarez (6/10):

Willing to make runs in behind the defence, and linked play effectively at times. Doesn't get credit for the stuff he does without the ball.

Lautaro Martinez (5/10):

Nonexistent throughout. Managed 21 touches and put one glorious chance right at the goalie.

Angel Di Maria (8/10):

Sloppy for about 10 minutes, before coming alive. Took his goal wonderfully, hit the bar with a free-kick soon after. An excellent hour of work, all said.

Subs & Manager

Lionel Messi (6/10):

A few nice touches. Should have ended the game with an assist had his teammates been more clincial.

Enzo Fernandez (5/10):

Gifted a golden opportunity to make it 2-0, but elected to pass. Otherwise uninvolved.

Nico Gonzalez (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Angel Correa (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Lionel Scaloni (7/10):

Left out Messi from the start, but fielded an otherwise near-full-strength side. Argentina were dragged into a scrappy game, but still managed to win. A solid evening's work.
