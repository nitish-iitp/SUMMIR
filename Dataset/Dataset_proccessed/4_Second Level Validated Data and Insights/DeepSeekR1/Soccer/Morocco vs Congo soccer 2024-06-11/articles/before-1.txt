Preview: Congo vs. Morocco - prediction, team news, lineups

Congo will be back in action on Tuesday when they host Morocco at the Grand Stadium of Agadir in a World Cup qualifying match.

The venue was originally scheduled to be in Kinshasa, but FIFA did not approve its use and the game will now be played in Morocco.

Congo were due to play Niger in a neutral stadium in Kinshasa as their proposed stadium in Brazzaville was not FIFA-approved. However, the match was cancelled due to a late request from Congo to move the game to Brazzaville, which Niger refused.

The Red Devils' upcoming game against Morocco has also been relocated. Originally scheduled for Kinshasa, the match will now be played at Morocco's Grand Stadium of Agadir with official reason for the change in venue yet to be disclosed.

The Central Africans have not played a World Cup qualifier since their 4-2 defeat against Zambia in November, as their second scheduled opponent, Eritrea, withdrew from the qualifiers.

However, Isaac Ngata's men did play an international friendly back in March, drawing 1-1 against Gabon at Stade des Marais in France.

Congo go into Tuesday's clash without a point in Group E and are winless in their last four games across all competitions. They have only won one of their last seven competitive matches since September 2022.

The hosts have a poor record against Morocco, having never won in three meetings, losing twice and drawing once.

Morocco returned to competitive action recently after their surprise exit to South Africa in the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals, securing a 2-1 victory over Zambia in a World Cup qualifier on Friday.

The Atlas Lions took an early lead through a Hakim Ziyech penalty in the sixth minute and doubled their advantage via Eliesse Ben Seghir in the 67th minute. Despite Edward Chilufya pulling one back for Zambia, Morocco held on for the win.

Morocco currently sit top of Group E with six points from two games, three clear of the next three teams behind them.

After their historic performance at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Walid Regragui's men will be eager to qualify for the 2026 edition, and their chances of securing maximum points against Congo have been enhanced by the switch in venue.

Congo opted for a relatively inexperienced group, with 12 players earning their first-ever senior call-up, including Strasbourg's 18-year-old midfielder Rabby Nzingoula and Northampton Town man Will Hondermarck.

Young Boys striker Silvere Ganvoula has netted six goals in 17 international matches and we expect the 27-year-old to be Congo's point man once again.

Morocco are rich with options in their squad, with the trio of Ziyech, Seghir and Brahim Diaz offering support to Youssef En-Neysri who spearheads the attack.

The North Africans also have players like Olympiacos' Europa Conference League hero, Ayoub El Kaabi and Bayer Leverkusen's Amine Adli as bench options.


Congo possible starting lineup:
Vimalin; Illoy-Ayyet, Andzouana, Passi, Tsouka; Makoumbou, Dembi, Avounou Makouta; Ganvoula, Bassouamina

Morocco possible starting lineup:
Bounou; Hakimi, Aguerd, Saiss, Allah; Ounahi, Azzouzi; Ziyech, Diaz, Seghir; En-Nesyri



We say: Congo 0-2 Morocco

With the match getting moved to a venue in Morocco, it becomes even tougher for Congo to pick up any sort of point from this affair. Morocco have an abundance of quality that will be too much for Congo to handle.
