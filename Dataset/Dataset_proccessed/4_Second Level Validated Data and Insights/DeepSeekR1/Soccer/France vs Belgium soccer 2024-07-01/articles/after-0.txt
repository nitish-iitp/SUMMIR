Didier Deschamps’ men march on at Euro 2024. Check out the best facts, stats and live Opta data from a slender win with our France vs Belgium stats page.

Once again, it wasn’t pretty, but France found a way. A hallmark of champions, as they say, and Didier Deschamps’ men keep themselves in the running to be just that thanks to a slender and largely unimpressive 1-0 win over Belgium in Dusseldorf on Monday.

After underwhelming in the group stage, France found themselves stuck with a potentially tricky last-16 opponent in the Red Devils. And although Belgium didn’t offer a great deal going forward themselves, it’s fair to say the 2022 World Cup runners-up weren’t exactly emphatic in victory.

It was scrappy, unspectacular and fairly bruising at times. The important thing for France was they march on to the quarter-finals, but you feel that at some point they’re going to have to find their groove to all the way.

They didn’t here.

While Marcus Thuram and Antoine Griezmann were back in the France starting XI, it was very much a case of as you were with Les Bleus continuing to struggle in the final third.

They looked neat and tidy until that point, though, and there certainly wasn’t an issue of a lack of the ball. France enjoyed nearly 60% possession in the first half and their 92.7% passing accuracy was the fourth highest of any team in the opening 45 minutes of a match at this tournament.

Similarly, their 44 final third entries was more than double Belgium’s 19 and the Red Devils were outshot 9-1 – and yet, France only got one of those, a tame Griezmann effort from outside the box, on target.

Not that anyone who’s watched them in Euro 2024 will have been especially surprised; this was arguably their (and Belgium’s) campaign in a microcosm, with only Serbia (3.8%) having a poorer shot conversion record in the group stage than France and Belgium (4.2% each).

With Belgium seemingly happy to absorb pressure, managing their joint-fewest shots in the first half of a Euros game since 1980 (1), it was clear France were crying out for someone to pick them apart.

Kylian Mbappé looked lively on occasion, embarking on a few adventurous runs, but only once in the first half did he manage to get into the opposition’s box. That might have led to Aurelien Tchouaméni finding the net, but he smashed over not long before the break.

The other particularly notable France chance fell to Marcus Thuram, who headed agonisingly wide from Jules Koundé’s excellent right-wing cross.

Meanwhile, Belgium’s own attempts to be competitive didn’t appear to be helped by Kevin De Bruyne being deployed in a deep role. Wasteful in possession a few times and guilty of a risky pass back to Jan Vertonghen early on that required the centre-back to simply hoof clear, the Manchester City talisman was a bit of a duck out of water.

But a rare foray forward just after the hour seemed to persuade Domenico Tedesco into a change. De Bruyne’s perfectly weighted pass after William Saliba was forced into a mistake saw Yannick Carrasco released in behind the defence, though just when he looked set to pull the trigger, Théo Hernández hooked the ball away with a brilliant last-ditch tackle.

Almost instantly De Bruyne was permanently back into a more advanced position and Belgium suddenly appeared a little livelier in attack. Romelu Lukaku forced Mike Maignan into action, as did De Bruyne himself.

But the otherwise dominant France eventually got the breakthrough – just about. Vertonghen allowed Randal Kolo Muani approximately an hour to turn in the box and get a shot away in the 85th minute, and the effort deflected off the Belgian defender to leave Koen Casteels helpless.

And in many ways it was very France at Euro 2024. Sure, it was a goal, but still a Les Bleus player hasn’t scored in open play at this tournament, with Deschamps’ side now aided by two own goals (the other being vs Austria) and an Mbappé penalty against Poland.

That makes them the first European team to ever reach the quarter-finals of a major international tournament having only scored via own goals or penalties.

Again, the ability to grind out wins is valuable, make no mistake, but France have sleepwalked into the quarters. If they don’t wake up soon, their luck will surely run out eventually.
