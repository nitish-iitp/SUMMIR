Vincent Aboubakar’s second-half strike proved the difference in Garoua as Cameroon beat Namibia 1-0 at the Roumde Adjia Stadium on Saturday, September 7.




The Indomitable Lions struggled in the opening 45 minutes, although they got their act together in the second half and eventually made the breakthrough on 65 minutes to secure all three points in the opening match of their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign.




Marc Brys had made an unbeaten start to his tenure after registering a 4-1 win over Cape Verde and a 1-1 draw with Angola in June’s 2026 World Cup qualifiers, and his team bossed possession in Garoua without creating many chances in the first half.




The visitors threatened as early as the fourth minute with a shot from Peter Shalulile, while at the other end, Edward Maova did well to keep out Carlos Baleba’s fiercely-struck effort from range on six minutes.




Shalulile had another sight at goal on 25 minutes, but Andre Onana was equal to the task to ensure that the score remained goalless at the break.




The Central African giants raised their game in the second half and Jackson Tchatchoua went close on 58 minutes with a shot that flew just wide of the post after he did well to win back possession in the final third.




Bryan Mbeumo then tested Maova at his near post on the hour mark, but the Namibia goalkeeper was eventually beaten five minutes later when he wasn’t able to hold onto the Brentford winger’s shot and Aboubakar pounced on the rebound to open the scoring.




Aboubakar should have scored again in the closing stages following a swift counter from the hosts. However, he failed missed the target after going one-on-one with the keeper.




Deon Hotto was presented with a golden opportunity to equalise in stoppage time after receiving the ball inside the box, but his shot went wayward to the relief of Onana and company.
