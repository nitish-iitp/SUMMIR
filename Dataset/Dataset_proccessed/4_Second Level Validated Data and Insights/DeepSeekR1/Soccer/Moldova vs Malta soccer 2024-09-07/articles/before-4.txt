Malta

Moldova take on Malta in Saturday's Nations League clash, where the hosts are seen as the favorites. Moldova have shown promise in recent fixtures and will look to continue their upward trajectory. A key player for the home side is Ion Nicolaescu, currently plying his trade at Heerenveen. His goal-scoring ability should be crucial in breaking down Malta's defense.

Malta, on the other hand, have struggled away from home, and their form on the road remains a concern. Despite having no injury worries, Malta will need to put in a disciplined and cohesive performance to stand a chance. However, their lack of cutting-edge quality might prove to be their downfall. Given Moldova's home advantage and the presence of a potent forward like Nicolaescu, a home win seems the most likely outcome. Anyhow, the Maltese will need to be at their best to avoid defeat, but Moldova's strength on home soil could see them secure all three points.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (MOLDOVA):

Seeing that they were a part of Soviet Union until 1991, Moldova played their first game as an independent country on July 2, 1991. The Moldovans were beaten by Georgina in front of home fans in Chisinau, but the following year the team recorded their biggest win on the international stage as they rolled over Pakistan 5-0 in Amman, Jordan.

The former Soviet republic have yet to qualify for the finals of the World Cup or the European Championship, but they recorded a couple of thrilling wins in the past. Moldova crushed Montenegro 5-2 in Podgorica in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, but they eventually failed to book their place at the showpiece tournament in Brazil.

The Moldovans were producing fine showings under Igor Dobrovolskiy in the 2008 European Championship qualifiers as well and it has to be noted that they hammered Hungary 3-0 at Stadionul Zimbru on November 17, 2007. Russian Premier League star Alexandru Gatcan is considered one of the most famous Moldavian footballers.
