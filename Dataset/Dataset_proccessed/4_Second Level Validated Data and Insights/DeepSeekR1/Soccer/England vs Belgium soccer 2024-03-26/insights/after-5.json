        "Ivan Toney, speaking to Sky Sports News, said: 'Very special to get on the scoresheet. We would've gone in on a little downer if we had lost the game but thankfully Jude got the goal and I felt we deserved something.'",
        "Jarrod Bowen, speaking to Sky Sports News, says: 'We did leave it late and kept everyone on their toes. It shows the resilience in the squad. We would've been disappointed with two defeats from two games and that's not the standard we have set.'",
        "Belgium's ex-Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen, speaking to Sky Sports News, says: 'It was a tough 90 minutes. If you are 2-1 up with the last ball of the game you have to win the game and unfortunately we didn't.'",
        "England remain unbeaten against Belgium on English soil, winning six and drawing two – the other game they failed to win also saw them come from 2-1 down at half-time to draw 2-2 back in 1964.",
        "Youri Tielemans became the first Belgian player to score at Wembley for both club (for Leicester City against Chelsea in the 2021 FA Cup final) and country. Tielemans was the first player to score two first half goals against England since Tranquillo Barnetta in June 2011 for Switzerland."
