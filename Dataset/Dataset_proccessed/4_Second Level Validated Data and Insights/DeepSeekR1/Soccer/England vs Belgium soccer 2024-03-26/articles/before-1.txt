Head-to-head record

Previous meetings: 26
England wins: 16
Draws: 5
Belgium wins: 5

The ease of travel meant that England and Belgium played numerous friendlies against each other before the advent of major international tournaments, as the inter-war period saw these two face off 10 times, with the Three Lions winning eight - scoring 42 goals in the process.

Shortly after World War Two, England beat Belgium 5-2, 4-1 and 5-0 in three friendlies, before their first competitive meeting at the 1954 World Cup.

In slightly different rules to what we are used to now, the sides drew 4-4 in Basel after extra time despite it being a group fixture, with Ivor Broadis and Nat Lofthouse both scoring twice for the Three Lions, before an own goal by Jimmy Dickinson allowed Belgium to claim a point.

It would be 26 years until they met again competitively, as the two shared the spoils in a group fixture once more at Euro 1980, with Ray Wilkins and Jan Ceulemans scoring inside the opening half-hour in a game marred by crowd violence.

The most well-known meeting between the two from an English perspective is undoubtedly the round-of-16 clash at Italia 90, when David Platt's famous volley past Michael Preud'homme in the 120th minute saw England progress in Bologna.

After just three competitive meetings in history though, the two have now played four since 2018 alone, including two at the World Cup in Russia.

Adnan Januzaj scored a spectacular winner for Belgium in a dead rubber during the group stage, which saw them top the group ahead of England in a group also containing Tunisia and Panama.

The Red Devils would then go on to beat England to the bronze medal in the third-place playoff, thanks to goals from Thomas Meunier and Eden Hazard in St Petersburg.

England and Belgium would then be drawn together again in the UEFA Nations League in 2020, with both games being played behind closed doors amid the COVID-19 lockdowns.

Belgium won the group despite losing 2-1 at Wembley thanks to Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount goals, as strikes from Youri Tielemans and Dries Mertens sealed a 2-0 victory in Leuven to confirm top spot for Roberto Martinez's side.

The Red Devils are still yet to win on English soil in eights attempts, and they have never come closer to doing so than in their most recent trip in March 2024, when Belgium led deep into injury time, before Jude Bellingham spared England's blushes with a leveller in the 95th minute.
