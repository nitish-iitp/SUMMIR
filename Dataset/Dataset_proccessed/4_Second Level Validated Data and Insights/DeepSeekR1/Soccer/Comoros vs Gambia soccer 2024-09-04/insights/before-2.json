        "The Comoros come into the match following an impressive COSAFA Cup campaign which saw them bow out 3-1 to Mozambique on penalties after a 2-2 draw in regulation time in the match for third place.",
        "Les Coelacantes failed to qualify for the 2023 edition of the AFCON, finishing third in their group, six points above Lesotho but six behind Zambia and the eventual tournament winners Ivory Coast.",
        "Since then, though, Stefano Cusin's side have enjoyed an impressive CAF World Cup qualifying campaign so far, currently leading their group with nine points after four matches, a period during which they secured a notable 1-0 win over African giants Ghana in November last year.",
        "The Comoros have participated in seven AFCON qualification campaigns since their first appearance in 2010-11 but have only reached the main draw on one occasion, which was the 2021-22 season where they were knocked out in the round of 16 by Cameroon.",
        "Meanwhile, with Gambia being a part of West Africa, they were not a part of the COSAFA Cup, meaning that their last outing was almost three months ago during the last round of World Cup qualifying.",
        "Unfortunately for the Scorpions, their hopes of reaching the tournament in North America in 2026 are hanging by a thread after managing just three points over the first four matches in the group, currently trailing the automatic qualification places by six points.",
        "Under the guidance of Northern Irish boss Johnny McKinstry, who took up the management role in mid-May, Gambia have played twice, winning the first match 5-1 against Seychelles before losing to Gabon in their last outing.",
        "Gambia are set to feature in their 10th AFCON qualifiers this year and have reached the main draw in each of their last two attempts. They were knocked out in the group stage earlier this year but did reach the quarter-final back in the 2021-22 edition.",
        "Comoros form (all competitions): W, L, W, W, L, L",
        "Gambia form (all competitions): L, L, L, L, L, W",
        "Ben El Fardou scored in each of the Comoros' last two World Cup qualification matches and will almost certainly lead the line for Les Coelacantes in midweek.",
        "Fardou is likely to be joined in the attack by left-winger Myziane Maolida, who is currently on loan at newly promoted Saudi Pro League side Al-Kholood from Hertha BSC.",
        "The Gambia squad have gathered in Casablanca ahead of Wednesday's match and among the players are two new faces in Momodou Lion Njie and Lamin Saidy, who will be hoping to make their debuts.",
