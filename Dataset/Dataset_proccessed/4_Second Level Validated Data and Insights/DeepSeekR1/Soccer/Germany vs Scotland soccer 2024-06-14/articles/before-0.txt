Billy Gilmour shared some thoughts ahead of his team's big match against Germany

Some of the Scotland squad have been sharing their thoughts ahead of the match, explaining what it means for the country ahead of such a big game.

"We know that's what's at stake," said captain Andy Robertson ahead of the match.

"We have to be at our best and if we can do that, who knows where we'll be come 23 June."

"I think we should all be proud that we're here," said Scotland manager Steve Clarke.

"It's been a long time since 1998 when we actually travelled abroad to appear in a tournament like this.

"We're proud we've been able to do back-to-back tournaments and hopefully by the end of this we'll be even more proud at having done something a bit more special."

Lots of Scotland fans have travelled to Munich to support their team on Friday

Defender Scott McKenna thinks the fans will be a real boost for the squad.

"It's a great opportunity for them to come and experience a tournament on foreign soil for the first time in a long time," he explained.

"I think the Tartan Army will be very excited, they're travelling in their numbers and I hope we can put in a performance they can be proud of and celebrate as well.

"The ambition is to try and get out of the group, but the only way we can do that is to take it one game at a time. This week we are only focused on Germany."
