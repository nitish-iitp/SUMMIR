DOHA: Lebanon and China PR settled for a 0-0 draw in their AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023Group A match at the Al Thumama Stadium on Wednesday.

The result took China PR to two points while it was Lebanon’s first with both teams having much to do on Matchday Three if they are to advance to the Round of 16.

Both sides needed victory, with China held 0-0 by Tajikistan while Lebanon suffered a 3-0 defeat to defending champion Qatar in their opening match.

Lebanon were the quicker to settle and they took the game to a China side who looked shaky each time they came under pressure.

With five minutes gone, Lebanon’s Khalil Khamsi saw his header from Kassem El Zein’s throw-in collected safely by goalkeeper Yan Junling while at the other end, Wu Lei took advantage of a loose ball from defender Nour Mansoor to set up Lui Bin Bin but the latter’s effort was punched away by Lebanese custodian Mostafa Matar.

Both sides continued to exchange blows with striker Omar Chaban the Lebanese livewire, with his right-footed attempt hitting the side netting.

Dai Weijun forced Matar into action moments later, with the custodian needing two attempts to deny the China number 9.

It was Lebanon, however, who should have gone into the break ahead but Hasan Matouk’s right footed shot from outside the box was denied by the crossbar.

China started the second half on the front foot with Zhang Linpeng’s header from the centre of the box having to be parried away.

However, it was again Lebanon who came the closest to breaking the deadlock but midfielder Hasan Srour’s right-footed shot from outside the box was fisted away by Junling, who almost immediately had to ward off a dangerous header from defender Maher Sabra.

The West Asians survived a similar scare soon after when Srour denied Wu Lei’s shot from inside the six yard box.

Both sides rang in the changes in the remaining minutes but a breakthrough eluded them, leaving their knockout stage hopes hanging in the balance.

China will face hosts Qatar on Monday while Lebanon will cross swords with debutants Tajikistan.
