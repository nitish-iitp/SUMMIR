After competing at the Copa America in the summer, Bolivia and Venezuela will resume 2026 World Cup qualifying when they face off at Estadio Municipal El Alto on Thursday.

Bolivia are languishing in ninth place with three points to their name, while Venezuela are in fourth position after taking nine points from six matches.

The hosts are set to resume their World Cup qualifying bid after experiencing a disappointing campaign at the 2024 Copa America in the USA

La Verde suffered three consecutive defeats against USA, Uruguay and Panama, condemning them to a fourth consecutive group-stage exit at the Copa America.

Their poor performance at the Copa America ultimately led to the sacking of Antonio Carlos Zago and the subsequent appointment of Oscar Villegas.

The 54-year-old is tasked with leading his country to their third World Cup and their first finals appearance since the 1994 tournament in the USA.

However, achieving qualification will be easier said than done because Bolivia have made an underwhelming start to their campaign, with their six qualifiers producing one win against Peru and five defeats against Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay.

In contrast to their opponents, Venezuela made a knockout-round appearance at the Copa America after winning all three of their group matches against Ecuador, Mexico and Jamaica.

Unfortunately for Venezuela, their Copa America journey ended with a penalty-shootout defeat in their quarter-final tie against Canada.

After putting that disappointment behind them, La Vinotinto are now looking to create history by qualifying for their first-ever World Cup finals.

Fernando Batista will be encouraged by his side's start to the qualifying campaign after seeing his side bounce back from a defeat against Colombia to take points from their next five qualifiers.

They recorded home wins against Paraguay and Chile on either side of an away draw against Brazil, before they drew their last two qualifiers against Ecuador and Peru in November 2023.

Despite showing plenty of promise, Venezuela are still waiting to end their 12-game winless away run in World Cup qualifying.

Luis Haquin is expected to wear the captain's armband, with the defender set to operate in a back three alongside Hector Cuellar and Marcelo Suarez.

Boris Cespedes, who plays his club football in the Swiss Super League, is likely to feature in central midfield alongside LDU Quito's Gabriel Vilamil.

Carmelo Algaranaz is set to be given the responsibility of leading the line, and the striker will be looking to score his first competitive goal in international football.

As for the visitors, they are unable to call upon Jhon Chancellor and Yangel Herrera after the pair pulled out of the squad due to injury.

Nahuel Ferraresi is set to operate in a centre-back pairing with Yordan Osorio, while Jon Aramburu and Miguel Navarro are poised to feature as the two full-backs.

Rondon netted three goals in four matches to finish as the second-highest scorer at the Copa America, and he will attempt to continue that form when he leads the line against Bolivia.


Bolivia possible starting lineup:
Viscarra; Cuellar, Haquin, Sagredo; Rocha, Cespedes, Villamil, Fernandez; Miguelito, Vaca; Algaranaz

Venezuela possible starting lineup:
Romo; Aramburu, Ferraresi, Osorio, Navarro; Rincon, Martinez; Bello, Segovia, Machis; Rondon



We say: Bolivia 1-2 Venezuela

Venezuela will be targeting maximum points against a nation that has lost five of their six qualifiers, but we think that they may have to settle for a draw after failing to win any of their previous 12 away matches in World Cup qualifying.
