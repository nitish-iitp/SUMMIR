Morocco vs Tanzania LIVE!

Morocco kick off their Africa Cup of Nations tournament this evening having been heavily fancied to go far. It is a tough Group F which also features past winners DR Congo and Zambia, who face off after the game.

The Atlas Lions impressed plenty with their run to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals, and will consider anything less than matching that achievement in Ivory Coast a significant disappointment. Achraf Hakimi is the star name, but Premier League fans will be firmly aware of both Hakim Ziyech and Sofyan Amrabat's talents.

Tanzania stand in their way of making a fast start today, and are unlikely to pose too much of a threat. Tanzania missed the last AFCON, and lost all three games of the 2019 tournament, but are they hopes of getting on the board this time around should forward Mbwana Samatta bring his A game.

80min: Another and it's En-Nesyri at the fourth time of asking! He fires home Ounahi's perfect cross from the right.

GOAL!

77min: This could be the second of a few more as Ounahi combines superbly with a team-mate to slot home from the edge of the area.
