Picture from Congo's match with Guinea

Rabat - DR Congo sealed tonight its ticket to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) semi-finals with a commanding ​​3-1 victory against Guinea.

The match, which began as a closely contested battle, saw DR Congo pull away with late goals, leaving Guinea struggling to recover.

The 82nd minute proved to be decisive for the Congolese as Arthur Masuaku, one of the team’s key players, added to his tally with a remarkable goal. Masuaku’s goal put DR Congo in a commanding position with a 3-1 lead in the last minutes of the game. 

The game’s turning point came in the 65th minute when DR Congo’s Yoane Wissa scored from the penalty spot to give his team a 2-1 lead and ultimately showed his teammates the way to sealing their qualification to the next round.

The first half of the game ended with both teams locked in a 1-1 draw. DR Congo captain Chancel Mbemba equalized for his team in the 27th minute after conceding a 21st-minute penalty that Mohamed Bayo had converted for Guinea.  

As the second half kicked off with the referee’s whistle, both teams looked eager to break the deadlock. 

Guinea’s Issiaga Sylla attempted to create an attacking opportunity in the 47th minute, sending a cross from the top of the box into the penalty area. But the DR Congo defense dealt comfortably with the cross, intercepting the long ball.

DR Congo’s Arthur Masuaku tried a through ball from a corner kick in the 50th minute, but the opportunity went begging as the opposition defense cleared the ball away.

The solid-looking and now spirited DR Congo team is set to face host Ivory Coast or Mali in the semifinals on Wednesday next week.
