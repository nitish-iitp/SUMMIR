        "Iceland comes into this game sitting in 3rd place in the group having picked up three points. Iceland in the last game faced off against Turkey and they really struggled. Iceland scored only a goal and the defense gave up three goals and that led to the defeat. Victor Palsson scored in the 37th minute. Iceland had 35 percent of the possession and one shot on target. Sverrir Ingi Ingason has returned to the team and he’s going to need to have a huge game here. Alfons Sampsted and Willum Thor Willumsson are both looking to move into the starting lineup and they are going to need to be strong here.",
        "Wales comes into this game sitting 2nd place in the group having picked up four points. Wales faced off against Montenegro and the offense scored two goals and they ended up winning by a goal. Kieffer Moore scored in the 1st minute and Harry Wilson scored in the 3rd minute and that was the difference. Wales had 49 percent of the possession and three shots on target. Joe Allen was retired from international play but he’s back now and he’s going to need to have a strong game here. David Brooks, Nathan Broadhead and Wes Burns have all been called up and they are going to need to be playmakers here."
