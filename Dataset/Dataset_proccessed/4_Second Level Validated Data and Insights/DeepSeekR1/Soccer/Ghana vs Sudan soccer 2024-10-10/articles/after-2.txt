Black Stars players

The Black Stars of Ghana face Sudan in the 2025 African Cup of Nations qualifiers at the Accra Sports Stadium on October 10, 2024, in a crucial tie.

Head coach Otto Addo has assured the public that the team is well prepared for the game despite the withdrawals of some key players, including Thomas Partey.

Mohammed Kudus has been named the captain for the Black Stars by coach Otto Addo to lead the team against Sudan.

The decision was made following the absence of substantive captain Andre Dede Ayew, who was called up to join the squad, and also his deputy Thomas Partey, who could not join the team due to injury.

The Black Stars' doubleheader against Sudan will have a major impact on Ghana’s chances of qualifying for the 2025 AFCON after failing to win their first two games.

Ghana occupy the third position with one point in Group F of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers after two matches.

Angola lead the group with six points, followed by Sudan in second position with three points after two games.

A defeat or draw for the Black Stars will likely diminish the chances of the team qualifying for the 2025 AFCON.
