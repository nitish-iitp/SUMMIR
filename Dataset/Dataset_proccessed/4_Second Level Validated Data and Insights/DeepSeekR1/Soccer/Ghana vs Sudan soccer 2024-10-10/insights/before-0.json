        "Otto Addo has selected a strong 25-man squad featuring key players like Thomas Partey, Jordan Ayew, Mohammed Kudus, Antoine Semenyo, and Inaki Williams. The team also includes rising stars from local leagues, such as Fredrick Asare, to inject fresh energy and provide opportunities for homegrown talent to shine. Ghana is grouped with Sudan, Angola, and Niger in Group F, and a win against Sudan would significantly boost their qualification chances for the 2024 AFCON tournament."
