        "Carsley expressed hope that Harry Kane would at least make the bench on Thursday after suffering an injury while playing for Bayern Munich, but the England captain was not involved whatsoever, rendering him a massive doubt for the journey to Scandinavia too.",
        "A penny for Mikel Arteta's thoughts when Bukayo Saka limped off with an apparent hamstring injury early in the second half against Greece; his likely absence should see either Cole Palmer or his Chelsea colleague Noni Madueke start on the right flank.",
        "Kyle Walker, Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher could also be the beneficiaries of some necessary rotation, but Jack Grealish is also touch-and-go after sitting out Thursday's game with a knock.",
        "Finland emerged physically unharmed from their narrow defeat to Iceland, although Sparta Prague midfielder Kaan Kairinen withdrew from the squad due to injury before this month's fixtures began.",
        "Kanerva's decision to start Pohjanpalo over all-time leading scorer Teemu Pukki was initially justified on Sunday, although the latter - who is now making nets bulge in MLS for Minnesota United - may come into contention for a start this weekend given the quick turnaround time."
