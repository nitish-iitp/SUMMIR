Guinea Vs Senegal

Rabat - In order to prove its presence in the ongoing AFCON for the third time in a row, the defending champion Senegal is aiming to win today against its Guinean counterpart in order to earn 9 points in the Group C standings.

Supporters watching from the sideline in Cote d’Ivoire will gather for this key meeting at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium in Yamoussoukro, while those watching remotely can follow the match on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, and Sky Sports Ultra HDR.

Champions of the last AFCON edition in 2021, Senegal have embarked on a successful journey this year so far by defeating Gambia 3-0 and five-time champion Cameroon 3-1. Under the management of head coach Aliou Cisse, these Teranga Lions will seek to continue on the same track of success to achieve a third win streak.

However, the Guinean team has not proved an easy opponent in this year’s tournament, as it managed to draw its first game against renowned Cameroon 1-1, despite playing with ten men since the end of the first half.

Showcasing their fighting spirit, given to them by their head coach Kaba Diawara, the Guinean National Elephants secured their first win against Gambia 1-0, securing them 4 points and the second position in Group C standings.
