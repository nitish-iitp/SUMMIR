Initial reactions and observations
Well that was certainly a game of football. Germany made the second half needlessly complicated by allowing Džeko to score from a corner, but otherwise it was a comfortable performance.
Three goals ruled out due to offside — Nagelsmann may want to have a word with his players about that.
Deniz Undav is looking like the striker that Germany have been begging for. He seems to be in great form right now, an ominous sign given that Stuttgart play against Bayern Munich right after this break ends.

Full time: Bosnia and Herzegovina 1-2 Germany.

70’ — Goal. Džeko scores from a corner, 2-1.

45’ — The second half is underway!

Halftime: Germany lead 2-0.

35’ — Goal. Undav makes it 2-0!

29’ — Goal. Undav makes it 1-0!

Kickoff: We’re underway!

One hour until kickoff: We have lineups!

It’s only October but Julian Nagelsmann is dealing with so many injuries he may fancy himself back at Bayern Munich already. Despite this, expectations are high for Germany in this international break, given how the team seems to be trending upwards. All eyes will be on the goalkeepers this time — Alexander Nübel is set to start vs Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Oliver Baumann expected to play vs the Netherlands. With ter Stegen expected to be out for almost a year, these keepers could make a case for taking the spot as the German #1 keeper in this break.
