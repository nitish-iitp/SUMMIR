        "Argentina boss Scaloni, who will serve a touchline ban, has confirmed that changes will be made to his starting lineup and those who did not feature in their opening two group matches 'will play' against Peru.",
        "Legendary attacker Lionel Messi has been ruled out of Saturday's contest after tweaking his right hamstring against Chile; the Inter Miami star revealed that the issue is 'nothing serious' but he did 'find it difficult to move freely' towards the end of the win over Chile, and he will subsequently watch from the sidelines against Peru.",
        "The absence of Messi could see Lautaro Martinez handed his first start of the tournament alongside Julian Alvarez, while Angel di Maria and Alejandro Garnacho will also be pushing to start in attack.",
        "As for Peru, they will be without the suspended Miguel Araujo following his red card against Canada, so Anderson Santamaria could be brought into the first XI to start alongside Carlos Zambrano and Alexander Callens in a three-man defence.",
        "Luis Advincula watched on as an unused substitute after sustaining an Achilles injury in their opening group fixture, and it remains to be seen whether the 34-year-old will be fit to feature on Saturday - Marcos Lopez could therefore continue at left wing-back.",
        "Three-time Copa America Golden Boot winner and Peru's all-time leading scorer and Paolo Guerrero (39 goals) needs one more strike to equal the late Teodoro Fernandez for the most goals scored by a Peruvian in the tournament's history (15).",
        "Argentina possible starting lineup: Armani; Montiel, Otamendi, Pezzella, Acuna; Mac Allister, Rodriguez, Palacios; Di Maria, La. Martinez, Garnacho.",
        "Peru possible starting lineup: Gallese; Santamaria, Zambrano, Callens; Polo, Pena, Cartagena, Quispe, Lopez; Lapadula, Flores.",
        "We say: Argentina 2-0 Peru"
