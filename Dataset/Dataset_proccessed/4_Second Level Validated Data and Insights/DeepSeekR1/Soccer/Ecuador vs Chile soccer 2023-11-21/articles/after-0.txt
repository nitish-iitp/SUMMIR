How to watch the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifiers match between Ecuador and Chile, as well as kick-off time and team news.

Ecuador will take on Chile in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers at the Rodrigo Paz Delgado Stadium on Tuesday. Both teams are on five points after five rounds of games and will be looking for a win to climb up the standings.

Ecuador are heading into the fixture on the back of two consecutive goalless draws against Venezuela and Colombia. They will be desperate for goals and points in the games to come.

Chile's form has been worse. They have only managed one win in five qualifiers. And that came against Peru, wherein Diego Valdes and Marcelino Nunez scored a goal each to register a 2-0 win.

Here GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch, including TV channel, streaming details and more.
