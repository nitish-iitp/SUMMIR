How is the Ecuadorian national team coming along?

The Ecuadorian national team comes from a valuable draw in Venezuela with no goals, a game that had many arrivals and for much of the game they suffered a lot because of the pressure exerted by Venezuela, finally getting a point to place in 6th position with 5 points and a record of 2 wins, 2 draws and a loss, They will be looking for a win against Chile, taking advantage of the fact that they will be playing with their fans and in their stadium. If they win tomorrow, they could be in 4th position, which is why tomorrow's match is so important, this is how Ecuador arrives at the 6th round of the Qualifying Round for the 2026 World Cup.
