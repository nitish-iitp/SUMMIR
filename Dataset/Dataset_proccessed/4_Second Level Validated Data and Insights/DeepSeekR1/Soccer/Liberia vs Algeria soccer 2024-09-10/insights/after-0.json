        "The Lone Star, having failed to win any of the previous six meetings between the two nations, will be aiming to break that trend and secure their first victory of the campaign.",
        "Algeria, meanwhile, has secured three wins from their four World Cup qualifying matches in Group G, putting them at the top of the table, level on nine points with second-placed Mozambique, which holds the playoff spot.",
        "Liberia is currently on a five-game unbeaten streak across all competitions, with three draws and two wins, including a 1-0 victory over São Tomé and Príncipe in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.",
        "Algeria’s captain Riyad Mahrez will miss the match due to injury, but Baghdad Bounedjah, who is one goal shy of Mahrez’s tally for the Greens, is expected to lead the attack alongside Saïd Benrahma. Houssem Aouar, Ismaël Bennacer, and Ramiz Zerrouki are likely to form the midfield trio.",
        "Liberia’s coach Mario Marinica is expected to field a similar lineup to the one that faced Togo, with Peter Wilson, Terry Sackor, and captain Oscar Dorley leading the Lone Star’s attack. Kemoh Kamara, Natus Swen, and Viktoria Plzeň’s Sampson Dweh are likely to form the defensive trio.",
        "Despite their home advantage, Marinica and his team will need to be at their best against Algeria, who remain unbeaten in their last six encounters with Liberia. The Desert Foxes boast the firepower to secure all three points, and they are widely tipped to do so against the Lone Star."
