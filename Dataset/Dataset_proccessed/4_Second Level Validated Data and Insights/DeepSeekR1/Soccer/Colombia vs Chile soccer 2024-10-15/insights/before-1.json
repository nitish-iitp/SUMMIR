        "Colombia will look to recover from a shock defeat last week when they host bottom-placed Chile in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying on Tuesday.",
        "Chile are a much different team now though, as yet another defeat on Thursday saw them fall into last position in the CONMEBOL standings.",
        "Colombia remain in second, though, as Uruguay also lost last week, and the gap to Argentina at the top is only three points.",
        "Playing at home has often yielded much better results for the hosts, as Colombia have taken 10 points from a possible 12 in Barranquilla in this campaign.",
        "Chile have proven difficult opponents over the years, winning only once at home to their upcoming opponents since 2001.",
        "Colombia will be glad of the home comforts in Barranquilla and should bounce back to maintain their spot in the top two.",
        "Slipping to the foot of the standings will demoralise Chile even more after what was already a gut-wrenching defeat late on against Brazil."
