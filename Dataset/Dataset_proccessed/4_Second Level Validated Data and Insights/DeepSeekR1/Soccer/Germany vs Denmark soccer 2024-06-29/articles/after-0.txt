WHAT UEFA SAID

"Due to adverse weather conditions (thunderstorms and heavy rain) in Dortmund, it has been decided to suspend the UEFA EURO 2024 Round of 16 match between Germany and Denmark. UEFA will make an announcement on the resumption of the match in due course," a statement from UEFA read.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

The game was stopped for just over 15 minutes before the players returned to the pitch to finish the final 10 minutes of the first half. The Germans thought they had taken a 1-0 lead six minutes into the game when Nico Schlotterbeck headed home a Toni Kroos corner but Joshua Kimmich was adjudged to have committed a foul. The game stopped with the scores level at 0-0.
