        "Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann is at risk of being without both of his first-choice centre-backs for Saturday's Euro 2024 last-16 clash with Denmark at the Signal Iduna Park.",
        "Die Mannschaft clinched seven points from an available nine to qualify for the knockout rounds as group winners, but in their final contest with Switzerland, Jonathan Tah picked up his second yellow card of the competition.",
        "The Bayer Leverkusen man must therefore serve a one-match ban in Dortmund, and there is concern over his regular partner Antonio Rudiger, who is struggling with a thigh injury and did not train with his teammates earlier this week.",
        "However, the Real Madrid defender's issue is not thought to be serious enough to keep him out of Saturday's game, where his new colleague should be Nico Schlotterbeck due to Tah's suspension.",
        "Waldemar Anton and Robin Koch are ready to deputise for Rudiger if required, while Joshua Kimmich and Maximilian Mittelstadt are undisputed starters in front of Manuel Neuer.",
        "The same can be said for midfield duo Robert Andrich and Toni Kroos - the latter of whom may play the last match of his career if Germany are eliminated - while Ilkay Gundogan pulls the strings further ahead of them.",
        "Niclas Fullkrug's late leveller versus Switzerland took him up to two goals at Euro 2024, one more than striker rival Kai Havertz, in spite of the Arsenal man starting all three matches so far.",
        "Fullkrug could hardly be doing more for a start on his home turf, but Havertz is still expected to lead the line from the off, with support from the effervescent Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz.",
        "Germany possible starting lineup: Neuer; Kimmich, Schlotterbeck, Rudiger, Mittelstadt; Kroos, Andrich; Musiala, Gundogan, Wirtz; Havertz."
