FT: Regulation time over...time for pens!

It's a wonderful moment for Suarez, who saved Uruguay in likely his final international match. So close, but yet so far for Canada.




Off to penalties we go!

90+4: Lesson learned

Man, you gotta feel for Canada. After dominating the second half, Les Rouges got the rug pulled out from them right at the end. Lesson learned, you cannot switch off -- even for a second.

Time to defend

Yes, Canada is minutes away from a tremendous third-place finish. But, there's work to do. Defense must remain strong, and Canada must keep pushing. At the end of matches, Marsch's side sometimes switches off. Now's the time for mental focus.

Food for thought

Fun fact, Uruguay is ranked 14th in the world according to FIFA, while Canada is ranked 48th. Canada's ranking surely must change after this tournament is over.

Well-deserved lead for Les Rouges

David pounces on a loose ball in the box, calmly sliding the ball past Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet. You can't say the lead isn't deserved.




Marsch's side has pushed and pressed. Eight minutes to go...can Canada hold on?

Luis Suarez denied

While Canada has had chances, so has Uruguay. Luis Suarez has been relatively out of the picture since walking on at the half, but missed a big chance after he was unmarked in the box. Canada must be careful in the final 15.

CHANCE! Davies goes wide

Remember to breathe, Canada! Alphonso Davies' super strike goes just wide. Canada is knocking on the door...can Les Rouges make it two and prevent a penalty shootout?

71’ - Davies has a go from range which is ever so slightly deflected, just wide of the Uruguayan goal for a corner!

🇨🇦 1-1 🇺🇾#CANURU #CopaAmerica
