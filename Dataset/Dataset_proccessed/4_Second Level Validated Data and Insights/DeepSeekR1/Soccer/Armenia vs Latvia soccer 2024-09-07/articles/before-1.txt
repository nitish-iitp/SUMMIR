Prediction: 2-1

	

Latvia

After failing to book their place at the EURO 2024, Armenia will look to kick off their Nations League campaign in style when they face Latvia at Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium. The Armenians continue life without Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who retired from international football and nowadays captain Varazdat Haroyan is the team’s most influential player. The likes of Hovhannisyan, Bichakhchyan, and M’gladbach forward Ranos made the cut as well.

The Latvians, on the other hand, were struggling in the EURO 2024 qualifiers as well, with the team collecting only three points in total in the process. As Latvia are not regarded as good travellers, we predict that the hosts are going to emerge triumphant in Saturday’s showdown. A man to watch in the visiting team will be Daejeon attacker Vladislavs Gutkovskis, who has netted 11 goals in 45 appearances for the national team.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (ARMENIA):

Armenia footballers played for Soviet Union national football team until 1991, when the country declared independence. The Football Federation of Armenia was founded the following year and they quickly established relations with both FIFA (1992) and UEFA (1993).

Despite the fact that Manchester United ace Henrikh Mkhitaryan plays for the Armenia national football team, the Havakakan have yet to qualify for the finals of a major tournament. Mkhitaryan is undisputedly the team’s most famous footballer, but we should mention former Ajax striker Edgar Manucharyan as well, who is in the twighlight of his career. Armenia played their first international game against Moldova in October, 1992 and it has to be noted that they played out a goalless draw with the former Soviet republic.

The Armenians have slim chances of qualifying for the FIFA World cup 2018 finals, but they did well to beat Montenegro in the process. Armenia footballers wear red shirts and red shorts when playing at home ground (Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium), while the colour of their away kits is white.
