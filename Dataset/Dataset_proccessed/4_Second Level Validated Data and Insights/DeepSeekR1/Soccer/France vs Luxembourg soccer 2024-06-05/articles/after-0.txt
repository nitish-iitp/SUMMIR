France player ratings vs Luxembourg: Kylian Mbappe misses chance to fill his boots as blunt Bleus labour to pre-Euro 2024 victory over minnows

Friendlies

Kylian Mbappe may have scored but he could have had a hat-trick as France laboured to a 3-0 win over Luxembourg in a Euro 2024 warm-up friendly.

France opened the scoring just before half-time, as the new Real Madrid forward stood up a cross to Randal Kolo Muani, who sent a header into the bottom corner.

Les Bleus, naturally, dominated possession against the minnows but Luxembourg frustrated a strong frontline throughout the first period, and only headed into half-time one goal down.

It was a laboured display from the French throughout the first hour, with Didier Deschamps' men seeing plenty of the ball but having very little to show for it.

It took a stunner to give France some breathing space with 20 minutes to go, as Jonathan Clauss produced a thunderbolt from the edge of the box.

Luxembourg kept plugging away and hit the bar late on, as they came within an inch of shocking the World Cup finalists, but it was Mbappe who had the last word.

Having missed a host of chances, the new Real Madrid Galactico poked home Bradley Barcola's cross to add some sheen to the scoreline.

Goalkeeper & Defence

Mike Maignan (6/10):

Barely troubled but did what he needed to do. Beaten late on but was saved by the crossbar.

Jules Kounde (7/10):

Had more to do in the final third than his own half. Some excellent deliveries into the box. Replaced after the hour. A fine display.

Dayot Upamecano (6/10):

A gentle outing in which he was barely tested. Replaced by Saliba at half-time.

Ibrahima Konate (6/10):

Much like Upamecano, the game took place largely in front of him.

Theo Hernandez (6/10):

Bombed forward whenever possible and gave Luxembourg a defensive headache throughout the first half. Replaced at half-time by Clauss.

Midfield

N'Golo Kante (5/10):

Always assured in possession but did nothing to create a chance. That may not be his job, but the lack of forward thrust was noticeable. Zaire-Emery replaced him after the hour.

Youssouf Fofana (6/10):

Involved throughout. One long-range effort tested the goalkeeper. Usually a defensive midfielder but here played the role of quarter-back.

Antoine Griezmann (5/10):

Hit the post early on. Couldn't really flex his creative muscles. Missed a big chance late on after being picked out by Clauss in the box. Subbed. A difficult night.

Attack

Randal Kolo Muani (6/10):

Opened the scoring with a smart header. Faded thereafter but some smart runs and always willing to drop off to collect possession.

Marcus Thuram (4/10):

A bizarrely timid performance. One shot in the first half but barely involved beyond that in a showing that will have done nothing to convince Deschamps he should be leading the line regularly.

Kylian Mbappe (6/10):

Forced an excellent save with a volley on the run. Assisted Kolo Muani's opener with a clever cross and scored late on after Barcola fed him in the box. Could have had a hat-trick had he had his shooting boots on, and will be mightily relieved to have found the net.

Subs & Manager

Jonathan Clauss (7/10):

Replaced Hernandez at half-time and was equally full of running. Scored a truly brilliant goal, slamming an effort into the top corner from the edge of the box.

William Saliba (6/10):

Replaced Upamecano at the interval. Much like the man he replaced, barely touched the ball.

Warren Zaire-Emery (6/10):

Replaced Kante. Moved the ball well.

Benjamin Pavard (6/10):

On for Kounde but barely affected the game.

Bradley Barcola (7/10):

On for his debut. A superb assist for Mbappe as he won the ball, shimmied his way into the box, and found his team-mate.

Olivier Giroud (N/A):

On late on.

Eduardo Camavinga (N/A):

A late introduction.

Didier Deschamps (6/10):

Will have been troubled by just how blunt his side were, especially in the first half. They found some fluency in the second period but he will know they must improve as Euro 2024 looms.
