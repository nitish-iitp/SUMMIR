Euro 2024: Poland looking to extend incredible unwanted France run

Poland will be looking to extend an unwanted major tournament record held by France when they meet at Euro 2024 on Tuesday evening.

Michal Probierz's side were the first side to be officially eliminated from the competition on Friday after losing their opening two matches.

After being edged out by a Netherlands comeback on matchday one, Poland were outclassed by Austria in their second fixture last week.

The Eagles are now only playing for pride, and that will be on show when they go up against one of the tournament favourites and 2022 World Cup runners-up.

Les Bleus are the clear favourites to come through the contest at Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, yet they will have to end one of their most bizarre streaks in their history.

France bidding to end 18-year streak

Since 2006, France have reached four tournament finals, winning the 2018 World Cup and finishing as runners-up in the other three competitions.

There has only been two occasions were they have failed to progress to the knockout stages, providing them with one of the most impressive records over the aforementioned period.

However, France have incredibly not won their final group-stage fixture in any tournament since beating Togo 2-0 at the 2006 World Cup.

During that run, a total of four draws and four defeats have been posted, suggesting that Didier Deschamps's side will not necessarily have it all their own way.

That said, France have not lost a single group game at a Euros under Deschamps, a streak which has lasted eight matches.

France defending lengthy unbeaten run against Poland

In all competitions, France have not suffered a single defeat to Poland since 1982, a streak which has lasted eight contests.

That fixture in question was the third-place playoff at the World Cup in that year, but France would win 3-1 in the last 16 at the 2022 World Cup.

Poland are also bidding to avoid losing every game in a European Championship group stage for the first time in their history.
