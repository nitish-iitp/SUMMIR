Euro 2024: Germany's Toni Kroos praises two Spain stars ahead of quarter-final

Germany midfielder Toni Kroos has talked up the qualities of Spain duo Rodri and Lamine Yamal ahead of Friday's Euro 2024 quarter-final showdown in Stuttgart.

While Die Mannschaft picked up seven points from three group-stage games before beating Denmark 2-0 in the last 16, La Roja are the only nation at this summer's tournament who still boast a perfect record from four matches.

Luis de la Fuente's side beat Croatia, Italy and Albania to finish top of Group B before coming from behind to secure an impressive 4-1 victory over Georgia in the last 16.

Both Rodri and Yamal starred in that contest in Cologne, with the former netting a crucial equaliser on the stroke of half time before the latter set up Fabian Ruiz to make it 2-1 six minutes after the interval.

Rodri is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in world football and has had plenty of success both at club level with Manchester City and on the international stage with Spain.

Rodri, Yamal standout performers for Spain

The 28-year-old, capped 53 times by Spain, chipped in with nine goals and 14 assists in 50 games for Man City last season, helping the club win a record fourth successive Premier League title.

Yamal, meanwhile, has already made over 60 senior appearances for club and country since bursting onto the scene at the age of just 16, scoring 12 goals, registering 16 assists and breaking a plethora or records in the process.

The Barcelona winger became the youngest-ever player to feature in the knockout rounds of a European Championship when he started against Georgia and he is expected to retain his spot in De la Fuente's XI along with Rodri.

Germany's Joshua Kimmich recently admitted that "Spain have been the most impressive side so far" at this summer's tournament, and teammate Kroos has since talked up the threat that both Rodri and Yamal could pose on Friday.

"[Rodri is] one of Manchester City and Spain's key players," Kroos told reporters. "He always keeps a cool head and never makes mistakes, even under pressure. He gives his team so much and has scored some important goals too in recent times.

Kroos heaps praise on Rodri, Yamal

"The difference between [myself and Rodri] is that he plays as a lone defensive midfielder. I also play in half spaces. I do still think that there a few similarities between us though."

On Yamal, Kroos added: "In recent years players seem to be better now at younger ages, it's really incredible. He was Barcelona's most dangerous player last season.

"We know what he's capable of and will try to keep him and Nico Williams as quiet as possible. To be that good at 16 is simply unbelievable."

Kroos himself has been a standout performer in midfield for Germany at Euro 2024, his final tournament before he retires from football.

The 34-year-old currently leads the way for the most touches (489), most completed passes (416), most line-breaking passes (125) and most passes into the final third (134) at this summer's tournament.

Both Germany and Spain are bidding to win an unprecedented fourth European Championship title, but only one nation can set up a semi-final clash with either Portugal or France.
