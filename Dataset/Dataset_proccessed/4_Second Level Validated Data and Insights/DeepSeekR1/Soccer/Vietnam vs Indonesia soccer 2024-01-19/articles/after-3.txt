HOMENEWSSPORTSLOSING TO INDONESIA, THE VIETNAMESE TEAM WAS ELIMINATED EARLY FROM THE 2023 ASIAN CUP
Losing to Indonesia, the Vietnamese team was eliminated early from the 2023 Asian Cup

The Vietnamese team lost to Indonesia.

The loss to Indonesia made the Vietnamese team the first team from Group D to be eliminated from the 2023 Asian Cup. Coach Philippe Troussier and his team are definitely at the bottom of the group, no matter what the final match result is.

Even in the case of a strong victory against a strong opponent, Iraq, the Vietnamese team could not rise to third place. If that scenario happens, Nguyen Quang Hai and his teammates will only win 3 points, equal to the current score of Indonesia and Japan - the two teams facing each other in the last round.

The Vietnamese team is definitely eliminated after losing to Indonesia.

According to the rules of the Asian Cup, when teams are equal on points, the first sub-index considered is head-to-head performance. The Vietnamese team lost to both Indonesia and Japan, so it is definitely behind these two teams.

This is the first time the Vietnamese team has participated in the Asian Cup without making it past the group stage. Previously, in 2007 and 2019, representatives of Vietnamese football both reached the quarterfinals of the tournament.

The defeat of the Vietnamese team 0-1 against Indonesia in the second match of the group stage of the Asian Cup 2023 was a big disappointment. After nearly 8 years since the first leg of the AFF Cup semi-final 2016, the Vietnamese team was unbeaten against Indonesia in official matches until today's loss (19/1).

The Vietnamese team played poorly in the first half. Goalkeeper Nguyen Filip had to show off his talent to save the home team many times. However, he could not save the danger when the opponent was awarded a penalty. That was a foul situation in the penalty area by Nguyen Thanh Binh.
