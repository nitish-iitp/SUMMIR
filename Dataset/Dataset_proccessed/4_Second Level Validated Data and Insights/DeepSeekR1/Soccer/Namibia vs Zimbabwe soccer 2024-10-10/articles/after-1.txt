In a move that is suspected to be a deliberate attempt to limit Zimbabwean fan support, Namibia has requested that today’s match against the Warriors be played behind closed doors at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg.

It comes after the Brave Warriors cited financial challenges as the reason for the decision.

Namibia claim they are unable to cover the stadium’s logistical costs, including paying security personnel as required by CAF when a team is hosting a match with spectators.

The Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) spokesperson Mike Madoda confirmed the news to journalists.

“Please note that our away match against Namibia on Thursday will be held without spectators. No fans will be allowed for either team,” he said.

This decision could be a strategic ploy by Namibia to hinder the Warriors from receiving overwhelming support from millions of Zimbabweans that are currently residing in South Africa.

A similar tactic was employed by the Warriors rivals, Bafana Bafana in June.

The Hugo Broos coached side opted to host their World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, a city with a smaller Zimbabwean population as compared to Johannesburg.

The Warriors will have the opportunity to play in front of their fans in the return leg against Namibia on Monday.

Last week, ZIFA set the ticket price for the general public at R50.
