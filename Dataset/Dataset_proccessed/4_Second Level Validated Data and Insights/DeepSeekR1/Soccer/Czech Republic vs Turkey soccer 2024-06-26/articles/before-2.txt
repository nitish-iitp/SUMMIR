How Czech Republic could line up against Turkey

If they are to replicate their run to the quarter-finals of the last European Championship, Czech Republic must surely win their final Group F clash at Euro 2024.

Ahead of Wednesday's meeting with Turkey in Hamburg, head coach Ivan Hasek has some big calls to make - particularly throughout the final third.

Having wasted a whole host of chances in their 1-1 draw with Georgia, the Czechs clearly need to sharpen up in attack, but Patrick Schick - who became his nation's all-time top scorer at the Euros on Saturday - may now be missing through injury.

Therefore, Prague-based pair Jan Kuchta and Mojmir Chytil could be called upon to deputise, with Schick's versatile club colleague Adam Hlozek also likely to come under consideration.

Hasek introduced Chytil, Antonin Barak and Ondrej Lingr from the bench at the weekend, but at least two of the three may start at Volksparkstadion.

After securing his place in the squad by finishing second in the Czech First League's goalscoring charts, Viktoria Plzen midfielder Pavel Sulc was a surprise starter against Portugal, so Hasek will also consider his claim.

Elsewhere, the established back three of Tomas Holes, Ladislav Krejci and Robin Hranac is unlikely to change, while captain Tomas Soucek and his West Ham United teammate Vladimir Coufal are certainly assured of their places.

Czech Republic possible starting lineup: Stanek; Holes, Hranac, Krejci; Coufal, Soucek, Provod, Doudera; Barak, Hlozek; Chytil
