        "Czech Republic's head coach Ivan Hasek has some big calls to make, particularly in the final third of the field.Patrick Schick, who became his nation's all-time top scorer at the Euros, may be missing through injury.Jan Kuchta and Mojmir Chytil could be called upon to deputise, with Adam Hlozek also likely to come under consideration.The established back three of Tomas Holes, Ladislav Krejci, and Robin Hranac is unlikely to change.Tomas Soucek and Vladimir Coufal are assured of their places.Czech Republic possible starting lineup: Stanek; Holes, Hranac, Krejci; Coufal, Soucek, Provod, Doudera; Barak, Hlozek; Chytil."
