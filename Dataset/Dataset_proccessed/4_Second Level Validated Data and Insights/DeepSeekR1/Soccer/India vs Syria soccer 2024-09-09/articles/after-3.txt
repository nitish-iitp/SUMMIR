What Manolo Marquez said after the game

“I am angry with the first half...don’t like teams who are scared. The first goal could have been avoided. The scoreline doesn’t paint the real picture, we deserved to score. They killed us in the attack,” he said.

“Today we still had chances, unlike the last game. We were brave in this second half,” the Spaniard added about the positives from this tournament.

MATCH REPORT
Syria lifts maiden Intercontinental Cup, registers biggest win over defending champion India

Syria defeated India 3-0 to lift the 2024 Intercontinental Cup title at Hyderabad’s GMC Balayogi Stadium on Monday.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:29
FULL-TIME
FULL TIME; IND 0-3 SYR - Syria wins the Intercontinental Cup!

That’s that! Syria eases past India to lift the Intercontinental Cup as Manolo Marquez and Co. fail to get score in these two matches in the tournament.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:25
GOAL
90+6’- IND 0-3 SYR; Another one for Syria!

That’s the final nail on the coffin as Syria’s Pablo taps in the ball inside the net.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:23
90+4’- IND 0-1 SYR; Liston thought he had scored there!

That was a long ranger from Liston Colaco but he could only rattle the crossbar there. 

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:21
Five minutes added

It looks like Manolo Marquez will begin its India career with a draw and a loss in this tournament. Few more minutes left to confirm that.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:17
87’- IND 0-2 SYR; Edmund’s shot saved!

That was a brilliant shot from Edmund as Syria’s goalkeeper gets the slightest of touches to keep the clean sheet intact. After the corner, Mahesh’s shot is saved the goalie too.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:12
82’- IND 0-2 SYR; That could have been Syria’s third!

A looping header from a Syrian shirt would have sneaked into the goal if it wasn’t for the crossbar.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:07
GOAL
76’- IND 0-2 SYR; Syria doubles its lead!

Daleho doubles Syria’s lead as he enters the box from the right and passes it right under Gurpreet, who fails to stop the weak shot.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 21:01
68’- IND 0-1 SYR; Another chance goes begging

Nandhakumar tries his luck first time but his shot is right at the ground. Chhangte is there at the far post as the player tries to get a foot to the ball, but fails.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:53
64’- IND 0-1 SYR; Another change for India

Naorem Mahesh Singh comes on in place for Sahal Abdul Samad.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:53
63’- IND 0-1 SYR; Syria player stretchered off

Alaswad, the goalscorer, is stretchered off after picking up a knock.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:45
55’- IND 0-1 SYR; Chhangte testing the waters

Sahal turns on the afterburners as he lays the ball to Chhangte. The winger then takes a shot right at the goalie, who paws it away.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:42
52’- IND 0-1 SYR; Good start from India

The Blue Tigers have already matched Syria for the number of corners as India begins the second half with intent.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:36
Second half underway

India looking to score first as the second half is underway at the GMC Balayogi Stadium in Hyderabad.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:35
Changes for India

Asish Rai, Apuia come on.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:18
HALFTIME
HALFTIME; IND 0-1 SYR

That was the last chance of the first half as Chhangte’s freekick fails to find any takers inside the box. India trails at halftime, and as it stands, Syria is winning the Cup.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:17
45+1’- IND 0-1 SYR; India with a barrage of attacks

That was a power-packed few seconds there. Sahal, Manvir, and others try their luck at goal, but the Syrian backline stands strong. A freekick now.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:15
43’- IND 0-1 SYR; Bheke clears the lines for a corner

It’s just the second corner of the match, and both were conceded by India. The ball is cleared as Nandhakumar tries to go forward, but he is dispossessed.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:09
38’- IND 0-1 SYR; Nandhakumar lets fly a sighter, but offside

That was a powerful shot from the winger, but the header just before that was flagged offside by the lines referee.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:07
36’- IND 0-1 SYR; Gurpreet makes a crucial save!

Alaa Aladin gets a foot in to the ball that is floated into the box from the corner flag. It would have crept in if not for Gurpreet’s fingertip save.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:04
YELLOW CARD
32’- IND 0-1 SYR; Card shown

Syria’s Daleho is shown the yellow card after a tackle of Anwar Ali. The resulting freekick is floated in from Sahal Samad, but is cleared.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 20:03
31’- IND 0-1 SYR; India putting in more crosses

The telecast and live streams seem to have given up momentarily. On the pitch, India is putting in more crosses inside the box, a hopeful sign for Manolo’s men.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:59
28’- IND 0-1 SYR; Chhangte heads it, but wide

Nandhakumar carries the ball for a bit, passes it to Subasish Bose who comes in darting from his left-back spot. The defender then puts in a looping cross as Chhangte jumps and tries to head it towards goal, but the attempt goes above the crossbar.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:57
26’- IND 0-1 SYR; First cross recorded for India

That was the first cross from India in this match, if the statistics shown by the broadcaster are to be believed. Nandhakumar floats in a ball inside the box, with two blue shirts present there, but the Syrian goalie leaps and comfortably collects it.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:56
24’- IND 0-1 SYR; India failing to cross the halfway line

The football, for the past few minutes, has been played inside India’s half. The fans clad in blue raise their decibel level as soon as a blue shirt starts to carry the ball, but then the crown goes mum as soon as the player is intercepted.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:53
20’- IND 0-1 SYR; Easy-peasy football from Syria

Bad finish for Syria’s standards there. There was a glaring gap in India’s defence and the visiting side saw that. A weighted ball was played towards Alaa Aldin, who beats the offside trap to collect the ball in his stride, but shoots it wide.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:47
16’- IND 0-1 SYR; India seems to be just a spectator

More often than not, with more of the ball possession, a Syrian shirt is darting towards the Indian box and trying its luck at goal. The Indian players are forced to be mere spectators.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:43
12’- IND 0-1 SYR; Syria almost almost doubled the lead!

There seems to be a lack in communication amongst those occupying India’s backline. The ball is not cleared as a Syrian shirt gets a free shot at Gurpreet’s goal, but the goalie makes himself big and saves it.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:40
GOAL
7’- IND 0-1 SYR; The Eagles of Qasioun take the lead!

Mahmoud Alaswad gives Syria the lead! He cuts in into the box and tries to cross it, but finds a crowd of blue shirts stopping his attempt. However, the ball finds its way back to him as he lets fly a toe-poke shot from the outside of his boot that beat Gurpreet at the first post.

SEPTEMBER 09, 2024 19:31
