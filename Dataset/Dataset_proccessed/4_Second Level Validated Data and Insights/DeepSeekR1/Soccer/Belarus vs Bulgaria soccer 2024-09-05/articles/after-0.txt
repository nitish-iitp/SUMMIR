Belarus take on Bulgaria at ZTE Arena, where an exciting match should be on the cards this coming Thursday. It is one of the matches in round one of the group phase of the UEFA Nations League this season. Belarus face off against Bulgaria for the first time in a while, with Belarus claiming a 1-0 win at undefined back then.

Belarus arrive at this match placed as number 99 in the FIFA world ranking, while Bulgaria lack behind as number 82 in the world.

It has the look of a very equal affair, when Belarus welcome Bulgaria at ZTE Arena this coming Thursday. Three points here could prove pivotal in the attempts to win the group, and both sides are capable of booking a win, when they hit their stride.

Belarus are relatively average in the art of goal-scoring these days. They scored a steady 11 goals in their previous ten matches, for an average of 1.1 per game. They simultaneously allowed their opponents 12 goals, or an average of 1.2 a game. Furthermore, they fought their way to three clean sheets in this run.

Could Bulgaria be in for a tougher match than they wish for, when opening their UEFA Nations League campaign by travelling to face Belarus? Both sides will be raring to go at ZTE Arena, and it could be a potential banana skin for the favourites.

Bulgaria managed a bearable 14 goals from their past ten games, creating an average of 1.4 goals per game. They conceded 12 goals in total, and while claiming two clean sheets, they conceded 1.2 goals an average per game.

Belarus vs Bulgaria Prediction
Belarus Form

A draw was the best Belarus could muster in their previous three games. They claimed a 0-0 draw against Malta, before getting trounced 0-4 against Russia. Last time out, more disappointment followed as Israel ran out 0-4 winners. Belarus claimed a modest two wins in their past six internationals. They also drew one and lost three, scored two goals and conceded ten.

Bulgaria Form

Following three draws in their last three matches, Bulgaria could do with a win again. Against Azerbaijan, they finished even 1-1, before drawing again in a 0-0 match with Romania. Another 1-1 stalemate against Slovenia followed. Bulgaria managed to win just once in their past six internationals. They also drew five and lost zero, while scoring six time and letting in seven.

Belarus and Bulgaria are both very focused on not losing currently, and they'd rather nick a point than risk losing all three. The draw is the tasty value bet at ZTE Arena on Thursday.

Bulgaria didn't lose any of their previous 6 outings.

Belarus vs Bulgaria Betting Tips

Dmitri Antilevski has found the back of the net one times in his previous six games for Belarus; who will surely not mind him striking again on Thursday. Punters will also be looking for Kiril Despodov to keep up his current streak for Bulgaria, having scored four in his last six games for his national team.

Belarus claimed a modest two wins from their previous 10 home matches across all tournaments. They split the points with the visiting team in three of the games, whilst losing five. Bulgaria won one of their last 10 games away, drew six and lost three of the games in this run. Should Belarus pull off a home win this coming Thursday, it could be an entertaining affair, since they only won one games to nil in their last 10 attempts.

Both teams to score was a winning bet four times in this run of matches. Belarus saw over 2.5 goals in three of their last ten matches across all tournaments, as they scored an average of 0.5 goals during this run. Over 2.5 goals came up in three of Bulgaria's previous ten matches across all tournaments. They managed to score an average of 0.8 goals in these matches.

Tips
Draw
Both Belarus and Bulgaria seem a little too focused on not losing than actually chasing a win, and as such, the draw is a tasty value bet from our perspective.
