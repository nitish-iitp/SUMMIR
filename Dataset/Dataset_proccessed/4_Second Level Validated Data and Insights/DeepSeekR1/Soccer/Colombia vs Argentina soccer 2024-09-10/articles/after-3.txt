RIO DE JANEIRO - Colombia and Bolivia registered surprise victories while Brazil's faltering campaign hit another hurdle in South America's World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday.

In Barranquilla, James Rodriguez scored one goal and set up another as Colombia overcame reigning World Cup and Copa America champions Argentina 2-1.

Yerson Mosquera put the hosts ahead at Estadio Metropolitano with a close-range header after Rodriguez's inch-perfect cross from the left wing.

Nico Gonzalez equalized when he intercepted an errant Rodriguez pass before dashing into the box and beating goalkeeper Camilo Vargas.

Rodriguez made amends for his earlier error by converting from the penalty spot after Daniel Munoz was brought down by Nicolas Otamendi.

"It was a great win against a team that has won everything," Rodriguez said after the match. "The conditions were tough. It was very hot but we coped well and I think it was a fair result."

The Rayo Vallecano playmaker has now scored or assisted 10 times in his past eight international appearances.

The result lifted Colombia to second in the 10-team South American zone standings with 16 points from eight qualifiers, two points behind leaders Argentina.

In Santiago, Carmelo Algaranaz and Miguel Terceros scored first half goals as Bolivia secured a 2-1 away victory over Chile.

The visitors opened the scoring at Estadio Nacional through Algaranaz, who finished coolly after Roberto Fernandez's pass on the counterattack.

The hosts dominated possession but struggled to find a way past Bolivia's low defensive line. That changed in the 39th minute when former Napoli and Valencia forward Eduardo Vargas capitalized on a slip from goalkeeper Carlos Lampe to slot the ball into an empty net.

But Bolivia quickly regained the lead through Terceros, who struck from close ranging after Roberto Fernandez's pass.

The visitors held on to secure their second consecutive victory and climb to eighth in the South American group with nine points from eight qualifiers, just a point behind fifth-placed Brazil.

Bolivia's victory was soured, however, by an Achilles tendon injury to Lampe, who was forced off the pitch just before halftime.

"We hoped to be able to get a point and knew that a victory would be difficult," Bolivia manager Oscar Villegas told a news conference.

"We're very happy with the outcome of the match but at the same time we're sad for Carlos (Lampe). He will need surgery and will likely need a long recovery period."

The result marked Chile's third consecutive qualifying defeat as they slumped to ninth in the group with just five points so far.

In Asuncion, a stunning first-half strike from Diego Gomez gave Paraguay a 1-0 home victory over Brazil.

Inter Miami midfielder Gomez gave his side the lead from the edge of the 18-yard box by using the outside of his right foot to curl a 20-yard shot into the net off the far post.

Brazil controlled almost three quarters of the total possession and completed more than twice as many passes as the hosts.

But the visitors lacked incisiveness in the final third, despite the presence of Real Madrid attacking trio Vinicius Junior, Endrick and Rodrygo.
