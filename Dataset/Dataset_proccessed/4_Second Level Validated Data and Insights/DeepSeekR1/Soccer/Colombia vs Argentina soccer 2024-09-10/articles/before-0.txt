Colombia welcome pace-setters Argentina to Barranquilla in South American World Cup qualifying on Tuesday night.

The hosts remain unbeaten after snatching a late equaliser in Peru last week, while Argentina will already be thinking about booking their flights to North America after a phenomenal start.

In a repeat of July's Copa America final, Colombia and Argentina meet safe in the knowledge that they are both resounding favourites to reach the World Cup finals in 2026 as we approach the halfway point in qualifying.

It should still provide an intense battle, like the Copa final in the United States did over the summer, when Lautaro Martinez's goal in the 112th minute handed Argentina a second straight title.

That was Colombia's first final in 23 years, as Nestor Lorenzo has transformed the side since arriving in the summer of 2022.

The defeat in the Copa final was Lorenzo's first in charge, after 26 games at the helm, and the first for Los Cafeteros since losing again to Argentina in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup.

Colombia avoided defeat once again in their first match post-Copa, as Luis Diaz's late goal salvaged a point away in Peru on Friday night.

Despite being favourites to win considering Peru had taken just two points from their first six matches, any result on the road in CONMEBOL qualifying is a positive.

That took Colombia to 13 points, and they now sit third, a comfortable seven points clear in the automatic qualifying spots.

Argentina played earlier than most on matchday seven, and took advantage to extend their lead at the top by beating Chile 3-0 on home soil.

Alexis Mac Allister, Julian Alvarez and Paulo Dybala scored the goals as the Albiceleste made light work of a Chile side struggling near the bottom of the standings.

It leaves Lionel Scaloni's men on 18 points from a possible 21, and already 12 points clear in the automatic places, as they look set to qualify for a 14th consecutive World Cup.

Not since 1970 have Argentina failed to reach the finals, and the format was much more unforgiving back then, as the more modern 18-game format has suited them.

Wins away from home are rare in CONMEBOL, but Argentina have an excellent record on the road, as they are unbeaten in 13 away qualifiers dating back to a defeat in the altitude of Bolivia seven years ago.

With Brazil not at their best currently, and both Uruguay and Colombia dropping points last time out, Scaloni's men are now fully expected to qualify in first place, and keeping that unbeaten run going here against a strong Colombia side will strengthen their position even further.

Colombia are without two of their most experienced players for this squad, as veteran goalkeeper David Ospina and Davinson Sanchez are both sidelined with injury.

Jhon Cordoba surprisingly started ahead of in-form Aston Villa man Jhon Duran in Lima, but the latter could come in to replace the Krasnodar striker here after doing so from the bench in that encounter.

James Rodriguez only started on the bench against Peru having not played any minutes since the Copa final, but the new Rayo Vallecano signing should start here and captain the side here after getting 45 minutes under his belt.

Liverpool's Diaz is the man to watch following his excellent start to the campaign, scoring the equaliser on Friday after entering the break with three goals and an assist in his first three Premier League games of the season.

Argentina are without Lionel Messi as he continues to recover from the ankle injury that forced him in off in the Copa final back in July against their upcoming opponents.

Defensive duo Nicolas Tagliafico and Leonardo Balerdi have joined Bayer Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios on the sidelines with injury, while Fiorentina's Lucas Martinez Quarta has been dropped.

Angel Di Maria retired after the summer's success, opening up a place in the squad for Matias Soule, who could be given his debut here after an impressive 12 months in Serie A.

Taty Castellanos has also received his first call up, and the striker was handed his first cap, coming as a late substitute in the win over Chile.

Colombia possible starting lineup:
Vargas; Munoz, Lucumi, Mina, Mojica; Rios, Lerma, Arias; James, Duran, Diaz

Argentina possible starting lineup:
E. Martinez; Molina, Otamendi, Romero, Li. Martinez; De Paul, Mac Allister, Fernandez, Lo Celso; Alvarez, La. Martinez



We say: Colombia 1-1 Argentina

It is usually close between these two nations, with extra time needed in the recent Copa final, and penalties in the 2021 edition, while they drew 2-2 in their last meeting on Colombian soil.

Colombia have only won one of the last 13 meetings, though, with many ending in stalemates, and Argentina's strong away form suggests another draw could be on the cards.
