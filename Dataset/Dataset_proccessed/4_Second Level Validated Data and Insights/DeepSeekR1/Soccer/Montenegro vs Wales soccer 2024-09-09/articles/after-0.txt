Wales have beaten Montenegro 2-1 in their Nations League match in Niksic.

The visitors got off to the perfect start when Kieffer Moore pounced on the ball in the box and lashed home off the post with only 38 seconds on the clock. And just two minutes later, Harry Wilson thumped a long-range strike into the net to give Wales a two-goal lead.

Montenegro came back into the game, with captain Stefan Jovetic hitting the bar from the halfway line and missing a sitter which was well saved by Welsh keeper Karl Darlow, among an array of chances. Driton Camaj eventually pulled one back in the second half, but it was too little, too late.

The game played out in driving rain as a soaked manager, Craig Bellamy, watched his new-look side continue their more aggressive, front-foot approach. And it paid off as they added to an initial draw with Turkey in Cardiff last week with three valuable points here.

Flying start earns Wales impressive first win under Craig Bellamy in Montenegro

Wales claimed their first win under Craig Bellamy with a 2-1 Nations League success over Montenegro on a rain-lashed night in Niksic.

Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson gave Wales a dream start with a quickfire double inside three minutes.

Moore’s opener was timed at 37 seconds – Wales’ fastest goal since 2003 – and ended their longest scoreless streak of four games since September 2012.

88 min: Ramsey knocks in a terrible corner which bounces a couple of times before being cleared away by the first man. But from a Welsh point of the view, the ball is largely staying at the right end of the pitch right now.

Finally, Montengero score. Nikola Krstovic chases down a pretty rudimentary ball over the top and squares for Driton Camaj to knock home from close range.
