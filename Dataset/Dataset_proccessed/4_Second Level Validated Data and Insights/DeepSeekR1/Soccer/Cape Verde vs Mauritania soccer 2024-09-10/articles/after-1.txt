Egypt v Cape Verde - Africa Cup of Nations 2025 Qualifiers

Cape Verde will play host to Mauritania at Estádio Nacional de Cabo Verde in Africa Cup of Nations qualifying on Tuesday. The hosts will strive to exploit home advantage to make up for their previous setback.

Cape Verde vs Mauritania Preview

Cape Verde were brought to their knees in Group C's opening match against Egypt, who claimed a 3-0 win at the Cairo International Stadium. The hosts are now seated bottom of the group with zero points ahead of matchday two. Cape Verde are quite conscious of the fact that home advantage is crucial in these qualifiers.

Tubarões Azuis participated in the previous two editions of the Africa Cup of Nations, reaching the quarterfinals in Cote d’Ivoire earlier this year. They are determined to qualify once again but must put their campaign back on track following their loss to Egypt. Cape Verde defeated Mauritania 1-0 when the sides last met.

Mauritania were stretched by Botswana in their opener in Group C but managed to snatch a lone-goal win late in the game. That hard-fought victory leaves them second in the group with three points. However, the visitors may have to change their tactics in the upcoming meeting, considering the fact that Cape Verde are stronger than Botswana.

Al-Murabitun have been consistent on the continental scene in the last few years, as they have qualified and participated in the last three Afcon editions. In the 2023 Afcon in Cote D’Ivoire, Mauritania reached the round of 16, their best record so far in the competition. They have won two times in their last 13 matches in all competitions.
