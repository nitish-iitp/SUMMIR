FOOTBALL
Chile vs. Brazil: Head-to-head record and past meetings

One of the most-played fixtures in South American international football, Brazil and Chile are more than well-accustomed to each other, with both having 100 years of footballing history behind them.

Chile may not match the level of prestige Brazil have on the global stage with the Selecao having won five World Cups, but La Roja have enjoyed recent continental success with back-to-back Copa America wins in 2015 and 2016.

Brazil blow Chile out of the water in that regard too though, having won the Copa on nine occasions, and their record in head-to-head meetings is also very favourable.

Here, Sports Mole takes an in-depth look at the head-to-head record and previous meetings between these two founding fathers of the Copa America.

Head-to-head record

Previous meetings: 76
Chile wins: 8
Draws: 13
Brazil wins: 55

The lengthy history of both nations means the two have met in some huge fixtures over the past 100 years, with four encounters at the World Cup finals.

Undoubtedly the most notable was the semi-final in 1962, which was hosted by Chile, but ultimately ended in heartbreak for the home side, as Garrincha and Vava both netted twice in a 4-2 Brazil victory.

The Selecao would go on to retain their World Cup crown in the final against Czechoslovakia, but Chile did at least claim third place by beating Yugoslavia.

In more recent times, the last 16 stage has been a common battleground for the two nations to face off in at the World Cup, doing so three times in the past three decades.

On their way to the final in 1998, Brazil beat Chile 4-1, with Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio both scoring twice, and the legendary Marcelo Salas netting a consolation for La Roja.

It was another dominant Brazilian performance when the two met in South Africa in 2010 too, as goals from Juan, Luis Fabiano and Robinho sent Chile packing thanks to a 3-0 victory.

On home soil in Belo Horizonte four years later, though, Brazil needed penalties to see off a Chile side that had become a favourite among the neutrals, but Gonzalo Jara's decisive penalty struck the inside of the post and bounced out as the home faithful celebrated a narrow success.

The inaugural Copa America in 1916 saw both Chile and Brazil compete back when it was just a four-team round robin competition, but neither side threatened the top two of Uruguay and Argentina, making their 1-1 draw inconsequential.

Brazil would then show their dominance over Chile, winning 5-0 and 6-0 in the 1917 and 1919 editions, respectively, reigning victorious over the continent in the latter.

It took Chile 17 attempts to finally beat the Selecao, and they picked the big stage to do it in, as a 4-1 victory in the 1956 Copa America helped them to second place behind Uruguay.

However, another 31 years passed before Chile could claim another competitive win over Brazil, but that once again came at the Copa with another impressive scoreline, as La Roja won 4-0, with Ivo Basay and Juan Letelier both scoring twice to knock out their opponents in the group stage.

Brazil's dominance over Chile has continued into the present day though, as a 2015 loss in World Cup qualifying is the only time they have suffered defeat in the last 20 encounters.

Seventeen wins have come in that spell too, including home and away successes during 2022 World Cup qualifying, both without conceding, and another Selecao success in their most recent meeting in October 2024.
