        "Croatia have got out of tougher situations. Their slogan – 'Best when it's hardest' – is wholly apt. It didn't quite gel in the first two matches, but on both occasions things looked better in the second half. Dalić will surely make several changes, possibly leaving out Marcelo Brozović, moving Luka Modrić and Mateo Kovačić back and playing the talented Luka Sučić in front of them. Dalić must find a way; when the going gets tough, he usually does.",

        "After the positive start against Albania, the reigning champions were brought back down to earth by Spain. Spalletti is expected to make some changes to his starting XI, but most of all he will have to work on his players' heads as the Azzurri too often appeared frustrated against La Roja. Facing Croatia with the fear of elimination could be a huge mistake. Italy can certainly play better than they did in Gelsenkirchen.",
        "Zlatko Dalić, Croatia coach: 'We haven't started the tournament well. We have not been at our true level. We are conceding goals too easily. In Qatar [at the 2022 World Cup], we conceded one goal in the group stage, and now we've conceded five in two matches. We don't have Ivan Perišić in the top form he was in in Qatar. Some players are two years older, and we are playing against strong opponents. But I think the main issue is that we have been conceding goals too easily.'",
        "Luciano Spalletti, Italy coach: 'Croatia are not only a great team, but they are also very experienced. We'll have to be switched on to gauge when to speed up the tempo of the game, and when to calm down and control possession. I made a mistake in not making some changes between the first and second games. So this time, I think I need to make some.'"
