England will be more efficient after 'running out of energy' against Serbia, says Southgate

Slovakia delivered the first major shock result of Euro 2024, snatching an early goal and defending furiously to hold on for a 1-0 victory over Belgium in Group E.

Ivan Schranz took advantage of a horror defensive error to put Slovakia ahead in the seventh minute and kept Belgium at bay with increasing desperation to secure an unexpected triumph at the Frankfurt Arena.

Belgium’s top scorer Romelu Lukaku twice had the ball in the net but was denied after VAR checks, first for offside in the 56th minute and minutes from the end when Lois Openda was adjudged to have handled in the build-up before the striker swept the ball into the net.

Slovakia joined Romania at the top of the group standings after their 3-0 win over Ukraine on Monday. Follow all the latest reaction below before the evening match between Austria and France:

Belgium’s Jeremy Doku showcases versatility - but his error has wider Euro 2024 implications

On the face of it, the group should have been a straightforward Euro 2024group for Belgium, ranked third in the world with no other side higher than 20.

However they were stunned inside the first six minutes when Ivan Schranz put Slovakia ahead, and despite two Romelu Lukaku strikes going into the back of the net, both were ruled out for offside.

Belgium’s problems at tournaments resurfaced, after 63 minutes and still trailing 1-0, the team found themselves without a goal in over four and a half hours of football at the major events, and they were left contemplating a surprise defeat in their opening match.

FT: Belgium 0-1 Slovakia

There’ll be plenty of focus on the VAR decision to chalk off Belgium’s second goal. It’s undoubtedly the most contentious decision of the tournament so far.

You’ll likely feel different about it depending on whether you want to favour the attacker or defender, but there’s no doubt that the ball hitting Openda’s hand gave him an advantage in controlling it and beating his man.

Expect to see plenty of reaction in the coming hours and days!

FULL-TIME! Belgium 0-1 Slovakia

That game had everything! A shock, controversial decisions, disallowed goals and some great play at times from both sides.

There’ll be mixed opinions on the Openda handball, but it’s clearly a handball. His hand was probably in a natural position, but the handball gave him a clear advantage.

Belgium lose their opening game in a group they will feel like they should have got nine points from. Slovakia give themselves a brilliant chance at making the last 16, and perhaps even qualifying top of Group E!
