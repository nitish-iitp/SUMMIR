Angola's goalkeeper Neblu faced an early exit, being sent off after only 17 minutes into their Africa Cup of Nations encounter against Namibia. Neblu's emotional dismay was palpable as he received a red card for handling the ball outside his penalty area.

In response to Neblu's expulsion, Angola made a tactical adjustment by substituting midfielder Estrela and introducing goalkeeper Antonio Signori into the match. The strategic move aimed to maintain defensive stability despite the unexpected setback.

The game witnessed another twist just before halftime when Namibia, too, found themselves reduced to ten players. Lubeni Haukongo received a red card for a second bookable offense, leveling the playing field in the round of 16 clash.

Despite the numerical disadvantage, Angola managed to establish a 2-0 lead, with Gelson Dala scoring two goals in a remarkable four-minute span just before halftime. The goals showcased Angola's resilience and adaptability in the face of challenging circumstances, ultimately shaping the course of the match.
