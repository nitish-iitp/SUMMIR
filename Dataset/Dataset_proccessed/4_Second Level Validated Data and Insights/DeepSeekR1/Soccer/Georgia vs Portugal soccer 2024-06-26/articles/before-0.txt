Georgia vs Portugal Odds, Picks & Predictions: Portuguese Backups Roll on Day 13 of Euro 2024

With Group F locked up, we won't likely see Portugal's top lineup in Wednesday's finale against Georgia. Either way, our Euro 2024 betting picks expect them to cruise.

With top spot already secured, Portugal can shuffle the pack for this group stage finale – but the rest of Group F is wide open, giving Georgia a chance of sneaking through on Wednesday. The Portuguese belong in the inner circle of tournament contenders after taking maximum points so far, and Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes were on target in their 3-0 win over Turkey at the weekend.

Meanwhile, Georgia enter as big underdogs here in the latest Euro 2024 odds, even after picking up their first-ever European Championships point in a 1-1 draw with Czechia last time out, though it’s highly likely they’ll be facing a second-string Portuguese lineup in Gelsenkirchen.

My Georgia vs. Portugal predictions and Euro 2024 picks take a closer look at this June 26 matchup.

Georgia vs Portugal picks, predictions, and betting tips

My best bet:
Portugal first-half moneyline (-115 at Betano)

My analysis
It’s a real luxury for Portugal to be able to ease the burden on their star players, with a ticket to the knockout rounds already in the bag and nothing left to play for in Group F. Given the veterans in the Portuguese camp, Roberto Martinez has already hinted at some squad rotation for Wednesday’s contest.

For a start, Rafael Leao is suspended after bookings in both outings so far, while Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, and Vitinha are among those players who could be rested. In truth, the injury risk is such that it would be no surprise if Martinez swaps out eight or more of his first-choice team.

However, I’m not expecting a major drop-off in performance. There’s so much depth on this roster, with Goncalo Ramos, Diogo Jota, and Joao Felix all waiting in the wings as well as talented 19-year-old midfielder Joao Neves.

Those fringe players will have a chance to make their case for a bigger role in the knockout rounds and that should translate to a committed, adventurous start. Portugal should have the lion’s share of possession and I like these odds for Martinez’s men to take a lead into the half-time break.

Georgia have been a fun story at Euro 2024 and they’ve got threats on the counter-attack. If they had converted a glorious late chance against the Czechs, Wednesday’s contest would be a Group F decider, but the flipside is that Czechia outshot the Georgians 27-5 on Saturday.

Portugal have the quality and patience to control the tempo, and I see their forwards being more clinical here when the scoring chances arrive.

Cristiano Ronaldo odds, prop for today

My best bet
Anytime assist (+265 at Betano)

My analysis
While it would be a surprise to see Ronaldo in the starting lineup, his desire to play and add to his European Championships goal tally shouldn’t be underestimated.

If CR7 features on Wednesday, either from the start or off the bench, his anytime assist prop jumps out as the best value. His unselfish pass set up a Fernandes goal against Turkey and a substitute cameo could allow him to create something similar against a tiring Georgian defense.

Diogo Jota anytime goalscorer

Both teams to score — Yes

+590 at Betano

If Ronaldo can be persuaded to take a breather here, there are some big shoes to fill in the Portugal front three — and Jota should be at the top of the list of replacements. He had a goal disallowed in the opener against Czechia and he’s got some substitute minutes under his belt. With his crafty movement likely to stretch the Georgia defense, I’m picking him to make a contribution. 

Though they’re big underdogs, the Georgians have shown enough quality to suggest they’ll have chances. Plus, there’s every reason to push players forward as the game progresses, with the probability that only a victory would put them into the last 16.

With Khvicha Kvaratskhelia at the forefront, I see Willy Sagnol’s men finding the net against a rejigged Portugal defense, and that makes the both teams to score prop worth a long look.
