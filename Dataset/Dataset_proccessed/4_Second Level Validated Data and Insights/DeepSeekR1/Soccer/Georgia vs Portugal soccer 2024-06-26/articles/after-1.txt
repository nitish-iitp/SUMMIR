Mikautadze leads the Golden Boot race

Getty Images

Those three goals also make Mikautadze the only player at Euro 2024 to score three times in the group stage. And there are only six players that have scored more than once.

So he has gone out on his own in the race for the Golden Boot.

Three goals – Georges Mikautadze
Two goals – Cody Gakpo, Ivan Schranz, Jamal Musiala, Niclas Fullkrug, Razvan Marin

No such problems for Mikautadze, though

There won't be many players that can put a greater major tournament group stage on the table than Georges Mikautadze.

His converted penalty this evening was his third goal at Euro 2024 and means he scored in all of his side's group-stage games.

He joins an exclusive list of eight players to have done that previously:

Michel Platini – 1984
Alan Shearer and Hristo Stoichkov – 1996
Savo Milosevic – 2000
Milan Baros and Ruud van Nistelrooy – 2004
Gareth Bale – 2016
Cristiano Ronaldo – 2020

A first ever group-stage blank for Ronaldo

Getty Images

A successful group stage for Portugal, all things considered. But it is one that has concluded without a Cristiano Ronaldo goal.

It is the first time in his career — spanning 11 tournaments — that he has failed to score a group-stage goal at a major tournament.

It's what you do with the ball that matters!

Getty Images

You need possession to score a goal and win a game.

But you don't much of it, as Georgia showed this evening.

They had just 28 per cent possession against Portugal, the lowest by a winning team at the European Championship on record (since 1980).

And they will be happy to do it all over again against possession-hungry Spain in the last 16.

Player of the Match: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia

Getty Images

A few candidates for the Player of the Match award in this game. Unsurprisingly though, it is Khvicha Kvaratskhelia who is deservedly given UEFA's Player of the Match award.

It was his goal after just 93 seconds that set Georgia on the path to their famous victory and, from there, the Portugal players could not get near him for the rest of the game.

What a performance when his country needed it most!

Portugal face Slovenia in the last 16

Getty Images

All the hard work was done after two games for Portugal as their six points were enough to confirm top spot in Group F before a ball was kicked this evening.

Slovenia will be their opponents in the last 16 and, when they are back at full strength, Portugal will be very confident of making it into the quarter-final.

Their potential route to the final looks very, very tough though as they will face the winner of France vs Belgium in the last eight if they beat Slovenia.

Georgia rewarded with Spain tie

Getty Images

Out of the frying pan and into the fire for Georgia. And they will be licking their lips!

Many Euro 2024 viewers consider Spain the strongest team we have seen so far, and I'm inclined to agree. They were the only team to take nine points from the group stage and they will go into that last-16 tie as massive favourites to advance.

But, as we learned tonight, Georgia cannot be written off at any cost.

A word for the Euro 2024 underdogs

Great scenes in Gelsenkirchen and a fitting ending to this group stage — the underdogs have, by and large, been competitive and made for some fantastic matches.

Group F final table

UEFA

So, for the last time at Euro 2024, let's look at the group.

Portugal had already sewn up top spot in Group F and a late winner for Turkey against 10-man Czech Republic has sent them through to the last 16 as runners up.

And, with four points, Georgia have secured their knockout place as the second best of the third-placed teams.

The performance of performances

Georgia haven't just beaten Portugal with two flukey goals on the counter attacks, they have fully deserved their 2-0 win.

It all started right at the back with Mamardashvili who was, once again, superb and his defence in front of him were immaculate throughout the 90 minutes.

The midfield outgunned a far superior — and far more expensive — Portugal midfield and the two frontmen spoke for themselves.

A goal apiece for Kvaratskhelia and Mikautadze, the latter who is now the standalone front runner for the Golden Boot.

Jota close to halving the deficit

90+3' Georgia 2-0 Portugal

Where has this Portugal team been all night?

Their two best chances of the match have been created in stoppage time as Conceicao's low shot-cum-cross somehow evaded Jota's intricate attempt to divert it into the bottom corner and then beat Ramos at the far post.

It has not been their night.

It has, however, been the night of all nights for Georgia!

Mamardashvili saves from Semedo!

90+2' Georgia 2-0 Portugal

Mamardashvili makes a key save, of course he does!

The first bit of quality in a while from a Portugal perspective saw Felix curl a dangerous cross towards Semedo at the far post. The Wolves full-back tried to direct it into the bottom corner with his instep, but there was Mamardashvili with a big right paw to keep it out.

Fortunately for him, one of his defenders was stationed a yard in front to fully clear the danger.

Georgia doing all of the running

88' Georgia 2-0 Portugal

I don't want to jinx this for any Georgians following this coverage, but Portugal seem resigned to this 2-0 defeat.

They are getting bullied all over the pitch by the Georgia players and, all of a sudden, it is them who look more like scoring the third goal. Although, they need to make sure they don't get carried away and commit too many players forward because there are still some excellent players in this Portugal side.

I'm not sure any of them have looked excellent this evening, mind.

Kvaratskhelia having a stand-out tournament

Getty Images

85' Georgia 2-0 Portugal

Following his substitution, it feels worth pointing out just how good Kvaratskhelia has been to watch at Euro 2024 so far.

In a world of patient passing, overly structured patterns of play and often boring football, he is a breath of fresh air. He takes players on, he scores goals and he works incredibly hard for his team.

He, along with his team-mates, is fully deserving of a place in the last 16.

Kvaratskhelia withdrawn in Georgia double change

82' Georgia 2-0 Portugal

Another brilliant performance from Kvaratskhelia and Georgia will be hoping they need him fresh for the knockouts, so he has been withdrawn.

Zuriko Davitashvili is on in his place.

Georgia's other change has seen Chakvetadze make way for Anzor Mekvabishvili.
