Round 2 of the UEFA Nations League 2024 will see the Czech Republic against Ukraine on September 10, 2024, at 18:45 at the Fortuna Arena in Prague. Both teams want to bounce back from losses in their respective opening games, thus this Group B1 conflict comes at a critical junctur. Scottish referee John Beaton will cover the game. Following unsatisfactory results in their first Nations League games, both teams hope to reverse the tide. The pressure is on both sides to get important points as the Czechs try to recover from a tough 4-1 loss to Georgia and Ukraine lost 2-1 to Albania.

After an unexpected loss in their opening, Ukraine is trying to ascend League B; the Czech Republic, who was demoted from League A, is finding it difficult to get back going. Both sides will depend much on this game to avoid being caught in the lower run of the competition. To guarantee success in what looks to be a fierce confrontation, both managers Sergiy Rebrov for Ukraine and Ivan Hašek for the Czech Republic will have to make important strategic decisions.

BETTING TIPS AND MATCH INSIGHTS

When analyzing the Czech Republic vs Ukraine prediction today, both teams enter this match with much to prove. The Czech Republic’s defensive vulnerabilities were exposed in their heavy loss to Georgia, while Ukraine failed to hold onto an early lead against Albania. Historically, Ukraine has had the upper hand, winning both meetings in the inaugural Nations League campaign. On home ground, where they have been able to produce results under Hašek, the Czech team might find some solace though. Ukraine’s track record in head-to–head games and their capacity to perform away from home help to position them as modest favourites, although the game looks to be a close struggle.

Czech Republic Results

The Czech Republic has been inconsistent in recent matches, struggling both in international tournaments and the Nations League. Below is a breakdown of their last five games:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
07.09.2024	UNL	Georgia vs Czech Republic	4-1	L
26.06.2024	European Championship	Czech Republic vs Turkey	1-2	L
22.06.2024	European Championship	Georgia vs Czech Republic	1-1	D
18.06.2024	European Championship	Portugal vs Czech Republic	2-1	L
10.06.2024	Friendly	Czech Republic vs North Macedonia	2-1	W

The Czech Republic has been on a rough patch, with only one win in their last five matches. Their defensive frailties have been evident, particularly in their heavy defeat to Georgia. This poor run of form stretches back to the European Championships, where they struggled to make an impact. Despite scoring in all five matches, their inability to keep clean sheets has been a persistent issue, conceding a total of 10 goals.

Ukraine Results

Ukraine has had a mixed run of results recently, balancing between wins and losses. Below is a breakdown of their last five games:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
07.09.2024	UNL	Ukraine vs Albania	1-2	L
26.06.2024	European Championship	Ukraine vs Belgium	0-0	D
21.06.2024	European Championship	Slovakia vs Ukraine	1-2	W
17.06.2024	European Championship	Romania vs Ukraine	3-0	L
11.06.2024	Friendly	Moldova vs Ukraine	0-4	W

Ukraine has managed two wins in their last five games, although their form has been inconsistent. They suffered a heavy 3-0 defeat to Romania but bounced back with a strong win over Moldova. Despite losing to Albania in their most recent game, Ukraine has shown they can compete at a high level, particularly with their solid defensive structure, as seen in their goalless draw against Belgium.

Czech Republic vs Ukraine Head-to-Head Results

The following table shows the results of the last five meetings between the Czech Republic and Ukraine:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
08.09.2021	Friendly	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	1-1
16.10.2018	UNL	Ukraine vs Czech Republic	1-0
06.09.2018	UNL	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	1-2
15.08.2012	Friendly	Ukraine vs Czech Republic	0-0
06.09.2011	Friendly	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	4-0

Ukraine has a slight edge in recent meetings, with two victories in the Nations League campaign of 2018-19. While the last match in 2021 ended in a 1-1 draw, the Czech Republic hasn’t been able to beat Ukraine in competitive matches in over a decade.

Kovar (GK), Zima (DF), Krejci (DF), Vitik (DF), Coufal (MF), Soucek (MF), Kalvach (MF), Zeleny (MF), Provod (FW), Schick (FW), Hlozek (FW)

Trubin (GK), Konoplya (DF), Zabarnyi (DF), Matvienko (DF), Mykolenko (DF), Sudakov (MF), Zinchenko (MF), Shaparenko (MF), Tsygankov (FW), Yaremchuk (FW), Kabaev (FW)

INJURED AND QUESTIONABLE PLAYERS

In this section, we list the players who will miss the match due to injuries or other reasons. These absences can have a significant impact on the tactical approach and overall performance of both teams.

Czech Republic Player	Reason	Ukraine Player	Reason
Matej Rynes	Injury	Artem Dovbyk	Injury
		Mykhaylo Mudryk	Injury

These unavailable players could change the dynamics of the match, as key figures like Dovbyk and Mudryk are important offensive threats for Ukraine, while Rynes’ injury will force the Czech Republic to adjust their defense.

Key Points to Consider

Ahead of the match, several key factors could influence the outcome of the game:

The Czech Republic is on a four-match winless streak in competitive games;
Ukraine has not suffered back-to-back defeats since 2020;
Tomáš Chorý, with three goals in his last seven appearances, is a potential key player for the Czech Republic;
Roman Yaremchuk has shown a tendency to score late in games, netting three of his last four goals after the 79th minute;
The Czech Republic has conceded 11 goals in their last five matches;
Ukraine has scored first in only two of their last 10 games;
Injuries to key Ukrainian players like Artem Dovbyk and Mykhaylo Mudryk may impact their attacking options;
Home advantage for the Czech Republic, where they’ve won both of their last games under manager Ivan Hašek, could be a deciding factor.

Free Tips on Czech Republic vs Ukraine

When analyzing a match like Czech Republic vs Ukraine, it’s essential to consider various factors that can significantly influence the outcome. From historical performances to current form and tactical matchups, these elements help to form a clearer picture of what to expect. Below are a few key tips based on the statistics and data of previous matches, as well as insights into team form, head-to-head encounters, and other relevant aspects.

Team Form: Both teams have been struggling recently, but Ukraine’s ability to bounce back after defeats suggests they may have the psychological edge. The Czech Republic, on the other hand, has failed to secure a victory in their last four competitive matches, potentially affecting their morale.
Head-to-Head Performance: Ukraine has a favorable record against the Czech Republic in recent competitive meetings, winning both encounters in the 2018-19 UEFA Nations League. Historical head-to-head statistics can often give an indication of which team tends to perform better in similar matchups.
Home vs Away Performance: Playing at home in Prague may give the Czech Republic a boost, as they have won their previous two home games under coach Ivan Hašek. Ukraine, while used to playing away, might find it more challenging to perform in front of a home crowd eager to see their team recover from recent disappointments.
Recent Schedule & Fatigue: Both teams played just a few days ago, but Ukraine has an advantage with a shorter travel distance, as both of their games are in Prague. This minimal travel compared to other matches in the competition could provide them with an edge in terms of fitness and preparation.
Managerial Impact: Ivan Hašek’s recent run without a competitive win could put pressure on the Czech squad, while Sergiy Rebrov has shown he can motivate his team to recover from setbacks. The influence of each manager’s tactics could be a key element to watch, particularly given Ukraine’s tendency to perform well in pressure situations.

These insights should give a more detailed understanding of what to expect in the Czech Republic vs Ukraine match prediction 2024, helping you make informed decisions when betting or analyzing the game.

Czech Republic vs Ukraine Prediction 2024

Based on recent performance and head-to-head history, Ukraine seems to have a minor edge against the Czech Republic. Still, one cannot dismiss the home form of the Czech Republic. Ukraine’s inability to start strong and the defensive problems of the Czech Republic point to a fiercely fought game. Both teams want to prevent more losses in their Nations League campaigns, thus even if Ukraine might have an advantage, a draw seems like a most likely result.
