Germany kick-off a new era on Saturday evening as they welcome Hungary in their opening clash of the UEFA Nations League. Several of Germany’s senior stars stepped down from the national team after Euro 2024, so expect many new faces for Die Mannschaft.

Coach Julian Nagelsmann has won seven of his first 13 matches in charge, losing three of those games. The two teams also met in the previous Nations League campaign, with Germany losing at home and earning a draw away.

Julian Nagelsmann has appointed Bayern Munich’s Joshua Kimmich as Germany captain and he is expected to start at right-back for the team. Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller will be hoping to make his international debut; with players like Aleksandar Pavlovic, Robert Andrich, and Pascal Gross all gunning to fill in the midfield roles previously occupied by retired veterans Toni Kroos and Ilkay Gundogan.

Antonio Rudiger has been rested, whereas Leroy Sane is expected to miss this game due to fitness issues. Florian Wirtz, Kai Havertz, Jamal Musiala, and Niclas Fullkrug will complete the attack

Key Players to Watch out for
Jamal Musiala (Germany)

The young Bayern Munich attacking midfielder will most probably be the face of this new-look German team for many years to come and we expect him to be the star at the beginning of this new era. Jamal Musiala’s presence of mind in the final third will be key to all of Germany’s attacking transitions in this clash.

Dominik Szoboszlai (Hungary)

Like-for-like Musiala, Dominik Szoboszlai makes Hungary tick when it comes to attacking transitions and set-piece opportunities. His pinpoint accuracy in passing and incredible shooting prowess could pose a threat to Germany’s goal.

Germany vs Hungary Prediction

While Hungary possesses some very experienced players compared to Germany, we believe the young stars of Die Mannschaft will prevail to kick off a new era in style.

Predicted Score: Germany 2-1 Hungary
