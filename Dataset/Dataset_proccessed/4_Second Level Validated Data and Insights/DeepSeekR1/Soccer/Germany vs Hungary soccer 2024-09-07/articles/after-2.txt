GERMANY HIT HUNGARY FOR FIVE
Jamal Musiala scored a solo wondergoal as Germany thumped Hungary 5-0 to get their UEFA Nations League campaign off to a winning start in Dusseldorf.
Niclas Fullkrug, Florian Wirtz, Aleksandar Pavlovic and Kai Havertz were also on target on a ruthless night for Julien Nagelsmann’s side.
Germany put Hungary under pressure from the off and after a goal-line clearance by Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai and a missed Fullkrug one-on-one chance, the West Ham striker made amends to put the hosts in front with a tap-in inside the six-yard box.
Havertz had two chances to double Germany’s lead before the break. The first came when his fierce heart thundered off the bar and bounced the wrong side of the goal-line, and then he sent a curled effort wide of the post on the stroke of half-time.
Germany finally added a second after an hour when Wirtz found Musiala on the halfway line, as the Bayern Munich superstar drove his own half, holding off two defenders before he excellently slotted the ball home.
The hosts began to pur at this stage and before long they had their third as Musiala returned the favour to set up Wirtz, who squeezed the ball past Peter Gulacsi.
Pavlovic added a fourth before Havertz’s persistence finally paid off, as he wrapped up the three points from the spot.

HAVERTZ RATTLES THE BAR AGAIN!
It’s so unlucky for the Arsenal man, whose half-volley thunders onto the bar and once again drops just on the wrong side of the goal-line. You can see the disappointment on his face, it's the second time that's happened to him tonight!
