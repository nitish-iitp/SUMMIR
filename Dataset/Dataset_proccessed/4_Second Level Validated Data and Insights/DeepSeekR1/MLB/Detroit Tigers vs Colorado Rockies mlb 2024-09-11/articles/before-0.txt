Colorado Rockies vs Detroit Tigers Prediction

I’ll lean toward the Tigers. Mize hasn’t been too bad over his last three starts. In that trio, he’s given up a combined six earned runs in 16.2 innings on 14 hits and four walks. Mize is 1-0 in those three.

On Tuesday the Tigers got a stellar effort from Montero in the complete-game shutout. There were a few good performances in the batters’ box too, leading to a dominant win for Detroit. This one likely won’t be so easy but the Tigers are in good shape.
