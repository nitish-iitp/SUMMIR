MILWAUKEE -- Aaron Civale and Aaron Ashby combined on a two-hit shutout and William Contreras stole home to help the Milwaukee Brewers beat the San Francisco Giants 6-0 on Thursday.

The NL Central-leading Brewers (77-56) won two of three from the Giants. They are 9 1/2 games ahead of the Chicago Cubs for the biggest division lead in the majors.

"This team, as soon as you think, 'Ahh, I don't know about this club. They don't have this guy. Who's this guy? They don't have enough of this. They don't have enough of that,' they've got enough of something," Brewers Manager Pat Murphy said. "Because they keep posting and keep competing."

The Giants (67-68) went 2-4 on a six-game trip to fall below .500.

"It looked like an awful game for us, all the way around, whether it was the pitching, defense, offense," Giants Manager Bob Melvin said. "Their guy pitched good. He had a good cutter. He had a good sinker, threw just enough off-speed to keep us off balance."

Garrett Mitchell homered for the Brewers, and Jackson Chourio drove in two runs. Contreras went 2 for 3 and drove in a run, to go along with his steal of home.

Civale (5-8) worked seven innings for his longest outing of the season. He struck out seven while allowing only two hits and two walks in his third quality start in his last four outings.

The 29-year-old right-hander owns a 1.45 ERA in five starts at American Family Field since the Brewers acquired him in a July 3 trade with the Tampa Bay Rays.

"Just worked on getting the delivery in a good spot," Civale said. "It's on me to go out there and compete. That's the emphasis with each pitch, is just to throw a competitive pitch. Whatever happens, know that the work behind it is valid, and just having confidence in that."

Ashby pitched two perfect innings, striking out three.

The Brewers scored two runs in the second off Hayden Birdsong (3-4).

Mitchell hit a one-out homer to right-center. Gary Sanchez followed with a walk before advancing to third on a Joey Ortiz double and scoring on Blake Perkins' sacrifice fly.

CARDINALS 4, PADRES 1 Masyn Winn hit a home run while Sonny Gray (12-9) threw six strong innings in leading St. Louis to a victory over San Diego to earn a split in the four-game series. Winn, a rookie, scored the game-winning run Wednesday after he hit a two-out single to start the ninth inning rally. In the four games against San Diego, Winn produced nine hits in 17 at-bats.

MARLINS 12, ROCKIES 8 Derek Hill had three hits and the second two-home run game of his career, Kyle Stowers had three hits and four RBI, and Miami beat the Colorado to earn a split of the four-game series.

METS 3, DIAMONDBACKS 2 Jose Iglesias drove in Tyrone Taylor with a base hit in the ninth inning, and the New York Mets rallied for a win over Arizona. Jesse Winker hit a one-out double off Justin Martinez (5-5) before Taylor entered as a pinch runner. Taylor advanced to third on a flyball to right from J.D. Martinez and Iglesias ripped a hard grounder up the middle that deflected off the glove of diving shortstop Geraldo Perdomo.

PHILLIES 5, BRAVES 4 Nick Castellanos hit a go-ahead two-run home run in seventh inning, Brandon Marsh hit a three-run shot in the sixth and Philadelphia built on its NL East lead with a win over Atlanta. The Phillies hold a six-game lead over the Braves for the division crown after taking the opener of a four-game series.

AMERICAN LEAGUE

ANGELS 3, TIGERS 0 Zach Neto homered, rookie Jack Kochanowicz pitched six shutout innings and the Los Angeles Angels ended a seven-game losing streak with a win over Detroit.

ASTROS 6, ROYALS 3 Pinch hitter Zach Dezenzo drew a bases-loaded walk to break a 3-3 tie and Mauricio Dubon followed with a two-run single to cap a four-run eighth inning as Houston rallied to beat Kansas City.

BLUE JAYS 2, RED SOX 0 Bowden Francis took a no-hitter into the sixth and left after allowing just one hit in seven innings, and Toronto beat Boston. Francis (8-3) faced the minimum through 5 1/3 innings, with the only Boston baserunner coming when Jarren Duran reached on an error in the fourth. The no-hit bid ended with one out in the sixth, when Nick Sogard blooped a soft single to center.

RANGERS 2, WHITE SOX 1 Corey Seager hit his 200th career home run and Nathan Eovaldi pitched seven scoreless innings, leading Texas to a victory over the lowly Chicago White Sox. Eovaldi (10-7) matched his season high with 10 strikeouts in his second consecutive win. The right-hander was working on a no-hitter before Gavin Sheets hit a leadoff single in the fifth.

INTERLEAGUE

REDS 10, ATHLETICS 9 TJ Friedl capped Cincinnati's three-run ninth inning with a two-run single, and the Reds beat Lawrence Butler and Oakland. Tyler Stephenson and Will Benson homered for Cincinnati, which had lost five of six. Stephenson finished with three hits and two RBI.
