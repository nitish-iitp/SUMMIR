San Francisco Giants vs Milwaukee Brewers Prediction

I’ll lean toward the Brewers. Civale is doing well lately—outside of a shaky outing in Oakland his last time up. In that one, Civale gave up three earned in 4.0 frames. Prior to that, he had just two earned in 12.1 innings during a pair of wins, though. As for Birdsong, he’s got just one earned in his last 8.2 innings of work total.

On Wednesday the Brewers only scored in the fifth inning but it turned out to be enough. Milwaukee had a couple of spotty pitching performances in relief behind Freddy Peralta but it all worked out. I’d like to see the bats get moving a little better on Thursday, but Milwaukee should be in a great spot.
