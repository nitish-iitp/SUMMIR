Mets not a better team than us: Phillies’ Nick Castellanos

Nick Castellanos gave the Mets their credit after they knocked out the Phillies in Game 4 on Wednesday night, but the Phillies right fielder was hesitant to call the Mets the better team even after the loss. 

In a series of questions that Castellanos asked himself as part of an answer to a reporter, he expressed that even though the Mets had won, the Phillies were the better team overall. 

“Are there things that we could have done better? Yes,” Castellanos said. 

“Are there things that we could have done differently? Yes. Do I think that they are a better team than us? No. But this series, they were.”

The Phillies fell short of what many had expected, and there is some feeling that things could change after this season. 

Still, as frustrated as Castellanos was when he spoke to the media after the loss, he did give the Mets credit for how they played in the series. 

“I mean, losing sucks, man — there’s no way around it,” he said. “But instead of feeling sorry for myself, I’m gonna give them credit because right now the Mets are playing really good baseball. They’re hot. From watching them play in the beginning of the year in April and May … and watching Jose Iglesias be able to unify them and get the city to buy into something bigger is nothing short of incredible. And just, give them their credit, they beat us.”

Castellanos had seven hits in 17 at-bats during the NLDS, which included the game-tying home run and walk-off hit in Game 2. 

His batting average was an impressive .412 during the four-game series.

The Mets will advance to the NLCS for the first time since 2015, as they await the winner of the Padres-Dodgers series.
