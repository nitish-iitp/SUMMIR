Cleveland Guardians vs. Tampa Bay Rays, Sept. 15, 2024
By Joe Noga, cleveland.com

CLEVELAND, Ohio — Strange things seem to happen when Brayan Rocchio tries to bunt, whether he is successful or not. That was the case again on Sunday when Rocchio failed to get a bunt down in the second inning and instead blooped an RBI single into right field on the next pitch from Tampa’s Taj Bradley in a 2-0 Guardians win against the Rays.

Rocchio’s bunt attempt bounced up and hit his bat before settling in front of the plate. Catcher Ben Rortvedt would have had Daniel Schneemann dead to rights coming down the third base line, but it was ruled a foul ball by home plate umpire Alan Porter, with a little help from third base ump Chad Whitson.

Instead, Rocchio’s 34th RBI on a cutter from Bradley scored Schneemann, who opened the inning with a leadoff double and moved to third on a ground out by Bo Naylor. That was all the offense Cleveland would need as starter Ben Lively tossed five efficient innings, holding the Rays scoreless on just 59 pitches.

Cleveland’s bullpen backed Lively with four shutout frames, and Emmanuel Clase picked up his league-leading 45th save, a career high, with a 1-2-3 ninth, moving one save closer to the Guardians’ single-season record of 46 held by Jose Mesa (1995).

The Guardians reduced their magic number to clinch the American League Central Division to 9 over the Royals, who lost to Pittsburgh shortly after the Guardians and Rays went final. Cleveland also moved closer to securing a playoff spot, with a magic number of 4 (effectively 3) over Detroit and Seattle. The earliest Cleveland can clinch a playoff bid is Tuesday against Minnesota.

It was Cleveland’s 12th shutout win, and marked the 55th time the Guardians bullpen tossed at least three shutout innings in a game, the most in baseball.

Sunday was not the first time Rocchio found success after failing to get a bunt down in an RBI situation. Facing New York on Sept. 4, Rocchio twice failed to drop a bunt fair, but with two strikes, the rookie shortstop blasted his seventh home run into the seats at Yankee Stadium.

Rocchio, who is batting .273 with an .875 OPS in 13 games since Sept. 1, said when he squared to bunt against Bradley, he was trying to give Schneeman a chance to score.

“That bunt was coming from myself,” Rocchio said. “I wanted to get the run in, and then I switched my mind and tried to hit the ball in the air. That’s what happened.”

Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said Rocchio is a smart baseball player, and he is developing into the type of hitter he will someday be.

“He seems to come up with big hits,” Vogt said. “He seems to find a way to drive that run in, whether it’s a bunt, whether it’s a flare, whether it’s a barrel or a homer or whatever it might be. He is learning and he’s continuing to develop into an unbelievable major league shortstop.”

Cleveland added a run in the fifth when Angel Martinez opened the inning with a single off Bradley (6-11, 4.39) and moved to third on another bloop hit, this time off the bat of José Ramírez. Tampa’s Junior Caminero failed to cover third as shortstop Jose Caballero sprinted toward the left field line to make a play on the ball off Ramírez’s bat. That allowed Martinez to round second and dive into third safely.

After Tampa manager Kevin Cash summoned Mason Montgomery from the bullpen, Ramírez took off for second base, drawing a throw from catcher Ben Rortvedt. Ramírez was tagged out, but Martinez scored from third for a 2-0 Guardians lead.

Ramírez finished woith a pair of hits, including a double in the first inning that extended his on-base streak to 14 games. The six-time All-Star is on an eight-game hitting streak and batting .281 with a .812 OPS in that span. Ramírez’s 43 multi-hit games lead the Guardians and rank tied for 10th in the American League.

Martinez, recalled from Triple-A Columbus prior to Saturday’s game, has reached base in four of eight plate appearances, including two hits Sunday.

Lively, meanwhile, worked his way out of trouble after allowing a pair of hits in the first to Brandon Lowe and Jonathan Aranda. He got Dylan Carlson to ground into a fielder’s choice to end the inning and settled in after that.

Following Aranda’s two-out single in the first, Lively retired 13 of the next 14 batters he faced, including back-to-back strikeouts of Ben Rortvedt and Jonny DeLuca to end the second. He exited after allowing base hits to Yandy Diaz and Brandon Lowe to open the sixth.

Coming off a start against the White Sox that saw him exit in the second inning after taking a line drive off the back of his leg, Lively scattered four hits and did not allow a run in five innings. He told reporters after the game that he wanted to carry the success he was having through two innings in Chicago into his outing against the Rays.

“It’s just about digging deep,” Lively said. “This is the time of the year to just start digging down deep, and I am. Just trying to get everything right at the right time.”

Vogt summoned Cade Smith from the bullpen and smith fanned Caminero on three pitches for the first out of the inning before getting Aranda on a foul pop behind the plate and striking out Carlson on a perfect splitter at the bottom of the strike zone.

Vogt praised Smith’s work ethic and said it has allowed the rookie to turn in a dominant year as a reliever.

“We have a ton of detailed, hardworking people on our team, and I think Cade might be number one,” Vogt said. “I’m not shocked to see the consistent results that he’s been putting out there because he puts in the consistent work for it.”

Next: The Guardians open a four-game series against Minnesota on Monday at Progressive Field. Lefty Matthew Boyd (2-1, 2.18) will start Game 1 against Twins right-hander Pablo López (15-8, 3.88). First pitch is set for 6:40 p.m. The game will air on Bally Sports Great Lakes, WTAM 1100 AM, WMMS 100.7 FM, WARF 1350 AM (Spanish) and the Guardians Radio Network.
