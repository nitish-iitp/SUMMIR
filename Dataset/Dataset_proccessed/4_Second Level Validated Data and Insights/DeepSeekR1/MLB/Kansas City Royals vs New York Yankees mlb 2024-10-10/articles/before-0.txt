New York Yankees 3-2 Kansas City Royals

Giancarlo Stanton came through in a big way for the Yankees, smashing a clutch home run in the eighth inning to power them to a 3-2 win over the Kansas City Royals in Game 3 of the AL Division Series. Stanton’s standout performance included three hits and a stolen base, showcasing his all-around impact on the game.

The Yankees’ bullpen was lights out, shutting down the Royals’ offense to preserve the narrow lead. With momentum on their side, the Yankees will turn to ace Gerrit Cole, a six-time All-Star, on Thursday night. Cole will have the opportunity to pitch the Yankees into the American League Championship Series.

Bullpen Brilliance Secure Game 3

The Yankees’ bullpen played a crucial role in their 3-2 victory over the Royals in Game 3 of the AL Division Series. After cycling through four relievers, Kris Bubic’s appearance in the eighth inning proved to be a turning point. Bubic’s mistake on a 3-1 pitch allowed Giancarlo Stanton to launch a game-changing home run.

Luke Weaver‘s performance in the bottom of the inning was equally impressive, as he calmly navigated a bases-loaded situation to secure the save. The Yankees’ bullpen’s dominance was a key factor in their victory.

Aaron Judge‘s offensive struggles continued, as he went 0 for 4 with a walk. However, the Yankees’ patience at the plate, evident in their 22 walks throughout the series, played a significant role in their success.

The game marked a historic occasion, as it was the first postseason contest at Kauffman Stadium in over 3,000 days. Royals legend Eric Hosmer threw out the ceremonial first pitch, adding to the significance of the event.

Despite facing challenges against Seth Lugo’s diverse pitch mix, the Yankees’ offensive efforts eventually paid off, with Stanton’s home run being the decisive factor in their victory.

Yankees’ Offensive Struggles Hampered by Defensive Lapses

The Yankees faced an early challenge in the first inning, as Juan Soto narrowly missed a home run that would have cleared the fence in 17 other ballparks. Judge’s powerful line drive was also caught by Bobby Witt Jr., showcasing the Royals’ defensive prowess.

The Yankees finally broke through in the fourth inning, with Giancarlo Stanton’s double allowing Juan Soto to score. However, the Royals’ offense responded with two runs in the bottom of the fifth inning, thanks to Kyle Isbel’s double and Michael Massey’s line drive that evaded Soto’s glove.

Clarke Schmidt’s performance on the mound was mixed, as he allowed four hits and a walk in 4 2/3 innings. The Royals’ starting pitcher, Seth Lugo, also faced challenges, giving up two hits and walking four batters against the Yankees’ potent offense.

The Yankees Roster
Up Next

Gerrit Cole, the Yankees’ ace pitcher, will look to redeem himself on Thursday night after a challenging performance in Game 1 of the series. Cole’s 8-5 record and 3.41 ERA demonstrate his overall effectiveness, despite the recent setback.

The Royals will counter with Michael Wacha (13-8, 3.35 ERA), who exited his previous start after pitching four innings. Wacha’s early exit allowed the Yankees to stage a comeback and ultimately secure the victory.

The rematch between Cole and Wacha promises to be an intriguing battle, as both pitchers have showcased their abilities throughout the season.
