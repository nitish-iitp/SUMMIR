Patrick Mahomes has made it to the Royals' Game 3 against the Yankees after claiming it could cause a 'feud' with his wife Brittany.

The Royals, who are of course neighbors of Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs, are hosting a pivotal matchup against New York in the ALDS, and Mahomes clearly wanted to be in attendance to root on his hometown team.

But he suggested that going to the game might cause issues with his wife Brittany after the Chiefs beat the Saints last weekend. 

'It's bye week, so Brittany's vacationing and me getting to the Royals game, we'll feud for sure,' Mahomes said. 

Nonetheless, Mahomes was seen at the game as his brother Jackson posted a picture of them both wearing Royals jerseys.

Mahomes had joked that he and his wife Brittany could 'feud' if went to the Royals game

The series is tied at one game apiece. 

Watching Game 3 with former Chiefs receiver and Yankees fan Gehrig Dieter, Mahomes could be seen passionately reacting when the Royals leveled the game  on Wednesday.

During the action against the Saints, the Chiefs provided in-game updates on the scoreboard.

The Royals evened up their ALDS series against the Yankees 4-2, while the Chiefs won 26-13 over New Orleans.

'I really wanted to focus on the game and then let look after and maybe get, like, a scoreboard kind of shot of it,' Mahomes said of the in-stadium updates.

'And they gave us a couple of those, but like, you could feel that stuff was going good, and there was kind of a lull there, kind of, I think, towards the end of the end of the game.'

On Wednesday, the Royals fell to the Yankees 3-2.
