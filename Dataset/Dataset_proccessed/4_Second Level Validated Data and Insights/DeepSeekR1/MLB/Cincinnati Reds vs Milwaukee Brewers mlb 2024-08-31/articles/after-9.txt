CINCINNATI -- A day after he rolled his right ankle, Brewers rookie Jackson Chourio was back in the starting lineup Saturday. The question was whether his ankle was good, or just “good enough."

Turns out, that wasn’t the right question at all.

“Increíble,” Chourio said in Spanish while breaking into a big smile.

It’s easy to feel incredible when you’re 20 years old and surging toward the finish of a special debut season, which continued with Chourio reaching safely four times and collecting three more hits including a go-ahead, ninth-inning home run in Milwaukee’s 5-4 win over the Reds at Great American Ball Park. It was the Brewers’ 80th win of the season.

Besides hitting the home run, his 17th, Chourio also stole his 20th base as he moved closer to becoming the youngest player in Major League history to log a 20/20 season. Chourio would be the third player to accomplish that feat, fittingly, in his age 20 season, but the other two, Vada Pinson of the Reds in 1959 and Mike Trout of the Angels in 2012, turned 21 along the way. Chourio won’t celebrate his 21st birthday until next March.

“I think it’s getting pretty freaking ridiculous, to be completely honest,” said first baseman Jake Bauers, who left his own mark on the victory with a game-ending defensive gem in the bottom of the ninth. “This kid is special, for sure.”

And center fielder Blake Perkins, who left his own mark by robbing another home run: “All the Brewers people should be excited about getting to watch him play for the next decade or however long he plays.”

All of that production came after Chourio and the Brewers worried for a few moments on Friday that this special season might be over. In Game 1 of a doubleheader sweep of the Reds, Chourio hustled to first base on a groundout and severely turned his ankle while stepping on the bag. Two members of Milwaukee’s athletic training staff walked with him back to the dugout.

But he was able to finish the game and received treatment before his teammates romped the Reds in a 14-0 win in Game 2. After that, it was a matter of how he would feel when he stood up again after a night’s sleep.

“I woke up today and didn’t really feel anything,” Chourio said.

Asked whether that came as a surprise, considering how badly hurt he initially appeared, manager Pat Murphy said, “I’m not as surprised. The first time you do an ankle like that -- I’ve rolled mine 25 times trying to play basketball. The first time you do it, it probably freaked him out. Almost like your bone comes out of the socket.”

In the end, it was just a scare.

“I felt something I hadn’t necessarily felt before,” Chourio said. “But now, today, everything is good. Everything is ready to go."

That was clear from the start of a victory that kept the Brewers 10 games up on the Cubs in the National League Central standings and tied with the Phillies for the second-best record in the NL. Chourio singled in the first inning, doubled and stole third base in the third before Willy Adames delivered yet another three-run home run, flew out in the fifth and then took a walk in the seventh -- a plate appearance that pleased Murphy nearly as much as the home run that followed.

“He’s still learning the finer points of the game, but you don’t need to tell him too much,” Murphy said. “You don’t want to overdo it. But man, I thought he was out for the season after he twisted his ankle. And then he’s playing a big role in winning the game for us.”

Chourio wasn’t the only contributor. Just when it looked like Perkins’ home run robbery to preserve a 4-4 tie in the sixth would be the play of the game, Bauers came along and salvaged a four-strikeout night by making a diving stop of Ty France’s shot with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth.

Without that play, the Reds likely would have walked off against Brewers closer Devin Williams, who’d walked two batters and hit another while pitching for the second straight day. Williams logged his 13th consecutive scoreless, hitless appearance against Cincinnati dating to September 2022 with Bauers’ help.

“He got the sombrero. Good thing he didn’t wear it out to the field,” Murphy said.

It’s been that kind of season for the Brewers.

“I think everyone just kind of puts their grain of sand in,” Chourio said. “Everyone does their part.”
