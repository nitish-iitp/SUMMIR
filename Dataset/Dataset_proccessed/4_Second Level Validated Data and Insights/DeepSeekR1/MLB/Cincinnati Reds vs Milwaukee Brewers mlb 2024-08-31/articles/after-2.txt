Rally falls short, Reds robbed in a 5-4 loss to Milwaukee
 Doug Gray  08/31/2024 54

The Cincinnati Reds had several chances to score enough runs to win the game on Saturday, but a mental blunder and two incredible defensive plays by the Milwaukee defense helped the 1st place Brewers hang on for a 5-4 win.

Final	R	H	E
Milwaukee Brewers (80-56)
	5	8	0
Cincinnati Reds (64-73)	4	8	3
W: Ashby (1-2) L: Wilson (1-4) SV: Williams (8)

Box Score | Game Thread

Fernando Cruz found himself in trouble in the top of the 2nd inning after an error by Elly De La Cruz allowed Willy Adames to reach to safely to begin the inning and then he issued a 1-out walk to put two men on base. He would clamp down and pick up back-to-back strikeouts to get out of the inning and keep the game scoreless.

Cincinnati turned to the bullpen in the top of the 3rd inning and brought in Buck Farmer. He would give up a 1-out double to Jackson Chourio and then walked William Contreras. That brought Willy Adames to the plate and he crushed the first pitch he saw for a 3-run home run to put the Brewers on top.

The Reds got back-to-back singles to lead off the bottom of the inning and put runners on the corners. Spencer Steer then grounded into a double play, but inexplicably Noelvi Marte didn’t even attempt to score from third on the play and just stood there watching the play behind him that the Brewers were clearly going to concede the run on to turn two. He would still be standing at third when the inning ended two pitches later.

David Buchanan took over for the Reds in the 4th, making his first big league appearance since 2014. He would keep the Brewers off of the board in the 4th and 5th innings. In the bottom of the 5th the Reds would get a little rally going with Spencer Steer cashing in two runs on a 1-out single that made it 3-2.

Milwaukee would get one of those runs back in the top of the 6th against Buchanan after a single and ground-rule double put a runner on third with no outs. The Brewers would get the run across on a grounder to make it 4-2. In the bottom of the inning the Reds would tie the game up after a walk to Ty France and a 2-run home run by Amed Rosario that landed in the upper deck before bouncing back onto the field. Noelvi Marte crushed what he thought was a go-ahead home run and stayed at the plate admiring it, only to see Blake Perkins leap at the wall and rob him of a home run. Marte wasn’t even half way to first base when Perkins caught the ball.

The Brewers picked up two 1-out walks in the top of the 7th to threaten, but Tony Santillan – who issued that second walk – struck out the next two hitters to get out of the jam. He got himself into trouble in the top of the 8th after fielding a bunt and then throwing the ball into right field, allowing the leadoff batter to reach second base. Much like the previous inning he turned around and struck out the remaining hitters he saw to get out of the inning unscathed.

Justin Wilson took over for the Reds in the 9th and he gave up the lead as Jackson Chourio hit a 1-out solo home run into the seats in right field. Cincinnati entered the bottom of the 9th ready to face Devin Williams. Tyler Stephenson would earn a 1-out walk to put the tying run on. Elly De La Cruz then drew a 2-out walk to represent the winning run at first base. The control problems for Williams continued as he then hit TJ Friedl to load the bases. Ty France hit a hard grounder the other way only to see Brewers first baseman Jake Bauers fully lay out on a dive to catch it, then get up and beat him to the bag to end the game.

Key Moment of the Game


Jake Bauers incredibly diving play to end the game on what would have otherwise been a walk-off hit for Ty France.

Notes Worth Noting

The Brewerss went 1-15 with runners in scoring position. Cincinnati didn’t do much better, going 1-10.

The Reds still haven’t had a hit against Devin Williams since Alejo Lopez had an infield single back on September 11th of 2022.

Bring back Alejo Lopez! Reds need someone who can get a hit off Devin Williams. I was always a big Lopez fan.

Melvin 08/31/2024

jmb 09/01/2024

Yes, he’s playing at AAA for he Braves this season, hitting .310. Hit .292 for Louisville last season. But there’s something about him that teams seem not to like. The Braves claimed a veteran off waivers instead of calling him up when their start third baseman went down with an injury. Reds could probably sign him to a minor league contract in the offseason.

TR 09/01/2024

Perhaps Alejo Lopez is not liked because he hits too many singles.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

My wife asked to take out the recycling the recycling this evening.

I stood there admiring my handiwork and then I realized that with the holiday it wouldn’t be picked up until next week.

I still hit a home run later.

Daytonnati 08/31/2024

It’s the little things, Harry 

Danny 08/31/2024

Just as I mentioned yesterday in the recap- no accountability.

If bell doesn’t understand the situation and the impact of Hinds then Marte screwing up on the basepaths- you would think there has to be some coach on the staff that understands and would tell him.

sultanofswaff 09/01/2024

The Brewers broadcast team yesterday said the Reds lead all of baseball in runners thrown out on the basepaths.

It’s not going to change who we are!

Still a Red 08/31/2024

Snake bit again. Can’t buy a win now. Hope the team can show some mettle down the stretch and not just give up.

CI3J 09/01/2024

I’m all for them not giving up, but September’s schedule is likely going to make wins tough to come by.

LDS 08/31/2024

Inquiring Reds fans want to know – will the Reds ever win another series against Milwaukee? Only 10.5 out with 25 to go, the Reds are still in it. Just ask Bell.

jmb 09/01/2024

Win a series against Milwaukee? They will, but not this season.

TR 09/01/2024

Milwaukee, going way back to the Braves or the current Brewers, usually has been a team tough to beat.

Optimist 08/31/2024

Just out of random curiousity noticing a few things.

1 – Bauers with the defensive play to end the game – seems he’s an excellent late game defensive replacement. His offensive lines are not at all impressive, yet he’s had several seasons with hundreds of ABs, and has some obvious power. Just the right player in the right place at the right time. How often do the Reds plan on that, execute it, and succeed?

2 – Went back and looked at the Athletics franchise history – a sobering baseline comparison of futility – particularly the 13 seasons (1955-1967 inclusive), and a few earlier decades. What was the KC ownership doing (yes, I recall the comments at the time that they were essentially a Yankee farm team – trading back and forth)? Has the Reds ownership reached that level?

TR 09/01/2024

There’s been no real trades with the Reds current ownership since the blockbuster trade of Luis Castillo a few years ago.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

#1 he was briefly a Red in 2022 (at Louisville Bats AAA) but was traded to NYY in May 2022.

Jim Walker 09/01/2024

I am happy for the Reds and Amed Rosario that he got that 2 run HR Saturday. However, since he is a service time free agent at the end of the season who has never consistently hit for power, why was he playing ahead of Rece Hinds? With India and Espinal both out of the starting lineup, why not bring Steer in to play 2B and put Hinds in the OF?

Just asking.

Melvin 09/01/2024

I’ll forward your question to Krall/Bell. haha Maybe you can ask why Smith is playing while you’re at it.

CI3J 09/01/2024

Because David Bell.

jmb 09/01/2024

And why hasn’t he played more often since being claimed by the lowly Reds? I guess they don’t want him to show up their younger, struggling players. But Marte and Hinds and others could learn from the guy.

doofus 09/01/2024

Perhaps a Castellini has too much to say about who plays? Just a thought.

jmb 09/01/2024

Another error for Elly, and then a diving catch. That’s Elly! But do you want such ups and downs at a defense-first position? The hype-millers celebrate him as a superstar already. The Mets’ Vientos’ numbers are better this season, save the steals, but no one claims he’s a star, let alone a superstar (just to pick one young player to compare with). I’d rather have Iglesias or Rosario at short than Elly moving forward.

Marte’s hesitancy at third and his strange slide into home make him seem not yet ready for the bigs. He did get a couple hits, though, and almost hit one out. Will he be better next season?

MBS 09/01/2024

You might get in trouble questioning EDLC’s ability to play SS. He’s a highlight real making defender, who also commits a ton of errors as a SS.

Whitt JR: 17 OAA, 13 E
Lindor: 15 OAA, 11 E
Swanson: 14 OAA, 5 E
EDLC: 12 OAA, 27 E
Volpe: 12 OAA, 14 E

EDLC makes too many errors as a SS.

2023 EDLC, SS 591 Innings, 13 E
2023 EDLC, 3B 259 Innings, 1 E

It’s not just a stat thing, EDLC looked more comfortable at 3B. The guy could be a GG type there, and he will never be that level of defender as a SS. I’d let McLain play SS next season, with Arroyo playing 2B by 2026. That would be a lockdown defensive infield.

Mauired 09/01/2024

Elly is 22 and doing fine. Why don’t you compare all those guys at 22 and see how they compare. Many of them were in the minors.

MBS 09/01/2024

Vlope is 23, but sure

Whitt JR Age 22 16 E
Lindor Age 22 12 E
Swanson Age 23 20 E
Vlope Age 22 17 E

Keep in mind these are full seasons, so EDLC likely has more Es coming before the seasons up.

I don’t disagree that EDLC will get better, but he’s not going to get to their level as SS. It’s not a knock against him, his body isn’t made for SS. We are trying to square peg a round hole. He’s know he’s amazing at 3B (my preference) and can presume with his speed, arm, and instincts amazing at CF.

3B, and OF are two spots that we are lacking current and near help. At SS we will have McLain back next season, and Arroyo on the horizon.

Mauired 09/01/2024

He does have to decrease the errors. And last year I was in the club that he just didn’t seem like a shortstop but he’s made a lot of improvements defensively (and offensively) this year. And I think he deserves more time. He will continue to improve and cleanup his mistakes with more reps. There’s also something to be said about not forcing your best player into a needless and unwanted position change when the team needs to sign him to an extension and make him the long term face of the franchise.

MBS 09/01/2024

He did make improvements, and I think he’ll make more. I just don’t ever see him being a legit GG there. BTW he played 3B for the last few season as well, so it’s not a new position for him.

DataDumpster 09/01/2024

Nice writeup as usual by Doug but the Reds “robbed” doesn’t quite capture the gist of this game. Yes, the Brews defense make a few sparkling plays but we made 3 errors. Yes, inexplicably, Bell’s 7-8-9 hitters got on base enough that RBI Steer was able to drive them in. Not inexplicably, that was maybe the only RISP hit in the game. Further out on the unbelievable, Marte, Marte! Also looks like Mr. House over there didn’t scream at him to start running. If that wasn’t too ridiculous, I watched the Atlanta-Philly game (rare televised local game for me) and the Reds-Brews simultaneously as such. The somewhat amateurish newscasters got in some well deserved sharp jabs in for Marte and several other bad plays but really showed their colors when they hyped up our Louisville express service when the first guy asked how far that is from Cincinnati and he said 30, maybe 45 minutes. They also mentioned that Maile went to HS in Covington, which is where the airport is. Close, but no cigar. That was not the ‘A’ team with Smoltz.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

Maile went to HS at Cov Cath in Park Hills, which is about 15 miles from CVG, which is located in rural Boone County. The airport is not in Covington.

Doug Gray 09/01/2024

Making the headline “this effing team is gonna kill us all” seemed less appropriate.

Michael Wilson 09/01/2024

I can not see how the front office, manager and coaching staff can keep their jobs. And to top it off one of their favorite responses is to “stay the course.”

CI3J 09/01/2024

I can not see how the front office, manager and coaching staff can keep their jobs.

I can.

It’s called “not caring”. It’s what the Castellinis do.

“Where ya gonna go?”

gusnwally 09/01/2024

Park Hills borders Covington .1st suburb south.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

15 miles from CVG airport. Airport NOT in Covington.

gusnwally 09/01/2024

Gotcha, I misread your comment.Spent my first 19 years in Park Hills. Went to CCH with Luke’s uncle Tom. Great athletic family.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

I grew up 1 mile south of CCH but I went to St X. I remember his grandpa Dick Maile as star CCH basketball player in early 1960s.

doofus 09/01/2024

I went to Appleton West HS 500 miles northwest of CVG. Same HS that Danny Jansen went to.

VaRedsFan 09/01/2024

So Sam Moll was warming up when Santillan was pitching.
Yet the manager goes with Wilson, who has been atrocious in tie game, or small lead situations lately.

Moll warmed up for nothing, and then the lesser pitcher was inserted into the game.

LDS 09/01/2024

Another August, another second half collapse 12-17 for the month. Last year 10-17. The year before that 11-17. Way back in 2021, the Reds had a winning August. Then collapsed in September. The pattern is pretty clear. The apologists will say “it’s the roster”, “it’s the injuries”, blah, blah, blah. No folks, it’s the organization, from top to bottom. Yes, Bell is a lousy manager, that’s no longer debatable. But the bloom is off the Krall rose as well. Not much that he’s done during his tenure has borne fruit. The lauded farm system is in a shambles. Now it’s the guys coming back from injuries that’s going to make this team a contender. Nope, not happening. Either the team spends some money and acquires proven above average major league talent or this is what the Reds are. The sad thing is we fans are depending on Phil wanting to put his stamp on the team and show up dear old dad. And that’s not something to count on. It’s more likely that Phil is even stingier than Bob.

JB 09/01/2024

Yep everybody is putting it all on McLain. If he didn’t get injured ,why the Reds would be contenders. That young man is going to be carrying a lot of weight next year. Don’t worry Matt, they will find another excuse.

Rob 09/01/2024

It has very little to do with McLain. First of all, who has any idea what we have there? Via Prospect Rankings, for whatever they are worth, he was never in Barrerro or Senzel high cotton territory. And I believe after the Castillo trade, he was rated behind both Marte and ELDC. Point being that if my memory has not failed me, he is not in prospect high cotton according to the EXPERTS.

Secondly, as we all know, the mlb sample size is pretty darn small. I thought, CES, Marte, McLain and Lodolo were all going to be special. With Lodolos injuries, I dont know that he has any decent trade value. The other 3 are question marks at best. No, this fiasco isnt on Matt or CES or Noelvi.

It is totally on Krall. We knew in March that McLain, Marte, and Friedl were potential longer term absences. Who were the replacements? About 5-10 Louisville guys, all of whom were unproductive failures. To be kind, maybe they werent ready. But again, that is on the GM for not realizing that. So, in April, May, and June, you just continue to roll on without bringing in adequate replacements for a team Krall himself said was going to compete. And so in July, you have Friedl and Marte back, Lodolo bouncing back and forth, and you are still a few games under 500. Basically, pretty good health for a team you stated that was going to compete. So how many better players do you add for the stretch run? None and even cast away a #4 starter (ahead of Spiers), innings eater type for a minor leaguer. Considering Lodolo’s and Abbott’s recent performances, this seemed risky and dangerous to a few of us. Now a month later, and 3 cheap waiver wire pickups (in lieu of the Louisville failures) and the offense maybe is slightly better but still remains glaringly weak. And the pitching which was totally ignored and unaddressed has become a disaster.

I would have thought there would have been a learning from 2023 and the neglect of deadline pitching help then and the resulting horrible last 2 months. But no, same old failed act. Can this be fixed? YES. Will it? I doubt it as I dont think anyone cares. Your 3 -5 starting pitchers are now “resting” and not getting any innings build up to last into September next year. Your offense is like 28th in mlb and needs 2-3 major pieces. Your defense is sorely lacking in LF, CF, 3B, 1B, and C. I am not presenting any new information. But I never thought this was a contending team coming out of spring training and the 3 injuries thereof. But I did think you would grab a big bat in May and maybe another in July to carry us through. Today, the 2025 team looks even worse than the 2024 team because I know we cant count on 150 innings from Lodolo, Ashcraft, Lowder, and Williamson. They only have 2/3rd of a year in them. You will probably have to also trade 1-2 of them for something more durable. What a mess. A young team that needs 2-3 higher octane offensive pieces and 1-2 more durable starting pitchers. And that certainly wont be enough if you have an injury or two in March or April.

Gusnwally 09/01/2024

I did not see the Marte on base blunder. But did see highlights of the game. So I was able to see Marte stand at home and admire his blast. Which was by the way caught on the warning track.

LDS 09/01/2024

Marte without his PEDs hasn’t been particularly impressive. Was he only taking them for recovery as stated? Who knows. But he was rushed back to the team before he was ready and that’s likely a contributing factor. Nonetheless, his manager should be correcting his mistakes as well as the rest of the teams. And since the same things happen from game to game and year to year, we can pretty much conclude that isn’t happening.

Harry Stoner 09/01/2024

That kind of speculation is ridiculous.

If you want to dive deep in cynicism, you can work harder and do better.

The steroids Marte tested positive for were related to speeding ‘healing’ of his injured leg.

He’s hitting poorly for the same reason a lot of Reds hitters are: poor pitch recognition and impatience at the plate.

You certainly know PEDS aren’t going to help him with that.

Why do you do this to yourself?

Rushed back? Certainly. See McLain, Friedl and likely Green.

Likely not getting help? See Benson, Maile, India.

No guidance from teammates? See EDLC, Espinal, India, Stephenson.

His stand and pose routine last night was not the worst of it.

It was looking into the dugout and smirking after the ball was caught.

This is funny?

Who was he playing to and was laughing along with him?

The sloppy play and attitude is tolerated from Bell and Krall, but it doesn’t have its source with them.

I’ve been thinking of the “EDLC Effect”.

He gets away with a lot and others think they can, too.

I wish he got on Marie’s axx about it, but we might see him do the same.

But, man, your PEDS speculation is pure nonsense.

And you know it.

LDS 09/01/2024

Cynicism? Nah, more like healthy skepticism. But, at the end of the day, it’s a management problem, pure and simple. Leaving aside Bell’s in game and lineup decisions, etc, that have been widely debated here, it is unquestionable that no one is held accountable for anything on this team. EDLC gets away with too much, no doubt. There are no grownups in the dugout yanking a knot in his rear end for his excesses. It’s one of the things that I was hoping to see from Candelario, but it’s not evident that it’s happening. Nor was it evident when Votto was around. At least, in none of these cases did any changes occur. So, start with replacing Bell and his coaching staff as some here have advocated for years. But we need to recognize that that will only mitigate the most visible symptoms of the deep maladies that afflict this organization. At this point, selling the team and moving it would be more acceptable to me than continuing this plague of mediocrity that is now measured in decades.

Harry Stoner 09/01/2024

Where you draw the line between skepticism and cynicism appears to be a pretty fluid and often self serving subtlety.

The team does bring that out in people.

Skeptical about management and ownership? Many of us share that.

Casting aspersions on a player’s performance and use of banned substances?

That’s not skepticism, or cynicism, but truly awful behavior.

Nothing ‘healthy’ about that.

You can’t gaslight it away.

I don’t think you’re going to get much argument from anyone here about the need for fundamental change, top to bottom.

Move the team to achieve that?

Switching from cynicism to idealistic skepticism?

More gaslighting?

More nonsense?

Maybe, but certainly ‘healthier’ than your baseless and small-minded attack on Marte, however couched in creepy ‘speculation’.

Stick to your

Still a red 09/01/2024

Well we really don’t know what or how the Mgr and coaches go over mistakes made or attitudes in need of adjustments. The fact that they continue to be made could indicate the youngsters aren’t getting correction OR they have been unable to internalize them. The fact that people aren’t seemingly being benched could be there really is no one to replace them with. If indeed the Reds lead the league in being thrown out on the bases then one has to figure out how to make them smarter without losing their speed advantage. Candy might have been the person to lean a bit on the youngsters but he is the newbie and not superstar enough to carry much weight. India? Sounds like he plays chess and home run derby with Elly. Maile? Maybe…perhaps more a cheerleader than a heavy.

LDS 09/01/2024

No Harry, the willingness to see the Reds relocated is predicated on an owner that is serious about winning. If that requires moving to Nashville or another new location, that’s a fair trade off for me. I don’t live in the Cincinnati viewing “fan” area any longer. I’m elsewhere already and a place like Nashville is no worse for me.

Mark 09/01/2024

Marte has been a disappointment but he is very young and who knows what his MLB ceiling is going to be.
The only way to find out is to keep throwing him out there.
That being said I wonder about his mental makeup.
Hoping he is not the million dollar body/nickel brain type of player.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

The Brewers 1B last night was briefly a Red in 2022 but was traded to NYY in May 2022.

Michael B. Green 09/01/2024

Feels like we’re playing for a lottery pick.

Mark Moore 09/01/2024

Tuned out early then tuned back in. The “oh so close” syndrome on this type of game is exhausting. Still missing on opportunities during the game and some sloppy play along the way. Got to Frankie a little late, but did get to him in the end.

Can we avoid a 4-game sweep? Going to be a challenge as Bernie is NOT going to run out a mere getawayday line-up. They have too much to play for.

Justin T 09/01/2024

@harry stoner

Marte is what, 22 years old? He needed PEDs to heal from an injury? Ok.

Now the following year he is struggling? Have you or anyone you know taken steroids? Do you understand how it makes a man feel everyday? You feel like a million bucks everyday and physically recovered. Its ridiculous to assume that didnt affect his performance if he was taking them last year.

Marte was taking Boldenone, which is an anabolic steroid and is used to aid performance and increase muscle mass. bodybuilders is Boldenone. To put it simply, he was juicing.

“In reality, it just appeared in my system. I really don’t know how it came about, unfortunately. That’s as far as I know,”- Noelvi Marte

Bill J 09/01/2024

To see Marte standing there on 3rd was either on him or House. On the long fly it was on him.
