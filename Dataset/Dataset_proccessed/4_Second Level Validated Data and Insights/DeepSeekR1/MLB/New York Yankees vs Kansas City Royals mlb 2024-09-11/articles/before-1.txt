Witt. Judge’s slugging and HR numbers are inflated in that ballpark. Witt is the more complete player.

I’m going to get crucified for this, but I would like to see Witt. I am a Jays fan, but I admit Judge is a once in a lifetime player. I can’t argue against Judge really, but I just like rooting for underdogs really.

Judge will win the MVP. I say this as an Orioles fan with no love whatsoever for the Yankees.

If judge goes homerless in September we have a race if BWJ can get back up to over 340

Bobby Witt having an MVP worthy season, but won’t even come close to Aaron Judge, who’s having a season for the ages.
