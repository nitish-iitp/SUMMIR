LOS ANGELES – 

Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani blasted the first postseason home run of his MLB career to help the Los Angeles Dodgers claim a 7-5 victory over the San Diego Padres in a thrilling playoff duel on Saturday.

Ohtani crushed a 372-foot (113-meter) three-run rocket into right field off Padres starter Dylan Cease in the second inning, emphatically throwing his bat in celebration as he helped the Dodgers tie it up at 3-3.

They had fallen 3-0 behind following a first-inning onslaught from the Padres' powerful lineup.

"The stadium was electric and I was just really able to enjoy the game today," said Ohtani, who is widely regarded as the best player in baseball.

"He's a good pitcher and it's not easy to get him, but I really wanted to make sure that I could hit one," added Ohtani, who had never played an MLB postseason game before Saturday.

With Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggling on the mound, the Padres regained the lead after Xander Bogaerts' two-run double in the third inning made it 5-3.

But Ohtani once again helped spark a Dodgers revival in the fourth inning.

Ohtani's single loaded the bases before Tommy Edman scored on a wild pitch to cut the deficit to 5-4. Teoscar Hernandez then drove in two runs with a single to right field to make it 6-5.

Dodgers catcher Will Smith scampered home on a fielder's choice to make it 7-5 in the fifth inning.

There was a nervous finale in the ninth inning as the Padres got two men on base.

But closer Blake Treinen struck out Manny Machado to clinch a win, which gives the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five National League Division Series.

Game 2 takes place in Los Angeles on Sunday. Yu Darvish will start for the Padres, while Jack Flaherty will get the call for the Dodgers.

Dodgers slugger Hernandez paid tribute to the inspirational Ohtani after the win.

"Shohei is Shohei — I don't think there's anybody playing like him right now," he said. "I'm just glad he's on our team."
