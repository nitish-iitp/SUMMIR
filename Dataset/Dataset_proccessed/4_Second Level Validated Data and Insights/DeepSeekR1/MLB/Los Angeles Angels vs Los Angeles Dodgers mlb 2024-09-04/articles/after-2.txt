Mookie Betts' three-run homer capped a four-run 10th inning and helped lift the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday night in Anaheim, California.

Two-time American League MVP Shohei Ohtani played his first regular-season game at Angel Stadium since leaving the Angels for the Dodgers in the offseason. He went 1-for-4 with one RBI, two runs and a walk.

In the top of the 10th, automatic runner Tommy Edman advanced to third on a groundout before scoring on Miguel Rojas' single to put the Dodgers up 3-2.

Kevin Kiermaier pinch-ran for Rojas and moved to second on a groundout. With first base open, Ohtani was intentionally walked, but Betts made the Angels pay with his three-run shot off right-hander Roansy Contreras (2-4).

Michael Kopech (5-8) came away with the win after pitching a 1-2-3 ninth.

The Dodgers (84-55) had only three hits through nine innings before putting together their 10th-inning rally. They fell into an early hole, as Logan O'Hoppe smacked a solo shot in the second to give the Angels a 1-0 lead.

Ohtani made sure that the Dodgers wasted little time erasing that deficit, tripling home Rojas in the top of the third. The Angels challenged the play, claiming the ball was lodged in between the wall and its padding in the right field corner, but the call stood.

Betts followed with a single to bring home Ohtani, making it 2-1.

Taylor Ward tied the game at 2-all with a solo home run in the fifth.

Neither starter factored into the decision, but both thrived. Walker Buehler gave up two runs on five hits in five innings for the Dodgers, walking two and striking out six. The Angels' Reid Detmers lasted six innings, allowing two runs and three hits. He walked two and fanned 10.

Angels reliever Ben Joyce struck out Edman on a 105.5 mph fastball in the ninth. It was the fastest strikeout pitch ever recorded in the pitch-tracking era, which began in 2008, and the third-fastest pitch overall in that span.

Betts and Freddie Freeman each finished with two hits for the Dodgers. Zach Neto had a pair of singles for the Angels (57-81).
