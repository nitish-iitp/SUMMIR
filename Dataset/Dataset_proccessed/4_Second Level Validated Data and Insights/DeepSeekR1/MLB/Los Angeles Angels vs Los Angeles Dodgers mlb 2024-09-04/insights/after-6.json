        "The Dodgers won 6-2 last night in 10 innings thanks in large part to a 3-run home run from Mookie Betts. Shohei Ohtani returned to Anaheim and laced an RBI triple in his 1st game back at Angel Stadium since departing as a free agent and signing with the Dodgers. Five Dodgers’ relievers each threw a perfect inning to close out the game"
