The weekend is a great time to kick back and reflect. This Week in Purple is the place to catch up on the news from our team at Purple Row. You’ll find links to Rockpiles and other content below as well as a platform for community discussion in the comments.

The summer is finally winding down, The weather is starting to cool down (at least in the mornings); the kids are back to school; and baseball season is entering its final month. The Colorado Rockies have 25 games left and need to go 12-13 to avoid a second-straight 100-loss season. However, they will face the Baltimore Orioles (78-58), Atlanta Braves (74-61), Milwaukee Brewers (79-56), Detroit Tigers (68-68), Chicago Cubs (69-66), Arizona Diamondbacks (76-59), St. Louis Cardinals (67-68) and Los Angeles Dodgers (81-54)... twice. The Rockies have gone 30-34 (.469) this season against teams with a record of .500 or better, so can they go (.480) to finish out the season?

But aside from that, here’s what our writers were up to this week:
