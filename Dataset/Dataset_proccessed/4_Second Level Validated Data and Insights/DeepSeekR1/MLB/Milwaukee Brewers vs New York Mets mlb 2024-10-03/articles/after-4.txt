The Mets are moving on to face the Phillies.

The Mets won a 4-2 thriller against the Brewers to advance to the NLDS. Pete Alonso hit a clutch three-run homer to give the Mets a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth inning, and then Starling Marte hit a single, scoring Jesse Winker for the insurance run.

Game 1 of the NLDS is on Saturday at 4:08 p.m. ET at Citizens Bank Park.

Francisco Lindor gave the Mets a reason to believe
By Joel Sherman

Francisco Lindor is a great player. 

Yeah, you might think it is obvious, but it just felt like the proper moment to reiterate it. Scream it, if you could. Get a darn skywriter in the air to punctuate it for all to see.

Francisco Lindor lets out a celebratory yell after the Mets' 4-2 NL Wild Card-clinching win over the Brewers on Oct. 3, 2024.

For much of Game 3, the Mets had Jose Quintana’s changeup and moxie and Lindor on both sides of the ball providing a mission statement to his genius. It is more than that when you have the serenity and temerity to do it all at this time of year.
