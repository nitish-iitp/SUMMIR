LOS ANGELES DODGERS
Max Muncy: Dodgers 'Were S--t' vs. Padres in Blowout Game 2 Loss in 2024 MLB Playoffs

Following a dramatic comeback victory over the San Diego Padres in Game 1 of the NLDS, the Los Angeles Dodgers came crashing down to earth with a 10-2 blowout loss in Game 2 on Sunday.

Veteran third baseman Max Muncy didn't mince words when assessing the Dodgers' performance, telling The Athletic's Fabian Ardaya plainly, "We were s--t."

Muncy was the lone bright spot in Sunday's game for the Dodgers, going 2-for-4 with a solo home run, the only player in the lineup with multiple hits.

However, this marked the second straight game in which Los Angeles faced a deficit of three runs or more, so there are concerns that the team is headed for another October letdown. Los Angeles has been eliminated from the postseason in the NLDS in each of the last two years despite winning 100 or more games in the regular season.

To make matters worse, veteran first baseman Freddie Freeman exited Sunday's game in the sixth inning due to discomfort in his ankle. Per Ardaya, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Freeman's status remains uncertain as the team prepares for Game 3 on Tuesday in San Diego.

Muncy added that he believes the uncharacteristic performance by the Dodgers in Game 2 was not indicative of the team's talent.

"That's not us as a group," Muncy said. "We've been good all year. We've come back from games before."
