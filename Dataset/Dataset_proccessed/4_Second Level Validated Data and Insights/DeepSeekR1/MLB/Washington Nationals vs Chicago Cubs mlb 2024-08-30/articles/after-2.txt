Pre-Gamin’: Cubs at Nationals (5:45 CT) – Lineups, Broadcast Info, Game Thread

CHICAGO CUBS

CUBS LINEUP — Thanks to an extreme (and late-game) comeback on Wednesday, the Cubs wound up sweeping the Pirates. And that despite facing Mitch Keller, Jared Jones, and Paul Skenes. They still have a LOT of work to do if they actually want to make a miracle run, but the Nationals are a theoretically easier opponent. And, hey, Shota Imanaga is on the mound tonight. Let’s make it four in a row.

Chicago Cubs Lineup:
Ian Happ, LF
Michael Busch, 1B
Seiya Suzuki, DH
Cody Bellinger, RF
Isaac Paredes, 3B
Nico Hoerner, 2B
Dansby Swanson, SS
Pete Crow-Armstrong, CF
Miguel Amaya, C

The Cubs lineup remains as stable as ever, with Miguel Amaya cycling back in for Christian Bethancourt, but no other changes.

Washington Nationals Lineup:
Dylan Crews, RF
James Wood, LF
Juan Yepez, DH
Andres Chaparro, 1B
Jose Tena, 3B
Ildemaro Vargas, 2B
CJ Abrams, SS
Keibert Ruiz, C
Jacob Young, CF
Pitching Matchup:

Chicago Cubs: Shota Imanaga, LHP

Since June 21, only two pitches in baseball have allowed more homers Shota Imanaga’s 15. That’s not good. Fortunately, one of those two pitchers is Jake Irvin, who’s starting for the Nationals tonight. So … expect some homers? Despite the longball, Imanaga has still been productive, especially his last two times out against the Blue Jays and Marlins (combined): 12.0 IP, 8H, 3ER, 3BB, 9K.

Washington Nationals: Jake Irvin, RHP

Overall, Jake Irvin has been pretty solid this season, with a 3.80 ERA and just a 6.0% walk rate over 27 starts. But he’s been trending in the wrong direction for a couple of months. After an outstanding 8.0 inning scoreless start against the Mets on the Fourth of July, Irvin has allowed 33 earned runs in 50.1 IP (5.90 ERA). His walk rate has remained low during that stretch, but the strikeouts have all but vanished (16.4%).

Broadcast Info:

Chicago Cubs (68-66) vs Washington Nationals (61-73) at 5:45 pm CT – Marquee Sports Network, 670 The Score
