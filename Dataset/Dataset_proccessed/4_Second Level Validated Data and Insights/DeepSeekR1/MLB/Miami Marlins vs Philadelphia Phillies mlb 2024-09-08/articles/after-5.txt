Miami Marlins vs Philadelphia Phillies Prediction

I usually don’t bet on pitchers making their big league debut, and Seth Johnson isn’t some prized prospect who is expected to light the world on fire right away. However, the Phillies are still the better team overall and the Marlins are still the Marlins. Also, Edward Cabrera has been underwhelming for much of his career up to this point, despite having solid stuff. The price is more than reasonable, and there’s a clear gap between the Phillies and Marlins. I’ll lay the price with the Phillies in game 4.
