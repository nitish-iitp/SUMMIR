Chisholm’s Walk-Off Hit Delivers Yankees Victory Over Royals In Extra Innings

Jazz Chisholm Jr.’s infield single in the 11th inning secured a thrilling 4-3 victory for the New York Yankees over the Kansas City Royals. Juan Soto’s go-ahead home run in the sixth extended the Yankees’ lead in the AL East to 1 1/2 games over Baltimore.

The Orioles’ loss to Boston in extra innings allowed the Yankees to maintain their advantage. Chisholm’s clutch hit came after Kris Bubic intentionally walked Aaron Judge, and with the infield playing in, Judge advanced to second on defensive indifference. Chisholm’s timely slap hit scored the winning run.

Luke Weaver earned the victory for the Yankees, while Michael Massey’s home run provided a brief lead for the Royals. The game featured a series of dramatic moments, including Soto’s home run, Salvador Perez’s impressive double play, and the Royals’ successful challenge of a safe call at first base.

The Yankees’ victory solidified their position in the AL East, while the Royals fell further behind Cleveland in the AL Central but maintained their hold on the second wild card spot.

After a day off on Thursday, the Kansas City Royals will begin a three-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Royals have not yet announced their starting pitcher for Friday’s game, while Luis L Ortiz is expected to take the mound for the Pirates.

The first pitch is scheduled for 5:40 PM central time. Due to Norton High School football coverage Friday, Royals Baseball coverage on SuperStar Country 102.5 & 1530 AM will resume on Saturday, with pregame starting at 11:30 AM and the first pitch at 12:05 PM.
