Washington Nationals vs Pittsburgh Pirates Prediction 

These two teams opened this series on Thursday night, but Friday was postponed, so we will have a doubleheader here. Both teams have struggled over the last two weeks, but Pittsburgh is close to being a .500 team at home. In game one of the doubleheader, I really like how Ortiz has pitched this season, so I am going to side with the Pirates. In game two, I don’t love either starting pitcher, but I am going to fade Keller. Back the Nationals in the second game.
