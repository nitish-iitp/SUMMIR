As much as he could, Billy Cook did justice to the spot he was assigned on the field.

With the numerals “2” and “1” etched into the right-field grass at PNC Park on Sunday afternoon in honor of “Clemente Day,” Cook provided a couple of moments “The Great One” made commonplace while winning 15 Gold Glove awards before landing in the Hall of Fame.

Cook prevented a run with a marvelous throw from right field and scored an unlikely one to push the Pirates to a 4-3 win against the Royals.

“It was awesome seeing the ‘21’ and I think even more special because it was just out in right field,” Cook said. “He played an amazing right field. And so just being able to play the game the right way out there as a tribute to him while wearing the number, really special.”

Just five games into his MLB career, Cook has already provided a number of impressive defensive plays, including one in the third inning of Sunday’s game. With the Pirates and Royals deadlocked in a 1-1 contest, Royals MVP candidate Bobby Witt Jr. lofted a deep fly ball to right field that traveled an estimated 265 feet, per Statcast.

Cook camped under the can of corn and unleashed a frozen rope of a throw home. Catcher Joey Bart snagged Cook’s one-hopper and tagged the Royals’ Tommy Pham in time, a play that stood after Kansas City’s unsuccessful challenge — and drew shades of Clemente.

“Sometimes, the angels watch over you, I guess, a little bit,” manager Derek Shelton said. “Really strong throw.”

A couple of innings later, Cook broke out of an 0 for 11 skid with a base knock, which was just his third as a big leaguer. During the middle of Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s ensuing at-bat, Cook broke for second on a hit-and-run and kept moving after the Pirates utilityman stroked a grounder up the gut.

Cook never slowed down, ultimately getting the green light from third-base coach Mike Rabelo before sliding safely at home in plenty of time.

“That’s a great send by Rabs. But he’s allowed to make the send because Billy never hesitates. He never breaks stride,” Shelton said. “We get a run on a ground ball to center field just because of the fact of his awareness. Outstanding.”

Cook’s hustle proved critical in a one-run game. But it was also another example of Cook staying true to himself at baseball’s highest level.

Growing up, Cook was told to play fast by his father, Chuck, and grandfather, Dan Adair, each of whom played Division I college baseball.

“It's always been the same advice from everybody — play the game hard, work hard and everything else will take care of itself,” Cook said. “And so that kind of 'always earned, never given’ — that was something that was said to me young.”

Albeit in a brief sample size, Cook has already shown what kind of MLB player he can be. For as many at-bats as he’s looked overmatched, Cook has answered the call in clutch moments while playing with an abundance of passion.

Should he string together more performances like Sunday’s, Cook could do himself a big favor when it comes to bolstering his case for a spot on the Pirates opening day roster next March.

“Every day, you don't know what's going to happen,” Cook said. “If you don't get a hit that day, how are you going to help the team win? That's something that I've tried to do coming up — just contribute. I've found that playing the game hard ever since a young age has given you the advantage.”

On the mound

Rookie Jared Jones made his fourth start since returning from the injured list and didn’t fare quite as well as when he struck out nine Nationals hitters over seven innings of two-run ball. Jones required 97 pitches, 61 of them strikes, to cover four frames for the Pirates before turning the ball over to reliever Carmen Mlodzinski.

"Stuff was terrible,” Jones said. “But got through four innings and the two runs, and we ended up winning the game. There's not too much I can really say bad about myself.”

Out of the gate, Jones looked excellent in throwing three pitches at least 100 mph and recording two strikeouts in the first inning. But the Royals made him work for his outs the rest of the way and tagged the 23-year-old for two earned runs and six hits.

“Even though it was only four innings, even though it was only five punchouts, he got out of two jams that didn’t allow runs to score that allowed us to stay in the game,” Shelton said. “I think that’s a growing moment for him, and that’s what I told him when he came out. He kept us in the game.”

Among the five relievers the Pirates used throughout the rest of the afternoon, only Colin Holderman gave up an earned run. Aroldis Chapman, meanwhile, locked down his ninth save of the season.

At the plate

It took all of two hitters for the Pirates to take their first lead of the game. Kiner-Falefa led off the bottom of the first with a single, and Bryan Reynolds drove him home to stay hot with a double to left.

Excluding Cook’s gallivanting around the basepaths, the Pirates scored two more runs. Nick Gonzales added an RBI groundout in the fourth, while Rowdy Tellez walked with the bases loaded in the fifth for what ended up being the winning run.

Injury report

In the top of the seventh inning, Oneil Cruz was replaced in center field by Michael A. Taylor. Shelton said Cruz experienced some left ankle discomfort after slipping in the outfield.

“Was able to run. He made a really good baserunning play later in the game, but it just stiffened up,” Shelton said of Cruz. “We see that happen at times, and it got to the point where it just stiffened up and he didn't think he could move as effectively as we'd want, so we just made the change.”

They said it

“We’re growing the awareness of Clemente. That’s what’s really important,” Shelton said. “Being nominated for the award is something that’s very special. Winning the award is the ultimate for a player that does things in our game that are different. It’s something that I do think a lot of guys take a lot of pride in.”
