The Dodgers beat the Yankees in five games to win the 2024 World Series, Here are five of the most incredible moments.

This live blog about the World Series Game 5 has ended.

What to Know
Aaron Judge and Jazz Chisholm Jr. hit back-to-back homers in the bottom of the first for a 3-0 lead, which increased to 4-0 in the second and 5-0 in the third.
A sloppy defensive showing by New York in the fifth inning gave the Dodgers their first scores, eventually tying the game.
A sacrifice fly from Giancarlo Stanton in the bottom of the sixth saw Juan Soto reach home for New York to take a 6-5 lead, but L.A. came back in the top of the eighth and didn't look back.
Star starter Walker Buehler entered in the ninth inning and retired the Yankees in order to close it out for L.A.
Yankees ace Gerrit Cole faced Dodgers righty Jack Flaherty, who was pulled in the second.
The Dodgers won their eighth World Series and first since 2020, while the Yankees' drought since 2009 persisted.

The New York Yankees avoided a sweep against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but couldn't force the series back to the opposite coast.

Los Angeles on Wednesday won the World Series with a 7-6 victory, coming back down 5-0 in the fifth inning after a disastrous defensive display from New York.

Despite a strong game on the mound from starter Gerrit Cole, the Yankees failed to keep pushing toward their 28th World Series title.

The Dodgers gave the nod to veteran righty Jack Flaherty, but he was pulled in the second inning as Dave Roberts shuffled between his bullpen again, eventually ending with star starter Walker Buehler closing it out.

Here's how the Game 5 matchup between the Dodgers and Yankees unfolded at Yankee Stadium:

The Yankees are the only MLB team to:

blow a 5+ run lead
allow 5+ unearned runs
commit 3+ errors
commit catcher's interference
commit a balk

...all in the same game, regular season or postseason (since earned runs became an official stat in both leagues in 1913).

By Mike Gavin

The Los Angeles Dodgers are three outs away from a World Series title.

Dave Roberts elected to leave Blake Treinen in with a one-run lead, two runners on and one out in the bottom of the eighth. And Treinen rewarded his manager by escaping the jam.

The Yankees threatened after Aaron Judge lined a one-out double down the left field line to put the tying run in scoring position. Jazz Chisholm Jr. then walked to put two on for Giancarlo Stanton, who swung at the first pitch and flew out to shallow right field. Treinen then struck out Anthony Rizzo swinging to end the inning.

Treinen has tossed 2 1/3 scoreless innings, throwing 42 pitches.

The Dodgers have chased 37.3% pitches out of the zone tonight.

By Sanjesh Singh

Gerrit Cole went 6 2/3 innings after a season-high 108 pitches before being removed from the top of the seventh with two outs, those being Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.

After a Freddie Freeman walk on a 4-1 count, Clay Holmes replaced Cole with Teoscar Hernandez at the plate. Hernandez walked after Holmes threw four straight balls, but he got Max Muncy to strike out looking to end the inning.

The Yankees lead 6-5 as their batters come up next.

Gerrit Cole exits game in top of seventh with two outs
By Sanjesh Singh

Gerrit Cole's night is done.

The Yankees starter forced a Shohei Ohtani ground out to shortstop to open the seventh before getting Mookie Betts to ground out to the mound.

After walking Freddie Freeman on a 4-1 count, Aaron Boone decided it was time to make the first pitching change of the game, bringing on Clay Holmes with Teoscar Hernandez due up.

Cole lasted 6 2/3 innings, recording six strikeouts and allowing four hits, four walks and five unearned runs, all coming in a disastrous top of the fifth full of defensive miscues.

New York led 6-5 at the time of Cole's exit.

Gerrit Cole returns in sixth and retires Dodgers in order
By Sanjesh Singh

After a disastrous fifth inning that kept Gerrit Cole on the mound much longer than he would've liked, the Yankees star returned for an improved sixth.

Cole opened the inning by forcing Tommy Edman to line out to center, then got Will Smith to strike out swinging. Gavin Lux then flew out to right on a 98 mph four-seam fastball on Cole's third pitch of the at-bat.

The game remained level at 5-5.

Yankees unable to regain lead, leave bases loaded in fifth
By Mike Gavin

The Yankees didn't score, but Gerrit Cole at least got somewhat of a rest.

Anthony Volpe managed a two-out single, Austin Wells was hit by a pitch by Alex Vesia, and Alex Verdugo walked to load the bases. That brought up Gleyber Torres, who flew out to right to end the inning.

Cole threw 38 pitches in the top of the inning after the Yankees committed two errors that led to five unearned runs and tied the score at 5-5. Cole, who has thrown 87 pitches, will come out for what is likely his final inning of work.

Yankees spiral in fifth, Dodgers tie game at 5-5
By Sanjesh Singh

The Yankees took their eyes off the prize and are now seeing the prize slip away.

After Aaron Judge failed to catch an easy pop fly in the top of the fifth, the Dodgers gradually loaded the bases with no outs as the Yankees kept making errors on routine plays.

Mookie Betts reached safely on a grounder to first after Cole failed to cover the bag, allowing Kike Hernandez to score. With the bases loaded, Freddie Freeman then hit a two-run single to cut the Dodgers' deficit to 5-3. Teoscar Hernandez followed with a game-tying double to deep center to cap a five-run inning for the Dodgers.

Yankees leave bases loaded in the second inning
By Mike Gavin

The Yankees tacked on another run in the second for a 4-0 lead, but missed a chance to do some additional damage and perhaps book an early flight back to Los Angeles.

Dodgers reliever Anthony Banda replaced Jack Flaherty with one on and one out. He struck out Gleyber Torres before issuing walks to Juan Soto and Aaron Judge to load the bases. Banda then got Jazz Chisholm Jr. to ground out to first to end the threat and prevent the Yankees from increasing their lead.

That gave the Yankees a 4-0 lead and knocked Dodgers starter Jack Flaherty out of the game.

Yankees redistribute ejected fans' tickets to cancer patient and family
By Sanjesh Singh

Following the Game 5 ban of two fans who ripped the ball out of Mookie Betts' hands in Game 4, the Yankees announced they are redistributing those tickets.

The tickets will instead go to a pediatric cancer patient and his family, the Yankees said ahead of the game.

Calvin Young, 15, is the cancer patient who is the recipient for the tickets. Young will attend the game with his mom and two younger brothers.

The two banned fans had tickets for Game 5 but had their money refunded.

The tickets used last night by the two ejected fans (plus others in that section) have been re-distributed to a pediatric cancer patient and his family, the Yankees said.

Has a team ever come back from being down 3-0 in the World Series?
By Mike Gavin

Yogi Berra once said, "It ain't over 'til it's over." But history says it's basically over.

The New York Yankees lost the first three games of the 2024 World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, facing a 3-0 deficit that no team in Fall Classic history has managed to overcome.

Sorry, Yogi, but the whole one-game-at-a-time mantra is yet to work in the World Series. Still, the Yankees are giving it their best shot, winning 11-4 in Game 4 on Tuesday to avoid a sweep.

No team has managed to come back from being down 3-0 in the World Series to win the championship, or even force a Game 6. Of the 24 teams that have taken a 3-0 lead in the World Series prior to this season, 21 completed the sweep in Game 4. Prior to the Yankees on Tuesday, the 1970 Cincinnati Reds were the last team to force a Game 5 after trailing 3-0 in the Fall Classic, before losing to the Baltimore Orioles.

Yankees fans who ripped the ball out of Mookie Betts' glove banned from Game 5
By Jon Lloyd

Two fans who were ejected at Yankee Stadium in a blatant and bizarre case of fan interference during Game 4 of the World Series won't be allowed to attend what could be the decisive game Wednesday night in New York.

The fans in the front row of seats along the right field foul line could be seen attempting to pry the baseball from the glove of Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts after he leaped near the wall and caught a fly ball in foul territory off the bat of New York's Gleyber Torres. One fan in a Yankees jersey could be seen trying to open Betts' glove as another wearing sunglasses grabbed the right-fielder's arm.

The unusual scene played out in the first inning with the Dodgers up 2-0 behind another Freddie Freeman home run and on the verge of a World Series sweep, but the Yankees stormed back to win 11-4.

The New York Yankees fans that ripped a ball out of Mookie Betts' glove and grabbed his arm during a play at the wall are banned from attending Game 5 of the World Series.
