 Make It Official! Twins 6, Angels 4: Twins Play and Win with the Urgency We Deserve

By Steven Trefz

September 12, 2024

On a Wednesday night in the middle of September, the Minnesota Twins approached the series finale against an inferior ballclub as if it were a playoff game. This sense of urgency and strategy not only won the day, but it might have saved the season. Here's how the victory unfolded.

Win Probability Chart (via FanGraphs)

Rookie Time!
The Twins relied on Pablo López to end yet another losing streak on Tuesday night, and they turned to rookie Zebby Matthews to help lead toward a goal that hadn't been accomplished in 10 days: winning back-to-back games! Matthews didn't give Twins fans much confidence right from the get-go, surrendering a leadoff home run to Angels slugger Taylor Ward. Two singles and a walk by Matthews loaded the bases with two outs, and the Angels were one swing away from putting the Twins in a hopelessly familiar place in the top of the first inning. However, Eric Wagaman came to the plate in only his second major-league at-bat, and flew out to end the threat.

Jack Kochanowicz took the mound opposite Matthews, and he, too, represented the rookie class of 2024, making his eighth career start. Kochanowicz survived an Edouard Julien rocket line out in his first at-bat of the game, but he didn't survive Matt Wallner in the second at-bat. Wallner evened the score at 1-1 with a 435-foot, 110.3-mph blast to center.

Playoff Tactics for the Twins?
Matthews and Kochanowicz both settled down through the second inning, but in the top of the third, Zebby was once again hurt by the long ball. This time, Nolan Schanuel took Matthews into the dock in right to put the Angels back up 2-1. This homer was the beginning of the end for Matthews, as his pitch count climbed into the 50s in the third inning, and Caleb Thielbar began to get ready in the bullpen. Rocco Baldelli appeared to approach this game before the off day almost like a playoff game. Short hooks for the pitchers, lineup configurations to stack the hottest (and coldest) batters, and other machinations often reserved for the season's most important contests.

Matthews survived the third, but he didn't make it out of the fourth inning, with Cole Sands coming in to put out a small fire. The Twins offense took advantage of Kochanowicz remaining in the game in the bottom of the fourth, with a leadoff single by Carlos Santana, another by Trevor Larnach, and a game-tying knock by previously slumping Willi Castro to knot the score at two apiece, breaking his personal 0-15 streak. Brooks Lee followed Castro by breaking his own 0-19 streak with a double to left, plating Larnach and Castro and putting the Twins ahead 4-2.

You Get to Pitch! YOU Get to Pitch!
Nobody in the Twins bullpen could rest easy tonight, with Thielbar and Jorge Alcalá handling the fifth inning. Alcalá remained in for the top of the sixth, but found rookie Jordyn Adams to be an unkind guest in the batters box. Adams took Alcalá deep to bring the Angels within one run at 4-3, and marked the seventh time in the last 17 appearances that Alcalá has surrendered a home run after going the first 32 appearances without giving one up. This doesn't bode well for the playoff push, but the Twins still left the inning with the lead.

Griffin Jax got the call for the seventh inning on an emotional night for he and his family. As the Twins honored those who died on Sept. 11, 2001, the evening featured a flyover by military aircraft--with Jax's brother and sister-in-law serving as two of the four pilots, and his other brother tossing the first pitch. Jax came in a bit too hyped and walked Zach Neto on four pitches. Four pitches later, a double-play and a strike out ended the threat. Christian Vázquez and a pitch-hitting Kyle Farmer gave the Twins an opportunity to extend the lead and to take some anxiety out of the closing frames with a single and double.

With a name like "Official," we know we have to be the best in the game every day, and from your first bite, you'll know that's a promise we make good on.

Following an intentional walk to Santana, grand slam man himself, Royce Lewis looked to break even further out of his 0-22 slump with another big hit. He drove a ball off the top of the wall in left field, and initially, it was called another grand slam. However, upon further review, the ball bounced back without hitting anything behind the wall. It went as a two-run double, extending the lead to 6-3 but not adding to Lewis's historic totals.

Can the Twins Close it Out?
The relative tension left after the lead stretched only to three, rather than five, meant that Jax came back out in the bottom of the eighth. Jax delivered again, 1-2-3, to send the game toward lights-out time. Jhoan Durán indeed came out to his usual fanfare, and unfortunately, Durán also came out with his more recent effectiveness. Two Angels reached on singles to start the inning, and with two out, Schanuel singled to pull Los Angeles within two runs and to bring the lead run up to the plate. Durán took out pinch-hitter Michael Stefanic with a dynamic curveball, and indeed the home crowd could celebrate two wins in a row, and a chance to make a little move up the Wild Card standings yet again.

What’s Next? 
The Twins get a day to rest and recuperate at home on Thursday, before engaging in a weekend home series against the Cincinnati Reds on Friday night. The Twins will send out RHP Bailey Ober (12-6, 3.77 ERA) in hopes that he can repeat his outing against the Royals last week albeit with better offensive support. Cincinnati has yet to announce their starter for their series finale in St. Louis on Thursday, let alone their starter for Friday. Either way, fans can count on a prepared and rallying Twins squad, and a Chris Young after-game concert to look forward to! First pitch is scheduled for 7:10pm CT.

Feels kind of crazy to say that Kyle Farmer has been one of the better hitters on the team in the last month. Since August 1st he has the best OPS on the team with a .946.

Pfft, a win you say?  That just means Rocco stayed home.    It's a little known fact that we're 78-0 when he's not in the dugout and 0-68 when he shows up to manage.

The hippie should just stay out there devouring people's pets or something.  

Don't worry, we'll get Rocco'd again soon by such terrible decisions as *checks notes* Pitching his closer.

I was really hoping for more from Zebbby against a pretty weak LAA lineup.  His fastball seems to only move one way (straight) and that wont play at the MLB level.

That is looking more and more true, unfortunately. Doesn’t he have a cutter? Maybe make that his bread and butter pitch & save the true four seam for special moments. 

As long as we win Pablo’s and Ober’s starts we should be good.

Matthews' fastball is MLB average. It breaks better than average in both horizontal and vertical axis', but the velo is average. Zebby Matthews' stuff is fine. He's going to need experience. He started the year in A+ ball.

Rocco "Quick Hook" Baldelli is back in best form.

As noted on the broadcast, Matthews appeared to be having a blister problem last night. That might have been part of his struggles last night as well as the early hook.

I'll take the series win: if the Twins get back to winning series down the stretch they'll be in the playoffs for sure, where they belong. Nice to see Royce bust out last night, although it's too bad he didn't convert the Grand Slam. Missed it by THAT much.

Keep grinding, boys!

Nice to take the series albeit a last place team.  It would take a monumental collapse for the Twins to miss the playoffs.  The question will be will they be ready.  Will their injured players be back AND be productive.  Good thing with Lopez and Ober being able to pitch the first two games of any playoff series.  But with only about two weeks left in the regular season it's time to play playoff type baseball.  It's time to streak into the playoffs with winning baseball.  

Regarding Trevor Plouffe blasting Rocco:  I'm not a fan of Rocco ball at all.  I regularly blast him here myself and probably will continue as needed.  However Plouffe blasting Baldelli for calling out his team in public as unprofessional is in itself unprofessional.  Stick to your broadcasting .

Actually, thought Rocco pulled most of the right levers last night: yanking Matthews early, leaving Jax in for the 8th, timing on pitch hitting Farmer for Julien.  Thought there was an opportunity to sacrifice bunt (or hit and run) with Lee at the plate, no outs, up by one, and runners on first and second. Lee was coming off a double in his previous AB, but that GIDP could’ve been huge turning point without Lewis’ double.

Bad luck and bad fielding. He is 23/25 in save opportunities. Look at that FIP!

Nice win , 2 in arow  ( seems like along time that has happened )...

It would be nice to have a good lead off hitter that gets on base so wallner doesn't hit so many solo homeruns  ...

Vazquez has been a better player this year and I'm sure everyone  is agreeable that he is worth his 10 million salary this year ....

Farmer is earning his paycheck lately , rather see farmer as a pinch hitter than Margot as he was activated before the game and sat on the bench where he belongs ...

Sands earns the win pitching 2/3rds of an inning , I thought he should of pitched another inning  , I guess with the off day today he gets alittle rest before he's called into a game with the reds ...

Mr grand slam gave it his all , his all wasn't quite enough ,  but a double was nice  , and 2 hits for the night too ...

Duran got the job done , but made it alittle stressful  once again ...

Twins win the series ...

You are 100% right sir.  Unfortunately, your take is fair, reasonable, and part of reality.  That's three strikes and you're out when Rocco is the topic!

In many games this year his struggles have been with him hanging curves to LH hitters ……..am curious. His fastball is intimidating so hitters choose to sit on his off speed because they have better chance of putting those 2 pitches in play. A 97 MPH splinker is devastating as well, only IF it moves down through the zone and isn’t thigh high.

I echo the comments regarding Duran.  He just does not look like his dominant (prior year's model) self.  Is the book out on him or what.  He seems to have a harder time getting his breaking ball over and they are for the most part laying off and sitting on his FB.  Even at 101 many ballplayers can smoke a FB if they know it's coming.  Just one poster's opinion!

This is slightly incorrect. He gave up a single to a lefty (Kavadas). Then a single to a righty (Adams). Then got back to back righties to strikeout (Ward and Neto). Then a single to a lefty (Schanuel). Then a groundout for a righty (Stefanic). And every ball in play was hit hard from both righties and lefties.

Hits came off a splitter to a lefty, fastball to a righty, and splitter to a lefty.

Groundout was on a curveball to a righty.

Threw 5 total fastballs in 22 pitches.

All 5 pitches to the lefties were splitters.

Every ball in play off him was hit 94.9 MPH or harder.

Thanks!

Does 5 fastballs in 22 pitches sound like a recipe for success for Duran? To me, which doesn’t mean much, it would seem 9-11 fastballs would be more prudent if he throws 22 pitches. His fastball should lead the AB’s and the other 2 pitches should work off the fastball. Pitching backwards and trying to fool hitters with breaking balls while having 99-102 in your pocket is mystifying.

Pitch mix to lefties - 5 splitters, only splitters. Do not get it at all.

On the radio broadcast they mentioned that Zebby's movement pitches and his fastball all break away from RHB. He doesn't have much he can use on the inner half of the plate.

Yeah, I'd like to know what their data is saying about things. Maybe those lefties happen to all really struggle against splitters? That'd be my best hope for that kind of decision. 

His fastball usage has gone from 49.6% in 2022, to 45.1% in 2023, to 41% this year. 

Curve has gone from 31.4% to 27.7% to 27.4%.

Split has gone from 16% to 27.1% to 31.6%.

He's getting very few swings and misses on his split (18.9%). But his other 2 pitches are pretty close to his previous seasons. His exit velo against all 3 pitches are at all time lows outside of his curve having been lower in 2022. Really weird season for him. 

His batted ball data is still elite. Highest weak contact rate of his career. Lowest barrel %. Lowest chase rate of his career, though. And they're hitting it more when they chase. Tipping pitches maybe? Lowest swing%, chase%, and whiff% feel like guys are awfully comfortable in the box against a guy with his stuff. His chase rate is in the 30th percentile after having been in the 98th in 2022 and 67th last year. He's not fooling anyone.
