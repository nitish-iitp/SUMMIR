Reds' Graham Ashcraft: Ruled out for rest of season
Reds' Graham Ashcraft: Ruled out for rest of season

Reds manager David Bell said Tuesday that Ashcraft (elbow) has resumed throwing but is unlikely to return this season, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.

Ashcraft has missed nearly two months of action with a right elbow strain and is simply going to run out of time to get ramped back up. The good news is that he should be able to have a normal offseason if he keeps progressing.

Sounds like they aren't going to try to get him to be a reliever. If they wanted him as a reliever they could get him enough rehab to come back in September sometime. To come back as a starter there isn't enough time to stretch him out for 5-6 inning starts.

He's a minor leaguer anyway at this point. Not really a guy I'd want making big league starts until he's had a fairly strong run of 10 or so starts at AAA.
All my posts are my opinion - just like yours are. If I forget to state it and you're too dense to see the obvious, look here!

He'll be passed by for the available MLB starter spots soon. Time to move him to the bull pen if you want him in MLB.

He was in MLB and was sent to AAA because he was getting hammered. He needs to prove it in AAA whether it's rotation or bullpen IMO.

Ashcraft has had some good MLB stretches, but he’s inconsistent and now injured. They’ll look at him in ST and then figure out what to do with him. I doubt there’s any grand plan for him other than get him healthy and see how he looks. Sometimes you just have to wait and see how the guy looks.

Keep him as a starter in AAA for when the Reds lose 3 or 4 starters in August 2025-2030.

I remember one time going out to the mound to talk with Bob Gibson. He told me to get back behind the batter, that the only thing I knew about pitching was that it was hard to hit.

There may not be any grand plan for him but there should be, IMO. He's been in the Reds system since 2019 and is now going into year 4 and his age 27 season. Not sure what else there is for the organization to learn about him. If you're stretching him out to be a starter, then he's battling for a roster spot. If he's a reliever, he's almost certainly better than the 12th or 13th AAA shuttle pitchers.

FWIW, his career ERA in the 1st inning is 2.85.

Re: Reds' Graham Ashcraft: Ruled out for rest of season
A starting rotation in the 21st century isn't just 5 pitchers deep...it's 9-10 pitchers deep. Right now, the entire opening day rotation is on the IL (other than one traded away). An addional guy who was projected to make starts (Williamson) has yet to appear in a game.

The problem is that the Reds often open the year with multiple question marks in the top 5 spots, let alone in spots 6-9. This year they did a better job at building in some redunecy, and it resulted in much-improved results. Yet it's August and they are struggling to fill innings and starts.

Ashcraft is a question mark, but a good guy to have somewhere in the 6-9 slots. As long as he opens there and not on the opening day roster, it would be fine to have him in the org.

They still need to acquire one more MLB guy, though, as there will always be injuries and ineffectiveness. That would leave the 5th spot to the top-prospects/AAAA guys to battle for.

Ashcraft pitched a scoreless inning last night in the Louisville game with Indianapolis...


.... Braxton Ashcraft that is.... for Indianapolis. I had to do a double take at the box score.
