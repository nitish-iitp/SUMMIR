        "The Astros are favored at -175 after their Game 1 loss, with the Tigers as +145 underdogs. The total is set at 7.5, reflecting the expectation of a low-scoring game.",
        "Hunter Brown, the Astros’ right-hander, will take the mound in Game 2. Brown had an outstanding regular season, finishing with a 14-7 record, a 3.38 ERA, and a 1.17 WHIP over 189 innings. He racked up 204 strikeouts while allowing just 52 walks. His fastball, which regularly hits the upper 90s, combined with a sharp curveball, has made him one of the most effective pitchers in the AL."
