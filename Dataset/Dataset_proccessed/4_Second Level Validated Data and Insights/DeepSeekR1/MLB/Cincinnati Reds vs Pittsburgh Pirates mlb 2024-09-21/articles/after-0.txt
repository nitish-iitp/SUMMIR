Elly De La Cruz had three hits with four RBIs and scored twice to help the Cincinnati Reds take a 7-1 win and the series against the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday.

The Reds (76-80), who won the opener of the three-game set on Friday, have won five of their past eight games. Cincinnati starting pitcher Rhett Lowder (2-2) held Pittsburgh scoreless on five hits through five innings.

Billy Cook had a home run among his two hits for the Pirates (72-83), who have lost seven of nine.

Up 3-0 after three innings, the Reds took advantage of Pittsburgh starter Jared Jones (6-8) in the fourth. With Will Benson and Jonathan India on and two out, De La Cruz connected on a slider for his 25th homer to right field for a 6-0 lead.

Jones gave up six runs on six hits while striking out five in five innings.

De La Cruz collected another RBI in the sixth off reliever Jalen Beeks when he knocked a two-out single to drive in Noelvi Marte for a 4-0 lead.

In the ninth, Cook hit a leadoff home run for the Pirates to left-center field against reliever Alan Busenitz.

The Pirates had just five baserunners through the first four innings before threatening in the fifth. Isiah Kiner-Falefa singled with one out and Oneil Cruz drew a two-out walk, prompting a visit from pitching coach Derek Johnson. Nick Gonzales followed with a single to load the bases, but Lowder got Bryan De La Cruz to fly out.

After getting the Reds out in order in the first, Jones gave up two walks in the second. Cincinnati broke through in the third.

De La Cruz doubled with two outs and scored when Stephenson knocked a line-drive single to right field to give the Reds a 1-0 lead. Ty France followed with his 13 th home run of the season, belting a curveball 426 feet over the wall in center to make it 3-0.
