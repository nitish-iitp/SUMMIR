Arizona Diamondbacks vs Houston Astros Prediction 

Houston was able to bounce back after getting swept by the Reds in their last series with a shutout win in game one on Friday, and they will go for two in a row here. The Astros are 40-29 at home this season, while the Diamondbacks are 40-32 on the road. Arizona is the highest-scoring team in the MLB this year, but they failed to score a run in game one. Kikuchi has pitched very well since coming over to Houston, but I think he is going to have some issues against this lineup. I don’t love Rodriguez on the mound for Arizona, but I will gladly take the highest-scoring team in the MLB at this price.
