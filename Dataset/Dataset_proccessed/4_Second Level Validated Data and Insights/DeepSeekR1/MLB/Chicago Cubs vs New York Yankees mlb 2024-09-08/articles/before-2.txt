The New York Yankees have designated right-handers Phil Bickford and Nick Burdi for assignment ahead of their 2-0 win against the Chicago Cubs. These moves were made as part of the team’s late-season roster adjustments.

What happened
SNY

Bickford, designated for assignment for the second time in three months, previously cleared waivers and chose free agency before re-signing with the Yankees. His latest stint in the majors included a rough outing against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 29, where he allowed five earned runs in two-thirds of an inning. Despite his struggles at the major league level, Bickford has been more consistent in Triple-A, recording a 3.00 ERA across 45 innings for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

Burdi has also dealt with an injury-plagued season, with recurring hip issues limiting him to just 9 2/3 innings in the majors and 13 1/3 innings in Triple-A. Injuries have been a constant throughout Burdi’s career, which includes two Tommy John surgeries and thoracic outlet syndrome surgery. Despite his strong strikeout ability, his potential has often been overshadowed by these health setbacks.

Both pitchers now face the possibility of clearing waivers. If unclaimed, they can reject an outright assignment to Triple-A and opt for free agency due to previous outright designations. A return to the Yankees on a minor league deal remains a possibility, as seen with Bickford earlier this season.

As the Yankees continue their push toward the playoffs, these roster moves highlight the club’s efforts to maintain flexibility and pitching depth.
