Seiya Suzuki returned to the lineup for the Cubs’ 3-0 victory Saturday against the Reds and picked up right where he left off, going 2-for-2 with two walks. A sprained right ankle had sidelined him for two games.

Suzuki (.283, 21 home runs, 73 RBI) essentially has replicated his production from 2023 in a season in which offense is down MLB-wide. And, again, he’s finishing on an especially high note. He entered Saturday hitting .330 with a .976 OPS in the last five weeks, putting him in the top 10 among qualified hitters in both categories.

Manager Craig Counsell praised Suzuki for his all-around offensive season and lamented the oblique strain that sidelined him for 3½ weeks in April and May.
