Thank you!

That concludes a memorable 2024 baseball season! It doesn’t seem that long ago that teams broke camp, and suddenly, it’s all over and winter awaits! And the best team won, that’s for sure, in five games no less: just like I said (sneaking that in there).

And that’s it for our live World Series coverage. As always, it’s been a pleasure bringing the Fall Classic to you, wherever you are. So thank you for following along with us! And having said all of that, good morning, good afternoon and good night!

Trophy time!

On the wheeled in stage, the owner of the Dodgers, Stan Kasten, gets a taste of the hardware, before the President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman says a few words. Now manager Dave Roberts says “this trophy belongs to everybody”, which isn’t true but a very nice sentiment. And I accept!

“Oh my! World Champions!” – Dave Roberts

Oh, and Freeman formally is awarded the Willie Mays MVP award.

“This is everything…this is it right here. Not this, that one!”

-Freddie Freeman, who drove in 12 runs this series, distinguishing between the MVP trophy and the World Series trophy.

New York, New York

If you grew up in a house with a Brooklyn Dodgers fan like I did, you understand the significance of a Dodgers team winning a title inside the five boroughs. Baseball’s bible-esque super story of the Yankees, Dodgers, Giants and Mets is central to the sport and lives on as the team from Flatbush celebrate a title in LA.

How it ended

THE DODGERS ARE WORLD CHAMPIONS pic.twitter.com/uWS6QYfZao

— Barstool Baseball (@StoolBaseball) October 31, 2024

From Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the Dodgers are champions for an eighth time in franchise history. And it’s the fourth time they have beaten New York in doing so.

Can you believe it?

We were in the fifth inning and wondering how Roberts would manage the Dodgers staff to make sure they were fresh for a Game 6 in LA. But there isn’t going to be a Game 6 because the Dodgers have completed the biggest comeback in a World Series clinching victory. And because the Yankees completely fell apart, committing mental error after mental error in a ghastly performance that showed exactly what they are, which is a team that wasn’t true World Series caliber.

But never mind that – LA celebrate a non-shortened season title for the first time since 1988. Yes, they have a loaded roster, but they’re an extraordinary club who deserve to be champs. And also, manager Dave Roberts has come a very long way – he was tremendous pulling the strings for the Dodgers in this series.

Volpe grounds to third – Muncy makes the play, fires to first, in time to get the first out of this inning! Two to go for LA, and here is Austin Wells!

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th

Now Buehler, a beautiful pitcher who has been destroyed by injuries, was having an awful year before finding his old self against the Mets in the NLCS. But this is a very different situation and a very tall order.

Volpe is at the plate.

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th

Leiter gets Smith to ground out to Chisholm who makes a spin-o-rama play at third before making the throw. That’s one heck of a play from a guy who never played the hot corner until recently. Great work.

That said, the Dodgers take the field three outs from a World Series title! And here comes Walker Buehler, a starter, who pitched two days ago, to try and pitch LA into the history books!

Edman waves at a curveball – strike three! A huge out by Leiter! Can he get out of this jam? Will Smith is next! Two down.

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th

The Yankees have committed three errors tonight and that doesn’t even come close to telling the story of the shoddiest play I’ve ever seen from a World Series team.

Edman is even in the count 2-2.

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th

Hernandez walks because Weaver is completely done, as everyone on the planet and Pluto knows.

First and second, one out, Edman coming up, Mark Leiter Jr coming in.

And nothing against Mark Leiter Jr, but I wouldn’t want the season on his shoulders.

That said, hey, you never know, right?

Share
31 Oct 2024
23.37 EDT

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th

Weaver throws over to first base for a third time, and he’s not allowed to do that!

That’s a balk! More mental mistakes for the Yankees! Good lord is this real?

So that insurance run is now in scoring position for Hernandez.

Muncy smokes a ball to right but Soto is there for the first out. Here’s Kike Hernandez with one out and one on.

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th

Hernandez starts off the Dodger ninth with a base hit to left off Weaver! And Weaver must be exhausted, but really, NY have no one left of consequence.

Chris Taylor runs for Hernandez.

If…

…LA win this game it will be because the Yankees threw it away with both hands. And because Treinen and his manager have some serious stones.

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th

Rizzo chases a breaking ball in the dirt! And what an absolutely epic performance by Blake Treinen! He throws 40 plus high stress pitches, allowing no runs in 2.1 innings, striking out three to get LA within three outs of an eighth World Series title!

Stanton pops the first pitch he sees into foul grond ion the right side! Betts is there – he makes the catch! Two down!

It’s up to Rizzo in the Yankees eighth! Roberts is sticking with Treinen. It’s big boy time!

23.26 EDT

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th

Ball four almost hits Chisholm. Two on, one out for Stanton.

Roberts is coming to the mound. Treinen has to be gassed, but LA’s skipper is going to stick with him!

I think that’s a mistake. He looks done to me.

Burt we’ll find out who is right soon!

Here we go!

Judge cracks a double down the left field line! Muncy came very close to catching that ball at third base – wow!

Treinen is over 30 pitches. Ouch!

Chisholm at the plate.

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th

OK, so it’s actually Soto leading off, facing Treinen, who has 21 pitches facing some very big bats.

And Soto grounds to first: Freeman has it and tosses to Treinen. One out.

Here’s Judge in the biggest at-bat of his career.

31 Oct 2024
23.17 EDT

Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 8th

Freeman chases a pitch low and away – strike three! So the Yankees get a crucial out and end the inning to stay in touch. It’s still a disaster for new York, who surrender two runs and the lead thanks to a broken bat hit and an interference call of all things. What a mess!

The good news for NY? Soto is leading off.

RUN! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 8th

The call is confirmed! Now Betts comes to the plate!

He skies the very first ball to centerfield and that also is going to be deep enough! Two straight sacrifice flies give LA a late lead!

Can you believe this?

RUN! Dodgers 6-6 Yankees, top 8th

Lux hits a fly ball to center – it’s deep enough to score the tying run! LA have leveled in the eighth!

And now it’s runners at the corners, and it’s guess who – Ohtani!

But wait, hang on! The umpire is calling catchers interference on the first pitch! That puts Ohtani at first! Are you kidding me?!

NY are going to challenge this, but if it stands, its a total disaster for NY.

Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th

OK, Boone comes to get Kahnle, which was a bad selection to begin with. Luke Weaver will come in for the third straight game to do some heavy, heavy lifting. The good news for New York fans? Weaver may be crazy enough to not give a damn about the situation he’s just been dropped in.

Rizzo creeps in at first base for a bunt that’s not going to happen. No idea what he is thinkng. But it’s 3-1!

And now it’s ball four!

Bases loaded, nobody out!

If Boone doesn’t get Kahnle now he’s crazy.

And Hernandez singles to left! Yup! The changeup thing against the Dodgers? I’m a skeptic.

See what I’m saying?

Will Smith is up, and again, he is due!!
