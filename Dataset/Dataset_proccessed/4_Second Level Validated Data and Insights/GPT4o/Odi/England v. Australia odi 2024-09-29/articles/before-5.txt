ENG vs AUS, 4th ODI LIVE: England captain Harry Brook struck his first one-day international century before his team clinched a 46-run win by the DLS method to keep alive the series against Australia on Tuesday.

Chasing 305 to win the third ODI, England was 254-4 — with Brook unbeaten on 110 — when heavy rain arrived in the day-nighter at Chester-le-Street. The teams didn’t get back on the field and England was well ahead of the run-rate.

Australia, which had cruised to dominant wins at Southampton and Leeds in this five-match series, saw its lead trimmed to 2-1 and its 14-match winning run in ODIs come to an end. During that streak, the team won the Cricket World Cup in India last year.

Coming to the crease with England in trouble on 11-2, Brook took on Australia’s seam attack by hitting 13 fours and two sixes in a 94-ball knock to easily surpass his previous ODI-best score of 80.

“I’m relieved, for sure. It’s just nice to see some rewards,” said Brook, who gained his first win as stand-in skipper for the injured Jos Buttler. “I’m just glad I managed to play the way I wanted to. It’s nice to get that first hundred on the board and hopefully there’s plenty more to come.

“I feel like I’ve been a little bit stop-start this summer. I’ve had a lot of starts — 30s and 40s — and then not managed to convert, which is frustrating. To do that today, I feel like I’m back in a good place.”

The series continues on Friday with the fourth ODI at Lord’s.

Playing without explosive opener Travis Head (rested) and star spinner Adam Zampa (ill), Australia was put into bat and needed a strong finish — mainly thanks to Alex Carey’s unbeaten 77 and No. 8 batter Aaron Hardie’s 44 off 26 — to post 304-7 off its 50 overs.

Steve Smith hit a patient 60 off 82 balls, after the tourists’ innings was slowed by losing Cameron Green (42) and Marnus Labuschagne (0) in space of five balls just past the halfway mark.

It looked a tough chase for a youthful England team that had been outclassed so far this series and things started badly when Mitchell Starc dismissed Phil Salt (for an eight-ball duck) and Ben Duckett (8) in the same over — Australia’s third.

Brook embraced the pressure of the occasion and went on the attack pretty much from the start of his innings.

His third-wicket stand of 156 with Will Jacks (84 off 82 balls) swung the momentum England’s way and the team maintained it when the big-hitting Liam Livingstone came in at No. 6 and immediately smashed two sixes.

Brook used the uppercut to great effect to deal with some short-pitched bowling from the Australians and hit a straight drive for four to get to 99. Off the next ball, he opened the face and edged for another four to reach his century, prompting him to remove his helmet and look to the sky.

Brook’s second fifty came off just 33 deliveries.

England’s push for victory was then held up by the rain that arrived in the 38th over. It got heavier and heavier, with the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern formula showing that the hosts were well in front of the run-rate.

So, on a cold afternoon which turned into a freezing evening, England maintain their recent winning run at Lord’s and are a win away from making this a near-perfect summer. With series wins over West Indies and Sri Lanka and just three losses to Australia in 6 white-ball games, the hosts would be keen to have the final say about who is bossing the game, come Sunday, 29th September, 2024, when the 5th and final ODI and also, the final game of England’s summer of 2024 will be played. There is a lot of talk about bad weather in Bristol for Sunday but why talk about something which has not happened yet? Weather forecasts keep changing and let’s hope for the same come Sunday. Australia would be equally desperate to win the ego battle and remember, they are about to enter into a summer of their own, filled with challenges and they would want to get there with confidence. If everything is fine, the first ball should be balled at 10 am GMT, but irrespective, we shall be in early in advance. So do tune in early and enjoy your Sunday along with us. Until then, you can catch the action from the Sri Lanka-New Zealand Test series, Ireland-South Africa series and also the India-Bangladesh series. ADIOS! TAKE CARE!

Victorious England captain, HARRY BROOK, asserts that even though England did not win the first two games, they took a lot of positives from those and then a lot of momentum came from the third ODI. On Ben Duckett, Brook says that he is a special player and as long as he is there in the middle, the score keeps ticking. On the batting approach, Harry says that the plan was to basically target the boundary early in the over, to put pressure on the bowler. Praises his seamers for bowling consistently and not giving anything loose. Is happy to see Jofra Archer back at his best. Does not want to think too much about his own form and only wants to focus on winning the series in Bristol in the final match.

Australia’s captain, MITCHELL MARSH, admits that Australia were a bit off the radar in this game. Details that England did not give them early wickets while batting and then, totally outplayed his team. Is at a loss of words when asked about how to best approach a target of 312 in 39 overs and ends up saying that Australia tried to come out hard but just kept losing wickets and that’s cricket. Is eager to put this loss behind and come out charging afresh, for the decider on Sunday.

… THE PRESENTATION …

Earlier in the day, Australia started really well after winning the toss, restricting England to 35/0 at the end of 8 overs in a truncated match. However, what followed next was total massacre as the next 31 overs went for 277 runs. Barring Will Jacks and Phil Salt, everyone had a go at the Aussie bowlers, scoring runs at will. Skipper Harry Brook (87) and Ben Duckett (63) scored half centuries while Liam Livingstone’s 25-ball half century towards the end, with 7 sixes, was the icing on the cake. It was a forgettable game for Australia overall but this onslaught on their ‘experienced’ bowlers by an ‘inexperienced’ batting unit is something they will not be able to digest. Please stay tuned for the presentation…

Australia came out swinging, as expected, chasing a mammoth target of 313 in 39 overs. Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh got them off to a rollicking start, raising 68 in just 51 balls before the 52nd ball spelt doom for Head and Australia. It was just a wicket but that just opened the floodgates. England bowlers started hitting the right lengths and all of a sudden, the visitors were like cats in front of a car’s headlights. From 68/0, Australia slipped to 96/6 – losing 6/28 in 43 balls. It was not any uncanny shot making but pure delight to watch the ball swing around like a hoop. And as it would be, only Head and Marsh crossed 20, with only two others reaching double figures.

Another irony is that when this series began, it was a clash between England’s inexperience against Australia’s experience. The hosts did not have too much to talk about in terms of their bowling ahead of this series, which was seen under pressure in all the previous matches. But in this one, in their second back-to-back do-or-die game, pace and swing did it for them. Yes, they had a massive cushion of 312 runs in 39 overs to defend but under lights, that pitch at Lord’s became like a nightmare for the Aussies.

Complete annihilation. That is the best way to describe England’s victory over Australia in this game. After winning 14 ODIs on the bounce after their loss to South Africa in the 2023 World Cup, Australia have now lost two on the bounce. Ironically, they won the first two games with a depleted side and when they got to their full strength, they have been beaten and beaten badly.

24.2 – 3 WIDES. Massive turn but misdirected. Rashid bowls it too full down the leg side, Starc looks to sweep but misses. Initially, Starc says wait but then, when he sees that the ball has gone far, starts to run and completes a couple.

24.1 – A full toss, around middle, Mitchell Starc whips it through mid-wicket and oh wow – does not take the single. He does want to take on the leggie. If there is anything in his slot, watch out for that slog sweep over mid-wicket.
