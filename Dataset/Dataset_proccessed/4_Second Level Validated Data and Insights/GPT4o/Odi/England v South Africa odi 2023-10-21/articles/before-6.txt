Preview

England will be going up against South Africa in the 20th match of the ODI World Cup at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. In their previous encounter of the flagship tournament, the Three Lions were defeated for the first time ever by Afghanistan, while the Proteas lost to the Netherlands a couple of days later too. Hence, England are currently under pressure in the ODI World Cup 2023, with more losses than wins thus far, which is why they desperately need to get the better of South Africa on October 21.

Pitch Report

England versus South Africa is going to be the first match of the ODI World Cup 2023 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, which puts us in the unknown in regards to how the pitches might play. Although the average first-inning score at this venue in ODIs is 245, the expectation of a total in the range of 280-300 is definitely not out of the question in the upcoming encounter between the Three Lions and the Proteas.

Team Analysis

England

England's batting lineup is going to be bolstered immensely by the return of Ben Stokes, after they capitulated against the spin trio of Afghanistan, except for a fine fifty from Harry Brook. The bowling attack of England had Adil Rashid pick up a bag of wickets against Afghanistan, which is a positive sign for them leading up to their upcoming matches in the ODI World Cup 2023, while the fast bowlers like Mark Wood and Reece Topley worked well as a pair in the initial stages too.

SportsTiger Playing XI of England

Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (c)/(wk), Liam Livingstone, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece Topley

South Africa

South Africa’s batting lineup was neutralised by the highly impressive Netherlands outfit, who had their strategies and execution in complete order during their ODI World Cup 2023 match, despite the enterprising starts from Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller. The bowlers for South Africa did start the proceedings on a bright note, but they were smashed all over the field by the Netherlands batters, putting up a par total on the board in a rain-curtailed match.

SportsTiger Playing XI of South Africa

Quinton de Kock (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Lungi Ngidi, Tabraiz Shamsi

Match Prediction

Conclusion

England will have a slight advantage over South Africa in their upcoming ODI World Cup 2023 match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, owing to a higher number of all-rounders in their probable playing XI.
