'Everybody wants to take responsibility'

India captain Rohit Sharma: "Honestly, since we started the tournament it was always about taking one game at a time and playing that game well.

"11 games in all if you go all the way, that's a lot of games. It's important for us to break it down and focus on one game and play it well.

"That's what everyone did. You play in different conditions, you've got to adapt and that's what we did.

"We're very pleased with how we played in these nine games. We've been very clinical from game one until today. That's because different individuals have stepped up at different points.

"This is a good sign for a team when everybody wants to take the responsibility and get the job done."

Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards: "I think we played two really good games of cricket in the tournament and gave ourselves opportunities in other games. It's tricky to say where we were compared to where we wanted to be.

"We are pretty confident with the style we play. We knew it was going to be a tough tournament. We have a lot to get better at ahead of the T20 World Cup next year.

"I think India showed pure class with the bat, I thought we bowled well in periods. They soaked up the pressure. They are going to be a hard side to beat in the rest of the tournament. As for ourselves, we are a young side still and it's about growth for us."

This is an India team which looks comfortable in their own skin. They have progressed easily and now it's a question if they can put two games together at the highest intensity.

Player of the Match Shreyas Iyer: "It was a bit like deja vu when I was getting nearer to the century, because when I got close against Australia I threw my wicket away so I wanted to kick on.

"I hurt my arm on 95 so I had to settle down and take a bit more time.

"My last few innings have given me a lot of confidence. It wasn't an easy wicket to start on so I knew I had to make the most of getting a good start."

India were always favourites going in to this encounter and it felt ominous when they won the toss and chose to bat first.

Openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill both passed 50 in fine style but it then became the Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul show.

Both smashed magnificent centuries as India racked up a massive 410-4 from their 50 overs.

Shreyas is named player of the match for his sensational 128 from 94 balls.

The result was never in doubt after India won the toss. A dominant display and they are in the best position going into the semi-finals.

India were clinical. New Zealand will have nothing to lose in the semi-final and must approach it in that way.

Teja Nidamanuru deserves that fifty. That filth from Rohit Sharma deserved to be hit for six.

Well, Teja Nidamanuru doesn't like this move.

He responds by smashing his sixth six, and moves to a wonderfully entertaining half-century in the process, from just 38 balls.

Winning brings fun but the most successful teams are those who are relaxed and enjoying themselves as well. This India team have that.

A decent effort from number 11 Paul van Meekeren to dig out a Jasprit Bumrah yorker and somehow clip it for four.

The way Bumrah's bowling, it's a decent effort to get any bat on it at all, really.

Just a slower ball from Jasprit Bumrah and it knocks out Aryan Dutt's middle stump. The Netherlands batter is done for a lack of pace more than the pace on it. Bumrah has a big smile on his face.

Just too good. What a bowler.

He got his last wicket with pure pace but Bumrah shows his skill and guile with a canny slower ball that completely baffles Aryan Dutt.

He swings across the line, is way too early on it and loses his middle stump.

India are one wicket away.

Teja Nidamanuru launches Jadeja down the ground for another six, the only way he seems to know how to score his runs at the moment!

And speaking of sixes, Roelof van der Merwe treated us to a couple in his cameo of 16 earlier.
