Nine games, nine wins!

A convincing India victory that sends them 9-0 in the league stage. Absolutely dominant through the last five weeks, and their batters are in pristine form. Bengaluru is always a tough place for bowlers and today they were good (if not great), and without pushing themselves too much, finish with a 160-run win.

Up next stands New Zealand in their way in a rematch of the 2019 semi-final. The team will switch back on for the seriousness of that fixture after a few light moments today that included bowling spells for Kohli, Gill and SKY to keep the crowd entertained.

For Netherlands, the end of a chapter that was very promising. They very nearly qualified for the CT 2025 event and if you think it through, the last-placed position does not do justice to their performance compared to a few other sides. They'll also be mighty pleased with the batting grit they showed against an Indian attack that looks oh-so-menacing.

Keep an eye out for the match report that shall break down the game in more detail. Congratulations to India fans and commiserations to the Dutch faithful. See you on the 15th for the big one.

IPL contract for Teja?

Doing well against India is a surefire way to get the IPL teams interested. And Vijaywada-born Teja Nidamanuru smashes six sixes to hit a quickfire fifty.

But Rohit has the last laugh. He gets the batter to hhit to long on and India win by 160 runs

Rohitians rejoice!

The captain is bowling. He has two IPL hat-tricks but hasn't bowled in a very long time. Last time he bowled for India was in 2006.

Just enjoy while it lasts I guess. The game is dusted.

Netherlands, though, will be delighted getting near 250.

Suryakumar's time to have a bowl...

"Serious cricket from one end, party from the other," says Sanjay Manjrekar on the broadcast. And that's because Rohit has gone to Suryakumar. He bowls offspin too, starting around the wicket. Bowls a bit like Graeme Swann, in terms of his action!

If you're still interested about what's happening in this game that India basically have sealed: Bumrah failed to get a wicket because of another Siraj drop but then takes the fielders out of the equation by bowling a searing yorker at the base of off stump to dismiss Bas de Leede.

SHUBMAN GILL IS BOWLING!!!

He's only bowled seven balls in internationals - all against Australia in the March Test.

How does Gill bowl? Offspin is the official term, and he also gets some turn on the second ball. He has a stiff non-bowling arm that stays quite high while he delivers the ball. The followthrough of the non-bowling arm is strong though, coming down quickly upon delivery, which are good signs according to the textbook.

KOHLI IS BOWLING

You want entertainment? You'll get entertainment. No logic here except just vibes.

He's getting the ball to drift into the batter in the air, and therefore errs legside for the first two balls. The next few deliveries are outside off as Kohli looks to overcorrect.

And the last ball of the over is a ball tempting enough to drive. Edwards gets the edge but there's no first slip, so Kohli's wicket will have to wait.

Ravindra Jadeja's introduction brought Rohit Sharma success•ICC/Getty Images

Jadeja with a dream start to his spell - seeing the batter O'Dowd's stumps rattled first ball. Then he races away to bowl 17 dots in his first 24 balls to dry up the runs from one end.

Kuldeep doing the same, and is also unlucky that he didn't get another wicket. Siraj shelled a catch in the deep and the ball hit his throat. He had gone out for a short while but is back again.

Wristspinner with the wicket

The wristspinner is considered the partnership breaker in most teams, and very few these days are as good at that role than Kuldeep Yadav. He tempts Ackermann to play the reverse sweep since the batter was struggling to pick his turn, and that's all the opening Yadav needs. Slides one on and gets the batter LBW for a spunky 32-ball 35.

The India fans have been spoilt by the bowlers this World Cup. Now that there's been only one wicket in 11 overs, the fans too are getting restless.

"Kohli ko bowling do" [Give Kohli the ball] is the chant going around the stadium. Time for a wrong-footed* inswinging menace?

* Technically, Kohli is not wrong-footed.

...and it is the Netherlands who get there (for this World Cup).

It took them 8.1 overs, and came with the help of eight boundaries. The pitch is really good and Shami-Siraj have been conceding.

Netherlands 50/1 in 8.1 overs with Ackermann on 33 in 21. O'Dowd is quieter.

Run-scoring hasn't been easy, per se, but the pitch is still good for run-scoring, as evidenced by a few beautiful drives.

Otherwise, the India bowlers have been on top of their game, even if they have just one wicket in five overs thus far. Siraj with the only breakthrough. Netherlands 13/1 in 5 overs

Century for KL, India make 410

From saying "strike-rate is overrated" to hitting a 62-ball century! A remarkable century from the Bengaluru boy - and he's been clattering sixes and boundaries for fun in the death overs.

Eventually falls for a 64-ball 102 trying to go for yet another six. India finish on , their highest second-highest World Cup score and their second 400+ total in WCs. A total of 126 runs in the last ten overs.

Iyer unbeaten on 128 in 95 balls with 10 fours and five sixes to his name. India with a near-perfect day with the bat.

The evolution of Iyer, from someone who knows him well

Abhishek Nayar, the KKR mentor and a close confidante of Shreyas Iyer, explains how Iyer has risen from the challenge of having to deal with doubters, the short ball, and the pressure to perform.

He's now picked up a fourth ODI hundred, getting there in 84 balls. Nine fours and two sixes so far. And it is the short ball which gets him to the mark!

Iyer's been in super touch, this century comes on the back of 82 (vs SL) and 77 (vs SA). Also enough time for Rahul to get there.

Fifty for the top four

A drive caressed through cover and Iyer reaches his fifty in 48 balls. Every India batter has got a start, and has also reached fifty, but no one has gone big. It has opened the door for Iyer to go big though - question is, will he capitalise?

India 235/3 in 34 overs with a run-rate of 6.91. ESPNcricinfo's forecaster suggests they'll get 348. I say it will depend on how many balls Suryakumar Yadav gets.

Century No. 50 will have to wait

Pin-drop silence at the Chinnaswamy as former RCB man Roelof van der Merwe gets his former team-mate.

Kohli falls prey to a skiddy delivery, losing his off stump trying to cut, and RvdM's roar was leonine. Kohli looks at the stumps in disbelief, taps his bat on the pitch in disappointment, and even on his way back has one eye lingering on those rattled stumps.

India had reached 200/2 just a few moments before, in 28.3 overs, which was the second-fastest for them this World Cup. Now they're 200/3 with hometown boy KL Rahul joining Iyer.

Iyer joins Kohli

Another attractive half-century from Rohit. But he's gone for 61 - a rare pull gone wrong and he's taken on the boundary line.

The person who replaces him is another man who allegedly has a short-ball problem - Shreyas Iyer. Ask Shreyas and he'll say he has no short-ball problem. Ask Karthik Krishnaswamy, and he'll say Shreyas is amazing, despite his flaws.

Rohit cool, Kohli jittery

Its not nerves per se for Kohli. Just that the Dutch bowlers are changing their pace, and Kohli initially started off with hard hands. He has scored only 9 in 17 balls but the Indian start allows him to take his time a little.

Rohit, though, sublime as ever. He has now reached 500+ in two World Cup events, joining Sachin Tendulkar to that mark. He's on 61 and looks good for a big one.

Gill gone, Kohli enters

Four glorious sixes, three boundaries and a contribution of 51 in a hundred-run stand. It was a terrific assault from Gill in the powerplay.

India reached 100 in 11.4 overs but Gill fell next ball trying to find another six. He's been fluent all World Cup but hasn't got a century. But India won't mind as long as he keeps this intent in the semi.

Pin drop silence, followed by a big roar. Because the home (well, adopted home) town boy is here. And searching for No. 50.

A special campaign for Rohit

"Rohit Sharma has scored more powerplay runs, quicker, at a higher average, hitting more fours and more sixes than anyone at this World Cup. It is a staggering statistic. For a batter who built his game on watchful starts. For a team that is built on conservative starts and big runs from star batters. For a captain to take that high-risk role on and not delegate it to a younger batter."

No experimentation

India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and chose to bat and said they go in unchanged. He says India have expressed themselves with freedom from Day 1 in the tournament and says today's game gives them another chance to tick all of the boxes.

Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards says he would have batted too and adds they too are fielding the same XI as the one that played against England.

India XI: 1 Rohit Sharma (capt), 2 Shubman Gill, 3 Virat Kohli, 4 Shreyas Iyer, 5 KL Rahul (wk), 6 Suryakumar Yadav, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Mohammed Shami, 9 Jasprit Bumrah, 10 Kuldeep Yadav, 11 Mohammed Siraj

We just saw LIVE pictures of the Dutch team in a huddle. And in between all of them was a napkin with the words "Hunger!!! Wind in our sails" written on it. Also saw a motivational speech from a support-staff member. They look pumped to make a statement here.

And why not? They were robbed off a chance to play India in the rained-out warm-up before the tournament, and now because they are on 4 points, they just need a win (or a washed-out single point) to qualify for the next big ICC ODI tournament!

We asked Rahul Dravid that yesterday and he kept his cards close to the chest. He said that with big gaps between games, workload management isn't a major concern for his first team. However, are India better off resting a few players today? It could mean a first WC appearance for Prasidh Krishna or a second match for R Ashwin.

India chase 9-0

The hosts have enjoyed a magical World Cup. And now it's time to finish the league stage off on a 9-0 note in Bengaluru.

It's also a favourite ground of Virat Kohli, who plays his IPL games here, and is chasing uncharted territory today with a 50th ODI century on his to-do list.

For the Dutch, it's an opportunity to finish their campaign in front of the biggest crowd they would've ever experienced. Bengaluru sure can stir up a great atmosphere and with today being Sunday and Diwali, the buzz will be all the more extra. Welcome to our live blog
