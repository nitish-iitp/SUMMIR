Travis Head scored a unbeaten 154 and Marnus Labuschagne contributed 77 as Australia successfully chased down a formidable 316-run target to beat England by seven wickets in the first of their five-match One Day International Series at Trent Bridge.

Australia reached 317-3 with six overs to spare after bowling England out for 315 in 49.4 overs.

It was a 13th successive ODI win for last year’s World Cup winners, and sixth in a row over England, despite being forced to field a depleted line-up because of illness in their camp and injury.

Head’s highest ODI score, coming off 129 balls with 20 fours and five sixes, was ably supported by Labuschagne, who earlier had also proven key in restricting EnglandÃ¢Â€Â™s strong start to the contest.

Travis Head makes England pay with superb century in seven-wicket Australia win

England spurned a commanding position by succumbing to spin before Travis Head took advantage of being dropped on six to make an unbeaten century and power Australia to a seven-wicket win.

From 213 for two in the 33rd over, thanks to Ben Duckett’s 95 off 91 deliveries and Will Jacks’ 62 off 56, England collapsed to 315 all out with two balls unused in the first of five ODIs at Trent Bridge.

A 350-plus scoreline went begging as nine wickets fell to spin and if Adam Zampa taking three for 49 on his 100th ODI is understandable, England might rue part-timer Marnus Labuschagne bagging three scalps.

They still might have had enough on the board when Head went aerial early on but Carse was too far in from the boundary and unable to cling on to a devilishly difficult one-handed chance above his head.

Australia’s World Cup final hero needed no second invitation and crashed 20 fours and five sixes, finishing on an ODI best 154 not out from 129 balls, while Labuschagne contributed an unbeaten 77 in an unbroken 148-run stand with Head to lead the tourists home with six overs to spare.

Australia 317-3, Head 154, Labuschagne 77, Jacks 0-25 (6) – Australia win by seven wickets

Speaking to Sky, Brook says that England “did everything we said we were going to do”.

“We went out there and scored quickly and when we came out to bowl, we tried to take wickets but it wasn’t our day today, hopefully it can be in the next.

“We wanted a big score, it was difficult in the middle and holding in the pitch.

“We ended up getting a below-par score.

“I felt good out there myself, Jacks played well. It’s a long series and hopefully we can carry on that momentum.”

Harry Brook spoke to BBC after the game, and he suggests that “it probably went wrong at the toss when I batted first”.

“It tuned out to be a belter. A tough night but we move forward. It’s a five-game series and four more to go.

“Last night I was thinking about bowling first then changed my mind 20 minutes before the toss. Hindisght is a beautiful thing. You can’t think too much into it.

“We probably didn’t rotate spin well enough through the middle period. It’s something I am working on personally as well. There were too many dot ball in the middle period. I felt we were in a good position in the halfway point. Under the lights at the end there it got better and they could hit through the ball easier.”

Ricky Ponting is also speaking on Sky, and he calls it a “very comprehensive run-chase”.

“Travis playing the way they did, Australia will be very happy with that. With no [Mitchell] Starc or [Josh] Hazelwood in the game.

“I think they managed things well. Marsh did really well but Head was incredible.

“He’s backing himself and doesn’t think he can get out. He keeps things simple and has the backing of the coaches to play that way. It’s amazing what happens when that environment is created.”

Stuart Broad calls Travis Head an “incredible player” across all three formats.

“[He’s] the most dangerous powerplay batter going, England knew they had to get rid of him. He doesn’t need 10 balls to get in.

“England were under par with the bat, especially here, once it skids on slightly, its a great place to play.

“He’s got such a natural ability to find the boundary. His main strength over the off-side. England were hoping the spin would tie him down.

“I think hitting pace is his greatest strength and England were leaning on Rashid to get him out.

“Labuschagne played that finishing role perfectly and didn’t panic. He just settled in going from fifth gear into first.”

Will Jacks steps up to bowl, with Head starting with a single. Australia are five away – four now as Labuschagne adds his own single.

Head wants to finish big but he settles for a single.

And it’s Labuschagne who does finish it, guiding in a four.

Head begins the over with a six to make 150. A magnificent display from the Aussie opener. A couple of singles follow from each of the pair, before Labuschagne adds two with a scoop over the shoulder, before finishing the over by sweeping a four.
