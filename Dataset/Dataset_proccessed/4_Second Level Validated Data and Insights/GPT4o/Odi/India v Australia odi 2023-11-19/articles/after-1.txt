Here are all the key updates from November 19, Sunday

Glory for Australia as Head seals sixth World Cup title

Australian cricket team once again lived up to their serial winners tag.

In a rare final where they were not the favourites for the trophy, Australia won the ICC Men's ODI Cricket World Cup title for the sixth time after beating in-form India by six wickets.

First, Aussie bowlers led the charge restricting India to 240 on a slow surface and then Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne ensured their team reach the target with 42 balls to spare.

Head was the standout player as made 137 in just 120 balls while Labuschagne remained unbeaten on 58.

Heartbreak for Rohit Sharma's team and millions of fans who were hopeful that the team will life the World Cup for the third time in their history.

Bhullar wins Indonesia Masters

Positive news in Indian golf.

Gaganjeet Bhullar closed an amazing week with a brilliant eagle putt from 20 feet on the 18th hole to clinch his 11th Asian Tour title and an incredible fifth win in Indonesia on Sunday.

Finishing second behind Bhullar was another Indian Karandeep Kochhar who had a bogey-free 63 on the final day.

In fact, Bhullar dropped two bogeys during the day but made it up with four birdies. The eagle from 20 feet ensured he take home the trophy.

A bit of context:

Bhullar's five-shot win at the BNI Indonesia Masters in Jakarta was also the biggest of his international career. It was also the first win in the International Series for any Indian. The last win for any Indian on the Asian Tour was 15 months ago, also in Indonesia, by Bhullar, who revealed that his mother was born in Indonesia.

The win took Bhullar to fourth place on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, while Kochhar is the next best Indian at 19th.

An added bonus for Bhullar was that his victory catapulted him from 46th place on The International Series Order of Merit to eighth. Those from second to eight places are fast tracked into the second round of the LIV Golf Promotions event in three weeks in Abu Dhabi. The top three finishers there will earn places in next year's LIV Golf League.

"Today I played pretty well actually. I struggled a bit in the middle of the round, there was a stretch when I was trying my level best but I was not making the birdies but the chip in on number 16 turned around everything. And, of course the eagle on the last was the icing on the cake." Bhullar said.

I-League news

Wow, this is a shocker. Shillong Lajong FC handed Gokulam Kerala FC their first defeat of the season. Daniel Goncalves, Renan Paulino and Hardy Cliff Nongbri scored for Lajong at home to win the match 3-1. For Gokulam, Nili Perdomo scored the only goal.

This was Lajong's first win in the four matches they have played so far, while Gokulam are in second place with 10 points from five matches. Mohammedan Sporting, who won on Saturday, continue to top the table with 13 points from five outings.

The league has started as we usually see this division do - at breakneck pace and with everyone bunching close to each other. The current top two remain hot favourites, but it'll be interesting to note how this season fares - especially with the carrot of ISL promotion at the end of it all.
