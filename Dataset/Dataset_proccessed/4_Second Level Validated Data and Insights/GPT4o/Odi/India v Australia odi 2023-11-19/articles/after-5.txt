It’s a wrap

Travis Head becomes the third Australian after Ricky Ponting’s 140 in 2003 and Adam Gilchrist’s 149 in 2007 to score a century in a World Cup final.

Considering he wasn’t a part of the XI till Australia faced off against New Zealand on October 27 is just mind-boggling.

Mind you, he scored a hundred on that occasion as well.

Cummins winning the toss and electing to field was a masterstroke as the pitch proved to be slow, and with the tight bowling and aggressive fielding on offer, India were made to work for every run.

India looked to threaten a comeback after rocking Australia for 47 for 3, but Head and Marnus Labuschagne put their heads down to construct a match-turning 192-run partnership, which ultimately proved the difference.

Australia secure a sixth ODI World Cup title, while India will look upon today as a huge missed opportunity considering they were playing in their backyard, and had been far and away the best team in the tournament.

We hope you enjoyed our coverage of today’s final, and on behalf of Hafsa Adil, Kevin Hand and Patrick Keddie, this is Rohan Sharma signing off.

‘This is the top of the mountain’: Cummins

This win marks the end of an incredible year for Australia, who beat India in the World Test Championship final in England before retaining the Ashes.

Now they are World Cup winners as well – and that after losing the first two games of the tournament.

“You’ve got to go and win a World Cup and you can’t just let it happen,” captain Pat Cummins continued.

“You’ve got to be brave at times, you’ve got to take the game on.

“There was a real shift after those first two games with the batters in particular.

“The openers became really aggressive and didn’t waiver from that for the rest of the tournament.

“It was a total buy-in from everyone and it worked.

“This year will be a year we remember for a long, long time. It’s been awesome.

“We’ve pretty much spent the whole Australia winter away from home … [and] we have had a lot of success. But this pips it all – this is the top of the mountain.”

‘We saved the best for last’ – Cummins

Australia captain Pat Cummins was rightly beaming following his side’s performance to win the World Cup.

“We saved out best for last and a couple of big-match players stood up – we’re pretty chuffed,” he said.

“We’ve been batting first for pretty much the whole tournament.

“Today we thought it was a good night to chase down and we thought it might get a little bit easier.

“[The pitch] was a bit slower than we thought. It didn’t really spin either and I thought everyone adjusted really well and bowled some tight lines.

“We were really chuffed with 240 [for India], but we thought we could chase anything up to 300.

“Marnus walked in with a cool head and Trav just does what he does – really brave again. He takes the game on and put some pressure back on India.

“To do it on the biggest stage shows some character. He’s a legend and how fun is he to watch.

“The passion in India is unrivalled around the world. It’s pretty special when you look around and everyone is wearing the blue shirt – no matter what happened we were never going to forget a day like today.”

‘We tried everything we could, but it wasn’t meant to be’

The losing captain, Rohit Sharma, provided his post-match views: “We tried everything we could from our side, but it wasn’t meant to be. Twenty or 30 more [runs] would have been good.”

“When KL [Rahul] and [Virat] Kohli were batting, I thought they just need to stitch a good partnership and bat as long as possible. We were looking at 280 at that point,” he said.

“That’s what Australia did. They stitched up a good partnership to win the game. When you have 240 on the board you want to take wickets as early as possible, but again credit to those two guys [Head and Labuschagne] to stitch a partnership and take the game away from us.”

“The pitch definitely improved under the lights. We knew it would be slightly better, but again I don’t want to give that as an excuse, as we didn’t bat well enough to put the [necessary] runs on the board.”

Captain Rohit Sharma gave his best in this World Cup.

Scored over 500 runs and did excellently well in the captaincy department, but the Final came and Australia took it away. Feel for him. 💔 pic.twitter.com/0rtVm537vd

Kohli named Player of the Tournament

It will come as scant reward for Virat Kohli at the moment, but there was no doubt he was the player who deserved to win this award.

The 35-year-old scored 765 runs, three hundreds – one on his birthday – and is now the stand-alone record holder for the most one-day international (ODI) centuries with 50.
