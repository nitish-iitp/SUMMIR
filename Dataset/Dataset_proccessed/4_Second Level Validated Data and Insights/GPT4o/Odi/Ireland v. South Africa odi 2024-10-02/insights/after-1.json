    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Temba Bavuma, SA Captain: We\u2019re going to bat. It\u2019s a good wicket, with nice grass covering on it. Want to make use of the good batting conditions. It might do a bit under the lights. We\u2019re not used to this (heat) back home. The next couple of days is our focus. For now, we want to put our best foot forward. Quite a lot of cricket before the Champions Trophy. Some changes from the Afghanistan series. We have a debutant in Ottniel Baartman.",
        "Paul Stirling, IRE Captain: Very proud moment (to play 400 games), back to business though, we\u2019ve got a game to win. It was a difficult decision at the toss, happy to have a bowl. With the dew coming in, it might get a bit difficult later, we\u2019ll take it over by over. Gavin Hoey makes his debut today."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Ryan Rickelton mentioned that they found themselves under pressure early on as the ball moved significantly, making batting challenging. Their focus was on building a partnership, and got great support from Tristan Stubbs. After losing three early wickets, the mindset had to shift to a more defensive, Test match mode approach to weather the storm."
