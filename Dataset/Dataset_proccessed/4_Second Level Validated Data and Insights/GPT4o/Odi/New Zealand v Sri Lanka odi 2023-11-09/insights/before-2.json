        "New Zealand seek last semi-final berth; Sri Lanka's train heading towards the Champions Trophy.",
        "Even a win can't assure New Zealand of a top-four ticket, with Pakistan having a game in hand; and rain could play a part in Bengaluru again.",
        "Williamson: 'We knew anybody can beat anybody and we've seen that'.",
        "New Zealand's fate is largely in their own hands. A win against Sri Lanka, and they move to ten points to almost certainly lock that fourth semi-final slot.",
        "Sri Lanka's last ODI victory against New Zealand came back in 2015.",
        "Rachin Ravindra has 523 runs this World Cup. He hadn't played a single game of ODI cricket when the year began but he is now the third-highest run-scorer in the tournament.",
        "Kusal Mendis, the man named captain two games into this tournament, two games in which he was a whirlwind of unadulterated intent.",
        "Sri Lanka badly need Mendis to rediscover his mojo.",
        "For New Zealand, Matt Henry has been ruled out of the World Cup. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's weakness against short-pitched bowling might see the inclusion of one or both of Kyle Jamieson and Lockie Ferguson.",
        "New Zealand (probable): 1 Devon Conway, 2 Rachin Ravindra, 3 Kane Williamson (capt.), 4 Daryl Mitchell, 5 Tom Latham (wk), 6 Glenn Phillips, 7 Mark Chapman, 8 Mitchell Santner, 9 Ish Sodhi/Kyle Jamieson, 10 Trent Boult, 11 Tim Southee/Lockie Ferguson.",

        "New Zealand as whole might not have fond memories of the Chinnaswamy stadium, but their batters might, having plundered 401 against Pakistan.",
        "Sri Lanka too will remember fondly their win against England here."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "New Zealand captain Kane Williamson sings praises for young Rachin Ravindra: 'We knew the talent was there, but to come out be one of the players of the tournament so far - not only with the bat, but he's also making really valuable contributions with the ball. Yeah, very, very special player, and great that he's on our side.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Rachin Ravindra has hit three hundreds in this World Cup.",

        "Two of the three games at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in this World Cup have seen the side batting first score above 350, with only England - against Sri Lanka - failing to do so."
