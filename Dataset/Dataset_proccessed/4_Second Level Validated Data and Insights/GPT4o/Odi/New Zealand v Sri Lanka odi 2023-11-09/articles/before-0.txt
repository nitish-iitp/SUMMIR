In a pivotal match in Bengaluru, Match 41 of the ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023 will pit New Zealand against Sri Lanka. With the Kiwis vying to advance to the top four and the Aisan side already eliminated, this will be the final group stage match for both sides.

The BlackCaps lost their most recent match against Pakistan even though they scored 401 runs. While Kane Williamson struck an incredible 95 runs off 79 deliveries, Rachin Ravindra added another hundred runs. In reply, Pakistan had lost their first wicket, but before the rain interrupted play, Fakhar Zaman and Babar Azam had scored 194 runs for the second wicket. The Men in Green managed to win this game by 21 runs on the DLS method.

In their most recent match, Sri Lanka played Bangladesh, and although it ended in a loss, there was a great deal of drama.

Nevertheless, Sri Lanka amassed 279 runs thanks to a brilliant 108 runs by Charith Asalanka. In response, Shakib Al Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto contributed a vital 169 runs for Bangladesh, despite losing two early wickets. With three wickets remaining in 41.1 overs, Bangladesh easily reached the target of 280 runs.
