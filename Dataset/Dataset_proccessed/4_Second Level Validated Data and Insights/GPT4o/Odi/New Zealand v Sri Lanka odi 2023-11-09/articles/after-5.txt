Right then. The scenarios for both Pakistan and Afghanistan are next to impossible. Afghanistan need to win by at least 438 runs to surpass New Zealand on NRR. Pakistan have to win by at least 287 or, assuming England are kept to 150, chase down the target in 3.4 overs. So you can gauge the task at hand. New Zealand are safe. But they are back to winning ways. Keep an eye out for reactions and features from this game. For now, that's all we have for you in this game. On behalf of our scorers and Madushka, this is Sudarshanan signing off. Take care, ciao!

8:03pm Time to hear from the captains.

Kusal Mendis, Sri Lanka captain with assistant coach Naveen Naved helping translate: "First ten overs, we lost three-four wickets, hence we struggled with the bat. If we had a good partnership in the middle overs, we could have had 300+ on this wicket. Dilshan Madushanka bowled well, but since they were chasing a small total, it was difficult. [On taking captaincy over mid-tournament from Dasun Shanaka] I got the captaincy after two games. Quite enjoyed it. Disappointed with my own performance, but enjoyed the captaincy. Very happy to see a couple of young players putting their hands up to perform. They are our future."

Kane Williamson, New Zealand captain: "Really good performance... early wickets and spin was challenging. The wicket slowed down and the guys played with intent in the second half. We expected the first [pitch vs Pakistan] like that but were not sure. We thought there will be a bit of weather but there was none. We knew Sri Lanka can be strong. Perera was strong at the top but the wickets we picked up went a long way in restricting them. There was not much for the seamers but they kept it strong. Great to get our fifth and sixth spinners in the tournament. There's a few teams that could end up on similar points. Not in our control. We will be having a couple of days off, not sure what's happening. [Playing India] These things don't happen. Especially the back end being so close. Playing semis is special but playing the home team will be challenging. Looking forward to it if we are fortunate enough to have it."

7:53pm Trent Boult, Player of the Match: "Nice to get a bit of success at the top. A must-win game, the pleasure is about getting the result. [Personal form] It is a challenging part of the world opening the bowling. Nice to get a decent outing. Always the biggest challenge of coming here is different conditions. Conditions have changed throughout. [On playing India in semi] Everyone wants to a piece of the strong home nation. Looking forward to it."

Rachin Ravindra to Star Sports: "It's a pretty surreal feeling. Grateful for the support, especially playing in Bangalore. Crowd chanting my name is something I will never take for granted. Dreamt of it as a child. Very happy to be here, lucky enough it worked out. Six to 12 months ago, I was not even in the frame. Good to get the job done and get into the playoffs. [On taking the catch to give Ajaz Patel his Test ten-for] It was a nervy moment in my career. Lucky to have taken the catch. I don't have the ball. Lucky enough to have come year in my teenage years on club tours. That has helped me a lot. Nice wickets to bat on. If you play positive cricket, you get rewarded. The guys have adapted well. You talk to Kane, Devon, who are legends. [On stepping in Williamson's shoes at the start of the World Cup] It's a funny one. I have idolised Kane. I have idolised a lot like Virat Kohli, Steven Smith, Joe Root. But Kane... his leadership, on and off the field, just keeps it calm. When you are young, you take the game on, lucky to have come off."

7:48pm New Zealand now have one leg in the semi-final with ten points. Their positive NRR gives them a high chance of playing India in the semi-final in Mumbai. A chase of 172 was never going to trouble a line-up like New Zealand's. And Conway and Ravindra eliminated any semblance of hope that Sri Lanka would have had, with a rapid opening stand.

They added 86 inside 13 overs before Sri Lanka struck twice quickly. Mitchell then quelled any hope that Sri Lanka would have harboured. His 43 off just 31 balls included some breathtaking strokes. He should have finished the chase but it was not to be. Nothing much to write home about, regarding Sri Lanka's bowling.

Angelo Mathews to Latham, no run

Huge appeal for lbw. Did it pitch in line? Mathews convinces Mendis to opt for the review. Latham misses the flick off his pads but this landed well outside the line of leg stump

Tom Latham is the next man in with New Zealand needing just ten

W
Angelo Mathews to Mitchell, OUT

Terrific diving catch by Asalanka! Another length ball, slower one again. Mitchell looks to go big but is early into the stroke. Ends up slicing it in the air and towards deep cover-point. Asalanka covers a lot of ground to his left and takes it with a full-stretch dive

Daryl Mitchell c Asalanka b Mathews 43 (31b 5x4 2x6 45m) SR: 138.7

Punched straight to cover

Waqas Ahmed: "I didn't get why Chapman is out, It should Daryl Mitchell who left his crease, is there any change of rule recently? " Mitchell crossed Chapman and made the crease at the striker's end before the stumps at the other end were broken

Madushanka to Phillips, 2 runs

Length ball on leg, turns it through midwicket with soft hands and hares back for two

Hasan: "This pending comprehensive victory for NZ has all but finished Pakistan's hopes of qualifying. What kind of unlikely victory would PK require to overturn the mammoth NRR in their favour?" Just wait for our scenarios piece tonight :)

Angelo Mathews to Phillips, FOUR runs

Slashes and slashes hard. Gets going with a crunchy four. Length ball outside off, Phillips throws his hard hands at that. Gets a thick outside edge that flies perfectly between backward point and short third

Angelo Mathews to Chapman, OUT

Horrible mix-up. Chapman has to sacrifice but he is making his displeasure felt. Fuller on leg, Chapman looks to go big over the on side but misses, and the ball goes off his back leg towards short third. Mitchell calls for the run, Chapman responds initially before saying no. Mitchell, meanwhile, is almost at the other end and crosses Chapman over. The throw is a calm one, straight to Mathews, who does the rest. It was Mitchell's call and Chapman has to depart. Hits the LED board outside the boundary with the bat as he walks back

Mark Chapman run out (Samarawickrama/Mathews) 7 (6b 1x4 0x6 13m) SR: 116.66
20.2
1
Angelo Mathews to Mitchell, 1 run

Length ball outside off at 112.8kph, Mitchell ends up getting it towards mid-off off the bottom half of his bat. Runs and makes it to the other end due to the lack of pace on that ball
