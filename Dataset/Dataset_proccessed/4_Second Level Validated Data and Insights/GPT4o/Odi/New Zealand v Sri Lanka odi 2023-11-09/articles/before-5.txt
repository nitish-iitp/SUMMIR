Preview

In the 40th match of the ODI World Cup 2023, New Zealand are scheduled to play against Sri Lanka at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. The string of losses for the Blackcaps have derailed their CWC 2023 campaign, while the Lankan Lions have been far from their best in the flagship tournament as well. But, for their final round-robin match of the ODI World Cup 2023, both New Zealand and Sri Lanka have a lot at stake, which is why it could be a real humdinger of a contest.

Pitch Report

The pitches at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru for the ODI World Cup 2023 have provided the batters the opportunity to post big totals on the board consistently. As a result of that, the average first-innings score of 265 is something that both New Zealand and Sri Lanka will fancy to get past on November 9.

Team Analysis

New Zealand

Kane Williamson, the captain of New Zealand, stitched together a 180-run stand with Rachin Ravindra on his return, to help his team score 401/6 in their allotted 50 overs against Pakistan in the ODI World Cup 2023. In defence of the big score, the Blackcaps were poor in the bowling department, losing on the DLS method in just under 26 overs after conceding 200 runs, while the likes of Tim Southee and Mitchell Santner not going for plenty.

SportsTiger Playing XI of New Zealand

Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson (c), Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (wk), Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Trent Boult

Sri Lanka

Charith Asalanka notched up his second hundred of his ODI career against Bangladesh, but still, Sri Lanka could only get a below-par total of less than 280 runs on the board. The bowling attack of the Lankan Lions tried hard to defend the score, but despite the wickets from Dilshan Madushanka and Maheesh Theekshana, they were unsuccessful in stopping the opposition.

Match Prediction

Conclusion

New Zealand will definitely have the upper hand over Sri Lanka before they take the field at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. But with a semi-final spot at stake, the Blackcaps will have to be at their absolute best to get the better of the Lankan Lions, who would want to secure their spot in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 too.
