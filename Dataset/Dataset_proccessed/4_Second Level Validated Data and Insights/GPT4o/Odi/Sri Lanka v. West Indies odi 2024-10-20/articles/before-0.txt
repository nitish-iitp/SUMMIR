Sri Lanka enters the ODI series after a 2-1 T20I series win over West Indies

Sri Lanka has announced a 16-member squad for the upcoming three-match ODI series against the West Indies, with all matches set to take place at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium. The series begins on October 20, followed by the second and third ODIs on October 23 and 26, respectively. All-rounder Chamindu Wickramasinghe has earned his first ODI call-up. Meanwhile, fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka returns to the squad after missing the India series in August due to a hamstring injury. Mohamed Shiraz, who made his ODI debut during that series, retains his spot.

Wanindu Hasaranga is also back in the squad, having recovered from a hamstring injury that kept him out of the final two ODIs against India. However, Sri Lanka has left out all-rounder Chamika Karunaratne and spinner Akila Dananjaya from the squad. The pace attack will miss Matheesha Pathirana, who is still recovering from a shoulder injury sustained before the India series. Dushmantha Chameera and Nuwan Thushara have also been excluded. Nishan Madushka, who was called up for the India series but did not feature in any match, remains part of the squad.

Sri Lanka Cricket selectors have selected the following squad to take part in the three-match ODI series vs. West Indies.

Sri Lanka comes into the ODI series with momentum, having recently secured a 2-1 T20I series win against the West Indies. Although they lost the opening match, Sri Lanka fought back to win the next two games and clinch the series.

This ODI series will give Sri Lanka a chance to build squad depth, especially with the return of key players from injury. It also provides an opportunity to test younger players like Wickramasinghe and Shiraz in preparation for future competitions. The team will aim to carry forward the winning momentum from the T20Is and perform well in the ODIs.

Sri Lanka squad:

Charith Asalanka (c), Avishka Fernando, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Kamindu Mendis, Janith Liyanage, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Nishan Madushka, Dunith Wellalage, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Jeffrey Vandersay, Chamidu Wickramasinghe, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka, Mohamed Shiraz
