Charith Asalanka is the Player of the Match. He says it was a convincing win. Admits the plan was to attack and be positive with the bat. Tells it got easier to bat once the ball got wet and that helped them chase it down. Feels it is a positive headache to have when all the players perform but it is good for the team.

Shai Hope says they can’t control the weather and the conditions but hopes to be better next time. Tells the batters showed intent in the later part but the same thing should happen from the top order as well. Mentions it was difficult to bowl in this conditions but they need to find ways.

The game was nicely poised when Sherfane Rutherford and Roston Chase were batting. It felt like they will take the score above 280 but the rain killed their hoped and had to rely on the revised score as per DLS which didn’t help them.

West Indies began brilliantly with the ball. Yes, they leaked runs but got wickets too. Once the ball got old though, the zip disappeared and then it was difficult for them to manage the run flow and take wickets. Motie though was brilliant but he lacked support from the rest. Maybe if the others bowled decently, the result could have been different but for now, it is the hosts who have managed to get a win.

Quite a comfortable chase in the end and Lanka ha be taken a 1-0 lead in the series. It didn’t seem it would be this comfortable when they were three down for not a lot but Madhushka and Asalanka batted brilliantly. They added close to 150. Both scored fifties but fell in quick succession. The game though was in Sri Lanka’s favour by then. The batters to come, Janith Liyanage and Kamindu Mendis ensured there wasn’t a surprise as they helped their side cruise to a win.
