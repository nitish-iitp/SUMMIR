        "India captain Rohit Sharma speaks: 'The bowlers set the game up for us. Restricting them to 190 was a great effort \u2013 at one stage we were looking at 270/280. We pride ourselves on the fact that whoever gets the ball does the job for the team. It\u2019s my job as captain to read the conditions and decide who is the best guy to bowl. We\u2019ve been very clear with what we want to do: who bats in what position and what happens if someone isn\u2019t fit. Guys got runs and wickets going into the World Cup, so all in all it\u2019s looking good. We don\u2019t want to get too excited or too low. It\u2019s a long tournament and we want to stay balanced. That is the key.'",
        "The Pakistan captain Babar Azam speaks: 'We started well, then suddenly we collapsed in the middle overs. It\u2019s not good. We were aiming for 280/290 but that collapse cost us. With the new ball we were not up to the mark, though Rohit played an outstanding innings.'",
        "The player of the match is \u2026 Jasprit Bumrah. He did bowl beautifully (7-1-19-2), but I assumed it would be Rohit. Anyway, here\u2019s what he had to say: 'It felt good. We try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible; we realised it was on the slower side and that a hard length would make run-scoring difficult. We knew as the ball got a little older it might reverse and grip a little bit. We were waiting for that and trying to make it as difficult as possible.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "It\u2019s now India 8-0 Pakistan at ODI World Cups, and this is the most emphatic win of the lot. Their captain Rohit Sharma was inspired with both brain and bat. First he presided over an almighty Pakistan collapse from 155/2 to 191 all out; then he pre-empted any new-ball ferocity from Pakistan by whacking six sixes in a 63-ball 86.",
        "India recorded the fastest ODI run chase against Pakistan, finishing with almost 20 overs to spare."
