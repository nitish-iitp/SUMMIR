    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Rohit Sharma: The bowlers today as well set the game for us. Restricting them to 190 was a great effort. It was not a 190 pitch. At one stage we were looking at 280 or 290. Whoever gets the ball does the job for the team. We have got six individuals who can do the job. It cannot be everyone's day every day. The person having a good day has to finish the job. My job as captain has to be important. Whoever is doing the job on the day I have to figure out who is doing the job and go with him. It's only because the guys entering the World Cup got a lot of runs. The role clarity as well was great. We knew what to do. Entering the WC we didn't want to see what happened previously. We were very clear about what we wanted to do. The batters got the opportunity and made it count. The bowlers also did their job. Lots of five-fors. [On the team getting together] I will keep my fingers crossed. We don't want to get too excited and also not get too low as well. It is a long tournament, nine league games and then the semis and final. Just have to keep the balance and go forward. I have said it before, for us it was an opposition [Pakistan] we wanted to play. Every opposition we come against they can beat you. We have to be good on that particular day. The past and future does not matter.",
        "Babar Azam: We started well, good partnership. We just planned to play normal cricket an build partnerships. Suddenly there was a collapse and we could not finish well. Not good for us, the way we started, our target was 280-290 but the collapse cost us. The total was not good. We are not up to the mark with the new ball. The way Rohit played, was an outstanding innings. We just tried to take wickets, but that didn't happen.",
        "Jasprit Bumrah: It felt good. You get to analyse the wicket as soon as possible. We knew the wicket was on the slower side so the hard lengths were the way. We were trying to make it as difficult as possible for the batters. Just the awareness helps. When I was young I used to ask a lot of questions, so that has helped me develop a lot of knowledge. I like to read the wickets and try a lot of options. [Rizwan wicket] I saw Jaddu's ball was turning, so I count my slower ball as a spinner's slower ball. I thought that can make the run-scoring tough, and it worked. There was a little phase in there where there was reverse swing. [Shadab wicket] It was an outswinger I was looking to ball but there was parts of reverse swing happening. I have seen him [Waqar Younis] and Wasim Akram bowl some magical deliveries. So to get his nod is great."
