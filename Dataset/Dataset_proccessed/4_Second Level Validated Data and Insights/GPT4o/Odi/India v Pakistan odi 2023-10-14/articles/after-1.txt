India began like a train in response with skipper Rohit Sharma plundering 86 off 63 balls, including six sixes, to put his side within striking distance of the target.

The hosts lost the wicket of Virat Kohli but Shreyas Iyer picked up the baton to get the job done with plenty to spare as Pakistan's bowlers struggled to make inroads.

A quick review of what's happened today then.

Pakistan had looked fairly comfortable at 155-2 after they asked to bat first by India.

But when Babar Azam was bowled by Mohammed Siraj for 50 it was the catalyst for a Pakistan collapse as eight wickets went down for 36 runs and they were bowled out for 191.

Kuldeep Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah were instrumental in blowing Pakistan away.

Previously, maybe we lost close games but this was very one-sided. India are getting stronger and stronger at home so it's getting harder for Pakistan to beat them.

Maybe they'll have to wait another year or two to get that first World Cup win over them.

Mickey Arthur, Pakistan's coach, has done Pakistan's post-match press conference.

He was clearly trying to remain upbeat.

He said India are a good team and he's looking forward to meeting them again in the final...

Critics will be talking about Babar's captaincy. He didn't really think out of the box, it was pretty flat.

In this sort of situation, you want to see your captain really doing something different to put pressure on the opposition and it didn't really happen.

Shaheen also not really delivering that Pakistan are used to. So there are issues.

I don't know who is fit or not fit but if they're not fit they shouldn't be playing. I'm not taking anything away from the India bowlers because it was their bowling more than poor Pakistan batting.

Shaheen Afridi is not having that prodigious swing at pace that we're used to seeing. Something just looks a bit off.

Hassan Ali doesn't have the pace that he had when he burst onto the scene. He has all the tools, he's just lost a little bit of pace and it gives batters a bit more time when the ball is coming down.

Those little 1% things make all the difference.

Ever since his knee injury, I don't think Shaheen is 100% fit. Maybe that is one thing.

But also, I think he's got a plan A and if that doesn't work, he doesn't have a plan B.

Shaheen Afridi finished with 2-36 for Pakistan but it seems to have come in for a lot of scrutiny from the pundits for his lack of bite up front.

Pakistan were sitting pretty good after beating Sri Lanka and today's defeat looks very ordinary.

They have to really sit back and fix their issues. Batting, Babar Azam looked pretty good but didn't go on and get a big one, all of the top four made starts but nobody kept going. That's another issue.

Then losing eight wickets in 12 overs is a no-go zone. Pakistan need to work out what needs to be done because they have big matches to play against England, South Africa and New Zealand.

That has been the story of India v Pakistan games in World Cups. There have been eight games now and none of them have been close.

A little disappointing from that aspect, especially when for the 30 overs, it looked like Pakistan would get up to 280 or 290.

But from then onwards it was totally domination from the Indian side. A game like this boils down to how you handle pressure.

India captain Rohit Sharma: "There is no doubt about it that the bowlers set up the game for us again today. It was a great effort. I don't think it was a 190 pitch. At one stage we were looking at 270-280 but they came back and showed grit and that says a lot about the guys.

"We pride ourselves on whoever gets the ball doing the job for us. We speak about that in the changing room. It can be someone's day. It can't be everybody's every day. My job as a captain is important there to read the conditions and who is the best guy to trouble the batsman. I assess that every now and then.

"Before entering the World Cup the guys got a lot of runs and we had role clarity. We didn't want to be in two minds about who batted where and what would happen if this guy didn't bat there. It is the same with the bowlers. All in all it is looking good, and I want to keep my fingers crossed. We don't want to get too excited or get too low, we want to stay balanced.

"I've said it quite a few times now, this was an opposition we wanted to play against because we want to play quality opposition. Every opposition we come up against in this tournament is quality and can beat you on any particular day. What has happened in the past or might happen in the future doesn't matter too much. You have to play well on that particular day."

If I were a Pakistan opening bowler, I might be a bit stiff with the captain saying we weren't good enough with the new ball after we'd been bundled out for 190.

Pakistan captain Babar Azam: "We started well and we got a good partnership between me and Imam.

"We were playing normally but then we had a collapse in the middle order. We did not finish well.

"Not good for us. The way we started, we were targeting 280 or 290 but the collapse cost us so our total is not good.

"With the new ball, we were not up to the mark. If we had been, it might have been a different ball game. But the way Rohit played, it was an outstanding innings.

"After that we were just trying to take wickets to try and win the match."

If you're really honest and look at the balance of the side, the teams in form, Pakistan are right at the bottom of the three or four sides aiming for the semi-finals.

They need to hit form, Shaheen Afridi to start taking early wickets, Haris Rauf to take wickets and we're not really scoring enough runs so it will be tough against good sides.

India won with 117 balls remaining. Although this is not their biggest victory over their rivals in terms of the number of balls left in ODIs.

That came when India beat Pakistan in an ODI at Dubai in 2018 when they got home by eight wickets with 126 balls remaining.

Player of the match, India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah: "It felt good.

"You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult.

"We were waiting for it to maybe reverse a little bit and make it as difficult as possible.

"It helps you to read the wicket and try different options.

"There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped - it was one of those days."

Brilliant win for India by seven wickets with 20 overs in hand.

A bizarre match with 100,000-plus here but all Indian supporters which has made it a rather strange event, to be honest.

Very difficult for Pakistan under those circumstances but they did have a very good platform before they lost 8-36 in 13 overs - they were all over the place.

These games do tend to end with smiles on face despite all that goes with it.

Convincing victory from India. As dominating as you will get.

The game certainly didn't live up to the hype but it furthers our opinions and predictions that India are the team to beat at home in this World Cup.

They have all skillsets covered and are admirably led by the champion Rohit Sharma.

Both sets of players, and the members of their coaching staff, are on the field shaking hands with each other. It's all very cordial.

Fireworks light up the night sky in Ahmedabad.
