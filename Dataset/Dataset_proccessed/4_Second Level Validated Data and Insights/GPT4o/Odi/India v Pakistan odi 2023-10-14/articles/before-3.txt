There’s more to a World Cup than an India Pak match
That’s why it’s called a WORLD CUP

So there’s NO opening ceremony for the first game of the tournament but here we are doing a song & dance technically for a league match

I mean, seriously now…!!! https://t.co/pjiu1nVn5J

One user wrote, “Get the feeling the song and dance is to ensure the stadium is packed from the start of the game. Can’t be taken for granted even for a India-Pakistan ODI.”

"It’s embarrassing no one cares about the other teams at all. They are the best teams of the world."

"BCCI seriously absurd !!!!!!!! Now we know where are those funds go !!!! It's quite embarrassing not to have an opening ceremony or a Teams pic.." another user wrote.

Some other wrote, “This is not World Cup. This is kind of joke. In another match's analysis they are bringing india everywhere. Cricket is doomed”

“Not having an opening ceremony for the opening match of the World Cup but belting out this extra special treatment in an India Pakistan match is utterly shameless behavior, even by BCCI and JayShah's terribly low standards.”

“Its just a match Why are you hyping this so much Shameful”

Here are some of the post on X:

🙄 Are you guys trolling all other teams 🌍🏏 that their matches, their participation doesn't matter and the event is all about India 🇮🇳 vs. Pakistan 🇵🇰?

It's not the opening match, neither is it the final! Why so much drama and fuss about it? It's just a match like we had with…

BCCI enters into event management.

The timing of this initiative is puzzling; ideally, it should have been during the opening ceremony.

— Vipin Sharma (@VipinSharma1203) October 12, 2023

Not doing the opening ceremony and doing this just for a match is not justified at all.

What if other nations start doing the same when they host the world cups?

The rivalry between India and Pakistan in cricket is one of the most fierce in the world, with matches between the two countries receiving significant global viewership. Indian’s railways will also run two special trains on the day from Mumbai to Ahmedabad to clear an “extra rush of cricket fans," according to a statement on its website. Restaurants are also trying to come up with unique offerings to draw fans. Tijuana, a Mexican restaurant in Mumbai, has a package that includes cricket-themed trivia rounds and a special menu that will “subtly" use elements of Indian and Pakistani cuisine, Anurag Katriar, founder of Indigo Hospitality Pvt., which owns the restaurant told Bloomberg. 

Ahead of the match, Ahmedabad police have issues a notification designating the city a "no-drone zone" during the India-Pakistan ICC World Cup Cricket Match at Narendra Modi Stadium on October 14, 2023, Times of India report stated.
