New Zealand win

Matt Henry finishes things, first tempting Sybrand Engelbrecht to pick out Devon Conway, running in from deep square, and then producing a gem which ripped Aryan Dutt's leg stump. Henry finishes with 3 for 40 from 8.3 ovres in a 99-run victory highlighted by Mitchell Santner's 5 for 59.

Three New Zealand batters reached half-centuries, while Daryl Mitchell made 48 and Santner played a neat cameo worth 36 off just 17 balls to set Netherlands a big target. Colin Ackermann put up a fight with his 69 off 73 but they had too much to do and New Zealand move to two wins from two games at this tournament.

Santer claims five-for

Just two balls after Sybrand Engelbrecht's non-dismissal, Mitchell Santner claims his five-for by trapping Ryan Klein lbw. Sampath tells us he is the first New Zealand spinner to take a five-wicket haul in a men's ODI World Cup. Santner has 5 for 59 from his 10 overs.

Let off for Engelbrecht

Sybrand Engelbrecht receives a bizarre reprieve as his dismissal is overturned. The debutant had almost walked off the field when he was called back for an umpire's review of his stumping and it was then deemed that Tom Latham's gloves had moved in front of the stumps. Replays suggest there were mere millimetres in it, if anything, to deny Rachin Ravindra a second wicket, but it was indeed called as a no ball.

Colin Ackermann's innings comes to an end on 69, caught at short third by Matt Henry attempting to reverse sweep Mitchell Santner. That means Sybrand Engelbrecht, the South African-born 35-year-old brought in to strengthen Netherlands' batting and boost them in the field, comes to the crease on international debut. And he begins well, punching Lockie Ferguson through long on for four off the third delivery faced.

A stunning piece of fielding by Trent Boult accounts for Bas de Leede. Having lofted Rachin Ravindra towards the boundary at long off, de Leede watches in anguish as Boult takes the ball just inside the rope, tosses it back into the air as he stumbles backwards over it and then leaps back inside to re-gather the ball as it drops, cool as you like. Netherlands are struggling at 67 for 3.

Santner strikes

Mitchell Santner was pivotal in pushing up New Zealand's total with his 36 not out off just 17 balls in a death-overs onslaught. Now he has the wicket of Max O'Dowd, lbw for 16 as Netherlands slip to 43 for 2. Netherlands were 35 for 1 after 10 overs, compared to New Zealand's 63 without loss, and that's against the backdrop of the Black Caps' slow start as Netherlands sent down three consecutive maidens to begin the match.

Matt Henry removes Vikramjit Singh to leave Netherlands 21 for 1. Henry's ball pitched on a length and angled into the left-hander from around the wicket, the ball straightening just a touch to evade Singh's defences and peg back middle stump.

Big ask for Netherlands
Will Young and Rachin Ravindra put on 77 runs for the second wicket•ICC via Getty Images

Netherlands are going to need a record here, chasing 323 to win. Their highest successful run chase in ODIs is 291 against Zimbabwe in 2019. That said, there was this Super Over victory against West Indies in the Qualifier in June.

New Zealand hung a strong total on half-centuries to Will Young, Tom Latham and Rachin Ravindra, with Daryl Mitchell contributing 48. The fact that none of their batters managed to kick on to a really big score – Young’s 70 was their highest – is credit to some encouraging bowling by Netherlands. Roelof van der Merwe, Paul van Meekeren and Aryan Dutt took two wickets apiece and Bas de Leede one.

But conceding an eye-watering 50 runs off the last three overs – bowled by de Leede, Dutt and van Meekeren - makes Netherlands’ task even harder than it might have been.

Dutt strikes again
Tom Latham fell for 53•Associated Press

With the third-to-last ball of his allocation, Aryan Dutt removes Tom Latham for 53 off 46 balls. Latham had brought up his fifty with a single off Paul van Meekeren in the previous over, but then charged down the pitch as Dutt pulled his length back and got the ball to turn away, leaving Latham stranded out of his crease as Scott Edwards completed the stumping. Dutt finishes with 2 for 62 from his 10 overs.

Dutt chimes in

Aryan Dutt's figures read 7-2-36-0 before he teamed up with Roelof van der Merwe to remove Mark Chapman, who was trying to break the shackles when he failed to clear deep backward point and van der Merwe took an excellent catch running back into the deep. Chapman falls for 5 off 13 balls and van der Merwe unleashes that trademark man-possessed wicket celebration. New Zealand have lost three wickets for 16 runs in the space of 24 balls.

Glenn Phillips' stay is short-lived as he follows Daryl Mitchell off. Phillips managed just 4 before Bas de Leede had him caught behind by Scott Edwards, diving to his right to collect after the batter chased one well outside off stump.

Then de Leede thought he had two wickets in two balls, another caught behind off Mark Chapman, who managed to overturn his dismissal using DRS as replays showed the ball brushed his hip but not the bat before it sailed down the leg side to Edwards.

Paul van Meekeren strikes with a sublime off-cutter, crashing into the top of off and middle stumps to remove Daryl Mitchell for 48. Mitchell faced 47 balls, with five fours and two 80m-plus sixes during his innings. His dismissal leaves NZ 238 for 4 in the 41st over.

After going for 12 runs in an over - thanks to three fours in a row to Tom Latham, Bas de Leede pulls it back, conceding just one run of his sixth over, the 38th of the match. In the meantime, Daryl Mitchell bookends Roelof van der Merwe's ninth over with a four and a huge six, some 86m over long on.

It's all happening!
van der Merwe strikes again•ICC via Getty Images

Rachin Ravindra survived again after he was struck on the right boot by Ryan Klein's dipping yorker. Netherlands captain Scott Edwards, behind the stumps, took an age to ask for a review, and it ended up being not out on umpire's call, with ball-tracking suggesting impact was right on leg stump. Ravindra responded by drilling Klein's next ball through extra cover for four.

More disappointment followed for Netherlands when debutant Sybrand Egelbrecht, known as a gun fielder, put down a sitter at short midwicket off Daryl Mitchell, on 22 at the time.

Ravindra then brought up his half-century running two on a misfield at deep point. But it was a case of fifty and out when Roelof van der Merwe struck again for his second wicket with Ravindra caught behind by Edwards.

Paul van Meekeren makes inroads for Netherlands this time, ending Will Young's innings on 70 from 80 balls. New Zealand are still in fine shape at 144 for 2 in the 27th over but that's a much-needed wicket for Netherlands as Young holes out to Bas de Leede at mid-on attempting to pull a shorter ball outside off stump.

Oooh, Netherlands could have had Rachin Ravindra out in single figures. Ravindra prodded a shorter Bas de Leede delivery towards mid-on and scurried through for a single but his bat got stuck as he struggled to make his ground and, had the throw in been on target, he was gone for all money. Ravindra survives with another chance to make the most of his local knowledge here in Hyderabad, as written by Shashank Kishore

There shall be no reprise of Devon Conway's 152 not out against England. He's just fallen to a fired-up Roelof van der Merwe, who enticed him down the pitch only to pick out Bas de Leede at wide long off via the toe-end of the bat. NZ are 67 for 1 as Conway departs for 32 off 40 deliveries.

Where does NZ's start rank?

This is from stats legend Sampath Bandarupalli: New Zealand is only the second team to take three or more overs to get off the mark in a ODI World Cup game since 1999 (the first edition where we have BBB for all matches). West Indies, in the opening game of the 2003 edition vs South Africa, got their first runs via wide after 3.1 overs.

Who is Sybrand Engelbrecht?
Sybrand Engelbrecht contemplating his debut ahead of this game?•ICC via Getty Images

Sybrand Engelbrecht, the Johannesburg-born 35-year-old, makes his international debut for Netherlands, who hope he can add some firepower with the bat a No. 7. He is perhaps better known as a gun fielder, having produced some stunning displays in the field for South Africa during the 2008 Under-19 World Cup.

He has 58 List A games to his name, scoring 1275 runs at an average of 45.53 and a strike rate of 78.89, plus 54 first-class games and 45 T20s. The last of those games was on the South African domestic circuit in 2016. Engelbrecht made 9 against Australia in a warm-up match ahead of this tournament.

Netherlands win toss and field first

Netherlands win the toss and bowl first. They're making two changes, Sybrand Engelbrecht is coming in for Saqib Zulfiqar and Ryan Klein replaces Logan van Beek, who was in doubt with a hamstring problem.

New Zealand captain Tom Latham says: "It looks a decent surface, hopefully we can put some runs on the board and defend later on." They've made one change, Lockie Ferguson returning from a back complaint to replace James Neesham.

Hello Hyderabad
Devon Conway during a nets session in Hyderabad•ICC via Getty Images

A warm welcome to our coverage of the Netherlands vs New Zealand clash in Hyderabad. The Black Caps are fresh off that nine-wicket thumping of defending champions England in their opening match, which has to go down in the books as an upset, even though the sides were sooooo close four years ago. We’re still not expecting to see Kane Williamson, who could return for New Zealand’s third game as he continues his return from an ACL injury, but Tim Southee (thumb) and Lockie Ferguson (back) are likely to be fit for this game.

For Netherlands, Logan Van Beek was in doubt for this match with a hamstring injury, so we’ll have to see what news the toss and team announcements bring on that front. The Dutch side gave a good account of themselves in defeat to Pakistan, despite the 81-run margin. Could they cause an upset here?

Hyderabad has historically seen some big totals and we’re not expecting any rain. While we await the toss, please check out our match preview.
