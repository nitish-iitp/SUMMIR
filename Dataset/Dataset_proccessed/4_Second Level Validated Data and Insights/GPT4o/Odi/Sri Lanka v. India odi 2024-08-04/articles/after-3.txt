India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd ODI, Highlights: Despite managing to tie the first ODI, Sri Lanka defeated India by 32 runs in the second ODI at Colombo on 4 August. Chasing a target of 241 runs, India could hardly managed to score 208 runs and were bowled out in 42.2 overs. With this win, Sri Lanka lead the three-match ODI series by 1-0.

For India, skipper Rohit Sharma scored 64 off 44 balls, while Axar Patel scored 44 off 44 deliveries. Shubman Gill scored 35 off 44 balls. Apart from this, no other batter could score breach 15 runs mark.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka wonderman Jeffrey Vandersay did some real magic by clicking 6 wickets. While Charith Asalanka picked up three wickets. Jeffrey Vandersay became the player of the match. 

According to stats, the defeat ends India's sequence of 11 consecutive bilateral series (2+ matches) wins in ODIs against Sri Lanka. The last time India failed to win a bilateral rubber against Sri Lanka was in December 1997, reported Cricbuzz.

Earlier, after winning the toss in the second ODI match against India at Colombo on 4 August, Sri Lanka posted a total of 241 runs to chase. Sri Lanka scored 240 after losing nine wickets.

For Sri Lanka, Avishka Fernando scored 40 runs, Dunith Wellalage smashed 39 runs. Kamindu Mendis hit 40 runs, while Kusal Mendis (30) and Charith Asalanka (25) contributed their bit.

For India, Washington Sundar picked up three wickets, while Kuldeep Yadav took two wickets. Axar Patel and Mohammed Siraj picked one wicket each.

After winning the toss at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on 4 August, Sri Lankan skipper Charith Asalanka has opted to bat first against India in the second ODI.

Rohit Sharma-led India will be hoping for a more consistent performance when they take on hosts Sri Lanka in Colombo today. Notably, the Men in Blue had drawn the first ODI after needing just 1 run off 14 balls, much to the disappointment of the Indian fans and skipper.

In the 1st ODI, the Indian bowlers did their job well, restricting Sri Lanka to 230/8 in their 50 overs. The score would have been even lower had Dunith Wellalage not played a counter-attacking knock of 67 runs to give his side the momentum they needed.

Team India started on a high thanks to a brilliant 33-ball half-century from the skipper and a supporting role for Shubman Gill. However, the Indian innings fell like a pack of cards after Rohit's dismissal and the Men in Blue found themselves in a precarious position at 132/5. Fortunately, some good innings from Axar Patel and Shivam Dube took them close to victory, needing just 1 run from 14 balls, but the successive wickets of Shivam Dube and Arshdeep Singh took the match out of India's grasp.

India and Sri Lanka playing XI:

Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis (WK), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka (C), Kamindu Mendis (reolacing Mohamed Shiraz), Janith Liyanage, Dunith Wellalage, Akila Dananjaya, Asitha Fernando, Jeffrey Vandersay (replacing Wanindu Hasaranga).

India playing XI: Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Washington Sundar, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Axar Patel, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh.
