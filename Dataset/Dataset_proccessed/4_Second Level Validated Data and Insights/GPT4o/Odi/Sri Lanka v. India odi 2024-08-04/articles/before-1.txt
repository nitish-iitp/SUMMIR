Preview

India and Sri Lanka played out a thrilling tie in the first ODI of the series where spinners from both teams dominated. Batting first, the Lankans posted a 230-run total on the back of 50s from Pathum Nissanka and Dunith Wellage. Chasing the total, Rohit Sharma and Shivam Dube fought well for India but the Men in Blue were all out when the scores were level after an inspiring spin-bowling performance from the hosts.

Analysis

Despite being heavy favourites against Sri Lanka, Team India struggled on the tricky Colombo wicket. The Indian batting saw Rohit Sharma perform but the likes of Virat Kohli, Shubhman Gill and others got starts but failed to convert them into big knocks. On the bowling front, the pacers struggled but Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar dominated in the Lankan spin-friendly conditions.

Talking about the hosts, Sri Lanka has recovered well after a poor T20I series with multiple players stepping up. The Lankan batting was carried by Pathum Nissanka and an enterprising Dunith Wellalage, who performed well with the ball as well. But the Lankans need Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama and Charith Asalanka to score consistently. Looking at the Lankan bowling, without Maheesh Theekshana and Matheesha Pathirana, Wellalage, Akila Dananjaya, and Wanindu Hasaranga stepped up with the captain Charith Asalanka even picking up a 3-fer.
