SL Win By 32 Runs | India vs Sri Lanka Highlights of 2nd ODI 2024: Jeffrey Vandersay, Charith Asalanka Inspire Sri Lanka to Memorable Victory, Hosts Go 1-0 Up

That's it! Sri Lanka have done it and won this match by 32 runs! What a win this has been for the Sri Lankan team on the back of an inspired bowling effort once again. It is a massive confidence booster for the island nation as they attain a 1-0 lead in this series. India started well like the last match but the openers' departure was followed by a middle-order collapse. Washington Sundar and Axar Patel tried to bring India back into the game with a 38-run stand but once again, India lost both wickets in no time and in the end, it was too much left to do for the tail. India would need to look into their batting and come up with a much-improved performance in the third ODI if they are to level the series.

India National Cricket Team vs Sri Lanka National Cricket Team 2nd ODI Live: Rohit Sharma and Co will be looking to go the extra mile to clinch their first win in the ODI series against Sri Lanka as both sides shared spoils in the first match. Bowlers took control of the match played on a tricky surface as Sri Lanka managed to defend the 231-run target in a dominated era. Dunith Wellalage, who scored 67 runs topping all the batters in the match, will look to provide a similar output at the very venue, while Rohit Sharma who led India’s chase will seek help from star batters like Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and opening partner Shubman Gill to give India a chance in the 2nd ODI. India Captain Rohit Sharma Looks To Break Multiple Batting Records During 2nd ODI Against Sri Lanka.

As mentioned earlier bowlers, especially spinners dominated the game-play dictating the pace and outcome of the match with some decisive wickets. But Sri Lan will be without Wanindu Hasaranga, who will be out due to injury. This could be a major blow for the home side as Wanindu Hasaranga was their pick of the bowlers and was also handy with the bat. Jeffrey Vandersay is named as Hasaranga’s replacement but is not confirmed in the starting XI. Wanindu Hasaranga Ruled Out of Remainder of India vs Sri Lanka ODI Series Due to Hamstring Injury, Jeffrey Vandersay Named Replacement

As for the Indian side, there are no major changes or injury updates till now and fans can expect a fairly similar lineup for the 2nd ODI match. They will look to topple the ‘uneven’ nature of the pitch with the bat. Skipper Charith Asalanka will be the key player for Sri Lanka in the middle-order while other key batters like Kusal Mendis, Pathum Nissanka, and Sadeera Samarawickrama all need to contribute well. For the star-studded visitors, apart from Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, young guns like Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill need to step up while it will be either K L Rahul or Rishabh Pant behind the stumps. Check out the live score between India vs Sri Lanka.
