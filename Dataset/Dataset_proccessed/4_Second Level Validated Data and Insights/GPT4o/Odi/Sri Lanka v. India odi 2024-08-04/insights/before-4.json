        "India will look to be on top of its game in all three departments while the hosts would want their middle-order to fire.",
        "The pitch for the first game aided spinners considerably, and once the ball became soft, boundaries were hard to come by.",
        "Sri Lankan interim head coach Sanath Jayasuriya said on the eve of the opening game that he hoped to get good surfaces suitable for one-day cricket.",
        "India will rue the first outing as a missed opportunity in not taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series despite dominating most phases of the game.",
        "The Indian bowlers were largely impressive, and skipper Rohit Sharma showed no signs of rustiness on his return to ODIs for the first time since the heartbreaking defeat in the World Cup final against Australia last November.",
        "Once the spinners came on, most Indian batters struggled to rotate the strike, and the boundaries dried up. The team will look to improve in this area and establish a few more enduring partnerships.",
        "The first ODI also gave a glimpse of what the team is looking to build under new coach Gautam Gambhir.",
        "The penchant for having more than a few left-handed batters was visible, with Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, and Shivam Dube forming the core of the middle order.",
        "With K.L. Rahul continuing to keep wickets, India seems to be prioritising having the cushion of a sixth bowler over Rishabh Pant\u2019s X-factor for now.",
        "The hosts continue to fret over a fragile middle-order that continues to struggle against the Indian tweakers.",
        "Without Dunith Wellalage\u2019s lower-order resistance, the Lions were in danger of being bundled out cheaply.",
        "Sri Lanka received another injury blow after leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga was ruled out of the remaining two fixtures due to a hamstring injury he suffered during the first ODI.",
        "Fellow leggie Jeffrey Vandersay has been named as Hasaranga\u2019s replacement."
