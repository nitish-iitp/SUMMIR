Australia vs Netherlands World Cup 2023: Glenn Maxwell struck the fastest century of the World Cup, while David Warner hit second successive ton as Australia thrashed Netherlands by a massive 309 runs. Australia's win was the biggest in the World Cup in terms of margin of runs
Australia vs Netherlands Live Score Updates, World Cup 2023: Australia's Mitchell Starc (2L) celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Netherlands' Max O'Dowd during the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between Australia and Netherlands at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. (AFP)

Australia vs Netherlands Updates, World Cup 2023: Australia hammered the Netherlands by 309 runs in New Delhi on Wednesday in a record World Cup rout as Glenn Maxwell hit the fastest century in tournament history.

Maxwell's hundred came off just 40 balls with his innings of 106 powering Australia to 399-8, a total their bowlers defended, bowling out the Dutch for 90 in 21 overs.

David Warner also played a key part with 104 for his sixth ton at the 50-over showpiece as Australia bettered their previous margin of World Cup victory -- against Afghanistan by 275 runs at Perth in 2015. Wrist spinner Adam Zampa picked four wickets for eight runs in three overs for Australia, as it cemented third place with six points from three wins in five games.

The margin of victory was the largest (by runs) in World Cup history and it sharply elevated Australia’s net run-rate from -0.193 to 1.142.

Glenn Maxwell slammed fastest 100 is the history of ICC World Cup as his ton came on just 40 balls. David Warner, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne are the other heroes in Australia 399/8 finish against Netherlands. Logan van Beek clinched 4 wickets while Bas de Leede clinched 2 wickets, but gave 115 runs

Netherlands spinner Aryan Dutt dismissed Steve Smith to end his strong partnership with David Warner. Marnus Labuschagne is the new batter on crease and Netherlands will get back some control in the game now. 

Australia's David Warner and Steve Smith are playing in wonderful partnership and smashed their respective half-centuries. Netherlands bowlers are desperately chasing wickets as the experienced batters settle on the crease. 

Netherlands pacer Logan van Beek dismissed Mitchell Marsh early to get a head start in the game. David Warner is looking dangerous while Steve Smith is the new batter on the ground. 

Australia are gearing up to lock horns with the Netherlands in their fifth match of the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023. Though for different reasons, this is an important game for each of these teams. Australia's campaign has been inconsistent. After initial losses to South Africa and India, the Aussies have now bounced back to defeat Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

On the other hand, despite having only won once in their last four games, the Dutch have already proven to be formidable opponents, having defeated South Africa in the tournament's opening round.

In their head-to-head World Cup encounter back in 2007, Australia dominated the Netherlands, a match that included standout performances from Brad Hodge and Brad Hogg. Today's battle offers the Dutch an opportunity to alter the historical narrative. 

The Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium itself brings another layer of unpredictability to the contest. Once a paradise for spinners, the pitch has undergone a transformation. The introduction of black-soil pitches has balanced the scales, making it a batter-friendly ground. As for the tournament's games hosted at this venue, the results have been decisively one-sided, favouring the winning side with enormous margins.

The statistics at Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium are intriguing. In 29 ODIs played here, 14 were won by the team batting first, and an equal number were claimed by the side chasing, with one match ending inconclusively. With such evenly balanced stats, both teams will be calculating their strategies meticulously, taking the pitch conditions into account.

As Australia aim to bolster their shaky campaign, the Netherlands eye another monumental upset to add more flavour to this World Cup saga. As the teams square off, it's anyone's guess whether the Australian cricketing machine will continue its resurgence or if the Dutch underdogs will rewrite the history books. In a tournament already brimming with multiple upsets, this clash promises to be an enthralling chapter.

Australia Final XI

Mitchell Marsh, David Warner, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (WK), Glenn Maxwell, Pat Cummins (C), Cameron Green, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa and Josh Hazlewood.

Netherlands Final XI

Vikramjit Singh, Max O’Dowd, Colin Ackermann, Bas de Leede, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Teja Nidamanuru, Scott Edwards (C and WK), Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe, Aryan Dutt and Paul van Meekeren.
