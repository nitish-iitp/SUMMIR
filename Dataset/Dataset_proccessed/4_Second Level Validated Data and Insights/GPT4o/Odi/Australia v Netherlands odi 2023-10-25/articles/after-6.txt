That's all from our text commentary team. Enjoy the Live show with Cheteshwar Pujara and Shane Bond. See you tomorrow for more ICC Men's ODI World Cup action.

Pat Cummins, Australia capt: (Assessment) Just about the complete game. Couldn't be happier. (Maxwell's innings) That was crazy. Thought we both contributed equally in that 100-run partnership [laughs]. (Smith, Labuschagne runs) We are starting to play to our potential and play in the style we talk about. We had another good batting powerplay. (Bowling powerplay wickets) Its what we are aiming for. We've bowled quite well but without a lot of luck. Zampa, another four-for. (New Zealand next) Prepped as good as we can be. They are a good side. They've played in Dharamsala before. Its a big game, its a World Cup. (Better next game - what?) Haven't nailed 50 overs in the batting. Something to work on."

Scott Edwards, Netherlands capt: (Challenges with the bat) Defending 400, yeah, they've got world-class bowlers and we should've been better today. (Bowling during Maxwell assault) Execution obviously. You miss by fractions and you're going out of the park. Full credit to their batting line-up. We almost got in there with 10 overs to go and pick up Maxwell but we couldn't stop him. (Bowling at Delhi) Pretty nice wicket and ball travels. So that means margins are small. (Dutch opening partnership) Those two have been awesome for us in 18 months. They're a big reason we're here. We're backing them all the way. Just want batting to click last four games. (Bangladesh game) Look at a few things from this game but otherwise move on quickly.

David Warner on TV: Special moment for Maxwell. Great to get the fifty and get the hundred. Signal to rock the cradle (for his infant baby) was special. (Two hundreds back to back) Its about timing and rhythm. You have to allow yourself to do that in these tracks. First game against India in Chennai was always going to be a challenge. In Lucknow, the timing wasn't there too. But then I've backed myself and having control and batting those 50 overs. (Running b/w the wickets, intensity) I pride myself on my fitness - think its part of my game. You see Virat does it a lot as well. You've got to have that inside you, its an attitude thing. (Aryan Dutt over - four boundaries, square cut) I was trying to work out where the gap was and how to pierce the gap. I was thinking of playing the reverse sweep but they were bowling it short. Helped get us into a rhythm. (Sixth WC hundred, equaling Sachin and passing Ponting) Its about going out there and do my best. I get up for tournament play and live for World Cups. You have to really shine on this stage. You have to emulate what you do in bilaterals over here. In this moment, we are staying in the present. Might enjoy that 20 years on. (Zampa's bowling) Proud of him. He was under some issues - back spasms etc. We were having a laugh that we should change his bowling to 'right-arm googlies'. Good to see him landing them on the spot. Good confidence before the NZ game. (Powerplay wickets) The ball was swinging, the boys hit those lengths, and get to penetrate them through to the keeper."

Om Pashupati : "Funny things happening with England over the last 3 days. Without even playing any game, their ranking seems to change with the result of other games - 10th, 9th and now 8th :)"

Glenn Maxwell is the POTM: (Fastest WC hundred record) Not something I set out to do. Just situation of the game. Wanted to put a good platform for the back end and cash in on this ground. Ball can run away quite quickly. Nice to get in rhythm. (What clicked) Just making good decisions. Give myself a little bit of time and give myself a bit of confidence and platform. (Going forward) Huge confidence booster knowing I've got that in my locker. Doubts can creep in when not scoring consistently but good to score this. (Clinical?) Close to the perfect game if you score 400 and bowl them out for under 100. Lot of guys got to have a hit. We've had three really good wins in a row."

8.25pm A mauling in Delhi is how you'd describe this Australian victory. The five-time champions earn two points, get a massive NRR boost, and are once again on course for a spot in the semis if they continue this way.

A target of 400 was always going to be daunting and all we wanted to see was how Netherlands would respond to the target. Well, they tried, but they didn't have a good first batting powerplay. After that, the wickets just kept tumbling, and Zampa then ran through the tail. Zampa now has the most wickets at the 2023 WC (13).

Earlier today, we witnessed more records tumbling as Glenn Maxwell hit the fastest WC hundred of all time (in 40 balls) while also recording the fourth-fastest ODI ton. That nearly made us forget the well-constructed 22nd ODI hundred - his sixth in WCs - struck by David Warner, along with half-centuries from Smith and Labuschagne.

Graham : "As tough it is for the Dutch players and fans, this is prob a good thing for them, to show them how much work they need to do to play consistently with the power house teams. "

Zampa to van Meekeren, OUT

Is he stumped around his legs? Full ball outside leg. van Meekeren tries the sweep but misses. Ball goes perilously close past leg stump, and Zampa is groaning that it didn't clip. But maybe Inglis has whipped the bails off with the No. 11 out of his crease. Oh he hasn't stumped the batter at all. The ball popped out of Inglis' gloves but ricocheted onto the stumps. Bizarre dismissal to end the game as Zampa finishes with 4-8. A hat-trick of four-fors for Zampa as Australia complete the largest victory in WC history - 309 runs

Zampa to Dutt, OUT

Running through the tail! Full but not very. Dutt goes back foot to play it. Ball zips in, and hits him in front of middle stump with the No. 10 attempting a defensive shot. Zampa's a happy camper

Zampa to Dutt, no run

Googly. Full ball around off. But Dutt gets an inside edge onto his pads while defending

Delay because Dutt has to send the helmet back. He walked in with the wrong one. Fitting is important. Camera pans to Dutch fans who look dejected. Can Zampa join Brett Lee as an Aussie men's WC hat-trick taker?

Zampa to van der Merwe, OUT

He's been googled! Full ball outside off but turning in, and zipping in sharply after pitching. Roelof got forward to fend but Zampa proved to be too hot. Went past the bat's inside edge and clipped the front leg. Roelof reviews but the TV umpire confirms that's crashing into middle stump. Zampa on a hat-trick
