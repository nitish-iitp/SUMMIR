The Big Show they call him. A big show he gave them.

Glenn Maxwell on Wednesday produced one of the most astonishing displays of batting in recent times, as he broke the record for the fastest ever World Cup hundred by nine balls. His 106 off 44 balls (9x4, 8x6) stunned the unfortunate Netherlands bowlers as well as the fortunate 18,000-odd spectators that came to watch the match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.
