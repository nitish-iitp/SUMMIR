That’s it from us on this OBO today, ta to Rob for getting up with the lark for the early stint and thanks for tuning in. The 2023 World Cup rumbles on for another week… You can catch England and Australia slugging it out right now with the marvellous Tanya currently on the OBO tools.

We’ll then be back for the tournament’s top two sides going toe-to toe tomorrow (try saying that ten times quickly) loins well and truly girded for India v South Africa at Eden Gardens. Have a nice afternoon, ta-ra.

Here’s (a beaming) Babar Azam:

When we started batting, we believed. Inside the dressing room we said that we needed one good partnership. In the back of our minds we knew that rain was coming, but didn’t expect it to be too much. To be honest, we just planned to build a partnership. I wanted to give strike to Fakhar! We knew we had short boundaries and tried to utilise that. In some matches we’ve not been up to the mark, if we win our next match, let’s see... we will try to play positively and we are taking it match by match.”

Kane Williamson speaks:

It’s quite hard to get our heads around (the result) after getting that total, for us we will take the positives before the next game. Pakistan played exceptionally well, gave themselves every chance and got over the line, they were certainly on target with their chase.

“Fakhar Zaman played beautifully, they deserved that result today and for us it’s about moving on to our next challenge. We had a lot of really good partnerships, it was clearly a very good surface and that can be tough on the bowlers. Rachin batted absolutely beautifully and we hope that continues! There are some really good signs from the unit, maybe if we got a few wickets things could have changed quickly.”

Fakhar Zaman is the player of the match. Thoughts and prayers to Rachin Ravindra who scored his third century of the tournament and to New Zealand’s players in general as they posted over 400 runs but still lost.

Fakhar’s knock really gave the Kiwis the willies, it was an amazing innings made all the more impressive considering he’s only just been drafted into the starting XI. He boshed 126* peppering the boundaries and the stands with eight fours and a nosebleed inducing eleven sixes. Trent Boult was very expensive with the ball at the start of the Pakistan innings and as soon as the spin of Santner, Sodhi and Phillips was called for it was carnage out in the middle, Fakhar clearing the front leg and repeatedly smearing the ball high and long into the Bengalaru night.

Fakhar speaks:

We planned to see off first few overs, I got lucky a few times but really enjoyed this innings. We know that every game is do or die for us. In our team meetings it was decided that we will play aggressively, we are playing with that mind and everybody was trying to score more runs.

“This is one of my best centuries, I will always remember my 193 against South Africa but this is one of my best. We want to continue playing aggressively in our next game.

The umpires call time in Bengalaru with the rain coming down hard and steady. The players have shaken hands and both sides now sit on eight points!

Wow 😮‍💨

Fakhar Zaman's stunning unbeaten 126* from just 81 balls has helped his side beat New Zealand by 21 runs via DLS and keep their chances of qualification alive!

“This equation doesn’t seem to take into account that they’re chasing 400! One more wicket and they’re cooked.” Says Cole Hunter in the OBO mailbag.

“The DLS allows the chasing team to alter their game to suit the conditions and the bowling team are expected to just ride the wave. Tough but fair...”

True enough Cole, DLS can sometimes make life simpler for the batting side, remember South Africa needing 21 off one ball at Sydney in 1992 though? That was a preeety big ask.

Rain Stops Play (Again)

No! The light drizzle falling for the last over or so got a bit heavier and the umpires signalled for the covers half way through Daryll Mitchell’s first and New Zealand’s 26th over.

Pakistan are now 21 runs ahead on DLS and the overs will start to dissolve with every minute that the players are off the park, that will only serve to benefit the team in green.

25th over: Pakistan 199-1 (Zaman 125, Babar 66) Sodhi is launched for six into the stands by Babar Azam, the batter read the googly and murdered it. A single brings Fakhar onto strike. SIX! Fakhar drops to one knee and slogs a monsterous sweep over the leg side boundary. SIX MORE! Same shot and this one even bigger! The sound off the bat echoing around the M Chinaswammy Stadium like a canon shot. Twenty runs off the over, Pakistan flying.

24th over: Pakistan 179-1 (Zaman 112, Babar 59) Boult strays onto Fakhar’s pads and is clipped away for four through midwicket. Boult has been uncharacteristically poor today and has the face of someone in a real huff. His face in a permanent scowl, ‘looking like his top lip has gone bad’ as my old man is wont to say. Seven runs off the over.

23rd over: Pakistan 172-1 (Zaman 107, Babar 57) Ish Sodhi from the other end, he starts with a poor ball – a long-hop that is pounced on by Babar and steered for four to bring up his half century, barely a tilt of the bat. Pakistan’s captain knows there is work to do. Beautiful from Babar! The next ball is flighted and he drives it languidly for four through the covers, holding the pose for good measure. Twelve runs off the over in total, New Zealand need wickets pronto.

22nd over: Pakistan 159-1 (Zaman 106, Babar 47) Here come the players, Trent Boult has three balls left in his fifth over and he starts with… three dots. The rate rises with every one but Pakistan won’t mind this re-adjusted target.

182 runs off 117 balls on a placid pitch and fast outfield with 9 wickets in hand. Advantage Pak you’d say?

Righto, the numbers have been crunched in Bengalaru:

Nine overs have been lost to the rain so it will be a 41-over chase.

The target for Pakistan is 342. They need 182 runs from 19.3 overs and have nine wickets in hand.

Game on!

342 needed from 41 overs for Pakistan. So 182 from 19.3 overs. Effectively a T20 game with Pakistan having 9 wickets in hand. The New Zealand players will head out to the field in 15 minutes. Who's winning...? #PAKvNZ

In Ahmedabad, Australia have set England a target of 287 runs.

I’m not sure Jos Buttler’s eyes can get more sad but if his side fail to get the runs then England will need to win both of their remaining games to have a chance of qualifying for the next Champions Trophy in 2025.

It’s basically all heading towards the Dutch beating England on Wednesday eh? I can taste it already. Orange Crush.

It lives. It breathes. It walks around. Although, it should be said, with a limp, and a wheeze, and a telling sense of glassiness behind the eyes…

No England team has ever lost so many games at a World Cup. No England team has ever reached the stage of outright tournament bottom-feeders. No England team has ever made the startling nosedive from 50-over champions to one of the worst iterations at any World Cup – and better still done so without any obvious process, warning signs, change of approach, or indeed the slightest clue as to how this could have happened.”

Permutations chat: If New Zealand beat Pakistan today (big if at the moment) then England are categorically OUT. It doesn’t matter if they beat Australia. It’s curtains for Buttler and his men, finally. The sweet release of death.

If Pakistan win then England are somehow still IN if they beat Australia. If Australia beat England then it is curtains for them whatever happens elsewhere.

Got it? Clear as custard.

Gah. The covers are hauled on as a shower passes over the ground in Bengalaru. There looks to be a stiff breeze so hopefully it beggars off soon and we can get back to this fascinating match.

Pakistan are 160-1 off 21.3 overs – Righto, let me get my DLS on… yep Pakistan are ahead of the rate by ten runs. DLS is showing the par score to be 150-1.

The break will be welcome to New Zealand though, they can re-gather and lick their wounds. The big question for Pakistan if they get back out there is whether Fakhar can simply pick up where he left off. It’s an intriguing situation however you splice it.

Off just 64 balls. What a knock! He peels off his helmet, kneels and kisses the pitch. Fantastic scenes. Fakhar is giving Pakistan hope in this World Cup.

18th over: Pakistan 127-1 (Zaman 85, Babar 35) Cat and mouse stuff between Santner and Fakhar, the spinner wins the over as just two runs are taken off it. Fakhar is itching to smear him away for boundaries but Santner mixes up his length and flight masterfully. Time for a drink – apparently Pakistan are two runs behind where they need to be (129-1) if they were to go off for rain now. I’ll keep a peeper on those clouds and those sums.

Fakhar slots his first ball over long-on for SIX! Boult is well out of sorts here, he spears a ball way down leg for a wide. Babar gets a thick edge through the vacant slip region to pick up four and then punches on the front foot to score a boundary off the last ball. Cripes, Trent.

Pakistan need to get off to a flier, the required run rate is teetering around eight an over. Boult starts with two dots before Shafique flicks the third ball away over mid-wicket for four! Boult responds with an inswinging yorker that Shafique does well to dig out. A wide ball outside off gifts Pakistan another, they need all the help they can get, this would comfortably be their biggest ever ODI chase if they manage to pull it off. Big if. Five off the first over, hangover waning, life is good acceptable!

Where to start? With Rachin Ravindra, of course. He top-scored with a charming 108, his third century of a never-to-be-forgotten World Cup debut, and added 180 for the second wicket with Kane Williamson in less than 23 overs. Williamson was eye-catchingly fluent on his return, hitting 95 from 79 balls.

That platform allowed the bovver boys in the middle order to cause mayham, and all bar Tom Latham (who faced only two balls) scored at a strike rate of at least 140.

Pakistan’s bowling performance was imperfect, with Shaheen Afridi (10-0-90-0) and Haris Rauf (10-0-85-1) bowling the two most expensive spells in their World Cup history. Hasan Ali went for 82 as well, but the youngster Mohammad Wasim was outstanding and took 3/60.

The pitch is much better than expected, certainly when the quicks are bowling, but it’s hard to see how Pakistan – who have never chased 350 to win an ODI, never mind 400 – can pull this off. Not least because New Zealand have four spinners.

“You say it so casually that it almost hides the bizarreness - that New Zealand have made their highest score ever in a World Cup,” says Nick Parish. “Against Pakistan, in the sub-continent. Consider all the matches they’ve played against Zimbabwe, Ireland, Bangladesh over the years. Not to mention England…”

I think I’m punch-drunk after four weeks of OBOing these run-orgies. Also, in fairness, the way Conway and Ravindra were batting against England, they’d probably have made 500 if necessary.

Pakistan need 402 to stay in the World Cup!

50th over: New Zealand 401-6 (Santner 26, Latham 2) Santner drives Afridi’s third-last delivery magnificently over long off for six, a shot that breaks two records. This is now New Zealand’s highest score at a World Cup, and Afridi has stolen Haris Rauf’s hard-earned record for the worst figures by a Pakistan bowler in a World Cup game.

Santner pilfers three off the last two balls, which takes New Zealand past 400 and just short of their highest ODI score of 402. And I don’t know whether I’ve mentioned this before, but Pakistan bloody well put them into bloody bat.

49th over: New Zealand 388-6 (Santner 15, Latham 1) Tom Latham tucks Wasim’s final ball for a single. Wasim, by far the pick of the bowlers, finishes with 10-0-60-3.

WICKET! New Zealand 388-6 (Phillips b Wasim 18)

Santner swipes Wasim over long-off for six, yet another boundary off the first ball of an over. A savage slap through the covers gives Phillips four more – but again Wasim’s response is impressive. He knows Phillips is backing away so he arrows a very wide delivery just inside the tramlines.

Wasim tries again next ball but goes too wide. So he changes his approach and follows Phillips with an attempted yorker that hits the pad and deflects back onto the stumps. Lovely stuff from a fine young bowler, and the end of a seriously hard-hitting innings: 41 from 25 balls with four fours and two sixes.

48th over: New Zealand 376-5 (Phillips 37, Santner 8) Santner is dropped by Salman Ali Agha, a very tough diving chance on the edge of the circle. A hitherto excellent over from Afridi, full of variations, is ruined when Phillips clubs a low full toss over long-on for six.

New Zealand need 18 from 12 balls to make their highest score at a World Cup, and 27 for their highest ODI total.

47th over: New Zealand 366-5 (Phillips 30, Santner 6) Amid the rubble, Pakistan appear to have found one in Mohammad Wasim*. He concludes another fine over – four singles, one two – by beating Phillips for pace.

Pakistan are running over in the field, which means they will be allowed four outside the circle for the last three overs.

* Mind you, I thought the same about Basit Ali in the Caribbean in 1992-93. You rarely know in sport, and you never know when it comes to Pakistan cricket.
