It’s a wrap

If it wasn’t for the numerous rain delays, we could have had ourselves an all-time World Cup classic in Bengaluru.

Zaman and Babar played magnificently to keep Pakistan in the hunt after New Zealand posted a staggering 401 runs.

With this result, Pakistan now draw level with New Zealand on eight points but are still behind on net run rate.

The Men in Green will now hope to beat England while praying that Sri Lanka are able to win against New Zealand in their matchup.

There are still many permutations at play, so we should be in for an exciting week ahead as we near the completion of the group stage.

We hope you enjoyed our coverage of this fascinating encounter, and on behalf of Patrick Keddie and Kevin Hand, this is Rohan Sharma signing off.

‘We have got some momentum now’

Pakistan’s skipper was in good spirits after the match:

“When we came into the dressing room [after the first innings], we passed on the message that we needed one good partnership. I told Fakhar that he needs to bat till the end, so all credit to Fakhar.”

“We planned to build partnerships. I just tried to give maximum strike to Fakhar. We knew we can utilise the short boundaries,” Babar said.

“We tried to give our 100%, but a few matches we were not up the mark. We have got some momentum now from the Bangladesh match and today. We are taking it match by match, and we will try our best to play positive cricket [for the remainder of the tournament].”

‘Ground wasn’t big enough for Fakhar’

The New Zealand captain offered his views post-match:

“It was a nice first half. A little bit of weather played its part, [but we] can’t take away how the Pakistan top order came out.”

“The ground wasn’t big enough for Fakhar [Zaman], and he played an exceptional knock. [We] just need to take the positives into the next match,” Williamson said.

“They gave themselves every chance. I suppose having the match shortened brings both teams closer together, but they were certainly on target for their chase.”

“Would have been nice to have the full 50 [overs]. Full credit to them as they deserved their result today.”

‘Thankfully, it was my day’

Zaman, who was named player of the match for his unbeaten 126 off 81 balls, shared his thoughts:

“We were chasing 400, so our plan was to see off the first few overs. Thankfully, it was my day. A few times, I felt very lucky. I really enjoyed this innings.”

“We know every game is important for us [from now on]. In the team meeting, our management decided we should play aggressively, so we are playing with that mindset. Everyone is trying to score more runs,” he said.

“This is one of the best [innings I have played], but I will always remember my 193 against South Africa. New Zealand is a great side so this is definitely one of my best. We want to play aggressive cricket onwards.”

Match called off!

With time coming up, the match has been officially called off in Bengaluru.

With that announcement, Pakistan win by 21 runs (DLS method) and heighten their chances somewhat as they move level with New Zealand on eight points in the World Cup table.

They are still behind their opponents as a result of net run rate, and will need some other results to go in their favour if they are to sneak into a semifinal spot.

Australia-England match update

With the rain delay, fans will be tempted to tune into the other big match which is being played currently in Ahmedabad.

After Australia were bowled out for 286, England are currently 38-2 after 10 overs.

Ben Stokes and David Malan are out in the middle, with England requiring 249 to win in order to reignite their semifinal hopes.

Legends have their say

Wow, what a run chase. This is what Fakhar Zaman can do if he comes off. He wins unwinnable matches and Pakistan must wonder why he cannot marry consistency to his destructive powers. But today, he is putting his team firmly back in the tournament.

— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) November 4, 2023

If Pakistan wins it through DLS today. Its not a fluke or just good luck, its earned through immense conviction & intent.
