Which means we’re done here. England now go to Kolkata, where they’ll meet Pakistan on Satdee – who, remember, are playing for a semi against India. That’d be a nice quiet night in at the library. Not! I don’t think! But I’m off, so thanks for your company and comments – sorry I didn’t use them all – peace out.

Woakes tells Sky the players are desperate to perform, laughing that England have lost to Netherlands before – though in T20, never an ODI – and he’s pleased with how the team played. The ball swung and moved around under lights but you still had to put it in the right area – if you didn’t, you went. He aimed to hit the top of off as much as possible, and if they hit him off that length than that’s what they’d have to do. I imagine rushing things has become a dressing-room refrain, because like Stokes, he reckons England tried too many things too early when, in the powerplay, hitting the top of off is all you need to do, and there’s always more time left in the game than you think.

Buttler’s really happy with the win, saying any time you need someone to stand up, Stokes does that. He thought 33 was a really good score – though the track was decent and boundaries short – then, asked if he’d do things differently given he opted to bat today, he notes that his players still played poorly and perhaps the pressure of the World Cup is making runs on the board more important than usual. Otherwise, he’s looking forward to England’s final match against Pakistan, especially given Champions Trophy qualification might depend on how they do in it.

Scott Edwards says his team didn’t start well, giving away too many runs, and their innings was the same old story with the bat. He wonders if his bowlers might’ve changed plans, but credits England for batting well, then says his side have been good in patches, as they were today, but need to find a way of sustaining that.

I was just about to investigate this, so thanks to John Starbuck for saving me the bother: “For a bit of added drama, TMS have just declared that England need to keep Netherlands at 271 or under (I think) to benefit their Net Run Rate figure,” he advises, and we’re just shown the table: it’s improved to -0.88. That takes them above Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, -1.142 and -1.160 respectively and, given they play Australia and NZ in their final matches, England, now seventh in the table, should make the Champions Trophy even if they lose to Pakistan.

Ben Stokes is player of the match and of course tries to meh his debut World Cup ton, saying he’s more pleased to get a win – at last. The pitch was a goodun, he reckons, and just back of a length the bounce was tennis-ball – helpful for leg-side swats – and he used the scoreboard as his friend, looking up at it if ever he felt under pressure to remind himself that there were more balls remaining than he though. Otherwise, he praises Woakes’ all-round ability and recent record then, asked if he thought about going home, responds as you expect: “Never leave anyone hanging”.

Netherlands lost their last five wickets for 16, and this feels like the kind of match we ought really to have seen more often in this competition. I know it’s the end of the road for this England side, but it remains a side absolutely rammed with brilliant, transcendent players, this competition just came at the wrong time for it.

WICKET! Van Meekeren st Buttler b Ali 4 (Netherlands 179 all out)

Van Meekeren comes down to play a monstrous drive down the wrong line, misses, and is stumped by a magnificent margin.

37th over: Netherlands 178-9 (Nidamanuru 40, Van Meekeren 4) Lovely from Van Meekeren, who gets well forward to smother spin – whichever way it goes – with a sweep for four through deep backward square. Meantime, last over Nas noted Jimmy Anderson has just one shot, the reverse; an angry riposte is already steaming up his phone.

WICKET! Dutt b Rashid 1 (Netherlands 174-9)

Tailenders despise wrist-spinners! This is a luscious delivery, a googly given plenty of air before bouncing a little lower than Dutt expected before ripping through his unattended gate.

37th over: Netherlands 174-8 (Nidamanuru 40, Dutt 1) I’ve really enjoyed Nidamanuru’s knock today – he’s picking length really well, notes Morgan in co-comms. And here he is again, pulling the first delivery of this latest Rashid over for four through midwicket; a single to that area follows.

36th over: Netherlands 169-8 (Nidamanuru 35, Dutt 1) Dutt gets away with a force to cover, then Nidamanuru turns one to midwicket.

WICKET! Van der Merwe c Rashid b Ali 0 (Netherlands 167-8)

One brings two! Moeen follows his freshman wicket with a sophomore effort, Van der Merwe trying a reverse-sweep and gloving to short fine leg.

16.31 CET

35th over: Netherlands 166-7 (Nidamanuru 33, Van der Merwe 0) Rashid welcomes Van de Merwe to the wicket with a terrific googly and hits the pad; again, the appeal is rejected as I think the ball was missing leg.

WICKET! Van Beek c Malan b Rashid 2 (Netherlands 166-7)

Van Beek tries a sweep and edges a sitter instead.

35th over: Netherlands 166-6 (Nidamanuru 33, Van Beek 2) Three dots, then the impressive Nidamunuru forces over midwicket and they run one; responsibility for bringing Netherlands home from here rests with him, but compared to what we saw yesterday, it’s a fairly simple activity, so.

WICKET! Edwards c Malan b Ali 38 (Netherlands 163-6)

Edwards sprints down but as he imparts his heave, the bat twists in his hand and he spoons a simple catch. That’s Moeen’s first wicket of the tournament.

34th over: Netherlands 163-5 (Edwards 38, Nidamanuru 32) Nidamanuru turns one to deep square, then Edwards misses with a sweep and England contemplate a review when ball contacts pad before rightly opting not to bother, presumably because they knew, as Hawkeye shows, ball was bouncing over stumps.

16.21 CET

33rd over: Netherlands 162-5 (Edwards 38, Nidamanuru 31) Rashid returns from the other end and Edwards miscues a slog-sweep so they run one, then a handsome drive to cover yields a well-run two. Three singles complete the over and Buttler is letting this drift – fine, because England are going to win – but I’m not sure Stokes would be bowling his spinners now, given how well the openers did.

32nd over: Netherlands 156-5 (Edwards 36, Nidamanuru 28) Moeen returns, but with so many runs still required – 192 at the start of this over – I’m Buttler, I’m thinking about bringing back Woakes and Willey to try and finish this while addressing England’s net run-rate woes. All the more so when, after two dots and two singles, Nidamanuru waits for one, a little step down and across making room for him to swing iside-out over long off for six! That’s the 50 partnership, off 38 balls, and after a single it’s time for drinks.

31st over: Netherlands 148-5 (Edwards 35, Nidamanuru 21) Two dots, then Edwards stretches to drive from outside off through mid-on, and he’s enjoying this now! Another dot, then another four – this time carted to deep backward square via pull! Maybe he needs to injure himself to unleash his inner Maxi.

16.07 CET

30th over: Netherlands 140-5 (Edwards 27, Nidamanuru 20) It feels like we know what’s going to happen here: Netherlands will find a few decent hits, but will also keep losing wickets before any partnership can seriously threaten even the prospect of a prospect of victory. Two singles and a leg bye off this latest Rashid over.

“At the risk of exciting more opprobrium, it’s ‘googly’ not ‘goggly’,” says John Starbuck, “though I do seem to recall Michael Parkinson, in his ‘Cricket Mad’ book, telling us that’s what his young son called the ball he’d just bowled his father with: ‘that was my goggly’, so you maybe have a precedent.”

My typos are unprecedented, though I’ll never beat the time I talked about someone cutting a shot, except the first t of cutting and the o in shot were replaced by different letters. That’s what they call muscle-memory.

29th over: Netherlands 137-5 (Edwards 25, Nidamanuru 20) Atkinson drops way too short and straight and Nidamanuru doesn’t need asking twice, swinging with the path of the ball to send six way over square leg and a fair way back too. Two singles follow, and runs are coming more easily now.

28th over: Netherlands 129-5 (Edwards 24, Nidamanuru 13) A two and one, then Nidamanuru hammers another slog-sweep but dead high, and running back from Mid-on, Woakes has a sniff ofa catch … but the ball keeps going, bouncing over the rope and dying, its work done. A single follows, making for 10 off the over, and the required rate is now 9.46.

27th over: Netherlands 119-5 (Edwards 21, Nidamanuru 6) Atkinson on for Willey, and after two leg byes, the pair almost combine for a wicket! Nidamanuru swipes over the top and Willey, at mid-on, turns in pursuit. It’s always hard to take one over the shoulder but Willey was there and so was the ball – he just drops it, which is to say it was good effort to make it a chance, but once it was, no excuses for not taking it.

26th over: Netherlands 115-5 (Edwards 20, Nidamanuru 5) Nidamanru gets away by cutting a googly for four, then after a single hands Edwards the strike … and he backhands a slog-sweep over cow for six! You’ve heard about “proper cricket shots” well, that’s a “proper tennis shot”! Eventful over that, 16 and a wicket from it.

WICKET! De Leede b Rashid 10 (Netherlands 104-5)

Now that is experience. Rather than revert to his stock ball, Rashid sends another out the front but this time just a little faster, so when De Leede looks to play the same shot, he discovers that he doesn’t have the time, an under-edge onto boot onto stumps sending him hutchward bound.

26th over: Netherlands 104-4 (Edwards 14, De Leede 10) Single to Edwards, then De Leede waits for one sent quickly out the front of the hand, cutting four when the ball’s almost past him; that’s a good, confident shot – though potentially asking for trouble.

25th over: Netherlands 99-4 (Edwards 13, De Leede 6) De Leede watches a short one right onto the bat, carting Willey through midwicket for four; two singles follow, making it six from the over – one of Netherlands’ most profitable, but still nowhere near enough.

“Why did the England test side never persevere with Rashid?” wonders Thomas Atkins. “I have a vague recollection of there being issues with his fitness and commitment, but this may have been an excuse used because his face didn’t quite fit (like that of Ben Foakes, albeit less handsome).”

I don’t think Root was every fully enamoured, and he never did quite well enough to stay in the side – but I’d have worked with him.

24th over: Netherlands 93-4 (Edwards 12, De Leede 1) Edwards takes one to cover, then after a wide, Rashid finds flight and spin, the ball skipping past De Leede’s edge; a slap to long-off follows and the required rate is now 9.50.

23rd over: Netherlands 90-4 (Edwards 11, De Leede 0) De Leede defends his first two balls, and surely this match is over as a contest.
