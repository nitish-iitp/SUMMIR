POTM Ben Stokes said:

"More pleased with the victory (than scoring a century), it has been a tough World Cup for us. It was a nice wicket to bat on, had some tennis-ball bounce. We (Woakes and himself) built a good partnership, whenever there was pressure building I had a look at the scoreboard and reminded myself there was a lot of time remaining (in the innings). Tried to take it deep and cash in later. He (Woakes) is a genuine all-rounder for us, he has been a great cricketer for England over the last 2-3 years and today he proved it," Stokes said.

Thank you for joining us. See you all tomorrow for a crunch game. Goodnight!

Winning skipper Jos Buttler said:

"Absolutely desperate for the win. Malan got us off to a flier. Partnership between Stokes and Woakes was fantastic. Anytime you need someone to stand up, he (Stokes) seems to be the guy to do that. Smart cricket between him and Woakes. Thought it was a good score. But everyone who batted said it was a good pitch. The toss - you got to play good cricket as well. Can look back and say might've done different but you have to play good cricket too. He's a class cricketer (Woakes), been a brilliant performer for us. It was high-class swing bowling, deserved more than one wicket that he got. Huge game (Pakistan). At the end of a disappointing tournament it means a lot," Buttler said.

Losing skipper Scott Edwards said:

"We didn't start well with the ball, let them get away from us. Bowlers did well to drag them back, but they got away again towards the end for a slightly above par total. Then same old story with the bat. Was a pretty good wicket. We held them well till the 43rd over. Maybe we could've tried a couple of different plans. But credit to them, they batted well. Need to find a balance chasing a 340 score. We'll talk about it and figure it out what we could've done better. Like you said we've been good in patches. Just got to do it for longer. Going to be an amazing atmosphere there (in Bangalore), boys are looking forward to it," Edwards said.

The ongoing ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup which has been delivering some exhilarating performances is nearing its business end. On November 8, at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune, the tournament's 40th match between the Netherlands and the reigning champions England will be contested, which will be both sides’ penultimate match in the tournament.

England have had a forgettable campaign, having won only one game in seven games they have played so far in the ongoing tournament.  Despite losing to New Zealand in their opening match, the defending champions looked to be on track when they defeated Bangladesh in their second match of the tournament. Regretfully, Jos Buttler and Co. failed to play up to their standard as they suffered five consecutive defeats.

England’s last defeat came against five-time champions Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Speaking about the game, England skipper Jos Buttler won the toss and invited Australia to bat first. England relied heavily on Chris Woakes, who took four wickets to help restrict Pat Cummins and Co. to 286. 

However, the Australian bowlers ran riot from the beginning of the second innings as England were restricted to 253 in 48.1 overs, despite Dawid Malan and Ben Stokes playing significant half-centuries. Apart from the duo, all-rounder Moeen Ali also had a substantial impact by adding 42 runs to England's innings. Adam Zampa, on the other hand, proved crucial for the Kangaroos, taking three wickets for just 21 runs.

Netherlands, on the other hand, have put up some memorable performances in this competition as they have won two and lost five games. The Scott Edwards-led suffered a seven-wicket defeat over Afghanistan in their most recent game at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow. 

Batting first after winning the toss, the Netherlands could manage to post only 179 runs, with Sybrand Engelbrecht scoring 58 off 86 deliveries. Max O'Dowd, the opener, also contributed significantly with a 40-ball 42-run knock. Meanwhile, Hashmatullah Shahidi and Rahmat Shah both made noteworthy fifties as Afghanistan reached the mark with 111 balls to spare.
