Chris Woakes and David Willey then struck in the powerplay to put England thoroughly in control of the game.

It was then just a matter of chipping away and working their way through the Dutch side.

He was ably supported by Chris Woakes, who has struggled throughout this World Cup.

He looked really good from the moment he walked to the crease and his 129-run stand with Ben Stokes swung the game firmly in England's favour.

This was much more like the England of old.

They lost some cheap wickets to throw away a really good position of 133-1, but Ben Stokes delivered yet again.

He was patient for his half-century before accelerating and the Netherlands bowlers really struggled to cope with the onslaught.

'We need to find that balance better'
published at 16:06 Greenwich Mean Time 8 November 2023
16:06 GMT 8 November 2023

Netherlands captain Scott Edwards: "We didn't start well, our bowlers did well to drag it back but they took it away from us and got just above par. Same old story with the bat."

What did you make of the pitch?: "I think it was a pretty good wicket, we held them quite well. Maybe we could've tried a few different plans but credit to them, they played well."

Are you trying to find that balance between being more attacking but also not risking losing wickets?: "It's obviously a balance we've got to find a little bit better. Chasing a 340 score, you need to get some of those in the powerplay but you also need wickets in hand."

Do you need to play more sustained cricket to progress to the next level?: "Absolutely. We've been in good in patches, similar today, we just need to do it for longer. England are a quality side and they took it away from us."

Your final match gives you a chance of qualifying for the 2025 Champions Trophy. How much are you looking forward to facing India in Bengaluru?: "It will be an amazing atmosphere, the boys are looking forward to it."

Despite England's performances, I've really enjoyed the format of this World Cup. With 3 teams still looking for a semi final spot and 4 teams still trying to qualify for the ICC Champions Trophy, there's still a lot to play for in the final round of matches!

'Some very smart cricket'

England captain Jos Buttler: "We were desperate for the win. We got off to a great start, had a bit of a speed bump in the middle.

"We needed someone to stand up and take charge. There was some very smart cricket between Stokes and Woakes to get us to that score.

"With the toss, you still have to play good cricket. The toss is interesting. Maybe it's the pressure of World Cup cricket. Runs on the board has done well in this tournament.

"Chris Woakes is a class cricketer and has been a brilliant performer for us. I thought he deserved more wickets.

"The Pakistan game is huge. At the end of a disappointing tournament we finish with a game that means a lot."

I'm not one for swapping and changing a coach that won a T20 World Cup a year ago. Matthew Mott will know he's made mistakes in the last few weeks. In my eyes, he will be the coach going to the T20 World Cup in America and the Caribbean in about six months time and that is the right thing.

Player of the match, England's Ben Stokes: "I'm more pleased for us to get a victory over the line, it's been a tough World Cup and nice to get back to winning ways today.

"It was obviously a nice wicket to bat on, it was just back of a length had that tennis-ball bounce. I just tried to take it as deep as I possibly could then cash in at the end.

"Me and Chris Woakes just built a partnership. I use the scoreboard as my friend a lot. Whenever pressure feels like it's building or if it is, I just look up and you realise you've got more time than you think.

"It's amazing how quickly you can catch up. The last 14 overs, I think we scored at 10 an over.

"Chris [Woakes] is a genuine all-rounder for us. He's a very, very experienced cricketer. Having the skill he has with the bat down the order and seeing him with the new-ball tonight, it was very special.

"He's been a very good cricketer for England over the last two or three years and he showed why tonight."

On whether he considered leaving to get his knee surgery after England were knocked out: "No. Don't leave anyone hanging."

Job done. England put in a professional display, one or two blips but that was it.

England play Pakistan on Saturday. A win would almost certainly guarantee their place at the Champions Trophy but it doesn't necessarily.

If they win, Bangladesh beat Australia on Saturday, Sri Lanka beat New Zealand on Thursday and the Netherlands beat India on Sunday all four teams would be locked on six points and net run-rate would decide who stands where.

England's is very tight to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka so it won't take much to swing it one way and then the other.

England have won their second match, up they go to four points. No wild celebrations, but Jos Buttler is smiling for the first time in a long time. There feels like such a relief on the support staff there. England are very fragile at the moment, but Ben Stokes got 100 and Jos Buttler has his arms around his shoulders.

It's been a difficult few weeks, they've only got themselves to blame but there's smiles now.
