Pitch Report

Analysis

The Indian batting lineup had a massive scare while chasing down the 200-run target against Australia, after they were reduced to 2-3, but Virat Kohli and KL Rahul stitched together a 165-run fourth wicket stand to help the team achieve victory. Earlier, the match was set up in a collective effort by the Indian bowlers, with Ravindra Jadeja picking up three crucial top order wickets of the Australian cricket team.

Meanwhile, apart from the wicket-keeper batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz compiling a decent score at the top of the order, the rest of the Afghanistan batting lineup crumbled against the spin bowling pedigree of Bangladesh. With just 156 runs to defend, the Afghanistan bowlers picked up two early wickets, but then, they couldn’t do much to the rest of the opposing batting lineup, who chased down the target with ease.
