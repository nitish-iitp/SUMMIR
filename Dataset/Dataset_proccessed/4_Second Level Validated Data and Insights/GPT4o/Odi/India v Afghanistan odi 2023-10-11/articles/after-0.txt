That’s it from us today. We’ll be back tomorrow to OBO like it is 1999 as Australia and South Africa go head to head in Lucknow. Nobody mention ‘dropping the World Cup’ or that run out. Thanks for your company and comments, goodnight.

Winning captain and player of the match Rohit Sharma:

It was a good win for us, ot is very important to get momentum at the start. You will be put under pressure, there will be a spell from the opposition at some point and we’ll have to absorb it.

We’ve got players with different skillsets bringing different attributes which is good for the team. We’ve got batters who play freely and fearlessly and when you have all-round players, things take care of themselves.

On that record breaking innings Rohit said:

It was a good pitch to bat on and I backed myself to play my natural game. I knew that the wicket would get easier once I’d got my eye in…

It is special to get a World Cup hundred and I’m very happy but I don’t want to think about records too much because there’s a long way to go and I don’t want to lose my focus. I just want to make it count on days like this… some of my play is premeditated but you can’t just go out and play big shots, sometimes, you go by instinct. It’s often a mixture of both.

I know it’s my responsibility to give the team a good start and put the team in a good position as much as possible. It’s something I’ve done for a while and love doing, it looks good when it works out! It doesn’t always come off but I want to back myself to keep trying and put pressure on the opposition.

Losing captain Hashmatullah Shahidi speaks:

We had above 300 as a target in mind but unfortunately we lost back-to-back wickets in the middle. Our thinking at the toss was that it was a good pitch and we wanted to put up big runs. We hope to work on the issues and come back positively and we are looking forward to the seven more games.

So India complete the win with 15 overs and 8 wickets to spare, they are under such intense pressure as favourites in a home world cup but showed no sign of nerves in Delhi this evening. Jasprit Bumrah impressed with the ball, pocketing four wickets for 39 and he was well supported by Hardik Pandya, Thakur and Yadav. Afghanistan mustered a half-decent total but in the end Rohit’s sublime century made the result a foregone conclusion after only the first ten overs of the response. Virat Kohli came in to finish the job and send his home crowd into raptures with an effortless fifty.

India win by 8 wickets!

Kohli does indeed reach his 68th ODI fifty with a pull off Azmatullah and a lofted drive back over the bowler’s head to finish the match!

That was a drubbing for Afghanistan, they will surely rue the decision to bring Rashid Khan on in the 15th over, long after India had taken a huge chunk out of the 272 run target. India were truly imperious with the bat, Rohit Sharma in jaw-dropping form – the emphatic pulls and lofted drives a joy to watch.

34th over: Kohli 44, Iyer 24 (India 261-2) Iyer whacks Farooqi for four, India need 12 more runs and Kohli needs six of them to go to his squillionth white ball fifty…

33rd over: Kohli 43, Iyer 19 (India 255-2) Cowabunga! Shreyas Iyer hits Mujeeb miles over long on to take the crown for biggest six of the tournament so far – the ICC trundle wheel clocks it as a 101 metre beast. Ones and twos are pocketed by Kohli and Iyer to make it 11 runs off the over and India are just 18 runs away now.

32nd over: Kohli 40, Iyer 11 (India 244-2) Farooqi returns and is picked off for five singles from his over. Kohli’s bat sounds like a canon blasting away in a bubblewrap factory, such a satisfying crunch whenever he strikes the ball. Only the best willow for Virat, don’t think he has to shop the sales at the local sports shop.

KLANG! We interrupt this OBO…

Whilst there is ever such a brief lull in the run fest, forgive me for plugging The Nightwatchman Podcast. Created by myself and Jon Hotten (one of the most evocative writers on cricket/sport/anything and in possession of graspable coat tails…) a new series has just landed and should be bang in in the sweetspot/wheelhouse of OBO followers. Why not give it a whirl?

28th over: Kohli 30, Iyer 4 (India 221-2) Rashid Khan continues and is hit for nine off his latest over. The spinner drops a smidge short and Kohli times him away for four through the leg side. Kohli and Iyer are happy to rotate strike, this is so over. The mind starts to drift towards India’s next game – against Pakistan at the 130,000 seater stadium in Ahmedabad. Crikes.

27th over: Kohli 24, Iyer 1 (India 212-2) Shot! Azmatullah is worked away through mid-wicket by Kohli, a pulsating boundary to a decent ball. The two men share an embrace later in the over that is replayed on the big screen to much swooning.

WICKET! Rohit Sharma b Rashid Khan 131 (India 205-2)

Rohit finally falls! Rashid castles him with a flipper that skids past his attempted sweep shot but the match is all but done thanks to a regal innings form the Indian opener. Shreyas Iyer is the new man and he gets off the mark right away with a clip to leg.

25th over: Sharma 130, Kohli 16 (India 202-1) Azmatullah Omarzai into the attack and he’s met with the flourishing blade of Virat Kohli. A length ball is pounced upon by Kohli and swivelled away in front of square for four.

24th over: Sharma 130, Kohli 11 (India 197-1) Naveen is picked off for three runs off his latest, a brief over of respite. India need only 78 more runs and they’ve not even got to half way in the overs.

23rd over: Sharma 130, Kohli 9 (India 194-1) Rohit in a hurry! Rashid Khan is dispatched for back-to-back fours and then whipped emphatically into the crowd off the next ball for a huge SIX! That was some shot and it is Rashid Khan that Rohit is taking to pieces here, one of the very best with a white ball in hand. The Afghanistan players are bystanders, they can only stand and stare at the cosmic trails emanating from Rohit Sharma’s blade.

22nd over: Sharma 115, Kohli 8 (India 178-1) Rohit pounces on a slower ball by Naveen and picks up four more. India’s target is now less than 100 – they need 95 runs off 28 overs. You heard. I don’t think this is going to take very long, call it a hunch.

21st over: Sharma 110, Kohli 8 (India 173-1) India are rattling along at over eight runs an over, they want to get this done in as quick as time as possible and give their NRR a shot in the bicep. Oooooh. Virat unfurls the most aesthetically pleasing cover drive for four that you could ever wish to see. The crowd let out a collective purr and then collapse into wild cheers.

20th over: Sharma 108, Kohli 2 (India 164-1) The crowd were already loving Rohit’s pyrotechnics but the decibel level went stratospheric with the arrival of King Kohli. Rohit drives for four past mid-on, this is still his party for the time being.

WICKET! Kishan c Ibrahim Zadran b Rashid Khan 47 (India 156-1)

Ishan Kishan falls to a leading edge, Afghanistan have their first but it is much too little, much too late. It was that man Rashid Khan who took it, his late introduction is very puzzling. Virat strolls out on his home ground to an absolutely THUNDEROUS reception.

18th over: Sharma 101, Kishan 46 (India 154-0) Play continues after a slurp. Sharma glides for four to go to 99… and there is the century! Rohit Sharma scores his SEVENTH World Cup century, the most of any player. At just 63 balls, this is the fastest for India in a CWC too.

Nabi is then lofted away for six by Ishan Kishan. It was an attempted wrong’un by the bowler, “Picked him like a dirty nose” drawls Dirk Nannes on the commentary. Er, Lovely stuff.

17th over: Sharma 95, Kishan 38 (India 140-0) Five more collected from Rashid Khan’s over, a fizzing googly rips past Rohit’s edge and Rashid is excited for a moment but decides wisely against a review. Time for a drink – India coasting.

Love Rashid Khan but can't get my head around his reluctance to bowl in the Powerplay

India 125 for 0 in pursuit of 273 when he eventually comes on in the 15th over - with the required rate down at 4.11 from an initial 5.46

15th over: Sharma 92, Kishan 31 (India 130-0) Finally it is time for Rashid Khan. He starts well enough, getting some zip and turn off the wicket. Rohit and Ishan are slightly more watchful and pick up five from the over. Afghanistan need a miracle form their champion bowler here but the horse has long since bolted, it’s whinnying in a field far far away.

14th over: Sharma 88, Kishan 30 (India 125-0) The boundaries continue to rain through the Delhi night, Ishan whacks Mujeeb square of the wicket and knocks a single to bring Sharma on strike. Sharma then shows his touch by glancing a full ball on his pads fine for four before opening his broad shoulders next ball and pummelling a drive down the ground. Markram’s record might be safe for now but Rohit is still on for a rapid and remarkable ton.

13th over: Sharma 79, Kishan 25 (India 111-0) Ishan Kishan comes to life – a four past backward point and a slog sweep for six into the crowd. Surely time for Rashid Khan, where is he? His team need him to stem the flow at the very least.

Mid over chats must be fun.

12th over: Sharma 79, Kishan 14 (India 100-0) India bring up the hundred in just the 12th over and for the loss of precisely zero wickets. Four runs off the over, Mujeeb has settled into a decent spell. STAT ALERT:

New World Cup record... Rohit's 79 is the most runs scored by one player out of the first 100 scored by their team (men's and women's WCs). Previously: 76, McCullum for NZ v England in 2015; and Davison for Canada v WI in 2003.

10th over: Sharma 76, Kishan 11 (India 94-0) Mujeeb with his third over and seven runs are taken off it as things calm down a smidge. Kishan is at the other end on 11, he’s just been watching his opening partner club it to all parts for the past half an hour. Rohit calls for a new bat, the other one was obviously not working for him… and smashes a four through square off the final ball as Mujeeb loses his length. Still on for that record…

9th over: Sharma 71, Kishan 10 (India 87-0) Right then, Aidan Markram’s 49 ball century from the other day might be in danger here. Rohit launches the biggest six of the tournament so far (93 metres, it looked bigger) and follows it up with a drive for four more over mid-off. The Hitman goes to 71 off 38 balls.

Rohit hits a huge maximum with his signature pull shot and with that mighty blow the Indian opener goes to the top of the pile - pipping Chris Gayle – for the most international sixes!

7th over: Sharma 49, Kishan 10 (India 64-0) SEVENTEEN runs blitzed off the over in imperious fashion. Rohit clips Farooqi over mid-off for four and follows up with a slash past point. Best of the lot is a monstrous SIX off a tame short ball, Farooqi went for a slower ball bouncer and it sat up like an inquisitive meerkat on a Chaise Longue. BOSH. Rohit launched it into the stands!

6th over: Sharma 32, Kishan 10 (India 47-0) Naveen ul Haq starts from around the wicket and is basted for ten runs off his first over. Kishan coming to the party with a glance for four and four leg byes off a poorly directed full ball. India rollocking along in Delhi.

“Afternoon James” and to you Dennis Hamer!

5th over: Sharma 31, Kishan 5 (India 37-0) Rohit goes to 1000 runs in World Cups (in his 19th match) with a lofted drive for SIX! A big OBO badge of respect if you can name the only man to get to the milestone in the same amount of innings? (AB de Villiers and Sachin both did it in 20 – slowcoaches)

More boundaries as Farooqi wilts under the pressure, a drag down is biffed behind square and a full ball is sent soaring over extra-cover. India looking to get this done quickly, NRR could well be a prominent player in this tournament.

4th over: Sharma 17, Kishan 5 (India 23-0) Kishan opens his account with a delightful cover drive, threaded through the infield for a boundary. Mujeeb then drags down and is hoicked away square by Rohit. Two singles make it ten off the over. Not the pressure cooker start Afghanistan wanted.

3rd over: Sharma 12, Kishan (India 13-0) Farooqi strays onto Rohit’s pads and is whistled to the fence at square leg for the first boundary of the innings. Another delivery at the hip is clipped for two and Rohit looks in silken touch. Afghanistan need to get rid of him sharp-ish if they are to give themselves a sniff.

2nd over: Sharma 6, Kishan (India 7-0) Rohit collects a brace of twos (Roger?) off Mujeeb and brings Kishan on strike with a single. Good hustle from the offie, two dots finish the over, one of them whizzed down at 102kph – 63 mph in old money.
