It’s a wrap

There you have it from Lucknow.

On a challenging pitch, India managed to scrape their way to a middling total of 229, thanks largely to Rohit’s superb 87, which would have been equivalent to 100-125 on any other pitch.

England looked to be in a great position to pick up a win to boost their semifinal hopes, but that was quickly turned around thanks to some disciplined bowling by India’s seamers, which was backed up by the spinners as well.

They ended up crashing to 129 all out as India came away with a victory which will surely galvanise the team as we head into the business end of the tournament.

India next face Sri Lanka on November 2, while England face old adversaries, Australia, on November 4 in what is undoubtedly a must-win match.

On behalf of Patrick Keddie and Kevin Hand, this is Rohan Sharma signing off.

‘I’ll take that win any day’

Rohit, who is adjudged the player of the match, had this to say: “Looking at where we were after the first 10 overs, it was important to create a partnership, which myself and KL [Rahul] did.”

“It wasn’t about just playing my shots, but also using my experience. It was necessary to take the game as deep as possible and try to get to a decent total,” he said.

“I still felt like we were 30-40 runs short, but overall it was a great performance. I’ll take that win any day.”

India win by 100 runs

This was a bowling performance of the highest order as India remain the sole undefeated team in the tournament.

With this result, they displace South Africa at the top of the standings with 12 points in six matches.

England had a great chance at winning this match at the interval and Buttler will have much to contemplate as their side’s chances of progression look even more scant.

England 129 all out. Wood out

Bumrah goes short and Willey punishes him by hooking him high over deep fine leg for half a dozen.

But it doesn’t matter much as Bumrah yorks Wood to end the match once and for all.

England 122-9. Rashid out

Shami is back on but doesn’t quite have his radar in check as he strays down the leg side and is subsequently helped along to the fine leg boundary by Rashid.

The pacer goes for back-to-back bouncers which Rashid tries to pull behind square, but both are wided by the umpire.

Rashid follows up with a stand-and-deliver cover drive which screams to the boundary.

But Shami has the last laugh as he picks up his fourth by bowling Rashid all ends up.

With that, No 11 Mark Wood makes his way to the middle with an almighty task on his hands.

33 overs. England 112-8

Bumrah is back on and is greeted rather unceremoniously by Willey with a hoick over deep mid-wicket for six.

Willey goes again after a shortish length but ends up finding the fielder at deep square leg.

Rashid ends up toe-ending a chance to short third man off the final ball but just survives the fielder’s diving effort.

England take eight off the over as they are still 118 runs away from the target.

32 overs. England 104-8

Willey and Rashid manage two off Kuldeep’s over as they will want to try and bat out as many overs as possible from a net run rate perspective.

31 overs. England 102-8

Jadeja has been phenomenal with the ball as he allows just the one run.

It caps off what has been an outstanding bowling performance from India so far.

30 overs. England 101-8

Kuldeep allows just three singles off the over as England scrape their way past 100.

Will be interesting to see if Rohit decides to bring back one of his pacers shortly to try and finish off the tail.
