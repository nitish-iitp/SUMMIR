INDIA BULLDOZE SRI LANKA IN JAW-DROPPING 302-RUN WIN TO BOOK CRICKET WORLD CUP SEMI-FINAL SPOT
BYIBRAHIM MUSTAPHA

UPDATED 02/11/2023 AT 16:06 GMT

India wowed the home crowd in Mumbai as they trashed a shell-shocked Sri Lanka by 302 runs after bowling their opponents out for 55 in less than 20 overs. Earlier, they set a target of 358 to win with big scores for Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer as a devastating attacking display saw them book a semi-final spot, all but eliminating Sri Lanka in the process.

India's Mohammed Shami (3L) celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Sri Lanka's Kasun Rajitha during the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between India and Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Novem

India produced a stunning performance to crush a woeful Sri Lanka as they remain unbeaten in the Cricket World Cup.
India are now certain of a semi-final spot as they top the table with seven wins from seven, following a monstrous 302-win over a sorry Sri Lanka side in Mumbai.

Having been put in to bat from the toss, the hosts looked to lay down an instant marker when Rohit Sharma found the boundary with the very first ball, but could only watch in horror as Dilshan Madushanka continued his excellent power play form and bowled him clean with the second ball.

The dismissal proved to be a minor setback for India as Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli put them in command with Gill finally going for 92 after being caught behind by Ajantha Mendis from Madushanka’s slower ball.
Kohli soon went for 88 on a day he was looking to match the century record of 49 currently held by Sachin Tendulkar.
Shreyas Iyer scored an impressive 82 after smashing six sixes before being also removed by Madushanka for the Sri Lankan bowler’s five-wicket haul, having also dismissed Suryakumar Yadav.
Ravindra Jadeja’s 35 kept the scoreboard ticking along before he was run out as India finished on 357-8.
Sri Lanka’s chances of chasing down an already intimidating total were dealt an instant blow as Pathum Nissanka went first ball lbw off the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah.
Things went from bad to worse as Dimuth Karunaratne was then bowled lbw by Mohammed Siraj, who then immediately removed Sadeera Samarawickrama to leave Sri Lanka 2-3 with less than two overs played.
Captain Kusal Mendis soon followed, going for a single run with Siraj at it again leaving the scoreboard reading a scarcely believable 3-4 in the fourth over.

Who has qualified for the 2023 Cricket World Cup semi-finals? Who is still in the hunt?
Angelo Mathews attempted to steady the ship as best he could, but only managed 12 runs before being sent packing by Mohammed Shami.
Shami had also seen off Charith Asalanka, Dushan Hemantha and Dushmantha Chameera before Mathews to leave Sri Lanka 29-8.
At this point, it was simply a case of avoiding the lowest men’s World Cup ODI score of 36 – ironically scored by Canada against Sri Lanka back in 2003.
Kasun Rajitha made 14 before he also went after being caught by Gill as Shami took his fifth wicket of the day and 45th at a World Cup, a new record for an Indian player.
The final wicket fell when Madushanka, who started the day so well, was caught by Shreyas off the bowling of Jadeja to leave Sri Lanka 55 all out in 19.4 overs.
With India head and shoulders above the rest, Sri Lanka are all but eliminated from the tournament after a fifth defeat from seven matches.
