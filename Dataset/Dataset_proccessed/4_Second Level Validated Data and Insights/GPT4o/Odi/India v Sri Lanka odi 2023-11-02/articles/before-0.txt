Hosts India will be in action on Thursday as World Cup action returns to the Wankhede stadium. India will play in Mumbai in a 50-over World Cup match for the first time since lifting the trophy at the venue in 2011. Incidentally, they face another finalist from 2011, Sri Lanka on their return to Wankhede.

A win on Thursday would ensure India qualifying for the semis. They are yet to be beaten in the competition thus far.

Sri Lanka have had a disappointing outing thus far in the tournament. The 1996 World Cup winners are placed seventh on the points table, with two wins in six matches. They were defeated by South Africa, Pakistan, and Australia and also faced a heartbreaking loss against Afghanistan.
