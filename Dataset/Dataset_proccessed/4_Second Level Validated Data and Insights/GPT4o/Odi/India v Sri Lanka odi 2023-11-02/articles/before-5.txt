IND vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Venue and Pitch Report

IND vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

Rohit Sharma: Rohit Sharma has been in sensational form, and his overall record against Sri Lanka has also been decent. He also has vast experience of playing in Wankhede and will enjoy batting here. Expect another good outing for Rohit.

Virat Kohli: Virat Kohli has a tremendous record against Sri Lanka and will enjoy playing in Wankhede. He has also been in terrific form this World Cup.

Kusal Mendis: Kusal Mendis is another fine captaincy option for this game. Mendis is among the best Sri Lankan batters and will enjoy batting in Wankhede.

IND vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Mohammed Siraj: Mohammed Siraj has surprisingly been picked up by less than 28% of users as of now, making him a good differential pick. Siraj has an amazing record against Sri Lanka, as he picks wickets every time against them. He will also like bowling in Wankhede.

Charith Asalanka: Charith Asalanka has been selected by less than 17% of people as of now. Asalanka hasn’t been up to the mark this World Cup, but he can make crucial runs, especially if a few wickets fall early. Hence, Asalanka will be a nice differential pick.

Dimuth Karunaratne: Dimuth Karunaratne hasn’t done anything significant so far and can be avoided for this game.

IND vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Mega League Base Team

If IND bat first:

Complete the team with three among Shreyas Iyer, Charith Asalanka, Angelo Mathews and Jasprit Bumrah.

If SL bat first:

Complete the team with three among Sadeera Samarawickrama, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and Dushmantha Chameera.

IND vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Small League Base Team

If IND bat first:

Complete the team with Shubman Gill, Sadeera Samarawickrama and Jasprit Bumrah.

If SL bat first:

Complete the team with Charith Asalanka, Angelo Mathews and Dushmantha Chameera.
