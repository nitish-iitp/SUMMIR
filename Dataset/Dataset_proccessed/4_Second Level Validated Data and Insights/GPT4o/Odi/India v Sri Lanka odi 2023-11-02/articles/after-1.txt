India became the first team to qualify for the knockout stages of the Cricket World Cup with a thumping 302-run victory over Sri Lanka in Mumbai. Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill put on 189 for India’s second wicket in their total of 357 for eight and Sri Lanka could only manage a sorry 55 all out in reply.

Mohammed Shami’s five for 18 made him India’s leading wicket-taker in 50-over World Cups, with the hosts securing their seventh win from as many matches.

Dilshan Madushanka bowled the captain, Rohit Sharma, off only the second ball of the India innings but Sri Lankan cheers proved short-lived as Kohli and Gill piled on the runs. Kohli survived a tough caught-and-bowled chance off Dushmantha Chameera when he was on 10 and India were only seven runs short of 200 when Madushanka had Gill caught behind for 92.

The home fans had hoped to see Kohli score his second century of the tournament but he went shortly after, Madushanka claiming his third wicket with India’s star batter on 88. Shreyas Iyer quickly picked up the baton, though, becoming the third Indian batter to pass 80 before Madushanka took a fifth wicket.

Sri Lanka then endured a nightmare start to their innings, losing four wickets for three runs inside four overs. Pathum Nissanka was trapped lbw by Jasprit Bumrah off the first ball but it was Mohammed Siraj who did most of the damage, snaring Dimuth Karunaratne and Sadeera Samarawickrama in the second over and then bowling the captain, Kusal Mendis, with the first ball of the fourth over.

Charith Asalanka lasted until the 10th over but, when he was caught by Ravindra Jadeja off the bowling of Shami, he had scored just one run from 24 balls.

Dushan Hemantha was out next ball, caught behind by KL Rahul, and although Chameera denied Shami a hat-trick, he went for a duck in the bowler’s next over. Only Angelo Mathews, Maheesh Theekshana and Kasun Rajitha reached double figures, with Sri Lanka bowled out inside 20 overs.

“We’re very happy knowing we have officially qualified,” said Sharma. “It’s been a good effort from the entire squad, it has been clinical, we’ve wanted individuals to put their hands up.”

Mendis cut a disappointed figure afterwards. “We had reasons for wanting to bowl first, the wicket was a bit slow,” he said. “Unfortunately, there was then a little bit of seam and swing which made it difficult to play at night.”
