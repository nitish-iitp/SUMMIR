Virat Kohli made the most of a missed opportunity from Dushmatha Chameera as the fast bowler dropped a return catch in the 6th over when the former captain was on 10. Sri Lanka missed a golden opportunity to send Virat Kohli back to the hut after Dilshan Madushanka got the big wicket of in-form Rohit Sharma for 4 in the first over.

Virat Kohli switched gears after the dropped chance as he put the pressure back on the Sri Lanka bowlers. The straight drives flowed and the square drives kept coming as Kohli got to another milestone in the World Cup. Kohli now has the second-most fifty-plus scores in ODI World Cups - 13 and he is 9 behind the legendary Sachin Tendulkar.

Kohli hit 8 boundaries against his favourite foes, Sri Lanka as he got good support from Shubman Gill. Kohli and Gill added 100-plus for the second wicket as India's in-form batting unit imposed itself on the Sri Lankan attack.
