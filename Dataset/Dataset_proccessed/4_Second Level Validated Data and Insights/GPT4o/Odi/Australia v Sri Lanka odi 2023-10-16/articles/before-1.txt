Preview

In the 14th match of the ODI World Cup 2023, Australia are scheduled to compete against Sri Lanka at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. After losing their opening two matches in the flagship tournament, both the former champions are under pressure to bring their campaign back on track in the flagship tournament, at the expense of each other. With Sri Lanka winning three out of the last four ODIs against Australia, the expectation for a competitive match between both these teams isn’t going to be out of the question.

Pitch Report

In the first match of the ODI World Cup 2023, the pitch at the Ekana Cricket Stadium was quite good for batting, which allowed South Africa to post a total in excess of 300 on the board. The average first-innings score at this venue, which boasts long boundaries, is 250, which can be breached when Australia takes on Sri Lanka on October 16.

Team Analysis

Australia

The struggles for the Australian batting lineup in the ODI World Cup 2023 have begun from the top, where the veterans David Warner and Steve Smith are yet to score big runs. In the bowling side of things, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood have managed to pick some big wickets in the flagship tournament, but they haven’t been able to sustain their performances long enough to make a telling impact on the team.

SportsTiger Playing XI of Australia

David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (c), Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

Sri Lanka

Kusal Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama have been amongst the runs for Sri Lanka in the first two matches of the ODI World Cup 2023, helping their team post totals in excess of 300 runs on the board, except that their efforts went in vain. The Sri Lankan bowling attack has been trounced all over the park in the initial stage of the flagship tournament, with no standout performer for the team management to take solace in.

Conclusion

Australia have been far from their best in the ODI format in the recent past, which is why Sri Lanka are definitely in with a decent chance to achieve victory against them.
