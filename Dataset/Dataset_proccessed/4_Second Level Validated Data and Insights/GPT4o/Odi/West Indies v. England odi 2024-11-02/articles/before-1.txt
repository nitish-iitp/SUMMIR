Broadcast and Live Streaming Details

England’s tour of the West Indies in 2024 is set to deliver a packed schedule, featuring three ODIs followed by five T20Is. The tour kicks off with the ODI series on October 31, setting the stage for intense competition between the two teams. Following the ODIs, the T20I series will commence, culminating on November 17. This tour marks a pivotal moment for both sides as they continue to refine their squads and strategies ahead of upcoming international competitions.

England to miss Jos Buttler in ODI series; Liam Livingstone steps up as captain

England will be without their regular ODI captain, Jos Buttler, who has been sidelined with a calf injury since the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 in June. Taking on the leadership role, Liam Livingstone will captain the team in Buttler’s absence, marking a significant opportunity for him to lead the English squad. England’s last ODI series against Australia at home ended in a narrow 3-2 loss, adding pressure to perform well in this upcoming series against the West Indies.

West Indies make key change with Shimron Hetmyer’s inclusion

West Indies, led by Shai Hope, are aiming for a bounce-back performance after their 2-1 ODI and T20I series defeats in Sri Lanka. Cricket West Indies has made a single change to their ODI squad, bringing in left-handed batter Shimron Hetmyer in place of Alick Athanaze. Hetmyer’s inclusion adds depth to the middle order, which has struggled with consistency in recent matches. His presence is expected to stabilize and strengthen West Indies’ batting lineup.

Preparations for the Champions Trophy 2025

With the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 approaching, the England-West Indies ODI series holds strategic importance. Both teams will aim to fine-tune their lineups and address gaps, making this series a critical opportunity to assess form and build momentum. For England, the series is a chance to reset after the recent defeat to Australia, while West Indies will look to establish stronger footing following their losses in Sri Lanka.

Squads:

West Indies: Shai Hope (Captain), Alzarri Joseph, Jewel Andrew, Shimron Hetmyer, Keacy Carty, Roston Chase, Matthew Forde, Shamar Joseph, Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Gudakesh Motie, Jayden Seales, Romario Shepherd, Hayden Walsh Jr

England: Liam Livingstone (c), Jofra Archer, Jacob Bethell, Jafer Chohan, Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Dan Mousley, Jamie Overton, Michael Pepper (wk), Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, John Turner.
