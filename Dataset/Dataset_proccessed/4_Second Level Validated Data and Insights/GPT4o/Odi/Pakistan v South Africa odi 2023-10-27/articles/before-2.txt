Pakistan will play their sixth match of the 2023 World Cup when they take on South Africa at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on 27 October.

On Monday, Pakistan took on Afghanistan at the same venue. Batting first, they scored 282/7, courtesy of captain Babar Azam's half-century, and a late flourish from Iftikhar Ahmad and Shadab Khan.

In reply, Afghanistan openers Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz laid the platform for victory with a brilliant first-wicket stand of 130, before Rahmat Shah and Hashmatullah Shahidi finished the job off. The result took Pakistan's record to 2 wins and 3 losses in the tournament.

Pakistan predictions, latest betting odds

Pakistan have blown hot and cold in different phases during games in this World Cup. Their batting has been largely consistent, but the bowling has been a bit of a letdown. They may have the advantage over the Proteas in terms of adaptation to the pitch conditions, but otherwise it's hard to see them getting a win.

South Africa's batters have been in belligerent form, scoring 300+ in every one of their full innings so far. In the last match at the Wankhede Stadium, Heinrich Klaasen and Marco Jansen took England to the cleaners in the slog overs and while the MA Chidambaram Stadium may not be as conducive to run-scoring, there's a good chance they could bat Pakistan out of this game.
