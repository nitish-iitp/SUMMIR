It took 26 matches for the World Cup to get a closely fought game. When it came, the nail-biting contest saw South Africa defeating Pakistan by one wicket on a day when fortunes swung wildly at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium.

Chasing 271, the Proteas made heavy weather of it despite Aiden Markram’s brilliant 91 (93b, 7x4, 3x6). Pakistan persisted, with Shaheen Afridi providing crucial breakthroughs to reduce South Africa to 250 for eight.
