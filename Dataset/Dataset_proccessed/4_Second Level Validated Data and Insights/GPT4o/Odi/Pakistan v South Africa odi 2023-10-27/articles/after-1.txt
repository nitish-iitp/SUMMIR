Well, what a game that was.

Hopefully we have a few more close encounters going forward, starting with what should be a cracker between Australia and New Zealand tomorrow. That's an early one - tune in from 6:00 BST if you're keen (no pressure).

Netherlands v Bangladesh follows that one in a jam-packed day.

Until then, here's Stephan Shemilt's match report on today's events - enjoy, and we look forward to you joining us tomorrow!

'DRS is just a part of the game'
published at 18:25 British Summer Time 27 October 2023
18:25 BST 27 October 2023

Pakistan skipper Babar Azam: "Yes, we had a fightback. We did not finish well or start well, the bowlers fought very well.

Thoughts on DRS?: "To be honest, it is part of the game. If they give out then it would go in our favour but in DRS, there is umpire's call and that is part of it.

How much did it mean?: "Yes, we have a very close fight and fought very well. At this point, we had an opportunity to win this match but we missed it.

Still a chance of qualifying if it's three more wins?: "We will try our best in our next three matches, put our effort into our next match."

There has been quite a lot of discussion around reviews and the umpire's call side of things.

Tabraiz Shamsi's one was very marginal and went against Pakistan, but so was Rassie van der Dussen's - which went their way.

After the tensest of tense finishes, here's the moment that Keshav Maharaj sealed the victory.

That defeat does leave Pakistan's hopes of qualifying in tatters. Not completely over, but very unlikely. They are relying on a lot of other results going their way.

Obviously there are still countless group games left, but here's the table as things stand at the moment.

South Africa keep their fate in their own hands still, with five wins from six. And they've overcome the big mental hurdle of chasing a target too, which should give them confidence.

It is an absolute choker for Babar Azam, Pakistan knew they had to win this game really. There are all sorts of permutations, but at the moment, it is looking good for India, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.

'I didn't think I'd need to get my pads on'

South Africa bowler and player of the match Tabraiz Shamsi: "I knew I had to do a job there, but the guys who bowled before me set it up perfectly.

How pleased are you with your recent form?: "Really happy, you play enough cricket to know sometimes it goes for you, sometimes it doesn't. I didn't think I'd need to get my pads on. I'm just keen to make the most of it going well.

Your contribution with the bat?: "They're probably the first four runs I've scored this year. Kesh scored big runs and Lungi before him too."

A lesson in batting out your 50 overs, perhaps?

A brave, inspiring effort from Pakistan's bowlers. They fought until the very end, three wickets for Shaheen and two apiece for Rauf, Wasim and Mir.

They just couldn't find that last one.

Really good planning from Keshav Maharaj Among all the hype and tension he worked out how to win the game. And that was to see off the Pakistan seam bowlers knowing South Africa would have to bowl three overs of spin, and at least one of the finger spinners who hadn't bowled for 20 odd overs.

It was tense, it was dramatic, it was unbearable at times. But it was a thriller, and that's what we have been crying out for.

Keshav Maharaj was absolutely pumped with those winning runs, bright red in the face and roaring with emotion.

Despite all that, the scenes out there are friendly. All players shake hands and hug, knowing they have all played their part in a cracking encounter.

It's gone for four and South Africa have won this game in thrilling style. Maharaj gets a hug from Shamsi. South Africa have managed to do the one thing they've so far failed at, which is chasing. It looked unlikely at one stage. Pakistan had no ammunition left, no pace bowling left.

BREAKING

Keshav Maharaj finishes it with a boundary!

What a finish.

Every Pakistan player sinks to their knees. They are heartbroken, they gave it absolutely everything. What a performance from both sides, both giving it their all.

The unlikely pair of Maharaj and Shamsi see South Africa home, and they finally complete a win with a chase.
