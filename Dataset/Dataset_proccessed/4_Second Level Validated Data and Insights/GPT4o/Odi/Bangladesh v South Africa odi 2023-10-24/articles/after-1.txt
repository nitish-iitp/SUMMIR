It was another day, another run feast for South Africa!

At the Wankhede Stadium on October 24, it rode on Quinton de Kock’s 174 and a blitzkrieg 90 from Heinrich Klassen to plunder 144 off the last ten overs, and put up a mammoth 382 for five, before handing a 149-run defeat to Bangladesh and bolster its chances of a last-four spot in the World Cup.
