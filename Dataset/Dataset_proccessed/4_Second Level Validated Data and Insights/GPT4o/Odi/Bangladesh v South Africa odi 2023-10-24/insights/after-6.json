        "South Africa captain Aiden Markram: 'It was another good day. Tough to grind it out at the end, but we thought sticking to what we believe in would take 10 wickets. Sometimes you can rush it. But all in all a great day.'",
        "Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan: 'Yes, I thought we bowled well for the first 25 overs, got three wickets and they were going at five-an-over. Then they kicked on, I thought Quinton de Kock batted really well and the way Heinrich Klaasen finished it off, we didn't have any answers to it.'",
        "Player of the match Quinton de Kock: 'To be honest I am a bit more tired than satisfied. It was a great day out for the guys. Everyone did their part and it is nice to get another two points on the board.'"
