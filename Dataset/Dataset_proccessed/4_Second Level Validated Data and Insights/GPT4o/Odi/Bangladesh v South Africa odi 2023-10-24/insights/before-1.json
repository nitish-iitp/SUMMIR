        "South Africa are flying high after the 229-run thrashing they handed England. They have the highest net-run rate among all 10 teams in this World Cup, and a victory against Bangladesh will propel them to the second spot.",
        "Bangladesh, on the other hand, are in the bottom half of the points table and are in dire need of stringing together some victories so that their journey doesn't come to an early end.",
        "Their batting has been the main letdown, especially their tendency to suffer collapses and not capitalise on solid platforms.",
        "The South African batters have been in roaring form, with telling contributions all through the batting order.",
        "South Africa currently ranks third for most wickets taken by teams in the 2023 World Cup.",

        "What to expect: Plenty of runs, with the pitch expected to aid the batters as it has so often done, and plenty of heat too with a maximum of 37 degree Celsius being forecast for the afternoon.",
        "Probable XIs: South Africa (SA): Quinton de Kock (WK), Temba Bavuma (C), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Lungi Ngidi, Gerald Coetzee.

        "Team news: South Africa: Bavuma, who missed the game against England on Saturday with an upset stomach, is likely to return at the expense of Hendricks.",
        "Bangladesh: A shoulder injury will keep Taskin Ahmed on the sidelines for a while longer. Bangladesh though are hoping that Shakib Al Hasan returns to full fitness.",
        "Tactics & strategy: South Africa: Same old same old: blow them away with the bat, make do with the ball.",
        "Tactics & strategy: Bangladesh: De Kock has had a couple of low scores after starting off with two centuries. Bangladesh will be hoping to take advantage of that through the trio of Mustafizur Rahman, Shakib and Mehidy.",
