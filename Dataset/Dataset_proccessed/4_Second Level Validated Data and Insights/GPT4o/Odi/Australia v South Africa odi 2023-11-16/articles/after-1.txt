Travis Head got the job done with bat and ball to help Australia edge past South Africa by three wickets and move into an eighth Cricket World Cup final, where they will play host nation India.

In what had until this point largely been a World Cup to forget for Head, he rose to the occasion for his country on Thursday evening.

And, it was with the ball where he had his greatest impact as the part-time off spinner broke a 95-run partnership between South African century-maker David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen when he clean bowled the latter.

The pair had seemed set to take the match away from Australia after coming together with the Proteas in dire trouble at 4-24.

But Head entered the fray and Klaasen played all around the delivery before it removed his leg stump from the ground.

FIVE QUICK HITS: South Africa rues dropped chances and quick blitz gives Aussies perfect start

Head later confessed he was stunned to get the dangerous Klaasen out with a straight one.

"Seeing the wicket, I was prepared to bowl a few overs ... I am always keen to have a bowl and contribute," Head said.

"[That was] straight as they come.

"He is an unbelievable player, he smacked me around in South Africa so when he went four, four, I knew I was under the pump.

"I am not sure how that one got through him."

On his very next ball he trapped Marco Jansen leg before, the South African reviewed it but DRS showed it was hitting leg stump.

Head would not get his hat-trick though, as Gerald Coetzee dug out another low-spinning delivery, but the damage was done and Australia were into the South African tail.

Despite that, Miller (101) went on to make a vital century as he frequently took to leg spinner Adam Zampa (0-55), saved South Africa from an embarrassing total, and gave them a chance.

But his innings ended just after he made his ton.

The middle-order star clobbered Australia captain Pat Cummins over the boundary to bring up his century and, two balls later, he looked to repeat the dose but was caught on the rope by Head.

While the South African tail offered little resistance, Miller was forced into rescue mode after Australian spearheads Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood ripped through the top order.

Starc set things in motion by getting Proteas skipper Temba Bavuma for a duck, before Cummins took a great catch off the bowling of Hazlewood to remove dangerman Quinton de Kock.

Hazlewood claimed 2-12 from eight overs and Mitchell Starc 3-34 from 10.

Hazlewood, in particular, was impressive, sending down three maidens and bowling 39 dots in 48 balls.

So good was his return, it marked the most economical figures of any Australian bowling eight overs or more since Nathan Bracken in 2006.

And when Cummins (3-51) removed Kagiso Rabada, South Africa were all out for 212.

Bavuma lamented the opportunity South Africa cost themselves early on.

"The way we started with the bat and ball was the turning point, we always had to play catch-up," he said.

"From 24-4, it was always going to be hard to get a competitive total."

Based on some of the mammoth totals this World Cup, the chase seemed academic, especially when David Warner and Head got Australia off to a flying start to be 0-60 after six overs.

But then things got complicated.

The reasons? Poor shot selection, a classic catch from Rassie van der Dussen and some excellent spin bowling from Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj.

By the end of the eighth over they were 2-62 after Warner went for 29, clean bowled by Aiden Markram. It was not a good shot.

Mitch Marsh would follow him in the next over for a duck as van der Dussen dived  up and out full length to his right and took an absolute screamer.

South Africa had life and hope.

Head, though, was not deterred.

His flashy shot making never changed as he went after the Proteas' attack, even if he was determined to take all of his chances.,

He had two.

First when on 40 he lashed one to the outfield and a diving Beusan Hendricks could not hold the catch.

The next ball, he gave Coetzee a half chance as he hammered one in the air back past the quick that raced to the boundary for four.

Then Klaasen gave him another life on 52 as he dropped a difficult edge at slip off Shamsi as the ball rose at him high and fast.

Shamsi, though, eventually got his man, bowling Head for 62.

It was the beginning of a steady decline with Australia at 3-106.

Marnus Labuschagne joined Steve Smith at the crease as the pair looked to steadily guide Australia to victory as they have so many times before but neither looked comfortable.

Shamsi thought he had Labuschagne for 9, but the umpire gave it not out. South Africa reviewed and the DRS showed the impact was umpire's call.

The next Shamsi over the reverse was true, the Aussie reviewed and umpire's call decision and this time he lucked out as replays showed the ball clipping leg stump.

Enter Glenn Maxwell, but there would be no big show for the hero against Afghanistan. He was gone for one after five balls as he swiped at a Shamsi delivery only to hear a death rattle.

Smith it seemed would steer the Aussies home before he too played a rash shot, off Coetzee. De Kock took the catch off a high ball.

That left Australia needing 39 runs with four wickets in hand and it looked like Josh Inglis would get them there before Coetzee removed his stumps.

Enter Cummins, who was dropped by de Kock, before he survived alongside Starc to guide Australia to a nervous but thrilling victory.

We'll wrap things up now

By Simon Smale

Thanks so much for joining us.

I hope you'll be as good to join us again on Sunday night when Australia takes on the awesome challenge of India in Ahmedabad in front of 130,000 frenzied supporters.

That was an incredibly tight and tense match, far closer than we thought it would be during the rain delay when South Africa was 4-40 and limping along under the lights at Eden Gardens.

At that stage it looked like this semifinal would be turning into a nightmare for South Africa.

And, although that was how it ended up, it still proved to be a paradise for those of us that love tight cricket matches.

Let's hope for just as much excitement on Sunday, shall we?

From me Simon Smale, good night and see you Sunday from 6:00pm AEDT.

Pat Cummins thrilled with victory

By Simon Smale

The Ashes, earlier this World Cup and now a semifinal - keading Australia home in a tight chase is becoming second nature to captain Pat these days.

"It's much easier than sitting in the dugout," he says.

"It's been a nerve-wracking couple of hours but great effort and a great game."

He paid credit to the whole team, but 37-year-old David Warner diving about in the field gets special praise, as does Josh Inglis's contribution with the bat and Travis Head with the ball.

He said Australia has got to embrace the pressure of being in a final.

"The stadium is going to be packed, pretty one-sided but got to embrace it.

"The 2015 World Cup … was a career highlight, so to be out there in a final in India, I can't wait."

Tevemba Bavuma is gutted

By Simon Smale

As you'd expect.

He looks and sounds crushed by the defeat.

Had you spoken to him half an hour after he had got out for a duck, followed quite quickly by three of his top order teammates, I imagine he was ready for defeat.

(Getty Images)

But given how hard South Africa fought, it must be hard to come to terms with.

"Quite hard to put it into words," he says.

"Congratulations to Australia. I thought they were outstanding for long periods today.

"Our character came through. We showed the resilience we talk about and a bit of dog fight.

"The way we started with the bat and ball was the turning point, we always had to play catch-up.

"From 24-4, it was always going to be hard to get a competitive total."

By Simon Smale

And why not?

He took 2-21 with the ball, a brilliant 62 from 48 at the top of the order in that brilliant and rapid 37-ball, 60-run partnership with David Warner.

"It's quite hard to unpack all of that," he says.

"Tense finish, amazing game.

"We knew how it [the surface] was going to play. We haven't seen much spin but we knew it was going to be a grind.

"Seeing the wicket, I was prepared to bowl a few overs, I'm always keen."

He says that given he broke his hand in the build up, he wasn't sure whether he would even be at the World Cup and is thrilled to be playing in the final.

"I never dreamed of being in a World Cup final against the best team of the competition so far."

Australia wins by three wickets!

By Simon Smale

(Getty Images)

Pat Cummins hits the winning runs and Australia get over the line, barely, against a brave South African side who looked like they were gone after a shocking start to the match.

The 22-run partnership at the end gets the plaudits, but Travis Head's 66 off 48 balls at the top of the order did the real job, breaking the back of a small but incredibly tricky chase.

Quinton de Kock is bumped into by the camera and told it to go away ( those were not the words that were used) but there is plenty of respect between the two sets of combatants out on the field.

46th over - Jansen comes back into the attack

By Simon Smale

He's not bowled since the fifth over of the innings - and was expensive at 0-27 from three overs.

Outside off, left alone.

Wide outside off, a bouncer, not called a wide but it would have had to be close.

There's a bouncer, a better one, but that's the two for the over and the umpires tell Jansen that.

FOUR! Brilliant from Starc! He waited for the fuller ball and punched it through midwicket for a boundary.

Australia needs 3 to win

Starc clips to midwicket but finds the man waiting there.

Good yorker to end the over.

Brilliant fielding at mid on saves a run or two.

You can cut it with a knife. Incredible drama.

Cummins fends to point again, as Coetzee winces with that possible calf injury. No run scored though, the fielder at cover point is sharp.

Driven through the air up through cover! But a single taken and the ball falls safe!

CHANCE! Cummins plays a rising ball off the very top of the bat, an inch higher and that could have gone anywhere, but as it is, it hits the sticker on the bat and falls safe.

Cummins needs a new bat! That's broken it! 150kph right on the splice will do that.

Coetzee is getting some treatment on his calf while Cummins gets a new bat.

FOUR! Cummins drives square and gets a boundary! Lovely shot, perfectly guided down backward of point.

Solid defence that time.

Fuller ball, driven away by Cummins for no run to mid off.

Cummins gets out of the way of a bouncer, good short ball and Cummins played it well.

No ball! And a single off it too!  The ball was a full toss above head height. It will be a free hit too.
