Australia have been comprehensively outclassed by South Africa, losing by a record 134 runs to move to a 0-2 record at the men's Cricket World Cup.

It is Australia's biggest loss by runs in the tournament's history, as the five-time champions were all out for 177 in the 41st over, chasing 312 to win.

Having sent the Proteas in to bat, nothing went right for the Australians, who were savaged by opening batter Quinton de Kock (109 off 106) as South Africa reached 7-311, which was helped by some sloppy Australian fielding.

Australia put down six catches as de Kock smashed a second straight World Cup century to power South Africa to their total.

"Probably not much needs to be said tonight," said Australia captain Pat Cummins, whose 1-71 off nine overs were the worst figures of any bowler on the day.

"I think everyone's hurting."

Australia could do little in response with the bat.

Openers David Warner and Mitchell Marsh fell cheaply before South African quick Kagiso Rabada took big wickets.

First he trapped Steve Smith LBW, the Australian star stunned to be given out on review, as the ball was shown to be hitting the top of leg stump.

Smith was looking around bemused as he slowly made his way off the field and even on-field umpire Joel Wilson had a wry smile as he signalled the change of decision.

Rabada then clean bowled Josh Inglis (5), in the side replacing wicketkeeper Alex Carey, before he got Marcus Stoinis caught behind down the leg side for the same score.

Like Smith, Stoinis was baffled when a South African review overturned the on-field decision of not out.

The ball was going down the leg side and appeared to clip Stoinis's right glove on the way through to de Kock, but his hand was off the bat when there was a spike on Snicko.

Third umpire Richard Kettleborough said it was still out because "the hand is connected to the top hand, therefore in contact with the bat".

Former Australia captain Aaron Finch disagreed in commentary, saying "that bottom hand is a long way away from the top hand".

He had to go, and Australia had at that point lost 4-20 inside eight overs, with Glenn Maxwell also falling caught and bowled to spinner Keshav Maharaj.

Stoinis struggled upon his return to the side in the field too, bowling just two overs and putting down an easy catch.

Stoinis is averaging 16.37 from his last 32 ODIs and has failed to pass 50 since March 2019.

A 69-run partnership between Marnus Labuschagne (46) and Mitchell Starc (27) was the only time in the match Australia looked remotely comfortable.

The result leaves Australia staring down the barrel early in the lengthy tournament and they simply have to beat Sri Lanka on Monday at the same venue if they are to arrest their sliding ladder position and net run rate.
