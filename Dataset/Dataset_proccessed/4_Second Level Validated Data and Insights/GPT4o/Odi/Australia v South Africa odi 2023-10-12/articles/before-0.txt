Preview

Australia will take on South Africa in the 10th match of the ODI World Cup 2023 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. The former five time champions lost their opener in the flagship tournament to the hosts India by six wickets, while the upcoming opponents got the better of Sri Lanka by 102 runs. Both these cricketing nations played each other in five one-sided bilateral ODI matches last month, ending in favour of South Africa by 3-2 after two early losses against Australia, which could lead to a keenly contested match between them on October 12.

Analysis

Apart from the couple of 40s from the experienced duo of David Warner and Steve Smith, the rest of the Australian batting lineup struggled massively against the Indian spinners in Chennai. In the bowling side of things, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood bowled impressive first spells under lights, but the rest of the Australian lineup didn’t step up for them to defend a total of 199 against India.

Meanwhile, the South Africa batting lineup set the stage alight in Delhi against Sri Lanka, with Quinton de Kock, Rassie van der Dussen, and Aiden Markram scoring centuries, to help the team reach a total in excess of 400. The bowling lineup for the Proteas wasn’t quite up to the mark, but Gerald Coetzee picked up three wickets to ensure a comfortable win at the very end.
