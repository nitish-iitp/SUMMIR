James Wallace

That’s it from me for today. Thanks to Jonathan Howcroft for his sublime steering of the good ship OBO in the earlier session and thanks to you for tuning in.

Next up in the CWC is New Zealand v Bangladesh tomorrow followed by a truly unmissable sporting occasion – India v Pakistan at the 130,000 seater stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday - reckon that one might be a full house. Goosebumps on your goosebumps. Until then, goodnight!

Here comes a rather stern faced Pat Cummins, he’s probably just had a peek at that Minus 1.85 Net Run Rate…

Quinny batted really well but we were happy with keeping them to 310, we felt it was a chaseable score. It looked like hard work out there tonight, it zipped around now plenty but we were well off the mark.

If we want to be challenging for this tournament you’ve got to adapt to all conditions. Not much needs to be said tonight, everyone’s hurting. We’ve got a few days until the next game and we’ll try to make amends.

With that he lopes off into the Lucknow night. Plenty to ponder for Pat.

Since taking a 2-0 series lead in South Africa at the start of September, Australia's men have lost 7 of their next 8 ODIs 😬

After two rounds of matches, they're bottom of the 2023 World Cup table.#CWC23 pic.twitter.com/XA15auOUcW

Victorious Captain Temba Bavuma speaks: Could he be any more nonchalant?

I was glad to lose to the toss because things worked out in our favour! I was scratching around (with the bat) so Quinton deserves to be credited a lot. I’d be really greedy if I said there were areas to improve, a near-perfect game with the bat and with the ball, the guys dominated and showed their skills.”

Character is the biggest thing we talk about and we showed it today. We’ll enjoy the individual performances then come back tomorrow and find ways to get better as a team.”

Ominous final line for everyone else, his side looked top notch today and sit top of the table.

South Africa trounce Australia by 134 runs in Lucknow. Two unexpected possibilities are emerging: South Africa may reach the semis, and Australia may not #CWC2023

Quinton de Kock is Player of the Match:

He followed up his century against Sri Lanka with an effervescent ton at the top of the order to set his side up for a commanding total. De Kock says:

It’s a great win for the boys, we assessed conditions well and played accordingly. We stuck to our strengths and came out on top. They (Australia) were potent up front with the ball so we assessed our scoring options. I definitely thought it was an above-par score from us, it gets harder at night in Lucknow and that proved true.

It was sweaty and humid but the bowlers bowled with intensity and didn’t give them a sniff up front. We are pretty pleased with ourselves but we’re only two games in - anything can happen and quickly, so we won’t get too high and just try to take it game by game.”

SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY 134 RUNS!

Huge win for the Proteas, that was a shellacking! Ngidi and Rabada were lethal with the new ball and they were backed up really well by the spinners Shamsi and Maharaj. Australia were very poor, reduced to 70-6 they spluttered along interminably for nearly twenty overs, Labuschagne and Starc ekeing out a paint-drying partnership of 69 runs to make the defeat look slightly less comprehensive on paper than it actually was. Plenty for Pat Cummins’ side to chow down on, they were hopeless in the field too, dropping catches and generally looking flatter than ten day old Tizer.

A HUGE performance and a HUGE victory for South Africa over Australia! 😤💪 pic.twitter.com/uH2Igm86Gg

That’s yer lot! Two balls later and it is all over, Hazlewood skies one straight up in to the brooding Lucknow sky and is well caught by Kagiso Rabada!

40th over: Australia 174-8 (Cummins 22, Zampa 10) Well bolwed! Rabada has Zampa in all sorts of strife with two beauties to start the over. Five runs off it.

On the positive side, Travis Head is expected to be fit in time to join the team for the flight home after the group stages. #CWC23

39th over: Australia 169-8 (Cummins 21, Zampa 6) Just a single off Shamsi as Australia approach their 40th over. I hope they are happy.

Here’s the Stoinis dismissal from earlier. You can be Judge Judy and electrocutioner:

Out or not out? 🤔

Marcus Stoinis was given out by the third umpire on review, but he wasn't happy..

38th over: Australia 168-8 (Cummins 21, Zampa 5) Shot! Big Pat gets on the front dawg and smashes Rabada through cover for four! Cummins collects another couple with a back foot punch, Kagiso has seen enough and slams the final two balls in short for a couple of dots.

37th over: Australia 162-8 (Cummins 15, Zampa 5) Zampa gets involved with the run scoring, Shamsi sends down a half-tracker and is dispatched over the leg side. On we go.

“I for one really enjoyed Marnus’s surrealist art performance. Thanks for watching that so I didn’t have to!” The pleasure was all… yours, James Male.

36th over: Australia 156-8 (Cummins 14, Zampa 0) Cummins isn’t going to scratch around by the looks of it, he pumps Marco Jansen for three fours and Australia are in danger of a collective nosebleed as they take FOURTEEN runs off the over.

“This whole business of a team batting meekly to preserve a Net Run Rate is very silly and could only be of interest to the kind of saddo who takes pleasure in seeing an Australian sports team being subjected to a slow humiliation over the course of an after... hang on, what channel is this on again?”

35th over: Australia 143-8 (Cummins 1, Zampa 0) Maharaj finishes his ten over spell by pocketing Labuschagne, a length ball lofted tamely to Bavuma at short cover. That wasn’t fun while it lasted. Adam Zampa is the new man and he pats back two dots. Maharaj ends with figures of 2-30 off his ten overs. Canny.

34th over: Australia 142-7 (Labuschagne 46, Cummins 1) Cummins is the new batter, he gets off the mark with a fence into the leg side. South Africa need three more wickets – Australia? They need 170 odd runs. Ahem.

33rd over: Australia 138-6 (Labuschagne 43, Starc 27) Maharaj once more, four runs off the over. The required rate sneaks over tens. The 19th over seems like a lifetime ago:

NRR was introduced to encourage faster scoring but works in reverse now when chasing sides are cooked. Australia have been batting to protect it (not at all unreasonably!) since the 19th over. #CWC2023

32nd over: Australia 134-6 (Labuschagne 40, Starc 27) Yes! Mitchell Starc swings his long handle and connects sweetly with a short ball from the returning Marco Jansen*, pinging it into the leg side boundary for four. Happy now? Well, no, not really. The run rate rises quicker than Mr Creosote’s cholesterol.

*Did Proteas Rhys Meyers catch on? C’mon people!

31st over: Australia 128-6 (Labuschagne 39, Starc 22) First over back after drinks and the Aussies must’ve been quaffing rocketfuel, Marnus launches… oh who am I kidding – it’s three singles eked off Maharaj.

30th over: Australia 125-6 (Labuschagne 38, Starc 20) Chuckling at Marnus, he’s 29 from 58. Can’t wait for him to end on 54 not out off a trillion balls. Oh what’s this! Almost as if he’s got the OBO on an ear feed he suddenly comes to life and plays a couple of expansive strokes - Attaboy Marnus! A reverse-sweep is lapped for for behind square and next ball a powerful cut to the point fence. Time for a drink. Make mine large and strong.

29th over: Australia 115-6 (Labuschagne 25, Starc 17) Matthew Hayden is combusting in the commentary box – safe to say he don’t like what he sees from Australia’s batting. Other sides will be watching this and thinking that they have a real chance against this Aussie side, they’ve been so poor today. Dropped catches, wayward bowling, slack fielding and limp batting. Plenty for Haydos to stick his spurs into!

I think if you're looking for Marnus Labuschagne to carry on scoring at three an over as your only remaining goal in a match, it hasn't gone that well.

27th over: Australia 108-6 (Labuschagne 25, Starc 17) Ngidi scuds one in short and it rears up to clang Starc on the lid. There’s a delay while he is checked over, a new helmet is sent for and he seems to be good to continue. That was a brute of a ball, smashed Starc right on the badge. Symbolism innit.

26th over: Australia 104-6 (Labuschagne 23, Starc 16) Mitch Starc finally gives it some humpty, or tries to at least, a thick edge flies away fine for a boundary. Over six overs since the last boundary was struck by my calculations. Hundred up for Australia… you’re still thinking about the bad news aren’t you?

25th over: Australia 95-6 (Labuschagne 22, Starc 8) Back comes Ngidi, he was fantastic with the new ball earlier. Marnus pokes off the back foot for a couple but apart from that there is nowt to report. What’s the weather like where you are? Read any good books lately?

Look, it's simple, ok. Your hand is attached to your wrist, yeah? And then to your shoulder... across your neck to your other shoulder. Still attached, right? Ok now go down your other arm, to the hand, okay? Yeah? And that hand's holding the bat, right?

Yeah

Nothing like an Aussie anhilation to bring the OBO mailbag to life:

“Quite remarkable goings on! South Africa are all over the Aussies like an unpleasant skin complaint. The Australians need some Lucknow.”

“Gercha James”

Back at ya, David Bowen

“Do you think Howard Webb will feel a sense of crossover duty to contact Australia about the reviews today and then describe how they use those instances to ‘take further learnings?’ Although both seem out to me so not sure what all the antipodean fuss is about. Smudge in particular.”

20th over: Australia 80-6 (Labuschagne 10, Starc 6) Starc smears into the leg side to pick up a (futile) four. This is all about NRR damage limitation now for Australia. A thumping here will make it even harder for them to get through to the semis – you’d think they will have to win all of their remaining games after this loss. Marnus is still at the crease by the way, forgot about him ‘mongst the carnage didn’t you*.

19th over: Australia 71-6 (Labuschagne 9, Starc 1) Maharaj sends down another tight over, slim pickings for Australia, just two off it. Up in the dressing room Stoinis is spewing, he’s only going to get more angry the more angles he sees:

WICKET! Stoinis c de Kock b Rabada 5 (Australia 70-6)

Controversy! Marcus Stoinis is given out gloving the ball down the leg side, the replays seem to show that his lower glove was off the handle when the ball made contact but the third umpire sees it differently and gives it OUT! Hmmm not sure about that one, still, Stoinis has to go and Australia are staring down the barrel in Lucknow.

Rabada has it on a string and looks like he could take a wicket every ball.

Labuschagne gets a fluky inside edge past the stumps and it runs away for four, other than that it is five dots for Rabada and a fistful of pressure.

Maxwell throws the kitchen sink, toaster and microwave at the next ball but only manages to plink it for a spawny two runs. Yeeesh! How did that miss?! Maxwell goes for an almighty yahoo and connects with nowt but fresh air. The ball just missing the timbers. Don’t go anywhere… unless you are Australian, obvs.
