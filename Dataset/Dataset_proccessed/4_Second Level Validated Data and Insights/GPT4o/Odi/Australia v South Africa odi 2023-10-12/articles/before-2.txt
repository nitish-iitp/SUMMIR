Match Preview:


In a big-ticket ICC ODI World Cup 2023 matchup, Australia and South Africa lock horns at the Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow. Both teams were part of an ODI series just before the marquee tournament where the Proteas registered a comeback win. Continuing this form in the World Cup, South Africa won their opening match against Sri Lanka while Australia lost against India in Chennai.

Pitch Report:


The Ekana Cricket Stadium in  Lucknow has produced often produced spin-friendly tracks with an average score of 210. Here, the batters are often seen struggling to score runs as slower bowlers capitalise. Fast bowlers can also find some movement with the new ball. Batting second on this ground could be slightly easier if the dew factor comes into play. 


Team Analysis:


Australia:

Despite being one of the tournament favourites, Australia had a horrid start to their campaign with a six-wicket loss against India. The batters once again struggled to play spin as Ravindra Jadeja starred with a three-wicket spell. But the bowling performed well as the pacers ran through the Indian top order easily. 

SportsTiger Playing XI of  Australia: 


David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Alex Carey (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (c), Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

South Africa: 


On the other hand, South Africa has grown into confidence with their recent ODI results over the last month. The Proteas batting has been in incredible form with the likes of Aiden Markram, Henrich Klassen and Rassie van der Dussen scoring a lot of runs. The bowling could still be an area of improvement as they conceded 326 in their World Cup opener against Sri Lanka.

SportsTiger Playing XI of South Africa: 


Quinton de Kock (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Gerald Coetzee, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi


Match Prediction:


  


Conclusion:

South Africa has a better chance to win this fixture and defeat Australia to register their second-straight win in the ICC ODI World Cup 2023.
