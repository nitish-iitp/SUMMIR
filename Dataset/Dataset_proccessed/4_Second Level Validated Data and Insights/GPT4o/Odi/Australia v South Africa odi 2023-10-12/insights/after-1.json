        "South Africa captain Temba Bavuma: 'I think 311 was a couple over par, probably about 290/300 was par. I'm glad we lost the toss because we were going to chase, but I think Quinton getting a score like that needs to be credited a lot.'",
        "Australia captain Pat Cummins: 'I thought Quinton de Kock batted really well, we couldn't get a breakthrough but from where they were, we were quite happy and, on that wicket, thought 311 was chaseable.'",
        "Player of the match, South Africa's Quinton de Kock: 'It was a great win for the boys. We didn't really know how the wicket was going to play but we assessed conditions really well and played accordingly.'"
