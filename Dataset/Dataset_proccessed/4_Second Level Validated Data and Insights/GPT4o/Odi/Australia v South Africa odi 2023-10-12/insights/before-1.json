        "Australia\u2019s blockbuster start to their World Cup campaign continues as they take on an in-form South Africa in Lucknow, just days after suffering a dramatic opening round defeat to India.",
        "Australia\u2019s loss to India means that a victory against a strong South African team is needed to prevent their World Cup campaign from requiring life support just a week into the tournament.",
        "The reason South Africa are so feared is that they boast what is arguably the most powerful batting line-up in all of cricket. A fact they duly proved by posting the highest ever World Cup total in their win against Sri Lanka, with Quinton de Kock, Rassie van der Dussen and Aiden Markram all striking centuries.",
        "The result is that a shallow Australian bowling attack, featuring just one frontline spinner in Adam Zampa, will be put to the test.",
        "Adam Zampa will be required to send down 10 overs against a South African batting line-up that is as powerful as any in world cricket.",
        "Less than a month ago that same batting line-up smashed Zampa for a record-equaling 113 runs from his 10 overs and the Aussie spinner has a serious task on his hands."
