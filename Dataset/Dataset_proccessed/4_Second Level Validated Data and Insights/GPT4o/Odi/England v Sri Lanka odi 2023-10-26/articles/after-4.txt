Right, that's all folks

A nourishing victory for Sri Lanka, who have reignited their World Cup campaign with back-to-back wins over the Netherlands and England. The return of Angelo Mathews has reinforced their resolve. "It was a good all-round performance by the entire team," says Mathews. "It's all about attitude. We just wanted to go all-out today and we knew if we beat England we are giving ourselves a good chance to make the semi-finals."

As far as England are concerned, another demoralising defeat. They are not out of it yet, but need a host of results elsewhere to go their way. Even then, their net run rate of -1.634 makes the situation look terminal. "It’s incredibly tough," said a downbeat Jos Buttler at the presentations. "It's been an incredibly disappointing tournament."

England head coach Matthew Mott was equally disappointed: "We came here full of hope to turn things around and we're well off the mark. It's going to be a real test of character to go through the next week and see what we can salvage."

That's all from us here. Join us tomorrow for Pakistan versus South Africa in Chennai.

Sri Lanka win by 8 wickets!
Sri Lanka beat England in a World Cup - again•Associated Press

Pathum Nissanka finishes it in style, smashing Adil Rashid for six over long on to confirm a second win of the competition, consigning England to their fourth defeat.

It's the fifth time Sri Lanka have beaten England in World Cups, and all the more damning for Jos Buttler's side is they have succumbed to a third heavy loss. This one registers as the shortest match of the tournament (59 overs).

Lahiru Kumara is player of the match for his 3 for 35, accounting for the big wickets of Jos Buttler, Liam Livingstone and Ben Stokes and keeping Sri Lanka's target to a very manageable 157.

Same old Samarawickrama
Sadeera Samarawickrama continued providing stability•Associated Press

Fifty up for the classy right-hander, from 44 deliveries. He's been leading the run-scoring charts for Sri Lanka in this World Cup thanks to 108 against Pakistan and an unbeaten 91 versus the Netherlands, and has taken charge here against England.

With that century coming in a losing cause, this is probably the standout knock of his month so far. Not least because he arrived at the crease in the sixth over, England up and about with David Willey's double strike leaving his team nervy on 23 for 2.

He has been the more proactive of the two batters, allowing Nissanka to play his usual game, quelling any threat of an upset when chasing a sub-par target of 157. The pair brought up their century stand at the end of the 21st over - from 94 deliveries - and are easing home.

Four in four for Nissanka
Pathum Nissanka goes over the top with Jos Buttler behind the stumps•Getty Images

A glorious extra cover drive brings Pathum Nissanka a half-century from 54 deliveries. He's been there from the start of this chase, getting off the mark with a picture-perfect on drive – the first of seven crisp boundaries (including a gorgeous six off Adil Rashid) and counting.

Having started the World Cup with a duck against South Africa, he has passed fifty in each of his last four innings and looks set to not only beat the 61 he managed two knocks ago against Australia, but guide his country to their second win of the competition.

He has also moved past a thousand ODI runs this year - the second to do so after India's Shubman Gill.

Knock on Wood?
151
kph - Wood brings the heat

Mark Wood dials up the speedometer in his first over. Pace, however, is not everything. Wood's first ball was short, wide and slapped away for four with ease by Samarawickrama. Previous outings against New Zealand and South Africa saw the Durham quick go at an economy rate of 11 and 10.85, respectively, and there was a thought he might be taken out of the XI for this match.

Defending a low total, Wood will have to re-emerge as a difference maker. From that first ball, his length and line has been better, causing Samarawickrama discomfort in his second over, resulting in an uncontrolled pull around the corner that drops short of Liam Livingstone at deep fine leg. He then pinged the right-hander's bottom hand with a short delivery that brought the Sri Lanka physio out to the middle.

Matt Roller on David Willey
Left armer's early brace gives England hope•Associated Press

David Willey is into the game early in the second innings, removing two of Sri Lanka’s key batters inside his first three overs: Kusal Perera’s leading edge spooned up to Ben Stokes at mid-off, and Jos Buttler did well to get underneath a top-edged slog-sweep to remove Kusal Mendis. He celebrated both wickets with roars, perhaps letting out some pent-up frustration.

Willey discovered before travelling to India that he was the only member of England’s World Cup squad not to be offered a central contract for next year. “It’s fair to say David Willey wasn’t best pleased,” Rob Key, England’s managing director, said on Tuesday. “It’s bloody tough, to be honest.”

At 33, Willey seems unlikely to be part of England’s plans for the 2027 World Cup – but the same could be said of a fair chunk of the players offered one-year deals, and he will be in the selection mix for next year’s T20 World Cup. He will relish the opportunity to prove his point to the ECB in this run chase.

Willey strikes... but misses out on 2 in 2!

Early movement from the left-armer, and Kusal Perera is snared as a result!

Perera is squared up, lobbing a catch to Ben Stokes running in from mid off. But with the very next delivery, Willey gets an edge from Kusal Mendis - Sri Lanka's skipper and second top-scorer - which flies through Joe Root at first slip, who can't react in time to a fierce thrash from the right-hander.

There is plenty of movement on offer for England's seamers, as there was for Sri Lanka.

England all out for 156!

The law of the collapse/trash batting performance states there is always a joke of a run out. And while we've already had one with Joe Root's dismissal, Adil Rashid has provided a real all-timer.

Kusal Mendis collected a delivery down the leg side, and is veering to toss the ball around the field when he notices Adil Rashid idly walking out of the crease at the nonstriker's end. A brilliant throw hits the stumps flush with Rashid failing to reclaim his ground in time.

The next over brought boundaries from Mark Wood and David Willey, but the former's attempt at charging sees him stumped off Maheesh Theekshana - the off spinner's first wicket - and the innings is wrapped up in 33.2 overs.

Sri Lanka have been as good as England have been abject - highlighted by the fact this is the lowest ODI total at the Chinnaswamy stadium.

Kumara returns to see off Stokes

The battle of the burly men falls Sri Lanka's way!

Kumara, brought back into the attack for the 31st over, goes short to Stokes first up. The hero of 2019 sees an opportunity to free his arms and swing away to the leg side. But his strike isn't all the way there - partly because the ball is not as quick as anticipated - and finds sub fielder Dushan Hemantha lurking at deep midwicket.

Angelo Mathews (again) and Kasun Rajitha not just reasserting control but nipping a few important allrounders out in the process.

Mathews profited from a poor stroke from Moeen Ali, clothing a neither here nor there drive to backward point. Rajitha has television umpire Ahsan Raza to thank, deciding Samarawickrama's hands were under the ball skewed his way by Chris Woakes. The close-ups were blurry but the benefit of doubt went to the fielder.

The first sign of calculated aggression from England comes in Dhananjaya de Silva's first over. Moeen Ali gets one out of the screws through cover off the first delivery, before Ben Stokes muscles one through midwicket for his third boundary. Lahiru Kumara coming out of the attack has given the defending champions an opportunity to go a little harder in these middle overs.

Jos Buttler's poor form continues
There was more gloom for Jos Buttler in Bangalore•Associated Press

The struggles of England's white ball captain go on.

Having started with 43 in the opener against New Zealand, Buttler was on a run of 20, 9 and 15 before Lahiru Kumara found his edge moments ago for 8. Yet again, it was a length ball outside off stump - Buttler's attempt at a drive with minimal footwork bringing about an excellent diving catch from Kusal Mendis behind the stumps.

Buttler's average batting in the top six in India is now a paltry 14.90 - the third lowest for any batter with a minimum of 10 innings.

Just to make matters worse, the impressive Kumara has just snared Liam Livingstone leg before. England are reeling on 85 for 5 after 17 overs.

He's done it again!

Try as you might - and Sri Lanka's selectors have tried - but you cannot keep Angelo Mathews out of the game.

He was minding his own business at backward point when Joe Root moved back to cut with no real intent. The England batter set off for a single but was sent back by Bairstow. By then, Mathews was swooping on the ball, which bounced nicely into his hands, before throwing to Kusal Mendis who caught Root short of his ground.

The returning Mathews gets the breakthrough!

The game may have changed, but it's still the same. Angelo Mathews enjoys putting one over England and despite not having bowled one of these white balls for his country in three years - save a cursory over in a T20i against West Indies back in March 2021 - he has a wicket with his third ball!

The 36-year old began over the wicket to Dawid Malan, and gets one to shape away late, across the left-hander, through to Mendis. The umpire was unmoved but the keeper-captain was reviewing before the DRS countdown had even begun. The returning veteran is in the game already, striking a vital blow for Sri Lanka as Malan was looking in the mood with six fours in his 28.

Matt Roller on Jonny Bairstow
Jonny Bairstow has so far failed to launch at this World Cup•Associated Press

Bairstow was seething when he was given out lbw first-ball off Fazalhaq Farooqi in England’s defeat to Afghanistan in Delhi, shooting Rod Tucker a glare on his way off. Bairstow reviewed the decision but it was upheld – albeit only just, with ball-tracking returning ‘Umpire’s Call’ on both ‘Impact’ and ‘Hitting’. He was reluctant to address it when speaking to the media in Mumbai, saying only: “The decision the other day was the decision the other day.”

Perhaps Bairstow will feel as though the stroke of luck that fell his way off the first ball of England’s innings today is the change in fortune that he needs. Sri Lanka conferred throughout their allotted 15 seconds before opting against a review, but replays confirmed that Dilshan Madushanka’s inswinger flicked his front pad before hitting his bat, and ball-tracking projected that the ball would have crashed into the stumps.

Oh my... Sri Lanka miss out on Jonny Bairstow first ball!

The opener has had an issue with the ball coming in since, well, forever... and left-armer Dilshan Madushanka has been getting the ball hooping into right-handers from the get-go.

That's no different here, as Bairstow presses forward and squeezes the ball down the ground for three. But replays show the ball struck pad before bat. And soon after Dawid Malan wafts at the second delivery of the innings, replays on the big screen confirmed not only was it pad first, but the ball pitched in line and was predicted to clatter into middle and leg stump!

No mistakes after the Mumbai roasting - Jos Buttler has decided his team are going to set this time around. Those three changes to the XI confirmed, with Harry Brook and Gus Atkinson unlucky to miss out...

Sri Lanka skipper Kusal Mendis says he would have done the same and was particularly enthused at being able to welcome Angelo Mathews back into the XI

Here we go...
Angelo Mathews, drafted in place of the injured Matheesha Pathirana, trains on match day•Getty Images

Greetings from Bangalore for this meeting between 7th and 8th, as Sri Lanka and England face off in the battle of the former champions who both look a bit naff.

It’s three defeats each going into this, with one side with a little more reason to think things should have been very different after four games. That is England, of course, nursing some quite brutal wounds from the 229-run battering at the hands of South Africa.

Jos Buttler and Matthew Mott made three changes to the team that day and the word from our man on the ground Matt Roller is three more are incoming to put them back to where they started in terms of allrounders...

And yet, it might not be the biggest bit of team news of the day. In a WWE-style return, Angelo Mathews is back! He has played just three ODIs in the last two-and-a-half years and there's a sense his presence is a direct result of Sri Lanka yearning for another adult in the room amid their early-tournament panic.

Who knows whether he will actually make the cut. For now, dip into our preview ahead of the toss at the top of the hour
