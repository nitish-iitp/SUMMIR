Preview

In the 25th match of the ODI World Cup 2023, England will go head-to-head against Sri Lanka at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. The Three Lions got their campaign in the flagship tournament on track with a win over Bangladesh after losing their opening game against New Zealand but got on the backfoot after losing their next two fixtures. On the other hand, Sri Lanka are also having a similar campaign as they have won only one game so far in the tournament which came in their last match against Netherlands.

 

Toss Prediction

      

After the first four matches of their respective ODI World Cup 2023 campaigns, England have won two tosses, while Sri Lanka did it three times. Therefore, it is more likely that the Lankans will win the battle of the toss against the Three Lions at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on October 26.

 

Win Possibility

      

While the Sri Lankans won their last match against the Netherlands, England are coming off a two-match defeat. While both teams are currently reeling in the bottom half of the points table with similar fortunes, England look a better team on paper with some experienced players in their side. Ben Stokes’ return is also a plus-point for the side, meanwhile Sri Lanka are struggling with several injuries with Matheesha Pathirana also doubtful for remainder of the tournament. Hence, we feel that England will come out on top in this fixture.

 

Predicted Powerplay Score and First Innings Score

       

The average first innings score at the M. Chinnaswamy  Stadium in Bengaluru is 235, but the pitches at this venue in the ODI World Cup 2023 have produced totals in the range of 300 and beyond. As a result of that, the first innings score between England and Sri Lanka could be in the range of 210-230, while the powerplay score could be in the range of 60 - 70.
