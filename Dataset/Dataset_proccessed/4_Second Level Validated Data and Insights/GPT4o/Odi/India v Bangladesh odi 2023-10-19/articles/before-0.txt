Match Preview:


After a thumping win over Pakistan, India will take on Bangladesh at the MCA Stadium in Pune. The Men in Blue have dominated the home World Cup with three wins out of three games. Whereas Bangladesh suffered its second consecutive defeat in the tournament after losing to New Zealand by seven wickets in Chennai. 

Pitch Report:


The MCA Stadium in Pune has produced great batting tracks with an average score of 305. Here, the batters tend to capitalise on its small boundaries. But bowlers can come as the pitch allows fast bowlers to extract some movement with the new ball, especially in the second innings. Similarly, the spinners could get some turn as the pitch settles down.

Team Ne ws:


Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan could miss the game in Pune due to a fitness issue as he was diagnosed with a quad tear.  Al Hasan  was part of the practice sessions ahead of the game but his selection will be a game-time decision, as per the Bangladesh coach.

Team Analysis: 

India:

The Rohit Sharma-led Team India has dominated every opponent so far in the tournament. The batting has been in exquisite form, especially in the top order. Similarly, the bowling department has seemingly over-performed and firmly made the Men in Blue one of the top favourites for the title. The only worry for the Indian team would be the batting of its lower-order players as they haven’t been tested in the tournament.

SportsTiger Playing XI of India


Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj


Bangladesh


On the other hand, Bangladesh haven’t been able to build on their victorious start and has suffered two back-to-back defeats. The Bangladeshi batting has been their biggest letdown so far as the top order has failed to fire and the experienced duo of Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim have looked decent. Similarly, the bowling attack hasn’t looked potent and has been one of the key reasons behind their poor start.

SportsTiger Playing XI of Bangladesh

Litton Das, Tanzid Hasan, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Najmul Hossain Shanto  (c) , Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Taskin Ahmed,  Mahedi Hasan,  Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam

Match Prediction:

 


Conclusion:

India has a better chance to win this fixture and defeat Bangladesh to register its fourth straight win in the ICC ODI World Cup 2023.
