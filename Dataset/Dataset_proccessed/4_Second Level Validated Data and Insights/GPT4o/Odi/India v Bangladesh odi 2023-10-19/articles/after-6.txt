Kohli reaches his hundred with a six!
103
from 97 balls, 6x4, 4x6

Kohli has his 48th ODI hundred (oh, and India won by seven wickets, but that is clearly the secondary consideration right now...!) He's got there with a vast swipe for six over deep midwicket, although there were mildly farcical scenes off the first ball of the over, as Nasum Ahmed fired his first ball down the leg-side, and umpire Kettleborough declined to single the wide, potentially informed by Kohli's frustrated glare from the far end. It would have made no difference... two balls later, the ball is outta here, and India are four from four!

Shiva Jayaraman has already crunched the numbers for us:

"The number of last-ball-of-the-over singles taken by batters in their 80s and 90s in ODI chases in the last 15 years; that's how you get 27 hundreds.

Another smashed four through midwicket makes it 15 needed from 15... and look at that, he's turned down a single to deep extra cover! If ever there was any doubt what's afoot, Kohli makes it plain... and when he belts his next ball high over deep midwicket for six, the crowd get right behind their man!

A single off the last ball, and it's eight from eight... then a wide on the bouncer! Kohli has to get there with a boundary now...

For his next trick, a nudge off the pads to short midwicket, and there's so little pace that he can rush back for two... Six to win it!

He loses his shape with a heave through the covers, and under-edges past his stumps...

A yorker from Hasan follows, and he squeezes out to midwicket for another two... it's four needed from four!

Another wipe to deep midwicket, and he turns down the single with only one ball remaining... no faith in KL it seems!

But this time, he pushes calmly to long-on, jogs through to keep the strike... three runs needed, three runs remaining!

Perhaps the only matter of intrigue left in this chase was whether Kohli might be able to score enough of the remaining runs to reach his 48th ODI hundred (and 78th across formats) before the victory could be sealed. KL Rahul's burst of acceleration has seen to that, however. A six and a four in quick succession, as the leaky Shoriful fed his pull with a pair of half-trackers, has left Kohli needing 26 of the remaining 27 runs...

but hang on, he's just hung back in his crease to smoke a big six over long-on as Hasan Mahmud drops one short... it's 20 from 20, and the single at the end of the over makes it 19 from 19... it's back on like donkey kong!

With barely three an over needed, it's a procession now, as the 200 comes up with another clip off the pads for a single to backward square. Any temptation to heed net run-rate? I suspect India just focus on winning, and let the others worry about that aspect.

A gallop to the pitch off Mehidy Hasan Miraz, and Shreyas Iyer has given his innings away in a needlessly hot-headed blow. A huge hoist across the line, the ball plummets out of the floodlights and into the safe hands of Mahmudullah at midwicket. Rahul enters the fray - he's done alright in the tournament so far, 116 runs in two innings without dismissal. And a crunched cut for four from his third ball confirms he's in a good space once more.

Kohli rolls on to his fifty
50
from 48 balls, 4x4, 1x6

A meaty pull in front of square, followed by a nudge to leg for the landmark run, and Virat Kohli brings up his 116th score of fifty or more in 285 ODIs. It's been another masterfully unhurried display, with just four fours and a six down the ground off Hasan Mahmud in between his familiarly forceful running between the wickets. He's faced 48 of the 86 balls since he's been at the crease, and drawn any remaining sting from Bangladesh's attack. Still a way to go yet, but on his watch it's a matter of when, not if.

Halfway ponderings
Virat Kohli was off to a flyer•Associated Press

Twenty-five overs gone, and we won't be requiring 25 more to decide this one. India are strolling to another stress-free victory in a hugely composed campaign, although New Zealand in Dharamsala next week could be livelier, given how much of a threat the Kiwi quicks have been in this tournament so far.

To that end, the one concern for India may be the lack of opportunity that their middle-order have got in these four games. Victories by six wickets, seven wickets, eight wickets and now, presumably, something similarly comprehensive mean that Ravindra Jadeja hasn't yet had a hit, let alone anyone lower down the order. And, with Hardik Pandya's ankle injury presumably set to cause further disruption to their balance, it's a concern that might not, at this rate, get stress-tested until the critical moment.

Still, be grateful for theoretical concerns, eh? England, Australia and South Africa, to name but a few, would be delighted to have such problems!

Fifty and out for Gill!

... much like Tanzid in Bangladesh's innings, India's opener has given it away just a handful of balls after reaching his milestone. And he's gone in a similarly forceful manner too, looking to pound Mehidy Hasan Miraz down the ground. But he drags the stroke rather squarer than intended, Mahmudullah is lurking out in the deep and times his hop to perfection to drag down the chance, keeping his heels inside the rope as he does so. A glimmer ...

Dengue be damned. Gill has shaken off a very nasty fever and anchored this run-chase with an evenly paced half-century. It's his first in World Cups but self-evidently not his last. And with Virat Kohli up and running at a brisk tempo too, Bangladesh are looking short of answers right now.

Hark at that familiar sound of an Indian stadium having the noise sucked out of it. Rohit Sharma was on a post-powerplay rampage, having cuffed a Hasan Mahmud short ball over backward square for six. But one ball later, and eyeing up a 40-ball fifty, he attempts the same stroke and picks out Towhid Hridoy on the rope who runs round to gather well.

It ends a 88-run opening stand, but, after a momentary silence for Rohit, Virat Kohli was greeted with a typically massive ovation and a brace of front-foot no-balls, so it's safe to say that India remain firmly in charge. Kohli duly pounds a brace of free hits for a total of ten runs down the ground, and with Shubman Gill finding his own range with a trio of sumptuous fours to follow his own pair of sixes, the hundred has come up in rapid time.

Bangladesh romped along to 63 for 0 after ten overs... and India have just followed suit, with Shubman Gill's two sixes in three balls off Nasum Ahmed denting his otherwise excellent figures. The main man to date, however, has been Rohit Sharma, who has romped along to 37 not out from 33, and in the process passed 250 runs for the tournament. Seeing as he began with a ten-ball duck against Australia, safe to say he's found his range in the last three innings.

If there was any doubt about India’s confidence in this run-chase, then Rohit Sharma has torched it in an instant. Three overs gone, 26 on the board, and the vast six off a Shoriful long-hop has persuaded Shanto to turn to the left-arm spin of Nasum inside the powerplay. Genius or desperation? We’ll find out soon enough.

India need 257 to make it four from four

At least there's one final lump over the covers for Bangladesh to take with them. Shoriful retreats to leg, and swings gleefully over the off-side for a huge six from the final ball of the innings. But Bumrah's brilliance has underpinned India's excellent bowling display... made all the better by the early loss of Hardik Pandya to an ankle injury. They closed ranks well, and despite a 93-run opening stand between Das and Tanzid, Bangladesh couldn't fully capitalise.

Well... what can you do about that? Consecutive yorkers, the first inside-edged into the pads (and leading to a burnt review), the second... just inexorable. Angled in at pace, bursting past the toes, into the base of the stumps. Mahmudullah farmed the strike as well he might, but to no avail. Few players in the world could have done much with that!

Mahmudullah chops a rare glimmer of width from Bumrah through backward point for four, but broadly speaking, his final four-over burst is proving as pinpoint as ever. So, all eyes are on the over at the other end - Mohammad Siraj has made some key breakthroughs but his execution has been slightly off... and Mahmudullah is primed to strike. He attacks the first ball with a launch high over the covers, then scampers pre-emptively to the off-side next-up, in a bid to smoke him out of his defensive wide line. It works a treat third ball, as Siraj misses his length and gets launched high over mid-on for six, but after losing the strike with two balls to go, Mustafizur can't land any more telling blows. Still, Mahmudullah has the strike with six balls to go...

He had to go in the end... Bangladesh need to chance their arm in these closing overs, and Thakur duly gets thwacked to give their run-rate a timely boost. A brace of boundaries in a 15-run over include a leg-stump half-volley, whipped for four through backward square leg, and a muscular launch for six over deep midwicket as Mahmudullah brings all his experience to bear.

Nasum Ahmed joins the charge with an urgent drive down the ground off Mohammad Siraj's first ball of his ninth over, then rocks back to carve another boundary through the covers. Could 260 be back on the cards? Perhaps not, as Siraj responds by dragging his length back, and Rahul gathers a thin top-edge off a wild swing across the line.

Bumrah's back... and just like that he's prised out the main man. That line remains relentless, and so when Mushfiqur thinks he's spotted a hint of width, he's all too eager to cash in. The ball is a fraction slower, however, dug into the surface, and the resultant cut is a touch cramped. But it still takes some superhuman reactions from Jadeja at backward point to spring the trap, as he leaps to his right and clings on horizontal to the ground. The 200 has just come up, but at six wickets down, and three more Bumrah overs remaining out of seven, 250 is suddenly looking a tall order. The sixth ball of the same over leads to a loud appeal too, as Nasum Ahmed scuffs the turf with his bat as he misses out on a drive.

Thakur gets rid of Hridoy
Towhid Hridoy sweeps behind square•Associated Press

He's been the targetted link in India's already weakened attack, but Shardul Thakur has stood firm since a torrid first over at the hands of Tanzid Hasan, and now he's broken a burgeoning fifth-wicket stand. Towhid Hridoy had struggled for fluency in his 16 from 35 balls, but he and Mushfiqur Rahim had pieced together a 42-run stand across ten overs to set the stage for their final push.

But then, on 16, Hridoy took on a short ball from Thakur but failed to pick the cross-seamer that skidded more urgently into his blade. A spooned top-edge plops to Gill at short midwicket, and into the fray comes another World Cup veteran in Mahmudullah, who might conceivably be the right man for the moment.

Landmark for Mushfiqur

Mushfiqur's runs in World Cup fixtures, across five tournaments and 33 matches

Mushfiqur and Shakib had been inseparable in the all-time World Cup appearances stakes, ever since they first played together in the Windies tournament in 2007. But with Shakib missing his first game with that quad injury, the Mighty Atom is out on his own as Bangladesh's most experienced campaigner. An apt occasion to reach his 1000th run at the tournament then. How far past that milestone can he now get? It might determine his team's hopes in this game.

Das is done, and is that Bangladesh's hopes of a competitive total going with him? An attempt to get forceful against the spin of Jadeja ends in calamity, as he plants the front foot, launches a drive up and over the off-side, and manages only to pick out Shubman Gill, five yards inside the rope. India have claimed 4 for 44 in 13 overs since the opening stand was ended at 93. And, without Shakib Al Hasan's calm head, a huge amount now rests on the new man, Mushfiqur Rahim.

Here comes another wave of Bangladeshi acceleration ... or does it? It's been a nudge-and-nurdle ten overs, with two key wickets slowing their progress too. But with his fifty banked, Litton Das steps up his tempo against the spin of Ravindra Jadeja, with two fours in a row - a blazing drive back through the bowler's followthrough then a supremely placed sweep through square leg.

But, don't get ahead of yourself, because here comes KL Rahul with a sensational leg-side take off Mohammad Siraj. Mehidy Hasan Miraz closed the face on his hip, seeking to steer another boundary through fine leg. But the keeper reacted quickly, flung himself to his left, and plucked a blinder in an outstretched glove. Siraj is turning it on now, with a threat of reverse-swing prompting the crowd to get involved too. Rohit brings in a slip to the new man, Towhid Hridoy.

Fifty for Litton Das
50
from 62 balls, Litton Das' 12th ODI half-century

A nudge off the pads from Kuldeep Yadav, and Litton Das trots through to a very measured half-century. A slower clip than his opening partner Tanzid Hasan, but he's got the chance to go on and truly anchor this Bangladesh innings. And he may need to... there are still jitters at the other end, with Mehidy Hasan Miraz poking a drive in the same over, just out of Kuldeep's reach in his followthrough. No boundaries for seven overs now either, with Bangladesh's innings taking on a slow, quick, slow look.

There is, however, the prospect of another step-up in tempo later in the innings, as India are likely to be a bowler short. After that incident in his opening over, Hardik Pandya has been sent for a scan on his left ankle, which sounds ominous.

Spin is turning the tide for India. First Kuldeep, and now Ravindra Jadeja with the plumb lbw. Shanto chose to go back his probing line from round the wicket, a quick arm, straightening just enough as it shaped across the left-hander's bows. Like Tanzid before him, he's persuaded not to review by Litton Das. And justifiably so. A touch of indecision crept into his shot selection with long-on and -off set back to dissuade him from coming down the pitch. But going back to Jadeja is generally a poor option...

Tanzid is done! Over the wicket from Kuldeep Yadav, a faster flatter flipper bangs into his front pad as he kneels for the sweep. Richard Kettleborough's finger is up almost before the appeal has left the bowler's throat, and rightly Tanzid chooses not to burn a review. That was very adjacent. A fine innings ends... is this start enough for Bangladesh to build on? The stand-in skipper, Najmul Hossain Shanto arrives at No.3.

This looks like a major concern for India. Hardik Pandya is down with an ankle injury, and it looks a potentially nasty one. He'd bowled just three balls of his first over - his initial delivery was a jaffa, bursting past Litton Das's outside edge, but Das responded with two fours in a row, the second of which was drilled straight back past the bowler. Hardik stuck out his right boot in a bid to intercept, but overstretched as he did so, with his left foot twisting awkwardly as his weight came down through his leg.

He is being treated on the outfield, which could be taken as a good sign, but he was visibly hobbling as he tried to walk back to his mark and failed. A big moment in this match, and - for the sake of India's team balance - potentially the tournament.

He tries to get back up and complete his over ... but he's leaving the field! And any initial concern for the bowler is immediately drowned out by the acclaim for his replacement for these last three balls... Virat Kohli will complete the over!

Jasprit Bumrah is a sensationally good bowler. This, you may have noticed, is hardly a revelation. Nevertheless, his line is relentless, his length is unyielding - 81% of his powerplay deliveries have been on a good length in this World Cup - and those imperceptible changes to his wrist position can produce booming inswing and outswing at will.

He's so good, we've hardly had time to gauge whether this pitch is a good one or not for strokeplay - although Litton Das, having taken 14 balls to get his first run off a huge inswinger into his pads, has since picked off two emphatic fours in three balls from Mohammad Siraj to give the sense that there's reward to be had on this surface... if only Bumrah will first take his sweater and go and graze in the outfield for a bit.

He's gone wicketless so far, but the first ball of Bumrah's third over could have been given out, had India noticed that Tanzid's flick across the line at a toe-threatening yorker had brushed his front pad just prior to the bat coming through to clip it out to leg. An India review would have served up three reds on DRS, as the players belatedly noticed when the replay popped up on the big screen.

About his only blemish in four overs is a leg-side wide as he comes round the wicket to the left-handed Tanzid, with the aim no doubt of straightening his outswinger into that front pad. One ball later, he's back outside off inducing a wafty drive. But then, from the seventh ball of the same over, Bumrah bangs in the bouncer, and Tanzid gratefully rocks through his pull, high over fine leg for Bangladesh's first six.

Typically tidy and threatening from Jasprit Bumrah at the outset of this match. Waspish pace, swing across the left-hander, nip and bounce from his unconventional release point. A permanent threat with every ball, as Bangladesh are limited to a single to Tanzid in the first over.

What effect that instant pressure has on Bangladesh, only Tanzid knows. But his very next delivery, from Mohammad Siraj, is an airy drive through the full length that flies just out of reach of short cover and away to the rope. Those are the only scoring strokes in the opening two overs, as India lay down their new-ball marker.

Mohammad Isam on Bangladesh's absentee

A Shakib-sized hole for Bangladesh

"And it's a big one. Wickets, runs, experience and leadership. All goes out of the window. Shakib hasn't recovered in time from the quadricep injury that he sustained on October 13 in Chennai against New Zealand. He pulled the muscle while batting, although he bowled ten overs subsequently so the team management was hopeful that he would recover in time. He hasn't.

"Nasum Ahmed has replaced Shakib but his absence throws out Bangladesh's balance. It will put greater importance on Mushfiqur Rahim's wicket, as he is now likely to bat higher up the order. Already without Tamim Iqbal, Bangladesh's experience drainage gets larger now that Shakib is also not there against India."

Bangladesh win the toss and bat

Shanto wins the toss and chooses to bat, and it appears to be his quad injury that has flared up again. "We have some great memories against India, so hopefully we continue our form. I hope it will be a great match. As a player we love to see the crowd, hopefully that will be supporting the team." Shakib and Taskin are out, Hasan Mahmud and Nasum Ahmed are in

Rohit says he would have bowled first. "In this World Cup, keeping everyone in a good space is the biggest challenge, and you're moving from one place to another. We're enjoying our cricket and want to continue the momentum." Same team confirmed for India.

India: Rohit Sharma (capt), 2 Shubman Gill, 3 Virat Kohli, 4 Shreyas Iyer, 5 KL Rahul (wk), 6 Hardik Pandya, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Shardul Thakur, 9 Jasprit Bumrah, 10 Kuldeep Yadav, 11 Mohammed Siraj

Bangladesh: 1 Tanzid Hasan, 2 Litton Das, 3 Najmul Hossain Shanto (capt), 4 Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 5 Towhid Hridoy, 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Mahmudullah, 8 Nasum Ahmed, 9 Hasan Mahmud, 10 Shoriful Islam, 11 Mustafizur Rahman

No Shakib for Bangladesh!

We've not yet had the toss, and there's already a huge blow for Bangladesh, with Shakib Al Hasan sitting this match out. We'll learn more soon. Najmul Hossain Shanto is getting ready to lead the team in his absence.

That leaves Mushfiqur Rahim as the only veteran of that 2007 World Cup clash. Bangladesh will be lacking the small matter of 7439 ODI runs and 313 wickets. Big loss.

Asia's red-hot rivalry arrives in Pune
ESPNcricinfo Ltd

Welcome to Match #17 of the 2023 World Cup. It's India vs Bangladesh at Pune, and while the hosts go into this contest as clear favourites after their flying start to the tournament, there's nothing quite like this rivalry to raise the temperature at present. Bangladesh have won three of their last four ODIs against India, including at the Asia Cup last month, but incredibly this will be their first ODI against India in India since 1998. If that prospect doesn't offer a bit of extra incentive to the visitors, then nothing will.

The two teams are currently sitting at opposite ends of the World Cup table, but as Afghanistan and the Netherlands have been reminding us in recent days, nothing's set in stone just yet. And, as India will doubtless recall from their epochal clash with Bangladesh at Port-of-Spain in 2007, if you lose your focus in this competition, things can go south very quickly.
