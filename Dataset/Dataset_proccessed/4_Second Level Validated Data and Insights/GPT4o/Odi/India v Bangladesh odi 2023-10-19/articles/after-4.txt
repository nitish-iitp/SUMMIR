Never mind the cricket, has anyone watched the Frasier reboot? As someone who adored the show, will it make me sad or happy?

16.09 CEST

17th over: India 122-1 (Gill 47, Kohli 25) Nasum is milked for seven runs: 111211. India are in total control, and that’s drinks.

19 Oct 2023
16.06 CEST

16th over: India 115-1 (Gill 44, Kohli 21) Another good over from Mustafizur. The scoreboard doesn’t suggest as much but Bangladesh have bowled pretty well. Trouble is the pitch is an absolute belter and they are playing the best team in the world.

16.01 CEST

15th over: India 111-1 (Gill 41, Kohli 20) House of Pain’s Jump Around blares out of the tannoy between overs. I wonder what percentage of the crowd thought of Gary Anderson when it came on.

Most are thinking of Virat Kohli. They were chanting his name even when Rohit and Gill were plundering boundaries, and now they are euphorically watching the real thing. A bad misfield at long on gives Kohli a boundary off the first ball from Nasum Ahmed, who has retuned to the attack. Apparently Kohli’s record v left-arm spin isn’t great, hence the bowling change. Liam Dawson must have a good chance of coming into the side when England pl-oh.

19 Oct 2023
15.58 CEST

14th over: India 106-1 (Gill 41, Kohli 15) A quiet over from Mustafizur; three singles from it. India’s required run-rate is an eminently reasonable 4.19.

“When you mentioned Tom Petty,” says John Starbuck, “was this what you meant?”

Sure was. If there’s one area in which we are clear market leaderes, it’s topical references.

15.54 CEST

13th over: India 103-1 (Gill 40, Kohli 13) Hasan tries a first-ball yorker to Kohli. It’s slightly too straight and Kohli clips it for two. It’s also a no-ball, which means a free hit. Kohli crashes that through mid-on for four – and it’s another no-ball. Oh, kid.

Kohli launches the second free hit down the ground for six, which takes him to 12 from three balls. Jack Russell eat your heart out.

What a strange over – in many ways it was a triumph for Hasan, yet he disappeared for 23.

WICKET! India 88-1 (Rohit c Hridoy b Mahmud 48)

Rohit Sharma has been bounced out by Hasan Mahmud! It’s a marvellous moment for a young bowler who has been so impressive on his World Cup debut. Rohit hooked the previous ball for a big, statement six, but Hasan was brave enough to go again and Rohit pulled the ball down deep square leg’s throat.

He played imperiously again, hitting seven fours and two sixes in a 40-ball 48. But Hasan won the battle, and not many young bowlers do that against Rohit in white-ball cricket. Any cricket.

12th over: India 80-0 (Rohit 41, Gill 39) Of all the players who have batted together at least ten times in ODIs, Rohit and Gill have the second highest average (81.50). The highest is - you betcha - Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul with 83.00. Here’s the full list.

Mustafizur replaces Nasum, and Gill flashes his second ball to the left of backward point for four. That might have gone to hand, though it would still have taken some catching.

It's turning into an orgy of boundaries in Pune. Gill times successive fours through midwicket and extra cover, both exquisite shots.

Eighty-three per cent of India’s runs in this innings have been in boundaries: 12x4, 3x6.

15.42 CEST

11th over: India 68-0 (Rohit 41, Gill 27) Rohit shapes to hook Mahmud then aborts the shot, realising the ball is a bit too quick and a bit too close. The bowling coach Allan Donald applauds on the boundary. This is pretty impressive stuff from Hasan, a 24-year-old playing his first World Cup game.

Rohit is a Tom Petty fan, though, and he makes his point by pulling for four later in the over. It wasn’t his smoothest cross-bat stroke, mind, and I reckon his internal monologue is full of respect for Hasan right now.

15.37 CEST

10th over: India 63-0 (Rohit 37, Gill 26) There goes Shubman Gill, skipping down the track to muscle Nasum over long on for six. He does it again two balls later, this time clattering it straight back over the bowler’s head. He didn’t even middle it but it was still went the distance.

15.35 CEST

9th over: India 50-0 (Rohit 37, Gill 13) There was a soupcon of swing for the two left-armers with the new ball. Now? Nuttin. Hasan Mahmud has started accurately, and he has a nice upright action that evokes somebody whose name I’ll remember any second now, but there’s no assistance at all. Two runs from the over, the second of which brings up the fifty partnership.

15.30 CEST

8th over: India 48-0 (Rohit 36, Gill 12) As John Starbuck said, the first ball of an over is where the cool kids hang out. Rohit sweeps this one from Nasum for four, the third time it his happened in this innings.

Nasum is bowling pretty well, particularly for a finger spinner in a Powerplay, but the match is being played on Rohit’s terms. That boundary makes him the leading runscorer in this fledgling tournament with 253.

15.27 CEST

7th over: India 41-0 (Rohit 31, Gill 12) The right-armer Hasun Mahmud replaces Shoriful, who was bullied by Rohit in an opening spell of 3-0-25-0. Gill charges his second ball and edges it high over the imaginary cordon for four. That’s the only boundary from an accurate first over.

India need 214 from 43 overs. They’re cruising.

15.23 CEST

6th over: India 37-0 (Rohit 31, Gill 6) This is getting silly. Rohit rocks back to slap Nasum past point for four more. And then he defends the next five balls, because he can. (And because Nasum has started very accurately.)

“It may be as well, throughout this tournament, to keep an eye on the first ball of each over in particular, as there seems to be a bias towards a wicket or boundary in many of them,” says John Starbuck. “Statistically significant? Who can say...”

19 Oct 2023
15.20 CEST

5th over: India 33-0 (Rohit 27, Gill 6) Rohit is in unreal form just now. He drives a length delivery from Shoriful over mid-off for four more, then tucks a single to move to 27 from 18 balls. His strike rate in this competition is 143; oh and he’s averaging 81.

15.15 CEST

4th over: India 28-0 (Rohit 22, Gill 6) An early bowling change for Bangladesh. The left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed, who has replaced the injured Shakib Al Hasan in the team, comes on for Mustafizur.

His second ball skids on nicely to hit Gill on the pad, though it was missing leg stump. It’s a good start though, just two from the over.

15.11 CEST

3rd over: India 26-0 (Rohit 21, Gill 5) This is a poor start from Shoriful. He drops short twice in three balls to Rohit, who cuts for four and pulls for six. Rohit is off to another flyer, 21 from 13 balls.

19 Oct 2023
15.06 CEST

2nd over: India 14-0 (Rohit 9, Gill 5) Another left-armer, Mustafizur Rahman, shares the new ball. His first ball curves into Shubman Gill, who times it beautifully through midwicket for four. The rest of the over is played respectfully.

1st over: India 8-0 (Rohit 8, Gill 0) Rohit Sharma’s last two innings have produced 217 runs off 147 deliveries, and apparently this is normal behaviour nowadays. He needs only two balls to find the boundary today, skimming a wide delivery from Shoriful through the covers; then he slaps another past the diving backward point. It was in the air but Inspector Gadget would have struggled to catch that.

An eventful first over concludes with a jaffa from Shoriful that beats Rohit on the inside as he tries to whip to leg. There is a bit of swing, and new-ball wickets are Bangladesh’s only hope.

Ready? The players are, most notably Rohit Sharma and Shoriful Islam. There’s no Taskin Ahmed tonight, which is a blow to those who flagged him as Bangladesh’s player to watch.

One out of two will do. Thanks Tom, hello everyone. Being a weirdo, I decided to look at when the first Spandex-tight finish occurred in all the other men’s ODI World Cups. In some it happened right at the start (in 1987 the first four games were all last-over thrillers, and even the fifth was a penultimate-over nipper, so could someone please send a DeLorean to Guardian Towers at their earliest convenience). In others (1979, 1983, 2011, 2015) it took more than 10 games for derrieres to squeak to the fullest. The slowest start to the competition was probably in 1983, when New Zealand beat England by two wickets in the 13th match of the competition.

This is the 17th match of the 2023 World Cup, and it’s not going to be close*. Right now India look a match for a Rest of the World XI, never mind an ailing, ageing Bangladesh. Hopefully the competition is saving all the thrillers for the business end.

Anyway, while Sky replays the most significant one-day cricket match of the 21st century, I’m going to hand you over to Rob Smyth, who comes armed with tremendous stats and a ready wit, to talk you through India’s probably routine run chase. But you never know. Thanks for your company and emails.

India need 257 to win

Bangladesh will be pleased to get over the 250 mark but it’s unlikely to be enough on a true surface that a side as good as India should be able to overhaul. Rohit Sharma’s side were again sharp and focused with the ball and in the field once their spinners had ended a fine opening Bangladesh partnership, even though the loss of Pandya is a blow. Najmul Hossain Shanto’s side needed more from their middle order though and with Miraz and Shanto plus the openers falling in relatively quick succession, Bangladesh struggled to cut loose again, though Mahmudullah did his best.

“Wicket looks very good, no turn, we just need to play simple cricket,” is Ravindra Jadeja’s snap verdict on coming off the field. And I’m sure they will.

50th over: Bangladesh 256-8 (Mustafizur 1, Shoriful 7). An eventful, skillful, fun denouement to the innings Bumrah begins the final over with an un-hittable inswinging yorker, which Rohit reviews for lbw – his first of the innings I think – but the replays show a clear inside edge. The second is even more unplayable, and Mahmudullah’s stumps are all messed up, ending a very useful knock. A tennis-smash of a shot from Mustafizur gets Bangladesh to 250 off a short ball. Good, improv-cricket all round really. But not as good as Shoriful’s last shot of the innings – an extraordinary, bold SIX over extra cover. India need 257 to win

Brilliant. Just brilliant, from a master of his art. Bumrah castles Mahmudullah with a spearing yorker.

49th over: Bangladesh 248-7 ( Mahmudullah 47, Mustafizur 0). Mahmudullah inflicts some damage onSiraj’s final figures in a muc-needed productive Bangladesh over. Siraj is inelegantly hoisted towards long-off for two by Mahmudullah, not quite finding his timing on this occasion before a decent sprawling stop from the bowler cuts off the batter’s attempted across-the-line swipe. He finds his timing alright next ball though – it’s hammered over wide long-on for a wonderful SIX. Suitably hit off course, Siraj sends down a howling wide outside off. A low attempted yorker is steered wide on the off for one. Mustafizur declines a single off the last ball of the over, granting Mahmudullah the strike for the last over.

48th over: Bangladesh 238-7 ( Mahmudullah 37, Mustafizur 0). As expected, Bumrah changes ends and dangles a slower ball outside Mahmudullah’s off-stump. He misses. He doesn’t miss the next one though, carving it artfully back of square on the offside for four. He’s played well here, showing his class and experience. Then he digs out a yorker and scurries through for a single. Five off a Bumrah over full of characteristic variety and challenge feels like an accomplishment of sorts, even at this stage.

14.11 CEST

47th over: Bangladesh 233-7 ( Mahmudullah 32, Mustafizur 0). Nasum shows his potential with an utterly glorious straight drive for four off Siraj, who curiously replaces Bumrah at that end (perhaps they’ll bring him on from the other one). The No 8 is trying to go big now, slogging and getting nowhere near a short ball on a good line. A clearer, cleaner shot – a smack through extra cover – pierces the gaps for four more. But then he goes, caught behind, ending a cameo that ideally needed to last an over or two more.
