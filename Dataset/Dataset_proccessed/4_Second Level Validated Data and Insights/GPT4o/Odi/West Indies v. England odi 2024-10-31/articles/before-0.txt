West Indies have announced their squad for the upcoming three-match ODI series against England. Shimron Hetmyer returns to the national team, who played his last ODI in December 2023. Hetmyer has been included in the team in place of Alick Athanje.

Let us tell you that the first ODI between West Indies and England will be played in Antigua on Thursday. The Caribbean team made only one change compared to the team sent on the Sri Lanka tour and included Hetmyer in place of Alick Athanje. It is known that Hetmyer did not participate in the Sri Lanka tour due to personal reasons.

Shimron Hetmyer recently performed well in the Caribbean Premier League, where he was the fifth top-run scorer. Hetmyer’s return will strengthen the batting order of the Caribbean team, which will face a tough challenge from England. By the way, the Caribbean team defeated England 2-1 in the series last year and will try to repeat the same performance.
