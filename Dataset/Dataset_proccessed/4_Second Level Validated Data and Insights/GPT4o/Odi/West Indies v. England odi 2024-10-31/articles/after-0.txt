Liam Livingstone’s reaction

I guess we need to get the rhythm of 50-over cricket as quickly as possible. We know that somebody in the top six has to go on and unfortunately we couldn’t do that today.

I don’t think we adapted that well. West Indies bowled really well and we lost wickets at key stages. Disappointing day but we’ll come back on Sunday, Saturday, whenever it is!

I think everybody saw what JT [John Turner] is about. I thought he bowled really well and was unlucky not to get a wicket which might have changed the game. Hopefully more of the same for the rest of the series.

West Indies win by eight wickets with 55 balls to spare

25.5 overs: West Indies 159-2 (Carty 19, Hope 6) Hope turns Livingstone for two to complete a thumping victory for West Indies. They bowled cleverly to restrict England to an under-par 209; then, either side of a rain delay, Evin Lewis hit a coruscating 94 to take them to the cusp of victory.

1 Nov 2024
21.47 EDT

25th over: West Indies 153-2 (Carty 18, Hope 3) Carty blooters Rashid over mid-off for four to move West Indies within a boundary of victory. It’s been a hammering.

Share
1 Nov 2024
21.44 EDT

24th over: West Indies 148-2 (Carty 14, Hope 2) Hope is dropped at extra cover by Rashid, a fairly simple chance off the bowling of Livingstone. Maybe he lost the flight of the ball because he barely got a hand on it.

WICKET! West Indies 144-2 (Lewis c Bethell b Rashid 94)

Evin Lewis dies by the sword. He tried to reach a century with his ninth six, didn’t quite get hold of the shot and was well caught at long off by Bethell.

Earlier in the over he’d pulled Rashid over midwicket for another six, then survived a desperate LBW review from a ball that pitched outside leg. No century but Lewis has won the game for his team with a truly brilliant innings: 94 from 69 balls with eight sixes.

21.35 EDT

22nd over: West Indies 138-1 (Lewis 88, Carty 12) Lewis moves closer to three figures by dragging a sweep very fine for four. None of the England players were able to score at a strike rate of over 100; Lewis is going at 133.

Share
1 Nov 2024
21.32 EDT

21st over: West Indies 129-1 (Lewis 82, Carty 9) Rashid returns and concedes a couple from his fifth over. West Indies need 28, Lewis needs 18 for back-to-back ODI hundreds.

1 Nov 2024
21.29 EDT

20th over: West Indies 127-1 (Lewis 81, Carty 8) The new batter Keacy Carty makes his intentions clear by sweeping Livingstone for three and spanking a one-bounce four down the ground. West Indies need 30 to win.

1 Nov 2024
21.26 EDT
WICKET! West Indies 118-1 (King c Jacks b Livingstone 30)

King’s luck finally runs out when he hoicks Livingstone straight to Jacks at deep midwicket. Like everyone in this game apart from Lewis and Livingstone, he really struggled to time the ball on a two-paced pitch.

Share
1 Nov 2024
21.24 EDT

19th over: West Indies 118-0 (King 30, Lewis 80) Jacob Bethell comes on for Adil Rashid, who has somehow ended up with figures of 4-0-35-0, and is monstered over long-off for Lewis. That’s his seventh sixth.

For various reasons this is only Lewis’s second ODI since 2021; in the other, against Sri Lanka earlier in the week, he walloped 102 off 61 balls.

21.19 EDT

18th over: West Indies 106-0 (King 27, Lewis 69) There’s no doubt West Indies won a good toss; there’s also no doubt they have completely outplayed England, who have a bit to think about before the second game on this ground on Saturday.

1 Nov 2024
21.18 EDT

17th over: West Indies 104-0 (King 27, Lewis 69) King, who has ridden his luck like Willie Shoemaker in this innings, edges Rashid past slip at catchable height for three more.

The rotation of strike works out just fine for West Indies. Lewis to pull Rashid for two boundaries in three balls before dumping a full toss over midwicket for six! In the context of a low-scoring game, this is some performance: 69 not out from 54 balls with three fours and six sixes.

21.14 EDT

16th over: West Indies 87-0 (King 24, Lewis 55) Evin Lewis clatters Livingstone’s final delivery wide of the man at long-off. He has played brilliantly on a pitch that has confounded everyone else.

REVIEW! West Indies 82-0 (King not out 23)

Brandon King successfully reviews after being given out LBW to Liam Livingstone. He missed a pull at a ball that skidded on to hit him in front, but it pitched just outside leg so King survives.

Rain stops play

Maybe England will dodge defeat after all. The rain has returned in Antigua and, though there is plenty of time to spare, West Indies need to bat 20 overs for DLS to come into play.

20.03 EDT

15th over: West Indies 81-0 (King 23, Lewis 51) England are facing a hammering here but they’ve bowled pretty well and had no luck. King edges Rashid past slip at catchable height, then survives an LBW review after failing to pick the googly. He was saved by the ball hitting him just outside the line of off stump.

Share
31 Oct 2024
19.58 EDT

14th over: West Indies 77-0 (King 20, Lewis 50) A terrific yorker from Curran is dug out well by Lewis, who was almost knocked off his feet. He works the next delivery off middle stump to fine leg for his first four, then takes a quick single to reach a punishing 46-ball fifty. It’s been a cracking innings.

Share
31 Oct 2024
19.54 EDT

13th over: West Indies 71-0 (King 19, Lewis 45) The required rate is below four, which means West Indies can sit on the dangerous Rashid.

Or they could hit him for a one-handed six, as Lewis has just done. He didn’t get hold of it properly but it had just enough to clear the rope at cow corner. That’s Lewis’s fifth boundary, all of them sixes.

31 Oct 2024
19.50 EDT

12th over: West Indies 61-0 (King 18, Lewis 37) Sam Curran replaces John Turner, starts with three dot balls to Lewis and then sees his fourth smashed over midwicket for a huge six. Lewis has is dealing exclusively in sixes and singles right now.

Share
31 Oct 2024
19.45 EDT

11th over: West Indies 54-0 (King 18, Lewis 30) Adil Rashid usually comes on straight after the Powerplay and today is no exception. King’s charmed innings continues when a leading edge somehow loops over the head of extra cover. While he continues to ride his luck, Lewis looks in control and calmly drives singles off the three deliveries he faces.

10th over: West Indies 49-0 (King 16, Lewis 27) After bowling a couple of wides to Lewis, Turner beats King outside off stump yet again. Just one run off the bat in that over. Turner has bowled much better than figures of 5-0-26-0 would suggest.

19.37 EDT

9th over: West Indies 46-0 (King 16, Lewis 26) England need to take wickets so Archer is given a fifth over. File under ‘one too many’: Lewis drives handsomely over mid-on for his third six before King rifles an even better drive between extra cover and mid-off for four. Thirteen from the over; this game is probably done.

31 Oct 2024
19.32 EDT

8th over: West Indies 33-0 (King 12, Lewis 17) Lewis hasn’t middled many tonight, but when he does he’s deadly. An outswinger from Turner, starting on leg stump, is picked up spectacularly over midwicket for six. That’s a ridiculous shot.

Lewis has form for administering this kind of punishment: he smashed 176 not out, with seven sixes, against England at the Oval in 2017.

Turner recovers pretty well and ends the over by beating King for the umpteenth time.

19.27 EDT

7th over: West Indies 24-0 (King 11, Lewis 11) The left-handed Lewis is beaten by a stunning delivery from Archer that swings past the outside edge and just misses off stump. England have bowled beautifully so far, Archer in particular, and it’s a travesty they haven’t taken at least one wicket. Another maiden from Archer, whose figures are 4-2-8-0.

“As usual, I’m flummoxed by ODI field settings,” says Gary Naylor. “Captains seem to post the same fields regardless of the target set. England need 10 wickets to win this match and the first few overs is the likeliest time, so three slips, catching midwicket and a short leg? No. Just the bog standard one slip, two out and the rest in the ring. Ben Stokes does more with a field in five overs than an ODI captain does in 50.”

6th over: West Indies 24-0 (King 11, Lewis 11) Turner beats King with four successive deliveries, the second of which was a snorter that burst from a length. Early days but you can see why England are so interested in him. The bounce he gets is particularly exciting.

5th over: West Indies 22-0 (King 10, Lewis 10) Archer’s having no luck against King, who has inside-edged as many deliveries as he has middle. The frustration continues when King puts a rare bad ball away for four before Lewis is beaten by a wide yorker.

Share
31 Oct 2024
19.16 EDT

4th over: West Indies 17-0 (King 6, Lewis 10) Turner’s run-up reminds me a little of Glenn McGrath, though his action is more chest-on. A previously excellent second over is ruined when Lewis swivel-pulls the last delivery round the corner for six.

England need wickets plural.

31 Oct 2024
19.12 EDT

3rd over: West Indies 9-0 (King 6, Lewis 2) King gets a thick inside-edge to another textbook inswinger from Archer, who is bowling stump to stump, just full of a good length. A maiden.

“I love your optimism that this will still be a 50-over game rather than the Windies beating our T20 team in less than 20 overs in what should be an ODI...” writes Tom Van der Gucht. “Then again, Turner will be an unknown quantity an me could catch them cold and Archer and Rashid are still Archer and Rashid.”

I’m just dealing in facts; you can’t get cancelled for facts. I do think West Indies will win but I’m not sure they’ll romp to victory unless the ball starts to skid on under the lights.

2nd over: West Indies 9-0 (King 6, Lewis 2) The mysterious John Turner, finally making his England debut almost a year after he was first included in a white-ball squad, will share the new ball. He starts with a terrific lifter that hits a slightly startled King on the arm.

That sets the tone for a superb first over in which King edges at catchable height for four and also inside-edges a single on the leg side.

Share
31 Oct 2024
19.04 EDT

1st over: West Indies 4-0 (King 1, Lewis 2) Archer’s second ball is a beautiful inswinger that Brandon King inside-edges past leg stump for a single. That was very similar to the ball with which he dismissed Aaron Finch for a golden duck in the 2019 semi-final.

England need early wickets and will be encouraged by the swing that Archer is getting. Later in the over he tries a short ball that is cuffed for a couple by Evin Lewis. The outfield is painfully slow.

“USA are currently 242 for 8 after 43 overs, chasing 318 to beat Scotland in the Cricket World Cup League 2 series in Grand Prairie,” writes Simon McMahon. “Brandon ‘Baz’ McMullen made 151 for Scotland, his third ODI hundred and the fifth highest score for Scotland in ODIs.”

It became pretty obvious during the T20 World Cup, particularly in the Australia game, that he is a seriously good player.

Weather update: it’s still raining

It doesn’t look as heavy as it was half an hour ago, although the view from Whitstable isn’t the best so I might be wrong. What we can say with certainty is that there will be no play for the forseeable; even if it stops raining, the clean-up operation will take a while.

The rain should help the ball skid on when West Indies bat, which will make it even tougher for England to defend 209. You may wish to consider alternative entertainment; if you’re in the UK, Murder on the Doorstep is on Channel 5 at 10pm.

Thanks Tim, hello everyone. England’s total feels below-par, even on such a sluggish pitch, and you’d expect West Indies to get the job done. On the plus side – because there’s always a plus side – we’re finally going to see John Turner bowl for England. He averages less than 20 with the ball in all three forms, and if that statistic doesn’t get you excited I’m afraid you’re dead inside.

England kept half-getting going, then being pegged back. All their top six got to 15, and not one of them reached 50. Jacob Bethell and Jordan Cox offered a glimpse of star quality but only managed a pair of cameos. Liam Livingstone and Sam Curran showed their grit and nous by adding 68. But the innings belonged to West Indies – to Shai Hope for his astute captaincy, to Jayden Seales for his Curtly Ambrose impression, and above all to Gudakesh Motie for grabbing a four-for, including both the scalps that really mattered.

That’s my cue to go and see what’s in the fridge. Thanks for your company and correspondence, which made up in quality what it perhaps lacked in volume. Do stick around to see what West Indies can make of this target, and what Rob Smyth makes of them.
