        "Liam Livingstone\u2019s reaction: I guess we need to get the rhythm of 50-over cricket as quickly as possible. We know that somebody in the top six has to go on and unfortunately we couldn\u2019t do that today.",
        "I don\u2019t think we adapted that well. West Indies bowled really well and we lost wickets at key stages. Disappointing day but we\u2019ll come back on Sunday, Saturday, whenever it is!",
        "I think everybody saw what JT [John Turner] is about. I thought he bowled really well and was unlucky not to get a wicket which might have changed the game. Hopefully more of the same for the rest of the series."
