        "We are just a few hours away from the commencement of the much-anticipated West Indies vs England ODI series. This three-match rubber will begin at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on October 31 (11:30 pm IST).",
        "England will see this series as a much-needed preparation for next year's ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan. They are currently on a bad streak, having lost a five-match ODI series to arch-rivals Australia followed by a 2-1 Test series loss to Pakistan.",
        "Similarly, the West Indies also had a forgettable white-ball tour to Sri Lanka, where they lost both the T20I and ODI series."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Antigua pitch will have a good pace and bounce initially, which might help the team batting first. As the match progresses, expect the spinners to come into the game more, with the average second-inning score here being less.",
        "England, coincidentally, have a great record at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, having won five of the seven games played. They even smashed a whopping 325 runs at the venue in their last ODI bilateral series before the hosts chased it down on the back of Shai Hope's hundred.",
        "The last time ODI cricket was played at this venue was also during a three-match series between the West Indies and England. It was in December last year that England kept the series alive with a win by six wickets."
