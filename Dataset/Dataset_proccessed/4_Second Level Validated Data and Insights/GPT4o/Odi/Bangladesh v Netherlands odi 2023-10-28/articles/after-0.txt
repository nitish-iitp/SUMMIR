Netherlands vs Bangladesh Highlights, World Cup 2023: Netherlands defeated Bangladesh by 87 runs as they dismissed all the Bangladeshi players in just 142 runs, with 7.3 balls remaining at the Eden Gardens on 28 October, in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023 tournament.

Apart from Mehidy Hasan Miraz (35), Mahmudullah (20) and Mustafizur Rahman (20) no batter could stand for long ahead of the Dutch bowlers. While for Netherlands, Paul van Meekeren took 4 wickets, Bas de Leede picked 2 wickets, while Colin Ackermann, Logan van Beek and Aryan Dutt clinched one wicket each.

Earlier, Netherlands while batting first at the Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata after Scott Edwards won an important toss, scored 229 runs, as they lost all their wickets to Bangladeshi bowlers. 

For Netherlands, skipper Scott Edwards (68) and Wesley Barresi (41) scored the most. While for Bangladesh, Shoriful Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman and Mahedi Hasan took two wickets each. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan picked one. 

Both the Netherlands and Bangladesh have followed similar trajectories in the tournament, with just one win from their five matches. Netherlands have not been able to maintain their momentum after their famous victory over South Africa in their third match of the tournament. Similarly, Bangladesh have failed to win a single game in the tournament after handing Afghanistan a crushing defeat in their opening match.

Bangladesh, who have been without the services of captain Shakib al Hasan for most of the tournament, will be looking to settle their playing XI as they work to improve in both departments. Bangladesh's deficiencies were exposed in their last match against South Africa, when the Proteas posted 382 runs in their 50 overs and dismissed the Bangladesh batsmen for a meagre score of 233.

The Netherlands, meanwhile, will be looking to bounce back from a crushing defeat to five-time world champions Australia in their last outing. The Australian batsmen put the Dutch bowlers to the sword, scoring 399 runs in their 50 overs. Meanwhile, the Dutch batting will also be lacking in confidence after being bowled out for 90 runs in just 21 overs.

Bangladesh and Netherlands Playing XI:

Vikramjit Singh, Max O'Dowd, Wesley Barresi, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards(c/w), Bas de Leede, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Logan van Beek, Shariz Ahmad, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren

3) Colin Ackermann and Wesley Barresi stitch together a good little partnership taking the Dutch side over the 50 run mark. 

4) The wickets of Ackermann and Baressi by Mustafizur and Shakib in quick succession put the Netherlands in a tough spot once again.
