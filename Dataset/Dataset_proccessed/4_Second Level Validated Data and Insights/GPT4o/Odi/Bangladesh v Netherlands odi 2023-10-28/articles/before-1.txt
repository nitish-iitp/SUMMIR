PREVIEW
Bangladesh wary of Netherlands threat as World Cup comes to Kolkata

Big Picture: World Cup 2023 comes to Kolkata

The World Cup has arrived in Kolkata, where Bangladesh can expect a fair bit of support at Eden Gardens when they take on Netherlands. There are supposed to be at least 2000 fans on their way from Dhaka and other parts of Bangladesh for this match, with the cultural connection with Kolkata and good travel options between the two making it a popular destination for Bangladeshis.

Bangladesh come to Kolkata following a 149-run defeat against South Africa in Mumbai. Mahmudullah's hundred apart, there wasn't much to cheer about in that game. The bowling especially was all over the place during the final ten overs, when South Africa smashed 144 runs. And before Mahmudullah built partnerships with the tail, and attacked the loose deliveries, Bangladesh had slipped to 81 for 6. While Mahmudullah's innings was encouraging, these were miniscule gains for a team that is currently placed eighth after five games but still harbours hopes of making it to the semi-final of the World Cup.

Moreover, Netherlands' inspiring performances issue a warning. Although they might be smarting from their 309-run defeat against Australia, Netherlands are not roadkill. They have punched well above their weight in the tournament by stunning South Africa, and running Sri Lanka close.

Scott Edwards, leading from the front in this World Cup, captains a side which also fought their way into this World Cup with a superb showing in the Qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June-July. They had shown then too that the Full-Member tag was no deterrent for them. Bangladesh, beware.

In the spotlight: Mahmudullah and Logan van Beek

Bangladesh's selectors and team management seemed to have moved on from Mahmudullah this March. But he was brought back for the ODI series against New Zealand just before the World Cup. Since then, he averages 67 in five innings. However, three of those innings have come at No. 6 - and one each at Nos. 7 and 8 - something which the team might have to reconsider in light of Bangladesh's under-performing middle order.

Although Logan van Beek was taken for 74 across his ten overs against Australia, he did pick up four wickets. His economy rate in this World Cup has been pretty high at 6.34, but van Beek has eight wickets at 27.62. Three of those wickets had come in Netherlands' upset of South Africa. Van Beek also contributed 59 against Sri Lanka, adding 130 with Sybrand Engelbrecht after Netherlands were 91 for 6. If he can continue with that touch, Netherlands will be well served.

Team news: Taskin fit for Bangladesh

Taskin Ahmed, who was sidelined by a shoulder niggle, bowled at full tilt two days before the match, so expect him to be back. Towhid Hridoy could also return to the side after Bangladesh's experiment of playing six bowlers didn't work out against South Africa.

Bangladesh (probable): 1 Tanzid Hasan, 2 Litton Das, 3 Najmul Hossain Shanto, 4 Shakib Al Hasan (capt), 5 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 6 Mahmudullah, 7 Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 8 Nasum Ahmed/Towhid Hridoy, 9 Taskin Ahmed, 10 Shoriful Islam, 11 Mustafizur Rahman

Netherlands need runs from opening batter Max O'Dowd - he has a highest score of only 18 in five innings this World Cup - but they are likely to continue to back him. Expect them to go in unchanged.

Netherlands (probable): 1 Vikramjit Singh, 2 Max O'Dowd, 3 Colin Ackermann, 4 Sybrand Engelbrecht, 5 Bas de Leede, 6 Scott Edwards (capt & wk), 7 Teja Nidamanuru, 8 Logan van Beek, 9 Roelof van der Merwe, 10 Aryan Dutt, 11 Paul van Meekeren

Pitch and conditions: Probable run fest awaits

Eden Gardens has hosted just a single ODI in the last six years. And though the pitches there historically tend to be batting-friendly, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 215 by India in that ODI this January. However, there have been high totals there at the IPL.

As for the weather in Kolkata, it is expected to be hot and humid, with winter setting in only towards the middle or end of November.

Stats and trivia

Bangladesh and Netherlands have met in an ODI only twice so far. The last of those meetings had come during the 2011 World Cup. From that game, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah and Wesley Barresi are still part of the respective teams' squads in 2023.

All of Mahmudullah's ODI centuries have come in ICC tournaments: three in the World Cup, and one in the Champions Trophy.

Bas de Leede's figures of 2 for 115 in ten overs against Australia is now the most expensive ten-over spell in ODIs, relieving Mick Lewis of this unwanted record after 17 years.

Quotes

"[Our World Cup] is not finished yet. [There are] still four more games to go. If we can win those, anything can happen because there are some [net] run rate issues... So if we can win four, there will be a different story, maybe. But at the moment we are planning to go match by match."
