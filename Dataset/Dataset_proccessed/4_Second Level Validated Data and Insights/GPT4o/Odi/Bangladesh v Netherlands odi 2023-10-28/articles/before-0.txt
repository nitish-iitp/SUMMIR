Match Preview:

To conclude another entertaining double-header, the Netherlands and Bangladesh will battle it out at the iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Entering this fixture, both teams suffered massive defeats. The Dutch were on the receiving end of a 309-run loss against Australia. While the Bangla Tigers were defeated by South Africa with a 149-run margin in Mumbai.

Pitch Report:


The Eden Gardens in Kolkata is known to produce great batting tracks with an average score of 256. The ground’s short dimensions and a true bounce off the track allow batters to score a lot of runs. At the same time, fast bowlers, with a new ball, can generate some swing in the second innings while spinners can also come into play as the wicket slows down and starts gripping.

Team Analysis:

Netherlands:

After a few positive performances, the Netherlands suffered one of the worst defeats in ODI history against Australia. The Dutch team has functioned as a unit but their batting has been a massive letdown. The likes of Vikramjit Singh, Max O’Dowd and Teja Nidamanuru, have failed to score a lot of runs. On the other hand, the Netherlands’ bowling has looked decent, barring the previous match.

Team News:


No players have been reported to be injured from the Netherlands.

SportsTiger Playing XI of Netherlands: 

Vikramjit Singh, Max O’Dowd, Colin Ackermann, Bas de Leede, Teja Nidamanuru, Scott Edwards (c)/(wk), Sybrand Engelbrecht, Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren

Bangladesh:

Like the Dutch, Bangladesh also has a similar record of one win out of five games and would want to get back to winning ways in Kolkata. The Bangladeshi batting has struggled to score runs as batters have failed to stitch up partnerships throughout the World Cup. Similarly, their bowling has had a few good performances but lacked consistency.

Team News:

Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan has travelled back to Bangladesh in order to train with his mentor.

SportsTiger Playing XI of Bangladesh: 

Litton Das, Tanzid Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Shakib Al Hasan (c), Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud

Match Prediction:

 


Conclusion:


Bangladesh has a better chance to win this fixture and defeat the Netherlands to register their second win in the ICC ODI World Cup 2023 .
