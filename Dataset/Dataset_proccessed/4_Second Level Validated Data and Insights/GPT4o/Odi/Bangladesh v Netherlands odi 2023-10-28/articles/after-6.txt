The Netherlands climbed off the bottom of the Cricket World Cup table, and moved ahead of England, with an 87-run win over Bangladesh on Saturday after Scott Edwards hit a feisty half-century and the Dutch bowler Paul van Meekeren ripped through the Asian side with a fiery spell.

Chasing 230 to win, Bangladesh collapsed to 70 for six inside 18 overs, with Van Meekeren (four for 23) mowing down the middle order and Bas de Leede getting the key dismissal of Mehidy Hasan Miraz for 35, before the Tigers eventually folded for 142 in 42.2 overs.

The Dutch seamers varied their pace and extracted bounce from a slow wicket at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens to turn up the heat on Bangladesh, with De Leede (two for 25) getting rid of Mohammad Mahmudullah (20) to put them firmly on course for a famous win.

Earlier, Edwards rode his luck to score a stroke-filled 68 that resuscitated the Netherlands innings after a shaky start, and Sybrand Engelbrecht chipped in with 35 as they finished on 229 thanks to late hitting by Logan van Beek (23no). Shoriful Islam (two for 51) and Mahedi Hasan (two for 40) cleaned up the tail, but Bangladesh were left to rue the fact that they allowed the Dutch lower order to accumulate 74 runs in the final 10 overs to establish a respectable total.

The Netherlands lost both of their openers in the first 14 balls after captain Edwards won the toss and chose to bat, but Wesley Barresi repaired the damage with a breezy 41 that included eight fours before Mustafizur Rahman (two for 36) enticed him into a poor shot. Colin Ackermann (15) did not last much longer and the Dutch should have been in deeper trouble but for some sloppy catching by Bangladesh as Edwards was dropped twice in the 16th over while on zero.

Taskin Ahmed (two for 43) then had De Leede caught behind for 17 to leave Netherlands teetering at 107 for five, but Edwards soldiered on with Engelbrecht to score his second fifty of the tournament and 15th overall before Mustafizur snared him with a wide yorker.

“I was speaking to a couple of guys and we were saying that if we could get 220 plus, we would be in the game … it was nice that the bottom order guys got us to what we thought was a pretty competitive total,” said Edwards. “I thought that we were awesome with the ball and probably even more so on the field, where we had let ourselves down in the last few games.”
