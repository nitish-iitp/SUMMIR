    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Pat Cummins: 'It was a great win leading to the semis and good to chase a total like that. We were not at our sharpest in the first innings, It was a really good wicket. We brought it back towards the end to a total that we could chase.'",
        "Pat Cummins: 'All 15 players have played this tournament now and I feel we can pick any one of them (For Thursdays semi-final v South Africa)'",
        "Pat Cummins: 'Outstanding. I thought it was impressive the way he finished off the innings. The tempo that he played at was sustainable and he is a scary prospect to have for the next week. We\u2019ve won Seven games in a row, even when we were not at our best in some of those games, we came away with a win. Chasing 300-plus was something we did not do earlier so it feels like everything is clicking together.'",
        "Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto: 'I think for me the two run outs were crucial, the way we started was good but after the two run outs, we lost momentum. If we score 340-350, it could have been different. We did not bowl well in the middle overs. The fast bowlers bowled well but we need to improve in the middle overs.'",
        "Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto: 'We did not play our best at the World Cup as a team, in both bowing and batting. Want to look at what we can do better moving forward. Mahmudullah batted really well\u2026 Shakib bowled really well in a couple of matches. It is not about individual performances. We will look back at all nine matches and see where we have to improve as a team.'",
        "Mitch Marsh: 'It feels great! Obviously it is nice to chase this total down and now it is on to the semis.'",
        "Mitch Marsh: 'I sort of knew that when Head came back in I would go down to three. It\u2019s important to play with the same intent and back myself. There were a few games where I lost my intent so it is good to get it back. You will fail sometimes but it\u2019s important to get it right more times.'",
        "Mitch Marsh: 'I am sure my Nana and Mum and everyone will be watching at home, and hopefully they will have a smile on their faces. My grandfather was a great man and we celebrated his life. Nice to be able to perform and to get the win.'",
        "Mitch Marsh: 'Can\u2019t wait, mate! It is going to be a ripper. The four best teams are playing in the semis and I cannot wait to get to Kolkata.'"
