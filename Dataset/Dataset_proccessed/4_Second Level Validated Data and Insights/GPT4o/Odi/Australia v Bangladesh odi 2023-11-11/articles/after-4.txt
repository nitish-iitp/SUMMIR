I’ll be back for India’s tune up against the Dutch tomorrow but really from now it is all eyes on those semi final matches. It’s been a long old road but we’re getting there and it promises to be a belter of a final week. Right, that’s me away – goodbye!

And here’s a chipper looking Pat Cummins:

It was a great win leading to the semis and good to chase a total like that. We were not at our sharpest in the first innings, It was a really good wicket. We brought it back towards the end to a total that we could chase.

“All 15 players have played this tournament now and I feel we can pick any one of them (For Thursdays semi-final v South Africa)

(The skipper is then asked about Mitchell Marsh’s innings)

Outstanding. I thought it was impressive the way he finished off the innings. The tempo that he played at was sustainable and he is a scary prospect to have for the next week. We’ve won Seven games in a row, even when we were not at our best in some of those games, we came away with a win. Chasing 300-plus was something we did not do earlier so it feels like everything is clicking together.”

Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto speaks:

I think for me the two run outs were crucial, the way we started was good but after the two run outs, we lost momentum. If we score 340-350, it could have been different. We did not bowl well in the middle overs. The fast bowlers bowled well but we need to improve in the middle overs.

“We did not play our best at the World Cup as a team, in both bowing and batting. Want to look at what we can do better moving forward. Mahmudullah batted really well… Shakib bowled really well in a couple of matches. It is not about individual performances. We will look back at all nine matches and see where we have to improve as a team.”

Mitch Marsh is player of the Match (well, durr):

It feels great! Obviously it is nice to chase this total down and now it is on to the semis.

(He’s asked about moving down to number three with Travis Head’s return)

“I sort of knew that when Head came back in I would go down to three. It’s important to play with the same intent and back myself. There were a few games where I lost my intent so it is good to get it back. You will fail sometimes but it’s important to get it right more times.

“I am sure my Nana and Mum and everyone will be watching at home, and hopefully they will have a smile on their faces. My grandfather was a great man and we celebrated his life. Nice to be able to perform and to get the win. (Marsh’s grandfather passes away a few days ago, he travelled back to Australia last week to visit him)

(On the semi-finals)

“Can’t wait, mate! It is going to be a ripper. The four best teams are playing in the semis and I cannot wait to get to Kolkata.”

44th over: Australia 299-2 (Marsh 175, Smith 58) Mahedi comes back into the attack for Bangladesh, he’s been their best bowler today – going for just 38 off his nine overs. He stops the flow of boundaries but not the runs in general as six are taken off his over with ease. Eight more needed, Smith and Marsh have batted so well that this has become a bit of a cakewalk. A Vic sponge stroll? A Maderia Meander? Sorry. Flagging a bit to be honest. Nearly there – just eight needed for Australia.

42nd over: Australia 284-2 (Marsh 166, Smith 52) Marsh leans back and flays Mustafizur over point for four. Next ball is up… up and SIX! Marsh toed that but it still lands over the rope. This ground ain’t big enough for the Mitchell Marsh. Just 23 needed now for Australia.

41st over: Australia 270-2 (Marsh 154, Smith 50) Steve Smith goes to his 32nd ODI half century, he’s looked in increasingly good touch, very good news for Australia as they head into the bizniss end of the tournament.

“No sir : Smith has NOT “smited seven sixes”. He has “smitten seven sixes”. Once he’s out, you may write that he “smote seven sixes”

“A severe warning” writes Alistair Connor, “Next time I’ll be obliged to write you a ticket”

Whoops. But then Al signs his email ‘Alistari’ so I’m just not sure what to believe…

Its a bit of fun.

40th over: Australia 264-2 (Marsh 152, Smith 46) Smith drives back past Mustafizur and the ball clatters into the stumps at the non-strikers end. Marsh starts to walk off thinking that Mustafizur got a bit of boot on it with him stranded but Smith calls him back. They send it upstairs and it is NOT OUT – the ball just bounced over the bowler’s boot. A glance to leg brings Marsh on strike and he clatters back to back fours into the leg side to bring up his 150 off just 117 balls! Merciless.

39th over: Australia 254-2 (Marsh 143, Smith 45) Marsh slaps Taskin through the covers on the front foot for another four – his fourteenth. He’s also smited seven sixes. Taskin responds with a couple of toe ticklin’ yorkers, Marsh clips to leg and hobbles down the other end. 53 needed from 66 balls. I know where my money is.

38th over: Australia 249-2 (Marsh 138, Smith 45) Nasum to bowl his final over, he drifts into the slot to Marsh and is clubbed for SIX! The bat twisted in Marsh’s hands and he got nowhere near timing it but it sailed over the fence. The brute power of the man is scary.

37th over: Australia 240-2 (Marsh 130, Smith 44) Taskin is punched to mid on by Smith and the single brings up the 100 partnership for this pair. Three more singles and a wide are followed by a deliciously timed drive by Smith back past the bowler for four. Smith has played himself into excellent touch in this innings – South Africa beware.

36th over: Australia 231-2 (Marsh 128, Smith 38) Nasum returns for his penultimate over… Marsh sweeps his first ball fine for four. The big man is suffering from cramp I think – get some silverskins crushed up – Mitch needs some pickle juice! Boff! Marsh has decided if it is up then it is off as he launches over extra for another powerfully struck four. A slooowly run single brings Smith on strike and he doesn’t miss out on a short and wide delivery, hanging back in his crease and steering away for four to make it fourteen runs off the over. 76 needed for ‘straya.

35th over: Australia 217-2 (Marsh 119, Smith 33) The Fizz is into his seventh over and he stitches together a lesser spotted maiden. Smith is pegged back and hemmed in, top bowling from Mustafizur.

34th over: Australia 217-2 (Marsh 119, Smith 33) Mahedi replaces Mehidy after Mehidy replaced Mahedi earlier. It’s the little things. The bowler gets through his action in a flash and is darting the ball with no flight at the stumps and pads, it doesn’t stop Marsh and Smith from working six singles off the over. 90 runs needed from 96 balls.

33rd over: Australia 211-2 (Marsh 116, Smith 30) Marsh gets some electrolytes on board, I keep hearing the phrase ‘pickle juice’? Sounds delish. Whatever he was slurping it’s keeping him in fine fettle as first ball back after the short break Marsh slots Mustafizur for a ginormous six! It was in his arc and he walloped it miles. Australia doing this in some style now.

32nd over: Australia 202-2 (Marsh 108, Smith 29) The double ton comes up for Australia as Marsh dances down the wicket and clears the ropes for another maximum. Pedal being introduced to metal now. Time for a drink.

31st over: Australia 192-2 (Marsh 100, Smith 27) Eventually (arf) Mitchell Marsh goes to his second century of this World Cup! It took him just 87 balls and he’s been dominant from ball one. A punched back foot single gets him there, he looks stoked/dead chuffed/delete as appropriate. Good on him, one of the game’s most likeable characters.

The single brings Smith on strike and The Smudger decides to come to the party! A farmhand hack into the leg side brings four and then is followed up with a massive slog sweep for SIX! Attaboy.

30th over: Australia 179-2 (Marsh 99, Smith 15) Drama! Marsh comes onto strike after a Steve Smith paddle for a single… he needs one run to get to three figures. Dot. Dot… another DOT. The crowd get into it, cheering and jeering after every ball. DOT! Marsh can’t break the infield and is forced to wait for his magic moment. Well bowled Mahedi Hasan.

29th over: Australia 178-2 (Marsh 99, Smith 14) Nasum continues and it’s just four runs off the over, Australia require six an over from here so that set of six is a tiny victory for Bangladesh, what they dearly need are wickets. Marsh onto 99!

28th over: Australia 174-2 (Marsh 98, Smith 12) Marsh moves to within two runs of a deserved century. Once he gets there I reckon he’ll go on turbo drive to haul down this target. Is that just projection/wishful thinking? You bet it is.

26th over: Australia 164-2 (Marsh 94, Smith 6) Six! Marsh breezily lofts Mehidy back over his head for a sizeable maximum into the stands. Eeesht. The big man is in beast mode now, a short ball from Mehidy is swatted for a once bounce four to finish the over. Mitch enters the nineties in some style.

25th over: Australia 151-2 (Marsh 83, Smith 4) Marsh smites Mustafizur through cover for four to move into the eighties. It’s been a fab knock so far. Half way through the innings, Australia need 156 more runs and have eight wickets in the hutch.

24th over: Australia 145-2 (Marsh 78, Smith 3) Ricky Ponting tells the story of Shane Warne predicting Herschelle’s butter fingers in a team meeting before that match in ‘99. This won’t be the last time in the next few days that you’ll see this clip and hear Tony Grieg’s accompanying description of it as a “little lollipop”

Back in Pune, Mitch Marsh glances Taskin fine to pick up four more.

WICKET! Warner c Najmul Hossain Shanto b Mustafizur (Australia 132-2)

Mustafizur returns and snares Warner! A soft dismissal for Warner, he chipped a full ball to Shanto at mid on. A bit of last gasp drama as Shanto does a Herschelle Gibbs impression and spills the ball as he goes to throw it in the air in celebration but he clung onto if for just long enough before he then lost control of it.

Steve Smith is the new batter and he’s off the mark with a clip to leg and Marsh continues on his merry way despite the loss of Warner, driving a full ball through cover for four.

23rd over: Australia 139-2 (Marsh 79, Smith 2)

22nd over: Australia 132-1 (Warner 53, Marsh 68) Taskin bustles in and escapes the over with just a couple from it. His blushes aren’t in tact mind as a roooobish review is called for with the DRS showing the ball hit Warner a country mile outside the line.

21st over: Australia 130-1 (Warner 52, Marsh 67) Nasum bowls a tidy over but sends down one ball a smidge too full that is powerfully swept for four by Mitch Marsh.

If the Spirit/Laws of Cricket are your bag then have a swizz at this:

When the helmet broke, it appears that Mathews did not consult with the umpires, which a player would be expected to do when seeking new equipment. Rather, he just signalled to the dressing room for a replacement. Had he explained to the umpires what had happened and asked for time to get it sorted out, they might have allowed him to change the helmet, perhaps calling Time and thus removing any possibility of being Timed out.”

20th over: Australia 125-1 (Warner 52, Marsh 62) Taskin returns to the attack as Bangladesh yearn for a wicket. It’s a decent over, just three singles off it. No dice in the scoreboard column that really matters though.

19th over: Australia 122-1 (Warner 51, Marsh 60) David Warner goes to fifty off the first over back after drinks, a crunching cut behind point off Nasum is followed by a deft reverse-sweep for four. Marsh has been the aggressor but Warner now has 50 off 52 balls so has given his strike rate a shot in the arm. Australia looking confident in this chase and, dare I say it, much more so than South Africa against Afghanistan yesterday.

One man who will be crucial in the semi final for Australia is Adam Zampa. Check out the company he’s keeping:
