Australia play Bangladesh in Pune, with the Aussies already sure of a place in the semi-final, while Bangladesh will be looking for a win to secure qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy.

It’s a free hit for the Aussies who, regardless of the result against the Tigers, will play South Africa in the second semi-final next week. But for Bangladesh, there is more riding on the result.

Currently sitting eighth in the table, they need to ensure they don’t slip below the Netherlands to secure the final qualification spot for the Champions Trophy - something they can achieve by matching whatever result the Dutch achieve against India.

In reality, Bangladesh should be fine. India are all-conquering and should sweep aside the Dutch with ease, but if we don’t cling on to that slight element of jeopardy, then we really are left with nothing.

Bangladesh will be led by Najmul Shanto, after their regular skipper Shakib Al-Hasan left the tournament with a fractured finger.
