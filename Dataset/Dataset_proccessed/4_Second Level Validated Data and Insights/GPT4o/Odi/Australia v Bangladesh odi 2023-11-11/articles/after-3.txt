Mitch Marsh has ended an emotional fortnight with a Cricket World Cup tour de force, which he hopes has put a smile on the face of his family back in Australia.

Key points:
Marsh left the Australian squad earlier this month to return home
His grandfather Ross died this month
Marsh scored 177 from 132 deliveries in Australia's win over Bangladesh

The all-rounder scored 177 not out from 132 deliveries, helping Australia defeat Bangladesh by eight wickets in Pune.

Marsh felt the knock was a fitting way to celebrate the life of his late grandfather.

The Western Australian, a popular figure with his teammates, had rushed home from India to be with family in the final days before grandfather Ross died.

But he promised to return swiftly to help Australia win the World Cup and was in inspired mood as he smashed nine sixes and 17 fours in his second century of the tournament on Saturday.

"I'm sure my nana, mum and all the family will be watching at home, so hopefully it's put a smile on their faces," Marsh said.

Mitch Marsh recaptures his form to ensure Australia will go into the World Cup semi-finals on the back of seven straight wins and an eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh.

"My pop was a great man and a huge cricket supporter and they celebrated his life yesterday.

"Obviously, it's been a challenging week for the family. It was nice to be able to perform for them and nice to get the win."

After he had flown home from India, a show of support from his teammates had touched the 32-year-old back in Perth.

He saw them on TV during the England match in Ahmedabad wearing black armbands to mark Ross's passing.

Marsh is up for the challenge that lies ahead with a semifinal against South Africa in Kolkata next Thursday.

"To go back into the World Cup is pretty cool. Can't wait for the semifinal, it's going to be a ripper," Marsh said.

"We're bloody pumped to get to Kolkata."

Marsh sounded almost embarrassed about ending up with the player-of-the-match award after earlier conceding 48 runs off his four overs with the ball, as Bangladesh set Australia a stiff target of 307.

"I started at negative 50 after my bowling, so I had to get a few back," Marsh said.

"But any time you score 100 for Australia, it's always a great feeling, and now we're obviously really excited about what lies ahead for us."

Just like the rested Glenn Maxwell's incredible double century against Afghanistan, it had been trying work in the heat of Pune for Marsh.

"It's always a great honour to score 100, but I was pretty cooked, to be honest," Marsh said.

"I was just starting to cramp at that stage, so I was trying to keep my heart rate low and not exert too much energy.

"This one meant just as much as any other 100 that I've ever made."
