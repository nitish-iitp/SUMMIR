Goodbye for now

So Australia are well and truly up and running now.

They move level on points with Pakistan and South Africa, although the latter have only played three games.

It’s a huge game tomorrow for the Proteas as they take on the defending champions, England, who themselves could move to two wins from four with a win.

That would tighten the World Cup up incredibly as we approach the halfway mark of the group stage.

For Australia, they have a break until Wednesday when they take on the Netherlands in Delhi.

Pakistan take on Bangladesh in Mumbai on Monday.

That’s it from the Al Jazeera live blog for today.

Hope you’ve enjoyed the live coverage – join us again next time.

Goodbye from the team.

Cummins – ‘That’s a great win’

Australia captain Pat Cummins faced some tough questions after losing his first two games at the World Cup.

He was beaming after this one.

“That was a great win,” he said.

“That was proper from the openers. That’s set the tone. That’s how we want to play our cricket – taking the game on.

“To take 82 in the Powerplay was fantastic and I can’t ask for any more.

“It’s a tough stadium and pitch to bowl, but we stayed aggressive and a good use of bouncers, and you saw Stoinis come in and show his energy and hit the deck hard.

“We’ve come off two really good wins and we have a few days break. We’ve set the benchmark and we need to keep it up.”

Azam admits shortcomings in defeat

Pakistan captain Babar Azam delivered an honest appraisal of the defeat.

“We were not up to the mark,” he said.

“If you drop a catch like David Warner like we did, then they will not spare you.

“We were not consistent in our line in that bowling lineup.

“All credit to the fast bowlers and spinners, the way we came back, we just tried to hit a length and the stumps.

“You need good partnerships and we started well but then we had small partnerships.”

Warner says groin won’t be a problem

Australia opener David Warner is Player of the Match after his century.

He didn’t field in the Pakistan innings due to a groin problem but he said it’s not a major concern.

“It’s a little bit sore but it’s all cramps at the moment so that’s all it is,” he said.

“We thought the threat was going to be the first five or six overs with the new ball so, once we got the pace of the wicket, we were going to try to target the next set of bowlers that came in.

“I had a good hit yesterday in the middle and I felt like I was ticking along. It was great to get out there and get a partnership with Marsh.

“We talked about trying to bat until 35 overs at least and then score heavily at the back end – putting the bowlers off their line and length – so from our perspective, there’s a little bit of tinkering to work on.”

Pakistan left licking their wounds

Six for 73 was the collapse in the end of Pakistan.

They were in it for so long, which is admirable given the target.

It really needed one of the two openers to go big.

Australia win by 62 runs!

Afridi goes again – this time Cummins is hammered over midwicket for four.

He tries his luck once too many times though and this time, he picks out the field in the deep.

Labuschagne holds on and it’s all over for Pakistan.

An amazing performance from Australia with the bat and they held their nerve with the ball, too.
