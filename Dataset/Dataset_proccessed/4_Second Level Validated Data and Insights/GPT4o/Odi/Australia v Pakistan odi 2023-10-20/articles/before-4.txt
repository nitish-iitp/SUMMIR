Bengaluru prepares itself to host its first match of the ICC ODI World Cup 2023. A resurgent Australian side will face Pakistan on Friday at the M Chinnaswamy stadium.

Australia, despite the win against Sri Lanka in their previous game, are sixth on the points table. Every match in the group stage has assumed importance as the Aussies cannot afford losses anymore.

Having lost the opening games to India and South Africa respectively, Aussies only have two points to their name from the opening three matches.

Pakistan, meanwhile, are fourth on the points table, with the clash against Australia a chance to put behind the memory of a harrowing loss last time out. The loss against arch-rivals India dented their Net Run Rate (NRR), and they would want to secure comprehensive victories in their upcoming games. 

Pakistan started off their campaign with resounding wins against Netherlands and Sri Lanka. But they would be looking to ensure the loss to India was just a blip.
