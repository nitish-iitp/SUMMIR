Match Preview:


The ICC ODI World Cup 2023 will see a thrilling encounter between Australia and Pakistan at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. Both these tournament favourites haven’t had the best of starts to their tournament and will hope to win this game at a high-scoring venue. Australia will enter this game after beating Sri Lanka and registering their first win. Whereas Pakistan lost to India in Ahmedabad.

Pitch Report:


The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in  Bengaluru has produced great batting tracks with an average score of 266. Here, the batters generally dominate with the stadium’s small boundaries. But bowlers can come as the pitch allows fast bowlers to get some swing with the new ball. Similarly, the spinners could get some turn as the pitch settles down.

Team Analysis:

Australia

The Australian team suffered two tough defeats in their first three games but finally registered their first win against Sri Lanka. The Aussie batting hasn’t had a great tournament with greats like Steven Smith and David Warner failing to score runs. But the Australian bowling has looked great with both fast bowlers and spinners being among the wickets.

SportsTiger Playing XI of Australia


Mitchell Marsh, David Warner, Steven Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (c), Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

Pakistan

Similarly, Pakistan have had many holes in their team with poor performers across the line-up. The top-order batters have failed to score a lot of runs, especially with Babar Azam not finding form. Similarly, their spin bowling has been a big letdown with Shadab Khan and Muhammad Rizwan failing to pick regular wickets.

SportsTiger Playing XI of Pakistan


Abdullah Shafique, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf

Match Prediction:


  


Conclusion:

Australia has a better chance to win this fixture and defeat Pakistan to register its second straight win in the ICC ODI World Cup 2023.
