Australia vs Pakistan RESULTS | Warner down plays groin concerns
Damien McCartney
Share post

David Warner has downplayed concerns he's carrying a groin injury, despite spending a majority of the Pakistan innings in the pavilion.

Warner scored a sensational 163 for man of the match honours, but disappeared from the ground early on in Pakistan's reply.

He was replaced in the field by Sean Abbott, who dropped Abdullah on the boundary early on.

But speaking post-match, Warner said the issue was "just cramps".

"It's a little bit a little bit sore but it's just all cramps at the moment … that's all it is," he said.

Australia has a four-day break before the next match against the Netherlands.

Australia vs Pakistan RESULTS | Australia still have improvement to come
Damien McCartney
Share post

Mark Taylor believes Australia are "finding their groove" after claiming their second win of the World Cup.

But he thinks there's still improvement to come.

"I don't think they're playing their best cricket at the moment, but that opening stand between Warner and Marsh kicked things off for Australia," he said.

"Probably could have got more, but in the end 367 was enough.

"With the ball, Hazlewood was fantastic, as was Zampa.

"Fielding was good without being great - a couple of dropped catches, but if we get that right, I think we are back into the tournament."

Australia's next match will be against the Netherlands in Delhi on Wednesday.

Australia vs Pakistan LIVE | Australia win!
Damien McCartney
Share post

Australia has notched up their second successive win at the World Cup.

Off the back of his five-wicket haul with the ball and having just belted Cummins for four, Shaheen Afridi was too greedy, and smoked one straight to Marnus Labuschagne on the square leg boundary.

That's a 62-run victory for the Aussies.

Australia vs Pakistan LIVE | One more to go
Damien McCartney
Share post

Hasan Ali is the latest Pakistan batter back in the sheds, caught behind off the bowling of Mitchell Starc.

The wicket ensures Starc's perfect record of taking a wicket in each of the 22 World Cup matches he's played in remains intact.

One more to go!

Australia vs Pakistan LIVE | Zampa has another four
Damien McCartney
Share post

Adam Zampa has his second successive four-wicket hall, he's lured Mohammad Nawaz out of his crease.

Josh Inglis did the rest behind the stumps.

That's eight down now for Pakistan, who need 76 from only 38 balls.

Australia vs Pakistan LIVE | Rizwan gone!
Damien McCartney
Share post

Rizwan is now gone! Is that all she wrote for Pakistan?

Zampa dragged one down and Rizwan looked to pull it through square leg but missed. It struck him on the upper thigh and was given out.

He reviewed it, but the DRS showed it was just clipping leg stump and the decision stands.

It's starting to look bleak now for the men in green.

"They've got a herculean task from here," Mark Taylor said on Nine's coverage.

That's now three wickets for Zampa.

If Australia can bowl Pakistan out for less than 340, they will move ahead of them on the table on a better net run-rate.

Australia vs Pakistan LIVE | Zampa bags Iftikhar
Damien McCartney
Share post

Another wicket Australia needed badly - this time it's Iftikhar Ahmed who's back in the sheds.

He was still looking to play aggressively, but played back to a Zampa topspinner that skidded through and trapped him in front.

There were two noises though and it was originally given not out.

Cummins reviewed it, and DRS showed the ball clearly struck the pad first, and it was taking out middle stump.

If the Aussies can get Rizwan now, they will be just about home.

Australia vs Pakistan LIVE | Momentum starting to swing
Damien McCartney
Share post

Iftikhar Ahmed has arrived at the crease with a licence to swing apparently.

He's dispatched Pat Cummins over the fence twice, and has now taken it to Marcus Stoinis as well.

He's raced to 24 off just 18 balls and that required rate is starting to come down.

Pakistan need 103 runs from 71 balls.

Australia vs Pakistan LIVE | Stoinis in the game again
Damien McCartney
Share post

Marcus Stoinis is in the game once again, taking a good catch off Pat Cummins bowling to remove Saud Shakeel.

The ball was back of a length and Shakeel tried to pull it, but it was on him quick and he got a top edge.

Stoinis had to run backwards to take the catch, but made it look comfortable in the end.

The Aussies needed that - Shakeel and Rizwan had just notched up the 50 partnership comfortably and both were looking dangerous.

The required run rate is still not out of control for Pakistan, but another wicket or two for the Aussies will make it incredibly difficult.
