The two batters took the attack to Pakistan from the word go at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. The record opening stand between Warner and Marsh saw both of them completing their respective centuries.

Marsh got to the hundred-run mark in 100 balls, hitting 10 boundaries and six maximums against Pakistan in Bengaluru. He went on to score 121 runs off 108 balls, smashing 10 boundaries and nine maximums. His partnership with Warner was broken in the 34th over by Shaheen Shah Afridid. However, the damage had already been done as the two openers put up 259 runs for the opening wicket in Bengaluru.

Australia lost their opening two matches in the tournament against hosts India and South Africa. They bounced back with a comfortable win against 1996 champions Sri Lanka and will be looking t do the same against Pakistan as well.

The Aussies find themselves in the middle of the World Cup 2023 points table and are still two places off the top-four spots.
