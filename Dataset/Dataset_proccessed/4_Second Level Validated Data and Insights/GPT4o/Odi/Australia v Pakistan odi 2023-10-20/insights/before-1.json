        "Both these tournament favourites haven\u2019t had the best of starts to their tournament and will hope to win this game at a high-scoring venue.",
        "Australia will enter this game after beating Sri Lanka and registering their first win. Whereas Pakistan lost to India in Ahmedabad.",
        "The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru has produced great batting tracks with an average score of 266. Here, the batters generally dominate with the stadium\u2019s small boundaries. But bowlers can come as the pitch allows fast bowlers to get some swing with the new ball. Similarly, the spinners could get some turn as the pitch settles down.",
        "The Australian team suffered two tough defeats in their first three games but finally registered their first win against Sri Lanka.",
        "The Aussie batting hasn\u2019t had a great tournament with greats like Steven Smith and David Warner failing to score runs. But the Australian bowling has looked great with both fast bowlers and spinners being among the wickets.",
        "Similarly, Pakistan have had many holes in their team with poor performers across the line-up. The top-order batters have failed to score a lot of runs, especially with Babar Azam not finding form. Similarly, their spin bowling has been a big letdown with Shadab Khan and Muhammad Rizwan failing to pick regular wickets.",
        "Australia has a better chance to win this fixture and defeat Pakistan to register its second straight win in the ICC ODI World Cup 2023."
