Sanjay Bangar doesn't want Indian opener Shubman Gill to be rushed into the playing lineup after his bout with illness ahead of the World Cup opening match against Australia.

Gill's participation in the opening World Cup match against Australia on October 8th, 2023, at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai is uncertain due to health issues. He tested positive for dengue and has been experiencing high fever since landing in Chennai. Despite his illness, he hasn't been ruled out of the match as of yet. The final decision will be made by the medical team based on his recovery progress.

India's coach, Rahul Dravid, provided an update on Gill's condition, stating that while the young opener's availability for the Australia game wasn't confirmed, he wasn't outrightly denied either. Dravid mentioned that Gill was feeling better and would continue to be monitored by the medical team. If Gill's recovery takes longer than expected, he might also miss the matches against Afghanistan on October 11 and Pakistan on October 14.

Gill's potential absence could pose a significant challenge for the team, given his impressive performance this season. He amassed 1,230 runs from 20 matches at an average of 72.35 in ODIs this year. If Gill remains unavailable for the clash on Sunday, Ishan Kishan could potentially replace him.

Speaking to Star Sports, Bangar said that Gill would be eager to get back on the field. However, the former India batting coach suggested that the team management shouldn't be looking to rush the youngster back into the lineup as given that it is a long tournament.

Bangar suggested that the team management should be looking to preserve the 24-year-old for the rest of the tournament.

"Even if he is half fit, he himself would want go out and play and take guard against Australia, against whom he has enjoyed playing. He is young, he wants to make a mark in the tournament and doesn’t really want to miss any of those games."

"We all have been in that sort of phase where he is at. It really augurs well for the Indian team that they still think he can play but let’s wait and watch what happens. I don’t really want them to rush him back because it’s a long tournament. Chennai has humidity, it’s pretty sapping on the body. Even if he has to miss a game, that’s fine. Don’t rush him back. Preserve him for the rest of the tournament," said Bangar.
