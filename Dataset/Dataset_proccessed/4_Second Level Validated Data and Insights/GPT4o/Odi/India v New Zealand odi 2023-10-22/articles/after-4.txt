India secured their fifth consecutive win in the 2023 ICC ODI World Cup by defeating New Zealand in Dharamsala. Virat Kohli's 95 helped India chase down a 274-run target with four wickets in hand and 12 balls to spare. Kohli nearly equaled Sachin Tendulkar's record of most hundreds in 50-over format, but was holed out by Glenn Phillips in the 48th over. This was India's first win against New Zealand in the World Cup since 2003 and propelled the hosts to the top of the standings with 10 points.

NEW DELHI: A resilient Indian team overcame a tough challenge from New Zealand in Dharamsala to register their fifth successive win in the 2023 ICC ODI World Cup. Riding on Virat Kohli's 95, hosts India chased down a competitive 274-run target with 4 wickets in hand and 12 balls to spare in a chilly night on Sunday.
Kohli came agonisingly close to equal Sachin Tendulkar's record of most hundreds in 50-over format, before being holed out at deep mid-wicket by Glenn Phillips off Matt Henry's delivery in the 48th over.
India were left to score just 5 more runs for the victory when Kohli walked off the field.
As it happened: India vs New Zealand
After Mohammed Shami's five-wicket haul restricted New Zealand to below 280, Kohli stitched three solid partnerships to take India home. It was India's first win against New Zealand in the World Cup since the 2003 edition. The win propelled India to the top of the standings with 10 points, two more than New Zealand, who suffered their first defeat in the tournament.


Here's how India got the better of New Zealand to remain unbeaten in the World Cup:
Early blow for New Zealand
India sent New Zealand to bat after winning the toss and bowlers removed the openers early and cheaply to give the hosts a perfect start. After a slow start, the Kiwis lost Devon Conway for a duck when he was holed out at square leg by Shreyas Iyer in the fourth over off the bowling of Mohammed Siraj. Iyer took a sharp low catch to send Conway back. Before they could steady their innings, New Zealand lost Will Young to Mohammed Shami in the ninth over. Shami, who was playing his first game of the tournament, struck with his first delivery of the World Cup to castle Young's wickets. New Zealand were struggling at 19/2 in 8.1 overs at that stage.

A bumper partnership
In-form New Zealand batters Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell not only steady the innings, they put on a massive 159-run partnership for the third wicket to set a good platform for a big total. Ravindra got a reprieve early in the 11th over, when India's star fielder Ravindra Jadeja dropped a regulation catch at backward point. It cost India dearly as the Kiwi batter accumulated 75 off 87 balls, with a six and six fours, when he fell to Shami in the 34th over after the mammoth stand. India fielders, namely KL Rahul and Jasprit Bumrah, then gave Mitchell two lifelines when he was on 59 and 69. Mitchell also punished India for the mistakes by scoring his career-best 130, off 127, which included five sixes and nine fours.

Shami led India's fightback
New Zealand were cruising towards 300-plus total at 243 for 4 in the 45th over, with Mitchell still in the middle. But India bowlers fought back gallantly to stop the Kiwis below 275, taking regular wickets in the last six overs. Shami was the wrecker-in-chief for the hosts, taking his second five-wicket haul in the ODI World Cup, which is a record for an Indian bowler. New Zealand lost their last six wickets for just 30 runs in 36 balls and were bowled out for 273.
India off to a flier in run chase
As it has been happening in the tournament, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill gave India a flying start in their run chase. Skipper Rohit was at his brutal best, hitting four sixes and equal numbers of boundaries in his 40-ball 46 knock. In the process, Rohit became the first Indian to hit 50-plus ODI sixes in a calendar year. When he was clean bowled by Lockie Ferguson in the 12th over, India openers had added 71 runs in quick time. Ferguson then removed Gill, 26 off 31, in his next over to reduce India to 76/2 in 13.2 overs.

Solid stands keep India on course
India's run machine Virat Kohli then stitched two solid stands with Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul to keep the team on the course of the competitive target. First, Kohli and Iyer added 52 runs for the third wicket to steady the chase before the latter was dismissed by Trent Boult in the 22nd over. In between, the play was also halted due to fog, a rare occurrence for sure. Kohli then added 54 runs with Rahul to make sure that India remained in the hunt. New Zealand clawed back a bit by removing Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav in quick succession. Rahul was trapped LBW by Mitchell Santner in the 33rd over, before Surya was run out after a big mixed up with Kohli in the next over.
Kohli misses ton, but India triumph
It was so near yet so far for Kohli as he missed a golden opportunity to join legendary Sachin Tendulkar at the top of the list of most hundreds in the One Day Internationals. Kohli, who scored his 48th ODI hundred in the last match, fell for 95 while going for a big finish. But by then he had put on a solid 78 runs for the sixth wicket with all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who remained unbeaten on 39 off 44 balls with the help of one six and three fours. Two balls after Kohli's wicket, Jadeja hit a winning four off Henry.
