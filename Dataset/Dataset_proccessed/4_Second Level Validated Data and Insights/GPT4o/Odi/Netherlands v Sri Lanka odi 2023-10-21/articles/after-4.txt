Chasing a target of 263, Sri Lankan batters started slow, but picked up pace. However, they lost three batter at very short intervals. Pathum Nissanka (54), Sadeera Samarawickrama (91*) and Charith Asalanka (44) made some quality partnership, that led Sri Lanka to a 5-wickets victory against The Netherlands.
