Welcome to Sportstar’s Live Blog of the ODI World Cup match between Sri Lanka and Netherlands happening at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow on Saturday.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 18:12
W
SL 263/5 in 48.2 overs

Sri Lanka needs 21 off 30. Samarawickrama is 14 away from a century.

de Silva pulls a shorter delivery from van Beek behind square. Just manages to clear the rope. And another maximum! This one’s headed for the sightscreen.

It is becoming extremely difficult for Samarawickrama to get to his hundred. It is still possible with two sixes. But no, he takes a single, so that’ll be it.

The off-break does him in. de Silva looks to go for the glory shot but ends up missing all of it. An alert Scott Edwards whips the bails off. Hemantha is in.

That’s some impressive running. Three runs. There’s a TV referral though. Nah, Samarawickrama is safe. Moves to 91.

And that’ll do it... GAME. SET. MATCH. Hemantha steps out to thump the winner down the ground for four as Sri Lanka wins by five wickets.

This is now the highest successful run chase at the venue! After eight successive losses in ODIs, this also happens to be Sri Lanka’s first win in India.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 17:57

SL 242/4 in 45 overs

Just two singles off Ackermann’s over. Sri Lanka is looking to take things easy; no unnecessary risks taken. The number of deliveries remaining is around 10 more than the runs required. A horrible, horrible mess up in the deep. Engelbrecht collects the ball but loses his grip, ending up hurling it into the advertisement boards and helping Sri Lanka get four more. Three runs as van Meekeren fumbles at mid-on.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 17:36

SL 223/4 in 40 overs

The 200 comes up for Sri Lanka. Five singles come from van der Merwe’s over.

Samarawickrama gets three runs as he drills one through extra cover. Teja gives it a good chase from mid-off and manages to reel it in just in time. van Meekeren sprays a full toss down leg; called wide. Four! Pulled by Samarawickrama in front of square.

Samarawickrama provided too much room outside off, and he uses the freebie to dab a boundary past backward point. It being the shorter side of the ground only makes the job easier.

van der Merwe strays down leg. Wide. These occasional extras continue to hurt Netherlands’ chances.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 17:09
B
SL 196/4 in 35 overs

Swing and a miss from Asalanka. The ball drifts a tad more than expected and it just misses the sticks. Another delivery which whizzes past the bat. Time for drinks.

It’s a fifty for Samarawickrama. His teammates applaud from the dugout. He acknowledges the standing ovation and points the bat in their direction.

Dutt with a timely dive that saves the ball from running down to the fence.

Bowled him! Dutt, in his final over, sees the stumps light up. Asalanka wanted to see this over off, having struggled against the spinner for a while now. However, it wasn’t to be. Dhananjaya comes to the crease. Dutt concedes a four off the last ball but it has been a great day out for him. His final figures read: 3/44.

The landing area for bowlers is giving them trouble again. The groundsmen are looking into the area where the footmarks have become prominent.

van Meekeren overcooks the bouncer, and it flies over the heads of both the ‘keeper and batter. Four byes, one for the over.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 16:46

SL 171/3 in 30 overs

One would normally think of getting the off-spinner on for a left-handed batter. However, interestingly, Asalanka has averaged 91 against off-spin since the 2019 World Cup.

An orthodox field for Aryan, who would be looking to pitch it between middle and off. There’s less than half-an-appeal as the ball jags away and thuds into Asalanka’s pads. They go for a review nonetheless. Even the bowler himself wasn’t interested. It would boil down to where the ball had pitched. Way outside off as it turns out. Some extra bounce on offer, and Aryan gets a rising delivery to turn sharply. Netherlands needs to put a slip in place. Asalanka and Samarawickrama run three after the former pierces a gap towards backward point.

van der Merwe sends a long, hard stare down Asalanka’s way. Scott Edwards, the skipper, asks his bowler to keep calm.

A vociferous appeal from Dutt. The round-the-wicket angle doesn’t convince the umpire. NED has taken the review. If they lose this appeal, they will be left with no reviews. The impact is ump’s call and Netherlands retains the review. It would have gone on to miss the woodwork entirely though.

Asalanka breaks the shackles to bludgeon the first six of the innings. Puts on his dancing shoes and goes over the head of the bowler.

van der Merwe’s first delivery spins through, beats everyone. Byes, four. Cries of “Catch” but a skier drops into no man’s land. The sweeper collects it. Required runs down to two digits.

Perfect placement from Samarawickrama and he will pick four more runs through backward point.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 16:41
SL 137/3 in 25 overs

Short from Van Meekeren and Asalanka gets on top of the bounce. Pulls it to midwicket for a four.

Off spinner Ackermann continues on against Asalanka. The left-handed batter is taking his time to sink into this chase. Wide from Van Meekeren and that allows Asalanka to cut loose. Slashed away for a four.

Sri Lanka needs these two to stay put for atleast 10 more overs to seal this chase. Ackermann gets in another economical over.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 16:19
SL 113/3 in 20 overs

Out walks Charith Asalanka and he starts off with five dot balls. Aryan Dutt is reintorduced, to attack the left-handed Asalanka.

Meekeren and Aryan keep both Lankan batters under a tight leash. No boundaries on the offer for either of them.

Ackermann with the 20th over. Another silent over. Just two runs from it.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 16:04
W
Nissanka walks back

Van der Merwe from around the wicket. Samarawickrama makes room and crashes it through the off side for a four. He adds one more boundary. This time with a paddle sweep.

Van Meekeren with a back-of-a-length delivery. Nissanka can only guide it to the keeper. Big blow for Sri Lanka.

Pathum Nissanka c †Edwards b van Meekeren 54 (52b 9x4 0x6)

OCTOBER 21, 2023 15:56
SL 96/2 in 15 overs

Van Meekeren sneaks in a quiet over. Just four runs from the over.

Samrawickrama is the new batter and he gets going straigth away. Meanwhile, Nissanka clips De Leede to the square leg boundary to keep the scoreboard moving.

Van der Merwe into the attack. Starts with a four-run over.

De Leede offers width and bounce and Nissanka slashes it over point for a four and gets to his fifty. Sri Lanka’s fortunes hinge heavily on Nissanka.

W
Kusal Mendis departs!

Full from Aryan and Nissanka goes for a slog sweep. Out of the reach of Engelbracht in the deep. Mendis too tries the same shot. Top-edge and it is an easy catch for Meekeren.

Kusal Mendis c van Meekeren b Dutt 11 (17b 2x4 0x6)

SL 56/2 in 10 overs

OCTOBER 21, 2023 15:25
SL 51/1 in 9 overs

Skipper Kusal Mendis gets going with an easy-on-eye cover drive against Van Beek. He has been the most reliable of the Lankan batters.

Van Meekeren starts off with a bouncer which evades the batter and the keeper. Four wides. Full from Meekeren and Nissanka drives it on the up. Four more.

On the pads from Van Beek and Nissanka is not one to miss out on. Flicked away for a four. He adds another boundary, this time with a well-timed straight drive.

Meekeren puts in five dot balls against Kusal Mendis, before gifting a full ball. Mendis drives it emphatically through covers.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 15:08
W
Perera falls!

Perera brings out the sweep shot against Aryan again. This time he places it well and gets a four. He goes for another aggressive shot. Cuts it, but hits it straight to point.

Kusal Perera c de Leede b Dutt 5 (8b 1x4 0x6)

SL 20/1 in 5 overs

OCTOBER 21, 2023 15:05
SL 14/0 in 4 overs

Nissanka starts sedately. Four dot balls to begin with, before a single is taken.

Van Beek from the other end. Nissanka chips one just beyond the covers for a couple of runs.

Aryan Dutt goes full on Perera’s pads. Full-blooded sweep. He is lucky to get away with a single. Aryan responds with one that sizzles past Nissanka’s outside edge. Great control from the young off spinner.

Van Beek draws an under-edge from Nissanka. Goes past first slip and that is the first four of the innings for Sri Lanka. He follows it with a leg glance, timing it well enough for another four.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 14:52
Sri Lanka begins chase

Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Perera begin the chase for Sri Lanka.

Aryan Dutt with the new ball for the Netherlands.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 14:41
Record Alert!
NED vs SL: Netherlands’ van Beek, Engelbrecht break Dhoni-Jadeja’s ODI World Cup partnership record for seventh wicket

The Netherlands’ Logan van Beek and Sybrand Engelbrecht broke the record for the highest seventh wicket partnership in ODI World Cups during their side’s match against Sri Lanka at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow on Saturday.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 13:55
W
NED 262 in 50 overs

Cleaned him up... And Madushanka does the trick off the very first ball! Why was he held back for this long? A 130-run partnership comes to an end. But what an epic knock this has been from Engelbrecht.

Roelof van der Merwe is the new man in. He is greeted with two wide deliveries. Oh, there’s another. Second bouncer of the over has also been called now.

van Beek gets to his fifty. And it has come with a fair bit of drama! The simplest of run out chances has been missed. There’s a fair bit of yes and no between van der Merwe and van Beek as both were stuck in the middle of the pitch. Wellalage, meanwhile, sends in a poor throw and Karunaratne with an even poorer attempt, fails to dislodge the bails as he falls over.

We have got four fifties in this World Cup by players batting seven or lower. Three of those have come from Netherlands cricketers.

Two more wides, it keeps getting worse for the Lankans. van Beek hits the flattest of sixes down the ground.

WICKET! van der Merwe departs. He tries to get his gloves out of the way of a freaky bouncer but it does carry a bit of feather en route to the ‘keeper. He doesn’t go for the review, which brings on Aryan Dutt in the dying moments of the innings.

Rajitha starts off with a wide. An extra too many, this, from Sri Lanka. Make that two successive wides.

Asalanka times his dive to perfection. Finally, a brilliant moment in the field from SL. van Beek will have to walk for 59, but he has done his job. OUT! A wicket comes off this over, but 11 runs as well, as Aryan Dutt picks a four off the last delivery. Last over coming up.

van Meekeren successfully digs out a terrific yorker. The ball trickles down to mid-on and it will be a single. Brave effort by Asalanka as he dives forward. The ball falls just short.

49.5 - Run out off a no ball! 1 extra run credited to the NED account. However, van Meekeren is the 10th wicket. Dutt charges to steal one off a bye but van Meekeren never noticed his partner. Netherlands folds for 262.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 13:34
50
NED 221/6 in 45 overs

A fighting fifty for Engelbrecht! A maiden one in ODIs at that. He would hope this translates into a big score on the board. Rajitha strays down leg; it’s a wide. Four! Engelbrecht looks so much more confident now. A length ball has been punched through cover.

The 100-run stand comes off 129 deliveries. Remarkable recovery. NED was 91/6 at one point. 260 has been the average score in Lucknow during the World Cup. Just putting it out there. The pitch here has also started to look better as the early-morning moisture has almost disappeared.

An off-cutter from Karunaratne goes on to hit the helmet of the ‘keeper lying on the ground. Marais Erasmus signals five runs. Dropped! Engelbrecht picks two runs as Hemantha spills what can be called a half-a-chance at best. It was an excellent effort though as the fielder covered a lot of ground before going for a full-blooded dive. And in no time, the team 200 also comes up. “We now have a semblance of a total, the cherry on the top is now required,” quips Pommie Mbangwa on air.

STOP THE PRESS! The duo have just set a new seventh-wicket partnership record in World Cups. They have gone past MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja’s stand against New Zealand from... yes, 2019. Oh, it all comes gushing back.

van Beek picks the shorter side. It’ll be a boundary to end the 45th over.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 13:20
6
NED 175/6 in 40 overs

Engelbrecht scampers back, having covered around half the pitch initially. There was never a single there and van Beek does well to send him back.

That’s gone through... four more from Engelbrecht. Hemantha’s length ball has been slashed across backward point.

High time Madushanka and Rajitha, the wicket-takers return to bowl. Kusal may have missed a trick here. The duo has six overs remaining among themselves. Since Engelbrecht and van Beek came out to bat, they haven’t bowled a single over.

Hemantha continues to leak runs. A full toss has been clobbered over midwicket.

Theekshana continues to extract sharp turn off the surface. Just two runs off his over.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 13:03
4
NED 151/6 in 35 overs

The first boundary since the 10th over! Engelbrecht welcomes Hemantha with a sweep through backward square for four. This is now the highest partnership of the game - 42 off 65 deliveries.

Engelbrecht shuffles across to reveal all of the three sticks before going for the pull. Gets the toe end of the bat to mid-on and lets out a grunt of frustration.

Seam’s back. SL realises it needs to break the growing partnership. Steep tennis-ball bounce from Karunaratne. He undoes all the good work with a wide and five wides. On both occasions, the ball sails over the head of the batter.

Through the gaps... Engelbrecht swats one away in disdain for four. It was a low, straighter delivery from Hemantha. The 150 comes up for the Dutch.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 12:47
NED 121/6 in 30 overs

It’s been 100-plus deliveries since the last boundary. However, one would think Netherlands would pick that any day if it means van Beek and Engelbrecht get to settle down before switching gears. The Sri Lankan spinners are making life extremely difficult for the duo in the middle. There is a slip in place as well.

A loud appeal from Hemantha for Engelbrecht’s wicket. However, it falls on deaf ears.

Time for some off-break from de Silva. The first ball has been gently reverse swept. The fielder at short third chases it down. The ball sharply spins away from Engelbrecht. Close!

OCTOBER 21, 2023 12:38
NED 103/6 in 25 overs

Karunaratne with another quiet over for Sri Lanka. Engelbrecht and Van Beek are the new batters for Netherlands and they have big takes in their hands.

Theekshana spins one into Van Beek’s pads. Muted appeal for an LBW. Nothing from the umpire. No review from Sri Lanka.

Hemantha gets his first over of the day. He is able to extract good spin from the pitch. Just three runs from the over.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 12:25
Skipper Edwards falls.

Madushanka with his seventh over of the innings. Madushanka fires a yorker in. It is blocked away by Edwards.

Theekshana pitches one on the sixth stump and spins one in sharply. Sneaks past Edwards’ inside edge and hits the top of the off stump.

Netherlands losing the plot here.

Scott Edwards b Theekshana 16 (16b 0x4 0x6)

OCTOBER 21, 2023 12:05
W
Netherlands in deep trouble

Skipper Scott Edwards. He gets off the mark with a reverse sweep against Theekshana.

Madushanka continues on from around the wicket. He strikes Nidamanuru on the front pad with an in-swinger. The umpire is unmoved. Sri Lanka reviews and it all three red.

Teja Nidamanuru lbw b Madushanka 9 (16b 0x4 0x6)

NED 81/5 in 20 overs

OCTOBER 21, 2023 12:00
W
Madushanka strikes!

Theekshana gets his first over of the day. Full length from him to start with. Four runs from his first over.

Madushanka from the other end. Short from him and De Leede guides it to the deep third. Perera takes a good low catch.

Bas de Leede c Perera b Madushanka 6 (21b 0x4 0x6)

OCTOBER 21, 2023 11:44
NED 60/3 in 15 overs

Karunaratne jags one back in and hits De Leede on the front pad. The umpire doesn’t agree to Lankan appeals. Mendis takes a late review. Umpire’s call saves Netherlands.

Karunaratne gets a maiden over in against Bas de Leede.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 11:33
W
Rajitha gets his third!

Karunaratne continues on. Just three runs from his second over. Bas de Leede is the new batter for the Netherlands.

Rajitha with another over. Length ball on the off side and Ackermann mistimes it completely. Edges it to the keeper. Would not be happy with how he executed the shot.

Colin Ackermann c †Mendis b Rajitha 29 (31b 5x4 0x6)

OCTOBER 21, 2023 11:22
NED 48/2 in 10 overs

Madushanka lands one on the leg stump moving one slightly away. Ackermann managed an edge, which saves him from an LBW decision.

Short from Madushanka and Ackermann pounces on it. Pulled away with power for a four.

Rajitha offers width and O’Dowd slices it in front of point for a four. Netherlands’ innings gaining momentum.

Chamika Karunaratne into the attack for Sri Lanka. Short from him and O’Dowd pulls it for the first six of the match.

Ackermann adds a couple more boundaries. This time against Rajitha. One from an edge and one with a flick to the square leg boundary.

Rajitha gets his second wicket though. O’Dowd nicks one onto his stumps off a length ball.

Max O’Dowd b Rajitha 16 (27b 1x4 1x6)

OCTOBER 21, 2023 10:55
NED 16/1 in 5 overs

This has been a controlled start from the Sri Lankan new-ball duo. No easy runs on offer the Netherlands batters.

Madushanka swings one away. Ackermann edges it, but it flies just past first slip and it runs away for a four. He adds to that with a straight drive, which too gets to the fence.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 10:49
W
Rajitha strikes early.

Madushanka starts with a maiden over. He keeps the pressure going in his second over too, until he attempts a yorker. It turns out to be a full toss and Vikramjit puts it away for a four down the leg side.

Rajitha is Madushanka’s new ball partner. He too starts strongly. The right-arm pacer pitches one on length and cuts it back in. Vikramjit misses it and he is caught plumb in front.

Vikramjit Singh lbw b Rajitha 4 (13b 1x4 0x6)

OCTOBER 21, 2023 10:31
Netherlands begins first innings

Vikramjit Singh and Maz O’Dowd begin the innings for the Netherlands. Madushanka with the new ball for Sri Lanka.

OCTOBER 21, 2023 10:07
What the captains had to say

Kusal Mendis: We have three injuries. We have to do well in both batting and bowling, hope we do in today’s game. We have positive things in the previous matches, we have batted really well. And the bowling unit has to bowl in partnerships. I am enjoying my own game, enjoying the captaincy.

Scott Edwards: We are going to have a bat first. The pitch looks pretty good, hopefully put a score on and look to defend it. We played reasonably well the other night, still have some improvements to make. Every team that is here would be saying the same thing, you have to probably win 5 games and that’s what we are here to do. We have got some quality spinners and quicks as well, we just come into the game, make some plans and go from there.

Preview

Their intent was clear under a blazing sun on Friday. The men in orange trained hard, the batters spending considerable time at the nets, the bowlers steaming in.

After recording one of the biggest upsets in cricket World Cup history, the Netherlands must be hoping to put up another great show on Saturday at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium, against Sri Lanka. The commanding win at Dharamshala would have boosted the morale of Scott Edward’s men, who have shown why they aren’t happy being referred to as an associate nation.

They had arrived in India wanting to make the semifinals. They aren’t here just to tell their grandchildren that they have played in cricket’s most prestigious tournament.

And they surely wouldn’t want to rest on the laurels of the South Africa game. They may not mind avenging their twin losses to Sri Lanka in the World Cup qualifier.
