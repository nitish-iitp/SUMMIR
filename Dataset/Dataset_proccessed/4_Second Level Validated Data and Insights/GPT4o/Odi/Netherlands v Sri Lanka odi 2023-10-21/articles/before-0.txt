Samarawickrama says that the wicket was gripping and turning, as was evident, and Sri Lanka planned to take the chase deep, which they did to great effect. Scott Edwards says that Netherlands' top order needs to chip in with more run, while praising Engelbrecht and van Beek for their rescue job. He says they could have been better in the field, but praises Aryan Dutt for his efforts. Kusal Mendis is just happy with everyone's contributions to the win.

And with that, our coverage of today's game comes to an end. But it's not the end of the action from the World Cup today. England have 400 to chase against South Africa at the Wankhede after Klaasen scored a sensational century to follow fifties from Reeza Hendricks and Rassie van der Dussen. You can head here to follow the action from that game.

First points for SL!

So, Sri Lanka chase down 263 with relative ease and pick up their first win of this World Cup. Sadeera Sameerawickrama saw them through with his 91-run knock after Pathum Nissanka laid down the platform with his third consecutive half-century.

Netherlands started well with the early wickets of Kusal Perera and Kusal Mendis thanks to Aryan Dutt, but Nissanka and Samarawickrama put on a 50-run stand to steady Sri Lanka.

Even after Nissanka fell to van Meekeren, Samarawickrama carried on, with Charith Asalanka adding support. Dhananjaya De Silva chipped in thereafter, and Dushmantha Hemantha finished the game with a boundary.

First points for Sri Lanka, Netherlands fail to do what they did against SA.

Sadeera loves the No. 4

The move to No. 4 has worked wonders for Sadeera Samarawickrama, who averages 10 runs more in that position compared to his career numbers. Six of his seven half-centuries and his only century have come batting at two down. His strike rate is also marginally better at No. 4 compared to his career.

He's now approaching a century but also running out of runs available with the target swiftly approaching.

Sri Lanka cruising to first win of the campaign

Despite the historic seventh-wicket stand between Sybrand Engelbrecht and Logan van Beek, and Aryan Dutt's heroic efforts with the ball, Sri Lanka look in cruise control on a fairly batting-friendly pitch. Pathum Nissanka hit a fine half-century and it's Sadeera Samarawickrama who is now steering Sri Lanka to their first win in the World Cup, after three consecutive defeats. This was the first time that Sri Lanka had lost their first three games in a World Cup since 1987, when they lost all of their games.

Netherlands, meanwhile, looking for a first ever win over Sri Lanka, are watching the game slip by.

Just when it looked like Sri Lanka were racing away with it, Aryan Dutt, in his last over, has given Netherlands another wicket. Asalanka misses a big slog sweep and the ball crashes into the stumps. This is Dutt's third wicket of the match and he nearly has another, as he raps Dhananjaya De Silva on the pads with one turning into him.

Netherlands are out of reviews though, which means they can't do anything about it once the umpire says no. That did look like it was spinning past leg stump though. Dutt finishes his quota having picked three wickets and created a whole bunch of other chances.

With the run rate well under control, Asalanka and Samarawickrama have steadily chipped away at the target without taking too many risks. Sri Lanka are prone to collapses and they would want these two to take them within striking distance of victory today. Samarawickrama, who was scoring at over a run a ball while batting with Nissanka, has slowed down and Asalanka has been the one doing the attacking, although that dynamic could switch at any time.

Paul van Meekeren gives Netherlands another wicket, with a lovely length ball outside off that takes the outside edge. But credit goes to Scott Edwards who flies to his right to grab a beauty of a catch. Pathum Nissanka has to walk back soon after his half-century. It ends the 52-run stand between him and Sadeera Samarawickrama. Van Meekeren also ends up with a wicket-maiden.

Back-to-back boundaries off Bas de Leede brings up a third consecutive half-century for Pathum Nissanka. He then picks up another boundary in the over to keep Sri Lanka's momentum up. It's been a fabulous knock so far, with some gorgeous drives and flicks. It's his seventh score of fifty or more in ODIs, and he has brought it up in just 48 balls.

Engelbrecht and van Beek - history makers!
ESPNcricinfo Ltd

The 130-run stand between Engelbrecht and van Beek is the highest partnership for the seventh wicket or lower at a men's ODI World Cup, going past Kapil Dev and Syed Kirmani's unbeaten 126-run stand in THAT game against Zimbabwe in 1983.

Aryan Dutt is on a roll here! Nissanka hit an aerial shot that Engelbrecht could not reach running across from deep square, giving Sri Lanka a reprieve. But Netherlands don't have to wait long as Mendis goes to sweep Dutt and gets a massive top edge. Fine leg goes across and grabs on to make it two wickets for Dutt.

But Dutt wasn't done there as he manufactured a stumping chance but Edwards couldn't connect, with the ball eventually going for four byes. He draws Samarawickrama forward with a ball tossed up on a length and the ball spins sharply past the batter down leg, and spins and bounces too much in fact, for even the Netherlands skipper behind the stumps. Brilliant over from Dutt.

How good is Pathum Nissanka to watch when he is in flow? He drives two overpitched deliveries to beat the mid-off fielder on either side of a flick to fine leg for three boundaries in nine balls. But he almost gets out as well, as he tries to cut van Beek and almost picks out backward point, but manages to just about clear him.

He gets a thick edge and the ball balloons up to short third and Netherlands have an early breakthrough. He couldn't get under it like he would have wanted and Perera has to go, with Kusal Mendis walking in.

After a measured start, Nissanka gets back-to-back boundaries off van Beek to build some momentum. He first went to cut a length ball that was swinging away outside off and an under-edge saw the ball go past the slip cordon. Then van Beek strays onto his pads and Nissanka whips it away authoritatively behind square on the leg-side.

Sri Lanka's highest chase against Netherlands

Netherlands' 262 today is their highest total against Sri Lanka, going past the 258 way back in 2006. Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Perera, who put on a 125-run stand in their last game against Australia, will look to give Sri Lanka a strong start. Aryan Dutt started off the chase with his offspin, with van Beek sharing the new ball with him.

Sri Lanka need 263

Netherlands 262 (Engelbrecht 70, van Beek 59, Madushanka 4-48, Rajitha 4-50) vs Sri Lanka

After losing five wickets for 43 runs, Netherlands came back thanks to a 130-run seventh wicket stand between Sybrand Engelbrecht and Logan van Beek to post a competitive 262 against Sri Lanka.

Both Dilshan Madushanka and Kasun Rajitha registered career-best figures as they picked four wickets apiece.

Rajitha started off with a seven-over opening spell that saw him strike three times. He first trapped Vikramjit Singh lbw with his first ball to the left-handed batter before Max O'Dowd and Colin Ackermann tightened things up.

But O'Dowd looked tentative and Rajitha got an inside edge off him that crashed into the stumps in the final over of the powerplay. He had to wait less for his next wicket, with Ackermann nicking behind in his next over.

Madushanka then had de Leede and Nidamanuru walking back and Maheesh Theekshana accounted for Scott Edwards with a lovely offspinner.

But then Engelbrecht and van Beek batted out more than 23 overs to frustrate Sri Lanka. Like Edwards and Roelof van der Merwe against South Africa, the two went about rebuilding before trying to up the tempo after the 40th over. Both got their maiden half-centuries as Netherlands set Sri Lanka a challenging total.

Kasun Rajitha has his second four-wicket haul in ODIs and right now, he has Asalanka to thank! Logan van Beek looks to flick him over midwicket, but Asalanka runs to his left and puts in a full-fledged dive to grab a difficult opportunity. Van Beek falls for a well made 59, and will feel happy about where he took the Netherlands after a top and middle order slide.

Rajitha, meanwhile, finishes with career-best figures of 4-50.

Madushanka gets the ball to kiss Roelof van der Merwe's gloves with a short ball as the batter tried to get out of the way and play a ramp.

This becomes his first four-wicket haul in ODIs. Good rewards for his efforts today. He was excellent in his first spell but couldn't get a wicket. Came back into the attack and got two wickets and has now picked two important wickets at the death.

It's been a fine knock from him, with a 100-plus partnership with Engelbrecht to rescue them. Now, with van der Merwe falling to a Madushanka bouncer, it's up to him to give them that final push for a big score

After a spiral of five wickets for 43 runs, Sybrand Engelbrecht and Logan van Beek's partnership, that's grown over fifty, has taken Netherlands past the 150-run mark. They are, in fact, just six runs short of where they were against South Africa at the 35-over mark and have an extra wicket in hand. That was a shortened game, of course, but they went on to make 89 runs off the last eight overs. How much can they get to today?

Netherlands captain Scott Edwards shepherded them after a top order collapse against South Africa, but is not able to contribute much today, falling for a run-a-ball 16. It's the first wicket for a spinner today, with Maheesh Theekshana tossing up an offspinner just outside off. Edwards went for the cover drive but the ball spun in to take the inside edge and crash into the stumps.

The length was also key here, as it wasn't completely pitched up and had Edwards reaching for it away from his body, opening up the gap between bat and pad.

Dilshan Madushanka has now picked two or more wickets in five consecutive games. Bowling from around the wicket, he gets the inswinger to beat the bat and traps Nidamanuru in front. Madushanka had already burned a review but convinces Mendis to review this one still and he's on the money. DRS shows the ball to be crashing into leg-stump. Sri Lanka firmly on top of proceedings here, with Netherlands losing half their side.

With that, Madushanka has nine wickets this World Cup, making him joint-third in the wicket-takers' list.

That brings Scott Edwards to the crease, the captain back at No. 6 after coming to bat a position lower against South Africa. Sybrand Engelbrecht will be in at No. 7 now instead.

Pitching it up has helped him so far, but this time it's with a short and wide delivery that he sniffs out the wicket. Colin Ackermann, who was looking good, saw the width and looked to slap it away and only managed a thin edge. This is the fifth time in 30 games that Rajitha has taken three wickets or more in a game. And only once has he taken four. Can he add to that today? Sensational opening spell though. Six overs on the trot so far

Associated Press

2023 has seen Bas de Leede at his very best in ODIs. He has, before today, scored 372 runs in 10 innings and averages 41.3, striking at 97 this year. This, compared to a career average and strike rate of 27.48 and 68.21. He scored a fine half-century to start off the World Cup but had a quiet couple of games to follow. But Netherlands will be hoping he can put on a big score today.

Max O'Dowd has looked tentative all day and he loses his wicket just at the end of the first powerplay. Kasun Rajitha has his second of the day after being drafted back into the XI. It's a pitched up delivery and O'Dowd drove away from the body, expecting some away movement, but it's straighter and he gets a thick inside edge onto the stumps.

Netherlands would have been very happy reaching the end of the tenth over at 48 for 1, but Sri Lanka reap the rewards for what has been a very disciplined bowling display on a pitch where the ball is also swinging a bit. Netherlands will still feel happy with the run rate, although they did enjoy some good fortune with a couple of boundaries.

The left-arm pacer started well against Australia with two maidens, including a double-wicket one. And he haas started with a maiden today. He is finding some swing and Vikramjit Singh can't put him away just yet. And he is beaten on the inside by one that's coming in with the angle.
