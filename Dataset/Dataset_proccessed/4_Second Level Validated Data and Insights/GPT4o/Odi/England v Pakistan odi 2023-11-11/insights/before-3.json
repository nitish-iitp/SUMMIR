        "New Zealand beating Sri Lanka comprehensively has made it almost clear that the Kiwis will be the fourth team to play in the semis of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are almost out of the race.",
        "Pakistan will face England in their last game on Saturday at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, and if they are looking to qualify for the semis, they need to win this game by a record margin of at least 275 runs.",
        "England have struggled in this tournament but are coming off a big win in the last game, and that is the same with Pakistan. So it will be a tight contest. But Pakistan will be under pressure to win it by big margin, and England will play freely. So we back England to win."

        "The weather on Saturday will be mostly sunny, with a maximum temperature of 32\u00b0C. The humidity level will be 57 percent with a moderate wind speed of 13 km/h.",
        "The pitch in Kolkata is on the slower side, but the ball moves around under light. Batting will not be easy, as seen in the IND-SA game. Spinners will come into play, and it will be a low-scoring thriller.",
        "Both teams have played a total of 91 matches so far. England are ahead with 56 wins, while Pakistan have won only 32 matches, and three games have ended without a result."
