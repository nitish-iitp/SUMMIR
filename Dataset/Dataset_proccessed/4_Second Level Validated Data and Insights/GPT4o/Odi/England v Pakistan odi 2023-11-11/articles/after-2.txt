It’s a wrap

Before the tournament began, not many would have picked England to be outside the final four.

However, the manner in which they failed to reach expectations will certainly be discussed and dissected over the next few weeks as the players prepare to return home.

Many would have wanted to see India play Pakistan in the semis when the Men in Green began to pick up momentum towards the tail-end of the tournament.

But once England won the toss and elected to bat, you could sense the deflation in body language as they failed to keep The Three Lions to a modest total, and never really fired with the bat in the chase.

We next cover the semifinals as India play New Zealand on November 15, while Australia do battle with South Africa on Nov 16.

Thank you for keeping us company today, and on behalf of Adam Hancock and Patrick Keddie, this is Rohan Sharma signing off.

‘Tournament hasn’t quite gone to plan’

Willey, for his three for 56, is adjudged the player of the match and had this to say, “The tournament hasn’t quite gone to plan as a whole, which is a big disappointment.”

“To be able to perform and enjoy my last few games, and get to 100 wickets as well, is a nice treat for me.”

‘It would have been nice to have that [100 ODI wickets] and make the final as well, but it wasn’t meant to be. When you look around the dressing room, we have a number of good players and we definitely underperformed here [in India].”

England win by 93 runs

After enduring a shocking run of losing six out of seven of their opening matches of the group stage, The Three Lions have come back strongly with convincing wins over the Netherlands, and now Pakistan.

With this result, they also secure passage into the 2025 Champions Trophy after finishing seventh in the standings.

The bowling was led by Willey’s three for 56, and was ably supported by Ali, Rashid and Atkinson who all pick up a brace of wickets.

Pakistan 244 all out. Rauf out!

Woakes is brought back to try and make the final breakthrough.

He succeeds shortly after as he entices Rauf with a full-pitched delivery which he goes after.

However, he ends up getting more elevation than distance as Stokes takes his third catch of the innings at long on to finally end the resistance.

43 overs. Pakistan 244-9

Rauf targets the mid-wicket region once more but ends up getting an inside edge and the ball travels behind to the fine leg boundary.

He is riding his luck out there as Willey switches tack to go round the wicket.

Rauf swings again and ends up getting another edge which flies to the third man boundary.

Wasim goes up and over the off side to find the rope at deep extra cover.

With that stroke, the 50-run partnership is brought up. Just ludicrous from these two.

42 overs. Pakistan 231-9

Rauf clobbers Atkinson’s first ball high over cow corner for six.

The Pakistan batsmen in the dugout must be wondering why they didn’t employ a similar tactic earlier in the innings?

Rauf, going for the big heave again, ends up top-edging a chance off the next ball, which goes right into the stratosphere.

Looks like the fielders are unable to spot it as the ball lands safely in the outfield.

This is quite the fight back from Pakistan after they threatened to be dismissed for a lot less earlier on.

41 overs. Pakistan 222-9

Wasim pulls handsomely over mid-wicket to find the boundary.

He attempts a scoop shot over fine leg off the fourth ball, with the ball hitting his pads.

The bowler goes up for leg before, but the umpire is unmoved.

England decide to review anyway.

Ball tracking confirms the ball was pitching outside leg, so England are out of reviews.

Wasim closes out the over with an audacious lofted shot straight down the ground which sails over the rope.

He even holds the pose for the cameras. Remarkable shot there by the lower-order batter.

40 overs. Pakistan 209-9

Rauf whacks the first ball from Atkinson over mid-wicket for a boundary.

He follows it up with a mighty hoick, which just flies over the boundary rider at deep square leg for half a dozen.

Rauf slams a big six over long-on to make it 16 off the over.

A little too late, but it does give the fans something to cheer about, given that the match is a bit of a foregone conclusion.

Willey continues to keep it tight as the tail-enders can only scrape two from the over.

Pakistan 191-9. Shaheen out!

Atkinson is brought on to replace Rashid.

Shaheen continues his aggressive ways by drilling the first ball through the covers for four.

The bowler pitches it up on the fourth ball and traps Shaheen leg before, with the umpire signalling it out.

Shaheen is unconvinced and reviews the decision.

Ultra Edge confirms no contact, and ball tracking shows the ball going on to hit the stumps.

It is the end of an entertaining cameo as the last man Rauf makes his way out to the middle.
