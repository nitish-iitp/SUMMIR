Dream11 Fantasy XI tips and guide for match 44, ICC Men’s ODI Cricket World Cup 2023 between ENG vs PAK to be played in Kolkata.

New Zealand beating Sri Lanka comprehensively has made it almost clear that the Kiwis will be the fourth team to play in the semis of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are almost out of the race. But nothing can be said.

Sometimes it looks impossible, but it happens. Well, Pakistan will face England in their last game on Saturday at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, and if they are looking to qualify for the semis, they need to win this game by a record margin of at least 275 runs.
