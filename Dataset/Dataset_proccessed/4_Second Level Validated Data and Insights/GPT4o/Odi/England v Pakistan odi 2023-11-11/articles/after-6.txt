England vs Pakistan Highlights: ENG vs PAK, Chasing a target of 338 runs, Pakistan kept losing their wickets in quick intervals. Pakistan were ALL OUT at 244 in 43.3 over and disqualified from World Cup semis' race. Catch LIVE updates here 
England vs Pakistan Highlights: England's Adil Rashid and captain Jos Butler celebrate the dismissal of Pakistan's Saud Shakeel during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup match between Pakistan and England in Kolkata, India, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Bikas Das) (AP)

England vs Pakistan Highlights: ENG vs PAK, Chasing a target of 238 runs, Pakistan lost wickets at quick intervals while playing against defending champions England at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 11 November and lost by 93 runs. With this defeat, Pakistan are now officially out of semi-finals race of World Cup, while England qualified for Champions Trophy tournament. 

Batting second Pakistan lost Abdullah Shafique (0), Fakhar Zaman (1), Babar Azam (38), Mohammad Rizwan (36), Saud Shakeel (29), Agha Salman (51), Iftikhar Ahmed (3), Shadab Khan (4), Shaheen Shah Afridi (25) and Haris Rauf (35) to English bowlers. Only Mohammad Wasim remained unbeaten at 16. The whole batting collapse at 244 in 43.3 overs.

For England, David Willey – playing his last ODI – took 3 wickets and completed 100 wickets in ODIs. Adil Rashid, Gus Atkinson and Moeen Ali took 2 wickets each, while Chris Woakes picked one wicket.

After this stunning victory, England have qualified for upcoming Champions Trophy.

Ben Stokes and Joe Root played in a 132-run partnership to power England to 337/9 runs after 50 overs. Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf clinched 3 wickets to restrict some runs from the English batters while Shaheen Afridi and Mohammad Wasim Jr. clinched 2 wickets each. 

Ben Stokes played wonderfully for England today before he was dismissed by a fiery delivery of Shaheen Afridi. England skipper Jos Buttler and Joe Root are on crease now as the defending champions look to finish with a high score against Pakistan to strengthen their chances of Champions Trophy 2025 qualification.  

Jonny Bairstow and Dawid Malan started well and provided England with an 82 run opening partnership. Spinner Iftikhar Ahmed ended the strong partnership as he clinched Dawid Malan's wicket and Joe Root is the new batter on crease. 

The stage is set for a ‘do or die’ clash for Babar Azam-led Pakistan as the team faces defending champions England. Pakistan's semi-final dream is still possible, but practically they need a near-impossible victory against England to make that possibility a reality. Skipper Babar Azam sounded optimistic in the pre-match press conference, but the figures are just crazy. The ENG vs PAK ICC World Cup clash will finalize the top 4 teams, who will move to the knockout stages on 15th and 16th November. 

Pakistan needs to defeat England by 287 runs while batting first or 284 balls to spare while chasing in order to think about the semi-finals. Now, this makes it clear that in case Babar Azam manages to win the toss, he has to opt for batting and should target a 400+ score in England to even think about winning today's match.

Jos Buttler-led England has been a disaster in the ICC World Cup 2020, but in their previous match against the Netherlands, the team has shown the potential of defending champions and will definitely make Pakistan's job more difficult as their Champions Trophy 2025 qualifications depend on today's victory.

But, when it comes to the ICC World Cup, the Pakistan cricket team has some edge with a 5-4 record against England. In their last World Cup match, Pakistan defeated England by 14 runs.
