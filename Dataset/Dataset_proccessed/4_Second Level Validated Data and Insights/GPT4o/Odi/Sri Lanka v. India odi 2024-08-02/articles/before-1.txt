The anticipation builds for the ODI series between Sri Lanka and India at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on August 2, 2024. Fans eagerly await the team’s final decision on the wicketkeeper-batters between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant, confident that either choice will significantly bolster India’s performance.

Rohit Sharma addresses the wicketkeeping problem

During a candid interview before the commencement of the ODI series between Sri Lanka and India, Indian captain Rohit Sharma addressed the ongoing dilemma within the wicket-keeping department. He confirmed that the team would field only one wicketkeeper-batter for the series but refrained from disclosing who would be in the final XI for the first ODI.

Rohit referred to the situation as a “happy problem,” emphasising the strength both candidates bring to the team.

“It is difficult to choose between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant. Both are match-winners in their own way, but it is a happy problem. I want to have that kind of problem; we will decide tomorrow,” Rohit remarked during the interview.

Comparative form of Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul ahead of ODI Series 

Pant has not played an ODI for some time due to an unfortunate car accident, with his last appearance in the format dating back to November 2022 against New Zealand. However, Pant made a notable comeback as the primary wicketkeeper in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 and also participated in the IPL 2024 edition.

On the other hand, Rahul has showcased exceptional form in recent ODI matches. During the ODI World Cup 2023, Rahul amassed an impressive 452 runs in 11 matches, including one century and two half-centuries, boasting a strike rate of 90.76 and an average of 75.33.
