Match Preview:

In a crucial ICC ODI World Cup 2023 encounter, Bangladesh will lock horns against Pakistan at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Both teams enter this fixture after suffering heart-breaking defeats in the previous games. Pakistan lost by one wicket to South Africa while the Bangla Tigers were on the receiving end of a thumping 87-run defeat.

Pitch Report:

The Eden Gardens in Kolkata has produced a balanced with an average score of 236 runs. The batters have scored a lot of runs, thanks to the ground’s short dimensions. Similarly, fast bowlers can come into play early as the new ball tends to gain some movement. Similarly, spinners also love playing at Eden Gardens as the ball often finds a lot of turn and grip off the pitch.

Team Analysis:

Pakistan

After a few thumping losses, Pakistan nearly got back to winning ways against South Africa but fell short in the end. The Pakistani batting has failed to make a mark in the tournament with players struggling to bat for longer periods and scoring consistently. On the contrary, Pakistani bowling has gradually improved with the pacers seeming in rhythm while the spinners still struggling to make any headway.

Bangladesh


Whereas Shakib Al Hasan-led Bangladesh has emerged as one of the biggest letdowns of the tournament with consecutive poor performances. The batting has been a massive disappointment with the top order not being able to find runs across any fixture. These poor performances have put extra pressure and responsibility on the bowling unit, which similarly, hasn’t played well.
