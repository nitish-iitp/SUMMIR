Goodbye from Kolkata

So Pakistan are back to winning ways and up to fifth but having played a game more than those around them.

They sit two points outside the qualification places while the three teams below them are still in the hunt.

A sixth straight defeat confirms Bangladesh go out.

Join the Al Jazeera live blog again tomorrow when we are back with New Zealand against South Africa in Pune.

We hope you enjoyed today’s coverage.

For now from Hafsa Adil and myself, Kevin Hand, it’s goodbye.

Babar focused on the next two games

Pakistan captain Babar Azam’s side ended their four-match losing streak with the win.

It keeps alive their chances of progressing to the semifinals.

“All credit to the boys and the way we are playing,” said Azam.

“We know when Fakhar is playing, its a different ball game. So he played his natural game and all the pressure is on their team. Good to see him.

“We are trying to win the next two matches and let’s see where we stand. We will try to add those wins and confidences in the next few matches.

“We started well, the way Shaheen started by taking wickets, it took them 15 or 20 overs to build a partnership and we recalled our main bowlers and they took more wickets.

“All bowlers are trying to give us one hundred percent.”

Shakib rues more early wickets

Bangladesh captain Shakib al-Hasan was one of three batters to get a solid start but didn’t go on.

“The wicket was really good and we lost wickets again early on,” he said.

“From there on there was some partnership but not a big enough one that we could go hard in the last ten overs.

“So disappointing with the bat but I think we should have bowled better.

“Credit to Pakistan – the way they bowled and batted in the first 10 overs.

“At this moment, we have to perform together. It’s not an individual that can win us a game.

“There’s two more matches and hopefully, we can bounce back.”

Fakhar is the Player of the Match

Fakhar Zaman returned to the side and top-scored with 81.

“I practised a lot and was feeling good in the camp and was looking forward to scoring runs for the team,” he said.

“I know I worked hard for this and it paid off.

“I was talking to Abdullah: ‘I will see off the first four overs and it doesn’t matter how the wicket plays – I know I can hit sixes’.

“I know my role is to make it easy for my partner and today, I was just looking to see off the first four overs and go after the ball.

“After 100 runs, we were just looking to finish the game inside 30 overs.”

A sorry six in a row for Bangladesh

The losing streak continues.

Miraz a highlight with three wickets but Mahmudullah fell just after his fifty, while Das and Shakib fell in the 40s.

Those wickets were so costly.
