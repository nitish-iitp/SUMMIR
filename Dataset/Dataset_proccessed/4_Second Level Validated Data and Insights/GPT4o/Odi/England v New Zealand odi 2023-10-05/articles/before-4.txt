The 2023 Cricket World Cup kicks off with England against New Zealand, a fixture that is a repeat of the 2019 final.

England recorded one of the most famous victories in the history of the sport four years ago, winning the World Cup on boundary count after the 50 over match and Super Over that followed were both tied.

The defending champions enter this fixture as favourites. The two sides completed a four-match ODI series less than a month ago, which England won 3-1.

For the tournament opener, New Zealand will be missing their talismanic captain Kane Williamson, who continues to recover from a knee injury, and their lead bowler Tim Southee is also a doubt having undergone surgery on a fractured thumb.

England, on the other hand, enter the fixture with a full bill of health and all six of their seam bowlers to choose from, presenting head coach Matthew Mott with the only real selection dilemma entering the first match.

England v New Zealand key player to watch
Joe Root (England)

England’s top run scorer in the 2019 World Cup win, Joe Root, enters the 2023 tournament a man out of form after scores of six, zero, four and 29 in an out-of-character display against New Zealand in the most recent series.

Root is the player that makes England tick. If he does well, so does the team. And if he doesn’t do well, England will find themselves in uncharted territory.
