        "New Zealand\u2019s Tom Latham: 'Not our best performance, at the half way mark it was a big score but a decent surface. We weren\u2019t able to build partnerships, disappointing.'",
        "South Africa\u2019s Temba Bavuma: 'I think Quinnie and I tried to assess the wicket, I was able to get a couple away, Quinnie tried to get a couple away, but hung in there and cashed in at the end\u2026.in terms of the bowlers, look to be clinical, dominate the power play, the middle order, we knew they would come at us and be ready for opportunities. I think it is important we acknowledge that we have made the semi-finals and move on.'",
        "The player of the match is Rassie van der Dussen: 'If you hold a good length there is something in it for the bowlers, and we communicated that back to our bowlers. They did well to keep a lid on us for much of the innings but we knew if we could keep it deep we could keep momentum on our side. Miller and guys at the back did brilliantly, it wasn\u2019t easy.'"
