Quintion de Kock alone has hit 4 centuries in the tournament
South Africa have also broken the record of most sixes hit in a single edition

South Africa once again put in a dominating show while batting first in the ODI World Cup 2023 match against New Zealand. Playing at the Maharashtra Cricket Association in Pune, South Africa destroyed the New Zealand bowling attack, with two stunning centuries from Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen.

This took South Africa's tally of centuries to 8, joint highest in the history of the tournament, as they equalled Sri Lanka from the 2015 edition of the ODI World Cup. South Africa batters have been in stunning form in India, and apart from the blip against the Netherlands, have generally put in some terrific performances.

De Kock's 103-ball century laid the stone for South Africa to notch up yet another 300+ total while batting first in the World Cup 2023. Apart from de Kock, Rassies van der Dussen also brought up his second century in the tournament, hitting his century off 101 balls.

Apart from de Kock and van der Dussen's combined 6 centuries, South Africa have seen two terrific hundreds from Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen. Markram's record century came against Sri Lanka in just 49 balls - which at the time was the fastest by any batter in the World Cup. His record, however, was later surpassed by Glenn Maxwell, with a 40-ball century against the Netherlands.

Heinrich Klaasen's rapid century came against England on October 21 at the Wankhede Stadium. Playing against the defending champions, Klaasen took his time but then launched into a tremendous hitting spree completing his 109-run innings in just 67 balls.

8 centuries would have meant that there has been some big hitting from the South African batting department. South Africa now have broken the record of most sixes hit by a team in a single edition of the tournament. David Miller, batting in the 46th over of the innings, hit two back to back sixes off Glenn Phillips to cross 76 sixes - a record held by England in the 2019 edition of the tournament.

The Temba Bavuma side, in the end, finished their innings with 357 runs for the loss of 4 wickets - their fourth 350+ total in the tournament.
