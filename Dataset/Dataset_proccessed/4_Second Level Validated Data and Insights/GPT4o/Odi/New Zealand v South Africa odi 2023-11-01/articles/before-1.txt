South Africa play New Zealand in Kolkata, with a win for South Africa all but securing their place in the semi-finals.

New Zealand are facing the possibility of a third defeat in a row having won their first four matches. A New Zealand collapse is the only route that still possibly exists for England to sneak into the semi-finals.

If the Kiwis lose all three of their remaining matches, combined with England winning all three of theirs, then England will have a shot at the semi-finals.

South Africa, on the other hand, have been the most entertaining team on display alongside India. An explosive batting unit is combined with five bowlers and no room for part-timers in either discipline.

Quinton de Kock, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller are world class six-hitters, but questions linger over whether their side is as well-suited when asked to chase after they lost to the Netherlands and snuck home by one wicket against Pakistan.

New Zealand v South Africa key player to watch
Glenn Phillips (New Zealand)

An explosive batter, Phillips has been just as crucial with the ball this competition, and contributed with career best figures of 3-37 against Australia when everyone else around him was flying to the boundary.

South Africa’s batting line-up has been so powerful this tournament, Phillips is likely to be needed with both bat and ball if New Zealand are going to secure a win.
