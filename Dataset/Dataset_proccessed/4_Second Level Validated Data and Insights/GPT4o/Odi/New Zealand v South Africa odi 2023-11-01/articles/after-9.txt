A bit of a damp end to a much-anticipated match. South Africa were superb, with bat and ball, and swoop top of the table. New Zealand drop to fourth, two points above Pakistan, and Afghanistan (who have played a game fewer), and are now in the danger zone.

That’s it from me for today, India play Sri Lanka tomorrow in Mumbai, Netherlands v Afghanistan on Friday, and then super Saturday: Pakistan v New Zealand in Bangalore, and England v Australia in Ahmedabad. Thanks for all your messages – bye!

Time for the captains:

New Zealand’s Tom Latham, “Not our best performance, at the half way mark it was a big score but a decent surface. We weren’t able to build partnerships, disappointing.” Says he would have made the same decision at the toss if he could chose again, “they put some pressure on us, but it was a small ground, decent surface. 330-340 would have been chaseable, but we weren’t able to build partnerships with the bat.

“I guess it is important we reflect on this one quickly, we don’t become a bad team overnight.”

South Africa’s Temba Bavuma, “I think Quinnie and I tried to assess the wicket, I was able to get a couple away, Quinnie tried to get a couple away, but hung in there and cashed in at the end….in terms of the bowlers, look to be clinical, dominate the power play, the middle order, we knew they would come at us and be ready for opportunities. I think it is important we acknowledge that we have made the semi-finals* and move on.”

I don’t think South Africa have actually sealed a semi-final spot mathematically, but realistically they are there.

The once sitting pretty New Zealand have now lost three in three, which leaves them in unexpected deep water with two games to go. They play Pakistan on Saturday – now a huge game – before Sri Lanka a week on Thursday. Pakistan and Afghanistan both now in with a shot. Afghanistan line up against the Netherlands at Lucknow on Friday.

The player of the match is Rassie van der Dussen. Who is handed the microphone as he adopts the power stance we are told to do in the toilet before an interview.

“If you hold a good length there is something in it for the bowlers, he says, “and we communicated that back to our bowlers. They did well to keep a lid on us for much of the innings but we knew if we could keep it deep we could keep momentum on our side. Miller and guys at the back did brilliantly, it wasn’t easy.”

WICKET! Phillips c Rabada b Coetzee 60 (New Zealand 167 all out) South Africa win by 190 runs

A hit too far! Phillips, who has just smashed Coetzee for another six, goes again, but this time straight to mid on. King , Queen, Jack.

Fifty for Glenn Phillips!

35th over: New Zealand 161-9 (Phillips 54, Henry 0) Phillips, after taking a look at Henry limp up the pitch, decides to get stuck in. He fillets Maharaj through the covers for four, pick-up-sticks him up for six next ball into the crowd, and four more, over extra cover – for his fifty off just 46 balls. The crowd roar in appreciation as Henry survives the last two balls.

34th over: New Zealand 146-9 (Phillips 39, Henry 0) Coetzee returns. Phillips picks up his four with a muscled pull. Gets his single off the last ball, Henry “running” like a man in paper trousers.

33rd over: New Zealand 140-9 (Phillips 34, Henry 0) Phillips is after boundaries, not running for singles. And that’s his baby, sweeping Maharaj 73 metres into the stands. Henry survives his one ball from Maharaj – who has the look of a youthful Rahul Dravid.

31st over: New Zealand 133-9 (Phillips 26, Henry 0) Henry, he of the newly dodgy right hamstring, comes in. He manages to defend Maharaj’s remaining four balls away. New Zealand, as well as about to lose today, as well as about to lose three games on the trot – now have injury worries to Henry, Southee, Williamson, Chapman and Ferguson

WICKET! Boult c Miller b Maharaj 9 (New Zealand 133-9)

Boult goes for broke, hitting high – but not long enough, and Miller doesn’t drop those. A fourth for the super Maharaj.

30th over: New Zealand 132-8 (Phillips 25, Boult 9) A free hit! Jansen is not impressed. I’ve seen that expression before, when I suggest that people should load the dishwasher before going out. It’s a wide yorker that Boult can only dribble away.

28th over: New Zealand 128-8 (Phillips 23, Boult 8) Phillips and Boult taking a leaf out of the Mark Wood handbook. Phillips tonks Maharaj for six. Boult produces the leave of a tournament, squatting down gracefully with a grin.

27th over: New Zealand 119-8 (Phillips 15, Boult 7) I take that back, Henry is now visible in the dugout, helmeted and ready to go. Boult dinks Jansen into the rope, and replays it with a little twist of the wrist.

“Tanya,” John Starbuck. “You must have had an ignoble childhood to remember someone (an adult?) mean enough to use an Opal Fruit as a pass the parcel prize. Which cricket team would do that?” No, no, the Opal Fruit is in between each layer of paper – a sop to the dear little children who don’t win the main prize (packet of felt tip pens etc).

WICKET! Neesham b Maharaj 0 (New Zealand 111-8)

Ball of the World Cup? Maharaj fizzes one, with a twist of the wrist, into the pitch where it does a double twisting Yurchenko into Neesham’s leg stump The injured Matt Henry won’t bat, so South Africa need only one more wicket.

26th over: New Zealand 109-7 (Phillips 12, Neesham 0) Jansen on a hat-trick – now the World Cup’s joint leading wicket taker with Adam Zampa. Neesham survives the hat-trick and an lbw review. A truculent Jansen sends one past his nose in his disappointment. Wicket maiden.


”I’ve just walked in from work and checked the score,” writes Jeremy Boyce. “Saffas as per in their innings, but what has happened to the Kiwi batters ? Did they suddenly “naturalise” as Englishmen in some kind of strange reverse ferret ?” Colonialism never stops giving.

WICKET! Southee lbw Jansen 7 (New Zealand 109-7)

Very full, very straight. Southee tries to whip it away, misses and is hit on the left ankle. He reviews – why not at this stage – but the technology sends him on his way.

25th over: New Zealand 109-6 (Phillips 12, Southee 7) Southee survives a slog-sweep into the night. At this stage South Africa were 121-1 – so not much in it runs wise, the wickets column proving the more pressing concern.

24th over: New Zealand 106-6 (Phillips 11, Southee 5) Small prizes for New Zealand at this stage, like an opal fruit in a layer of pass the parcel. Southee picks up four from a swipe off Ngidi through midwicket, fumbled on the rope.

23rd over: New Zealand 100-6 (Phillips 10, Southee 0) Crumbling Black Caps. Santner had made room the ball before to drive Maharaj for four, but done by the turn this time. And Southee is the next man in – not Neesham.

22nd over: New Zealand 95-5 (Phillips 9, Santner 3) Accuracy from Ngidi, golden forearm guards, lime green boots. Only five runs from the last four overs as New Zealand relay the foundations.

19th over: New Zealand 91-5 (Phillips 7, Santner 1) Mitchell only gives himself a couple of balls before attempting to tuck into Maharaj’s loopy tempter – will New Zealand now play the net run rate game?

Hmmm, the general OBO’s attitude to Matt Hancock can be summed up Marcus Abdullahi. “ I’d quite like to see Hancock facing Marshall, Thomson, Patterson and Roberts - ideally on the 1998 Jamaica test pitch and ideally wearing dodgy protective equipment provided by one of his cronies’ dodgy firms.”

WICKET! Mitchell c Miller b Maharaj 24(New Zealand 90-5)

Immediate reward for Maharaj, as Mitchell quick steps down the pitch, hits him high, high, and into the hands of Miller who catches on the leap with both hands above his head.

18th over: New Zealand 90-4 (Mitchell 24, Phillips 7) Phillips covers drives for four, then superb by Rabada, probe after probe. South Africa review a slip catch at the very last minute – but no bat involved.

15.20 CET

17th over: New Zealand 84-4 (Mitchell 24, Phillips 1) A curiously profligate over from Coetzee – who bowls four wides which de Kock stands and watches as it soars wide and high to the rope. Two stand and deliver fours from Mitchell. Fifteen from the over.

A brutal summing up by Krishnamoorthy V:

“South Africa tends to choke regularly in crucial moments. New Zealand is known to be unlucky. India will bottle up that one important match and cry like babies. That leaves Australia the favorites to win this edition.”

Oh dear, all looking a bit sticky for New Zealand now, as Latham pushes hopefully and can only loop the ball to a gracious cover.

15th over: New Zealand 67-3 (Mitchell 13, Latham 4) Coetzee, headband, bustles/muscles in. Runs still hard to come by. Kane Williamson, sidelined by that thumb injury, picks up his bag and prepares to leave the dugout. The noises are that he will probably be fit for what, if New Zealand lose today, looks like being a humdinger of a game against Pakistan.

15.01 CET

14th over: New Zealand 64-3 (Mitchell 12, Latham 1) A sensational stat from the television: captains winning the toss in this tournament have won just 9 out of 31 games – Jos Buttler you are in good company. Tom Latham’s decision to field first today looks like making this stat even more stark. Just two from Rabada’s over.
