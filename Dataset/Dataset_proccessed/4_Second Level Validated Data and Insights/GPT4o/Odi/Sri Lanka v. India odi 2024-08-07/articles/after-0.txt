India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: What Rohit Sharma said at post presentation

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Indian skipper Rohit Sharma said at post presentation, as quoted by Cricbuzz, "I don't think it is a concern. But it is something we have to look at indivdually and as a game plan. It is a joke. When you are playing for India there is never going to be complacency. When I am captain there is no chance of complacency. But you have to give credit to good cricket. Sri Lanka played better than us."

He added, “We looked at the conditions and went with the combinations, there also guys who need to be looked at and hence the changes. There are lot of areas we need to look at rather than the positives. These things happen, series lost is not the end of the world, you will lose an odd series here and there but it is about how you come back after the loss."
