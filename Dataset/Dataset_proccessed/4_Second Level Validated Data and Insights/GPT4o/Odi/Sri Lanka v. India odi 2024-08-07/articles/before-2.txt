Preview


In the third ODI of the three-match series, Sri Lanka will go up against India at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Sri Lanka have a 1-0 lead in the series currently after registering a famous win in the second ODI with the help of their bowlers, following the tied first match. For India, their batting unit has performed way below par in the series, failing to chase down par totals in two consecutive ODIs.

Pitch Report

The pitches at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo for the first two ODIs have provided a lot of assistance to the spin bowlers, making the job of the batters quite difficult in the middle overs. With that, the average first inning score of 226 in ODI cricket at this venue could end up being very difficult to chase down for either Sri Lanka or India in the series decider.

Team Analysis

Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka have managed to put par totals on the board in both ODIs with some reasonable contributions from most of their batters, with Dunith Wellalage providing the late impetus to both their innings. The spin bowling attack of Sri Lanka has been too hot to handle for India, with the likes of Jeffrey Vandersay, Dunith Wellalage, the captain Charith Asalanka, and Akila Dananjaya picking up the bulk of the wickets.

Sri Lanka squad for ODI Series

Charith Asalanka (c), Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Kamindu Mendis, Janith Liyanage, Nishan Madushka, Dunith Wellalage, Chamika Karunaratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Akila Dananjaya, Asitha Fernando, Eshan Malinga, Mohamed Shiraz, Jeffrey Vandersay

India

The India batting lineup has struggled massively except for the captain Rohit Sharma, in the first two ODIs of the series against some crafty spin bowling from the Sri Lankans. The bowlers have done their job well for India whether it’s the spinners or pacers, but the lack of support from the batters has proven to be a downfall for the team in the series thus far.

India squad for ODI Series

Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd. Siraj, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Riyan Parag, Axar Patel, Khaleel Ahmed, Harshit Rana

Match Prediction




Conclusion

India have performed way below par with the bat in the ODI series, but their highly recognised batting lineup still have one more opportunity to make amends versus the Sri Lankan spin bowling attack.
