Preview

Sri Lanka will compete against India in the third and final ODI of the three-match series at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Following the first ODI ending in a tie, Sri Lanka picked up a huge win over India in the second one with an inspiring performance from their bowling unit, to ensure that they don’t lose the series. As far as the Indian cricket team are concerned, their highly recognised batting lineup faltered in tough conditions twice in the series, which they can’t afford to replicate in the third ODI.

Analysis

In the first two ODIs of the series, the Sri Lankan batting lineup managed to get up to par totals on the back of some impressive performances from the lower order, especially Dunith Wellalage. In the bowling side of things, Jeffrey Vandersay picked up a six-wicket haul on his return to Sri Lankan playing XI in the second ODI, while the rest of the spin bowlers, including names like Dunith Wellalage, the captain Charith Asalanka, and Akila Dananjaya have played their part as well.

Meanwhile, the Indian batting lineup has batted quite poorly as a unit in the first two ODIs of the series except for the captain Rohit Sharma, who scored two quick-fire fifties in a row on difficult pitches. The bowling attack of India has done its job reasonably well in the ODI series, with the pacers and spinners sharing the wickets amongst themselves in equal measure.
