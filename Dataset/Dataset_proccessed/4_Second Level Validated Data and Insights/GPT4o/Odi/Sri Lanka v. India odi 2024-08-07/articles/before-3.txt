South Africa v India: Final - ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup West Indies & USA 2024 - Source: Getty

India and Sri Lanka are set to lock horns in the third and final match of the three-match ODI series on Wednesday, August 7. The R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo will host the clash.

India, led by Rohit Sharma, have not had the best of times in the series thus far. In both matches, the Men in Blue had the chance to secure wins, but the visitors failed to secure victory.

Indian batting suffered collapses both times despite Rohit Sharma give them flying starts. On Sunday, India went 1-0 down in the series after losing by 32 runs. After being asked to chase down a target of 240, India were bowled out for 208 in 42.2 overs.

Rohit Sharma scored 64 runs in a massive 97-run opening stand with Shubman Gill. But once Jeffrey Vandersay dismissed Rohit, the India crumbled and failed to go past the finish line.

Vandersay was the pick of the bowlers for Sri Lanka after he picked up six wickets. India, in the meantime, are still looking for their 100th ODI won against the Islanders.
