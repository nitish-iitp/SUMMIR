10.25pm Pakistan gun down 345 - the highest successful chase ever in a World Cup - to win back-to-back games. Sri Lanka suffer their second successive defeat in this tournament. Shaheen and Rauf lift Rizwan. Babar hugs Rizwan. Emotional scenes in the Pakistan camp. Rizwan batted cramps and SL's attack on his way to a career-best 131*. Shafique, who was picked in place of Fakhar, announced himself with a career-best effort of his own. He had played just eight List A games before today, but he stepped up along with Rizwan to turn the tables on Sri Lanka. That's all we have for you from today's game. Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Madushka Balasuriya.

Rizwan, Player of the Match: Always proud when you perform like that. It was difficult and when you chase like that, it's always special. Every player in the dressing room had the belief we can chase that. Basically, it's a good track and we decided to calculate the innings. Sometimes cramps, sometimes acting (laughs).

Shanaka: Mendis is in form at the moment and is in the zone. Also Sadeera has been playing very well in the recent well, but we should've finished stronger in the end. Of course, I thought with the way the wicket behaved, we were 20-25 runs short. Credit to them, they bowled very good slower balls. I can't ask too much from the bowlers. I have given simple plans and coaching staff as well, but we gave too much extras. The only way is to encourage them. Unfortunately, we missed our chances.

Babar: I think Rizwan, the way he played... He built the partnership and put pressure on the Sri Lanka team. We finished well with our fast bowlers. First World Cup for Shafique and he is in good nick and I decided to play him. I think the way Rizwan and him played they helped us with the partnership. Good for us, the middle order has stepped up and just believe in ourselves.
