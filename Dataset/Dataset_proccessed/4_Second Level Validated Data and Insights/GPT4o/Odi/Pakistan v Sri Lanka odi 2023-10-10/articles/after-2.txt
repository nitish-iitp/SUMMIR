Pakistan recorded the highest successful run chase in Cricket World Cup history as they beat Sri Lanka by six wickets.

Centuries from Kusal Mendis (122) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (108) helped Sri Lanka set a total of 344 for nine. But Pakistan’s Abdullah Shafique (113) and Mohammad Rizwan (131 not out) hit centuries of their own to give their side a second successive victory in the tournament.

The Sri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka hit 51 off 61 deliveries, which made up for a duck by his partner, Kusal Perera. Nissanka’s quickfire half-century set the tone for a magnificent effort from Sri Lanka, hitting seven fours and a six in the process.

The wicketkeeper Mendis and the No 4, Samarawickrama, were also in blistering form, the former reaching his hundred from just 65 balls in an innings that contained 14 fours and six sixes. Sarmarawickrama reached his milestone from 82 balls, and Sri Lanka eventually got to 344, with Hasan Ali claiming four wickets.

The Pakistan fightback started through Shafique. The 113 runs he managed off 103 balls gave his side the momentum they needed facing such a big total.

Dilshan Madushanka aimed to disrupt proceedings when he dismissed Imam-ul-Haq and the skipper, Babar Azam, early on before Rizwan’s performance put his side in the ascendancy.
