Mohammad Rizwan and opening batter Abdullah Shafique have led Pakistan to a record run chase in a six-wicket win over Sri Lanka at the Cricket World Cup.

Chasing a target of 345, Rizwan played with a pulled right calf and scored an unbeaten 131 off 121 balls, while Shafique, replacing out-of-form Fakhar Zaman, scored 113 to help Pakistan reach 345-4 with 10 balls to spare. 

Their twin tons overshadowed the effort of Sri Lanka's Kusal Mendis (122 off 77) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (108 off 89), who both notched their maiden ODI centuries to push Sri Lanka's total to 344-9 on a day when bowlers got walloped from both sides on a perfect batting pitch.

Pakistan's big chase surpassed Ireland's previous Cricket World Cup record , in which it made 7-329 to beat England in 2011.

Pakistan stretched its World Cup record against Sri Lanka to 8-0 and has four points from two victories. Pakistan has beaten both the qualifiers — the Netherlands and Sri Lanka — going into the marquee game against rival India in Ahmedabad on Saturday.

"Always proud when you perform like that," Rizwan said after a knock that featured eight fours and three sixes.

"It was difficult and when you chase like that, it's always special. Every player in the dressing room had the belief we can chase that."

Everything you need to know for the Cricket World Cup

The 50-over one-day Cricket World Cup is taking place in India, with Australia looking to add to its record five titles. Here's everything you need to know about the tournament.

Sri Lanka has had plenty of bowling problems at the World Cup in the absence of injured star leg spinner Wanindu Hasaranga.

The team also lost its opening game against South Africa, which scored 428 runs against the Sri Lankans.

Mendis and Samarawickrama showed plenty of aggression in the middle overs with a 111-run third-wicket stand off 69 balls, hitting 25 fours and eight sixes in between them.

But captain Dasun Shanaka said the team "should have finished stronger", which might have secured its first win of the World Cup.

"The way the wicket behaved, we were 20-25 runs short. … I can't ask too much from the bowlers," he said.

In the earlier game in Dharamsala, Dawid Malan's century set up England's first win when it beat Bangladesh by 137 runs.

Malan scored 140 off 107 balls — his fifth ODI ton — as England reached 9-364 to bounce back from losing to New Zealand in the tournament opener.

Left-arm pacer Reece Topley returned figures of 4-43 as England bowled out Bangladesh for 227 in 48.2 overs.

It was England's fourth-biggest win by runs in World Cup history and they did it without 2019 World Cup hero Ben Stokes.

England's Test captain made headlines when he announced he was coming out of limited-overs retirement for the World Cup but has missed the first two games over injury concerns.

Put in to bat, England made a strong start as Malan and Jonny Bairstow (52) shared 115 runs for the first wicket. Shakib al-Hasan bowled Bairstow, but Malan and Joe Root added 151 runs for the second wicket.

Malan hit 16 fours and five sixes overall, and reached his hundred off 91 balls. After the landmark, he cut loose to score 40 off only 16 balls, hitting four fours and three sixes.

"It was fantastic to put in a performance like this and win a game (for the team). Hopefully my form will continue ahead," Malan said.

"With Root at three, it allows us to play freely. I am desperate to do well in this format and prove a point."

Root also scored quickly, reaching 50 off 44 balls. Overall, he hit 82 off 68 balls, including eight fours and a six, as he continues to rediscover his form.

England lost its way a bit in the last phase of the innings. After Malan's dismissal, the English went from 296-2 to 307-5, losing Root and Jos Buttler (20).

Liam Livingstone, who has a good IPL record at the stadium, was bowled for a golden duck. Harry Brook (20) guided the score past 350 along with the lower middle-order.

Topley then destroyed Bangladesh's chase with the new ball. He sent back Tanzid Hasan for 1, and then Najmul Hossain Shanto was caught for a golden duck in the second over.

Four overs later, Topley bowled Shakib for 1, and Chris Woakes had Mehidy Hasan Miraz caught behind for 8 as Bangladesh struggled at 4-49 in 8.3 overs.

The game was effectively already over, even as Litton Das top-scored with 76, putting on 72 runs with Mushfiqur Rahim to help stabilise the innings.

Rahim scored 51 runs, but there were not any lower-order heroics to jeopardise England's win.

England and Bangladesh, which beat Afghanistan in its opener, both have two points after two games.
