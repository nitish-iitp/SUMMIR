    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'I have played a lot of cricket here so I know with any score on this ground you cannot relax. Get the job done as quickly as possible and stay at. We knew there would be pressure on us at some stage, a partnership. We just had to stay collected. That's what we did. We were very calm even though we were sloppy in the field. That can happen.'",
        "New Zealand captain Kane Williamson: 'Firstly, congratulations to India. They've played outstandingly well throughout this competition and perhaps played their best game of the competition today. They're a top side at the top of their game. so at the halfway stage, with 400 on the board, it was naturally going to be tough.'",
        "Player of the match Mohammed Shami: 'I was waiting for my chances. I didn't play a lot of white-ball cricket. My return started against New Zealand in the group stage. We talk a lot of variations, but I still believe in pitching it up and getting wickets with the new ball.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "India will face either Australia or South Africa in Sunday's final",
        "For New Zealand, it's another missed opportunity. They played some fantastic cricket - demolishing England in the opener, the agonising five-run defeat by Australia, and pushing India more than any other team has managed in this semi-final and their group stage encounter.",
        "Injuries have played a big part in their campaign, losing Williamson for a few matches before seamer Matt Henry was ruled out. It feels like the end of an era for many players in a wonderful group that have constantly punched above their weight.",
        "But they have also unearthed a star in Rachin Ravindra, who scored three centuries in the tournament and I suspect we will be watching him score many more in the years to come."
