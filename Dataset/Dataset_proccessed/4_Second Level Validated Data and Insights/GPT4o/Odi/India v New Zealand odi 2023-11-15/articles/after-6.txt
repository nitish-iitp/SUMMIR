India and New Zealand will face each other in the semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 today, November 15. The match will be played at the iconic Wankhede stadium in Mumbai.

The Rohit Sharma-led side cruised through the group stage, finishing top on a maximum 18 points having won all nine of their matches. Kane Williamson-led New Zealand were the final team to qualify for the knockout stage, with a win over Sri Lanka and Pakistan's subsequent loss to England earning the Kiwis fourth spot.

Ahead of the India vs New Zealand semi-final, here's a look at how India has performed in the ODI World Cup semi-finals played so far:

The Indian team has played in seven World Cup semi-finals so far and won three of them.

1987: In the 1987 World Cup semi-final, India faced England again. This time, England registered a win by 35 runs.

1996: India and Sri Lanka had faced each other in the 1996 World Cup semi-final. Sri Lanka was awarded the match because of raucous and unruly crowd in the stadium at Eden Gardens, Kolkata.

2003: India defeated Kenya by 91 runs.

2011: In the 2011 World Cup semi-final, India met its arch rival Pakistan and defeated the team by 29 runs.

2015: India lost against Australia by 95 runs in the second semi-final of the ODI World Cup 2015.

2019: India faced New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup semi-final and in that match, the Kiwis managed to get better of India by 18 runs.
