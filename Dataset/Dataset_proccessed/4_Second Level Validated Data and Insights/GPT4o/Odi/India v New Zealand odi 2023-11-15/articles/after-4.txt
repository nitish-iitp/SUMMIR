‘It was important to stay calm’

India’s victorious captain Rohit Sharma has been speaking to the media after the match.

“I know with any score on this ground, you cannot relax. You’ve got to get the job done as quickly as possible and stay at it,” he said.

“We knew there would be pressure on us and some partnerships, but you have to stay collected.”

Sharma touched on the tension in the air in Mumbai, with New Zealand threatening a huge upset.

“Mitchell and Williamson batted brilliantly, and for us, it was important to stay calm,” he said.

“At one point the crowd went absolutely silent, but that is the nature of the game. We knew we had to pull something out”.

‘This was one chance we were not going to let go’

Seven-wicket hero Shami has been reflecting on his magnificent performance in Mumbai.

“I was waiting for my chance and tried to keep things simple,” he said. “There’s a lot of focus on variation, but I believe in the old adage of getting the ball up. I was a little disappointed that there was a catch dropped. But fortunately, the slower ball was working and I was very happy to get that wicket [of Williamson]”.

He also discussed how he was feeling when New Zealand were really starting to come into the game during that Williamson-Mitchell partnership.

“We have come very close in the past, but this one chance we were not going to let go. Who knows when the next chance might come?”

The end of the road for New Zealand

New Zealand made the final of this competition four years ago, but they can’t repeat that feat this time around.

They were always facing an uphill task chasing 398, but credit must go to Williamson and Mitchell, who made India sweat with a massive partnership.

In the end, Shami proved too much for the Black Caps batsmen, but they can head home with their heads held high.

Congratulations India. Good luck in the Final. Thank you to everyone who has supported the team during the@cricketworldcup near and far! Scorecard | https://t.co/Xc6jdcfX9H #CWC23 pic.twitter.com/cBOdq94bzF

Shami’s magnificent seven

Shami was simply sensational in that innings.

He picked up two wickets in the first 10 overs and then grabbed some crucial wickets when New Zealand were looking very dangerous.

If Kohli was the star for India with the bat, Shami was undoubtedly the hero with the ball. He has the most wickets in this tournament so far, 23 and counting.

Wicket! Shami has six! New Zealand 321-9

Shami’s last over of the day and what a day it has been for him.

Not satisfied with his five wickets, he decides to add another.

Southee is out for nine, fishing at one on the off side. He edges behind and Rahul takes it with a diving catch.

Wicket! Santner caught by Sharma! New Zealand 319-8

Siraj is in again and will be keen to pick up a late wicket for his efforts today.

And he gets one!

He delivers a slower ball bouncer to Santner who waits for the ball to reach him but can only catch it with the toe end of his bat.

It loops up in the air and is comfortably caught by Sharma. It’s almost over.
