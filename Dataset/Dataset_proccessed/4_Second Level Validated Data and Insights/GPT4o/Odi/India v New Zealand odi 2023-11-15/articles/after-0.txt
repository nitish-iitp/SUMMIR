Mohammed Shami you are a star!

The fast bowler gets his seventh wicket and New Zealand are all out!

India finish with a 70-run win to book their spot in the World Cup final.

"What a cricketer, what an impact," Nasser Hussain said of Shami's performance.

Daryl Mitchell's 134 is the highest individual score in a World Cup semi-final, while Mohammed Shami's five-wicket haul makes him the first bowler to take three at the same World Cup.

Mohammed Shami gets five!

A superb innings from Daryl Mitchell comes to an end, there was simply too much for him to do.

The Kiwi finishes with 134 off 119 balls and this game is definitely over.

Ravindra Jadeja takes the catch at cow corner to remove Mitchell.

30 balls remaining and 92 runs to win.

This would be unbelievable if New Zealand pulled it off.

Realistically though, it's India's game to lose with their bowlers putting in a masterclass late in the game.

Well if Daryl Mitchell can pull this off, he's a superhuman.

Mark Chapman departs as he's caught at deep square leg and Kuldeep Yadav gets a deserved wicket!

New Zealand are 6-298.
