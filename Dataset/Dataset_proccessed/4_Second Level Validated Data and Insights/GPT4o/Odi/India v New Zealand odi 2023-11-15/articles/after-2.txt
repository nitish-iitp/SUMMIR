“I wouldn’t say,” Rohit adds, “that there was no pressure.” That is a memorable double negative. And his team have now won ten games in a row. They go through to the final on Sunday (8.30am GMT). Tomorrow (also at 8.30) we have the second semi-final, to see whether it’s South Africa or Australia who get the honour of making up the numbers in the final.

Time for me to clock off. The day belongs to Mohammed Shami, though Rohit, Gill, Kohli, Iyer and Jadeja were not too shabby either. What a team they are. Thanks for your company, correspondence and views on the dew, which, in the end, was the dog that didn’t bark in the night.

One last factoid for you. At this World Cup India have won five games chasing, the narrowest margin being four wickets, against New Zealand in the group stage. And they have won five games batting first, the narrowest margin being 70 runs, against New Zealand today.

And here’s Rohit Sharma. “I’ve played a lot of cricket here, so I know any score on this ground – you cannot relax. We knew there would be a partnership. You gotta stay calm, we were a bit sloppy, but I’m glad that we could get the job done in the end.

“When the scoring rate is above nine, you’ve got to keep taking your chances. Mitchell and Williamson batted brilliantly. At one point, yes, the crowd went absolutely silent, but that’s the nature of the game… Shami was brilliant.”

“Well played NZ,” says Arul Kanhere. “The only team which has put India under such sustained pressure throughout two games. Whatever they say about bowling attacks winning tournaments … this semifinal was won by the batsmen.” Ha. I take your point, but it was Shami wot won it, wasn’t it?

Here’s Kane Williamson, measured as ever. “Firstly,” he says, “congratulations to India. They’ve played outstandingly well in this competition and perhaps played their best game today.”

He declines an offer to blame his bowlers. “India didn’t give us a sniff, really. It was tough [batting] out there, the ball swung a lot initially… Credit to India… Unbelievable crowd, great to be a part of it.”

“I have to say,” writes Nasiya, “I am loving Rohit Sharma’s demeanour as captain. Unlike the sphinx-like Dhoni and the over-the-top exuberance of Kohli, Rohit has the grumpy face of someone exasperated by the traffic on his daily commute. Exactly like all of us Indians.” Ha.

“I especially like how he doesn’t hide his frustration at a team mate’s misfield and shakes his head long after a dropped catch.” I hope he did that after dropping one himself.

“This is the best Indian cricket team I have seen,” says Krish, “and I have been watching cricket for 43 years.

“Has anyone,” he wonders, “taken seven wickets in an ODI before?”

They have. It’s only the 14th-best set of figures in a men’s ODI. Chaminda Vaas tops the list with an eight-for, but then that wasn’t in a semi-final.

Shami, bloody hell. He is now the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 23, one more than Adam Zampa of Australia. He had already taken two five-wicket hauls; now he’s added a seven-for. That’s like a batter scoring about 250.

The New Zealanders gave it a good go, but Shami shackled them with those two early wickets … and then returned to take five more. Long ago, in the first half of the day, Virat Kohli made yet another century, his 50th in one-day internationals, beating Sachin Tendulkar’s record. I really hope that isn’t allowed to overshadow Shami’s performance, which was out of this world. Oh, and Shreyas Iyer made a hundred too, much faster than Kohli’s, while Daryl Mitchell made one for NZ, his second against India in this World Cup.

In all, we’ve seen 624 runs in the day. And when there are that many runs to be made, the match is won by the bowlers.

Wicket! Santner c Rohit b Siraj 9 (NZ 319-8)

48th over: New Zealand 320-8 (Southee 9, Boult 1) Rohit dropped a catch a few minutes ago, but it hardly mattered and now he holds one to see off Santner. It was a slow bouncer from Siraj and Santner couldn’t get more than a toe-end on it.

Lockie Ferguson will only bat if required, so Trent Boult gets a rare outing at No 10. NZ need 78 off two overs: India are through.

47th over: New Zealand 313-7 (Santner 8, Southee 4) Bumrah, still baffling the batters, goes for just five off this over and finishes with 10-1-64-1. It’s all over bar the dancing.

Alistair Connor is back in my inbox, quoting himself from earlier. “I expect them to go down to/in the 47th over,” he wrote some time ago, “with less than 20 runs lacking.” Now he adds: “You may choose to quote me in full when it comes true eh?” Ha. Visionary about the overs, sadly not about the runs. NZ still need 85.

What a moment that was. Mitchell departs for 134, the highest score ever made in a World Cup semi-final. Mohammed Shami, the real player of this match, gets another five-wicket haul, his third of this World Cup. And Ravi Jadeja gets his third boundary catch in a row – Mitchell had flicked Shami high, and not hard enough, to deep square. With apologies to Kohli and Iyer, that this match in a nutshell.

45th over: New Zealand 306-6 (Mitchell 134, Santner 4) “Mitchell needs to do a Maxwell here,” says Nasser Hussain. The trouble is that India are giving him the single, and he can’t quite bring himself to turn it down. And Bumrah is bowling – yorkers, slower balls, nothing very hittable. Mitch Santner is looking for hard-run twos, which would be a great idea if NZ didn’t require three runs from every ball. They need 92 off five overs.

44th over: New Zealand 299-6 (Mitchell 132, Santner 0) One brings two, for the third time in this innings. For once, Shami is not involved: instead it’s a right-and-left for Jadeja, expertly positioned by Rohit, taking this catch on the rope at deep square. And it’s a hard-earned wicket for Kuldeep, who finishes with a very handy 10-0-55-1.

43rd over: New Zealand 295-5 (Mitchell 131, Chapman 0) Bumrah returned, bearing yorkers, at full speed for the first three balls. Phillips managed a snick for four, but when the slower ball finally came, he was through the shot too early. Jadeja, on the long-off boundary, never looked like dropping it.

Seven off the over, and a wicket. NZ are doomed, surely, because with Mitchell in pain, Phillips was making most of the running.

42nd over: New Zealand 288-4 (Mitchell 128, Phillips 37) After that big over, the Kiwis need a couple more. Not on my watch, says Kuldeep Yadav. Somehow he produces four dots, and the other two balls are singles. That may well be a match-sealing over.

Here’s Colum Fordham, the EW Swanton of the OBO – always ready with a summary. “Hello from Naples,” he says, “where my students don’t know the difference between cricket and baseball. On reflection, maybe the Kiwi batters better go into baseball mode.

”New Zealand are at least giving India a match of sorts and Mitchell has been sublime. Cramped up, he needs to be the Kiwis’ answer to Glenn Maxwell and Phillips has to go big now he’s played himself in. Although the run rate is almost impossible, NZ do have wickets in hand so they can’t be afraid to take their chances. The problem is that India’s bowlers (led by the sensational Shami) are on another level.”

41st over: New Zealand 286-4 (Mitchell 127, Phillips 36) An eighth over for Siraj too, still aiming for the empty slip cordon. A wide, then a six for Phillips, with a clever lofted slice. And another! Over long-off – higher, less wide and more handsome. The Indian faces in the crowd are suddenly tense. Another wide. That’s 15 off the over and there are still three balls to go!

Phillips plays a squirt square, for four. Then he nearly chops on, but he can afford that. A graph shows that India have bowled the fewest slower balls of any team in the tournament, only 14pc. Phillips cuts, to backward point again, and gets only one for it as there’s a good save on the boundary from Shubman Gill. Twenty off the over! NZ need 112 off 54 balls. But they’re only six runs behind India at the same stage…

40th over: New Zealand 266-4 (Mitchell 126, Phillips 19) Shami bowls his eighth over. One, dot, one, dot … something’s got to give. Mitchell plays a ramp off middle stump, for six! Nine off the over, still not enough. The rate required climbs to 13.

Another record goes up in smoke. This is the highest aggregate in a men’s World Cup knockout game, with 663 scored so far from 90 overs. Anyone else old enough to remember when Sunil Gavaskar made 36 not out off 60? Overs, not balls.

“Looking at this matchup from the perspective of an American sports fan,” says Paul Burns, “I thought the best analogue might be the 1991 NCAA men’s basketball semifinal, when upstart Duke derailed the seemingly invincible Nevada - Las Vegas. Alas, it’s turning out more like the 1990 version.” I’ll have to take your word for it.

39th over: New Zealand 257-4 (Mitchell 118, Phillips 18) Siraj continues, and Rohit continues to micro-manage him even though India are already an over behind on the clock. Phillips, growing into there game, flashes for four. Mitchell deflects for four more – the ball would have been a wide, but he saw that a toe-end and a cute angle would allow him cash in through backward point. Twelve off the over, and that’s a bit less than they need!

38th over: New Zealand 245-4 (Mitchell 113, Phillips 11) Ah, Shami was just changing ends. Mitchell has to go big and he does, swinging through the line to hit another of those trademark straight sixes. New Zealand have to go down swinging. Shami goes round the wicket, cat and mouse. Mitchell times a straight drive, back past Shami’s toes, but it’s cruelly cut off by the stumps at the non-striker’s end. NZ need 153 from 72 balls. And they need three big overs now.

37th over: New Zealand 236-4 (Mitchell 106, Phillips 9) Rohit elects to keep four overs of Shami up his sleeve, rather curiously, and brings back Mohammed Siraj. After some lengthy discussions, he dishes up some wide yorkers. Three dots, then a single, a two, a wide, another single. Nothing to bother India there: this partnership is 16 off 26 balls, which is hopeless. NZ need 162 from 78 balls at 12.46 an over.

36th over: New Zealand 231-4 (Mitchell 105, Phillips 6) Even singles are agony now for Mitchell. There’s a delay, two balls into Jadeja’s last over, while he gets some treatment. Phillips plays his first shot of any authority, a classy late cut for four. Jadeja finishes with 10-0-63-0. He took some punishment from Mitchell (37 balls, 40 runs), but he found some crucial thrift when India needed it, straight after drinks. The rate required is now virtually two runs a ball – 167 from 84. Almost impossible.

“I think the idea behind Latham,” says Arun Kanhere, “was him playing the anchor role like Williamson.” Maybe, but this is no time for anchors. I suspect it’s one of those things that would have been changed if the captain had been in the dressing-room to make the decision.

35th over: New Zealand 224-4 (Mitchell 103, Phillips 1) Shami continues, as well he may when he still has four overs left after this one. The third of his wickets – the big one, Williamson – was his 50th in World Cups, and he’s done it in only 17 innings.

Glenn Phillips, after seven rather agonising dots, finally dabs a single to leg. The problem is that Mitchell is only good for singles too at the moment, on account of his cramp. The four overs since drinks have yielded only 11 runs for two wickets.

“Never underestimate a cornered Kiwi!” Alistair Connor said in an email sent about an hour ago. They’re a bit more cornered now.

33rd over: New Zealand 220-4 (Williamson 69, Phillips 0) So Shami has changed the game for the second time this evening. (Third, if you count the catch he dropped.) He now has 4 for 27. I hope he says to Virat Kohli, “Mate, you just missed the Player of the Match award.”

At drinks, Rohit called his team into a huddle and had what looked like some stern words with them. After that he went back to his most reliable bowlers, Jadeja and Shami. One delivered three dots, the other two wickets. They were helped by NZ sending in Latham, a strange pick at No 5 in this situation when he’s so out of form.

Drinks: NZ threatening to make it a thriller

31st over: New Zealand 213-2 (Williamson 64, Mitchell 98) Mitchell made 130 against India just the other day – and copped some flak for slowing down as he approached his century. He show he’s learnt from that mistake by lofting Bumrah for six. Williamson adds four with an inside-out drive, there are four singles, and that’s 14 off the over. Magnificent. The rate required tumbles to 9.73.

Here’s Kim Thonger. “Reading about the Rwanda court decision,” he muses, “might it not be sensible for the authorities to assess cricketing ability upon asylum seeker arrival at the Kent coast? Many of them will presumably originate from cricket-playing nations. We’d all feel pretty foolish if we find later we’ve sent talented young players off to Rwanda, strengthening their cricket team for subsequent World Cups. The trials could easily be subcontracted to Kent CCC and fast-track citizenship enabled for promising cases.

“PS I’m joking of course. Jokes are still allowed, right?” They are. In these parts, they’re even encouraged.

30th over: New Zealand 199-2 (Williamson 58, Mitchell 90) Ten runs an over means two fours an over. These two manage it here against Kuldeep – Williamson with a slog-sweep, Mitchell with a reverse. A few minutes ago, Williamson had six runs off the previous five overs, to Mitchell’s 30, but he’s back at the party now.

Ian Smith spots that if you double the score at 30 overs, you get 398. “Take one off and we’’ll have a Super Over.” I’d settle for a close finish of any description.

Williamson dropped!

29th over: New Zealand 188-2 (Williamson 53, Mitchell 84) Rohit decides he needs to do something about this partnership and brings back Jasprit Bumrah. He starts with a slower ball, making Morgan wonder if the Indians have noticed the pitch getting slower. The next ball is the first Mitchell has faced from Bumrah this evening, and he swings it, one-handed, for four! Later in the over, Williamson cloths a pull and Shami drops it at mid-on! Not a hard one. This game is just a series of exclamation marks. NZ need 210 off 21 overs.
