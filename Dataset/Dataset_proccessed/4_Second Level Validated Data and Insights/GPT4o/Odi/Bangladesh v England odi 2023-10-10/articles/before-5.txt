The England cricket team after their loss to New Zealand in Ahmedabad.

England may be the ICC Cricket World Cup defending champions, but they have a lot to think about as they head into their second match of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Dharamsala on Tuesday. In a virtual sequel of the epic 2019 World Cup final, New Zealand demolished England with a ruthless nine-wicket win. The Jos Buttler-led side will be smarting from the heavy defeat, and will look to set things right when they face Bangladesh in match 7 of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. (Scorecard | Match Blog | Full Coverage)

Bangladesh, on the other hand, are a confident lot after comfortably prevailing over Afghanistan in their opening World Cup fixture. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side bundled out Afghanistan for a paltry 156 in the first innings, and then knocked off the target with six wickets and 92 balls to spare. They will be looking to capitalize on England's vulnerabilities and cause an upset by beating the holders in the early stages of the tournament.

The match will be played at the scenic Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium in Dharamsala, which is currently under the scanner for its poor outfield. Buttler has gone on record to slam the outfield, calling it "poor" and not ideal for any fielding side. 

"I think it's poor, in my own opinion. I think any time you're talking about being careful diving, or maybe being careful when you're fielding, it goes against everything you want to be as a team," Buttler remarked ahead of the England vs Bangladesh match. 

Head-To-Head
The two teams have played each other 24 times in ODIs, and England have won 19 of those games, while the rest have seen Bangladesh emerging victors. In the last five encounters, England enjoy a 4-1 win record against the subcontinetal team. However, Bangaldesh's solitary win came in the most recent clash between the two sides, in March this year. Bangladesh had beaten England by a handsome 50 runs in that game in Chattogram.
