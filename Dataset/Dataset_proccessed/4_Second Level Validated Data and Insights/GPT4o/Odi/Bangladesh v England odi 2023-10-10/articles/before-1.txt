England require a win against Bangladesh to get their World Cup campaign up-and-running after suffering a surprise opening round thrashing at the hands of New Zealand.

It's not quite must-win for England. But it's close. Their nine-wicket loss to the Black Caps was as convincing a defeat as they have suffered in recent memory and has turned the match against Bangladesh from one that should have been a routine win, into an out-and-out banana skin.

Lose, and England will pretty much need to win all seven of their remaining matches to make the semi-finals.

Bangladesh started their campaign with a tidy win over Afghanistan and will by no means be a pushover, but the match being held in the stunning Dharmasala, where spin plays much less of a role, will favour England's arsenal of quick bowlers.

For that reason, England may leave out the spin of Moeen Ali and pick one of Gus Atkinson, David Willey or Reece Topley as an extra seamer. Elsewhere in the squad, Ben Stokes is expected to remain unavailable whilst he recovers from a hip injury.

England v Bangladesh key player to watch
Dawid Malan (England)

England were unusually tentative with the bat against New Zealand, with Joe Root saying to the BBC afterwards: "I don't think we'll see guys getting caught mid-off or long-off check-driving anymore. They'll be hitting it 20 rows back."

Malan's 14 off 24 balls against New Zealand was indicative of a stop-start innings for England. Against Bangladesh, expect the shackles to be gone and a speedy start on show from one of the form players in the world.
