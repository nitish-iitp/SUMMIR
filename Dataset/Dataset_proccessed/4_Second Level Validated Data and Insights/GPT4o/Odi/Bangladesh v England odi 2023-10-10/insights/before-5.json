        "England may be the ICC Cricket World Cup defending champions, but they have a lot to think about as they head into their second match of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Dharamsala on Tuesday.",
        "Bangladesh, on the other hand, are a confident lot after comfortably prevailing over Afghanistan in their opening World Cup fixture.",
        "The match will be played at the scenic Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium in Dharamsala, which is currently under the scanner for its poor outfield.",
        "Buttler has gone on record to slam the outfield, calling it 'poor' and not ideal for any fielding side.",
        "The two teams have played each other 24 times in ODIs, and England have won 19 of those games, while the rest have seen Bangladesh emerging victors.",
        "In the last five encounters, England enjoy a 4-1 win record against the subcontinental team.",
        "Bangladesh's solitary win came in the most recent clash between the two sides, in March this year. Bangladesh had beaten England by a handsome 50 runs in that game in Chattogram.",
        "The good news is that there is little to no chance of rain in Dharamsala. As the stadium is located on a hilly terrain, the weather will be pleasant, with temperatures expected to hover between 15 and 22 degrees Celsius and 57% humidity."
