        "The surface at the Wanderers Park in Windhoek is a bowling-friendly track, with a bit of help for the batters in the first half of the game. The average score here has been 204 runs, while the overall average score reduces to 190 runs. So, defending the target in the second innings could be a good choice here at this deck. The captain winning the toss will look ahead to bat first to post a troubling target for the opponent."
