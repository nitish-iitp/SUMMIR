        "Jos Buttler: 'It hurts a lot. We haven\u2019t done ourselves justice. Coming into the tournament we fancied ourselves to have a real go and push whoever it was going to be all the way. It\u2019s incredibly tough to reach those highs absolutely. Everyone knows how much hard work goes into that, and even when you come up short.'",
        "Moeen Ali: 'Obviously very disappointed, we just haven\u2019t been good enough in this tournament, a lack of confidence in the side. A little better today. We tried so much, and as players tried to be really aggressive but we just couldn\u2019t do it and lost wickets in clumps.'",
        "Pat Cummins: 'We knew at the start of the tournament we weren\u2019t at our best, we\u2019ve seen a marked improvement. Adam Zampa is a match-winner, and we\u2019re lucky to have a few of them. We feel like we have a whole squad ready to play.'"
