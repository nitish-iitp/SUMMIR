England vs Australia Score Highlights; ENG vs AUS: Australia defeated England by 33 runs to officially knock out defending champions out of the ICC World Cup 2023. Spinner Adam Zampa clinched some crucial wickets to provide breakthroughs for his team, while Ben Stokes fought well scoring 64 runs. 

England batters Ben Stokes and Dawid Malan are playing in a good partnership to lead their team's comeback after loosing opener Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root early. Australia Mitchell Strac and Adam Zampa are continously trying for wickets

Mitchell Strac displayed the magic of his pace as he dismissed England opener Jonny Baistow on the first ball of the 287-run chase. Great start for Australia as Joe Root walks to the crease to continue the chase. 

Australia's strong batter order couldn't do that well against out of the form England as the team was all-out on a score of 286 runs. Chris Woakes clinched 4 wickets while Mark Wood and Adil Rashid got 2 wickets each to stop Australia on decent score. Marnus Labuschagne scored the highest 71 for Australia while Cameron Green contributed 47 runs. 

England spinner Adil Rashid clinched back-to-back wickets to dismiss Steve Smith and Josh Inglis in quick succession. England is making a comeback in the game as Cameron Green walks to the crease. 

Australia batters Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne are playing in a good partnership and stabilized the innings after their team lost their openers early. England was off to a good start, but they need to break this partnership soon, to keep the pressure on Australia. 

Reigning champions England have won the toss and decided to bat first at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The ENG vs AUS clash promises to be a thrilling encounter, with the defending champions likely to go all out after being knocked out of the tournament.

Australia have made two forced changes in their playing XI with Marcus Stoinis and Cameron Green coming in for Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell. England have opted to go for the same side.

England have had a miserable World Cup defence, winning just 1 of their 6 matches and sitting at the bottom of the ICC World Cup points table. Jos Buttler's side have failed to beat the likes of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.

Australia, on the other hand, have had a decent campaign so far and are favourites to reach the semi-finals of the marquee event. The Kangaroos have made a remarkable comeback from crushing defeats to India and Australia in the opening matches of the ICC ODI World Cup 2023, winning 4 out of 4.

Aussies are missing the services of two key players for this encounter - Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell. While Maxwell is ruled out owing to an injury he suffered while playing golf, Marsh has gone back home to Perth for unknown reasons.

A victory against England in Ahmedabad will all but cement the Kangaroos' position in the semi-final of the ODI World Cup.

Australia and England Playing XI: 

David Warner, Travis Head, Steven Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis(w), Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis, Pat Cummins(c), Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

England: Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (C & WK), Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid and Mark Wood.
