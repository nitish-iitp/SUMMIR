That's it from our side

We'll be back for tomorrow's Super Sunday clash between the table-topper India and South Africa. The contest will surely be a mouth-watering one, as the winner will retain the no. 1 spot on the points table. See you all tomorrow. Good night and take care all..!!

Jos Buttler speaks

Jos Buttler - Disappointment, we were having the same chat after the match. Improvements today, more with the bat, but we were still well short, no complaints if you lose by 30 runs. A low point as a captain, you stand in this position, you came to India with high hopes and expectations, we haven't done ourselves any justice, everyone knows how much hard work we've put, these losses weigh high on our shoulders. We did well (with the ball), but we could have done better, we let them put up frustrating little partnerships. With the dew around, we backed ourselves and we fell 30 runs short. It was the right shot to play (on his dismissals), the execution wasn't great, I was trying to take it back to them. I haven't played as well as I can, in such a pivotal position, I think I let myself and my team down. Only way to come back is to put in the hard yards at the nets and come back better in the nextgame

Pat Cummins speaks

Pat Cummins [Winning Skipper] - It's been great, the boys played brilliantly, we're getting better with each match. We've improved with each game, still not playing the perfect game. It's something we pride ourselves on, we didn't start well, but the boys have put their hands up, ever since the first 2 games. He has been bowling beautifully in the last 3 games (on Zampa), made 29 and took a banger (of a catch). We thought it was a good wicket and would probably break up to his strength. Maxi and Mitchy will be back, they have had a great tournament and for the others to come in and put in a performance was nice. It wasn't too bad tonight (on the dew), sometimes we do see players getting wet as they slide on, but it wasn't that bad today.

Starc has his say

Mitchell Starc: Keeps the momentum going. Not the best start but we have progressed nicely. We are going along nicely. They would probably claim a moral victory (smiles). They are the defending champions, we thought they will come aggressively at us. Was generally slow to start with. We didn’t really mention a par score. Zampa took the momentum away. A couple of wickets in the powerplay helped. Zampa has had a helluva a day. Probably didn’t get it right the other night against NZ. Got a proper training session. Sometimes my take-off into the delivery stride forced me to jump into it. The one to Joe Root swung a little late. I certainly heard it. Marnus heard it but he has a poor strike rate when it comes to reviews, gets it right once in 50 (laughs). I don’t think you can take anyone lightly. There is some nip in Wankhede. We saw India bowling superbly the other night.

Adam Zampa is the Player of the Match

Adam Zampa has been adjudged as the Player of the Match for his sensational outing in the clash.

He took 3/21 in his ten overs, scored 29 runs with the bat, and took a brilliant catch towards the back end of the game.

While receiving the award, he said - 

Adam Zampa | Man of the Match: I mean just summing up the conditions was important. We batted really well to get to 286. The ground got really dewy. Attacking the stumps was important. It came out as good as it ever has. Felt really good. Just tried to be really positive and bat out the 50 overs. Was important to rotate the strike. One of those days. Felt satisfying. Hopefully my best is yet to come.

Done and dusted

253 runs is all what England could get in their pursuit of 287. And with that last wicket, Hazlewood has downed the curtains to the innings. England, the defending champions, are now officially out of the World Cup.

Gone..!!

Chris Woakes has to depart, as the last ball of the 48th over gets a much-needed breakthrough for the Aussies.

34 needed off the last two with just one wicket to go.

It's a SIXXXX

Adil Rashid pelts it behind the wickets for a maximum. That was a high full-toss, and he has absolutely latched onto it.

Cameron Green's pants come off as he dives trying to save boundary, video goes viral

The fielder at long-on, Cameron Green, tried to save the ball from going to the boundary by diving in extremely hard. But his trousers slip down in the process, probably because of the excess amount due in the outfield. The match is all-set for a nail-biting finish, as we might see more such fielding efforts from the Aussies now.

Sweet from Rashid

Excellent strike by Adil Rashid, as Cameron Green's trousers slip while diving to hold onto that one at long-on.

After 46 overs, England are 233 for 8. Another reminder that they need 54 more runs to win off four overs.

England (ENG) will face Australia (AUS) will lock horns in the 36th match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. The teams' recent form could not be more different, with Australia clinching four consecutive wins while England suffering as many consecutive losses. However, following a fiercely competitive Ashes series not too long ago, expect no shortage of rivalry and intensity when they clash.

Australia have been dealt a blow as they will be without two crucial all-rounders, Glenn Maxwell, sidelined due to a freak concussion injury, and Mitch Marsh, absent for personal reasons, for the upcoming clash against England. Maxwell is anticipated to rejoin the squad for the subsequent match against Afghanistan. However, there is uncertainty surrounding Marsh's return, with no substitute player designated.

The prime contenders for these spots are allrounders Marcus Stoinis, now recuperated from a calf issue, and Cameron Green. Worth noting, Sean Abbott, a bowling allrounder, remains the lone player in Australia's lineup who is yet to make an appearance in the tournament.

England’s chopping and changing might continue in Ahmedabad 

England's World Cup 2023 journey has witnessed consistent alterations, as they have shuffled their lineup in every match. Although their bowling contingent faced some pressure, they displayed resilience in the recent encounter against India, and expectations are high for a repeat performance. The primary concern for Jos Buttler's side has been their batting, as they have struggled constantly, getting dismissed for 170 or fewer runs in their last three matches.

The reigning champions have endured a woeful World Cup run, suffering significant defeats at the hands of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, which were especially stunning. Their campaign began with a crushing nine-wicket loss to New Zealand in Ahmedabad. They are back at the same venue, aiming to turn their fortunes around against Australia. While they aren't yet mathematically out of the semi-final race, a defeat to the Aussies would all but confirm their expected exit from the competition.
