Virat Kohli joins team India ahead of their cricket World Cup match against Australia

Pakistan secured a comprehensive 81-run victory against a battling Netherlands to kickstart their World Cup campaign. Babar Azam’s side were in trouble after falling to 38-3 in the early stages but half-centuries from Saud Shakeel and Muhammad Rizwan saw them recover to post 286 after 49 overs.

Netherlands started brightly in their chase as Bas de Leede and Vikram Singh both reached their half-centuries as part of a 70-run stand. But when Singh fell, the Dutch middle order failed to provide support for De Leede who eventually fell for 67, with Scott Edward’s side losing their last 8 wickets for 85 runs as they were bowled out for 205.

Pakistan captain, Babar Azam, speaking after his side’s win

“The way Hyderabad have supported [us], we’re very happy and the team has enjoyed their hospitality. I’m pretty satisfied. All credit to the bowlers, they started well and then we were able to take wickets in the middle and put pressure on them.

“We lost three wickets early but the way Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel started gave us momentum. The century partnership then put pressure on the Netherlands. I liked the way Saud built his innings, he’s improved a lot.”

More from Edwards on Logan van Beek’s potential injury

“He is a key player but I haven’t spoken to him but he was pretty keen to get out there. We’ll assess [the injury] in the next few days.”

Netherlands captain, Scott Edwards, speaking after the game

“It is a little bit disappointing. I thought we bowled and fielded really well, but to Pakistan’s credit, they made a few runs at the end. We felt it was about a par score and at 120-2 we felt we were well and truly in the game.”

“It is probably one that got away - we were in a pretty good position to win that. We know they have quality bowlers but they took a few wickets in the middle and that held us back.”

On Bas De Leede’s performance: “He is a quality cricketer, isn’t he? It is all three departments. I thought he bowled exceptionally well and his innings was awesome. We just needed someone to go with him.”

Saud Shakeel, player of the match, speaking after the match

“I was very pleased with my performance. I tried to follow my basics and be positive and score runs for the team. There were nerves there, especially being three down, but I was fortunate that I got early boundaries. We spoke about being positive and the pressure would move to the Netherlands and that happened.

“The last two or three months I have been working on my game. I know I am going to bat at five for Pakistan so I’ve been trying to improve my attacking options and be brave to use them.”

Pakistan win by 81 runs

At one stage, when Singh and De Leede were going along nicely, it looked like the Dutch may just threaten a shock victory. But the two lacked any meaningful support from those around them and when they both departed, the run chase capitulated, losing their last 8 wickets for 85 runs

Pakistan wobbled a bit with the bat at the start but they showed all their skill with the ball to run through the Netherlands and secure a healthy win which will aid their net run-rate tremendously.

WICKET! Van Meekeren b Rauf 7 (NED 205 all out)

Rauf continues as Pakistan hunt for the final wicket. Rauf almost threatens the stumps as Van Beek misses a pretty straight one but the Dutch batsman survives.

But they do have the final wicket now! Rauf cleans up Van Meekeren and lets out an almighty roar.

Pakistan have a comprehensive 81-run victory and the perfect start to this World Cup.
