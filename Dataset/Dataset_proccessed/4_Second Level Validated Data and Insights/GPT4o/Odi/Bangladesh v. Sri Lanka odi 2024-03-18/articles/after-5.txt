Wanindu in trouble again over umpire criticism ?
March 18, 2024 at 7:12 PM

Following Sri Lanka’s ODI series loss to Bangladesh, all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga is now under ICC scrutiny for his criticism of an umpire during the 3rd ODI.

Reports indicate that the umpire has filed a complaint with the match referee regarding Hasaranga’s behavior.

With previous demerit points accumulated from past infractions, Hasaranga could potentially face a suspension spanning multiple international games if found guilty.

Sri Lanka is scheduled to play Bangladesh in a two-test series next, and Hasaranga, who recently withdrew his test retirement, has reportedly been included in the Sri Lankan Test squad to face Bangladesh. (NewsWire)
