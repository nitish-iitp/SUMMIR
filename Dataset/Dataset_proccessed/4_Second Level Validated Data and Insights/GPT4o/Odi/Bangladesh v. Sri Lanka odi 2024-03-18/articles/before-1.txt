BAN vs SL (Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka), 3rd ODI Match Preview

Bangladesh has made a bold move by axing seasoned batter Litton Das from the playing XI for the final ODI, following his failure to score any runs in the series so far.

Meanwhile, Dilshan Madushanka’s absence due to injury opens the door for Thekshana to make an appearance in the playing XI.

Our prediction favors Sri Lanka to win.
