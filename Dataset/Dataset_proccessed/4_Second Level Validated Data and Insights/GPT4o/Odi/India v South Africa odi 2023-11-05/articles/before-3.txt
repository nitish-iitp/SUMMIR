The top two teams of the ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023, India and South Africa, will be facing off in Match 37 on Sunday in Kolkata. The highly anticipated game will take place at the iconic Eden Gardens on the day when former India skipper Virat Kohli will celebrate his 35th birthday.

While India has maintained an unbeaten record in the competition, South Africa's only loss came against the Netherlands, with a 38-run deficit. 

India currently holds the top position on the points table, having played seven and won as many matches, becoming the 1st team to qualify. South Africa is not far behind and has also played seven matches having won six and a very healthy Net Run Rate (NRR).
