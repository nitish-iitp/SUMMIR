"Eden Gardens became a sea of light as the crowd lit up their mobile phones in anticipation when Ravindra Jadeja nudged a single off Kagiso Rabada to bring Virat Kohli on strike on 99 in the 49th over..." writes Tom Mallows in his match report.

Virat Kohli is one of the greatest, if not the greatest white ball player with the bat in hand. He broke the game down in stages, he and Shreyas Iyer decided they needed a big partnership, he dropped anchor and players batted around him. We know if it wasn't an important hundred he'd have played with a bit more impetus. But his ability to execute is why he's one of the modern day greats.

'Virat batted the situation...'

India captain Rohit Sharma: "I think we are getting better. We look how we have played in the last three games. We played better in terms of adapting to the situation. Again today it was not an easy pitch. You needed some like Virat Kohi to bat the situation. Same with Shreyas Iyer. We knew we had the runs on the board to put the ball in the right areas and the pitch would do the rest.

"You have to stick with the guys who have done well for you. Mohammed Shami was not part of the squad in the first few games and it shows the mindset of the players. Shreyas Iyer is the same. The last two games he has showed the class he has.

"Myself and Shubman Gill let the instincts take over at the start and we go out and play the kind of cricket we are playing. Ravindra Jadeja goes under the radar but he is an important player. He knows what is expected in this team.

"We are not getting ahead of ourselves. There are couple of big games to come. We have to stay in the moment which has been the talk from day one. We want to show our potential."

'We have to adapt...'

South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma: "Look we know it's a challenge. We know there's a narrative about us chasing. We didn't do that game a lot of justice. But I think we have our conversations as a batting group, we have discuss it unemotionally."

On the first 10 overs: "That did make it a bit of a challenge, we did do quite well after that. Our biggest challenge was taking wickets, they had a big partnership with Kohli and Iyer.

"The wicket played the way we suspected it would play, against all the advice we were getting. We expected it to deteriorate, but we weren't able to adapt our skills accordingly. We could be here for the semi-finals, we got a proper look, we have to adapt."

It's all about written in the stars, the only thing that can stop India is themselves. They look superior to everything we've seen so far, so that's why they'll qualify top of the table.

On X: "India are the second team to bowl two opponents out for under 100 in a single men's World Cup (Sri Lanka 55, South Africa 83).

"Sri Lanka also did so in 2007 (bowled out Bermuda for 78, Ireland for 77). India had never previously dismissed their opponents for <100 in a World Cup match."

'A huge honour...'

Player of the match Virat Kohli: "It was a big game and we were playing the toughest team in the tournament who have played well so far. Because it's my birthday it becomes more special. I had the sense it's going to be something more than just one more game in the World Cup. I woke up with that excitement.

"People from the outside look at the game in a different way to us. When the openers start that way it looks a belter but with the old ball it slows down. I did the job the team required me to do and everyone can express themselves around me. Once were above 315 we knew it was above par."

On equalling Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI centuries: "For me it's too much to take in right now. To equal my hero's record is a huge honour. People like comparisons. I am never going to be as good as him. He is perfection with batting. It's an emotional moment. I know where I come from and to watch him on TV. His appreciation means a lot to me.

"I am enjoying playing cricket all over again. I am happy God has blessed me with that enjoyment."

Ravindra Jadeja has his five-wicket haul at a World Cup!

It's a tame dismissal, in all honesty, as Kagiso Rabada drives it low and straight back to the India spinner who takes the catch.

The last rites being read for South Africa.

It's good signs that Ngidi is out there, as South Africa don't have many options to replace him either in the squad or outside it. There's a lot of injury about.
