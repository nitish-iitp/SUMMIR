It’s a wrap

This match was hyped up as being a top-of-the-table clash but ultimately proved to fall short of expectations as India have sent another stiff warning to the rest of the field after delivering a hefty 243-run defeat against South Africa.

There were questions about the Proteas’s ability to chase after crumbling to the Netherlands and then just getting past the line against Pakistan in a narrow one-wicket victory.

While they have qualified for the semifinal stage, their opposition will certainly keep that in mind.

India are looking every part the team that can go all the way with the batting and bowling performances they have put together, and continue to be the marquee team of the tournament.

The Men in Blue will now close out their group stage campaign against the Netherlands on Nov 12, while South Africa face a surging Afghanistan squad on November 10.

We hope you enjoyed our coverage of this match, and on behalf of Kevin Hand and Patrick Keddie, this is Rohan Sharma signing off.

‘I am enjoying playing cricket all over again’

Kohli is duly awarded the player of the match for his history-making ton, and had this to say post-match: “It was a big game. We are probably playing the toughest team in the tournament. There was motivation to play well. Of course, with it being my birthday it definitely made it special. I did wake up with that excitement.”

When the openers started in that fashion, and the ball was new, then you think wow this is a belter [of a pitch]. But then the ball slows down so I looked to bat deep. I need to keep doing the job my team requires me to do. Once we got past 315 we knew it was above par and we were in a comfortable position,” he said.

“I am enjoying playing cricket all over again. You are still able to score runs due to experience, but I am happy that God has blessed me with that enjoyment again.”

“It is all too much to take in right now. To equal my hero’s [Tendulkar’s] record in ODIs is very special to me. I will never be as good as him. There is a reason why we all looked up to him. I am trying to do my best to win games for my country. He will always be my hero.”

South Africa 83 all out. Ngidi out!

Kuldeep puts the finishing touches on what has been a bowling masterclass from India as he bowls Ngidi to put the stamp on a devastating 243-run victory.

Fireworks erupt from the stadium rooftop as India couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day on the field with birthday boy Kohli equalling Tendulkar’s mark of 49 ODI hundreds, and then Jadeja leading the bowlers with 5 for 33 in nine overs.

27 overs. South Africa 83-9

Against the run of play, Shamsi manages to drill one through cow corner for a boundary.

The next ball offers up a potential caught-and-bowled opportunity as the ball ricochets onto the pads from the bat, but the chance dies on Jadeja before he could get to it.

South Africa 79-9. Rabada out!

Jadeja becomes the first Indian bowler to take a World Cup five-wicket haul after completing a successful caught-and-bowled to dismiss Rabada.

India are just a wicket away now as South Africa’s number 11, Shamsi, strides out to the middle.

South Africa 79-8. Jansen out!

Kuldeep bowls a shorter one which Jansen lofts casually to Jadeja at cover, who takes it quite comfortably.

South Africa’s final threat with the bat has to depart as Ngidi makes his way out to the middle.

He had to leave during the 50th over of India’s innings to receive medical attention, so will be interesting to see how he fares out there in the face of this relentless bowling.

Rohit decides to bring back his spearhead, Bumrah, into the attack to try and make a breakthrough.

He mixes up his lengths quite well as he bowls five dots in a row.

However, Jansen is able to come out on top with a lofted drive over mid-off to find the boundary.
