IND vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Venue and Pitch Report

The two games in the World Cup 2023 have been low-scoring, but this will be a run fest. The pitch will be fast and skiddy, as it mostly is here in Kolkata. The batters should enjoy batting, with the pacers looking to hurry the batters with their speeds. A total of around 300 will be a fighting one.

A temperature of 32°C, with no threat of rain, is forecast.

India: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj.

South Africa: Temba Bavuma (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Gerald Coetzee, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi.

IND vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

Rohit Sharma: Rohit Sharma enjoys batting at Eden Gardens. Moreover, he also likes pace on his bat and has been in terrific touch lately. Expect Rohit to score big.

Virat Kohli: Virat Kohli has a tremendous record against South Africa, and he always scores runs against them. Virat can again play a big knock, given the kind of form he’s in.

Quinton de Kock: Quinton de Kock has a sensational record against India, and his recent form has also been very good. He likes playing on surfaces like Kolkata, where the ball gets extra bounce and comes nicely on the bat. Another big score might well be on the cards.

IND vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Kuldeep Yadav: Kuldeep Yadav has surprisingly been picked up by less than 29% of users as of now, making him a good differential pick. He has a fantastic record against South Africa, and his recent form has also been decent. Kuldeep can cause serious damage to the South African team.

If IND bat first:

Complete the team with three among Shubman Gill, David Miller, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.

If SA bat first:
