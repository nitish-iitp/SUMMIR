    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'I think we are getting better. We look how we have played in the last three games. We played better in terms of adapting to the situation. Again today it was not an easy pitch. You needed some like Virat Kohi to bat the situation. Same with Shreyas Iyer. We knew we had the runs on the board to put the ball in the right areas and the pitch would do the rest.'",
        "South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma: 'Look we know it's a challenge. We know there's a narrative about us chasing. We didn't do that game a lot of justice. But I think we have our conversations as a batting group, we have discuss it unemotionally.'",
        "Player of the match Virat Kohli: 'It was a big game and we were playing the toughest team in the tournament who have played well so far. Because it's my birthday it becomes more special. I had the sense it's going to be something more than just one more game in the World Cup. I woke up with that excitement.'",
        "On equalling Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI centuries: 'For me it's too much to take in right now. To equal my hero's record is a huge honour. People like comparisons. I am never going to be as good as him. He is perfection with batting. It's an emotional moment. I know where I come from and to watch him on TV. His appreciation means a lot to me.'"
