        "Experts predicted India as the favorites given their home advantage.",
        "The pitch will be fast and skiddy, as it mostly is here in Kolkata. The batters should enjoy batting, with the pacers looking to hurry the batters with their speeds. A total of around 300 will be a fighting one.",
        "A temperature of 32\u00b0C, with no threat of rain, is forecast.",
        "Rohit Sharma enjoys batting at Eden Gardens. Moreover, he also likes pace on his bat and has been in terrific touch lately. Expect Rohit to score big.",
        "Virat Kohli has a tremendous record against South Africa, and he always scores runs against them. Virat can again play a big knock, given the kind of form he\u2019s in.",
        "Quinton de Kock has a sensational record against India, and his recent form has also been very good. He likes playing on surfaces like Kolkata, where the ball gets extra bounce and comes nicely on the bat. Another big score might well be on the cards."
