Well, we didn't have to wait as long as yesterday - the teams are shaking hands and the match has been abandoned.

This doesn't haven't have any effect on the state of the group - India and the United States have already qualified for the Super 8s, whereas Canada already knew they'd be going home along with Ireland and Pakistan.

We'll back for England's match with Nambia at 17:30 BST - see you shortly.

Pitch inspection at 16:30 BST
published at 15:37 British Summer Time 15 June 2024
15:37 BST 15 June 2024

As expected, the ground isn't ready and we'll be waiting another hour for the next inspection.

For those who haven't been following the Florida weather - there's been a huge amount of rain over there in the last week.

Ireland and the United States were meant to play on this ground yesterday and we waited around three hours until the match was called off.

It didn't rain until around the time of the final inspection, but the sheer amount of water soaked into the turf meant the ground was unplayable.

While it's not raining presently, there was a downpour overnight, which won't have helped matters.

We'll be back at 16:30 with another update, until then TMS remains on air.

Good afternoon

Hello there.

The Florida leg of this T20 World Cup has been blighted by rain, with the first two matches at Lauderhill abandoned without a ball bowled.

We were hoping for better luck today, with India and Canada scheduled to begin at 15:30 BST.

Unfortunately that start has been postponed, with an inspection due in fifteen minutes. It's not currently raining at the ground and the players have been warming-up, but the covers are on presently.

We'll keep you updated with news from each inspection (assuming we get more than one). Otherwise, you'll get up to the minute information from our Test Match Special team at the ground - hit play at the top of the page.
