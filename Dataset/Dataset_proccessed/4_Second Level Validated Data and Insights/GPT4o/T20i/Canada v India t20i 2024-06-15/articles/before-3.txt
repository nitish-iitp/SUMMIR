Watch India vs. Canada T20 Cricket World Cup 2024 match in North America: US, Canada TV channel, free live stream

India hopes to face Canada in their final group match of the T20 World Cup on June 15 in Florida, assuming the weather does not intervene.

India, with three straight wins, has already secured a spot in the Super 8 stage of the tournament, and will hope to sign off the group phase in style.

Heavy rains and flooding around the Central Broward Regional Park mean that the status of the fixture has been in doubt, especially as the USA vs. Ireland fixture at the same venue on Friday was washed out due to the rain.

That no result meant a shocking early exit for Pakistan from this World Cup, after they were sensationally beaten by the USA earlier in the tournament.

Canada, playing in their first T20 World Cup, showed their grit with a win over Ireland. Opener Aaron Johnson is one to watch. However, facing a strong Indian side will be a tough challenge. 

Apart from the inclement conditions, Virat Kohli's form has been a big talking point in the buildup for India. After a spectacular season in the Indian Premier League, Kohli has struggled in the World Cup so far, scoring only five runs in three matches.

Can he get back on track against Canada? The Sporting News has all the details on how you can watch this match.
