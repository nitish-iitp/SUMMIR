In Short
India's final group stage game against Canada was washed out due to wet oufield
India end their group stage campaign unbeaten - with 7 points from 4 matches
3 of the 4 matches scheduled in Florida have been washed out due to wet outfield

India were robbed of an opportunity to experiment with their team combination in their final Group A match of T20 World Cup 2024. The game against Canada on Saturday, June 15 was washed out due to a wet outfield. The umpires had two official inspections and did not wait any longer than 9 pm IST to take the final call.

With India already having sealed a place in the Super 8s and Canada out of contention, the umpires did not risk players' safety. Overnight rain had led to a soggy outfield. Despite the ground staff working hard, the lack of covers for the outfield meant there were puddles on the ground. The conditions were deemed unfit for a game, leading to disappointment for fans who had turned up in large numbers at Lauderhill in Florida.

India players and coaching staff, including Rahul Dravid, made sure they strolled around the field and signed some autographs for fans during the delay.

Notably, the umpires had waited an extra hour to inspect the pitch for another Group A game between the USA and Ireland. Pakistan's hopes came down crashing as the game was called off without a ball bowled on Friday due to a wet outfield. Pakistan were knocked out early and co-hosts USA made it to the Super 8s and also earned their ticket to the T20 World Cup in 2026.

COMPLETE WASHOUT IN FLORIDA?

The poor drainage and lack of covers at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Florida has not led to good viewing as three games -- Sri Lanka vs Nepal on June 11, USA vs Ireland on June 15 and India vs Canada on June 15.

Pakistan will end their campaign on Sunday with a game against Ireland at the same venue and it looks likely that the entire Florida leg will be washed out. It's has been raining heavily in Florida over the last week and flash flood alerts were also issued.

India ended their campaign with 7 points from 4 matches. India defeated Ireland, Pakistan and the USA before their final Group A game was washed out. In fact, Rohit Sharma's men were the first team to qualify for the Super 8s from the group. USA stunned Pakistan to finish ahead of the former champions and sneak through to the next round in their maiden appearance in the tournament.
