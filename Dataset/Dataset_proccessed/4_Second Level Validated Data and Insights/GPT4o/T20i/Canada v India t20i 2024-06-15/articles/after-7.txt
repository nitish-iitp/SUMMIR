Hello and welcome!
India vs Canada, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights:

India vs Canada, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: Stormy weather in Florida claimed a second match. A day after the game between USA and Ireland was washed off, Saturday's game between India and Canada has been abandoned before the toss could take place. Unlike what was the case on Friday, there was hardly any rain leading up to the match on Saturday. However, the heavy showers over the past two days had done enough damage to the field for the game to be called off. While Friday's washout resulted in USA going through to the Super 8 and Pakistan's knockout being confirmed, there were no similar big effects on Saturday as both sides' fates had already been sealed. Inda were already through to the Super 8 as table-toppers, finishing on seven points, while Canada have finished on three points.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: MATCH ABANDONED!

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: That's it! nothing to see here folks. There will be no cricket today. There was no rain but the damage done to the field could not be reversed. The The umpires had the inspection, spoke to the groundstaff and then told the match referee that play won't be possible. They then told the two captains and now the teams and coaching staff are shaking hands. Canada thus finish third on the Group table with three points, they could go further down of course as Pakistan are yet to face Ireland in the deadest of all dead rubbers. However, that match is happening at the same venue as well and so chances are that it will meet the same fate as the games today and yesterday. India finish top of the table with seven points.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: England will be facing Namibia in about 90 minutes. England had thrashed Oman like few others have been thrashed and now they need to win against Namibia to stay alive. Once they do this, they only need to hope that Australia don't turn up for their match against Scotland in blindfolds.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: The Indian players seemed to be quite relaxed, some playing a bit of footy and the others chatting around on the field. We await the inspection.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: The umpires are walking out there. The outfield is looking quite horrible, dark green footmarks all over the place and new ones being formed wherever anyone walks. Tire marks being left by the blowers as well. The ground looks as soggy as it gets.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: India's fielding coach on Rishabh Pant's comeback

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: India's fielding coach T Dilip lauded wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant for his performance since his return to the international cricket after a life-threatening road accident back in late-2022. "The best thing is that Rishabh has done so well in his comeback. Especially the batting is considered to be very good. But one of the good things about him is the way he came back as a wicket keeper. Especially with an injury he had, to come back as a wicket keeper and do that lateral movement, so that is very heartening to see," he said.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: Netravalkar's USA fairy tale

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: He had to take leave from his company to play in the T20 World Cup. Well, Saurabh Netravalkar may now have to extend that leave considering his team have stormed into the knockouts. Something tells us that his boss may not really be able to give him too hard a time for that considering the entire company has taken note of his achievement.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: No wet weather in Lauderhill for now

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs CAN: The city has seen some respite from the rain today. The issue, though, would be if the ground needs any drying around the time of the toss and if so, then there is the added question of whether it can sustain until the next bout of rain comes, which one can assume would happen during the match.
