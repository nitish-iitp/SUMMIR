Preview

Australia will lock horns against India in the Super 8 Group 1 match of the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia. Following a 21-run loss against Afghanistan in their previous match, Australia have found themselves in a hole in their bid to reach the semifinal of the tournament. Meanwhile, India, who have been unbeaten in the T20 World Cup 2024, still need to be at their best to secure their passage through to the top 4.

Pitch Report

The pitches at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia, have given the opportunity to the batters to score big runs in the T20 World Cup 2024, proving to be the best conditions to bat in the tournament. With that, the average first innings score of 166 might not prove to be enough for India or Australia to defend, when they take the field in their final Super 8 Group 1 match of the tournament.

Team Analysis

Australia

The Australian batting lineup crumbled under pressure of a run chase on a tricky pitch at the Arnos Vale Stadium in Kingstown, St Vincent, against the Afghanistan cricket team, with only Glenn Maxwell finding a way to put up a fifty on the board. The bowling attack for Australia did enough earlier in their T20 World Cup 2024 match, with Pat Cummins taking a second consecutive hat-trick in the tournament, while Adam Zampa went about his business with metronomical consistency.

Mitchell Marsh (c), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Adam Zampa

India

Indian batting lineup put up a massive score of nearly 200 runs on the board against Bangladesh in their previous T20 World Cup 2024 match, with key contributions from Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Rishabh Pant and Virat Kohli. The bowling lineup was once again quite exceptional for India, with their spearhead Jasprit Bumrah picking up key wickets and giving away nothing to the batters, while Kuldeep Yadav got into the groove, scalping for three Bangladeshi batters.

India squad for T20 World Cup 2024

Match Prediction




Conclusion

Australia are in a desperate need of a win to stay in the hunt for a place in the semifinal of the T20 World Cup 2024, while India aren’t home and dry in the same regard either. With that, these two top teams in world cricket could end up playing a high-quality game of cricket, which could end up in favour of India, owing to more of their players in form in comparison to Australia.
