India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Captains on the mic

Rohit Sharma: Satisfying. We know the opposition and the threat they bring. As a team we did well, kept doing the things we needed to do. Gives us good confidence as a team. 200 is a good score but when you are playing here with wind being a big factor, anything can happen. But I think we used to conditions really well, and it was about individuals doing their job. If was about getting wickets at the right time. (On Kuldeep) We know the strength he has, but we need to use him when necessary. In New York, there were seamer friendly wickets. He had to miss out but we knew he had a big role to play out here. (On semi-final) We don't want to do anything different, play the same way and understand what each person has to do. Play freely and not think too much on what's lying ahead. Not think about the opposition. We have been doing it consistently, just need to continue. (On playing England in semi) It will be a nice match, nothing changes for us as a team.

Mitchell Marsh: Disappointing. It happens in the game of cricket. In the course of 40 overs, there are a lot of small margins. India were the better team, Rohit is a class player. (On Head and Maxwell's batting) Gave us more belief than hope. In a run chase like that if you keep it at 10 an over, we are in the game. India's bowlers were too good though in the end. Come on, Bangladesh now!

25 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Player of the match

Rohit Sharma (92): That's what I have to do (in the powerplay), try and see what the bowlers are doing, play accordingly. They changed their plans and tried to bowl against the breeze. Needed to be smart, was just backing myself to do. You got to understand that bowlers are smart, they are not going to bowl into the breeze. I was thinking to hit everything that was possible. You can access all sides of the field, that is what I was trying to do. It has been a good wicket and you need to back yourself on good wickets, glad that it came off today. I told you that 50s and 100s don't matter to me. Need to put the bowlers under pressure, and you need big scores for that. I tried to access all sides of the field, not just one side.

24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: IND win

Hardik Pandya to bowl the last over. He hasn't the best of the days with the ball, can he wrap it up on a high. 

Pat Cummins goes for a pull in front of square and has found Ravindra Jadeja at deep mid wicket but he's dropped it. "Jadeja of all people," exclaims Ravi Shastri on the comms.

It doesn't matter at the end of the day as India seal their semifinal against England by finishing at the top of the table with a win against Australia. A win by 24 runs. 

23:42 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS set up the Super-8 finale

NOTE: If Australia go past 176 and still lose, Afghanistan will have to beat Bangladesh to pip Australia on the NRR.

Jasprit Bumrah to bowl the penultimate over. Pat Cummins leathers one off a fullish delivery over mid wicket for SIX! 

And Australia get past the 176 mark. 10 runs from the over. 29 needed off the last six balls.

23:31 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Two wickets for Arshdeep in the over!

Another one bites the dust!

Arshdeep Singh to Matthew Wade, angled away from the southpaw, who catches an outside edge off an attempted drive. Kuldeep Yadav at short third takes the catch. 

Tim David strikes down on a hard length delivery and Virat Kohli from long-off gives it a chase but is unable to keep it from reaching the ropes. A couple of wides, a SIX straight down the ground, and Australia are still very much in it. Well, nearly. A full toss, and Tim David outside edges it straight to Jasprit Bumrah at short third. Second wicket in the over. 39 needed from the last two overs.

23:28 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Bumrah claims Head!

This was the matchup that had been premonitioned as one that could hand India the all-important wicket of Travis Head. It may not have come in the powerplay, but Jasprit Bumrah finally gets rid of the danger man (at 76). 

A slower one does the trick. Head goes for the glory but skies it and skipper Rohit Sharma with the safe pair of hands. Fifth wicket for India. 150 up for Australia, 53 needed off the last 18 balls.

Also, FYI: India are through to the semifinals.

23:22 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Arshdeep keeps it in IND's grasp!

Arshdeep Singh back into the attack. A full toss angled in down the leg stump, Travis Head doesn't connect, and Rishabh Pant - as he had in the first over with Warner on strike - has missed out on getting a hold of it with a dive to his right. Four byes. The Indian skipper looks at the grass below in dismay. 

Other than that, it's a fine over from the left-armer. Only seven runs come off it. Australia need 58 off the last 24 balls.

23:14 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Axar strikes!

Axar continues from the other end. First ball, pitched outside off, Stoinis goes for the reverse sweep but locates Hardik Pandya - who has a little scary juggle before claiming it one-handed on the next go - at backward point. Fourth wicket falls for Australia!

Head meanwhile, continues to find boundaries. Pierces one through covers for four. 141/4 after 15 overs. This much is clear, Australia aren't confirming their T20 World Cup semifinal spot tonight. Even a win from here won't be enough if Afghanistan beat Bangladesh tomorrow. 

23:11 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: BOWLED HIM!

Kuldeep Yadav to bowl his last over. First ball: dished outside leg stump, Maxwell dances down the track and goes for a heave but it turns a yarn to beat him and rattle the stumps. A second wicket for the chinaman. Third for India. 

Travis Head though, isn't giving up on the perfect troika of hundreds against India in a year's time across the three formats. Yanks a delivery from outside off on the on side for four. Marcus Stoinis is the new man in. He'll retain the strike for the next over. 135/3 after 14 overs.

23:07 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Axar's superb over

Axar Patel on from the other end. Going round the wicket against Head with his arm ball is an advantageous proposition for India, given Head's vulnerabilities - that haven't showed in any way, shape of form today - on the off stump. A fine over, even Ricky Ponting is in awe of it on the comms, only three runs come off it. AUS are 128/2 after 13 overs.

23:05 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: HEAD claims first boundary off Kuldeep!

Kuldeep Yadav into his third over. He has stood out up and above every other Indian bowler today. No boundary conceded as of the 17rh delivery of his spell today. On the 18th, Travis Head takes the initiative. Slaps him powerfully through the line and at one stage, it had felt like Hardik Pandya at long off had a sniff at it, but it sails over his head for SIX! 125/2 after 12 overs.

23:01 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Maxwell takes the cue

Ravindra Jadeja to bowl for the first time today, and he may not get his second soon. Glenn Maxwell has a go at the left-arm orthodox and pings a maximum and two boundaries. 100 up for Australia. The switch hit is up and running and India may have thought they had a way back into the contest after Marsh's wicket, but the runs have barely stopped flowing. After 11 overs, Australia are 116/2.

22:59 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Fifty for Travis Head

Hardik continues from the other end, and Head continues to feast on the boundaries. 

It's the same old drill: short, wide, slashed through point for four. Then, another shot down long on that runs through the fielder for four. It's Axar Patel, who only moments ago had taken a stunner. It brings fifty up for Head. A hundred in the WTC Final. A hundred in the ODI World Cup final. And a fifty in a virtual knockout for Australia in T20 World Cup. All against India. Travis Head continues to be the biggest nightmare for Rohit Sharma and Co.

At the halfway stage, the score reads 99/2.

22:48 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Axar's one-handed stunner, Kuldeep nabs Marsh

Kuldeep continues from the other end, and boy, does he feel in control of the proceedings out there. A stumping appeal against Mitch Marsh as he lays down for a slog sweep but misses it altogether. He's safe alright. Just four singles off the over, and Marsh goes for a pull off the last ball and OH IT'S STUNNER FROM AXAR PATEL! A ONE HANDED CATCH AT DEEP SQUARE LEG, EXTENDING FULL REACH WITH A JUMP. SEAL IT IN AN ENVELOPE, THAT'S THE CATCH OF THE TOURNAMENT.

The Indians rejoice as the partnership is broken. AUS, 87/2 after nine overs. Glenn Maxwell arrives in the middle.

22:43 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Head rips into Hardik

That angle away from the southpaw once again from Pandya. As he offers too much width outside off, Head slaps the ball down the ground for four. 

Then, a delivery closer to the off stump and shorter, pulled in front of square on the on side for SIX! Oh this is an all too familiar nightmare playing out for India. Travis Head got the better of them in WTC and the ODI World Cup final last year, and now he's doing it in a virtual knockout for the Aussies. He gets to 40 off just 18 balls. After eight overs, Australia are 83/1.

22:38 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Economical start from Kuldeep

Kuldeep Yadav into the attack. He was the pick of the bowlers for India the other day. India will need a wicket from him here. Marsh goes for an ambitious sweep shot but catches a top edge that ricochets off his helmet. A quick concussion test follows. But this has been a mighty better over for India since that first one from Arshdeep. Just the four runs come off it. AUS are 69/1 after seven. 

22:34 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Head smothers Pandya for two sixes!

Hardik Pandya takes over from the other end, replacing Jasprit Bumrah. A wide to start the over. Travis Head on strike, and Pandya has decided to opt for the angle from over the wicket. 

Dishes one in full and on the off stump, met with a straight-batted loft over the bowler's head for SIX! Fifty up for Australia. Fifty partnership up between these two. This has been some counter attack following Warner's wicket and a couple of reprieves for the Australian skipper. Have India costed themselves the game with those couple of fumbles?

Hardik wraps up the over with a replica of the delivery India had to fetch from the stands. Head makes this one sail into the orbit again. A six to close the over. End of the powerplay, the score reads 65/1.

22:28 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Boundaries continue to pour

Spin introduced into the attack by Rohit Sharma. Axar Patel to Mitchell Marsh. Starts off with a couple of dot balls before Marsh frees his arms with a pull flat over square leg for SIX. 

Another sweep shot comes, behind square, and it's just gone over Kuldeep Yadav for four down backward square leg for four. 12 runs come from the over. 48/1 after five, AUS.

22:24 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Bumrah mauled by Head

Jasprit Bumrah to Travis Head. Length, offered room outside off stump, and the southpaw slashes it through the off side for his first boundary. And just like that, the momentum has shifted in favor of the batting team. 

Next up, Bumrah drags back his length and is dealt with a pull shot for four more. Australia on the offensive here. Two boundaries to start the over. Bumrah goes yorker length outside the off stump: a dot ball.

He has attempted the same off the fourth delivery but this time, it's ended up being a low full toss, slashed again for four more. Third in the over. Bumrah then shifts to an off cutter. A single picked. Marsh retains the strike with another off the last ball. 36/1 after four overs.

22:19 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Marsh offered another lifeline

Arshdeep Singh continues from the other end. Mitchell Marsh himself had had a tough day out in the field, that lifeline couldn't have come at a better time for the Australian skipper. 

Arshdeep goes back of a length and Marsh pulls it in front of square down mid wicket for four. His first boundary of the day. And then.....another lifeline.

This one was a tough catch to nab, hit straight back at the bowler but it was at a decent height. The left-armer however, isn't able to close his reverse cup - Australian way - in time. 

It's costed India 10 runs, for now. A four and a six follow as Marsh brings the run rate slightly up. 22/1 after three overs.

22:14 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Pant stumbles, IND miss out on a second wicket

"Expect a yorker on the off stump," reckons Ricky Ponting as Jasprit Bumrah steams in to bowl his first over with Travis Head on strike. No yorker off the first go, but make no mistake, this is the matchup that's had everyone reeled into this contest. Head has had his fair share of troubles facing anything on his off stump. Can India's Mr. accurate with the ball nail one to claim another wicket here?

For now Mitchell Marsh is on strike, and Bumrah has bamboozled him with a short one but India miss out on a second wicket! Ah, this could've been a huge blow to the Aussies. Short from Bumrah, met with a miscued pull, Rishabh Pant goes for the catch but stumbles midway and is unable to dive for it. Rohit Sharma is livid. AUS, 8/1 after two overs.

22:09 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Arshdeep snaps Warner in first over!

Warner gets Australia off the mark. A back of a length delivery dealt with by rocking back in his crease and meeting it with a punch to square for a couple.

Off the fifth ball - one that kept lower than Warner expected, comes an inside edge that breezes past the stumps and Rishabh Pant is unable to stop it just to his right. First boundary of the innings. 

But it is Arshdeep who has the last laugh. Takes one away from Warner on length, inducing an outside edge and Suryakumar Yadav takes the catch at slips. AUS 6/1 after first over.

22:06 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: The chase begins

In come Travis Head and David Warner. Remember, if Australia chase 206 inside 15.3 overs, they will qualify for the semifinals. If not, India will be assured their spot - top of Group 1. 

Arshdeep Singh has the new ball, as he has had all through this tournament. Off we go in St. Lucia...

21:58 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: IND 205/5 (20 overs) vs AUS in St Lucia

That's the innings done and dusted. It is a lot of runs for Australia to chase thanks to Rohit Sharma who has arguably played one of the best innings by an Indian batter in T20 World Cups. The pitch will get slower and India has three spinners up their sleeve and both Arshdeep-Bumrah duo have slower balls. The only way Australia has a chance in this game is if Travis Head and David Warner go on a rampage in Powerplay and score around 60-70 if not and they fall behind the rate and lose a couple they have to make sure that they won't lose by a huge margin and get as close as target to possible and expect a favor from Bangladesh later where they face Afghanistan. 

21:50 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 19.2 overs IND 196/5

Shivam Dube trying to clip one on the ball on the leg side timed it too well to David Warner and India lost their fifth wicket. However, the concerning thing for Australia despite the wicket is the score. Just when things were getting better for Australia Hardik Pandya started to go after the bowling with a couple of sixes. India will cross 200 in all probability and given the way the last few overs have panned out there a clear signs of batting getting difficult against softer balls which Australia needs to go all guns blazing in powerplay which implies they have to attack Jasprit Bumrah. 

21:39 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 17.1 overs IND 173/4

A special mention to Josh Hazelwood amidst all the carnage he has stuck to his guns. He kept bowling the stump-to-stump line and hitting hard length with odd variations from time to time and has excellent figures in the game of 1-14. Wonder how different things might have been if Marsh had taken that gamble early on in the innings and bowled out Hazelwood while Rohit was going. Anyway, a discussion for another time. As of now, Marsh needs to get his catching right as he just dropped Hardik Pandya who tried to hit Zampa through covers and got the outside edge, and Marsh at point in the ring dropped it. 

21:28 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 14.5 overs IND 161/4

Suryakumar Yadav has got his innings going now he is playing some sublime shots. As we update Starc picks Surya. It was a slower one wide outside the off-stump the batter tried to reach it and work the ball into the point region got the edge and Wade took a simple catch. Surya did his job though he played an innings needed by him under the situation. Hardik Pandya has walked into the middle and it is a perfect situation for him. He has enough time to get adjusted to the pace of the pitch and also smack the bowlers all over the park in the final over. 

21:19 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 13 overs IND 142/3

Starc picked Rohit eventually. It was an incoming delivery which Rohit tried to work on leg-side and got bowled. However, he has pushed Australia almost out of the game single-handedly now Shivam Dube and Suryakumar Yadav need to ensure that India gets over 200 around the 210 mark. As per Australia, it is their opportunity to pull this game back by bowling a few slower ones pick a few wickets, and get through tight overs. However, all of it is ifs and buts for Australia as things are already looking very gloomy for them. with momentum gone and Marsh looking puzzled.

21:08 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10.4 overs IND 121/2

That was a lengthy drinks break from Australia. It was five minutes unusual in a T20I game might have been plenty of discussions between the coaching staff and captain Marsh on how they would like to go in the back half of the innings. Pat Cummins is one bowler in this attack who has been in good form in T20 cricket and he is the bowler he needs to pull things back. One more thing Australia can do is keep Rohit away from strike as much as possible and break the momentum of his innings. However, even with the ball softer ball Rohit's timing is looking flawless. 

20:58 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 9.2 overs IND 107/2

Rishabh Pant advanced down the track to hit Stoinis through the mid-wicket region and got the leading edge and the ball carried to the long-on fielder. What a waste of opportunity from Pant given the game situation he had a chance to make a score of substance however, not to be today. Suryakumar Yadav has walked into the middle and the problem for Marsh now is given the way Rohit is going if Surya joins the assault India will post a score and Australia needs something spectacular and innings of a lifetime to pull off the chase. 

20:49 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7.4 overs IND 92/1

India is scoring over 10s. Yes, this has been better for batting but Australia has given away far too many runs here in the first seven overs. The moment score goes beyond 180 it will be an uphill task for Marsh's side. It is Marsh who has won the toss and opted to bowl first which has brought them to their current predicament. While Starc has not executed his deliveries well Cummins and other bowlers have been taken apart by Rohit. The worst part for Marsh is Rohit is only accelerating and Marsh might consider bringing back Hazelwood for an over. 

20:41 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 5.5 overs IND 59/1

Rohit Sharma got to 50 in just 19 balls what an innings it has been from the Indian skipper. If the team needed an example on how to play attacking cricket in big games Rohit has shown it in the first five overs. There is something paradoxical about Rohit's batting while he is not muscling the ball like Andre Russell or Kieron Pollard to get the ball for six he does with his elegant, effortless and silky touch he has been able to score mammoth sixes. Now it will be interesting to see what Marsh will do it is not something he would have expected after winning the toss and opting to bowl first given the experience of his bowlers. 

20:29 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 4.1 overs IND 43/1

Well, rain has arrived and he stopped the play the most frustrated person in the entire stadium would be Rohit Sharma. He was hitting massive sixes with brutal elegance. He already has five sixes and is nearly striking at 300. This is the start India wanted and Australia getting a bit of treatment of their own medicine which is to come as hard and aggressive as possible at the opposition in the big game. As we update rain has stopped sun is out the action might start soon. We have to wait and see how much of an impact the break will have in Rohit's innings. 

20:19 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 3.1 overs IND 35/1

It was clever bowling from Hazelwood he slipped in a short one and Kohli played right into the hands of the bowler by pulling into the breeze and the ball went nowhere and was caught at mid-wicket. Another failure for Kohli in the tournament. Meanwhile, Rohit is climbing onto Starc here it has become a bit too predictable from Starc all he is trying to do is target the pads of Rohit and get him LBW because of the breeze across. But Rohit Sharma clearing his front leg is just giving the ball the direction accordingly and because of the extreme pace from Starc, it is flying through. As it turns out it is the most expensive over from Starc giving away 29 runs.

20:09 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 1.4 overs IND 6/1

Mitchell Starc took the new ball and started with a full toss. He is bowling it outside the off-stump hoping that the breeze across will bring the ball back into the right-handers. That is a clever tactic from Mitchell Marsh he also has a field set up for that. He might consider bringing in a close-in fielder around sill mid-on just to sow the seed of doubt in batters of a slower one being around the corner. As per Rohit, he is going to bat in his ultra-aggressive method irrespective of the bowler and team and he has shown the first sign of it when skewed through the leg-side. As we update Virat Kohli departs.

19:59 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: let's go!

The national anthems are done it is a bit dark but the sky is blue as of now and there is a steady breeze across the ground. Once again like Bangladesh skipper Shanto on Saturday, it is an interesting choice from Mitchell Marsh to bowl first in day game. If there is no rain the pitch will slow down and crumble hence it is a brave call from the Australian skipper today given their situation in the tournament. 

19:54 (IST)
24 JUN 2024
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Group 1 scenarios

For India to secure qualification, they simply need to beat Australia or avoid a heavy defeat in St Lucia on Monday.

As for Australia, Mitchell Marsh’s side (+0.223) can still pip Afghanistan (-0.650) on net run rate with a win over India. If Australia are to overhaul India and take the first spot, they will need a big win

Afghanistan’s NRR equations will boil down to the result of the India-Australia contest, following which they take on Bangladesh in Kingstown.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma at toss

We would have fielded first as well, looks a bit sticky. We wanted to chase. We know what exactly we are doing, will try to do our best. I hope it doesn't change much. The overhead conditions also matter in this part of the world. We have adapted well, hopefully another game where we put up a show. Every game matters in this tournament, nothing changes. We are playing the same team.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Mitchell Marsh at toss

We are going to bowl first. Looks a belter, it looks lovely. It's a quarte final, looking forward to it, big challenge against India. We have had ourselves in this situation before, every game is a must-win now. We got an experienced group, a great staff. Starc comes in for Agar.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Afghanistan associates no more

Marsh was all praise for Afghanistan, stating that they can are no longer an associate nation.

“Obviously, they’re a good side. And they’re not an Associate nation, they’re a very good cricket team who play against the best all the time and they have improved a hell of a lot over the last few years. They outplayed us tonight and credit to them,” he said.

The win in Kingstown was Afghanistan’s first-ever against Australia in any format of the game.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Mitch Marsh on India-Australia Super-8 match: ‘We just need to win and there’s no better team to do it against’

A loss against Afghanistan on Sunday meant Australia’s chances at making it to the T20 World Cup semifinals hang by a thread. Sitting in Group 1, the 2021 winners are currently second but have as many points after two matches as Afghanistan.

A defeat in the next game could lead to an early exit for a team that have been touted as one of the favorites to go all the way. Skipper Mitchell Marsh believes the task at hand is simple.

“We just need to win,” Marsh said after the loss to Afghanistan, before adding, “there’s no better team to do it against.”

While Australia faced their first loss on Sunday, India remain unbeaten. Rohit Sharma and Co had made it to the knockouts on the back of three wins in the group stages that also featured a washout against Canada. In the Super-8, India have two wins from as many games, the latest having come on Saturday against Bangladesh – taking them to the top of Group 1.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: India needs to be wary

But for all their failings, Rohit Sharma and Co would not be conceited in believing that they could just turn up and send them packing home. Rather, they are all too familiar with the steel and defiance of Australians, the match-winners in the midst, and of course Head. Despite his flaws (and many others), he has prospered, which should warn forewarn India’s seamers. They could relive his away-seamer nightmare, just as Head could make India rekindle their own old nightmares too. This sets up a suspenseful contest, unexpected though it was. Thanks largely to Afghanistan.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Australian bowler woes

On a similar vein, bowlers have struggled to put on a concerted show. Pat Cummins’s hat-tricks in successive games have masked the frugal returns of Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood (three wickets each, economy rates of 7.88 and 6.55, respectively). Part-timers Glenn Maxwell and Stoinis have often chimed in with wickets, but Cummins and Adam Zampa have often felt isolated. Sloppy fielding and catching have confounded the audience as much as the adversaries. The usual spark has gone AWOL.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Australia slipping

In contrast, Australia have been slipping from one weakness to another with every passing game. They have less than 36 hours to soak the shock of the Afghanistan defeat and muster the wits to compete against the most competent side of the tournament. The middle order has been as brittle as the colourful shacks in the Caribbean islands during a cyclone. Tim David and Matthew Wade have collected only 72 runs between them; captain Mitchell Marsh has eked out only 88 runs in six outings. Openers David Warner and Head (their top two run-getters), blasters Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell have shouldered much of their batting burden. Surges of inspiration have been rare and collective performances rarer.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: India peaking

In this backdrop of the Sunday mayhem, India would walk into the picturesque Daren Sammy Stadium as the calmer side. They have reached a day earlier, bossing their adversaries and peaking insidiously as the tournament has rolled along. With every passing game, India have looked unbreakable, fixing every troubleshoot on the go. The openers, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, hit their straps against Bangladesh; installing Rishabh Pant at No 3 has been a masterstroke; Hardik Pandya has dusted off his IPL dust and begun to influence games as a genuine all-rounder would, with the bat and ball. Seamers have terrorised batsmen every game, and the spin trio has settled into rhythm too. It’s a travesty if they are not addressed as the red-hot favourites to hoist the trophy. On Monday, too, the odds would heavily favour them, despite the format’s fickleness.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Group 1 scenarios

For India to secure qualification, they simply need to beat Australia or avoid a heavy defeat in St Lucia on Monday.

As for Australia, Mitchell Marsh’s side (+0.223) can still pip Afghanistan (-0.650) on net run rate with a win over India. If Australia are to overhaul India and take the first spot, they will need a big win

Afghanistan’s NRR equations will boil down to the result of the India-Australia contest, following which they take on Bangladesh in Kingstown.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rain likely to play spoilsport in St Lucia

A washout would suit India just fine, sealing their semi-final spot, but not so for Australia.

A third straight win for India will not only make them the group toppers and send them to the semifinals, it will also substantially threaten Australia’s chances of progressing through to the semi-finals following the unexpected loss to Afghanistan.

According to Accuweather, rain is expected to come down heavily in St Lucia for almost the entire day. Heavy showers are expected before the India vs Australia match begins at 10:30 AM local time.

The forecast indicates a 15% chance of rain during the match, with light showers and possible thunderstorms posing a continuous threat.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup: Bumrah alone cannot win the World Cup

Despite the form of Bumrah, Ambrose opines that he alone can not help India win the World Cup he also needs the support of other bowlers. “He has the skill and ability but this is a team game. So he cannot do anything alone. Apart from this, if the batter does not score runs then India can lose. Therefore, this is a team game but despite this, he can play a big and important role in the victory.”

IND vs AUS, T20 World Cup: Head’s troubles in focus as powerhouses meet in high stakes clash on back of contrasting outings

In the last two major ICC games between the two sides, Head had single-handedly lopped off India’s ambitions. (AP)

The ball would haunt Travis Head in his nightmares. The white sphere of leather arrowing into his middle stump, landing on good length, or slightly fuller, before seaming away, rerouting as though guided by a GPS just adequately to beat his feet-in-cement swipe. When Naveen-ul-Haq blasted his stumps with a similar ball, he might have only felt a sense of deja vu. Several faces would have flashed through his head—Jofra Archer (this World Cup), Mitchell Starc and Arshdeep Singh (IPL 2024) – from the last month alone.

Awareness of a flaw is one thing; executing is the more tedious bit, India’s seamers would know. In the last two major ICC games between the two sides, Head had single-handedly lopped off India’s ambitions. Centuries of outrageous derring-do in the World Test Championship and 50-over World Cup finals needn’t any reopening; they flinch as unhealed wounds in the mind of the nation. Now Australia would hope their maverick opener would perform a triple-peat, just as India’s bowlers would sniff an overdue revenge. (Read more from Sandip G)
