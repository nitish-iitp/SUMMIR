        "Afghanistan's win over Australia has opened the gates of qualification for all 4 teams in Group 1.",
        "India have the least chance of getting knocked out among the four teams. With a positive NRR of 2.425, a win against Australia will confirm their spot in the semis.",
        "Australia must beat India with a good margin in order to boost their NRR as much as possible. If they chase the target in 14-16 overs or win by 35-40 runs, they can even overtake India in NRR.",
        "Afghanistan\u2019s inspiring win against Australia has kept them in the semis race and also has given them the luxury of potentially deciding the fate of both Australia and India.",
        "Bangladesh's chances of qualifications open up only if India hammer Australia by a massive margin like 80-90 runs."
