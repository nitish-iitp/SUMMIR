        "India, who have been unbeaten in the T20 World Cup 2024, still need to be at their best to secure their passage through to the top 4.",
        "The pitches at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia, have given the opportunity to the batters to score big runs in the T20 World Cup 2024, proving to be the best conditions to bat in the tournament.",
        "The average first innings score of 166 might not prove to be enough for India or Australia to defend, when they take the field in their final Super 8 Group 1 match of the tournament.",
        "The Australian batting lineup crumbled under pressure of a run chase on a tricky pitch at the Arnos Vale Stadium in Kingstown, St Vincent, against the Afghanistan cricket team, with only Glenn Maxwell finding a way to put up a fifty on the board.",
        "The bowling attack for Australia did enough earlier in their T20 World Cup 2024 match, with Pat Cummins taking a second consecutive hat-trick in the tournament, while Adam Zampa went about his business with metronomical consistency.",
