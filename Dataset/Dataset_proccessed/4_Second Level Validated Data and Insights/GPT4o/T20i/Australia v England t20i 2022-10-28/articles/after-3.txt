Match No.26 of T20 World Cup 2022 between England and Australia on Friday, October 28 had to be abandoned due to rain without a single ball being bowled.

Melbourne has been experiencing heavy rainfall and it’s the second match on the day that couldn't take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Earlier in the day, the Super 12 Group 1 match between Ireland and Afghanistan couldn’'t take place due to relentless rain.

Rain played hide and seek, leading to a delay in the start of the match between the Aussies and the Three Lions. The rain had stopped for a brief while before it started to pour down yet another time.

At 15:18 IST, the match was abandoned, thereby leading England and Australia to share one point apiece. The British team is currently played second in the points table with a net run rate of 0.239.

The Aussies, on the other hand, are fourth in the table with a net run rate of -1.555. While England beat the Afghans in their first game, the Aussies secured a victory against Sri Lanka following their loss at the hands of Kane Williamson's New Zealand.

The Black Caps, in the meantime, remain at the top of the points table with three points and a net run rate of 4.450. The Kiwis are the only team in their group who are yet to lose a match in the tournament.

Afghanistan, led by Mohammad Nabi, have been hard done by after both their previous two matches couldn't take place due to indifferent weather in Australia.
