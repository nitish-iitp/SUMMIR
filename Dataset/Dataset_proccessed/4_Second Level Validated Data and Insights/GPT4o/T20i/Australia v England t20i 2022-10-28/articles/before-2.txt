Australia's top order has not shown very good form so far. David Warner has scored 16 runs in two matches, while Mitchell Marsh has scored just 34 runs. Aaron Finch scored 31 runs in the last match, but during this, his strike rate was 73.81. 

Marcus Stoinis is the top run scorer for the hosts. Stoinis played an explosive inning of 59 runs in the last match. Glenn Maxwell also scored 23 runs in 12 balls against Sri Lanka.

Apart from him Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Adam Zampa, Ashton Agar, and Glenn Maxwell have taken a wicket each but has not been impressive so far.

England has been dealt a big blow after facing a shocking defeat at the hands of Ireland in the last match where the English side got completely tarnished due to their deceptive and disgraceful play.

So far the English batsmen have not been able to score big runs in the tournament. The team's top scorer is David Malan (53) has played a slow inning of 35 runs in 37 balls in the previous match. 

Jos Buttler has scored just 18 runs in two matches, while star all-rounder Ben Stokes has scored just 8 runs from the bat. The big names of the England team have failed to score big runs, for which the team has to bear the brunt.

England bowlers have been doing well as Sam Curran is the leading wicket-taker with 7 wickets in the tournament. Fast bowler Mark Wood has taken 5 wickets in his name, while Ben Stokes and Liam Livingstone took 3 wickets each.
