England coach bemoans decision not to use Marvel Stadium after MCG washout

What MCG washout means for Aussies

The ICC has come under fire for not securing Melbourne's Marvel Stadium as a back-up venue after Australia's game against England at the T20 World Cup was washed out on Friday night.

The match was called off without a ball being bowled, after the umpires and captains inspected the pitch and the heavy outfield and opted to not go ahead with proceedings.

It was the fourth match of the tournament to be abandoned without a result, with the game between New Zealand and Afghanistan at the MCG abandoned earlier in the week.

The T20 World Cup has been heavily affected by rain, prompting discussion about whether Marvel Stadium, which has a roof, should have been set aside as an emergency venue for the tournament.

"The frustrating thing is there's a stadium down the road that has a roof so you can play cricket there," England coach Jonathan Trott said.

"We could have had lots of cricket. But it does mean the tournament is unpredictable with lots of must-win games coming up."

The decision not to use Marvel Stadium has left those in the game shaking their head especially since it has a capacity of 53,000 and is the home ground of the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash.

Although the venue has hosted just 12 international matches in its history and none since 2006.

"It's tough. Afghanistan have had two games washed out in a tournament where you potentially play only five matches," England captain Jos Buttler said.

"It's frustrating for all of us. Is there something you could look at – I don't know if you could elongate the tournament, for example?

"The umpires had some big concerns about the conditions and rightly so. The outfield was very wet and there were some areas inside the 30-yard circle that weren't fit to play.

"We all want to play cricket but it has to be safe and it certainly wasn't. The right call was made. We play an open-air sport and the elements are a huge part of what makes it unique.

"It's a shame tonight, especially for everybody involved.

"Australia against England at the MCG in a must-win match is as big as it gets in your career.

"They're the games you want to be involved in, no matter whatever the result is going to be." You don't know how often those opportunities will come around."

Australian coach Andrew McDonald said the MCG is everybody's first choice it was just plain bad luck with the conditions.

"Everyone wants to play at the MCG, you can't predict the weather. There's probably no better place you'd want to be playing than the MCG," he said.

The washout leaves Australia in a precarious spot, with the host nation needing to win its remaining two games against Ireland and Afghanistan, improve its net run rate and hope England loses to New Zealand.

New Zealand, England, Ireland and Australia are locked on three points while Sri Lanka is on two points in Group 1.

New Zealand and Sri Lanka, who will take on one another in Sydney on Saturday, both have a game in hand.
