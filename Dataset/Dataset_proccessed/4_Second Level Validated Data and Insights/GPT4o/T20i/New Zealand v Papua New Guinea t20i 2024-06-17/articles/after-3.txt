'I'm glad we made it over the line'
published at 19:42 British Summer Time 17 June 2024
19:42 BST 17 June 2024

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson: "The boys did well today. Whatever target you're chasing on that surface is going to be a grind, I'm glad we made it over the line.

"Whenever you come to any tournament you want to start strong, conditions have been challenging and adapting faster was important - we played two strong teams with good experience of these conditions. We have a number of players in this side who'll be around for a long time and will be all the better from playing on these pitches.

"There are a few older guys, the likes of Trent, a great servant of our game and the world game, consistent in all formats. It'll be sad to see him go, it's been quite special being with him throughout his career.

"He's got such an attitude for getting better. He trains very hard, he's as fit as he's ever been. He knows how he wants to operate in all formats. He sticks his chest out and performs well for his country. He's made a fantastic contribution to our game and he's created a space for new players to come in and meet the standard that he's set."

Papua New Guinea captain Assad Vala: "There's lots of learning we can take away from this game, especially the batting aspect of the game. The other bowlers have been challenging, but we gave our best.

"We believed we could do well but there were some areas we struggled. They hit the wicket really hard and we tried to adapt as quickly as possible.

"With the World Cup what we have done over the last month has been great. Hopefully we can improve and start winning more games in the future."

Trent Boult is working his way his way around the boundary, signing things and posing for photos.

It's his last game in the format for New Zealand, and probably his last ever. How many more of this ageing Black Cap side will play again in this competition?

There might be a few more goodbyes here than just Boult, knowingly or otherwise.

Player of the match Lockie Ferguson: "It was a tough wicket to bat on. There aren't many game when I just bowl seam up the whole way through. The pitch offered lots of assistance.

"It's nice to get the win, but unfortunate to be heading home.

"We've felt like we bowled pretty well, but losing to Afghanistan and West Indies ruined our World Cup."

Job done. New Zealand played really well on a tough wicket. Papua New Guinea can hold their head high with the talent they have in their squad.

The players shake hands, lots of smiles and arms around shoulders. Both sides are heading home, but New Zealand have their second victory - they finished in third in Group C, two points short of the West Indies.

Papua New Guinea take the long flight home without a win, but will be pleased they offered some resistance in this New Zealand innings.

And that's that!

Mitchell can't get Morea's first ball away, but he dispatches the second - it looks like it's sailing away for a six over the long-off boundary but it actually drops just short, evading the fielder who's run back from mid-off.

No matter, the batters run two and that's the game.

Daryl Mitchell has turned himself into a remarkable batter in all three formats. He's a powerful man to muscle that ball over cover.

Make that three, lifting the ball over the cover ring and away to the boundary.

Target 79

A seventh bowler now for Papua New Guinea - it's the end of their tournament, everyone gets a go.

This time it's Norman Vanua and his delivery rears up on Kane Williamson and strikes him painfully on the gloves.

The New Zealand captain gets his revenge, whipping Vanua away square for four.

New batter Daryl Mitchell can't get Kamea away from his first three balls, but finds two by turning the final delivery of the over behind square.

Half-way through, New Zealand need 23 more runs. The players will take drinks.

Kamea has got through. That did look like there might've been some bat involved and it did come in sharply. Lovely bowling from Kamea. It looks out to me.

Conway lbw b Kamea 35 (NZ 54-3)

He will!

Semo Kamea's delivery kept a little low and perhaps surprised Conway a little, striking him on the pads right in front of the stumps.

Ball tracking has contact with middle and leg, the New Zealand opener has to go.

But will Conway now have to depart?

He's given out lbw on the field, but has sent it upstairs.
