Virat Kohli hit 3 sixes and a boundary as he hit his 31st fifty in T20I cricket. Kohli was looking to be proactive but he was not able to time the ball well in the first half of the Indian innings. However, the former captain cut loose after joining hands with Suryakumar Yadav, who went berserk for a 26-ball 68.

Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav stitched a partnership of 98 runs in just 7 overs as India finished with 192 for 2 at the end of 20 overs against Hong Kong. Suryakumar hit 6 sixes and as many boundaries, including 4 sixes in the final over, as India raced from 94 for 2 at the end of the 13th over to post 192.

With his 31st T20I fifty and his first in the format since the home series against the West Indies in February, Virat Kohli equalled Rohit Sharma's record for the most number of fifty-plus scores in T20I cricket.

While Virat Kohli has 31 fifties in T20Is, Rohit Sharma has 27 fifties and 4 hundreds.
