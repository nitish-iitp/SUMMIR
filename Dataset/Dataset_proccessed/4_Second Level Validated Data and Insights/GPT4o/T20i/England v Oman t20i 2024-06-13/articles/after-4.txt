Overnight in the UK, Afghanistan can reach the Super 8s if they beat Papua New Guinea. Tomorrow, the US will book their place in the last eight if they beat Ireland.

So the 101 balls England has remaining is a World Cup record. It's not close to the overall international T20 record, though. Spain once chased a target of 11 to beat Isle of Man in two deliveries (yes, two sixes), meaning there was a whopping 118 to go.

'We can only focus on ourselves'

England captain Jos Buttler: "I thought the tone was set really well by the bowlers, picking up the early wickets. Job done today, another big game in two days' time.

"There was that extra bounce, Topley with his height and Jofra with his high release point. They're really challenging bowlers on this surface, and they bowled a good line and length.

"I don't think any of us expected the wicket to play like it did, it looked a really good wicket but Rashid found spin."

On approach to the chase: "Be ultra positive, we've spoken about how we have to win games and if we have a chance take advantage of the net run-rate and we did that today."

On media reaction to tournament so far: "I've been around long enough to know how things work. We know our dressing room, we have confidence. We can only focus on ourselves, we've got a huge game against Namibia."

Oman captain Aqib Ilyas: "We couldn't do well in the batting, it was a big collapse and big exposure. Overall we couldn't do much.

"There are still many positives and you just have to get better and better. Once in a year you play against bowlers doing 150-plus with a top fielding side batting into good areas.

"Our batters were more under pressure playing against a top side. We had a bad shot selection unfortunately. Throughout the tournament our bowlers have done really well.

"We can learn a lot from the top players on how things work and how we can get better. When you come across such top players you get to learn and know where you stand. If you want to bring an impact you have to work on yourself a lot."

In case you're wondering about the weather for the Australia v Scotland game, the weekend forecast is 32 degrees in St Lucia. Small chance of rain, but nothing that should be concerning for England.

Remember, England's next assignment is against Namibia at 18:00 BST on Saturday. Win then, and the pressure is on Scotland.

Man of the match Adil Rashid: "I thought we bowled exceptionally well. It was nice to bowl them out for 48.

"It's always nice to see the ball spin. It sets the tone. I try to adjust in the first over. Thankfully it worked today.

"I'm very happy with the way we bowled as a team. We're taking it a game at a time. Our job is to go out next time, do our thing, and hopefully the rest takes care of itself."

England are just flexing their muscles here. A determined England on a better surface have really turned up.

There's still work to do for England. They've got to beat Namibia and hope Scotland don't get anything off Australia, but they're doing all they can with the NRR.

England have won this game at the 3.1 over mark they have chased this game so ruthlessly and have boosted their net run rate.
