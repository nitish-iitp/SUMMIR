There are two games in the wee small hours of Monday morning that will decide who takes the last place in the Super 8s.

At 00:30 BST, Bangladesh play Nepal and starting an hour later, the Netherlands take on Sri Lanka.

A Bangladesh win will guarantee their place, while the Netherlands must beat Sri Lanka and hope that Bangladesh slip up. We'll have coverage of both games.

For now, here is Sam Drury's report of Pakistan's nervy win over Ireland.

Thanks for joining us today.

'We have not performed as a team'

Pakistan win by three wickets

Pakistan captain Babar Azam: “When we started with the bowling, we got ahead. In the batting, we didn’t finish well but when you have back-to-back wickets, you have to go to the end with the tailenders."

On tournament as a whole: “With the bowling, we are good but in the batting we had a few mistakes in the US match and the India match. When you lose wickets, it puts you under pressure but a lot of positives with the bowling.

“We have a good bunch of players. Let’s go home and see where we’ve lacked, where we’re not good enough.

“Positives are that we had close games but didn’t finish well. We have good players but we have not performed as a team.”

'Proud of the fight we showed'

Pakistan win by three wickets

Ireland captain Paul Stirling: "We played in patches. We didn't start the day terribly well and they put pressure on us early on. I think that was the difference in the end.

"With the ball you can throw the towel in and lose by eight wickets but we didn't. I'm proud of the fight we showed."

On batting issues: "It's about getting that balance right. In T20 cricket you need that tempo. Sometimes we've gone too hard, other times not hard enough.

"It's been a difficult couple of weeks. But we'll go back and regroup."

How must Pakistan rue that defeat to the USA? But the brutal nature of a four game group meant that made a huge difference, but the Super 8s are going to be fascinating.

Three matches, three defeats and a washout. I really don't think it's indicative of where the Irish men's team is at the moment.

Ireland have been rejuvenated under Paul Stirling.

Shaheen Afridi bowled superbly at the top of Ireland's innings, but I didn't see him winning it with the bat if I'm honest. Another 20 runs, and who knows?

This was a difficult group, a sort of group of death and Ireland have come out of it with nothing.

I said that the Ireland innings was all over the place, and the Pakistan chase more than matched it!

So many of these World Cup games have been erratic, but is that a bad thing? I don't think so.

Not a bad over for a fill-in bowler, but 14 off three overs seems gettable as Ben White returns.
