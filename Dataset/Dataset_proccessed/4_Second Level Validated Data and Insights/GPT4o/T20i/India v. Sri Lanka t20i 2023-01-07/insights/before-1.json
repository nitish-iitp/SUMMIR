        "India will first face the Sri Lankan team in 2023. Sri Lanka will tour the Indian subcontinent for a three-match T20I series and then, a three-match ODI series. Occurring in India, the white-ball series will provide opportunities to many young and talented Indians. Although the Sri Lankan team might rank at the bottom of the table in the ICC team rankings, India will not be underestimating the last Asia Cup champions."
