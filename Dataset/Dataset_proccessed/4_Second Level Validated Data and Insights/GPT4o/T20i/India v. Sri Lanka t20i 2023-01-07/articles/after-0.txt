Suryakumar Yadav has earned the plaudits of his skipper Hardik after playing a match-winning knock of 112 not out of 51 balls to power India to a 91-run win over Sri Lanka in the third and final T20I to clinch the three-match series 2-1 here at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium on Saturday.

"He has been surprising everyone and making everyone know that batting is very easy. If I am a bowler, I will be disheartened with the shot he plays. He has played blinders after blinders," said Hardik Pandya about Suryakumar Yadav in the post-match presentation ceremony.
