Suryakumar Yadav scored 112 runs vs Sri Lanka in Rajkot
Yadav got to his half-century off 26 balls

Suryakumar Yadav, on Saturday, January 7, hit his 3rd hundred in T20Is to leave the cricket fraternity awestruck. The right-hander smashed the second-fastest T20I hundred by an Indian batter of 45 balls, going past KL Rahul, who got to a 46-ball century against the West Indies back in 2016 in Lauderhill.

Suryakumar came to bat after India lost the wickets of Ishan Kishan and Rahul Tripathi in the powerplay. From there on, he didn’t look back and got to his half-century off 26 balls. He was also involved in a partnership of 113 runs along with Shubman Gill, who scored 46 off 36 balls after failing in the first two matches of the series.

Suryakumar is also one of the two Indian batters to score three or more hundreds in T20Is. Rohit Sharma is on top of the list with four hundreds for the Men in Blue in the shortest format of the game. Among the big names, Glenn Maxwell and Colin Munro have three T20I hundreds to show for their efforts.

In the meantime, the likes of Wasim Jaffer, Ian Bishop, Kamran Akmal, Unmukt Chand, Aakash Chopra and many others heaped praise on Yadav for playing the masterful knock against Sri Lanka at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot.

Malinga took to Twitter and wrote, “This is pure entertainment. A T20 batting masterclass from SKY. Loved watching every minute of it even though it was against SL. World’s best by far!”

Bishop wrote, “Imagine Suryakumar Yadav debuted 6 years ago. Would he be as good or has a debut at age 30 worked in his favor?”

Jaffer wrote, “Best in the world! And makes it look ridiculously easy. Well played.”
