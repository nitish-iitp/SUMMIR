What to expect from Group B
JUNE 05, 2024 00:19
Match abandoned!

The news that we all dreaded is in: the match has been called off due to rain. 

109 would have made for a tricky chase for sure but that’s that for tonight. Both teams take home a point.

JUNE 05, 2024 00:03
The rain returns

The covers, sadly, are back over the pitch. The start of the second innings has been delayed.

JUNE 04, 2024 23:59
England needs 109 to win

The revised target for England will be 109. That is almost 11 an over. Munsey and Jones manage to add 39 runs off the final 22 deliveries to post a health target for the defending champion. England will need a mighty effort to pull off a victory against its neighbour.

JUNE 04, 2024 23:54

SCO 90/0 in 10 overs

Adil Rashid to bowl the final over. A single to Jones on the first. Munsey tries a reverse sweep but the ball stays low and beats him. A single to deep mid wicket off the third ball. A slog sweep comes off the toe end of Jones’ bat, a single to long on. A quick single off the fifth again. FOUR! Jones shuffles across to get in line and slog sweeps between square leg and mid wicket.

JUNE 04, 2024 23:48

SCO 82/0 in 9 overs

Jordan for his second over. Munsey misses an on-side slog on the first delivery. SIX! Pulls away a short delivery behind square. Another slog through the on side, this gets Munsey only a run to deep mid wicket. A precious dot ball. Jones looks to go down the ground, hits it into the surface. Jones misses a heave over mid wicket, gets a leg bye. A full toss, Munsey hits to long on. Jones is getting back for two pretty comfortably until his bat gets stuck into the pitch. A direct hit from the deep prompts a third umpire check but Jones had one foot inside the crease.

JUNE 04, 2024 23:42

SCO 72/0 in 8 overs

Adil Rashid to Jones, SIX! Too full and Jones packs it down the ground. Jones slashes the second to deep cover for one. Munsey misses a sweep and the ball pops up into the air off his pad. Buttler takes the catch and appeals for caught behind. England has taken a review. Nothing on the UltraEdge and England loses its review. FOUR! Reverse sweep and through he goes over extra covers. SIX! Another reverse sweep and this one lands in the stands over mid wicket. Now the sweep to pick a single off the final delivery.

JUNE 04, 2024 23:39
SCO 54/0 in 7 overs

Moeen Ali to resume, four deliveries left in this over. Starts with a dot, Jones looks to step out but Ali keeps it wide. A single on the next to deep covers. Munsey sweeps, gets a top edge which goes over Buttler behind the stumps. Just one from that ball. Jones slaps the last delivery to deep cover for one.

JUNE 04, 2024 23:38
And the players are on the pitch

Jos Buttler leads England out on the field for the second time. Five bowlers allowed to bowl two overs each, meaning Jofra Archer and Mark Wood will not be bowling any more overs.
