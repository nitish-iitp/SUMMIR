Analysis

England kicks off the tournament as the defending champion and the favourites with a stacked squad of quality players. The Three Lions boast of one of the best batting lineups in the world led by captain Jos Buttler, who has found form at the right with aggressive batters around him. Regarding their bowling, Jofra Archer’s return has given the side a massive boost. Archer will be surrounded by a consistent group comprising Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid and Mark Wood, who looked great in the recent few games for England.

On the other hand, Scotland has been one of the most exciting associate teams in the world and made consistent improvements over the years. Talking about the Scottish batting, Southpaw George Munsey will be the lynchpin of their lineup with an aggressive style and incredible ability to score quickly against spin. On the bowling front, Mark Watt, the left-arm spinner, will be crucial with his change of pace and a trademark 24-yard ball. Watt could certainly dominate in the spin-friendly conditions of the Caribbean.
