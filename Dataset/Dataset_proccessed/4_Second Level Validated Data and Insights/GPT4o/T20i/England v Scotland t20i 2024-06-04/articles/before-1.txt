Preview

England will lock horns against Scotland in the Group B match of the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. The defending champions England will be looking to start their campaign on a great note against their near neighbours with a win. For Scotland, it is going to be vital for their big players to stand up against a formidable opponent, to give themselves the best chance of causing an upset in the T20 World Cup 2024. 

Pitch Report

The pitches at the Kensington Oval are considered as the fastest among all the Caribbean nations, which allows the batters and fast bowlers to make a big impact most times, irrespective of the format. The average first innings score at this venue is 156 in T20Is, but England will certainly try and post a total in the range of 200 runs to put Scotland out of the contest if they bat first.

Team Analysis

England

The England captain, Jos Buttler, and his opening partner Phil Salt will have the responsibility to provide fast starts in the powerplay overs, allowing the rest of the batters in the lineup, including Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, to keep the momentum going in the T20 World Cup 2024. In the bowling department, Jofra Archer, who made his return to cricket for England after a long injury layoff, will be playing the role of the enforcer, while Mark Wood and Adil Rashid are also going to be quite important to the team’s cause.
