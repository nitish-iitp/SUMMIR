        "Jones swung Chris Jordan for an 87-metre six which smashed a solar panel on the roof of the stand beyond deep midwicket.",
        "Jones clubbed Adil Rashid's first ball over long-on for six and Munsey chimed in with a four and a six to push the scoring along.",
        "Munsey thrashed the second ball of Jordan's next over the fence at backward square for six.",
        "Jones pulled the last ball through midwicket for four to take his side to 90 without loss."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "An untimely rain squall, followed by a damp spot on the pitch, delayed the start by 55 minutes after Scotland had won the toss and opted to bat.",
        "A much heavier storm arrived to halt proceedings again just two balls after the powerplay with Scotland reaching 51 for nought.",
        "The match had been reduced to 10 overs per side.",
        "As soon as Scotland finished their innings, the rain returned for good and condemned the contest to a wash-out.",
        "Jofra Archer's comeback continued with a two-over spell, the first going for 10 runs, all to Jones.",
        "Archer's second over was much tighter as he deployed his leg-cutter and only conceded two singles."
