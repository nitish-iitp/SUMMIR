WEST INDIES VS SOUTH AFRICA
Rovman Powell to lead West Indies in South Africa T20I series

After losing the two-match Test series by 1-0, Cricket West Indies(CWI) have sidelined several key players for their upcoming T20I series against South Africa. During the South Africa tour of West Indies 2024, a total of two tests and three T20I have been scheduled to be played between August 7 and 27.

Rovman Powell was named as the captain of the West Indies T20I side while Roston Chase will be his deputy.

West Indies powerhouse batter Andre Russell is one of the notable miss from the 15-member squad. It is reported that the allrounder requested CWI not to include him in the squad for the South Africa T20I series.

Russell who was a part of the West Indies squad that missed out on the semi-final berth of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 featured in The Hundred 2024 tournament for London Spirit.

Along with Russell, former skipper Jason Holder has also rested for the South Africa T20I series on account of workload management. During their off-season, the duo will work closely with the CWI science and medicine team.

“Andre Russell requested a period of rest and recovery as well as Jason Holder who played five back-to-back five Tests against England and South Africa. During this period, they will work closely with the CWI science and medicine team,” said Miles Bascombe, Director of Cricket.

West Indies squad for SA T20Is: Rovman Powell (C), Roston Chase (VC), Alick Athanaze, Fabian Allen, Johnson Charles, Matthew Forde, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope, Akeal Hosein, Shamar Joseph, Obed McCoy, Gudakesh Motie, Nicholas Pooran, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd

West Indies head coach Daren Sammy expressed his confidence in the squad they selected for the South Africa T20I series and believes that SA series will be a best opportunity for them to “reset and refocus with their game plan”.

“Facing a strong South Africa side is an excellent opportunity for our team to reset and refocus with our game plan. We have played them recently and had mixed results, so this should be an exciting and important series.

I’m confident in the squad we’ve selected, and with eyes already on the next T20 World Cup in 2026, I know the guys will be keen to show their hunger for success”, said head coach Daren Sammy.

All three T20Is will be played at Brian Lara Stadium, Tarouba, Trinidad on August 23, 24 and 27 respectively.
