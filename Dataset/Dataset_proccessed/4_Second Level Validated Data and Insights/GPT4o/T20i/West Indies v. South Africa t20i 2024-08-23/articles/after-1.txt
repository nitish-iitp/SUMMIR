2. TRISTAN STUBBS

Venue and Pitch

The Brian Lara Stadium at Tarouba in Trinidad has hosted 9 T20Is with the team batting first coming out victorious in 4 of these encounters. The captain who has won the toss has elected to chase first in as many as seven matches, revealing that batting second is the preferred option at the venue. The team which has won the toss has won five matches for a win probability of 55.55%.

The average team total batting first at the venue is 128 while the average score chasing is 112. England blasted 267 for 3 against the West Indies at Tarouba in December, 2023 which is the highest team total in a contest between two major Test playing nations in T20I cricket and the fifth-highest overall.

The spinners have made as much of an impact as the pacers at the venue.

Head to Head Record

South Africa and West Indies have faced each other in 23 T20Is and the Proteas have a marginal edge with a 12-11 head to head record. However, West Indies have won four of the last 5 encounters between the two teams.

MATCH PREDICTION

West Indies start marginal favourites as they will benefit from the home conditions and also have a more destructive batting unit. It will be a clash between their batting and the South African bowling unit. West Indies have a 60% chance of winning the match.

FANTASY XI

Our fantasy XI includes Hetymer, Powell, van der Dussen, Stubbs and Rutherford as batters and Pooran and Ferriera as the wicket-keepers. The all-rounders will be Shepherd and Markram while the bowlers are Hosein and Ngidi. The reserve batter is Henricks, all-rounder is Mulder while the bowler is Williams. The captain is Pooran while the vice-captain is Markram.
