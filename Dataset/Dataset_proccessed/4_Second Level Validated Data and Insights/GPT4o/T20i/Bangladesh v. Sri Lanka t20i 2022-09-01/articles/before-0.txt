Time – 07:30 PM IST
Venue – Dubai International Cricket Stadium, Dubai.

SL vs BAN Match Preview:

Sri Lankan batters were blown away by Afghanistan bowlers - especially Fazalhaq Farooqi with 2 wickets in the first over of the match, as they were bowled out for just 105 runs in 19.4 overs. Bhanuka Rajapaksa was the top scorer with 38 runs, while all-rounder Chamika Karunaratne contributed with 31 runs. Danushka Gunathilaka scored 17 runs but the rest of the batters failed to even cross the double-digit mark. The Lankan batters would have to gear up to take on a strong Bangla bowling to qualify for the Super Four stage of Asia Cup 2022. 

Similar to the Lankan batting, the bowling was also taken on for a ride as the Afghan batters chased down 106 runs in just 10.1 overs, smacking 10 fours & 5 sixes. Wanindu Hasaranga was the only wicket-taker with 1 wicket, and the bowlers (Matheesha Pathirana and Maheesh Theekshana) would be eyeing the weak Bangla batting and continue their journey in this year's Asia Cup.

Bangladesh were also defeated by Afghanistan in their first match of the tournament. The spin duo of Mujeeb & Rashid removed the top six batters and Bangladesh reached 127/7 in 20 overs with all-rounder Mosaddek Hossain (48*) being the top scorer while batting at #7. Bangladesh would be missing their ace batter, Liton Das, dearly and would be fighting to stay alive in the Asia Cup tournament. 

The bowlers bowled well though against Afghanistan as they nearly choked the opposition for runs. Shakib Al Hasan, Mosaddek Hossain and Mohammad Saifuddin picked up 1 wicket each as the Bangla bowlers bowled defensively, and the game was only taken away by Najibullah Zadran's quickfire 43* off 17 balls.
