Sri Lanka
Bangladesh
Prediction

Our information portal has prepared a forecast for the Sri Lanka – Bangladesh match, which will take place on September 1, 2022. This match will decide who will get second place in the playoffs in Group B because both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have already lost to Afghanistan. Who will be closer to success?

Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka approached the contest with Afghanistan in the status of a very obvious favorite, but there was a defeat with a handicap of 8 wickets. Even today, Silverwood’s guys may not justify the BM’s trust. Of course, Sri Lanka will try to beat Bangladesh and still reach the playoffs. But I wouldn’t put the Silverwood guys out as the obvious favorite.: Bangladesh performed no worse against Afghanistan, so the Bengali team has every chance. Do not forget that Sri Lankan players are now experiencing stress because their home state suffers a tremendous economic crisis. Likely, many players cannot fully concentrate on cricket.

Bangladesh

The Bengali national team lost its first match of the Asian Cup 2022 to sensational Afghanistan, which shows a perfect game within the framework of this event. Bangladesh is highly motivated today because the winner of the face-to-face confrontation with Sri Lanka goes to the playoffs. However, there is plenty of motivation from Sri Lankan players. It should be noted that today Bangladesh is a clear underdog for bookmakers, which we can disagree with. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are not in the best shape, but the chances are at least equal in a face-to-face game. The bookmakers didn’t do the right thing by giving Sri Lanka a noticeable advantage.

Prediction

In this match, the odds do not reflect the real state of affairs. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are equal rivals, and it’s hard to explain why Silverwood’s team was given such a serious preference. Let’s push off from the underdog: the victory of Bangladesh for 2.35.
