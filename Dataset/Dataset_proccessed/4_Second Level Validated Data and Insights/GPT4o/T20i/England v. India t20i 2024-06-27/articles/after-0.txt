India vs England Live: What India skipper Rohit Sharma said after the match

India vs England Live: “Very satisfying to win this game. We worked really hard as a unit. To win this game like that was a great effort from everyone. We adapted to the conditions really well. It was a challenge and we adapted. We played the conditions really well. If the players play according to the conditions, things falls in place. Very pleasing with how we came through. At one stage, 1450-150, as the game went on, after that partnership, we said another 25 runs. I can set the target in my mind, but I don't want to let anyone know about it, to the batters. They are all instinctive players. I thought 170 was a very good surface. They (Axar and Kuldeep) are gun spinners. It's difficult to play some shots, the pressure is on them as well but they were calm and knew what to bowl," Cricbuzz quoted India skipper Rohit Sharma as saying after the match.

India vs England Live: What England skipper Jos Buttler said after the match

India vs England Live: “India certainly outplayed us. We let them get 20-25 runs too many. It was a challenging surface, they played well on. They fully deserved this win. Very different conditions (than 2022), credit to India. They played a very good game of cricket. With the rain around, didn't expect the conditions to change too much. Don't think it really did. They outbowled us. They had an above-par score. Don;t think toss was necessarily the difference between the teams. They've got some fantastic spinners. In hindsight, should have bowled Moeen in that innings with the way spin was bowling. We are really proud of everyone's effort. We stuck together, came up short when it mattered the most," Cricbuzz quoted England skipper Jos Buttler as saying after the match.
