        "India versus England in a Men\u2019s T20 World Cup semi-final \u2013 this is a game where more cricket history will be written.",
        "The last time these two nations faced off in a Men\u2019s T20 World Cup semi-final was just 19 months ago in Adelaide, when a remarkable opening partnership between Jos Buttler and Alex Hales saw England cruise to victory in the sort of manner that forced a complete rethink in India\u2019s T20 strategy.",
        "India have more batting firepower, more options through the middle overs, and more variation in their attack, but the defending champions will take some beating, especially with Buttler and his new opening partner Phil Salt both in blistering form.",
        "England are two games away from becoming the first men\u2019s team to retain a T20 World Cup.",
        "India have not won this tournament since its inception back in 2007, and are searching for their first World Cup win in any format since 2011.",
        "The Guyana National Stadium is a 20,000-seater venue on the outskirts of Georgetown, situated just off the banks of the Demerara River and a few kilometres from the coast.",
        "Spinners have been quite effective on the ground, but there\u2019s also been a bit in the surface for the quicks, with the highest score across the five games being Afghanistan\u2019s 183/5 against Uganda.",
        "India have won every game they\u2019ve been able to compete in, with the only dropped points coming from the abandoned fixture against Canada at a rain-soaked Lauderhill.",
        "Impressive wins over Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Australia secured their spot in the knockout stages as the winners of Group 1 in the Super Eight.",
        "England, by contrast, have got here the hard way. A rained-off match against Scotland was followed by a loss to Australia right at the start of their campaign, leaving them needing huge wins and favours from elsewhere to reach the Super Eights.",
        "In the Super Eight, a loss to South Africa meant England were sweating somewhat, despite already having comfortably beaten hosts West Indies.",
        "South Africa\u2019s victory over West Indies consigned them to second spot in the group, sending them to this semi-final rather than being the top seed in semi-final 1.",
        "Ruthless England booked a semi-final spot with a clinical performance against USA.",
        "India named a settled side throughout their Super Eight campaign, having added Kuldeep Yadav in place of Mohammed Siraj from the team who dominated the Group Stage.",
        "The only possible change, given the expected nature of the Guyana surface, is that Yuzvendra Chahal could be added for another spinning threat.",
        "England moved away from the batting-heavy balance that they started the tournament with, leaving out Will Jacks and playing four front-line pace bowlers, with Sam Curran and Chris Jordan slotting in at seven and eight to avoid an excessively lengthy tail, and Mark Wood missing out.",
        "There could be the option of bringing Jacks back as a part-time spin option, or even handing a debut to Tom Hartley who is in the squad as an additional main spinner.",
        "England do have Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone in their top six, both of whom have bowled well when called upon, so may opt to stick with the formula that got them through the Super Eight."
