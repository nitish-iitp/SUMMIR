Live Score SL vs AFG Asia Cup 2022 Super 4 Latest Updates:Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by 4 wickets and five balls to spare to register a special win in the opening game of the Super Four stage. Chasing a stiff target of 176, Sri Lanka opener were off to a flyer as they gave them a start of 62 runs. Kudos to their top order where their big names led from the front. But it was Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Danushka Gunathilaka who guided their team in the middle over with the former launching himself over the Afghanistan bowlers. Both shared a 32 run stand and staged a rescue act after Sri Lanka were left tottering at 119/4 after the fall of skipper Dasun Shanaka.

Sri Lanka did well to restrict Afghanistan, but the damage was already done as they managed to post a stiff total of 175/6 in the 20 overs after they were asked to bat first by Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka. Rahmanullah Gurbaz was their top man as he went onto slam 84 runs in just 45 balls. He was ably supported by Ibrahim Zadran who scored 40 crucial runs. Nonetheless, Sri Lanka pulled things back in last five overs as they restricted Afghanistan to 175 when at one stage they looked set for 190 plus. Especially after scoring hundred in 12 overs.

Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bowl against Afghanistan in the opening match of the Super Fours at Sharjah. On a turning track, Shanaka has now opted to take the risk to bat last on this pitch which is surely not going to be easy. As far as team changes were concerned, Sri Lanka remained unchanged, while Afghanistan made just one change to their playing eleven with Omarzai being benched for Shinwari.

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan latest updates from Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Sharjah. After a thrilling win over rivals Bangladesh in group stage, Dasun Shanka and Co. have a big task ahead of themselves in the first match of the Super 4 stage against high-flying Afghanistan.

Sri Lanka produced a collective effort against Bangladesh and they have to emulate the same to outclass Mohammad Nabi and other Afghan players who have played dominant cricket in Asia Cup so far.
