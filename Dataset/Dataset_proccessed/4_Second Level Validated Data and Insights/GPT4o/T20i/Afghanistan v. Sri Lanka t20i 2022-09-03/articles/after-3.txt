In Short
Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by 4 wickets
Bhanuka Rajapaksa scored 31 off 14
Sri Lanka chased down 176 with 5 balls to spare

Left-handed batter Bhanuka Rajapaksa said that he has had a “floating role” for various teams in T20 cricket over the last few months. On Saturday, September 3, Rajapaksa scored a 14-ball 31 with the help of four fours and one six. On the back of his knock, Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by four wickets in the Super Four match of Asia Cup 2022.

Rajapaksa came to bat when Sri Lanka needed 57 runs to win off 35 balls with six wickets in hand. From there on, he stitched together a handy 32-run partnership with Danushka Gunathilaka, who chipped in with a 33-run knock before being castled by Rashid Khan.

Rajapaksa said that Sri Lanka desperately wanted to make a comeback after being bowled out for 105 against the Afghanistan team in a Group B clash a week ago.

"The wicket seemed quite good with the way they batted, we just needed to be a bit cautious when the spinners came into play. In the IPL, I can bat at three, but to strengthen the middle order, I was put at five. It's a floating role, but I like it. It was very embarrassing for us to get out for 105, so we wanted to put our hands up and show the nation we weren't as bad as that," Rajapaksa was quoted as saying in the post-match presentation ceremony.

When Rajapaksa got out to Naveen-ul-Haq, Sri Lanka needed only two runs to win with nine balls remaining.

Apart from Rajapaksa and Gunathilaka, openers Kusal Mendis and Pathum Nissanka also played handy knocks. Nissanka and Kusal put on 62 runs for the opening wicket off 6.3 overs.
