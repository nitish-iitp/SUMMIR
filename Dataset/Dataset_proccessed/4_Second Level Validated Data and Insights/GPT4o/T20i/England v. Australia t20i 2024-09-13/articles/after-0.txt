Travis Head's unexpected first date with the Australian captaincy has ended in huge disappointment as England levelled the T20 international series with a thrilling three-wicket victory at Cardiff.

Head, handed the leader's job after Mitch Marsh was ruled out with illness, hit a brisk 31 as he led from the front and also watched the exciting Jake Fraser-McGurk then crash his maiden international half-century on Friday evening.

But despite amassing a formidable total of 6-193 at Sophia Gardens, Head's big evening was then wrecked by a dazzling performance from Liam Livingstone, who smashed 87 in his 50th T20 international to ensure England levelled the series 1-1 with an over remaining.

Captain Phil Salt hit three successive sixes in the third over before Sean Abbott pegged England back with two quick wickets in the fourth, Fraser-McGurk catching Will Jacks for 12 before Jordan Cox was bowled for a second ball duck.

Salt went for 39 off 23 balls, caught by Abbott, but the experienced Livingstone's tremendous partnership with Jacob Bethell (44 from 24) steadied the hosts and set them on the path to victory.

Livingstone took England to the brink with a six and a four but was then caught by Matt Short with one run required, leaving Adil Rashid to close the game out with a single and six balls remaining.

Not even a remarkable display from part-time spinner Short, who took 5-22 off three overs, could prevent the hosts from earning the win that takes the three-match series to a decider in Manchester on Monday morning Australian time.
