MATCH PREDICTION
England vs Australia, 2nd T20I: Match Prediction – Who will win today’s match between ENG vs AUS?
September 13, 2024 / 4 months ago

In this article we will be analyzing the ENG vs AUS Match Prediction. The second game of the three-match T20I series between England and Australia is scheduled for September 13, 2024, to be played at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff.

The first T20I saw Australia come out on top against the hosts in a game characterized by swings and shifts.

After the visitors were off to a flyer of a start during the powerplay with them accruing 86 runs off it courtesy of absolute belligerence on show by the openers, the middle overs saw the game tilt in dramatic style as a collapse similar to that of England’s during their first innings of the third Test unfolded. Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone’s leg-spin spun the tide around in England’s favour as they restricted Australia to 179 after cleaning them up with three balls to spare.

Not only did England lose a couple of wickets than the Aussies in their powerplay, they had scored only 46. The game was tilted towards England till when Livingstone occupied the crease. In the end, England fell short by 28 runs as all six of the Australian bowlers had at least one wicket under the wickets column.

England would not be reading too much into the performance, especially because the English are short of T20I experience as compared to the Aussies. They would be keen on bettering their performance this time around.

Pitch Report

The Sophia Gardens is a venue not commonly used as far as international cricket is concerned. Out of the nine T20Is played here, six have been won by the team chasing. More of the same is expected as the team winning the toss is more than likely to have a bowl first.

ENG vs AUS Probable Top Performers

Probable Best Batter: Travis Head

The ferocious southpaw has been at his best of late, reminding just why he is considered one of the most fierce strikers of the cricket ball out there. In both the inaugural games of the Scotland and England tours, Head seemed destined for a lot more than what he displayed during his stay at the crease. He would be keen on piling up more runs in the second game of the series.

Probable Best Bowler: Adam Zampa

The deft leg-spinner has been on a wicket-taking spree on every occasion he has stepped onto the field. Emerging as the leading wicket-taker at The Hundred 2024 would only boost the confidence of the spinner. He would be more than game to add to his count come the second game.
