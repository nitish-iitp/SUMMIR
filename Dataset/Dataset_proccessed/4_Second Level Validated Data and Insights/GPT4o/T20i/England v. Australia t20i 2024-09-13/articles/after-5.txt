Phil Salt speaks

We know how good they are at the top of the order so we’ll have to go back to our plans. I knew we’d have to play well to reach that target.

We know what Livi is capable of, he was brilliant, and we were really impressed with the way Jacob took their best bowler down. He’s a real talent.

Liam’s started really well in this series and hopefully he takes that form to Old Trafford.

Travis Head’s verdict

I thought 193 was a good score and we were right in the game. Yeah, conditions changed, but we knew that at the toss. It’s nice for Jake to get into the series. I should’ve bowled Matt Short earlier!

Liam Livingstone is the player of the match

It’s been nice. I did say towards the end of The Hundred that I felt like I was getting my body back to normal, which hasn’t been the case for a while. The last couple of years have taught me a few life lessons. I’m enjoying my cricket and playing with a smile on my face.

It’s not easy coming in at No6 and No7. I’m not complain, I’m not gonna cry about it. But moving up the order is nice, it gives me more responsbility and more time to bat. I feel like I’m in decent nick with bat and ball. After a couple of difficult years I’m enjoying my cricket.

Jacob Bethell is an incredible talent but he’s got a really cool head on his shoulders. He’s a fearless kid. For a 20-year-old to play like he did today was pretty special.

It was a big game. I wanted to go to Old Trafford at 1-1, and hopefully the crowd will get behind us.

“Bethell’s six” is the subject of Simon McMahon’s email. “Don’t bother looking for that, let alone chasing it…”

Liam Livingstone lorded over that game, taking 2 for 16 from three overs before smashing five sixes in a pulsating 87. A word too for Brydon Carse, who bowled superrbly on his return, and especially Jacob Bethell. He got stuck into Adam Zampa at a key stage of the game, smacking 44 from 24 balls and adding 90 in eight overs with Livingstone.

There were some plusses for Australia too, most notably Jake Fraser-McGurk’s first international fifty and a slightly surreal five-for from the occasional offspinner Matt Short. All told, it was a really enjoyable game of T20 cricket.

England win by three wickets

19 overs: England 194-7 (J Overton 4, Rashid 1) Adil Rashid hits the winning run to complete victory with six balls remaining, which means we’ll have a series decider on Sunday.

WICKET! England 193-7 (Carse c David b Short 0)

Matt Short has a five-for! Haha, this is ridiculous. Carse tried to win the game in style but chipped a catch to mid-on. England need 1 from 7 balls, and Matt Short has more than trebled his T20 international wickets tally in the space of 2.5 overs.

WICKET! England 193-6 (Livingstone b Short 87)

Liam Livingstone falls with the scores level! He cracked Short for six and four, then missed a whip across the line and was bowled. He shakes his head in frustration as he walks off, but this has been a marvellous innings: 87 from 47 balls with six fours and five sixes. At the age of 31, he may have just made his big breakthrough at international level.

18th over: England 181-5 (Livingstone 77, J Overton 3) A big moment: Matt Short, who got Australia back in the game with the ball, has now dropped Liam Livingstone off the bowling of Abbott. Livingstone launched a full ball miles in the air on the leg side; Short scooted in from deep midwicket but couldn’t hang on to a tough low chance.

England can’t manage a boundary but they do score off every delivery. As a result they need 13 from 12 balls.

WICKET! England 171-5 (S Curran c Connolly b Short 1)

Matt Short has taken his third wicket! Curran tried to go down the ground and sliced the ball miles in the air, with the backpedalling Connolly taking a good catch at mid-on. England need 23 from 20 balls, and a collapse for the ages should not be ruled out.

WICKET! England 169-4 (Bethell b Short 44)

The partnership breaker strikes again! Bethell tries to reverse sweep Short’s first ball, misses and is bowled. That gives Australia just a sniff of victory, and ends a memorable innings of 44 from 24 balls from England’s newest prodigy. He looks the part.

16th over: England 169-3 (Livingstone 69, Bethell 44) Zampa is drying the ball between deliveries, which suggests the dew is more of a facotr than it was in Southampton. He sees Livingstone coming and arrows the ball much wider; Livingstone adjusts well to crack two through the covers.

No boundaries in Zampa’s final over – but no wickets either and that’s now the main thing for England to worry about. Zampa, whose good humour has disappeared into the River Taff, ends with figures of 4-0-37-0, at least 25 of which were scored by Bethell.

15th over: England 163-3 (Livingstone 64, Bethell 43) That burst of 38 runs from two overs has made this England’s game to lose. Bethell, who is playing remarkably well in the circumstances, swivel-pulls Abbott flat and hard for six more to long leg. He has 43 from 22 balls, Livingstone 64 from 34. England may have stumbled upon an engine room.

14th over: England 152-3 (Livingstone 60, Bethell 36) Jacon Bethell isn’t wary of Adam Zampa any more: he’s just smashed him for 20 in the over! A 20-year-old, playing his second international, has just taken one of the world’s best white-ball bowlers to the cleaners.

He charged the first two deliveries, lifting them over wide mid-on for four and then a beautiful six. He made room to crack a cut to the cover boundary, then clubbed another to cow corner. I mean, I did say Zampa’s overs would be decisive. England need 42 from 36 balls.

“Livingstone seems to have a pattern whereby he comes in with England in trouble, steadies the ship and looks like he’s going to accelerate and lead us to victory before getting out in the mid-30s,” says Tom Van der Gucht. “I can’t really remember a defining match-winning innings from him.”

Maybe tonight’s the night. His highest score in a successful runchase, in either white-ball code, is 30. In Livingstone’s defence, his overall record when he bats No4 or No5 in T20s is really good.

13th over: England 132-3 (Livingstone 60, Bethell 16) Livingstone spanks Stoinis for successive leg-side sixes, biggies too, to reach a thrilling 27-ball fifty. A pull round the corner makes it 16 from three balls, after which Stoinis does well to concede only two more.

12th over: England 114-3 (Livingstone 43, Bethell 15) The young left-arm spinner Cooper Connolly returns to the attack. Livingstone can only toe-end a full toss for a single, but then Bethell slog-sweeps handsomely for the first six of his international career. That aside it’s a good over – one six, two singles and a wide.

This is beautifully poised. England need 80 from 48 balls, 12 of which are Zampaballs. Because of that I’d make Australia slight favourites.

11th over: England 105-3 (Livingstone 42, Bethell 8) Liam Livingstone is having a whale of a time with bat and ball. He scoops Green for four and then six in an over that yields 15.

Green had the final word, sort of, when the last ball hit Livingstone in the midsection and knocked him off his feet.

10th over: England 90-3 (Livingstone 29, Bethell 7) Bethell is wary against Zampa, who bowled him at Southampton on Wednesday, and gets lucky when he edges the last ball of the over for four. Even with that boundary Zampa conceded only seven; England need 104 from 60 balls.

8th over: England 78-2 (Salt 39, Livingstone 24) Adam Zampa makes an immaculate start to his spell, conceding only four runs from the over. The first three were dot balls to Salt, who doesn’t look particularly comfortable. England need 116 from 72 balls.

7th over: England 74-2 (Salt 36, Livingstone 23) Cameron Green replaces Stoinis. Salt helps a poor ball round the corner for four, then takes a couple of singles to move to 36 from 17 balls. That includes 35 off the last 12.

Nine from the over which isn’t bad for Australia, especially as four of the last 13 will be bowled by Adam Zampa.

6th over: England 65-2 (Salt 26, Livingstone 21) Livingstone has a vile hack at Abbott, with the ball flying past leg stump for four. A double misfield from Fraser-McGurk allows England to steal a bonus run, and then he can only palm a flat pull from Livingstone over the boundary as it bounces up. He’s getting all sorts from the crowd after those two deliveries.

A ferocious pull for four from Livingstone completes a terrific over for England, 17 from it.

“Do you understand England’s team selection?” says Phil Harrison. “I confess I don’t. Why is Jamie Overton playing as a specialist batter? I know they’re missing Buttler and Brook but is Overton really the next cab off the rank? Baffles me.”

We mentioned this earlier – personally I like the selection as No7 is a specialist position in which Overton has excelled, and it’s not like he’ll never bowl again. You probably wouldn’t do it in a World Cup, but this is what bilateral series are for, surely.

5th over: England 48-2 (Salt 25, Livingstone 8) Marcus Stoinis gets some treatment in his first over. Salt thick edges for four, then Livingstone runs down the track to whack a humongous six into the crowd at cow corner. He tries again off the last ball of the over and is beaten by a slower bouncer. Well bowled.

“I was impressed by Brydon Carse’s fast bowling in Australia’s innings,” says Colum Fordham. “Is there Test match potential there? He got up to 89 mph.”

England certainly think so as he’s in the squad for Pakistan. He’s also a very good lower-order batter. In truth I’ve never been that impressed with him for England, but he was excellent tonight. You’d imagine the ongoing betting case had a negative impact on his cricket over the last year or so.

4th over: England 35-2 (Salt 20, Livingstone 0) Abbott greets Liam Livingstone with a majestic off-cutter that cuts him in half and bounces just over the stumps. He swerves one the other way to beat Livingstone’s defensive push, then has a fairly big LBW appeal turned down. Australia review but I’m fairly sure this is missing leg.

Indeed it was, so Australia lose a review. But that’s a remarkable first over from Abbott: the only run he conceded was a wide and he picked up two important wickets.

WICKET! England 34-2 (Cox b Abbott 0)

Two wickets in three balls! Sean Abbott goes straight through Jordan Cox to hit the top of middle and leg, and now England are in trouble. The first two balls of Abbott’s spell were around 75 mph; the third was 10mph quicker, with a bit of seam movement, and Cox was beaten all ends up.

Salt belts three successive sixes

3rd over: England 33-0 (Salt 20, Jacks 12) After a slow start, 1 from 5 balls, Salt smashes Hardie for three sixes in a row. He pulled sweetly over midwicket and square leg, then swiped mightily over long-on and into the River Taff.

England needed an over like that; they’re now only four runs behind Australia at the same stage.

2nd over: England 13-0 (Salt 1, Jacks 11) Blimey, Travis Head has given the new ball to the 21-year-old left-arm spinner Cooper Connolly. It evokes Will Jacks being fed to Head at the T20 World Cup, when he bowled the second over of the innings and was walloped for 22.

Jacks is the batter this time and goes straight on the attack, driving Connolly’s first ball over mid-off for four. Connolly does well to keep things relatively quiet after that, with a wide and three consecutive twos to Jacks. Australia will take that.

15.21 EDT

1st over: England 2-0 (Salt 1, Jacks 1) Aaron Hardie starts excellently with the ball, hitting a good length with enough outswing to make life difficult. Salt gets off the mark from his fourth delivery with a leading edge that drops short of mid-off, then Jacks works another behind square.

Salt has had a relatively lean trot since those back-to-back hundreds in the Caribbean in December. He’s still averaging 34 with a strike rate of 160, mind.

England need 194 to win

That looks a tall order on a pitch that looks awkward when pace comes off the ball. England need to go huge in the Powerplay.

Australia’s top four did most of the work, from Travis Head’s 14-ball 31 to Jake Fraser-McGurk’s stylish first fifty in international cricket, and Aaron Hardie made a very handy 20 from 9 balls at No8.

20th over: Australia 193-6 (Green 13, Hardie 20) Australia finish with a flourish, burgling 20 runs from Sam Curran’s final over. Hardie started with successive boundaries, thrashing to long on and slicing deliberately over backward point, then pulled a muscular six over midwicket. Shot!

Curran tries to hide the ball just inside the tramlines but gets it fractionally wrong on a couple of occasions. That means a couple of extra deliveries, though he does manage to avoid conceding any further boundaries.

19th over: Australia 173-6 (Green 13, Hardie 3) It should have been 44 for five off 6.1 overs. Green mistimed a pull off Saqib Mahmood and was badly dropped by Overton, running in from deep midwicket. Green pulls the next ball flat and hard for six, with a bald fella in the crowd taking a much tougher catch before turning to salute the crowd. #baldcommunity

England review unsuccessfully for LBW after a cracking yorker from Mahmood to Hardie. There was a slight bottom edge and it would have swung past leg stump anyway. But it was a beautiful delivery from Saqib, which he follows with a bit more reverse swing to beat Green.

Saqib bowled far better than figures of 3-0-37-0 would suggest.

18th over: Australia 161-6 (Green 2, Hardie 2) The No8 Aaron Hardie can play – his highest first-class score is 174 not out – so England still have work to do. An excellent over from Curran, full of cutters and slower balls, costs only four.

The downside for England is that Australia will know how important it is to take pace off on this pitch. Even so, this has been a really good comeback: Australia have scored 44 for four off the last six overs.
