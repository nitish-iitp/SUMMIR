IND vs ZIM Live Score 3rd T20I Live Score: India win

Zimbabwe’s late fireworks didn’t suffice to cross the finish line in the big chase of 183. Probably a good start would have taken them through. The hosts picked up after losing half the batters. The 77-run stand between Madande and Myers was the key highlight. Madande continued the momentum till the end and notched up his maiden T20I fifty they fell 24 runs short in the chase. Zimbabwe were sloppy on the field as well. Too many misfields and dropped catches let India score those extra runs which Zimbabwe couldn’t. Well, that made the difference.

India’s second consecutive win let them take a 2-1 lead in the series with two more games to go. The action will resume this weekend in Harare. Till then Stay Safe and keep reading CricketNext.

Richard Ngarava goes for the short delivery and the pacer misses out on a wicket where Gill top-edged the delivery and the bowler fails to come in and take that catch. The skipper makes sure to punish the bowler with a six off a pull-shot over the fine-leg boundary followed by the straight drive for another boundary to make it 14 runs in the over.
