India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: Player of the match

Arshdeep Singh (3/14): There's breeze from the end I was bowling. I didn't get the wicket the way I wanted but the ball is coming good from the hand. It's minor changes in the run-up, in the wrist, I keep learning and exploring things. The experience is there, the more you play the better you get. Everyone bowled well, especially Mayank was very good. I guess the best thing in this format is how well you can adapt to the situation, to the wicket and to the ground dimensions as well. My motive is how well I can adapt and how quickly I can adapt.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: Captains on the mic

Suryakumar Yadav: We just tried to back our skills and what we decided in our team meetings, it worked out. The way the guys showed character playing on a new ground and the way we batted, it was great. It's a good headache to have when you are on the field on whom to bowl. Every time you have an extra option, it's a good thing. You learn something new every new game. There are always a few areas to improve on, we will sit down and talk about it in the next game.

Najmul Hossain Shanto: Yes, I think we didn't start well. In T20, first six overs is important but we didn't do well. The plan was to play positive cricket but we had to manage some overs how we want to approach. Looks like we didn't have much plan but we need to do proper plan in the next match. We need to focus on rotating the strike, T20 is not only about hitting. If we keep wickets in hand, we can get a good score. We didn't score many runs. Rishad bowled well and Fizz was also good but we didn't have enough runs.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: Pandya finishes it in a breeze!

Taskin Ahmed to bowl the 12th over and Hardik Pandya ensures it's the last one India bat tonight. Two fours followed by a six and India close the game by seven wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

First, a short ball, quickly directed over the keeper's head with absolute nonchalance for four runs. Then, a full toss on the off stump, met with a heave. The ball goes down backward point for four, despite the bat flying on the leg side. And at last, a pull shot over cow corner for six. Those last few runs have been indicative of India's performance all through this T20I - comprehensive.

21:51 (IST)
06 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: Pandya's power flex!

An exhibition of hitting in Gwalior today and this shot from Hardik Pandya might be a strong contender to take the cake.

Rishad Hossain with a length ball, little to no pace on it. Pandya arches back in his crease and has a whack at it. Remember, it's pitched outside off, and the hit is over extra cover. Goes all the way over the advertising boards beyond the boundary for SIX! What power on show from the Indian all-rounder. After 11 overs, India are 116/3.

Fizz goes full and on the off stump to close the over, Pandya goes inside out over extra cover for four more. 107/3 after 10 overs.

21:38 (IST)
06 OCT 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: No respite for BAN

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: Fifty up for IND!

Just as the broadcasters display Surya's incredible boundary count (in T20Is) in the deep square leg-fine leg region - 85 so far - the Indian skipper targets the same region to loot 14 runs off the last three balls. 

First, a whip stroke after kneeling down on one knee. Then, Taskin goes fuller and Surya picks it with a neat flick shot for the same result. And at last, a delivery pitched outside off, perfectly preampted shot from Surya for six over fine leg. Fifty up for India. 58/1 after five overs. They are in a hurry to close this one.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: Pitch report

With its dimensions of 64 meters and 65 meters square boundaries, and 74 meters straight down the ground, the pitch is likely to offer ample opportunities for scoring runs. The black soil surface, covered in dry grass, appears firm and conducive to batting. While there is no previous international match data to analyze, the recent Madhya Pradesh League (MPL) saw teams scoring heavily, with eight out of twelve matches won by the team batting second. The curator has confirmed that dew has not been an issue in the past four days, making the decision to bat first a strategic one. However, considering the freshness of the pitch, teams may opt to bowl first to take advantage of any potential early movement. Overall, the pitch conditions suggest a high-scoring encounter between India and Bangladesh, Abhinav Mukund said in his pitch report

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 1st T20I: A look in to the past of Gwalior's Captain Roop Singh Stadium

Captain Roop Singh Stadium, named after the legendary hockey player and brother of Dhyan Chand, holds a special place in cricket history. It was here that the legendary Sachin Tendulkar achieved a historic milestone, scoring the first-ever ODI double century against South Africa in 2010.

However, despite its significance, the stadium has fallen into disrepair. The once-vibrant venue now features rusted scoreboards, outdated floodlights, dusty pavilions, and crumbling stands.

While the stadium's glory days may be behind it, its connection to Sachin Tendulkar's remarkable achievement will forever be remembered. As Gwalior prepares to host the India vs Bangladesh T20 series at the newly-built Shrimant Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium, the legacy of Captain Roop Singh Stadium remains a testament to the city's rich cricketing heritage.

“Mayank has an X factor in him. He has that extra pace. I haven’t faced him in the nets but he is special,” SKY said. “It’s a great opportunity for youngsters like Mayank. We have to nurture players like him, he is a special talent. Mayank is fully fit and fine right now,” he added.
