England name new captain Phil Salt as Buttler out of Australia T20Is
By Staff Reporter

New England captain Phil Salt

ENGLAND skipper Jos Buttler has been ruled out of the three-match T20I series against Australia due to a right calf injury.
In a big blow ahead of their T20I series against Australia, England will be without their regular captain Jos Buttler, who has been injured. Buttler’s right calf injury also puts him in doubt for the five-game ODI series that follows.
In his absence, 28-year-old Phil Salt will lead the T20I side. The attacking right-handed batter has scored 885 runs at a whopping strike-rate of 165.11 in 31 T20Is thus far.

All-rounder Jamie Overton has been called up as Buttler’s replacement in the T20I squad. In addition, batter Jordan Cox has been added to the ODI squad as cover.
England T20I squad: Phil Salt (c), Jofra Archer, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse, Jordan Cox, Sam Curran, Josh Hull, Will Jacks, Liam Livingstone, Saqib Mahmood, Dan Mousley, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley, John Turner.

Australia began their tour of UK with a record win against Scotland in Edinburgh. They play two more T20Is against Scotland before the T20I series against England, which begins on September 11.
