England suffer disappointing 28-run T20 defeat against Australia as Travis Head fires the visitors to convincing win in series opener
England were comfortably beaten by Australia in Southampton on Wednesday
Travis Head scored a stunning 59 runs off just 23 deliveries against England
The hosts will have a chance at redemption in Cardiff on Friday evening

England’s white-ball reset got off to an underwhelming start last night against Australia in the Southampton gloom.

Despite the Test summer ending only two days earlier, a full house of 15,000 turned up at the Utilita Bowl, and witnessed a team coached by Marcus Trescothick and captained by Phil Salt – in both cases temporarily – lose the first of three T20 internationals by 28 runs.

Not many were expecting instant fireworks in England’s first limited-overs game since the announcement that Brendon McCullum would unite the red- and white-ball coaching roles early next year.

And there was an impressive fightback with the ball after Travis Head belted 59 off 23 deliveries, including an eye-watering 30 off an over from Sam Curran.

But it was a quiet night for England’s three T20 debutants. Jordan Cox made a streaky 17 before falling to arguably the catch of the summer from Tim David, running back from mid-on and diving at full length to cling on inches above the turf.

Liam Livingstone top scored for the hosts on his way to 37 runs off just 27 balls in Southampton

Jacob Bethell, the 20-year-old Barbados-born all-rounder, managed three serviceable overs of left-arm spin, but was bowled by leg-spinner Adam Zampa for just two.

And Jamie Overton, playing as a specialist hitter at No 7 because of ongoing back problems, was also bowled by Zampa, for 15. No one came close to matching Head.

‘They came out swinging,’ said Salt. ‘Fair play to Heady. We dragged it back well through the middle, and felt it was very chaseable, but we kept losing wickets at bad times.’

At 106 for four in the 13th over, with Liam Livingstone starting to assert himself, England had a chance of overhauling the Australians’ 179. But Sam Curran was caught trying to help Sean Abott over short fine leg, and Livingstone soon fell for 37, bowled by Josh Hazlewood.

Six down need not usually spell the end of a chase, but England’s thin batting was now exposed. With Curran at No 6, despite a T20 international batting average below 13, Jofra Archer was as high as No 8. Before long, they were all out for 151. Salt insisted Curran had ‘all the tools to be a world-class all-rounder’, but he's not there yet.

Hampshire had switched on over 1,000 solar panels before play in their bid to become the world’s greenest cricket club, but their output might have been matched by the power generated off Head’s bat as Australia got off to a flyer.

Having reached 50 off 17 balls against Scotland last week in Edinburgh, he needed only two more to reach a punishing half-century, with Curran bearing the brunt.

England’s most expensive over in T20 cricket remains the 36 conceded by Stuart Broad against India’s Yuvraj Singh during the 2007 World Cup in South Africa. Curran has gone for 30 before, in the Caribbean last December, and now matched that during a brutal sixth over that went four, four, six, six, six, four.

But Saqib Mahmood removed Head with the last ball of the powerplay and, from 86 without loss, Australia stumbled. The ever-reliable Adil Rashid bowled Mitchell Marsh, their captain, for two, before Livingstone overturned two lbw shouts in two balls to send back Matthew Short for 41 and David.

Archer and Mahmood then thrillingly produced yorkers at will, each finding himself on a hat-trick as the last five wickets fell for 14. In total, all 10 had gone for 93.

And when Salt was caught at mid-off from the first ball of the chase, only for Xavier Bartlett to be called for overstepping, England might have imagined it would be their night.

But Will Jacks hoicked Hazlewood to long leg moments later, and when Salt was caught on the deep backward square boundary for 20 off Abbott, England were 46 for three, and almost into the tail.

They will have a crack at instant redemption in Cardiff on Friday – hopefully with a deeper batting line-up.
