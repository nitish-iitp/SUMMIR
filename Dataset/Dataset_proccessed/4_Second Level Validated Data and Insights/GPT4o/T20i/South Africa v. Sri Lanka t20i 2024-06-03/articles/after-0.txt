In Short
Sri Lanka have been bowled out for 77, their lowest T20 World Cup total
Nortje took 4 wickets for 7 runs, leading South Africa's disciplined bowling
Sri Lanka managed just three fours and three sixes in 19.1 overs

Sri Lanka were bowled out for their lowest-ever total in T20I history, scoring just 77 runs against a ruthless South African bowling attack. The match, anticipated to be one of the more competitive fixtures in Group D, turned into a one-sided affair as Sri Lanka struggled on a pitch offering variable bounce and swing. The South African bowlers, led by Anrich Nortje, delivered a masterclass in disciplined bowling. Nortje's devastating spell saw him take 4 wickets for just 7 runs, earning him the spotlight.

However, the contributions from his teammates were equally significant. Ottneil Baartman made an immediate impact, claiming a wicket with his very first delivery and maintaining an impressive economy rate of 2.25. Meanwhile, Keshav Maharaj's two wickets in consecutive balls further dismantled the Sri Lankan batting lineup. This total was Sri Lanka's worst in a T20 World Cup match since being bowled out for 87 runs by Australia in the 2010 T20 World Cup. Their score of 77 is the fifth-lowest by a full-member team in T20 World Cup history, with the lowest being England's 55 against West Indies in Dubai in 2021. The overall lowest total by any team in the T20 World Cup is 39, scored by the Netherlands against Sri Lanka in 2014.

LOWEST TOTAL BY FULL MEMBERS TEAMS IN T20 WORLD CUP
55 — Eng vs WI, Dubai (2021)
60 — NZ vs SL, Chattogram (2014)
70 — Ban vs NZ, Kolkata (2016)
72 — Ban vs Aus, Dubai (2021)
77 — SL vs SA, New York (2024)

The New York pitch, being used for the first time in this tournament, proved challenging for the batsmen. Its inconsistent bounce and the swing on offer made scoring difficult. Moreover, the expansive outfield added to the batting side's woes, with boundaries hard to come by. Sri Lanka could only muster three fours and three sixes in their entire innings, which lasted just 19.1 overs.

A career-best performance from Anrich Nortje helps South Africa restrict Sri Lanka to their lowest score in Men's T20Is ðŸ‘#T20WorldCup | #SLvSA | ðŸ“: https://t.co/eTTQBZAe5w pic.twitter.com/ocCzvuT6pR — ICC (@ICC) June 3, 2024

Sri Lanka's performance was far from the level expected in such a critical match. The team's inability to build partnerships or counter the South African bowlers' tactics was evident. From the onset, they seemed unable to cope with the conditions, losing wickets at regular intervals without any substantial resistance. This historic low for Sri Lanka in T20I cricket not only raises questions about their preparation and adaptability but also sets a daunting task for their bowlers to defend such a meager total. The team will need a miraculous effort to turn the match around from this position.

Despite the dismal performance, opener Kusal Mendis managed to top-score for Sri Lanka, albeit with a modest 19 runs off 30 balls. The brief scores read: Sri Lanka 77 all out in 19.1 overs (Kusal Mendis 19; Anrich Nortje 4/7, Keshav Maharaj 2/22).
