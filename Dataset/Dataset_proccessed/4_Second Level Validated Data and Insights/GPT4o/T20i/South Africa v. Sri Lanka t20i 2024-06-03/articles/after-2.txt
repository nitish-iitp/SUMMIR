Sri Lanka vs South Africa Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: Led by Anrich Nortje’s 4/8, South Africa bundled Sri Lanka for 77, their lowest T20 score on Monday.

The Proteas then recorded a scrappy win, reaching the target with six wickets and under four overs to spare. While the South African top-order failed to score briskly on a tacky wicket marred further by a sluggish outfield, watchful bits from Quinton de Kock, Tristan Stubbs and Heinrich Klaasen were enough for the win eventually.

SL vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Aiden Markram

Happy with the win. The batting was little up and down, probably speaks to quite a tough wicket and luckily we found ways to score on this. It was a tough one from a batting point of view, we try as much as we can to take the pitch out of it, we can take some learnings from it and we are experienced. Lots of different conditions as we move around, fortunately we have our next two here so we know what's coming but it's important to adapt as we go ahead. (About Nortje) Was not worried about him but a fantastic day for him, from a mental confidence point of view. He is massively loved in the changeroom, boys are incredibly happy and proud of him, hopefully this kicks off a great World Cup for him.

SL vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Wanindu Hasaranga

Our batters tried for 160-170. To be honest this was a 120 wicket especially with our bowlers. We went with our strength - our bowling, that's why we batted first. We wanted to put a score and then defend. This is early in the tournament and we have three more games, we want to do much better, especially with our batting talent. If our batting does well, we can finish well.

SL vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Anrich Nortje is the Player of the Match

Nortje: Definitely, this will get some momentum going. Tough few days, we've worked hard and it's nice to get some momentum. Very happy, I've been feeling good from the last few games, finally great to have a good game and get a few wickets. The guys did well to restrict them to a low score. Been a while since I got many wickets and was happy to be helpful in the team's win. We needed to assess as quickly as possible (on the conditions), it was up and down at times (on the wicket), I needed to hit my straps, hit the wicket hard, it was important that we got some early wickets. It was a tough one, practicing on these drop-in wickets is hard, we weren't able to bowl on the pitch on the pre-match day, the plans were simple, that helped me, I just need to get my rhythm better in the next few games.

The ball keeps low and Kamindu takes a fine catch pushing forward at first-slip. Tristan Stubbs is in at 4. Loud appeal as Shanaka slides one down leg.

03 JUN 2024
SL vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup: SA 14/1 in 3 overs

Mathews hits a fine line outside off and gets the ball to spring up sharply, inches away from Markram's bat. So close and Markram's reflexes have saved him from nicking that one.

SL vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup:Ottneil Baartman

He's (Nortje) a world class player. Quicks allowed him to settle in. I'm glad for him. The way the guys handled things was phenomenal. The way Aiden marshalled the troops was exceptional. There is some movement for seamers, but if you apply yourself... It is a dream come true. Making debut for T20 World Cup is exceptional.

TOSS: Sri Lanka win toss, opt to bat

Hasaranga: We're going to bat first. We can see it's a good wicket. Just want to get a good score. Our bowling attack is so strong, that's our idea. I started my cricket 1 month before. I'm ready to go. Some players came after IPL, we played two practice games. We are going with 7-4 combination, 7 batters, 4 bowlers and 2 allrounders.

Markram: Markram: We actually would've bowled. Not sure how the wicket is going to play. Team has been together now for few years - majority of the squad. Did well at the ODI World Cup, ideally would've liked to go a few steps further. Good facilities here. All things have gone well and it's been thoroughly enjoyable so far. We're going with four quicks and one spinner in Keshav.

SL vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Limbering up

The outfield at the venue has come under the scanner for its softness. The issue has been addressed by India head coach Rahul Dravid as well who has hinted at the possibility of injuries and players may be hesitant to put in the dives. The teams have also been offered an alternate training venue. So both teams head into the match with negligible understanding of the conditions.

SL vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Nortje's concerning form

1/42, 1/48, 0/43, 3/59, 2/65, 0/31, 1/48, 0/47, 0.26 - Anrich Nortje's recent T20 returns do not make for fine reading and South Africa will have reasons to be worried about. The Proteas pace attack revolves around Rabada, Nortje and Jansen and the right-arm quick's return from injury has not been ideal thus far.

"The numbers haven't been great for him in the last while but I'm not overly concerned. I've watched him quite closely during the IPL and we've had quite a few discussions around tactics and fields and things like that. If you get the balance of that right, then what can be big numbers can be turned into a far better return in terms of runs and wickets, etcetera," Eric Simons, South Africa's bowling coach said on Nortje's run into the tournament.

Sri Lanka vs South Africa Live Score, T20 World Cup: The Klaasen show

Heinrich Klaasen has not been in the best of nicks lately but he is arguably the most feared hitter in the T20 game today. While he could not power Sunrisers Hyderabad to the title in the IPL, Klaasen's strokemaking has been a thing of awe for one and all. He has smashed the second-most sixes in T20s since 2023, with 76 maximums in his name.
