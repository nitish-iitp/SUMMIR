SL Vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Captain Quotes

Markram: We actually would've bowled. Not sure how the wicket is going to play. Team has been together now for few years - majority of the squad. Did well at the ODI World Cup, ideally would've liked to go a few steps further. Good facilities here. All things have gone well and it's been thoroughly enjoyable so far. We're going with four quicks and one spinner in Keshav.

Hasaranga: We're going to bat first. We can see it's a good wicket. Just want to get a good score. Our bowling attack is so strong, that's our idea. I started my cricket 1 month before. I'm ready to go. Some players came after IPL, we played two practice games. We are going with 7-4 combination, 7 batters, 4 bowlers and 2 allrounders.

SL Vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: SL Are 21/1 After 5 Overs

After a slow and watchful start, SL are 21 for the loss of one wicket after five overs. SL lost Pathum Nissanka early to Oliver Baartman but Kusal Mendis and Kamindu Mendis have been steady and will look to counter-attack to ramp up the scoring rate.

Despite some lusty blows from veteran Angelo Mathews, Proteas are still in command of this match as they look to bowl out the Lankans well under 100. Mathews remains the only hope for the Islanders if they are to get anywhere close to 100 or more.

What a terrific bowling performance from RSA to bundle out the Islanders for 77 under 20 overs in New York. Despite losing the toss, Markram's men did not lose focus and kept plucking wickets as SL stuttered in New York. Nortje took four wickets with Keshav Maharaj and Kagiso Rabada taking two each.

SL Vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Oliver Baartman Speaks

He's a world class player (Nortje). Quicks allowed him to settle in. Glad for him. The way the guys handled things was phenomenal. The way Aiden marshalled the troops was exceptional. There is some movement for seamers, but if you apply yourself... It is a dream come true. Making debut for T20 World Cup is exceptional.

SL bowlers have been spot-on with their line and length and it came to fruition with the wicket of Aiden Markram. Tristan Stubbs survived a DRS review but all in all, SL have been on the mark in the five overs.

SL Vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Anrich Nortje Adjudged Player of the Match

Definitely, this will get some momentum going. Tough few days, we've worked hard and it's nice to get some momentum. Very happy, I've been feeling good from the last few games, finally great to have a good game and get a few wickets. The guys did well to restrict them to a low score. Been a while since I got many wickets and was happy to be helpful in the team's win. We needed to assess as quickly as possible (on the conditions), it was up and down at times (on the wicket), I needed to hit my straps, hit the wicket hard, it was important that we got some early wickets. It was a tough one, practicing on these drop-in wickets is hard, we weren't able to bowl on the pitch on the pre-match day, the plans were simple, that helped me, I just need to get my rhythm better in the next few games.

SL Vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Wanindu Hasaranga | Sri Lanka captain

Our batters tried for 160-170. To be honest this was a 120 wicket especially with our bowlers. We went with our strength - our bowling, that's why we batted first. We wanted to put a score and then defend. This is early in the tournament and we have three more games, we want to do much better, especially with our batting talent. If our batting does well, we can finish well.

SL Vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Aiden Markram | Proteas Captain

Happy with the win. The batting was little up and down, probably speaks to quite a tough wicket and luckily we found ways to score on this. It was a tough one from a batting point of view, we try as much as we can to take the pitch out of it, we can take some learnings from it and we are experienced. Lots of different conditions as we move around, fortunately we have our next two here so we know what's coming but it's important to adapt as we go ahead. [on Nortje] Was not worried about him but a fantastic day for him, from a mental confidence point of view. He is massively loved in the changeroom, boys are incredibly happy and proud of him, hopefully this kicks off a great World Cup for him.
