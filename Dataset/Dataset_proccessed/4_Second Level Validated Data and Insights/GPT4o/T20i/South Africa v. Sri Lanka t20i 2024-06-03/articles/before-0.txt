Denny you have more confidence in the Proteas than I have.

But hoping that you are correct,

? Not sure what you mean I have the Proteas finishing 6th. I don't expect them to semi final, what's your call?

I would rate them after Pakistan.

I have no confidence in the present Proteas squad.

Just to add, our batting is still very suspect. We'll need Quinton to find his best form, we'll need Markram to play several captains innings and prove his T20 ability but we do have an in-form Heinrich Klaasen and Tristan Stubbs . . . and we do have the best bowling attack in the tournament.

I am posting this prediction as we're demolishing Sri Lanka (without Gerald Coetzee). We do still have to bat though!

Come on Proteas!!!

One last thing, Papua New Guinea were nothing short of brilliant yesterday taking the Windies right down to the wire and in this format and on these pitches, I think we'll see a few upsets. Hope it;s not Netherlands vs SA!

I lied, that wasn't the last thing . . . I've seen very little of Ottneil Baartman but he looks sensational!

And as I post that, we've just skittled our toughest group opponents for 76. Anrich Nortje almost unplayable!

Come on Proteas!

Catchup with you later I'm off to the gym but what an interesting game but then again as the saying goes...'Cricket is a funny game'

I also have no choice but to revise my own predictions

Had reservations about the Proteas with Jansen and Nortje in poor form in the IPL and the latter carrying an injury as well. Also thought there was a sameness in their attack but after yesterday's effort I'm happy to concede that Baartman makes an added difference. My MOM was the wicket, no batsmen scored a 50 or gained momentum on a tricky pitch so I'm holding back on making a call on the Proteas batting. Sri Lanka batsmen completely misread the wicket as they suffered an IPL hangover.

I believe SA will be in the seemi's  - depending  on th team - having Hendricks opening will be a disaster to start off with/

As I understand it - if SA lose against the Windies they would still be in the semi's but what is even worse is that if Afghanistan beats Bangla Desh Australia will be out of the semi's.
