NZ vs AUS T20I series – All you need to know

The 2021 T20 world champion Australia will have an arsenal of destructive forces at their disposal with the likes of Glenn Maxwell and Tim David being available. The veteran David Warner is also in, on what should be his last tour to New Zealand as the opener has retired from all other formats to prepare for the T20 World Cup.

New Zealand, meanwhile, will be without their regular skipper Kane Williamson who has been rested after his exploits against South Africa, with Mitchell Santner standing in as the skipper. Even though they might look like the underdogs on paper, the Kiwi side boasts the likes of Finn Allen, Rachin Ravindra, and Devon Conway.

Skipper Mitch Marsh has suggested that Steve Smith might not make the Playing XI.

“There will be certain guys that probably bat in different positions than they have done in the past, but ultimately we’re here to win the series. I’ve batted three for the last 18 months, so I’ll be there to start with. And obviously Heady and Davey Warner have been amazing for us over the last period of time, so I daresay that will be the top three,” Mitchell Marsh told cricket.com.au.

“Over here, it’s always the harsh reality that we’re neighbours, in sport we like to beat each other,” Warner said in Wellington on Monday.

“From that perspective, we’re going to be expecting the crowd to come at us as hard as they come. As we always say, it’s in one ear, out the other – if I actually hear anything.”

“I enjoy playing here. It’s about coming out and trying to put my best foot forward, and score runs.

“The crowd, yeah, they got personal, but if they have to get personal, that’s their character ... if you want to pay your money to come and abuse people, you have to go back and lay in your own bed.

“We’re here to play the game of cricket that we love, enjoy and put bums on seats to keep the game going," Warner said.
