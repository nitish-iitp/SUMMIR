New Zealand and Australia are gearing up for an electrifying three-match T20I series set to kick off on February 21 at the iconic Sky Stadium in Wellington. With both teams boasting a roster of star players, fans can anticipate an exhilarating battle in the shortest format of the game.

The Black Caps, led by Mitchell Santner, are eager to showcase their prowess on home soil as they take on their trans-Tasman rivals. Santner, known for his spin bowling and handy contributions with the bat, will be aiming to lead his team to victory against the formidable Australian side.

On the other hand, Australia will be under the captaincy of star all-rounder Mitchell Marsh. With his explosive batting and effective medium-pace bowling, Marsh will be looking to make an impact as he leads his team in the T20I series against Black Caps.
