In short
: A four on the final ball of the innings by Tim David has delivered Australia a thrilling win over New Zealand in WellingtonAustralia chased down New Zealand's 215 on the back of David and Mitch Marsh (72 off 44)
What's next?
The second match of the series will kick off on Friday night 

Tim David has produced a final-ball win for the ages, striking a boundary as Australia chased down New Zealand's 3-215 for a six-wicket win in Wellington.

Needing four to win, David thumped Tim Southee to the mid-wicket boundary as Australia won the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy opener in dramatic fashion on Wednesday night.

Captain Mitch Marsh was on hand to celebrate with David in the middle after his own superb knock, striking 72 off 44 to steer Australia within reach of the total.

David (31 off 10) then exploded, hitting 29 runs of the 32 required in nine balls by Australia.

"It was special to watch and really proud of him," Marsh said of David.

"It takes complete trust in your game and a real confidence to go out there and do that."

The total is Australia's third-best T20 chase, although it did set an unfortunate record in the process.

Marsh's side became the first nation to concede more than 200 in four consecutive T20 internationals, with New Zealand's total coming after three big innings by West Indies.

All of the Black Caps' bats fired, though Rachin Ravindra was the prime destroyer, lashing six sixes in his 68 off 35 balls.

He was ably supported by fellow Wellingtonian Devon Conway (63 off 46) in a century partnership.

With destructive opener Finn Allen (32 off 16), the Kiwi trio punished Australia's spinners with Adam Zampa (0-42 off three) and Glenn Maxwell (0-32 off two) banished from the attack.

Instead, Test foursome Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Marsh combined for an all-pace finish to the innings, which failed to restrain power-hitters Glenn Phillips (19 off 10) and Mark Chapman (18 off 13).

Australia did the job without Steve Smith, with selectors leaving the 34-year-old out of the XI.

Doubts linger over whether the veteran will go to his fourth T20 World Cup, with this series being Australia's last hit-out before the June tournament.
