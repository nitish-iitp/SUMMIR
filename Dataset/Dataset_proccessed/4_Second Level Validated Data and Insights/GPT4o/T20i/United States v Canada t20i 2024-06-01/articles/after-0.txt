‘You don’t see this kind of innings every day’

Winning USA captain Patel had this to say at the presentation: “The way we have been playing against Canada [in the past], and today, was a complete effort.

“We talk about playing fearless cricket. The way Gous and Jones played, they took the game completely out of Canada’s hands.

“We bowled well in patches, but we gave up 15-20 runs extra.

“It was tough to bat in the first six overs, but the way these guys batted was just brilliant.

“We always knew he [Jones] had the game.

“He was playing fearless cricket. You don’t see this kind of innings every day.”

‘Our bowlers had no answers for them’

Canada skipper Saad Bin Zafar thought his team put on a “great total”.

“I thought Dhaliwal and Kirton played well. We started well in the power-play and took early wickets but the way Jones and Gous batted, our bowlers had no answers for them,” he said at the post-match presentation.

“The wicket had good bounce. The ball was coming on nicely onto the bat.

“It came on a little better in the second innings due to the dew.

“We missed a bit of [our] line and length, especially the spinners.

“We bowled four no-balls which is a big no-no. We need to work on that. We shouldn’t have given up so many extras.

“I am still happy with the efforts the boys put in. It is just the first game and we have to put this behind us.”

‘Pressure brings the best out of me’

Could it really be anyone else? Jones had this to say after being adjudged the player of the match: “I don’t think it is easy to put it into the words [how I feel].

“Canada always comes at us hard. Just happy to get our team over the line tonight.

“I thought anything over 200 was chaseable. The wicket is a good one and the outfield is fast.

“We backed ourselves and played aggressive cricket.

“I go through my processes during practice. I back myself to hit it.

“I like to come in when my team is under pressure. It brings the best out of me.

USA win by seven wickets

Led by Jones’s incredible 94 off just 40 balls, the USA start off their T20 World Cup 2024 campaign with a barnstorming victory over traditional rivals, Canada.

Jones, who clattered four fours and 10 sixes in his innings, was well supported by Gous’s 65 off 46 balls.

Canada, who began brightly by getting some early wickets, started to lose their way when Dutta came on to bowl during the ninth over.

From there, the USA were simply on a roll, propelled by the aerial fireworks of Jones.
