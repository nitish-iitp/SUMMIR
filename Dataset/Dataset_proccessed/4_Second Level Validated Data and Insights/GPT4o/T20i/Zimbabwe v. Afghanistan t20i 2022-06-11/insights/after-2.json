        "Zimbabwe fans are desperately looking for something to smile about. Before the Afghanistan tour, they lost a five-match T20I series 3-2 at home to Namibia in another confidence-sapping campaign.",
        "With a T20 World Cup Qualifier campaign at home next month, Zimbabwe have a great chance here to pick up some momentum in their quest to participate in Australia later this year.",
        "How they deal with Afghanistan\u2019s impressive attack and hard-hitting batsmen serves as a great challenge ahead of next month\u2019s crucial tournament.",
        "For Afghanistan, their agenda is to get back into the swing of things ahead of the World Cup. Their last T20I was in Bangladesh in March, where they chased down the home side\u2019s 115/9 with ease."

        "The afternoon start means the track should be a good one for batting right away, as opposed to the morning where the ball often moves around more. However, there may be a touch of slowness about the square as all three ODIs were played on this ground. If that\u2019s the case, Zimbabwe may struggle to deal with Afghanistan\u2019s spinners.",
        "The last T20Is played on this ground was between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh in 2021. The chasing team won two of the three games, with an average first innings score of 170.33.",
        "More clear and cool weather is forecast in Harare."
