        "Rohit Sharma: 'A very good all-round performance, something we were looking for. We had qualified, but we wanted to come out and play the way we wanted to play, which we achieved. What SKY is doing for the team is remarkable, just coming out there, playing that way, taking the pressure off the others. We know his ability, and it allows the guy at the other end to take his time. The dugout can really be at ease when he bats, and he's shown a lot of composure when he's batted. We expected this from him, and he's gone from strength to strength. The key for us will be to adjust quickly to the conditions. We have played a game there, but we need to adjust quickly. England are a good team, and it will be a great contest. We should take pride in qualifying, firstly, and if we play that semi-final well, we have another big game as well. It's about understanding the lines and lengths - the square boundaries are shorter - and executing well. The fans have been brilliant all this while, almost everywhere we have gone we've got a full house, and we expect the same in the semi-finals as well. On behalf of the team I'd really like to thank them.'",
        "Craig Ervine: 'I think maybe we could have changed up a couple of other plans. Suryakumar was brilliant at the end, negated Richey's wide yorkers, which was our main plan. We could maybe have changed our pace a bit more there. Leading up to the tournament, we went in looking to be positive at the top, but the last 2-3 games we kind of went away from there. The ball was swinging, but to counter that we probably could have moved around a little bit, been more proactive. We mustn't forget the work we did to get into the Super 12s. We'll look to build on that. Our catching wasn't so good in the last few games, but I know the boys worked really hard on that.'",
        "Suryakumar Yadav: 'I think the plan was very clear when me and Hardik were batting. He said let's take the positive route and see where we end up. We started hitting the ball well and never stopped till the 20th over. The atmosphere in the team is very nice, and the build-up to the knockouts has been very nice. My plan is always clear. I'm not trying anything different. I bat the same way in the nets as well. [On his 2022:] Feels really good, but coming out and starting from zero is what I always think when I come out to bat, and I'll keep doing that. It's good to see people come out and support us like this even after we've qualified.'"
