IND win by 71 runs, top Group 2

The Men in Blue have defeated the Zimbabwe side in the final game of Super 12. With this win, India finished have topped Group 2 with 8 points from 5 matches. Rohit and Co. were clinical with the bat and then with the ball as well. Rahul and Suryakumar set the tone for India. With his magnificent 62-run knock, Suryakumar has become the first Indian and only second in the world to score 1000 runs in T20Is in a calendar year. He is also the player of the match for today's match. Coming into bowl, India were equally brilliant as fast bowlers were on roll. Raza and Burl displayed some fight but it was way too late and way too much for them and they lost their wickets later. Also, Ashwin has surpassed Jasprit Bumrah to become the third-highest leading wicket-taker for India in T20Is. Zimbabwe got bowled out for 115 and India got a big 71-run win. Now we are heading into the biggest stages of the tournament. The Semifinals and the final. India will now face England in the second semi-final in Adelaide on 10th November, while Pakistan will have a crack at New Zealand in the first one in Sydney on 9th November. They shall be a cracker too. It was a pleasure bringing this game to you. See you soon, Ta Ta.

Suryakumar Yadav has led India to the highest T20I total in Melbourne Cricket Ground. He was in sensational touch today as well.
