After a thrilling ODI series win against South Africa, Babar Azam’s Pakistan will take on a depleted Proteas in a four-match T20I series. The 1st T20I between the two sides will be played at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday, April 10, from 6:00 PM, IST.

The visitors won the ODI series and would be pretty much high on confidence, while the same can’t be said about the hosts.

The Proteas have lost quite a few of their players due to various reasons – few are out with injuries, whereas five others are in India to play in the IPL 2021. Pakistan will aim to use these deficiencies to their advantage and get a lead in the series. However, the Proteas despite a herculean task at hand have a decent depth to counter the visitors.

In the absence of Temba Bevuma, Heinrich Klaasen will lead the hosts, while a swashbuckling Babar Azam continues to lead the visiting team.
