        "Hosts South Africa take on Pakistan in the first T20 of the 4-match series at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday.",
        "South Africa come into this T20 series after losing the ODI series to Pakistan a few days ago.",
        "Without many of their major stars who have left to feature in the T20 League, the Proteas have a point or two to prove as the build-up to the T20 World Cup continues.",
        "H Klaasen will lead an inexperienced side and will have a lot of responsibility on his shoulders along with A Markram and J Malan.",
        "On the bowling front, the team will have to bank on the likes of B Hendricks and L Sipamla to deliver good performances.",
        "T Shamsi, who was expensive in the ODI series, will have a key role to play.",
        "The visitors picked up an outstanding series win in the ODIs and now come into the T20s full of confidence.",
        "Led by B Azam and F Zaman, the batting was very solid right through the ODI series.",
        "M Hafeez adds more quality to the middle-order batting, their one weak point in the ODIs.",
        "The bowling too is well settled with Shaheen, H Rauf and the others doing well so far.",
        "U Qadir\u2019s role will be crucial during the middle phase of the innings.",
        "With both teams looking to win and start the series on a positive note, an entertaining game of cricket awaits us at the Bullring on Saturday."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Johannesburg is expected to have clear and sunny weather during the match. The temperature will be around 27 degrees during the game.",
        "Similar to the previous match played here, the pitch at the Wanderers is expected to be a batting beauty. The track is generally quite hard and the ball comes onto the bat easily. Pace bowlers will struggle after the initial phase and spinners will have to be careful with their lines on this flat surface.",
        "The average first innings score in the last five T20I matches played here has been 179 runs.",
        "The team batting first has won the last four T20I games played at this venue. So expect the captain winning the toss to bat first and put up a big total on the board. A score of around 190 runs should be a competitive one."

    "Others": [
        "J Malan played an attacking innings of 70 runs in the last ODI match against Pakistan. He has scored 110 runs in his five T20I innings so far, with the best score of 44 coming against the visitors in Lahore a few months ago.",
        "H Klaasen will be disappointed with his performance in the ODI series, scoring just 16 runs in three innings. He is a far better player than these numbers suggest. With a career strike rate of 150 in 16 T20Is, he will look to lead from the front in this match.",
        "T Shamsi is the No. 1 ranked T20I bowler in the world. He was very expensive in the first two matches of the ODI series against Pakistan and picked up just 1 wicket. Contrary to that, he has 10 wickets in the last six T20I matches, with best figures of 4 for 25 against Pakistan in Lahore.",
        "B Azam was in great form in the ODI series, scoring 228 runs at an average of 76, including a century and a score of 90. He will open the innings and will look to take full advantage of the inexperienced bowling attack of South Africa.",
        "M Hafeez is consistently scoring runs in the T20 format for the past couple of seasons. He has scored 5 half centuries in his last 10 innings, which includes scores of 86* and a 99* against England and New Zealand respectively. He will look to continue his good batting form here.",
        "H Rauf was the joint-highest wicket taker of the ODI series, with 7 wickets in three matches at an average of 24.42. He made a decent start to his T20I career, picking up 18 wickets in 13 matches. Although his economy rate of 9 is a little high, he is a wicket taker in this format."
