In Short
Virat Kohli's unbeaten 122 helped India post 212 for 2 in Dubai
Bhuvneshwar's 5-wicket haul restricted Afghanistan to 111
India ended a forgetful Asia Cup 2022 campaign on a high

Virat Kohli's 71st international hundred and Bhuvneshwar Kumar's second T20I five-wicket haul ensured that India ended a forgetful Asia Cup 2022 on a high as the KL Rahul-led side bulldozed past Afghanistan in their final Super 4 match in Dubai on Thursday, September 8.

IND vs AFG, Asia Cup 2022: Highlights

Ibrahim Zadran's 64 gave some respectability to Afghanistan's total after Bhuvneshwar ran through their top order as India secured a 101-run win over Mohammad Nabi's side in Dubai. Fast bowler Bhuvneshwar bowled one of the best spells in Twenty20 cricket by grabbing 5/4 with his brilliant swing bowling upfront before Afghanistan reached 111-8 and gave India its second-biggest win ever in a T20 international.

Afghanistan, which won its group games against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, faltered in the Super 4 stage, losing all three of its games. India also couldn’t make it to the final after losing to Sunday's finalists Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Earlier, Kohli smashed his first hundred since November 2019 as India posted an imposing 212 for two against Afghanistan in an inconsequential Asia Cup Super 4 match on Thursday.

His unbeaten effort off 61 balls got him his first hundred since November 2019 and 71st overall, equalling Ricky Ponting's tally of international hundreds. He is now only behind Sachin Tendulkar in the all-time list. With Rohit Sharma being rested for India's final game of the tournament, stand-in skipper K L Rahul (62 off 41) and Kohli shared an entertaining 119 off 76 balls for the opening wicket.

With India at 87 for no loss in 10 overs and Kohli on song, India looked set for a massive total. It was raining boundaries in the last five overs as Kohli reached the elusive three-figure mark with a crisp pull shot off pacer Fareed Ahmed. He took his helmet off and smiled before kissing his necklace as part of his celebration. He ended the innings in style by smashing two sixes and a four off Fazalhaq Farooqi to push India past 200.
