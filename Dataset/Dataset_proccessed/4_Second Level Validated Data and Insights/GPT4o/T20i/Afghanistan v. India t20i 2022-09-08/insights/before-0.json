        "Both teams will be hurting from their early exit in the tournament, with little but pride and game time to be accrued on Thursday.",
        "Rohit Sharma and India need a win on Thursday to avoid finishing last in the Super 4s.",
        "The clash will be particularly tough for Afghanistan for obvious reasons. Physically, the heat and humidity would've taken its toll on the players because they will have to turn up fresh less than 18 hours after their potboiler against Pakistan in Sharjah.",
        "Afghanistan have twice lost games they have been in control of and will have another opportunity to fight jangling nerves to close out games.",
        "Bhuvneshwar Kumar has had two poor outings, especially in the death overs. He's been tasked with the tough penultimate overs, both against Pakistan and Sri Lanka.",
        "Mujeeb Ur Rahman seemed to have lost a bit of his sting and X-factor due to form and injury concerns, leading to his T20 stocks taking a dip. But solid performances so far in the Asia Cup have helped him return as one of Afghanistan's premier spinners alongside Rashid Khan in their first XI."

        "Surfaces are slowly losing sheen, and it's becoming more helpful for the bowlers, especially if they're prepared to dig it in. However, the same surfaces seem to get just a tad quicker at night, making it easy for the chasing team despite the absence of dew.",
        "Only two of the 19 games have been won by the team batting first since January 2020 here.",
        "Weather-wise, it'll continue to remain hot and muggy, although the temperatures have dipped just a touch in the evening. From early 40s, we're down to the late 30s (Celsius) at night."

        "Prior to Wednesday's game, Rashid had picked up only 13 wickets in 13 T20Is played this year. However, he's been economical, conceding 6.26 runs per over.",
        "In the last 10 T20Is where India batted first, they have won on each of the six occasions where they've made 185 or more. They've failed to defend in three of the four games where they've fallen short of this score.",
        "Indian pacers have picked up only three wickets in the powerplay overs in this Asia Cup, averaging 58.66 at an economy rate of 8.06."
