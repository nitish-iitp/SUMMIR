West Indies looking to close out India as games head to Florida
By Staff Reporter
|  August 12, 2023
 
 
The West indies lead the series 2-1

Cricket lovers in the United States are in for a special treat when West Indies host India at the Broward County Stadium, in Fort Lauderhill, Florida for the 4th and 5th Kuhl Stylish Fans T20I Series, Powered by Black and White.

The West Indies and India teams arrived on Wednesday evening and trained at the venue on Thursday and Friday before the finale of the T20I Series concludes India’s tour of the West Indies and Florida with a back-to back weekend of T20 cricket.

The 4th T20I starts at 10:30am on Saturday 12 August, with the 5th and final T20I match also starting at 10:30am on Sunday 13 August.
Heading into this action-packed weekend, West Indies lead the Series 2-1, after winning the first game in Trinidad and the second in Guyana, before India rebounded with a victory in the third, in Guyana, on Tuesday, to set up what promises to be a blockbuster two-day showpiece in the sunshine of Greater Fort Lauderdale. At least 15,000 spectators are expected to attend, traveling in from around the USA, the Caribbean and beyond. A combined audience of over 200 million viewers will tune into the matches live on television and on their mobile devices.

Cricket West Indies, as hosts of the Kuhl Stylish Fans T20I Series, Powered by Black and White, are delighted by Visit Lauderdale and the Florida Sports Foundation’s support for the event as we seek to grow awareness of and participation in cricket in the USA, especially with a significant Caribbean diaspora in North America and such large communities of Indian cricket fans. Additionally, with the USA hosting ICC 2024 T20I World Cup matches, this is a great opportunity for Broward County Stadium as USA’s leading cricket venue to be showcasing two of the most exciting teams in world cricket ahead of next year’s World Cup.

Speaking on behalf of his team shortly after arrival, West Indies Head Coach, Daren Sammy, said: “We’re excited to be back in Fort Lauderdale and we thank the great hosts here for welcoming us and staging the matches. We’re really looking forward to this weekend. There is a lot to play for and we really want to put on a good show for the fans. It’s always non-stop action when we play at Broward County Stadium … the atmosphere is amazing … we feel at home. The players are pumped up for what is to come in these two matches. We’d love to see local Floridians come out and enjoy.”

Stacy Ritter, President and CEO of Visit Lauderdale, said: “Greater Fort Lauderdale is enormously proud to sponsor this tournament and showcase Broward County Stadium, the leading cricket stadium in the United States, to cricket fans from all over the globe.”
Ritter continued: “We welcome everyone under the sun and are delighted to host these remarkable athletes and their devoted fans in what promises to be a weekend filled with great sportsmanship and competition.”

The two teams will feature some of the most dynamic and entertaining players in the cricket. West Indies are led by captain Rovman Powell and have in their ranks talismanic allrounder, Jason Holder,, and wicket-keeper/batsman Nicholas Pooran who won the Player-of-the-Match awards in the first and second matches.
India is led by Hardik Pandya, a star performer with bat and ball, and their squad includes world stars such as Suryakumar Yadav in their powerful batting line-up and left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav leading the bowling attack.
