Match Details


Time: 1:30 PM IST
Date:  October 29, 2022
Venue: Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney
Ball-by-Ball commentary: SportsTiger App

Preview:


Kane Williamson-led New Zealand is currently leading the chart with three points and +4.450 net-run rate. The Kiwis registered comprehensive win over Australia in the World Cup opener and settled with one point as the match against Afghanistan was abandoned due to constant rain. 

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka clinched opening game against Ireland by 9 wickets but were completely outplayed by defending champions Australia in their last fixture. Both the teams will be eager to put up a great show in their upcoming fixture to ensure crucial points.


Pitch Report:


Sydney Cricket Ground provides great edge to the batters and close to 180 can be expected score from the team batting first. The surface also provides true pace and bounce, and bowlers will need to ready themselves well to make a mark in the game.


Team Analysis:


Sri Lanka:


Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis were crucial at the top-order as both the batters played instrumental knocks in first two games. Dhananjaya de Silva also played vital knocks in both the games and team will rely heavily on him in the game vs New Zealand. Charith Asalanka's 38 off 25 deliveries was also key contribution from the side against Australia, but Bhanuka Rajapaksa, and Dasun Shanaka needs to step up as the going gets tough. Speaking of bowling, Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga picked two wickets in first game but leaked too many runs against Australia. Bowling will have a main concern for Sri Lanka as the bowlers have been leaking too many runs.


Probable XI:


Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Dhananjaya de Silva, Charith Asalanka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka (c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Binura Fernando, Lahiru Kumara


New Zealand:


Kane Williamson-led side had a terrific outing at Sydney Cricket Ground when they played against Australia in World Cup opener. Devon Conway-propelled New Zealand to 200/3 in the first innings with his brilliant 92 off 58 deliveries. Finn Allen delivered another noteworthy performance against Australia as he smashed 42 off 16 deliveries. New Zealand's middle-order stepped up against Australia and will be looking strong against Sri Lanka. James Neesham (26 off 13) also played superb knock vs Australia. Mitchell Santner and Tim Southee picked three wickets in the opening game and the team will hope similar performance from the squad against Sri Lanka.


Probable playing XI:


Devon Conway (wk), Finn Allen, Kane Williamson (c), Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Lockie Ferguson, Trent Boult


Match prediction:


  


Conclusion:


Although Sri Lanka is a newly crowned Asian champions, New Zealand looks formidable against the island nation. Kane Williamson-led side is riding high on confidence as they crushed defending champions in the opening game and will look to continue their red-hot form in the tournament against Sri Lanka. New Zealand is likely to win the game against Sri Lanka.
