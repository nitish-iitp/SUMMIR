Namibia vs Oman Scorecard and Highlights: Post-match comments

Namibia Captain - Gerhard Erasmus : Difficult to get momentum through the innings, we tried by getting the singles and doubles but every now and then we needed those boundaries which were difficult to execute. On a pitch like that, you need to take responsibillity after batting 15-20 balls, and you shouldn't allow new batters to face. In the Super Over we proved that there are runs to be had if you just assess the pitch well and take responsibility. (On Wiese bowling Super Over) David was up in the change room and he was very clear that he wanted to bowl the Super Over. (On the win) Happy to break the duck and get through in this tournament. We were very excited to come here and play in this competition, hopefully we can continue this form.

Oman Captain- Aqib Ilyas: Would have enjoyed the game if we would have won, but this is part of cricket. Credit goes to Namibia. (On first innings) Credit goes to Trumpelmann for the way he executed, and then our batters adjusted well. However, when we were set we should have gone for more runs. We knew the wicket was on the turning side, and we could have put more pressure with some more runs on the board. (On Super Over) I think Bilal is one of the best bowlers at associate level, but there are days when you don't execute. He was very clear and we were very clear that he should bowl. But he didn't execute and the batsman did well. That is cricket, it happens.

David Wiese - Player of the Match: Lost a couple of years tonight, don't know how many I have left in me now. Just been that kind of an emotionally draining game. (On his Super Over bowling) I had a feel for the wicket and knew what I had to execute in the Super Over. The pitch was difficult, was a bit two-paced and different to what we expected. I think we adapted well and it was surely a pitch where you had to spend some time out there. I think if we were chasing 180, we would have had to attack without thinking too much about the pitch, so tough to say what would have been a par total on this wicket.

Namibia (Team News)

Under the guidance of coach Pierre de Bruyn, Namibia is participating in their third consecutive T20 World Cup. They are optimistic about replicating their 2021 success when they reach the Super 12s.

Namibia has benefited from acquiring former international players, most notably their star all-rounder, ex-South Africa international David Wiese.

At 38, Wiese remains the standout player in a well-balanced squad that mixes youth and experience. Gerhard Erasmus leads the team as captain, with JJ Smit as vice-captain. The exciting left-arm pace of Ruben Trumpelmann is another key asset to watch.

Despite coming into the tournament after a heavy defeat to Australia in Thailand, where they were bowled out for 119-9 and conceded the target in just ten overs, they remain a formidable side.

Oman (Team News)

Oman, an emerging force among the associate nations over the last decade, has seen a decline but still possesses a significant pedigree.

Under coach Duleep Mendis, the team is led by captain Aqib Ilyas and includes experienced players like Mehran Khan, Zeeshan Maqsood, Fayyaz Butt, and Kaleemullah.

Oman enters the tournament following a washout in their final warm-up match against Afghanistan, where they managed to bat and score 154-3, with Ilyas contributing 66 runs off 48 balls.

Before that, they were runners-up in the ACC T20 Premier Cup to the United Arab Emirates in April, indicating their competitive edge remains sharp.

Pitch Report: Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados

The average batting score at the venue last year was 164, while teams batting first have the advantage here. The pitch generally has enough for the batsmen to be expressive in their stroke play. The new ball does tend to swerve around a bit under lights as well. The rain in the lead-up to the games shouldn't play a big role.
