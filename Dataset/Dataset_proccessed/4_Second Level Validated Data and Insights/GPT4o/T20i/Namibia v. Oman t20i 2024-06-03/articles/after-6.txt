T20 World Cup, NAM vs OMA Highlights: Hello and welcome to our coverage of Match 3 of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 where Namibia take on Oman at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Namibia scored a thrilling super over victory over Oman on Sunday.

David Wiese was the hero for the Africans, blasting 13 runs in Namibia’s super over total of 21 before then restricting Oman to 10 runs to seal victory.

The match at Kensington Oval went to a super over after a nerve-jangling low-scoring battle which saw Oman bundled out for 109.

Namibia’s run-chase then faltered after a stunning bowling performance by Oman’s Mehran Khan saw them finish on 109-6 to set up the super over drama.

Earlier, Namibia won the toss and opted to bowl first. Ruben Trumpelmann bagged four wickets, including two with his first two balls, as Namibia skittled Oman for 109 all out in 19.4 overs.

South African-born fast bowler Trumpelmann trapped opener Kashyap Prajapati lbw for a golden duck with the first ball of the match, and then followed it up moments later with a toe-crusher to get rid of Oman skipper Aqib Ilyas for a duck.

Zeeshan Maqsood survived the Namibian quick’s hat-trick ball but there was little respite for Oman, who were soon three down after Trumpelmann claimed his third scalp in the third over.

Naseem Khushi attempted an ambitious slog over mid-off but instead failed to connect cleanly and was comfortably caught by Gerhard Erasmus.

Maqsood steadied the ship briefly for Oman with 22 off 20 balls, but his token resistance ended after falling lbw to Bernard Scholtz as Namibia’s decision to bowl first at the Kensington Oval continued to reap dividends.

Wickets continued to fall regularly as Namibia’s bowlers dominated a timid Oman batting line-up, with Erasmus taking the wickets of Ayaan Khan and Mohammad Nadeem to leave the Gulf state reeling at 78-6.

Trumpelmann grabbed his fourth wicket after removing Tangeni Lungameni lbw for 2, finishing with figures of 4-21 off four overs.

While Trumpelmann was the pick of the Namibian bowlers, David Wiese also caught the eye with 3-28 off 3.4 overs.

Zeeshan Maqsood then took the attack to the opponents and played a good knock of 22 for his side. The side lost it’s top order cheaply and were in all sorts of trouble with the scorecard reflecting 37 for 4 after 6.3 overs.

Khalid Kail was the pick of the batters as he scored 34 while others got a start but failed to capitalize when it mattered. Tremendous bowling performance from the Namibia bowlers to restrict Oman to just 109 runs.
