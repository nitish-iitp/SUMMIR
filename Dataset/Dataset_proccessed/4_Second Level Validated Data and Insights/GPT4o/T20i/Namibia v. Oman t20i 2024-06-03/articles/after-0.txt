Namibia National Cricket Team vs Oman National Cricket Team Live Score Updates: The ICC T20 World Cup 2024 has commenced with some exciting cricket actions. Both the opening games have been nail-biters with solid competition between the participant teams. In the third match of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group B members Namibia and Oman will take on each other at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Namibia impressed with their performance in the last two ICC T20 World Cup editions. They qualified for the Super 8 stages in the 2021 edition. Oman are a competitive side too having impressed in the ACC T20 Premier Cup and both teams will look to start their campaign with a win. Aaron Jones Opens Up After Playing Match-Winning Knock In ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Opener, Says 'Hopefully My Innings Will Open Eyes of Those Who Don't Know Me or USA Cricket'.

In the recent series against Oman, Namibia went with the opening pair of JP Kotze and Malan Kruger. The duo gave a few good starts to the Namibia innings with JP Kotze accumulating the most runs in the competition. Namibia National cricket team's strength still remains their middle order of Gerhard Erasmus, JJ Smit, David Wiese and Jan Fryling. The plethora of experience and versatility in the Namibia middle order gives them an edge over others. The bowling of Namibia is also potent with Ruben Trumplemann and Ben Shikongo leading their attack.

Oman on the other hand are more reliant on their top four. Kashyap Prajapati, Aqib Ilyas, Zeeshan Maqsood and Ayaan Khan has been their strength. The recent promotion of Naseem Khushi at the top of the order has given them added boost and the batter has given them solid starts allowing the middle order to ease their way a little bit into the innings. Fayyaz Butt and Mehran Khan have to take the responsibility of the bowling providing the team with regular wickets as they will have the challenge of the restricting the potent middle order of Namibia. Fans React to Chris Gayle's 'Fully Charged' Instagram Story While He Attends WI vs PNG T20 World Cup 2024 Match.
