    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Oman Captain, Aqib Ilyas: It's good to bat on a fresh wicket and the ball will come on nicely in the night. Really good to play, lots of plans but this is the time to execute it. Everyone is fit.",
        "Namibia Captain, Gerhard Erasmus: We gonna have a bowl, looks a good wicket and there's some rain around later maybe. We gotta go out there and show what we are about. We need to execute our skills in the middle."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Namibia Captain - Gerhard Erasmus: Difficult to get momentum through the innings, we tried by getting the singles and doubles but every now and then we needed those boundaries which were difficult to execute. On a pitch like that, you need to take responsibility after batting 15-20 balls, and you shouldn't allow new batters to face. In the Super Over we proved that there are runs to be had if you just assess the pitch well and take responsibility. David was up in the change room and he was very clear that he wanted to bowl the Super Over. Happy to break the duck and get through in this tournament. We were very excited to come here and play in this competition, hopefully we can continue this form.",
        "Oman Captain- Aqib Ilyas: Would have enjoyed the game if we would have won, but this is part of cricket. Credit goes to Namibia. Credit goes to Trumpelmann for the way he executed, and then our batters adjusted well. However, when we were set we should have gone for more runs. We knew the wicket was on the turning side, and we could have put more pressure with some more runs on the board. I think Bilal is one of the best bowlers at associate level, but there are days when you don't execute. He was very clear and we were very clear that he should bowl. But he didn't execute and the batsman did well. That is cricket, it happens.",
        "David Wiese - Player of the Match: Lost a couple of years tonight, don't know how many I have left in me now. Just been that kind of an emotionally draining game. I had a feel for the wicket and knew what I had to execute in the Super Over. The pitch was difficult, was a bit two-paced and different to what we expected. I think we adapted well and it was surely a pitch where you had to spend some time out there. I think if we were chasing 180, we would have had to attack without thinking too much about the pitch, so tough to say what would have been a par total on this wicket."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Namibia will be taking on Oman in the third match of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados.",
        "Namibia has benefited from acquiring former international players, most notably their star all-rounder, ex-South Africa international David Wiese.",
        "Oman enters the tournament following a washout in their final warm-up match against Afghanistan, where they managed to bat and score 154-3, with Ilyas contributing 66 runs off 48 balls.",
        "The average batting score at the venue last year was 164, while teams batting first have the advantage here. The pitch generally has enough for the batsmen to be expressive in their stroke play. The new ball does tend to swerve around a bit under lights as well. The rain in the lead-up to the games shouldn't play a big role."
