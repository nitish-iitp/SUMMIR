        "Ireland\u2019s victory over England in their most recent match will boost their morale as they return to the same field.",
        "Since they haven\u2019t won a game, Afghanistan would be under pressure, and these circumstances don\u2019t favor them.",
        "Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie, Ireland\u2019s starters, are in good shape, which increases the team\u2019s chances.",

        "They defeated Afghanistan in their most recent IT20 match, so they will be very confident going into this game."

        "The vast boundaries in Melbourne are challenging to clear, thus it is never the simplest venue to bat. You may anticipate that the surface will provide grip for the spinners and assistance to quick bowlers."
