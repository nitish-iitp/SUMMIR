        "Andy Balbirnie, Ireland Captain: Very disappointing. We'd played good cricket and were looking forward to this. Can't do much about the weather. We struggled with the West Indies facing Sri Lanka. We tried to back up the win, unlike before, after the England game and turn up today but couldn't. We will fly up tomorrow. It'll be like a different country up in Brisbane. We want to push the champions. Lots of things happening, so it's difficult. After the last time, they always text when there are wins but none when there aren't but hopefully the support will grow in the future.",
        "Mohammad Nabi, Afghanistan Captain: Most of the players are disappointed, not having played on such a fantastic ground. Rashid and I have played but others haven't but weather is not in our control. So we have to accept it. We look forward to the future games and hope to win. The preparation, coming in, was good. We looked to rectify our mistakes and were looking forward to today but it didn't happen. We made a plan to put runs on the board to allow our spinners to defend it. In the first game, we saw our mistakes and wanted to learn it. We watched Zimbabwe - Pakistan, they played well and fought till the last ball. All teams are trying their best. From last five years, Rashid and I have played Big Bash. We've talked to team-mates about how to play in Australia."
