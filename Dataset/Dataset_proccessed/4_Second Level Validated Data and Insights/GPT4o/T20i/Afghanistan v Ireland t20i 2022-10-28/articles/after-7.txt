Match Centre 
Comms: Ekanth and Himanshu

Well, sigh, thanks for tuning in. See you at the England-Australia fixture on the same ground. Let's hope the chances of play and our spirits are back up by then. For now, it's goodbye from me Ekanth, my co-commentator, Himanshu, and our scorer, M Venkat Raghav.

Sam: ""Alex confirms we started losing overs at approximately 3.35pm. He adds that the cut-off time is approximately 5.45pm."Wait, what happened? Cut off time approximately 5.45pm but game has been called off at 4.33pm?" The rain was persistent, the outfield also didn't show promise.

Andy: "For all those saying play in stadiums with a roof, or not in rainy season. This time of year in most of Australia is relatively dry, however the current weather patterns have led to Sydney thus far this year having twice its average annual rainfall and an all time record amount of rain with 2 months still to come. Most of eastern Australia is like this currently. Also there is only one stadium with a roof in Australia suitable for cricket, and that stadium was not primarily intended for cricket."

Abhilash: "I was ready to prepare popcorn " Ideally, you'll have more for the next game.

God: ""Nasser Hussain says the sun has not come out for a couple of days"weeks, Nas, weeks." Thank God for the correction.

Marshal: "ICC Could have scheduled swimming contest for all the team.. Just a thought..."

Andy Balbirnie, Ireland Captain: Very disappointing. We'd played good cricket and were looking forward to this. Can't do much about the weather. We struggled with the West Indies facing Sri Lanka. We tried to back up the win, unlike before, after the England game and turn up today but couldn't. (What's next?) We will fly up tomorrow. It'll be like a different country up in Brisbane. We want to push the champions. Lots of things happening, so it's difficult. After the last time, (On texts from home after the last game) They always text when there are wins but none when there aren't but hopefully the support will grow in the future.

Mohammad Nabi, Afghanistan Captain: Most of the players are disappointed, not having played on such a fantastic ground. Rashid and I have played but others haven't but weather is not in our control. So we have to accept it. We look forward to the future games and hope to win. The preparation, coming in, was good. We looked to rectify our mistakes and were looking forward to today but it didn't happen. We made a plan to put runs on the board to allow our spinners to defend it. In the first game, we saw our mistakes and wanted to learn it. We watched Zimbabwe - Pakistan, they played well and fought till the last ball. All teams are trying their best. From last five years, Rashid and I have played Big Bash. We've talked to team-mates about how to play in Australia.

English and Australian supporters have made their way into the stands. Nasser Hussain says the sun has not come out for a couple of days. Till then, all we can do is hope. And maybe ponder over Bilaal's philosophical question "Doesn't MCG have a roof? "

4:33pm: The umpires and captains shake hands, so this might be done. Danyal says it is. So the game has been abandoned without toss and, of course, a ball being bowled. It's a pity for the fans and the teams, particularly with the MCG dishing out fantastic games. That takes Ireland to No. 2 on the Points Table. Afghanistan have had two successive games abandoned. They have two points but are at the bottom of the table due to their loss against England. They are below Australia due to not having a win. Rashid Khan has a chat with one of the chuffed kids in the crowd and poses for a selfie. Anyway, Australia are scheduled to play England here in the day but going by the forecasts, that might be rain-affected too.

4:30pm: Alex confirms we started losing overs at approximately 3.35pm. He adds that the cut-off time is approximately 5.45pm but not official. Could be somewhere between then and 6.04pm. There's some flexibility in the match referee's calculations. For now, the covers are still on. The umpires walk out with umbrellas, there was a wet patch just outside the boundary ropes. They prod and step on parts of the grass. They've called the captains and have a talk. Everyone's in smiles as the chat begins.

abhim: "Justify whatever way you may like to" lol

4:12pm: News is that the next inspection is scheduled for when rain stops. So it's indefinite.

Shwe's comment answers: "To those unaware, it is NOT "rainy season" in Australia. This is extreme rain caused by the La Nina weather pattern which has extended well beyond initial forecasts. Generally come Spring there is plenty of sunshine here and Australia (with the exception of Brisbane) generally has a very low incidence of significant match time lost to rain."

Jordan: "What exactly is 'the rainy season in Australia'? Australia's a huge place. It's dry in some places right now, and not in others. Host it in summer and you might get rain in other places. The Sydney Test in early Jan is pretty much always rain affected."

Jed Fenwick : "I feel like a sort of retractable fabric (waterproof) roof is something that stadiums should seriously invest in. This way, if it begins raining, there would be a minimal stop in play before the game could resume, with the roof up. Your thoughts?" The solution is brought up in every rain-affected match. But the long list of variables starting with finances of boards and stadiums are tough hurdles to overcome.

Ron Saywack has a premonition: "Unfortunately, this match is a washout. Let's hope we can get the second one in, or some part of it."

4:05pm: The delay continues. Umpires, Aleem Dar and Adrian Holdstock, walked out of the tunnel with umbrellas up. Saw the drizzle continuing and went back. Some Irish players, including Andy Balbirnie, were out, also with an umbrella, having a chat. Assuming the game will happen, we can be sure that we've started losing overs.

Subrat : "@Kartik - don't need superheroes for that. Just sensible people to not play the tournament during rainy season in Australia, or make the games go ahead indoors somehow." A lot of comments on the scheduling. But it's worth remembering a few things. Australian cricket grounds are used for AFL, leaving it with a shorter window. That's further abridged by the Big Bash and an international summer. Also South Africa, who are touring this time, have their home season and T20 league too to collectively complicate scheduling.

Kartik: "Only if we had superheroes that could make rain stop?? Marvel u listening?"

3:55pm: Thanks Himanshu, let's see if the hymns and chants have done their magic at the inspection which is scheduled to happen in five minutes.

Zahirshah : "Feel sorry for Afghanistan, their last match was washed out by rain and this one is in the verge of being abandoned as well. "

Sanjiv: "Just a fictional thought if the matches can be played in the rains with water proof leather balls and bats! " Grass and air would still be affected but at least, as the subreddit goes, ThereWasAnAttempt to find a solution.

3.50pm There is no further news from the G, as our wait keeps extending. Meanwhile, here comes Ekanth with more hope and prayers.

Babar: "Here 05:40am in London and still waiting. Can't wait to see Farooqi swinging the ball in this wet and cloudy day, really suits him! Btw I've got to get up at 8:00" --- You've got to get up at 8, but you're up already. Sleep not again, lest Farooqi gets to do his business in the time...

3.26pm It is raining again, Alex says. Covers being pulled back on.

Shivam Bhatia: "Can they officially include Rains as an associate nation and the 13th team in points table now? Wonder if rain makes it to top 4 by the end of this round!!" --- There is scope of it winning the World Cup too

Aamir: "" While it rains at the MCG, tell us what you have been up to - except, of course, waiting for the rain to stop and the action to start."-- Refreshing Cricinfo every two seconds. " --- Best thing ever...

While it rains at the MCG, tell us what you have been up to - except, of course, waiting for the rain to stop and the action to start.

Sanjay Chellane: "Its bright and Sunny here in Sydney. If the players can take the 5pm flight from Melbourne, they can have a full game here starting at 8pm...tickets can be opened now itself, it will surely be sold in 5hrs" --- Now that's what the ICC should have thought of long ago... Hopefully they are still reading this

Stephen: "Is there any permutation where England get knocked out on a boundary countback? (From a black caps fan - still not over it.)" --- Do we have the boundary numbers already?

Another not-so-discouraging from Alex: Not for the first or last time today, the MCG ground staff are going through the futile routine of removing the covers despite more rain on the radar.

Kumar: "Been looking outside and it has been absolutely sunny. (Helps that I'm from Chennai, though)" --- Which is pretty much the case all year round there...

"I can see The G from my balcony 2 kms away. It isn't raining since last half an hour" --- Can you somehow also the see the sun, Saahil?

3.15pm So let's work out some permutations and combinations for the day. Assuming this gets rained out and the teams share points, Ireland will move up two places to No. 2 in the table, while Afghanistan will also climb as many steps to No. 4. But if Ireland win, they will become table toppers albeit for a short while; if Afghanistan win, they will jump up to No. 2.

Sathish Kumar: "Melbourne is hosting the finals as well... Do we have a reserve if the match gets washed out on finals" --- Yup, there is a reserve day for the final

Hello everyone. Rain rain has come again... But, but, but... who knows what the Gods have in mind?

3pm: The covers on the pitch and the bowler's run up. Some covers are being rolled in onto the square. So, the delays will continue. There will be an inspection at 4pm local time, an hour away from meaning the likelihood of losing overs increases. The game might even get washed out. Where's the solace in all this? Well, Himanshu Agrawal's entering comms, backing up the notion that there's always a bright side.

As we wait, you can catch up on the thriller where Zimbabwe edged over Pakistan. Player of the match Sikandar Raza had Ricky Ponting to thank for some inspiration. Find out more here.

sajjad Amrana: "are spectators enjoying 2 matches on a single ticket?" Yes, says Alex. You purchase a match day ticket and can watch both games.

2:45pm: Looks like one of the covers on the squares is being removed. There are a few people on the field. It's still gloomy though.

Nick: "A no result could actually help Australia you know? England still have to play New Zealand and Sri Lanka leaving Australia with the easier remaining pool games."

Moose : "Local from Melbourne. Lived here for 37 years. , my dad taught me everything about our lovely weather . Only first game in doubt today but I expect we will get a 5 over a side game. Game 2 should get the full overs "

2:30pm: It's official, the toss has been delayed. It's indefinite for now, the rain is persistent. Alex Malcolm texts, 'Now they are covering the run ups'.

Siva: "What happens if both games get washed today? Where do teams stand then?" Not sure. Afghanistan will go over Australia after this game on the points table. But Australia's game scheduled for later today, against England, is on the same ground. So who knows what'll happen!

Adam, like JOYDEEPSINGHGIL, suggests an alternative: "Send the double header to Perth or Brisbane where there's actual sunshine - or even to Marvel Stadium down the road. Can't see much play today, it's been a shocking wet week."

The upside of the delay is that it gives you time to check out Crictos. Through this tournament, we're picking the best moments from the games with our video experts in a daily show. And if you want to actually own a piece of those moments, they are available as digital memorabilia on FanCraze, ESPNcricinfo's digital collectible partners. On FanCraze, you can pre-buy iconic moments from each match of the World Cup called the Crictos of the Game.

2:22pm: Alex says, 'And it's raining. Covers coming on and everyone leaving the ground.' We're a handful of minutes away from the toss, a delay is almost (if not completely) certain.

Michael: "No rain? I live about 2km from the MCG and it's been chucking it down all day and most of yesterday. I'll be astonished if there's any play in the first game today and would expect at best a shortened game this evening if things improve soonish." There's a mizzle, which might be one of the words of the tournament. Actually, scratch that. It's picking up.

Dimitri: "Weather here in Melbourne is much better than yesterday but I'll still be amazed if we don't get a washout. In the event that we actually get a match out of this, let's go Ireland!"

2:15pm: Umpires Aleem Dar and Adrian Holdstock walk out into the field to have a look. They are holding umbrellas, which for now, are closed. They're looking for wet patches and are gently stepping on them to check the status. Updates on toss coming soon, but don't be surprised if there's a delay.

In the USA, you can watch the Afghanistan vs Ireland game LIVE on ESPN+ in English and in Hindi.

2:10pm: The grass on the MCG pitch has been retained, so expect assistance for the pacers. So expect ample swing and seam movement. The outfield might not be as quick though. Alex Malcolm, from the ground, pings, 'there is no rain at the moment but the radar does not look good'.

2pm: The MCG has taken upon itself to put up thrillers on demand. After India - Pakistan, Ireland managed to inch past England via DLS. Now they take on Afghanistan under similar weather conditions. There was heavy rain yesterday and is, as Peter Della Penna mentions in the preview, 80% chance from 8 am until 8 pm today. Afghanistan's last game against New Zealand here got washed out, they'll want this to be played out to ensure their roadway to the semi-finals is in their control.
