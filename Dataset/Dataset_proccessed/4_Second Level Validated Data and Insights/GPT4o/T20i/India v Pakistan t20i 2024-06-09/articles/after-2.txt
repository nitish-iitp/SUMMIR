Just how big was the India-Pakistan T20 Cricket World Cup match Sunday at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium? 

Let’s hear it from Basit Qadri, a 29-year-old Pakistan fan who came from Baltimore just to stand outside the gates with a bunch of pals and watch the action from afar. 

“Think of it as a Super Bowl — bigger than that,” he insisted. “That’s what it is.”

All around Eisenhower Park fans were ecstatic just to be there, to see perhaps the greatest sports rivalry in the world play out in New York. 

By the end, India fans — who outnumbered Pakistan fans at the stadium, perhaps 10-to-1 — were absolutely gaga after their team pulled off a shocking 119-113 to win.

At one point, India had less than a 2% statistical chance of winnings and fans were streaming out of the stadium early.

“Pakistan are cruising to victory. It’s going to be a comfortable win for them,” said Jashan Kalra, 24, a product analyst from Long Island City, Queens, who sported a blue India cricket jersey. 

“And I also didn’t want to see — there’s no animosity or anything — but I didn’t want to see the Pakistani fans rejoicing and rubbing it in our faces. So just trying to avoid that and walk with my head held high as much as possible.”

Head held high, but he also missed the thrilling conclusion of the match for India.

“In the beginning, we thought it was impossible but they really pulled it out towards the end. … Fans were very excited, especially towards the end,” said Arsh Singh, an India supporter who left his home in Woodbridge, New Jersey, at 6 a.m. to make sure he got to the stadium in time.

“Stomping going on. I was a little concerned that the scaffolding might not hold up but it did well.“

Hem Nerkar, 51, who came from Cary, North Carolina, said: “I’ve never seen such amazing energy. Always expected with India-Pakistan games. Fantastic energy.”

But, he added — nobody was expecting India to win like that.

Fans of the sport came to New York from all across the globe.

Recent Harvard graduates Kartikeya Bhatotia, 27, and Aashish Khullar, 37, both Indian nationals living in Boston, said they were thrilled to see the longstanding rivalry come to the US.

“[I’m] pretty excited,” Aashish told The Post. “Yeah, actually it’s kind of cool to come and see the stadium. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an international cricket game in a stadium.”

The pair bought opposing jerseys as they walked through the stadium’s nearly-full parking lot, with Kartikeya buying a green Pakistan jersey and Aashish buying an orange and blue Indian jersey.

There was reportedly a 90-10 split between India and Pakistan fans.

“Even if it’s not about cricket, India v. Pakistan has always been a cultural thing so it’s nice to see it in person,” Kartikeya said.

There seemed to be a 90-10 split between fans, with India supporters far outnumbering those of Pakistan.

Kashif Sheriz, 49, flew to the Big Apple from the UK just to see the highly coveted match.

“We’re here to support Pakistan all the way from London,” Sheriz said, wearing a green Pakistan jersey he bought outside the stadium. “It’s going to be a tough match, it’s going to be a good match, it’s going to be an exciting match. But this is the team that’s going to win. Green all the way.”

Sheriz lauded Long Island — and the US — for welcoming cricket into the country with open arms.

[“It’s] amazing here. Good atmosphere. You guys are so hospitable and I hope the Americans take upon the fever of cricket and I hope enjoy it as much as we and enjoy it,” he said, adding, “And America is doing well. America beat Pakistan, so, you know. Between the fans we don’t have any rivalry — it’s only on the pitch. When the game starts, that’s where it’s all going to kick in.”

Excited fans donned wigs, signs, flags and other merchandise in support of their teams, with many fans showing up bright and early to claim a spot in the parking lot — which an attendant said had met half-capacity by 8 a.m.

“F—ing crazy but it’s good stuff — good vibes,” a parking lot attendant told The Post.

Joe La Porta, 32, with girlfriend Yesha Vayda came from Albany to watch the match decked out in India jerseys.

“This is my first match…and [my girlfriend] she’s really into cricket,” La Porta said.

“I got myself into it since last year with the World Cup so I’m going to my first match here for T20. I’m really excited. We got lucky that we’re just a three-hour drive down here that we can actually go see something like this.”

“I haven’t been to a cricket match in 10 years,” Yesha said, adding that she was excited to see India team caption Rohit Sharma, who she says was her classmate in India.

“It’s going to be a great match. I think India is going to win for sure. Let’s go India.”

Groups of cricket enthusiasts rooting on both India and Pakistan clung to the gates outside the stadium as the close match unfolded inside, now and then erupting into cheers as music pulsated from the arena. 

Bobby Mehra, 49, and Arjun Singh, 45, both banking technology specialists cheering on India, left the game early in hopes of beating traffic back to Summit, New Jersey.

What do you think? Post a comment.

“We’re going home,” Bobby said. “We’re going back to Jersey. It’s going to be a madhouse with traffic. It was a tough match.”

Despite what will surely be a long drive home, the two were thrilled to have watched a cricket match so close to home. 

“It’s an amazing feeling,” Bobby, who was born in India said. “It’s the energy in and of itself.” 

“The game of cricket, in the U.S., people don’t know. Suddenly seeing all the people from all over the U.S. in the stadium. It’s important to have the people.” 

The India vs. Pakistan match, part of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 tournament, follows a stunning U.S. win against Pakistan on Thursday.
