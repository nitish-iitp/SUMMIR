Bangladesh upset Sri Lanka

Bangladesh have continued the run of upsets against the favourites at this year’s T20 World Cup with a two-wicket win against 2014 champions Sri Lanka on Saturday.

Pathum Nissanka was the top scorer for Sri Lanka with 44 while Towhid Hridoy hit 40 to lead Bangladesh’s chase after Sri Lanka post 124-9.

Nuwan Thushara took 4-18 in his four overs as Sri Lanka fought back, but it was too little, too late – especially after their own collapse with the bat from 99-3.

Goodbye for now!

The match that everyone in the cricketing world had circled on their calendars ended up delivering a thrilling contest!

India, despite a subpar total of 119 on a tricky wicket, managed to beat Pakistan by six runs.

Pakistan, who looked in complete control in the first half of the innings, began to lose their way in the second.

Through a combination of disciplined bowling, ill-advised shots and dot ball pressure, their innings began to unravel.

This result now leaves them in a situation where they must win against both Canada and Ireland in order to have a chance at qualification into the Super Eights stage.

Mind you, USA and India both have four points after their two games, so they will certainly have something to say about that.

We hope you enjoyed this iconic matchup, and till the next time, this is Rohan Sharma, Kevin Hand and Hafsa Adil signing off for Al Jazeera.

𝙒𝙃𝘼𝙏. 𝘼. 𝙒𝙄𝙉! 🙌 🙌

Make that 2⃣ in 2⃣! 👌 👌

Simply outstanding from #TeamIndia to seal a superb 6⃣-run win in New York! 👏 👏

‘Pakistan can still qualify’

For those asking, yes, Pakistan can still qualify for the Super 8s. They need to beat Canada & Ireland. And then need USA to lose to India & Ireland. And also have a superior net run rate. So yes, they can. But at this point...do you even want them to...? Right now, not so sure.

‘One should never lose hope’

Aroom Munawar, 24, a student in Rawalpindi in Pakistan, feels sad about the loss: “There is regret [about not beating India despite a low score]. But, as they say, one should never lose hope. Pakistan needs to improve in all facets of the game. Bowling was better today, but it was the batting where we lacked.”

‘It doesn’t feel nice to be on the losing side’

Siyam, 24, a Pakistan cricket fan in Rawalpindi, says “It was a small total which should have been chased. It doesn’t feel nice to be on the losing side when you have such a small total to chase. The pitch was not easy, but India dealt with the challenge and played better than us.”
