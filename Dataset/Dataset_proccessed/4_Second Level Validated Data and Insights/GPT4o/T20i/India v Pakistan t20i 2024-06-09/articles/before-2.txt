T20WC 2024 | INDvPAK: A spicy pitch, a spicy history, and a SPICY REUNION
By Mumbai Indians | 08 JUN, 2024

Suppose there is one event that can shake the boundaries in the romance of this sport, the reservoir of emotions, the portfolios of entertainment and talent and the magical exhibition of a rivalry. In that case, it is a game in which India and Pakistan are involved.

This is not just a rivalry; it's a clash of titans that has stood the test of time. It's a battle of courage and a sheer display of competitiveness and authority between two of the most prominent cricket-playing nations in the world. And ahead of the latest chapter in this epic duel, India stands tall with eight wins in 12 meetings in T20Is. Furthermore, the record is 5-1 in seven T20 World Cup clashes, a testament to their dominance.

The Men in Blue have been dominant, winning five of the last six T20 World Cup head-to-head clashes. However, it's crucial to remember that past records don't always dictate future outcomes. Pakistan, renowned for their unpredictability, could turn the tables this time, adding an element of thrill and suspense to the match.

So Paltan! The greatest of all cricket battles is upon us. And a spectacle to savour awaits on a stage that always reserves the best for the audience - the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. We count on you to come in your most stylish India-supporting avatar, with all refreshments and your heartbeat meters in check. Your support is crucial, as Rohit Sharma and his Men in Blue thrive on your energy and would want you to keep recharging them with your staunch waves of support.

What: India vs Pakistan

When: Sunday, June 9, 2024

Where: Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York

What to look forward to: A Super Bowl-like event. A box-office cricket hit. A dangal contest for the best cheering entourage between the Indian and Pakistani fans and a full house at Nassau County to witness the Men in Blue notch their second W of the season.
