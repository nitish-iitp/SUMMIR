Goodbye

Thanks for your company during another entertaining afternoon.

We now know one semi-final, and it's England's. They will take on India on Thursday at 15:30 BST.

The second semi will be decided tonight, as Afghanistan look to book their place with a win over Bangladesh. Australia will be watching that one closely - their hopes depend on an Afghanistan defeat.

For now, here's Stephan Shemilt's match report if you missed any of today's action, and you can join us for live coverage of that final group game early tomorrow morning.

Bye for now!

India may have been unbeaten going into this game, but this was actually their first real challenge.

Only Pakistan had them in any kind of trouble previously in the tournament so this was always going to be the game that told us just how good their form really is.

Turns out, pretty good.

It was a complete performance, Travis Head's knock aside. They look formidable, and will go into their semi-final v England full of confidence (and also probably fancy a bit of revenge for the last time!)

Australia captain Mitchell Marsh: "Yeah, it's so disappointing. We know we still have a chance to make the semis but today, India got the better of us.

"Over 40 overs there are a lot of small moments that you can think you could have done things better. But they got off to a flyer, Rohit Sharma is very hard to stop when he's in that mode. He deserves all the credit for that.

"We knew that if we kept up with 10 an over for as long as possible, we were in the game. But India have some class bowlers and they were too good for us today.

"Come on Bangladesh!"

Kuldeep Yadav's wicket of Glenn Maxwell changed the course of the game, completely halting Australia's momentum.

Kuldeep took 2-24, Arshdeep Singh took 3-37 with a wicket apiece for Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel in a fine all-round effort.

Australia had no answers to Rohit in particular, but they dished out some similar treatment to India's bowlers when their chase began.

Travis Head led a valiant effort with his 76 from 43 balls, but struggled for support other than entertaining cameos from Mitch Marsh and Glenn Maxwell.

India captain and player of the match Rohit Sharma: "That's what I have to do at the top of the order, see what the bowlers are trying to do and play accordingly.

"There was a strong breeze. They changed their plan, so I had to open up the other side of the field. We need to be smart, which I backed myself to do.

"Bowlers are smart, so you have to open up all side of the field. That was what was going through my mind.

"It was a good wicket and you want to back yourself to play those kind of shots. I'm glad it came off very well today."

Unsurprisingly, India skipper Rohit Sharma is named player of the match for his sparkling 92 from 41 balls.

We'll hear from him shortly.

Australia are not mathematically out of this but their fate is now out of their own hands.

If Afghanistan beat Bangladesh tomorrow (1:30 BST), Australia will be knocked out.

Aus 180-7

Ravindra Jadeja has just dropped a catch, people. I repeat, Jadeja has dropped a catch.

It probably doesn't matter much as it only costs a single, but Hardik Pandya would like a wicket to his name with figures of 0-46.

To be fair, Rohit Sharma did hit Mitchell Starc for 29 off an over earlier. (I appreciate the scenario is slightly different).

A weird, swivel-pull type thing from Pat Cummins brings him six.

Australia still need to try and get as many as they can because between them and Afghanistan, this could come down to net run-rate.

India close in on the semi-finals.

Full toss from Arshdeep, and Tim David tries to whack it into the stands. Instead, it flies off the outside edge to short third, where Jasprit Bumrah takes a smart grab. He can do no wrong.

Tim David clobbers one down the ground for six, such is his power that it was a complete miscue.

He's going to give this a good go, as unlikely as it is.
