Miller steers South Africa to victory despite scare from Netherlands in crucial Group D T20 World Cup fixture
Aiden Markram opted to put Netherlands in to bat in New York in the Group D game.
South Africa v Netherlands in New York

David Miller was South Africa's hero as they defeated Netherlands by four wickets with seven balls remaining, finishing on 106/6.

And Miller contributed over half of that tally, unbeaten on 59.

Baartman in sensational form

Scoreboard: South Africa v Netherlands

Toss: South Africa won the toss and elected to bowl first

Marco Jansen was in prime bowling form as Netherlands mustered 103/9 at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

He finished with figures of 2/20 off his four overs and also took two catches.

The top three were all gone within the first five overs with Jansen having a hand in each dismissal: Michael Levitt (caught by Quinton de Kock from Jansen's bowling), Max O'Dowd (caught by Jansen off Ottneil Baartman), and Vikramjit Singh, bowled by Jansen, whose earlier shout against him was overruled due to a front-foot no-ball.

Anrich Nortje got himself on the board in the tenth over, removing Bas de Leede with a catch from David Miller.

Scott Edwards' reverse-scoop six off Nortje was probably the pick of the shots, but he was avenged just one ball later with Aiden Markram successfully shying at the stumps at the non-striker's end.

And Nortje concluded that over by removing Teja Nidamanuru, who edged into the deep and found only the hands of Heinrich Klaasen.

Baartman started the last over of the innings by removing Sybrand Engelbrecht - once more with a catch from Jansen - and followed it two balls later by dismissing Tim Pringle, caught by Markram.

And he concluded the day with figures of 4/11, with Logan van Beek caught by Nortje.

Both teams named an unchanged side from their opening encounters in Group D, when South Africa beat Sri Lanka by six wickets, and Netherlands beat Nepal, also by six wickets.

Netherlands push it close

South Africa got their run chase of 104 off to the worst possible start, losing four wickets in the first five overs.

The tone was set when De Kock was run out in the very first ball.

Reeza Hendricks had watched his shot from the bowling of Vivian Kingma roll to Paul van Meekeren, while de Kock took off briskly - before realising his partner had not made the same strides down the pitch.

Henricks did not last much longer, though, bowled by Van Beek in the second over for just 3.

And captain Markram followed four balls later, with umpire review confirming that he edged a Kingma ball to the gloves of Edwards - leaving South Africa on 3/3, their worst ever start to a T20 international.

Klaasen made 4 before sending a shot flying into the hands of Pringle in the deep, once again from the bowling of Kingma.

After ten overs, South Africa had staggered to 32/4 as Tristan Stubbs and Miller attempted to steady the ship.

But Stubbs fell in the 17th over for 33, caught by Van Beek from a De Leede delivery, with 27 more runs still required from the final 22 balls.

Jansen was the next man in and wanted to finish with a flourish, but found himself bowled by an angled delivery from Van Beek as he looked to hit out.

It was left to Miller to get the job done, with two sixes and a four in the 19th over to take South Africa over the line.
