        "Player of the match Nicholas Kirton: 'I tried to get the pace of the wicket. It wasn't so bad, bar the middle of the wicket, a pretty good wicket to bat on to be honest. I tried to stay as still as possible. Focus on running hard, the partnership was very important, it got us over the line. It's very good to get our first win in the World Cup, hopefully we can continue from strength to strength. Our next focus is Pakistan, have a rest day tomorrow and get back in the nets. The two spin bowlers played very well, they used the pitch, using the bit in the middle of the wicket that was up and down and executed their plans.'",
        "Andrew Leonard: 'Ireland's lack of adaptability to different conditions, both with bat and ball, has cost them here. They have been out-skilled.'",
        "Andrew Leonard: 'Canada have outplayed Ireland in all three disciplines bat, ball and field.'"
