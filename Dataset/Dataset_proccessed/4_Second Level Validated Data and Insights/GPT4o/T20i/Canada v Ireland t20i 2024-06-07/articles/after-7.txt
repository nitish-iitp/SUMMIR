That's it from us. Make sure you read Tim Abraham's match report.

It's another historic day at the T20 World Cup. For once, it is Ireland on the end of the upset. Blame Canada.

'A pretty good wicket to bat on'
published at 19:08 British Summer Time 7 June 2024
19:08 BST 7 June 2024

Player of the match Nicholas Kirton: "I tried to get the pace of the wicket. It wasn't so bad, bar the middle of the wicket, a pretty good wicket to bat on to be honest.

"I tried to stay as still as possible. Focus on running hard, the partnership was very important, it got us over the line.

"It's very good to get our first win in the World Cup, hopefully we can continue from strength to strength. Our next focus is Pakistan, have a rest day tomorrow and get back in the nets.

"The two spin bowlers played very well, they they used the pitch, using the bit in the middle of the wicket that was up and down and executed their plans."

Looking back, Nicholas Kirton's contribution was massive. Remember how tricky it has been to bat in NYC? Canada were 10-15 over par.

It's been a cracking couple of days, hasn't it? This is Canada's first win at a T20 World Cup. No longer will John Davison's hundred be the most famous moment in their cricketing history.

Ireland's lack of adaptability to different conditions, both with bat and ball, has cost them here.

They have been out-skilled.

Ireland have lost two from two and look to be on the way out, especially after the US win over Pakistan. Canada might be wondering if they can turn over Pakistan too.

Ire 125-7

That's it! Canada have won!

It's the biggest win in their cricketing history. They have beaten a Test-playing nation at the T20 World Cup.

Ireland, so often the giant-killers, have been slayed.

First the US, now Canada.

What a tournament this is turning into.
