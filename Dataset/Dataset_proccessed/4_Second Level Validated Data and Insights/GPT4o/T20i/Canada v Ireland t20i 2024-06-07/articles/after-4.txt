Canada vs Ireland Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024: Canada shocked Ireland by 12 runs to record their first-ever win in T20 World Cup on Friday. Ireland could not chase down a 138-run target and managed just 125/7 in 20 overs. Earlier, the under-fire pitch at Nassau County played much better but Canada couldn't capitalise until Barbadian-born Nicholas Kirton threw caution to the wind and lifted his team to a fighting 137 for seven in their T20 World Cup match here on Friday. Kirton blazed away to a 35-ball 49 and wicketkeeper Shreyas Movva chipped in with 37 in 36 deliveries as the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium saw 100 being crossed for the first time in the tournament. (Scorecard | Points Table)

Right then, we have now seen three T20 World Cup debutants win a game and the last two wins have been truly remarkable. Such is this format that the minnows have a real chance of beating the big guns and it makes for such an entertaining and exciting watch. Next up, we have a couple of teams who will be playing their first games of the tournament. First up, it will be New Zealand getting their campaign underway against Afghanistan in Guyana. That clash will begin on Saturday, 8 June at 5 am IST (11.30 pm GMT). Also, Bangladesh will play their fist match against Sri Lanka in Dallas beginning at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). You can join us early for the build-up of both those games but until then, take care and goodbye.

Saad Bin Zafar, the captain of Canada says that it's a proud moment for his team. Credits Shreyas Movva and Nicholas Kirton for their great batting. Adds that the bowling unit stepped up and delivered. Shares that they gambled with an extra spinner and both him and Junaid Siddiqui did a good job. Ends by saying that they want to enjoy the win and go with confidence against Pakistan in their next game.

!

Ireland's skipper, Paul Stirling says that it is a tough loss and they were slow to begin with. Adds that it was certainly gettable and it was just a slow start with the bat that cost them and need to improve in all aspects of the game and hopefully put on a better performance in Miami. Mentions that they don't want to look too far ahead and want to focus on the next game which is a big one.

!

Nicolas Kirton is the Player of the Match for his attacking and momentum shifting knock 49 runs. He says that it was important to get over the line after the first game. Adds that it was crucial for him to get in the middle and the wicket was pretty good to bat on except for an area in the middle. Shares that the partnership with Shreyas Movva was very important. He hopes to grow from strength to strength and to do well in the next game. Mentions that the spinners got some purchase off the pitch and they executed the plans well. Ends by sharing that they want to take one day at a time and not think too much further.

Presentation time...

Having opted to bowl first, Paul Stirling and his men seemed to be in control as they suffocated the Canadian batters in the first 10 overs but didn't biowl particularly well. This eventually cost them as it allowed Canada to post a defendable total. Still, 138 to win and one would back Ireland to chase it down but their openers once again failed to give them a positive start. Andy Balbirnie looked decent but Stirling was just not in the game at all and soon enough, the top order crumbled. They were down 59 for 6 at one point before George Dockrell and Mark Adair led the fightback. It was always a bridge too far and in the end, they ended up a few runs short and have now gone on to lose back-to-back games.

Defending 137 runs on a pitch that wasn't the easiest to bat on, Canada started brightly with the ball as they managed to stop Paul Stirling from getting away and eventually, that brought them his wicket as well. tThey were miserly in the Powerplay and then their spinners ruled the roost in the middle overs. Skipper, Saad Bin Zafar and especially Junaid Siddiqui bowled really well and picked up a wicket each to pile on the pressure. Dilon Heyliger too bowled a lovely spell in the middle overs and picked up two wickets and the pacers closed things out pretty nicely when things got a bit tight towards the end. They will now look to build on this and go into their next match against Pakistan full of confidence.

HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE ONCE AGAIN IN THE 2024 MEN'S T20 WORLD CUP! On back-to-back days, two associate nations have defeated two Test-playing nations, both in Group A and Canada have picked up their maiden win at the Men's T20 World Cup. This is also the second-time they have beaten a Test-playing nation in a T20I game, both of those wins coming against Ireland who will be gutted and have been handed two successive losses here.

OUT! CAUGHT AND BOWLED! Jeremy Gordon keeps up his excellent work and picks up a vital wicket in the final over. Gordon bangs it into the putch again and bowls it a bit straighter this time.

FOUR! Streaky but will do nicely for Ireland. Another high full toss from Kaleem Sana, this time outside off, Mark Adair goes hard after it but gets a thick outside fine of short third and rolls away into the fence. That was almost a no ball for height as well but for now, it is just the four runs.
