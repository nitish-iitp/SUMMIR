SL vs IND T20Is: Captain SKY and Guru Gautam era begins
By Mumbai Indians | 26 JUL, 2024

SKY is the limit as Suryakumar Yadav starts a new chapter in his cricketing career as captain of the Indian team in T20Is. We simply cannot stay calm! The Men in Blue are already in Sri Lanka for a three-match T20I series starting Saturday (July 27) followed by three ODIs. Okay, let’s focus on what’s first.

An era in Indian cricket came to an end with the trio of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja bidding adieu to T20Is. SKY will helm a new-look Indian side eager to fill the shoes of their senior pros, with Gautham Gambhir taking over as Head Coach of the World Champions in T20s.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will look to make amends for their dismal show in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, with Charith Asalanka leading the side’s revival. Making a statement against the World Champions will go a long way to boost their fortunes. However, it is easier said than done, as the Islanders have a tough task to bring down the high-flying Indians.

Over the years, we at MI, have had several iconic Lankans don the Blue and Gold. Nuwan Thushara, our young Malinga, unfortunately, has sustained a finger injury and is out of the series. What that does though, is bring in fellow MI-kar, Dilshan Madushanka into the mix. Hardik Pandya, after bowling that epic final over and sending us through an entire of emotions from that iconic afternoon in Barbados, is back against an opposition he loves!

What: Sri Lanka vs India T20I series

When: Saturday, July 27 to Tuesday, July 30, 2024

Where: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Pallekele

What to expect: An Indian team with a new captain and a new coach looking to chart their roadmap for the T20 World Cup 2026 to be held on home soil. An exciting new journey ahead for Suryakumar Yadav and the team in the shortest format as they seek to continue the winning habit against the Lankans in the three-match series.
