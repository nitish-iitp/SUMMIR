Analysis

The Indian team has quickly adapted to their new captain and coach and registered two back-to-back wins. The batting has looked good throughout the series, especially with the top order in incredible form. On the bowling front, the pacers struggled slightly but consistently picked up wickets. Whereas, the spinners have done a great job and been among the wickets.

Talking about Sri Lanka, the hosts have showcased some positive intent and even managed to produce some incredible moments but failed to register a win. The Lankan batting remains an issue, especially with their middle-order which has failed to score quick runs. Talking about their bowling, the Lankans have done a decent job with Matheesha Pathirana emerging as the pick of the attack with consistent performances.
