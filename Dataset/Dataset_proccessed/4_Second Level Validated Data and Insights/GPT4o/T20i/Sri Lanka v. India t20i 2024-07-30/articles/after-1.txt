30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 20 overs SL 137/8

Well, Surya bowled the final over and it was a cracking one. He picked up up a couple of wickets defending six runs however, Sri Lanka managed to level the score we have super over coming up for you with Sri Lanka batting first shortly. 

23:26 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 19 overs SL 132/6

Well, Rinku comes in and picks up two wickets. First, it was Kushal Perera and then it was Ramesh Mendis who inspired bowling change this was from Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav. There is palpable tension all around the ground here. 

23:21 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 18.2 overs SL 129/5

It was a poor over from Khaleel he did not get his radar right in the over. He kept trying slower delivery balls which were wides it was a 12-run over which is all that Sri Lanka needed at this stage. We have a surprise here Rinku Singh has come to bowl the 19th over.

23:12 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 17.1 overs SL 118/4

Well, there comes the mandatory two-wicket over for Sri Lanka off the day it is Sundar who does it this time first it was Hasaranga who plays an ugly swipe and gets the top edge and Bishnoi takes the catch and Asalanka gets a peach which takes outside edge of his bat and keeper takes a lovely catch.

23:04 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 16.1 overs SL 116/2

Ravi Bishnoi gets the breakthrough it is the wicket of Kushal Mendis he gets. Change of ends for him worked in the final over. However, India will be wondering has it come to a touch too late for them we have to wait and see. Hasaranga has walked into the middle for Sri Lanka.

22:56 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 15 overs SL 108/1

While Mendis has played well here it is Kushal Perera who has taken the game away from India. He has found a way or shot to get the boundary away every over which has piled the pressure on Indian spinners. This is Sri Lanka's game to lose from here on.

22:52 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 14.1 overs SL 100/1

This is slipping away from India. While the spinners are bowling decently they are not able to string good balls for an entire over. They have been looking for that magic ball every over which has proven expensive for them in the over and let the pressure away.

22:47 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 13.1 overs SL 89/1

They are chipping away are the Sri Lankans here. They got through another over which yielded six runs without losing a wicket. The longer this partnership goes gets more difficult for India. It also might not be a bad ploy for Surya to use Dube who might trouble the batters with his slower pace.

22:43 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 12.1 overs SL 86/1

India needs to pick a wicket here. Sri Lanka is building another partnership here. And Kushal Perera is looking to counterattack. Sundar has been brought into the attack. The ball is now older and softer which might cause trouble to batter. 

22:39 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 11.1 overs SL 76/1

Though Bishnoi has picked up a wicket he is having an off-day. It is not even about the pace at which he is bowling the leg-spinner is just not getting his line and lengths right at the moment. Also, Surya has three overs of Sundar left will be interesting to see when he will use them.

22:36 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 10.3 overs SL 65/1

Good follow-up from Riyan Parag. Sri Lanka needs one of Perera or Mendis to bat through for 20 overs if they need to get over the line. Also, they need to start to pick and choose their bowlers from here on. Surya still has to get through four overs of seam which may be suspectibale for going runs.

22:31 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 9.1 overs SL 59/1

There is the wicket for India and it is Bisnoi who gets the breakthrough. He pitches one up which Nissanka goes down the track to smack him however, gets the bottom edge, and the Riyan Parag at long-on takes a lovely catch. In comes Kushal Perera from Sri Lanka.

22:24 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 8 overs SL 51/0

Parag has been introduced into attack and he is the slowest of the three spinners have India today as expected he has got the most turn of anyone in the side. From here on began the challenges for Sri Lanka in this run-chase. 

22:21 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 7 overs SL 45/0

Bishnoi comes into the attack and he did bowl an expensive over under the circumstances. One was a good shot from Kushal Mendis and the other one was poor fielding from Jaiswal. In addition to that Samson dropped another catch in the game. Things going badly for Samson.

22:17 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 6 overs SL 35/0

Sanju Samson dropped a sitter here. It was a regulation catch to him as Siraj bowled a peach of a delivery which went in and out. It was a masterful over from Siraj without a wicket to his name. Though India has not picked a wicket they did bowl well.

22:11 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 5 overs SL 31/0

Good over from Sundar. He was putting that effort into getting more revs on the ball so that it would turn. Also, his control has been impeccable in that opening over. Sundar might be the challenging bowler for Sri Lanka in today's game as the ball gets older.

22:07 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 4.2 overs SL 25/0

Another good over from Siraj it might be time Surya brings on the spinners here. Given the way this opening partnership for Sri Lanka has fared so far it might be right time to introduce Ravi Bishnoi who is the primary spinner in this attack. However, Surya though otherwise and we have Sundar bowling.

22:02 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 3.1 overs SL 19/0

Much needed big over for Sri Lanka it was Khaleel whom Nissanka targeted. The pacer did look rusty in that opening over and yet again he bowled freebies but the batter got his eye in and has been ruthless. The onus is now on Siraj on how will pull back things. 

21:57 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 2.1 overs SL 5/0

That was a very good second over from Siraj once again he found the right length for the surface right from the ball. Surya too gave the bowler an attacking field with a gully and slip in place. Sri Lanka needs to make the most of this Powerplay if the ball gets softer it might be difficult to hit it. 

21:52 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 1 overs SL 2/0

Khaleel has taken the new ball for India and he did start decently. There were a couple of hit-me balls in that over which Nissanka could not make the most of. More importantly, there has been not much of a swing on offer which Wikramasinghe got in the first over for Sri Lanka.

21:36 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 20 overs IND 137/9

137 might not be as bad as it looks given how the wicket has played out. Especially partnership between Bishnoi and Sundar seems like a letaway from Sri Lanka. Will it cost them later we have to wait and see. As of now credit where credit is due, exceptional performance from Sri Lanka. We will be right back with the chase.

21:30 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 19.1 overs IND 129/7

The ball is turning square here and it might be difficult for Sri Lanka to chase these runs if they don't plan it well. Also from the Indian perspective, they need the likes of Ravi Bishnoi to bowl it slower through the air instead of firing it in like he does on a flat wicket.

21:27 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 18.2 overs IND 125/7

Theekshana has bowled fabulously well today. Right from ball one he looked at money, especially with the lack of Pathirana Asalanka using his spinners in the final overs which is also indicative that the wicket is getting difficult to bat once the ball is getting older and softer.

21:23 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 17.1 overs IND 117/7

India has got to around 130-mark here however, the need to bowl exceptionally well to make a match out of it. As Pathum Nissanka and Kushal Perera have been in good form and good innings from either of them might be good enough for Sri Lanka to get over the line.

21:20 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 16.4 overs IND 111/7

Hasaranga bowled a half-tracker which went high in the air and the deep-mid wicket took the catch. This is an excellent effort from Sri Lanka and they have got themselves into a winning position yet again as they have done many times before in the series.

21:16 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 15.4 overs IND 105/7

Shubman Gill departs, and Hasaranga gets the breakthrough. The right-hander went down the track however, the ball turned more than he anticipated and he ended up in no mans land and wicketkeeper Kushal Perera finished the job.

21:09 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 14 overs IND 96/5

Riyan Parag smacked a couple of sixes against Hasaranga. That was a poor over from the leg-spinner he bowled a couple of full tosses in it and paid the price this is where Sri Lanka needs to be careful not to let India get away as they are one bowler short.

21:06 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 13.2 overs IND 87/5

Kamindu Mendis has come into the attack. The bowling changes have been indicative of Sri Lankan skipper Asalanka being worried about the overs of Pathirana. As of now we still don't have an update on Pathirana's situation. 

21:03 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 12.2 overs IND 79/5

The partnership between Parag and Gill is shaping up nicely here. They have converted ones into twos and have not taken played high-risk shots this is what India needed at this phase of the play. With eight overs remaining, India will be looking to get around 130.

20:58 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 11 overs IND 68/5

A boundary from Parag breaks the shackles for India. Mendis tossed the ball up and the batter whacked him through long on region for a boundary. India will be hoping that might be the boundary that will inject some momentum into the innings. 

20:55 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 10.2 overs IND 60/5

Amidst the chaos from one end, Shubman Gill is still in the middle and is looking in decent touch. The responsibility lies on him to bat deep and explode in the final overs. His innings might be the factor in how much India might get today. 

20:51 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 9 overs IND 53/5

Ramesh Mendis comes into the attack and picks up Shivam Dube. Another wicket down for India. The left-hander tried to cut the ball and got the outside edge. India has now lost half their side and is in a lot of trouble. Riyan Parag has walked in for India.

20:46 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 8.3 overs IND 48/4

Shivam Dube and Shubman Gill need to rebuild the innings for a bit now. There are still 12 overs left but India has lost four wickets. However, with Pathirana walking off the field India needs to play it safe and take the game deep and capitalise in those overs.  

20:39 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 7.1 overs IND 36/4

Wickremesinghe has bowled out here. Four overs in a trot from the debutant and he did repay his captain's trust. As we update we have big news here Matheesha Pathirana is walking out of the field. He was trying to stop a bowl and seems like he injured his shoulder.

20:34 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 6.1 overs IND 31/4

Ashita Fernando comes into attack for Sri Lanka and picks the wicket of Suryakumar Yadav. Excellent captaincy from the Sri Lankan skipper the Indian skipper swept the ball however, the fine leg was placed exactly for that shot and took the catch. India is in deep trouble now. 

20:27 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 5.1 overs IND 28/3

This is good captaincy from Asalanka he realized the debutant was having a good day and he decided to give him another over in the Powerplay and the bowler did manage to deliver another economical over. India needs to build a partnership here to post a defendable total.

20:22 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 4.2 overs IND 21/3

India is on the back foot here early in the game. Sri Lanka has managed to scalp three wickets within the first four overs and India needs to rebuild here. There have been no demons in the pitch it was just poor shot selections from the batters who have come in. 

20:18 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 3.1 overs IND 14/3

Wickramasinghe gets his man. Samson tried to hit the ball through the long-on region to get the outside edge straight to the point fielder inside the ring. This is poor from Samson he has wasted two opportunities here both times going for duck. As we update Theekshana picks Rinku Singh.

20:11 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 2.2 overs IND 12/1

Jaiswal tried to slog-sweep Theekshana and missed the ball completely and was trapped in front of the wicket. The Indian batter did challenge the decision however, it was three reds. This is a much better start for Sri Lanka today compared to both games. 

20:06 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: After 1.1 overs IND 3/0

Sri Lankan bowler Wickramasinghe took the new ball. The debutant did stick to his lines in the opening over and was also able to manage some swing. It's a better start for Sri Lanka today than how things went in the first two games. 

19:59 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Let's go!

The atmosphere is buzzing yet again in the ground. The rain has stopped and Russell Arnold reckons there won't be many rain interruptions in the remainder of the game. And if there is any rain from here we will start losing overs. Both teams are in the middle sit back relax and enjoy some competitive cricket.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Suryakumar Yadav at toss

Would've liked to chase as well with the weather around. Becomes difficult for the bowling team to control the ball later. We have 4 guys resting - Hardik, Axar, Rishabh and Arshdeep. We spoke about the brand of cricket we want to play and it's about topping it up every game and being the best version of ourselves.

19:45 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Charith Asalanka at toss

We are going to bowl first. Looks like a dry pitch. There was a batting collapse, when the ball gets older its a bit harder to bat. We have planned a little bit differently. One change, Wickramasinghe comes in for Shanaka.

19:30 (IST)
30 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Arshdeep Singh ahead of game

(On his journey in international cricket) I am very grateful, you always dream to play for your country and I have received a lot of support. I like the pressure, I like tough situations and I want to perform in those situations. I try new variations - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, I focus on the process and not results. I have been lucky enough to play with great bowlers like Bhuvi, Bumarh and now Siraj as well. The vibe (in the team) is really nice, the environment is very light, we are having fun, we are having each others' back.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Pitch report by Russell Arnold

Strong wind blowing across should blow away the concerning clouds but there could be intermittent showers. We're on a new pitch, right next to the one used in the last two games. This is drier, the cracks are evident so it is going to turn. Slower balls are going to be effective. There's dew, the ball will come back wet and slide. You are certainly wanting to chase. Pitch should hold up 160-170 is the total you're looking for. The slower you bowl, the harder it will be for strokeplay. Dew is going to make it very hard to grip the ball.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Axar Patel interview: ‘After the toss against Pakistan, Rahul Dravid told me that I might be batting at 4’

It took Axar Patel a decade to make a name for himself in Indian cricket. The all-rounder has been so much of an understudy to Ravindra Jadeja that ten years since his international debut, he has played all of 14 Tests, 57 ODIs and 60 T20Is. It is only in the last couple of years or so that his batting has begun to garner some attention across all formats. More evidence of that potential came in the recently-concluded T20I World Cup, where he was used as a floater and he always managed to turn up for his team.

In an exclusive interview with The Indian Express, Axar, who is backed by JSW Sports, opens up about his moniker ‘Nadiad ka Jayasuriya,’ his different batting positions, his bowling speeds in different formats, the comparison between his one-handed stunner against Australia and Suryakumar Yadav’s World Cup winning take in the final and of course how he felt after the Klaasen onslaught.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Leadership brought the best out of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and it will do the same for Shubman Gill: Vikram Rathour

It’s Shubman Gill’s body language that assured the former India batting coach Vikram Rathour that he would make a good leader and that the BCCI has made the right decision in appointing him as the vice-captain of India’s T20 and ODI teams.

“Whatever I have seen him, be it for the Gujarat Titans or in Zimbabwe (when Gill led in a T20 series), he did a good job. He has shown terrific body language, which is a must if you are leading a side. Now with the vice-captaincy, the BCCI has given him extra responsibility and I am sure he will thrive in this role, ” Rathour tells The Indian Express. (Read more from Pratyush Raj)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Same old collapse story for Lanka, India wrap series

Three balls into India’s chase of 162 – which was definitely below par on the flat deck at Pallekele – Sri Lanka had a rain break to thank. The nearly hour-long break after a 40-minute delayed start meant, instead of going at 8 runs an over in their chase, the revised DLS target (78 off 8 overs) meant India needed to go at 10 runs an over. When Sanju Samson was dismissed for a first-ball zero soon after the break ended, it seemed as if the capacity crowd had a game on hand. (Read more from Venkata Krishna B)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Sri Lanka’s all-round show wins them women’s Asia Cup as Harmanpreet & Co stumble in the final

Breezy half-centuries from captain Chamari Athapaththu and Harshitha Samarawickrama, besides Kavisha Dilhari’s all-round exploits, enabled Sri Lanka defeat defending champions India by eight wickets and claim the Asia Cup in Dambulla on Sunday. Though India were favourites, the outcome does not come as a complete surprise as Lanka had been on a red-hot winning streak, having lost only three of their last 17 games.

From the moment India decided to bat after winning the toss, Sri Lanka were purposeful and perseverant. Despite the brisk opening-wicket stand of 44 runs from 6.1 overs between Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma, they didn’t panic. Dilhari, hailing from the same neighbourhood as Lasith Malinga in the coastal town of Rathgama near Galle, made the ball straighten just enough to ping an on-the-charge Verma on the pads in front of the off-stump. Dilhari is a utility spinner, capable of bowling accurate leg-breaks to right-handed batters and off-spinners to left-handers. Not a big turner of the ball, she deceives batters with clever change of length and pace variation. (Read more)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Pitch report

Pallekele pitch was flat in the first match and we can expect another batter paradise in the next two games. Although dew didn’t play a role on Saturday but batting second will be a safer option.

Pathum Nissanka smacked 79 off 48, hitting seven fours and four sixes in first T20I, but he had little support and Sri Lanka. The hosts will again be banking on the southpaw to give Sri Lanka a flying start in the powerplay.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: India player to watch out for

Suryakumar had the toughest batting assignment of the day of an Indian as not only the openers Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had smashed 74 runs in just 6 overs, had fallen off successive deliveries. Captain Suryakumar Yadav will again be in the focus on Sunday.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Charith Asalanka after loss in 2nd T20I

I am really disappointed with the way we batted at the death and about our middle order and lower middle order including me. We must really improve in our batting. On this pitch, when the ball gets older, it gets really hard to bat. As professional cricketers, we have to do well. We were behind by 15-18 runs. Unfortunately weather also played something, we can't control that. It's easy when it comes to an 8-over game with a wet outfield.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Suryakumar Yadav after win in 2nd T20I

We spoke about this before this tournament - what brand of cricket we want to play. Even if it's a shorter target or whatever target we are chasing, this is the template which we would like to go ahead with. With the weather around, anything below 160 would have been nice. The games which we have seen here before have always been tricky. Rain helped us. The way the boys batted, it was wonderful. We'll sit and decide what we want to do going forward (when asked if they'll test their bench strength). Very happy for the boys the way they showed their skill and talent and lot of character in tough situations.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20: Mini preview

With the series in the bag, India will take on Sri Lanka in the third T20I of the series at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele on Tuesday.

Suryakumar Yadav’s side racked up two wins on successive days even as the hosts performed in patches to offer a scare. However, the T20 World Cup winners maintained their command over the proceedings to secure the series. While a series whitewash seems likely on the cards, India may also have a look at their bench for some game time.
