IND vs SL 3rd T20I Dream11 Prediction: Having won the previous two T20I fixtures comprehensively, Suryakumar Yadav-led Indian team have already won the series. The Men in Blue will face Sri Lanka in the third T20I on 30 July, Tuesday at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, looking to inflict a clean sweep.
Under new coach Gautam Gambhir, India began the T20I series against Sri Lanka with a 43-run victory. Captain Suryakumar won the Player of the Match award for his half-century that helped India score 213/7 while Rishabh Pant slammed 49 off 33. In reply, Sri Lanka folded for 170 despite a 79-run valiant knock from Pathum Nissanka.
Riyan Parag picked up three wickets and was the pick of the bowlers in the series opener. The second T20I was disrupted by rain as Sri Lanka scored 161/9 in their 20 overs. Kusal Perera was the top scorer for his team as he scored 53 runs. Ravi Bishnoi meanwhile contributed three wickets and was adjudged as the Man of the Match.
Due to the rain, India were given a revised DLS total of 78 runs, although they won the match with 7 wickets in hand, thanks to SKY, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Hardik Pandya's unbeaten 22-run effort.
With the third T20I being the last game of the series, Indian players will look to inflict a clean sweep and continue their winning momentum before the attention switches to the ODI leg.
