Hosts West Indies (WI) will be opening their T20 World Cup 2024 campaign with a showdown against associate nation, Papua New Guinea (PNG), on June 2, 2024, at the Providence Stadium, Guyana, at 8 pm IST.

The average first innings score at the venue in T20I encounters, starting from the onset of 2022, is recorded at 168, while teams tend to demonstrate a bent for batting second. Spinners have exhibited supremacy here, maintaining an economy rate of just 6.94 in the 24 T20Is played in the aforementioned timeframe. 

Following a challenging run in the prestigious tournament during the 2021 edition, wherein they were eliminated from the Super 12 stage after securing only one victory in five matches and failing to progress past the Qualifiers in the 2022 edition, WI are poised to seek redemption. They'd be aspiring to go the distance with a formidable lineup this time around, leveraging their star-studded squad and exploiting the advantage of playing on home turf.

As for PNG, their objective would be to leave a lasting impression and disrupt certain presumptions. They possess the requisite experience, with ten of their members having participated in the 2021 edition. Furthermore, only four of their players are below the age of 25.
