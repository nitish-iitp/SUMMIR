At the top Brandon King scored 29-ball 34 while Nicholas Pooran made 27-ball 27. Skipper Assad Vala took two wickets for the PNG by giving away 28 runs.

Earlier, West Indies didn't allow PNG to settle early as they kept taking wickets at regular intervals and restricted them on 136-8 after opting to bowl first.

The only notable partnership PNG had was of Sese Bau and Charles Amini for the fifth wicket where they scored 44 runs which gave them some momentum.

Bau was the notable batter, scoring a brilliant 43-ball 50 with the help of a six and half a dozen fours.

Skipper Assad Vala made 22-ball 21 with the help of two fours and a six.

Kiplin Doriga (27*) chipped in with some vital runs at the backend to take the total to 136/8.
