As per the official ICC T20 Rankings, Australia are fourth and will be high on confidence after thrashing the tourists 3-0 in the recently concluded ODI series.

Aussies will be led by the versatile all-rounder Mitchell Marsh in the T20 series and perhaps the selectors will be eagle-eyed on his captaincy keeping in mind the T20 World Cup 2024 on the horizon. Glenn Maxwell is in the squad and fit to face the West Indies.

As for the West Indies, Rovman Powell-led side will look to bounce after a disappointing ODI series. Former skipper Jason Holder and hard-hitter Kyle Mayers are in the 15-man squad. The men from the Caribbean are seventh in the ICC men's T20I rankings.
