Australian opening batter David Warner on Friday announced that he intends to retire from international cricket after the T20 World Cup 2024. Big-hitting Warner made the announcement at the end of his 100th T20 International against West Indies at Hobart's Blundstone Arena.

"It's great, I feel refreshed, guys have told me settle down, I want to play the T20 World Cup and finish there, I'm excited and it's a good little journey that we've got going for the next 6 months," the 37-year-old David Warner was quoted as saying by Sportskeeda after the game. He opened up after receiving the Player of the Match award for a rollicking 36-ball 70 in the first innings that ensured Austalia's victory in the high-scoring contest.

Ahead of his swansong Test at his hometown venue SCG in January, Warner revealed that Australia's ICC World Cup final victory over India in November was his last match in the 50-over format. However, he kept the door open for himself to be available for the 2025 Champions Trophy if the Australian team needs him.

Considered one of Australia's and the world's most destructive batters, Warner ended his one-day career as a two-time world champion after finishing the 2023 World Cup in India as his team's leading run-scorer.

The left-handed opener made his ODI debut in 2009 in a match against South Africa in Hobart. Since then, he has played 161 ODIs, scoring 6932 runs at an average of 45.30 with the help of 22 hundreds and 33 fifties.

He is Australia's sixth-highest run-scorer in men's ODIs and second on the hundreds list behind Ricky Ponting who played 205 more ODI innings than Warner.

In the 111 Tests he has played so far, Warner has scored 8695 runs at an average of 44.58 with 26 hundreds and 36 fifties.

The former Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals star has amassed 2964 runs in his 100 T20I outings at a strike rate of 142.22. The T20 World Cup 2024 is set to take place in June in the Caribbean and USA.
