AUS vs WI: Pitch Report

Historically, the Bellerive track has provided early movement for bowlers. However, as the match progresses, the field tends to become a batting paradise, largely due to the afternoon sea winds originating from the Derwent River. Hence, it will be a brilliant battle between bat and ball. One can expect a high scoring encounter.
