Pakistan

Whereas everything worked in the favor of Pakistan ahead of the semis, players will got to bring their best diversion against New Zealand. Babar Azam and Md. Rizwan will got to recover themselves on Wednesday and on the off chance that they are able to do, Pakistan might do wonders. Md. Harris, Shan Masood, Shadab Khan, and Iftikhar Ahmed have contributed heavily within the middle order, and they will have to keep hitting the right chords in the knockout arrange. Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Hari Rauf will hold the key to limiting the New Zealand batters.

New Zealand

The campaign started with Devon Conway smashing a brilliant 94 off just 58 balls in front of Australia, Glenn Phillips scoring up an unimaginable ton vs Sri Lanka, and ended with Kane Williamson scoring a brilliant 61 off just 35 against Ireland amid feedback of a poor strike rate.

The pair of experienced pacers, Tim Southee and Trent Boult will have to bring their A-game in front of rejuvenated Pakistan’s batting. Lockie Ferguson, Mitchell Santner, and Ish Sodhi will be equally important for the side. New Zealand must not take Pakistan lightly as the latter had recently defeated Kane Williamson & boys to clinch the tri-series in New Zealand.
