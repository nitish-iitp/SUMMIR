So Pakistan are in the final, which takes place in Melbourne on Sunday (7pm local time, 8am in the UK). If they end up lifting the trophy, they may have to dedicate it to the cricketers of the Netherlands, without whose shock victory over South Africa Pakistan would not have reached this semi-final. But all you can do is take your chances and Babar, Rizwan and the gang took theirs superbly tonight.

Tomorrow England and India meet in Adelaide to see which of them will join Pakistan in the final. Do join Rob Smyth for that game, which starts at 6.30pm local time, 8am in the UK. That’s it from me – thanks for your company.

Babar Azam pays tribute to the crowd. “We are feeling like we’re playing at home!” he says. “Everyone is coming and cheering for Pakistan team.” He gives the rest of the credit to his bowlers: “We had a good start with the ball, we have good spinners with Shadab and Nawaz bowling very well, and the fast bowlers finished very well.” Modesty forbids him to dwell on his own return to form, which came at just the right time.

Kane Williamson, as ever, is generous in defeat. “We were outplayed,” he says. “Pakistan bowled really nicely, we managed to wrestle back a little bit of momentum, at half-way we felt that was a competitive total. Very disappointing to not make Pakistan work a lot harder… They certainly deserve their win.”

Pakistan produced a superb all-round performance. The bowlers allowed New Zealand only 12 boundaries (ten fours, two sixes), with Shaheen Shah Afridi again proving to be the leader of the pack with 2-24. The other bowlers took only one wicket between them but they all kept it tight, with nobody going for more than 8.25 an over. The fielding was sharper than usual. And then Babar and Rizwan, the captain and his mate, suddenly remembered that they are the best international opening pair in the world. They put on 105 and turned a run chase into a cruise. Mohammad Haris, Pakistan’s latest wonder-kid, applied the finishing touches with a nerveless 30.

So New Zealand, the team of the first fortnight of the tournament, are heading home. When Pakistan’s openers found their form, the Kiwis had no plan B. Trent Boult was good, taking 2-33, but the other four bowlers managed only 1-113. The fielding was faulty for once and the captain, Kane Williamson, was too set in his ways, risking neither a sixth bowler nor a Test-match field. It’s especially cruel for Daryl Mitchell, whose record in T20 World Cup semi-finals is unbelievable: 72 not out against England last year, 53 not out today. And that sixth bowler might well have been him.

Pakistan reach the final!

20th over, first ball: Pakistan 153-3 (Shan Masood 3, Iftikhar Ahmed 0) Southee to bowl the final over. He starts with a wide! Oh dear. The next ball is at least on target, but Masood has no trouble pushing it for a single. Pakistan have won by seven wickets, with five balls to spare, to reach their first T20 final since 2009. The crowd are roaring, and so are the cornered tigers.

Wicket! Haris c Allen b Santner 30 (Pakistan 151-3)

19th over: Pakistan 151-3 (Shan Masood 2) One last over of spin. Santner, bowling to the left-handed Masood, finds some sharp turn – but it misses everything and dribbles away for three byes! Cruel stuff. With two needed, Haris goes for glory and top-edges to short fine leg, but he has done his job. Pakistan need two off six balls.

18th over: Pakistan 145-2 (Mohammad Haris 28, Shan Masood 1) It’s Lockie Ferguson, and he starts well, but then Mohammad Haris simply takes over. He’s 21, playing in his fourth T20 international, and he’s got sang-froid to die for. Staying deep in the crease, he hammers an off-drive for four. Then he chooses the perfect moment to hit the first six of the innings, hooking hard, high and handsome. Pakistan need only eight now off 12 balls: not even they can blow it from here.

Wicket! Rizwan c Phillips b Boult 57 (Pakistan 132-2)

17th over: Pakistan 132-2 (Mohammad Haris 17) A fine, fighting over from Trent Boult brings a wicket, after some confusion. Rizwan slapped a high full-toss to Phillips, who caught it easily, realised it might be a no-ball, threw to the non-striker’s end and got a run-out just to be sure. But it wasn’t reckoned to be above waist height, rightly, because Rizwan had gone down the track. End of an excellent innings, but now New Zealand have a faint sniff. Pakistan need 21 off the last 18 balls.

16th over: Pakistan 127-1 (Rizwan 55, Mohammad Haris 15) And now Santner drops a catch! Williamson belatedly posted a catcher, at gully, for Southee. Haris went for the cut and Santner couldn’t hold on. It was a tough chance, and it was probably New Zealand’s last chance. Pakistan need 26 off 24.

15th over: Pakistan 122-1 (Rizwan 54, Mohammad Haris 11) Santner and Sodhi have been so incisive in this World Cup, but the force is not with them tonight. Every ball in this over goes for something, Rizwan plays a sweep for three and the spin twins have 0-49 between them off seven overs. Pakistan need only 31 off the last 30 balls.

Fifty to Rizwan!

14th over: Pakistan 113-1 (Rizwan 50, Mohammad Haris 6) Bodhi bowls his final over and Rizwan helps himself to a single to reach a well-judged fifty off 36 balls. He tucked into Tim Southee early on, then let Babar take over at the buffet. The scoreboard flashes up the attendance: 36,443 (more than you ever get at a game in England, where the grounds are smaller). And about 25,000 of them are having a ball because they’re wearing green, like the pavilion roof.

13th over: Pakistan 109-1 (Rizwan 48, Mohammad Haris 4) Interesting decision here, probably made by Matthew Hayden in Babar’s absence: the new batter is Mohammad Haris, a fast starter, rather than an accumulator like Shan Masood. Haydos is a middle-aged man in a hurry. Haris duly whacks his second ball for four, marring a fine over from Trent Boult, who was brought back to take a wicket and did so.

Wicket! Babar c Mitchell b Boult 53 (Pakistan 105-1)

At last! Babar succumbs to the adrenaline and plays a big hit when he didn’t need to, making it easy for Mitchell at long-on. But he has done a fine job here, and it will be enough unless Pakistan produce one of the all-time great chokes.

Hundred partnership!

12th over: Pakistan 102-0 (Rizwan 46, Babar 52) Pakistan can just about get ’em in singles now and one from Rizwan, pushed down the ground off Sodhi, brings up the hundred partnership. These two have been immense. Cometh the hour, cometh the pair of them.

Fifty to Babar!

11th over: Pakistan 97-0 (Rizwan 43, Babar 50) Back comes Lockie Ferguson as Williamson acknowledges that spin hasn’t worked for once. But he doesn’t post the slip cordon that is surely his only way out of this now. Babar pulls for four, then adds a flick for two to reach fifty from only 36 balls, beating Rizwan to it. Before this game Babar had only 39 in the whole tournament, off 63 balls. And he was dropped first ball tonight.

10th over: Pakistan 87-0 (Rizwan 41, Babar 43) Just when they can’t afford one more bad over, the Kiwis have one. Sodhi floats one ball up outside leg, so Rizwan plays a paddle for four. He drops another short outside off, so Babar threads a cut through the covers. That is Pakistan’s 11th four, one more than New Zealand managed in twice as many overs. At the halfway stage, this has become an awful mismatch. Pakistan need only 66.

9th over: Pakistan 75-0 (Rizwan 37, Babar 35) A decent over from Santner too, seven off it. But being decent won’t do for NZ. Pakistan need just 78 now and they have 11 overs – and ten wickets – to play with. Game off!

11.32 CET

8th over: Pakistan 68-0 (Rizwan 32, Babar 33) Ish Sodhi joins his spin twin and bowls the best over for some time, going for just five. But Babar already has his highest score of the tournament, and he can afford to cruise because Rizwan (who has faced six balls fewer) is leading the charge. Kane Williamson is going to have to turn into Steve Waugh and set Test-match fields. Three men round the bat!

7th over: Pakistan 63-0 (Rizwan 30, Babar 30) Only one thing can save New Zealand now: spin. And it very nearly makes the breakthrough as Mitchell Santner appeals for LBW against Babar, Williamson reviews … and it would be plumb if it wasn’t going over the stumps. In Australia, even a low-and-slow wicket can have a trampoline hidden inside it.

Pakistan rule the powerplay

6th over: Pakistan 55-0 (Rizwan 28, Babar 25) Even the false shots are going for four now: Babar top-edges Ferguson, way over the keeper, and off it goes, trickling to the Toblerone. New Zealand hit only ten fours in their whole innings, and Pakistan have nine already. The powerplay ends with the best T20 opening pair (before this tournament) right back in business.

11.19 CET

5th over: Pakistan 47-0 (Rizwan 27, Babar 19) Southee changes ends and Rizwan decides to target him. He moves over to off stump and plays a crunching on-drive for four, like Viv Richards on speed. He likes it so much, he does it again next ball. Babar joins in the fun by flicking for four more. Fifteen off the over, again. Williamson has used only five bowlers in the whole tournament, so if Pakistan can hit one of them out of the attack, they should win the match.

4th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Rizwan 18, Babar 14) Babar is getting into the groove now. Facing Lockie Ferguson, he starts with a classy off-drive, then uses the extra pace to dab through the vacant slips. Slip is a run-saving position! That’s 21 off eight balls, but Ferguson puts the plug in, conceding only two off the last four.

3rd over: Pakistan 24-0 (Rizwan 17, Babar 7) Boult, artisan that he is, can be expensive and both batters tuck into this over. Babar plays his best shot for several weeks, a flashing cover force for four. Rizwan, sensing the moment, piles in with a glance for four and a cut for four more. Fifteen off the over!

2nd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Rizwan 7, Babar 2) The Kiwis need a strong start from their senior seamers and they get it from Tim Southee, whose first over goes for just two singles. The algorithms are giving Pakistan a 65pc chance of a win, which seems about right, although chasing has been unexpectedly tricky in this tournament.

1st over: Pakistan 7-0 (Rizwan 6, Babar 1) It’s Trent Boult to get the Pakistan innings under way, and just like New Zealand’s, it begins with a bang. Mohammad Rizwan cuts the first ball for four. Boult bounces back, inducing a nick from Babar Azam – but it’s dropped by Devon Conway, who has to change direction behind the stumps. Kane Williamson reacts with nothing more than a sly smile. Babar has been in such bad form that the plan may be to keep him there.

NZ finish with 152 for 4, which shouldn’t scare Pakistan. Time for Babar to join the fun?

NZ finish on 152

20th over: New Zealand 152-4 (Mitchell 53, Neesham 16) Naseem Shah bowls the last over and again, it’s all ones and twos. Only eight off it. Pakistan must now be firm favourites, especially with the pitch (low and slow) making them feel at home. Shaheed Shah Afridi was superb, taking 2-24 off his four overs. Kane Williamson was characteristically cool and calm, possibly too much so. But let’s hear it for Daryl Mitchell, who has now appeared in two T20 World Cup semi-finals and proved impregnable: 72 not out to win last year’s semi against England, and 53 not out to make a game of this one against Pakistan. His temperament is made of teak.
