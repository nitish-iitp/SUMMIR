Right, that's it for now, but there's a very big game starting in Group B shortly.

England's World Cup is on the line against Oman and we'll be live in about 15 minutes. Join us then.

The Tigers are second in Group D on four points, two behind leaders South Africa. If they beat Nepal, they're through. The Dutch need to beat Sri Lanka and hope.

Tim Pringle loses his leg stump. It's been a horror ten balls for him against quality bowlers. I don't see Bangladesh as serious hot contenders and I think they will find that next level of competition tough.

More importantly they got the job done.

Pringle b Taskin 1 (Ned 134-8)

All over. Stumps splattered and Bangladesh bouncing.

Tim Pringle tries to flog the last ball into the sea but only loses his leg peg.

That's pretty impressive from Bangladesh, who are on the verge of the last eight.

We've come to expect a lot more from the Netherlands and their performance has been disappointing.

Quite brilliant from The Fizz, who only concedes two off the bat in the 19th. Stick a fork in this one.

Thirty-six from two seems like a lot, especially when one of the two is being bowled by Mustafizur.

Fetch it from the crowd! New man Aryan Dutt can hit a long ball, which he does over cow when Rishad drops short. That is a very big hit.

A smart caught and bowled from Rishad. Hitting big aggressive shots has been super tough.

'Easy as they come' - Van Beek caught and bowled by Hossain

It's a procession now. Logan van Beek skies Rishad Hossain straight up, with the bowler steadying himself to take the catch. All over bar the shouting.

Mustafizur is going through all sorts of deliveries. More varieties than Heinz. Cutters, back of the hand. The Dutch are befuddled. 43 from 18 would take something very special.

Great spell from Shakib. 0-29 from his four. I can't see the Dutch getting the required 45 off 24.
