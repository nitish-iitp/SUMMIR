Namibia VS SCO Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 - Namibia vs Scotland Live Updates.

T20 World Cup 2024 LIVE Score: Namibia will take on Scotland in their second ICC T20 World Cup 2024 fixture at the Kensington Oval in Barbados on Friday.

Namibia got their tournament underway in dramatic fashion as they picked up a win over Oman in a super over with David Weise starring for his side.

Scotland, on the other hand had to be content with a point after their opening fixture against England was abandoned due to torrential rain midway through the game.

Scotland were impressive with the willow as their openers managed to put up 90 runs in 10 overs in the truncated game without surrendering a wicket against the seasoned neighbours as George Munsey and Michael Jones held the crease spectacularly well.

Both sides will look to get one-up over the other on Friday in a crucial encounter that might dictate the course of their tournament as the event progresses.

Namibia Full Squad:

Gerhard Erasmus (C), Zane Green, Michael Van Lingen, Dylan Leicher, Ruben Trumpelmann, Jack Brassell, Ben Shikongo, Tangeni Lungameni, Niko Davin, JJ Smit, Jan Frylinck, JP Kotze, David Wiese, Bernard Scholtz, Malan Kruger, PD Blignaut
