A brilliant start and a brilliant finish has helped Scotland to a fantastic win over Namibia that puts them in a very good position in their T20 World Cup group.

Michael Leask and Richie Berrington were the stars of the show, putting on 74 runs from 42 balls for the fifth wicket to put the Scots back in the driving seat in Barbados.

Scotland now take on Oman on Sunday night; a win would give them a superb chance of qualifying for the Super 8s.

Catch you then.

Scotland keeper Matthew Cross is filling in for Richie Berrington on media duties:

"He's got a little bit of cramp, so you've got me instead.

"It was an important win. We've given ourselves a chance to go through now so two big games to come.

"Leasky's the kind of guy who can do that - incredible striking.

"We've got to take it one game at a time. Oman are a very good cricket team and then the big one against Australia."

Losing captain Gerhard Erasmus reacts to Namibia's loss: "It's a big rivalry between us and at a World Cup, after putting 150 on the board, there's not a better opportunity. Unfortunately we let it slip.

"I thought we scored about par, but then we weren't up to scratch in the field or with the ball.

"We've got to regroup and hopefully come back stronger. We're going to give it our best shot in every game."

'My role is simple - hit it out of the ground'

Scotland's Michael Leask has been named player of the match:

"That means a lot. A lot of people have come to watch and we repaid that faith. It's a hell of a feeling.

"Berro played a wonderful knock there. We've got two big games to go now.

"My role is simple, hit the ball hard, find gaps and if it's in the slot try hit it out of the ground. Luckily today it came off."

The big partnership was Leask and Berrington - as it so often is for Scotland.

That got Scotland from 73/4 to 147/5 and turned the tide. Namibia had the Scots really struggling to find their pace, but the two ever-reliable batters put on a big stand and perhaps more impressively, took Namibia's two key seamers apart.

Let's gets some reaction...

There's a pocket of Scottish support going absolutely wild in Barbados, and rightly so.

A brilliant chase, led by captain Berrington.

Scotland have done it and they do it in style!

Richie Berrington smashes it back past David Weise and into hospitality for six big runs! That's the win confirmed and Scotland are top of the group!

David Wiese runs up... and holds on. He'll have another go at that.

Chris Greaves isn't fazed. It's a horrendous, slow, short ball. It's two runs and perhaps couldn't be more, but it didn't have the pace.

Chris Greaves is the next man in. He hits a single off Ruben Trumpelmann and will face the next ball.

Trumpelmann yells at the Barbados sky. 13 runs off that over. Can David Wiese do better?

Leask c Wiese b Trumpelmann 35 (Sco 147-5)

Leask goes! He was down on one knee again but this time he doesn't catch it cleanly and David Wiese is just able to get down to it on the boundary.

Leask is embraced by coaching staff as he wanders off. Scotland should not lose from here.

It's a no ball from Trumpelmann, which Scotland take two off. He is one of Namibia's best bowlers but he isn't showing it tonight, he's been so costly.

If Scotland win this game, which it now looks likely they will, they go top of the group.

Michael Leask is Scotland's hero - yet again.

He's hit 32 off 14 balls - a fourth six. His timing against the fast bowlers is incredible and this time Ruben Trumpelmann.

It's like he sees it in slow motion, and he catches it clean off the bounce to swot it over midwicket.

That was proper buffet bowling, and Leask sends it soaring into the stands.

A massive over for Scotland.

It's happened again and suddenly this game has swung massively towards Scotland.

It's a full toss that Wiese lobs at Leask, and he absolutely clobbers it over square leg.

We're told that's been hit 93 metres. David Wiese wears a grim expression.

That is a six! Absolutely massive from Michael Leask.

David Wiese is the man bowling. He was supposed to be the man to save Namibia but instead he's being slogged around the ground, as Berrington dispatches him for four two balls later.

Scotland won't die wondering.

Richie Berrington nails one towards midwicket but Malan Kruger produces some fine fielding to stop the boundary.

Ruben Trumpelmann concedes seven from that over - the run rate is now over 10.

This is tense. Surely we can't go to another super over, can we?

They'll need to be well hydrated to get between the wickets in the next few overs.
