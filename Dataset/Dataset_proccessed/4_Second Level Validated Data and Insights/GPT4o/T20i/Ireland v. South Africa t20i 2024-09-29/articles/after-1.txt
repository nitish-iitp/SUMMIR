Ireland vs South Africa, 2nd T20I Live Score and Updates:

Hello and welcome to our coverage of the second T20 international match between Ireland and South Africa taking place at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on Sunday.

The Irish side will be under pressure to step up after their loss in the previous game. South Africa has looked a much better side after the poor show in the UAE against Afghanistan earlier. Aiden Markram will hope that the Proteas can once against step up their performances as they aim to secure their second win and confirm a clean-sweep series victory.

Ireland will hope that their bowling attack can really up their game. They were unable to pick up early wickets in the previous game and that could very likely prove to be the difference in today’s fixtures as well.

As for the weather conditions in the capital city, hardly any chance of interruptions due to rain and expect the temperature to hover at the 30 degrees Celsius mark proving to be a warm and fiery contest between the two sides.

Ireland Playing XI: Paul Stirling(c), Ross Adair, Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, Neil Rock(w), George Dockrell, Mark Adair, Fionn Hand, Matthew Humphreys, Benjamin White, Graham Hume

South Africa Playing XI: Ryan Rickelton(w), Reeza Hendricks, Matthew Breetzke, Aiden Markram(c), Tristan Stubbs, Wiaan Mulder, Patrick Kruger, Bjorn Fortuin, Nqaba Peter, Lizaad Williams, Lungi Ngidi

Paul Stirling, the winning captain is in for a chat. He says that at the halfway mark, the team felt they were 15-20 runs short, as the opposition bowlers applied pressure, leaving them slightly under-par. With less dew on the pitch, however, they managed to pull through and secure the win. Explaining why wickets fell in clusters, it was noted that spending time at the crease was crucial to understanding the pace of the wicket, which ultimately won them the game. With new batters coming in, there was always a chance for a breakthrough. The team was absolutely delighted with the victory, acknowledging that it could have gone either way. Ends by saying that he is over the moon with the result, hoping to carry the momentum into the ODIs.

Earlier in the innings, we saw Ireland gets off to a flier, but just like the first match, they once again faltered in the death overs, and to their disappointment they could not get over the 200-run mark which was easy to breach with the way Ross Adair and Paul Stirling got going. The former even recorded his ton, but in the end it is the win that matters the most. Paul Stirling will be elated with the way his bowler’s came back in the game.

With 23 runs required off the final two overs, South Africa’s hopes rested on Breetzke, but his dismissal in the penultimate over left them in a precarious position. Ireland’s bowlers and fielders held their nerve in the closing stages, executing perfect death bowling and sharp fielding to stifle any late resurgence. In the end, Ireland’s spirited fightback ensured they defended the total, leveling the series and denying South Africa a clean sweep.

Just as it seemed South Africa had the game under control, Ireland’s bowlers turned the tide. The Irish attack, which had been kept at bay in the first half, suddenly came to life, striking at regular intervals to stall the Proteas’ progress. Matthew Breetzke, though composed, found himself running out of partners as Markram, Stubbs, and Mulder fell cheaply, all failing to get into double figures. Despite South Africa’s early dominance, the pressure began to mount as wickets tumbled.

South Africa’s chase of 196 was always going to be a formidable task, but they began with confidence, thanks to Reeza Hendricks and Ryan Rickelton, who provided a solid platform. Rickelton was the aggressor early on, making his intentions clear with a flurry of boundaries before falling in the final over of the Powerplay. His departure, however, did little to disrupt South Africa’s rhythm, as Matthew Breetzke stepped in to support Reeza Hendricks. The latter timed his knock perfectly, converting his promising start into a well-constructed half-century. By the halfway mark, the Proteas looked well on course, sitting comfortably at 88 for 1.

What a game this one turned out to be. There was a time when we all though South Africa might cruise towards victory, but Ireland fought back till the very end and made solid comeback to level the series. Unfortunately, we won’t be getting a series-decider in this one. Ireland walk out of the series with their heads held high.
