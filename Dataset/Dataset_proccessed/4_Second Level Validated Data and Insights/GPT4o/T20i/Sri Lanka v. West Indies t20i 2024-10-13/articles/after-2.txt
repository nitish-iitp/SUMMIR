Sri Lanka vs West Indies 1st T20I Highlights: West Indies defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets to take 1-0 led in the three-match series on Sunday. WI chased down 180 in 19.1 overs with Brandon King and Evin Lewis hitting half-centuries.

West Indies captain Rovman Powell won the toss and opted to bowl first against Sri Lanka in the series opener.  “The field is on the wet side, hopefully our bowlers can make the most of the conditions,” Powell said during the toss.

Earlier in the game, after being put into bat, Sri Lanka lost a few early wickets, which took the momentum away from them. Later on, Kamindu Mendis and Charith Asalanka stitched a 82-run stand to build a solid base for the death overs. Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Maheesh Theekshana applied the finishing touches and got a competitive total on the scoreboard. Although, Sri Lanka could not really start well with the ball, and that took the game away from them.

Sri Lanka then managed to drag things back just a little courtesy their spinners. However, West Indies needed just a couple of good knocks and that came from Powell, Chase and Rutherford. They played smartly, just what was needed then and have taken their side over the line. Sri Lanka were superb in the death overs, but only if they had taken some early wickets, it could’ve been their game.

That got nervy in the end but it is West Indies who have managed to take a 1-0 lead. A fantastic chase by them. We felt the score was a little above par but their openers got them off to a brilliant start. King especially, he took the attack to the bowlers and Lewis played as the perfect foil. They added over 100 and turned the tide completely into their side’s favor.
