NEW DELHI: India advanced to the Super Eight stage as the top team in Group A with seven points from four matches. Canada, who had already been eliminated, finished with three points.
The United States' match against Ireland at the same venue was called off on Friday due to a wet outfield after continuous rain, which posed a risk of life-threatening flooding in South Florida.

As a result of the cancellation, Pakistan was eliminated, and the U.S. qualified for the Super Eight stage for the first time by securing second place in the group with five points.
Central Broward Park is set to host the last Group A match on Sunday, with Pakistan facing bottom side Ireland.
