India vs Afghanistan Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024: India beat Afghanistan by 47 runs at the Kensington Oval in Barbados on Thursday in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 encounter.

Suryakumar Yadav scored a fine half-century as India posted a competitive 181/8 against Afghanistan in their first Super 8 match of the 2024 T20 World Cup. India lost opener Rohit Sharma early on 8 before Rishabh Pant and Virat Kohli led a solid recovery. Pant and Kohli exited in quick succession with Rashid Khan striking thrice in as many overs to keep India from exploding. However, Suryakumar did explode for his second fifty of the competition. Hardik Pandya played a good hand, hitting 32 off 24. Fazalhaq Farooqi and Rashid took 3 wickets each.

The men in blue went on to defend their title successfully as they bundled out Afghanistan for 134 runs in 20 overs as Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh registered three-fers, while Kuldeep Yadav picked two wickets.

Toss Report

India skipper Rohit Sharma won the coin toss and decided to bat first. For India, Kuldeep Yadav comes in, replacing Mohammed Siraj. Afghanistan have also made one change – Hazratullah Zazai replaces Karim Janat.

What Rohit said

“(The pitch) Looks alright at this moment. Looks a good track. No grass on the pitch, I guess it will get slower. It’s better than New York. Have to adapt to the conditions quickly. It’s about understanding what we need to do in conditions like these,” Rohit said at the toss.

What Rashid said

“We would have liked to bat first (too). We’re happy with our preparations and how things have gone. We are facing good teams, need to control our emotions and play our natural game. It does help getting used to the conditions,” said Rashid.
