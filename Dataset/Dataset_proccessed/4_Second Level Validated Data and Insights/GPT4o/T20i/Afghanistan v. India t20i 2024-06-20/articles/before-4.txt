Team Analysis

Afghanistan

Afghanistan have drubbed the likes of Uganda, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea in their first three wins at the T20 World Cup 2024, with their batters and bowlers stepping up as a collective unit. However, in their last match, co-hosts West Indies overpowered their spin attack, handing then a 104-run defeat in St Lucia. But, with the likes of Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Gulbadin Naib, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Naveen-ul-Haq, and captain Rashid Khan, who have been the top performers thus far in the tournament, can turn things in their favour at any given moment.

India
