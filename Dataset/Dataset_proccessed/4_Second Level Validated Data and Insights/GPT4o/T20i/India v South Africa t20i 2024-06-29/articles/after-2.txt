Good night and thank you!

Time for us to go, leaving India celebrating on the Kensington Oval outfield with their families . A fabulous final match to finish with after the semi-final disappointments. Huge congratulations to India – the team of the tournament, gilded with the incredible Bumrah. Commiserations to South Africa – a super team and so close to glory. Is this another choke? Hard to say that when Bumrah is on the pitch.

Ali’s report will be here soon to mark the full stop on this OBO. Thanks for all your messages throughout the competition – it has been great fun. Good bye!

“Is Pant’s ‘knee injury’ the defining moment of the tournament? Looks a bit grim from this neutral POV, sucking away SA’s momentum and giving Rohit and co a free strategic timeout.” Ah, Nathan Brown – who knows, who knows?

India are champions!

India collect their medals, huge smiles. Rohit Sharma: “It’s very hard to sum up what we’ve been through for the last three years. We’ve worked very hard as individuals and as a team. Today is a result of what we’ve been doing the past three or four years. Guys do understand when the pressure is on what needs to be done, we had the perfect example of this today when the back is against the wall what is required. We wanted this really bad, thanks for the management for helping us.”

Virat, all the years he has played and the others played around him. I’ve played alongside Bumrah for so many years, I know exactly what he brings to the table but how? It is just masterclass. He backs his skills. Jasprit Bumrah to put it in one phrase is a class act. I am very proud of the boys. The fans are fantastic, from New York to Barbados, I want to salute them and also back home millions are watching us, this is for them, they have been waiting for a long time. “

An impatient Hardik beckons Rohit over. The trophy is his at last Out come the fireworks and the glitter and the champagne.And at last Rahul Dravid gets his moment in the sun, stepping down with a trophy – not a bad way to go.

Carlos Brathwaite, destroyer of English dreams in 2016, puts the T20 World Cup on the presentation podium and gives everyone a little wave.

Up come the umpires, then South Africa to collect their medals in a box to respectful applause Aiden Markram: “Obviously gutted for the time being. Will take some time to have some reflection on a really good campaign. It hurts quite a bit but really proud of the team. Thought we bowled well without much help from the pitch, incredibly proud of this group of people. We’ve seen with a lot of our games that it isn’t over till the last ball is bowled, especially at the back end things happen quite quickly, we got into a great position which proves we are worthy finalists. One thing that is guaranteed that a South African is a competitive person, a respectful person and and won’t go down without a fight.”

“Was that a legal catch?” asks Paul Burns. “After going over, Yadav never got a foot down inside the rope before taking it.”

Here is one of the best defensive plays ever and it may have single-handedly won the T20 World Cup Final for India.

“To steal someone’s phrase,” taps David Bertram, “Cricket bloody hell.”

Eoin Morgan is in plain-speaking mode. “South Africa spectacularly fell apart.” he says. “I thought with the momentum that was there today, they were there, they took the game to the brink and then acted like a frightened rabbit, you have to stick to the process.”

Player of the tournament: Jasprit Bumrah

No competition! “You try to focus on the job, I don’t have a lot of words, the emotions are taking over. I usually don’t cry after a game, but we thought we were in trouble but to come back is an amazing feeling. My son is here, my family is here and so glad I was able to do that for India. i was trying to keep myself in a bubble, all tournament I just felt really clear and calm.”

Player of the match: Virat Kohli for his 76

This was my last T20 World cup. One day you feel like you can’t get a run, god is great, I’m just grateful I was able to get the job done for the team when it mattered most. I knew it was now or never, the last T20 game I will play for India, it was the game that helped me judge the situation. Time for the next generation to take over, going to take the team forward, will keep the flag waving high.”

So Virat retires from IT20s as champion. Not a bad way to go.

Interview, interviews, interviews. Axar Patel: “This means everything to me, when I come to this World Cup, the feeling that I have to do something for India and finally I do it. Im trying to keep it simple and trying not to think it was a final, just playing on merit. I think Rahul and Rohit, you can see, he is an amazing man. I wasn’t expecting to be promoted today, I didn’t et to think about my batting and that wasn’t for me.” Dravid stands quietly on the sidelines, taking it all in. Jay Shah, BCCI secretary, seems to help plant an India flag in the pitch and pose by it before taking a call on his mobile.

“Sorry to spam your inbox today.” It’s a pleasure Bhawesh. “So stressful these last few overs and my friends in India and USA won’t pick my call, haha. Such a great game. So happy India ended up on the winning side today. I guess getting Bumrah earlier paid off and South Africa wanted to see him through, a totally reasonable plan. Well supported by other bowlers One has to feel for South Africa though. They made it to final this time, they will win it soon. Love their team. Tough luck today for them.

“Dancing is on tonight!”

Diamonds on the soles of your shoes. Enjoy!

WICKET! Miller c Suryakumar b Hardik 21 (South Africa 161-7)

Oh my god – that is astonishing, Miller attacks a terrible wide full toss from Hardik, sends it high, high, on the boundary Suryakumar takes the catch with right hand on the run, realises he is heading over the rope so has the peace of mind to throw it up, side steps inside the boundary boards before catching the rebound on hte legal side of the grass. Amazing!

19th over: South Africa 161-6 (Miller 18, Maharaj 1) chasing 177 16 needed from 6 What can Arshdeep leave for Hardik to play with? (forgive me, Bumrah is now bowled out) Maharaj can’t squeak a run from the first two, a single from the third, then Miller nurdles two. A single from the fifth puts Maharaj on strike – will he just try to survive the last ball to leave Miller on strike. In the crowd, they watch through spread fingers. A brilliant bit of fielding from Arshdeep as he leaps in follow through to field the ball. Excellent over and high fives all round.

“I’m surprised there’s been so little mention of the special tournament playing condition in the event of India going 1-0 down in the play-off final series this weekend?” Are you being mischievous Brian Withington?

18th over: South Africa 157-6 (Miller 18, Maharaj 1) chasing 177 20 needed from 12 Miller shadow boxes at Bumrah’s first ball, bum sticking out like a unsupported shelf. The second a dot, a single from the third. Can he breakthrough? Yes he can, of course he can – a ball of beauty. Maharaj somehow gets the bat down on the fifth, and the sixth is squeezed for a single. High, high, tension.

WICKET! Klaasen c Pant b Hardik 52 (South Africa 151-5)

Klaasen stretches for a wider delivery from Hardik but the feet don’t move and he can only squeak an edge through to Pant. He can’t believe what he’s just done. Off he must go.

Fifty for Klaasen!

16th over: South Africa 151-4 (Klaasen 52, Miller 15) chasing 177 Bumrah, but is it too late? An lbw appeal, but it is an inside edge. A yorker of perfection, but Klassen keeps it out. They survive, and Klaasen reaches an astonishing innings-turning 50 from 23 balls. A pause, as Pant gets his knee (strategically?) strapped. 26 needed from 24 balls.

Hands on hips for Rohit as Klaasen ploughs through Axar Patel – 24 from the over: Four over Axar’s head, then six onto the roof, six over long-on, four flying through the off side. Throw in a couple of wides and South Africa now need just a run a ball.

10th over: South Africa 81-3 (de Kock 29, Klaasen 7) Brief breathing space for India with three dots off Hardik’s first over, but then Klaasen flambes six, flat and straight over point. A no ball brings a free hit which Pant takes behind the stumps. At the half way stage, South AFrica are marginally ahead. But Bumrah.

“Good afternoon,” hello Bhawesh Kumar!

“The last time I sent you an email, it was probably 4 am or something in Cambridge, MA, and India was playing Australia in the World Cup final. I was anxious about India losing the game. This time around, the viewing time is much more reasonable, and as I am starting to get worried by this dangerous-looking partnership, Axar Patel clean bowlds Stubbs. My heart is starting to beat normally again. Hoping this time India wins the game. I will go dancing tonight if that happens :)“

Fifty fifty at this stage as to whether your dancing shoes remain in the cupboard…

Hello Alfred Hartford: “I’m a cricket fan from New Zealand presently in London and gratefully following your match feed in The Guardian.

“I’d love to know which Indian bowlers SA plan to attack. Good luck with that!

3rd over: South Africa 14-2 (de Kock 3, Stubbs 1) Rohit is persuaded to review a “caught behind” – I don’t know the stats on this but my impressions is Rohit is a terrible judge of these things – and India duly lose their review – nothing showing on ultra edge.

Hello Teresa Ewart: “Just finished watching the TDF - and onto the cricket… Good grief! Are they playing music between each ball? In what world does that make sense? Surely it makes it hard to concentrate? They “do stuff” between balls don’t they?” So true! I think the players are trained to just zone out though. Similarly I have no idea how those TDF riders keep going along a tiny path between packed shouting crowds with men run alongside them with flares.

20th over: India 176-7 (Hardik 5) Nortje, men on the boundary. Dube manages one four, over the ducking bowler, under the diving fielder at mid-on. Two wickets in the over, finishing with a huge leading edge from Jadeja, which Maharaj runs to collect. India have the highest ever score in a World Cup final – what can they do with it?

Dube throws himself at a full toss, sending it down the ground, and Miller catches a bullet, slipping as he does.

19th over: India 167-5 (Hardik 4, Dube 22) Jansen with the penultimate over – not a man who oozes confidence. South Africa think they’ve had Kohli caught behind, but it turns out to be a no ball. Kohli swings wildly at the free hit and misses – he fancies it was a wide but is told no. Kohli then pings a full toss through backward square for four, then six straight and sweet as you like, before being caught. That wicket could keep the final total more manageable for South Africa. Ah - but then Hardik immediately picks up four from a top-edge over the keeper.

WICKET! Kohli c Rabada b Jansen 76 (India 163-5)

Just when he’d got going! Serious, innings-building effort. Trying for a second six in the over but caught at long on.

18th over: India 150-4 (Kohli 64, Dube 22) Rabada’s first ball is greeted with a huge straight six from Kohli. The next goes for two, with Kohli sprinting wolf-like, prey in his sights. Four more swung with with dancing wrists to the rope. A big fat wide. Not Rabada’s best work: 16 from the over.

Fifty for Virat Kohli!

17th over: India 134-4 (Kohli 50, Dube 21) Nortje, clever bowling, Kohli nurdles but can’t reach the rope – his first fifty of this World Cup – off 48 balls. I’m not sure he raises his bat. Dube uses the wind to reach the rope off the last ball.

16th over: India 126-4 (Kohli 48, Dube 15) Shamsie is back, the brass band a tooting, drums pounding at the Kensington Oval. Dube goes again, very wide stance, swings Shamsie powerfully for four. Time, I think, to put the foot down.

15th over: India 118-4 (Kohli 46, Dube 9) Dube gives himself a couple of balls to get his eye in then swings the fragile-looing Jansen for six. A handful of singles.
