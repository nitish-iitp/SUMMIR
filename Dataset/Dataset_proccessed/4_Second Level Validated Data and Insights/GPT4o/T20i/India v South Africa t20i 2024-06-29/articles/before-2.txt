Preview

South Africa will take on India in the final of the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. These two teams have played some exceptional cricket in the tournament thus far, reaching the summit clash after staying undefeated during their respective campaigns. With such high-quality players in the South African and Indian squads, the T20 World Cup 2024 final could turn out to be an instant classic.

Pitch Report

The pitches at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, have been very good for batting in the T20 World Cup 2024, but it has also given some assistance at different times for the pacers and spinners alike. With that, the average first innings score of 153 might not be enough for either South Africa and India to defend in the final of the tournament.

Team Analysis

South Africa

The key run scorers for South Africa in the T20 World Cup 2024 have been Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, and David Miller, while the other batters have played their part reasonably well too. The bowling attack of South Africa has been very impressive in the tournament, with the likes of Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, and Keshav Maharaj taking wickets in various phases of an innings.

South Africa squad for T20 World Cup 2024

Aiden Markram (c), Ottneil Baartman, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Bjorn Fortuin, Reeza Hendricks, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs

India

The captain of India, Rohit Sharma, has picked up form in the vital stage of the T20 World Cup 2024, providing the team with explosive starts at the top of the order, following which Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel are doing the innings consolidation. Jasprit Bumrah has been quite exceptional with the ball for India in the tournament, while Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, and Axar Patel have chipped-in with important scalps as well.

India squad for T20 World Cup 2024

Match Prediction




Conclusion

There is nothing much to choose between the two finalists for the T20 World Cup 2024, but India will have a slight upper hand over South Africa owing to the better balance in their lineup.
