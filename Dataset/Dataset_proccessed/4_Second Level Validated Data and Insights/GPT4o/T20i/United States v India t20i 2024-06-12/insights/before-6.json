    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Both teams have won two games each, and USA having every chance of making the last eight is every bit the stuff of dreams.",
        "India tend not to fuss with their plans unless they absolutely have to. So within that dressing room, there will be plenty of support on offer for Shivam Dube, even though he has made no more than 21 in his last seven dismissed innings, which includes four single-digit scores - including back-to-back ducks.",
        "There was a time when it seemed like Corey Anderson was the next big thing in all of cricket. Even as parts of the world was ushering in the New Year in 2014, he was going to work for New Zealand and hitting a 36-ball century.",
        "India are well placed to make the Super Eights. USA have some work to do, but they won't mind that. Barring any injury concerns, both teams are likely to field unchanged XIs.",
        "The New York surface has settled enough that the scary up-and-down bounce that was seen earlier in the competition seems to be a thing of the past. The game is unlikely to be upset by the weather, but it may once again be low-scoring."
