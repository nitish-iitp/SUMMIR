    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'We knew this was going to be a tough task. We lost some wickets up front but we showed some maturity to take the game to the end. We played with a lot of these USA players and I am very happy to see their progress in cricket. They are going from strength to strength and I wish nothing but the best for them. They are hard working guys and they are marking their mark in the US. We knew our bowlers had to take the lead. Scoring runs is difficult on this surface but all the bowlers did their job, particularly Arshdeep. The way he started was magnificent. It is a big relief (to reach the Super 8s). It could have been anyone's game in all three games we played. You have to stick to the end and take the game deep. Luckily for us we managed to pull three in all three games and we can take confidence from this.'",
        "USA captain Aaron Jones: 'I would say we were 10-15 runs short on that pitch. We knew that 125-130 would have been a tough total to chase but it goes that way sometimes. I'm pleased to bring the game as close as we did and of how the boys bowled with such good discipline. The crowd has been brilliant, we've been waiting for this for the past couple of years so we are always going to make the most of it. We've still got a game to play, so we'll regroup and come back hard against Ireland after some discussions. The pitch suited our seamers, and I felt that was the best option against their batting, especially Shivam Dube who is very good against spin. We are hopeful that Monank Patel will be back for the next game.'",
        "Player of the match Arshdeep Singh: 'I'm very, very happy with the performance. In the last two games I gave away a little more runs, so I wasn't happy with that. The team always believed in me and kept backing me, so I had to deliver for them. The wicket is good for fast bowlers and helped us get seam movement. So the plan was to pitch it into the wicket and let the ball do the talking.'"
