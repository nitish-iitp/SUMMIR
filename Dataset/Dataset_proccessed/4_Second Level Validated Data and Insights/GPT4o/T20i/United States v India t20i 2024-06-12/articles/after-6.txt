Jones, who played crucial roles in both of the USA’s wins in the tournament, said it will be “exciting” to compete against the likes of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah at the Nassau County Stadium on Wednesday.

“Growing up as a kid, I always wanted to play against the best players in the world and I’m definitely going to get the opportunity to do that now – so it’s exciting for me,” Jones said on Tuesday.

“I’m excited to play against them, to talk to them, and definitely to beat them as well,” he added nonchalantly.

The USA will be riding on the wave of confidence and belief that they can beat the best teams in the world when they step out on the field on their home ground, but will be faced with the prospect of playing in front of thousands of Indian fans.

Jones said the crowd will support both teams.

“We have a lot of Indian players on our team as well.”

Several of these Indian-origin players in the USA side have played with and against some members of the Indian squad while growing up in India.

“This is the first time USA will be playing against India so they are definitely excited to play against some friends for sure,” Jones said.

Meanwhile, India are not planning to take the game “lightly”, according to their bowling coach Paras Mhambrey.

“Winning is a habit that you need to get into early,” he told reporters.

“This is the World Cup. Every game matters. Rhythm is important.”

Despite this being a home game for USA, Mhambrey said his team will have an advantage over the hosts, having played two tournament games and one practice game on the tricky New York pitch.

He urged batters to play with patience and work their way towards a big total.

“Every run here [New York] is very important.”

Pitch and weather conditions

The pitch in New York has steadily improved over the past 10 days and despite offering plenty of assistance to bowlers, it has become relatively easier to bat on.

Captains winning the toss are still choosing to bowl first to make use of any added advantage in the morning.

There will be some clouds over the East Meadow region in Long Island, where the stadium is located, but the forecast is clear of any showers. Humidity will be above 50 percent.
