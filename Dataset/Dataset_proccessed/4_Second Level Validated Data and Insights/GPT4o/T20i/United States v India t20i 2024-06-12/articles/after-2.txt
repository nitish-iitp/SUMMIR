Goodbye

19:30 BST 12 June 2024

Thanks for joining us for another entertaining day of T20 World Cup fun. We'll leave you with India's winning moment, and Timothy Abraham's match report from New York if you missed any of the day's play.

And tomorrow's the big one, so don't miss that. England take on Oman as they look to keep their Super 8s hopes intact with a huge win to boost their net run-rate over Scotland's.

That's at 20:00 BST, and is preceded by Bangladesh v Netherlands at 15:30 BST and West Indies v New Zealand in the early hours of the morning.

We look forward to you joining us!

India captain Rohit Sharma: "We knew this was going to be a tough task. We lost some wickets up front but we showed some maturity to take the game to the end.

"We played with a lot of these USA players and I am very happy to see their progress in cricket. They are going from strength to strength and I wish nothing but the best for them. They are hard working guys and they are marking their mark in the US.

"We knew our bowlers had to take the lead. Scoring runs is difficult on this surface but all the bowlers did their job, particularly Arshdeep. The way he started was magnificent.

"It is a big relief (to reach the Super 8s). It could have been anyone's game in all three games we played. You have to stick to the end and take the game deep. Luckily for us we managed to pull three in all three games and we can take confidence from this."

USA captain Aaron Jones: "I would say we were 10-15 runs short on that pitch. We knew that 125-130 would have been a tough total to chase but it goes that way sometimes.

"I'm pleased to bring the game as close as we did and of how the boys bowled with such good discipline.

"The crowd has been brilliant, we've been waiting for this for the past couple of years so we are always going to make the most of it.

"We've still got a game to play, so we'll regroup and come back hard against Ireland after some discussions.

"The pitch suited our seamers, and I felt that was the best option against their batting, especially Shivam Dube who is very good against spin.

"We are hopeful that Monank Patel will be back for the next game."

USA might think of what might have been, but they have to be positive.

They have gone toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in the world.

Suryakumar's unbeaten fifty was vital for India after an early wobble, losing both openers to fall to 10-2 and then 39-3 when Rishabh Pant was bowled for 18.

His patient 49-ball knock included some of his extravagant strokeplay but was mostly a gritty innings against some disciplined USA bowling.

He was dropped on 22, which may not have made a difference to the eventual result but the extra time spent at the crease could prove significant.

However, I suspect most batters will be happy to say goodbye to the New York pitches.

Including Virat Kohli, whose golden duck today sees him finish with a tally of just five runs in his three innings so far.

Player of the match Arshdeep Singh, who took a career-best 4-9: "I'm very, very happy with the performance. In the last two games I gave away a little more runs, so I wasn't happy with that. The team always believed in me and kept backing me, so I had to deliver for them.

"The wicket is good for fast bowlers and helped us get seam movement. So the plan was to pitch it into the wicket and let the ball do the talking."

So what does that result mean for the table?

India join Australia and South Africa in qualifying for the next stage, which was expected from all three.

USA still have a chance to qualify, though, as they still have Ireland to play in their group.

And that concludes the New York leg of the T20 World Cup. It's been low-scoring, but great fun and has produced some thrilling and memorable contests.

It's been a ground that has favoured the fast bowlers, so it's no surprise that another is named player of the match tonight. India's Arshdeep Singh took 4-9, including two in the first over of the game, as the USA staggered to 110-8 from their 20 overs.

We'll hear from him shortly.

It's been brilliant here in New York. There was a lot of talk about the pitches but they have flattened them out and it has made for good contests. Yes they were low scoring, but they were low-scoring thrillers.

Credit to the USA today, they put up a real good fight.

It was never in doubt that India would reach the Super 8s, but they have been taken close by this USA side. They put in a sterling performance.

INDIA WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS

BREAKING

India reach the Super 8s with an eventually comfortable win over the USA.

Shivam Dube hits two down the ground to seal the victory. There were nervous moments, particularly early on in the chase, but they were clinical with the ball and Suryakumar Yadav's unbeaten fifty will be very pleasing indeed.

A vital half-century for Suryakumar.

It comes from 49 balls, not in his most explosive style but with some glimpses of his brilliance. Most importantly, it's a match-winning one.

Netravalkar is going to bowl his last over.

Hopefully he's put that drop out of his mind.

He shuffles across his stumps and pulls off some kind of ramp or sweep over his shoulder for four past fine leg.

15 from the over. That'll do it.
