India will look to punch their ticket in the Super Eight when they come up against high-flying USA in match 25 of the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. 

The Men In Blue came into the T20 World Cup looking to end their unlucky pattern of near misses in ICC events, having come painfully close to glory in recent tournaments but eventually falling short on crucial moments.

Nevertheless, Team India look like they mean business this year and made a positive start to the campaign with two wins in as many games so far as they sit at the top of Group A.

Their tournament opener against Ireland was a stroll in the park, but Pakistani bowlers had the Indian fans at the Nassau County International Stadium sweating after India folded for just 119 runs, their lowest-ever T20 World Cup total.

Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan seemed to have got Pakistan off to a good start in their chase. However, stalwart Jasprit Bumrah turned the match on its head, knocking over Rizwan and Azam, while Hardik Pandya bagged 2/24, restricting Pakistan to 113/7, six runs shy of their target.

The weekend's result in New York also comes as a good news for USA, who now only need a win from their final two games to confirm Super Eight qualification.

The first-time participants sit second in the standings with four points after creating history at the Grand Prairie Stadium by beating Pakistan to secure their second win of the tournament.
