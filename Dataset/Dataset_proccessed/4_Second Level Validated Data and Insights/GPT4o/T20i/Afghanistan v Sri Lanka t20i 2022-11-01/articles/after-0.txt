Afghanistan vs Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by 6 wickets to win their 2nd match in the tournament. With the win, Sri Lanka moved to third position in the table with four points in four matches.  On the other hand, with the defeat, Afghanistan are out of the qualification race for the semi-finals.

Batting first, Afghanistan started positively, but none of their batsmen converted their start into big scores. Hasaranga, who was the player of the match, picked up a three-wicket haul and restricted Afghanistan to 144, requiring Lanka 145 to win.

In reply, Sri Lankan openers got out early, but a valuable partnership between Dhananjaya de Silva and Charith Asalanka sealed the deal for Sri Lanka. The Asian champions chased down the total with 9 balls remaining.
