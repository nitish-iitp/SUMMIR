Rashid Khan picked up an injury scare in Brisbane on Tuesday
Afghanistan will face Australia in their final match of the World Cup in Adelaide
Afghanistan's semi-final hopes ended after their loss to Sri Lanka

Afghanistan head coach Jonathan Trott on Tuesday ruled out any serious injury to Rashid Khan after the star leg-spinner hurt his knee during their Super 12 match of T20 World Cup 2022 against Sri Lanka at the Gabba in Brisbane.

Rashid Khan appeared to be in immense pain as he walked off the field during the penultimate over of the match on Tuesday after his knee got stuck on the outfield while he tried to save a boundary. Rashid had completed his quota of 4 overs but the star player was not able to carry on as he was helped off the field by the physio and his teammates. Rashid gave it his all on the field, trying to stop the boundary even as Sri Lanka were within touching distance of a comfortable victory in the 19th over.

Trott, speaking to the press after Afghanistan's loss to Sri Lanka, said Rashid will undergo scans to have the extent of the injury assessed but he said it is not serious. The former England batter also revealed that the leg-spinner had headed into the World Cup with a back injury concern.

"He's being looked at at the moment. I think he just jarred his knee. Also had a bit of a back issue coming into the World Cup. So that's just flared up again. I think he'll be okay," Trott told the press.

"Well, we don't know about that, but hopefully no serious injuries is what I'm trying to say. Thank goodness," he added.

AFGHANISTAN vs AUSTRALIA

Afghanistan's chances to reach the semi-final from the intensely-fought Group 1 ended after they lost to Sri Lanka on Tuesday. However, the rising Asian team have an opportunity to spoil defending champions Australia's party when they meet them in Adelaide on November 4.

Trott said the familiarity factor will come into play and the likes of Rashid can help the team when they take on the mighty Australians in Adelaide. Notably, Rashid played for Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League.

"Yeah, for sure, I think the case with a lot of players, the likes of Mujeeb and Nabi, who have played against the Australian players before," Trott added.

"I think yesteryears when nothing was perhaps known of players, but nowadays there's so much analytics of the game and analysis of things, but also very various franchises now that players get to play with various players or against them quite often," he added.
