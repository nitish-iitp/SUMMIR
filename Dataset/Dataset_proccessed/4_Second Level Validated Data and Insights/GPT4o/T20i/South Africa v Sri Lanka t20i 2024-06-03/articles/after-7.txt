Markram happy with South Africa’s efforts

“Happy with the win,” Markram says at the post-match presentation.

“The batting was a little up and down. [It] probably speaks to quite a tough wicket, and luckily, we found ways to score on this. It was a tough one from a batting point of view. We tried as much as we could to take the pitch out of it. We can take some learnings from it, and we are experienced.”

Hasaranga says it was a ‘130-140 run wicket’

Speaking at the post-match presentation, the Sri Lankan captain said: “We went with our bowling strength and hence we batted first. We wanted to put a good score and wanted to defeat them.

“We have three more games… we wanted to do much better, especially with the batting unit. Our bowling is our strength so if our batters do well, we can finish well.”

Nortje revels in great result for the Proteas

“It’s been a tough few days and we have worked really hard. It’s just great to get a result our way and build on the momentum,” Nortje said after picking up his award.

“I was very happy [with my performance]. I have been feeling good, it was just that it hadn’t paid off in the last few games. It’s been great to finally get a result. Some balls and wickets went my way, but… it’s a great result for the team. I think everyone bowled really well.

“To restrict them [Sri Lanka] to 77… it was a tough wicket, so kudos to the guys!”
