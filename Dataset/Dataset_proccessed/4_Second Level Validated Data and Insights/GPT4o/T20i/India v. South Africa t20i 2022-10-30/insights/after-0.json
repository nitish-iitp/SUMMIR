    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Temba Bavuma: '[On the discussion at the ten-over mark] It was try and up the intent. When you do that, opportunities come your way. Fortunately we got the momentum we needed. Our batting line-up is in good form, barring myself. It is a unit that has been together for sometime. [On their bowling] We were watching the games that were played here. Obviously it was risky but the variable bounce assisted us. We kept mid-off and mid-on up, which made us predictable but we backed ourselves. We came into the tournament as non-favourites and we will keep flying under the radar. We will keep improving and that's what we are doing.'",
        "Rohit Sharma: 'We expected the pitch to have something in it, with the weather around. We knew there will be help for the seamers. Which is why you saw that 130 was not an easy chase. I thought we fought well till the end but South Africa played well in the end. The pitch is such that the wicket can come any time for the seamers. It was a match-winning partnership from Miller and Markram. But we were not good enough on the field. We have played in such conditions so conditions are not an excuse. We want to be consistent in that department. We could not hold on to our chances, we missed a few run-outs including myself. [On that Ashwin over] I have seen what happened at the last with the spinners. So I wanted to finish with Ashwin before the last over. I wanted to see that the seamers bowl the right overs. Given the new batter came in, it was the perfect time for Ashwin to bowl.'",
        "Lungi Ngidi: 'It was very nerve-wracking. When games get so close, you cannot do much as a bowler but just sit. It is one of my biggest wins - to win an award at the World Cup. It comes down to watching a lot of games being played here. We have also played here earlier. We saw Pakistan bowl and it helped. Just after the ten-over break, Markram moved the game forward and Miller followed him.'"
