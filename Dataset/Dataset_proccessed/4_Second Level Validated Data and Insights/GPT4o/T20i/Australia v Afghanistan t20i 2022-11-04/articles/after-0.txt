In Short
Australia beat Afghanistan by 4 wickets on Friday
Australia finish with 7 points in their Super 12 Group
Rashid Khan scored an unbeaten 23-ball 48, but his knock went in vain

Australia, on Saturday, November 4, beat Mohammad Nabi's Afghanistan by four runs in their Super 12 match in the T20 World Cup 2022 at the Adelaide Oval. In the absence of Aaron Finch, who sustained an injury before the match, Matthew Wade led his team to victory.

Prior to the game, the Aussies had a number of permutations and combinations to worry about. After being put in to bat first, they had to score a minimum of 185 to topple New Zealand on net run rate.

But after they notched only 168 for the loss of eight wickets, the Black Caps became the first team to advance to the semi-final of the mega event.

Thereafter, the Aussies needed to restrict the Afghans to 105 or below to surpass England’s net run rate. However, Wade’s men couldn’t achieve that either.

It means that Sri Lanka have to beat England on Saturday in the Super 12 match at the Sydney Cricket Ground for Australia to qualify for the semis. A win will take England through to the semis.

However, if the match on November 5 gets washed off, Australia will go through with seven points. Hence, the last match in Super 12 Group 1 will hold a lot of importance.

As far as their match against the Afghans is concerned, Glenn Maxwell was the star for them. The Victorian scored 54 off 32 with six fours and two sixes, giving the Australian innings a finishing kick.

Thereafter, he pulled off a superb direct hit to send a dangerous Gulbadin Naib back to the hut. Naib, who replaced Hazratullah Zazai in the Afghan 15-member squad, blazed away to a 23-ball 39 before biting the dust.

Mitchell Marsh also played his part, scoring 45 off 30 while batting at No.3. David Warner and the hero of the match against Sri Lanka, Marcus Stoinis, made 25 runs each.

Apart from Gulbadin, Rahmanullah Gurbaz threatened to take the match away from Australia. The opener racked up a quick-fire 17-ball 30 with two fours and as many sixes, after which Kane Richardson induced a false stroke from him.

Right-arm fast bowler Naveen-ul-Haq was also excellent with the ball after he finished with excellent figures of 4-0-21-3.

In the death overs, Rashid Khan threw his bat around to score an unbeaten 23-ball 48 with three fours and four sixes, but his efforts went in vain. Afghanistan ended with 164 for seven in their run-chase.
