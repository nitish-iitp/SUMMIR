The hosts and defending champions Australia are currently in a spot of bother in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2022, courtesy of a massive 89-run loss in their first match against New Zealand. Now they require a similarly huge win against Afghanistan, who are yet to win a match in this World Cup. 

Australia and Afghanistan cricket teams would be meeting for the first time since the 2019 ODI World Cup. Australia will be going through fitness troubles as Aaron Finch and explosive batter Tim David aren't fully fit. However, with a must-win situation and spot for semi-finals on the line, Australian skipper Aaron Finch may take the field despite a sore hamstring. 

All-rounder Marcus Stoinis also had a niggle and thus didn't take the field during Australia's fielding in the last match. If Aaron Finch isn't able to take the field against Afghanistan, Cameron Green may make his place in the playing XI as Finch's replacement. 

Afghanistan meanwhile have already been eliminated from the tournament. Their World Cup campaign in Australia received a huge blow as 2 out of 4 of their games were washed out due to rain. Mohammad Nabi-led Afghan side would look to end their tournament on a higher note with a win against the defending champions.
