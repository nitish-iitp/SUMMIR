    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Mohammad Nabi: 'Really good game of cricket. They started really well but at the end Naveen and Farooqi bowled well and it wasn't a big total on that pitch. We started well in the powerplay and the middle, but threw away four wickets back to back and that put us under pressure. [Two washouts] Tough when you play first game and then don't play for 10 days. We didn't get that momentum but improved every game from there.'",
        "Matthew Wade: 'Okay, four overs out probably, brought our bowlers forward and gave Stoiny the last. Knowing you have the allrounder to bowl one of the last two is a bit nerve-wracking but I've seen Rash do that plenty of times. Never really felt safe. [Eng-SL game] We'll stay here and watch that game, hoping for a bit of an upset. We put ourselves in that situation, been trying to chase a bit of run rate but it hasn't gone our way. Bit slow out of the blocks this tournament, hopefully it doesn't cost us. [Finch, David fitness?] Yeah, hopeful they'll be right to go if we make the semis.'",
        "Glenn Maxwell: 'Certainly did, Afghanistan played well, struck the ball cleanly. Started well in the powerplay and we were able to haul it back, but there was some pretty clean hitting at the end. [Run-out, catches] Nice to have an impact in the field, knew I wouldn't bowl much. The wicket was quite slow during the day, quite hard to push on. Had to put a total on to give ourselves a chance to win the game. They executed well and we couldn't get away. [Eng-SL game] We'll be following it, we put ourselves in this situation but hopefully SL can do the job for us.'"
