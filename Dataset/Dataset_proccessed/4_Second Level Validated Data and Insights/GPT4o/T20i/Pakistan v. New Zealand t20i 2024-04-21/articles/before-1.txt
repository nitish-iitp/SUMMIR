The Pakistan Cricket Board announced on March 13 that the New Zealand men’s cricket team will tour Pakistan on April 14 to play five T20Is as part of its preparations for the T20 World Cup. Since the announcement, cricket fans have been eagerly waiting for it.

The BlackCaps arrived in the capital city on 14 April to play three T20Is at the Pindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi on 18, 20 and 21 April. Following that, both sides will move to Lahore, where they will play the remaining two T20Is of the series on 25 and 27 April, respectively.

This will be New Zealand's third visit to the country in the last 17 months, the first of which occurred in December 2022/January 2023 for two Tests and three ODIs and then again in April 2023 for a white-ball tour.

The 2022-23 Test series finished as a 0-0 draw, while New Zealand won the ODI series 2-1.

While in April later that year, the five-match T20I series ended in a 2-2 draw and Pakistan dominated the visitors in ODIs, claiming the series 4-1.

Earlier this year, Pakistan visited New Zealand and suffered a 4-1 defeat in T20Is.

Imad Wasim and Mohammed Amir, who had earlier announced their retirements, are back on the national team for the Pakistan vs. New Zealand T20I series. Haris Rauf has missed a berth due to his injury which he incurred during the PSL 2024.
