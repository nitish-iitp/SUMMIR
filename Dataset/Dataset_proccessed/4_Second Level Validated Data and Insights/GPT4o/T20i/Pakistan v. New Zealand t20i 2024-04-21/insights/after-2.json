        "Mark Chapman said, 'I think we know Pakistan have a great attack, 178 was a chase-able score, generally it's high scoring here.'",
        "Chapman added, 'Debutants bowled some tough overs and Ish was outstanding.'",
        "Chapman reflected, 'Yesterday it was slower and we lost wickets in clumps... you have 100 partnership, you give yourself a good chance to win.'",
        "Chapman noted, 'The way Siefert and Robinson set it up, we had a platform and we just tried to keep up with the rate, we knew they have world class attack.'"
