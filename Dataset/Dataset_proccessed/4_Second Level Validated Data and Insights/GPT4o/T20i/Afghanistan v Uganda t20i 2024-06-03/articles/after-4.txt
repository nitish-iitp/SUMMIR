ICC T20 World Cup: Uganda v Afghanistan (Tuesday 3:30 am)

The Cricket Cranes are set for their ICC T20 World Cup debut when they take on Afghanistan on Tuesday morning at the Providence Stadium in Guyana.

Uganda came into this tournament as the little-known, East African nation that made it to the grand stage perhaps by accident to those on the outside looking in. To the regular fans of the team, they have been a consistent side who has been drilled with the right ideals and this was all set in motion in 2021 with the arrival of South African tactician Lawrence Mahatlane.

He set the team up with a good system that focused on continuity and once he had his reliable core of players then the team struck oil. Too bad the South African could not keep his job past October 2023 but he had done such a good job that his assistant Jackson Ogwang was able to coach the team to a World Cup spot.

They defeated Zimbabwe in the qualifiers in Namibia and secured the spot in unprecedented fashion.  For the World Cup, the Uganda Cricket Association (UCA) has brought in Abhay Sharma and perhaps he is the right man for the team at this point in their development.

The coach is big on processes and situations, something he has tried to instil in this group of players. It is a really exciting time for them as they adapt to life in the big leagues.

“The guys look in good spirits but unfortunately we were not able to do any skill work on Sunday because of the rain,” explained Sharma.

Captain Brian Masaba wants the boys to play the match, not the teams.

The time for preparations is done and now it is time for the players to act on the work they have done so far.

“You cannot go on and on in preparation for the World Cup. We are looking forward to executing our plans and the execution is the most important thing. Because you have to make those decisions under pressure and I hope the boys take it really nicely and it works out for us,” commented Sharma.

Big stage

It’s been an eventful week for the team but now focus changes to the main event.

They got a chance to meet Team Australia where they incidentally shared a hotel within Trinidad and Tobago. There couldn’t have been a better morale boost than that.

The idea that they will soon play on the same pitches with these stars will probably give them the push they need to believe in the ability that brought them this far.

Opening against Afghanistan is not an easy feat but victory will belong to the brave. Captain Brian Masaba wants the boys to play the match, not the teams.

“We are going out there to try and win cricket matches. At the end of the day, it is just cricket despite it being the World Cup. It is important for us to take care of the process and not worry too much about the result. If we can do that as a team we shall get the results we are looking for,” stated Masaba.

These players will have to put the excitement of the moment behind them and embrace the rollercoaster journey this could become. Ugandans will have to be up in the wee hours of the morning in order to catch their favourite team but it will definitely prove worth it.
