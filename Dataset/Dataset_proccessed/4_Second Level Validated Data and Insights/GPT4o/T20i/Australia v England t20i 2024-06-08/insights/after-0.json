    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Plenty of strong reaction flying about. Buttler and Mott don\u2019t have a great deal of credit in the bank.",
        "Hard to recall a lamer second 10 overs in a big game by an England T20 side. Serious questions now for the management.",
        "England under a little bit of pressure now. The decision to bowl Will Jacks for the second over of the match will attract scrutiny.",
        "England were looking for a statement performance. Unfortunately not one like this",
        "Mitch Marsh is, as ever, very chirpy. With good reason after that performance. Australia are quite good in big tournaments.",
        "Adam Zampa is player of the match, deservedly so.",
        "Jos Buttler: 'They came out with a lot of intent and put us under a lot of pressure straightaway. We fought well, but they took wickets at crucial times and played really well.'",
        "Hindsight gives you lots of decisions you could have changed, it was quite extreme conditions with the short side and the wind. Jofra bowled really well and looked like he hasn\u2019t been away at all, such variety and skill, it\u2019s great to have him back.",
        "Outside the powerplay was always going to be the challenge, credit to Australia - their seamers were very consistent - making us hit to the long side. We came second today, but it\u2019s all laid out for us, what we need to do."
