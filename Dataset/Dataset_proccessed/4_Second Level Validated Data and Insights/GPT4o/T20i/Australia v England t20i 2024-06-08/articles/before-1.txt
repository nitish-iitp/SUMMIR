Preview

Australia will take on England in the Group B match of the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. The former champions from 2021, Australia, will be coming into this match after their 39-run win against Oman in their tournament opener after they initially faced some hiccups in their travel as they assembled in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, England are yet to kickstart their campaign as their opener was washed out against Scotland. 

Pitch Report

The pitch at the Kensington Oval in the T20 World Cup 2024 has provided assistance to the fast bowlers and spinners alike. Furthermore, it has given some assistance to the batters too. With that, the average first innings score of 151 at this venue in T20Is could prove to be quite a competitive total when Australia takes on England in a high-octane clash.

Team Analysis

Australia

Mitchell Marsh has been handed the responsibility to lead the team from down under at the T20 World Cup 2024. Apart from him, some of the key players for Australia are David Warner, Travis Head, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, and Adam Zampa, who will have to deliver consistent performance throughout the tournament, to help them win it once again.

England

The England captain, Jos Buttler, and his opening partner Phil Salt will have the responsibility to provide quick starts in the powerplay overs, allowing the rest of the batters in the lineup, including Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, to keep the momentum going. In the bowling department, Jofra Archer, who made his return to cricket for England after a long injury layoff, will be playing a key role of the enforcer, with crucial contributions from Mark Wood and Adil Rashid.
