Goodbye for now

England were very much in the hunt during the first nine overs of the innings.

But once the top order went, it was tough work for the middle, and the mounting number of dot balls finally took its toll.

England are now in a position where they must win their final games against Namibia and Oman to have a chance of qualification into the Super Eights.

Australia, on the other hand, go to the top of the table, courtesy of their win today and against Oman earlier.

We hope you enjoyed our coverage of this classic fixture.

Speaking of classic fixtures, we have one more in store for you when India and Pakistan face off in New York on June 9.

So make sure to tune in.

Until then, this is Rohan Sharma signing off for Al Jazeera.

Australia captain Mitchell Marsh relishes team performance

“I’m very pleased with that effort. I thought our all-around game was outstanding,” he said. “Our experienced players showed up when we needed them. We learned a lot from the conditions from the previous game [against Oman].

“We have an experienced group and I just let them do their thing. I thought Patty [Cummins] was outstanding. Our experienced guys stood up when we needed them.

“It was a tough end to bowl with the short boundary but they stood up and pulled it off. [We need to] keep learning in these conditions and keep sticking to our game plans.”

England captain Jos Buttler reflects on defeat

“Australia came out with a lot of intent and played really well – put us under a lot of pressure straightaway. It was tough to drag it out from there. We bowled well in the middle phase,” he said.

“They took wickets at crucial times and defended the total really well.

“Conditions were tough with the short side and the wind. Outside the power play it was always going to be a challenge. We had a really good start but credit to Australia.

“I thought Adam Zampa bowled really well. It was difficult to hit him. We played a really good team today and we came second. It is all laid out for us now and we have to dust ourselves and try again.”

Australia’s Adam Zampa named Player of the Match

“We play against England a lot so we know a lot of their players,” the spinner said after taking two wickets in Australia’s win. “We saw the way they went about the middle overs with the ball. It was hard to hit sixes out there.

“It’s one of those places [the Caribbean] that you don’t really know until you’ve bowled a few balls on it. Some of the wickets around the West Indies you really don’t know until you put the ball on the spot.

“We have great depth with our bowling attack and we all play different roles.”
