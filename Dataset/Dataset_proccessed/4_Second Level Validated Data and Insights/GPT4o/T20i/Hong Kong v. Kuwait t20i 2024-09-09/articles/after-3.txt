Hong Kong cricket was plunged into turmoil on Monday, with the city’s men’s team crashing out of T20 World Cup qualifying contention and women’s head coach Andy Cottam quitting after 15 months in charge.

There has been no official announcement from Cricket Hong Kong, China about Cottam, who was appointed in June 2023. However, the Post has been told officials accepted the resignation and would “immediately begin a review” of the coaching for the women’s team.

The men’s side, meanwhile, have been condemned to a long stay in the international doldrums after rain wrecked their must-win T20 World Cup qualifier against Kuwait in Malaysia.

Chasing 140 for victory, the Kuwaitis were 11 for two after four overs when the players were taken off the field at UKM-YSD Oval. The wet weather did not relent, meaning the teams took one point each.

As a result, Kuwait reached next year’s final qualifying stage because of their superior net run rate over Hong Kong, who tumbled out 17 months before the competition begins.

Head coach Simon Willis’ team will rue their misfortune after recovering from an inauspicious start with the bat to establish a position of strength by the time the heavens opened.
