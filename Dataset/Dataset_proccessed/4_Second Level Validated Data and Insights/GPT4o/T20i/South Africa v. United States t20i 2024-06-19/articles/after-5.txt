South Africa survive shock as USA fall just short

(PA Media) South Africa were almost on the end of a shock result in the T20 World Cup as the United States fell short in a brave run chase.

South Africa posted 194 for four from their 20 overs in the Super Eights stage and the US, making their debut in the competition, were agonisingly short as Aidan Markram’s side held on for an 18-run victory. Quinton de Kock did the damage with the bat for South Africa, hitting five sixes and seven fours in a 40-ball 74.

Markram provided support with 46 off 32 deliveries while some late-innings hitting from Heinrich Klaasen, who smacked three sixes in his 36, and Tristan Stubbs set an imposing target.

Opener Andries Gous was the lynchpin of the US innings, blasting an unbeaten 80 from 47 balls. He hit five fours and five sixes as he threatened to take his country to a famous victory.

However, he did not receive much support around him until Harmeet Singh smashed 38 off 22 balls, including three sixes. But when Singh was caught off Kagiso Rabada with 11 balls remaining their hopes were over as South Africa defended their target.

The win put South Africa top of Group 2 in the Super Eights, with England and West Indies kicking off their second-round stage on Thursday.

Righto, that’s me done for today. Well played South Africa and well fought USA. The Super Eights are up and running. We’ll be back in the wee small hours to bring you West Indies v England. Thanks for your company, goodnight!

The Captains have their say:

“Pretty happy with the performance as a whole, says Aidan Markram. “There were a couple of overs here and there that we need to tidy up. I think you always feel like you need more runs but the wicket definitely changed and got a bit slower, they were a lot less sloppy (in the field).

“A couple of lessons to takeaway, but nice for the batters to be in the middle and get some runs, especially for Quinny to really get his flow.”

USA captain Aaron Jones: “It’s hard to take a defeat after coming so close but we did lack discipline in the bowling, at times. Once we play good cricket we can beat any team in the world. But we need to be a lot more disciplined.”

That was some effort by USA falling only 18 runs short of SA’s 194/4 against their high quality attack. Sends a signal to their next Super 8 opponents, Eng & WI… #T20WorldCup

Quinton de Kock is player of the match:

The South African opener got his team off to a flier with 74 off 40 balls.

“We’ve had some tricky wickets so it was nice to spend sometime in the middle today. The USA put us under pressure towards the end. It was a great game. We’ve still got a couple more games to win.”

South Africa win by 18 runs!

Anrich Nortje gets South Africa over the line, conceding just seven runs off the final over to close it out. It was a lot closer than it looked like being though, USA really made the Proteas graft for it in the final five overs. The game looked dead but some remarkable and gutsy hitting from Andries Gous and Harmeet Singh saw the host nation roar back into contention. They’ll take plenty of heart from that. South Africa might well breathe a heavy sigh of relief.

19th over: USA 169-6 (Gous 74, J Singh 1) Jasdeep Singh joins Gous. A brilliant over from Rabada under pressure, just two runs and the wicket off it. Slower balls and wide yorkers - too good.

26 needed off the final over.

18th over: USA 167-5 (Gous 73, Singh 38) Shamsi to bowl the eighteenth. A drag down should’ve been smacked for four but Gous doesn’t get hold of it. Harmeet Singh on strike. He moves about his crease trying to engineer some room and call Shamsi’s bluff. Two dots follow. Now is the time for USA… SIX! Shamsi gets one over midwicket for a much needed biggun to bring up the USA 150. Shamsi spears down a wide. This is now the USA’s highest score in the tournament and it feels like they were stuck in second gear for way too much of it. Final ball incoming from Shamsi – SIX! Gous rocks back and pulls over the leg side fence. My giddy aunt! SIX MORE! Gous repeats the shot, the leg side fielder palming a flatter shot over the fence for the third six of the over! 22 runs off the over – 28 runs needed from 12 balls!

17th over: USA 145-5 (Gous 60, Singh 31) Rabada recalled. South Africa spluttering a little in the last few overs. Credit to the USA for being able to put them under some pressure. Shot! Harmeet Singh advances and muscles a length ball away over short cover for a one bounce four! Rabada digs one in and is poked away by Singh for a single. Can the USA take this to the last over? They need a few more lusty blows – a frustrating over for Rabada goes for ten runs.

50 runs needed from 18… one big over needed. Very big.

16th over: USA 135-5 (Gous 58, Singh 25) Some late hitting from USA in Antigua is giving their NRR a real boost. Good to see them going down swinging! Thirteen off Shamsi’s over including a powerful SIX from Singh and a well driven four from Gous. 60 needed from 24, stranger things have happened…

15th over: USA 122-5 (Gous 53, Singh 17 )Andries Gous comes to life, his innings has been a curious mix of complete dormancy and then little flurries of boundary hitting. He drives down the ground for four and then marmalises a SIX off a full toss down the ground for a SIX. And another! A length ball is clubbed over the leg side for another SIX. NINETEEN runs off the over and fifty for Gous. They couldn’t, could they?

12th over: USA 87-5 (Gous 29, Singh 6) Harmeet Singh joins Gous in the middle with USA in all sorts of strife, they are looking a thumping loss square in the eyes here. Gous gives their NRR a bit of a shot in the arm with a nice loft down the ground for four. Singh gets four more by sweeping a poor ball behind square. Eleven off the over, and the wicket. A lot needed off not very many though.

11th over: USA 76-4 (Gous 24, Jahangir 3) Maharaj is miserly. Just three singles off the over and the run rate now over THIRTEEN an over. Less a curious cobra and more a downright nosy one. Do snakes have noses? They have nostrils, but no actual nose? One to ponder, probably at another time. Probably.

10th over: USA 73-4 (Gous 23, Jahangir 1) Shayan Jahangir is the new batter, he manages to get some bat on a nasty ball in at the mid-riff, dropping away for a single. Ten overs done and time for a drink. Or, for me, time to drop a grubby three year old into the bath. Game slipping away for USA.

WICKET! Anderson b Nortje 12 (USA 71-4)

Corey Anderson slams a Nortje slower ball over the leg side fence for SIX but the big fast bowler has the last laugh with the next ball. A searing yorker ripping the leg stump out of the ground. Emphatically out!

8th over: USA 60-3 (Gous 21, Anderson 3) Decent start from Nortje, he too is sporting a some top lip furniture. I’m in good company – have been growing my own for a few weeks now. In my head I’m Robert Redford as The Sundance Kid. In reality? A bit nearer The Milkybar Kid. Good to get these things out of your system though I reckon.

Just three off the over as Nortje mixes up his pace and length skilfully.

5th over: USA 51-1 (Gous 16, Kumar 7) Seventeen runs off the fifth over! Marco Jansen goes full to Kumar who picks the ball off his pads with a flourish and times the undercrackers off it – the ball soaring into the crowd for SIX! Gous gets in on the action too – hopping out of his crease like a matador and smearing it away on the breeze for the second six of the over. USA making a decent fist of this.

3rd over: USA 28-0 (Taylor 24, Gous 2) Jansen continues. A leg side wide to start. A full ball is driven handsomely down the ground by Taylor for four. Jansen responds with another wide. Eeeesht! Jansen spears in a short ball and it takes off from back of a length – de Kock just managing to pluck it out of the sky after it passes the batter. That’s the most we’ve seen extracted from this wicket today, Jansen bending his back in frustration. A full ball is inside edged for four by Taylor, Jansen frowns like a man sniffing off milk. Ten runs pocketed from the over. Decent start from the Americans.

Play yerself in eh, Andries.

Akeal Hosein: ‘West Indies is still the ultimate goal for any young cricketer’
Read more

With four wins from four after the group stage (before the England match), West Indies have been leaning into the anthem under Rovman Powell’s captaincy, his squad from seven different countries sharing the lyrics in their WhatsApp group before the tournament and united by its sentiment. The buzz on the islands visited these past two weeks has been pretty palpable, too; a sense something could be stirring for this unique multinational team and their public.

“The West Indies is still the ultimate goal for any young cricketer,” says Hosein. “Yes, there are franchise leagues and all of that. But the feeling of putting on the maroon, I don’t think there is a more special feeling than that. Once selected, everyone comes together, it’s just a great feeling. Comrades. Yeah, we’re from different countries but that’s what makes us more special. We all piece together the puzzle. And we have our home crowd behind us.”

South Africa set USA 195 to win

Klaasen swivels on a short ball from Ali Khan and gets a big piece of it, the ball flying against the breeze for SIX. Two more follow as Klaasen does well to dig out a yorker and squeeze it away. Khan nails his yorker next ball but somehow Klaasen manages to scamper a single. Final ball to Tristan Stubbs… delightful! Stubbs gets down on his haucnhes and reverse ramps a full ball over the keeper for four. Fifteen runs off the final over – a formidable score on the board for South Africa.

20th over: South Africa 195-4 (Klaasen 36, Stubbs 20)

19th over: South Africa 179-4 (Klaasen 26, Stubbs 15) Netravalkar to bowl his final over. He’s unlucky with the first ball as Stubbs gets a genuine edge that evades the keeper and runs away for four. Stubbs moves around the crease trying to create room to swing his arms but Netravalkar is up to the task – stitching together four dots in a row to finish with 2-21 from his four overs. Sensational stuff, what a story he has been in this tournament.
