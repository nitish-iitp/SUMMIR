Analysis

The USA has played solid cricket to register two wins, one over Pakistan, to qualify from Group A alongside India. The American batting has found a way to score consistent runs even in tough conditions and could trouble the Proteas in Antigua. On the bowling front, the USA has a lot of in-form players like Saurabh Netravalkar and Ali Khan who have been able to pick up wickets in various stages of the game. 

Talking about South Africa, the Proteas have managed to win games from difficult games to ensure an unbeaten record in the group stage. The South African top order hasn’t looked very good with stars like Quinton de Kock, Reeza Hendricks and Aiden Markram struggling to score runs but the middle order has carried the side in crunch moments. On the bowling front, Proteas’ pace attack has been in blistering form with Anrich Nortje rediscovering his magic after a tough 2024.
