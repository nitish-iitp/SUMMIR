Rohit Sharma-led Team India is all set to play its last league game of the T20 World Cup 2024, which remains clouded by the flash floods which struck Florida a few days ago. Today's match at the Central Broward Park & Broward County Stadium, Florida is inconsequential for both teams as India has already qualified for the Super 8 stage, while Canada is already out of the marquee tournament.

The cricket fans will hope that the rain gods doesn't ruin the game for them as the drainage system of Florida stadium are not equipped to handle much rain.

India vs Canada Live Score: India's brilliant pace attack
