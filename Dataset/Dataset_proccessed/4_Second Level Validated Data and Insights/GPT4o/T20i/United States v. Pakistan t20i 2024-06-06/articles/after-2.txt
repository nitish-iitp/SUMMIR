The United States won a thrilling super over to seal a famous victory against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup in Dallas. After both sides finished their innings on 159 in their Group A match at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium, the tournament co-hosts held their nerve to pull off a major upset and make it back-to-back wins in the tournament.

Their captain, Monank Patel, said he hoped the win would “open many doors” for the game in the country.

Batting first in the super over, the USA made 18 for one, with Aaron Jones on 11 before being run out and seven runs coming via extras. Iftikhar Ahmed then took Pakistan to five for none off two balls in their super over before he was brilliantly caught by Nitish Kumar close to the boundary and USA bowler Saurabh Netravalkar restricted them to 13 for one.

In their regulation innings, Pakistan made a slow start, recovering from 26 for three in the fifth over to reach 159 for seven. The Pakistan captain Babar Azam hit two sixes in his 43-ball 44, Shadab Khan struck 40 off 25 deliveries and the No 8 Shaheen Afridi managed 23 not out off 16.

The USA, who beat Canada by seven wickets in their first match on Saturday, appeared to be cruising in reply, as they reached 104 for one in the 14th over. Captain Patel’s 38-ball 50 and Andries Gous’s 35 off 26 deliveries left them needing 56 to win off 44 balls. However, after Monank was dismissed in the 15th over it needed a six from Jones in the final over and a four from Kumar off the last delivery to tie the match and force the super over.

Patel hoped his side’s historic T20 World Cup super-over win against Pakistan will help boost the sport’s popularity in the country. “Of course, beating Pakistan in a World Cup is going to open many doors for us,” he said. “Obviously hosting the World Cup in the USA and performing here as a team, it helps us to grow cricket in the USA.”

Both sides face India in New York in their next matches, with Pakistan playing on Sunday and the USA next Wednesday.

Scotland bolster hopes and Uganda make history

Richie Berrington and Michael Leask shared a match-winning partnership for Scotland as they defeated Namibia in Barbados to bolster their hopes of progressing. After impressing with the bat in their washed-out opener against England, the Scots were victorious against the southern Africans in Barbados, chasing down their target of 156 with five wickets and nine balls to spare.

Things were looking dicey when Matthew Cross fell lbw at 73 for four, but captain Berrington and Leask took the bull by horns as they put on 74 from the next 42 balls. Leask blasted four sixes in his knock of 35 and Berrington was unbeaten on 47, ending with a flourish as he clubbed David Wiese all the way over long-on before punching the air with glee.

The result puts Scotland on three points, meaning England could find themselves feeling the heat if they fail to beat Australia on Saturday. Brad Currie had earlier excelled with the ball, with two for 16 from four exacting overs.

Uganda secured their first ever victory at the T20 World Cup, defeating Papua New Guinea by three wickets in a low-scoring clash in Guyana.

The African side, playing in their maiden World Cup campaign, were in significant trouble at 26 for five, chasing a target of 78, just two days on from being bowled out for 58 by Afghanistan.

But they were rescued by their vice-captain, Riazat Ali Shah, who top-scored with 33 and shared a crucial 35-run sixth-wicket stand with Juma Miyagi to help seal a historic win with 10 balls to spare.

“This is obviously huge for Uganda,” said their captain, Brian Masaba. “There is no other way to say it. To be at a World Cup is one thing, but to pick up a World Cup win, that’s something totally different. And it hasn’t sunk in [yet]. We’ll probably have to sleep over it before we understand the magnitude of what that means.”

Frank Nsubuga starred with the ball for the Ugandans in his first appearance at the tournament, taking two wickets and conceding just four runs from his four overs. At 43, the off-spinner is the oldest player at this year’s World Cup. “I watched Frank play growing up, so to see him do what he does at the biggest stage makes me very emotional,” said Masaba. “I’m not surprised that he did what he did, but doing it at this stage, that’s very, very special. And I’m very, very happy for him.” Guardian sport and agencies
