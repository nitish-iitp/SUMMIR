The second match of Group B teams — England and Scotland — was concluded without a result as rain marred the T20 World Cup 2024 tussle which was already shrunk to 10 overs.


After Scotland concluded their innings at 90-0, the rain started once again and the match umpires decided to call it off.

In the first innings, the match was greatly interrupted by rain as the it was stopped for about two hours due to persistent rain in Barbados after which it was reduced to 10 overs.

However, due to the DLS method, the revised target is 109 runs.

George Munsey (41 off 31) and Michael Jones (45 off 39) were the only Scottish batters to bat.

At the toss, Scotland's captain Richie Berrington won the toss and opted to bat first. He hoped his side to progress in the tournament as far as they could.

"It does look on the drier side, but as we have seen on this trip so far, the wickets can change ground to ground, day to day," Richie Berrington said after the toss.

"As a team, we want to progress as far as we can. Hopefully we can come out and make a few more special memories today."

Meanwhile, England's skipper Jos Buttler stated that he would have bowled first anyway and also confirmed that Mark Wood is in the playing XI over Reece Topley.

"Everyone's really excited to get going. It was a 50-50 call [with Reece Topley and Mark Wood] but we have gone for the extra pace of Wood today," Buttler said.

England: 1 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 2 Phil Salt, 3 Will Jacks, 4 Jonny Bairstow, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Mark Wood, 11 Adil Rashid
