Bridgetown, Barbados: Rain led to the abandonment of defending champions England's T20 World Cup opener against Scotland at the Kensington Oval in Barbados on Tuesday.

In a Group B match plagued by bad weather, Scotland made 90-0 in an interrupted innings reduced to 10 overs, with George Munsey 41 not out and Michael Jones 45 not out.

But before England could begin their pursuit of a revised target of 109 in 10 overs, under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, a fresh downpour led the umpires to call off the game. Both sides received a point apiece.
