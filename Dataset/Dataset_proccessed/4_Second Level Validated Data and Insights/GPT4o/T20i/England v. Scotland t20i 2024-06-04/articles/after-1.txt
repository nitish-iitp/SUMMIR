ENG vs SCO Live Score T20 World Cup 2024 England vs Scotland Highlights: The England vs Scotland match at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados, has been abandoned due to rain. Scotland set England a 109-run (DLS) target but not a single ball could be bowled in the second innings. Openers Michael Jones and George Munsey shared an unbeaten 90-run partnership as Scotland scored 90 for no loss in their rain-shortened T20 World Cup opener against defending Champions England. Munsey scored his 41 off 31 deliveries, while Jones hit 45 from 30 deliveries as the match was reduced to 10-overs-a-side contest. (Scorecard)

Right then, the rain has had the final say here in this clash between two European rivals. With this outcome, England's record of having never beaten a European team in Men's T20 World Cups will continue. The action does not stop here, though, as the other game of the day between the Netherlands and Nepal is underway in Dallas. Having bowled the Asian side out for 106, the Dutch are going along nicely in their batting effort and look set to give their NRR an early boost. You can simply switch tabs and follow our coverage of that game. Cheers!

The skipper of Scotland, Richie Berrington says that it is frustrating for everyone. Shares that the batters did a really job and they will take positives from this effort. Feels that they had a chance on this pitch which had uneven bounce. Adds that had they bowled and fielded well, they had an opportunity. Opines that batting at the top of the order suits Michael Jones really well and that he and George Munsey make a good opening combination.

!

The captain of England, Jos Buttler says he hopes for a dry day in their next game and that they get a full game. Adds it was a tough call to play Archer and Wood, they have good options and selection is a tough job.

!

Time to hear from the captains...

!

So, the INEVITABLE HAS HAPPENED, the game has been CALLED OFF! Quite frustrating, to be honest, as this was shaping up to be a really good one. Yes, a lot of people would think, England would probably knock those runs off quickly, but the game could have gotten interesting if Scotland had bowled well on what was a two-paced pitch. Nevertheless, both teams will share points and open their accounts in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, 2024.

UPDATE - 12.11 am IST (6.41 pm GMT, the previous day) - The rain has picked up and it is coming down really hard at the Kensington Oval. With 12.22 am IST (6.52 pm GMT, the previous day) being the cut-off time for a five-over chase, we do not have much time left and the chances of a resumption are looking pretty bleak.

!

England were quite off with the ball! They just could not land it right and despite there being purchase off the surface, they failed to make most of it. They will be disappointed that they did not manage to take even a single wicket. However, they will need to put that behind and now the onus is on their batters. The target of 109 is going to be a stiff challenge but they do have the firepower. Scotland on the other hand, if they bowl well, they can defend this. For now though, the covers are got on and till the time the rain does not completely stop, the players can't get out there. Stay tuned.

!

Scotland will be very happy with their batting effort. Pretty sure England will be needing to score over 10 per over. Yes, they do. The revised target for England is 109. Scotland’s effort even after the rain break was a good one for them. They managed to add 39 runs in the 22 balls they had after the break. Also, it was the openers throughout, they started well and have helped them to end well too.

ADIL RASHID TO MICHAEL JONES

FOUR! A boundary to close out the innings and Scotland end with 90 on the board! Adil Rashid tosses it up, full and turning away, on off, Michael Jones rolls his wrists nicely and nails the slog sweep. Hits it wide of deep square leg for a boundary. Not a bad last over though from Rashid, 8 runs off it.

ADIL RASHID TO GEORGE MUNSEY

Nicely bowled, yet again! Does not offer any pace and it is short, on leg, George Munsey changes his stance again and hits it to mid on for a quick single.

Flatter and shorter, slower as well, outside off, Michael Jones walks across to get momentum into the shot but mistimes the hit to long on for just one.

Oh, that kept very low! Drops it short but takes pace off, around leg, George Munsey changes his stance for the switch hit but the ball scoots through and sneaks under the bat.

CHRIS JORDAN TO GEORGE MUNSEY

Sloppy running but Michael Jones gets away with it! That could have been a very costly error. Jordan serves it on a fullish length, on off, George Munsey takes it on the full and smacks it towards long on. Jofra Archer runs across to his right and hits the stumps at the bowling end. Jones plonks his bat in the direction of the crease, instead of dragging it. The bat gets stuck in the turf and drops out of his hands but luckliy for him, he had his foot grounded inside the crease.

CHRIS JORDAN TO MICHAEL JONES

Leg bye! Attacks the pads and gets the ball to skid through, at 141.3 kph, Michael Jones goes for a heave to this length delivery but gets rushed in his shot and fails to connect. The ball rolls away off his pads to point for a leg bye.

CHRIS JORDAN TO MICHAEL JONES

Well bowled! Slanting in, on a good length, on off, Michael Jones can only pat this one back to the bowler. A precious dot.

CHRIS JORDAN TO GEORGE MUNSEY

At pace, on off, fuller in length, George Munsey loses his shape slightly and hacks it off the inner half of the bat to deep mid-wicket for a run.

CHRIS JORDAN TO GEORGE MUNSEY

SIX! Picked up beautifully! Jordan takes pace off but serves it a bit too straight, on the pads, George Munsey shuffles across and plays the pick-up shot over deep backward square leg for a maximum.

CHRIS JORDAN TO GEORGE MUNSEY

Swing and a miss! Angling away, on a length, outside off, George Munsey goes deep in his crease and has a swipe across the line but gets beaten on the inside edge.
