Ireland pulled off a historic win by defeating Babar Azam's Pakistan side by 5 wickets at the Clontarf Cricket Club in Dublin, their first T-20 win over Pakistan. Notably, Ireland had only beaten Pakistan once before, in the 2007 50-over World Cup.

The loss to Ireland puts Pakistan 1-0 down in the three-match T20 series, which comes just ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup which will be played in the United States and the West Indies from June 2. Notably, the two teams will also face each other in the group stages of the T20 World Cup next month.

Irealand's record win over Pakistan:

Batting first, a struggling Pakistan side posted a total of 182 runs in their 20 overs with opener Saim Ayub (45 off 29 balls) and skipper Babar Azam (57 off 43 balls) being the top scorers for the Men in Green. Meanwhile, pacer Craig Young was Ireland's star performer with the ball, taking two crucial wickets in one over of Babar Azam and Azam Khan to put the Pakistan middle order under tremendous pressure.

Ireland didn't have much luck with the bat either, losing their first two wickets in less than 4 overs. Andrew Balbirnie and Harry Tector then put on a 75-run partnership to take their side past the 100-run mark.

Later, Balbirnie continued to play a counter-attacking innings (77 off 55 balls) to take his side close to the target before being dismissed by Shaheen Shah Afridi in the 19th over of the game. In the end, however, Curtis Campher took a leg bye off the penultimate ball of the match to seal a memorable victory for his side.
