NEW DELHI: Cricket Ireland announced on Tuesday the selection of three men's T20 International squads, all under the leadership of batter Paul Stirling. These squads will participate in the upcoming three-match series against Pakistan in Dublin, the Tri-Series involving Netherlands and Scotland in Voorburg, and the ICC Men's T20 World Cup commencing next month in the West Indies and the USA.

Consisting of the same 14 players across all three squads, there is a provision for the inclusion of Josh Little, who is currently representing the Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League, as the 15th squad member for the T20 World Cup, as per Cricket Ireland's statement.
With regards to their international standing, Ireland Men are presently ranked 11th in the world in T20Is, aiming to make an impact in the upcoming series and tournaments.

Heinrich Malan, Ireland Men's Head Coach, said: "We have an intensive block of T20 cricket coming up this month ahead of the T20 World Cup - we have seven games in 15 days as preparation for the tournament. We will not be treating those seven games as warmups, though, we'll be aiming to win as many of those games as possible."
"The T20 format is fast-paced, think-on-your-feet style of cricket. To find a way to win - given the often frenetic and evolving game going on around you - is a skill you can truly only ever learn and develop on the field of play."

"The squad is one that we have gradually developed and tested out over the last 18 or so months - the skill sets we need to cover are there, albeit we have allowed Josh [Little] to continue in the IPL until his side end their campaign, so he will likely join us ahead of the big tournament."
"We are now entering the final stretch before the T20 World Cup begins, it will be a challenging couple of weeks, but we are ready to tackle whatever is thrown at us," he concluded the point.
