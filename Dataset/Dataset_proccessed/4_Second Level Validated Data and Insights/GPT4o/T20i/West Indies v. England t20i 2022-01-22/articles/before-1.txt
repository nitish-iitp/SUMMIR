According to the above, the hosts will be without Evin Lewis and Anderson Phillip due to recent Covid-19 positive tests, while Obed McCoy misses the cut as he is undergoing rehab on his shin injury.

, all I can say is that common sense has prevailed.

Add Lewis, McCoy, Motie and Hetmeyer and that is about as good as we can get for T20 in the WI.

I forgot about Allen. The only player that can come out of the team is Bravo.

Jason Holder hasn't been performing well of late. Which players would you pick?

Too many Yardies, and Allen is not even accounted for in your team.

I would drop Cottrell for Allen. All 11 batsmen.

Check my post afterwards, I dropped Bravo for Allen.

According to cricinfo:
Sheldon Cottrell is one of the most promising fast bowlers in West Indies. He is strong and muscular, can bowl fast, and his left-arm angle provides variety to the bowling attack. His athleticism in the field and powerful hitting in the lower order are bonuses.

I DROPPED HIM For Allen because Allen is a spin option, also a power hitter and an excellent fielder.


Against the BCA , the only bowler who checked England's rampage was Ashley Nurse with 4 overs for 20 runs.

WI selectors are just as myopic and guilty as the fans. They pick players that are representative of the region just to appease the local public. Not the best players available.Nor do they put the best 11 on the field at any given time. Smh.

Looks like both of them may be playing according to cricinfo.

Cottrell is one of our best fast bowlers and has done a more than decent job in t20s of late. He deserves to play and so does Allen. Hence the reason why I dropped Bravo.

 
Windiesfan78 2022-01-22 19:54:53 

Looks like a decent team. Hopefully we can get off to a good start.

 
Windiesfan78 2022-01-22 20:05:47 

Great start, there is a reason why I chose Cottrell.

We can only hope. I think we let them get too much but I will take it.

Just making an observation that is pervasive and problematic for the WI.NTM the rank incompetence of this particular board.
Donald Trump could do a better job.smh.

 
DIEHARD 2022-01-22 22:00:27 

For the first time ever I came close to the actual final XI.

I couldnt choose between Meyers and Bravo, was leaning toward Meyers because of the bowling option.

 
Windiesfan78 2022-01-22 22:20:16 

In reply to DIEHARD

Mayers would have been the better option in my opinion.

Take a guess brother, I bet you will be wrong .

In reply to Windiesfan78

We need an out an out batsman like bravo on the team

We have enough bowlers in the side as it is

Mayers can only replace an all rounder

His lates batting stats are not good

If Bravo performs when his time comes I will be happy. He needs to make good use of it, I know he has the talent.

What happened to Rutherford?
