Holder, King power West Indies to victory over England

Jason Holder's four wickets and Brandon King's half-century powered the West Indies to a nine-wicket win over England in the 1st T20I at Kensington Oval, Barbados.

Holder took 4 for 7 as England was bowled out for 103 in 19.4 overs at Bridgetown.

England sunk to 49 for 7 and was spared further embarrassment by lower-order batsmen Chris Jordan (28) and Adil Rashid (22).

King (52) put on 52 with home favorite Shai Hope (20) in 9.1 overs, before closing out the victory with an unbroken 52-run partnership with Nicholas Pooran (37 not out) to complete the victory.

It was West Indies' joint-largest win over England in T20s and England's largest defeat in the format.

West Indies lead the five-match series 1-0.

"That's the blueprint we ask guys to put up. Really happy for the guys. To come out and win a match isn't easy, to see the young guys come out and finish it off was fantastic," West Indies skipper Kieron Pollard said after the match. 

Pollard praised the work of Sheldon Cottrell (2/30) and Jason Holder, who shared six wickets in the match.

"Sheldon came back in, Jason showed his quality. These two bowlers were phenomenal, and then backing it up in the field. Sometimes when you get four wickets early guys can relax, but they know the importance of sticking to plans. Thought they were fantastic. This is just the first of five, but winning games isn't easy at all," Pollard said.

He also singled out the batting of King who was the second-highest run-scorer in the truncated West Indies tour of Pakistan in December.

"(King) Did well in Pakistan, and being able to finish the game is something we're trying to inculcate. Sometimes these surfaces aren't conducive to going hard. But well done to them, good opening partnership," the West Indies skipper said. 

His England counterpart Eoin Morgan admitted it was not the start to the series they would have wanted.

"West Indies dominated early on, we didn't seem to adapt. Have to come back tomorrow with a fresh game plan. Think the wicket could be the same again. Something we spoke about coming here, more so in Barbados, a little bit more bounce. Today it wasn't that consistent. Trying to get the mindset around risk-reward didn't happen," said Morgan.

Jason Holder was named Player of the Match for his four wickets and he said the loss to Ireland in the ODI series fired up the team.

"Tough series against Ireland, we weren't happy, but it's good to bounce back. Really pleased with the effort from everyone. Happy to see the ball go through the way it did. Just hope it remains consistent, that's the key for pitch preparation," said Holder.

The 2nd T20I is on Sunday at Bridgetown. 

Summarized scores: England 103 in 19.4 overs (Jordan 28, Rashid 22; Holder 4/7, Cottrell 2/30) vs West Indies 104/1 in 17.1 overs (King 52*, HOpe 20, Pooran 27*; Rashid 1/21). West Indies won by nine wickets with 17 balls to spare.
