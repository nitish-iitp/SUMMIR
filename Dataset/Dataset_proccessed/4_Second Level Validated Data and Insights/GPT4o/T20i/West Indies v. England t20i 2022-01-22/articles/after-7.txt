Bridgetown: England 103, West Indies 104-1 - West Indies won by nine wickets


Jason Holder produced a career-best T20 performance with the ball to help West Indies ease to a nine-wicket victory over England in the first T20I in Bridgetown.

Kieron Pollard’s side headed into the series in poor form, winning just nine of their 26 T20Is since the start of 2021, while England, T20 World Cup semi-finalists, are the No.1 ranked side in the format.

However, West Indies were on top of England from ball one, with Sheldon Cottrell and Holder removing Jason Roy, Tom Banton and Moeen Ali inside two overs and both recording a powerplay maiden.

Roy was bowled by Cottrell (2 for 30) one ball after dispatching the bowler for six – one of three England players to depart in that fashion – before Banton edged an outswinger to Nicholas Pooran at slip and Moeen picked out Fabian Allen at backward point to gift Holder two wickets in two balls.

James Vince (14) was the next to depart, smashing Cottrell for 14 runs in five balls before finding Darren Bravo at short cover and when Sam Billings was stumped by Shai Hope (bowled Akeal Hosein), England were rocking on 29 for 5 at the end of the seventh over.

Eoin Morgan and Liam Dawson survived through to drinks, but their resistance proved to be short-lived. The latter hit the deck in pursuit of a reckless single and was runout by Kieron Pollard and Hope at the start of the 11th, and Morgan departed nine balls later, the third victim of the troublesome 'boundary and out' trend.

The tail wagged thanks to Chris Jordan and Adil Rashid, who added 36 runs off 29 balls to move England safely past their lowest T20I total (80 versus India in 2012).

The former was eventually removed for a bold 28 (23 balls) in the 17th, picking out Cottrell at long-on off the bowling of Allen, but Rashid pushed on, steering England into three figures.

However, it was Holder who had the last laugh, picking off Saqib Mahmood with a slower ball and bowling Rashid (22 off 18) to finish with figures of 4 for 7 and leave England 103 all out with two balls to spare.

In reply, West Indies raced to 50 runs inside nine overs with Brandon King and Hope in the middle.

Rashid made the breakthrough in the 10th over, wrong-footing Hope to set up a stumping for Billings and send the opener back to the shed for 20, but it did nothing to stop West Indies' march to victory.

Scarcely breaking a sweat, King (52 from 49) and Pooran (27 off 29) steered their side home with 17 balls to spare, by no means the big-hitting cricket trademarked by West Indies of old but a confidence-boosting win nonetheless.
