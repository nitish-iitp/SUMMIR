West Indies vs Papua New Guinea ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: Roston Chase pulled off a rescue act at the death as West Indies survived a scare against Papua New Guinea and won by 5 wickets to start their T20 World Cup campaign on a winning note.

Sese Bau top scored for Papua New Guinea with a steady 50 as wickets fell all around him against the West Indies as PNG posted 136/8 in 20 overs. The WI bowlers rattled PNG early when they sent back 2 batters for just 10 with Akeal Hosein cleaning up Lega Siaka and Romario Shepherd taking out Tony Ura. Assad Vala tried to go at the bowlers but he was also dismissed by Alzarri Joseph with PNG losing 3 in powerplay. Joseph ended up with 2 while Andre Russell also picked up 2 wickets.

Rovman Powell won the toss and West Indies will bowl first against Assad Vala’s Papua New Guinea in the T20 World Cup at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Sunday. While the hosts have won the trophy twice before in 2012 and 2016 their opponents if they can spring a surprise in the World Cup would be an achievement in itself.

WI vs PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Ashton Agar's comeback

“What’s happening, mate? Am I the enemy now? I am just trying to help. You are always fighting me,” when Justin Langer, Western Australia’s coach, asked him one day in 2014, Ashton Agar broke down. “I don’t know. I have no idea. I don’t know.”

A game against Tasmania in Hobart. Agar bowled two balls, two good deliveries, but a “deep sadness” welled up in him. After another delivery, he felt a tear breaking out from his eye. He threw away the ball, got his hat from the umpire, walked out of the ground, and started to sob. (READ MORE)

West Indies vs Papua New Guinea Live Score: How Jofra Archer rediscovered his 90 MPH: strolls on Barbados beaches, patient rehab and lots of doggie love

Last week tearway quick Jofra Archer dismissed Pakistan’s Azam Khan with his first delivery on return to international cricket after over a year. Chris Jordan, a fellow Barbadian who also plays for England, said he got goosebumps on the field. A 145kmph delivery first up in the T20 International was the perfect way for Archer to announce his return after struggling for three years to find form. Following two stress fractures of the elbow, a stress fracture of the back and two surgeries, Archer was bowling at a scorching pace with the T20 World Cup just around the corner.

“For him to get the first one out the way, it gives goosebumps to see him take that wicket. He’s phenomenal. To be out of international cricket for so long, to touch 90mph and just look like he never left is awesome. And he will keep getting better with games,” Jordan said. (READ MORE)

WI vs PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Kohli on importance of T20 WC in USA

Virat Kohli said that he never thought that he’ll be playing a game of cricket in the United States, acknowledging the T20 World Cup happening there shows how far the sports has grown.

“Honestly I never thought we would be playing cricket in any form in the states (USA), but now it’s a reality. That tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world and the United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first ones on a global scale to accept it, in a way, with the World Cup” Kohli said in a video shared by US Consulate Mumbai on X (formerly Twitter).

“It’s a great start. It’s the ideal way to begin and it’s going to have a huge impact. In starting off, a kind of a domino effect and I hope it carries on for a long period of time,” he added. (READ MORE)

West Indies vs Papua New Guinea Live Score: India no favourites, don’t believe the hype; trust Rohit, he has a plan

That all-too-familiar chant has started ringing – the World T20 Cup is once again coming home, back to its spiritual abode, India. A couple of foreign experts, yet to unpack their luggage after their enriching IPL commentary trip to India, vouch that it will. Even money is being put where the mouth is – the English betting firms call India the favourite.

That old dream is being sold again and shopping carts are getting loaded. The packaging has those old visuals – Tarzan-like MS Dhoni with hair blowing in the wind. They are from the 2007 inaugural Cup in South Africa that India won. To avoid shattering of unreasonable expectations, the hidden fine print needs to be magnified.

Disclaimer: After 2007, Dhoni failed 5 times – 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016. Virat Kohli also returned empty handed and so did Rohit Sharma in the last edition at Australia. Since 2008, the year of the Indian Premier League, the Cup hasn’t come home. (READ MORE)

WI vs PNG ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Live: Cricket in the land of baseball

The year before, the last squares of a baseball diamond were razed away at the local team ground in Dallas, Texas. The expanse that once overlooked the compound of the iconic aerospace firm, Vought, was home to Texas AirHogs that shut during the pandemic when debts mounted.

But from the ruins of a baseball stadium sprung a cricket venue, rechristened the Grand Prairie Stadium. In a year’s time, it became the home of Major League Franchise, Texas Super Kings, after a 20 million dollar redevelopment program. The baseball-to-cricket symbolism is complete when this Sunday it hosts the World Cup opener between the hosts and Canada, incidentally the oldest recorded international cricket game. A match between the two countries was played in 1844 at Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan, now submerged beneath the pillars of the fabled skyscrapers that pierce into the skyline. (READ MORE)

T20 World Cup rewrite: India unpredictable, Pakistan not unpredictable, England likeable, Kiwis chokers

From unpredictable India to not unpredictable Pakistan, the T20 format throws quite some adjectives into fray for its protagonists. (Reuters)

The T20 format routinely subverts stereotypes that followers of this sport have historically lumped upon national teams. The game and the teams need a fresh look as the T20 World Cup moves out of conventional cricketing boundaries. With the USA playing and hosting cricket, not baseball, change is in the air. A disclaimer before the June 2-29 event: When it comes to describing a team, the usual adjectives just don’t apply. (Read more from Shivani Naik)
