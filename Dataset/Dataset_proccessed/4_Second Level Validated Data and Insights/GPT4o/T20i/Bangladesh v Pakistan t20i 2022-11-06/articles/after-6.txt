Pakistan captain Babar Azam: "The pitch is not easy to bat on. It was a little bit two-paced. Me and Mohammad Rizwan decided to go long but unfortunately we didn't go much further. But it was good to see Muhammad Haris show some aggression.

"We enjoyed the [Netherlands] win. But we are sticking together now. We will get together and discuss our mistakes but also positive things. We are looking forward to the semi-finals. The team and staff are excited."

'We could've done better'

Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan: "Of course at the halfway stage we wanted to get somewhere between 145 runs. That would've been more reasonable. The second overs were really difficult.

"We knew it would be difficult for the new batsman to get going on the wickets and it was important for the set batsmen to stay in the wicket but that didn't happen.

"This is the best performance we had in a T20 World Cup. We could've done better but having said that this is the least we could expect.

"I'll try to play for Bangladesh as much as possible. As long as I'm fit and contributing I would love to play."

So, after the first two matches of the day this is how things stand.

South Africa are out after their shock defeat to the Netherlands, which also means India are through.

If India beat Zimbabwe then India will face England in a semi-final at the Adelaide Oval and Pakistan will face New Zealand at the SCG on Wednesday.

If Zimbabwe beat India then England will play Pakistan on Thursday and it will be India v New Zealand on Wednesday.

What an incredible turnaround for Pakistan.

They began the Super 12s with back-to-back defeats but now find themselves in the semi-finals. Amazing.

They are actually top of Group 2 as it stands, though India can win the group if they beat Zimbabwe later this morning.

It is victory for Pakistan!

You can see what it means to them hugging each other in the dug out. A place in the semi finals.

The game goes on. Trying to finish in style but it's straight into the hands of the fielder.

Oh dear.

Pakistan only need two to win but Iftikhar Ahmed has gone for an ugly heave the flies into the air and Najmul Hossain Shanto takes a smart catch.

What is going on here? Pakistan think about a quick single. Two Bangladesh fielders collide. When the throw eventually goes in it smacks on umpire Joel Wilson's backside.

Wilson has a smile on his face though so I think he is ok.

Pakistan four from victory.
