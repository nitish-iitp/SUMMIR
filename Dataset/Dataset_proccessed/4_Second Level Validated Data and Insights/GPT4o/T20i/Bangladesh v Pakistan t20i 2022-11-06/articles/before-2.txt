21-year-old young batsman Mohammad Haris also scored 28 runs in 11 balls in an explosive manner, but Pakistan's batting is still a matter of concern for him. This tournament has been like a nightmare for Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam.

Pakistan's star bowler Shaheen Afridi is back in form as he took 3 wickets for 14 runs in 3 overs against South Africa. Shadab Khan has so far taken 8 wickets for Pakistan in the T20 World Cup 2022. 

Mohammad Wasim has 7 wickets in his name in 3 matches, but experienced fast bowler Haris Rauf has proved to be a bit expensive. In the previous match, Haris had conceded 44 runs at an economy of 14.67.

In Group B, Bangladesh is in the fourth position with 4 points. In their previous match, Bangladesh could have made a big upset by defeating the Indian team, but they failed to do so. 

However, in the match, the team's star batsman Litton Das created panic by scoring 60 runs in just 27 balls. Wicket-keeper batsman Nurul Hasan also scored 25 runs in 14 balls, but the rest of the team's batsmen flopped badly.

In the T20 World Cup 2022, Bangladesh's bowlers performed better than the batsmen. Taskin Ahmed has taken 8 wickets in 4 matches at an economy of 7. 

At the same time, Hasan Mahmood has also taken six wickets. All the bowlers of the team have achieved success, but during this time the bowlers have also been hit a lot.
