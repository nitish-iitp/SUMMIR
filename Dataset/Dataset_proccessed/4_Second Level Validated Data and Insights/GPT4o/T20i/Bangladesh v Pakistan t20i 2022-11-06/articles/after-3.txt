Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan has said his team could have done better after being eliminated from the ongoing ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Bangladesh lost to Pakistan by 5 wickets at the Adelaide Oval in the Super-12 stage of the tournament.

Speaking after the match, Shakib said this was the team’s best performance in the T20 World Cup but they could’ve done better.

“In terms of results, this is the best performance we had in T20 World Cups. Could've done better. But having said that, with the new guys coming in, with the changes, this is the best we could expect,” said Shakib.

The Bangladesh skipper continued on to say that 145-`5- would have been a reasonable total on the Adelaide pitch.

“At the halfway stage we were 70/1. Wanted to get somewhere around 145-150 - would've been a reasonable total on that pitch. Knew it was going to be difficult for the new batters so wanted set batters to carry through to the end which didn't happen,” Shakib added.

Speaking about his own performance, he said he would like to carry on playing as long as he is fit and performing.

“ I could've done better. As long as I'm fit and performing, I'd love to play,” said Shakib.

Pakistan have now joined India in the 2022 T20 World Cup semi-finals from Super-12 Group-2 after defeating Bangladesh by five wickets at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday.

Pakistan got a golden opportunity to make it to the last-four stage after South Africa choked in front of a spirited Netherlands at the same venue ahead of the clash between Pakistan and Bangladesh. For Babar Azam-led Pakistan, it will be their second consecutive semi-final appearance.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh finished second from bottom in Group-2, with 4 points from 5 matches.
