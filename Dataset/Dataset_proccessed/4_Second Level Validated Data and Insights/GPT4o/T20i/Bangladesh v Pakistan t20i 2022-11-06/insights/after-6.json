    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Pakistan captain Babar Azam: 'The pitch is not easy to bat on. It was a little bit two-paced. Me and Mohammad Rizwan decided to go long but unfortunately we didn't go much further. But it was good to see Muhammad Haris show some aggression. We enjoyed the [Netherlands] win. But we are sticking together now. We will get together and discuss our mistakes but also positive things. We are looking forward to the semi-finals. The team and staff are excited.'",
        "Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan: 'Of course at the halfway stage we wanted to get somewhere between 145 runs. That would've been more reasonable. The second overs were really difficult. We knew it would be difficult for the new batsman to get going on the wickets and it was important for the set batsmen to stay in the wicket but that didn't happen. This is the best performance we had in a T20 World Cup. We could've done better but having said that this is the least we could expect. I'll try to play for Bangladesh as much as possible. As long as I'm fit and contributing I would love to play.'",
        "Player of the match Shaheen Shah Afridi: 'It's not easy to come back after injury and bowl I am just trying to bowl my best. We all as a team are really happy and we played really good cricket. Today we were just in the right areas and bowled fast. I think the team needed to bowl well and we are looking forward to the semi finals and finals.'"
