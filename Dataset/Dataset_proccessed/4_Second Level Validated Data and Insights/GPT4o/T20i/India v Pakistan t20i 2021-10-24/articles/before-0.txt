India will lock horns against their arch-rivals Pakistan at Dubai International Cricket Stadium in the ICC T20 World Cup on Sunday. India vs Pakistan game is always a high-pressure game, as all players carry the burden of their respective nation’s hopes on their shoulders. So far in the ICC World cup, India has an undefeated streak against Pakistan. The two teams last met in the group stages of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, with India convincingly defeating Pakistan.

Both teams come into the match with decent practice under their belt, having played two practice matches each. India won both their warm-up matches, beating England and Australia. Pakistan, on the other hand, defeated West Indies by seven wickets and lost to South Africa. Both the teams have the lethal bowling attack in T20 cricket. So, it will be interesting to see who dominates in Sunday’s clash in Dubai.

Match Details

Match: India vs Pakistan
Date: 24th October 2021
Time: 19:30 IST | 14:00 GMT | 20:00 local

Pitch Report

The pitch in Dubai has been excellent for batting. But in the last few IPL matches, the track is slowing down slightly as the game progresses. In the recently concluded IPL, nine out of 12 matches have been won by the chasing teams. But, it’s a high-pressure game so batting first will not be a bad option.

Avg first innings score: 168

Record of chasing teams: Won – 9, Lost – 3, Tied – 0

Head-to-Head (in ICC T20 World Cup)

India – 5

Pakistan – 0

India: KL Rahul, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli (c), Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Ravichandran Ashwin/Varun Chakravarthy, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Shami

Pakistan: Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Babar Azam (c), Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Asif Ali, Hasan Ali, Shadab Khan, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf
