        "Critics of Charles's current performance points have merit. That said tonight's match is his rubber: He has to survive the 1st 6 overs and give Windies a start irrespective of his score. Windies need to be at min 45 for 1 max after 6. If Charles and or the top 3 does this then Charles stays for rest of tournament. If Windies are 35 for 3 or worse after 6 and Charles is out then he goes for rest of tournament"
