NEW DELHI: In their final group stage match of the T20 World Cup in Gros Islet in Saint Lucia, hosts West Indies and a much-improved Afghanistan will engage in a battle of one-upmanship and try to build momentum for the Super Eight stage.
Following a spirited victory over Papua New Guinea, the West Indies are gradually settling into a routine. New Zealand and Uganda were dismissed.
Afghanistan, however, has thus far had a perfect campaign.
The Caribbean pitches are providing favorable circumstances for Rashid Khan and company.
The only thing on the line in the last Group C matchup-both teams having advanced to the Super Eights-is momentum.

"Momentum is a very important word for us it's important for us to keep playing good cricket and consistent cricket," West Indies skipper Rovman Powell said on the eve of the game, according to PTI.
"After this game the Super 8 is very, very important so you want players going into the Super 8 with good performances, you want to go in the Super 8 as a team winning."
It is a fair indication of their excellent performance in this ICC extravaganza that opener Rahamanullah Gurbaz (167 runs) and pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi (12 wickets) are presently dominating the charts for run-makers and wicket-takers, respectively.

In addition to Gurbaz, veteran Ibrahim Zadran has contributed significantly as well, amassing 114 runs with a best score of 70. However, against left-arm spinners Akeal Hosein and Gudakesh Motie, the Afghans, who have a wealth of right-handed batsmen, will have their work cut out for them.
Mujeeb Ur Rahman, an off-spinner for the Afghans, will not be playing in the competition because of a finger injury. With players like youthful Noor Ahmad and captain Rashid in their ranks who bowled well against Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, they do not lack spinners though.
"It's been three good games but realising there's a lot more than three games to go obviously tomorrow and then three more in the group stage and hopefully beyond," Afghanistan head coach Jonathan Trott said.
"That's the focus but we're not worried about looking too far ahead the focus obviously the main goal is to go as far as we can and achieve things that no other Afghanistan team has done before.
"And we've taken a step in the right direction so far, but that's all it is. There's a lot more cricket ahead and a lot of good teams to play against," he added.
The pitch at the Darren Sammy National Stadium is among the greatest in the USA and the Caribbean.
Both of the matches played here thus far have been high-scoring games, with Sri Lanka amassing a score of more than 200 on Sunday. The ball is coming off the bat wonderfully.
The conditions will be welcomed by the colorful West Indies hitters who are looking to score some huge runs. The skipper conceded that the home hitters had not yet established a rhythm.
"All of us as batters, have had a very subtle start to the World Cup, but tomorrow presents an opportunity here at the Daren Sammy Stadium for us as batters to get it right - it's also a better opportunity on a better wicket," Powell said.
Teams (from):
West Indies: Rovman Powell (c), Brandon King, Johnson Charles, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Andre Russell, Romario Shepherd, Roston Chase, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Obed McCoy, Shamar Joseph, Shimron Hetmyer and Shai Hope
