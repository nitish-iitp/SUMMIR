IND vs BAN Dream11 Prediction Team & Fantasy Tips

The 35th match of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 will see India (IND) take on Bangladesh (BAN) at the Adelaide Oval in Adelaide on Wednesday, November 2. Ahead of the match, here's everything you need to know about the IND vs BAN Dream11 prediction.

Both India and Bangladesh have won two out of three matches in the T20 World Cup. Bangladesh have managed to eke out wins against Zimbabwe and the Netherlands but will be keen to beat their neighbors. Although India come into the game on the back of a disappointing loss to South Africa, they have looked good as a unit with the duo of Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav standing out with the bat.

Although they will start as the favorites, Rohit Sharma and Co. will be wary of what Bangladesh are capable of doing. All in all, a cracking game beckons with both teams eyeing the all-important win at the Adelaide Oval.

IND vs BAN pitch report for ICC T20 World Cup 2022, Match 35

A relatively high-scoring game is expected at the Adelaide Oval with the average score being 161. The dimensions of the ground should play into the hands of the bowlers, who should get some help off the surface as well.
