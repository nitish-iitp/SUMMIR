India will try to find winning ways when they will face Bangladesh in an important fixture of Group B on Wednesday, November 2.

The Indian team had to face defeat by 5 wickets against South Africa in their last match and is at the number 2 spot in the points table. 

Suryakumar Yadav scored 68 runs in this match, but the rest of the team's batsmen galloped early. 

In this tournament so far, Virat Kohli's bat has scored the most runs for the team. Kohli has got 156 runs in 3 matches which include two half-centuries, while Suryakumar Yadav has also scored 134 runs with two fiftes. 

Opener KL Rahul has been seen in a very poor form which is a topic of concern for the team management and the Indian think tank. Rahul has scored just 22 runs in three matches at an average of 7.33.

Talking about Indian bowlers, Arshdeep Singh has taken two wickets in the last match, while Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya, and Ravichandran Ashwin also took a wicket each, but veteran spinner R. Ashwin proved to be very expensive. 

Ashwin had conceded 43 runs in four overs which resulted in the Indian team a loss against South Africa. Left-arm young pacer Arshdeep Singh has taken seven wickets in the tournament so far and has bowled impressively well.

Bangladesh won the previous match against Zimbabwe by 3 runs where Nazmul Hossain played brilliant innings of 71 runs in this match, but Bangladesh's batsmen have not performed very well in the tournament so far. 

Nazmul Hossain, the hero of the last match, has scored a total of 105 runs in three matches. The team's star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has scored a total of 31 runs in the tournament, while Soumya Sarkar (29) and Liton Das (57) have also not done well.

The performance of the bowlers of the team has been much better than the batsmen. Taskin Ahmed has so far taken 8 wickets, while other bowlers have also achieved success. 

In the last match, Taskin had taken three wickets, Mossadden two and Mustafizur Rahman had taken two wickets.
