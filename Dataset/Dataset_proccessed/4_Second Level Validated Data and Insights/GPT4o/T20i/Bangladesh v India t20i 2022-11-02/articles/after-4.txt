In Short
Bangladesh lost to India by 5 runs (DLS Method) on Wednesday
Liton Das scored 60 runs off 27 balls for the Tigers
Bangladesh failed to chase down 151 in 16 overs

Sometimes, it's a moment that defines an entire match and it turns the table once and for all. There’s no turning back from there. Bangladesh wouldn’t disagree, definitely not after their T20 World Cup 2022 match against India at the Adelaide Oval.

Questions have been raised about Bangladesh’s potential to play T20Is, their intent in the shorter formats and depth in both batting and bowling. About intent, it was there right from the word go after Taskin Ahmed bowled at an economy rate of 3.75 and Liton Das threw his bat around to score a 21-ball half-century.

But it was Liton’s run-out that changed the complexion of the match. KL Rahul didn’t have the best of outings in India’s first three games, but found his Midas Touch against the Tigers. Not only did he score a 32-ball 50, but pulled off a direct hit from midwicket to get rid of an ominous-looking Liton.

Liton was batting on 60 at a strike-rate in excess of 200 as Bangladesh were coasting towards the target of 185 set by India. During the rain break it seemed the Tigers were favourites to win as they were 17 runs above the DLS par score.

With Bangladesh needing 85 off nine overs, the Tigers needed Liton to carry on, but to their dismay, he got out in the second ball after the resumption of play. Das pulled off a full-length dive in a bid to complete two runs, but he was caught miles short of his crease.

From there on, wickets kept on falling and the required run rate kept going up and up. Taskin Ahmed and Nurul Hasan Sohan tried to take the Tigers over the finish line, but Bangladesh ended up losing by five runs. Liton’s run out was the turning point of the match, without a shred of a doubt.

A MS DHONI SPECIAL

Talking of run-outs, let’s go back six years back when a certain MS Dhoni kept his composure under immense pressure. Yet another time, it was a T20 World Cup game and yet again, Bangladesh were chasing a target of 147 and were in a comfortable position at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

After Mushfiqur Rahim hit Hardik Pandya through covers and fine leg for two fours, things seemed to be going downhill very fast for India. With two runs needed off three balls, Mushfiqur threw his hands in jubilation on sensing a historic win for the Tigers at a big stage.

But then, Hardik Pandya removed Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah off consecutive balls. From a position of sheer command, the match was getting out of the hands of the Tigers. With two runs needed off the last ball, Dhoni tactically took the keeping gloves off his right hand.

Shuvagata Hom, who is known as a fierce striker of the cricket leather, was on strike. Pandya bowled one outside the off-stump and Hom threw his bat at it only to miss it.

Dhoni could easily have tried to throw the stumps down, but instead, he took a different step. He sprinted towards the stumps and took the bails off with his hands while non-striker Mustafizur Rahman failed to get his bat into the crease in time.

At a stage when all three results were possible, Dhoni’s presence of mind helped the Men in Blue snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Then it was Dhoni, now it was Rahul, who robbed Bangladesh of two historic wins against India.

Both games turned out to be cliffhangers as Bangladesh fans were on the edge of their sets hoping to see their men come up trumps. But all they went home with was disappointment, agony and despair.

Two matches, two moments of madness and two heartbreaking defeats for Bangladesh.
