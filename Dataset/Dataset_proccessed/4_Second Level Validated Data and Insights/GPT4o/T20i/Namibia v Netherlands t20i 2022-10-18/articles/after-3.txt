Another day of exciting cricket, with another game left. Sri Lanka face UAE in a must-win match, as we hope you join us for the action there. What if UAE script an upset? What if Sri Lanka win by a very small margin? It is all to play for in Geelong, as we head off from this thriller. Goodbye and take care!

D Shah: "This means SL have to win their last 2 matches convincingly keeping one eye on the NRR as there are chances both SL and Namibia are stuck on 4 points. "

Scott Edwards, the winning captain: "We did well in terms of front-loading the runs. We knew Namibia had some great bowlers in those conditions. It's well and truly in our hands, but for us, it's just about winning the third game."

Gerhard Erasmus, the Namibia captain: "Never nice to be on the losing side... With the bat it seemed difficult for both sides. They ran better. We tried our best."

Bas de Leede is the Player of the Match: "I took a bit of experience from two days ago. Some of the guys will be bitter that I am scooping up wickets at the end! We lost wickets at bad times, and looking forward to Sri Lanka. We can learn from that as a team. The self-belief has always been there. It's nice to get two tight games go your way."

Mark: "Namibia may now have to rely on The Netherlands beating Sri Lanka to qualify. Barring surprises, we would expect the three teams all to end on 2 wins and NRR to be decisive."

Bas de Leede could have hardly had a better day: 2 for 18 with the ball, and an unbeaten 30 in a tight, successful chase. Netherlands have managed to get two close games their way, putting Sri Lanka under further pressure.

Ganesh: "This is some start to the WC every game throwing up surprises and keeping us on the edge of the seats. Toss not giving undue advantage to one of the sides is the prime reason and of course the big boundaries help as well."

5.13pm A match that swung like a pendulum until the dying moments. Netherlands needlessly made life difficult for themselves, as Namibia sneaked into the contest. Sitting pretty at 92 for 1 in the 14th over, there was no way this game would have gone so deep; and in the end, it was a matter of a few runs or a few balls here and there.

19.3
2
Wiese to de Leede, 2 runs

Is that it for Netherlands!? Yes, Pringle makes it back at the bowler's end, as the throw is wide. Netherlands move closer to a Super 12s spot! A near yorker length ball on off, as de Leede backed away and jammed that back to long-on, where Shikongo was placed a fair distance away. The two batters sprinted, and bagged the two runs

19.2
•
Wiese to de Leede, no run

Bowls a short ball, and gets away with it. First bouncer called. Bangs it in short outside off, with de Leede standing across off. He shaped to pull, but gave up citing the extra bounce

Just 2 from 5...

19.1
4
Wiese to de Leede, FOUR runs

Swatted over mid-off! The fielder there turned back and dived right near the rope, but all in vain. Good length on off, as he made room and send that flinging off the bottom of the bat

6 required off 6. Who is betting on whom here? Maybe a Super Over too?

Umar: "So, who is the Namibian Shami?"

Massive ball coming up...

1
Smit to de Leede, 1 run

Gets across and deep in the crease, and swings at this full ball angling into him. Single to deep midwicket

18.4
1
Smit to Pringle, 1 run

Pringle dives for life, and smashes the stumps at the bowler's end! A quick poke to mid-off off a fullish length on off, and they set off immediately. Direct hit, and he was gone

18.3
2
Smit to Pringle, 2 runs

Just over a leaping midwicket! The man from long-on sprints across to his right there. Full and slower ball on middle and off, and clipped from deep in the crease

Celine: "I love this 'never say die' attitude of Namibia!"

18.2
1
Smit to de Leede, 1 run

Full and a bit wide of off. He gets across and leans into a push to deep point

Mid-off inside the circle, with midwicket and mid-on back

18.1
1
Smit to Pringle, 1 run

Misfield at midwicket, and that allows a crucial single. The fielder there slid to his left, but alas. Good length ball on middle, and nudged away

14 off 12. Smit replaces Frylinck.

1
Wiese to Pringle, 1 run

This is good running again. A late stab to cover off a fullish length on off, as he stands on leg stump while playing at that

Ravi: "Anyone here for a super over?" --- Sshhhh....

17.5
1
Wiese to de Leede, 1 run

Bowls a dipping full toss around his knee on middle stump. It was angling in, and was flicked to deep midwicket

Now five men out on the boundary

17.4
2
Wiese to de Leede, 2 runs

Very good running. This is on a back of a length outside off, as he gets across and clips towards deep midwicket for a sharp two

17.3
1
Wiese to Pringle, 1 run

A lame push to deep third. He waits for the fullish ball outside off, and ends up toe-ending it

17.2
•
Wiese to Pringle, no run

Good length delivery, shaping to angle in from off stump. Tapped down

Five men inside the circle, as Namibia attack

17.1
1
Wiese to de Leede, 1 run

Starts with a slower ball himself. This is an offcutter, and a bit wide of off. de Leede walks down, and leans into a push to deep point

Wiese returns, with a bandaged head, a result of his tumble while fielding today

20 from 18. Required rate above six now.

•
Frylinck to Pringle, no run

A wicket maiden! Perhaps the sixth slower ball this over, as this one is full on off, with Pringle dabbing it down after letting it come on

16.5
•
Frylinck to Pringle, no run

Woah, this is great bowling. This time Frylinck bowls short and wide of off, and continues with the lack of pace. Pringle has a slash away from his body, and is beaten

Pringle in, trying to arrest this collapse

16.4
W
Frylinck to Edwards, OUT

Gone, chipped to short cover! Namibia on a roll in the death overs. This was almost on its way, with Edwards struggling to keep up with the slower deliveries. This one was again bowled full and outside off, and with a change of pace. Edwards, almost as if running out of patience, leaned forward only to end up pushing it to the man stationed close in at cover. A soft dismissal in the end, as he even lost his bottom hand

Scott Edwards c Loftie-Eaton b Frylinck 1 (5b 0x4 0x6 5m) SR: 20
16.3
•
Frylinck to Edwards, no run

Almost chopped on! Edwards waits and waits for the slower ball, which finally arrives on a full length outside off, and angles away. He has a jab, but gets a bottom edge

16.2
•
Frylinck to Edwards, no run

Another dot ball. This was poked to point, as there was a change of pace on a fuller length outside off
