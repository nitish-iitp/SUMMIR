In Short
Netherlands have won back to back games against UAE and Namibia
The team will play their final outing against Sri Lanka in the group stage
The win places Netherlands at the very top of their group

Netherlands have put themselves in the prime position to reach the Super-12 stages of the 2022 T20 World Cup. The Scott Edwards-led team defeated Namibia on Tuesday, October 18 to win back to back games in their Group A, which put them two points clear of their opponent. Namibia on the other hand, had come into the game after beating Sri Lanka and were expected to have the advantage in the tie. However, that was not the case as Netherlands moved past the African nation in the final over in a game that shifted momentum.

"We did well in terms of front-loading the runs. We knew Namibia had some great bowlers in those conditions. It's well and truly in our hands, but for us, it's just about winning the third game," said Netherlands captain Scott Edwards at the post match presentation.

All rounder Bas de Leede was adjudged the man of the match for his two wickets and his fighting 30 off 30 balls.

I took a bit of experience from two days ago. Some of the guys will be bitter that I am scooping up wickets at the end! We lost wickets at bad times, and looking forward to Sri Lanka. We can learn from that as a team. The self-belief has always been there. It's nice to get two tight games go your way," said Bas de Leede after the match.

Barring Leede, openers Vikramjeet Singh and Max O'Dowd gave a good start to their team, setting the team up well for a win. However, as Namibians do in most of their matches, they fought on and kept the pressure on the opposition till the last over of the game, but eventually the game went out of their hands.
