That's all from our side from this game. See you soon.

Daryl Mitchell is the Player of the Match: It was nice to contribute to the score and then I think the boys bowled really well. I think Devon batted well and allowed us to build on. For me, it's about trusting my skills and following the process. Not every time it comes off in T20 cricket but it feels nice whenever it does.

Mitchell Santner: I think it was a bit of a shock, how much it spun in the second innings. After lots of runs in the ODI series, it was nice to see the ball turn. I don't think we were ever safe [even after posting 176]. Daryl Mitchell batted really batted well. At the toss, we were thinking to bowl because it was dewy from the start but it never really got worse. The newer and harder ball was spinning a lot in the powerplay.

Hardik Pandya: No one thought this wicket would play like that, both teams got surprised but New Zealand played better cricket. The new ball was turning more than the old ball. The way it turned and bounced surprised us but till me and Surya were batting, we thought we would pull it off. In hindsight, we ended up giving 25 runs more than the par. The way Washington bowled, batted and fielded, it was more like Washington against New Zealand than India against New Zealand. If he and Axar can continue the way they are, it will help the Indian cricket a lot.

Time for the presentation ceremony.

Michael Bracewell: It got a little bit moist towards the end but otherwise there wasn't too much dew. "Disappointing one-day series, so it's good to bounce back. It's a short three-match series, good to go into the next game with a little bit of momentum.

10.29pm New Zealand finally register their first win on the tour and take 1-0 lead in the three-match T20I series. At one stage during the first innings, it looked like India would restrict them to 150-odd but Daryl Mitchell changed the game with a 27-run 20th over, bowled by Arshdeep Singh. That meant New Zealand posted an above-par 176. India didn't have a great start, losing their top three inside the powerplay. Hardik and Surya staged a mini-recovery but once the duo departed, Washington Sundar and Deepak Hooda couldn't keep up with the climbing asking rate. Santner was the pick of the bowlers, bowling a maiden to Surya and finishing with figures of 2 for 11 from his four overs.
