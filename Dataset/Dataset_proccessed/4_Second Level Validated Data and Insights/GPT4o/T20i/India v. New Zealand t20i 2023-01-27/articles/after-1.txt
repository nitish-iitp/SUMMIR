India pacer Arshdeep Singh conceded 27 runs in the final over of the first innings in the 1st T20I match against New Zealand on Friday, 27 January. Arshdeep, was taken apart by New Zealand batter Daryl Mitchell, who hit him for three sixes in the first three balls of the over. Arshdeep was also guilty of bowling a no-ball in the over, a trend that has continued from the previous series.

In contrast to Arshdeep, Indian spinners found grip and turn in the surface at Ranchi, and exploited the weakness of the Kiwi batters. Washington Sundar was the pick among the bowlers, picking up 2 wickets for just 22 runs from his four overs.

Former India player Sanjay Bangar spoke on the issue and said that one has to give credit to Daryl Mitchell for New Zealand's late hitting in the game.

"At the start, India were too full, searching for the swing which was not there and then there were a lot of hit me deliveries. But towards the end you have to give credit to Daryl Mitchell because some of the shots were brilliant in terms of position," Bangar said to the host broadcaster.

Bangar also said that one has to give credit to the Indian captain for using the spinners so well.

"Credit to Hardik Pandya to bring finger spin that early in the powerplay which allowed Washington Sundar to grip the ball and extract spin from the surface," Bangar said during the mid innings break.

At the time of writing, India were in trouble in the first 6 overs, losing 3 wickets for 33 runs.
