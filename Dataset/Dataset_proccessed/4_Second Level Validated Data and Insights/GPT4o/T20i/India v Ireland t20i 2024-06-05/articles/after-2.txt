Goodbye for now

That’s it from our live coverage of India against Ireland at the T20 World Cup.

Rohit Sharma’s 50 leads India to an eight-wicket win, but his shoulder injury, which forced the Indian skipper to retire hurt, will be a concern.

Ireland will lick their wounds following their dismissal for 96.

They go again on Friday against Canada in Dallas, the day before the big one – India vs Pakistan – back here in New York.

Do join us for Pakistan’s opening match on Thursday if you can.

For now, though – from me, Kevin Hand – it’s goodbye.

Rohit says India must prepare for Pakistan on this surface

The pitch was once again the focal point for the match and India will face Pakistan at the same venue on June 9.

That means the pace of Shaheen Shah Afridi for Pakistan and the pace of Jasprit Bumrah and co for India.

It could be a bruising encounter for the batters.

“I don’t know what to expect from the pitch, to be honest. But we will prepare as if the conditions will be like [today],” said India captain Rohit Sharma.

“So we need to regroup and know what each one of us needs to do. It will be the kind of match where all 11 of us need to come together.

“It was good to spend some time in the middle, but it was scratchy. Good to understand what shots to play on there [the pitch], though.”

India captain Rohit Sharma discusses his injury

“It’s just a little sore,” he told the post-match ceremony after retiring hurt following a blow to the shoulder.

“We were quite unsure of what to expect from the pitch. It’s a new ground and we were not sure how to play on a pitch that’s only five months old.

“The pitch didn’t settle down when we batted, but to get the two points was very important.

“When there is enough in the pitch you have to think about the basics. Bowl like in a Test match. It was important for these guys to bowl like that. Arshdeep was the only bowler that hasn’t bowled in a Test.

“I don’t think we can play four spinners here [in New York]. When we picked the team we wanted to have the balance. If the conditions are there for the seamers, we wanted the options. As we head into the later part of the tournament, I know spin will come into the equation.”

Ireland captain Paul Stirling share his thoughts

“It was a tough one. The toss played a crucial part, we weren’t up to the challenge and India put us under a lot of pressure,” he said at the post-match ceremony.

“We needed to put a little bit of pressure back on the Indian bowlers but everything we tried went up in the air.

“Their [bowlers’] groupings were outstanding. We have some big games coming up and we can take a lot of information from this pitch before we play here on Friday [against Canada].”

India’s Jasprit Bumrah is Player of the Match

“Coming from India, when you come here and see the ball seaming around and offering pace then I will never complain for the bowlers,” Bumrah told the official ICC broadcast after taking two wickets at an economy of two from his three overs.

“In this format you have to be proactive, you have to adapt to the conditions. We played a practice match here as well. We thought the new ball would do a lot.

“You want to cover all bases, once the seam goes down the pitch settles down so you have to be prepared to bowl in all conditions.”
