India Today News Desk
New York,UPDATED: Jun 5, 2024 23:14 IST
India (IND) vs Ireland (IRE) Ball by Ball Commentary, T20 World Cup 2024: India have won the toss and opted to bowl first against Ireland in their campaign opener. Rohit Sharma's side will look for a dominant start to their tournament.
Hardik Pandya
23:14 IST:
Right then, with India clinching a commanding victory over Ireland and securing those crucial two points, the team now gears up for their next challenge against Pakistan. Meanwhile, Ireland will be focusing on bouncing back strong against Canada in their upcoming game. But the action continues in this ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 as next up is the battle of the two associates Uganda and Papua New Guinea on Thursday, 6th June and the first ball will be bowled at 5 am IST (11.30 pm GMT, the previous day). Following that, Australia will take on Oman, and that game will begin at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). Till then, cheers and take care.
23:13 IST:
The captain of India, Rohit Sharma, says that they were quite unsure of what to expect with it being a new ground and a drop-in pitch, which is why they wanted to bowl first. Feels that it is all about getting used to the conditions quickly. Shares that the wicket did not settle down even in the second half, and there was still something in it for the bowlers. He adds that he is happy to get the two points. States that it is important to stick to the basics and bowl Test match lines on such surfaces. Says that Arshdeep Singh set the tone for them, swinging the ball back into the right-hander. Opines that they want to have the right balance, which is why they have taken 4 spinners in the squad and feels that spin will come into play as we move ahead in the tournament. When asked about what his expectations are regarding the pitch for the game against Pakistan, he replies that they don't know what to expect but will prepare as if the surface will behave the same as it did in this game. Further says that they will regroup and assess what needs to be done. On his knock, he feels that it was a scratchy inning, but he is happy to have spent time out in the middle and was able to know what kind of shots to play on such pitches.
23:03 IST:
Paul Stirling, the skipper of Ireland says it was a tough one and the toss played a crucial part. Says they kept losing wickets in the first innings and the Indian bowlers didn't miss their marks and kept bowling on good lines and lengths. Says they probably weren't up to the challenge. Adds they will be back here at the same venue in a couple of days and ends by saying they will give a good crack against Canada in their next game.
23:14 IST:
Jasprit Bumrah is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliance with the ball. He says that he does not mind seeing the ball seam around and with some pace too. Feels that it is important to be proactive in T20 cricket and have to assess the conditions as quickly as one could. Adds that the new ball was doing something when they played the warm-up game and they tried to use it in this game. Shares that when the seam goes down, it gets easier to bat on such surfaces. End by saying that he is happy with the performance.
22:57 IST:
The presentation ceremony...
22:56 IST:
Earlier in the game, India decided to let Ireland bat first, and it turned out to be a great call for Rohit and his men. The Indian bowlers took full advantage of the pitch, with Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj keeping the Irish batters on their toes. Arshdeep delivered a double whammy within the Powerplay. The conditions for batting were tough, and the Indian bowlers completely decimated the opposition. Hardik Pandya snagged three wickets, while Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh took two each. Mohammed Siraj and Axar Patel chipped in with one wicket apiece. Overall, it was a top-notch performance with the ball as India held Ireland to squeeze them under 100 runs. Gareth Delany and Joshua Little added some crucial runs towards the backend. In the chase, after losing Virat Kohli very early, Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant notched up a brilliant partnership with the former mounting an aggressive fifty and the latter striking a quickfire 36, which helped India to register the first win in the group stage with 8 wickets remaining.
22:59 IST:
Ireland needed early wickets since they didn't have too many runs on the board. With the pitch heavily favoring the bowlers, they asked some tough questions of the Indian batters right from the start. The ball was moving sharply, both in and out. They would've got two early wickets had Andy Balbirnie grabbed that catch of Rohit in the first slip in the very first over. Mark Adair reaped the reward early by claiming the prized wicket of Virat Kohli. But after that, they couldn't manage to get any breakthroughs, and with not much on the board to defend, they were always behind the eight ball. Ben White took a wicket to his name but it was nothing more than a consolation.
22:51 IST:
RISHABH PANT FINISHES OFF IN STYLE IN AN AUDACIOUS MANNER!!! India register their first win and commence their T20 World Cup journey by decimating Ireland with a dominating win. Chasing a modest target of 97, the Indian batters initially struggled with the variable and unpredictable bounce. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli found it tough going at the start, with the pitch playing tricks. Kohli tried to go on the attack but was dismissed for just 1. Rohit, after a cautious start, settled in and hit a couple of quick boundaries. Rohit along with Rishabh Pant then stitched a good partnership and both cautiously negotiated the tricky conditions. Both played percentage cricket, capitalizing on the loose deliveries without taking unnecessary risks. Rohit then unleashed his trademark pull shots, sending two balls sailing into the stands and also notching up the 50, opening the floodgates before retiring out. SKY got out cheaply as well but the required run rate was never a worry for India. Rishabh Pant propelled India to their first win of this T20 World Cup with that brilliant six in the end.
22:48 IST:
12.2: Barry McCarthy to Rishabh Pant, SIX! OUTRAGEOUS FROM RISHABH PANT! A contender for the shot of the tournament! Shades of Pant's six against James Anderson during the Ahmedabad Test in 2021. Barry McCarthy bowls it on a length, on off, Rishabh Pant premeditates and brings out the reverse lap. Executes it to perfection as he gets it over the keeper and clears the fence with ease. Barry McCarthy is left bewildered. India win by 8 wickets!
22:47 IST:
12.1: Barry McCarthy to Rishabh Pant, Hits the deck hard, on off, Rishabh Pant looks to stab it down the deck. The ball takes off the deck and hits Pant on the left forearm. Pant has copped a lot of blows during his stay at the crease.

21:45 IST:
Welcome back for India's reply. The two umpires make their way out to the centre followed by Paul Stirling and his men. A huge roar from the crowd as Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli walk out to open the innings for India. It will be Mark Adair to kickstart proceedings with the new ball for Ireland. Two slips in place to start with. Away we go...
21:42 IST:
... THE RUN CHASE ...
21:45 IST:
Right then, India need only 97 runs from their 20 overs to get their campaign off to a winning start. With no Yashasvi Jaiswal in the side, in all likelihood, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will walk out to open the innings for the first time in Indian colours since 2021. It will be interesting to see how they go about their business early on. As for Ireland, they will have to ensure that they hit the right areas consistently with the new ball and make India work hard for every run. Back in a bit for the chase.
21:37 IST:
Hardik Pandya is in for a chat. He says it's always special to play for the country and he always takes pride and tries to give his 100 percent. Adds that he has been able to contribute in bigger competitions like the World Cup and it went well for him. He adds that he really liked the first wicket and says that he tends to bowl on hard lengths. Reckons that he had to bowl a bit more fuller on this particular track. Says that you need to just bowl in the right areas and bowl with discipline and they did pretty well as a bowling unit. Ends up by saying that the crowd always comes in large wherever they play and it's good to have such immense support.
21:41 IST:
As the scoreboard suggests, there is not much to write about home about the Irish batting effort. Yes, the pitch has not been the batter's friend, but not many Irish batters were prepared to bide their time and could have applied themselves a lot better. Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie were dismissed inside the Powerplay and Ireland could never really get going. Curtis Campher took his chances but his stay was short-lived. Ireland lacked partnerships as they lost wickets at regular intervals and could not adapt to the seam movement and bounce off the deck. The stand between Gareth Delany and Joshua Little gave them a glimmer of hope of going past 100 but it wasn't to be.
21:42 IST:
Sheer dominance from India to skittle Ireland out for just 96! A field day for the Indian pacers, picking out 8 of the 10 wickets to fall. Having opted to bowl first in overcast conditions, Arshdeep Singh set the tone for India, removing both Irish openers early. Mohammed Sirajj may not have succeeded in his opening spell but kept the pressure on from his end. Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya picked up where the new ball pair left off as they consistently hit the right areas and did not allow Ireland any breathing space. Hardik struck thrice to pile the misery and asked the right questions to the Irish batters. It did not take long for Axar Patel to get into the act and although, India faced some resistance from the Irish tail, they were able to wrap the innings under 100.

Hardik bends his back and digs it in short, outside off, Mark Adair sees the width on offer and tries to pounce on it. Backs away and looks to slap it away on the off side. The ball comes onto the bat slower than Adair anticipated and skies it off the toe-end of the bat towards deep point. Shivam Dube runs in off the ropes and takes the simplest of catches. Having taken a wicket off the final ball off his last over, Hardik is on a hat-trick now.
21:00 IST:
Drinks break! India have absolutely bossed this game so far and have Ireland in dire straits. Rohit Sharma has persisted with pacers and will look to stick to them to wrap up the innings quickly. To be fair to Ireland, India have been relentess and the Irish found it extremely hard to adapt to the bounce and seam movement off the deck. The bowlers haven't just provided any breathing space to the opposition batters. None of the Irish batters has looked comfortable and fairly, the pitch is not the easiest of the tracks to bat on. With 6 down under 50, Ireland will look to stitch a good partnership from here on and bat till the end. While India will look to wrap things up as quickly as possible.
