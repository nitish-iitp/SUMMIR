New York, USA – Ireland Men suffered an eight-wicket defeat at the hands of India in their first match of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in New York on Wednesday.

It was a disappointing opening to the tournament for the Irish, who set India a target of just 98 for victory on a pitch that caused batters on both teams all sorts of problems.

Despite the lively nature of the wicket, it was a first innings total which the Indians knocked off with eight wickets and 46 deliveries to spare.

At the start of play, a feverish New York crowd of 20,604 – the biggest in US cricketing history – welcomed the Ireland team to the middle after India captain Rohit Sharma called correctly at the toss and elected to field first.

Sharma’s decision quickly reaped the early reward of Paul Stirling’s wicket, the Irish skipper caught from the bowling of Arshdeep Singh off the first ball of the third over for just two.

Arshdeep then made sure his second set of six was bookended by wickets when he bowled Stirling’s fellow opener, Andrew Balbirnie, with the final delivery of the over.

That left Ireland 9-2 as India immediately showcased why they are the world’s No.1 ranked T20I side and among the favourites to win the competition.

Their seam attack was unrelenting as Mohammed Siraj (1-13), Jasprit Bumrah (2-6), Hardik Pandya (3-27) and Axar Patel (1-3) picked up where Singh (2-35) left off.

A 27-run partnership from Gareth Delany (26) and Josh Little (14) gave Ireland late hope of a competitive total, with the former’s innings coming from just 14 balls, including two fours and two sixes.

Heinrich Malan’s side were eventually dismissed for 97 after 16 overs, though, posting a below-par total, even on a heavily bowler-friendly surface.

Ireland took to the field knowing they required early wickets if they were to pull off a remarkable victory and Mark Adair duly delivered with the major scalp of Virat Kohli for just one.

It didn’t spark a turnaround of fortune, however, as Sharma – who survived a sharp catch at second slip early on in his innings – bludgeoned 52 from 37 balls before retiring hurt with just 21 runs required.

Ben White removed Suryakumar Yadav late on but Rishabh Pant’s unbeaten 36 saw India home in style, consigning Ireland to defeat in their first official assignment of the World Cup.

Ireland’s next fixture in Group A is against Canada on Friday, 7 June at the same ground.
