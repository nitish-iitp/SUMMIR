        "India got the expected winning start in the Super 8 and would like to put one foot in the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024 semis by beating Bangladesh, who must win this game to advance to the semis.",
        "India are one of the only two teams in this World Cup who did not lose a game. Apart from the rain that hit the last match of the group stage against Canada, they won every single game of theirs.",
        "India\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024 journey has been a strange one. They do not have any batter who features in the top 15 run-scorers of the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024, which is not usual.",
        "Playing all the group games on the tricky surfaces of New York and Florida had an impact on their batting.",
        "India regained form in the much more batting-friendly pitches of West Indies when they scored 180+ against Afghanistan.",
        "India\u2019s bowling attack was spot on and restricted every opponent to a severely low total.",
        "Bangladesh also found the same relief from their bowling unit which has been rather brilliant so far. Both Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Rishad Hossain have picked 9 wickets each. Apart from that, Mustafizur Rahman has also picked up 7 wickets.",
        "Bangladesh\u2019s batting is out of form at this moment. It seems like they just cannot find a way to click at this point.",
        "Bangladesh ended up scoring only 140 on a pitch which was brilliant to bat on.",
        "India can rely on their batting now after scoring 181 against a solid Afghanistan bowling attack. Additionally, all of their batters scored at an excellent strike rate except for skipper Rohit Sharma.",
        "India\u2019s highest opening stand is 22 which is quite underwhelming. India would be confident about their openers getting runs but it will be in their minds as well.",
        "India are the favorites in every match in this ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024. They would not want to break their winning streak. The BAN vs IND T20 match in the Super 8 stage might not be different either. However, Bangladesh have a slender hope given their batters' performance."
