Toss - Bangladesh

Bangladesh wins the toss and opts to bowl against India.

Najmul Hossain Shanto: We would like to bowl first. We would like to restrict them to a small total and that is the plan. We know the conditions here and also about the wind factor. Looks a good wicket. 150-160 will be a good score I reckon. We have one change. Taskin is not playing.

Rohit Sharma: We wanted to bat and that’s what we got. Looks like a good wicket and depends on how much the sun is beating down and making the pitch slow. Important to assess the conditions quickly. We are playing the same team.
