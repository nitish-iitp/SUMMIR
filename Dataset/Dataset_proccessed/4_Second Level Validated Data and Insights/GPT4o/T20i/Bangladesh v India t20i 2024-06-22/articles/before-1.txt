T20WC Super 8 | INDvBAN: A high-stakes Asian derby to inch closer to the semis
By Mumbai Indians | 21 JUN, 2024

After a triumphant victory in Barbados, Team India is all set to make a short-distance journey to Antigua, aiming to secure their second win in the Super 8 challenge against Bangladesh on Saturday (June 22). 

The momentum and the head-to-head record (12/1) favour India, who are riding high on a 47-run victory over AFG. The team is now eyeing a fifth consecutive win in T20 World Cup meetings against BAN. Leading the charge are the formidable duo of Rohit Sharma (454 runs) and Yuzvendra Chahal (9 wickets), who are set to maintain their dominance.

Conversely, Bangladesh enter the fray after a 28-run loss by DLS method to Australia. The Tigers finished second in the group stage and now sit rock-bottom on the Group 1 table.

A tantalising fixture awaits at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, where the mighty Indians will look to evenly combat the prowess of Bangladesh’s Towhid Hridoy (231 runs in the last 10 T20Is) and Mustafizur Rahman (20 wickets in the previous 10 T20Is). Indeed, a Super Saturday is on the cards for the Indian cricket fans.

What: India vs Bangladesh

When: Saturday, June 22, 2024, 8 pm IST

Where: Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua

What to look forward to: A testing batting track, Hitman surpassing the 500-run mark in T20Is against Bangladesh, Jasprit Bumrah weaving his magic again, the IND batting championing against the threat of Mustafizur Rahman’s bowling variations and effectively stepping closer to the semis.
