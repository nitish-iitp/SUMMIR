Preview of BAN vs IND Match in ICC World Cup Super 8

India are one of the only two teams in this World Cup who did not lose a game. Apart from the rain that hit the last match of the group stage against Canada, they won every single game of theirs. So far, India’s T20 World Cup 2024 journey has been a strange one. They do not have any batter who features in the top 15 run-scorers of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, which is not usual. Playing all the group games on the tricky surfaces of New York and Florida had an impact on their batting. 

However, they regained form in the much more batting-friendly pitches of West Indies when they scored 180+ against Afghanistan. Moreover, their bowling attack was spot on and restricted every opponent to a severely low total. Thus, they didn’t lose a game even after not scoring much. Especially, their strike bowlers are in tremendous form picking up 18 wickets combined already.

Bangladesh also found the same relief from their bowling unit which has been rather brilliant so far. Both Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Rishad Hossain have picked 9 wickets each. Apart from that, Mustafizur Rahman has also picked up 7 wickets. Nonetheless, their batting is out of form at this moment. It seems like they just cannot find a way to click at this point. 

Bangladesh ended up scoring only 140 on a pitch which was brilliant to bat on. Therefore, it is increasingly seeming hard to see Bangladesh do much in the Super 8 with such miserable batting form.

It is not the case for India who can rely on their batting now after scoring 181 against a solid Afghanistan bowling attack. Additionally, all of their batters scored at an excellent strike rate except for skipper Rohit Sharma. As a result, India will feel confident about facing Bangladeshi bowling attack ahead of the game. One thing that might be a matter of slight concern for them is their opening pair which consists of two of the greatest hitters of the generation but yet not clicking. Their highest opening stand is 22 which is quite underwhelming. India would be confident about their openers getting runs but it will be in their minds as well.

The tie was largely dominated by India where Bangladesh could manage only 1 win against them. India is one of many opponents whom Bangladesh couldn’t beat in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.

Key Players to Watch in India Team
Virat Kohli

Virat Kohli had an unexpectedly poor campaign by his extremely high standards. But he gave symbols of coming back to runs with his 24 against Afghanistan. It can be felt that he will have a big score soon and no opponent would be more suitable than Bangladesh against whom he averages 96.5 in the T20Is

Suryakumar Yadav

With his half-century in the last game, Suryakumar Yadav is surely gaining ground in this ICC Men’s T20 World Cup and might be the most impactful batter against Bangladesh.

Jasprit Bumrah

The ace bowler of India is going to be crucial against Bangladesh, against a struggling top order who find it difficult to deal with raw pace, Jasprit Bumrah will be key to picking early wickets and rattling the top-order of Bangladesh's batting line-up.

Key Players to Watch in  Bangladesh
Tanzim Hasan Sakib

Bangladesh has been largely reliant on their bowlers to get a result in this World Cup. This game is not going to be any different it seems. Therefore, the highest wicket-taker for Bangladesh this time would be the most important player for them in this game as well.

Mustafizur Rahman

Mustafizur Rahman and India go a long way back. He is simply in a different mode while facing India. Bangladesh team need him to step up once again and dominate the Indian batters like he used to do in his early and best days.  

Litton Kumer Das

This might seem a bit controversial given the current situation. But like Mustafizur Rahman, Litton Kumer Das also loves performing against India. Everyone will remember the exceptional innings of 60 runs from him in the 2022 T20 World Cup. In a situation, where big runs are necessary to win and the top order is heavily underperforming, Bangladesh fans will hope for Litton Das to bring that Adelaide innings from the 2022 T20 World Cup at Antigua this time.

Verdict

India are the favorites in every match in this ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. They would not want to break their winning streak. The BAN vs IND T20 match in the Super 8 stage might not be different either. However, Bangladesh have a slender hope given their batters' performance.
