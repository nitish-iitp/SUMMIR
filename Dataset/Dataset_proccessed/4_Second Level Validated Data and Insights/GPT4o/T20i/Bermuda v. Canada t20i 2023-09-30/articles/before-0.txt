One spot up for grabs for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024
All matches streamed live on tv

Bermuda, Canada, Cayman Islands and Panama will battle it out in a double round-robin format, over six days to earn a place in the 2024 edition of the Men’s T20 World Cup – the biggest one yet, featuring 20 teams in total.

Bermuda will look to continue their good form after winning the Subregional Qualifier, using their home advantage to return to the biggest stage in men’s T20 cricket, after their historical appearance in 2007.

Canada, arguably the favourites of the event, will look to confirm this and seal their ticket to a new World Cup participation.

The Cayman Islands are a regular fixture in the regional final but are yet to go through, they will push hard to make it this time.

Panama will be the underdogs, as their participation may come as a surprise to many, but with no real pressure on their backs, this could allow them to play freely and upset the main candidates.

This event promises to be a competitive affair, with the four teams confident of their chances of making it through to the main stage. 

Fara Gorsi, ICC Regional Development Manager – Americas said: “It is exciting to have the regional final that will determine the region’s last spot in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. This is obviously a special World Cup for us in the Americas, as it will be hosted in our region jointly by the USA & the West Indies”. 

“All four teams have proved to be competitive, and we look forward to a high standard event. The ever-progressing hosts, Bermuda Cricket Board, have worked tirelessly to ensure they deliver a world-class final tournament for the region. A huge thank you and acknowledgement of Calvin Blankendal and his team.”

Calvin Blankendal, CEO of the Bermuda Cricket Board said: “Bermuda is delighted to have the opportunity to host the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier in the island. 

“We are excited to host our first ICC tournament since 2019. We are certain that the event will be second to none, with passion and love for the game that you won’t find easily anywhere else.

“We also believe it is a great opportunity for us to get back to the biggest stage as we aim to participate in the Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024”.
