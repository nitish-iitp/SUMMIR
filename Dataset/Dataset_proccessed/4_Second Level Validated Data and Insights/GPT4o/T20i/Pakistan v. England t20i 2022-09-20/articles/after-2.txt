'New Delhi,UPDATED: Sep 21, 2022 00:02 IST
In Short
Pakistan scored 158 for 7 after being put in to bat first
England won the match to take a 1-0 lead in the 7-match series
Babar and Rizwan put on 85 runs for the opening wicket

Babar Azam, on Thursday, September 20, clearly said that Pakistan batters need to step up and chip in with consistent performances. The Men in Green lost the first of the seven T20Is against England by six wickets at the National Stadium in Karachi.

After being put in to bat first, Pakistan made a decent start courtesy of an 85-run partnership between skipper Babar and Mohammad Rizwan off 9.3 overs. Once the two batters got out, the Pakistan middle-order couldn’t up the ante in the death overs.

Barring Iftikhar Ahmed, who made 28 off 17, the other batters failed to step up as England made a stupendous comeback. Babar mentioned that the Pakistan batters failed to stitch together enough partnerships.

“The way we played the first powerplay was great. After 10 overs, there was a swing of momentum, which you have to credit England for. We didn't have enough big partnerships. Our batters need to step up,” Babar was quoted as saying in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Rizwan scored 68 runs off 46 balls with six fours and one six and also became the joint-fastest to 2000 runs in T20Is. However, his efforts went in vain. Babar, on the other hand, scored 31 runs off 24 balls with three fours before getting out to Adil Rashid.

After being asked to chase down 159, England got past the finishing line with four balls to spare. With three runs to win off the last five balls, Harry Brook hit a four through the cover region to take the Three Lions home.
