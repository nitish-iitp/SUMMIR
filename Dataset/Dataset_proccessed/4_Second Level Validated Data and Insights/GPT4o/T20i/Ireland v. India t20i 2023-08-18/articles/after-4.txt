IND vs IRE Live: Pitch report
This surface is known for pace, bounce and high scoring. Nice covering of grass on this pitch, it will seam around given the overcast conditions. But if batters can get set, they can score runs. The average first innings score is around 170, but you'll need at least 180-85 to be competitive on this surface.
