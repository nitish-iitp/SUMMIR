NEW DELHI: In the first match of the three-match T20I series against Ireland on Friday, Indian batter Rinku Singh and fast bowler Prasidh Krishna were given their T20 International debuts. This is a significant moment for both players as they aim to showcase their skills at the highest level of cricket.
Krishna and India skipper Jasprit Bumrah are making a comeback from injury layoffs, with Bumrah returning after an 11-month layoff.
Despite their time away from the game, both Bumrah and Krishna are determined to make an impact for India.
Krishna, who has already represented India in 14 ODIs, has shown his potential as a wicket-taker with 25 wickets to his name. His impressive average of 23.92 and strike rate of 26.9 make him a valuable asset to the Indian team. This T20I debut gives Krishna the opportunity to prove his versatility and contribute to the team's success in a different format of the game.
