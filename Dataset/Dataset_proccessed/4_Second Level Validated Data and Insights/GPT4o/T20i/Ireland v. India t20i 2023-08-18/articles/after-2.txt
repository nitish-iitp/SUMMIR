India vs Ireland 1st T20I Highlights: Bumrah took two wickets on his return to international cricket after which rain washed out most of the Indian innings. 
India vs Ireland 1st T20I Highlights:

India vs Ireland 1st T20I Highlights: Jasprit Bumrah returned to international cricket with a bang. While he conceded a four off the first ball he bowled, Bumrah got a wicket off the second. He then took another off the fifth ball. India ended up bowling six bowlers in the first 10 overs and they dominated the phase. Ireland were reduced to 59/6 after which Barry McCarthy and Curtis Campher led a fightback for the hosts. The pair put up 57 runs off 44 balls for the seventh wicket before Campher fell for 39 off 33 balls. McCarthy continued the assault, finished the innings off with a six and ended unbeaten on 51 off 33 balls. Ireland thus set India a target of 140 to chase. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad got India off to a flier. While India lost two wickets in the first over after the powerplay rain came in and put an end to the match. India were two runs ahead at the time that the players went back and the tourists have hence taken a 1-0 lead.

India vs Ireland Live score: Match called off, India win by 2 runs (DLS)

So Jasprit Bumrah and Paul Sterling have shook hands in the umpires' presence underneath umbrellas and that is how this match ends. India thus go 1-0 up in the series with the only takeaways really being Bumrah's impressive return to international cricket and McCarthy's brilliant innings that led Ireland's fightback.

Aug 18, 2023 10:32 PM IST
IND vs IRE 1st T20I Live: India 47/2 in 6.5 overs

That is how things stand at the moment in case you have forgotten. The only update right now is that it continues to pour in Malahide and the covers are firmly in place. As it stands, India are 2 runs ahead of the DLS par score and so if there are no more balls bowled in this match, they would win this game.

India vs Ireland 1st T20I Live Cricket Score: Rain getting heavier

Judging by the noises coming from the ground, the game might as well be over. The rain is only getting heavier and chances of it going away any time soon seems minuscule.

Aug 18, 2023 10:05 PM IST
India vs Ireland Live score: More covers coming in

Well rain was forecast and it stayed away all this while but now that it is here, it seems like we will have to entertain it for a while.

IND vs IRE 1st T20I Live: The umpires lead the players off!

Well it had been pouring for quite a few minutes now and the umpires decide that they have had enough. They lead the players off. India are 2 runs ahead of the DLS par score.

Aug 18, 2023 9:53 PM IST
India vs Ireland 1st T20I Live Cricket Score: OUT! Young is on a hat-trick!

Tilak Varma falls first ball! Back of a length delivery down leg from Young, Varma tries to tuck it away, ends up edging it behind where wicketkeeper Tucket takes a brilliant catch diving to his right.

Varma c Tucker b Young 0 (1), India 46/2 in 6.3 overs

Aug 18, 2023 9:51 PM IST
India vs Ireland Live score: GONE! That's it for Jaiswal

Bouncer from Craig Young for his 2nd delivery of the seventh, Jaiswal miscues the pull. It goes high up in the air, captain Sterling calls it and he takes the catch. 

Jaiswal c Stirling b Young 24 (23), India 46/1 in 6.2 overs

Aug 18, 2023 9:48 PM IST
IND vs IRE 1st T20I Live: SIX! India 44/0 in 6 overs

What a way to end the powerplay. Pull shot of some aplomb from Jaiswal to send the ball over the boundary. He movges to 24 off 22, Gaikwad is on 18 off 14 and India are absolutely blazing along at the moment.

Aug 18, 2023 9:42 PM IST
India vs Ireland 1st T20I Live Cricket Score: SIX!  

It had been more than an over since the last boundary and so India needed that. Short down the leg side from McCarthy and Gaikwad sends that over the boundary with a pull. India go above the DLS part score with that shot.

Aug 18, 2023 9:40 PM IST
India vs Ireland Live score: Umbrellas popping open

India are 24/0 in 4 overs. Jaiswal on 13 off 16, Gaikwad on 10 off 11. There is a slight drizzle coming down now and people are opening their umbrellas in the stands.
