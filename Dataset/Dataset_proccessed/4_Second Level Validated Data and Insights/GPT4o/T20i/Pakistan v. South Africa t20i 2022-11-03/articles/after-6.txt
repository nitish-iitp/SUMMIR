Pakistan keeps alive its T20 World Cup dream

With Babar and Rizwan giving away their earlier wickets to Proteas at a crucial match in 2022 T20I World Cup match at Sydney the Iftikhar Ahmed (51) and Shadab Khan (52)'s brilliant knock kept the scorecard flowing like wild wind. This helped Pakistan reach a total of 185, even though it lost 9 wickets in 20 overs.

For Proteas, Anrich Nortje proved himself as the key bowler sending four players to pavilion. All other four bowlers -- Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, and Tabraiz Shamsi cliched a single wicket each.

Similar like Pakistan, South Africa too lost initial wickets and kept lost the momentum. Apart from skipper Temba Bavuma(36), no other player managed to cross 30 runs. And then the runs paralysed the match.

When the match resumed, South Africa were 15 runs behind according to D/L menthod, and as per the new target, they had to score 73 runs from 30 balls.

However, owing to pressure and smacking bowling attack by Pakistan, the Proteas batting order collapsed like a pack of card and they were defeated by Pakistan by 33 runs.

Here's the scorecard:

Shadab Khan 52(22)

SCG - a batting paradise

The surface of the Sydney Cricket Ground often gives batsmen a decent chance to make some quick runs. The pitch might not benefit the pacers much in the early innings, but the spinners might be optimistic about their chances in the middle overs. Chasing would be the best strategy for winning the toss on this surface.
