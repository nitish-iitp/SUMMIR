India vs South Africa, 2nd T20 Highlights: South Africa outclassed India by four wickets in a one-sided second T20 International on Sunday to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.

Anrich Nortje took two wickets while Wayne Parnell and Kagiso Rabada were economical with a wicket each. In reply, Heinrich Klaasen’s superb 81 off 46 balls laced with seven fours and five sixes, made it a walk in the park for the Proteas as they knocked off the runs in 18.2 overs despite Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s fantastic figures of 4 for 13.

Brief Scores:

India 148/6 (Shreyas Iyer 40, Dinesh Karthik 30 not out, Ishan Kishan 34, Anrich Nortje 2/36, Kagiso Rabada 1/15).

Rishabh Pant: We would have bowled first as well. The track is really nice. We would want to have a big score on this. There weren't many things we did wrong in the last game, just a bit of execution was off and we will do better today. We are playing the same team.

Temba Bavuma: We will have a bowl first. We don't know how the wicket will play. It was easier to bat second in the last game. You can chase anything with smaller boundaries. You need to stay in the fight as batters. We have two forced changes; QDK has a hand injury and Stubbs misses out, Klaasen and Hendricks come in.

IND vs SA 2nd T20I Live: Pitch report!

Pitch and Conditions: "The pitch that is being used tonight is right in the center which means the boundary is equal on either side, 65 meters and straight is 74 meters. It has a fair bit of grass but it is dry grass, it will not help the seamers too much. Fair amount of cracks as well but doesn't seem to grip too much as well. It is going to skid through and not much for the spinners. Because of the weather it has a little bit of moisture and can be two-paced. It is quite humid and dew hasn't been there in the last couple of nights. The par score is going to be 160-170," reads Deep Dasgupta.

It was more about battles I won against my own self and lots of other things: Hardik Pandya

As he got down to plot his return to the Indian team, Hardik Pandya would hit the bed at 9.30pm and wake up at 5am, dedicating the day’s intervening period of time to win battles against his “own self” and the doubting Thomases. The star all-rounder followed this time table strictly for four months, after which he guided an unfancied Gujarat Titans to a memorable title triumph in only their maiden IPL outing, leading the debutants from the front to earn an India call-up.

IND vs SA 2nd T20I Live: What to expect

Forecast is for it to go as high as 95 percent, which should drag dew into play. The pitches at Barabati have traditionally been on the slower side irrespective of the format, so the spinners on both teams should do better than Delhi.
