Markram: ‘We are on the right track’

“Last three overs we had a lot against us but the bowlers had good plans and pulled it off,” he said. “Message after the power play was it got slower. If I am greedy. we were 10-20 short especially after the start we got. Not quite played a complete game of cricket but we are on the right track.”

Buttler credits de Kock as the game changer

“Quinton [de Kock] came in with a lot of intent, and we couldn’t quite match that,” Buttler says. “We pulled it back and were happy to chase that target, but his innings was the difference.

“We came back well with the ball. Brook and Livingstone had a fantastic partnership to get us close and even look like favourites but credit to South Africa for closing out the game.”

De Kock: ‘Good effort from us’

“It [the pitch] definitely doesn’t play the same as night games,” he says. “It’s a completely different surface compared to the night games. There was a little bit of extra bounce early on. I try to carry on confidence – game by game.

“We bowled really well in the powerplay, and we controlled it very nicely. To be able to defend 160 on a decent wicket is a good effort from us.”

De Kock wins Man of the Match

De Kock was the only batter to get a read on the surface with a superlative 65 runs in 38 balls. That 21-run over against Archer in the powerplay was key to South Africa’s win. It felt like he was batting on a different surface.

Chokers no more?

Wow. South Africa have been in some ding dong scraps during this tournament. Yet again Rabada crucial in bowling a tight over at just the right time. He pushes the finish line back just enough for others to do the rest.

South Africa’s unbeaten record continues

South Africa held their nerve when Livingstone and Brook seemed to have got England home, with Jansen and Rabada pulling things back with superb 18th and 19th overs. But the game swung on that Markram catch of Brook. The Yorkshireman was the danger-man and his dismissal effectively sealed the game for South Africa. Their fielding all through the innings was superb, and helped rack up the pressure on England. A win to be proud of for the Proteas, who are emerging as serious contenders in this World Cup.

One run

All done now, barring any extras. Curran hits it straight to mid-off and picks up a single.

No run

Curran works it to deep mid-wicket but declines the run. Brave move.
