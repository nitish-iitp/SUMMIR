Huge positives for South Africa as win over England maintains perfect record
South Africa held their nerve to win yet another close encounter at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, but their win over England offered some particularly encouraging moments for the Proteas.

By Carrie Dunn and Tom Bennett

Quinton de Kock finds top gear

Quinton de Kock has found form at precisely the right moment for the Proteas. The opening batter is key to his side’s chances at the tournament, with fast starts the order of the day for a batting line-up stacked with middle-order hitters. And he’s now had two superb knocks in succession to help South Africa to the top of Group 2.

His 74 against the USA was a welcome return to form, but this 65 against England was a knock that stood apart from the rest on a pitch where many batters struggled to find fluency.

He was targeted by bowlers who have excellent records against him in Reece Topley and Moeen Ali, but survived that test and milked England’s quicks for runs, most notably banging three consecutive boundaries in Jofra Archer’s first over.

An array of in-form bowling options

Quinton de Kock may get the big headlines with his superlative batting thus far in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024, but South Africa were boosted against England by an excellent bowling performance.

In a tournament that's been all about the bowlers, maybe South Africa's attack is going under the radar a little. Against England, Aiden Markram called on six bowlers (including himself for a single, economical, over), four of whom took at least one wicket.

Anrich Nortje is now his nation's leading wicket-taker in a men's T20 World Cup, with 31 - 11 of which have been added so far this tournament.

And Kagiso Rabada sits in fourth place of that ranking, on 24.

Compilation of the best moments for Anrich Nortje in the Group stage of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.

David Miller stands tall under pressure again

Three times in this tournament South Africa have been in a spot of bother with the bat only to be rescued by a composed rearguard effort from David Miller. He’s in the side primarily as a lower-order hitter, but it’s been his rescue work that has been most impressive at this tournament so far, giving the team something of a safety net if Plan A doesn’t work.

Against Netherlands it was his outstanding 59* that won South Africa a game that looked very much like losing, and he did exactly what was needed to help his team to a competitive score against Bangladesh too after the side slipped to 23/4. And here it was Miller who was able to rebuild and then accelerate, hitting 43 off 28, departing at the start of the final over.

Only a handful of batters looked anything approaching comfortable on the Saint Lucia wicket, and it will give South Africa great confidence that Miller’s match-winning mindset remains firmly in place as this tournament progresses.

Strong. Experienced. Warrior! Shaun Pollock talks about David Miller who has made a huge impact on South Africa's #T20WorldCup 2024 campaign so far.

Captain's flexibility the key

Ottneil Baartman had a dreadful time of it in the 17th over against England, following an evident pre-established blueprint to bowl full, and overpitching to get hit for 21 in his six deliveries. Markram was quick to advise Kagiso Radaba to avoid that strategy in the next over - and it paid immediate dividends, removing Liam Livingstone two balls later and consigning England's hopes of a resurgent win to the dustbin of dreams.

And the captain's confidence to mix things up and change his plans when it comes to his attack may prove crucial in the latter stages of the competition. With two Super Eights wins out of two, South Africa are in a strong position to progress, and variety and flexibility will be essential elements for any team who hopes to lift the trophy.
