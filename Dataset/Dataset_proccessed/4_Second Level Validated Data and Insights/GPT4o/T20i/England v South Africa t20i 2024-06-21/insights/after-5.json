    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Aiden Markram: Once again, we\u2019ve had a few of those in this comp. Especially today. You got to the last three overs and it looked like the odds would be heavily against you. But for the bowlers to hang in there and execute against really good players, that shows a lot of skill but that comes from somewhere deeper. That shows a lot of heart and spirit.",
        "Jos Buttler: I\u2019d say [it was lost] in the powerplay. De Kock took it on and we couldn\u2019t match them. We were 20 runs behind. We were happy chasing 160 but they bowled well in the powerplay.",
        "Quinton de Kock: We\u2019ve played a couple of games here in certain leagues, and it doesn\u2019t play as nice in the day as it does at night. Night games and day games can be two different surfaces on the same wicket."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "South Africa remain unbeaten and have one foot in the semi-finals. England can still get there if they beat USA and the West Indies beat South Africa. Net run rate will be a factor of course.",
        "De Kock\u2019s knock for sure \u2013 that 65 from the top of the innings was pivotal \u2013 but Maharaj\u2019s 2-25, accounting for Bairstow and Buttler, also deserves a mention. Then of course there was Markram\u2019s catch to remove Brook."
