        "Jos Buttler is player of the match",
        "England remain in the hunt for the semi-finals after a 20-run win over New Zealand at the Gabba",
        "England keep T20 World Cup hopes alive with victory over New Zealand",
        "New Zealand, England and Australia each have five points, and are ranked in the order above thanks to net run rate. So New Zealand will still finish top if they beat Ireland, with a far superior rate. England can finish second if they beat Sri Lanka, but they could also be pushed to third if Australia can beat Afghanistan by enough to make up a net run rate deficit."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "England see off New Zealand by 20 runs in an excellent all-round performance",
        "England\u2019s quicks fared better: Wood 1 for 25 from three overs, Curran 2 for 26 from four, Woakes 2 for 33 from four. England\u2019s spinners were also good though, Rashid creating a lot of the mid-innings squeeze, Livingstone doing a job, and for me, the early use of Moeen tilted the match: New Zealand weren\u2019t expecting him to open the bowling and were thrown off balance.",
        "Phillips with 62 from 36 did his best to repair the damage, and Williamson did a job in going with him, but with 40 from 40 he needed to push the accelerator himself a bit harder."
