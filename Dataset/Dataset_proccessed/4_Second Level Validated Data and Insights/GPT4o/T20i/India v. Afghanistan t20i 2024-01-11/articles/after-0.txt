India's new cricket superstar Rinku Singh recalled golden words from MS Dhoni, explaining how it helped him stay calm and composed during run-chases in T20I cricket. Rinku Singh has evolved into one of the finest finishers in the shortest format of the game, having translated his Indian Premier League (IPL) performances to international cricket in an impressive manner.

Speaking to the broadcasters after hitting a quick-fire 16 in India's 6-wicket win over Afghanistan in the T20I series opener in Mohali, Rinku Singh recalled a chat with MS Dhoni from IPL 2023, saying that the World Cup-winning former captain gave him a piece of advice on how to stay composed during high-pressure chases.

"In the last IPL, I spoke to Mahi bhai. He told me 'it always helps if you stay calm and focus on the present and don't show any reaction'. He told me that I should allow the bowler to do his job and then react accordingly to the ball and not anything else," Rinku Singh said on Thursday, January 11.

"If I think too many things can go wrong for me, so I see play according to the ball that is coming at me," Rinku added, revealing what has been working for him.

Rinku Singh has put himself in the mix for the T20 World Cup 2024 campaign in June, coming up with consistent performances since he made his debut last year.

MAKING FINISHING A HABIT

After a thunderous IPL season in 2023, Rinku Singh was called up for T20Is and he has made finishing a habit in the recent past. Rinku has hit 278 runs in 13 T20Is, averaging 69.50 with a strike rate of 180.

"It has become a habit, I have been able to finish games while batting at this number. Enjoyed batting in the cold a lot. While fielding the ball was hurting and nobody could see much out there. But I enjoyed myself in the middle. I try to talk to myself, and tell myself that anything can happen when I bat at No. 6. When I go in, we might need to chase a lot of runs in very little balls. So it helps me if I stay calm," Rinku added.

One of Rinku's most memorable T20I performances came during the second match against South Africa at St. George's Park in Gqeberha in December. He unleashed his explosive batting prowess, scoring an unbeaten 68 off just 39 balls. This innings marked his maiden T20I fifty and was studded with nine boundaries. His six-hitting capabilities were on full display when one of his towering sixes shattered the glass of the media box.

In addition to his T20I exploits, Rinku made the most of his maiden One Day International (ODI) series in South Africa. He debuted on December 19, 2023, and immediately made his presence felt by scoring 17 runs and taking the crucial wicket of Rassie van der Dussen. His ability to perform under pressure in the lower middle order, a role he has honed playing domestic cricket for Uttar Pradesh, suggests that he could be a long-term asset for India in ODIs as well.
