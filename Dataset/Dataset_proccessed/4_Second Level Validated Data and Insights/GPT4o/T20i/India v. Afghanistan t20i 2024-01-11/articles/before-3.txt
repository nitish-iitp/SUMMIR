IND vs AFG T20I series will begin on 11th January, 2024.

Afghanistan are set to play their first-ever bilateral T20I series against India. The upcoming three-match T20I series will commence on 11th January at IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. The rest of the matches of the series will be played at Holkar Stadium in Indore and M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. Afghanistan have a good amount of experience playing in Indian conditions and they will pose a big threat with their spin attack.

Afghanistan will purely bank on their spin-bowling attack against India in the upcoming three-match T20I series. But on the other hand, Indian batters have good numbers against spinners which can help them fight back. The likes of Rinku Singh and Yashasvi Jaiswal have changed the gear for India in T20Is. Let’s have a look at the strike rate of Indian batting line-up selected for the upcoming series.

11 – Sanju Samson – 133.57 :

Wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson has been an inconsistent name in Indian camp. Samson has failed to get consistent opportunities for India in his career. Sanju Samson has so far played 24 T20I matches for India since his debut in 2015 and has scored 374 runs at a decent strike rate of 133.57. Sanju is likely to bat at number 4 or 5 for India.

10 – Shivam Dube – 135.71 :

Indian all-rounder Shivam Dube will be getting a big opportunity to establish himself as an all-rounder in T20I cricket. Shivam Dube had a brilliant Indian Premier League 2023 along with CSK and did his job exceptionally well as a power-hitter. Shivam Dube’s current strike rate in T20I cricket is 135.71 and he will be looking to better this in the upcoming three-match T20I series against Afghanistan.

9 – Virat Kohli – 137.96 :

Indian batter Virat Kohli will be playing a T20I game after a gap of almost 15 months. Virat Kohli is the leading run-scorer in this format with 4008 runs in 107 T20I innings. Virat’s strike rate in this format is 137.96 with one century and 37 half-centuries. Virat Kohli has made his plans clear for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2024 in West Indies and USA. Kohli stayed away from T20Is after the semi-final loss in T20 World Cup 2022 against England in Adelaide.

8 – Rohit Sharma – 139.24 :

Shubman Gill is among one of the biggest finds for team India in limited-overs cricket. Shubman Gill had a stellar run in the year 2023 and scored his first-ever T20I century.

He has so far scored 312 runs in T20Is with a strike rate of 145.11, he also has a century and a half-century to his name in this format of the game.

If Indian team management decides to go with Shivam Dube as a pinch-hitter against Afghanistan in the three-match T20I series, wicket-keeper batter Jitesh Sharma will find his place in the playing XI. Jitesh Sharma made his international debut for India in the Asian Games 2023 in September. Jitesh has since then got constant opportunities and played seven T20I matches. He has scored 69 runs at a strike rate of 150.

3 – Washington Sundar – 150.70 :

All-rounder Washington Sundar has been in and out of the Indian playing XI in T20Is. Sundar might have to wait once again as he will compete with the likes of Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravi Bishnoi. Sundar has played 40 T20I games since his debut in 2017 and scored 107 runs in 15 innings. Sundar is used widely as a lower-order batter and has batted at a strike rate of 150.70 in T20Is.

2 – Yashasvi Jaiswal – 159.25 :

Young sensation Yashasvi Jaiswal was India’s prolific run-scorer in T20Is last year. Yashasvi Jaiswal also made his debut against West Indies along with Tilak Varma and became an integral part of Indian T20I squad. Yashasvi has adopted a different approach as an opener and looks to attack bowlers from the very first ball. Jaiswal has batted with an outstanding strike rate of 159.25 in 14 T20I innings.

1 – Rinku Singh – 180.68 :

India’s middle-order batter Rinku Singh has become a new-age star in Indian cricket. Rinku stunned everyone with his calm and composure and took Indian side out of crisis in many occasions. Rinku has been dismissed only four times in eight innings and scored 262 runs. Rinku Singh batted with an outstanding strike rate of 180.68, he played a few crucial and match-winning knocks in T20Is.
