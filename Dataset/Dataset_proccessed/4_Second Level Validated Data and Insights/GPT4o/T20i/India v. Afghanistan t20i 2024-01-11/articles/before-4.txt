Squads

In what promises to be an exciting encounter, India are all set to square off against Afghanistan in the first match of the three-match T20I series at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali on Thursday, January 11. The clash will see Rohit Sharma, the formidable Indian batter, leading the home side, while Ibrahim Zadran will command the Afghan squad.

India, coming off a T20I series against South Africa that concluded in a 1-1 draw, will be eager to make a strong statement on their home turf. Rohit, known for his explosive batting and astute captaincy, will be key to India’s fortunes as they seek to gain an early advantage in the series.

On the opposing side, Afghanistan arrive with confidence riding high after a successful outing against the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where they clinched a 2-1 victory in the T20I series. Zadran, at the helm of the Afghan team, will be looking to build on the team’s recent success and make a mark against a formidable Indian side.

Afghanistan tour of India 2024, 1st T20I:
Date and time: January 11, 2024, 1:30 pm GMT | 07:00 pm IST
Venue: Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium, Mohali
IS Bindra Stadium Pitch Report:

The pitch at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium is a well-balanced track, providing opportunities for both batters and bowlers. As the match progresses, batting becomes increasingly demanding, offering bowlers substantial assistance throughout the game. Particularly in the later stages, spinners are expected to capitalize on the ground conditions. Winning the toss, captains will likely opt to set a target rather than chasing, considering the challenges posed by the pitch dynamics at this venue.
