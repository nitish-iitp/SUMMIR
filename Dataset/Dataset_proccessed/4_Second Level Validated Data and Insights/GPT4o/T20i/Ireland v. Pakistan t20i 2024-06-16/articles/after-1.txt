In Short
Pakistan will face Ireland in Group A encounter on June 16 in Florida
The 2 teams will look to salvage some pride after early exit from T20 World Cup
Ireland and Pakistan have been knocked out from the tournament

The Pakistan team will look to salvage some pride as they take on Ireland in the last match of the Group A encounter, which also happens to be their last match of the T20 World Cup 2024. The match will be played at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground, Lauderhill in Florida on June 16, Sunday. Pakistan and Ireland have been knocked out of the marquee tournament as they failed to qualify for the Super 8 stage. The 2 teams had earlier met in a 3-match T20I series and Ireland did manage to take the Pakistan team by surprise.

For Ireland, the Sunday encounter will be an opportunity to not return win-less as they are yet to register a win in the tournament, having lost against India and Canada. Their match against the USA resulted in a washout at the same venue. Meanwhile, Pakistan have registered only one win against Canada in the tournament so far. Pakistan would look to their tournament on a high, if the weather permits. As they will head back to Pakistan, only to face the wrath of the board as well as the fans who have been upset with the team's performance. This is the first time that Pakistan has been eliminated after just 3 games of the T20 World Cup.

PAK vs IRE: Head-to-Head

The 2 teams have met each other on 4 occasions in T20Is. Pakistan has emerged victorious in 3 of those occasions and Ireland has managed a solitary win. The only time these 2 teams faced each other in a T20 World Cup game was in 2009, when Pakistan won by 39 runs. Ireland beat Pakistan in the recently-concluded 3-match T20I series.

PAK vs IRE: Team news

Pakistan might look to bring in some changes in their playing XI and give opportunities to the players who have not got a chance so far. Hence, Abrar Ahmed and Abbas Afridi might get a go for Pakistan's last match. Ireland had not played a match for a week and hence, it might be difficult to tell if the side would make any changes.

PAK vs IRE: Pitch and conditions

All the matches in Lauderhill between Sri Lanka and Nepal, USA and Ireland, and India and Canada were abandoned without a single ball being bowled or even a toss. The forecast for Sunday is expected to be better, but it all will come down to how much rain falls overnight and how the outfield will be in the morning.

PAK vs IRE: Predicted XI

Pakistan (probable XI): 1 Mohammad Rizwan (wk) 2 Saim Ayub 3 Babar Azam (C) 4 Fakhar Zaman 5 Usman Khan 6 Shadab Khan 7 Imad Wasim 8 Shaheen Afridi/Abbas Afridi 9 Naseem Shah/Abrar Ahmed 10 Haris Rauf 11 Mohammad Amir

Ireland (probable XI): 1 Andy Balbirnie 2 Paul Stirling (C) 3 Lorcan Tucker (wk) 4 Harry Tector 5 Curtis Campher 6 George Dockrell 7 Gareth Delany 8 Mark Adair 9 Barry McCarthy 10 Josh Little 11 Craig Young/Ben White

PAK vs IRE: What they said

"Look, I know we're out of the tournament, and it's hard for the players but at the end this is an international game, a World Cup game, so we won't take anything lightly. We will go out there and play for the country and play for the pride of our country which we already did, but unfortunately, the results, we can't control it. Yeah, but we go out there and play like it's a World Cup game," Imad Wasim said on the importance of Ireland game.

Yeah, we've been quite lucky. We played them a couple of weeks ago back home in Ireland. It's been a challenge from a preparation point of view. We haven't trained at all since we were down in Florida last week, so I mean, that is what it is. We've been having our unit meetings and our preparation meetings and just going over some of those plans that we've managed to execute pretty well back home and won the first game. We can piggyback on that, and so that for a little longer period, and hopefully we can go well again," Heinrich Malan said on preparations for Pakistan game.
