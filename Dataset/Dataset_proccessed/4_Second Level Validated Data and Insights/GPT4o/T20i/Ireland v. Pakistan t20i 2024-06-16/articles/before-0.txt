بابر اعظم بہت پریشان تھا ۔۔۔ پریشانی سمجھ میں آرہی تھی۔۔ کاش حارث رؤف 3 بالز پر 12 رنز بچا لیتا، کاش رضوان تھوڑا صبر کرلیتا، کاش چاچا اور عماد وسیم تیز کھیل لیتے تو ہماری عید کی خوشیاں ڈبل ہو جاتی💔😭#PAKvIRE #T20WorldCup #BabarAzam #pcb pic.twitter.com/oXwWkzCbU7

Babar Azam should not be made a scapegoat to hide the system's and team's faults.

He is our best player. Burdening him with all the blame and relieving others is not right.#T20Worldcup | #PAKvIRE |#Pakistan
