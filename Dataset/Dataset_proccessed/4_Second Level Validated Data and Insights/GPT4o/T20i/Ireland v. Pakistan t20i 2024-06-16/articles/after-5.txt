Azam and Afridi help Pakistan end on a high

Babar Azam guided Pakistan through a nervy chase as they ended their T20 World Cup campaign with a three-wicket win over Ireland on Sunday in the last Group A match, a dead rubber after both teams were already eliminated.

Pakistan finished third in the five-team group with four points after losing to India and the United States, who progressed to the Super Eight stage. Ireland finished bottom with one point from the washout against Canada, ending their campaign without a win.

After Pakistan won the toss and chose to bowl, Shaheen Afridi (3-22) dismissed Andrew Balbirnie and Lorcan Tucker in the first over while skipper Paul Stirling and George Dockrell fell to Mohammad Amir (2-11), leaving Ireland reeling at 28-5 in the sixth over.

Gareth Delany (31 off 19 balls) helped stabilise Ireland’s innings but fell to Imad Wasim (3-8) before an unbeaten last-wicket partnership of 26 runs between Joshua Little (22 not out) and Benjamin White (5 not out) got them to 106-9.

After Pakistan openers Mohammed Rizwan and Saim Ayub (both 17) fell during the powerplay, Barry McCarthy (3-15) dismissed Usman Khan and Shadab Khan in the same over, leaving Pakistan looking shaky at 57-5.

But Azam (32 not out) anchored the innings and Pakistan chased down the target with seven balls to spare, as Lauderhill’s Central Broward Park stadium finally saw a match completed after three of its previous games were washed out. Reuters

And that’s it from the USA and from Group A. Tomorrow, Group D comes to a head when the Netherlands attempt to reach the Super Eights by thrashing Sri Lanka and hoping Nepal do them a favour by beating Bangladesh.

Pakistan finish with two wins, but below USA and India who continue into the Super 8s. “We haven’t played the kind of cricket our country demands,” says SSA, “we have a few areas to improve on. The crowd always come in and support us, they’ve done so throughout the World Cup. It’s tough but thanks to the fans.”

Pakistan must now return home to an unhappy nation, Ireland also to lick their wounds.

The captains have been beckoned over by Harsha Bhogle:

Paul Stirling: “We played well in patches. They blew our top order away but I’m proud of the fight that we’ve shown. We’ll go back and regroup and get better in the months and years to come.”

Babar: “ We have some close games but we didn’t’ finish well. We have some good indivduals but we didn’t play well as a team.”

Another flawed but thrilling game, with Pakistan this time hauling themselves to victory thanks to a couple of strong-arm blows by player of the match Shaheen Shah Afridi. A super effort by Ireland, first by recovering from 32-6, then by keeeping Pakistan in check right until the penultimate over. Ireland, however, finish bottom, only taking one point from the tournament after three losses and that no result against Canada.

Pakistan beat Ireland by three wickets!

19.5 overs: Pakistan 111-7 (Babar 33, Afridi 13) Afridi seals the deal with his second six of Delany’s over, rescuing Pakistan from another self-inflicted slump. Holds his nerve with two huge blows, dropped in between by Stirling at slip who can’t hold onto a flying edge.

18th over: Pakistan 95-7 (Babar 30, Afridi 0) Stirling reviews an lbw to White’s first ball as Abbas sweeps and misses, but the impact was outside off stump. A spliced single, and another, before Abbas tries to knock the top off the bottle. Suddenly we’re down to a run a ball!

Pakistan need 12 off 12 balls.

WICKET! Abbas c sub (R Adair) b White (Pakistan 95-7)

17th over: Pakistan 93-6 (Babar 29, Abbas 16) A huge appeal from Delany for a caught behind against Babar, the umpires go upstairs but the review shows Babar hitting ball to ground before boot. Abbas has switched to a cap to face Delany. A further umpire’s review follows later in the over as they check a bump ball. Three lone singles in the bag and we move towards the denouement.

Pakistan need 14 off 18 balls.

16th over: Pakistan 90-6 (Babar 28, Abbas 14) Abbas pulls the first up but just out of reach of the keeper and they run one to give Babar the strike. A single returns the honours and then a sigh of relief for Pakistan fans as Abbas pounds six high, higher, flying just over the fielder on the rope for six.

Little meanwhile has limped off the pitch. Pakistan need 17 off 24 balls.

15th over: Pakistan 81-6 (Babar 27, Abbas 6) Little limps and lurches between balls, his cramp troubling him, but Babar still can’t lay bat on the first three balls. Breaks free with a dazzling drive for four from the fourth. A couple of singles keeps the rate below six. Pakistan need 26 off 30 balls.

14th over: Pakistan 75-6 (Babar 22, Abbas 5) Campher’s first two balls too good for Abbas, who prods and flashes to no avail. Finally an up and at em four, teed off without much foot movement. Pakistan can’t let the rate grow any larger. Pakistan need 32 off 36 balls.

13th over: Pakistan 70-6 (Babar 22, Abbas 1) Ireland yet to win a game in this World Cup. Adair, napkin tucked into his waistband. Belatedly, perhaps, a more guarded response from Pakistan. Five ticked off. Pakistan need 37 off 42 balls.

WICKET! Imad c Tector b Campher 4 (Pakistan 62-6)

Tector holds onto a screamer at backward point as Imad cuts with flair but straight to the fielder who holds on down on his knees.

11th over: Pakistan 62-6 (Babar 14) A beauty from Campher nearly draws Babar in first ball. A slog just short of where the fielder had been. Imad breaks the tension with four down the ground before falling to the last ball. Babar or bust, says the commentator.

10th over: Pakistan 57-5 (Babar 13, Imad 0)A roaring lbw appeal against Shadab first ball is turned down but he has no time to take advantage after tickling McCarthy through to the keeper (excellent catch) the very next delivery. Babar again left with the batting dregs to haul Pakistan out of the cauldron. DRINKS! At the half way stage, Ireland were similarly placed at 59-6.

WICKET! Fakhar c sub b Campher 5 (Pakistan 52-3)

Little pauses at the stop of his mark, then rolls over onto his back with cramp in the heat – after a bit of push me pull you he is escorted off the field. Walking ok but needing some treatment or infusion. Instead, Campher will bowl – Fakhar throws the bat immediately and the ball lands safely in the hands of the sub fielder at mid-off. Sub-optimal.

8th over: Pakistan 52-2 (Babar 10, Fakhar 5) McCarthy starts with a couple of dots, the third is a bouncer that does Fakhar for pace. Just three from the over as in the crowd, spectators continue to fan themselves from the heat.

4th over: Pakistan 23-0 (Rizwan 5, Saim 17) Little continues, Saim whip-swivels him one leg to the rope, four more follows as another wristy shot zips across the grass. Little is given a second and final warning for running down the wicket – a familiar problem, the commentators say.

20th over: Ireland 106-9 (Little 22, White 5) Imad Wasim with the last over. Little reverse-sweeps the first for a couple, tries to repeat the shot next ball but misses. Misses the sweep next ball too, and can’t get anything on the fourth or fifth. The sixth is patted for one. Three from an excellent last over and Ireland have a total on the board. Should be easily within Pakistan’s grasp but they have tested their own resolve this tournament.

Adair perishes going for the big shot but both Shaheen Shah Afridi and Usman Khan are waiting on the rope and neither seems to see or hear each other. Afridi takes the catch, his arms the longer, but both fall to the ground, Afridi seemingly on top of Usman who hasn’t put his hands back to protect himself as he falls.
