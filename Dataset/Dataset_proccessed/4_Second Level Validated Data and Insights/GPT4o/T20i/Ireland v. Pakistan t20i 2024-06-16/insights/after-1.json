        "The 2 teams will look to salvage some pride after early exit from T20 World Cup.",
        "Ireland and Pakistan have been knocked out from the tournament.",
        "Pakistan might look to bring in some changes in their playing XI and give opportunities to the players who have not got a chance so far.",
        "Ireland had not played a match for a week and hence, it might be difficult to tell if the side would make any changes.",
        "The forecast for Sunday is expected to be better, but it all will come down to how much rain falls overnight and how the outfield will be in the morning.",

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "\"Look, I know we're out of the tournament, and it's hard for the players but at the end this is an international game, a World Cup game, so we won't take anything lightly. We will go out there and play for the country and play for the pride of our country which we already did, but unfortunately, the results, we can't control it. Yeah, but we go out there and play like it's a World Cup game,\" Imad Wasim said on the importance of Ireland game.",
        "\"Yeah, we've been quite lucky. We played them a couple of weeks ago back home in Ireland. It's been a challenge from a preparation point of view. We haven't trained at all since we were down in Florida last week, so I mean, that is what it is. We've been having our unit meetings and our preparation meetings and just going over some of those plans that we've managed to execute pretty well back home and won the first game. We can piggyback on that, and so that for a little longer period, and hopefully we can go well again,\" Heinrich Malan said on preparations for Pakistan game."
