    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "The weather is expected to be slightly chilly, with temperatures dropping to 15 degree Celsius. The good news is that rains are likely to remain away.",
        "The Pakistan management has received a lot of flak regarding Shaheen Afridi's fitness. The pacer, who leads the attack, returned wicketless against India, following which former Pakistan cricketers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, former captain Misbah-ul-Haq, wondered if the pacer was rushed into the action.",
        "Shaheen had suffered a knee injury while fielding in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle in mid-July and was out of action before making a return for the showpiece event in Australia.",
        "The defeat against India makes the clash against Zimbabwe a crucial encounter as far as the semifinal race is concerned. If Pakistan goes down against Zimbabwe, the chances of them making to the final four takes a strong blow.",
        "Although Virat Kohli overpowered the clinical display by Haris Rauf in the previous encounter, the pacer will surely hold the key for Pakistan in the clash against Zimbabwe.",
        "Shaheen Afridi was not in his best, so it will be interesting to see if the management opt to give the pacer some rest, considering Zimbabwe's not so promising batting line-up.",
        "Babar Azam and Co. find themselves at the fifth position on the points table. Zimbabwe are placed one spot above them after sharing spoils with South Africa.",
        "Pakistan endured a four-wicket loss against India in their first match at the tournament. The clash saw Pakistan batter Iftikhar Ahmed scored 51 off 34 balls.",
        "Sharing his thoughts on the contest, he said that the team is 'feeling the pain and hurt' but the morale is still 'high'."
