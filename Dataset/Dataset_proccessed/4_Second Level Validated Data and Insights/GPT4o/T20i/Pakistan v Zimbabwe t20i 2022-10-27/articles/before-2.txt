On the other hand Bangladesh won their first match of Super 12 stage against Netherlands where their batting missed out chances to build soem big partnership and played big inning, but their bowling did a quite predictable work.

While batting first, Bangladesh scored 144/8 where Afif Hossain got the max runs for the team. The batter scored 38 runs in 27 balls, Najmul Shanto got 25 and Mossaddek scored 20. But 5 batters were not abale to get upto double digit.

Bnagladesh came to defend a low total and were able to succefully accomplish their game plan. Taskin Ahmad was the star of the show as he bowled incredibly well and attained a four-wicket-haul which helped Bangladesh bundle Netherlands to 135.
