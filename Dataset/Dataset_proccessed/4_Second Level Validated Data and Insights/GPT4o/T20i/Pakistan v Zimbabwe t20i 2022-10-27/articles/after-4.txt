PAK vs ZIM Highlights, T20 World Cup 2022

Pakistan vs Zimbabwe Highlights, T20 World Cup 2022: Pakistan took a strong blow in the race for semifinals as Babar Azam and Co. endured a one-run defeat against Zimbabwe in the Super 12 encounter at the T20 World Cup in Perth on Thursday. The low-scoring affair saw Pakistan manage 129/8 in response to Zimbabwe's 130/8. The results come as a strong blow to Pakistan, who are yet to open their account at the showpiece event. Sikandar Raza was the standout bowler from Zimbabwe camp, scalping three wickets in his four overs. Meanwhile, Babar Azam's struggle continued as he was packed cheaply on 4. Shortly after his dismissal Blessing Muzarabani cleaned up Mohammad Rizwan on 14. Iftikhar Ahmed also fell for 5. Shan Masood and Shadab Khan then kept the scoreboard ticking before Raza scalped two wickets in consecutive deliveries. He then provided Zimbabwe with a crucial wicket of Masood, who was stumped on 44. Earlier in the day, Mohammad Wasim scalped four wickets and Shadab picked three as Pakistan restricted Zimbabwe to 130/8 in 20 overs after they opted to bat first. Zimbabwe got off to a strong start, with openers Wesley Madhevere and Craig Ervine dealing in boundaries. Haris Rauf then provided Pakistan with the first breakthrough and ever since they dictated the proceedings. There was a point when Shadab and Wasim combined to dismiss four batters in the span of six deliveries, handing Pakistan complete control. Catch the Highlights of PAK vs ZIM, T20 World Cup:

PAK vs ZIM LIVE score: Focus on Shaheen Shah Afridi

The Pakistan management has received a lot of flak regarding Shaheen Afridi's fitness. The pacer, who leads the attack, returned wicketless against India, following which former Pakistan cricketers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, former captain Misbah-ul-Haq, wondered if the pacer was rushed into the action. 

Shaheen had suffered a knee injury while fielding in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle in mid-July and was out of action before making a return for the showpiece event in Australia.

PAK vs ZIM LIVE score: What is at stake for Pakistan

The defeat against India makes the clash against Zimbabwe a crucial encounter as far as the semifinal race is concerned. If Pakistan goes down against Zimbabwe, the chances of them making to the final four takes a strong blow. Hence, the margin for error for Babar Azam and Co. is very little. And although they will be the favourites heading into the contest, but they won't make the mistake to their opponents lightly.

PAK vs ZIM LIVE score: Haris Rauf holds key, will Shaheen play

Although Virat Kohli overpowered the clinical display by Haris Rauf in the previous encounter, the pacer will surely hold the key for Pakistan in the clash against Zimbabwe. 

Shaheen Afridi was not in his best, so it will be interesting to see if the management opt to give the pacer some rest, considering Zimbabwe's not so promising batting line-up.
