        "Martin Tooth: That is a sensational performance by England. To hit 170 with 4 overs to spare and no wickets down, against India. Wow. Peaking at the right time again, a la 2019?",
        "Ravi Bopara: England were fantastic. They are setting the bar and the trend for T20 cricket. They come out and play their shots, not just in international cricket but in domestic cricket too. They are trying to get 60-70 off the first six overs, not just 45."
