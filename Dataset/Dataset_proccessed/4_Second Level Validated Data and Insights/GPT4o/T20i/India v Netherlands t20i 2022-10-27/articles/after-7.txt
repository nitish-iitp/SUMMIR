From Suryakumar Yadav To Virat Kohli: Top 3 Performers For India Vs Netherlands
27 Oct, 2022 By Editor

Team India registered their second win of the ongoing T20 World Cup and this time it was the Netherlands who found themselves teetering at the receiving end of the Men in Blue’s blazing ire, thanks to a show of all-round brilliance from Rohit and company.

Here are our top three performers of the day as Team India registered a comprehensive 56-run win against the Netherlands.

1.    Suryakumar Yadav

Despite missing out on the fireworks in the tournament opener, Suryakumar Yadav was back to his scintillating best, as he changed India’s cautious charge at the halfway mark into a full-blown simmering display of pyrotechnics. On a surface, where breaking free was anything but easy, SKY effortlessly guided the bowlers to the ropes. Surya finished things on a high as he flicked van Beek across the boundary with a theatrical flourish. He stayed unbeaten for 51 off just 25 balls, hammering 7 fours and a six on the final ball of the innings.

2.    Virat Kohli

The former Indian captain scored a second consecutive half-century, pacing his knock perfectly according to the drumbeats of the innings. Virat started slow like in the Pakistan game but soon got a hang of the proceedings at SCG, compounding Netherlands’ misery alongside Rohit Sharma initially and then a marauding Suryakumar Yadav. He was 20 from the first 20 balls and then accelerated by leaps and bounds as he hammered 42 from the last 24 deliveries. He remained unbeaten on 62 from 44 balls, helping India to a momentous total after a pedestrian first half.

3.    Rohit Sharma

The Indian captain was back in the thick of things as he led from the very front, getting back to his elements on a decent note. After losing Rahul early in the game, India needed a proper mix of steam and balance that was brought in perfectly by the skipper, allowing Virat Kohli to settle down. In the monstrous boundaries of the SCG, where, hitting those ropes felt like a Sisyphean task, Rohit did a decent job of finding the gaps and bringing in technical precision to help India stabilize their ship and then fire the required torpedoes to insinuate the impending doom of the Orange Legion.
