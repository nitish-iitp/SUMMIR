India go top of the Group 1 with big win © AFP
All over! India win by 56 runs

Arshdeep Singh didn't get his hattrick and ended up conceding 14 runs off the last over but that didn't matter as Netherlands only went as far as 123 for 9 in their 20 overs as R Ashwin, Axar, Arshdeep and Bhuvneshwar picked two wicket each while Shami got one. The win takes India to top of Group 2.

Two wickets in a single Arshdeep Singh over!

Arshdeep didn't make incisions in the PowerPlay but has made up for it at the death. He removes Logan van Beek and Fred Klaassen off successive balls to put India just one wicket away.

India three away from win

Bhuvneshwar returns and picks his secon d wicket as Netherlands captain Scott Edwards looks to go big and doesn't get the timing behind his shot. He's caught by substitute fielder Deepak Hooda at mid-off.

Wicket for Shami...

Tim Pringle's promising start has come to an end as he's foxed by a slower ball. It was pitched up and the right-hander chipped it in the air having not read the change of pace. An easy catch for Virat Kohli at mid-off leaves India just four short of a massive NRR-boosting victory.

Ashwin picks two in an over!

Netherlands are hurtling towards a big defeat here. Ashwin has dismissed last game's half-centurion Colin Ackermann and Tom Cooper in the same over to leave the chasing side five down.

Axar strikes again...

Axar Patel has ended Bas de Leede's stay. He was slow to start but was getting better. Axar tossed one up after bowling flat deliveries throughout, and de Leede fell for it trying to go big. He ended up mistiming and Hardik Pandya at backward point.

Max O'Dowd is gone...

The opener hit Shami for a four but has been undone by Axar Patel. O'Dowd looked to shuffle across and play a sweep but was too early and the ball sneaked in under the bat to hit the stumps.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar breaks through...

After bowling a maiden in the first over - his eighth in T20Is, Bhuvneshwar has broken through. Left-handed Vikramjit Singh looked to pull a length ball but missed and the ball struck the bails. Netherlands are one down for just 11.

Netherlands need a big start here...

@PrakashG_CB 20 runs too many for Netherlands. I think it's a decent score, not a 200 pitch by any means
27 Oct 2022
  0  0

Big finish for India!

Virat Kohli flicked away a high full toss over deep square leg and Suryakumar flicked the final ball of the innings over fine leg to collect 17 from the last over that pushed India to 179/2. Virat Kohli finished unbeaten on 62 off 44 while Suryakumar made the difference in the latter stage of the game with a 25-ball 51. Big task for the Netherlands batters ahead...

Another half-century for Kohli... and a record too!

SKY is the key

With the surface not really aiding strokeplay, someone like Suryakumar Yadav will definitely hold the key. He has been in great form and generally takes the surface out of the equation. A 20-ball 35/40 here will help India post a formidable total against a jittery Dutch batting lineup.

Fifty and wicket...

Rohit Sharma is gone. He's gone trying to go big and Fred Klaassen has brought a breakthrough here. Rohit falls right after getting to a half-century but the stage is now set for the likes of Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya and Dinesh Karthik to come and blaze away.

Rohit's got an India record today...

Rohit Sharma pushes for India's recovery...

The India captain is chancing his arms and Netherlands are laying out the platform with a few short balls that he's pulling comfortably. Not all have sailed over for a six but he's looking dangerous. India have moved to 67/1 in 10 overs.

Tim Pringle drops a sitter...

Rohit Sharma is looking in the mood for a big knock and Tim Pringle has kept that endeavour going here, dropping a sitter off a miscued hit.

Early wicket for Netherlands

KL Rahul is gone. His PowerPlay woes continue. Since October 2020, he's fallen in the period 13 times in 20 innings against full member nations. He missed a flick off a ball from Paul van Meekeren that swung in and struck on the front pad. Rahul doesn't take a review and walks off for 9 off 12 balls.

Interesting call from India, just moments after South Africa rose up to the top of the Group 2 table with 3 points and an NRR of +5.200. South Africa earned it with a massive 104-run victory. Could India follow suit? We'll have to wait and find out...

TOSS:India opt to bat vs Netherlands. India make no changes to the XI that beat Pakistan.

The intensity of India's batting preparation, with a double session for Rohit, on Tuesday afternoon testified a cold fact, writes our man in Sydney Kaushik R. What fact, you're wondering? Read it in his preview.

Prelude - India to retrain focus after MCG high?

For all the excellence of last Sunday's win, the cold fact is all India got from it was the two points on offer and there's a lot more to play for in this tournament. It's a fair question to ask if the tournament itself can produce a game and exprience better than that, but that makes no difference to what India have set their sights on - their first title since 2007. You can't blame the Indian side if the adrenaline of that victory took at least a day or two to wear off but come Thursday evening, they're back in business in Sydney.

What about Netherlands? It's a great occasion for them to go up against a team like India - a fact not lost on the players. Scott Edwards, their skipper, reckoned it is pretty surreal to face Rohit Sharma's side at the SCG. They have been impressive this tournament so far but have to play out of their skins on Wednesday against a team that is likely to be full-strength in order to rake up more points in the quest for a semifinal spot.
