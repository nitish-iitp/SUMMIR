    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: When you're expected to win, the pressure is a lot more. This was a near-perfect game for us. Won't say we were in a spot of bother at the start, wicket was on the slower side and we couldn't play our shots right at the start. With the ball, we were clinical. I'm not entirely happy with the way I batted, wouldn't say it was a perfect knock. Just to get some runs under my belt was good. Have to get runs, good looking or ugly looking, doesn't matter. Important to keep that confidence ticking.",
        "Netherlands captain Scott Edwards: Definitely the noisiest crowd I've played in front of. It was an awesome experience. It was always going to be tricky chasing 180. Thought we bowled reasonably well, if you don't get wickets, with the batting order they've got, would've been tough to restrict. Looking forward now to our game against Pakistan.",
        "Suryakumar Yadav: Just wanted to express myself. Message was loud and clear when I went in to bat. Wanted to go at 8-10 an over. Enjoying batting with Kohli."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "India's bowlers were also clinical in their defence of 180 against Netherlands",
        "India coast to a win in the end to go top of Group 2. Netherlands have bowled and fielded well, but were shortchanged with the bat on the face of some top class bowling from India.",
        "Bhuvneshwar, Arshdeep, Shami - all of them hit their straps with the new ball. Ashwin and Axar, who bowled all of four overs between them against Pakistan, had a good workout with the ball."
