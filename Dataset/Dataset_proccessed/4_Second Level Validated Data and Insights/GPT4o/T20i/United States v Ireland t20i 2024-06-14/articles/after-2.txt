USA make history after Florida washout

The United States’ T20 World Cup group match against Ireland in Lauderhill, Florida was washed out on Friday, ensuring the co-hosts’ progress to the Super Eight knockout stage at the expense of former champions Pakistan.

Unrelenting rain, which had put South Florida at risk of life-threatening flooding, resulted in a wet outfield when the teams arrived. Although the rain stopped in the morning, umpires called off the game when it returned after several inspections.

India top the group with six points while the USA are second with five points, which means third-placed Pakistan (two points) cannot finish in the top two even if they beat Ireland on Sunday in their final group game.

Only the top two teams from the four groups advance to the Super Eight. The USA defeated Canada in the tournament opener before stunning Pakistan in a match that went to a Super Over. Reuters

Match abandoned

Despite Chuck’s admirable attempt to change the playing conditions at a moment’s notice, there will be no cricket in Lauderhill today. Every thunderstorm has a silver living, though, in this case for the competition co-hosts. This no-result means the USA have reached the Super 8 stage in their first World Cup, eliminating Pakistan, Ireland and Canada in the process. They are also guaranteed a place at the next T20 World Cup in 2026.

It’s a shame they qualified via a washout but nobody should begrudge them their place. They deserved to beat Canada and Pakistan, and they gave India a scare as well. Now they will face West Indies, South Africa and either England or Scotland.

This is their schedule, weather jolly well permitting.

Wed 19 June South Africa (North Sound, Antigua)

Sat 22 June West Indies (Bridgetown, Barbados)

Sun 23 June Scotland or England (Bridgetown, Barbados)

Thanks for your kind company on an historic if strange day. Now somebody fly Chuck out to the Caribbean for goodness sake.

HISTORY IN THE MAKING!!! 🇺🇸🔥🙌

For the first time ever, #TeamUSA have qualified for the Super 8 stage of the @ICC @T20WorldCup! 🤩✨

Congratulations, #TeamUSA! 🙌❤️ pic.twitter.com/tkquQhAVap

Lightning warning in Lauderhill!

Adam Roberts wasn’t wrong. Apparently everyone has scarpered off the field due to a lightning warning, so the match will be officially abandoned any second now.

Some people are on the outfield – two, to be precise, the umpires Rod Tucker and Sharfuddoula. The USA may be about to make cricket history.

“I am shocked that play can even be contemplated,” says Adam Roberts. “The state governor has declared a state of emergency for the counties of Broward ... and mayors of Miami-Dade, Miami and Fort Lauderdale also declared a state of emergency. Because of the rain.”

“To be honest, I’m not sure Chuck is actually all that interested in sport. No doubt he loves America, though. Thank God we don’t get any of that nonsense here.”

Friendly, jaunty patriotism gets our approval, surely? (I may delete this post if Chuck has started chinning Ireland fans for no reason.)

“I get the feeling Chuck plays rugby,” says James Newman. “Lord knows he has a rugger’s mindset.”

I’m slightly worried about how much damage he could do at the all-inclusive bar before the umpires call this off.

Another pitch inspection at 1.15pm local/6.15pm BST

The umpires have decided to look again in about 35 minutes. I suspect deep down they know it’s futile, but the match is far too important for them to toss it off and head down the pub.

The umpires are stamping on the outfield, trying to assess how wet it is and whether there’s any realistic chance of play. Their body language does not bode well for Pakistan and Ireland.

“The pitch might have been a little dodgy (though I prefer to call it ‘entertaining’),” says Richard Peel, “but if they had stayed in Nassau County we would be enjoying days and days of glorious sunny weather with fluffy clouds to watch cricket. How long would it take to knock that stand back up?”

“This USA team is the cricket equivalent of Cameroon at Italia 90 and Croatia in 1998,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “Beating Pakistan and almost beating India (that blasted five penalty runs tilted the momentum) is no mean task. I want then to progress and beat India in the semis.”

If they are the equivalent of Cameroon, they will batter England in the Super 8s and somehow lose on a Super Over.

“From a US perspective, I think I’d either want to play the whole game or none of it,” writes Beau Dure. “An abbreviated game would raise the likelihood of a fluke result like Ireland beating the USA, and I can’t believe I just wrote that sentence about a sport other than basketball, volleyball or water polo.”

Welcome to cricket, the game that makes you feel guilty even when you win. (Not sure Ireland winning would be a fluke, mind you. They beat the eventual winners England at the last T20 World Cup, and that was no fluke.)

“Hi from DC,” writes Kyle Hill. “Because it’s often more interesting than doing work in the middle of the US day, I’ve been dispassionately reading the Guardian’s OBO coverage of this obscure, strange foreign sport since the 2005 Ashes. But now that I actually have some investment in the results, I’m going to need to know: IS it cowardly to pray for rain?”

Is it even more cowardly to say it depends?

The outfield is still very wet, so there will be another inspection at 11.30am local/4.30pm BST. If I had to bet the farm I’d say the match will be washed out because of further rain, but I’m thousands of miles away so I’m not sure what the point of this sentence is.

“Took the day off work, put on my US Soccer jersey (closest I’ve got, as it’s basically impossible to figure out which websites sell legit USA cricket jerseys), and now... rain,” laments Zach from Texas. “Ready for a nervy little 10-over shootout.”

That US kit is one of the better ones at this tournament. Don’t tell me Fanatics have turned their nose up at it?

If the US qualify it will be historic, but I’m not sure it’ll be that much of a shock. Ultimately it comes down to one result, their win over Pakistan, which was unlikely but not unforeseeable. As their pre-tournament results showed, they’re a proper team now.

Even a semi-final place isn’t completely beyond the realms. If the USA qualify their Super 8 group will include West Indies, South Africa and either Scotland or England. I won’t be putting the farm on it, but you can just about envisage a scenario whereby they win two of those games.

The umpires will inspect at 10.30am local, 3.30pm BST. If it stays dry – iffity iffity if – I’m sure we’ll get a game of some description, even if it’s a 10-over thrash.

If the USA win or the match is rained off, they qualify for the Super 8s

If Ireland win, it gets complicated. The USA would have four points, having played all their games, while Ireland, Pakistan and Canada would all be on two points with one match to play: Ireland v Pakistan and India v Canada. In that scenario, either net run-rate or the weather would decide who qualifies along with India.

The good news is that it’s dry in Lauderhill, with unconfirmed reports of an orange thing in the sky, so there is still hope of a game at some stage. But for now the outfield is nowhere near playable so the toss won’t take place at 11am local/3pm BST.

Preamble

Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s groundbreaking live blog of the Florida weather. If the USA’s match with Ireland is washed out, the likeliest scenario after the biblical weather of the last few days, they will qualify for the Super 8s on their T20 World Cup debut.

It’s an extraordinary prospect, made possible by their rousing victory over Pakistan eight days ago. That result has shaped Group A and given the USA a shot at glory, albeit potentially without getting on the field. After the Miracle on Ice, it’s time for the Miracle at Sea.

If the players do get on, Ireland need to win to keep both their and Pakistan’s qualification hopes alive. But the prospects don’t look great.

The scheduled start time is 3.30pm BST, 10.30am local. It could be a long day – and an historic one.
