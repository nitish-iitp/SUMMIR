Ireland will play their third game of the T20 World Cup 2024 against United States of America on Friday in Florida. It is a huge game for the Irish side who have lost both their encounters so far. This has left Paul Stirling and his team with a huge mountain to climb if they have to make it to the Super 8 stages.

The Irish side will first have to beat the high-flying United States of America. They also have to hope for an Indian win over Canada and also then beat Pakistan in their final match on Sunday. It has been a difficult campaign for the Ireland side which began with a huge loss to India. None of the batters could put up a fight as they were bowled out for a meagre 96 on the board. It was their shock loss to Canada that has left them left them in troubled waters.

Here is the likely Ireland XI for the game against USA:

Openers – Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie

One of the biggest problems for Ireland during their current T20 World Cup campaign has been their opening pair. Andrew Balbirnie has suddenly lost his form with the bat and skipper Paul Stirling too is struggling for runs. Despite the class they have with the bat, Ireland’s bad starts to the innings have cost them dear.

Middle-order – Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector

Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector have for long been touted as the next best players to come out of Ireland. The pair have the ability to play the big innings and are naturally attacking with the bat. Harry Tector in particular uses his frame well to have a go at the pacers and is also adept at playing the spinners.

All-rounders – Curtis Campher, George Dockrell, and Gareth Delaney

Over the years, Ireland have possessed some of the most gifted all-round players. In the current team they have Curtis Campher who is a decent hitter of the ball and also can bowl effectively. George Dockrell will be the key for his side as he is not only an able batter but also the lead spinner. Gareth Delaney showed his talent with the bat against India and will want to show why he is counted as one of the best Irish players.

Bowlers – Mark Adair, Joshua Little, Barry McCarthy, and Craig Young

In the game against USA, Ireland will hope that their lead pacer Joshua Little can find his form. The left-arm pacer can generate good speeds and can also bowl a good bouncer. Mark Adair has been impressing everyone with his steady bowling and is also more than capable with the bat. Barry McCarthy and Craig Young have been putting up consistent performances and delivering wickets at regular intervals for their side.

Ireland XI vs USA

Andrew Balbirnie, Paul Stirling(C), Lorcan Tucker (WK), Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, George Dockrell, Gareth Delaney, Mark Adair, Barry McCarthy, Craig Young, and Joshua Little
