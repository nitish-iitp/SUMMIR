        "India's current 10-match winning streak in T20Is has only ever been bettered by Afghanistan (twice).",
        "The absences of Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant \u2013 both rested \u2013 and Deepak Chahar and Suryakumar Yadav, who were injured against the West Indies, means more chances for those on the fringes.",
        "Sri Lanka are 3-time T20 World Cup finalists, having beaten India in the 2014 final, but it\u2019s been a steep decline since then.",
        "Injuries have further weakened Sri Lanka, and the absence of Wanindu Hasaranga, their most gifted all-rounder, because of Covid-19, is a further blow.",
        "Match Details: India vs. Sri Lanka, 2nd T20, Venue: Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, Dharamsala, Date & Time: Feb. 26, 2022, at 7:00 PM IST.",
        "India's probable playing XI: Rohit Sharma (C), Ishan Kishan (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Sanju Samson, Venkatesh Iyer, Ravindra Jadeja, Deepak Hooda, Harshal Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal.",
        "Sri Lanka's probable playing XI: Pathum Nissanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Charith Asalanka, Janith Liyanage, Dinesh Chandimal (WK), Dasun Shanaka (C), Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Praveen Jayawickrama, Jeffrey Vandersay, Lahiru Kumara.",
        "Head-to-head Record: India Won 15, Sri Lanka Won 7, Tied/NR 1. In India: India Won 9, Sri Lanka Won 2, Tied/NR 1. Last 10 Matches: India Won 6, Sri Lanka Won 3, Tied/NR 1.",
        "Weather Report: It\u2019s still winter in Dharamsala and the temperature could drop to as low as 6\u00b0C during the game. There is also the likelihood of rain earlier in the day and during the game.",
        "Pitch Report: It\u2019s nearly 6 years since Dharamsala hosted a T20I, and a sample size of 6 completed matches isn\u2019t much to go on. In 2 of those games, the team batting first made over 180, but India\u2019s score of 199 was chased down by South Africa in 2015. Given the wintry weather, and the high altitude though, the quicker bowlers should enjoy the conditions. So will the six-hitters.",
        "Toss: Because it\u2019s been so long since international games were played here, trying to analyze previous results doesn\u2019t make much sense. Teams batting first did win 4 of the 6 completed games here, but because they included teams like Oman and Ireland, it\u2019s even harder to draw any conclusions. With moisture in the air, assuming it does rain in the afternoon, bowling first should be the way to go."
