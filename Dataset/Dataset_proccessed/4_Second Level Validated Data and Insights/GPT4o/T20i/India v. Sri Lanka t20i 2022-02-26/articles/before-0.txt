India’s current 10-match winning streak in T20Is has only ever been bettered by Afghanistan (twice). But in a T20 World Cup year, India are concerned with far more than statistics. The setbacks at the T20 World Cup in 2021 showed them how much they needed to improve, and there has been an infusion of both new faces and ideas since then. 

The challenge now is to arrive at a first-choice XI and consistent bench strength. The absences of Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant – both rested – and Deepak Chahar and Suryakumar Yadav, who were injured against the West Indies, means more chances for those on the fringes. It’s up to the likes of Sanju Samson, who didn’t even get to bat in the 1st game, to make best use of the opportunities. 

Sri Lanka are 3-time T20 World Cup finalists, having beaten India in the 2014 final, but it’s been a steep decline since then. Injuries have further weakened them, and the absence of Wanindu Hasaranga, their most gifted all-rounder, because of Covid-19, is a further blow. Even a full-strength side would have struggled to keep pace with this Indian outfit.

Weather Report

It’s still winter in Dharamsala and the temperature could drop to as low as 6°C during the game. There is also the likelihood of rain earlier in the day and durng the game also.  

Pitch Report

It’s nearly 6 years since Dharamsala hosted a T20I, and a sample size of 6 completed matches isn’t much to go on. In 2 of those games, the team batting first made over 180, but India’s score of 199 was chased down by South Africa in 2015. Given the wintry weather, and the high altitude though, the quicker bowlers should enjoy the conditions. So will the six-hitters.  

Toss

Because it’s been so long since international games were played here, trying to analyze previous results doesn’t make much sense. Teams batting first did win 4 of the 6 completed games here, but because they included teams like Oman and Ireland, it’s even harder to draw any conclusions. With moisture in the air, assuming it does rain in the afternoon, bowling first should be the way to go.  

Top Fantasy Picks
India
Ishan Kishan’s strike rate across the 9 T20Is played (122.42) is well below what he is capable of, but there were signs in the opening game against Sri Lanka of the talent that India hope will make such a big difference at the T20 World Cup in Australia later this year. He struck 3 sixes and 10 fours as Sri Lanka’s bowlers were taken apart in the Power Play and after it as well. 
Yuzvendra Chahal is now India’s leading wicket taker in T20s with 67 wickets. Of those, 16 have come in 8 matches against Sri Lanka. The economy rate in those games (8.40) is a touch on the high side, but Chahal’s primary role has always been to take wickets in the middle overs.  

Sri Lanka

Charith Asalanka scored an unbeaten 53 in the first game, 3rd half century in 15 matches even though the team got thrashed. He struggled badly in the recent series in Australia, and a return to slightly more familiar Asian conditions should be to the liking of one of Sri Lanka’s brightest batting prospects.  
Lahiru Kumara has taken 41 wickets in 36 T20Is at an average of 24.58. His economy rate of 8.36 is little on the higher side but he is a wicket taker. Lahiru has taken 5 wickets in his last 3 T20Is with a best of 2/22 coming against Australia a few matches back.
