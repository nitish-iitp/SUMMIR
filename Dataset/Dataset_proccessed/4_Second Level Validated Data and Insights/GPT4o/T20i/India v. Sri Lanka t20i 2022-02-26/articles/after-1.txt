Jaffer: India's batters making the most of their chances

India 186 for 3 (Shreyas 74*, Jadeja 45*, Kumara 2-31) beat Sri Lanka 183 for 5 (Nissanka 75, Shanaka 47*, Bumrah 1-24) by seven wickets

Shreyas Iyer's unbeaten 74 off 44 balls trumped Pathum Nissanka's 75 off 53, while Ravindra Jadeja's 45 not out off 18 outshone Dasun Shanaka's 47 not out off 19 as India chased down Sri Lanka's 183 for 5 with seven wickets and 17 balls to spare in the second T20I in Dharamsala. The win, India's 11th on the trot in T20Is, gave the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series.

After being put in, Sri Lanka were only 111 for 4 after 16 overs but Nissanka and Shanaka ransacked 72 off the last four. Nissanka hit 11 fours during his stay, while Shanaka preferred the aerial route. He struck two fours and five sixes, two of them on the last two balls of the innings, to propel Sri Lanka to a formidable total.

India lost Rohit Sharma in the first over of the chase and were 56 for 2 after eight overs, needing another 128 from the last 12. Initially, Shreyas seemed uncertain, shuffling around the crease, but once he began connecting his shots, the Sri Lanka bowlers looked helpless against his power and timing.

Sanju Samson began scratchily too, but he took 23 off the 13th over, bowled by Lahiru Kumara, leaving India needing 56 off 42 when Jadeja walked in. Jadeja did the bulk of the scoring from there on, and handed India a comfortable win in the end.

Sri Lanka's sedate start
Bowling first, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah made good use of the moisture in the surface. Both seamers got the ball to jag around, with Bumrah slipping in a few yorkers as well. Openers Nissanka and Danushka Gunathilaka tried to counter that by showing attacking intent but they struggled to connect their shots. In the first four overs, Sri Lanka scored only 15 runs and hit just one boundary.

The step up
With the ball still moving around, there was a case to give Bhuvneshwar a third over in the powerplay but Rohit went to Harshal Patel. Harshal tried his slower one with mixed results: there were a couple of plays-and-misses in the fifth over but also two boundaries.

The next three overs featured a boundary each as Sri Lanka went past 50 in the eighth over. Gunathilaka then smashed Jadeja for six, four and six off the first three balls of the ninth over, with both sixes coming via slog-sweeps. Off the fourth ball, he went for another slog-sweep but this time Jadeja shortened his length a touch and bowled it further away from his arc to induce a top-edge, which Venkatesh Iyer gobbled up running in from long-on.

Nissanka, Shanaka launch onslaught
The next two overs produced two more wickets - Yuzvendra Chahal trapped Charith Asalanka lbw and Harshal had Kamil Mishara caught in the covers with a slower one - but Nissanka kept the scoreboard ticking with a couple of fours off Bhuvneshwar in the 13th over. In the 15th, Dinesh Chandimal brought up Sri Lanka's 100 with a straight four off Bumrah but the bowler dismissed him off the very next ball with an offcutter.

Nissanka reached his fifty off 43 balls with a boundary off Chahal, before he and Shanaka went all-out. Shanaka launched Harshal for two sixes in a 19-run 17th over, while Nissanka used the lap and the reverse lap to help take 14 off Bumrah in the 18th.

Bhuvneshwar was the next to bear the brunt as Shanaka hit successive balls for six and four. Bhuvneshwar dismissed Nissanka with the last ball of his spell but Shanaka wasn't done yet. He smashed Harshal for two sixes and a four in the 20th over, which also featured four leg-byes and went for 23 in all.

Pace like fire
If Bhuvneshwar and Bumrah tested the Sri Lanka openers with swing, Dushmantha Chameera and Kumara troubled Indian with raw pace. Rohit played on to Chameera in the first over; it was the fifth time Chameera had dismissed him in T20Is, the most for any bowler-batter combination. Kumara began his spell with a 146.7kph thunderbolt. With his second ball, he rattled Ishan Kishan by hitting him on the helmet.

In the fifth over, Shreyas hit Binura Fernando for three successive fours but Kumara got rid of Kishan with the first ball of the next over. The batter tried to whip one towards midwicket but ended up lobbing it towards mid-on.

Shreyas breaks the shackles, Samson joins in belatedly
India managed just 12 runs from overs six to eight before Shreyas stepped out to left-arm spinner Praveen Jayawickrama and launched him for back-to-back sixes. At the halfway stage, India were 80 for 2, needing 104 from the last ten overs. Shreyas hit two more sixes in the next two overs, the first one bringing up his half-century off just 30 balls.

Samson was on 17 off 19 balls before hitting three sixes and a four in Kumara's third over. He fell off the final ball of the over, trying to fetch another boundary, but the 23 runs from it had brought the equation down to 56 required from seven overs.

Jadeja applies finishing touches
For the second match in a row, Jadeja was sent in ahead of Venkatesh. He opened his account by creaming Chamika Karunaratne through extra-cover and hit three boundaries off the first six balls he faced. Soon, India needed only 31 from 30 balls. In the 16th over, Jadeja got stuck into Chameera, hitting him for three fours and six to all but seal the deal.
