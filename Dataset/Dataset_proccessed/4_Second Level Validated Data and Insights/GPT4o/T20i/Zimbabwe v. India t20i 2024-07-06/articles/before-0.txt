Preview

Zimbabwe will play against India in the first T20I of the five-match series at the Harare Sports Club in Harare. The hosts Zimbabwe last played a T20I nearly two months ago against Bangladesh during an away series, which they lost 1-4, which has led to a wholesale number of changes in the squad. Meanwhile, the newly crowned T20 World Cup champions will have none of their players from the title winning squad in the first couple of T20Is, making it an intriguing series for the fans to look forward to.

Pitch Report

The pitches at the Harare Sports Club are known to be quite decent for batting, but it also provides early assistance to the pacers, and spinners to come into play in the middle overs with some turn on offer as well. With that, the average first innings score of 156 runs in T20Is at this venue, which might not prove to be enough for either India or Zimbabwe to defend in the first match of their upcoming series.

Team Analysis

Zimbabwe

Sikandar Raza will be captaining the Zimbabwe cricket team which welcomes Antum Naqvi, the Belgium-born cricketer of the Pakistani descent, in the squad for the first-time. Wesley Madhevere and Brandon Mavuta have returned to the set-up after serving their drug suspension, while Tendai Chatara will be bringing his experience to the team after being on the sidelines for some time.
