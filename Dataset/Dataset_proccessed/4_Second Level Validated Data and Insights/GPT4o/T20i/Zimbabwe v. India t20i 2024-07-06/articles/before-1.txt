India are touring Zimbabwe for a five-game T20I series, starting from Saturday, July 6. The Harare Sports Club will be hosting all games of this series. The tour comes to an end on Sunday, July 14.

India recently won the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. They lifted their second title after winning the inaugural edition way back in 2007. It is to be noted that India have sent a second-string squad to Zimbabwe for the T20I series and it looks to be a solid one.

Shubman Gill has been handed the responsibility of leading the Indian side. The likes of Gill, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Abhishek Sharma, Rinku Singh, and Riyan Parag form a solid batting line-up. The bowling attack comprises Avesh Khan, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, and Ravi Bishnoi.

Zimbabwe, on the other hand, will be led by Sikandar Raza. Their last international assignment came back in May when they faced Bangladesh in a five-match T20I series. It was a closely fought series which they lost by a 4-1 margin.

Zimbabwe have announced a well-balanced squad to face India. The likes of Raza, Milton Shumba, Wessley Madhevere, Luke Jongwe, and Blessing Muzarabani have a good amount of experience and will play a crucial role for the hosts in the five-match T20I series.
