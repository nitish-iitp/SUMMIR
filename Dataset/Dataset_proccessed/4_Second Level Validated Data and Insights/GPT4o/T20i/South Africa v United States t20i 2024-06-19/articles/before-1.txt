With Bangladesh becoming the last team to qualify following their victory against Nepal, the fixtures have been finalised for the Super Eight phase of the 2024 T20 World Cup. Here's the full fixtures list, including match timings and venues.

The group stage of the competition threw up several surprises, with Pakistan eliminated from the competition as well as New Zealand. England were in a precarious position after losing to Australia and suffering a washout against Scotland, but secured their place with two big wins over Oman and Namibia.

For the second stage of the competition, the top two sides from each group will be split up into two new groups. The first seeded side from Groups A and C (India and Afghanistan) will be in Group One alongside the second seeded teams from Groups B and D (Australia and Bangladesh).

The first seeded sides from Groups B and D (England and South Africa), will be joined by the second seeded sides from Groups A and C (USA and West Indies).

Each side will play the others in their group once, with two points awarded for a win like in the group stage, and the top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals.

The Super Eights phase of the competition gets underway on June 19, with two matches per day until June 24. The rest of the competition will be played entirely in the West Indies, with the US leg of the tournament now over.

The semi-finals will be played in Tarouba (June 26) and Guyana (June 27), before the final is played in Barbados on June 29.
