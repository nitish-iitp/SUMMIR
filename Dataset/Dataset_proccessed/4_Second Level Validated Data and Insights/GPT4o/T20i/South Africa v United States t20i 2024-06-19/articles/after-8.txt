Right, that's us for today. Head over to take a read of Tom Mallows' match report.

And once you've read that, no doubt your attention will turn to the 01:30 BST match between England and the West Indies.

We've got you covered there too - there Matt Henry's preview and a TMS podcast. And in the early hours we'll be live with text and radio commentary from the TMS team (if you can't stay up it'll be there for you to listen to later).

Grab a nap and we'll see you there.

South Africa captain Aiden Markram: "Hopefully we can tidy up a few things and the win looks a little bit more comprehensive.

"You are always going to feel like you should score more. It was a nice start but the wicket definitely changes up. It got slower and more stoppy. If you marry those things together it makes sense why you don't feel like you a bang. We'd rather finish like that than blow out for 160-170.

"It is big for us that the top order got some runs. It is big for Quinny [Quinton de Kock] to get his flow.

On his bowlers: "Pretty much happy. there were a few things we can tidy up. Plans were good but execution let us down a little bit at times. With the wind and short boundary bowlers did a pretty good job."

USA captain Aaron Jones: "I don't want to say disappointed, but yeah it's hard to take the defeat after getting so close. I thought we could have been more disciplined bowling-wise.

"I think we have a really good unit, a lot of talent in the USA. When we play good cricket we can beat any team in the world."

On their next match against West Indies in Bridgetown: "Happy to going home for me personally, I know the conditions there. The majority of the guys enjoy playing in the Caribbean and hopefully we can play hard cricket."

'They put us under pressure'
published at 18:59 British Summer Time 19 June 2024
18:59 BST 19 June 2024

Man of the match, South Africa's Quinton de Kock: "It is nice getting out on an easier wicket finally. We've had some tricky wickets coming up to this game so it was nice to get some time out in the middle. The boys played nicely and so did Team USA. They put us under pressure, particularly towards the end. It was a great game.

"I just focused on trying to score the runs with the wind and shorter boundary. The rest took control of itself.

"I don't think this game affects the rest of the Super 8s too much. We've got two big teams to play. We've got a different venue and surface next up so you never know what you're going to get out there."

Meanwhile it was a formidable batting performance from South Africa, who are unbeaten in five matches in this tournament.

Then they strangled the USA innings after the powerplay, putting them far enough behind the rate that they could withhold a late charge from Gous and Harmeet Singh.

Rabada was the pick of their bowlers with 3-18, while the remaining three wickets were shared between Maharaj, Shamsi and Nortje.

The fight and energy of the USA is great, their story throughout this tournament has been inspiring.

The players shake hands in the Antiguan sunshine.

Opener Andries Gous walks off having carried his bat for 80 off 47 - easily better than his previous T20 international high score of 65.

A fine effort from him and the USA, who wrestled their way back into this innings towards the close.

And that's that!

Gous takes a single to point, before Jessy Singh prods the ball down to mid-off and doesn't bother risking the run-out at the bowler's end.

This is superb stuff from Kagiso Rabada, just two singles from the over to accompany that wicket, and he's virtually sealed the game for his side.

He finishes with figures of 3-18.

Three sixes in a row... no, it's gone!

Harmeet departs, picking out Stubbs at mid-wicket off Rabada's full toss.

That's the seamer's third wicket today, he's bowled superbly.

And he's broken a big partnership for the USA - Harmeet and Gous put on 91 from 42 balls.

It's heating up, this is fantastic. Shamsi had good figures up until this point. It was short and Harmeet took care of it.

Harmeet top edges behind the bowler, running a single to bring Gous on strike.

The opener closes the over with consecutive sixes over mid-wicket, the second just evading the boundary fielder who leapt high to try and take a one-hand grab.

Shamsi finishes on figures of 1-50, 22 of those runs coming from this over.

Is this on?

Rabada is using all his skills now with the slower ball. I think Gous has struggled these last few balls. Sometimes we can be guilty of trying too hard.

Kagiso Rabada returns for a third over and starts with a no ball, but Harmeet can only eek a single from the subsequent free hit.

The South Africa seamer is using all his white-ball skills, hanging the ball wide and dropping in slower balls.

Harmeet Singh picks one delivery to drive for four, but that's the only boundary of the over.
