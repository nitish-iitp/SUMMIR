USA vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

Heinrich Klaasen: Heinrich Klaasen will bat in the middle order. Klaasen is among the finest T20 batters and will enjoy batting against the USA. His wicketkeeping will also fetch a few points.

Anrich Nortje: Anrich Nortje is a popular captaincy option for this game. Nortje has been in tremendous form this season and can take wickets against a slightly weak batting unit of USA. He will get some assistance off the deck.

Ottneil Baartman: Ottneil Baartman is another popular captaincy option for this game. Baartman will bowl in different phases and has been in sensational form. He can cause serious damage.

USA vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Harmeet Singh: Harmeet Singh has been selected by less than 8% of users as of now. Harmeet is a quality bowler and will get some assistance off the deck. He can snare a few wickets.

Reeza Hendricks: Reeza Hendricks’ selection % currently stands at 30.97. Hendricks will open the innings and can utilise the field restrictions to score valuable runs. He can play a big knock.

USA vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Players to Avoid

Nitish Kumar: Nitish Kumar might not be as effective and can be avoided for this game.

USA vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Mega League Base Team

USA vs SA Dream11 Prediction: Small League Base Team

USA vs SA Dream11 Prediction

United States are a good side, but South Africa are among the best units in the competition. SA’s bowling attack is fearsome and in red-hot form. That should be enough to hand them a win.
