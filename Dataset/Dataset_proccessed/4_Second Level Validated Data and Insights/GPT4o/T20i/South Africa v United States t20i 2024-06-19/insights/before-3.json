        "America has been one of the surprise packages of the tournament thus far and will be looking to further enhance their burgeoning reputation against a Proteas team which has won all of their games but not been particularly convincing.",
        "United States captain Monank Patel expressed satisfaction with the team's progress, stating, 'We\u2019ve worked for the last five years and are getting the rewards right now on this big stage, and people are recognizing us. That's so satisfying to see that finally we are getting this kind of reward for something which we have done for the past five years.'",
        "South African skipper Aidan Markram is looking forward to the 'business end' of the tournament, saying, 'It is the dream [to lift the trophy], 100%. You take it game by game and you compete as hard and as best as you can. And you ultimately see where it gets you. But I\u2019m looking forward to that phase now of the competition. Really grateful that we are in the Super 8s and hoping that we can put a more complete game of cricket together now that we move forward to the business end of the competition.'"
