    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "USA win the toss and bowl first",
        "Sunny, hot and humid in Antigua. With what looks to be a strong breeze across the ground, shirts billowing, a toup\u00e9e botherer. Shaun Pollock is in the middle and says he doesn\u2019t think it will be a high scoring wicket (it\u2019s the unused pitch number 5, for all you pitch nerds out there).",
        "USA have won the toss and will bowl first. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go with the extra spinner,\u201d Aaron Jones says after calling the coin correctly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s (the pitch) is going to be too different to Dallas.\u201d",
        "Aidan Markram admits he wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to do had he won the toss. \u201cWe would also have leaned towards bowling but we\u2019re not too bothered with the result of the toss.\u201d"

        "The Antigua pitch should suit the batters a bit more, but will by no means be a road.",
        "This is the first game of the Super Eights. In case you are wondering - all teams will start from scratch again, their previous games now have zero bearing.",
        "The US are coached by the former Australian batter, Stuart Law. The US\u2019s star bowler, Saurabh Netravalkar, is a software engineer at Oracle. Netravalkar, 32, bowled the tie-breaking \u201csuper over\u201d against Pakistan and took the wicket of Virat Kohli, the Indian superstar with 269m Instagram followers, though India won the match. Netravalkar was born in Mumbai and played for India under-19s. Batter and vice-captain Aaron Jones, born in Queens and raised in Barbados, smashed 10 sixes in the win over Canada."
