Arshdeep Singh is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliant bowling spell. He says that there was a breeze going around from the end he was bowling. Adds that he did not get the wicket the way he wanted but was happy with it anyway. Mentions that he makes minor changes like with his wrists or fingers to bring in the variations. Says that the young bowlers have done well especially Mayank Yadav who had a good debut.

Suryakumar Yadav, the victorious skipper of India says they just tried to back their skills and tried to walk the talk. Mentions it was great how the guys showed character and selflessness. On being asked about the two debutants, Mayank and Nitish, he appreciates them and says they are interesting players and is looking forward to watching them do well in future games.

Najmul Hossain Shanto, the captain of Bangladesh says that they did not start well. Adds that in T20s it is important to play well in the Powerplay but they didn’t. Mentions that the plan was to bat positively but they also need to adjust according to the situation. Tells that they need to focus on strike rotation and not only on hitting boundaries. Says that they scored 95-odd runs in 14 overs but lost too many wickets. Ends by saying that it is difficult for the bowlers to defend such a low score on a wicket like this, but still Rishad Hossain bowled well and Fizz delivered a couple of decent overs.

Varun Chakaravarthy is up for a quick chat. He says it feels like a rebirth for him to be back in the blues.  Adds he just wanted to stick to the process, and that’s what he tried to do in the Indian T20 League. Adds he doesn’t want to think and express too much. Mentions he got to learn a lot in the TNPL and it was a good preparation for him for this series. Says once you’re not in the Indian team, people write you and you just need to keep doing the job sincerely.

Earlier in the game, Bangladesh posted a below-par total with only Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mehidy Hasan crossing the 20-run mark. Arshdeep Singh and Varun Chakaravarthy were the pick of the bowlers with three wickets each while debutant, Mayank Yadav also performed well and got one. Hardik Pandya and Washington Sundar also chipped in with one each as well. It was a real all-round performance from the World T20 champions and the batters also made the chase look like a cakewalk.

Not much to talk about the bowling of Bangladesh and it was not helped by the fact that their batters did not show up for this game. They were put under pressure early on from the Indian openers and never seemed to recover from that. Mehidy Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman were the ones with a wicket to their name while the other one was a run out. However, there were a few positives, mainly the spinners. Rishad Hossain did not get a wicket but bowled really well and Shoriful Islam was also economical in his two overs and this is something they can build on in the upcoming games.

The target for India was not a big one, but the way they executed the chase was excellent. The positive intent was visible right from the start when the two openers took on the attack. Abhishek Sharma fell to an unfortunate run out but not before playing a fiery cameo. It was actually selfless batting from all the players and no one was going for personal milestone. Sanju Samson failed to convert his start again but showed his class in his knock of 29 off 19. SKY was exceptional and displayed a show of brilliant whips and flicks which also ultimately proved to be his downfall. With not much required to chase, Hardik Pandya and Nitish Kumar Reddy joined hands and made sure to finish the job. Reddy was the second fiddle while Pandya stayed unbeaten on 39 off just 16 balls finishing things off with little more than 8 overs to spare.

Mehidy Hasan bowls it full and flat and keeps the line of attack on the middle and leg stump, Sanju Samson clears his front foot to get some width and goes through the hoick across the line, but it is too close to the body and gets no power and timing at all. Goes off the inner half of the bat and straight towards Rishad Hossain at deep mid-wicket. Sanju Samson straightaway knew that he is in trouble after the point of contact.
