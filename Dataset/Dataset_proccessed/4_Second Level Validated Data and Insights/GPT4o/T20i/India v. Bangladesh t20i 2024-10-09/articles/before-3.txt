Our Batters Don't Know How To Score 180: Bangladesh Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto

Bangladesh's failure to effectively utilise powerplay overs and put up big scores, especially 180-plus totals, is a significant reason for their struggles in T20Is. Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto highlights the need for improved skills, mentality, and responsible batting in the powerplay to enhance their performance.

GWALIOR: A major reason why Bangladesh, who suffered a comprehensive seven-wicket defeat at the hands of a rampaging India at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium here on Sunday night in the opening T20I, continue to lag behind in the T20Is is their lack of hitting power, especially at the top.
At a time when teams aim to maximise powerplay overs and score atleast 180, Bangladesh are failing to utilise the first six overs efficiently and put up big scores, which is hurting them badly in the shortest format.

Post the match, Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto admitted that their failure to utilise powerplay efficiently and make 180-plus totals is hurting them in T20Is. On Sunday night, Litton Das (4) played a terrible shot off Arshdeep Singh to bring about his downfall in the first over while Parvez Hossain Emon, who returned to the T20I side, chopped one onto the stumps.
The sixth over of the innings was a maiden, bowled by pacer Mayank Yadav, a debutant. All they managed in the first six overs was 39 for two, eventually being packed off for 127. India, on the other hand, smashed 71 runs in the powerplay and galloped to the target in 11.5 overs.

As former opener Tamim Iqbal said during commentary, "Bangladesh need to decide which brand of cricket they want to play in the T20s."
"We have the ability, but we have room for improvement in our skills. We have been batting in this way for the last ten years. Sometimes we do well. We have to make some changes, perhaps where we practice back home. We play on 140-150 wickets at home. Our batters don't know how to score 180 runs. I won't blame just the wickets, but we have to consider skills and mentality," Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said at the post-match press conference.

Bangladesh's poor returns in Powerplay, Shanto admitted, were a huge concern.
"Powerplay is definitely a worry. The approach we talked about (before the game), it will be successful if we make a good start with the bat. We have to keep the wickets in the first six overs, and score runs in those. Otherwise those coming in next, it becomes too challenging for them. We have struggled in the powerplay. Those batting in the power play must take more responsibility," the Bangladesh skipper said.
Najmul, though, asserted that his team isn't as bad as it seemed after the way India toyed with them on the park. "I wouldn't say we played badly. We are a better team than this. We haven't done well in this format for a long time, but I don't believe we are such a bad team. I don't want to talk about any individual player. I think the batting unit didn't do well today. There will be aggression in the way we approach our scoring, but sometimes we have to select the balls correctly. We will think about it, but we can't rush in changing our approach," he said.
