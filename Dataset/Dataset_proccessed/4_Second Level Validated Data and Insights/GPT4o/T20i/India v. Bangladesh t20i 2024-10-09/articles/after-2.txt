IND vs BAN 2nd T20I Live: What India skipper said?

IND vs BAN 2nd T20I Live: India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said, "I wanted that situation, wanted my batters (5,6,7) in that situation. Happy for both (Rinku and Nitish) of them. They batted exactly the way I wanted. You got to go out there and express. Just the jersey changes, rest remaining remains the same. I wanted to see what different bowlers can do in different situations. Can they give me the difficult overs. Sometimes Hardik won't bowl, sometimes Washington Sunday won't bowl. Wanted to see what the guys had in store, really happy with it. It was his day, I thought let him enjoy and make it large."

IND vs BAN 2nd T20I Live: What Bangladesh skipper said?

IND vs BAN 2nd T20I Live: Bangladesh skipper Nazmul Hossain Shanto said, "I think we made the same mistakes (like the first game), not a good thing as a team. We need to improve. I think it was a good decision (to bowl). They batted well after the first 6-7 overs, we didn't execute our plans after that. Need to take responsibilites as batsmen, we got to believe in ourselves. The way our bowlers bowled, they were impressive, but we couldn't take wickets in the middle overs like I said."
