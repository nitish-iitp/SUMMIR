Former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali praised India's T20I win against Bangladesh, highlighting India's emerging talent from the IPL. He expressed surprise at Bangladesh's poor performance, especially after their Test series win in Pakistan. India's depth and bowling strength, particularly the debut of Mayank Yadav, were also highlighted by the 53-year-old Basit.
Former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali praised India's T20I win against Bangladesh, highlighting India's emerging talent from the IPL. He expressed surprise at Bangladesh's poor performance, especially after their Test series win in Pakistan. India's depth and bowling strength, particularly the debut of Mayank Yadav, were also highlighted by the 53-year-old Basit.
Impressed with India's dominating T20I win on Sunday, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali also wondered what happened to the Bangladesh team that registered a historic Test series win in Pakistan before travelling to India.
"Is this the same Bangladesh team that whitewashed Pakistan (2-0)? You saw in the Test matches (against India). They lost the first one and then were defeated in virtually two days, even the rain could not save them," said the 53-year-old Basit.

India hammered Bangladesh by 280 runs in the Chennai Test and then won in Kanpur by seven wickets, despite two days getting washed out by rain, to sweep the series 2-0.

Basit was particularly in awe of India's back-up strength, saying the team of young Indian Premier League (IPL) stars led by Suryakumar Yadav made Bangladesh look like an "appetizer".
"India have changed cricket (with their dominance). Bangladesh is just an appetizer (for them)," said Basit.
The T20I retirement of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja has thrown open spots in the playing XI.
"Yeh IPL eleven hai, India ki team nahi hai," said Basit, before pointing at the notable absentees from India's playing eleven in the match at
Gwalior. "There was no (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, no (Shubman) Gill, no Axar Patel, no Rishabh Pant, no (Shreyas) Iyer; (Ravi) Bishnoi did not play. And still they hammered them in just 11-something overs, finishing with a six from (Hardik) Pandya."

India awarded two debut caps for the match, with fast bowler Mayank Yadav and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy making their first international appearance.
After bowling out Bangladesh for 127, India raced home in 11.5 overs for a seven-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Arshdeep Singh (3 for 14) and Varun Chakravarthy (3 for 31) took three wickets each, while Hardik top-scored for the hosts with his stroke-filled 39 off 16 balls, including 5 fours and 2 sixes.
"Why did Suryakumar Yadav opt to bowl after winning the toss?" Basit wondered. "They should have batted on that 200-run flat track. I don't think they will make that mistake in the second match."
Basit was happy to see Mayank sending the speed gun into an overdrive and hoped he remains fit for India's tour of Australia. The speedster began his stint in the international arena with a maiden over while bowling at top speed.


"There were two debuts, but it was a dream debut for Mayank Yadav. The first over was a maiden, including a 149.8 kmph delivery. He could not bowl in the high 150kmph only because he has just recovered from an injury," said Basit
"Darr baithaya usne aaj (he sent down a scare). Batsmen were always on the back foot. I pray that this kid remains fit and goes on the Australia tour.
"Mayank, (Mohammed) Shami, (Jasprit) Bumrah, (Mohammed) Siraj -- four pacers. Banaye Australia bouncy wicket, phir pata chalega (let them prepare bouncy pitches and find out).


After the T20I series against Bangladesh, India will welcome New Zealand for a three-Test series before flying to Australia for the Border Gavaskar Trophy that will be contested over a series of five Test matches.
