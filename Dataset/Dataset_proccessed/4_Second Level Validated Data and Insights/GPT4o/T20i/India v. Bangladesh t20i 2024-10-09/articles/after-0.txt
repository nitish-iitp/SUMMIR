Nitish Reddy’s maiden T20 half-century helps India seal series’ win over Bangladesh

NEW DELHI (AP) — All-rounder Nitish Reddy slammed a maiden half-century in 26 balls as India thumped Bangladesh by 86 runs in the second T20 on Wednesday to seal the series 2-0.

Reddy smacked seven sixes and four fours in scoring 74 runs off 34 balls as India scored a tall 221-9 in 20 overs after Bangladesh opted to bowl.

The hosts were down to 41-3 in 5.3 overs when Rinku Singh played a rescuing hand with 53 off 29 balls, before Reddy took over.

In reply, Bangladesh was restricted to 135-9 in 20 overs. Reddy completed his all-round performance, picking 2-23 in four overs. Mystery leg spinner Varun Chakravarthy also took 2-19.

India had won the first T20 in Gwalior by seven wickets. The third and final T20 will be played in Hyderabad on Saturday.

Initially, India struggled to get going. Sanju Samson failed once again – out for 10. Big hitting Abhishek Sharma (15) and skipper Suryakumar Yadav (8) were back in the hut cheaply as well.

Reddy then took charge, along with Singh, and the duo put on 108 runs off just 49 balls.

The all-rounder, who debuted in the first T20, showcased his hitting prowess amply and lit up the Delhi sky, as India recovered to go past 100 in the 10th over.

He fell to Mustafizur Rehman in the 14th over, when Singh took over to smash his second T20 half-century, hitting three sixes and five fours.

Singh had company from Hardik Pandya who scored 32 off 19 balls, including two sixes. Riyan Parag too hit two sixes – in all, India hit 11 sixes in the middle to death overs despite the early loss of wickets.

India scored 120 runs in the final 10 overs and posted the second highest T20 total against Bangladesh – behind South Africa’s 224-4 in 2017.

In reply, the Tigers’ top-order collapsed without much purpose. Opener Parvez Hossain Emon scored 16 off 12 balls to fashion a quick start.

But India’s change of attacking options nulled any threat posed by the Bangladesh batters. Seven Indian bowlers picked up wickets, with Reddy and Chakravarthy leading the way.

Bangladesh was down to 46-4 in 6.5 overs. Only five of its batters reached double figures and Mahmudullah top scored with 41 off 39 balls to save his side embarrassment.

The second-best score was 16 by Emon, and by Mehidy Hasan Miraz in the middle order, outlining why the visitors never stood a chance in this tall chase.

Reddy was named player of the match for his all-round performance.

“I feel great to represent India and it is a proud moment for me. I want to give credit to the captain and coach (Gautam Gambhir),” he said. “They gave me the license to play my shots and I took my time. I want to continue playing this way for India.”
