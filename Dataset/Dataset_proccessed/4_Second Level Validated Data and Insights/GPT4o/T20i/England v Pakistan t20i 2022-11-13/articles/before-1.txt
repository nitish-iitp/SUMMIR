England have stamped themselves cricket's white-ball kings after withstanding Pakistan's fearsome pace attack to win the T20 World Cup final by five wickets at the MCG.

Star all-rounder Ben Stokes once again proved himself the ultimate big-game player, steering England home with six balls to spare in the face of Pakistan's fast-bowling brilliance.

Stokes hit the winning run to finish unbeaten on 51 and ensure England claimed their second T20 World Cup title and first since 2010.

They are the first team to hold the ODI and T20 World Cups at the same time after their memorable win over New Zealand in the 2019 50-over final at Lord's.

Predicted rain failed to arrive and interrupt Sunday night's blockbuster decider as 80,462 fans turned out for a rematch of the 1992 ODI World Cup final at the same venue.

England were in the box-seat after captain Jos Buttler won the toss and elected to field first, restricting Pakistan to just 8-137.

An explosive spell from tearaway quick Haris Rauf threatened to put Pakistan back in the contest as he dismissed number three Phil Salt and Buttler in quick succession to have the MCG rocking.

Shaheen Afridi took a superb catch to dismiss Harry Brook and have England reeling at 4-84 but the star Pakistani quick hurt himself in the process and was unable to bowl his crucial remaining two overs.

Momentum swung back towards England when Afridi went off the field, as Stokes played the starring role just like he did in the ODI final three years ago.

Moeen Ali (19) played a vital cameo role with Stokes but was bowled within five runs of victory.

Earlier, left-arm seamer Sam Curran put in a crucial spell of 3-12 from his four overs, continuing an impressive tournament for the 24-year-old Englishman.

Curran was able to remove the composed Shan Masood, forcing the middle-order batter into a rash shot when caught on the boundary for 38.

He also claimed Mohammad Rizwan (15), bowling the explosive opener for England's first wicket of the match.

Legspinner Adil Rashid was equally influential, finishing with 2-22 including the vital wicket of Mohammad Haris with his first ball.

Rashid's next scalp was even more important, as he dismissed dangerous Pakistan captain Babar Azam (32) during an over that turned out to be a wicket-maiden.

Stokes endured a nervous start with the new ball, sending down a no-ball and a wide with the first two deliveries of the game.

But it was all England after that, silencing the pro-Pakistan crowd by taking regular wickets and limiting their ability to find the boundary.

England and Pakistan both took unchanged teams into the decider after peaking at the right end of the tournament.

Key England fast bowler Mark Wood (hip) and batter Dawid Malan (groin) were again left out after struggling with injury.

Despite a forecast of heavy showers and possible storms, rain did not disrupt the match.

England are world champions

By Simon Smale

OK, we're going to wrap things up here.

Congratulations to England, who aside from a "blip" against Ireland, have been so superb in this form of the game over the last couple of years.

Deserving champions? You'd have to say so.

But let's not forget the role that Pakistan played.

Two narrow defeats in their opening two games but then, surged through to the final off the back of the best pace attack in world T20 cricket.

England though take the spoils and are now the standard bearers for white ball cricket.

They're setting the bar. It's time for others to step up and match them now.

Thanks for being with us this evening and throughout the tournament.

Good evening.

Ben Stokes 'the ultimate competitor': Jos Buttler

By Simon Smale

"He's the ultimate competitor in anything he does," Buttler says.

"He's got a hell of a lot of experience to bank on as well, he can take a lot on his shoulders and at times you think it must be time for him to go and get us over that line so he timed it perfectly."

Jos Buttler: 'immensely proud'

By Simon Smale

"I'm just immensely proud of everyone here," he says.

He says the team has been through plenty of changes and that the side are "reaping the rewards" from the changes that were made over time.

"Matthew Mott's doing alright, isn't he?" he says.

"He's fitting in really well.

"We've got quite a few Australians with us this tournament.

"He gives the players great freedom."

He credits Adil Rashid's wicket maiden in the 12th over was key.

Congratulations to England: Babar Azam

By Simon Smale

Here's the Pakistan skipper, Babar Azam.

"First of all, congratulations to England, they deserved to be champion," he says.

He said it felt like being at home such was the support throughout all their matches.

"The way this team has played in the last four matches is incredible and all credit to my team."

He says he told his players to be free to play their own game and they were just a few runs short.

"Our bowling is one of the best attacks in the world," he says.

He notes that Shaheen's injury is just part of the game.

Sam Curran is player of the tournament

By Simon Smale

A panel and public vote has chosen Sam Curran as player of the tournament too.

"I'm a little bit lost for words," he says.

Sam Curran is player of the match

By Simon Smale

He took 3-12.

"I don't think I should be getting this," he says.

"The way Stokesy played there, to get a fifty in a final, he does it so many times for us.

"It's very special ... World champions, how good?!"

Curran is asked about how Stokes, who bowled the final over the last time England were in a T20 World Cup final and got bashed around as England lost to the West Indies, will be feeling after this match-winning performance.

"I think he's someone I've always looked up to, he always turns up when the team needs him.

"People question him but there's no questioning him, he's unbelievable."

Alex Hales: 'It's an incredibly special feeling'

By Simon Smale

Alex Hales, who missed the last world cup triumph after being kicked off the squad for off field issues, seems relieved.

"I definitely didn't think it would come around again," Hales says.

"It's an incredibly special feeling.

The last six or eight weeks have been incredible, being back involved and this is the icing on the cake."

Bowlers won us the game: Ben Stokes

By Simon Smale

England's hero Ben Stokes is speaking.

(Getty Images)

"I think in finals, especially chasing probably you forget all that hard work before that," he says.

"I thought the way that we bowled ... especially Adil Rashid and Sam Curran, that's what won us the game."

He says the Ireland result was put behind them and just a blip and that the best teams move on from set backs.

Adam Gilchrist is asking the questions, he asks how it compares to Lord's in 2019.

"Representing your country, World Cups, it's amazing, but this has been a good one."

13 Nov 2022, 11:45am
The occasion played a role in the nerves: Woakes

By Simon Smale

Chris Woakes is still speaking.

"I think the wicket offered a little bit to the quick bowler," he says.

"But I think the occasion plays into that as well.

"Generally it's probably a 160 pitch but the occasion gets the better of people and rightly so."

By Simon Smale

"It was a phenomenal day," he adds.

Chris Woakes says it's "amazing".
