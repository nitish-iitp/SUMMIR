England's Chris Woakes:"We have lost a lot of games in Australia but to win here at the MCG is amazing.

"I think the wicket offered a bit to the bowlers but the occasion also plays into that. It was probably a 160-pitch, but all that matters is the result."

'Franchise cricket has helped England'

Former England all-rounder on BBC Test Match Special

England have always been a very good one-day team. They are now one of the smartest - in the past they were probably guilty of not being smart and not being willing to adapt to conditions and siutations, but the way players talk about the game and the way players develop in franchise tournaments.

Those tournaments have really improved English players and cricket. They've learnt to be smarter and more adaptable because of playing in different conditions and playing against other streetwise cricketers.

England all-rounder Moeen Ali to Sky Sports: "This is one of the best days of my career. We deserved it over along period of time, we've played some amazing cricket but fell short in the semis last year. Now we have done it against an amazing Pakistan side in front of all these fans.

England opener Alex Hales: "I definitely didn't think playing for England would come around again. The last 6-8 weeks have been so enjoyable and this is the icing on the cake."

England batter Harry Brook: "So good. A lot of people would not expect to win a World Cup at 23 but being in this squad I always thought we would win it. We showed the world how good we are.

You can't be perfect throughout the tournament, you are going to make mistakes, and England's came at the right time.

They've woke up as a sleeping lion after that. They've been aggressive since then and they've blown everyone else off the park.

They've been the best team. Nobody has been the same class as England and the right team are lifting the trophy.

It has been one of the best T20 World Cups.

The upsets that have been involved have been brilliant and it has kept everybody on their toes.

There was never a stage where the group was finalised and that is a great place to be in a World Cup.

It has been a fantastic World Cup. There have been some low scores too, which you want, because you don't want 200 plays 200 all the time. It was an even field.

'Buttler has created his own legacy'
published at 12:59 Greenwich Mean Time 13 November 2022
12:59 GMT 13 November 2022

England all-rounder Ben Stokes to Sky Sports: "The way the bowlers bowled meant we didn't feel under too much pressure with the run chase. It never felt out of our hands.

"So I just tried to stay there as long as possible. It is a lot easier when you have a batter who is in at the end of the innings.

"It was never panic stations when it is eight an over, and when Moeen came in it went to a run a ball. There is always a time when you have to attack an over and unfortunately for Pakistan it was when Sheen went off, which was a real shame.

"Everyone knows the way Jos and Alex Hales play. Even when we lost Hales early on Jos kept on going, putting them under pressure.

"The depth we have means we can take it deep in these run chases. We are blessed at the moment with the amount of talent we have in this format.

"We are old enough and wise enough to go into any situation and back ourselves. This format is fickle with bat and ball. You just take everything that comes in practice and the nets and make sure you go into the game without any doubts."

On Jos Buttler: "He has really taken control of his side and created his own legacy. He is an incredible guy who everyone follows. It should not be taken for granted how hard it is to make tactical decisions in this format, but 95% of his decisions he has got right. And we know what he is like with the bat. We are lucky to have him."

One of the great things to come from this World Cup is the teams we thought were the lesser teams, we've seen how much they've improved. The likes of Ireland and Zimbabwe have caught up - I just want to say a massive well done to them.

More from England head coach Matthew Mott speaking to BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra: "It is very special for me. Any World Cup is a special event. We wanted to turn up today and put on a show and enjoy it, but you never like to compare any of them but they were all certainly great fun. We'll enjoy tonight with the boys because we've put in a lot of work to get to this point. The coaching staff have really set this up well so we're really excited.

"Adil Rashid has been unbelievable in the last few days. In Pakistan he learnt a few lessons against these guys and it held him in good stead and he slowed it down perfectly on this pitch. He is a real match-winner.

"I am really pleased for Sam Curran. There were a few times we left him out in the summer and he was really disappointed to miss out but he reacted in the right way and came back really strong and delivered on the world sage. He's been an absolute boom for our team."

England's Sam Curran, who was named Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament: "This is very special. I don't think I should be getting this (player of the match) the way Stokesy played, to get a 50 in the final. We are going to enjoy this occasion.

"I knew my into-the-wicket-type bowling would work. The pitch was not as good as we thought it would be. But we saw how well the Pakistan bowlers bowled so it was a challenge for the batters definitely.

"The way I bowl in this type of ground, I go into the wicket with my slower balls to keep the batters guessing."

On Ben Stokes: "He is incredibly special. He is someone I have always looked up to. He always turns up when the team needs him to. There is no quesitoning him. He is the man,

On being named Player of the Tournament: "I am a little bit lost for words. It has been a great tournament for us. Amazing, It is my first World Cup. Thank you to our amazing fans who came out tonight.

"Coming into this tournament I wanted to be adaptable, I haven't bowled at the death as much. I want to improve with the bat. I'm always looking to improve. But I'm not thinking about that now as we are world champions!"

Pakistan captain Babar Azam: "First of all congratulations to England, they deserve to be champions.

"We felt at home. Everyone who has come to support us at every venue, thank you so much.

"The first two games we lost but the way the team bounced back was unbelievable, credit to my team."

On what he said to the players before the game: "I just said to play your natural game, play with freedom. But we were 20 runs short.

"Our bowling is one of the best attacks in the world and we started well in the first six overs. Unfortunately Shaheen injured himself. It may have been a different result, but it is part of the game."

'The boys held their nerve'

England coach Matthew Mott to Sky Sports: "I would like to say it was easy but we did it the hard way. The boys held their nerve and got a great result.

"We were pretty confident after 10 overs. We couldn't lay bat on ball for a bit. We always knew we were one big over away from breaking the game and that's how it turned out."

On Ben Stokes: "If there is one player you wanted out there is is Ben. He took a bit of flak before the tournament but he is a match-winner in every tournament and he steadied the ship tonight."

On Adil Rashid: "He has been exceptional. He has improved with every game. Whenever you need a wicket he is the man you turn to.

Sam Curran has been a revelation. We left him out over the summer and he was disappointed with that, but he coped with it in the best way."

More from England's Ben Stokes speaking to BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra: "I didn't really take in the fact that we were the first men's team to hold both trophies till you really said it. It just shows where we are as a team. We all know the talent that we possess. We all have clarity from Jos [Buttler] and the team's management about what we want to do as a team and when you're clear what the team ethos is it makes it a lot easier.

"I am very proud. You don't get to win World Cups too often so to win two of them is pretty special."

Are achievements measured by statistics alone? It's about what you win, isn't it? For that alone, Stokes has few who can match him.

More from Jos Buttler: "I thought when you hit the right lengths there was a little but of seam movement and the Pakistan bowlers were bowilng a good pace. It certainly wasn't easy.

"We got away to a decent start which controlled the run rate. We bat deep as well. And that man Ben Stokes is there again at the end.

"He is the ultimate competitor in anything he does. He has a hell of a lot of experience now as well. He can take a lot on his shoulders. And the way him and Moeen Ali played took it away from Pakistan."
