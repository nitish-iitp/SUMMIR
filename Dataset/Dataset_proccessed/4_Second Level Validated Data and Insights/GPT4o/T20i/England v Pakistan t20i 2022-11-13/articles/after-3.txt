It’s a wrap

For Pakistan, the eerie similarities to 1992 fell short towards the end. Outplayed in the first half, they clawed their way back with the ball but just didn’t have enough runs on the board… and had Stokes to counter.

England, meanwhile, kept rolling. Fourteen off three balls after Afridi’s injury changed it all.

From us, it’s a thank you and goodbye.

Worthy champions

England is now the first team to hold both white-ball World Cups. Their brand of attacking cricket has transformed the way the game is played in this format. Crucially, it’s a style that’s become so ingrained in the team’s mentality that it isn’t affected by changes in personnel. There’s been a change in captain and coach since their win in the 2019 ODI World Cup but the approach remains the same.

They were always in control of this final. Sam Curran was the standout performer, but there were important contributions from numerous players – Rashid, Stokes, Ali, Jordan – strewn across the XI.

They’ve already picked up two World Cup medals, and if they keep playing the same way, there’ll be a few more to come.

Sam Curran chosen as Player of the Tournament

A three-for in the final, the only bowler with a five-wicket haul in the World Cup and 13 wickets across the tournament.

Sam Curran, who was also the Man of the Match in the final, also picks up the Player of the Tournament award.

Just a reminder that he’s only 24.

Plaudits pour in for the white-ball kings

Since that night in 2015, England's record in ICC mens white-ball events:

Finalists in '16
Semi-finalists in '17
Winners in '19
Semi-finalists in '21
Winners in '22

Turnaround has been spoken of many times, but it's an achievement of which English cricket should be hugely proud

Well prepared , quiet, consistent , no egos…. Winners @englandcricket

England become the first men's side to hold both the 50-over and T20 World Cups at the same time. Deserved, too. Led the way in LO cricket for 7 or so years. But Pakistan heroic with the ball. And desperately unlucky.

Ben Stokes, the man for the big occasions

Running out of words for Ben Stokes. What a player! What a champion!

This was his first 50 in T20Is, couldn’t have picked a better game to get it in. An unbelievable redemption arc as well, given what he went through in the 2016 final against West Indies.

Just six runs off that Haris Rauf over. But, he’s finished his quota now and England have things under control.
