More from Ben Stokes

[What is it about you and World Cup finals?] Dunno. Good fun to play in though. It was weird: it felt like the wicket got harder as the ball got older. I made sure I stayed there as long as I possibly could; it’s never really panic stations when it’s under eight an over.

The way Mo played got us down to a run a ball. Yeah, decent, decent. There was always gonna be a time when he had to attack an over, and unfortunately for Pakistan Shaheen had to go off. It was obvious what we had to do – that over was the big one.

There’s an endearing human side to this England team, and many of them are on the field with their families. As I type, Jos Buttler is holding his child and hugging his mum. I assume it’s his mum. It’s such a charming scene, almost enough to make you shed a wee tear.

“Ben Stokes is a ridiculous human being,” says Matt Dony. “He’s just different. He has that intangible quality that just makes things happen around him. I don’t understand it, but it’s there. Some artists have that same influence and ability to make things bend to their will. You could surround Bob Dylan by almost any band, and he would make them sound like ‘Bob Dylan’s band’. The charisma and X-factor to control and direct his surroundings and stamp his authority over it. Stokes does that to sport. The whole field, both teams, the whole situation, just bent to his will.”

ENGLAND ARE WORLD T20 CHAMPIONS!

Jos Buttler walks over to join his teammates, silly grin plastered all over his face, and lifts the World T20 trophy to the heavens!

Four months ago they were struggling after series defeats to India and South Africa. Hell, four games ago they were struggling. But they delivered when it mattered, producing one devastating performance to batter India and holding their nerve in three tight ones against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

As in 2019, they recovered from a worrying blip to win the last four games, with no margin for error. Oh, and Ben Stokes took care of business when it mattered. It would be wrong to call him a big-game player; he’s a huge-game player.

Jos Buttler speaks

I’m immensely proud of everyone here. Matthew Mott’s doing alright, isn’t he? This felt a long way away after the Ireland game, but the character we showed in must-win games has been amazing.

[Mott] has fitted in really well. He gives the players great freedom and allows us to to out and trust ourselves.

Adil has been outstanding in the last three games especially. He’s always been the guy we throw the ball to to make something happen.

The chase wasn’t easy at all. When you hit the right length there was a bit of seam movement – they were very attacking and obviously bowled at good pace. That man again was there for us, Ben Stokes. He’s the ultimate competitor in everything he does. He has a lot of experience and can take everything on his shoulders. The impetus he and Moeen Ali showed just took the game away.

First of all congratulations to England – they are deserved champions. It felt like home so thank you to all the supporters. We were 20 runs short but the way we fought until the last over was unbelievable – all credit to the boys. Our bowling attack is one of the best in the world. Unfortunately Shaheen got injured and it cost us. Maybe it would have been a different result, but that’s part of the game.

Now the Pakistan team walk up to receive their runners-up medals. They made the tournament infinitely more interesting, as they always do, and some of their fast bowling on a spicy pitch tonight was dangerously exhilarating. Naseem Shah’s figures of 4-0-30-0 are an utter scandal.

While Sky are showing replays of Stokes’s innings, Jos Buttler charges over to rugby tackle his best mate and predecessor Eoin Morgan. Buttler doesn’t let his hair down often, which makes it an even more beautiful sight (or in this case sound, a grunt of surprise from Morgan) when he does.

Sam Curran is also the player of the tournament!

It’s amazing. We’ve won a World Cup in front of these amazing fans! Thank you to everyone who came out tonight.

I wanted to be adaptable coming into this tournament. I haven’t bowled at the death much in my career and that\s something I want to keep working on, the same with my batting. I’m not thinking about that now – we’re world champs, how good?!

Curran finished with 13 wickets at 11.38. Only Wanindu Hasaranga, who played two extra games, took more. For somebody who bowls at the death, his economy rate of 6.52 is outstanding.

Sam Curran is the player of the match for his spell of 4-0-12-3

I don’t think I should be getting us – the way Stokesy played there, he always does it in finals. We felt the wicket wasn’t as good as we thought it would be. We saw how well Pakistan bowled and it was a tough chase.

On this type of ground I go into the wicket with my slower balls and just to try to keep the batsmen guessing. I don’t actually… world champions, how good!

[Ben Stokes] is somebody I’ve always looked up to. He’s the man.

It was so sweet the way Curran jumped straight into Stokes’s arms at the end of the game, simultaneously his fanboy and his peer.

You have to feel for Pakistan, who bowled sensationally at times, particularly Naseem Shah. The injury to Shaheen Shah Afridi, who hurt his knee while catching Harry Brook, may well have decided the game. We’ll never know.

Iftikhar Ahmed has to finish Afridi’s over, and Stokes belted his last two deliveries for 10. That turned the game at a time when England needed 38 from 26 balls and were in a bit of bother.

GONE! Harry Brook ❌

Ben Stokes, cricket adores you

Thank you mate [he’s talking to Adam Gilchrist, not us]. I thought the way we bowled; that’s what won us the game. That was a tricky wicket with a bit of bounce; you never felt like you were in.

With the Ireland defeat being so early in the competition, we had to address it, say what we said and then let it go. In tournaments you can’t carry baggage with you. The best teams learn from their mistakes, take on the chin and move on to the next challenge. It’s a pretty good evening!

The England players all run to Stokes, a serial winner who gets high on the kind of pressure that sends 99 per cent of humans into the bunker.

We thought Stokes’s scriptwriter had retired at the end of 2019, his work done. Wrong! Stokes fooled us all by batting like a clown in the games that didn’t matter, and then like a nerveless genius in the ones that did. Of all the gin joints in all the world, Stokes made his first ever T20I fifty in front of 90,000 people at the MCG.

It was such a cruel blow: for him, for Pakistan, for the whole game. But it is part of the game, and England won’t apologise this time if they win.

A huge over for England ends with Moeen top-edging Wasim over the keeper’s head from four. Sixteen from it, and England need 12 from 18 balls. They are this close to making history as the first men’s team to be ODI and T20 world champions at the same.

Afridi leaves the field through injury

15.1 overs: England 97-4 (target 138; Stokes 28, Ali 3) Afridi is really struggling. He aborts his run up, then beats Ali with a half-ratpower delivery. That’s the only injury he’s going to bowl – he limps off to a standing ovation from the Pakistan fans, and the rest of the over will be bowled by the occasional offspinner Iftikhar.

“On a rail replacement bus, running 40 minutes late trying to plan my revised route home whilst tracking Englands’s progress,” writes Kerry Haselup. “Nail biting doesn’t come into it. Come on Stokesy.”

15th over: England 97-4 (target 138; Stokes 28, Ali 3) Stokes cuts Haris Rauf this far short of Shan Masood at backward point. Then he survives an appeal for caught behind after missing an attempted slog. Pakistan have only one review and Babar doesn’t risk it. Replays show it’s the correct decision.

After taking punches all over, Stokes buzzes Haris Rauf by clattering the last ball through extra cover for four. England really needed that. They need 41 from 30 balls, and Shaheen Shah Afridi is going to try to bowl.

14th over: England 89-4 (target 138; Stokes 21, Ali 1) Another run-out chance! Stokes is sent back, slips and is just short when the throw from mid-on flashes past the stumps.

Moeen Ali, not always the best in nervy runchases, pulls Naseem in the air but safely for a single. Stokes can barely lay a bat on Naseem, who ends a memorable spell with scandalously unjust figures of 4-0-30-0.

England are now only three runs ahead on DLS. They need 49 from 36 balls – and Shaheen Shah Afridi is back on the field. That’s a huge boost for Pakistan, who are now arguably favourites. He’s still limping, mind you.

This is incredible stuff. And you thought the tension of 2019 was a one-off.

STOKES IS NOT OUT!

12th over: England 82-3 (target 138; Stokes 18, Brook 18) It was a wonderful delivery, which roared off the seam and was extremely close to the edge – but there’s nothing on Ultra-Edge and Stokes survives.

Naseem Shah is 19 years old, and he is bowling one of the great wicketless spells. England need 56 from 48 balls.

PAKISTAN REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND AGAINST STOKES!

Haris Rauf is back on the field. Naseem Shah returns to the attack and beats Brook with consecutive deliveries. The first exploded from the pitch; the second trampolined over Brook’s wild yahoo.

Stokes walks down the pitch in an attempt to calm Brook down, and then Brook muscles a pull over midwicket for three. Haris Rauf does unbelievably well to save a run with a sprawling stop.

Naseem Shah is bowling a scintillating spell. Stokes plays and misses at three consecutive deliveries; by my count Naseem has beaten the bat 10 times in three overs.

Hang on, Babar has gone for the review with that last delivery…

11th over: England 79-3 (target 138; Stokes 18, Brook 15) Brook survives a run-out chance after backing up too far. Stokes drove Shadab to mid-off, where Nawaz’s stopped the ball superbly but then threw off target. Brook would have been miles out. Just two runs from an excellent over. England need 59 from 54 balls. I don’t have time to type the DLS par score every over, but if England slip behind it I’ll let you know. Oh what the hell, the par score is 71.

10th over: England 77-3 (target 138; Stokes 17, Brook 14) Stokes times a low full toss through extra cover for four, an outstanding stroke. This is sensible, low-risk cricket from Stokes and Brook. It was always likely to be a runchase full of moodswings, and for the moment England’s world is relatively calm.

Saying which, Brook is sent back by Stokes and has to scramble to make his ground. We’ve had 10 overs which means there will be a result one way or another. England, who are 12 runs ahead on DLS, need 61 from 60 balls.

9th over: England 69-3 (target 138; Stokes 11, Brook 12) Stokes would normally focus on taking the game deep, but DLS makes that a little more complicated. In the 2019 final, England were probably behind on DLS from overs 19.3 to 49.4.

Stokes gets his first boundary in fortunate style, under-edging a reverse sweep down the leg side. Eight from the over. England are nine runs ahead on DLS; they need 69 from 66 balls.

8th over: England 61-3 (target 138; Stokes 5, Brook 10) The fourth paceman, Mohammad Wasim, is on for the first time. Stokes charges his first ball and cuts it for a single.

England are slightly ahead on DLS, though that will change if they lose another wicket. Every little helps, and Wasim bowls consecutive wides before Brook whips two to cow corner. He’s started with admirable serenity for a young player who had such a difficult tournament.

The moment I type that, of course, he misses an attempted drive over extra cover from outside leg stump. The last ball kicks to hit him painfully on the right elbow, and there’s a delay while he receives treatment. This is quite some pace attack that Pakistan have.

“I am sitting on a French island in the South Pacific (New Caledonia ) so no chance of coverage of cricket on French TV,” says Terence Ayres. “Really glad you are there!”

I’d be really glad if I was there too.

7th over: England 54-3 (target 138; Stokes 3, Brook 7) It’s time for the legspinner Shadab Khan. Adil Rashid got a lot out of this pitch, so he should be a threat. His second ball beats Brook, and there are five runs from a (relatively) quiet over.

In other news, Haris Rauf has left the field. Adam Gilchrist says he was followed by a couple of the backroom staff, so either he has a niggle or there’s a really important horse race on in the next five minutes.

6th over: England 49-3 (target 138; Stokes 1, Brook 4) Drum and bass is having a bit of a revival, and I believe, and that fresh track you can hear is Harry Brook’s heartbeat.

He defends his first ball calmly and then flicks stylishly through midwicket for four. Lovely shot.

DLS can’t come into play until there have been at least 10 overs, but as things stand the par score after six overs is 45.

“Atherton, Smith and Bishop,” says Laurence Boyd of the commentary team who have just handed over. “Just brilliant, desert island commentators for me.”

I love them all, but I couldn’t leave Nasser at home.

WICKET! England 44-3 (Buttler c Rizwan b Buttler 26)

Stokes drives the ball back to Haris Rauf, who collects and fakes as it to throw back at the batter. This is his home ground in the BBL, and he’s behaving like he owns the place.

And that’s why! He has picked up the biggest wicket of them all! Buttler felt instinctively for a very sharp delivery – he didn’t need to play - and nicked it through to Rizwan. That’s another Test-match dismissal in coloured clothing, and Buttler goes after a white-knuckle ride of 26 from 17. balls. It is well and truly on!

5th over: England 43-2 (target 138; Buttler 26, Stokes 0) Naseem Shah beats Buttler outside off stump three times in four balls; with the other going for four wides down the leg side. Told you Pakistan were merculiar.

Babar belatedly brings in a slip. Buttler has the nerve, the skill and the genitalia to walk across and scoop the next delivery off middle stump for six. That is an outrageous stroke.

Naseem beats Buttler twice more – that’s five in the over - to end maybe the best of the tournament. How good is this? If Pakistan get Buttler, it’s well and truly on.

4th over: England 32-2 (target 138; Buttler 20, Stokes 0) Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes are at the crease in a World Cup final again. Stokes offers no stroke to his first ball, a sizzler that only just misses off stump. Good judgement, I think.

He knew sweet bugger all about the next delivery, though, which snapped off the seam to beat him off the inside. Pakistan are on one.

“If it was Australia or India chasing down this total we’d think the game was basically over,” says Bob O’Hara. “But this is England, who can always find a way. It makes me feel almost patriotic.”

WICKET! England 32-2 (Salt c Iftikhar b Haris 10)

Haris Rauf strikes in his first over! Salt, who looked a bit jittery, slugs a pull straight to midwicket and goes for 10 from nine balls. This isn’t over, not by a long chalk.
