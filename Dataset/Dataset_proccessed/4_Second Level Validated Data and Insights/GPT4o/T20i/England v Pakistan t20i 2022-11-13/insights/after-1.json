        "England all-rounder Moeen Ali: 'This is one of the best days of my career. We deserved it over a long period of time, we've played some amazing cricket but fell short in the semis last year. Now we have done it against an amazing Pakistan side in front of all these fans.'",
        "England opener Alex Hales: 'I definitely didn't think playing for England would come around again. The last 6-8 weeks have been so enjoyable and this is the icing on the cake.'",

        "England all-rounder Ben Stokes: 'The way the bowlers bowled meant we didn't feel under too much pressure with the run chase. It never felt out of our hands.'",
        "England's Sam Curran: 'This is very special. I don't think I should be getting this (player of the match) the way Stokesy played, to get a 50 in the final. We are going to enjoy this occasion.'",

        "England coach Matthew Mott: 'I would like to say it was easy but we did it the hard way. The boys held their nerve and got a great result.'"
