Wrist injury kept Ruturaj Gaikwad out of first T20I against SL | BCCI

After the Indian playing XI was revealed for the first T20I against Sri Lanka at Lucknow, many wondered because the name of opener Ruturaj Gaikwad was missing. Gaikwad is currently vying for the opening slot with Ishan Kishan.

He played in the 3rd T20I against West Indies, and though failed, was expected to continue opening for India with Ishan Kishan, as the team management continue to experiment in absence of KL Rahul.

However, Rohit Sharma revealed at the toss that Ruturaj Gaikwad was supposed to play in this match.

He said: “Ruturaj was initially supposed to play but he has got some wrist issue. So he is not available for this game."

Now, this has been confirmed by the BCCI as well, as injuries continue to haunt the Indian contingent as after Deepak Chahar and Suryakumar Yadav, Ruturaj Gaikwad has suffered a wrist injury.

“Ruturaj Gaikwad complained of pain in his right wrist, which is affecting his batting. He was unavailable for selection for the first T20I. The BCCI Medical Team is examining him,” BCCI tweeted.

India was asked to bat first after Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka won the toss. India made six changes from the last game with Sanju Samson, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Ravindra Jadeja coming in, and Deepak Hooda making his T20I debut.
