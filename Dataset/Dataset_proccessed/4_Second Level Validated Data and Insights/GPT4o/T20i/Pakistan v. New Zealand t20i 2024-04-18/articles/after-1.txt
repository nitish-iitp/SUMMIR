The Black Caps have been blown away by Pakistan by seven wickets in the second T20 international in Rawalpindi.

Pakistan bowled the inexperienced New Zealand side out for just 90 runs, and chased down the total in 12.1 overs.

Shaheen Shah Afridi led the Pakistan attack with 3-13 while Mohammad Amir finished with 2-13. Abrar Ahmed and Shadab Khan took two wickets each.

New Zealand was sent in to bat with openers Tim Seifert and Tim Robinson out cheaply for 12 and 4 respectively.

The highest score for the Black Caps came from the bat of Mark Chapman with 19, with New Zealand bowled out in 18.1 overs.

New Zealand's 90 runs was never going to be enough, with Pakistan's Mohammed Rizwan scoring an unbeaten 45 off just 34 balls to anchor the chase.

Black Caps captain Michael Bracewell said the Rawalpindi pitch was not an easy one to handle.

"We didn't score quite enough runs," Bracewell said.

"We were little bit slow to adapt to the surface and put ourselves under pressure there."

With a short turnaround ahead of Monday's T20, also at Rawalpindi, he said the players would need to learn quickly.

"One of the things we pride ourselves on as Black Caps is fighting right til the end," he said.

"We did that tonight particularly with the bowling and in the field, we'll reflect on that tonight and move onto the next game."

Pakistan has taken a 1-0 lead in the five match series. The series opener was abandoned due to rain.
