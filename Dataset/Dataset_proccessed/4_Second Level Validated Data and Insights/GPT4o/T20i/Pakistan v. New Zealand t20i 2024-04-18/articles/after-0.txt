The Black Caps have levelled the T20 series with Pakistan after winning the third game in Rawalpindi by seven wickets.

New Zealand chased down their target of 179 with 10 balls to spare thanks to an unbeaten 87 from Mark Chapman.

It was a clinical performance by the tourists after they crumbled to be all out for 90 just 24 hours earlier.

After being asked to bat first Pakistan made 178 for four with Shadab Khan top-scoring with 41, while Ish Sodhi took 2/25.

The Black Caps started their chase strongly with Tim Robinson and Tim Seifert putting on 42 for the opening partnership.

Chapman and Dean Foxcroft then put on 117 for the third wicket with Foxcroft scoring 31.

The game turned in their favour in the 15th and 16th overs when they managed to score 40 runs off two of Pakistan's most experienced bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.

Chapman and James Neesham then got the tourists home with Chapman's 87 coming off 42 balls and included nine fours and four sixes.

"I think we know Pakistan have a great attack, 178 was a chase-able score, generally it's high scoring here," Chapman said, speaking on the ground afterwards.

"Debutants bowled some tough overs and Ish was outstanding.

"Yesterday it was slower and we lost wickets in clumps... you have 100 partnership, you give yourself a good chance to win.

"The way Siefert and Robinson set it up, we had a platform and we just tried to keep up with the rate, we knew they have world class attack."

The fourth and fifth games are in Lahore next weekend.
