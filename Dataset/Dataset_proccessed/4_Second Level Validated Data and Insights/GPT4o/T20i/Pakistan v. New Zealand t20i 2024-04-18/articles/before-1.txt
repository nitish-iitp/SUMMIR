Broadcast and Live streaming details

Pakistan are gearing up to host New Zealand in a T20 International (T20I) series starting on April 18. Babar Azam, who was recently reinstated as Pakistan’s white-ball captain, will lead his team in the series.

For New Zealand, Michael Bracewell will take on the role of captain as several senior players are unavailable for the tour due to their commitments to the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024.

This series also marks the return of Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim to international cricket. Both players had previously announced their retirements but have made their comebacks and are vying for a place in Pakistan’s squad for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024.

This will mark New Zealand’s third visit to Pakistan within the past 17 months. Their first trip took place from December 2022 to January 2023, during which they played two Test matches and three One-Day Internationals. Their second visit happened in April 2023 for a white-ball series.Test match tickets
