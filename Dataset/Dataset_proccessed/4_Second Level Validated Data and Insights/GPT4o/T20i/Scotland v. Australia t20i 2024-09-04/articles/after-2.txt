In short:

Australia has made light work of Scotland in the first of three T20 matches.

The visitors took less than 10 overs to chase Scotland's 9-154, winning the match by seven wickets.

What's next?

Australia plays two more T20I matches against Scotland, before facing England in three T20s and five ODIs.

Travis Head and Mitch Marsh clubbed a world record T20 international powerplay score with a brutal display of hitting as Australia launched their white-ball UK tour by thrashing Scotland with more than half their overs to spare.

Head made 80 in 25 balls and Marsh 39 in 12 as the pair racked up 113 in the six over powerplay, surpassing the 102 made by South Africa against the West Indies last year.

That enabled Australia to overhaul the 9-154 Scotland had made in the first of three T20s at the Grange, Edinburgh, in 9.4 overs.

But the assault came after Jake Fraser-McGurk's long-awaited debut had ended in failure, the young gun being caught for a third-ball duck holing out to mid-wicket.

Marsh prodded Brandon McMullen's next ball just past gully's outstretched right hand, but if that start gave Scotland hope of an upset it was swiftly dispelled.

Head took three boundaries off the next over, two fours and two sixes off the third, and two fours and a six off the fourth taking him to 47 off 16 balls.

At this point Marsh had made eight from five. The fifth over he hit 6,6,4,6,4,4.

Next over, it was Head's turn again. That went 4,6,4,4,4,4, in the process equalling Marcus Stoinis' Australian record for a fastest T20I 50, reaching it off his 17th ball.

"Nice way to get underway," Head said. 

"I was a little nervous coming in, we've had a bit of a break, so nice for me and the captain to get some runs. That's my role, to maximise the powerplay and I think we did that."

That was it for a partnership that had sent the ball into neighbouring parks and tennis courts as Marsh was caught off the next delivery, bowled by Mark Watt.

Watt's trick is to bowl from 25 yards, and the next ball he did, hitting the stumps as Josh Inglis stepped away. To boos from the crowd a dead ball was the verdict. The decision was later clarified as correct by the MCC, but Inglis had appeared to be ready and watching when Watt bowled.

Head was caught in the same over but the contest was long done. Inglis (27 off 13) and Stoinis (eight off five) finished the match off.

Earlier Australia's pace bowlers, inexperienced at international level, adapted swiftly to conditions to put the brakes on the home side who had raced to 1-46 after five overs after being sent in to bat.

Bowling into the pitch, taking pace off and using cutters they squeezed the run-rate.

Sean Abbott, called into the squad when Spencer Johnson was ruled out, took 3-39, though Xavier Bartlett was the pick with 2-23 from his four overs.

Adam Zampa (2-33) and Riley Meredith (2-34) also delivered their full complement while Cam Green (1-12) and Stoinis (0-10) shared a quota.

Bartlett made an early breakthrough when Oli Hairs miscued a pull and was caught by Marsh.

But with George Munsey clearing the ropes three times Scotland were eyeing a challenging score when Inglis took a superb flying catch off Abbott to dismiss him for 28 off 25 and Bartlett picked up Brandon McMullen (19 off 22), caught by debutant Fraser Jake-McGurk.

Thereafter wickets fell regularly.

"In a three -match tournament it's very important to win the first game," Marsh said. 

"I thought all-round we had a great start to the series."

This is the first of 11 matches with Australia still to face England in three T20s and five ODIs.
