Scotland are all set to host Australia for the first time since the one-off ODI in 2013. This time, it will be a three-match T20I series from September 4 to 7. Grange Cricket Club in Edinburgh will be hosting all the games.

Scotland’s last assignment in the shortest format came at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. They failed to qualify for the Super 8 stage after finishing third in Group B.

Led by Richie Berrington, Scotland have named a strong side to face Australia in the T20I series. Berrington, George Munsey, Michael Jones and Matthew Cross form a solid batting line-up. Chris Greaves, Brad Wheal, Christopher Sole and Mark Watt are the experienced bowlers in the side.

The experienced players in Marsh, Travis Head, Tim David, Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis and Adam Zampa form the rest of the squad. They have a formidable squad and start as favorites series.
