        "Travis Head commented, 'Nice way to get underway. I was a little nervous coming in, we've had a bit of a break, so nice for me and the captain to get some runs. That's my role, to maximise the powerplay and I think we did that.'",
        "Mitch Marsh said, 'In a three-match tournament it's very important to win the first game. I thought all-round we had a great start to the series.'"

        "Bowling into the pitch, taking pace off and using cutters they squeezed the run-rate.",
        "Watt's trick is to bowl from 25 yards, and the next ball he did, hitting the stumps as Josh Inglis stepped away. To boos from the crowd a dead ball was the verdict. The decision was later clarified as correct by the MCC, but Inglis had appeared to be ready and watching when Watt bowled."
