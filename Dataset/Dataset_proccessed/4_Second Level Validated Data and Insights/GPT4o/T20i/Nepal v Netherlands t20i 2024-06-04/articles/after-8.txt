Goodbye for now

That’s it from Dallas and our live coverage of Nepal against Netherlands.

The Dutch wrap up a six-wicket win after a crucial call at the toss.

Nepal, who were bowled out for 106, will reflect heavily on dropped chances and “what ifs” in Netherlands’ chase.

Netherlands captain Scott Edwards admits winning the toss helped

“We got a bit of a read on the wicket, and our bowlers were good in the power play and then all throughout,” Edwards said at the post-match ceremony.

“Ideally we would have got that [chase] a little bit quicker and I got a little bit nervous at the end.

“But it’s a good performance moving forward and, for us to make it through, you have to play consistent cricket all the way through.”

Nepal captain Rohit Paudel reacts to defeat by Netherlands

“The overhead conditions were really challenging. Credit goes to the Netherlands bowling,” Paudel said at the post-match ceremony.

“As a batting unit we could have done better. I could have stretched it more.

“There was no partnership in between and that’s where Netherlands came back stronger.

“I tried to move in the crease to disturb their length and it was working for me so after the start, I could have done better.

“As a bowling unit we did well, we could have done better in the field – especially the last one I dropped [O’Dowd] and it could have been different.

“I want to thank all [the fans], we felt like we were playing in Nepal.”

The conditions didn’t help for Nepal

The difference in the conditions at the start of the match and at the start of the chase was stark.

Heavy clouds created overcast conditions for the seam bowlers as Nepal walked out to bat, while it was a sunny day throughout the Netherlands chase.

It was a big toss for Netherlands to win.

Pringle is named Player of the Match

“As a bowling group we just spoke about getting the surface in play and we hoped the ball would do the job for us,” the Netherlands spinner told the ICC broadcast after claiming 3-20.

“Speed is crucial as a spinner and changing pace is quite important,” said Tim Pringle.

Catches win matches

So many chances were put down by Nepal but most especially Paudel, the captain. Putting down O’Dowd in the 18th over was so costly.

The Nepal crowd falls silent

The Nepal-heavy crowd have been fantastic in Dallas.

The ground falls to it’s quietest all day as the winning runs are struck.

They do stand to clap both teams from the field, however, in a fine show of appreciation for both in a tight game.
