And that's us wrapping up.

We might not have had a result from England v Scotland in Barbados, but we did get an unexpectedly compelling chase in Dallas, with Netherlands just about coming out on top.

Take a read of our report from this match, and we'll see you for India v Ireland at 15:30 BST tomorrow.

Have a good evening.

Dutch spinner Tim Pringle: "We spoke about getting stumps in play and then hopefully the surface would do the rest for us. It was good."

The Dutch always managed the chase well.

Bohara has gone away from his gameplan there, and Nepal will rue the chances they put down. It's all part of the learning for them.

Netherlands win by six wickets

And we're done!

A single brings Bas de Leede on strike and he times Bohara nicely through the covers four a match-winning four.

The Netherlands win with eight balls to spare - it looks comfortable, it wasn't. And had Nepal taken the wicket of Max O'Dowd in the previous over, it might have been a different result.

And just like that, is that the game done?

O'Dowd flicks Abinash Bohara around the corner for four at backward square, then clips the following ball to the same area for a six that lands flat on the ropes.

O'Dowd certainly came out swinging there, facing the pacier Sompal Kami.

He almost holed out to long off again, but the ball dropped just short of Paudel.

Six singles from the over.

O'Dowd is dropped! Could that be crucial?

The Dutch batter finally takes a big swing and almost holes out to long off, but the captain Rohit Paudel let the ball burst through his hands.

That was very take-able, but O'Dowd survives to move to 41.

19 runs needed from 18 balls

This has been a great four overs from Sagar Dhakal, he concedes just four singles here to finish with figures of 0-21.

He dives to cut off a single and a team-mate runs over to congratulate him. I said it was all about wickets earlier, but it might be about runs now too!

And the required run rate creeps above a run a ball.

Chopped on!

Scott Edwards slices Abinash Bohara's ball onto the base of his stumps and has to depart.

Nepal couldn't... could they?

Ha, no, thick inside edge onto the pads. No wonder the Dutch captain seemed pretty unbothered.

He takes a quick single to mid off to get off the mark, and a dot ball finishes the over.

And now is new batter Scott Edwards out? Do Nepal have two wickets in the over?

The Dutch batter is struck quite high on the pad, and is reviewing.

Engelbrecht run out 14 (Ned 71-3)

Run out at the non-striker's end!

Max O'Dowd offers a little push back down the pitch to Sompal Kami, the ball runs over the tumbling bowler's fingers and strikes the stumps and catches Sybrand Engelbrecht out of his ground.

Nepal will take them in whatever fashion.

36 runs needed from 42 balls

Just a couple of runs from Sagar Dhakal's second over, a couple of singles nurdled through mid-wicket.

A decent over in most T20 matches, but it's all about the wickets now for Nepal.

A free-flowing cover drive that beats the fielder.

That's really good batsmanship.
