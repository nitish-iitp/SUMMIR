**On Saturday, 8 June, the Dutch team takes on South Africa at 16:30. To show our support for the men in orange—or the green and gold if that’s your preference—we’d like to host a bring-and-braai at the club! You’re all invited, along with your families, to join us from 15:30 onwards to watch the game and enjoy the great Kampong atmosphere. Bring whatever meat, salads, rolls, sauces, etc., that you’d like, and we’ll make sure the grills are hot. Charcoal and briquettes are also welcome! Hope to see you all there! ????
