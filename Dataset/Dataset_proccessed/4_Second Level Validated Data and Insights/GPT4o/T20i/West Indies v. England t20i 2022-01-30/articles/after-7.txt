8pm: Rally! We've seen some cracking stuff over the last nine days, which served up the most sixes in a bilateral T20I series. West Indies have hit the ground running with their reboot, while England have things to ponder on the road to the World Cup in Australia later this year. Miller's report is in, and we'll be back for more with the Test series in March. Thanks for tuning in, ta ra for now. Bye!

7.45pm: Rollicking stuff, now time for the presentations... Starting with Moeen Ali "I thought WI were the better team and overall we didn't adapt that well, but we played some good cricket and it was a very good series. [Death bowling] That's something we're working on, I thought they played some amazing shots towards the end. We're trying to find solutions and we will get better, and some of our other guys will come back. The new ball comes on nicely and then when it gets older [it got harder]. But they were very smart, the smarter of the two teams. It was a great series, great spectacle, but disappointing not to win. It's been a great learning, these conditions we've struggled in, we want to get better going forward. Good to see younger guys coming in, Toppers with the new ball and Rash throughout the series was fantastic. [Captaincy] It's great to do it, but there's Jos as well, obviously. I don't really think about that too much."

Jason Holder is Player of the Match: "Classic finish, not the best of starts but just trying to stay in the game. Total opposite to [yesterday], not starting well but being able to finish. Pride myself on my discipline [not bowling no-balls], pleased with how I came back, bowled a dot ball next up and then they had to go at it with wickets in hand. Nothing to lose on their part but plenty to gain on mine. Pumped up for the moment, I love playing at Kensington Oval. We have the best fans in the world. Want to thank the England fans as well for coming out. The atmosphere is electrifying."

Holder is also the Player of the Series: "There's a lot of hard work. An area I need to improve is my death bowling and variations. I'm improving in the nets, and the captain has the confidence in me. That does a lot for my confidence. People are seeing what I can do and giving me the responsibility. I feel really good about my role, I'll pass on the peripheral noise. Every time I step on the field it's about what I can deliver for the team. Full confidence and thanks to the management staff for giving me this role. Thanks to the ECB and England, they're tremendous players and good people. Always look forward to having them out here and giving them a good experience. Look forward to seeing the Barmy Army during the Test series, may the better team win."

West Indies captain Kieron Pollard: "It's wonderful. Every single one in that dressing room, we rallied together. Every time we won a game there was something against us but we came out and rallied. [Criticism?] Empty vessels make the most noise. The guys have worked tirelessly after coming from Jamaica, and we've bounced back pretty well. We understand what we want to do as a team, and we saw the results tonight. [Slowdown in middle overs] This was virtually a final, when you bat first and put runs on the board, you get 10-15 runs, too, because of the pressure as well. We know in the last four overs we can capitalise. Powell came in and gave us that impetus. Akeal [Hosein] getting that early wicket... Brandon [King] had a great series at the top of the order, Jason Holder getting wickets, Odean Smith coming in after everything that has been said. I thought it was a total team effort."

7.35pm: Glorious scenes at Kensington Oval, West Indies parading around the boundary for their fans. They clinched the game by a 17-run margin, taking the series 3-2 - and with Jason Holder's four-in-four icing both England and the cake. Only the fourth time in men's T20Is that a bowler has taken four in four balls, a fine way for Holder to finish a series in which he was the leading wicket-taker by a street. He started with a career-best on his home ground, and ends it with another. West Indies came in with storm clouds hovering, following their ODI defeat to Ireland, but seem to have plenty of talent to work with ahead of this year's T20 World Cup. England, well, they talked about squad development in the build-up, and will have got plenty out of the experience - albeit that they might feel this was a winnable match that snuck away from them

Kumar: "Quatrick for Holder!"

Atit: "There is something about 4 in 4 to win tournaments for WI against Eng. 4 sixes, now 4 wickets."

Mark B: "Now that was a collapse of English proportions "

W
Holder to Mahmood, OUT

FOUR IN FOUR! It just gets better for the Bajans in the house... Neither Holder nor his team-mates realised initially, as Mahmood got a thick inside edge that seemed to have gone for an inconsequential four. But Pooran spotted the leg bail had been dislodged, the ball clipping leg stump on its way, and West Indies have sealed the spoils in style

Saqib Mahmood b Holder 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 4m) SR: 0

Saqib Mahmood on strike, Reece Topley also out there

19.4
W
Holder to Rashid, OUT

Hat-trick for Holder! Heaved into the Bridgetown skies and taken again at deep square leg! England just keep on swinging, but they are out on their feet. First T20I hat-trick for West Indies, and it's Jason Holder in front of his home crowd to close out the game and the series. What a moment for him!

Adil Rashid c Smith b Holder 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 3m) SR: 0
19.3
W
Holder to Billings, OUT

Holes out to deep midwicket, and that is surely the game and the series! Wide line, 125kph, not quite a yorker but Billings had to try and fetch it. Got a decent chunk but not enough, and Walsh Jnr settled underneath the ball again. West Indies know they are almost there

Sam Billings c sub (HR Walsh) b Holder 41 (28b 1x4 2x6 44m) SR: 146.42

Billings is on strike as they crossed. Adil Rashid at the other end

19.2
W
Holder to Jordan, OUT

Slogged leg side... but caught on the fence! It was the short boundary, it was a low full toss, it looked like it might go all the way. But no, straight down the throat of Hayden Walsh Jnr, the sub fielder, and he holds it to put West Indies in sight of victory

Chris Jordan c sub (HR Walsh) b Holder 7 (10b 1x4 0x6 25m) SR: 70

•
Holder to Jordan, no run

Goes full and wide as Jordan rocks on to his heels and can't get his bat near it. He looked hopefully at the umpire, but that was never a wide

Uh-oh, another front-foot no-ball. England need 18 off six now

19.1
2nb
Holder to Billings, (no ball) 1 run

Wide full toss, 128kph/79mph and Billings gets it off the bottom of the bat to long-on. Just a single

Holder to bowl the last... Boundaries needed by England, six balls to find 20 runs

Cottrell to Billings, 1 run

139kph/87mph length ball battered down the ground, just a single - that's a very decent 19th from Cottrell, all but closing this one out (surely?)

18.5
•
Cottrell to Billings, no run

Good comeback, bowls a full cutter in the channel, Billings loses his shape attempting to hammer down the ground and fails to connect

18.5

Cottrell to Billings, (no ball) 2 runs

Beamer! Billings flaps it away into the leg side. Signalled a no-ball and England will get a free hit

18.4
2lb
Cottrell to Billings, 2 leg byes

Low full toss, Billings is across his stumps looking to sweep... hit on the pads and Cottrell asks for lbw, then has to give chase towards midwicket. Pollard calls for a review, but I think he was outside off stump here (and it wasn't coming back). No bat involved, impact is... outside the line. Would have missed the stumps by a distance, given the angle

18.3
1
Cottrell to Jordan, 1 run

Pitched up straight, whipped out to deep midwicket. Billings was looking for two but is sent back

18.2
•
Cottrell to Jordan, no run

Well bowled, full in the channel and Jordan can't connect with a wild hack

Looks like Kyle Mayers, who fielded that ball, is now heading off in the company of the physio. Not sure what he's knacked, but WI need to send on a sub

18.1
1
Cottrell to Billings, 1 run

Goes full outside off, 138kph/86mph and Billings slaps it hard to extra cover, they hustle the single

Was that over Pollard's first captaincy error? Sheldon Cottrell back, England need 28 from 12

Smith to Jordan, FOUR runs

Short and slammed to the rope at deep square leg! Jordan latches on this time and sends it scorching for a flat four. England are clinging to the coattails of this chase

Flung full and wide, punched out to deep extra cover

Smith to Billings, SIX runs

Carried over the boundary by Allen! Back of a length with pace on and Billings blooters it towards deep midwicket, Allen leaps and gets a hand on it, but can't take the catch before he lands out of bounds! Fantastic effort, though

17.3

Smith to Billings, no run

Round the wicket, slower ball bowled wide of the stumps, Billings swings and misses

17.2

Smith to Billings, 2 runs

Shuffles across, goes full again and Billings attempts a slog-sweep, gets a big top edge and it clears Mayers running back from short fine leg

This is now the sixiest bilateral T20I series of all time

17.1
6
Smith to Billings, SIX runs

Leg-stump half-volley, skelped over deep backward square! Billings uses the pace on the ball and launches it on to the beach (not literally, the sandy area for spectators)

17.1
1w
Smith to Billings, 1 wide

Slower ball, slips out down the leg side

Smith to bowl his fourth over, England needing 48 from 18. To be fair, WI got close from a worse position than this last Sunday...
