Pak Vs England T20 washed out as weather warnings issued in Leeds
By
News Desk

Pakistan and England are set to clash in the first T20I of their four-match series at Headingley Cricket Ground, Leeds, on Wednesday. However, the match is likely to be called off due to rain.

The weather in Leeds is unfavorable for cricket, with rain since morning and heavy showers expected to continue from the match start time at 6:30 pm local time.

According to The Weather Channel, 8.34mm of rain is anticipated from 7 pm, which will lessen slightly after an hour but may still prevent the match from proceeding. Current forecasts suggest that the match will be washed out due to rain.

This match is the final outing for both sides before the T20 World Cup 2024, which begins on June 1. Pakistan will play their group matches in the United States, while England will head to the West Indies for their round matches.

Weather forecast in Leeds:

Both teams are keen to avoid a rain-affected match as it is crucial to prepare their squads for the World Cup.

Recently, Pakistan played two T20I series: one against an inexperienced New Zealand side at home, and another against Ireland in Dublin. These were Babar Azam’s first tests after being reappointed as the white-ball captain.

The Green Shirts drew the T20I series against New Zealand 2-2 at home, with one match called off due to rain. They managed to beat Ireland 2-1. Despite winning the latter series, evident problems remain for the Men in Green to address before the World Cup.

Meanwhile, England’s last T20 series was against the West Indies in January, which they lost 3-2.

Squads

England: Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonathan Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, Mark Wood.
