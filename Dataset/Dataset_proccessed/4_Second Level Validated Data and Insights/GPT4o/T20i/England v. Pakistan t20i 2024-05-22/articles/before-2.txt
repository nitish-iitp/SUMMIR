Babar Azam will be leading Pakistan.

Pakistan are touring England for a four-match T20I series in a bid to prepare for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. The first game of the series will be played at Headingley in Leeds. Edgbaston, Sophia Gardens and Kennington Oval are the venues for the remaining games.

England’s last assignment in the shortest format was way back in December 2023 when they toured the West Indies. They lost the series by a 3-2 margin. With the T20 World Cup just around the corner, they will be looking to get their combinations right.

Jos Buttler will continue to lead the English side. They key point is the return of Jofra Archer after a long layoff due to an injury. It remains to be seen how he goes about his business at the highest level. Most of the players in the squad are returning from IPL 2024 and will be looking to carry forward their form.
