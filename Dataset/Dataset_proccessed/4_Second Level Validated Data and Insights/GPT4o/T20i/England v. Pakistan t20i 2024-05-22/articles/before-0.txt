England's red-ball team return to action against Pakistan this week with a major point to prove ahead of a huge summer.

Captain Jos Buttler led his team to glory at the first time of asking in the T20 World Cup 2022 with a confident victory over this series's visitors.

However, things haven't gone to plan since then. England were battered, bruised and, ultimately, humiliated in India during the Cricket World Cup 2023. They lost six out of nine games during their miserable, failed title defence.

Buttler and the gang know the pressure is on to punch in a respectable, competitive performance during this summer's T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA.

They will be determined to prove their title-winning credentials against Pakistan throughout this four-match series, and inject hope back into English cricket.
