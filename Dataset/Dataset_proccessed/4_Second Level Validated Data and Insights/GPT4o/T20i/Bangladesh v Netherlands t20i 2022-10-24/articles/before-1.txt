Well, that's done but in a breath's time, the game between South Africa and Zimbabwe's starting. Head over there and don't toe the line because PDP will be on the watch. From here, it's goodbye from me, Ekanth, my fellow commentator, Madushka Balasuriya, and our scorer, Chandan Duorah.

saad had said before the last over where 24 was needed: "Somebody call Carlos!" Actually Cricinfo only called, he's among our panel of experts

Shakib Al Hasan: It was an important win, I've played all editions but haven't won. We were 10 runs short but the way our pacers bowled was tremendous. We understand the importance of fast bowling now, across formats. We've found talent, Hasan's new, Taskin's developed well in the past few years. We want to be the best fielding side given we have a young team. We have the belief that we can save 5-10 runs which can make a big difference.

Scott Edwards, Netherlands captain:Bowlers were amazing, they were 10-15 short. The run outs were poor, Colin and Edwards did well. We're looking forward to the India challenge.

Taskin Ahmed, POTM: It's a good win for us and we needed it. We played well as a team, happy to have contributed. (On first two balls) I stuck to my basics, saw there was movement in the first innings. So I bowled Test-match lengths. (On his learnings with and from Allan Donald) I can move the ball both ways, that was the main focus. I worked on that coming into the World Cup.

vivek: "the fact that Netherlands stuck it out till the end and kept this as close as it was is admirable. Props to Ackermann Klaasen and Van Meekeren at the close"

6:41pm: What was the difference between the teams? Maybe Taskin and Hasan Mahmud's brilliance, maybe Afif and Mosaddek's runs, maybe the combined distance in the run outs of O'Dowd and Tom Cooper. Whatever it was, these three things did combine and took the game out of Netherlands' reach. Bangladesh deserved to win but that, as @Tasin comments, came much closer than what it should have and what it seemed when Netherlands were 15 for 4. That was so because Taskin started the innings with two wickets, then there were the run outs. Ackermann struggled to get going, but unlike Edwards, managed to get past the phase and get a few later on. Bangladesh couldn't maintain control in a rain affected game as well as they'd liked but combined efforts of Taskin, Mahmud, and the fizz left Netherlands needing too much.

Mustafa Moudi: "Just want to appreciate Rajat, who at the end of 19th over of the Bangladesh Innings, said that if they can add 10 more runs, they have the bowling to defend 145. Not just the target was exact (145) but the margin was perfect too. Had Bangladesh scored 10 runs lesser, NED would have won this match. Great Work Rajat !!"

Sampath's here with a stat: Bangladesh in the Round 2 of men's T20 World Cup (Super 8s/10s/12s): Played 17, Won 1, Lost 16
