Suryakumar Yadav leads the charge

IND vs SA, T20 World Cup 2022: Just when the pain piled on and India looked into all sorts of trouble, it was SKY (Suryakumar Yadav), who held his nerves and did what he does best, taking on bowlers and smacking them in different parts of the field. On a difficult Perth wicket, Surya came out with only one motive, to break the shackles and rescue his team from a marshland. When Suryakumar Yadav came to bat, India were 41/3 with Virat Kohli gone.

In the ongoing World Cup, team India has been enjoying a dominant run so far. They are yet to lose a match but come to the South Africa match, things looked tough for team India. On a difficult Perth wicket, skipper Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bat first. It was an extremely brave decision considering that South Africa have lethal pacers at their disposal. India opener KL Rahul looked in all sorts of trouble as he faced Kagiso Rabada in the very first over. Rabada didn't concede any runs that put Rohit under pressure. Once Rahul was dismissed, it triggered a collapse and the Indian top order was bundled out under 50.
