India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma after game

[on playing aggressively with bat] I have been talking about this for a long time now. It's about going there and putting that into work. Considering everything we played really well, adapted to the conditions. There's a little bit of wind factor here, overall we are very smart, overall we were good with bat and ball. All eight batters need to play their role, whatever it is. We saw one guy get 50 and we got 197, in T20 I don't believe we need to get fifties and hundreds, what matters is the pressure you put on the bowlers. All the batters from the word go played like that and that's how we want to play as well. There is a lot of experience in the squad and we back them. [on Hardik] I mentioned in the last game as well, him batting well puts us in a good stead. We want to finish well after the top 5, 6, Hardik being Hardik we know what he is capable of. He is a very important player for us, if he can keep doing that, it will put us in good positions. Excitement and if we discuss something with the bowler and when it comes off, it's nice. Everyone when it came to our bowling adapted well and we discussed those things and they did well.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Shanto after the game

We were thinking about 160-170 when we put them into bat, but they batted well so credit to them. [on the weather and wind] I don't think that is an issue, the players are habituated to that. We did not show as much intent as we needed with the bat, when we are chasing 190, we needed to show more intent especially in the first six. Try to contribute but need to finish the games. Tanzim Sakib in this tournament has done a great job and happy for Rishad too, we have been looking for a good legspinner for a long time now.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Hardik Pandya after the game

We have played really good cricket. More than anything we have stuck together and executed our plans. I did realise the batters wanted to use the breeze, I made sure I did not give them a chance where the wind was blowing, it was about being one step ahead as a batter. We as a group can get better in a lot of places, losing wickets in bunches is something we can rectify and get better at, apart from that, we are looking good. I have been fortunate to play for the country, it was a freak injury I had, I wanted to come back but God had other plans. Luck comes to people who work hard and that has stuck with me for a long time.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: IND beat BAN by 50 runs in Antigua and confirm their spot in semis

Well, that's it India won the game by 50 runs it has been another comprehensive performance from them. Hardik in the first innings was brilliant with the bat and then it was Kuldeep Yadav in the middle overs of Bangladesh's innings who did the damage. It has been another day in the office for Rohit Sharma as captain he did not have to use too much of his tactical acumen most of Bangladesh tactical decisions were poor which helped the Indian skipper. With the win India has confirmed their sport in the semis and they will play in Guyana no matter what we have to wait and see who will they face on the day 

23:12 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 19 overs BAN 143/7

Rishad slammed one straight to cover the fielder off Bumrah. Another day another excellent performance from the Indian speedster. Brilliant performance from India once again today also some very poor tactical calls from Bangladesh through out the day. 

23:04 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 17 overs BAN 122/6

Bumrah has picked Shanto and Arshdeep has picked up Jaker Ali. Now it is falling apart for Bangladesh. India has not been tested with their death bowling in this tournament and this might be the right opportunity for both Bumrah and Arshdeep even Hardik if he gets an over here to try and see what options they would like to use and how well it is coming out of hand. We saw yesterday that when South Africa needed to bowl in death overs they did struggle. This might be a caution tale for India and they can try and practice those skills in a real match situation though it is already won.

22:53 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 15 overs BAN 108/4

Shakib tried to force the issue against Kuldeep did manage to get a six and tried to get another one away got the outside edge and Rohit Sharma at covers took a simple catch. It is not to blame any batters from Bangladesh but it was a poor call from Shanto to bowl first. The wicket in a day game was always going to get slower and his call at the toss would have put immense pressure on bowlers to restrict India to the 150-160 mark which did not happen either. It has been more or less the same from Bangladesh a lot of promise and talent but no conversion of potential on field in big ICC games. 

22:43 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 13.1 overs BAN 92/3

Kuldeep bowled another fuller one and Hridoy trying to sweep the ball missed and was given out LBW he too reviewed it only to find out three reds on ball-tracking. This is going way beyond Bangladesh's reach now. Shakib has come in but he has a lot of work to do. One objective for India would be they would like Jadeja to get a couple of wickets and get into some sort of rhythm. As of now, he is struggling with the bat and ball he needs something to go his way to justify his spot in the team. If Bangladesh lose this they also will be almost out of the Super Eight race. 

22:33 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10.2 overs BAN 72/2

Kuldeep Yadav picks Tanzid. He was not picking him whatsoever right from ball one he tried to play with the ball on the off-side going onto the back foot however, Kuldeep bowled a wrong un which turned back into the batter and his bat and ball were in two different pincodes. Kuldeep appealed umpire gave it out and Tanzid reviewed however, he was so deep in the crease that the ball-tracking thought the ball would have hit the leg stump. Not scoring is fine but consuming balls getting yourself in and throwing your wicket away like Tanzid did will hurt Bangladesh big time in this chase. 

22:23 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After .5 overs BAN 64/1

Jadeja and Kuldeep have been brought into the attack and what Rohit has done is despite having two left-handers at the crease has brought Jadeja from an end where if batters have to hit him on the leg side they have to hit it against the wind and as per Kuldeep who turns the ball away from left-handers they need to hit it against the wind in off-side this has been top class captaincy from Rohit so far in this game. Tactically he has been astute. Bangladesh spinner Najimul who has walked in is struggling to get his innings going at the moment. 

22:13 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 5.4 overs BAN 41/1

Liton Das pulled one off Hardik Pandya and the breeze took the ball towards Suryakumar Yadav who was at mid-wicket took a brilliant catch of the swirling ball. Good breakthrough for India just when things were looking like they were going out of hand. It is a decent Powerplay for Bangladesh, not a great one but something to work with for the remainder of the game. Also a mention of Hardik Pandya what a game he is having here. Scored an excellent half-century with the bat and now got the breakthrough. He is now looking like he is back to his best. 

22:03 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 4 overs BAN 27/0

India has started well here. Yes, it has been only three overs however, they have not given away boundaries which is a good sign. Also on the positive side for Bangladesh Tanzid is looking in good touch he is executing his shots to perfection. What Bangladesh needs here is a big 20-run over in the Powerplay to stay in the contest. If they don't make the most of the Powerplay it is highly difficult to catch up latter. Also in addition to that they need either Tanzid or Shakib to bat through 20 overs and get a three-digit mark which will take them closer. 

21:53 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 1.3 overs BAN 7/0

Arshdeep Singh has taken the new ball for India as expected there is a slight hint of swing this is where Bangladesh was behind the eight ball from the first over when they decided to use a spinner instead of a seamer especially when there was a breeze going around. The challenge for Bangladesh will now further increase as Jasprit Bumrah comes into the attack. How they will play him will be interesting to see neither can they just sit in against him nor can they over-attack him they need to find the right balance without taking high risks. 

21:46 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Hardik Pandya during innings break

Wicket looked alright, the par would have been 180, but we got 197 I think that is like a good score here. Hopefully with our bowling line-up, with a little bit of consistency, we will be able to do well. He (Dube) had to take his time because his role was to take on the spinners, I think when the time came we both were allowed to free our hands and that was very important to us. It tends to get slower at the end, discipline and good bowling will be crucial.

21:38 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: IND 196/5 (20 overs) vs BAN in Antigua

That was a poor final over from Mustrafizur in the end. He became too predictable and Hardik extracted him for 18 runs. Excellent innings from Hardik in the end he got to his fifty in just 27 balls. Super batting display from India this. As per Bangladesh the bowlers who did well did very well like Tanzim and the ones who gave away runs have been very expensive like Mustafizur and that is where the massive score has come from. Now the Bangladesh batters have to deal with Bumrah with the new ball and also have to score against him as once the ball gets softer it becomes hard to hit . It is going to be a difficult chase but do join us shortly. 

21:27 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 19 overs IND 178/5

Hardik is playing a gem of an inning here. He took his time initially and now adjusted to the pace of the surface and is smoking the bowlers for boundaries. One of the noticeable things is odd ball is spinning sharply and some are keeping low which is very concerning for Bangladesh batters. This is already a huge total to chase and given the way things have changed in 20 overs it is looking like an uphill task. Once again it goes back to Shanto's poor decision to bowl first in a day game here they have played right into the hands of the Indian team here.

21:18 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 17.1 overs IND 161/4

This is an important innings for Shivam Dube. He has looked out of form throughout this campaign and today the conditions have been kinder to batting he also came in around the 10th over mark which is where he thrived for Chennai Super Kings. He gave himself enough time and Bangladesh does not have any quick pacer as well who can test him with the short ball everything going for him today and he needs to capitalize. As per Hardik, he tends to pick his bowlers when finishing and extracts runs out of them. India looking good 180 here again. 

21:08 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 14.5 overs IND 133/4

How Hardik and Dube will go from here will be interesting to see. The platform here is set to get to around the 170-180 mark however, the issue is they cannot go too early or leave it too late they need it to time that finishing bang to perfection or India might fall short with the softer ball here. Yesterday we saw in the South Africa vs England game how brilliantly David Miller and Harry Brook paced their innings although on a different ground and against different attacks the ball not coming onto the bat as the innings went on was the same and India here needs a similar innings from either of Pandya or Dube. 

20:58 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 12.2 overs IND 113/4

Well just when it felt like Rishabh Pant was taking this game away from Bangladesh he got out. He tried to reverse-sweep Rishad and was caught at fine leg. Was the shot necessary under the circumstances not exactly. Given the way India plays, it is justifiable to some extent however, the conditions here in the West Indies are not conducive to ultra-aggressive batting and the approach might not be the only way to go in these conditions. The frustrating part today has been batters throwing their wickets away after getting themselves in. Hardik has walked into the middle and India once again needs to stitch another partnership. 

20:49 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10.2 overs IND 87/3

Interesting this from India they have sent in Shivam Dube after Surya got out as a result there are two left-handers at the crease given the composition of Bangladesh's side with off-spinners and left-arm spinners it might have been wise to have a left-hand right-hand combination going. Also,, this has been good from Bangladesh they have not started well with the new ball but once the ball is getting softer and the field is spread they are getting it right. Once again if they want to get a win here they need to restrict India to around the 150-160 mark the moment India breaches that score it will become an uphill task for Bangladesh batters. 

20:39 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 8.3 overs IND 78/3

Kohli charged down the track and tried to whack the ball on the leg-side across the line off Tanzid and Kohli missed it altogether and got bowled. It is a strange shot from Kohli given how sublime he was looking. All he was doing was standing there hitting the ball through the line with his trademark shots and somehow decided he needed to take extra risk and got out. As we update Tanzid picks Suryakumar Yadav. The batter tried to glide the ball towards the third man and the ball bounced a bit more and took the glove and the keeper took an easy catch. Two wickets in quick succession for India's excellent passage of play for Bangladesh. 

20:28 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7 overs IND 56/1

The powerplay is done and India has breached the 50-run mark. But most importantly Virat Kohli is looking in excellent touch. The pickup shot he flicked through the mid-wicket of Mustafizur from the off-stump is arguably the shot of the game. He got his eye in, it is important that he stays in the middle and helps India to get to around 180-mark. Mind you once the ball gets older and softer hitting won't be easier and Kohli needs to bring in his timing the ball and strike rotation into play. As per Bangladesh having won the toss and opted to bowl first they would have hoped for a better start. 

20:18 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 4.2 overs IND 40/1

Shakib tossed one up slower through the air and Rohit's eyes lit up he looked to heave the ball on the leg side however beaten for pace Rohit played the shot too early and got the leading edge and the ball went up high in the air and Jaker Ali manages to take the catch. Another failure for the Indian skipper trying to be ultra-aggressive. On pitches where the average scores are around 160-170 in day games this kind of approach is something he needs to decide for himself. Pant has walked into the middle and he might probably play the same way as Rohit.

20:08 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 2 overs IND 23/0

Mahedi and Shakib have taken the new ball for Bangladesh. As of now, there are no signs of slowness from the surface. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been able to play the ball with comfort. Also, the Bangladesh bowlers are firing it in rather than trying to bowl it slower which is not helping their cause either. There is a steady cross breeze going across the ground Shanto might be missing the trick by not giving the pace bowler a new ball especially given how Rohit and Kohli are a bit touch vulnerable when the ball moves. 10 minutes into the game Shanto has already made a lot of tactical errors in the game right from the toss.

19:59 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: let's go!

The national anthems are done the sun is shining there is a decent crowd in the stands. It is a strange call from Shanto to bowl first given the way these wickets in West Indies in day games have played out. Nevertheless, they would look to restrict India around the 140-150 mark if they need to have a chance of winnings this game.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma at toss

We wanted to bat and that's what we got. Looks like a good wicket and depends on how much the sun is beating down and making the pitch slow. Important to assess the conditions quickly. We are playing the same team. Important to stay in the present and not worry about other things.

19:35 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Nazmul Shanto at toss

We would like to bowl first, we would like to restrict them to a small total and that is the plan. We know the conditions here and also about the wind factor. Looks a good wicket. 150-160 will be a good score I reckon. We have one change. Taskin is not playing.

22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Is Rohit's batting adding pressure on Kohli

But against a newish ball that comes on to the bat better than it would a little later and in conditions where it doesn’t seam or swing too much, the new-Kohli is still better equipped if he can find the right balance he needs to kickstart a knock. Rohit Sharma’s form isn’t helping him either but suffice here to say that if India wants to continue with their aggressive intent particularly if the pitches remain sluggish, then Kohli will have to open. If the pitches ease out to be batting beauts, then he can do the job in middle overs in theory, but as things stand, Kohli the opener has to find an aggressive way that works.

19:14 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: What are Virat Kohli's goto shots on slow tracks?

Kohli’s break-free shots against spinners on these tracks are gradually growing, ever since he dusted off his slog-sweeps (he had used just two in his highest Test score of 254 in Pune in 2019 against South Africa that had 35 boundaries) and used them a lot more this IPL. He tried a couple of times against Afghanistan as well, though they didn’t quite connect as well as he intended. But that’s a shot now that one can reliably state he would go for every now and then.

If he is convinced that ball isn’t turning much or if he is really desperate to break-out, he can charge the spinners too. As he did once but failed against Afghanistan, he also shuffles outside leg to try cut the spinners from the stumps through the off side ring. Or just stretch and try to chip up and over, like he tried against Rashid Khan but holed out.

19:09 (IST)
22 JUN 2024
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Why Pant in top order works for India

If Rishabh Pant opens, on a good day when the openers aren’t separated for at least four-five overs, it leaves Virat Kohli staring into the middle-over expanse. If the tracks slow up post the powerplay as they have generally done, then a freshly-in Kohli would have a few decisions to take. In theory, he could play the situation, nurdle the ball around for say a 30-ball 25 or 35, before he tries to free his arms. The idea is that his technically-proficient batting will be suitable to negotiate that phase.

But as we saw against Afghanistan on Thursday, it will be the old Kohli style of batting. He has to extend himself to crack out the boundaries and sixes in such conditions where the ball stops a touch on landing. If India are looking to consolidate in this phase, then it’s not a problem, but if they are intent on trying to be aggressive as their stated and attempted objectives have been this tournament, then he might not be the right fit there.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: What will happen if India vs Bangladesh match gets washed out?

Since there is no provison for reserve day for the Super Eight round of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, both the teams will have to settle for one point each. If the match gets washed out, then the race for the semifinal will become more interesting. India will face Australia, while Bangladesh will lock horns against Afghanistan in their last respective Super Eight matches and it would be a must-win for them.

"It is difficult to say why we are not able to play. I think everyone has the capability, people have played well in different places in the past. But I do not have an answer to why this is not happening. Everyone has the freedom to play their natural game and they will try to play as they want, but somehow it is not happening."

"We've always had depth as a team, I believe. But yeah, these conditions maybe suit us more because we can afford to play two or three spinners at times. So that I believe can be our best team. That is our strength. That has been our strength. So yeah, it feels like because somebody like Axar [Patel] playing at eight gives you a lot of confidence because he can bat and he's bowling really well at the moment. So, it does give you a lot of options"

The under-performance of openers Litton Das and Tanzid Khan has also compounded Bangladesh’s woes. Tanzid Hasan’s form is a concern since he struck an unbeaten 58 to help Bangladesh prevent a 3-0 whitewash against the USA late last month, Tanzid Hasan has got into double digits just twice in six innings.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: India player to watch out for

Virat Kohli’s form has been a bit of a worry for India in the ongoing tournament. The former India captain has mustered only 29 runs in four matches so far. Kohli, who is opening with Rohit Sharma will be looking to get some runs under his belt against Bangladesh.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Why Virat Kohli has to open and Rishabh Pant fits better at No 3 on sluggish tracks

It’s clear to everyone that Rishabh Pant has come a long way. From a return to competitive cricket a few months ago, after nearly 18 months on the sidelines, to getting selected for the T20 World Cup and now the unorthodox X-factor at one down.

Mid-way during that IPL, he shrugged off a rousing challenge from Dinesh Karthik to join Sanju Samson in the wicket-keeper race but even at the end of that t20 tournament, it wasn’t clear cut that he would be batting at No.3 for India in the world cup.

Such has been his rise that now the murmurs have begun if he should displace Virat Kohli as an opener. It would be a surprise if India go that way against Bangladesh on Saturday but it’s an interesting exercise to delve into.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: How Bumrah, Arshdeep and Pandya can mimic Australia’s successful slow-cutters plan against Bangladesh part 2

India have Jasprit Bumrah, who doesn’t mind going the slower cutter route even with a new ball as he showed to take out the attacking opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz on Thursday. It wasn’t the delivery that Gurbaz was expecting, but Bumrah doesn’t do the expected or the extravagant; he solves problems with the best delivery suited to the situation. In the fifth over, Bumrah slipped in another offcutter to induce a leading edge from the left-handed Hazratullah Zazai. Afghanistan’s back was broken. India also have Arshdeep Singh and Hardik Pandya to bowl the cutters. Hardik in particular prefers the slow bouncer with that cutter, and Arshdeep can do all lengths with that type of delivery. So, Bangladesh’s batsmen have their hands full, especially after their torrid time against Australia. At least they should expect it now.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: How Bumrah, Arshdeep and Pandya can mimic Australia’s successful slow-cutters plan against Bangladesh

Till the end of the eighth over, Bangladesh batsmen seemed at ease. At 57/1, with Litton Das and Najmul Hossain Shanto set, they were beginning to consolidate their position on a slow Antigua pitch that was gripping, offering some turn. It’s then that Australia’s seamers switched to the cutters and slower ones, even as leg-spinner Adam Zampa capitalised from the other end. Bangladesh innings never took off from then on as they managed only 140/8, which Australia overhauled comfortably by 28 runs via DLS as rain put full-stop to their chase.

If India were watching it, they couldn’t have got a better live demonstration of what they should be expecting from their next two opponents Bangladesh and Australia. India are scheduled to face Bangladesh at the same venue on Saturday and going by this game, it has all the making for a slugfest in these conditions. Having learned their lessons the hard way, Bangladesh won’t be any pushovers, particularly if the left-handed seamer Mustafizur Rahman puts his cutters to good use like Pat Cummins did in the second-half of the innings to complete the job started by Zampa. In Rishad Hossain, Bangladesh also have a leg-spinner with wicket-taking abilities in the middle-overs.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: What will happen if India vs Bangladesh match gets washed out?

Since there is no provison for reserve day for the Super Eight round of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, both the teams will have to settle for one point each. If the match gets washed out, then the race for the semifinal will become more interesting. India will face Australia, while Bangladesh will lock horns against Afghanistan in their last respective Super Eight matches and it would be a must-win for them.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Virat to open with Rohit

Virat Kohli has been “challenged” in the ongoing T20 World Cup but his lean run is allowing the less experienced players to step up and contribute to the team’s cause. Against Afghanistan, Kohli was tested once again in the powerplay and ended up with a run-a-ball 24, his first double-digit score in the tournament. Both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have got starts but have not been able to turn them into defining knocks. They would love to click as an opening pair ahead of the crucial games.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Axar to bat ahead of Jadeja

Axar Patel, who has always been an understudy for Ravindra Jadeja has finally started to show his potential. Axar has bowled beautifully in the tournament but it is batting, which has been excellent. Axar as a batter is looking more at home than the veteran Jadeja. India’s think tank might promote Axar ahead of Jadeja in the batting order.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Sanju Samson for Shivam Dube

Shivam Dube, who has been included in India’s World Cup squad ahead of Rinku Singh to take on spinners in the middle overs. However, Dube’s scores at the T20 World Cup so far might have forced the team management to make a change in their playing XI against Bangladesh. Dube has managed only 44 runs in four innings. His game depends so much on that free swing of the bat but on these pitches where the ball stops a touch, he hasn’t been able to adjust. With Rishabh Pant at 3, followed by Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya, who can take on the spinners at will, India would be tempted to replace Shivam Dube with Sanju Samson. Unlike Dube, Samson is equally good against spinners and pacers and can use his muscles to clear the ropes even if fours are hard to score on these heavy outfields.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: The Dube question

Drafted into the T20 World Cup side to specifically bolster the middle-overs hitting, Shivam Dube has failed to light up the tournament with the bat. Skipper Rohit Sharma has also refrained from using Dube with the ball, rendering his spot under a cloud in the playing XI. Against Afghanistan, Dube also failed to take on spin and eventually fell to leggie Rashid. Known for his penchant to tonking the spinners down the ground, Dube has been silenced partially by the wrist-spinners this year.

Dube’s strike-rate takes a considerable hit when facing leg-spin in T20Is. While he holds a 152.57 strike rate agains spin in all T20s this year, Dube has only been dismissed five times of which three have come against wrist-spin. His 157.89 strike-rate against wristpin in T20s in 2024 witnesses a corresponding dip to 127.77 in T20Is. Consequently, Dube’s contest against Bangladesh leg-spinner Rishad could be a make-or-break situation for the southpaw and India’s composition going forward.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rishabh Pant’s spin challenge

While Pant’s unorthodox shots have provided India with breathing space after the openers’ struggle, the southpaw has been largely untested by leg-spin which has concerned him in T20Is over the years. Pant has only faced five deliveries of wrist-spin in the tournament, scoring six runs. He was dismissed by Rashid Khan leg-before while attempting a reverse-sweep in the previous outing and Bangladesh’s Rishad Hossain could offer a similar challenge to the India No. 3. The sprightly leg-spinner has emerged as a key bowler for Bangladesh, also holding an appreciable record against left-hand batters (six wicket at an 8.59 economy).

Even as he has only been dismissed thrice in 21 innings, Pant’s overall strike rate slumps to 118.59 against leg-spin in T20Is. India are likely to come up against quality wristspinners in their upcoming games and Pant’s contest against Rishad could emerge a crucial factor.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Openers vs Bangladesh pacers

Rohit Sharma has had a torrid run with the bat alongside Virat Kohli at the top, with both batters struggling to come to terms with the sluggish pitches. The Indian skipper’s weakness against left-arm pace was exploited in the previous game where Afghan seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi foxed him with a slower-delivery.

In Mustafizur Rahman, Rohit will find a similar challenge to counter up top. Rohit, however, holds a positive record against Mustafizur in T20s, having recorded 122 runs off 72 deliveries with a 169.44 strike rate and a healthy 40-plus average. Adept at using the slower cutters, Mustafizur has dismissed Rohit thrice in 11 T20 meetings.

Meanwhile, Kohli’s challenge will be firmed up by the presence of Taskin Ahmed and Tanzim Hasan Sakib whose skiddy pace and probing lines outside the off-stump can test the India batter’s resolve. Kohli is enduring his worst run at the T20 World Cup with three single-digit dismissals and a run-a-ball 24 against Afghanistan. Overcoming Saturday’s challenge will be crucial for Kohli to shape up for a stacked Australian attack and the potential knockouts thereafter, all of whom bear potent seam attacks.

Why Virat Kohli has to open and Rishabh Pant fits better at No 3 on sluggish tracks

The sluggish tracks need either the outrageousness of Pant, who will wriggle and contort his body, charge, reverse, trust his instincts or plain slog to make the pitch seem better than it looks. Or it will require the serenely-intelligent body-positioning and crafty shot-selection of Suryakumar Yadav. Both have done it so far. Pant against Pakistan and briefly against Afghanistan, and on Thursday, Suryakumar showed why he is the best No.4 in the world. (READ MORE)
