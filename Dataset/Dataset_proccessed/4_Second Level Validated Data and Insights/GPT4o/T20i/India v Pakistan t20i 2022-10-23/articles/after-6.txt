'Credit to Kohli'
published at 13:21 British Summer Time 23 October 2022
13:21 BST 23 October 2022

Pakistan skipper Babar Azam: "It was a tight game but we started bowling well. Our bowlers bowled really well and credit to Kohli who finished the game and shifted the momentum.

"With the new ball it's not easy. We were up to the mark but India built a good partnership.

"We had a chance but we asked the boys to believe in themselves and execute their plans, but credit to Kohli for batting.

"It's hard for the captain. In the middle of the game we decided we needed to take a wicket so we utilised our main bowlers and I think that's why it was good for India.

"Lots of positive things to take away. Iftikhar and Masood played well until the end and that was good for us."

India captain Rohit Sharma: "I have no words left as well! I think you have to expect something like this in a game like this. Our plan was to stay in the game as long as possible, that is what we have talked about, and keep believing you can pull through from whatever situation. That's what happened with that partnership between Hardik Pandya and Virat Kohli.

"Those two guys are experienced and have been in that kind of situation. Staying calm and taking it deep was critical. This is good for our confidence and good to get off the mark in that first game. Hats off to Virat. I think it was the best innings he has played for India."

'A special moment'

Player of the match Virat Kohli: "I have no words, no idea how that happened. I just kept believing and staying there until the end. I am honestly just lost for words.

"I think when Shaheen [Shah Afridi] bowled from the pavilion end we talked about taking him down. Then I knew if I took Haris Rauf down they would have to bowl Mohammad Nawaz again at the end.

"I just feel like this was meant to be. It was a special moment. Was it my best T20 innings? Until today I said at Mohali versus Australia was my best innings but I think today was one higher, given the magnitude of the game. It seemed impossible.

"Thanks to the fans. These past few months I have struggled and you kept backing me."

Pakistan only used five bowlers, but the decision to leave Mohammad Nawaz's final over of spin until the last will be one that will, surely, haunt Babar Azam for a long time.

Kohli looked close to tears as he was swamped by his team mates there. What a match, what an innings, the rest of the tournament will have to go some to get near this.

Kohli can't believe it. What a show he gave us tonight, to guide India to the win. He's the best white ball batter that we have ever seen.

All of India's squad and backroom staff are out celebrating with the two batters, but especially with Virat Kohli, who ends with 82 not out. That was an incredible knock.

Devastation for Pakistan, bedlam in the stands.

Ravichandran Ashwin chips a lofted drive off Mohammad Nawaz over the top, sets off to complete the winning run, and the India fans in the MCG erupt in celebration. Virat Kohli thumps the ground in unbridled joy, before pointing to the sky with a tear in his eye. What a game!

Ashwin then begins a victory aeroplane style celebration after completing the run. Pakistan's players look absolutely crestfallen. India's elated.
