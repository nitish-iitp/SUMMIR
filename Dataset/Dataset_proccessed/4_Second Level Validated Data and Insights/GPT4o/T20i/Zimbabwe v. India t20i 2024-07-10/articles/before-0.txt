India will lock horns with Zimbabwe in the 3rd T20I on Wednesday, July 10 at the Harare Sports Club. This article will cover match details, pitch report, playing XI, player stats, Dream11 predictions and fantasy cricket tips for the IND vs ZIM match.

Match Preview

After a surprising 13-run defeat in the first match, India bounced back strongly with a thumping 100-run victory in the second.

Opener Abhishek Sharma stole the show with a breathtaking century, but his position might be up for grabs with the return of India’s World Cup heroes. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, and Shivam Dube are back in the squad, potentially shaking up the batting order.

Jaiswal and Samson, who haven’t played since the IPL in May, could be finding a place in the playing XI for the 3rd T20I. Samson might take over the wicketkeeping duties from Dhruv Jurel, while Jaiswal could partner skipper Gill at the top.

This could push Abhishek down to number 3, a position where he thrived with two rapid fifties during the IPL. Ruturaj Gaikwad, despite his unbeaten 77 in the previous match, might make way for Jaiswal to accommodate the returning players.

On the other hand, Zimbabwe will be looking for a comeback, obviously with better plans against the Men in Blue. They need to play as a unit to outsmart this Indian side, which is full of power hitters. All in all, an exciting T20 match is on cards.
