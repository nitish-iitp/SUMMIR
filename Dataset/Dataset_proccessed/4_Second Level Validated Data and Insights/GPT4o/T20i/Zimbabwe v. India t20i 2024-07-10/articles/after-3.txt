In Short
India beat Zimbabwe by 23 runs in third T20I
India go 2-1 up in the five-match series
Shubman Gil top scored with 66 (49)

India completed a clinical win over Zimbabwe in the third T20I as they beat them by 23 runs on Wednesday, July 10 at Harare Sports Club, Harare. After opting to bat first, India posted a good score of 182/4 in their allotted 20 overs courtesy of a brilliant half-century from captain Shubman Gill (66 off 49). In reply, Zimbabwe could only finish on 159/6 in their 20 overs.

Zimbabwe’s chase got off to a miserable start as Avesh Khan (2/39) dismissed Wessly Madhevere in the second over getting him caught at short cover. Khaleel Ahmed also got rid of Tadiwanashe Marumani for 13 (10) who hit one straight to mid-on to Shivam Dube.

Brian Bennett was also sent on his way back to the pavilion courtesy of a sensational catch by Ravi Bishnoi. The agony continued to pile on Zimbabwe as they further lost the big scalp of their skipper Sikandar Raza (15 off 16) who holed out to deep mid-wicket against Washington Sundar (3/15, four overs).

The hosts were staring down the barrel at 39/5 after seven overs. However, a brilliant 77-run partnership between Dion Myers and Clibe Madande (37 off 26) kept them alive in the game. With the required run rate getting out of hand, Madande tried to take on Sundar in the 17th over but could only find Rinku Singh in the deep to leave his team reeling at 116/6.

After losing his partner, Myers continued to play his shots and brought up his maiden T20I fifty (65* off 49). However, it didn't prove to be enough to get his team over the line.

Gill and Jaiswal power India to 182

Earlier in the day, India got off to a decent start as the new opening pair of Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal (36 off 27) added 67 runs for the first wicket off 49 balls. With the game running away from Zimbabwe, captain Sikandar Raza’s golden arm brought his team back into the game.

The off-spinner dismissed Jaiswal and dangerous Abhishek Sharma (10 off 9) in consecutive overs to leave India on 81/2 after 10.3 overs. Gaikwad walked in at number four and added 72 runs for the third wicket off 44 balls with the Indian skipper helping the team cross the 150-run mark. Some late flourish from Sanju Samson (12* off 7) and Gaikwad (49 off 28) helped India finish their innings on 182/4.

Blessing Muzarabani (2/25) and Sikandar Raza (2/24) took two wickets each for Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, after taking a 2-1 lead, India will look to seal the series in the fourth game on Saturday, July 13 at the same venue.
