Preview

Zimbabwe will be playing against India in the third T20I of the five-match series at the Harare Sports Club in Harare. After registering a famous win in the first T20I, Zimbabwe lost the second match of the series to India by a big margin of 100 runs. The Indian cricket team bounced back strongly from an early setback in the first T20I, ensuring that they level the series at 1-1.

Pitch Report

Just a single pitch was used for the first two T20I matches of the series at the Harare Sports Club in Harare, which produced contrasting totals of 115 and 234 runs respectively. With the expectation of a fresh pitch to be used for the third T20I of the Zimbabwe versus India series, the average first innings score of 157 runs could prove to be defendable, especially if the early morning moisture stays intact on the playing surface.

Team Analysis

Zimbabwe

The batting lineup of Zimbabwe has been a big let down in the first two T20I matches of the series except for Brian Bennett, who struck a few lusty blows against the Indian pacers. The Zimbabwe bowlers had two completely different sets of results in the first couple of matches of the series, bundling out the opposition for just 103 runs before conceding 234/2.

Zimbabwe squad for T20I Series

Sikandar Raza (c), Faraz Akram, Brian Bennett, Johnathan Campbell, Tendai Chatara, Luke Jongwe, Innocent Kaia, Clive Madande, Wessly Madhevere, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Wellington Masakadza, Brandon Mavuta, Blessing Muzarabani, Dion Myers, Antum Naqvi, Richard Ngarava, Milton Shumba

India

The Indian batting lineup put up a massive score in the second T20I with a maiden international hundred for Abhishek Sharma after he and team had a horrible outing in the first match. In the bowling side of things, India were quite good in both the matches of the series, restricting Zimbabwe for 115/9 in the first one before bundling them out for 134 in the second one.

India squad for first two T20Is of the Series

Shubman Gill (c), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Abhishek Sharma, Rinku Singh, Dhruv Jurel, Riyan Parag, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, Tushar Deshpande, Sai Sudharsan, Jitesh Sharma, Harshit Rana

Match Prediction




Conclusion

Zimbabwe will have to bat exceptionally well against a formidable Indian bowling attack, to push for another win in the series. That’s why, the third T20I is definitely for the taking as far as Team India are concerned, if they play anywhere close to their best level against Zimbabwe.
