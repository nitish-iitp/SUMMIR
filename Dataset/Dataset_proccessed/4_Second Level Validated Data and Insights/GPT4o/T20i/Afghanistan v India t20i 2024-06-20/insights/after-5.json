        "Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan: 'We knew we'd be chasing 160-170 given it was against a bigger team. We could've done it had we executed smarter.'",
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'The last two years we've played T20s here, so we understand the conditions and planned accordingly. We adapted well and got 180, which was a great effort from the batters. We had class bowlers who defended it perfectly.'",
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'Suryakumar and Hardik's partnership was critical at that point, we needed someone to bat deep which they did.'",
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'We know Bumrah's class and what he can do. Important for us to use him smartly regardless of conditions. He's willing to responsibility and he's been doing it for years.'",
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'We'll have to assess conditions, opposition and based on that we're open to make changes if required. We felt three spinners were good here, if it's seamer-friendly next time, we'll go with seamers.'",
        "Player of the match, India batter Suryakumar Yadav: 'There is a lot of hard work and practice behind my batting. When I got into the game I'm very clear in my mind what I want to do.'",
        "Player of the match, India batter Suryakumar Yadav: 'Rashid Khan is very difficult to pick, he's the best bowler in the world, you can't let him dominate, you have to be a step ahead. I managed to be on the right side today.'",
        "Player of the match, India batter Suryakumar Yadav: 'When Hardik came in I told him to keep the same intent. I'm really happy that we managed to get above 180.'"
