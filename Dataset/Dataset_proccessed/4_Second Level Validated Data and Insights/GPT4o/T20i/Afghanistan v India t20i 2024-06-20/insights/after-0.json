        "India will be wary of the Afghan bowling attack and not take them \u2018lightly\u2019 in their Super Eight match in Barbados.",
        "Afghanistan have played all their group matches in the Caribbean, where their bowlers and opening batters have led them to three wins in four outings.",
        "Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott believes his side will not be overawed by the occasion nor the opponents in Thursday\u2019s match and will take it on 'like any [other] game'.",
        "Trott admitted India will be favourites to win the game but that will also add pressure on Rohit Sharma\u2019s team.",
        "Trott mentioned that his team will take the players\u2019 records into account and 'not just recent form'.",
        "India\u2019s head coach Rahul Dravid praised Afghanistan\u2019s performance in the tournament thus far and said they are 'a very dangerous team' in the T20 format.",
        "Dravid said his team will be 'flexible' in how they approach the game based on the situation and ground conditions.",
        "Dravid acknowledged the challenge posed by Afghanistan\u2019s bowling attack, led by Fazalhaq Farooqi and Rashid Khan.",
        "The pitch in Barbados has not been a bowler\u2019s paradise but has offered some assistance in holding back the run-scoring.",
        "The weather is not expected to have a big role to play as it is a rain-free forecast with partial cloud cover and humid conditions during the day.",
        "India command a 7-0 lead over Afghanistan in their eight T20 encounters, while one game ended in a 'no result'.",
        "Both teams have bagged three wins each in their four matches in the tournament so far, but India are unbeaten while Afghanistan were handed a hammering by hosts West Indies in their last outing.",
        "Afghanistan are expected to field the same side that was handed a heavy loss by West Indies but also brought them three wins.",
        "Despite the temptation of playing leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, India are unlikely to ring any changes in their playing XI from their last completed match against the USA."
