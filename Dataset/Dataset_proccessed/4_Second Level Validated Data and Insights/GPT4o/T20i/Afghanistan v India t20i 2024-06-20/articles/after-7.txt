India captain Rohit Sharma on the win

“We adapted well and got 180, which was a great effort from the batters. We had class bowlers who defended it perfectly. Everyone came in and did their job, that’s critical and we dwell on it,” he said.

“SKY [Suryakumar] and Hardik’s partnership was critical at that point, we needed someone to bat deep, which they did. We know Bumrah’s class and what he can do. Important for us to use him smartly regardless of conditions. He’s willing to take responsibility and he’s been doing it for years.”

Rashid Khan on Afghanistan’s performance

“We knew we’d be chasing 160-170 given it was against a bigger team. We could’ve done it had we executed smarter,” he said.

On his own spell, which saw him take 3-26, he said: “My bowling has been coming out well, I struggled early in the IPL, but I am hitting the right areas consistently. But it’s the match result that matters most.

“We’ve enjoyed our cricket everywhere, but our mindset is what matters. If the conditions are helpful, we’ll use it depending on if it’s a batting or bowling track.”

Suryakumar Yadav: ‘Lots of routine’ behind my success

“A lot of hard work and practice has gone behind this. A lot of routine and process. I’m very clear about what to do when I go out. I don’t mind giving this award to a bowler as well. First for a batter, hopefully the first of many.”

Suryakumar Yadav is voted man of the match

No surprises there. His 53 off 28 came under trying circumstances, with India’s top order back in the pavilion by the halfway stage of the innings. The manner in which he shifted the pressure back on the bowlers with his stroke play and sizzle makes him a worthy player of the match. Another key contribution from him, following his innings against USA. Much like India themselves, Suryakumar is peaking at the right time.

Innovation and excellence 🔥

Nice and easy for India

Superb play with the bat and ball today from India. Suryakumar Yadav starred with the bat, ably supported by Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant to help India reach 181 on a difficult pitch.

The Indian bowlers were on it right from the get-go, dismissing the deadly Afghani openers Gurbaz and Zadran early in the powerplay. Wickets fell at regular intervals as Afghanistan failed to build any partnerships in their innings.

A real signal of intent from India. The World Cup final will be played at the same ground, and if India continue the same way, they’ll back themselves to be back here.
