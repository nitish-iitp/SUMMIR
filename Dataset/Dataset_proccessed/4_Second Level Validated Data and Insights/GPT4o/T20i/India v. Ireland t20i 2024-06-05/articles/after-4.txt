India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit, India captain

Yeah, just a little sore (the arm). I said it at the toss as well. Quite unsure of what to expect from the pitch. Not aware on what it is to play like on a pitch that's five months old. I don't think the wicket settled down even when we batted second. There was enough for the bowlers. That's pretty much what you gotta do. Try to hit those lengths consistently. All these guys have played a lot of Test cricket. Arshdeep is the only guy who hasn't. His two wickets upfront set the tone for us. Don't think we can play four spinners here (laughs). When we picked the team, we wanted to have the balance. If conditions are there for seamers, we wanted to have that. Spin will play a part later on. Today was a four-seamer pitch and we still managed to get two spinners who are allrounders. I don't know what to expect from the pitch to be honest. We will prepare as if the conditions are going to be like this (for Pakistan game). This is going to be a kind of game where all XI of us will need to contribute. It was scratchy, but good to spend some time in the middle and understand what kind of shots to play there.

05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Stirling, Ireland captain

Toss played a crucial part - stuck in to bat in overcast conditions. We needed to put a bit of pressure back on the Indian bowlers. They didn't really miss that often. Their groupings and lengths were outstanding. Any time in the middle is crucial for us. We'll be back here for a couple of days. Will give it a good crack against Canada.

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup:Jasprit Bumrah Player Of The Match

Coming from India, with the ball seaming around, I wouldn't complain when there's help for bowlers. In this format you have to adapt to the conditions, you have to be proactive. Trying to stick to the plans and trying to go back to what has worked for me. You always want to cover all the bases in these conditions. You got to be prepared, very happy with the outing today.

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: IND beat IRE by 8 wickets in New York

Rishab Pant plays his vintage reverse sweep of seamer over the keeper for a six to finish off things for India. It has been a bit scratchy but such has been the nature of the wicket here in New York. Irrespective of what the wicket has done it has been a solid performance from India and would be happy with their performance and two points.

22:48 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 12.1 overs IND 91/2

Suryakumar Yadav tried to finish the game with a single shot and got undone by the leg-spin off White and was caught at cow corner. It will be interesting to see how Surya would adopt to longer boundaries and slower surfaces in these conditions.

22:42 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 11 overs IND 85/1

Rohit Sharma has walked back as retired hurt as the ball hit his shoulder. Surya has walked into the ball. The pitch is still having indifferent bounce and there might be plenty of discussion about it ahead of Sunday's game.

22:34 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10 overs IND 76/1

Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has reached his half-century. What a lovely inning this has been from the skipper. He played and missed a few but he is still there and scoring his runs. It will greatly boost his confidence going forward in the tournament.

22:28 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 9 overs IND 65/1

Finally the big over both batters were looking to get out of the way came. Little bowled a touch too short in that over Rohit pulled for a couple of majestic sixes. This has been a good bowling performance all in all form Ireland without much help from the surface.

22:23 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 8.1 overs IND 52/1

India is halfway there. It has not been pleasing from their end either but most of these players coming on back off IPL where 250 was a regularity have to unlearn everything and start adapting to these conditions as quickly as possible.

22:18 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7.1 overs IND 44/1

Campher comes into the attack and he too finds the right length. However, there seems to be not much moisture in the surface to give that additional oomph the Indian bowlers got in the first innings. There have been plenty of play and misses from Indian batters as well.

22:14 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 6.1 overs IND 40/1

Rohit Sharma played a love shot through point when Little pitched one up to end the boundary drought. It is a decent power play for India. Though India might have lost as many wickets as Ireland it has not been easy for them either. 

22:10 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 5.2 overs IND 33/1

Pant has played 20 shots in his eight-ball innings for his six. The pitch is doing a lot and he looking to counter which might be the right thing however, from time to time it might be wise for him to pick an odd single and keep the scoreboard moving. 

22:06 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 4.2 overs IND 31/1

McCarthy comes into the attack and he looks to hit a hard length. While there is no seam moment as such in the first innings but there seems a bit two paced nature to the wicket and the odd ball is bouncing a little more. However, India has got to a solid start here.

22:01 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 3.1 overs IND 26/1

Adair picks the big fish of Virat Kohli. The talisman tries to charge down the track and whack the bowler on the off-side and gets the edge which flies to the third man who takes a simple catch. Better lengths from Irish bowlers pulling them back.

21:56 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 2.1 overs IND 22/0

Ireland has not got their lengths with the new ball. The Indians hit back-of-light and let the ball seam around however, Ireland is looking to swing the ball by pitching it up which has happened in the first innings. In their pursuit of the magic delivery, they are slipping in loose ones.

21:49 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 1.1 overs IND 8/0

First over done Rohit of the final ball tried to cut the ball and second slip scampered the chance. It was a difficult one but if Ireland has to make a match out of it they need to take such chances. The seam moment is a lot more minimal than what we have seen in the morning.

21:40 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Hardik Pandya at toss

Always special to play for the country, always good to play for pride. I have been able to contribute in the World Cups, god has been kind. That was an outstanding effort by Axar, those are the catches when you let your hand-eye co-ordination let in. I really liked the first wicket, don't hit the stumps often as I usually bowl short of a length. I needed to be fuller than back of a length today. On this kind of surface you need to be disciplined and hit the right areas. It's always fantastic to see the crowd, we Indians are everywhere, we rule the world, good to have their support.

21:29 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: IRE 96 all out vs IND in New York

It was a tame way to end the innings just when it looked like Ireland where going to get around the 110 mark with Delany's knock the batter got himself run trying to keep the strike for the next over off a free hit delivery. It is a tricky pitch and it won't be easy for India a couple of early wickets Ireland will be in the game.

21:20 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 15 overs IRE 79/9

Bumrah comes and does what Bumrah does bowls a yorker and picks Little and kills any hope Ireland had of late burst. Until India bats it is hard to predict if it is the surface or where Ireland is too cautious with the bat. In any case, it has not been a good spectacle for T20 cricket.

21:15 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 14.1 overs IRE 77/8

Another decent over from Ireland's perspective Jadeja came into the attack though it was not a 10-run over both the batters looked comfortable against the spinner. It will be interesting to see how Rohit uses his fifth bowler quota he also has the option of Dube if he wants.

21:12 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 13.2 overs IRE 70/8

We have had the most expensive over of the innings it came from Hardik who gave away 14 runs. Ireland has now reached its 60s. If they can manage their way to 100-mark the way the pitch is playing and with the attack they have they might give India a fight.

21:07 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 12.1 overs IRE 58/8

Axar Patel comes in and strikes. It was a fabulous catch from the left-arm spinner of his bowling. Ireland have now lost eight wickets. The way this wicket has played today it will be interesting to see what sort of wicket we will see for big India-Pakistan game.

21:02 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 11 overs IRE 49/7

Hardik Pandya comes in and picks his third wicket in three overs. Adair whose idea was to go after the bowling tried to cut the ball and got the bottom edge to the sweeper. Ireland is now seven down once again a disappointing pitch provided in New York.

20:54 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10 overs IRE 49/6

Mohammed Siraj comes back into attack and picks a wicket. Dockrell tried to play a cross-batted shot and the ball got high on the bat and long on fielder, Bumrah takes a catch after a drop earlier in the over.

20:49 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 9.2 overs IRE 46/5

Another wicket fell it Campher who tried to push the score on got the outside edge as he tried to fend the ball off the length. Ireland have now lost five wickets. They need to find a way to build a partnership to get around 100-mark.

20:44 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 8.2 overs IRE 43/3

Jasprit Bumrah comes into bowl the second over and he picks Tector. He bowls a surprise bumper and the batter does not expect it. The ball hit the glove and then the helmet and looped up in the air for the fielder inside the ring to take a simple catch at mid-on.

20:39 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7.1 overs IRE 33/3

Hardik comes into the attack and picks a wicket in the very first over. Tucker who has been in good form tried to drive Hardik's length delivery on the up but the ball seemed to have hit a green patch and moved in sharply and hit the middle stump of the batter. 

20:32 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 6 overs IRE 26/2

Bumrah comes into the attack and he starts with a maiden. While the ball is not climbing off the length as steeply it did in the first couple of overs there is still an indifference bounce off the pitch. It will be interesting to see how this surface plays under lights. 

20:29 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 5.1 overs IRE 26/2

It was a lengthy over from Arshdeep Singh he bowled a couple of wide deliveries and one ran away for a boundary. Rohit looked a little frustrated as there was still plenty on offer on this surface and the bowler missed his mark. It might be wise for Tector or Tucker to counterattack bowling and disturb the Indian lengths. 

20:21 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 4.1 overs IRE 13/2

Siraj too is getting a lot of seam moments but the problem is he has not been able to find the right length that will hit the top of the off-stump. The bowler seems to be a bit rusty in this spell. Ireland's challenges will only double once Bumrah comes into the attack.

20:17 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 3.1 overs IRE 9/2

That is a cracking over from Arshdeep Singh first it was a wobble seam delivery which Stirling tried to hit on the leg-side got the outside edge and the ball went in the air which Pant took and of the last ball he bowled a seam-up delivery which went straight but Balbirne played for a one coming back in got himself bowled.

20:10 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 2.1 overs IRE 7/1

Mohammed Siraj took the new ball from the other end and there was a steep bounce of the length. This might be another low-scoring affair today and one more interesting thing is India is reluctant to use Bumrah with a new ball. As we update Arshdeep Singh picks up Paul Stirling.

20:06 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 1.1 overs IRE 3/0

We finished the opening over, and Arshdeep Singh took the new ball. The ball did not move much off the air but there is some help available on the surface and one noticeable thing was when Striling pushed one through covers the ball slowed down as it went on to the outfield.

19:58 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Let's go

The national anthems are done the ground is filled with blue. It is a bit gloomy here in New York the Indian new ball bowlers will get some moment initially. We have seen how Sri Lanka vs South Africa went it will be interesting to see how the surface behaves today.

63 meters square boundary on one side, 72 on the other, and 74 meters straight boundary. Outfield, which was sluggish in last game, has been given an extra cut. Surface looks okay. It's pitch number four, SA-SL was on pitch number one. 180 was scored by India in the warm-up game here.

Coming with pretty good prep, we were in Amsterdam recently. We've got plenty of matchwinners in our side, want them to show up on the day. We're looking to assess conditions early.

19:35 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma at toss

We're going to bowl. Preparations have been alright. Have been managing ourselves in these new conditions. Has been challenging but we are all professionals. We played on a similar pitch and do know what to expect a little bit. I know it's going to be slightly different from what we're used to. But that's what the sport is. Not sure about the conditions too much, so thought having a target in front of us would be good. Guys missing out are Kuldeep, Sanju, Jaiswal and one more.

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rahul Dravid on leaving coaching job part 2

“It’s no different for me. I love doing the job. I’ve really enjoyed coaching India and I think it’s a truly special job to do. I enjoyed working with this team and it’s a great bunch of boys to work with,” Dravid said.

“To be very honest, I don’t see this as anything particularly different or significant. It’s from the first day I took the job. I always felt that every game was important and every game mattered. And that will not change,” he added.

19:21 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rahul Dravid on leaving coaching job

India head coach Rahul Dravid on Monday confirmed that the ongoing T20 World Cup is his last dance with the national team, furthermore expressing his doubts over re-applying for the job owing to the schedule of the national team.

“It is going to be the last one that I am in-charge of,” Dravid said ahead of India’s first game against Ireland in New York. “Yeah, just considering, unfortunately, the kind of schedules and where I find myself at this stage in my life, I don’t think I’ll be able to re-apply. So yeah, obviously it’ll be my last one.”

Dravid took over as the India head coach in November 2021. His initial contract with the national side had come to an end after the 2023 ODI World Cup, and was extended to June 2024 after the team managed to produce a near-perfect campaign until the loss to Australia in the final.

05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma says he tried to convince head coach Rahul Dravid to stay beyond T20 World Cup: ‘It’s been very fruitful’

“I tried convincing him to stay, but obviously there are a lot of things that he needs to look after as well. But yeah, I personally enjoyed my time with him,” Rohit told reporters in New York on Tuesday.

Looking back at his tenure as captain alongside Dravid as head coach, Rohit shared that the experience of learning subtle leadership traits from his ‘role model’ – also his first India captain, coincidentally in a game vs Ireland – was ‘very fruitful’

“He was my first international captain when I made my debut in Ireland. Then I’ve seen him play while I was just coming into the team (for) Test matches when he was captain. And such a big role model for all of us,” Rohit said.

19:09 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Samson vs Axar

The final call would be between Samson and Axar. Samson’s inclusion would likely offer him a floating role between 3 and 5, while Axar could beef up the lower-order batting and spin department at number 8 behind Jadeja. The bowling department will continue to revolve around the verve of Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav. Left-armer Arshdeep Singh is likely to pip Mohammed Siraj as the second seamer as Hardik and Dube will offer a share of overs beside the spinners.

19:04 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Pant's struggles against spin

Pant has also struggled heavily against spin upon his return in the IPL, where he scored 153 runs at a 119.53 strike-rate with five dismissals, indicating that a middle-overs entry may not be favourable from a team perspective. Instead, the left-hander could be the differentiator at number three between the openers and Suryakumar at number three, where he struck a half-century against Bangladesh in the warm-ups and holds a marginally better career record when compared to other positions.

19:00 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Will Jaiswal open

If the left-handed Jaiswal is to separate the trio and open with Rohit, India will have wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja at numbers 5-6-7, posing a rigid transition towards the bowling department. It also will tie down the management’s hands in experimenting with the big-hitting Shivam Dube somewhere in the middle-order. Jaiswal’s wavering form on livelier pitches during the IPL may also go against him.

18:56 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: How has New York ground been

Conditions in New York – a sluggish outfield, vast square boundaries and drop-in strips of variable bounce – may have suddenly raised the T20 stocks of anchors and accumulators at the World Cup. With three of their four Group A games marked at the venue, India will have to remain flexible in terms of their combinations to ward off Ireland, Pakistan and hosts United States in that order before gearing up for the slow tracks in the Caribbean for the Super 8s.

18:50 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rahul Dravid on the India XI for the game

"In a Playing XI and in a T20 game, there'll always be that one or two slots that you might make the odd change. In general, we are quite settled with a combination in our heads, though I haven't announced it or I haven't said it. You know, honestly, we are very clear about the direction we're going in, the direction we're going in, but we've picked a squad, you know, that allows us to maybe make those one or two changes based on the condition"

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Paul Stirling on Ireland XI

"It will be the morning of the match when we decide - I think because we haven't actually seen the ground yet. I think we've got to sort of keep everyone waiting on that front, but we're probably down to 12 or 13 if we're going to be honest. But we won't make the final call without seeing what we've got to play on."

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Ireland player to watch out for

Harry Tector’s highest T2OI score is against India when he smashed 64 off 33 balls against a second-string attack. Recently, he scored a belligerent 56 off 34 balls against Rashid Khan’s Afghanistan. He will be Ireland’s key player to negotiate India’s spinners in the middle.

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Indian player to watch out for

Hardik Pandya’s bowling form will indicate how India fares in this competition. At the Cantiague Park nets on Monday, Pandya spent considerable time bowling to Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav and Rohit. If he can bowl at least three overs every day, the Indian team can also look to play Shivam Dube and include an extra spinner in the line-up.

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: What does SA vs SL game say about New York pitch

Another aspect that could trouble India’s batsmen is the height of the bowlers. Adair is 6 feet 4; Little stands at 6 feet three; McCarthy, Campher and leg-spinner Ben White are 6 feet one; Young is 6 feet 2. Tall seamers with brisk pace could be a devilish entity if the surface abets indifferent bounce, as it did in the game between South Africa and Sri Lanka. The pitch could have been an aberration, as the drop-in wickets tend to take some time to bed in and reveal their true nature. Playing on the pitch, like the game in the country, is a leap into the unknown. Not just the deck, which became slower and spun big as the South Africa-Sri Lanka game progressed, the slow sandy outfield too is a challenge.

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Can Indian's adopt to conditions?

Pampered with belters and lightning fast outfields in IPL, India’s batsmen would have to make the required adjustments. Sure enough that they are aware and experienced, but Ireland would be lurking in the shadows ready to pounce on half a mis-step.

The sizeable Indian diaspora is expected to flock to the arena, with the tri-colour paint splashed on their face and drums in tow; the Irish fans, despite the immense immigrant spread, could be fewer, but big on enthusiasm and noise blowing out from their pipes and drums, the shirts in shamrock-print glaring proudly amidst an expected sea of blue.

India vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup: The Irish threat

But if the stars twinkle, if fortune winks, Ireland have the power, poise and experience to strike hot. Mark Adair and Josh Little could move the ball both ways in the air and off the seam, when conditions ally; Craig Young generates bounce. Such a combination has tormented India’s openers, even if neither induces fear like a Shaheen Shah Afridi or Mitchell Starc or Trent Boult. Steady movement could be as deceptive as blinding pace. The Johannesburg-born all-rounder Curtis Campher is touted a game-changer, the most talented cricketer to arrive in Ireland; the spin veteran George Dockrell can apply the chokehold. Often, a lone phase, or a standout spell could define a T20 game. There is considerable all-round depth—McCarthy, slotted at No 9, has scored a half-century in this format. Seven of the first-eleven players could bowl too. It’s an ensemble cast, but sometimes they suffice for a heist.

Can the tall Ireland pacers trouble Indian batsmen on the drop-in pitch?

The World Cup has reached the American shores, but it would take India’s tournament-opener against Ireland to breathe life into it and for the arena to gather noise and sway to the tunes of the game. The mood would be one of party, before the real deal, the supposed landscape changer, next Sunday between India and Pakistan.

The Ireland game, thus, has the guise of a feeler, a glorified warm-up fixture, an uneven contest, in scale and stature, to excite the neutral cricket tragic. The chasm between the two are wide—India are ranked the number one in the world, whereas Ireland occupy the eleventh spot; Ireland have lost all seven of their T20I games against the more vaunted foes, who have reached at least the semifinals of the tournament on four instances, a team in red-hot form, having lost only two of their last 14 games in this format, as opposed to an erratic team that has lost eight of their last 14.
