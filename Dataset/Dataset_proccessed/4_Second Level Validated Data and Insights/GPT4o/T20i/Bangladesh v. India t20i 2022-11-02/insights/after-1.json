    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India's captain Rohit Sharma: 'I was calm and nervous at the same time but it was important for us as a group to stay calm and execute the plans because it was a shortened game and could go either way with 10 wickets in hand, but I thought we held our nerve pretty well and it was a good win in the end.'",
        "Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan: 'It has been the story of us against India. We are always almost there but never cross the line. It was a good game. The crowd enjoyed, we enjoyed it. But in the end someone had to win and someone had to lose.'",
        "On Litton Das' form: 'He is batting really well. He is probably our best batsman at the moment. The way he batted in the first six overs gave us a lot of momentum and we started to believe.'",
        "On bowling Taskin Ahmed out at start of India's innings: 'Our plan was to get India's top order out quickly and Taskin has been our main bowler. Unfortunately he couldn't get wickets today but he was unlucky and very economical.'",
        "On the rest of their World Cup: 'We have been very relaxed this tournament. We have not been talking about it in the dressing room. We wanted to enjoy this World Cup. We played a good game of cricket. We have one game left and I hope we can continue this.'",
        "India's batsman Virat Kohli: 'It was a pretty close game, not as close as we would have liked it to be but it was another good day with the bat and I was just trying to play myself into the innings.'",
        "Virat Kohli: 'Today was different and I felt like I was striking it really well. I'm just in a happy place I don't want to compare and this present moment I'm happy to contribute for my team.'",
        "Virat Kohli: 'As soon as I knew the World Cup is in Australia I was grinning. You need good shots here like the ones you play in the Subcontinent.'",
        "Virat Kohli: 'I played a lot of good cricketing shots its just an extension for me in any format and I know that kind of game awareness would come in handy.'",
        "Virat Kohli: 'I absolutely love playing in this crowd. It makes me feel at home and this ground and wicket has been really kind to me.'"
