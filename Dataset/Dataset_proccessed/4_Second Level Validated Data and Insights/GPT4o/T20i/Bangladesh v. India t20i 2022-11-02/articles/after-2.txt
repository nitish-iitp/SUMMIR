Virat Kohli | Player of the Match Speaks:

Pretty close game. Not as close as we would have liked it to be. A good day with the bat. When I went in there was a bit of pressure. I didn't want little mistakes to curb my instincts. I am in a happy place. I don't want to compare it with the past. As soon as I knew the WC is in Australia, I was grinning from ear to ear. Good cricketing shots will be the key here is what I know. Hitting through the line is what I do in every format. It is just an extension for me. I love playing at this ground. This makes me feel at home. When I come to Adelaide, I am meant to enjoy myself and keep batting.

IND vs BAN Live: ALL OVER! INDIA WIN

Nurul Hasan hits a maximum and then smashes a four. The equation is now 7 needed of 1 ball and a six to tie. Arshdeep Singh is under pressure. But a very good ball at the last and India survive a mighty scare. The way India came back after the rain break back was seriously impressive. With this win, they go to the top of the table

IND vs BAN Live: Arshdeep, Nurul - young and very brave at the crunch ðŸŒ¿ðŸ”¥

In the end, it came down to between two youngsters who have tried to remain calm under pressure. In his brief career, Arshdeep has shown his temperament. On the other side, Nurul Hasan, once very emotional, has consciously tried to get it under control and remain calm. 20 runs needed, two young men at it. 'I was a very emotional guy earlier but I really worked hard in this area and I haven't turned into who I am today all of a sudden. I worked on myself for two-three years because I felt I needed to improve in this area (controlling my emotions).”
That was Nurul Hasan earlier this year. And boy did he walk the talk at the biggest stage at the World Cup. With 20 needed off the final Arshdeep over, he smashed a pull over deep square-leg that silenced the Indians at the crowd.
Arshdeep adjusted well by trying yorkers, real full balls, and Hasan got a few runs but no boundaries. With 10 needed off the final 2, Hasan went not only right back but also outside off, and Arshdeep stuck to his yorker plan. He only changed the line to outside off and Hasan sliced it calmly to point boundary.
with Six needed off the final ball, Arshdeep kept his cool and slipped in a real full ball and though Hasan tried valiantly, he couldn't get under it with any power or elevation.

IND vs BAN Live: Valiant Taskin giving it one good goÂ 

When he backed away in the penultimate over and smashed Hardik Pandya to the extra cover boundary, Taskin Ahmed would keep nodding his head at the partner. As if he were saying, ‘don’t you worry, I am not going down without a fight.' He had bowled a dream spell, bowling out his four overs with the new ball for just 15 runs, and there he was now, swinging away to push India close. Hardik responded with a short ball, Taskin absolutely thumped it over deep square-leg boundary. He had done everything that was possible, and had left Bangladesh needing 20 from the final over. "20 is a lot, but 20 is not impossible," Ravi Shastri would say on air.

IND vs BAN Live: The shoe-cleaner brush is out

Raghu is the throwdown specialist in the Indian team for years now. He is also the handyman in need. He was out there prowling the boundary with a big brush. Reason? To scrape the soles of the shoes of Indian players to enable them to move freely on the wet outfield. He would remove the slush off the boot-feet with the thick brush, and also offer them some water

Taskin Ahmed is not done yet and slams a four and a six off Hardik Pandya. 21 needed off 9. Its still not over.

IND vs BAN Live: Keep Axar away from the left-handers ðŸ«£

Rain and DLS may have forced his hand, but in rotating his pacers and refusing to give the ball to Axar Patel, Rohit Sharma prevented an onslaught from Shakib Al Hassan. Shakib set himself up to beat the spin after moving in the crease cleverly and getting back-to-back boundaries off Ashwin. And it was likely to get worse against Axar. Left-arm spinners are generally vulnerable to left-handers, but Axar has been particularly weak. His T20I economy rate against left-handers is 8.58 as opposed to 6.68 against right-handers. The Indian team has been well aware of this weakness - he has bowled just 857 balls to left-hand batters and 2385 to right-handers in his career. Playing Axar against a team packed with three left-handers in the top order may seem like an unnecessary risk now.

IND vs BAN Live: Pandya Power strikes

You cant keep Hardik Pandya out of the game. He too picks up two in an over. Yasir Ali and Mosaddek Hossain are back in the dug out. Bangladesh have lost 4/9 in 11 balls. How quickly the game can change. But credit to India for keeping their cool and doing the right things. Score after 13 overs, BAN: 108/6

IND vs BAN Live: When the pinkie fingers interlock ðŸ§¤

Suryakumar Yadav would take two good catches but perhaps the toughest one was swallowed by Deepak Hooda. The stakes were higher: Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh’s best batsman in these circumstances. And it was a real swirling high skier. Hooda settled down under the slog at deep midwicket and waited. Just as the ball dropped, he had his pinkie fingers interlocked - old-school style - and waited. The ball plonked into his palms, on the fingers, and the interlocking had worked.

Arshdeep Singh snares Afif Hossain in the first ball of the over and then picks up the big wicket of Shakib Al Hasan on the fifth delivery of the same over. Is this the game-changing over? W 0 1 0 W 1 = 2 from the over. Score after 12 overs, BAN: 101/4

IND vs BAN Live: Slip, then fall ðŸ›ðŸ•³ï¸

First came the slip and then the fall. The first ball upon resumption, Litton Das slipped while turning for the second run. He grimaced in pain and required treatment on his left forearm. The next ball he was to be run out courtesy a bullet direct hit by KL Rahul from deep midwicket. Das dived spectacularly at the non-striker’s end trying to make the crease. But he could not. And he knew as well, as he vigorously punched the turf. As the umpires confirmed the decision, Das slumped to the ground, cursing his wretched luck.

IND vs BAN Live: Marvelloushh run-out, KL Rahul ðŸ‘ðŸ½ðŸ‘ðŸ½ðŸ‘ðŸ½ðŸ‘ðŸ½ðŸ‘ðŸ½ðŸŽ³ðŸŽ¯

Was it KL Rahul’s best direct-hit run-out of his career? Surely, the most important one yet. Off he rushed forward from sweeper cover to his left, got around the ball, saw the batsman Litton Das stutter on his second run, and fired a direct hit at the non-striker’s end. If Richie Benaud were there on air, he would have given us the precise distance in yards. “Marvelloushh, that would be 70 yardsh, on a wet outfield where the spikes would have caught and the throw can skid off the grassh…I remember Keith Miller doing it in 1956.” Or words to that effect. Marvellous throw it was. Ashwin, the bowler, realised there was a chance of a direct hit and started to back away from the stumps to allow it a direct path. Boom! Gone. 
Litton Das was furious with his partner for that call. He was playing like a dream, but a nightmarish end left him fuming his way to the hut.

IND vs BAN Live: India's iffy recent record defending: lost 4 off 7 ðŸ§ðŸ«¡

It is not just Litton Das who is troubling India in Adelaide; they have had some issues defending targets recently. From the time they lost to Pakistan in the Asia Cup in September, India have failed to defend a target in four out of seven matches – against Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Dubai, against Australia in Mohali and against South Africa in Perth. Two of the three wins have come against the likes of Afghanistan and Netherlands, and even in the remaining third game, David Miller had given them a mighty scare with a 46-ball century in Guwahati, as South Africa fell short of a mammoth total of 237 by just 16 runs.

IND vs BAN Live: DK just can't seem to catch a break today ðŸ§¤.....â­•ðŸ¤ðŸ¾ðŸ˜’

Dinesh Karthik stood blinking behind the stumps and stole a glance at the giant screen as the ball popped out of his gloves after Litton Das nicked a Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivery. It was the second time in the space of six balls that the cameras zoomed in on a glum Karthik, whose spot in the playing 11 is already under immense scrutiny.
First, it was when Arshdeep Singh's away-swinger found the outside edge of Das. The ball was dipping on Karthik, who dived forward. For a moment, it looked like he'd got the gloves underneath the ball but replays showed it fell just short, giving Das a reprieve. Six balls later, Karthik threw himself horizontally to his right, arms outstretched after Das, once again, edged a ball that was shaping out. With Rahul at first slip positioned wide, Karthik decided to go for the catch but could not hold on to the ball. Das, who lit up Bangladesh's chase, survived the scares while all Karthik could do is bury his face in his hands, wearing a sullen look.

Bad news from the middle as the rain comes in and stops the play. The players are going off and the covers are going on. India will now regroup and think what to do about this marauding Bangladesh innings. The Tigers are now 17 runs ahead of the DLS par score. BAN 66/0 after 7 overs.

Bangladesh openers putting India under the pump ðŸ¤ ðŸ¤  & ðŸ¤’

Litton Das has lit up Bangladesh’s chase with his 50 coming off 21 balls. Just the other day Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan had candidly admitted that they weren't quite here to "win the  World Cup" but if they win this game, given India are favourites, this will count as an upset. The way Das and Najmol Shanto have given Bangladesh the desired start, the Indian team has certainly looked lost after this attack. The Indian pacers looked clueless in front of a superb batting feast by the Bangladesh top order.

IND vs BAN Live: Litton's Wisdom shines through ðŸ‘‚ðŸ½ðŸŽ§ðŸ«µðŸ¤«

Last month, during the tri-series in New Zealand, Litton Das posted a video of himself listening to Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan after a match. The caption of the one-minute video read: “Learning never stops”. First came Babar’s wisdom: “The less you listen of the others, the better. You have to be pressure-less. People will keep on talking, even if you perform. You should listen to yourself.” Next was Rizwan’s turn: “You should hit the restart button to start fresh. You will score zero, 10 and even a 100. The situation will be different if you can hold yourself differently in the dressing room. This way you will find many others in the dressing room who are as strong as Shakib al Hasan mentally.” Soon after he posted this on Twitter, a section of Bangladeshi fans brutally trolled him. Like, “He needs to be spoon-fed,” or “Take him to the Pakistan side.” But Das took everything in his stride and posted “shut out the noise,” emoticon. He has shut himself away from all the noise and has been riding a rich vein of form - 51 * off 21. After his 34 against South Africa, he provided his team the perfect start by slamming three fours off Arshdeep Singh’s second over before pulling Bhuvneshwar Kumar over the midwicket fence.  Words of wisdom now being converted into valuable runs.

IND vs BAN Live Score: Statuesque marvellous Kohli Six ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’«ðŸªðŸŒŸ

Virat Kohli has not just struck sixes in this tournament, but hit those that would stay eternally in the eye and mind of the spectators. The six off Hasan Mahmud in the 19th over was a sparkling gem. The ball was pitched up, a yorker gone awry perhaps. Kohli’s front-foot glided forth to the pitch of the ball and with a firm, fluid bat-swing he drove him straight over his head, up and over, the high front-elbow winking at the skies, Kolhi striking a statuesque pose in the follow-throw for the shutterbugs to frenziedly capture that image and save it for posterity. The six perhaps was not as difficult, or executed under such immense pressure as in the Pakistan game, but on the grandeur-scale, this was an equal.- Sandip G

Dinesh Karthik kept shaking his head in rage as he walked back to the pavilion after he was run out. He would thud his pad violently with the bat and kept cursing himself. Short of runs, his place under scrutiny and having just struck a sweet four, Karthik was desperate to make this opportunity count against his favourite opponent. A careless run-out was the last thing he would have wished for. There was a touch of comedy about the incident. Virat Kohli had just tipped the ball to cover, timing the ball sweeter than he had thought. But Karthik had taken off, he was within touching distance of Kohli when the latter shouted at him to return. Karthik made a frantic sprint back and leapt full-pelt, but the throw was fast and accurate enough to catch him short of the crease. After he scrambled back to his feet, he wildly gesticulated to Kohli that there indeed was a run in it. But Kohli would nod his head in disapproval. Whatever, Karthik wasted perhaps the most golden opportunity to retain his spot.

IND vs BAN Live Score: Shakib not amused by Kohli's no-ball prompt; but all ends amicablyÂ  ðŸ‘‰ðŸ½ðŸ˜¯

Virat Kohli swung a bouncer from Hasan Mahmud on a couple of bounces to deep square leg and immediately raised his right hand towards the square-leg umpire Chris Brown, reminding him it was the second delivery of the over above shoulder height and hence a no-ball. As a free hit was awarded, Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan ran upto Kohli, put an arm around him smilingly and seemed to tell the umpires that “just because” it was Virat Kohli who was asking for the no-ball, they were calling it so. When he had swung the high full toss from Mohammad Nawaz for six in the last over against Pakistan, Kohli had instantly raised his right hand towards the square-leg umpire Marais Erasmus, who was at the bowler’s end in the Hasan Mahmud over today. It was all sorted out amicably between Kohli and Shakib eventually.

IND vs BAN Live Score: Wily-er Shakib goes snapping away ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜µðŸ«¡ðŸ¤¥

Left arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan is a wily fox, not the kind of spinner against whom a batsman can claim they are 'in'. Even in T20s. Shakib can be irritatingly accurate but also can make subtle changes in pace without too much of change in his arm speed. He had dismissed  KL Rahul when he got the India  opener to top edge when he tried to lap to fine leg.  A little quicker than Rahul expected. Then he got one to bounce to which Suryakumar Yadav tried to slog sweep. Yadav was lucky as Mustafizur Rahman couldn't clasp after getting to the ball. However, he got Yadav a few balls later with a little drift. This was slower and Yadav went too early for the cut. A rare mistimed shot for the in-form Yadav. A smart change of pace from Shakib.

Hits it straight to backward point. The short delivery could have gone anywhere but lands straight to the fielders hands. Hasan picks up his second wicket. The tactic to bowl short to Hardik has worked. Remember- pacers have bowled 65.2 percent of deliveries Hardik Pandya on back of a length/short.

Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma must be relieved after KL Rahul came good with a half century after his last three innings read 4, 9, 9. The Indian team management had been backing him and will continue to back him as they believed in him and saw what Rahul brings to the table. Batting coach Vikram Rathour and Dravid seemed to be having a relieved laugh as Rahul was about to reach his 50 runs mark. After all it was key for openers to click in these big tournaments.

Suryakumar Yadav was twice lucky in the 12th over bowled by Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan. He tried to sweep the first ball hard, but top-edged it behind the wicketkeeper. Mustafizur Rahman made a dash for it from short fine leg, but even as he stretched out both hands, the ball slid through between his palms. He was running to his 'wrong side', he is a left-hander, Sunil Gavaskar immediately pointed out on air, never one to miss out on this particular detail. Four balls later, Suryakumar went after an 87kph delivery that Shakib fired full outside off, but a thin edge rushed above the wicketkeeper’s gloves for two runs this time.

IND vs BAN Live Score: Circling the short, square boundary ðŸ›žðŸŸ¥ðŸ”˜ã€°ï¸ðŸ”

Coach Rahul Dravid had said ahead of the Bangladesh game that teams that were able to utilise the different boundary dimensions on Australian grounds well would be successful in this T20 World Cup. The square boundaries at Adelaide Oval are pretty short, in the early 60-meters, compared to the massive straight boundaries. And KL Rahul used them superbly. Three of his four sixes were hit square, one picked up over deep square leg, and the other two slashed and sliced over the off side. And two of his three fours were slashed square as well.

IND vs BAN Live Score: Fifty and OUT!

KL Rahul falls just after bringing up his fifty.  Rahul gets to his 21st T20I fifty in 31 deliveries and then departs on the next delivery. Shakib breaks the dangerous stand. But Virat Kohli is unbeaten on 23 (18) as India eyes a big total against Bangladesh. SKY joins Kohli in the middle. Score after 10 overs, IND: 86/2

IND vs BAN Live Score: Taskin's Test match frugal figures ðŸ¤—ðŸ‘¨ðŸ»â€ðŸ”§ðŸ”©

Taskin Ahmed has been Bangladesh’s best bowler in this T20 World Cup. He produced an excellent Powerplay spell of 3-0-10-0 against India, and would bowl his four overs on the trot for just 15 runs, but was extremely unlucky to not pick up a wicket or two. He had Rohit Sharma dropped at deep square leg, he beat KL Rahul and Virat Kohli on the outside edge, and saw two attacking Kohli shots just clear the fielders at cover and slip. He consistently got the ball to move away just a bit or hold its line outside off, from a good length or just short of it. He ended his spell with a Test-match line and length – good ending on off stump – which KL Rahul could only tap square for a single.

IND vs BAN Live Score: 13 off 1 ball ðŸ¤¯

Shoriful Islam is being taken to the cleaners by KL Rahul. He slams three sixes (including one off a no-ball) and a four. "He is switched on," says the commentator on air. 24 runs come off the over. Rahul has moved on to 48 from 30 balls. Score after 9 overs, IND: 76/1

IND vs BAN Live Score: Packed off side field ðŸŸï¸â†ªï¸

Indian teams are traditionally good on the off-side; anything short there, they like to cut hard. Bangladesh had tried to cut all spaces for the Indian team on the off-side. For Virat Kohli, they tried to pack the area so that Kohli couldn’t play his traditional on-the-rise punch shot. It happened soon as Kohli came out to bat. Taskin Ahmed had a slip, a point, another fielder next to point, cover, extra cover and a mid-off. Kohli went chasing one, didn’t find the middle of the bat but it sailed over the head of cover for four. Within powerplay, Bangladesh had tried its best to cramp Indians' flowing arms.

IND vs BAN Live Score: FOURRRR

FOUR! Poor from Shakib and Rahul was happy to pounce on it. Shortish in length and its slammed past deep mid for a four. Rahul is looking in good touch here.10 from the over and the fifty is up for India. Score after 8 overs, IND: 52/1

IND vs BAN Live Score: First the pull, now the cut ðŸ¤›ðŸ¼ðŸ«²ðŸ½ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ˜–

Rohit Sharma does not usually upper cut. That too just over the keeper’s head. Not for him arching his body and dabbling the ball over the keeper. He used to play the shot in the early part of his career but shelved it after it brought his downfall on a couple of occasions. It resurfaced again against Bangladesh’s Hasan Mahmud. He was undone by the lack of pace. He ended wafting the thin air, much before the ball had reached him. It turned out to be a set-up ball. The length of the next ball was similar but outside the off-stump. Rohit, in an irresistible mood to cut, cut this too. But the ball ended up in the hands of the backward point. If the pull had undone him him in Perth, it was its sibling cut that turned out to be his terminator.

IND vs BAN Live Score: Scanner chasing Rohit now? ðŸ”¬â³

Rohit Sharma had an opportunity to ride his luck and didn't. In the third over bowled by fast bowler Taskin Ahmed his attempted flick was dropped by Hasan Mahmud at deep backward square leg. But in the very next over he gave Mahmud a big break when he upper cut straight to backward point. Sharma has not been under the scanner for his lack of big runs, like Virat Kohli was and KL Rahul is. First Kohli's bad form was the focus, then Kohli's good form. Then Rahul's bad form. Sharma has flown under the radar. His 53 against Netherlands got him some breathing space but for how much longer?

IND vs BAN Live Score: Impersonator Marvel & his running comms with the hands ðŸ«²ðŸ½ðŸ‘ˆðŸ½ðŸ‘‰ðŸ½ðŸ¤ðŸ¾ðŸ«´ðŸ½ðŸ«±ðŸ½

After every ball he dealt off Taskin Ahmed in the first over,  KL would shadow-trace the path and movement of the ball with his hands. The first ball he faced straightened off the seam. Soon after the ball was past his feeble poke, he would back away and show the ball’s path with his gloved fingers. In case you missed it. With his hands, he showed that the ball just about held the line. The second ball was similar. His hands reproduced the path. The third ball seamed in. So with his fingers he gestured inward movement. The sixth seamed away a fraction, he made the appropriate movement with the hands. Like a toned-down version of Steve Smith, the impersonator marvel, he was giving a running commentary of the game with his hands.

IND vs BAN Live Score: So so slow start ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜”1

KL Rahul, the out of form opener, was circumspect in the first over against Bangladesh fast bowler Taskin Ahmed. The fresh wicket in Adelaide had decent bounce and carry and Rahul kept leaving the ball till late. Ahmed operated in the corridor and Rahul refrained getting tempted. From two slips, Bangladesh added a third hoping for an edge. All of one run was scored in the first over - a push to covers. Five dots in the first six is not the ideal way to start even taking into account the slightly helpful conditions for the bowlers and the lack of runs of the batsmen. Will it set the tone for the rest of the innings?

IND vs BAN Live Score: KL freed by the free hit ðŸ˜¤ðŸ•¸ï¸

It needed a free hit for KL Rahul to try an attacking stroke for the first time against Bangladesh. It was the ninth delivery he had faced, in the second over from Shoriful Islam, and the dot balls had already built up. He had poked at the first ball of the match from Taskin Ahmed, and was beaten outside off. He ended up letting the next three deliveries go past him to the wicketkeeper, and tapped the next few carefully to the off-side ring. Even the free hit, he failed to connect, missing a heave off his pads. However, there was to be some respite for Rahul in the same over, as he picked a delivery similar to the free-hit very cleanly all the way over deep square leg.

Rishabh Pant likely to replace injured Dinesh Karthik, KL Rahul expected to retain place for Bangladesh game

Wicket-keeper batsman and finisher-designate Dinesh Karthik would likely miss India’s Super 12 encounter against Bangladesh in Adelaide on Wednesday, as he has not yet recovered from a back spasm that he incurred during the game against South Africa. Though he has not been fully ruled out and came for practice here on Tuesday, Rishabh Pant is likely to replace him, The Indian Express has understood. That also means out-of-form opener KL Rahul will retain his place in the playing XI.

Karthik was injured during the back end of the South Africa game. At the start of the 16th over of the game, he was holding his back and grimacing in pain. Subsequently, Pant replaced him for the rest of the innings. Speaking on the eve of the Bangladesh game, coach Rahul Dravid said the medical team would closely monitor the 37-year-old’s injury. “He had a spasm after he jumped for the ball and landed in such a way that he felt pain thereafter. He is looking fine now and has come for practice with us. He will be undergoing a few sessions in the early morning and then we will assess his situation,” he said. (READ MORE)
