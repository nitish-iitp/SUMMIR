Team India will take on Bangladesh in the Super-12 match to be played at Adelaide Oval on November 2, 2022. Ahead of the game, head coach Rahul Dravid has backed underwire batter, KL Rahul, to bounce back strongly.

Rahul has struggled initially in the first three matches. The Karnataka opener struggled with the pace and bounce of Optus Stadium, Perth. Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul have not provided aggressive starts to the team in the first three matches.

While there is a lot of talking going around with Rahul’s place in the playing XI, Dravid has backed his opener to storm back to his run-scoring spree soon. Addressing reporters ahead of the next game, Dravid said:

“I think he is a fantastic player, he has a proven track record. I think he has been batting superbly. These things can happen in T20Is, it has not been that easy for top-order batters.

“This tournament has been challenging, I think he was brilliant in the practice games against Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. He got 60 or 70. I am hoping that it all clicks together in the next few games.”

The conditions in Australia are suited to play aggressive shots as KL Rahul has the ability to create impact team management would be hoping that the opener can do his job against Bangladesh tomorrow.

The Indian opener has scored just 22 runs in three matches he has played so far. India is currently in the second spot with four points. They would be looking to garner full points against the Bangla Tigers.

India will hope to bounce back against Bangladesh

Arshdeep Singh has been the standout performer for Team India in the bowling department with 7 wickets from 3 matches. Despite scoring 133 in the last game against South Africa, Indian bowling fought till the end before losing with just 2 balls to spare.

Virat Kohli has been the standout performer so far for India with 2 half-centuries. He played some lovely shots against South Africa before being caught at fine leg. The Indian team would be hoping to play their best cricket and inch closer to the semi-finals stage.

After this match, India will play their last Super 12 match against Zimbabwe on November  6 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).
