West Indies take on England in the T20 World Cup Super 8 on June 20

West Indies captain Rovman Powell believes that the side is all geared up to face a familiar England side in their highly anticipated Super 8 fixture on June 20 in the 2024 T20 World Cup. With both sides having met many times for competitive series across different formats, the clash will see two long-placed rivals face off against each other in a high-value knockout fixture in the T20 World Cup. While the hosts West Indies sealed qualification for the Super 8 with a perfect points tally and topping their Group C, England's road to the knockouts was not that pretty. It was only due to Australia defeating Scotland that let Jos Butler-led England go through as the second placed team from Group B.

Powell will have high confidence in his side before their crucial Super 8 fixture, after the West Indies thrashed Afghanistan in a one-sided affair at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, St Lucia on June 18, Tuesday. The Powell-led side flexed their all-round prowess to win by 104 runs against an in-form Rashid Khan-led Afghanistan. England decimated Oman in their Group B match of T20 World Cup 2024 after bowling their opponents out for just 47 and then chasing down the target with 101 balls and 8 wickets to spare. However, it was Australia's thrilling win over Scotland in St Lucia that allowed England to qualify for the Super 8 stages on June 16.

"I think the conditions are pretty good. It's good for batting, it's good for bowling which makes for very good cricket. When you look at the English team, they are defending champions, and, they are a very good team. So, it's for us now to just sit and find some plans and see how those plans can work against them," Powell said.

"We play the English guys so often, we play them actually every year, so they know a lot about us, we know a lot about them. It's just that when you're playing the game on the day, whoever gets on top has to stay on top for as long as possible," Powell added.

Both England and West Indies faced off against each other in a highly competitive T20I series in December 2023, which saw Powell's side clinch a decisive series win after the very last match.
