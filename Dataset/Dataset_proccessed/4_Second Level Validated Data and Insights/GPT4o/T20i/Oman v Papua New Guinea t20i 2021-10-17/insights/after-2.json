        "Papua New Guinea\u2019s cricket captain Assad Vala has faced the biggest test of his leadership in recent weeks.",
        "Nosaina Pokana, PNG's opening bowler, lost his dad to COVID-19. The very next morning CJ Amini lost his mum. Kiplin Doriga, the wicketkeeper, lost his mother after a training day-night match.",
        "Vala said he is proud of how his team has rallied behind his stricken teammates.",
        "Former Australia test bowler Greg Campbell is the CEO of Cricket PNG and says while rugby league is by far the country\u2019s biggest sport, cricket is growing in importance and popularity.",
        "The Barramundis - or 'Barras', as the team is nicknamed - will carry the hopes of a nation during one of its most challenging periods.",
        "Vala has urged the whole country to share in its most significant achievement.",
        "The journey to Oman has been far from easy, but the shared experiences have strengthened the team's bonds and put the tournament itself into perspective.",
        "Mr Campbell thinks the togetherness of the team may help PNG make a far bigger impact than some are predicting.",
        "After Oman, PNG will take on Scotland and Bangladesh in Group B. The top two nations from Group A and B will advance to the Super 12 stage of the tournament, joining the likes of Australia, India, England and the reigning champions the West Indies. Matches will be played in Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi and Oman."
