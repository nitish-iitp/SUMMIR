Two magnificent overs — the 16th and 18th of the innings by India’s premier seamer Jasprit Bumrah, and an otherworldly catch by Suryakumar Yadav to dismiss David Miller — were the difference as India won the T20 World Cup by seven runs. 

Bumrah conceded only six runs in those two vital overs at a time the Proteas needed 30 runs from 30 balls, after a blistering innings by Heinrich Klaasen. In the biggest moment, India captain Rohit Sharma turned to his biggest gun in Bumrah, and the bowler delivered. 

It was gutsy captaincy to give his star bowler the vital 18th over instead of holding him back for the 20th. But bravery won the day and when Yadav completed a mind-boggling catch on the deep long-off boundary with the first ball of Hardik Pandya’s over, the game was up. 

India claimed their second T20 World Cup, 17 years after winning their first, defeating South Africa by seven runs in the final in Barbados.

After winning the toss, India posted 176 runs for the loss of eight wickets — the highest-ever innings score in a T20 World Cup final — thanks to an inspired 76 run 59 ball innings by Virat Kohli. 

The Proteas looked on track to chase it down when Klaasen struck a magnificent 23-ball half-century with finisher Miller at the other end. 

South Africa needed 30 runs off 30 balls with Klaasen and Miller at the crease. But a terrific over by Bumrah, conceding only four runs, followed by another four-run over by Hardik, which included Klaasen’s wicket, saw the momentum shift back to India. 

Bumrah castled Marco Jansen in the next over and only conceded two runs, and all of a sudden South Africa needed 20 runs off the last two overs. 

Another economical over by Arshdeep Singh followed, conceding only four runs to Keshav Maharaj and Miller in the penultimate over. 

South Africa needed 16 off the last over, but hope remained with Miller on strike.

Final over

A full toss by Pandya followed in the first ball of the final over, which Miller hit long and hard straight down the ground and went soaring toward long off. 

It looked like it could possibly sail for six but Yadav took an outstanding catch. His momentum took him over the boundary rope as he threw the ball in the air, stepped back into the field, and caught it again.

The game was over at that moment as Pandya picked up Kagiso Rabada as well, and only conceded eight runs in the final over as India claimed their first T20 World Cup trophy since they won the inaugural tournament in 2007 in South Africa. 

“I tried to keep calm. We play the sport for this, I am really over the moon. My son is here, … family is here. We’ve been working really hard towards this, no better feeling than that,” Bumrah said on television after the match. 

“We play sport for the big stages. On the big day, you have to give more. Throughout the tournament I felt very clear and calm. At my peak mindset I think of one ball at a time. 

“The emotions can take over, but now the job is done. That over I thought length ball was the option; it was reverse-swinging and I was glad to execute.”

A Kohli masterclass 

Marco Jansen conceded 15 runs off the first over of the match after dishing up three half volleys and subsequently three boundaries off the blade of Kohli — a sign of things to come. 

Keshav Maharaj however, ensured that there would be no quick start for India after picking up both Indian skipper Rohit (nine off five) and Rishabh Pant (nought off two) in the space of three balls. 

Rabada picked up the wicket of the dangerous Yadav (three off four) in the fifth over with a brilliant short ball. 

With India on 34 for three, they sent in all-rounder Axar Patel (47 off 31) to rebuild alongside Kohli.

The pair steadied the ship and put on a 72-run partnership for the fourth wicket, before quick thinking by Quinton de Kock saw Patel dismissed by run out at the non-striker’s end. 

Shivam Dube (27 off 16) continued the momentum with Kohli, who dropped anchor, as the pair put on a 57-run stand.

India though, were tentative in their innings and were on 134 for the loss of four overs in the 17th over — the same over Kohli reached his half-century in 48 deliveries. 

But India and Kohli accelerated in the final three overs, picking up 42 runs. Kohli was particularly ruthless — hitting his final 11 balls for 26 runs — in his innings that included six fours and two sixes.

Wickets fell periodically during the carnage, with Jansen collecting one, and Anrich Nortje — the pick of South Africa’s bowlers — getting two. 

“This was my last T20 World Cup, and this is what we wanted to achieve,” Kohli said. “One day you feel you can’t get a run, then things happen. God is great, and I got the job done for the team on the day it mattered.”

Steady start 

South Africa looked in early trouble when Reeza Hendricks (four off five) was cleaned up by Bumrah in the second over, and skipper Markram (four off five) edged Arshdeep behind in the next over. 

Tristan Stubbs (31 off 21) and De Kock rebuilt (39 off 31) well to keep the fight going — taking South Africa to 70 in the ninth over. 

But Stubbs walked across his crease and was cleaned up by Patel. Klaasen wreaked havoc as soon as he stepped in, getting off the mark with a big six over the offside off Hardik Pandya.

He went on a rampage after that, striking two fours and five sixes. It included a 24-run assault on Patel in the 15th over to put South Africa in the driving seat.

South Africa’s innings capitulated after that over however, as India held their nerve, conceding only 22 runs in the final five overs.

Proteas gutted

“Obviously gutted for the time being,” Proteas captain Aiden Markram said at the post-match presentation.

“It will take some time to have some reflection on a really good campaign. It hurts quite a bit, but I’m really proud of the team. I thought we bowled well without much help from the pitch. 

“We’ve seen with a lot of our games that it isn’t over till the last ball is bowled. Especially at the back end things happen quite quickly, we got into a great position, which proves we are worthy finalists. 

“One thing that is guaranteed is that a South African is a competitive person, a respectful person and won’t go down without a fight.” DM

That was a wonderful campaign by the Proteas. It’s probably a bit churlish of me to suggest that the schedule was biased in favour of India, as they played most of their pool games in WI, while the Proteas were struggling on USA pitches, so I won’t suggest that ;-). India won well, but it could easily have gone the other way on the day. That catch to dismiss Miller made all the difference.

On the day I don’t think the pitches they had played on mattered much. What mattered was that the Proteas required 30 runs from 30 balls, had 6 wickets standing including those of Klaasen and Miller, and still went down. Even the Indian spectators thought it was game over. The Indian team didn’t win the championship – the Proteas let it slip through their fingers.

I think it was just a great world cup final and the match was on par with the Boks vs France in the rugby world cup. Re 30 runs from 30 balls – credit to India – especially Bumrah and that brilliant catch to end it all. The Proteas definitely came to the party but the best side won on the day.

The final truly lived up to expectations in all facets. The Proteas were in the driving seat for the better part of, if not for the whole game…but for the tenacity and never say die attitude of Team India, the Proteas should have been champions.
India won the championship, South Africa ‘choked’ again, and yes lost!
That’s the bottom line.

Had it in the bag at 24 from 24 balls but adrenaline and testosterone took over. You don’t have to hit every ball for a six or a four, six runs an over would have been enough with wickets on hand

Well done Proteas. I am a staunch supporter and I thought that the game is in the bag after Klaasen’s blitz. I remind myself that it was only a game and not a matter of life and death.
better luck next time to the Proteas. They are not chokers.
