Match Preview


The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 has reached its last stage and in the summit clash of the tournament, South Africa will battle it out against India. South Africa made it to their maiden finals on the back of a stunning win against Afghanistan in the semifinal 1. On the other hand, India booked their final berth by taking down defending champions England in the second semifinals. 


With them being just a step away from the first-ever World Cup title, Aiden Markram and Co. would give their all in the final game. On the other hand, Men in Blue won’t let go of another chance after losing the ODI World Cup 2024 by a whisker. Both sides have not lost any game in the tournament so far and would strive to become the first-ever undefeated T20 champions.


Needless to say, it is going to be a thrilling encounter filled with high-octane cricketing action. 


Toss Prediction





South Africa and India have clashed against each other in 26 T20I games so far and the upcoming match will be their 27th meeting in the shortest format. Out of their last five tosses, South Africa's skipper managed to win three tosses, whereas India’s skipper had two in his favour. Considering this, we think Proteas skipper Aiden Markram would win the toss over Rohit Sharma to extend the tally in his favour. 

Win Possibility





As mentioned, South Africa and India have clashed against each other in 26 T20I games. Out of those games, India registered 11 victories whereas the Proteas managed to clinch 11 wins and one match ended without a result. It means that the Men in Blue have an edge over their rivals. Speaking about their current performance, both sides have remained unbeaten throughout the season and are heading into the game high on confidence. In the clash of the titans, the cricketing world will witness both sides going at each other to get their hands on the coveted title and be crowned as the world champions. 

In the last match, India thrashed England by 68 runs in the second semi-final on Thursday, June 27. On the flip side, South Africa beat Afghanistan by nine wickets in a one-sided semifinal. The Rohit Sharma-led side headed into their third consecutive ICC final while South Africa ended their knockout jinx and secured their first-ever World Cup final berth. 


While both squads are in red-hot form, India are likely to end their decade-long ICC Trophy drought and win the second T20 crown. 


Predicted Powerplay Score and Average First Inning Score





One of the most popular cricketing venues, Kensington Oval in Barbados is set to host the summit clash between India and South Africa. The venue has hosted a total of 32 T20 matches and has a first-inning average of 153. Considering this, we think the first-inning score in the upcoming game is expected to be around 165-175 and powerplay can hover around 40-50.
