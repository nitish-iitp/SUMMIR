T20WC 2024 FINAL | SAvIND: Men in Blue set to correct history, dreams and heartbreaks
By Mumbai Indians | 28 JUN, 2024

The stage is set for the ICC T20 World Cup final - where a poetic conclusion will be written as a second T20WC crown for India or a maiden ICC silverware for South Africa at Barbados on Saturday, June 29.

India's sheer experience in the ICC championship finals and their momentum in breaking milestones have given them a significant psychological advantage. This could be the key to conquering past demons and fulfilling the long-standing wish of the Men in Blue to win the T20 World Cup.

South Africa, on the other hand, is a force to be reckoned with. The Proteas have also maintained an unbeaten streak in the competition, showcasing their ability to turn the tide in close encounters. Their unpredictable nature in meetings against India always introduces an element of surprise, promising a confident fight for survival and triumph in the upcoming championship match.

From a numbers perspective, India maintains the advantage—14 wins in 26 matches. But on the pitch, performance will do the talking, and we are excited to see what this game has in store.

What: South Africa vs India

When: Saturday, June 29, 2024, 8 pm IST

Where: Kensington Oval, Barbados

What to look forward to: A grand celebration of T20 cricket. Rahul Dravid’s farewell game as India coach. A majestic Rohit Sharma-Virat Kohli special. Bumrah and Arshdeep sweeping aside the Proteas threat. Billions of Indian fans across the globe glued to their TV and streaming platforms to witness India lift the T20 World Cup trophy for the second time.
