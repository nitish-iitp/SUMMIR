India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Highlights:

India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Highlights: Sri Lanka seemed set to surprise world champions India in their chase of 214 as Pathum Nissanka led their charge with a 48-ball 79. However, Sri Lanka collapsed in a heap after he was dismissed by Axar Patel in the 15th over. Sri Lanka went from being 140/1 at the start of the 15th over 163/7 by the 18th. Riyan Parag reeled off the last wickets off the first two balls of the last over and India won by 43 runs. ...Read More

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: THAT'S THAT! India beat Sri Lanka by 43 runs

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Parag reels off the last two wickets off the first two balls of the over itself and India's new era begins with a resounding win. Well, Sri Lanka have gone from 140/1 in 14 overs to being 170 all out. In between that, they lost five wickets in three overs and that pretty much ended any chances they had of pulling off a famous win over the world champions. And maybe this is the reason why India are world champions. They came back from the dead against South Africa in THAT match last month. This was a much more comfortable situation compared to that and they just stayed on the money as much as they could in the face of the big hits and the misfields creeping in.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Into the last over...

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Well its all fallen apart quite spectacularly for Sri Lanka. Riyan Parag to bowl the last over. Credit to India. There were a few misfields but they kept their eyes on the ball even when Nissanka was leading the Sri Lankan charge. And then, when the wickets came, they came in a heap.

IND vs SL Live Score: Sri Lanka 170/8 in 19 overs

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Two wickets in the 17th! The Sri Lankan chase falls in a heap

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Ah and it was all going so well for the hosts. Just two overs ago, they were better placed to win this game. Now they are down and out. India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Shanaka run out off the first ball of the 17th bowled by Riyan Parag. And then Parag cleans up Mendis fourth ball. That should be the game.

IND vs SL Live Score: Sri Lanka 163/6 in 17 overs

July 27, 2024 10:31 PM IST
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: GONE! Bishnoi gets one now

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Well it's all falling apart now for Sri Lanka. Bishnoi had dropped one again off his own bowling first ball of the 16th. He pushes the last ball flat and quick on off, Asalanka shapes up for a slog sweep and gets a top edge. Easy catch for Jaiswal.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: GONE! Two in the over for Axar!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Perera holes out to deep square last ball of the 15th after hitting Axar for two fours. This time, Bishnoi holds on to it. Sri Lanka lose both their set batters. Well, is this where the world champions get back in it?

July 27, 2024 10:20 PM IST
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: OUT! That's it for Nissanka!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Relief for Bishnoi as Axar makes sure his drop wasn't too expensive. First ball of the 15th keeps moving into the batter, cramps him up. He whips his bat and misses the ball which hits his leg stump. The end of an extraordinary innings that has possibly put Sri Lanka in sight of a famous win.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Bishnoi drops Nissanka!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: What in the world is happening here. Bishnoi has put down an absolute sitter to give Nissanka of all people a second chance. Pandya with a hip high short ball last ball of the 14th, Nissanka pulls, it was straight to Bishnoi but it bounces out of his hands. This is an extraordinary collapse in the field from the world champions.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: 14 runs in the 12th as misfields pile up for India

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Sri Lanka are going at 10 and their required rate is just over 11. This is turning into quite an interesting chase indeed.

July 27, 2024 9:59 PM IST
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Overthrows and fifty for Nissanka!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Nissanka crosses 50 in 34 balls. Well he should have only got to 51 there as the batters ran two, Rinku fires a throw and it hits the stumps, no one backing him up and it goes to the boundaries. It looked like that would be six runs for them but the umpires declare five as the batters hadn't crossed when Rinku released the throw. What an innings this has been from Nissanka.

July 27, 2024 9:43 PM IST
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: OUT! Breakthrough at last for India

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st T20I: Arshdeep Singh gets the breakthrough and Kusal Mendis's impressive innings ends. Kusal tries to force the pace on his pull as Arshdeep sends in a knuckleball fourth ball of the ninth, ends up hitting it straight into the hands of Jaiswal at deep midwicket.

Mendis c Jaiswal b Arshdeep Singh 45 (27)

IND vs SL Live Score: Sri Lanka 84/1 in 8.4 overs
