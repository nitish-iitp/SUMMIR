Charith Asalanka | Sri Lanka Captain

We were not up to the mark in the powerplay, but in the latter part, we came back pretty strong. Some stage, we thought they might get to 240, we did well. Little disappointed with the way the middle-order batted, we could have done better. (On balance of his side) It's an experiment, this is the way we should go in the future.

 27 Jul 2024, 11:04:26 pm IST
Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain (POTM)

They were playing a good brand of cricket from ball one. They were keeping the tempo, credit goes to them. We know how the wicket plays in the night. We were fortunate that there was no dew. The way we played in the World Cup, that remedied us that the game was still too far. (Left-right combination to be persisted?) Whatever works for the team, we'll take the call.

 27 Jul 2024, 11:06:30 pm IST
That's All From Our Side

India are leading the series 1-0 after first match and the second match will be played tomorrow at the same venue and same time. Join us tomorrow at the same place. Until then, it's goodbye and goodnight!
