Sri Lanka got their chase off to a terrific start as openers Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis added 84 runs for the first wicket off 52 balls. Arshdeep put the beaks on their innings by getting rid of Mendis for 45 (27) in the ninth over. Despite losing his partner, Nissanka continued to take on the bowling and raced to his half-century off 34 balls. The 26-year-old continued to play extravagant shots all around the ground leaving the Indian bowlers stunned.

SL vs IND 1st T20I Highlights

Sri Lanka were comfortably placed at 140/2 after 14 overs with Nissanka on 79. However, Axar Patel got the much-needed breakthrough by shattering Nissanka''s stumps in his last over. The left-arm spinner further got rid of a well-set Kusal Perera (20 off 14) on the last ball to bring India back into the game. Despite two quick blows, Kamindu Mendis continued to show positive intent smashing consecutive boundaries against Ravi Bishnoi.

Riyan Parag's game changing over

The wrist-spinner managed to get the prized scalp of Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka for a duck off the last ball. With 56 runs needed off 24 balls, captain Suryakumar Yadav surprisingly threw the ball towards Riyan Parag. However, the youngster didn't disappoint and gave away just five runs in the over along with a run out and the prized scalp Kamindu Mendis (12 off 8). From there on, there was no coming back for Sri Lanka as they kept on losing wickets and were bundled out for 170.

Earlier, Indian openers Shubman Gill (34 off 16) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (40 off 21) got their team off to a flying start adding 74 runs for the first wicket off 36 balls. Following a good start, Sri Lanka made a brilliant comeback by dismissing Gill and Jaiswal off consecutive balls, who fell prey to Dilshan Madushanka and Wanindu Hasaranga respectively.

After two quick strikes, captain Suryakumar Yadav continued the onslaught, registering his second fastest half century off just 22 balls. While Suryakumar continued to whack the bowlers all over the ground, Rishabh Pant was seen struggling at the other end.

The duo added 76 runs for the third wicket off just 43 balls as India crossed the 150-run mark in the 14th over. The Indian skipper finally departed for 58 (26) getting trapped in front of the stumps by Matheesha Pathirana. After losing his skipper, Pant finally got a move on by dispatching two full tosses from Asitha Fernando for a six and a four to move from 20 (23) to 32* (25).

Hardik Pandya (9 off 10) and Riyan Parag (7 off 6) got dismissed cheaply trying to up the ante in the death overs. However, Pant continued to find boundaries and registered his highest score in T20Is since August 6 2022. The southpaw missed out on his fourth T20I fifty by one run losing his stumps against Pathirana for 49 (33). Axar Patel finished the Indian innings in style, hitting Asitha Fernando over his head for a maximum.
