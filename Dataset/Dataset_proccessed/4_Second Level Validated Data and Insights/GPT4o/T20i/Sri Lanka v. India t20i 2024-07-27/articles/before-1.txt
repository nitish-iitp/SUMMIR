Spykar stitches partnership with India tour of Sri Lanka 2024

The Indian denim brand, Spykar has inked a pact with the forthcoming India tour of Sri Lanka, commencing on July 27, 2024.

The deal has enabled Spykar to be the associate gold sponsor for the highly anticipated bilateral series.

The series, which will be played from July 27 to August 7, 2024, kicks off with three T20Is followed by the same amount of ODIs. The six-fixture series between the 2011 ODI World Cup finalists is expected to witness viewership between 180-220 million.

We’re delighted to be the Associate Gold Sponsor for the upcoming India-Sri Lanka series,” said Sanjay Vakharia, Co-Founder and CEO of Spykar. “This partnership goes beyond just a sponsorship, it’s a celebration of our shared love for this incredible sport, a passion that ignites the young and restless spirit in India. We’re excited to connect with cricket fans on a personal level through this electrifying series.”

“It’s great to see a fashion brand like Spykar partnering with the upcoming India Tour of Sri Lanka. I am confident that this association will help the brand connect with its target audience. Sports and fashion always complement each other, making this an ideal collaboration,” said Mr. Upul Nawaratne Bandara, Head of Marketing, Sri Lanka Cricket.

Spykar, the clothing brand, prioritizes staying up-to-date with the dynamic global fashion industry. Spykar comes under Lord Bagri-promoted Metdist Group, a diversified portfolio of companies. The Indian entity focuses on delivering emerging hi-street denim trends related to the evolving Indian consuming community.

The Indian T20I team witnesses a new captain, Suryakumar Yadav, and youngsters who aim to cement their spots as Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have hanged their boots. The ODI series sees the return of the experienced contenders and commences the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 journey. The upcoming series also inaugurates the coaching stint of the former Indian cricketer, Gautam Gambhir.
