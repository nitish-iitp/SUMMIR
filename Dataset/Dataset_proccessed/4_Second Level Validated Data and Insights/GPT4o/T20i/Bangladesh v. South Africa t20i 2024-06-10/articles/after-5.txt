South Africa vs Bangladesh Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: South Africa pipped Bangladesh for a thrilling four-run win at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on Monday.

Led by Tanzim Hasan and Taskin Ahmed’s Powerplay burst, Bangladesh restricted South Africa to 113 for six. While their ploy to bat first had misfired, South Africa kept themselves in the hunt with some economical bowling and chipped in with quick wickets.

Even though Towhid Hridoy and Mahmudullah took the fight deep, South Africa held their nerve to dismiss both batters to secure their third successive win. It is also the lowest total successfully defended in the history of the tournament.

The win will put South Africa firmly in the driver’s seat for a Super Eight spot.

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Heinrich Klaasen, POTM

It was not so nice on the heart but glad to go over the line. The wicket is not great for strokeplay but David (Miller) showed in the previous game how to bat on this wicket. Got info from him. We got a decent score but were 10 runs short. We got experience and more or less a one-day mindset till the 15-over mark. Win will give big confidence to the boys. We're through which is nice. One more to go and then onto the next phase.

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Bangladesh assume control

Has SA's decision to bat first misfired in hindsight? Well, Bangladesh bowlers were on the mark in the Powerplay, led by Tanzim Hasan and Taskin Ahmed. They ripped off the vaunted top-order in a flash before David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen offered stern resistance. However, Bangladesh did not allow them to dominate at the death as Taskin and Rishad Hossain snapped up the crucial wickets. Bangladesh have never beaten South Africa but they have created their perfect chance to rewrite that today. But how will they come up against a menacing bowling unit?

Tanzim Hasan with the new ball.

Length delivery shaping inwards and de Kock taps it comfortably. In the slot and bang goes de Kock over square-leg for SIX! A superb flick from de Kock that sails comfortably over the fence. Short and de Kock swivels to swat the ball through mid-wicket for another FOUR. Tanzim shapes one in and de Kock clips it behind square for a single. Tanzim to Hendricks, OUT! Gone first ball! The ball skids through length and beats the bat, pretty plumb in front and Hendricks has to depart. The Bangladesh crowd erupts in joy.

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Toss

TOSS: South Africa win toss, opt to bat

Aiden Markram: We'll bat first. Reason being it is a used wicket. If it does change, we can set the pace and it is tough to chase. We back ourselves for setting a good total. As a whole, the tournament has leaned towards teams batting first. It is about the last 10 overs in each innings, and chasing might be tougher. 100% need to find some form, myself included. The head space is right, hopefully a matter of time.

Najmul Shanto: I wanted to bowl, so happy to bowl first. We have one change, Soumya Sarkar not playing. We feel good to see the crowds come out here and support us. It was an important win, the boys have done a lot of hard work and hopefully we can do something special today. We have been struggling with a leggie, finally got one who takes wickets. All the bowlers have been performing really well.

Aiden Markram and Najmul Shanto are out for the coin flip.

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Pitch Report

Playing on the same surface as yesterday and it hasn't fully settled down yet. It will be better for the bowlers, they need to bowl a bit back of length, a little bit shorter than Test match length and force the batters to hit square of the wicket. Bowling those hard lengths and having people hit square towards the longer boundaries will be difficult.

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: BAN Player to watch out for

Mustafizur Rahman is undoubtedly the vital cog for Bangladesh with the ball. His variations had put Sri Lanka in immense trouble in Dallas and the left-armer might be just as lethal in New York with vast square boundaries in effect.

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: SA Player to watch out for

Heinrich Klaasen has not been able to light up the tournament yet but this might just be the day where the hard-hitting batter gets back to his best. Bangladesh will invariably rely on at least a couple of spinners, including young leggie Rishad Hossain, the type of spin favoured by Klaasen.

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Bangladesh ends a 17-year wait

It was their first win against a higher-ranked T20I side in the T20 World Cup since the inaugural edition in 2007 where they beat West Indies. Bangladesh will not have it easy against South Africa either, having lost all three of their previous World Cup encounters.

South Africa blast out Sri Lanka to start campaign in style

South Africa's Anrich Nortje, right, celebrates with teammate Keshav Maharaj after the dismissal of Sri Lanka's Charith Asalanka during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in Westbury, New York, Monday, June 3, 2024. (AP/PTI)

If the IPL was about teams trying to break the 300-run barrier, cricket at the Big Apple threatens to make 150 seem like a dream. On a drop-in pitch in New York that had its birth in Adelaide and growth in Florida, and played like a combination of Centurion and Colombo tracks – the ball often kicked up with seam movement and occasionally died down, bouncing in front of the wicketkeeper or stopping on the batsmen – the South African seamers bared their fangs. And Sri Lanka were shot out for 77. (READ MORE)
