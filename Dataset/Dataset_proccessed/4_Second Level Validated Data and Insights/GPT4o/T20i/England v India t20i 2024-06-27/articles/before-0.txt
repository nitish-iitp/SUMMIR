India sailed through to the T20 World Cup 2024 semi-final setting up a blockbuster clash with England in a repeat of the T20 World Cup 2022 semi-final in Adelaide.

India beat Australia by 24 runs in a high-scoring affair at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia to remain unbeaten in the competition, while Australia are now on the verge of elimination and their fate depends on Afghanistan vs Bangladesh match later in the day. With Australia’s loss, the equation is simple: Afghanistan need a win to qualify for the final 4 and eliminate Australia. If Bangladesh beat Afghanistan by 61 runs or more or chase in 13 overs., they will make it to the final four. But Any margin lesser than that, Australia will go through.

India vs England in Semi-final 2 in Guyana

England, finishing 2nd in the T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 Group 2, after South Africa’s nervy win over West Indies today placing them at the top of the table in Group 2, will meet into the unbeaten Indian side at Providence Stadium, Guyana on June 27 (8:00 PM IST) for a place in the final.

A Repeat of India vs England T20 World Cup 2022 Semi-final

On November 10, 2022, England faced India at the Adelaide Oval in the 2nd semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2022, and England, the eventual winners, led by a demolition act from Jos Buttler and Alex Hales decimated India by 10 wickets, chasing down the target of 169, in just 16 overs and 10 wickets intact. That game forced India to change their T20 batting template and India will have a chance to redeem themselves at Guyana come June 27.

What does the T20 World Cup 2024 Semi-final line-up look like?

South Africa have topped Group 2 and they will play the first semi-final, meaning they will avoid India and play one from Australia, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, depending on who makes it to the semis. England, on the other hand, will meet India.

The first semifinal in Trinidad on June 26 is a night affair (6:00 AM IST) while the second semi-final in Guyana is a day game (8:30 PM IST), more suited for the Indian TV audience. India, irrespective of where they finish in their Super 8 group, will play the second semi-final.
