Goodbye for now

That’s it from our live coverage of the second T20 World Cup semifinal.

We now know the final two teams that will compete to be crowned 2024 T20 champions.

The defending champions, England, are heading home after being outplayed by the undefeated favourites, and the team of the tournament so far, India.

South Africa, with their 100 percent record, must now rise to the challenge in their first appearance in the final of a major ICC event.

A month of cricket is all about to come down to one match and we’ll bring you all the action and the build-up.

For now, though – from me, Kevin Hand – it’s goodbye.

More from Rohit Sharma on the spinners, Virat Kohli and the final

“When the conditions are like that in front of them [the India spinners], it’s very difficult to play shots – the pressure is still on them to execute their skills – but I thought they were very calm and knew exactly what to bowl,” Rohit said as he analysed the breakdown of the match.

“We had a little chat in the interval and said: ‘Try to hit the stumps as much as possible and keep them in play.’ That’s exactly what they did.

“Virat is a quality player. Any player can go through that [the lack of runs] but we do understand his class and his importance in all these big games.

“Form is never a problem when you have played cricket for 15 years. He is looking good, the intent is there and he is probably saving it for the final.

“We will be very calm as a team [in the final]. I do understand the occasion – it’s a big occasion, but for us, it is important that we keep calm. Staying calm and composed helps you to make good decisions. We have to keep making good decisions throughout the 40 overs and that will help us seeing the game through.

“In this game we were very steady and very calm – we didn’t panic too much and that has been the key for us. We need to understand when an occasion is important but you have to play good cricket, as well – that will allow you to be composed in your mind and that is what we want to do in the final as well.

“We will try out best. The teams is in good shape and all I can ask is that they put up another good show in the final.”

India captain Rohit Sharma reacts to victory against England

“It’s very satisfying to win this game. We worked really hard as a unit to come through this stage and to win this game like that was a great effort from everybody,” Rohit said at the post-match ceremony.

“We adapted to the conditions really well. The conditions were a little challenging. We had to adapt and that has been the success story for us so far.

“We have played the conditions really well and the bowlers and the batters, if they understand the conditions, and play according to them, then things fall into place. That’s exactly what happened. It’s very pleasing to see how we came through this game.

“At some stage, we were feeling 140-150 [would be a good score], but as the game went on we got some runs in the middle and we said another 20-25 runs more.

“I can set the target in my mind but I don’t want the batters to know it, they are all instinctive players and I want them to go out there and play freely – without thinking too much about what is the par score.

“If we bat well, we understand the conditions well then we will get to a good score and that’s exactly what happened. We got to 170, which I thought was a very good score on that pitch and the bowlers were outstanding.”

England captain Jos Buttler reacts to India’s victory

“India outplayed us. We let them get 20-25 runs too many on a challenging surface. They outplayed us and deserved the win,” Buttler said at the post-match ceremony.

“With the rain around, we didn’t think the conditions would change much and I don’t think they did. They outbowled us, they had an above-par score and I don’t think the toss was the difference between the teams.

“They have got some fantastic spinners. Our guys bowled well – in hindsight, I should have bowled Moeen in that innings with the way the spin was playing. They had an above-par score and, with a brilliant bowling attack, it was always going to be a tough chase.

“With everything that has happened throughout the whole tournament, I am really proud of everyone’s efforts. You can only play what is put in front of you and we’ve had lots of adversity throughout the competition but we’ve stuck together well as a group.

“We’ve played some really good cricket in patches but come up short when we needed it most.”

India spinner Axar Patel is Player of the Match

“I’ve bowled many over in the past in the power play,” he told the ICC broadcast. “I knew the wicket was stopping so I didn’t try too many things.

“Because the wicket is slow, if I bowl quicker it’s more easy for the batter so I tried to bowl a little slower and it worked for me.

“Our batters told us that the wicket is not easy to hit and some balls are getting low and skidding on. [About] 150-160 was a good total for us.”
