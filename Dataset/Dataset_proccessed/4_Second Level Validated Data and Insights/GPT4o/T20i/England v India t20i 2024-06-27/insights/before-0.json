        "India sailed through to the T20 World Cup 2024 semi-final setting up a blockbuster clash with England in a repeat of the T20 World Cup 2022 semi-final in Adelaide.",
        "India beat Australia by 24 runs in a high-scoring affair at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia to remain unbeaten in the competition.",
        "England, finishing 2nd in the T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 Group 2, after South Africa\u2019s nervy win over West Indies today placing them at the top of the table in Group 2, will meet the unbeaten Indian side at Providence Stadium, Guyana on June 27 (8:00 PM IST) for a place in the final.",
        "On November 10, 2022, England faced India at the Adelaide Oval in the 2nd semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2022, and England, the eventual winners, led by a demolition act from Jos Buttler and Alex Hales decimated India by 10 wickets, chasing down the target of 169, in just 16 overs and 10 wickets intact. That game forced India to change their T20 batting template and India will have a chance to redeem themselves at Guyana come June 27.",
        "South Africa have topped Group 2 and they will play the first semi-final, meaning they will avoid India and play one from Australia, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, depending on who makes it to the semis. England, on the other hand, will meet India.",
        "The first semifinal in Trinidad on June 26 is a night affair (6:00 AM IST) while the second semi-final in Guyana is a day game (8:30 PM IST), more suited for the Indian TV audience. India, irrespective of where they finish in their Super 8 group, will play the second semi-final.",
        "India were pre-determined to play in the second semi-final scheduled for Guyana on the 27 June 2024, as per ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024 playing conditions."
