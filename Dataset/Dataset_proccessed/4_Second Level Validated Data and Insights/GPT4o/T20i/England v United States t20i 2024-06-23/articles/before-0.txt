USA vs ENG Prediction: The defending champions face a must-win clash to keep their semis ambitions alive. USA, who have been a revelation in the tournament however are still winless in the Super 8s. Expect England to seal the contest comfortably. 

USA vs ENG Prediction: Match Details

Tournament: T20 World Cup 2024

Match: USA vs England

Date: June 23, 2024

Time: 8:00 PM IST

Venue: Kensington Oval, Barbados

USA vs ENG Match Preview

England will lock horns against USA in their final match of the Super 8s stage in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024. England has two points from two games – with one defeat and one victory. The Three Lions started strong with a win against co-hosts West Indies but then lost against the Proteas. The defending champions will thus need to churn out a win to keep their semi-finals qualification hopes alive. 

USA, on the other hand, has already been a revelation after they managed to upset a cricketing powerhouse like Pakistan and advanced to the Super 8s. They have however lost both encounters so far and their qualification chances look bleak. Either way, the USA team will hope to end their campaign on a high with a win.
