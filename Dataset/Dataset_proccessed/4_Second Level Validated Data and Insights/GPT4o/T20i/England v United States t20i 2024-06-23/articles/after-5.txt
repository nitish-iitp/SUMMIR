Who can England play in the semis?
published at 18:57 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:57 BST 23 June 2024

In short, we don't know yet.

England do not know when, where or indeed who they will play their semi-final.

What we do know is it will be played on a Wednesday (Thursday 01:30 BST) in Trinidad or Thursday (15:30 BST) in Guyana.

They could yet top Group 2 in the Super 8s if West Indies beat South Africa later on Sunday (Monday 01:30 BST).

After that the picture will become clearer when Australia meet India on Monday in what is likely to be a must-win fixture for England's Ashes rivals.

England could meet either of those two, Afghanistan or less likely Bangladesh, in the last four as they hunt a third world T20 title in a campaign that almost met a premature end two weeks ago.

Sure that is all, ahem, clear as day.

More from England bowler Chris Jordan speaking to BBC Test Match Special: "I'd like us to produce our best when we're not up against it, but it is part and parcel of life. If it takes us being in those situations to bring out those kind of performances then so be it.

"Tournament cricket is one of ups and downs and sometimes it just creates the clarity on the direction you need to go in. I think in the last few games the boys have really been locked in. We're coming down to crunch time so long may that continue."

A quick recap of what's happened today then.

The main takeaway is England are through to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup regardless of what happens in the match between South Africa and West Indies in the early hours (01:30 BST) of Monday morning.

The most memorable moments of the game were Chris Jordan's hat-trick and Jos Buttler smoking fives sixes in a over en route to 83* off 38 balls.

'A moment to cherish'
published at 18:47 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:47 BST 23 June 2024

More from England bowler Chris Jordan speaking to BBC Test Match Special: "Our spinners hare highly skilled. They showed their class again today. Adil Rashid is really putting us in positions where we can control the game. It just sets up everything nicely for Jos that he can juggle things from there."

On being back in Barbados: "It's brilliant. Seeing Aaron Jones today, who Jofra [Archer] and I went to school with. Sometimes we'd go out on our lunch break and play cricket in the corridor and you never thought you'd be on the world stage playing cricket together and against each other. It is really special. In front of family and friends it is special and one that you'll savour for a while."

On the hat-trick: "It definitely feels really good and I'll cherish the moment, but we've got business to handle."

What an embarrassing and amateurish end to the competition for USA. If India beat Australia and Afghanistan beat Bangladesh, England could get to the final with 1 win against a team ranked inside the top 10 in the world!!

A few weeks ago it was Mott and Buttler out, now we're in the last four. Let's hope the same happens in the football.

'Still have to do my job'
published at 18:43 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:43 BST 23 June 2024

Finally from Jos Buttler on whether Chris Jordan's performance means England have stumbled on their best team: "We have great options, today I wanted to bring CJ back in to add a little bit of depth to the batting and we know what he is capable of with the ball. He executed it fantastically well, and a World Cup hat-trick is a great effort."

On his own form: "Personally it's really important I continue this into the semi-finals. I have been feeling good all year, I feel I am hitting the ball well and it is nice to get that confidence. It’s important to look after my own game, as much as trying to be captain and take a broad view, I am still on one of 11 and have to do my job."

'England hitting their straps'
published at 18:39 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:39 BST 23 June 2024

Steven Finn
Former England fast bowler on BBC Sounds

That was a real flexing of the muscles against an associate nation, they started off their innings watchful but then Jos Buttler exploded. It was a show of power from England and they will be building confidence.

There’s been an element of calm since that day when we watched it rain in Antigua and we wondered whether England would even make it out of the group.

They are just starting to hit their straps, it’s not always coming from the same people. It is great to see Jos Buttler scoring 83 from 38 with those seven sixes, he will take a lot of confidence from that.

They are starting to peak at the right time, it is about getting it right towards the back end and if England can play anything like they did today in the remaining games of the tournament, they will be close to winning it.

'A great feeling'
published at 18:36 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:36 BST 23 June 2024

England bowler Chris Jordan speaking to BBC Test Match Special: "It is definitely a great feeling.

"At this moment in time I want to focus on what the team did though. It was a real solid team performance on the back of a loss against South Africa.

"We came out and set the tone nice and early in the powerplay and the way Livi [Liam Livingstone] and Rash [Adil Rashid] bowled in the middle set it up nicely for the back end. We were really clinical with bat as well.

"It was a really, really good team performance and one that we'll enjoy and work out what we did to hopefully take into the semi-final."

'Created a lot of pressure'

18:34 BST 23 June 2024

More from England captain Jos Butler on Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone: "They were excellent. Adil has been fantastic all the way and I thought Livvy bowled well as well. In tandem they created a lot of pressure, earned their wickets.

"I don’t make it easy for him. Livvy sometimes only bowls one over but today he bowled four and credit to him for being ready and producing really good skill."

Net run rate 'absolutely' in thoughts
published at 18:32 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:32 BST 23 June 2024

England captain Jos Buttler: "We paid USA a lot of respect, but we talked a lot about our intensity and if we thought if we took it on the field we’d be too good.

"Was net run rate in our thoughts? Yes, absolutely. You have to got to earn the right to begin with, we started well and once we got through a few overs we decided to target this side with the wind."

Feast your eyes on this.

You can watch Jos Buttler's five sixes off Harmeet Singh's over in all their glory by clicking the video below.

It was Phil Salt on strike for ball one of that over, by the way, otherwise we might have been talking about something even more special.

'Opened the eyes of the American public'
published at 18:24 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:24 BST 23 June 2024

More from USA skipper Aaron Jones on the wider impact of their performance at the World Cup: "I think it was good for us. It was our first us, our first World Cup. I don't think people thought we would be here right now playing against England, West Indies and all the big boys. But we did it.

"Obviously we would love to win the World Cup, but that's how it goes sometimes though. I think our performances in this World Cup have really opened the eyes of the American public, and that's something we have been talking about [doing} in the last few years.

"We have been getting a lot of calls, a lot of messages and we have a lot more support now because of this World Cup. We are grateful for sure."

'Shot selection not the best'
published at 18:19 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:19 BST 23 June 2024

USA skipper Aaron Jones: "It is a hard game to take in. We weren't as disciplined as we should be to be honest. It was similar to the last game and something we will have to talk about.

"The wicket was a bit sticky and Adil Rashid is for sure a very good bowler. I didn't think our shot selection was the best. We knew he was the dangerman on this wicket for sure, and we still gave him some wickets as well.

"Have we run out of steam? I guess you could say that. We didn't have a good last two games and we can talk about that for sure. That's how it goes sometimes. We really enjoyed the World Cup."

'We are exceptionally pleased'
published at 18:15 British Summer Time 23 June 2024
18:15 BST 23 June 2024

Player of the match Adil Rashid, who took 2-13: "I thought we played exceptionally well, we set the tone with the ball all thorough and to restrict them to 115 we were exceptionally pleased.

"It is always nice to bowl here, sometimes everything goes in your favour. It helps when they keep it tight from the other end, all in all it was a great bowling effort. With the wind you have to assess which end you want to bowl, but playing early you get a bit of dew that makes the ball skip on a bit more.

"The googly has been coming out nice, hopefully I can carry that on."

On Chris Jordan's hat-trick and Jos Buttler's five sixes in an over: "CJ is a match-winner, he’s been doing that at the back end for years and to get a hat trick after not playing much, big congrats to him. Jos is a world-class performer, hopefully he can carry that on into the semis."
