Goodbye for now!

That’s it for today’s game in Barbados as England secure their spot in the World Cup semifinals.

Jos Buttler’s side can sit back and relax now whilst others battle it out for a place in the final four.

A winner-takes-all encounter

With England booking their place in the semifinals, there is now only one qualification spot left from Group 2.

It means that South Africa vs West Indies is effectively a quarterfinal, with the winner guaranteed a spot in the last four.

It’s a mouth-watering encounter in Antigua with the action getting under way at 8:30pm local time on Sunday (that’s 00:30 GMT on Monday).

‘A hard game to take in’

USA captain Aaron Jones looked bitterly disappointed as he spoke with Michael Atherton after the match.

This game brings down the curtain on USA’s memorable World Cup debut.

“It’s a hard game to take in, to be honest,” Jones said in the post-match ceremony.

“We weren’t as disciplined as we should be. That’s something that we definitely need to talk about.”

He also reflected on the whole World Cup campaign.

“I think it was very good for us,” he said. “This is our first World Cup and a lot of people didn’t think we would be here playing the big boys. But we did it.

“Our performances in this World Cup will open the eyes of the American public and that’s something we have been talking about over the last couple of years.”

‘We have got great options’

Winning skipper Jos Buttler has been speaking after the match. He started by revealing that England were chasing a rapid chase to boost the net run rate and potentially top the group.

He also had plenty of praise for his two spin bowlers: “Adil [Rashid] has been fantastic all the way through and [Liam] Livingstone bowled brilliantly, too.

“We have got great options. Today we wanted to bring CJ [Chris Jordan] back in to add a bit of depth to the batting line-up, and we know what he is capable of with the ball, too.”

Buttler also touched on his own batting performance, which saw him finish on 83* off 38 balls.

“I’ve been feeling good all year, to be honest. You don’t always get the results, but I feel that I am hitting the ball well,” he said at the post-match ceremony.

Rashid named player of the match

The England spinner scoops up the award ahead of Jordan and Buttler.

“We played exceptionally well. We set the tone and to restrict them to 115, we were very pleased,” Adil Rashid told Michael Atherton in the post-match interview for the ICC broadcast.

He also had plenty of praise for hat-trick hero Chris Jordan.

“CJ is a match-winner. He’s been doing it for a number of years. He’s been vital and he’s showed us that again today.”

A perfect performance from England

After bowling USA out for 115 runs, including a hat-trick from Chris Jordan, England’s openers came out and chased down the winning total with ease.

They’ve not only secured qualification for the semifinals, but they may even now top the group thanks to a huge boost in their net run rate.
