Sydney: South Africa 205-5, Bangladesh 101 - South Africa won by 104 runs

Scorecard

Rilee Rossouw struck a brutal hundred as South Africa recorded their first win of the men's T20 World Cup against Bangladesh by 104 runs.

Rossouw hammered 109 off 56 balls, whacking seven fours and eight sixes to become the first Proteas man to reach the landmark in the showcase event

Quinton de Kock contributed 63 as the pair put on a tournament record 163 for the second wicket in 13.3 overs

Some impressive death bowling from The Tigers saw them restrict South Africa to 205 for 5 from their 20 overs.

Faced needing their highest T20 World Cup total, Bangladesh wilted in the powerplay as Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada ran riot.

Shakib al Hasan's dismissal to a ball pitching outside leg stump which he failed to review summed up their fortunes.

Having fallen well behind the required run rate, Bangladesh took major risks trying to catch up and were eventually bowled out for 101, with Nortje (4 for 10) and Tabraiz Shamsi (3 for 20) doing the damage and consigned them to their biggest T20I defeat by runs.

Rain before play and early into the South Africa innings raised fears of a second washout in as many games for De Kock's side.

Inclement conditions meant they were unable to complete victory over Zimbabwe in their opening game, but there was to be no such repeat on this occasion.

Though Temba Bevuma's problems continued with a seventh single-figure T20I score in a row, Rossouw and De Kock produced a memorable onslaught.

They peppered the boundary, picking up length and smashing it square of the wicket and down the ground.

Taskin Ahmed was subdued, finishing with 1 for 46 from three overs, while Shakib also took some punishment (2 for 33).

Mustafizur Rahman was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with 0 for 25 as he went for just two boundaries.

With South Africa 170-1, Afif Hossain ended De Kock's fun in the 15th over Rossouw was not to be denied a second T20I century, secured via a prod to point for a single.

Bangladesh made a fine comeback in the death overs, conceding just 30 runs (one four, one six) and taking three wickets.

Tristan Stubbs (7) and Aiden Markram (10) both struggled as a soft ball and some tight Bangladesh bowling restricted them to 205 for 5. Rossouw's departure was confirmed as he picked out Litton Das off Shakib.

Bangladesh needed their third-highest T20I score to claim a memorable victory and despite making a quick start, were soon pegged back by South Africa's pace battery.

Nortje struck three times in the powerplay, having Souyma Sarkar (15) caught behind and bowling Najmul Hossain Shanto (9) in his first over before trapping Shakib (1) lbw.

Replays showed Shakib should have gone upstairs after the ball was adjudged to have pitched outside leg stump. Any faint hope of victory dissipated upon his exit.

A late cameo with the ball from Shamsi, the No.1 T20I bowler in the ICC rankings, secured South Africa's second-largest T20I win in terms of runs, setting them up perfectly for vital clashes against India and Pakistan in the coming days.
