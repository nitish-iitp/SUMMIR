Rilee Rossouw is the Player of the Match.

...Presentation coming up...

!

It was top-class bowling from the Proteas. It was filled with fiery bowling from Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada while Tabraiz Shamsi showed his magic yet again and claimed 3 wickets. However, it was Anrich Nortje's first over that shifted the momentum. He took two in his first and overall with four wickets, his best T20I figures. A one-sided affair in the end. However, it was set up by Rilee Rossouw and Quinton de Kock with the bat. The former scored a wonderful ton and helped his team get over 200 and it turned out to be more than enough.

!

Bangladesh were behind the 8-ball from the start of the chase. They had a good start but once Anrich Nortje was introduced, they lost both the openers in quick succession. Shakib Al Hasan got out to an LBW decision that could have been refereed upstairs and could have survived. He fell and after that, there wasn't much from the other batters. Litton Das stayed for a long time but the chase was just too big for Bangladesh.

!

A comprehensive win for the Proteas. They dominated in all three departments and with such a huge margin win, they boost their net rate rate. For now, they go on top of group 2.
