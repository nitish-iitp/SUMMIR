SA vs BAN: Rilee Rossouw scripts history, becomes first South African batter to smash a T20 World Cup century
Rilee Rossouw smashed a terrific century against Bangladesh to help South Africa get to a score of 205 runs in the T20 World Cup Group 2 game. Rossouw, who returned to the South African setup in July after a gap of six years, has been in sensational form since his comeback and became the first South African batter to slam a ton in T20 world Cup.

South Arica after a washout in their last game must have been disappointed with the result and to compensate the same, came out all guns blazing in their second Group 2 match against Bangladesh after choosing to bat first in T20 World Cup. Despite losing skipper Temba Bavuma early, South Africa made a statement as the two left-hander Quinton de Kock and Rilee Rossouw came out with positive intent and smashed all the Bangladesh bowlers around.
De Kock and Rossouw both continued from where they left off in the India series. While De Kock would have been disappointed that his 18-ball 47* didn't result in a South Africa win in Zimbabwe, he made sure that the Proteas get off to a flying start, and Rossouw just punished the spinners.
Whether it was spin of Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan or pace attack of Taskin Ahmed and Hasan Mahmud, the southpaw duo didn't leave any of the Bangladesh bowlers. While de Kock brought up his half-century, Rossouw, who didn't bat against Zimbabwe, smashed consecutive century in T20Is, becoming only the second batters in the history to do so.
Rossouw also became the first South African batter to score a ton in T20 World Cup and overall the 10th player in the world. The 33-year-old now has equalled David Miller's record becoming second South African batter to have two centuries in his name in T20 internationals.
Centuries in T20 World Cup history:
Chris Gayle - 117 off 57 (West Indies vs South Africa), 2007
Suresh Raina - 101 off 60 (India vs South Africa), 2010
Mahela Jayawardene - 100 off 64 (Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe), 2010
Brendon McCullum - 123 off 58 (New Zealand vs Bangladesh), 2012
Alex Hales - 116* off 64 (England vs Sri Lanka), 2014
Ahmed Shehzad - 111* off 62 (Pakistan vs Bangladesh), 2014
Tamim Iqbal - 103* off 63 (Bangladesh vs Oman), 2016
Chris Gayle - 100 off 48 (West Indies vs England), 2016
Jos Buttler - 101* off 67 (England vs Sri Lanka), 2021
Rilee Rossouw - 109 off 56 (South Africa vs Bangladesh), 2022
Most centuries in T20Is for South Africa
2 - David Miller
2* - Rilee Rossouw
1 - Faf du Plessis
1 - Richard Levi
1 - Morne van Wyk
Batters to score consecutive T20I centuries
Gustav McKeon (France) - 109 (61) vs Switzerland, 101 (53) vs Norway in T20 World Cup 2024 Europe Qualifiers
Rilee Rossouw (South Africa) - 100* (48) vs India, 109 (56) vs Bangladesh
Rossouw and de Kock stitched a 168-run stand off just 85 balls to help South Africa get to a score of 205 runs and now they will hope that the bowlers can restrict the Bangladesh batters to a low score and lead the side to a big win.
