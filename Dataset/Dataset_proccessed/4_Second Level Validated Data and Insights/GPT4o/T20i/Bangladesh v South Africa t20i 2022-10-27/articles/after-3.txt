South Africa displayed top-class bowling, especially the pace bowling from Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada while Tabraiz Shamsi showed his magic yet again and claimed three wickets but it was Anrich Nortje’s first over that shifted the momentum. He ended with a four-wicket haul, his best T20I figures. A one-sided affair in the end.

However, earlier in the day, the Proteas had won the toss and decided to bat. Setting up the innings, it was top class performance by Rilee Rossouw and Quinton de Kock with the bat. The former scored a wonderful ton and helped his team get over 200 and it turned out to be more than enough.

Bangladesh had a good start as they smashes sixes in the first over itself but once Anrich Nortje was introduced, they lost both the openers in quick succession. Shakib Al Hasan got out to an LBW decision that could have been referred upstairs and could have survived.

However, he fell and after that, there wasn’t much from the other batters. Litton Das stayed for a long time but the chase was just too big for Bangladesh.

A comprehensive win for the Proteas. They dominated in all three departments and with such a huge margin win, they boost their net rate rate. For now, they go on top of group 2.

T20 World Cup 2022, SA vs BAN Live: South Africa Win by 104 Runs

It’s all over for Bangladesh as they fall out on 101 in 16.2 overs. Anrich Nortje once again comes with a back of length delivery and once again, the ball shapes back into the left-hander and Taskin doesn’t have any clue about it as he slams but ball hits the stumps.

With that, disturbed bails, South Africa clinch a massive victory by 104 runs. Also, what an amazing spell from Nortje. Ends the day with four-wicket haul, giving away just 10 runs in 3.3 overs

Bangladesh fans feed on some entertainment from Mustafizur Rahman as he  shows his capability with the bat. Floats on middle, slogs Shamsi’s delivery to high over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. Well, this six also pushes Bangladesh score to 100 which seemed difficult after quick fall of wickets

T20 World Cup 2022, SA vs BAN Live: Run Out! BAN 90-9

Taskin gets a hard length ball on off, pushes to cover and look for a run but Kagiso Rabada is placed close in, and there’s a DIRECT HIT at the keeper’s end. Rabada now adds more to Bangladesh wounds as he sends back Hasan Mahmud on a duck after a good direct-hit. Mahmud is visibly short of the crease, almost with no hopes alive for reaching the crease in time.

Big question, folks- Will Bangladesh manage to even reach the 100 mark?

With fall of wickets on the other end, Litton Das is looking to at least lead Bangladesh to three-digit mark, but wait… it’s all over for Bangladesh. Das also walks back at 34. All hopes die out for Bangladesh. But, what an effort from Tabraiz Shamsi. Two attempts at throwing himself across to his right by leaping, but after no success this time he gives a chance to Stubbs to catch. Litton goes for a slog sweep to full ball on middle and off but no timing as Tristan Stubbs catch it at deep square log.

It’s a collapse of Bangladesh innings as batters go back to pavilion in quick succession.

Now, there a is third player in the match – The Lions, The Proteas and the Weather. First rain and now sun, both are playing a huge role. If not sun, then Stubbs might have got his hand down the ball. But even now, it’s a long long way for Bangladesh.

Shakib Al Hasan is regretful for not taking a review for his wicket as it was pitching outside leg but here’s an add on to the disappointment. Kagiso Rabada uses pace, provide extra bounce and there Afif Hossain rushes to pull it but only manages a mishit to Wayne Parnell at mid-off.

It’s close! Umpire raises the finger and three for Nortje as he bowls a full on middle and Shakib looks to clip it onside, but it strikes the pads. Shakib discusses about reviewing it, but accepts the decision and goes back.

What a terrific spell from Nortje, the Proteas are definitely up with big smiles but frowning faces in the Bangladesh team. Chasing 205 and three quick wickets, will the Lions make it to the target?

Najmul Hossain Shanto smashes a four over mid on on the very second delivery of the first over. And then Soumya Sarkar also punches in with two maximums in the last two deliveries. First one over deep square leg and the other one is just the carbon copy of the first. It’s 17 of the very first over.

Woah! What a start. Shanto and Sarkar definitely look for a fifth gear start as the ride is too long to reach 205.

T20 World Cup 2022, SA vs BAN Live: Bangladesh All Set for The Chase

It’s quite disappointing effort from Bangladesh in bowling department as they were poor with the ball and in the field, with a few dropped catches and mis-fields. Taskin, who was so good in the last game, was taken to the cleaners here. Except for the Fizz, most of the bowlers had economies on the higher side. They just did not make most of a wicket where the slower ones were holding and were bowling more into the slot and seam-up which were easy to hit. It is not what Shakib Al Hasan would have wanted after being asked to field.

But, the biggest catch here is, will they get a fine start? Will they be able to chase down the 205 in 20 overs. Well, only time will tell and for that stay tuned with us for all live updates.

The duo stitched an impressive partnership to ride South Africa across the 200 mark. The start was quite dicey with Bavuma’s wicket but then Rossouw’s power compensated all the damage.

Now, will Bangladesh manage to chase the target? Stay tuned with us.
