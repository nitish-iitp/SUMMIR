COMMENTRY
So, the series started with an unexpected win for the home team but the favourites, Pakistan unsurprisingly won the final two games to win the series comfortably. That is all from this game and the series. Hope you enjoyed the coverage. It's goodbye and cheers from our side.
Babar Azam says the Irish batters were batting brilliantly in the first half but his bowlers put pressure by taking few wickets. Adds they tried to entertain the crowd who were here to show some support. Tells he and Mohammad Rizwan have played a lot of cricket and were playing to their strength. They targeted a couple of bowlers and talked about run-rate. Mentions they are looking forward to the future games and execute the plans there.
Lorcan Tucker says it was a privilege to lead the team. Shares the platform was set for a big score but unfortunately it didn't come off. Tells the bowlers bowled in tough conditions and is happy with how they bowled. Mentions the results didn't go their way but happy with the intent the team showed.
Shaheen Afridi wins the Player of the Match award. He says the bowlers tried to hit good lines and lengths. Adds in the last two games they bowled on a fuller-length and they have an experienced bowling attack who guides each other. Tells it is important to get the team ready before the World Cup. Shares Azam and Rizwan are world class player and happy that they did the job.
...Presentation...
As told earlier, Ireland were well below the par score. Earlier they completely lost the momentum once Lorcan Tucker fell. However, they were in a good position before that scoring 10 an over or so but couldn't finish the innings they would have hoped for. The Irish bowlers tried their best but they never looked like could turn the tides in their favour. An easy and comfortable couple of games for Pakistan to seal the series.
It was not a big surprise to see Pakistan cruise through so comfortably. Ireland were well under-par on this kind of pitch and Pakistan made a mockery of the chase. They lost Saim Ayub early on but the two pillars of Pakistan cricket, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan stitched a stand of 139 runs to seal the game. The latter was the aggressor early on but Babar Azam too joined him. Both hit few lusty blows and scored fifties respectively. They both fell but till then the job was well and truly done.
