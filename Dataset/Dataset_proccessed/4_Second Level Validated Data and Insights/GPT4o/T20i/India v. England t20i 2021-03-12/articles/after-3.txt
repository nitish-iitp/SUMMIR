India vs England 1st T20I Highlights.

India vs England 1st T20I Highlights: England drew first blood in the five-match T20I series against India by winning the first T20I by eight wickets at the newly-named Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Friday.

Invited to bat, India posted 124/7, rescued by Shreyas Iyer’s 48-ball 67-run knock. Jason Roy then smashed 49 off 32 balls as England overhauled the target with 27 balls to spare.

A series win for either team will be a boost for their confidence ahead of this year’s ICC T20 World Cup 2021 in India. England are the current occupants of the ICC’s No.1 ranking in T20I cricket with India sitting just below. A 4-1 series win or better for India will see them rise to the top spot on the ladder, with England slipping down.

12 MAR 2021
England need just 18 runs more

Bairstow comes in and settles in quickly with some good defence against Washington. He finds his rhythm in the next over as he absolutely skins Chahal with two huge maximums in the same over. England need 18 runs from 42 balls. ENG: 107/2 (13 overs)

21:52 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
WICKET!

And the other opener departs! Washington Sundar comes into the attack and India instantly reap rewards! The spinner strikes with his first ball. The off-break turns in, Roy (49) plays all round it, misses and is struck close to off-stump. ENG: 89/2 (11.1 overs)

Jason Roy falls ONE short of his fifty!

England are 89/2, and they need 36 runs from 53 balls.#INDvENG | https://t.co/c6nwSdBr8j pic.twitter.com/hJ6ptl8jUm

12 MAR 2021
WICKET!

India finally have their wicket but it's a little bit late for the hosts! After Roy (44*) hammered Chahal for a six and a four, the spinner bit back by scalping the wicket of Buttler (28). A perfectly bowled leg-break resulting in a LBW. ENG: 72/1 (8 overs)

21:25 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
England cross 50-run mark in powerplay

After Axar's costly over where he conceded 13 runs to the rampaging Buttler, Bhuvneshwar comes back into the attack. He calms things down initially, but he gives away eight runs. Fifty-run partnership up for both Roy (24*) and Buttler (26*). ENG: 50/0 (6 overs)

21:13 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
England on their way to target

Roy provides some good adrenaline rush to his side by thumping Chahal for a big six and a beautiful boundary to backward point. Afterwards, he takes on Shardul and hits the pacer for his third four of the innings. A consistent approach. ENG: 29/0 (4 overs)

Can India pull of a miracle tonight?

Roy, Buttler start visitors' chase

Jason Roy and Jos Buttler are out in the middle as Axar Patel will restart the proceedings with the ball. If India manage to defend their total of 124, then it'll be their second-lowest successfully defended T20I total. Meanwhile, Axar does well. ENG: 1/0 (1 over)

20:49 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
England need 125 runs to win!

Axar Patel walks out, swings his bat, and scores 7 runs in three balls but that is not enough to lift the hosts from a below-par total of 124/7, despite a half-century by Shreyas Iyer. A brilliant bowling performance from England ensured India never settled at the crease, with Jofra Archer registering impressive figures of 3/23. England need 125 runs to win the first T20I against India.

A brilliant bowling performance from England as they restrict India to 124/7.

Shreyas Iyer top-scored for the hosts with an impressive 48-ball 67.#INDvENG | https://t.co/c6nwSdBr8j pic.twitter.com/26hL2gcV9M

12 MAR 2021
OUT

Shreyas Iyer departs with three balls left of the innings. He is caught on the boundary spectacularly by Malan, departs after scoring his highest T20I score of 67. 

20:38 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
FOUR

Shreyas Iyer pulls one to the mid-wicket boundary. Iyer has been the start for India's innings tonight. Nine runs off the over as IND: 114/6 (19 overs)

20:34 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
Double strike

Big blow for India as Jofra Archer removes Hardik Pandya for 19 after he finds Jordan at mid-off. Shardul Thakur walks in but it's a first ball duck for him as he gets a bouncer from Archer and hooks it straight to Deep Square Leg. Washington Sundar walks in . IND: 105/6 (18 overs)

20:25 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
HALF-CENTURY

Shreyas Iyer brings up his third T20I half-century in 36 balls at a crucial time for India. Came in with India at 20/3, and has produced a priceless fifty under pressure. Consecutive boundaries for Shreyas and Team India are picking up the pace. IND: 92/4 (16 overs)

20:19 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
Back-to-back boundaries

A powerful hit down the ground and a deft upper cut yields 1?0 off 2 against Stokes. Hardik Pandya goes big down the ground and then plays one over the slips for a boundary. Massive 5 overs ahead for the Men in Blue. IND: 83/4 (15 overs)

20:11 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
FOUR

8 runs off the final Mark Wood over as he bowls out his four of the innings. Shreyas Iyer moves to 38* with a boundary at third man. Team India need to do some serious hitting in the next 6 overs to reach a decent total. IND: 71/4 (14 overs)

20:01 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
India cross 50

India manage to cross the 50-run mark with a shot of the evening so far by Shreyas Iyer that goes for boundary. IND: 55/4 (11 overs)

19:56 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
Caught!

India in big trouble as Ben Stokes claims Rishabh Pant's wicket. Rishabh Pant holes out to the deep, departs for 21, picking out Bairstow at deep square-leg. Pandya walks out to partner Shreyas. IND: 48/4 (10 overs)

19:37 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
FOUR

Sublime timing from Iyer, uses Wood's pace against him to steal a boundary. Pant and Iyer have a big task on their hands to revive the Indian innings. India's 22-3 is their second lowest score in a T20 powerplay, and lowest when batting first. Also the joint lowest powerplay score by a team against England in T20s (Afghanistan were 22-5, batting 2nd, in Colombo in 2012 ICC World T20). IND: 29/3 (7 overs)

19:31 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
Pant, Iyer hold on at the end of powerplay

The powerplay comes to an end and it has been all about England and their pressure. Pant (16) and Iyer (1) survive the onslaught for another over, scoring two runs in Jordan's six deliveries. Can the hosts bounce back or will they fall apart? IND: 22/3 (6 overs)

19:25 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
BOWLED HIM!

Just when Pant was injecting some confidence into the batting order, Dhawan falls. The opener tries to up the tempo, goes for a wild slog against Wood but is way too late on the shot... gets cleaned up. He scored a 12-ball 4. IND: 20/3 (5 overs)

India's innings so far

Rishabh Pant: 15-0, 9 balls faced, 2 fours, 1 six

Everyone else: 5-3, 21 balls faced, 0 fours, 0 sixes#INDvENG pic.twitter.com/T0RscVjWqA

12 MAR 2021
Pant finds his groove early on

England are certainly the team to beat as they are the top-ranked T20I team in the world. But Pant doesn't care about rankings. He comes on, hits Rashid for a four, reverse-sweeps Archer for a six, and then a four through square leg. IND: 18/2 (4 overs)

19:13 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
WICKET!

Ahmedabad shocked! Right after Rahul's dismissal, Kohli walks back too on a five-ball duck. The skipper handled Archer late in the previous over, but he falls to Rashid's delivery. Jordan with the catch near mid-on. England in the driving seat. IND: 3/2 (2.3 overs)

?? KL Rahul
?? Virat Kohli

India have lost two big wickets inside the first three overs. A dream start for England ??#INDvENG | https://t.co/c6nwSdBr8j pic.twitter.com/AFsHlPn69O

WICKET!

England have their early breakthrough and the entire visiting camp is ecstatic! Archer strikes gold on his second ball of the innings as he dismisses Rahul for just 1. The batsman dragged one back on to the stumps. Next up, Virat Kohli. IND: 2/1 (1.2 overs)

19:06 (IST)
12 MAR 2021
Rahul, Dhawan start proceedings

KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan come out to open for India as Rohit Sharma has been rested for the opening two matches. England start with spin as Adil Rashid starts the proceedings. Both the batsmen open their accounts with two singles. IND: 2/0 (1 over)

ENG win toss, opt to bowl first

England win the toss and elect to field first. "We're going to have a bowl. Looks a good wicket with a covering of grass. A little bit of dew later on. Going to be an evenly-poised contest. The key is to evolve in our game," said Eoin Morgan after the toss.

12 MAR 2021
Eye on England, mind on World conquest

Much like the 2019 World Cup, India head into the 2021 T20 World Cup with a similar quandary: Who should bat at number four? Should they go with Shreyas Iyer or do they give Suryakumar Yadav a long rope? Or should they stick with Manish Pandey? And since IPL 2021 is round the corner, what if another batsman emerges and complicates the picture further? | READ MORE |
