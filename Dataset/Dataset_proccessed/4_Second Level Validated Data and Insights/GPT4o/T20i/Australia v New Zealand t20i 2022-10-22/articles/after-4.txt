Allen dispatches Starc to start T20 World Cup

1 / 20

New Zealand youngster Finn Allen has stunned Australia's bowling attack with an incredible display of power hitting in his first World Cup innings.

The 23-year-old partnered Devon Conway at the top of the Black Caps' innings in the Super 12 clash at the SCG and tore apart the reigning champions' first-choice bowling attack.

Allen was eventually clean bowled by Josh Hazlewood, but not before laying waste to he, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc in a stunning 16-ball knock which yielded 42 runs.

The right hander bludgeoned five fours and three sixes in his incredible innings, with New Zealand putting on 56 for the first wicket in just 25 deliveries.

It was a knock that left those watching all around the world, including New Zealand great Ian Smith on commentary.

Allen bludgeoned a boundary in half of the deliveries he faced, giving New Zealand the perfect platform Getty

"This is one of the best bowling attacks I've ever seen in white ball cricket on their home patch," he said on Nine's coverage.

"They know how to bowl on this pitch, but they weren't allowed to. Quite incredible how New Zealand just went bang right from the outset, and it worked.

"The mental side of it for me is interesting, the freedom that he expressed mentally as much as his strokeplay.

"This is a massive occasion. This is game one of a T20 World Cup against the current champions on their home patch.

"It didn't faze him, that's what got me. He had a mindset to just enjoy it and express himself and boy did he do that."

Allen's aggressive strokeplay provided a stark contrast to New Zealand's batting efforts in last year's World Cup final against Australia, where it ambled to a score of 57 inside the first 10 overs.
