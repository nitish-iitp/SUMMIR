There is some soul searching to do for the Australians. The tournament isn't over but they are going to have to improve their performances. Their next match is an absolute crucial match.

And that is that.

New Zealand have hammered hosts and defending champions Australia in the opening game of the World Cup.

An 89-run margin is an absolute mauling.

Pat Cummins skies Tim Southee into the gloves of Devon Conway to complete the rout.

A Kiwi win is no surprise, but who saw this thrashing coming?

This is on course to be Australia's biggest T20 loss in terms of runs to New Zealand and against allcomers in a World Cup match. Quite the shallacking.

Trent Boult was too smart. The old knuckle ball. He's bringing out all the party tricks.

Phillips has been very good in the field. We saw a big superman dive earlier. I'm very impressed with him.

Just for the record, Ferguson is bowling at about 90mph. Imagine how quick he would be without a moustache to slow him down.

Australia won't have long to pick themselves up from this. They have to make the long trip to Perth to play Sri Lanka on Tuesday. All of a sudden, that is a must-win.

This match is continuing, but the contest is done. It's just how these two teams can alter their net run-rate. England's game against Afghanistan is less than an hour away.

Mitchell Starc is the new man. Earlier this week I saw Aussie coach Andrew McDonald touting him as a reserve wicketkeeper, probably because he could get some tips from wife Alyssa Healy.
