    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Glenn Maxwell: 'They played brilliantly. They got too many runs and we weren't able to get partnerships, all the way through the innings we kept losing wickets. It was basically how not to play a T20.'",
        "Mitch Santner: 'It's obviously a tough place to win, we've found that over the years so, it was nice to fire some shots early tonight. It's obviously a long tournament, any team in this pool can upset anyone.'",
        "Aaron Finch: 'They got the jump on us with the bat and we never really recovered. When you're chasing a big total it can come undone like that, and we were totally outplayed in all three facets. [Net run rate] took a hammering, didn't it? You've got to plan to win the next four games and get some luck on the way. But we have belief in our team to do that.'"
