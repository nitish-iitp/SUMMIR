Ruben Trumpelmann came out all guns firing after captain Gerhard Erasmus won the toss and opted to bowl on a pitch that had plenty of assistance for bowlers.

Namibia vs Oman: Updates

Namibia could not have asked for a better start as Ruben Trumpelmann got the big wickets of opener Kashyap Prajapati and captain Aqib Ilyas in the first two deliveries of the game. It was a left-arm swing bowling masterclass from Trumpelmann as he got the ball to swing into the right-handers. Prajapati was undone by a fuller-length delivery that swung late. Ilyas received an unplayable in-swinging yorker.

Trumpelmann, however, was not able to get a hat-trick, but he struck in his second over, removing wicketkeeper Naseem Khushi for 6. Namibia were reeling at 10 for 3 in the third over of the match after the sensational opening burst from Trumpelmann.

Trumpelmann added another one to his tally on Monday as he got tail-ender Kaleemullah in the 19th over of the innings. Trumpelmann finished with figures of four for 21, his career-best in T20I cricket and the left-arm pacer found the perfect stage to do so.

Trumpelmann's figures of 4 for 21 were also the best for Namibia in a T20 World Cup match as Oman were bundled out for 109 in 19.4 overs.

OMAN STRUGGLE IN BARBADOS

Oman never got going in their innings in Barbados as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Zeeshan Maqsood, their experienced all-rounder, was the only one in the top-order to score at a strike rate of over 100. However, Maqsood was dismissed for 22 from 20 balls as Oman slipped to 37 for 4 right after the powerplay.

Khalid Kail and Ayaan Khan stitched a 31-run partnership, but Oman were unable to handle the variety and quality of the Namibian bowling attack.

Veteran David Wiese chipped in with three wickets while captain Gerhard Erasmus, with his off-spin took two wickets and conceded just 20 runs in four overs.
