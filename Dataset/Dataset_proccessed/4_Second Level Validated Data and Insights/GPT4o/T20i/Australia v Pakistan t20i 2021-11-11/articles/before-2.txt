Australia has made it to the semi-final of the T20 World Cup where they will meet unbeaten Group 2 winners, Pakistan.

Here's everything you need to know about the match.

When is it?

Australia takes on Pakistan in Dubai at the far-from socially-friendly hour of 1am AEDT Friday morning.

That's midnight Thursday in Queensland, 12:30am in South Australia and 10pm in the west.

You can watch the match on Fox Sports or Kayo.

You can also listen to live coverage on ABC Local Radio in all states (except Sydney) from 12:30am, plus on ABC Sport Digital across the country and the ABC Listen App.

Not many gave Australia much hope in this T20 World Cup after heavy series defeats in Bangladesh and the Caribbean.

However, Australia bucked expectations by finishing second in Group 1, recording four wins and just one defeat.

After a narrow, five-wicket win over South Africa in their first match, Australia beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets to put themselves in a very strong position.

A heavy, eight-wicket defeat against England followed, but blistering eight-wicket wins over Bangladesh and the West Indies got Aaron Finch's men over the line.

How have Pakistan done this tournament?

Very, very well.

After belting bitter rivals India by 10 wickets in their opening match, Pakistan have ridden a wave of euphoria all the way to the semis.

Wins over New Zealand, Afghanistan, Namibia and Scotland leave Pakistan as the only team yet to face defeat in this year's tournament.

That performance is all the more impressive considering the withdrawal of New Zealand and England from limited overs tours in the build up to the tournament threw Pakistan's preparations into disarray.

What difference will the toss make?

One of the interesting aspects of this year's tournament has been the way the different venues have played.

However, one constant is how important the toss is, and nowhere is it more important than Dubai.

Of the 11 World Cup matches that have taken place in Dubai, 10 have been won by the team batting second, around 90 per cent.

Overall this World Cup, the team batting second has won 26 of 41 matches, 63 per cent.

The one game in Dubai in which the team batting first won was between New Zealand and Scotland, which New Zealand won by just 16 runs.

Spinners are going to be very important in this match — in six of the 11 games to take place in Dubai, a spinner has taken man of the match honours, including Adam Zampa. Twice.

The average first innings score at Dubai in this tournament is 122, but that average is skewed horribly by some woeful efforts by West Indies (55 vs England), Bangladesh (73 vs Australia) and Scotland (85 vs India).

The highest score to be successfully chased down was Sri Lanka's 154 by Australia (3-155) — but Scotland managed 5-156 in their ultimately fruitless chase against New Zealand indicating that anything over 160 would pose an interesting target.

What is Australia's record in Dubai?

Australia have played three games at Dubai for wins over Sri Lanka and Bangladesh (when batting second) and a defeat to England (when batting first).

Pakistan, meanwhile, have won more games in Dubai in T20 cricket than any other team has even played.

From 27 games, Pakistan has won 16 in Dubai, with 10 losses and one tie.

Australia and Pakistan have met seven times at the venue, with Pakistan winning four of them  — including the two most recent matches in 2018. Australia has two wins, with one tie.

Australia has played 23 T20 Internationals against Pakistan, winning nine.

What happened in the other semi-final?

The winner of this game will play New Zealand in the final after the Black Caps had a five-wicket victory over injury-hit England.

When is the final?

The final will take place at 1am AEDT on Monday morning and will also take place in Dubai.
