Of course it will be bitterly disappointing for Pakistan because they have been the form side in this tournament and looked dominant for large parts of this game but unfortunately it was a really stunning partnership. You can't begrudge them that. They timed the chase really well.

'Brilliant at the end'

More from Aaron Finch: "I actually thought we were pretty sloppy today. We dropped a couple of chances, but they were tough ones. It shows the depth of our team at the moment and that is really important. You need the support of all 15 players or all 17, as we've got here, to get over the line. We've played some really good cricket towards the back end of the tournament.

"Teams have been successful chasing in this tournament. There is no dew but the lights take effect and speed up the wicket a little bit and the slower balls just grip a little bit. It was a nice toss to win. I was actually hoping to lose the toss and bat first because I thought it would be nice to put a score on the board in a semi-final but it is great to chase it down. It was brilliant at the end."

Wade 'unbelievable' - Finch

Australia captain Aaron Finch: "Not at any stage did I think the game was in the bag - it was a great game of cricket. The way that Matthew Wade held his nerve there at the end was unbelievable. The partnership with Marcus Stoinis was crucial."

More from Matthew Wade: "Early when I got out I got a boundary away early but then stalled for five or six balls so the rate can go from 10 to 12 to 14 really quickly. I was lucky to have Stoinis out there and. When we got it to a total from the last two I was confident we could get with a couple of sixes.

"It probably hasn't sunk in yet but I'm just happy I could contribute because I was out of the team a couple of years ago and I'm just glad I got an opportunity and repaid the faith."

Pakistan can take a lot from this tournament. They have had five wins and five different players of the match. They have had a remarkable tournament.

This will hurt because they were favourites going into the game.

Australia's Matthew Wade: "I was talking to Marcus Stoinis at the other end and trying to work out what they were doing a little bit but they went a little bit more pace on than I expected and I could probably have used the ramp a bit earlier but I was glad to get a couple out the middle at the end there.

"There wasn't a lot of chat before I went out but I'd batted with Marcus in the first game and we got us over the line. Marcus was really confident we'd get them but I was less sure because the rate was getting up there but he reassured me he'd find the boundary enough to take it deep and then I could chip in at the end."

It was an amazing game of cricket. It was fine margins.

Unfortunately for Hassan Ali those four balls have won the game. He'll have wanted to have been in that position - I've never seen him this low.

You just always have to be at the races in a big game. One mistake has pushed it in the opposition's favour.
