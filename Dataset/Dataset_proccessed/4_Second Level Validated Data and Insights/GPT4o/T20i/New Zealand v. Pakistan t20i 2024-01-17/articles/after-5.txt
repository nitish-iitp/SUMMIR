New Zealand vs Pakistan 2024 3rd T20I: Hosts New Zealand are a win away from winning their ongoing five-match T20I series against Pakistan. They though have been dealt a blow with skipper Kane Williamson ruled out of the remainder of the series because of a hamstring injury.

However, Williamson was anyway expected to skip the third T20I to be played in Dunedin with the South Africa Test series at home approaching. “With the Test matches so close as well and in the big scheme of things (they are) a higher priority I think we’ll try and make sure he’s right for that," New Zealand coach Gary Stead said.
