6,4,4,6,6: Finn Allen Tears Into Haris Rauf In 3rd T20I; Pakistani Pacer Got Brutally Trolled
Jatin Khandelwal

 

New Zealand opener Finn Allen slammed his second T20I century on Wednesday as he mauled the Pakistani bowlers all around the University Oval in Dunedin. Allen’s stunning knock of 137 runs in 62 balls propelled New Zealand to a total of 224, which resulted in a 45-run victory. The hosts sealed the series with an unassailable 3-0 lead with two games to go.

Such was the monstrosity of this knock from Finn Allen that it included only 5 fours but was glittered with 16 sixes!

Fast bowler Haris Rauf had a horrific outing with the ball as he leaked 60 runs in his quota of 4 overs and was the worst Pakistani bowler on show, by a distance: no other Pakistani bowler conceded more than 45 runs.

Rauf did get the wicket of Devon Conway on his second ball. He conceded only two runs in his first over, but after that, Finn Allen tore into his second over: the right-handed opener clobbered three sixes and two fours to the speedster.

Rauf returned to get more punishment in the 12th over of the innings. Once again, Allen took three sixes off Rauf, bringing up his century with the third maximum, in 43 balls. Rauf did well in the penultimate over of the innings, conceding 7 runs and taking the wicket of Mark Chapman.

This mauling that Haris Rauf got from Finn Allen led to his huge trolling on Twitter.

Haris Rauf got trolled mercilessly on Twitter as Finn Allen bashed him in 3rd NZ vs PAK T20I:

    

Man of the Match Finn Allen said: “Feels good. Wanted to keep it nice and simple, stay deep in the crease and hit through the line. (On conversation with Shaheen) We had a deal before that he wouldn’t bowl me any bumpers, he bowled me a bumper so was just having some banter with him. (Favorite six) One of Rauf over covers.”
