Squads

In a riveting cricket series, Team India are gearing up for the third and final T20 International (T20I) against Afghanistan at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on January 17. Having secured victories in the first two matches, India are now eyeing a clean sweep to assert their dominance in the shortest format.

Having already clinched the series, Team India are expected to use the final T20I as an opportunity to fine-tune their strategies and test their bench strength. The match in Bengaluru is likely to witness a few changes in the playing XI, allowing the management to provide opportunities to players who have been on the sidelines.

On the flip side, Afghanistan, who find themselves trailing in the series, are determined to salvage some pride in the final encounter. The Afghan team, known for their spirited performances, will be looking to regroup and deliver a strong performance in the last T20I. Captain Ibrahim Zadran, along with the experienced Mohammad Nabi and emerging talents like Rahmanullah Gurbaz, will play crucial roles in Afghanistan’s quest for a consolation win.

M.Chinnaswamy Stadium Pitch Report:

The  M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is famed for its compact dimensions, offering a paradise for batters. Seam bowlers frequently encounter difficulties on this ground, given that the ball tends to favor the batters when it comes off the surface. Although spinners may find chances to influence the game in the middle overs, the prevailing pattern at this venue heavily favors batters showcasing their supremacy. In essence, we can expect a match characterized by high scores and exhilarating moments.
