Drama to the very end! India and Afghanistan were forced to take the field for a Super Over after the two sides scored 212 runs each in the third T20I at Bengaluru's M Chinnaswamy Stadium. However, even a Super Over couldn't separate the two Asian sides on Wednesday as the six-ball-a-side affair also ended in a draw with both sides scoring 16 runs each. A Super Over to settle a Super Over! Here is the thrilling contest as it happened:

AFGHANISTAN

Ball 1: Gulbadin Naib strikes a proper yorker towards Virat Kohli. Rahmunnal Gurbaz wanted a second but Kohli and Sanju Samson behind the wickets combined to run Naib out.

Ball 2: New batter Mohammad Nabi steals a single of another yorker.

Ball 3: An edge hands Gurbaz a boundary as it whistles between the wicketkeeper and slip.

Ball 4: Gurbaz makes proper contact but a fast Washington Sundar ensures Afgan got no more than a single.

Ball 5: Nabi blasts a maximum to lift Afghan spirits

Ball 6: Nabi misses a beautiful delivery from Mukesh and runs by. Sanju's throw hits Nabi, takes a deflection as Mukesh stands watching. Afghanistan grabs 3 runs in all as Rohit Sharma expresses his displeasure.
