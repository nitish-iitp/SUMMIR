The last couple of overs had more twists than a spiral! What a game that turned out to be! Never really thought it would get that close. Credit to Zimbabwe to show the fight they did but it was Bangladesh who held their nerve and have bagged vital two points after three-run win over Zimbabwe at the Gabba.

Earlier in the day, after electing to bat, on the back of a half ton from Shanto, Bangladesh got to a competitive total. They ran through Zimbabwe’s top order but Williams fought a lone battle. However, it was Bangladesh who came out on top as they held their nerve towards the end.

For Zimbabwe, Williams fought a long battle. Yes, he got support from Burl but they needed their top order to bat better. That was not the case though but credit to them for the character they showed. They just did not give up. Excellent.

Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed were brilliant for Bangladesh but the others really took a beating. Had it not been for the 8 overs bowled from the two above, we could have had a different winner. Those 8 overs won the game for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh were brilliant with the new ball. They did the damage early on as they got 4 wickets in no time. Sean Williams then played well along with Regis Chakabva first and then Ryan Burl to revive hopes. Williams was brilliant, he scored a fine half ton and got the equation down to 26 needed in the last two. A piece of brilliance from Shakib saw the back of him.

However, Zimbabwe were still in it thanks to Burl as they needed 16 from the last over. They started believing more when it came down to 5 from 2 balls. The drama does not end here. It seemed like Hossain got two wickets in two balls to seal the deal but the last one was deemed as a no ball. It came down to 4 needed on the last ball but it was Hossain who kept his cool to come out on top.
