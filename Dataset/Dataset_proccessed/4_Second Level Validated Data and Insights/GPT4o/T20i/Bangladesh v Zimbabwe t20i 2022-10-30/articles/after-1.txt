Tigers win thriller at the Gabba

Opener Najmul Hossain Shanto and pacers Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman shone for Bangladesh as the Tigers defeated Zimbabwe by three runs in a T20 World Cup Super 12 clash that swayed back and forth till the last moment at the Gabba in Brisbane on Sunday.

Taskin, Fizz take two each to leave Zimbabwe reeling

Pacers Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman helped Bangladesh to a flying start, picking up four crucial wickets inside the Powerplay in their T20 World Cup Super 12 clash against Zimbabwe at the Gabba in Brisbane on Sunday.

Although there was little at stake for Bangladesh in the three-match T20I series against Zimbabwe, there were keen eyes on the performance from the new-look squad led by new skipper Nurul Hasan Sohan.

Credit where it is due? 

Like every other decision from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), the appointment of Nurul Hasan Sohan as the T20 captain of Bangladesh team for the tour of Zimbabwe caused surprise among the cricket fraternity in the country. However, this particular decision from the management might end up being one of the few rational ones in recent memory.
