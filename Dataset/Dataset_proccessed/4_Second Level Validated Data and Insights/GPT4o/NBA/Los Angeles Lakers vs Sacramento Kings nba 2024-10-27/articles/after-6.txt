After a tumultuous 2023-24 season, the Lakers changed coaches and headed into the 2024-25 season looking for internal growth more than anything else.

The Lakers parted ways with Darvin Ham shortly after exiting the playoffs in the first round at the hands of the Nuggets yet again. Eventually, after a very lengthy coaching search, the Lakers landed on JJ Redick to lead the way.

It was a big risk, but one that led to vibe changes right away with the Lakers. A younger, analytics-focused leader has brought a refreshing approach to the franchise.

Heading into the season, there was some cautious optimism. While Redick was a first-time coach, a lot of the signs early on were encouraging. That encouragement carried into the early stages of the regular season when the Lakers opened with a trio of wins.

It’s just three games and a whole season awaits them, but it’s a great first impression and could ease some of the pressure on both Redick and the Lakers. A lot of games will remain, but the Lakers have positioned themselves well in the early stages of the season.

Through all of it, including the trades and injuries or signings, we’ll be here to recap everything the Lakers do each and every one of those games here at Silver Screen & Roll. And to make it easier to find those recaps, you can bookmark this page and check the morning after for the latest for each Lakers game.
