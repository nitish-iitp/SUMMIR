LAKERS ANALYSIS
Lakers are lucky LeBron James chooses to rule in Los Angeles

Greatness that lasts 22-plus years can make the day-to-day appear mundane, but LeBron James continues to give the Lakers moments to remember.

LOS ANGELES - In this digital age, we have more footage, access and knowledge of LeBron James than virtually any other player in the NBA's history. And yet, the King is still not getting enough attention.

He put on a virtuoso performance on Saturday night, arriving like a tidal wave in the fourth quarter.

LeBron scored eleven straight points as part of the team's 21-0 run against the Kings. The first player to score after LeBron was Jaxson Hayes, who James assisted. LeBron then proceeded to score another five straight.

The reaction from the Lakers faithful was ineffable.

They rose to their feet, hooting and hollering to the point that my ears buzzed and my Apple Watch warned me that exposure to this decibel level could cause temporary hearing loss.

I gutted it out against my technology's recommendation.

LeBron wasn't just unstoppable in the clutch; he was perfect. In the final frame, he went 6-6 from the field, 3-3 from 3-point range and knocked down his sole free throw. He ended the night with a triple-double featuring 32 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists.

After the game, Lakers coach JJ Redick gushed over his 22-year veteran.

"I mean, what can you say?" Redick said. "We've all been very fortunate to watch his greatness for so long and the fact that he's able to keep doing it, it's just… it's actually insane. It's actually insane."

The run took the Lakers from down seven entering the fourth to up by 14.

For other teams, that would've been enough of a blow to end any hopes of a comeback. However, Sacramento isn't your typical team. They are stacked with players like Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Malik Monk and De'Aaron Fox, who can get hot in the blink of an eye.

This quartet did just that, scoring all 33 of Sacramento's points in the fourth quarter and allowing them a chance to still win the game. The Kings were down by just one possession with under a minute to go.

So, who came through and saved the day? LeBron, of course.

He brought the ball up full court and played the two-man game with Anthony Davis. When LeBron made his move towards the basket, both Keegan Murray and Sabonis collapsed on him. James did what he always does and made the right basketball play, passing to an open AD at the top of the key.

Davis rewarded him by hitting the 3-pointer, which gave L.A. some breathing room.

After a goaltending call on LeBron, the Lakers had possession, up by three. This time, LeBron's job was to handle the inbound. He fed the ball to AD again and he was immediately fouled with 10.6 seconds left.

All AD had to do was hit one of his two free throws to essentially end this game, giving Los Angeles their first 3-0 start since the 2010-11 season. The fans were so excited they roared while he approached the line.

LeBron realized the last thing AD needed was noise, so he motioned to the crowd for silence. They ignored his request and the first free throw was missed. The King got a bit more stern and they obeyed the second time around, resulting in a made basket and, ultimately, another win.

In the grand scheme, this game might get lost in a litany of other marvelous regular season performances from LeBron. It is a needle in the haystack of a phenomenal career with dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of games better than this on LeBron’s resume.

However, what makes this stand out is that on a random October night, LeBron can take over and have the Los Angeles crowd eating out of his hand.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

Last summer, LeBron was a free agent and virtually any team would've moved heaven and earth to acquire him if he had just said the word. By all accounts, he didn't entertain the thought.

He picked and continues to choose the Lakers as his team and Los Angeles as his home. Despite the odds not favoring L.A. as title contenders, he puts all his efforts into fighting to make the Lakers better and raise banner No. 18.

Don't take his greatness for granted.

Even if you've been a lifelong Lakers fan and have seen Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant and all the other greats who have donned the purple and gold, there's only one LeBron James and the Lakers are lucky to have him.
