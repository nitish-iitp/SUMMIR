LeBron James Stats Tonight: How did Lakers star fare in preseason debut vs Suns? (Source: Imagn)

LeBron James and the LA Lakers faced the Phoenix Suns on Sunday in their second preseason game. It was James' 2024 preseason debut as the four-time MVP missed Friday's contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves. James had a terrific start to his 22nd year in the league as he dropped 19 points in the first half before calling it a night.

James was actively engaged on both ends of the court, seemingly enjoying new coach JJ Redick's playcalling and offensive schemes that seemingly improved his shot profile and involvement. James balanced his workload within the game by playing on and off the ball depending on the plays called.

He added five rebounds, four assists and two incredible blocks to his tally while shooting 8-of-12, including 2-of-3 from long range. James also had a +9 box score as the Lakers took a 69-57 lead entering the half.

Not only that, but he also got to make his preseason debut on a historic night as he stepped on the floor next to his 20-year-old son Bronny James, the Lakers' 55th selection in the draft.

LeBron James and LA Lakers seemingly comfortable with JJ Redick's schemes

LeBron James and the LA Lakers looked highly efficient with their main rotation players in the first half. The Lakers offense was highly influenced by efficient playcalling, which heavily involved LeBron, Anthony Davis and Austin Reaves. The ball movement led to the Lakers recording 10 assists on their first 12 field goals.

Very rarely did the Lakers have to turn to iso ball situations which was a common theme under Frank Vogel and Darvin Ham. The Lakers ran plenty of actions to set up a better shot profile for all players, especially LeBron and AD.

One of the aspects that stood out about the Lakers offense was their screening. Coach JJ Redick also pointed out during his halftime interview (h/t Raj Chipalu on X).

"We really emphasized screening in our pregame meeting. Thought we did a good job screening. They are not switching a lot, and sending our side PnR to the middle. We did a good job screening and making plays out of that."

The Lakers struggled with it last year. Their structure was often not up to the mark, which significantly contributed to their failure to execute their offense efficiently.
