Lakers’ LeBron James, Bronny James become first father-son duo to share court in NBA history

PALM DESERT, Calif. — As the Los Angeles Lakers broke from their huddle, LeBron James and Bronny James walked onto the floor and into NBA history books.

The Jameses opened the second quarter of the Lakers’ 118-114 preseason loss to the Phoenix Suns, becoming the first father-son duo to play with one another in NBA history.

“Not real,” LeBron said postgame of his feelings as a father and player. “Still trying to get a little bit used to it, but pretty cool. It’s pretty cool for the both of us and especially for our family.”

LeBron said the magnitude of the moment crystalized when he stood next to his son as they picked up their defensive assignments.

“We stood next to each other and I kinda looked at him, and it was just like, ‘Is this The Matrix or something?’” LeBron said. “It just didn’t feel real. But it was great to have those moments out there with him.”

Lakers coach JJ Redick told LeBron and Bronny earlier in the day they’d be playing together for the first time.

Bronny said he was “pretty psyched” once he knew he would play with his dad, but added that he prepared as if it were a normal game. That said, he admitted it’s impossible to compartmentalize the situation and view his dad simply as a teammate.

“I’m always thinking about, ‘That’s my dad’ because that’s literally my dad,” Bronny said. “So I just go out there and, when I’m playing, he’s just my teammate. That’s all I’m thinking at that point.”

There was an extra layer to the moment: Sunday also marked Bronny’s 20th birthday. The Lakers celebrated him with a cake and cupcakes earlier in the day at the team hotel.

For LeBron, having that experience with his son on his birthday was special.

“For a father, it means everything,” LeBron said. “For someone who didn’t have that growing up, to be able to have that influence on your kids and have influence on your son. Be able to have moments with your son. And ultimately, to be able to work with your son. I think that’s one of the greatest things that a father can ever hope for or wish for.”

Redick said pregame that he planned on playing LeBron and Bronny within the flow of a game and not in a “gimmicky” manner. With LeBron and Anthony Davis available for the first time this preseason, and the Lakers trying to figure out their nine-man rotation, Redick used the beginning of the second quarter as that moment.

“It’s surreal,” Redick said pregame. “I’m very honored that I get to be part of history.”

LeBron made a 3-pointer and an and-1 layup with Bronny on the floor. Bronny did not score during the 4:09 minute stretch, but his father set him up for a 3-pointer out of a dribble hand-off that Bronny missed.

“I was really hoping that wing three on the little side DHO had gone in,” Redick said. “That would have been a cool moment, but they’ll have a lot of moments together, I’m sure.”

The Suns outscored the Lakers by four points during LeBron and Bronny’s shared time on the floor in the first half. LeBron and Davis rested for the second half.

“I just told him, ‘Keep getting better,’” LeBron said of his message to Bronny after the game. “I think, honestly, he’s young. Just turned 20. He’s young and wants to continue to improve. And that’s what is most important. So every time you get a moment out there, just continue to make winning plays. Continue to learn from his mistakes. Learn from the good things. And, I think, if he continues to do that, he’ll keep getting better and better as every moment goes on and on.”

The Lakers drafted Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. Bronny entered the NBA after just one year at USC, where he averaged 4.8 points and 19.3 minutes in 25 games.
