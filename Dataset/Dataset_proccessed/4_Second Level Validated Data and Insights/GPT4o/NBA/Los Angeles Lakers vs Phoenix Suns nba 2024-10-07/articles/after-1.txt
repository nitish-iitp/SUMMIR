On his son's 20th birthday, LeBron James might have given – and received – the best present of them all.

One of the greatest basketball players of all time left the court on Sunday night with as wide a smile as he has ever shown in his 22 years in the NBA. Despite scoring an impressive 19 points in 16 minutes, "King James" wasn't beaming over his performance as the Lakers came up short against the Phoenix Suns in a preseason game. James was ecstatic over something far more important than the result of a game that won't count when the regular season starts—he had just played alongside his son Bronny for the first time professionally. They both finished a day at work and walked away wearing the same jersey.

The proud father shared his thoughts with ESPN after the game—and it was clear that this preseason game ranked as one of the most memorable moments of his storied NBA career.

"I'm prepping for the game like it's a regular game," the elder James said. "But the moment when we came out of the timeout, and he was picking up full court, and I went up — because my guy was taking the ball out. We stood next to each other and I kind of looked at him, and it was just like, 'Is this "The Matrix" or something?' It just didn't feel real."

In the four minutes and nine seconds they shared the court, the James men became the first father and son to play together in NBA history. The moment clearly impacted LeBron and revealed the aspirations and values he has in being a father.

"For a father, it means everything," LeBron James said after the game.

There was a slight catch in his voice as he continued. "For someone who didn't have that growing up, to be able to have that influence on your kids and have influence on your son. Be able to have moments with your son. And ultimately, to be able to work with your son. I think that's one of the greatest things that a father can ever hope for or wish for."

Considering LeBron James had spent much of the last 22 years on the road, traveling across the country during his NBA career and spanning the globe to win medals in four Olympics, finally playing with his son ranks as his personal highlight. Whatever we may think of Bronny James in the NBA—and he has struggled in his first two preseason games—it's heartening to see his father wants to be present in his son's life, especially after all the time they spent apart over the past two decades.

According to Lakers Nation, LeBron James offered some advice to his son after their time together on the court.

"I just told him to just keep getting better. Keep getting better," LeBron James said. "I think he's young. Obviously, he just turned 20. He's young and wants to continue to improve, and that's what's most important. Every time you get a moment out there, just continue to make winning plays, continue to learn from mistakes, and also learn from the good things. I think if he continues to do that, he'll continue getting better and better."

The moment also hit new Lakers Coach JJ Redick, who explained to ESPN why he had put LeBron and Bonny on the court against the Suns.

"Just wanted to get them a chance to play together in preseason ... within the flow of the game," Redick said. "I'm thrilled that I get to be a part of this. I really am. It's cool as a basketball fan. I think it speaks to LeBron's longevity, but also his competitive stamina that he's able to still be doing this in Year 22. It speaks to the work that Bronny has put in to get to this point and really just the fatherly care and love, and certainly the motherly care from Savannah as well.... Bronny's such a great kid and he's a pleasure to be around."

Leadership expert Benjamin Laker—a fitting name considering who LeBron and Bronny James play for—found that working with a family member poses high risks but also offers great rewards. While there is potential for favoritism and strained relationships, Laker noted that bringing a family member on your team also offers more trust and inside knowledge of your industry.

"Hiring a family member can bring both significant benefits and challenges to your team. Enhanced trust, loyalty, and in-depth business knowledge are strong advantages that can drive the company forward. However, the risks of nepotism, favoritism, and potential strain on family relationships must be carefully managed," Laker noted in Forbes. "By weighing these pros and cons, you can make a more informed decision that supports both your business goals and family harmony. When considering whether to recommend a family member for a job, it's crucial to evaluate both their fit for the role and the potential impact on team dynamics and family relationships."

We'll see how having LeBron and Bronny James playing together pans out for the Lakers, but for now the emotional impact of the moment overshadows the various risks and rewards.

"We'll kind of get used to it, but it's pretty cool," LeBron James said about playing with his son. “It's pretty cool for the both of us, and especially for our family. It's definitely a moment that I will never forget."
