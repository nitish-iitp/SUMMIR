After a pair of flat performances to wrap up a season-long 5-game road trip, the Toronto Raptors returned to the friendly confines of Scotiabank Arena to battle the resurgent Detroit Pistons in the teams’ second game of the Emirates NBA Cup. It was an ugly game of badly missed shots, poorly timed turnovers, and relatively sloppy basketball befitting a pair of teams destined for the Lottery. The Pistons came out victorious — its second win to open round robin — defeating the Raptors 99-95. Six Pistons scored in double-figures, led by Malik Beasley, who scored 20.

However, the story in Toronto is not about the Raptors’ losing streak, which is now at 6 games. Nor is the story about the team having the worst record in the NBA (the first to reach 10 AND 11 losses). If you’re reading this and live in the 6ix, the story today, yesterday, and every day for the next two weekends is Taylor Swift.

Tay-Tay has taken over every conversation, caused incredible amounts of traffic, and literally shut down portions of the city. As a tribute to the living icon, this game recap is dedicated to the only artist I’ve ever tried scoring tickets to while attending a Raptors game!

“But she wears short skirts / I wear T-shirts / She’s cheer captain / And I’m on the bleachers” – “You Belong With Me” from “Fearless”

The Raptors were again without a handful of the roster. Scottie Barnes, Bruce Brown, Kelly Olynyk, and Ja’Kobe Walter were all on the sidelines in their freshest gear (maybe not short skirts), while Ulrich Chomche and DJ Carton were with the 905. The depth was tested at the tail end of the first quarter when Darko Rajakovic — shortly after some playing time for Toronto’s Cheer Captain, Garrett Temple — rolled out a lineup of Jamal Shead, Jamison Battle, Ochai Agbaji, Chris Boucher, and Bruno Fernando. Unsurprisingly, the Raptors were outscored 10-0 as the Raptors ended the first quarter with a 32-27 deficit.

“It takes everything in me just to get up each day / But it’s wonderful to see that you’re OK” – “Mr. Perfectly Fine” from “Fearless”

Despite shooting under 40% from the field, under 30% from three, and getting almost nothing from the admittedly depleted bench (8 points), the Raptors only trailed by 3 points at the half. RJ Barrett, Jakob Poeltl, Gradey Dick, and Ochai Agbaji combined for 44 of Toronto’s 52 first-half points.

“From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes” – “You’re On Your Own, Kid” from “Midnights”

Toronto quickly turned the halftime deficit into and 8-point lead in less than 5 minutes of second half action. Each of the starters scored as the Raptors led 68-60. But just as quickly as Gradey was splashing threes and Barrett was sprinkling in floaters and free throws, the Pistons turned up the defensive intensity and had the lead down to two in the late stages of the third.

Leading the comeback was Malik Beasley. The Pistons’ 6th Man of the Year candidate was thrust into the starting lineup after Tim Hardaway was sidelined with a head injury. Beasley scored 7 of Detroit’s first 9 points, helping the Pistons draw even at 82 early in the fourth.

“You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath” – “All Too Well” from “Red”

When you have a game that regularly sees several players better suited for the G League, it’s no surprise that one of the few veterans would shine. Jakob Poeltl had one of the best games of his career. He may not get the headlines like Gradey Dick or Scottie Barnes, but Poeltl has quietly been a steadying force this season. For the first time in his career, Big Jak scored at least 23 points and hauled in at least 16 rebounds in the same game. He finished with 25 points, 19 rebounds, and 3 blocks.

I think I’ve seen this film before / And I didn’t like the ending / You’re not my homeland anymore / So what am I defending now? – “Exile” from “Folklore”

Twice in the first half, the Raptors defense forced a difficult three, only to fumble away the rebound and the ball ending up in the hands of a shooter who drilled a three. Near the end of the third quarter, Chris Boucher blocked a three-point attempt. However, while corralling the rebound as he was falling out of bounds, Boucher threw it right to a Piston who found an open shooter that, you guessed it, nailed a three.

The real dejavu moment occurred in the final minutes of the game. Toronto was down 97-89 with just over 2 minutes remaining. With many fans ready to get up and leave at the next missed field goal, Poeltl banked in a layup, followed by Davion Mitchell hounding Marcus Sasser into a turnover that led to a breakaway layup. On the ensuing possession, Barrett blocked Tobias Harris as the shot clock expired. A hard-charging Barrett drew a shooting foul and calmly nailed two free throws. Raptors down by two, with all the momentum, and a raucous crowd chanting “DE-FENSE”. Harris would badly miss his stepback jumper and set the stage for another nail-biting finish.

But we’ve seen this film before. He didn’t like the ending.

Barrett drove the lane, drew multiple defenders and swung an incredible pass along the sideline to an open Gradey in the corner. Clank. The comeback falls short.

Or does it.

Jaden Ivey missed the first of two free throws, giving the Raptors a chance to tie with a three. Darko called Gradey’s number again. This time, the out of bounds play went straight to Dick. A quick sidestep gave Gradey enough separation for a chance at redemption and a good look at three. Clank.

”Back then we didn’t know / We were built to fall apart / We broke the status quo / Then we broke each other’s hearts” – “The Very First Night” from “Red”

Despite fighting back from an 8-point deficit in the fourth quarter and making it a one-possession game, the Raptors ultimately fell short. In addition to Poeltl, Barrett had 22 points, 7 assists, and 6 rebounds, while Dick scored 16 points (but zero over the final 22 minutes). Outside of that trio, nobody else scored in double figures. With multiple key players out, this Raptors team is built to fall apart. Fans are hoping their hearts are not broken when the Draft Lottery rolls around.

Or maybe the heartache arrives sooner. The Raptors complete a home-road back-to-back with a date in Boston against the defending champs. Can we move into the Cooper Flagg Era yet?
