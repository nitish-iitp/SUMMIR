Justin Champagnie added 15 points, while Carlton Carrington scored 11 points and made all three of his 3-point attempts to help push Washington to its third win in seven games. That wouldn’t be a positive stretch for many teams, but the Wizards have won only six times this season, and they are less than a month removed from ending a 16-game losing streak that left them sitting at 2-18 through 20 games.

Washington led by as many as 12 points in the second quarter, but the Bulls closed the half on an 12-5 run to trim the Wizards’ advantage to four, 55-51, at halftime. Poole led the Wizards with 12 points in the first half, while LaVine led all scorers with 15 points at the break for Chicago.

Washington shot 49.5 percent (49 of 99) from the field, making 17 of 36 attempts from 3-point range (47.2 percent). Chicago made 41 of its 92 attempts from the field (44.6 percent) and shot 29.8 percent (14 of 47) from 3-point range. Chicago outrebounded Washington 44-42 but turned the ball over 20 times on the way to being outscored 33-11 in points off turnovers. –Field Level Media
