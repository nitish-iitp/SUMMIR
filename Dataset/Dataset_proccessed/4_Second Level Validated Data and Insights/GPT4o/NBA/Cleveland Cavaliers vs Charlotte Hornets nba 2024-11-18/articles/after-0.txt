The Cleveland Cavaliers became the fourth team in NBA history to win their first 15 games of the season. Here’s your news and links of the day.

Ty Jerome - Cavalier of the Game

Jerome continues to impress. He got the start in the win against the Charlotte Hornets with Donovan Mitchell taking a night off. Jerome made the most of it as he posted 24 points and 8 assists on 9-15 shooting. And honestly, it wasn’t that surprising. That’s something that would’ve been difficult to imagine at this point last year.

Jerome’s understanding of the offense and how to pick his spots is what has made him so good. He knows the angles to attack and does an excellent job of reading and taking what the defense gives him.

“He stepped up tonight,” Evan Mobley said after the win. “I think he did a great job overall. ... Just playing with him and [Darius Garland] just makes life real easy. Ty always makes the right decision.”

“He is one of our best players right now,” Kenny Atkinson said. “It’s always nice having another ball handler out there so DG doesn’t get worn out.”

The Garland and Jerome pairing continues to work well. The Cavs have posted a 130.6 offensive rating when both are on the floor with a 21.2 net rating. Their ability to handle and move off the ball continues to make those groups work. That was on display in the fourth quarter when they took turns putting the Hornets away.

Cavs news

Isaac Okoro and Dean Wade left Sunday’s game with ankle injuries. Atkinson didn’t have an update on either’s return postgame.
