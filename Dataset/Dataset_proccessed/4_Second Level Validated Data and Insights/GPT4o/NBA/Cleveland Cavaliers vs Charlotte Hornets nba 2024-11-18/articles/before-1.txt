LaMelo Ball #1 of the Charlotte Hornets talks to media after defeating the Milwaukee Bucks on November 16, 2024

Charlotte Hornets star LaMelo Ball addressed his recent postgame comment that resulted in a $100,000 fine from the NBA.

Following the Hornets' 128-114 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Ball, 23, told reporters he wanted to address the comment — which the NBA called "offensive and derogatory" in a statement on Sunday, Nov. 17 — before his postgame interview.

"Before we get started, I just want to address the comment yesterday. I really didn't mean anything [by it] and don't want to offend anybody," Ball said on Sunday, per SI and The Athletic. "I've got love for everybody, and I don't discriminate," the Hornets guard added.

Ball made the comment during a live interview on the Hornets' FanDuel Sports Network after their 115-114 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday, Nov. 16, saying, “Yeah, we loaded up — no homo — but that’s what we wanted."

Charlotte's head coach said he spoke to Ball regarding the comment, assuring reporters that the NBA star is "obviously very apologetic."

"From what I've seen since I've been around him, he loves everyone," Lee continued. "He's a joy to have around the facility and it's not typically how he operates. He and I talked about the seriousness of the situation and how he needs to conduct himself going forward."

His brothers, Lonzo and LiAngelo Ball, also play professional basketball.
