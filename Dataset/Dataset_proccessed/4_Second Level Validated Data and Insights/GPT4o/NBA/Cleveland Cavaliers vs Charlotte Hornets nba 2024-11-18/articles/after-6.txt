DARIUS GARLAND’S 25 points and Ty Jerome’s 24 points helped carry the Cleveland Cavaliers as they maintained their unbeaten record by beating the visiting Charlotte Hornets 128-114 on Sunday night.

Four Cleveland players had more than 20 points as the Cavaliers extended their franchise-best winning streak to 15 games. They are the fourth team in NBA history to begin a season 15-0. Only the Golden State Warriors (24-0 in 2015-16) have enjoyed a better start.

Evan Mobley put up 23 points and 11 rebounds and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 15 rebounds to boost an offense that clicked on 57.1% shooting from the field. Georges Niang contributed 13 points off the bench.

Cleveland held a 72-59 halftime lead, shooting 66.7% (26-for-39) from the field. Because of that high percentage and 12-for-12 free-throw shooting, the Cavaliers secured only one offensive rebound in the half.

The Cavs had a double-digit lead at 18-7 about 4:10 into the game. — Reuters
