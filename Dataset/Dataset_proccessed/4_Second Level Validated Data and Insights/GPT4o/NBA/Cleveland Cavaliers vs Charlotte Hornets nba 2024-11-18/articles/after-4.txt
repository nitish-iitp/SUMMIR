Whenever a team, in any sport, has an extended stretch of consecutively winning games the focus is usually on the star players and the head coach of said team.

This has also been the case for the now 15-0 Cleveland Cavaliers, and for good reason.

New head coach Kenny Atkinson is off to, by far, the best start in the history of the franchise. Darius Garland is making a strong case for his second All-Star appearance and has been the best closer in the NBA so far this season. Donovan Mitchell is still the same dangerous scorer he’s always been, even though he hasn’t had to do nearly as much heavy lifting this season as he has in seasons past. Evan Mobley is finally becoming the kind of player everyone believed he could be, and Jarrett Allen has been more gritty, tough and efficient than ever.

When you delve a little deeper into the Cavaliers’ early season success, however, you can’t help but notice the impact that their backup point guard is having on every game. It doesn’t matter who they’re playing, whether they’re playing with a lead or in the midst of clawing their way back from a deficit, there he is leaving his imprint on both ends of the floor.

That backup point guard’s name is Ty Jerome, and he has completely changed the dynamic of the Cleveland Cavaliers with his play through the team’s undefeated march through the first 15 games of their NBA season.

In just 17.5 minutes per game Jerome is averaging 10.7 points, 2.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.2 steals while shooting a blistering 59 percent from the field and 54 percent from three point range. Almost all of these marks would match or exceed his career highs. Per 36 he is averaging 22.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 2.5 steals.

It is completely unfair for a team that already employs Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell to bring in another guard off the bench capable of having this level of impact.

Against the Chicago Bulls, while trailing 76-85 with a little more than four minutes left in the third quarter, Kenny Atkinson deployed an all bench lineup consisting of Jerome, Caris LeVert, Georges Niang, Sam Merrill, and Dean Wade.

That group, spearheaded by Jerome, would proceed to regain the lead. It ultimately led to what became a pivotal 24-7 run after reinserting Donovan Mitchell at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

It is easy to become enamored with what Jerome does offensively. He’s shooting the ball from deep with an insane efficiency. When he puts the ball on the floor he never gets sped up, getting to his spots at his own pace at all times, and seemingly always generates a high quality look whether it be for himself or his teammates. His sky high basketball IQ in constantly on display.

What is easy to overlook about his play is work on the other of the floor. Jerome has been as stalwart presence defensively for one of the best defensive teams in the league. He’ll never be the best athlete on the floor, but he is always in the appropriate position and the appropriate time and making life difficult for opposing ball handlers.

The Cavaliers decided to rest Donovan Mitchell against the Charlotte Hornets, possibly with an eye on their matchup against the Boston Celtics looming on Tuesday night, and who did they start in his place? Ty Jerome.

Jerome responded by posting a career high 24 points on 9-for-15 shooting overall and 4-for-7 from three point range. He also chipped in eight assists while only having two turnovers in his 32 minutes as the Cavaliers went on to route the Hornets 128-114.

After only appearing in two games during the 2023-2024 season due to a right ankle injury, Jerome has been sensational for the Cleveland Cavaliers this year. The “Core Four” of Mobley, Mitchell, Allen and Garland and their production will ultimately determine just how far the Cavs can go in the postseason, but it certainly won’t hurt to have a legitimate 6th Man of the Year candidate lighting up every team they play.

Ty Jerome may not be most notable player on the Cavaliers this season but, if they go on to do some special things this season, he will undoubtedly be one of the guys that is responsible for pushing them to the next level.
