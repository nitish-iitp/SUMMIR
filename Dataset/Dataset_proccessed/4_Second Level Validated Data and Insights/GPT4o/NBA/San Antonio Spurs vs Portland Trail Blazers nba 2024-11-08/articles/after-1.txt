@spicer81: "Did not expect to see this level of regression from Victor Wembanyama. He’s 7’4 and constantly settles for contested threes, being so passive as an offensive threat. All the tools to dominate, as shown last season. Way off it so far."

@jonspicks: "I just watched Deandre Ayton destroy Wemby in the first half. Something has just been off with Wemby all season. I think the Olympics may have exhausted him. Ayton should never dominate Wemby. Never."

@Drax_SAS: "Wemby is genuinely so bad at shooting now, the shooting coach needs to be fired for ruining his shot."
