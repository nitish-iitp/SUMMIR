        "New York coach Tom Thibodeau said after the beatdown, 'We got into a big hole right away. We started flat. Our defense wasn\u2019t very good.'",
        "Thibodeau owned the Knicks\u2019 lackluster performance, saying, 'We have to be a lot better defensively, and it requires a lot more than what we did today. That's my responsibility. I gotta make sure we're ready to go.'",
        "Thibodeau reflected, 'I always have the belief that we can do better no matter what we do. And so, when you fall short, you have to take a look and start with yourself, and we ask yourself, \u2018What you could do better?\u2019 And then you go from there.'",
        "Thibodeau added, 'As a coach, that's what I have to do. As a player, that's what they have to do. And then we have to do it collectively. It's \u2018We got into this together, we got to get out of it together.\u2019'"

        "The Knicks have more firepower now after their couple of big trades in the offseason to land Towns and Bridges. But it cost them their depth and the Thibodeau signature defense.",
