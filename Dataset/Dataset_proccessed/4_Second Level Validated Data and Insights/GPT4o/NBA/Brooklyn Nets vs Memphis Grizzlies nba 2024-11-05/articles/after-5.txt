Brooklyn
Ja Morant pulled off the most ridiculous 360 layup vs. Nets

By Renzo Pocholo Salao,

2024-11-05

Ja Morant on Monday added yet another unreal highlight to his growing catalog this season.

Morant’s Memphis Grizzlies trailed the Brooklyn Nets 57-56 early in the third quarter at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. The Grizzlies got a stop and had numbers in transition. Morant took full advantage.

With the Nets down a man on defense, Morant executed a give-and-go play with Jaren Jackson Jr. The Grizzlies big man hit Morant in stride as the guard cut into the lane. Morant took off like he was going to dunk on Nets defender Cam Johnson before spinning 360 degrees around him for a layup.

The slow-motion replay makes the play look even more insane.

Morant’s spinning layup would be the crown jewel on most NBA players’ career highlight reels. But the crazy part is that it wasn’t even Morant’s first 360 finish of the night. He pulled off something similar just before halftime.

Morant ended up with 25 points, 5 rebounds, and 9 assists on 10/22 shooting. However, his performance wasn’t enough to get a win as the Grizzlies still lost 106-104.

Morant’s last few seasons have been plagued by suspensions and off-court issues . The Grizzlies star’s highlight-filled start to the 2024-25 campaign has reminded fans of what they were missing.
