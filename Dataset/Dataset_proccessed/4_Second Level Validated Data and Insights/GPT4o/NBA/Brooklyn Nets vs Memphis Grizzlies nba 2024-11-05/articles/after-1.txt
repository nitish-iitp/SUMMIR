Watch: Ja Morant shows insane athleticism with eye-popping 360 mid-air spin vs Nets

Ja Morant showed what a healthy version of him could do as he showcased his intense athleticism to hit the bucket during the Memphis Grizzlies vs Brooklyn Nets matchup at the Barclays Center on Monday (Nov. 4). The guard, leading the charge for Memphis 13 points showed his explosiveness and agility as he successfully bucketed a 360-degree mid-air spin.

Morant, off a Santi Aldama pass barrelled to the basket, but had to wade through traffic with two Nets players, Nic Claxton and Keon Johnson in his way. That didn't deter the All-Star guard as he netted it in to help the Grizzlies go up 45-41 in the second quarter.

Despite Morant's pyrotechnics, the Grizzlies ended up losing 106-104 as the Nets pulled off a close win. The guard ended his evening with 25 points, nine rebounds, and five assists. Rookie center Zach Edey had a field day with 25 points and 12 rebounds. Jaren Jackson Jr. had 15 points to show for it.

For the Nets, Dennis Schroder and Cam Johnson led the side with 20 points each. Dorian Finney-Smith and Cam Thomas chipped in with 17 and 13 points respectively.

Ja Morant off to a solid start to his season with the Grizzlies

The Memphis Grizzlies' close loss pushes them to 4-4 and 10th in the standings. However, they will be buoyed by the fact that Ja Morant has remained healthy and is back to putting up consistent numbers.

The mercurial guard has been on a tear this season averaging 20.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 9.8 assists on 45.3% shooting. He has played seven games so far for Memphis this season. Morant is coming off a turbulent 2023-24 season. He missed most of the edition with injuries and a suspension but has looked his usual self this season and lent more teeth to the Grizzlies offense.

Ja Morant and the Grizzlies are on the back half of a two-game road stretch. They'll return home to face the LA Lakers on Wednesday night at FedExForum With both teams coming off losses, the onus will once again be on Morant to deliver with the Lakers struggling on defense so far this season. They play their next two games at home, followed by another three-game road trip with all matchups against West teams.
