The Houston Rockets continued their impressive run in the NBA, defeating the Dallas Mavericks 110-99 at Toyota Center, powered by a standout performance from Turkish sensation Alperen Şengün.

Playing 37 minutes, Şengün delivered a masterclass, scoring 23 points, grabbing six rebounds, dishing out four assists and recording five steals.

His energy and all-around brilliance spearheaded Houston's 22nd win of the season.

Dallas, now with a 14-14 record, struggled despite contributions from Quentin Grimes (17 points) and the duo of Klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving, each with 16 points.

Jokic’s triple-double

Nikola Jokic once again showcased why he's among the NBA's elite, leading the Denver Nuggets to a resounding 139-120 win over the Atlanta Hawks at Ball Arena.

Denver’s offense flourished, with Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. adding 21 points apiece and Russell Westbrook contributing 16.

Despite a stellar 30-point effort from Trae Young and 20 points by De'Andre Hunter, Atlanta could not match Denver's firepower.
