Thompson started the fourth quarter with back-to-back 3-pointers to give the Mavericks a little life. The Houston Rockets, however, couldn’t be denied. Alperen Sengun, Jalen Green and Cam Whitmore led the hosts to a 110-99 win.

Klay Thompson and the Dallas Mavericks continue to struggle without Luka Doncic

Klay Thompson and the Dallas Mavericks have struggled since Luka Doncic strained his left calf against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Christmas. The 110-99 loss to the Houston Rockets was their third straight and fourth in their last five games.

With Luka Magic out, opponents have been aggressive in sending double teams to Kyrie Irving. Uncle Drew has responded well, but against good defensive teams, the mercurial point guard has also struggled. Irving had 46 points on Saturday against the Portland Trail Blazers, one of the worst teams on defense. The Rockets, ranked second in defensive rating, held him to 16 points.

Klay Thompson has also been inefficient since Doncic went out. Before shooting 4-for-8 against the Rockets, he had been 7-for-24 from deep in his last three games. Doncic will be re-evaluated after one month. Thompson and the rest of the roster have to step up to give Irving a boost.
