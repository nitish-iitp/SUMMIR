HOUSTON (AP) — Derrick White had 23 points and Jayson Tatum and Payton Pritchard added 20 each to lead the Boston Celtics to a 109-86 victory over the Houston Rockets on Friday night.

The Celtics led by 10 after three and scored the first 11 points of the fourth quarter to push their advantage to 93-72. White, Kristaps Porzingis and Pritchard made 3s in that stretch to help the Celtics pull away for their third straight victory.

Boston was up by 21 points with about 4 1/2 minutes to go when coach Joe Mazzulla cleared the bench.

Porzingis added 11 points with five rebounds in his return after missing four games with a sprained left ankle.

Jalen Green had 27 points for the Rockets. They lost for the third time in four games.
