The OKC Thunder and Denver Nuggets opened their 2024-25 NBA season on Thursday in Mile High City. Oklahoma, which won last year’s season series 3-1, continued its dominance over the host. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the MVP runner-up last season, and Chet Holmgren led the visitors to a 102-87 win.

The seesaw battle in the first half ended when "SGA" and Holmgren outscored Denver 21-17 in the third quarter. OKC's superstar point guard efficiently orchestrated the offense and made Holmgren's life easier with pinpoint passing. The Thunder defense stepped up to contain Nikola Jokic and Co.

Jokic finished with 16 points, 13 assists, 12 rebounds, two steals and one block. Denver's starters were solid, but the Nuggets hardly got anything from the bench. Mike Malone's non-starters labored and managed to score 16 points in the entire game.
