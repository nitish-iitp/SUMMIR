Los Angeles
"I don't even know who we are" - Anthony Davis calls out the Lakers after embarrassing loss vs. Pistons

By Nicole Ganglani,

2024-11-05

The Los Angeles Lakers suffered their worst loss of the 2024-25 season, falling to the Detroit Pistons 115-103 on Monday. They even trailed by as many as 20 points against a rebuilding Pistons team that entered the game with a 2-5 record.

According to Anthony Davis —whose 37 points in 39 minutes weren't enough to save the day for Los Angeles—the team has shown two opposite sides early into the season. The 31-year-old knows that needs to change moving forward.

"We're just two different teams right now , " Davis said . "One game, we're this team who showcased it can be one of the better teams in the league. Then the next, we're this team who—I don't even know who we are. So, we just got to be better . ... We got to put a full 48 [minutes] together, and we can't continue to do this if we expect to do anything this season . "

Davis suffers injury

Despite another MVP-type performance, AD suffered a huge blow late in the fourth quarter after re-aggravating an injury that's been bugging him since the summer. His status moving forward is now uncertain.

"I'll talk to my trainer and just kind of figure out what exactly is going on , " Davis said after the game. "I've been managing it since this summer, honestly, and my goal for every game is to be on the floor. And I just kind of landed directly on the spot that's been killing me. So, we'll figure it out . "

If this foot injury holds Davis out, that's going to be a significant loss for the purple and gold, who depend on their big man on both sides of the floor. It also doesn't help that the Lakers' center rotation is extremely thin, with Christian Wood unable to play due to injury and Jaxson Haynes possibly facing suspension due to his issues off the court .

The Lakers have a lot of cleaning up to do

After going 3-0 to start the season, the Lakers' honeymoon stage with JJ Redick is officially over. They won one of the last four games, as their lack of bench scoring, perimeter, and transition defense continues to get exposed.

Currently, the Lakers rank last in the league in bench scoring and fast-break points allowed. They're also 25th in defensive rating. For context, the Pistons on Monday scored 28 bench points, 58 points inside the paint, and 22 second-chance opportunities. They also outrebounded L.A. by a wide margin, 55-37.

If anything, this road trip proved that the Lakers are far from contenders and are an AD or LeBron James injury away from losing their season altogether. The good news for them is that it's still early into the NBA calendar year, and there's a lot of time left to make changes.

Everyone on the Lakers side is afraid to be truthful... LeBron muddied up the waters of competitiveness by bringing in his son, just for a first in history. He cared nothing about winning. As athletes, this has caused a disruption. The Lakers are not a charity team or a Make A Wish team. Waive Bronny and get back to business. LeBron, your show is over.

There are several problems with the Lakers. The first one is LeBron James. He slows down the Lakers' offense and completely stops all ball movement so he can waste entire possessions in isolation just backing down opponents. Meanwhile, the rest of the team is just standing around watching. This happens a lot. Also, the idea of going through AD as the Lakers' primary offensive option is a problem. Relying the majority of the offense on an injury-prone guy with no real backup is asking for trouble. Limiting the Lakers' offensive system primarily to just AD with LeBron James throwing off the team's offense with his sporadic back-down isolation plays is a recipe for disaster. It slows down the Lakers' offense tremendously and it throws the other players out of rhythm. Teams will easily beat the Lakers because their offense is slow, limited, and highly predictable, while other teams are getting production and value out of all 5 of their guys.

Knecht should be involved more in the offense. Father Time is kicking LeBron's butt, that's why he can't move as fast anymore.
