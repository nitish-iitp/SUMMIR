        "Sabonis is off to a solid start to the season averaging 20.3 PPG, but has had two 28+ point games vs. LAL & UTA (both who are in the bottom-4 in defensive rating) to inflate his average.",
        "His next matchup will be vs. Ivicia Zubac and the Clippers, a team he\u2019s historically not fared well vs. Last season, without DeRozan, he averaged 16.3 PPG, and went under in 3 of the 4 meetings.",
        "Playing Zu more has also fixed up LAC\u2019s struggles in limiting 2nd chance points to the LOWEST rate compared to the 8th highest right last season.",
        "Zu has also helped anchor the defense to be bottom-8 in limiting PTS to the Roll Man and Free Throws (33% of Sabonis PPG)."
