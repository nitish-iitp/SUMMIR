Klay Thompson stats tonight: How did the 4x NBA champ fare in Mavericks debut vs Spurs (Oct. 24)? | 2024-25 NBA season (Image Source: IMAGN)

Klay Thompson sizzled in his official debut for the Dallas Mavericks in their 2024-25 NBA season opener against the San Antonio Spurs at American Airlines Center on Thursday. The former Golden State Warriors superstar took a familiar role in the frontcourt alongside PJ Washington and made a strong start after a forgettable preseason outing.

Thompson propped up 22 points in support of Luka Doncic's game-high 28 points. He made six shots from deep, setting a franchise record for most 3s on debut for the Mavericks.

The highlight of the evening was Doncic pulling off a Steph Curry-esque move when Thompson drained a 3 from beyond the arc in the fourth quarter. The Slovenian's expression went viral on social media soon after.

At halftime, Thompson had eight points, six rebounds and two steals as the Mavericks trailed the Spurs 49-47. The forward shot 2-of-7 from the field and 2-of-5 from the 3-point line in just over 13 minutes on the floor.

His numbers improved in the second half, as he fueled the Mavs' 120-109 win over San Antonio.

In an interview after the game, Thompson smiled and pumped his fists in happiness.

“The feelings were a lot of nerves, anxiousness, for a few minutes, then you see one go through and you feel great,” Thompson said of his first outing in a Mavs jersey. “Great debut. It’s only one game in October, but it feels good to get the first one out of the way.”

Thompson endured a difficult preseason, struggling to make shots. He averaged just 7.0 points per game on 33% shooting from the 3-point line in the preseason, but his struggles vanished in the matchup with the Spurs.

The Mavs will hope Thompson can build on this performance throughout the season. The forward was one of the blockbuster trades this offseason as he inked a three-year, $50 million deal with the Mavericks. Dallas had two stalwarts in Doncic and Kyrie Irving, and Thompson's addition further supercharges the side on both ends of the floor.

Up next, Klay Thompson and the Mavericks hit the road to play Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns at Footprint Center on Saturday.
