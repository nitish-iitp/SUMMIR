For the second time in his career, Victor Wembanyama opened an NBA season against the Dallas Mavericks. And just like his first game in the league a little over a year ago, the Frenchman had an uneven start. Wembanyama’s retooled support cast did its job but the reigning Rookie of the Year winner struggled.

In 14 minutes, Wembanyama tallied six points, four rebounds, one assist, one block and four turnovers. Dallas Mavericks backup center Dereck Lively II finished with six points, five rebounds, one steal and one block. Lively, who upstaged “Wemby” in their first career meeting, looked ready to do the same on Thursday.

Wembanyama added seven points in the third quarter but missed several long-range shots. The Mavericks' bruising big men, led by Daniel Gafford, kept him off the paint for most of the period. "Wemby" was content to hoist his shots from behind the arc where he went 1-for-4 in the third frame.

The Dallas Mavericks broke the game open in the fourth quarter by unleashing a demoralizing 19-5 run in the first four minutes. Dallas' explosion pushed its advantage to 106-85.

The "Alien" tried to rally his team back to the game, but Luka Doncic and his teammates had all the answers. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich took his superstar for good with 5:59 remaining in the game and the Mavericks holding a 111-90 lead. Dallas cruised to a 120-109 win as "Wemby" and the starters helplessly watched from the bench.

Mavericks' physicality was a key reason in Victor Wembanyama's rough-shooting night

Victor Wembanyama reportedly added 25 pounds of muscle leading into the 2024-25 campaign. The Dallas Mavericks did not waste time testing his more muscled frame. Daniel Gafford, P.J. Washington, Dereck Lively II and even Klay Thompson forced the lanky center from thriving inside.

Wembanyama took eight shots from deep but could have gone closer to the basket in a handful of situations. Dallas tried to wall off the interior where the 7-foot-4 star would have been nearly impossible to stop.

The Mavericks' defense didn't start when Victor Wembanyama had the ball. They made him work hard to get to his spots and crowded him whenever they could.
