The Dallas Mavericks suffered another injury setback as Daniel Gafford exited Monday's game against the Memphis Grizzlies in visible pain. The 6-foot-10 center sustained an ankle injury after landing awkwardly in the second quarter, grimacing as he went down.

Gafford, who is on a three-year, $40.2 million contract, was helped off the court and limped to the locker room. Shortly after, the Mavericks announced that he had suffered a left ankle sprain and would not return to the game.

Doncic has been out since Christmas Day after suffering a left calf strain and is expected to miss at least another month. Meanwhile, NBA Insider Shams Charania reported on Monday that Irving is dealing with a bulging disc in his back and is expected to be sidelined for at least one to two weeks.

Gafford's night was cut short after logging just eight minutes off the bench. He finished with five points on 2-of-3 shooting from the field, along with one rebound and one block.

Jason Kidd on Kyrie Irving's injury

Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd addressed Kyrie Irving's latest injury setback and the report suggesting that Irving will be sidelined for at least one to two weeks. Kidd stated that he would need a couple of days before providing further comments on Irving's condition as he is awaiting additional updates.

"He's out. There's nothing I can speculate or comment on," Kidd said ahead of the Mavericks' game against the Grizzlies on Monday.
"As you know, it's reported that he's out for a week or two. Give me 48 hours to get that answer for you. I don't know how. I can give you that answer. I don't know how."

Meanwhile, the Mavericks are scheduled to play on a second night of a back-to-back against the Lakers on Tuesday.
