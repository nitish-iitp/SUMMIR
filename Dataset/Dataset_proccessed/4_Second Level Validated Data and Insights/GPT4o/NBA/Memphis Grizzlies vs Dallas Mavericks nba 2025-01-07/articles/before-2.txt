The Mavericks already were without leading scorer Luka Doncic with a left calf strain, and earlier Monday, Dallas announced that backcourt mate Kyrie Irving will miss time with a bulging disk in his back. That meant both teams were without their starting backcourts as injuries kept Ja Morant and Desmond Bane out for the Grizzlies.
