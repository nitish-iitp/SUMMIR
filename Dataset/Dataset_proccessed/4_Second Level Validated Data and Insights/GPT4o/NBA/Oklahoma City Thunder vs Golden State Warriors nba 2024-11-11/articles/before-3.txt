Chet Holmgren injury update: OKC Thunder star suffers right iliac wing fracture

Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren (7) is helped off the court during the NBA basketball between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Golden State Warriors at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024.

(This article was updated with new information.)

With one fateful fall, Chet Holmgren's promising young season was flipped on its head.

The Thunder big man suffered a right iliac wing fracture on Sunday night in a 127-116 loss to the Warriors, the team announced early Monday morning. He’s expected to return this season, and a return-to-play protocol will be provided in eight to 10 weeks.

Roughly minutes into Sunday's game, Holmgren fell on his hip after attempting to vertically contest Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins. The 22-year-old remained on the ground, eventually rushed by trainers, before being helped to the locker room.

Holmgren, who refused to put weight on his right leg, wouldn't return to the game.

"Can’t tell if I feel better or worse about this having been through something similar before," Holmgren wrote on Twitter early Monday morning. "On one hand I know how to approach it, I know what to do, what not to do and how beautiful the other side is. But on the other hand I’ve felt the frustration of this process, and the wear it puts on your mind. Most of all I’m hurt I can’t help my teammates and play for our fans and supporters for a while."

Leading into Sunday, the 7-foot-1 center was staking his claim as one of the Western Conference's youngest All-Stars. Through nine games, he averaged 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks, the second-best mark in the NBA.

In Year 2, Holmgren anchored the league's No. 1 rated defense.

With Holmgren expected to miss games at least through January, the Thunder is without a center for the coming weeks. Isaiah Hartenstein, who's been sidelined with a fracture in his hand, is expected to return for OKC near the end of November.

"Everyone who sticks with me and our team, along with my need for hoops, is a big part of my passion to return," Holmgren continued on Twitter. "Don’t pity me or feel bad, there’s lots of people out there rn with real problems that don’t heal. Anyways excuse my rambling just wanted to address our okc fans and family. Thoughts from da hospital bed."
