Stephen Curry Hits Clutch 'Night Night' Dagger in Warriors Win Over Thunder

Stephen Curry hit two clutch 3-pointers, the second followed by his signature 'night night' celebration in the Warriors' 127-116 victory over the Thunder in Oklahoma City on Sunday. The 36-year-old scored a season-high 36 points in 36 minutes.

The Warriors seemingly felt a bit of deja vu, having begun their road trip with a 31-point lead against the Rockets that turned into a narrow overtime victory. Oklahoma City cut the Warriors' once 30-point lead to as few as six, but the Dubs were able to prevent going to overtime. The Warriors finished the difficult road trip with a 4-1 record, with impressive wins over the 7-1 Boston Celtics and the 8-1 Thunder.

KUMINGA SPARKS 14-POINT TURNAROUND IN SECOND QUARTER
Jonathan Kuminga scored 12 points in the second quarter, helping the Warriors turn a seven-point deficit into a seven-point lead. Kuminga opened the quarter with two threes, one from each wing. Then, he sealed his defender for a layup, hit a contested mid-range jumper and flashed to the rim for a two-hand slam. Kuminga shot 5-for-6 from the field in the frame. Kuminga finished with 20 points, following up his 21-point game in Cleveland.

CURRY SCORES 17 POINTS IN WARRIORS' HIGHEST-SCORING QUARTER OF SEASON
Stephen Curry scored 17 points on 7-for-10 shooting in the third quarter, nearly outscoring the Thunder by himself in the fame. Known as the NBA's all-time leader in made 3-pointers, Curry was particularly effective inside the arc over this stretch, making four of his five field goal attempts in the paint, all of which were heavily contested. The Warriors scored a season-high 42 points in the quarter, doubling up Oklahoma City (21 points). Curry finished with a season-high 36 points, surpassing his 27-point game against the Celtics. 

MELTON'S BEST ALL-AROUND GAME AS A WARRIOR
De'Anthony Melton started for the first time as a Warrior in his second game back from a lower back strain. Melton had his highest scoring output as a Warrior, finishing with 19 points. He was very effective as a 3-point shooter, especially from the corners, shooting 5-for-8 from three. Melton also grabbed 10 rebounds and recorded three steals.

GREEN ACCOUNTS FOR 11 OF WARRIORS' 35 ASSISTS
Draymond Green dished out a game-high 11 assists, generating 25 points for the Warriors. Ten of Curry's 13 made field goals were assisted as the Warriors collectively assisted on 35 of their 45 baskets. Green played the most minutes he's played at center on Sunday due to the Thunder losing 7-footer Chet Holmgren to injury early in the first quarter. He was able to counter the Thunder's guard-heavy lineup and showcase his playmaking skills.
