How did Steph Curry fare against the OKC Thunder?

Steph Curry is having a solid season for the Golden State Warriors, averaging 19.7 points, 4.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game. His scoring is down due to Golden State's impressive depth led by Buddy Hield off the bench. Steve Kerr is using a 12-man rotation that seems to be working.

In the first quarter, the two-time MVP scored his first bucket at the 5:38 mark. It was a rolling layup to trim the Thunder's lead to just three points. He followed it up with a step-back three, one of his trademark shots. He was subbed out after nine minutes on the floor.

The four-time NBA champ returned to the floor with around eight minutes left in the first half. He hit two 3-point shots in the period to help the Warriors build a lead against the hosts. Golden State finished the quarter strong and with a 65-58 advantage at the half.

Steph Curry began the third quarter by converting an and-one, and it opened the floodgates for the Golden State Warriors. Curry torched the OKC Thunder with 17 points in the period to help Golden State outscore the hosts 42-21. It was a classic Warriors third quarter wherein they controlled the game.

It appeared over before the fourth quarter happened and Curry won't be playing the final 12 minutes. However, the OKC Thunder bench came alive and trimmed the lead surely and slowly. Steve Kerr had to put back his starters to ensure the 127-116 win.

The Warriors improved to 8-2 for the season after Sunday's victory, while the Thunder will have the same record. It was just their second defeat of the season and their first one at the Paycom Center.

What's next for Steph Curry and the Warriors?

The Golden State Warriors finished the five-game road trip with an impressive 4-1 record. Steph Curry and the Warriors return home for their next game against the Dallas Mavericks on Nov. 12.

It's part of the 2024-25 NBA In-Season Tournament plus a reunion with a familiar face. Tuesday's game will be Klay Thompson's first game at the Chase Center since leaving the Warriors in free agency. He'll surely get a huge ovation from the Bay Area crowd.
