Denver Gazette beat writer Vinny Benedetto takes you around the NBA and inside the Nuggets:

NBA Insider

The second unit is almost settled. Now, it’s time for the group to gel.

“We don’t have a lot (of time) to figure it out,” Nuggets forward Dario Saric said of the second unit’s chemistry after Monday’s practice at Ball Arena. “Maybe the first couple of games of the season we’re going to still be figuring it out, but I think we have good pieces. I think we reacted well in some situations yesterday.”

Those pieces look likely to be Russell Westbrook, Julian Strawther, Peyton Watson, Saric and a starter staggering with the bench or a 10th player in the rotation, depending on the night. Sunday’s loss to the Suns was the closest thing to a dress rehearsal the Nuggets have had ahead of the Oct. 24 season-opener against Oklahoma City, and Denver coach Michael Malone closed the first quarter with Jamal Murray playing alongside Westbrook, Strawther, Saric and Hunter Tyson, who has filled in for Watson as he deals with a hamstring injury.

It's in line with previous seasons when Malone has played his starting point guard with the bench, ensuring either Murray or Nikola Jokic are on the court for every meaningful minute. Last season, that meant Murray and Reggie Jackson sharing the court. This year, Westbrook and Murray are navigating their minutes together.

“Just figuring it out, trying to figure out where he likes the ball, where he orchestrates at,” Westbrook said. “That’s my job to be able to do that and manage the game and be able to see where he can be effective while we’re on the floor.”

The second unit’s chemistry has been complicated by two new additions in Saric and Westbrook, inconsistent minutes together and a battle between Christian Braun and Strawther for the starting shooting guard spot. Malone said Monday that he likes Braun’s fit alongside the rest of the starters, and Strawther’s skillset offers more to a second unit short on shooter.

“It’s never going to be just about who’s playing better in a vacuum,” Malone said.

“I will give Julian some more chances to get out there and start and play with that group.”

Tuesday and Thursday’s preseason games against the Thunder and Timberwolves, respectively, present the final two chances for Denver’s new-look second unit to develop chemistry and an identity.

“The first unit is going to do their own thing, but we need to be like fast and furious,” Saric said.

“That’s going to be really important for us to win some games. Sometimes, you know, second units need to win some games this season. I think we have the quality for that, but we’re still kind of like figuring it out.”

 Nuggets vs. Suns: 3 takeaways from Denver's third loss to start preseason

What I’m Thinking

The most important thing the Nuggets can get from the final two preseason games is one encouraging performance from Jamal Murray.

The likelihood of that happening was thrown into question Monday. Murray was the only starter who didn’t play in the third quarter Sunday. Although the rest of the starters played 25 or more minutes, Murray played 19. Malone explained why after Monday practice.

“Going into the game, he’s been (feeling) great. That was the weird thing about last night,” Malone said. “He told me this morning that he had been feeling great, and all of a sudden, last night during his pregame warmups, it (his knee) was just starting to feel a little funny, if you will. A lot of times, he’s able to get going and play through it and it will loosen up. Last night, that wasn’t the case. Up until that point, he’s been healthy, ready to go.”

The Nuggets coach added that Murray told him like he feels he’s in a good spot from a conditioning standpoint. Malone shared a story of Murray frequently winning one of the team’s endurance tests even if he wasn’t the best conditioned due to his determination and toughness.

“Jamal’s mental and his ability to endure the pain is second to none,” Malone said. “That’s why he was able to just fight through it.”

A little more than a week from Denver’s regular-season opener, Murray has yet to play 20 minutes in a game. Through three preseason games, Murray is 6-of-19 shooting from the field (31.6%) and 2 of 10 from 3-point range with five assists and as many turnovers in 53 total minutes of playing time. That’s a far cry from the production expected of a player who just signed a four-year contract extension worth more than $208 million this summer.

The timing of the extension puts more pressure on the Nuggets to get the best out of Murray moving forward. That might mean giving him the rest of the preseason off in hopes of a healthy start to the regular season, but it would be quite the relief if Murray has an efficient scoring night and plays more than 25 minutes in either one of the remaining preseason contests.

What They’re Saying

The fitness test Malone mentioned is called the beep test. Players have to run a certain distance before a noise sounds and then turn around and make it back to the start before the second beep. Big men were required to hit a certain level, while wings and guards were held to a higher standard.

“A lot of guys got to a certain beep, and they were like ‘Man, beep this. I’m done,’” Malone said.

“Jamal is pretty special in that regard.”

Malone also gave props to Zeke Nnaji. While the fifth-year forward/center doesn’t appear in to be in the rotation to start the season, the 23-year-old posted 11 points, two rebounds, one block and a steal in 12 minutes against Phoenix. He made four of his five shots, including a 2-of-3 mark from 3-point range.

“Zeke Nnaji was a real positive last night,” Malone said. “I really thought Zeke came into the game, knocked down shots, had a presence at the rim, had really good defensive discipline.”

Westbrook brought Trey Alexander to his media scrum Monday and taught the rookie a thing or two.

“At some point in life, you got to understand how to talk to people. Media training is the first point of that,” Westbrook said. “So today, he’s going to learn from one of the best.”

What I’m Reading

The two teams involved in the biggest trade of the offseason met in a preseason game Sunday, and the matchup between the Knicks and Timberwolves provided plenty of entertainment. Former Knicks guard Donte DiVincenzo and New York assistant Rick Brunson, father of Jalen, had to be separated postgame. Timberwolves beat writer Chris Hine documented the night for the Star Tribune.

What I’m Following

- Bulls guard Lonzo Ball is reportedly set to return to the court Wednesday night for the first time after missing two full seasons, according to an ESPN report. Ball underwent a cartilage transplant on his left knee, an operation similar to what Colorado Avalanche forward Gabriel Landeskog had on his right knee.

- De’Aaron Fox is following Murray’s lead. Like Murray did last summer, the Kings guard decided to bypass a contract extension in hopes of earning an even larger deal next offseason. It didn’t quite work out for Murray, who failed to make an All-NBA team and become eligible for a super-max extension.
