Let’s take a way-too-hasty look at the talk of the town, rookie Ryan Dunn. And why the Suns are now fast-tracking for regular season success.

Your Phoenix Suns entered the 2024/25 season with a need to establish a new identity as set forth by Suns coaching savant Coach Bud. This would rest on the three-pillared supports of defensive intensity, a high octane pace, and blistering (also read: reliable) 3-point shooting,

Could a team led by mid-range studs get there—and how long would that take?

Four preseason games, it seems. And the Suns have the fanbase turning their collective heads.

Enter Ryan Dunn, a defensive standout with a fearless attitude on the perimeter—and so far, he’s more than rising to the challenge.

In all four preseason games, Dunn has been a constant on defense, showing off the skills that earned him the privilege of being selected 28th overall in the NBA draft and securing a spot on this roster. But it’s not just his defense turning heads—his shooting has been the difference-maker. His put-away-three sealed the deal in Denver, keeping the Nuggets winless and leading the Suns to an enjoyable 3-1 preseason position.

FLEX from Jersey says it well.

James Jones, Josh Bartelstein, and everyone who pushed for the Suns to chase this guy deserves a round of applause.

Dunn’s been throwing the ball at the basket with absolute gusto. But, it’s going in on the regular—and that’s what is impressive right here—providing a legit scoring option, NO ONE expected from the rookie. The Suns staff, who needed to nail this pick, must be breathing a sigh of relief, as Dunn already offers the kind of two-way play that echoes the impact of a two-way stud very close to our hearts: the one, the only, Mikal Bridges.

Is it too close to anoint Ryan Dunn as the second coming of Mikal?

Let’s read on and find out.

Mikal Bridges Comparison: Filling the Void

While comparing a rookie to Mikal Bridges might seem ambitious, Dunn’s game has provided early hope. Bridges, known for his elite perimeter defense and solid 3-point shooting, was a core piece of the Suns’ defensive identity. In Ryan Dunn, the Suns may have found a player who can contribute similarly, as he grows into his role. Though it’s early days (yes, very early days), Dunn’s preseason performance—particularly his no-hesitation shot from deep—gives Suns fans optimism that the team has unearthed a future defensive stalwart with actual offensive upside.

Is the Mikal-sized comparison accurate? Have a look at these rookie-year numbers.

Playing in all 82 games of the 2018-19 regular season, Mikal’s numbers to finish the season looked like this:

GAMES PLAYED 82 | 8.3 PPG | 3.2 RPG | 2.1 APG | 1.6 SPG | 0.5 BPG | 29.5 MPG

FG% 43% on 6.9 attempts

3P% 33.5% on 3.8 attempts

FT% 80.5% on 1.4 attempts

Realistically, if the preseason is anything to go by, the framework is there for Ryan Dunn’s rookie stat sheet to look awefully similar. Don’t you think? Ryan Dunn has gone against LeBron, Cade, and Jokic so far—he’s not out there playing against bench units or G-League stand-ins. For intents and purposes, these are actual games against actual players—and that’s what makes this look so good right now.

So, what are Ryan Dunn’s numbers four games in?

I was hoping you’d ask that.

Across the four games, he’s logged 22.7 minutes per game, contributing 11.0 points on 3.5 made field goals from 8.5 attempts. Notably, he’s knocking down 3.0 threes per game on an impressive 44.4% from beyond the arc (6.75 attempts per game), showing off a reliable stroke that we didn’t necessarily expect to see at this level.

But it’s not just his shooting. Dunn is doing the dirty work, too, averaging 3.75 rebounds (3.25 defensive), and has put up a steady 1.5 assists, 1.25 steals, and 1.75 blocks per contest. Defensively, he’s been as advertised—constantly pestering opponents, getting into passing lanes, and even coming up with nearly 2 blocks per game, which is particularly eye-opening for a rookie.

What really jumps off the page, though, is his +4.75 Plus/Minus over these four games. Dunn is making a noticeable impact, even when he’s not lighting up the scoreboard. His presence alone is creating positive momentum for the Suns.

In short, Dunn looks like the real deal. A Mikal Bridges-sized real deal. He’s doing a bit of everything—things we expected, like hustling on defense, making smart plays and doing things we hardly anticipated—like being a knock-down shooter with the potential to do so on volume.

This should only have us Suns fans excited about what’s to come.

Hope for the Future: Dunn’s Promise

Dunn's breakout potential could not have come at a better time for a team with limited draft picks in recent years and a tight payroll situation. While the jury is out regarding Dunn's ability to fully replicate everything Bridges did immediately, the early signs suggest the Suns may have found a player capable of filling some of the gaps left behind by one of the team’s most valuable former assets.

The talk surrounding Dunn coming into the draft was that he’d fill out as a Matisse Thybulle or Andre Roberson type, but with his desire to shoot, he’s already passed that ceiling.

With Ryan Dunn continuing to show out on both ends of the floor, Suns fans have every reason to be excited. In a season full of championship aspirations, this young rookie has provided a glimpse of hope that Phoenix’s future is in good hands. Now, it’s up to Dunn to keep this momentum going.

If his first few games are any indication, the Suns are in for something special—Mikal-sized special—and we’re here for it.
