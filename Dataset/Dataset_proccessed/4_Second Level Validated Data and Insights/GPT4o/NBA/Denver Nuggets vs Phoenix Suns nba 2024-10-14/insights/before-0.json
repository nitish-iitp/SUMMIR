    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "The Nuggets have yet to win a game this preseason but color me not all that concerned.",
        "The most glaring hole right now seems to be in the backup forward spot and hopefully that gets assuaged with the return of Peyton Watson.",
        "Jokic looks in MVP form, the bench additions plus Strawther\u2019s growth make for a potent second unit and Braun seems to be fitting in just fine as the starting two guard.",
        "Depth is the biggest question mark and Jamal Murray only playing a half did highlight the lack of playable point guards on the Nuggets roster later in the game but going into the season Denver looks primed to be playing very high level basketball as long as they are healthy."

        "The lead stretched into double digits but the Suns still knocked down a couple threes to keep it around ten.",
        "The Suns came out hot though and got within three points in the opening minutes of the second half.",
        "Denver kept in front by a bucket or two but kept blowing easy layups.",
        "The Nuggets offense started to stall out and Phoenix took the lead.",
        "The Nuggets offense consisted of setting up outside shots for their bigs which did not yield great results, putting the chance for victory in danger.",
        "Julian Strawther continued to be Denver\u2019s main source of offense, keeping them within striking distance.",
        "Ryan Dunn got the last laugh, burying a dagger three with just over twenty seconds to go.",

        "Porter Jr. was in his bag tonight.",
        "He had his standard long distance sniper game going, but he also just looks like such a difficult player to defend right now.",
        "The added muscle from the offseason is noticeable in his game as he bullied his defender on more than one occasion tonight.",
        "He also doesn\u2019t seem to have lost any speed or shooting with his added bulk.",
        "Hopefully Denver can find more and more ways to get the ball in his hands and let him exploit matchups against smaller forwards."
