The Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors finally faced off for the first time this season on Sunday at the Chase Center. The two teams last battled in the NBA Play-In Tournament last season, with Sacramento blowing out Golden State in Klay Thompson's last game with the Warriors.

Sunday's game did not feature the matchup between Steph Curry and De'Aaron Fox. The Kings' star guard was ruled out with an injury, and Malik Monk was tasked with taking over for at least this contest.

Nevertheless, the Kings dominated the hosts to get the easy 129-99 win. Monk stepped up with 26 points, 12 assists and four steals, while Domantas Sabonis dropped an effortless 22 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. Kevin Huerter and Devin Carter scored 16 and 13 points off the bench, respectively.

Steph Curry had 26 points and seven rebounds for the Warriors, but it fell way short of what the team needed. Andrew Wiggins scored 18 points, while the rest of Golden State's corps did not have any firepower. Moses Moody had 13 points off the bench, but it was mostly during garbage time.
