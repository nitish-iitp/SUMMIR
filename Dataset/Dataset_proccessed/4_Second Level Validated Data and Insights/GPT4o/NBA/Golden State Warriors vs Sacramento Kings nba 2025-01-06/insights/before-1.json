        "Following the loss, Curry was very honest about how this Warriors squad is not built to come back from large deficits.",
        "Curry said, 'When you're looking up and it's a double-digit lead before the first timeout and 36-21, we're not really built for it to have that crazy comeback. We haven't shown [the ability to come back], and it's just one of those things where you don't want to be in that situation, especially in a back-to-back... We would have loved to have started the game a lot better to give ourselves a chance.'"
