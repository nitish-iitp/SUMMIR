The LA Lakers shook off a sluggish first half and Anthony Davis' eye injury to beat the Toronto Raptors 123-103 on Sunday. Against the road-weary visitors, Los Angeles fell behind by 10 points early and trailed 34-26 after the first 12 minutes. They outscored their opponents 97-69 in the next three quarters to get the decisive win.

AD finished with 22 points, four rebounds, three assists and two blocks. 19 of his points came in the first half. He exited a little past the halfway point of the third quarter after an inadvertent eye poke. LeBron James tallied 19 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds for his second straight triple-double.

The Toronto Raptors gave a good fight, but playing on short rest and without key players proved too much to overcome.
