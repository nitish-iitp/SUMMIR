Bronny James: Lakers Preseason Debut 'Game for New Beginnings,' 'Feeling Things Out'

Los Angeles Lakers rookie Bronny James called his Friday preseason debut against the Minnesota Timberwolves a "game for new beginnings."

"Just trying to get out there, get a feel for the game, and get comfortable, like how I did in Summer League. I feel like it's the same thing," James told reporters after Saturday's practice. "Basically, just go out there and feeling things out."

The Lakers opened the preseason on Friday with a 124-107 loss to the Timberwolves.

James, the No. 55 pick of the 2024 draft and eldest son of Lakers star LeBron James, recorded two points, an assist and a rebound while leading the team with three blocks in the loss.

Lakers first-year head coach J.J. Redick praised James after the game as a "really disruptive defender," and James credited Redick for pushing him to develop his defensive game ahead of his preseason debut.

"J.J. already talks about, if I wanna play, I've got to be disruptive on the defensive end," James said. "So just me, focusing on that, I feel like it was really good for me."

James told reporters that after watching back tape of his preseason debut he planned to work on "being aggressive on both ends of the court."

"Just going out there and playing my best and trying to find my role," James said.

James will make his second preseason appearance for the Lakers on Sunday against the Phoenix Suns, which the 19-year-old said would be a "full-circle moment" after he held one of his two pre-draft workouts with the Suns in June.

That's not that only reason Sunday's game will be notable. LeBron James is expected to make his preseason debut against the Suns, which will mark the first time he and his son have both suited up for the same Lakers game.

In six Summer League games played in San Francisco and Las Vegas, James averaged seven points on 32.7 percent shooting from the field while adding 3.5 rebounds, 1.5 assists and one steal per game.

After struggling with his shooting early in the summer, James improved over his final two Summer League contests as he totaled 25 points on 10-of-21 shooting.

James will hope to see similar growth in his game as his preseason continues. After this weekend's contest against the Suns, the Lakers will have four preseason contests remaining before the Oct. 22 preseason opener against the Timberwolves.
