OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Chet Holmgren each scored 29 points to help the Oklahoma City Thunder rout the Houston Rockets 126-107 on Friday night.

Oklahoma City opened a six-game homestand with a victory after losing at Denver on Wednesday night for its first defeat of the season.

Gilgeous-Alexander made 10 of his first 11 field goals and didn't take a 3-pointer until his 13th shot. It went in to give the Thunder a 96-73 lead in the third quarter.

Holmgren made 8 of 14 field goals, including 4 of 6 3-pointers, for the Thunder (8-1). Oklahoma City pulled away from a game that was tied 31-all at the end of the first quarter.

The Thunder had been inconsistent on offense so far this season, but they figured things out in this game. They shot 51.1% from the field and made 20 of 23 free throws.

Dillon Brooks scored 17 points for the Rockets (5-4), who shot just 43.3% from the field.

Takeaways

Rockets: The Thunder showed why they lead the league in defensive rating when they shut down Houston's top two scorers, Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun. Green scored 14 points on 5-for-14 shooting and Sengun had 11 points on 3-for-12 shooting.

Thunder: Oklahoma City's depth and versatility were too much for the Rockets. Holmgren, in particular, was a problem on both ends. The 7-footer had three blocks and constantly affected Houston's shots near the rim.
