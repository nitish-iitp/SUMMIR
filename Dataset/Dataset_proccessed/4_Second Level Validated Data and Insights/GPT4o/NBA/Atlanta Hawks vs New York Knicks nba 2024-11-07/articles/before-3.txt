Takeaways

Knicks: The Knicks shook off a sluggish start and played well in the final three quarters in front of a healthy contingent of Knicks fans in Atlanta but ultimately finished their road trip 2-2.

Hawks: The Hawks bounced back from a poor showing in a 30-point loss to the Celtics with one of their best efforts of the season. Risacher played by far his best game of the season.
