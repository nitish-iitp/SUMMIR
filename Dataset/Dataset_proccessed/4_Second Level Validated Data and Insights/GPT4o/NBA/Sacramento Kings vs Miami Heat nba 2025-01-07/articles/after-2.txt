The Miami Heat suffered a heartbreaking 123-118 double-overtime loss to the Sacramento Kings on Monday, blowing a 17-point fourth-quarter lead and critical opportunities to secure the win. The defeat marked Miami’s third consecutive loss, dropping them to 17-17 on the season.

Meanwhile, Sacramento extended their winning streak to a season-high five games under interim coach Doug Christie, with DeMar DeRozan spearheading the victory.
DeRozan delivered when it mattered most, scoring nine of Sacramento’s 11 points in the second overtime, including several clutch jumpers. The Kings capitalized on Miami’s late-game miscues, including Jaime Jaquez Jr.’s missed free throws in the first overtime and Tyler Herro’s costly 8-second violation late in the fourth quarter.

Jaquez recorded his first career triple-double with 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists but will rue his missed chances to put the game out of reach.

Herro led Miami with 26 points but faltered under the pressure of double teams, while Terry Rozier chipped in 18. Bam Adebayo’s shooting struggles continued as he managed just 6-of-19 from the field.

Despite their efforts, Miami’s bad habits surfaced once again, including allowing 13 offensive rebounds to Sacramento. The Heat’s inability to close out games has been a recurring theme, and Monday’s collapse was emblematic of their struggles.

“There will be a breakthrough,” Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said postgame. “We’re going to learn from these tough games. We’ve had some tough ones. We all feel it… what you do is you go into it. You lean into the pain & learn from these tough Ls & fight for that breakthrough.”

As the Heat continue searching for their breakthrough, Spoelstra’s group must address their late-game execution and defensive consistency if they hope to regain their footing in the Eastern Conference.

I missed this one, but it’s nice to see the boys put up a fight. Shoutout to Jamie with the triple double. I’ll tune in for the second half of the Warriors game tonight, but it might get ugly without Boy Wonder
