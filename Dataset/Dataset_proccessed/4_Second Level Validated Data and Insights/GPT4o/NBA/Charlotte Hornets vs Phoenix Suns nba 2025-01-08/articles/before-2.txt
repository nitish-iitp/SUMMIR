LaMelo Ball led the Charlotte Hornets to a 115-104 upset win against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. The all-around brilliance by the electric point guard allowed the Hornets to snap a 10-game losing streak. Melo finished the game with 32 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and four steals.

The former Rookie of the Year made a play early in the first quarter that created a social media buzz. Ball shook off Devin Booker by faking a shot that forced the Suns star to block the attempt. Melo stepped through and hit the glass with the ball before retrieving it while on the air to pass to Brandon Miller.

Melo’s trickery wasn’t all for show. The Charlotte Hornets made a basket after Miller passed the ball to Mark Williams, who scored despite getting hammered by Mason Plumlee. The play ignited the Hornets and energized the fans.

The LaMelo Ball highlights started to turn heads when he was still playing for Chino Hills High School. He became an even bigger sensation when he joined the NBA in 2020. Ball’s showmanship and trickery were part of his Rookie of the Year winning campaign in his first year in the pros. The following year, he was selected to his first All-Star game.

The last time Ball made it to the annual event was in 2022 before ankle injuries forced him to play 58 games in two seasons. Melo has already played more games this season (24) than his 2023-24 campaign (22).

The ballots indicate how much they want to see LaMelo Ball perform his show in the 2025 NBA All-Star game.
