Jaren Jackson Jr. paired 38 points with 10 rebounds and Desmond Bane added 31 points to lead the Memphis Grizzlies to a 117-112 win over the host Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

Luke Kennard supplied 17 points and seven rebounds off the bench for Memphis, while John Konchar pulled down 12 rebounds to go with his seven points. The Grizzlies opened up a 14-point halftime advantage and held on after Phoenix closed within a point in the fourth quarter.

Kevin Durant bundled 29 points, 10 rebounds and six assists to lead the Suns, who lost Bradley Beal after the first quarter due to a hip contusion.

Beal was hurt when he landed awkwardly after being fouled by Jackson with 4:40 left in the opening frame. He played the rest of the quarter, finishing with three points and two assists, before being ruled out for the rest of the contest.

Tyus Jones contributed 21 points for Phoenix to complement 12 apiece from Mason Plumlee and Monte Morris. Devin Booker managed 16 points on just 4-of-20 shooting after missing the Suns’ last five games with a groin strain.

Jackson was active early, scoring 14 of the Grizzlies’ first first 20 points. He finished the first quarter with 19 points, helping the visitors stake a 36-26 lead.

Phoenix scored the first seven points of the second quarter as Jackson rested on the bench, but Bane stepped up and ripped the momentum back Memphis’ way, pouring in 13 second-quarter points.

The Grizzlies finished the first half on a 19-10 run and carried a 69-55 lead into the break.

The Suns rallied in the third quarter by going inside to Plumlee, who threw down four dunks to help bring Phoenix within 74-71. Bane notched nine more points in the quarter to propel Memphis into the fourth leading 91-86.

Durant’s slam on a backdoor cut sliced the Grizzlies’ lead to 96-95, but that was as close as the Suns got. Bane and Jackson each drained a three on Memphis’s next two possessions to push the lead to 102-97 with 5:55 left.

Booker’s trey made it a 108-106 game with 1:51 to go, but the Grizzlies scored the next six points to essentially close it out.
