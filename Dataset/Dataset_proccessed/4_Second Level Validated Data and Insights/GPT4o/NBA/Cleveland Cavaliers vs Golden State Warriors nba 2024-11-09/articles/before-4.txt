The Golden State Warriors offense finally hummed in the third quarter. After combining for 42 points in the first two quarters, the Dubs dropped 41 in the third period. Jonathan Kuminga, De’Anthony Melton, Steph Curry and Gary Payton II had more success putting up buckets. The visitors, however, still trailed 112-83 heading to the fourth quarter.

Steve Kerr did not insert Curry in the fourth quarter. The Warriors couldn’t put together a desperate rally as the Cavaliers had an answer to everything the Dubs threw at them. Darius Garland’s eight-point run by himself with four minutes remaining took the fight out of the Bay Area team. Cleveland won 136-117 to improve its NBA-best record to 10-0.
