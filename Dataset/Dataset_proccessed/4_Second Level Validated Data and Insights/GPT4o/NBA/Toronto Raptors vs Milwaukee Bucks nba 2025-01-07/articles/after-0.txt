Raptors starters Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and Jakob Poeltl look on as time winds down in Monday night’s loss to the Milwaukee Bucks at Scotiabank Arena.

The Raptors have all their guys back and can now see what needs to be done to shape them into some kind of cohesive unit.

Lots, it seems.

Now finally able to bury a season-long storyline, the Raptors are starting from scratch with a ton to work on following a 128-104 pasting administered by the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night at Scotiabank Arena.

It really didn’t matter who played. It was about how they played.

“We gotta do a better job, straight up,” said RJ Barrett after Toronto lost for the 13th time in 14 games. “Just not good enough.”

The worn-out narrative was that the game marked the first time Immanuel Quickley, Scottie Barnes and Barrett had played together this season, and the starting lineup of that threesome with Gradey Dick and Jakob Poeltl had only played four minutes together since February 2024.

It can now be retired and the real work, the important work, needs to start right now. And there’s lots of work to be done, starting with attitude.

“I saw the first game of the group that’s playing for the first time together this season, and we look exactly like that,” coach Darko Rajakovic said. “We were not connected. We didn’t have enough fight over the course of the game. I thought the first couple of minutes was decent. There was fight, there was intention behind it, and we were not able to sustain it. So we’ll need more sample size.”

They knew it before the game.

“I don’t want to have any kind of prejudice or expectations,”  Rajakovic had said hours before tip-off. “I just want to observe. I want to learn what this group can bring … and it’s not going to be one night. It’s not going to be one game.

“We’ll need time for those guys to start clicking.”

The three put up pretty good numbers for their first game together, and there is certainly something to work with.

Barrett had 25 points and nine rebounds; Barnes had 21 points and five assists; Quickley chipped in with 11 points and three assists.

It was, as expected, a spotty outing with just enough promise to generate some optimism for the future.

“Tonight I don’t think was about us getting used to each other; we just didn’t play hard enough,” Barrett said. “That’s top to bottom.”

But the overall team performance marked another display of lax defence that needs to be addressed.

Toronto was crushed from beyond the three-point line — outscored 66-27 — and gave up far too many easy baskets in transition.

It was a combination of scheme and effort and personnel and gives Rajakovic all kinds of fodder to work with.

“Every time we were supposed to rotate and close out to the three-point line, to break the rhythm and to take away threes, we did not do a good enough job of that,” the coach said. “So that’s something that’s an emphasis for us. That’s something that we’re working on.”

No Mitchell, Boucher

The search to find a second unit to back up the newly constituted starting group did not include Davion Mitchell or Chris Boucher.

Rajakovic said it’s going to be a process, weeding out the rotation. Jamal Shead supplanted Mitchell as a backup point guard, and Boucher couldn’t get the frontcourt minutes that went to Kelly Olynyk while the game was still in doubt. Bruce Brown, Ochai Agbaji and Ja’Kobe Walter filled out the second group.

It’s not cast in stone.

“We’ll give different players different opportunities at different times,” the coach said. “We’re going to look at certain lineups, but it doesn’t mean that those four or five players will be in lineup all the time. At some times we’ll have some guys sit out three games (and) somebody else will have the opportunity to play, so we can see what it looks like.”

Agbaji, who started 33 of Toronto’s first 35 games, was limited to 23 minutes.

“I think it’s going to be very important for him to find a little bit of chemistry with the second unit,” Rajakovic said.

“It’s going to be interesting to see how those guys start to jell together and what it brings to our team.”

Trent pays off

It didn’t work out in Toronto for then free-agent Gary Trent Jr. last summer, primarily because the Raptors needed to open up playing time for Dick and an incoming cohort of rookies.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

Trent got squeezed in a tight economic market and signed a one-year, $2.6-million (U.S.) deal with the Bucks. It was a huge financial hit — Trent made about $17 million in his last year with the Raptors — but it hasn’t changed his attitude.

“He works his butt off,” Bucks coach Doc Rivers said before Monday’s game. “He’s been a great light on our team. He’s one of those guys in the room that players love being around because he’s goofy. He does funny stuff and we love him.”

Trent started the season slowly — 1-for-18 from three-point range over a seven-game stretch — but has found his stroke of late.

He made three of five from three-point range and scored 17 points in Monday night’s win.
