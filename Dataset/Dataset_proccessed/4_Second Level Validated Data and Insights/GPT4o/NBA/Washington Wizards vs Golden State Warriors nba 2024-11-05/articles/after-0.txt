WASHINGTON — Steph Curry scored 16 of his 24 points in the second half in his return from an ankle injury and the Golden State Warriors won their fourth straight game, 125-112 over the Washington Wizards on Monday night.

The first three games of Golden State’s winning streak came without Curry, but he was able to start against the Wizards, although he played only 24:05. Curry opened the scoring with a 3-pointer, then didn’t make another field goal until his buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the first half gave the Warriors a 54-45 lead.
