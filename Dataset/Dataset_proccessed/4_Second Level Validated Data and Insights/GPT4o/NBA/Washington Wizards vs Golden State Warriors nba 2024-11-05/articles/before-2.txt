Warriors vs Wizards recap: Steph Curry’s dynamite return from injury

The Golden State Warriors notched their fourth consecutive victory and second straight on the road after beating the Washington Wizards on Monday. The matchup between the Warriors and Wizards marked the return of Steph Curry, who was out for three games due to an ankle injury.

Curry played under restricted minutes, but still came out as Golden State’s best player. Despite having a quiet start on offense, Curry popped off in the third quarter scoring 15 points in the period alone. He finished with 24 points, six assists, and three rebounds, matched with 46.7% shooting from the field.

It wasn’t his best shooting performance, but it was efficient enough to lead the Warriors to victory. Buddy Hield once again proved why he’s the second option for Golden State as he came up with an all-around performance adding 20 points, five rebounds, two steals, and one block.

Four other Warriors players were in double-scoring figures. These were namely Draymond Green (18 points), Jonathan Kuminga (15 points), Trayce Jackson-Davis (12 points), and Moses Moody (10 points).
