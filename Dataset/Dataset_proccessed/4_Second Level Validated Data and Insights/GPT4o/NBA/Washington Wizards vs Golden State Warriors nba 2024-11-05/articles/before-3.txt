WASHINGTON (AP) — Stephen Curry scored 16 of his 24 points in the second half in his return from an ankle injury and the Golden State Warriors won their fourth straight game, 125-112 over the Washington Wizards on Monday night.

The first three games of Golden State's winning streak came without Curry, but he was able to start against the Wizards, although he played only 24:05. Curry opened the scoring with a 3-pointer, then didn't make another field goal until his buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the first half gave the Warriors a 54-45 lead.

Buddy Hield scored 20 points, part of another strong contribution from the Golden State bench. The Warriors' reserves outscored Washington's 60-33. Golden State has averaged an edge of 24 points per game in bench points so far this season.

Jordan Poole led Washington with 24 points Kyle Kuzma (right groin strain) missed his third straight game for the Wizards, and Marvin Bagley III (illness) also sat out.

Takeaways

Warriors: Golden State used 13 players. Twelve of them played between 13:06 and 28:53. Although the Warriors have shown off their depth, Curry's return gives them a true star to lean on.

Wizards: Washington was competitive despite shooting just 23% from 3-point range. Kyshawn George had 20 points. He was 6 of 17 from beyond the arc.
