        "The Heat were inbounding the ball down three points with just under five seconds remaining on the clock. Jimmy Butler passed the ball in to Terry Rozier, who was immediately double-teamed by Royce O'Neale and Devin Booker. This forced Rozier's pass back to Butler to sail inside the three-point line, meaning he was forced to retreat dribble. He began his shooting motion a second left on the clock but was forced to pivot out into a pass to Tyler Herro due to the air-born defender in front of him. Time ran out once Herro caught the ball, leaving them without a game-tying shot.",
        "Tyler Herro concluded with 28 points, six assists, and three rebounds on 9 of 15 shooting against the Suns.",
        "Haywood Highsmith recorded 19 points, seven rebounds, and two steals on 7 of 8 shooting."
