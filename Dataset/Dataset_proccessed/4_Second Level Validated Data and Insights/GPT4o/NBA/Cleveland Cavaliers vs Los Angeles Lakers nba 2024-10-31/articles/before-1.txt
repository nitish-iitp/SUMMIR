The NBA is back, and FanDuel Sportsbook has plenty of ways to get in on the action. To celebrate a loaded Wednesday slate, FanDuel Sportsbook has a special promotion for ALL customers.

All customers get TWO Profit Boost Tokens (each 50%; one for a 3+ leg SGP/SGP+ and one for a 2+ leg "To Record a Double-Double" SGP/SGP+/Parlay wager) for NBA games taking place on October 30th, 2024!

Wednesday's slate tips off at 7:10pm ET when the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Cleveland Cavaliers. Both sides have enjoyed strong starts to the season, with the Lakers sitting at 3-1 and the Cavaliers undefeated at 4-0. Though this is a homecoming for LeBron James and Bronny James, Cleveland is a 4.5-point favorite as of Wednesday morning. The total is set at 225 points.

Full Lakers-Cavaliers odds can be found below.

Then, at 7:30pm ET, the New York Knicks head south to take on the Miami Heat. Both sides feature capable big men tonight, with New York's Karl-Anthony Towns notching a double-double in two of three games to start the season. For the home side, center Bam Adebayo has recorded consecutive double-doubles after a quiet season opener. KAT has -130 odds to record a double-double, while Bam has +130 odds to reach that threshold.
