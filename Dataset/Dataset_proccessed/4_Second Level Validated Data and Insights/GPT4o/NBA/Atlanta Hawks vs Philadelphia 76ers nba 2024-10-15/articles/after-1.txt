A day removed from the injury Sixers star Paul George suffered against the Atlanta Hawks, an update has been provided on the specifics of the injury.

After the team’s Tuesday practice, Sixers head coach Nick Nurse addressed the media, speaking on several topics, including a medical update on Paul George.

“PG was here today, got it looked at again. Everything checks out okay. They are going to do some further imaging this afternoon to see if there’s anything else, but [he’s in] good spirits, [he] was here today. [A] number of the vets didn’t practice today, coming in off a late night. But okay, for now. We’ll see what happens with the imaging.”

Nurse was then asked about a shelf time for George and when he could return.

“I don’t have any anything on anything like that until they get that part done. I mean, obviously he won’t play tomorrow night, but he was never going to play tomorrow night anyway. So, as with a number of our guys [who] won’t play tomorrow night, as [it was] always on the schedule that way. So have to wait to see.”

Later that day, the Sixers released an additional update on George to the media, which included the results of the imaging of his knee.

“An MRI completed today showed a bone bruise and no structural damage to Paul George’s left knee. He will be re-evaluated in approximately one week.”

With the news now that it is simply a bone bruise and not a strain or tear, a sigh of relief can certainly be had. There is no exact timetable for a return, but his reevaluation next week should clarify the timeframe. For now, this news should be considered a win.
