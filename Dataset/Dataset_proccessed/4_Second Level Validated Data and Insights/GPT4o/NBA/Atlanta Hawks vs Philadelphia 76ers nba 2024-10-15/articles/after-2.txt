Problems escalate for Sixers doomed to failure: Paul George injury

A few days ago it was confirmed that Joel Embiid would not play in the preseason, and now PG falls: he has never reached the ring from the nursing home

Paul George, star of the Philadelphia 76ers.

The 2024/25 season of the Philadelphia 76ers is surrounded by uncertainties due to the physical unreliability of their stars, Paul George and Joel Embiid. And, of course, that makes winning a championship difficult.

Recently, Paul George suffered a hyperextension in his left knee during the second quarter of a preseason game against the Atlanta Hawks. The incident occurred while defending against Jalen Johnson, and his left leg bent in a strange way. George immediately left the game and did not return to the court. The 76ers' coach, Nick Nurse, expressed hope that George will recover soon, saying: "Hopefully, he'll be okay, so he'll be back with us right away."

George, who joined the 76ers this season after signing a maximum four-year contract, tried to downplay the severity of the injury, saying: "I felt it hyperextend, and immediately I knew I had to come out, but if you ask me, I'm not too worried about it." However, the fact that he had to leave the game raises concern, especially because George has dealt with health issues throughout his career.

This concern is compounded by Joel Embiid, who has been ruled out for the remainder of the preseason due to a knee injury. The 76ers are being cautious with Embiid, who is coming off a season in which he played only 39 games due to issues with his left knee. Furthermore, his injury history is extensive: he has missed 204 games in the last eight seasons and sat out his first two NBA seasons due to foot injuries.

Is Nick Nurse a coach or doctor?

The President of Basketball Operations for the 76ers, Daryl Morey, had previously warned that both George and Embiid will not play many consecutive games this season, if they play at all. This reflects the team's need to manage the health of their stars, while also underscoring the challenge this poses for a team aiming to be competitive.
