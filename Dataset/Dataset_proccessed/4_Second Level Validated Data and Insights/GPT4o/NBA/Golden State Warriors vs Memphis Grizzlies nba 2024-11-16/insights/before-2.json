        "Stephen Curry had 13 points, eight rebounds, five assists and four steals in 26 minutes of the Warriors' 123-118 NBA Cup victory over the Memphis Grizzlies at Chase Center on Friday. Curry's four steals tied a season-high and he was able to rest the entire fourth quarter due to the team's 15-point lead after three quarters. He attempted just nine shots and three of his four made field goals were 3-pointers. The other was a heavily contested baseline jumper right before halftime."
