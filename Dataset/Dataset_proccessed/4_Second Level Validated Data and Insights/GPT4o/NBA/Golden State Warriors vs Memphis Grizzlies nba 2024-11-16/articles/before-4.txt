Warriors Shooting Advantage the Difference in NBA Cup Win Over Grizzlies
Warriors Make 19 3-Pointers, Outscore Grizzlies by 36 Points From Behind the Arc
Kalyb Champion

The Warriors had six players in double figures, paced by Buddy Hield's 18 points and four 3-pointers in their 123-118 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies at Chase Center on Friday. The Warriors outscored the Grizzlies by 36 points from behind the arc, making 19 3-pointers at a 41.3 percent clip compared to just seven made threes and 16.7 percent from three for Memphis. The Dubs are now 2-0 atop the West Group C standings in the Emirates NBA Cup, carrying a point differential of plus-eight.

SHOOTING GUARD BY COMMITTEE
Lindy Waters III started in place of injured guard De'Anthony Melton and scored the Warriors' first five points, opening with a 3-pointer and a long 2-pointer. Waters scored eight points on 3-for-4 shooting in 11 first-half minutes. Unfortunately, he suffered a left knee hyperextension late in the second quarter, which sidelined him for the remainder of the game. Brandin Podziemski started in his place to begin the second half and had a productive all-around game with nine points, seven rebounds and five assists. In his typical sixth-man role, Buddy Hield led all scorers with 18 points and four 3-pointers.

PODZ'S SPECTACULAR DIME
A couple of minutes into the second quarter, Podziemski saved a loose ball in front of the Warriors' bench and, in one fluid motion, threw a behind-the-back pass that hit Jonathan Kuminga in stride for a two-hand slam. Podziemski had his back to Kuminga, who was nearly parallel to him at the release of the pass, but the athletic wing sprinted up the court and caught up with the perfectly placed ball in the paint. 

END-OF-QUARTER BUCKETS
Stephen Curry danced with the basketball around the 3-point line in the waning seconds of the first half. Then, he made his move with a left-to-right crossover and penetrated just outside the restricted area. Rim-protecting big Jaren Jackson Jr. came over to help, forcing Curry into a high arching fadeaway from the baseline, which he sank with 1.1 second remaining. Curry's shot gave the Warriors a seven-point lead at halftime.

In a similar situation, with the shot clock off and nearing the end of the third quarter, Kyle Anderson found Buddy Hield well beyond the 3-point line. Hield gave a quick jab step before firing and swishing a 28-foot trey over former Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart. Hield's shot extended the Warrior lead to 15 and capped a 38-point quarter. 

GREEN'S SHARPSHOOTING
Draymond Green headed into Friday's game amidst the best perimeter shooting season of his career, at a blistering 45.7 percent from three. He set his previous career-high (39.5%) last season. Green shot 3-for-7 from deep against the Grizzlies, marking his third game with three treys this season. Green scored 13 points with eight rebounds and seven assists.
