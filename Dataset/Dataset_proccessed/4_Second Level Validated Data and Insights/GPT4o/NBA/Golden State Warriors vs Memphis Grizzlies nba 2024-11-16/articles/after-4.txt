Warriors really getting on the officials late in an otherwise clean win over the Grizzlies. Technical on Steve Kerr and two on Draymond Green. Ejection from the bench, where he was about to ride out the final seconds of the win anyway. – 12:41 AM
Kendra Andrews @kendra__andrews
Draymond Green just got tossed with 1:14 left in the game after picking up his second technical. He picked up his first 30 seconds prior. – 12:41 AM
Tony Jones @Tjonesonthenba
Ok JJ Redick is a great coach. Knew he had this in his pocket all game. Waited until the two most important possessions to make Zach Edey have to defend double staggers and they get a LeBron dunk and wide open AD three out of it – 12:25 AM

Zach Edey is more than holding his own against Anthony Davis. That’s one very big ass rookie they got in Memphis. AK – 11:37 PM
More on this storyline

“I was so thrilled when Draymond said that the other day,” Atkinson said. “He was just really impressed how we pinged the ball around. How we drive, kick, swing. We get it out of pick-and-roll. We get it in fast-break situations, and it is Warriors-esque. It’s really that type of ball movement. It’s beautiful to watch.” Atkinson isn’t letting his team be satisfied, either. After the Cavs allowed 73 points in the first half, the coach angrily slammed a shower sandal in the locker room at halftime. “That’s what we want,” Mitchell said. “We all prefer that. We hear how good we are. For us, that’s how we get better. We haven’t lost, but how do you continue to find ways to build habits? It’s continuing to coach hard and not let any lapses. That’s what you want in a coach.” -via ESPN / November 16, 2024
Once again, the “code” word has come up in a game between the Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins took exception to a Draymond Green transition take foul on Zach Edey with 7:06 remaining in the third quarter of Golden State’s 123-118 win over Memphis on Friday night. “Overall, thought he was really good,” Jenkins said of Edey, who had 14 points and nine rebounds. “And very disappointing, there was that one play, we were about to start the break and he’s been playing really hard to try to outlet, and Draymond grabs his leg and pulls him down and it doesn’t get reviewed. “So I know there’s a code in this league, and I don’t understand how that wasn’t reviewed. Very disappointing.” -via ESPN / November 16, 2024
Green lost the ball as he was driving around Jaren Jackson Jr. and fell into the paint at Edey’s feet. Edey picked up the ball for a steal and immediately threw an outlet pass for a Grizzlies break. Green’s left elbow got tangled with Edey’s right foot, and the Grizzlies rookie center tripped over Green’s sprawled out left leg. “It definitely wasn’t a basketball play,” Edey said after the game. Neither team loved the officiating. Golden State coach Steve Kerr got heated with officials at the end of the game, and Green was ejected for receiving two technical fouls within 33 seconds in the final two minutes. -via ESPN / November 16, 2024
The reason: the difference between the Grizzlies’ strong interest in Edey and league-wide skepticism about his potential. Before and after the draft, Edey fielded scrutiny on whether he could excel in the NBA. After dominating at Purdue as a traditional center with post-up presence (18.2 points per game), rebounding (9.6) and rim protection (1.7 blocks), Edey elicited concerns on other issues. Could he thrive in a league that puts higher premium on mobile bigs that can make 3s, space the floor and run fast? The Grizzlies believed so. -via athlonsports.com / November 15, 2024
