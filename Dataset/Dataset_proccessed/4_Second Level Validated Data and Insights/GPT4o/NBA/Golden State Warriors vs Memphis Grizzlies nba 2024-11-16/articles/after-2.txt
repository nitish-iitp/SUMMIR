Draymond Green's (GSW) foul against Zach Edey (MEM) at 7:06 of 3rd qtr on 11/15/24 has been upgraded to a Flagrant 1 after league review. <a href="https://t.co/bX7YS8MaV4">https://t.co/bX7YS8MaV4</a>

In the third quarter of the Golden State Warriors' 123-118 win over the Grizzlies on Friday night, Green fell to the ground and turned the ball over before he appeared to hook Edey's right leg with his arm, causing the center to fall down.

"It definitely wasn't a basketball play," Edey said after the game, per ESPN's Ohm Youngmisuk.

The play was initially ruled a transition take foul before it was upgraded to a flagrant penalty on Saturday.

Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins was pleased with Edey's performance and expressed confusion about why the play wasn't reviewed by officials immediately after it occurred.

"Overall, thought he was really good," Jenkins said, via Youngmisuk. "And very disappointing, there was that one play, we were about to start the break and he's been playing really hard to try to outlet, and Draymond grabs his leg and pulls him down and it doesn't get reviewed."

"So I know there's a code in this league, and I don't understand how that wasn't reviewed," he added.

Edey scored 14 points and pulled down nine rebounds in just 23 minutes off the bench. He recorded a block and a steal, shooting 5-8 from the floor and connecting on both of his three-point attempts.

Green finished with 13 points, eight rebounds and seven assists while shooting 5-11 from the field and hitting three of his seven attempts from behind the arc. He didn't close out the game, as he was ejected after picking up his second technical foul with roughly 30 seconds left in regulation.
