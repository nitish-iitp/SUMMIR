Zion Williamson #1 of the New Orleans Pelicans drives to the basket during preseason as Dejounte Murray looks on.
Pelicans shootaround update: Dejounte Murray discusses return of Zion Williamson
Power forward will play vs. Minnesota tonight, his first game since Nov. 6

New Orleans media and fans spent much of the 2024 offseason wondering what impact a starting point guard like Dejounte Murray might have on two-time All-Star forward Zion Williamson, but the pairing had not been in place through the first 36 games of the regular season. That changes tonight, with Williamson's status updated to available to play Tuesday vs. Minnesota (7 p.m., GCSEN on TV, WWL on radio). Williamson has been sidelined since Nov. 6 due to a left hamstring strain; his only game experience alongside Murray occurred during New Orleans’ first two preseason contests.

“It will help a lot,” Murray said at Tuesday’s morning shootaround of Williamson’s return to uniform. “That’s a guy teams are going to load up on. He’s going to be able to get guys (open) shots and allow that to open things up for himself. We don’t want him to feel like he has to come save the world. Get in a rhythm and flow of things.”

Murray, himself an All-Star in 2022, said he’s pleased to see Williamson reap the rewards of going through the process of recovering from an injury. That’s something Murray also experienced after breaking his left hand during the Oct. 23 season opener vs. Chicago. Murray was out for more than a month, back on the floor Nov. 27 vs. Toronto.

“I’m just happy for the individual,” Murray said of Williamson. “I know it’s tough being out, having to rehab and do the same things over and over. We get paid to play basketball. We don’t get paid to be hurt… I think he’s excited to play. We’re excited to add him back to the team.”

Other notes from shootaround:

Murray on CJ McCollum, who’s been one of the NBA’s best scorers and perimeter shooters over the past five games, highlighted by a 50-point game Friday vs. Washington: “I’ve always been a fan of CJ. He’s the ultimate pro. He handles his business, takes care of his body and he’s just a great guy to be around all-around. I’ve had love and respect for him (since) back when he was in Portland. Obviously it made my transition easier when I got here in New Orleans.” …

In the midst of a stretch of nine straight games of shooting under 50 percent from the field, Murray has picked up his performance in other areas, including posting 24 assists and just five turnovers in the pair of wins over the Wizards.

“I feel like I play the game the right way,” Murray said. “Obviously I’m not scoring the ball the way I want to, but I will be better at that. But it’s not about just scoring. One thing fans, players, coaches around this league know about Dejounte, is that if shots are not going in, I’m making other guys’ jobs easier, I’m playing defense, I’m rebounding, being vocal. You don’t want to be that player where offense determines how (well) you play.”

Minnesota Scouting Report

Offensive efficiency (rank): 111.1 (21)

Defensive efficiency (rank): 110.0 (8)

Net rating (rank): +1.1 (14)

Streak: Won 1

Go-to guy: Anthony Edwards scored a career-high 53 points in a Saturday loss at Detroit, then followed that up with 37 Monday in a win over the Clippers. The two-time All-Star is averaging 25.6 ppg and making 4.2 treys per game.

On the rise: Last season’s Sixth Man of the Year winner, LSU product Naz Reid is Minnesota’s third-leading scorer at 12.7 ppg and fourth-leading rebounder (5.0 rpg), again coming off the bench in every game. He’s appeared in all 35 Wolves contests.

In the clutch: Edwards is tied for second in the NBA in clutch points (70), trailing only Nikola Jokic (76). Edwards added to his timely tally Monday with crucial late-game baskets to beat the Clippers. Minnesota is 11-12 in clutch games this season.

Three-point attack: The Wolves are an elite perimeter shooting squad, ranking in the top six in all major categories, including fifth in three-point makes (15.1 per game) and third in percentage (37.9).

Previous Game Starting Lineups

MINNESOTA (18-17)

Monday win vs. LA Clippers

Donte DiVincenzo, Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, Julius Randle, Rudy Gobert

Notes: The Timberwolves have enjoyed enviable lineup continuity this season, with four starters appearing in all 35 games. In addition, Mike Conley Jr. has started 30 times. Conley came off the bench Monday. … As a result of Minnesota sustaining so few injuries, Chris Finch has only used three different starting lineups. The most common is 17-13 and features Conley, Edwards, McDaniels, Randle and Gobert.

NEW ORLEANS (7-29)

Sunday win at Washington

Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones, Trey Murphy, Yves Missi

Notes: The Pelicans were forced to constantly juggle their starting lineup through most of the first two months of the regular season, but have now relied on the same combination for 12 straight games. Unfortunately that streak will come to an end Tuesday, because Murphy has already been ruled out due to a left ankle sprain, the same status for Brandon Ingram. … As a result of numerous injuries, Willie Green has used 17 different starting lineups.
