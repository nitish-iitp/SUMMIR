After the game, Doncic was honest about how it can take time to develop chemistry with a new player like Thompson (h/t NBA TV).

Doncic: "I think we're still trying to figure it out. It's not easy to connect with a guy right away. Me and Ky, we needed some time to connect. Now we have all three on the squad. Obviously, we're gonna need some more time, but it's getting easier and easier."
