Trae Young hit a half-court 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Atlanta Hawks a 124-121 win over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday in Salt Lake City.

The Jazz tied the game with four seconds left on a 24-foot trey by Collin Sexton. Atlanta, which had no timeouts remaining, inbounded the ball to Young, who cashed in on his heave from midcourt. The shot was reviewed and ruled good.

Young finished with 24 points -- 10 in the fourth quarter -- and 20 assists to help Atlanta end a three-game losing streak. The Hawks also got 18 points, six rebounds and three blocks from Clint Capela and 17 points from De'Andre Hunter.

Utah was led by Lauri Markkanen, who matched his season high with 35 points. Sexton added 24 points, and Walker Kessler had 21 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks. The Jazz fell to 2-13 at home on the season.

Atlanta rolled to a 31-17 start before the Jazz began knocking down 3-pointers -- two by Markkanen and three by Patty Mills -- to cut the Hawks' lead to 36-32 after one quarter.

The Jazz got as close as 38-34, but the Hawks went on a 12-0 run for a 16-point lead with 7:58 left in the second. But Markkanen got hot, scoring 15 points in the quarter, helping trim Atlanta's lead to 65-62 at intermission.

Kessler kept the Jazz in the game by scoring 10 straight Utah points in the fourth quarter, including two on a tip-in with 1:33 left that trimmed Atlanta's lead to 119-118. Young later made two free throws to give the Hawks a three-point lead with 8.8 seconds left.

The Hawks played without second-leading scorer Jalen Johnson (right shoulder inflammation) for the second straight game. The Jazz were without former Hawks forward John Collins (personal reasons), Keyonte George (left heel) and Brice Sensabaugh, who scored a combined 61 points in the past two games, because of an illness.
