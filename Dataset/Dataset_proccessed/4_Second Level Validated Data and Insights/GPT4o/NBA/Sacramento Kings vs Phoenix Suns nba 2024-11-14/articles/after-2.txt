Aside from Malik Monk, the Sacramento Kings bench has been underwhelming to start the 2024-25 NBA season. However, with his recent unavailability due to an ankle injury, head coach Mike Brown has had no choice but to go deeper into his bench.

DeMar DeRozan became unavailable after halftime due to lower back tightness, so they needed more from the reserves. Trey Lyles, Jordan McLaughlin, and Keon Ellis stepped up.

In Nov. 13th 127-104 win over the Phoenix Suns

Jordan McLaughlin: 11 points, one assist, one rebound, one steal on 4/6 FG, 1/2 3P
Trey Lyles: 13 points, five rebounds, three assists on 5/7 FG, 3/5 3P
Keon Ellis: Nine points, two rebounds, two blocks on 4/5 FG, 1/1 3P

Lyles hadn’t been himself to start the season, averaging just 4.0 points and 3.2 rebounds on 28.0 percent from the field and 24.3 percent from three in his 15.9 minutes over 11 games. With the injuries mentioned above becoming a reality, they needed him to return to form, and he responded when called upon.

“You can see (Lyles), see his confidence come back, and we’re going to need him,” Kevin Huerter said after Thursday’s practice.

“He’s a really good player and can really shoot the ball, and that wasn’t him to start the season. I think he’s another one of those guys that we knew was going to come back, and we knew the floodgates were going to open at some point. So, it’s good to see him taking transition threes and a couple of shots he might not have looked at a couple of games ago and shooting with confidence. We trust he can make those. He can make shots at a high level.”

It may have been a rough spell for Lyles, but he seems on an upward trajectory at a time when the team needs him. Hopefully, that trend continues.

McLaughlin has been a bit of a different story. The six-foot guard spent his first five seasons in the NBA with the Minnesota Timberwolves, who the Kings play on Friday in their first In-Season Tournament game, before signing with Sacramento this offseason.

His role has been limited, including three DNP-CD and six instances of six minutes or less in 11 games leading up to Wednesday’s matchup with the Phoenix Suns. Given the logjam of guards on the roster, there wasn’t room for him to play nightly. Now, they needed him.

One of Coach Brown and Jay Triano’s five offensive staples is playing with pace. McLaughlin’s speed and ball handling play into that well. When Brown was asked about his fit into that style, he said, “really well.”

“(McLaughlin) is another ball handler. He’s really good in terms of getting up and down with the ball and to help us play faster. Trying to throw him out there, in my opinion, only good things can happen,” Coach Brown continued.

“Because that’s what we do, especially when Fox is off the floor, so that speed or that pace does not take a hit. I’m happy that he played well last night because it shows everybody that really he deserves an opportunity to be out on the floor. And Keon (Ellis) deserves an opportunity to be out on the floor. And that’s what my dilemma is. Sometimes, it may be Keon; sometimes, it may be Jordan. Sometimes, it could be Doug (McDermott) because he’s just shooting the mess out of the ball, and the gravity is big time on the offensive end of the floor. So you’ve just got to continue to try to get a feel, and everybody just has to stay ready, but Jordan did a fantastic job getting downhill, making the right decisions, and showing he is quick with the basketball.”

Brown has been transparent in his active search for the right formula for his rotation this season. It’s still a work in progress, but Lyles’s return to life and McLaughlin’s prowess in limited minutes are both encouraging.

With DeRozan’s status in question and Monk still sidelined for a couple more weeks, the Kings will need their bench to continue to step up for their upcoming In-Season Tournament matchups.

When is the next Sacramento Kings game?

Sacramento will begin the group play portion of the NBA Cup (In-Season Tournament) on Friday night at Golden 1 Center against Anthony Edwards and the Minnesota Timberwolves.

The Kings will play four group play games before the tournament enters the knockout stage on December 10th.
