Zach Edey debuted on Wednesday for the Memphis Grizzlies against the Utah Jazz. The 7-foot-4 center had an intriguing matchup with Jazz big man Walker Kessler to open the game. Edey’s first two points came off a putback following a Ja Morant miss. He couldn’t convert the bonus free throw but showed early his impact on the game.

Edey played five minutes in the first quarter but returned with 9:44 in the second period for Jay Huff. The former Purdue superstar struggled to make his presence felt on the floor during his short second-quarter run. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins took him out roughly three minutes after putting him back in.

Despite Edey's limited contribution, the Grizzlies led 61-50 at halftime.

Zach Edey started in the third and fourth quarters but hardly got himself going. He finished with five points and five rebounds after fouling out with still 9:15 remaining in the final period. It was a forgettable debut for Edey in the Memphis Grizzlies' 126-124 win over the Utah Jazz.

Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins preferred Santi Aldama over Zach Edey for long stretches

Coach Taylor Jenkins loved Steven Adams, the Memphis Grizzlies' former center before Adams was traded to the Houston Rockets. When the Kiwi was healthy, he was a staple in the starting lineup and averaged 26.5 minutes per game during his stint with the Grizzlies. Many thought Zach Edey would promptly take over that spot in his rookie year.

Jenkins, though, preferred to go to Santi Aldama instead of the hulking Edey for long stretches on Wednesday. The Spaniard isn’t nearly the rim protector as the rookie, but the veteran can shoot well from deep. Aldama's floor-spacing game helps Ja Morant thrive in the paint.

Aldama finished the game with 27 points on 10-for-16 shooting, including 5-for-10 from deep. Grizzlies fans will be interested to see if Edey will go to the bench once Jaren Jackson Jr. returns from injury. Taylor Jenkins could go with an Aldama-JJJ pairing to start games.
