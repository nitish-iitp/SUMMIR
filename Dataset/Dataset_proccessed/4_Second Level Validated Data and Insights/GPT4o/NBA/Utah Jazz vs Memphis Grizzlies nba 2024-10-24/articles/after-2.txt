Zach Edey won’t win Rookie of the Year from the bench.

The overwhelming favorite to win the award spent most of his NBA debut on the sidelines as he fouled out after just 15 minutes of action in the Grizzlies’ 126-124 win over the Jazz on Wednesday night.

Edey, who started, scored his first two career points on a tip-in while being fouled. However, he then picked up two quick fouls and another in the second quarter after returning to the game.

He eventually fouled out with five points and five rebounds on a loose ball foul with 9:15 left and the Grizzlies leading, 102-91.

“It’s obviously going to be a different type of level, but it’s still basketball,” Edey told the Memphis Commercial-Appeal before the game. “It’s the sport I’ve played.”

Edey was the two-time player of the year at Purdue, though some questioned whether a 7-foot-4 player with limited mobility and shooting range would translate to the NBA.

Edey, who was picked at No. 9 by Memphis in the draft, was able to dispel some of those doubts with an impressive preseason that included a 23-point, nine-rebound performance against the Pacers.

“I think he’s been very solid,” teammate Desmond Bane told the paper. “For a rookie to be able to come in and impact games this early in the preseason and this early in the season, it’s crazy.

“We haven’t had many rookies who have done that, and he’s only going to continue to get better.”

The Grizzlies withstood a late Utah charge to pick up the season-opening road win with Edey’s backup, Jay Huff, contributing 13 points and five rebounds.

It also marked the return of star guard Ja Morant, who is coming off a season that started with a 25-game suspension for brandishing a gun on a friend’s Instagram account and ended after playing nine games due to a shoulder injury.

“I was just excited to be back out there,” said Morant, who dropped 22 points and 10 assists. “These guys trust and believe in me every time I’m out there on the floor, so it’s only right I go out there and play free.”
