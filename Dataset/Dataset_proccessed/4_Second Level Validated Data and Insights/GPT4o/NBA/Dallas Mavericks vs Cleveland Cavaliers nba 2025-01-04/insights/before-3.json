        "Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night. This is a spot to back Kyrie against his former team.",
        "Kyrie has led the Mavericks in the absence of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 recently and is averaging 25.1 points per game without him this season.",
        "Kyrie also seems to get up against the team that drafted him. Over the past few seasons he has averaged 28.2 points per game against the Cavaliers and has exceeded this 26.5 points line in four of five games, including three straight where he scored more than 30.",
        "The Cavaliers have been susceptible to opponent point guard scoring. They have given up big games to Austin Reaves, Jamal Murray, Collin Sexton, and Tyrese Maxey."
