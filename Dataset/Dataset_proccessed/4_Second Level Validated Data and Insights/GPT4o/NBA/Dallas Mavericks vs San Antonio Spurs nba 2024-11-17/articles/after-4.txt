OKLAHOMA CITY — The Dallas Mavericks will be without Luka Doncic for a matchup against one of the league’s top teams.

The Mavericks listed Doncic as out for Sunday night’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder with a right knee contusion. Dallas’ road trip to Oklahoma City is the second game of a back-to-back, closing out a busy weekend that included a 110-93 win over the San Antonio Spurs.

Doncic cautiously admitted he was “a little less” than 100% when asked about his health status following Saturday’s lopsided win over the Spurs.

“It’s probably a matter of time,” Doncic said in response to how long it’ll take him to feel like himself again. “It’s not a lot of time to rest. But I’ll get better for sure. I promise.”

Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said the team will assess how Doncic feels on Monday before declaring his status for Tuesday’s NBA Cup game against the New Orleans Pelicans.

Sunday’s game will mark Doncic’s first absence of the regular season. He missed all four games of the preseason with a left groin strain sustained before the start of the Mavericks’ weeklong training camp in Las Vegas. Doncic also suffered a left groin strain in a loss to the Phoenix Suns on Nov. 8.

Doncic played only 28 minutes against San Antonio on Saturday night, posting 16 points, six rebounds and six assists. He winced on several occasions throughout the game, a signal that he was playing through discomfort. He checked out of the game for the final time with 8:43 left on the clock.

Dante Exum (right wrist surgery) and Jazian Gortman (G League-two-way) were also listed as out against the Thunder.

Mavericks star Kyrie Irving is expected to shoulder more of the offensive burden in Doncic’s absence. He’s the team’s second-leading scorer with 24.9 points, along with 4.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.

Kidd said he expects the pace to be faster with Irving slotted as the primary point guard as opposed to Doncic.

“Yeah. I think it will probably be quicker,” he said. “Not with just with Kai labeled as the point guard. Kai is the one who plays off the ball...We’re probably going to play faster tonight.”
