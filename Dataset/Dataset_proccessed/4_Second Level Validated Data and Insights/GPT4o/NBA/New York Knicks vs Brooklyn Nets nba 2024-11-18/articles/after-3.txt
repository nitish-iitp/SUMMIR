After 13 games, the Knicks find themselves in fourth place in the East with a 7-6 record. Though the team hasn’t looked the part of championship contenders, there’s been some positive signs early on. Let’s take a look at where the club has excelled and where there is room for improvement...

Strengths
Efficient shooting

New York’s offense has been a positive story. The Knicks are third in the NBA in offensive efficiency, scoring 119.7 points per 100 possessions. Key factors for the ranking have been how well the Knicks have shot overall. New York is seventh in three-point percentage (37.8), fifth in free-throw shooting (80.8 percent) and second in true shooting percentage (60.2).

1-2 punch

The combination of Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns gives the Knicks two consistent options to go to throughout the course of a game. Towns is on pace for arguably his best offensive season, with a team-high 26.4 points on 54.2 percent shooting from the field. Brunson has performed below his high standard but has still been effective, averaging 24.3 points and 6.8 assists. In close games, having two All-Star caliber players to go to is crucial and we’ve seen it help in situations like Brunson’s game-winner on Friday night against the Brooklyn Nets.

Passing potential

In the Tom Thibodeau era, the Knicks have never finished higher than 24th in assist rate. This season, New York could crack the top half of the NBA in the category. The Knicks are 17th in assist rate and they’ve recorded at least 30 assists in four of the last six games.

The Knicks had 33 helpers in their Sunday night 114-104 win against the Nets. With proper spacing, the Knicks have been able to drive and kick and make plays. Equally important, the Knicks have the fifth lowest turnover rate despite the improved passing.

Weaknesses
Lack of depth

Just a couple of years ago, the Knicks were one of the deepest teams in the NBA. Now, in building out its starting lineup, New York has lost some depth. The Knicks are last in the NBA in bench scoring. Centers Mitchell Robinson and Precious Achiuwa have yet to play this season due to injury, and when they return it will add to a thin bench that is relying heavily on guards Miles McBride and Cameron Payne.

Starters Mikal Bridges, Josh Hart and OG Anunoby are all in the top ten in minutes per game. The Knicks will need more impact off the bench so they don’t run the starters ragged.

Defensive adjustments

When the Knicks traded for Towns, it was clear the defense would take a step back. The question was how big of a step back it would be. The Knicks are 21st in defensive efficiency, giving up 115.5 points per 100 possessions.

Three-point defense has been a struggle. Through the first 12 games, the Knicks were giving up 40.8 three-point attempts per 100 possessions, second in the NBA according to Basketball Reference. Opponents are shooting 36 percent from three, which is 12th in the NBA. New York’s point of attack defense guarding the pick and roll will need to be better to contain the drive and kick game.

Shot profile

Since becoming the head coach, Thibodeau has focused on modernizing the team’s shot diet. That means upping three-point attempts. Though New York has shot well from three, the club is just 17th in three-point attempts per 100 possessions (36.3). Last season, the Knicks were ninth in three-point attempts per 100 possessions.

Instead of threes, the Knicks are taking more midrange attempts. The club is third in percentage of points that come from the midrange, per NBA Stats. The main culprit is Bridges, who is leaning heavily on mid range pull-ups. In fact, 21.4 percent of his points have come from shots in the mid range.
