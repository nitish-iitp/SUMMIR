LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS
Harden Admits He Won't Catch Steph's Record: 'He Can Shoot the S--t Out of the Ball'
JOSEPH ZUCKER
NOVEMBER 18, 2024

B/R

Los Angeles Clippers star James Harden is admitting defeat in any quest to claim the NBA's all-time three-point record.

Harden moved into the No. 2 spot on the career threes list ahead of Ray Allen in Sunday's 116-105 win over the Utah Jazz. Unfortunately for the 10-time All-Star, he needs to hit 807 long-range jumpers to overtake Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry.

After the game, Harden reflected on his achievement and shouted out some of his teammates who helped him get here:

James Harden speaks on passing Ray Allen and also shouts out Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook for creating an example for him in OKC that helped him become great. <br><br>Harden: "They set the blueprint. When I got there they had the blueprint of how to work… So all I did was just… <a href="https://t.co/wEde8tIctY">pic.twitter.com/wEde8tIctY</a>

When it comes to chasing down Curry, he's already waving the white flag. He believes the record may stand the test of time because the two-time MVP "can shoot the s--t out of the ball."

Joey Linn
@joeylinn_

Can James Harden pass Steph Curry in three-pointers?<br><br>Harden: "I'm one of the most confident guys that we have in this league. But no. I probably won't catch Steph. I don't think anybody will… He can shoot the shit outta the ball." <a href="https://t.co/hqExBDk0BV">pic.twitter.com/hqExBDk0BV</a>

To provide some context on the gap between Curry and Harden, 402 made threes is the single-season record, set by the former in 2015-16. So Harden would need to have two years at a record-setting pace just to get there, which also hinges on Curry not adding to his career total.

There was a time when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's all-time scoring record looked equally untouchable. Surely no player could maintain the kind of longevity required to pass the legendary center.

Then LeBron James made it happen.

There's no question Curry has significantly influenced modern NBA offenses, but we're only starting to see the way in which he has shaped how younger generations play the game. There might come a time when a serious challenger to the Warriors guard emerges.
