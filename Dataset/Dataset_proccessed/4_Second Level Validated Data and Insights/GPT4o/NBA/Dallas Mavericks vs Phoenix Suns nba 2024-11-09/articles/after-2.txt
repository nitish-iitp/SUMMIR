Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd hit out at their bench for failing to show up in their home game on Friday as they went on to lose by one point, 114-113, to the Phoenix Suns. He said the lack of bench support did not help their cause and that it has to change if they are to achieve their goals this season.

He made sure he got his strong message across during the postgame press conference of their tough loss to the Suns. He highlighted how a more spirited participation from their bench would have gone a long way in their game against their conference rivals.

As shared by Dallas-area journalist Noah Weber on X (formerly Twitter), a disappointed Jason Kidd said:

"For whatever reason, we're getting off to a slow start, it's gotta be addressed... Somebody's gotta come with some f***ing energy. We're f***ing flat... Our bench stinks right now... As deep as we are, we got to get someone to f***ing participate off the bench..."

Against the Suns, the Mavericks starters did a lot of the heavy lifting, led by Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. The Dallas bench was badly outscored by its Phoenix counterpart, 28-9.

Despite that, the Mavericks still had their chance to beat the Suns. However, they were doomed by the split free throws of Phoenix big man Jusuf Nurkic with 0.8 seconds after being fouled off an offensive rebound.

Doncic had a team-high 30 points for Dallas, which dropped to 5-4 after the defeat. Irving had 29, with Naji Marshall and Daniel Gafford adding 18 and 15 points, respectively.

Jason Kidd and the Mavericks will play their next three games on the road, beginning against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.

Jason Kidd has high hopes for Mavericks' bench

That Jason Kidd was so disappointed with the underwhelming performance of the Dallas Mavericks bench against the Phoenix Suns on Friday was not at all surprising, considering he has high hopes for their auxiliaries.

The champion NBA player made it clear at the start of their campaign, sharing that the bench would have the chance to play in their setup and he is expecting them to deliver.

Kidd said last month (via The Dallas Morning News):

"As much as we can have a plan, the basketball gods can have another plan. Just to continue to be a pro. Continue to keep working. Everyone's gonna get a chance to play this season."

He added:

"Guys are going to get an opportunity to start just because of health or rest. That's just part of the nature of this business... The coaching staff has done a really good job of keeping guys ready."

Part of the Dallas bench this season are Dereck Livelky II, Naji Marshall, Maxi Kleber, Quentin Grimes, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jaden Hardy and Dwight Powell.
