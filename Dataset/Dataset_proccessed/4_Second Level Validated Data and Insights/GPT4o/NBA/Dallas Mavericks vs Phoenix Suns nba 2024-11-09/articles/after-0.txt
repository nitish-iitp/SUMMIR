Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd speaks after the team's loss to the Suns, saying he needs to get more energy from his group from the tip and the bench has to "participate" to help out Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Courtesy: @sixfivelando/X

Jason Kidd left no doubt about how he was feeling after his Dallas Mavericks lost 114-113 to the Phoenix Suns on Friday night at home.

The Mavs' head coach spoke calmly but bluntly after his team failed to overcome a 13-point half-time deficit en route to its fourth loss in nine games. The vulgarity was clearly for emphasis.

“For whatever reason, we’re getting off to a slow start, it’s gotta be addressed …" said Kidd. "Somebody’s gotta come with some [expletive] energy. We’re [expletive] flat …Our bench stinks right now … As deep as we are, we got to get someone to [expletive] participate off the bench …”

Dallas lost when Jusuf Nurkic made two free throws with 0.8 seconds left in the game, having been fouled on an offensive rebound.
