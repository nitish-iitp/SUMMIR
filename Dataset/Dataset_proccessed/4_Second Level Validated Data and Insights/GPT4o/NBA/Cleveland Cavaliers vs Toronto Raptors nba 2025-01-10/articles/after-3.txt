RAPTORS

The Cavaliers’ Darius Garland goes up for two of his game-high 40 points as the Raptors’ Scottie Barnes defends Thursday night in Cleveland.

Before facing the Cleveland Cavaliers, Raptors head coach Darko Rajakovic said how important it is for struggling teams like his to play against the best teams. It’s a chance to see how you measure up.

And the Raptors hung with Cleveland for much of Thursday, even holding an 12-point lead at one point. They pressured the Cavaliers at both ends of the floor, and a 42-point third-quarter avalanche gave them a five-point lead entering the fourth.

But on a night where both teams were on the second leg of back-to-back games, it was the Cavaliers who withstood the fatigue and eventually put the game away, 132-126, to stretch their winning streak to 12 games. Darius Garland led Cleveland with 40 points and nine assists.

“We did not get the win tonight but I’m really proud of how our guys cheered for each other, how they competed, how they gave it all they had tonight,” Rajakovic said, while lamenting the free-throw disparity (the Cavaliers went 20-for-25 while the Raptors were 6-for-13) and offensive rebounding (16-9 in favour of Cleveland).

“We did a good job of moving the ball, creating closeouts, attacking them again and creating opportunities. A lot of guys contributed tonight but, in the end, the difference was also in rebounding.”

The Raptors started aggressively, forced several key turnovers and made timely buckets in the early going. Chris Boucher came off the bench and made all his four attempts, including 3-for-3 from beyond the arc, to help Toronto take a 33-27 lead after the first quarter.

It led to one of Toronto’s best offensive performances, with all starters reaching double digits in scoring and the bench contributing 44 points. Boucher finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds.

“He was everywhere on the floor for us, very active as a cutter,” Rajakovic said.

The Cavaliers (33-4) came into Thursday’s game boasting the best record in the entire league, and are now riding a 16-game win streak that includes an impressive victory over best-in-West Oklahoma City on Wednesday.

The lottery boys

One of the underlying storylines whenever these two teams meet is how the two former lottery picks fare against each other. The Cavaliers selected Evan Mobley third in the 2021 draft, while the Raptors picked Scottie Barnes fourth. Barnes would go on to win the rookie of the year award.

In 11 head-to-head games, there hasn’t been a lot to choose between the two: Mobley has averaged 16.1 points, 10.3 rebounds and 2.5 assists; Barnes has averaged 15.7 points, 7.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists.

Barnes had 24 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists Thursday. Mobley recorded 21 points, 11 rebounds and six assists.

On the sideline

Cavaliers all-star Donovan Mitchell sat out the game for rest and Caris LeVert started in his place. He finished the game with 18 points.

The Raptors’ Ochai Agbaji missed his first game of the season following a left hip bruise suffered Wednesday in New York. He had been the only player on the Raptors roster to appear in every game this season.

Toronto was also without rookies Jonathan Mogbo and Jamison Battle, who are on assignment with the 905 along with newly minted 10-day contract signee Eugene Omuruyi. Bruce Brown was a late scratch with left knee injury management.
