The Toronto Raptors will be shorthanded as they get set to take on the top team in the East.

Toronto wing Ochai Agbaji is set to miss Thursday's outing against the Cleveland Cavaliers as he deals with a left hip pointer injury, the team announced.

Agbaji has been a picture of health for the Raptors this season, suiting up for all 37 games up to this point. In that time, he has averaged career-highs in points (10.8), rebounds (3.8), assists (1.8), steals (0.8) and three-point percentage (40.4 per cent). He is also averaging 29.5 minutes per game.

The 24-year-old has started 33 games for the Raptors this year, already the most of his career, as the team dealt with injuries in the early part of the schedule.

The team also announced that guard Davion Mitchell (left calf contusion) has been listed as probable.
