MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Anthony Edwards scored 28 of his 37 points in the second half and the Minnesota Timberwolves overcame a 19-point first-half deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 108-106 on Monday night.

Edwards, who had a career-high 53 points in Saturday’s loss at Detroit, finished 14 of 29 from the field, including a pair of late 3-pointers for his eighth game this season of 30-plus points.

Naz Reid scored 18 off the bench and Donte DiVincenzo added 15 for Minnesota, which ended a three-game slide. Rudy Gobert had eight points and a game-high 18 rebounds.

Norman Powell led Los Angeles with 25 points, James Harden added 22 and Ivica Zubac had 17 points and 16 rebounds. The Clippers have lost three of four.

Timberwolves: DiVincenzo started at point guard in place of Mike Conley, who came off the bench for the first time in his 131 games with the Timberwolves. In his 18th season overall, Conley entered averaging 8.0 points per game and shooting 34.9% from the field, both career lows. He finished with 11 points.
