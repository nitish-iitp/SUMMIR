The Oklahoma City Thunder extended their winning streak to 14 games with a 117-107 victory over the New York Knicks on Friday.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder in scoring with 33 points and added seven assists, while Aaron Wiggins knocked down five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and finished the contest with 19 points.

Oklahoma City ended the Knicks' winning streak at nine contests. The Thunder overcame a 14-point deficit to secure the victory and improve to 29-5 on the season.

New York relied heavily on its starters, with all five players logging at least 40 minutes. Mikal Bridges scored 24 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns added 17 points and 22 rebounds.

The Thunder led the Knicks 44-5 in points off the bench.

Oklahoma City center Isaiah Hartenstein faced off against his former team for the first time since leaving in free agency and recorded four points, 14 rebounds, and seven assists.

The NBA does not count the Thunder's defeat in the NBA Cup final to the Milwaukee Bucks in December as an official loss.

Oklahoma City will host the league-champion Boston Celtics on Sunday, while the Knicks travel to take on the Chicago Bulls on Saturday.
