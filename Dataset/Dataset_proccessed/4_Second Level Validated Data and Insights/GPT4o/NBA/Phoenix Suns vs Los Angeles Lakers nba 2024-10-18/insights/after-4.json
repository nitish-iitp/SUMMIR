        "Prior to the game, Suns coach Mike Budenholzer confirmed Jusuf Nurkic would make his lone preseason appearance while Grayson Allen would miss the finale.",
        "For the Lakers, LeBron James was rested.",
        "Budenholzer was asked prior to the game how important the last four games have been during his early tenure as head coach: 'I think a lot of things that are important are kind of the foundation for us, defensively and offensively. You spend a lot of time on that in camp and at times we've seen positives, we've seen the carry-over and then the beauty of it is, there's always times when we're not as good as we want to be with the standards and the expectations that we have for each other,' he said.",
        "'I think the four preseason games have been good and the work and practice has been good and we just want to keep building.'"
