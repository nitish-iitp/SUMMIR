The preseason has come to an end. Are you sad? Do you want more games that don’t count? Well, too bad. Preseason is what purgatory must feel like. The constant tease of greater things to come with none of the satisfaction. So close yet so far.

Five games just wasn’t enough for the Phoenix Suns. No, they had to get a 21st quarter of play in as the team allowed a 9-point lead in the fourth fadeaway and was forced to play overtime basketball. The result? After being outscored 15-9 in OT, Phoenix lost to Los Angeles, 128-122. Good thing that one didn’t count, or it’d be meltdown central.

I’ve said it all preseason long, and this is the last time I will: Just because the game didn’t count doesn’t mean it didn’t matter. The final preseason game was the dress rehearsal for the start of the regular season, which is less than a week away. Ah...heaven.

Kevin Durant played 31 minutes, Beal played 30, and Booke logged 28. This was as close to counting without it counting. “We hoped to get the guys up around 30 minutes,” Suns coach Mike Budenholzer said after the game. “hoped to get them playing some fourth quarter minutes, so I think that was very close to what we hoped for. I think for those guys to get up at that 30-minute mark and start getting ready for regular season and for what’s coming.”

So what are the takeaways from last night? Was raised the eyebrow, even if every so slightly?

Welcome Back Nurk Daddy

For me, the biggest thing to watch entering this game is how Nurkic looked. He had yet to log a minute of preseason play, and given that the Suns are running a new offensive system designed to open players up for three-pointers, would and could Nurkic find comfortability being, at times, a stretch five?

The stat line? 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep, plus 7 rebounds. Offensively, he looked solid.

“I mean he looks in great shape, he looks in mid-season form,” Devin Booker said after the loss. “He’s moving and shooting the ball. We’re excited to have him back. I think it opens up a lot of driving lanes. I think it pulls the other big, the rim protection away from the hoop.”

When asked about the spacing on the court, Nurkic said, “I think it is good. Especially with Bud, coaches, and players. They really are giving me full confidence to shoot as many threes as I want as far as spacing wise. Like I said, my goal was just to be out there and try to play the game.”

“He played like the Nurk I’ve been watching on film all summer,” Budenholzer added.

Defensively, Nurkic looked a step slow, and when you’re up against a second-team All-NBA center like Anthony Davis, that gets exposed. Davis put up 35 points (on a wild 28 shots) and grabbed 10 rebounds. It feels like an annual tradition at this point: the Suns face the Lakers in preseason, and Anthony Davis dominates Nurkic.

But overall, returns were certainly positive.

The Growth of Ryan Dunn

There will be ups and downs for the young rookie, Ryan Dunn. He’s not a seasoned veteran. He’s the 28th overall pick in the draft. So far, we’ve been impressed with his shooting and defense, but every game will be a learning experience for him.

Last night, Dunn learned that the whistle in the NBA isn’t always kind.

Dunn played 20 minutes last night, and while he appeared more passive offensively while playing with Durant, Booker, and Beal — he was 1-of-4 from the field and 1-of-3 from deep, accounting for just 3 points) — he was certainly aggressive on defense. Heck, he fouled out of the game. His foul rate was 10.8 per-36.

You could see his frustration as whistles came in.

Dunn has active, instinctive hands, constantly poking and prodding at the ball. Watching the six fouls called on him, you could argue that a few were ticky-tack.

Foul 1: Ryan is guarding Jaxson Haynes (nice assignment, eh?) and comes weakside to deter D’Angelo Russell’s shot. It works, as D’Lo passes out of his drive to a cutting Anthony Davis. Dunn, because he is such a ball hawk, adjusts to the pass, goes vertical, and blocks AD. But a whistle comes.

Foul 2: Dunn is on Reaves now and, as Cam Reddish comes off a screen, he sticks his hand in the cookie jar as is called for the foul. From another angle, it might have been a clean strip, but the whistle was unkind to Dunn for foul two.

Foul 3: Guarding Raves again, Dunn strips him as he drives into the paint. Looks like a pretty clean strip, but Reaves cocks his head back and lets his emo hair flow in the wind, prompting the officials to get somewhat emotional as well.

Foul 4: Guarding D’Lo now, Dunn fights through a screen by Davis. Hello, whistle my old friend...

Foul 5: Oh, now he’s on Davis? Damn, this guy is versatile. AD tries to back him down, but Dunn doesn’t let him body him up. Impressive. He forces him into a fadeaway jumper and he must’ve hit him on the wrist because a whistle comes in as the ball goes through the net.

Foul 6: A minute later, Dunn gets caught as Russell pulls the ‘ole Chris Paul rip-through trick on him. Time for the pine, rook.

Last night was definitely a “welcome to the NBA, rookie” moment for Dunn. He played aggressively, which is exactly what you want, but he’ll need to refine his instincts on what will and won’t draw a whistle. What stood out most to me, though, was his passion. After a frustrating call, he went to the bench, where veteran Royce O’Neale was there offering advice. A great moment of mentorship.

Rough Night for Bradley Beal

Not every night is a win, and one player you want to see have a good game is Bradley Beal. As an x-factor, his performance could directly impact the team’s success. As the third option, he’ll need to step up, and when he does, Phoenix has the potential to be unstoppable.

But last night was rough for Beal. He shot just 4-of-15 from the field, went 1-of-6 from deep, and posted a -10 in the +/-. He seemed out of sorts throughout the game.

His frenetic, herky-jerky style of play had me concerned. The kind of moves he was making are the ones that can lead to injury. To make matters worse, he was involved in a play where a defender landed in his space on a three-point attempt, resulting in a flagrant foul. It reminded me of the incident with Donte DiVincenzo last season, which sidelined Beal for games. I’m just relieved he walked away unscathed this time.

Defensively he wasn’t locked it either.

That’s what the preseason is for. Get these out of the system. But stay healthy while doing it, please Brad!

And so, it’s over.

The preseason has wrapped up, leaving fans eager for the regular season to begin. Next Wednesday, the Suns will head to the City of Angels, where they’ll kick off their campaign against the Clippers. This matchup will be crucial, as it sets the tone for the season ahead. Just two days later, they’ll face the Lakers again. Will Austin Reaves have Fal Out Boy on repeat? Tune in to find out...
