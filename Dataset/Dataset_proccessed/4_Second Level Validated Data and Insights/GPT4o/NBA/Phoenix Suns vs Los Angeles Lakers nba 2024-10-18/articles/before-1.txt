LA Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Preseason Game Prediction and Preview | Oct. 17, 2024 (Source: Imagn)

The LA Lakers and Phoenix Suns lock horns for the second time in preseason on Thursday at Footprint Center. The Lakers, 1-3 thus far, suffered a 118-114 loss to Phoenix in their previous matchup at Palm Springs on Oct. 6. However, the Lakers came out on top when both teams played their projected regular season rotation in the first half, taking a 69-57 lead.

LeBron James and Anthony Davis shone for LA. James tallied 19 points, five rebounds, four assists and two blocks in 16 minutes, while Davis had 17 points, eight rebounds and three assists. They shot a combined 15 of 22, including 3 of 6 from deep.

Meanwhile, the Suns' big three of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal struggled. Durant could only produce six points on 3 of 10 shots, while Booker had 12 and Beal scored 11.

LA Lakers vs. Phoenix Suns Preview

The Lakers enter this contest as the underdogs. It has been a tale of two halves for them through their opening four games. The projected regular-season rotation has been decent for majority of their matchups, while the bench and reserves have been a letdown.

However, the Lakers weren't good enough with either rotation in their 111-97 loss to the Warriors on Tuesday. Their offense didn't execute coach JJ Redick's plans as well as it would've wanted to, while there were no improvements in their already struggling defense.

LeBron James underperformed, tallying six points on 3 of 9 shots. Anthony Davis was the only bright spot after putting up 24 points and 12 rebounds on 10 of 14 shots.

The Lakers will be without James (rest) and Rui Hachimura (calf).

On the other hand, the Suns are coming off an impressive 118-114 win over the Nuggets despite playing their bench and reserves only with Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker and other starters resting/injured.

Phoenix shot lights out from 3-point range, going 23 of 52. The defense struggled against quality opposition again, but there's not much they could do to overcome that after playing shorthanded.

LA Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Prediction
