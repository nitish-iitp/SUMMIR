Young Utah Jazz Squad Gaining Valuable Experience on the Fly

The Utah Jazz rotation currently features as many as six players age 23 or younger on any given night. 

Following six draft-night selections over the past two years, head coach Will Hardy’s squad is certainly defined by its youth, as the emphasis on player development has become the key focus for the 2024-25 season. 

Of course, while that youth often comes with flashes of potential and an injection of energy and athleticism, it also comes with inexperience. Highlight-worthy buckets can often be coupled with delayed rotations on the defensive end of the floor. Flashy passes are mixed in with turnovers that create easy scoring opportunities for the opposition. 

Although this Jazz squad fell in a hole early in the season with six consecutive losses, a recent 3-2 stretch has provided the young players with valuable experience in regards to closing out opponents on the road, winning in front of the home fans, and even experiencing a playoff-like atmosphere during NBA Cup action. 

“I think there’s a lot to be proud of with the team from a growth standpoint,” Hardy said following Thursday’s win over the Dallas Mavericks. “Things got hairy there for a minute, and I think the team did a good job of keeping their heads.” 

Thursday’s victory over the reigning Western Conference Champions was highlighted by Utah’s ability to pull out a win during crunch time, with key buckets and defensive stops coming in the final minutes to secure the win. 

Although it was two veterans in Jordan Clarkson and John Collins who put the finishing touches on the game, Utah closed with Keyonte George and Kyle Filipowski on the floor, two 21-year-olds adjusting to life in the pros. It’s precisely those crunch-time situations that can only benefit young players, especially given the high-pressure environments they take place in that can’t be replicated on the practice court. 

“It’s great for us, we need more situations like that,” Collins said Thursday. “Going through those late-game situations is always good for our basketball minds, especially for the younger guys. It builds team chemistry and allows us to go through some tough moments. I always appreciate those end-of-game moments.” 

Following the victory over Dallas, Utah is 2-1 in clutch games this season with a slightly positive net-rating, an impressive start to the season in such situations given the team’s youth. 

Thursday’s win was the third in the last five games for the Jazz following a relatively comfortable road win against the Chicago Bulls on Nov. 4 and another nail-biter against the San Antonio Spurs on Nov. 9. 

Outside of the tense nature of crunch-time moments, the main takeaway that Hardy wants his young squad to focus on is the importance of mental stability. 

“We want to go into every game expecting that it will go wrong at some point,” Hardy said before that win over the Spurs. “We’re not going to play a perfect 48 minutes, it’s the nature of the sport. With a young team, emotions are natural, but we want to limit the length of the emotional reactions.” 

Struggles in the first and third quarters has been a theme over the first 11 games of the season, but Thursday’s contest showcased growth as it relates to the team’s mental response when tough moments set in. 

“Tonight isn’t about the Xs & Os piece, it was about the mental and physical toughness that the team showed,” Jazz head coach Will Hardy said Thursday. “It felt really, really good to battle through a tough moment and pull out a win here at home.”

Even games that don’t create clutch time situations (defined by the NBA as the final five minutes of regulation or overtime when the score is within five points) can still provide valuable lessons for Utah’s young core. Tuesday’s NBA Cup defeat to the Phoenix Suns allowed the young players to get an early glimpse at what a playoff atmosphere might feel like down the road. 

“It’s fun to have this thing to play for in the regular season, we want our players, especially the young guys, to be in as many competitive moments as they can,” Hardy said. 

Although it came in a loss to Devin Booker and the Suns, an early season matchup against a championship contender within a playoff atmosphere at Delta Center provided additional growth opportunities for the Jazz.

“We’re understanding the intensity we have to come out with,” rookie Cody Williams said. “We always go back to the Chicago game and just the intensity and effort we came out with is why we won that game. We’re just taking what we learned from that game and all these other games and figuring out how we should come out. 

The beauty of an NBA game is that learning opportunities can come at any moment. Whether it’s a play in the opening quarter or a moment in the game’s final seconds, each experience will prove to be invaluable for this developing Jazz squad.
