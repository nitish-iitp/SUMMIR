Utah Jazz Mailbag: John Collins’ Strong Start, Kyle Filipowski’s Emergence, and More

With nearly a month of the 2024-25 NBA season in the books, it’s time to check back in with Jazz Nation for another mailbag.

The Jazz have dealt with their fair share of adversity early in the season, with injuries to players such as Taylor Hendricks, Lauri Markkanen, and Jordan Clarkson forcing head coach Will Hardy to tinker with different rotations and lineup combinations.

Although the results haven’t landed Utah many wins on the season, the development of young players and the resurgence of some veterans has stood out in the opening 11 games of the season, especially with the Jazz going 3-2 over the last five games.

Without further ado, let’s dive into your questions! 

What is fueling John Collins’ strong play? - Tony S., Provo, UT 

Collins has been a standout performer for Utah early in this season, especially in November. Despite having to adjust to a new role coming off the bench and playing more time at the four spot compared to last season, the 27-year-old is enjoying a resurgence for head coach Will Hardy’s squad. 

On the season, Collins is averaging 18.1 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game on a 61.3 true shooting percentage. Collins’ efficiency has maintained year-over-year despite his usage increasing from 20.4 percent to 27.7 percent this season.

Those numbers jump up even more when looking just at November, with Collins posting averages of 21 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game on 59 percent shooting from the field and 44.4 percent from downtown. In each of his last two games, Collins has scored 28 or more points and grabbed at least nine rebounds, all while shooting at least 50 percent from the field.

A big shift for Collins this season has been him generating his own offense and setting up his teammates. During the 2023-24 season, 73 percent of Collins’ 2-point field-goals were assisted, a number that has dropped to 58.7 percent this season. 

“John has done a really good job of using his physicality,” Hardy said when asked about Collins’ recent stretch of play. “He’s attacked the switch really well, and our team has looked for him in those moments. He’s also been able to find some rhythm threes.” 

Collins has embraced a role that asks him to create for himself more and operate from the elbows regularly, which can also lead to playmaking opportunities for the veteran big man.

Collins’ 2.7 assists per game this season mark a new career high, while his 20.3 assist percentage would also top his next-highest season (11 percent back in 2018-19). 

“The positions I’ve been in allow me to make more plays,” Collins said. “I feel like I have a good feel for the game.” 

As a result of Taylor Hendricks’ injury, Collins will continue to be tasked with playing key minutes at both big positions, and his start to the season indicates that the veteran big man is ready for whatever role comes his way.

The responsibility of replacing a quality defender that brings both size and quickness like Hendricks does won’t fall on Filipowski or any one player in Utah’s rotation.

To his credit, Filipowski understands the importance of continuing to study his defensive roles and assignments and work on his ability to contribute in different ways on that end of the floor. 

“My experience in college and being in all these different situations in my life in basketball prepared me for this,” Filipowski said. “There’s a lot more icing and switching (as the four) versus playing more drop coverage (as the five).” 

To “ice” a ball screen means to send the ball handler towards the baseline away from the screen, while “drop” coverage is when the screener’s defender doesn’t follow the screener to the level of the screen, with the drop defender’s primary responsibility being to contain the ball handler as he comes off the screen and protect the rim. 

“I’m comfortable with my versatility (on defense),” Filipowski added. “But I still need to work on it.” 

In Thursday's win over the Dallas Mavericks, the rookie big man was often tasked with switching on the perimeter to guard Luka Dončić, a valuable learning opportunity for Filipowski, who impressed Hardy and his teammates on that end of the floor.

“Kyle’s understanding is continuing to grow, and this experience is really good for him,” Hardy said postgame. “Dončić picked him a lot to isolate, and I thought that Kyle was fantastic. I walk away feeling way more impressed with how he did defensively.” 

When asked about how the defense will perform without Hendricks, Hardy was quick to point out that responsibilities will be distributed across the rotation. 

“Cody is now being thrown into the fire, drawing matchups that Taylor was going to,” Hardy said. “Some matchups will fall more to Lauri because of his size and strength. Taylor was developing into a really solid defensive player, but we have to view this as an opportunity for guys to get more defensive responsibility and grow.” 

Filipowski will certainly play a key role within the frontcourt rotation, with his size being a key factor in how he can effectively contribute, specifically his ability to help on the defensive glass.

What numbers or trends stand out from the first month of the season? - Melissa W., Salt Lake City, UT

The first 11 games of the season have presented several challenges for the Jazz, most notably the key absences due to injuries. As a result, Hardy and the coaching staff have been tasked with adjusting rotations and schemes on the fly to accommodate the players available to play, a challenge that is also made more difficult given the team’s youth and relative inexperience at the NBA level. 

The production of the second unit has been a consistent theme early in the year, with the Jazz ranking third in the league with 44.5 points per game coming off the bench. Although Utah has had to shuffle the rotation around, there has continued to be a spark coming from the second unit regardless of who leads those groups.

As mentioned earlier, Collins has been a focal point off the bench, while Clarkson continues to get buckets off the bench. Johnny Juzang has stepped into a large role to begin this season, with his 3-point shooting helping to space the floor for Utah’s guards. The Jazz have ranked in the top six of bench scoring in each of Hardy’s three seasons at the helm, making this an early season trend that one can expect to continue moving forward. 

Another trend to keep an eye on is the increased playmaking coming from the bigs this season. The Jazz are no strangers to big men that are capable passers, with Kelly Olynyk serving as a secondary hub last season, with an average of 4.4 assists per game.

However, a role shift for Collins has increased his creation for others, Markkanen is dishing out assists at a career-high rate (2.8 per game with a 15.5 percent assist percentage), and the addition of Filipowski (3.6 assists per-36 minutes) has allowed Hardy and the coaching staff to further increase the offensive responsibilities for the bigs and continue to diversify the offense. 

Last season, handoffs made up 4.5 percent of Utah’s possessions, a number that has jumped up to seven percent this season. “We’re using it a lot after actions right now,” Hardy said. “There are times where it really helps our screening. We’re continuing to work on the synergy between our guards and our bigs. We've found that there have been a lot of times where the big is stationary that it helps the guards.” 

Although the backcourt continues to generate the majority of assists and playmaking opportunities, Utah’s offense features a healthy dose of passing from the big men.
