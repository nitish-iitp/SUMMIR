HOME  THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CHRIS PAUL AND VICTOR WEMBANYAMA WORKS, AND THE SPURS CRUSH THE JAZZ
To put it briefly
The connection between Chris Paul and Victor Wembanyama works, and the Spurs crush the Jazz
 JUAN LÓPEZ | FRI, 11/01/2024 - 04:50   
Victor Wembanyama, star of San Antonio Spurs.

After the bitter defeat against OKC, especially due to the clear loss against Chet Holmgren, Victor Wembanyama found his best game again and ended the match against what appears to be the worst team in the NBA right now, Utah Jazz, with a 25-point 5x5, 9 rebounds, 7 assists, 5 steals, and 5 blocks. He connected wonderfully with Chris Paul in a game where the veteran guard played very well, contributing 19 points and 10 assists. San Antonio Spurs triumphed 106-88, marking their second win of the season (2-3).
