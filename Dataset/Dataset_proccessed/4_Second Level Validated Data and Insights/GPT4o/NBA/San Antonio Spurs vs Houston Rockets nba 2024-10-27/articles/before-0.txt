NBA: Houston Rockets at San Antonio Spurs - Source: Imagn

Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs hosted rivals Houston Rockets on Saturday. The Spurs got off to a hot start with a 22-point lead at one stage. They entered halftime with a 62-41 advantage. The Rockets stormed back to trim the lead to one in the fourth quarter. However, the Spurs kept their composure to record the 109-106 win.

Wembanyama was at the center of it all as the reigning Rookie of the Year handled business on both ends of the floor.

Here are Wembanyama's stats from the game:

The 2023 top pick had 29 points, seven rebounds, one assist, three blocks and three turnovers, playing 30:12 minutes. He shot 10 of 17, including 2 of 5 from 3 and 7 of 8 from the free throw line.

Victor Wembanyama shrugs off poor season debut outing

Victor Wembanyama compensated for Thursday's underwhelming opening night performance against the Dallas Mavericks. Wembanyama had 17 points, nine rebounds and one block against Dallas on 27.8% shooting. He went 1 of 8 from 3-point land in that game, resulting in the Spurs' 120-109 loss.

However, Wembanyama was in his groove during the Spurs' season opener. He was the difference maker throughout the contest as San Antonio dominated Houston in the first half before almost enduring second-half collapse.

Wembanyama kept his cool, dropping 15 points in the opening 24 minutes and 14 in the second half. He looked more aggressive than he did against the Mavericks, attacking the Rockets in the paint rather than settling for jumpers.

The Spurs outscored the Rockets 52-42 in the paint and had a 28-21 advantage at the free-throw line. Wembanyama had eight of those attempts from the charity stripe. Five of his seven points in the final quarter came in the fourth, keeping the Rockets at bay in search of completing a successful comeback.

He made good use of his seemingly improved size and strength in this game, and something he must continue doing, looking at the free throw attempts he's generation. With the Spurs not being as high on 3-point shooting, that will be critical for their offense.

Victor Wembanyama will hope to continue this momentum as the Spurs looked like a completely different team with him firing on all cylinders.
