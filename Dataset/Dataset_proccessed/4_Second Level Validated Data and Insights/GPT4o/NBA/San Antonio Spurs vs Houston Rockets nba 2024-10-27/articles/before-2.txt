Reed Sheppard and the Houston Rockets got their first look at Victor Wembanyama and the revamped San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. Rockets coach Ime Udoka kept the rookie guard on the bench until 2:57 of the first quarter. Sheppard’s appearance was short as Udoka took him out with 33.1 seconds remaining in the period.

The No. 3 pick in the 2024 NBA draft started the second quarter but missed both attempts, including a 3-pointer. He added one rebound and one assist in an underwhelming six-minute first-half performance. The Rockets collectively underperformed as they trailed 62-41 after the end of the first two quarters.

Reed Sheppard didn't see action in the second half, giving him the same stats as he did in the first.

Ime Udoka benched Reed Sheppard while Gregg Popovich kept Stephon Castle late in the closely fought game

Saturday's game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Houston Rockets had an interesting sub-heading. Many looked forward to the matchup between Reed Sheppard and Stephon Castle, who the Spurs picked after Sheppard went to Houston.

Unfortunately, fans only got a glimpse of that one-on-one duel as Ime Udoka played his rookie only six first-half minutes. Sheppard didn't have his rhythm and hardly contributed.

Meanwhile, legendary Spurs coach Gregg Popovich leaned on Castle even when the game got rough. The Rockets opened the fourth quarter with guns blazing to turn what looked like a rout to a slugfest. Despite the adversity, "Pop" kept the former UConn star in the game.

Castle did not disappoint as he had significant impact on both ends of the floor. He hit crucial free throws, the last of which gave the Spurs a 109-106 lead. The Spurs rookie also had his turn defending Fred VanVleet or Jalen Green, Houston's best scorers.

Sheppard, benched by Udoka, watched helplessly from the sidelines as the Rockets couldn't complete their comeback.
