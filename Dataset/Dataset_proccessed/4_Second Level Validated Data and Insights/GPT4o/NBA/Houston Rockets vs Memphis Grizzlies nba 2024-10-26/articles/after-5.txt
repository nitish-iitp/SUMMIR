Ja Morant "excited" to be back after truncated campaign last season

Ja Morant is excited to be playing once again after a campaign that saw him limited to just nine games because of a league-imposed suspension followed by a season-ending shoulder injury.

The two-time NBA All-Star did not waste time in showcasing that he is back in their season-opener at Utah on Wednesday. He helped the team to a gutsy 126-124 victory, finishing with 22 points, on 7-of-12 shooting, 10 assists and five rebounds in 28 minutes.

Following the game, Morant shared his thoughts on being back on the court and his expectations for the new season (via the Associated Press):

"I was just excited to be back out there. These guys trust and believe in me every time I'm out there on the floor, so it's only right I go out there and play free," Morant said

He added:

"My job as a point guard is to control the game. I hate if I let the other team's point guard control the game. Whatever I can do to make sure it's in our favor, I try to do."

Ja Morant missed the first 25 games of the Grizzlies last year for flashing a gun on a friend's Instagram account late in the previous season. He returned to play nine games before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury in practice. The former Rookie of the Year averaged 25.1 points, 8.1 assists and 5.6 rebounds in 35.3 minutes per game last season.
