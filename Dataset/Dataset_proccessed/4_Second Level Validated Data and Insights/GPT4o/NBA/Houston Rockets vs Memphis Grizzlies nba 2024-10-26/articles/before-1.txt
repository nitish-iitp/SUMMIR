Zach Edey and the Memphis Grizzlies were in Houston on Friday to square off against the Rockets. After beating the Utah Jazz 126-124 two nights ago, the Grizzlies looked to get another road win to start the season. Edey, who struggled in his debut against the Jazz, had a better opening versus the Rockets.

In six first-quarter minutes, the former Purdue star contributed four points and two rebounds. He anchored Memphis’ defense when he was on the floor. More importantly, he didn’t commit any unnecessary fouls during his stint.

The big man returned to play in the second quarter and promptly grabbed an offensive rebound. He hauled another offensive board a few plays later and scored a bank shot to give the Grizzlies a 57-45 lead with 4:32 to go.

Edey had a good run in the first half, helping his team to a 65-59 lead before the second half.

Memphis' 7-foot-4 big man started the third quarter but had little impact. The Houston Rockets opened the period with a 17-0 blast to take control of the game. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins took out Edey with 6:34 in the quarter for Jay Huff.

Edey returned early in the fourth quarter and promptly scored a layup off a Jake LaRavia pass. He had more impact on both ends in the final frame, but the Grizzlies couldn't get over the hump. The rookie had a much better game, but his team lost 128-108.

Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins opened up about Zach Edey's eagerness to bounce back

Taylor Jenkins saw his rookie foul out of his debut in just 15 minutes, the only player to do so since the NBA-ABA merger. Jenkins had this to say to the media about Zach Edey's reaction to his opening-day struggles:

"When I went to him yesterday to address the first game, he said, 'Hey, just keep going. I'll get better one day at a time.' I think his head space is in a great spot. He knows he is learning a lot right now. ... Things didn't go his way, but he is gonna get better from herein. He understands that."

Edey bounced back with a better showing on Friday compared to his debut. He has to be better, though, to have more impact on the Memphis Grizzlies.
