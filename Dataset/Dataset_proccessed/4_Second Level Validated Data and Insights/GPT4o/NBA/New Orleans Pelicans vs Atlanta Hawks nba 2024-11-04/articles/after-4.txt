He’s hit this in 4/6 - now gets a spot where he could be in store for 20+ FGA. No Zion, CJ, Trey, and Herb. I’ll take my chances his back holds up (he was Q last game too), but this is also a fantastic matchup.

UConn sharpshooter Jordan Hawkins looks to be on the verge of a breakout season with the Pels as injuries keep stacking up (Dejounte, McCollum, Murphy, and Herb all OUT) and he’s being asked to carry more of a heavier workload in the offense. He’s added a midrange and can attack in closeout situations now, expanding his upside to score on all three levels.

Per-36 minutes Hawkins averages 19.5 PPG and in the last two games, his role has been tremendous, taking advantage of his opportunity, putting up B2B games of at least 17 FGA, playing 37+ minutes, and scoring at least 23 points. Dating back to last season when seeing at least 15+ FGA w/ Zion + BI Active, Hawkins is averaging 25.5 PPG, scoring 18+ points in the limited four game sample size.

His next opportunity should be a great spot to continue the momentum. He’ll face an ATL squad that giving up the 2nd most PPG in the league, and is the 3rd worst defense at defending spot-up players (30% of Hawkins PPG). Additionally, they rank dead last at defending the above the break (43% of his FGM), and if Dyson Daniels is active, there’s a chance he gets put on Brandon Ingram which could open more passes his way. #PlayerProps

Trae has been amazing this year without Dejounte Murray. He has not had to share the playmaking responsibilities on the Hawks as they have turned a bit more into a heliocentric offense.

Trae is averaging 5.2 rebounds per game and 11.7 assists per game - both career highs.

The biggest surprise has been the rebounds, but he has 8.7 chances per game which is a stark increase from 5.7 last season and 6.1 the season before, per NBA Advanced Stats.

This Pelicans team is not a good rebounding team, especially to the Guard position. Where we just saw them give up monster rebound games to Brandin Podziemski and Coby White. Couple this with them consistently allowing the most assists per game to their opponents in the league (29.7) and this sets up very well for Trae Young.

I’ll grab over 14.5 RA, a number he has cleared in 5/6 this season.

The Hawks are 0-6 against the spread this season. I have decided to bet against them until they cover a game. I put value on the Hawks, with this line pelicans -1.3 but I will just keep fading the hawks, thanks.
