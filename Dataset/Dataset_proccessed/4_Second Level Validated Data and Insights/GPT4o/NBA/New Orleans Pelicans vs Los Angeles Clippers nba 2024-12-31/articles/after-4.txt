INFO
The contending Los Angeles Clippers stave off a serious upset bid from the lowly New Orleans Pelicans, who fall to their 10th straight loss and 19th in the last 20 games

Norman Powell scored 35 points, James Harden added 27, including four decisive free throws in the final minute, and the visiting Los Angeles Clippers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 116-113 on Monday night (Tuesday, December 31, Manila time).

Ivica Zubac had 20 points and 16 rebounds and Derrick Jones Jr. scored 11 for the Clippers, who have won three in a row and five of their past six games.

CJ McCollum scored 33, Trey Murphy III and Herbert Jones had 18 each and Yves Missi scored 12 for the Pelicans, who made a season-high 18 3-pointers but still lost their 10th straight and fell for the 19th time in 20 games. Dejounte Murray amassed 13 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists and six steals.

Harden broke a tie by making two free throws with 17.9 seconds left. Missi was fouled with 4.3 seconds to go and made the first free throw but missed the second. Harden sank two more at the line with 1.8 seconds left.

McCollum started the third-quarter scoring with back-to-back 3-pointers to give New Orleans a 68-56 lead. The Pelicans led by 12 four more times before Nicolas Batum, Kevin Porter Jr. and Harden each made a 3-pointer to help Los Angeles get within one.

Harden got the Clippers even by making two foul shots with 31.9 seconds to go in the third quarter, but McCollum’s trey gave New Orleans a 90-87 lead entering the fourth.

Los Angeles got within one point twice early in the fourth quarter before McCollum’s 3-pointer gave the Pelicans a 102-98 lead. However, Powell’s 3-pointer and layup pushed the Clippers in front 112-108 with 3:01 remaining.

Jones sank two free throws and McCollum made a layup to tie the score with 2:16 left.

In the first quarter, the Clippers briefly took a two-point lead before Javonte Green, McCollum, Murphy and Jordan Hawkins each made a 3-pointer to help New Orleans take a 37-31 lead at the end of the period.

Powell scored eight of Los Angeles’ first 12 points of the second quarter as the Clippers took a 43-41 lead. The score was tied twice before Murphy made two 3-pointers and McCollum and Jones made one each during a 14-0 run that gave the Pelicans a 59-45 lead.

Powell and Kris Dunn each scored five points during an 11-3 run that pulled the Clippers within 62-56 at halftime. – Rappler.com
