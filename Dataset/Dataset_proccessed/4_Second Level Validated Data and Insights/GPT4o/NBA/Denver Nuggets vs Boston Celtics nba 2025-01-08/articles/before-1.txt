Celtics outlast Nuggets on the road, secure 118-106 victory

Boston Celtics defeated the Denver Nuggets on the road Tuesday night grabbing a 118-106 win against a tough Western Conference opponent. Boston returns home for twin games at TD Garden over the weekend.

The Celtics got out to a hot start and looked like they were going to walk away with any easy win. But the shorthanded Nuggets, who are without reigning MVP Nikola Jokić, played tough, hard-nosed basketball. Credit guys like Russell Westbrook and Jamal Murray for stepping up and Jokić's absence. But Boston was the better team down the stretch, and the guys in green came up with enough plays in the tail end of the fourth quarter to take control of the game and walk away with a victory.

Check out some of the best moments from the night, a 118-106 Celtics victory on the road against the Nuggets.
