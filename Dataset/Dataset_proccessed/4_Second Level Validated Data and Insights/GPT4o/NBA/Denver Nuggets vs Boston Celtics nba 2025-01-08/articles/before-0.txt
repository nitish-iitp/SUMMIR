FINAL: Celtics 118, Nuggets 106

Jayson Tatum dropped a game-high 29 points to lead the Celtics to a hard-fought win over the Nuggets at Ball Arena.

The Boston Celtics finished their four-game road trip on a high note with a hard-fought victory in Denver.

Tuesday's Celtics-Nuggets showdown featured 10 lead changes and eight ties. Even without Derrick White and Nikola Jokic, both sidelined due to illnesses, it was an entertaining matchup between the last two NBA champion squads.

Boston sealed the win with a 15-0 run during the fourth quarter. It outlasted Denver despite being outshot from 3-point range. The Celtics shot 12-for-35 from deep (34.3 percent) while the Nuggets went 14-for-36 (38.9 percent).

Jayson Tatum (29 points, six assists) and Kristaps Porzingis (25 points, 11 rebounds) were the stars for the C's. Jrue Holiday (19 points, seven assists) and Jaylen Brown (14 points, eight rebounds, eight assists) also played significant roles. Sam Hauser chipped in with nine points on three 3s off the bench.

Porzingis brings game-changing dynamic to Celtics' win over Nuggets
By Darren Hartwell

Abby Chin caught up with Kristaps Porzingis after he dropped 25 points, 11 rebounds, 2 steals and a block in the Celtics’ win over the Denver Nuggets.

The Denver Nuggets knew what to expect from the Boston Celtics. Or so they thought.

"No matter what you do, they’re gonna get 50 3s up," Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said Monday of the Celtics. "... That is their thing offensively. ‘We’re gonna just put a lot of 3s up.'"

Fast forward to Tuesday night in Denver, when Boston attempted just 35 3-pointers (its second-lowest total of the season) and made just 12 -- yet still beat Malone's Nuggets by double digits, 118-106.

Tuesday's game was just the seventh time this season the Celtics haven't made more 3-pointers than their opponent, and they entered Denver with a 2-4 record when losing the 3-point battle. So, how did they defeat a Nuggets team that made 39 percent of its 3-pointers (14 of 36)?

C's pulling away
By Justin Leger

Score: 105-93 Celtics, 4:54 left in fourth quarter

The Celtics ripped off a 12-0 run to go up double digits with just under five minutes to go.

Kristaps Porzingis has been huge for the C's, notching a team-high 24 points with 10 rebounds, two assists, two steals, and an emphatic block on DeAndre Jordan.

Jayson Tatum has matched Porzingis with 24 points. Jaylen Brown (14 points, 8 assists) and Jrue Holiday (12 points, 7 assists) have also made a significant impact.

End of third quarter
By Justin Leger

Score: 88-83 Celtics

The Celtics' road trip is set up for a fun finish in Denver. They'll need Jayson Tatum (22 points) to come up big in the fourth quarter as the supporting cast, outside of Kristaps Porzingis (22 points), hasn't stepped up to this point.

Boston will have to slow Denver down from 3-point range. The Nuggets are 12-for-29 (41.4 percent) from deep. The Celtics are just 8-for-27 (29.6 percent).

Westbrook red-hot from deep
By Justin Leger

Score: 80-77 Celtics, 2:57 left in third quarter

Russell Westbrook has made as many 3-pointers (4-7) as the entire Celtics starting lineup (4-16). That has helped Denver keep this one close.

Westbrook is one of five Nuggets players in double figures. Kristaps Porzingis (20 points) and Jayson Tatum (19 points) are leading the way for a Celtics team that has struggled from deep (6-21).

11:30 PM EST
Jaylen finding his groove
By Justin Leger

Score: 69-66 Celtics, 7:15 left in third quarter

After going scoreless through most of the first half, Jaylen Brown has helped the C's regain the lead in the third quarter. He has eight points (3-7 FG) to go with six assists and three rebounds.

The Celtics haven't shot well from 3-point range (5-for-17). Denver has doubled them up from beyond the arc (10-23). Still, Boston has found a way to lead most of this game with Kristaps Porzingis (18 points) and Jayson Tatum (15 points) doing their part.

Halftime
By Justin Leger

Score: 57-57 Celtics

Celtics reserve big man Neemias Queta made his presence felt in the second quarter. He's up to eight points (4-5 FG) with a steal in eight minutes off the bench.

The bad news for C's fans? Denver erased Boston's 15-point lead with a dominant second quarter. The Celtics were outscored in the frame, 32-20.

Jamal Murray (15 points), Michael Porter Jr. (11 points), Russell Westbrook (10 points), and Julian Strawther (10 points) have led the Nuggets' comeback effort. Kristaps Porzingis (16 points) and Jayson Tatum (13 points) have paced the Celtics.

Nuggets nailing their 3s
By Justin Leger

Score: 43-34 Celtics, 8:56 left in second quarter

Denver is doing its best to beat Boston at its own game. It's 7-for-16 (43.8 percent) from 3-point range to the Celtics' 5-12 (41.7 percent).

Porter Jr. and Russell Westbrook both have hit a pair of 3s for the Nuggets. Al Horford has two of the Celtics' five 3s.

Kristaps Porzingis (16 points) and Jayson Tatum (11 points) still lead the C's in the scoring column.

JAN 7

End of first quarter
By Justin Leger

Score: 37-25 Celtics

Boston has an early double-digit lead thanks to stellar starts from Kristaps Porzingis (15 points) and Jayson Tatum (11 points). Porzingis exited the game late in the quarter after being kicked between the legs, but he returned minutes later. His 15 points marks the most he has scored in a quarter this season.

The Celtics have dominated inside the arc with 18 points in the paint to the Nuggets' two. Michael Porter Jr. leads Denver with eight points.

10:25 PM EST
Tatum doing it all
By Justin Leger

Score: 30-21 Celtics, 2:48 left in first quarter

Jayson Tatum is getting it done on both ends of the floor early in this one. The C's superstar has eight points (4-7 FG), three assists, one rebound, and a block in nine minutes.

Tatum followed his emphatic block with a beautiful lob to Kristaps Porzingis on the other end. Porzingis leads Boston with 11 points in the first quarter.

Nuggets coach shares blunt take on Celtics' offensive strategy
By Darren Hartwell

Kristaps Porzingis reacts to the Celtics’ loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Boston led by 10 points at halftime, but scored only 27 points in the second half in the loss.

The Boston Celtics' reputation precedes them, it appears.

The Celtics have gone all-in on 3-point shooting under head coach Joe Mazzulla, attempting an NBA-leading 42.5 3s per game last season en route to an NBA championship. This season, they've leaned in even further, with a whopping 50.2 3-point attempts per game that is 6.3 attempts more than the next-closest team and would smash the NBA record for most 3-point attempts per game in one season (45.4 by the Houston Rockets in 2018-19) if it holds.

So, when Denver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone was asked Monday how plans to prepare for Tuesday night's showdown with the Celtics (10 p.m. ET on NBC Sports Boston), his message essentially was this: Shooters gonna shoot.

“No matter what you do, they’re gonna get 50 3s up. I really believe that,” Malone told reporters, via the Denver Post. “Nineteen of their 50 3s they take are off the bounce. They’re shooting pull-up 3s in transition. They’re shooting pull-up 3s in pick-and-rolls. That is their thing offensively. ‘We’re gonna just put a lot of 3s up.'"

Taking stock of Celtics' title aspirations after loss to Thunder
By Chris Forsberg, Celtics Insider

Joe Mazzulla reacts to the Celtics’ 105-92 loss to the Thunder and breaks down what went wrong for Boston in the second half.

We’re not in the business of dismissing losses. The Oklahoma City Thunder bullied the Boston Celtics in the second half of Sunday’s potential NBA Finals preview and the Celtics limped out of the Paycom Center with their first double-digit loss of the season.

Boston’s offense was a clunky disaster in the second half and the Thunder made things look even worse with their physicality and grit, whether that was ripping away loose balls and creating easy transition opportunities, or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander swatting Jayson Tatum at the rim to thwart Boston’s last gasp comeback attempt.

The Celtics did themselves no favors with their shot-making. In the shadow of Oklahoma City’s Bricktown, the Celtics built a brick town of their own. Boston is now 5-5 against teams ranked in the top 10 in defensive rating, per Cleaning the Glass tracking, but that mark drops to 2-4 when you zoom in on teams that are top 10 in both defensive rating and point differential.

By comparison, OKC is 7-2 against those teams and Cleveland is 3-1, with Boston being the lone loss.
