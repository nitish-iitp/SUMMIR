Following a much-anticipated 30th anniversary season opener, the Raptors walked off the court last night with a disappointing scoreboard result. 

On Wednesday night, the Toronto Raptors lost by 30 points to the Cleveland Cavaliers, breaking a record as the worst season opener result in franchise history. 

“Raptors losing by 30 in honour of their 30th anniversary is truly poetic,” one user posted on X.

Last night’s defeat exceeded the Raptors’ previous worst season-opener result, a 29 point loss to the Orlando Magic in 2001. 

Montreal’s Chris Boucher led the team in scoring with 18 points, while second-year Raptors player Gradey Dick hit 16.

In the second quarter, the team was outscored 36-17 and committed more turnovers than they made shots. 

“We got slapped in the face,” Boucher said in a post-game interview. “It was probably good for us, especially as young as we are. It’s not easy to win games, so I think it’s good for us to realize that the season has actually started and we have to play a lot harder than we did tonight.”

The final score of the game was 136-106, with the Cavaliers coming out on top with a 25-point performance from Evan Mobley. 

“I kind of felt like I was watching the Blue Jays at mid season. Didn’t last for the 2nd half,” one X user said. 

Another X user expressed optimism for when Raptors shooting guard RJ Barrett returns to the court after being injured, “paint points will come a lot easier when he’s back,” they wrote. 

On Friday, the Raptors will face the Philadelphia 76ers, coached by Toronto’s former head coach Nick Nurse, for a second chance at a home soil win this season.

Navigating January: Canadian experts weigh in on how to beat the winter blues

As Christmas trees lay dormant on curbsides and the frigid winter air settles in for the long haul, the post-holiday blues can be a jolting reality in January. 

While New Year’s resolutions act as motivation for some people this month, others may feel lack of motivation, fatigue, and a general sadness, otherwise known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). 

The first month of the year can be challenging for several reasons: the lack of sunshine, a decline in social plans, and the extra effort of getting back into routine after the holidays. 

Even cases of marital divorce increase in this month, as the first Monday of the new year is deemed “National Divorce Day.” 

All this to say, January can be a challenging month for many people. 

WHAT DOES SAD LOOK LIKE?

In Ontario, 15 per cent of the general population have experienced SAD, which can feel like irritability, changes in sleep patterns, and overall not feeling like yourself, according to the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA).  

Christina Gallo, a registered mental health therapist from CMHA says that many people seek mental health support in the cold months due to factors such as reduced daylight, cold weather, and the impacts of SAD. 

“The holiday season can also trigger feelings of isolation, stress, or disappointment, prompting more people to reach out for help. This is a normal feeling and we can all take steps to improve our mental health,” she said. 

January in particular can be challenging due to financial stress from the holidays, as well as the pressures to meet new year goals. 


“Many people also struggle with the pressure to start fresh or make drastic changes, which can feel overwhelming. It’s important to acknowledge that it’s okay to feel this way and to remind individuals that they’re not alone in their struggles, encouraging empathy and understanding during this time,” Gallo said. “Normalizing these feelings through open conversations helps reduce stigma and makes it easier to seek support.” 

Gallo says that any step taken toward feeling better matters, such as prioritizing self care and connecting with others. 

“Progress isn’t always linear, and even small achievements matter. Healing takes time, so be patient with yourself, and consider reaching out to a professional for extra support if needed.” 

The CMHA also recommends going outdoors, even in the cold months, during daylight hours to get some sunshine, and arrange indoor environments to provide maximum sunlight through the windows. 

HOW SUN EXPOSURE CAN COMBAT SAD

Speaking of sunlight—it’s a major reason for feeling mental health challenges in the colder months, according to Dr. Michael Mak, a psychiatrist from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). 

“It’s so gloomy right? We know that light exposure, particularly first thing upon awakening, like sunlight, makes people happier, and it’s a treatment for seasonal depression,” he told Now Toronto. 

Mak recommends people expose themselves to natural sunlight when possible, for half an hour, or use a bright light machine of a minimum rate of 10,000 LUX for 30 minutes. 

He adds that those who are susceptible to depression at any point in the year, are unfortunately more likely to experience SAD in the winter.   

In addition to increasing light exposure, he suggests people struggling with low mood are diligent with keeping a strict and regular sleep schedule, eating regular meals, and exercising as much as you can. 

If people begin to experience suicidal thoughts, reach out to CAMH or CMHA for support.

A Canadian firefighting aircraft sent to California to help extinguish massive wildfires has been grounded after it was struck by an unauthorized civilian drone, the LA County Fire Department (LAFD) says.

The CL-415, otherwise referred to as SuperScooper Quebec 1, is specially designed to collect 1,600 gallons of water from the ocean, in a matter of seconds, to then drop on raging fires. 

Videos shared on X of the aircraft in action show the jet skimming the surface of the Pacific to take on water.

Cal Fire spokesperson Chris Thomas, told The War Zone, a defense news and analysis website, that the plane sustained damage around 10 a.m. PST on Thursday and remains out of service.

An image released of the aircraft by the LAFD shows a large circular gash in one of its components.

Following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation announcement, the party has revealed the date for who will take his spot as Liberal leader. 

The Liberals announced Thursday that a new party leader will be named by March 9  and those interested in running in the leadership race will have to pay an entrance fee of $350,000. 

READ MORE: https://nowtoronto.com/news/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-expected-to-resign/ 

All contestants must declare their race participation by Jan. 23 in order to be included in the “robust and secure nation-wide process,” President of the Liberal Party of Canada, Sachit Mehra, said in a press release on Thursday. 

“This is a time for Liberals across the country to exchange ideas and engage in thoughtful debate to shape the future of our party and our country – and I encourage all Liberals to get involved in this exciting moment for our party,” he said. 

After the leadership vote concludes on Mar. 9, a new leader will be announced  the same day. 

A number of Canadian politicians have already announced they will be opting out in running in the race to replace Trudeau, including Foreign Affair Minister Mélanie Joly and Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc. 

While speculation circulates whether Chrystia Freeland, the former Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister to Trudeau, will run following her tense resignation last month, more candidates are expected to throw their hats in the ring in the coming weeks. 

“This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I am having to fight internal battles. I cannot be the best option in that election,” Trudeau said in his resignation speech on Jan. 6. 

Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of Canada, is also a rumoured candidate to join the running. 

He also announced that Parliament will be prorogued on Mar. 24, 2025.

The cut-off date to become a registered Liberal and to be eligible to vote in the race for a new party leader is Jan. 27.  

A registered Liberal must meet the following criteria: be at least 14 years of age, support the purposes of the party, be a Canadian citizen, have status under the Indian Act or be a permanent Canadian resident, not be a member of any other federal political party in Canada; and not have publicly declared an intention to be a candidate for election to the House of Commons other than as a candidate of the Party, while registered as a Liberal.

Generation Beta is here. Canadian experts predict how they will redefine the world

2025 marks the beginning of a new generation that Canadian experts predict will be fully immersed in fast-paced technological advancements. 

The incoming Generation Beta encompasses anyone born between 2025 and 2039. They follow Generation Alpha, who were born between 2010 and 2024. 

Both names were coined by demographic research company McCrindle, which named the generations after letters of the Greek alphabet to signify how the incoming generations will be raised in an entirely different world, one of never-before-seen technological integration. 

WHAT WILL GENERATION BETA LOOK LIKE? 

Gen Beta will be the children of younger Gen Ys (Millennials) and older Gen Zs. According to McCrindle, they will make up a mere 16 per cent of the global population by 2035. 

The theory of a smaller population is echoed by York University Associate Professor Natalie Coulter, who says the desire for having children has flattened a bit over time as people consider a future of uncertainty, fueled by current issues, such as the climate change crisis and rapid urbanization. 

“I think it’s a tough place to sometimes think about having children,” Coulter explained to Now Toronto in an interview on Thursday. 

“We can see it coming. I think that’s the reality that’s going to shape so much of our children’s lives.”

A 2024 report from Statistics Canada says that Canada’s fertility rate hit a record low in 2022, sitting at 1.33 children per woman. In addition, another report by the agency proved that parents are not only having fewer children, but also are having them at older ages in comparison to parents in previous generations. The delayed fertility rate has occurred alongside an increase in young adults living with their parents, where more than one third (35.1 per cent) of young adults between ages 20 to 34 years were living with at least one of their parents in 2021.

Gen Beta will also be the first generation to experience a tech-saturated world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with the technology expected to be widespread in multiple industries from education to healthcare to entertainment. 

Sean Lyons, a professor at the University of Guelph and an expert in intergenerational differences, predicts that as Gen Beta ascends into childhood, they will embrace AI in ways beyond our current comprehension. 

“We’ve seen that each successive generation tends to adopt the technology of the youth and make it their own, and that children are using technology at younger ages. I imagine that by the time this generation is in their late childhood they’ll be using generative AI tools to create all kinds of things that are just novelties to us right now,” Lyons said in an email statement. 

“For instance, they’ll probably have tools that will allow them to create their own stories and videos that are tailored to their individual interests. The media they consume will be super-customized to their preferences.”

For Gen Ys and Zs, many witnessed the real-time change from dial-up internet to Wi-Fi or from keyboard flip phones to fully touch-screen devices. Lyons suggests that there won’t be any groundbreaking gadgets headed to the market anytime soon, but believes that AI and updated software will surely shift the technological landscape. 

“We’ve probably hit a plateau for devices. Phones, tablets and computers are still getting faster and more powerful, but they really aren’t changing that much. Wearable technology and augmented reality are possibilities, but they haven’t really taken off to date. It will probably be the software applications that are new for this generation,” Lyons explained. 

“Pairing generative AI with phones will probably be the frontier for new technology. But you never know what new technology is poised to revolutionize how we communicate, work and play!”

Coulter also believes Gen Beta will move towards wearable technologies, such as smart glasses, but warns the risk of privacy breaches. 

“Technology is going to be connected more and more to our bodies,” she said. 

“We already have cameras everywhere, but now we have this constant surveillance, and it’s hard to tell who’s filming you, who’s watching you, who owns that film, and how that might get overlapped with facial recognition… this idea of constantly filming and screening our immediate environment attached to our body is definitely something that I think we’re gonna have to contend with.” 

WHAT NAME TRENDS CAN WE PREDICT FROM GENERATION BETA? 

Traditional names like Olivia, Charlotte, Noah and Liam constantly swept baby name lists over the last decade. But as the world has become more accepting of diversity, Coulter suggests that we could begin to see that reflected in how the children of Gen Beta are named.

Canada’s most popular baby names for 2023 have been released, and they probably won’t surprise you

“We know that people are much more fluid. I think it will definitely influence some parents. I think other people might kind of be really resistant towards this and really sort of push a particular gendering of their names as a reaction,” Coulter said. 

Lyons agreed that the idea of unisex, non-binary names could be a possibility in the future, and that traditional names could eventually begin to take a backseat. 

“Canada is growing more culturally diverse every year, so I would expect that baby names would reflect that,” Lyons said. 

“The traditional names like Liam and Olivia may hold for people with a Western Anglophone background, but I’d expect them to be less common overall.”

WHAT COULD GEN BETA’S WORKFORCE LOOK LIKE? 

While the earliest that someone a part of Gen Beta could be employed is in 2039, it’s important to note that the landscape of working has also shifted. In the last 15 years, hobbies such as online video content creation have become full time-jobs, while office jobs in some industries have become completely obsolete. While it’s hard to say what careers will look like in a couple of decades, Lyons says he believes one thing that is required is the constant need for people to keep learning to adapt in an ever-changing world. 

“The careers that we pushed for kids 20 years ago were in STEM fields like software engineering and computer science. Those fields have changed a lot over time. We know that our population is aging and that will continue as a trend. Healthcare and eldercare will always be important career options,” he said.  

“My hope is that we see a resurgence of students who take an interest in arts, humanities and social sciences as well. In the age of AI and divisive politics, we need more critical thinking skills than ever before,” Lyons added.
