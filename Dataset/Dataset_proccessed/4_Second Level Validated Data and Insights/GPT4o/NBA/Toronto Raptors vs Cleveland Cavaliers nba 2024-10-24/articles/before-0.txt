TORONTO - The Toronto Raptors began their 30th NBA season with a 136-106 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday evening at Scotiabank Arena.

The 30-point defeat marks the largest margin of loss in a season opener in franchise history, surpassing the previous record of 29 points set in their 2001 season opener against Orlando. Toronto entered the game with an 18-11 record in season openers, having won eight of their last 11.

A sold-out crowd of 19,800 fans, including former Raptors players from the past 29 seasons and recently inducted Hall of Famer Vince Carter, filled the arena. Toronto started strong, leading for much of the first quarter with an advantage of up to seven points.

However, Cleveland rallied, closing the quarter with a 13-5 run to take a 33-32 lead. The Cavaliers never trailed again, widening their lead to 69-49 by halftime. By the end of the third quarter, the margin had grown to 26 points, prompting both teams to rest their starters for most of the final period.

Scottie Barnes, the team's only All-Star from last season, managed just nine points on 3-for-14 shooting and recorded a game-worst minus-33 rating. The 23-year-old, who signed a five-year maximum contract extension in the offseason, had only two games last season with fewer points.

"It's one night, one game. We all believe in Scottie and know what kind of player he is and how he will contribute to the team. He will be just fine," said Raptors head coach Darko Rajakovic.

Guard Immanuel Quickley, who also re-signed with a five-year contract extension, left the game in the second quarter with a right pelvic injury. At the time, he was leading the team with 13 points.

Despite the season-opening loss, Rajakovic expressed pride in his team's overall effort and the opportunity for four rookies to make their NBA debuts.

"Guys had a lot of emotions going into the game. We had a lot of guys that played an NBA game for the first time," said the Serbian coach. "There's a lot of process. It's the start of a long journey."
