Paolo Banchero returned from a 34-game absence on Friday to nearly lead the Orlando Magic to an upset of the Milwaukee Bucks. The Magic lost 109-106 but gave the Bucks a scare late in the fourth quarter. Banchero scored 15 points in the period but missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer at the final buzzer.

Bucks coach Doc Rivers had this to say about Banchero, who is still on his four-year, $50.1 million rookie contract, after the game:

“He was great. Good to be young. You miss that many games and you come out with 34 points, seven rebounds and I bet he missed five shots he would love to have over again. That was unbelievable by him.”

The Bucks trailed 81-78 heading into the fourth quarter but stormed to the lead behind Giannis Antetokounmpo’s early onslaught. Orlando refused to cave in as Paolo Banchero returned the favor to the two-time MVP. Banchero scored 15 points to nearly drag his hobbled team to the finish line.

The Magic hosted the Bucks without Franz Wagner, Mo Wagner, Gary Harris and Jalen Suggs. Despite missing key players, they nearly pulled off the upset, thanks to Banchero.

Orlando Magic need Paolo Banchero, other stars healthy in push for playoffs

The Orlando Magic had a 19-15 record without Banchero. Franz Wagner, Mo Wagner, Jalen Suggs and Goga Bitadze kept the team afloat as Banchero recovered from an oblique injury.

However, the Wagner brothers and Suggs succumbed to injuries, making it critical for Banchero to return. After the loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, Orlando is 22-18, sitting fifth in the Eastern Conference.

Orlando has been competitive, as coach Jamahl Mosley has coaxed more out of Anthony Black, Cole Anthony and Goga Bitadze. Wins have been hard to come by, as they are usually overpowered by playoff-contending teams.

In his first game back from a long layoff, Banchero proved he is a huge difference-maker who can carry the team.

Franz Wagner has not been cleared for contact, per Mosley. Mo Wagner is out for the season following ACL surgery, and Jalen Suggs is indefinitely out with a back strain. Orlando is desperately hoping Banchero can put them on his back and lead them to a playoff spot.
