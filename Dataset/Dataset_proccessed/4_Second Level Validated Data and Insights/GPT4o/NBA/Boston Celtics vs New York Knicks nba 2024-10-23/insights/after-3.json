        "Josh Hart of the Knicks commented on the Celtics' performance, saying 'The NBA needs to drug test all of them, because that was \u2014 I ain\u2019t never seen nothing like that before, man.'",
        "Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau reflected on the game, stating 'Mathematically, it\u2019s going to be hard to win that game. Twenty-nine threes made, (61) they took. We shot a high enough percentage (36.7%), but the 3-point game, mathematically, you\u2019re not winning that.'",
        "Josh Hart also mentioned, 'They\u2019re already an explosive team, and obviously there was energy in the arena today that was contagious. They played extremely well. We\u2019ll look at it, we\u2019ll learn from it. Look at some of the defensive missteps that we had that led to their shots. But it was Game 1. There\u2019s (81) other ones. We\u2019re not going to overreact.'"
