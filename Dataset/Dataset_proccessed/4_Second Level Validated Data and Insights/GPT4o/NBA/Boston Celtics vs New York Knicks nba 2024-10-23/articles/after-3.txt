‘Drug test all of them’: Knicks starter in awe of Celtics’ record-setting shooting

UPDATED: October 23, 2024 at 3:57 PM EDT

Seated at his locker after the Celtics buried his Knicks beneath a tidal wave of 3-pointers, Josh Hart could only shake his head and laugh.

New York was on the wrong end of a historic, bafflingly effective shooting performance in Tuesday night’s season opener at TD Garden. Boston set a single-game franchise record and tied the all-time NBA high with 29 made threes in a 132-109 victory.

“The NBA needs to drug test all of them, because that was — I ain’t never seen nothing like that before, man,” Hart joked to reporters after the game, via SNY.

The Celtics, who took head coach Joe Mazzulla’s preference for threes over twos to a new extreme as they began their title defense, were well on their way to shattering the league-wide 3-point record before going cold in garbage time. They tied it with 8:54 remaining in the fourth quarter, then proceeded to miss their final 13 attempts from beyond the arc.

Even with that late swoon, the Celtics still finished with an impressive 47.5% shooting percentage from deep (29 of 61). Before the 0-for-13 finish, they were hitting their threes at a 60.4% clip.

“Mathematically, it’s going to be hard to win that game,” Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau said. “Twenty-nine threes made, (61) they took. We shot a high enough percentage (36.7%), but the 3-point game, mathematically, you’re not winning that.”

Thibodeau’s team made a pair of bold offseason moves aimed at challenging the Celtics for Eastern Conference supremacy, including trading five first-round draft picks for Mikal Bridges to beef up their wing defense. The Celtics attempted seven 3-pointers with Bridges as the closest defender Tuesday night and made six of them, per NBA player tracking, while also hunting fellow trade acquisition Karl-Anthony Towns on the defensive end.

Every Boston starter hit at least three triples in the win, and all five shot better than 50% from range. Jayson Tatum went 8-for-11 on threes as part of a superb 37-point, 10-assist performance. Derrick White and Jaylen Brown were 6-of-10 and 5-of-9, finishing with 24 and 23 points, respectively. Jrue Holiday: 4-for-6, 18 points. Al Horford: 3-for-5, 11 points.

Collectively, the Celtics’ starting five went 26-for-41 on 3-pointers (63.4%). The Knicks’ starters were 4-for-17, and they finished 11-for-30 as a team.

“I mean, you’ve got to give them credit, man,” Hart said. “They’re already an explosive team, and obviously there was energy in the arena today that was contagious. They played extremely well. We’ll look at it, we’ll learn from it. Look at some of the defensive missteps that we had that led to their shots. But it was Game 1. There’s (81) other ones. We’re not going to overreact.”
