The Dallas Mavericks bucked the absence of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 117-110 on Thursday. Without the Doncic-Irving tandem, the Mavericks relied on a balanced attack to pull out the win despite trailing by 10 points late in the fourth quarter. Dereck Lively II led the rally with 13 points in the final frame.

Fans promptly reacted on X/Twitter to the Trail Blazers’ collapse that allowed the Mavs to escape with a win:

“Unbelievable tank job.”

@prestoluh said:

“Portland has the worst offensive approach I've seen of any team. It's just Simons and Sharpe ball hogging and dribbling around looking for their shots.”

@The_Scoreloard added:

“Shaedon Sharpe tank commander.”

One fan commented:

“Watched Simmons sold this game like it was on sale.”

Another fan reacted:

“Mission accomplished by Portland.”

The Portland Trail Blazers led 91-81 early in the fourth quarter after Scoot Henderson made two free throws. Chauncey Billups’ team kept the Dallas Mavericks out for most of the final frame. Trail Blazers forward Toumani Camara sank a 24-footer to give Portland a 109-99 advantage with 4:33 remaining.

However, Dallas uncorked a 16-0 blast that was capped off by Quentin Grimes’ floater that pushed the Mavs ahead 115-109. Portland didn’t score again until Camara evaded PJ Washington for a dunk with 26.1 seconds left in the game.
