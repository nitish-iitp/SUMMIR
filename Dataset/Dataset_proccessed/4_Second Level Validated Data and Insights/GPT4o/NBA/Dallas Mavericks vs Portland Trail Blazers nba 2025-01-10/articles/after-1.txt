Jaden Hardy’s recent offensive surge is just what the shorthanded Mavericks need

No one in the NBA is shooting better from beyond the 3-point line over the last two weeks than Jaden Hardy.

The Dallas Mavericks guard has made 55.6% of his shots from 3-point range (minimum of 25 attempts) since Dec. 28.

His recent surge arrives when they need it most. The team is knee deep in a difficult stretch of games against potential championship contenders while Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are sidelined with injuries.

Hardy missed nearly three weeks in December because of a right ankle injury. His newfound consistency since returning resulted in a season-high 25 points in Thursday’s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, tying for fourth-most points in a game in his career.

Dereck Lively II stared at the final stat sheet before fielding questions during his postgame news conference. What was the first thing that caught his eye?

“My man J-Hardy got a plus-25,” Lively said. “That’s the first thing I’m looking at.”

Make that a plus-13, second on the team after Lively’s plus-15, but his 25 points can’t be denied.

“He’s starting to get into a groove,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “You see that on the offensive end. Defensively, he’s competing and giving it everything we’re asking him to do. … I think the more minutes he’s playing, he’s becoming more comfortable with what we’re asking him to do. We need that with everybody out.”

Hardy is showing glimpses of why the Mavericks signed him to a three-year, $18 million extension days before the season began. He has scored in double figures in a career-high five consecutive games, including outputs of 15 or more points in each of the last four. The Mavericks are 10-4 when Hardy scores at least 10 points.

Shaking off the rust from a long layoff can be difficult, but Hardy attributes his uptick in offense to consistent preparation.

“Just sticking to what I’ve been doing,” Hardy said. “Extra work. Extra film. Asking the coaches questions. ‘What can I do better to help the team?’ Just trying to bring energy whenever I get out there and bring a spark.”

Several newcomers have also provided instant offense for the Mavericks with their stars out, including Quentin Grimes, Klay Thompson and Naji Marshall, but Hardy’s contributions are years in the making. He’s averaging 8.2 points on a career-high 44% shooting from the field in his third NBA season.

Before the ankle sprain, Hardy averaged 6.5 points and 1.4 rebounds on shooting splits of 39% from the field and 30% from 3. Since he’s returned from injury, his numbers have increased to 14.6 points and 2.3 rebounds on 54% shooting from the field and 55% from 3.

Turnovers and decision-making, including shot selection, were areas of improvement for Hardy going into the season, Kidd said.

“We’ve talked about that. It shouldn’t be any challenged shots,” he said Thursday. “If the ball moves, we’re playing for one another and making plays for one another. We can create that advantage. He’s taken full advantage of being able to shoot the 3 with no contest or a late contest. He made some big shots for us when our offense was struggling.”

The opposing coach Thursday was Chauncey Billups, a 2024 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and one of Hardy’s favorite players growing up in Detroit. He said he wears No. 1 because of Billups, who became an NBA champion and the MVP of the 2004 Finals while playing for the Pistons.

Before the game, Billups mentioned Hardy as a player who could be looking to prove himself with Doncic and Irving sidelined.

“When you got your main guys out, I just know this too well, you got so many guys looking to prove that they maybe deserve an elevated role, if you will,” Billups said. “You always have to fend against that.”

Hardy figured to compete with Spencer Dinwiddie for the backup point guard role entering the season, especially after the Mavericks lost Dante Exum to a right wrist injury before training camp. With both playing well, Kidd’s rotations and combinations will be an intriguing topic once the team is healthy.

Regardless of the future, Hardy is embodying the team’s “next man up” mentality.

“Just trying to take advantage of the opportunities that’s given to me,” he said. “Just trying to be a good teammate whenever I’m out there. Just bring energy and I feel like that alone can change a game. That’s what I’m all about, just coming in trying to make an impact and play the right way.”
