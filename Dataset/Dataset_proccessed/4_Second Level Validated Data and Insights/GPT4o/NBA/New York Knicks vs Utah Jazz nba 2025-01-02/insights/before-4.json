        "Josh Hart has been on a rebounding tear recently, securing 11+ boards in each of his last four games and 8+ in six of his last eight outings. During this stretch, he\u2019s averaging an impressive 9.3 rebounds per game.",
        "The matchup against the Utah Jazz offers additional upside for Hart's rebounding opportunities: Utah\u2019s Vulnerability to SG Rebounds: The Jazz allow the 13th most rebounds per game to opposing shooting guards.",
        "Potential Absence of John Collins: Collins is listed as doubtful, which could weaken Utah's frontcourt presence and create more opportunities for Knicks players to dominate the glass.",
        "Pace Consideration: Utah ranks 12th in pace, creating a faster tempo than the Knicks typically play (25th in pace). This pace-up environment could result in more rebounding chances overall."
