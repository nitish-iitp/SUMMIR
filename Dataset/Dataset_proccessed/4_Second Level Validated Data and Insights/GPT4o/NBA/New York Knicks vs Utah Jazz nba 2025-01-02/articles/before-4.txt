J. Hart ⬆️ 7.5 Rebounds (-125 @ DraftKings)

THE BOUNCE 📽️: 8.20 Rebs

Josh Hart has been on a rebounding tear recently, securing 11+ boards in each of his last four games and 8+ in six of his last eight outings. During this stretch, he’s averaging an impressive 9.3 rebounds per game. Hart is also highly involved on the glass, ranking second on the Knicks in rebounding chances per game (16.9), trailing only KAT over their last 10. His activity and instincts make him a consistent threat to crash the boards.

The matchup against the Utah Jazz offers additional upside for Hart's rebounding opportunities:

Utah’s Vulnerability to SG Rebounds: The Jazz allow the 13th most rebounds per game to opposing shooting guards.

Potential Absence of John Collins: Collins is listed as doubtful, which could weaken Utah's frontcourt presence and create more opportunities for Knicks players to dominate the glass.

Pace Consideration: Utah ranks 12th in pace, creating a faster tempo than the Knicks typically play (25th in pace). This pace-up environment could result in more rebounding chances overall.
