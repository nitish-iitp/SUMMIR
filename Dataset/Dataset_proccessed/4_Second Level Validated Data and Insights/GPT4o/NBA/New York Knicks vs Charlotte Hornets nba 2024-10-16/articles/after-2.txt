The New York Knickerbockers defeated the Charlotte Hornets by a final score of 111-105 last night, winning their fourth consecutive game to open up the 2024 NBA preseason.
They have one exhibition matchup remaining, on Friday against the Wizards, before the NBA season officially begins next Tuesday with a primetime contest against the defending champions in the Boston Celtics.

The preseason began on October 6th, with an away game in Charlotte. New York was right off the heels of a stunning blockbuster trade, having dealt fan favorites Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo to Minnesota for star big man Karl Anthony-Towns the week before. The team looked solid as they earned themselves a 111-109 victory to start off the preseason 1-0. The starters all played around fifteen minutes as this new look Knicks team looks to build their chemistry going into the regular season. Jaen Brunson finished with twelve points, and his new star teammate KAT finished with 10. Deuce McBride was impressive off the bench, scoring 22 in 25 minutes, along with three assists. Landry Shamet and Precious Achiuwa had 16 and 15 points, respectively, and rookie Tyler Kolek had a solid debut, finishing with 11. 

Then, the Knicks hosted their first preseason competition as the Wizards came to town on October 9th. After trailing at the end of the first quarter, the Knicks dominated throughout the rest of the game, winning 117-94. The starters all played 23 minutes or more as the chemistry on the court between them continued to develop. Karl Anthony-Towns showed out in his first performance in front of his new home crowd at the Garden, finishing with 25 points, 12 rebounds, and 2 assists. Brunson had 23, and Bridges had 16 in his first home game as a Knick. Rookie Tyler Kolek put up another impressive performance off the bench, scoring 15 in 17 minutes and five assists. 

Drama With an Old Friend

Sunday night’s game was highly anticipated, with many storylines surrounding it. The Knicks were set to take on the team who they had just a couple of weeks ago completed a shocking trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Knicks showed tribute videos to Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo on the big board at the Garden as they returned to New York as opponents for the first time since the deal was made. Brunson led the Knicks in scoring with 24, as the Knicks took down Minnesota by a final score of 115-110. KAT had an impressive performance against his former team, with 16 points and 16 rebounds, while Bridges and Anunoby scored 19 and 15, respectively.

Throughout the game, tensions were heightened for a preseason game. Early on, Donte DiVinzeno was seen yelling towards the Knicks bench, although it wasn’t entirely clear who he was speaking to or what was said. After the game was over, DiVincenzo was visibly frustrated, and the situation escalated. He exchanged words with Knicks assistant coach Rick Brunson. The two were separated, and DiVincenzo left shortly afterward.

When asked about what happened later in an interview, the T-Wolves sharpshooter responded:

“My relationship with Jalen is that of my brother and my best friend. That’s a separate relationship. I’ll talk about that privately and figure everything out. But it is what it is.”

Their most recent victory was last night’s home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets, which New York took 111-105 to improve to 4-0 this preseason. The regular starters did not play, giving others a chance to shine. Precious Achiuwa, a key part of the Knicks‘ success despite many injuries last season, finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds, leading the way to victory.

Deuce McBride continued to impress with 18 points and 5 assists, while new addition Cam Payne had 16 points and 8 assists of his own. 

The Journey Begins

Now, the Knicks look forward to a Friday night matchup in Washington to close out the preseason. New York hopes to go undefeated and head into the regular season on a high note. 

The 2024-2025 NBA season is the most highly anticipated campaign the Knicks have begun in over two decades.

This is a new-look team; the only remaining starter from the starting five on last year’s open day is Jalen Brunson.

It all begins next Tuesday night, as the Knickerbockers will travel to Boston to immediately face a big test in the form of the Boston Celtics, who are looking to defend their NBA title.

The Knicks, however, have their sights set on one of their own as they begin the quest toward their first championship in 52 years.
