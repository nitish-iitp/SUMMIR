Takeaways

Cleveland: The Cavaliers are halfway through a brutal four-game West Coast road trip, and so far, so good for the team with the best record. Cleveland, which was coming off a 149-135 win against Denver on Friday, now looks ahead to road games against the Lakers on Tuesday and Dallas on Friday.

Golden State: After going 12-3 to start the season, Golden State is in a freefall after losing four of its last five games and 13 of 17.

Key moment

Garland picked off an errant Wiggins pass and scored on a layup to extend Cleveland’s lead to 44-36 with just under two minutes in the first half. That sequence set the tone for decisive 20-5 run that put the game out of reach late in the third quarter.
