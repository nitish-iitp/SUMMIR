Anthony Edwards led the Minnesota Timberwolves to a resounding victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, scoring a game-high 37 points. Edwards' exceptional three-point shooting, including nine threes, proved too much for the Blazers' defensive strategy. Despite concerns about his high volume of three-point attempts, Edwards remains confident in his shot selection and his ability to score effectively.

The Minnesota Timberwolves won with a 127-102 score over Portland Trail Blazers. Anthony Edwards scored 37 points mostly on nine threes. His opponents even allowed him to shoot over a dozen three-point attempts, but he did not expect the strategy of the opposition defense-to screens on him and was locked inside, but he was committed in shooting the ball and never took a downhill drive to the basket.

Anthony Edwards addressed concerns about taking too many threes per game
One of the bright stars of T-Wolves, Anthony Edwards, who tried 15 three-pointers against the Blazers, is very confident on a total of 12-21 from the field. “Mike be trying to tell me like, ‘Get downhill.’ I’m like, bro, they’re going under me. I work on my game too much to try to force going downhill if they keep going under…”, Edward said. “I really be surprised at this point. I made like two threes in the first quarter today and then in the third…I came out and made one and they just kept going under. I’m like, alright, I’mma keep shooting this b**ch.”
Edwards' top-notch shooting accuracy is being questioned due to the strategy of defenders under screens allowing him too much time to shoot the ball, despite his top-notch shooting accuracy. Ant recently addressed concerns about taking too many threes per game. He quipped, “F**k ‘em.”

The UNSTOPPABLE Edwards has been sinking 50 threes in the first nine games of the season, and he becomes only the second player to have achieved it after Stephen Curry. There's a dream run capitalizing on the three-point shooting trend that literally has become the primary scoring technique in the league. That will be making those numbers from last season attained in the middle part of the season unless teams come up with a plan to stop him.


A brief on Anthony Edwards career
Anthony Edwards is a consensus five-star, top-five recruit in the country in the 2019 class according to the major recruiting services, 247Sports, ESPN, and Rivals. He signed with Georgia to play college basketball for the Bulldogs on February 11, 2019. The signee became the best recruit for the Georgia program in the modern recruiting era.
Edwards had offers from multiple top schools in the country for his services and committed with the Bulldogs over those suitors, including Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina. He immediately flocked to Georgia because he was going to follow his two favorites, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, who were being developed in college by head coach Tom Crean.
Edwards played for the US National Team in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The guard had played all eight games there and was selected to an All-FIBA World Cup Team. He was the U.S. team's leading scorer with 18.9 points per game. The team finished fourth. He was selected for the 2024 Olympic team. In winning the gold medal for Team USA, he played in six games, averaging 12.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 58 percent from the field.
