On Friday night, the Minnesota Timberwolves played against the Portland Trail Blazers at the Target Center. The Timberwolves won the game 127-102, bringing their record to 6 wins and 3 losses.

It was a great team victory. Anthony Edwards was the star of the game, scoring 37 points and adding six rebounds, five assists, one steal, and one block. He shot 12 out of 22 from the field and made 9 of 15 three-point shots in just 30 minutes on the court.

Edwards also made history by setting a record for the most three-pointers made in the first nine games of a season, with 50. He is now third on the all-time list for most three-pointers in that span: 1. Stephen Curry – 55 three-pointers (2018-19) 2. Stephen Curry – 53 three-pointers (2023-24) 3. Anthony Edwards – 50 three-pointers (2024-25)

Edwards did this without playing in the fourth quarter during the game. So far this season, Edwards has been doing great, averaging 29 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game. His shooting percentage is 48.9% from the field and 48.1% from three-point range.

Next, the Timberwolves will face the Miami Heat on Sunday at the Target Center. Anthony Edwards was the first pick in the 2020 NBA Draft after one year in college at Georgia. He is a two-time All-Star and helped lead the Timberwolves to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2004. He also won a gold medal with Team USA at the 2024 Olympics in Paris over the summer.
