Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 16 points. Anfernee Simons had 14 and Robert Williams III added 13 points.

Takeaways

Trail Blazers: Portland was playing its eighth game in seven different cities in 13 days, and it showed. Coming off a loss at San Antonio on Thursday night, the Blazers were flat from the start, falling behind by 27 in the second quarter. However, the Blazers are getting healthier, as Williams made his season debut and Shaedon Sharpe played his second game of the year.

Timberwolves: Third in the league in 3-point shooting, the Wolves were clicking from beyond the arc once again. They made a season-high 22 3s on 50 attempts.

The Blazers return home to face Memphis on Sunday, and the Timberwolves host the Heat on Sunday.
