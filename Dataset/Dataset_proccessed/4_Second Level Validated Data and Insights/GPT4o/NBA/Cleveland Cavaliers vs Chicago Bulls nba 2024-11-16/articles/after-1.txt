Takeaways

Bulls: The league’s fastest-paced team by most offensive metrics had too many rushed shots and poor possessions to pull off the win.

Cavaliers: At home. On the road. Short-handed. It doesn’t matter. They’re playing with energy and a connectivity that’s only building their confidence and trust in Atkinson, who inherited a great situation and is only making it better.
