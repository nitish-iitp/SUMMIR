Jackson Flickinger is a lawyer who's been blogging about the Cavs for a decade (including as a member of the credentialed local media) and the editor-in-chief of Fear the Sword.

The Cleveland Cavaliers can’t stop winning games, but that doesn’t mean head coach Kenny Atkinson has liked everything he’s seen along the way. This has included needing assistant coach DeMarre Carroll to save him from “ripping” the team after a bad second half in a game they were up by 41 at one point against the Golden State Warriors. Friday’s incident continued that theme.

The Cavs scored 77 in the first half, but that doesn’t mean much when you give up 73 on the other end. According to Donovan Mitchell, this caused Atkinson to take his frustrations out on a flip-flop.

“He came in here at halftime and slammed a little flip-flop because he was upset because we gave up 73 points,” Mitchell said.

Ty Jerome wouldn’t corroborate Mitchell’s story when Mitchell yelled for backup in the middle of the interview.

Although it’s funny to picture this, Mitchell has repeatedly said throughout the year that he wants a coach who coaches him hard like Atkinson has.

“When you’re playing, you hear how good you are,” Mitchell said. “You hear about the streaks. You hear about all the positives. ... [Coaching us hard] is what we want. I think we all prefer to hear how good we are on a daily basis, and sometimes we hear how bad we are when we miss a parley or whatever, but I think for us, that’s how you get better.”

Atkinson has heard and received this message.

“They always ask me, ‘Coach us harder,’” Atkinson said before the game against the Chicago Bulls. “‘Hey coach, you showed too many positive clips.’ They want to know how they can get better. As a coach, I try to err on the side of positive.”

It’s hard to argue with the results so far. The Cavs keep winning and are making history along the way. And the only casualty so far may or may not have been a little flip-flop. That’s a sacrifice Mitchell seems willing to live with.

“How do you find ways to continue to build habits?” Mitchell said. “And it’s continuing to coach, coaching hard. And not letting room for any mental errors or any lapses.”
