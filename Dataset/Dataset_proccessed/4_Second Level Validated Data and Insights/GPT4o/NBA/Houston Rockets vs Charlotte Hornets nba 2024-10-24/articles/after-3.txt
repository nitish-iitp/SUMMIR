The Houston Rockets fell just short against the Charlotte Hornets in their electrifying NBA opener, losing 110-105.

Despite the defeat, Turkish star Alperen Şengün showcased his immense talent, delivering an impressive performance with 25 points, 18 rebounds, five assists, four steals and one block over 34 minutes of play.

While Şengün stole the spotlight, he was supported by Jalen Green, who netted 28 points, and Fred VanVleet, who contributed 14.

The Hornets were powered by LaMelo Ball’s stellar 34 points and 11 assists, along with Tre Mann’s 24 points and six rebounds, as they kicked off their season with a victory.
