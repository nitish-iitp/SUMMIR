In the second quarter, Austin Reaves was able to help Davis keep his rhythm flowing. Reaves served as the Lakers' primary ball handler in the middle of the second period. He consistently created opportunities for Davis as he found his big man open inside the paint multiple times. All five of Reaves' assists in the first half were to Davis.

Their efforts helped LA cut the lead to just 9 points with a 61-52 first-half finish. Come the third quarter, the LA Lakers managed to keep the game within reach. They secured a two-point 87-85 thanks to a flurry of threes from Austin Reaves and LeBron James. Reaves and Anthony Davis continued their two-man combo as “AR” kept finding the big man inside the paint.

Ultimately, the Lakers came up with a 123-116 victory. They achieved their first 2-0 start to their season since the 2010-11 season. Davis notched his second consecutive 30-point game with 35 points. The Lakers will now prepare to face the Sacramento Kings on Saturday as they hope to keep their winning steak alive.

It’s been a while since fans have seen the LA Lakers have a hot start to their season. The Purple and Gold managed to fend off Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns on Friday. Anthony Davis carried the Lakers for the second straight game, putting up 35 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two blocks and one steal.

All the other Lakers starters, except for D’Angelo Russell, stepped up to help their star big man. Austin Reaves had a huge 26-point game and should be applauded for feeding Davis the entire night. Their one-two punch combo inside the paint was a huge factor in why LA successfully defended home court.

LeBron James also facilitated a lot on Friday after dishing out eight assists matched with 21 points. As for Rui Hachimura, he put in an effort to help the starters with 14 points and seven rebounds.

After the Lakers defeated two of the best teams in the Western Conference, this might be the confidence booster they need to consistently win this season.
