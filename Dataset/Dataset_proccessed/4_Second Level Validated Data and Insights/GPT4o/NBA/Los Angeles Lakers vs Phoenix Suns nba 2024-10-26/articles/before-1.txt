The LA Lakers survived a first-quarter burst from the Phoenix Suns and rallied from a 22-point deficit to win 123-116 on Friday. Anthony Davis, Rui Hachimura and Austin Reaves carried the hosts in the first half before LeBron James joined the party. LA's defense stepped up to slow down the Suns before the offense took over.

The Suns opened the game with eight triples and 14 dimes, but couldn't sustain their fiery start. Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker combined for 67 points, 19 assists and eight rebounds. The starters had an impressive night but coach Mike Budenholzer hardly got anything from the bench.
