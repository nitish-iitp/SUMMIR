PHILADELPHIA — Tyrese Maxey scored the go-ahead basket with 23.7 seconds left and finished with 29 points to lead Philadelphia to a win over Washington.

Guerschon Yabusele scored 21 points and blocked a potential tying layup with 14 seconds left to preserve the win for the Sixers.

Joel Embiid, Paul George, Kyle Lowry and Andre Drummond all sat out for Philadelphia while Washington played without leading scorer Jordan Poole and Malcolm Brogdon.

With so many key starters out and both teams well under .500, there was a pre-season vibe at the Wells Fargo Center until the Wizards made a serious run in the fourth.

CLEVELAND — Jarrett Allen scored 25 points, Evan Mobley added 21 and Cleveland ended Oklahoma City’s 15-game winning streak by beating the Thunder in a marquee meeting between the NBA’s top two teams.

The Cavs extended their winning streak to 11, improved the league’s best record to 32-4 — 11-0 against the West — and moved to 19-1 at home. They did it on an off night for leading scorer Donovan Mitchell, who had just 11 points on 3 of 16 shooting.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points and Jalen Williams had 25 for the Thunder in their first loss since Dec. 1.

While it’s only January and there’s a lot of basketball ahead, the game’s intensity had the all vibes of a Finals matchup in June. There were 30 lead changes and neither team led by more than nine.
