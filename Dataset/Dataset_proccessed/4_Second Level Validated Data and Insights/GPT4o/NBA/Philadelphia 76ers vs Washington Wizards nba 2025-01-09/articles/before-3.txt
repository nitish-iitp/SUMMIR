Forty-eight minutes of basketball were played in South Philadelphia Wednesday night. Whether it qualified as NBA basketball remains to be seen.

Without Joel Embiid and Paul George, the Sixers just escaped with a 109-103 win over the Washington Wizards.

After a slow first half, Tyrese Maxey finished strong again to lead all scores with 29 points. He did shoot 11-of-27 from the field and 3-of-14 from three.

Guerschon Yabusele had one of his best games of the year, finishing with 21 points on 6-of-11 shooting. He also had eight rebounds and two blocks, including one that put the game away.
