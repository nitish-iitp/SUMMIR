        "Suns: Phoenix continues to create consternation over what\u2019s wrong. Booker, Durant and Bradley Beal were supposed to form the nucleus of a title contender.

        "Pacers: Indiana has finally started playing the way it envisioned over these past 11 games. Haliburton is in sync, the defense has improved and the Pacers have won eight times during that span to reach .500."
