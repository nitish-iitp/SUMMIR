NBA fans are ready to give up on the Phoenix Suns after they lost their fourth game in a row on Saturday against the Indiana Pacers. The Suns dropped to 15-18 for the season and have been linked to a potential trade for Jimmy Butler of the Miami Heat.

Phoenix began their three-game road trip with a disappointing performance in Indianapolis. The Suns barely put up a fight in the second half as the Pacers cruised to a 126-108 win. Kevin Durant had 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, while Devin Booker put up 20 points, eight rebounds and nine assists.

The Suns' losing streak began after Christmas when they lost to a Luka Doncic-less Dallas Mavericks. They then lost to the Golden State Warriors and the Memphis Grizzlies to finish 2024 on a sour note. They followed it up with another defeat to start the new year in Indianapolis.

The trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal are heading to another underwhelming campaign. The Phoenix Suns have been linked to Jimmy Butler of the Miami Heat, but many NBA fans are losing confidence in KD and Co. already.

"Jimmy Butler isn’t saving this team nor trading for a center. It’s time to trade KD and Book and start a rebuild," a fan wrote.
"Just start the rebuild man. Sucks that their 9-2 start was f*cked up by injuries tho, they just wont find their groove again," one fan claimed.
"Blow it up! Their stuck in mid land," another fan commented.

With a 15-18 record, the Phoenix Suns are 12th in the Western Conference. They entered the season with a lot of expectations but have been one of the most inconsistent teams in the NBA.

"Shoulda never traded Chris Paul lol been all down hill from there," a fan tweeted.
"Find a way to get rid of Beal, and I promise this team takes off," one fan suggested.
"Send KD back to GS!!! They got a couple of young players that could mesh with Book," another fan remarked.

Things get a little bit easier in Phoenix's next two games against the Philadelphia 76ers and Charlotte Hornets. The Sixers are playing better recently but are still inconsistent, while the Hornets are one of the worst teams in the NBA this season.

Will the Suns make a move before the trade NBA deadline?

The Phoenix Suns have more than a month left to observe their roster and possibly make a move at the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 7. One of the players linked to the Suns is Jimmy Butler, who has requested a trade out of the Miami Heat.

Bradley Beal matches Butler's contract, but ESPN's Bobby Marks reported that Miami has no intention of acquiring Beal. The Suns will have to find a third team to make the trade even remotely possible.
