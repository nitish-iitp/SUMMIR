        "Kawhi Leonard is back and gets a matchup against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday. One thing noticed so far is that Kawhi\u2019s shot diet has been a bit different since his return as he eases back into action. Through two games he is taking 48% of his shots from beyond the arc and they are entirely above the break 3s. That is a 21% jump from last season and he has not been above 30% since his sophomore season (31%). Despite the previous lack of volume, he is an excellent 3 point shooter. The last 3 seasons he\u2019s shot over 40% from deep. This swing is in an effort to reduce the wear and tear on his lower body. This matchup against Denver is fine too - they allow a moderate amount of 3s in terms of frequency and percentages."
