Boston Celtics vs OKC Thunder preview

This highly anticipated matchup brings together two dominant forces from their respective conferences.

The Celtics (26-9) enter the contest on a three-game winning streak, including two emphatic victories — a 54-point blowout of the Toronto Raptors and a 23-point win over the Houston Rockets. They boast the league’s second-best offense, trailing only the Cleveland Cavaliers, who hold the NBA’s top record.

Additionally, Boston has the third-best net rating, following the Thunder and Cavaliers, with all three teams being the only ones to maintain double-digit net ratings.

Meanwhile, the Thunder (29-5) recently staged a comeback win against the New York Knicks, overcoming a 14-point deficit to claim a 117-107 victory and extend their winning streak to 14 games — a franchise record.

OKC’s success is driven by the brilliance of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who delivered 33 points and seven assists in their latest win. The Thunder lead the league in net rating (12.1), anchored by their top-ranked defense (102.9 defensive rating), and remain unbeaten against Eastern Conference opponents.

Boston Celtics vs OKC Thunder predicted starting lineups

For the Thunder, Alex Caruso (hip), Ajay Mitchell (toe), Chet Holmgren (hip) and Nikola Topic (ACL) are all out. Ousmane Dieng and Dillon Jones are out as they are assigned to the G League, while Branden Carlson is probable, also on a G League assignment.

For the Celtics, Jaylen Brown is questionable due to a shoulder injury. JD Davidson, Drew Peterson, Baylor Schelerman and Anton Watson are all out as they are assigned to the G League.

Thunder

G - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander | G - Cason Wallace | F - Lu Dort. | F - Jalen Williams | C - Isaiah Hartenstein

Celtics

G - Derrick White | G - Jrue Holiday | F - Sam Hauser | F - Jayson Tatum | C - Kristaps Porzingis

Editor's note: These are the predicted lineups and could change based on the availability of players.

Boston Celtics vs OKC Thunder betting props
Jayson Tatum to score over 25.5 points is -105 on DraftKings. Expect him to hit this mark.
Isaiah Hartenstein scoring over 11.5 points is -120 on FanDuel. Expect him to clear this.
Boston Celtics vs OKC Thunder prediction

This showdown is expected to be a closely contested battle. While the Celtics might be without Jaylen Brown and the Thunder will miss key role players Alex Caruso and rookie Ajay Mitchell, OKC’s depth and home-court advantage could prove decisive.

Expect the Thunder to edge out a narrow victory, with Jalen Williams stepping up against Boston’s defense. While the Celtics’ defensive efforts may limit Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Williams has the potential to take charge and guide the Thunder to another impressive win.
