The NBA's Last Two Minute Report from Saturday's overtime game between the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors disclosed several incorrect calls.

This included one on the final shot of the game, as the report revealed that Celtics star Jayson Tatum traveled during his buzzer-beating three-pointer that gave Boston a 126-123 win.

However, the report also stated Raptors guard Davion Mitchell should have been whistled for a foul on Celtics star Jaylen Brown after the two made contact prior to Tatum's shot.

There were also multiple incorrect calls at the end of the fourth quarter, per the report. On Toronto's final possession in regulation, center Jakob Poeltl turned the ball over with a pass out of bounds.

Tatum should have been called for a foul on Poeltl prior to the turnover, but the center also committed a three-second violation that wasn't whistled.

There were missed calls on both teams in pivot moments during the contest, but the Celtics ultimately emerged victorious with the game-winning three by Tatum.

Poeltl finished with a career-high 35 points for Toronto, pulling down 12 rebounds while connecting on 16 of his 19 shots. RJ Barrett recorded his first triple-double in the NBA during the defeat, registering 25 points and 15 assists in addition to 10 rebounds.
