PHOENIX – The Utah Jazz kept it close with the Phoenix Suns in Footprint Center on Saturday but ultimately came up a bit short in a 114-106 loss.

Phoenix led by as much as 16 in the game and Utah never held a lead. However, they cut the deficit down to one point in the third and looked poised to turn things around at multiple points throughout the game.

Lauri Markkanen led the way for Utah with 24 points. Collin Sexton and Walker Kessler were the next highest scorers with 20 and 16 respectively.

The Jazz will return to Delta Center for a two-game homestand to host the Nets and the Hornets.

First Quarter

The @Utahjazz are 1-7 from the floor to open the game.

Lauri Markkanen has the only Jazz basket as they trail the @suns 8-2 with 8:35 left in the first quarter. #TakeNote

It always feels like Lauri Markkanen needs to mentally time his blocked shots, then jump a half-second earlier than he thinks.

He challenges a lot of shots but gets bizarrely few blocks for an uber-athletic seven-footer.

I don’t think it’s effort, I think it’s timing.

Some good early moments from the @utahjazz
rookies.

Flip has created two transition baskets with active hands on the perimeter, and Cody Williams showing some crafty footwork to get to his mid-range J.

Both of those guys did a lot of this stuff in college.

After one the @utahjazz trail the @suns 31-27.

Clunky start, but the Jazz got a nice spark from the second unit to keep this game close. #TakeNote pic.twitter.com/8fGmgMWcuM

The @utahjazz trimmed the @suns lead to as few as one, but Phoenix rallied for a quick six points and own a 75-68 lead with seven minutes left in the third.

Through three the @utahjazz trail the @suns 87-79.

That might have been the best quarter of Cody Williams career so far.

A lot of simple read-and-react decisions offensively, and good use of his length on defense.

He’s gotten a lot better.

Jazz fans are going to have a lot of fun watching Taylor Hendricks and Cody Williams play together with their length and skill for several years to come.

Gotta have size in the NBA, and you find it in the lottery.

— Ben Anderson (@BensHoops) January 11, 2025

Good learning moment from Elijah Harkless, you can’t let NBA shooters like Grayson Allen have any space.

You have to be up and over the screen if the scouting report requires it.

Will Hardy challenged an out-of-bounds call against the Jazz.

Unsuccessful challenge, and it turned into a foul for Kessler and two free throws for Beal.

Tough lol.
