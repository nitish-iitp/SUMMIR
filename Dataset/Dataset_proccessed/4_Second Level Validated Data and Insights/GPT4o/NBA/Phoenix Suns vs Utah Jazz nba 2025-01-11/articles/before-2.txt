37-24 in Last 61 NBA Player Props Picks
Prop's Analysis:

B365/ESPN (-125). Would bet this up to over 22.5. Walker Kessler has cleared this line in 14 of his last 19 games. The Jazz will once again be without John Collins today, and Kessler has surpassed this line in 7/9 without his frontcourt counterpart. The Suns have struggled all season against centers, allowing the second most points + rebounds.
