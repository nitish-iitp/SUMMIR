The Phoenix Suns are three games above .500 at home and are a half-game behind San Antonio for tenth place in the Western Conference standings. The Suns (17-19) rank tenth in the league in offensive efficiency and are scoring 112.1 points per contest. On Thursday, Phoenix outscored Atlanta by ten points in the third quarter to pull away for a 123-115 home victory. 

Bradley Beal led all scorers with 25 points (11-16 FG) and seven rebounds in 33 minutes off the Phoenix bench. Kevin Durant and Grayson Allen scored 23 points apiece on a combined 16-for-23 from the field. All-Star G Devin Booker added 20 points and 12 assists for the Suns. 

Jazz vs Suns Prediction

Phoenix F Royce O’Neale is recovering from a left ankle sprain and will likely remain sidelined for this contest. The Suns rank 24th in the league in defensive efficiency, which makes them hard to trust as a big favorite. The Jazz rank last in the league in defensive efficiency, so take the over. Final Score Prediction, Phoenix Suns win 124-113.
