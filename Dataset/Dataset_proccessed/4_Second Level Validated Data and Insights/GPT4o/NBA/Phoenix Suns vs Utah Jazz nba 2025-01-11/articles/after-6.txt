Phoenix Suns vs Utah Jazz: Previous matchups

The last game between the Jazz and the Suns took place on December 13, 2024. The Suns won that game with an eight-point margin. But, it is very concerning that they ended up giving away 126 points against a weak offense like that of the Jazz. This upcoming match will be the third meeting of this season between the Suns and the Jazz. So far, the Suns have won both of their games against Utah.

Jazz vs Suns game prediction



The Suns have too much quality on their roster to drop a game to a team as weak as the Utah Jazz. They’ve won both of their games against Utah this season and it wouldn’t surprise anyone if the Suns end up sweeping the season series. We predict that the Suns will win this game in dominant fashion
Our Prediction: The Suns will win
