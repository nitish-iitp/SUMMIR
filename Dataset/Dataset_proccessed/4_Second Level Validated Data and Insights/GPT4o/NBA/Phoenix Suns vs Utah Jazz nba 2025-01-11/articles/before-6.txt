Suns vs Jazz Prediction

We know the Utah Jazz aren’t good, as they don’t play any defense. However, in what world are the Phoenix Suns deserving of double-digit chalk? The Suns have not only underachieved in terms of wins and losses, but they’re 13-23 ATS on the season. No team is worse at covering numbers in the NBA than the Suns. This will also be just the third time this season the Suns are double-digit favorites, and they’re 1-3 ATS in their last four games as a double-digit favorite. This line is showing the Suns respect they don’t deserve. Also, say what you will about the Jazz, but they’re 8-2 ATS in their last 10 games. The Jazz have seen seven of their nine wins come on the road. Give me the Jazz and the points.
