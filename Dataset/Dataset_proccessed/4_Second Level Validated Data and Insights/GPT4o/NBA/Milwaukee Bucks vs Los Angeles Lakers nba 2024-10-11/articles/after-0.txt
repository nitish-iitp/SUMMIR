Looking at LeBron James' stats tonight (Image Source: IMAGN)

LeBron James may have expressed some frustration about traveling to Milwaukee for the LA Lakers' third preseason game against the Bucks, but he suited up and played regardless, helping the Lakers notch a 107-102 win.

He’s coming off an impressive preseason debut, where he recorded 19 points, five rebounds and four assists in just 16 minutes during a 118-114 loss to the Phoenix Suns. James made history in that game by playing alongside his son, Bronny James, marking the first time a father-son duo shared an NBA court.

However, the duo didn’t play together tonight. LeBron, along with other starters, sat out after the first half, while Bronny entered during the second. "King James" finished with 11 points, six rebounds and four assists.

LeBron James voted 2nd-best leader in latest GM survey

LeBron James continued to impress league general managers, ranking highly in several categories, including leadership and position-specific accolades.

He was voted the second-best leader in the NBA, tied with New York’s Jalen Brunson at 23%, while Warriors star Steph Curry took the top spot with 33%.

James also tied with Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic and Phoenix Suns' Kevin Durant for the second-best small forward in the NBA at 17%, with Boston’s Jayson Tatum ranking first at 47%.

LeBron James, who will turn 40 in December, was also ranked No. 2 for most versatile player (20%) and best basketball IQ (30%). Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo and reigning MVP Nikola Jokic led those respective categories.

Entering his 22nd season, LeBron is more driven than ever, largely due to the opportunity to play alongside his son on the Lakers.

Speaking at the Lakers' media day, LeBron shared how Bronny’s presence motivates him.

“It's a pure joy to be able to come to work every day, put in the hard work, work with your son every day and be able to see him continue to grow,” James said.
“We push each other, he push me, I push him. We push our teammates and vice versa. So just a very joyous moment for not only for myself, but for our family,"he added.

The Lakers’ season opener is scheduled for Oct. 22 against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
