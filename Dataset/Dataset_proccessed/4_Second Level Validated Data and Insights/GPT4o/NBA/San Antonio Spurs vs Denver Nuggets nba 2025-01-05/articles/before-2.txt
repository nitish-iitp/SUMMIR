SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 46 points and 10 rebounds and the Denver Nuggets spoiled Victor Wembanyama’s 21st birthday on Saturday, beating the San Antonio Spurs 122-111 in overtime.

Wembanyma finished with 20 points and 23 rebounds for San Antonio, but was scoreless and without a rebound in OT. Wembanyama has 57 double-doubles in 101 career games.

The teams split the home-and-home series on consecutive nights. The Spurs won Friday's game 113-110 when Wembanyama stole the ball from Jokic with four seconds remaining and Vassell scored on a fastbreak layup.

Jokic made sure there were no such heroics Saturday, scoring nine points in the extra period.

Zach Collins and Russell Westbrook each received a technical foul in the first quarter after taunting one another, with Westbrook doing so from the bench.
