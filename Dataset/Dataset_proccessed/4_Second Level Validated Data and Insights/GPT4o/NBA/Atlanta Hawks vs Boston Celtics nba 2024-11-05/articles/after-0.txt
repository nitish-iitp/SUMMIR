'Headband Tatum' Leads Celtics to No-Sweat Win Over Hawks

Jayson Tatum broke out the headband in Hotlanta and he was nothing but a headache for the Hawks. As for his Celtics, they hardly broke a sweat Monday night.

Tatum erupted for 26 points in the first half, guiding Boston to a 22-point advantage at the break.  Its lead expanded to as many as 37 points in the second half before finishing with a 123-93 win – its first 30-point victory of the season.

Tatum continued his trend of fast starts, scoring 16 points in the first quarter. It marked the third time he’s reached that number in an opening frame in eight games this season. No other player in the league has done so more than once.

It also gave Tatum 106 first-quarter points on the campaign, which, at the time was 44 points more than the next-closest player on the leaderboard, Anthony Davis (62 first-quarter points).

Tatum needed to come out hot in this one since his scoring partner Jaylen Brown was sidelined for the second straight game with a strained left hip flexor.

 In past seasons, Brown has typically been the one to get off to fast starts, while Tatum would heat up gradually as the game wore on. So far this season, however, they’ve switched roles in that regard; Tatum has averaged a league-high 13.3 points per first quarter, accounting for nearly half of his scoring average, while Brown has spaced out his scoring more evenly across the game.

“I’m trying to start the game off more aggressive,” Tatum told NBC Sports Boston after the game. “In earlier years, I’ve been more relaxed or eased my way into the game, so just trying to change that a little bit.”

Tatum opened the game with a bang, scoring the first basket on a running dunk. After that, he was all about the 3-point shot. He knocked down 4-of-6 from 3-point range during the first quarter, and canned two more tricky triples in the second frame to make him 6-of-10 in the first half.

In the second half, Tatum became more of a facilitator. He scored just two points in the third quarter but handed out five of his nine assists during the frame. Boston built such a large lead by the end of the third, that he didn’t even step foot on the court for the final quarter. He finished with 28 points, nine assists, six rebounds, and two steals in 30 minutes of action.

As for the headband? It’s a running tradition between Tatum and Derrick White. Tatum said after the game that if one of them is feeling a headband game, they both must wear one in unison.

Tatum said he made the call on Monday; therefore, he and White made their headgear season debut. 

Fittingly, White produced an all-around masterpiece as well. He finished as the game’s second-leading scorer and assister behind Tatum with 21 points and six dimes. He also posted identical rebound and steal numbers as Tatum with six and two, respectively.

With numbers like those, Tatum and White may need to break out the headbands more often. The Celtics could use more of these no-sweat wins.
