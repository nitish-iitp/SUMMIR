The Celtics came close to never having star player Jayson Tatum. Here's why

It is no secret that Jayson Tatum is one of the most popular athletes in Boston right now.

As a five-time NBA all-star, Olympic gold medalist and of course, an NBA champion, Tatum has earned his star status among the city's many great athletes.

But did you know that the Boston Celtics almost never had the key player? In a recent episode of the Club 520 podcast with former Celtics teammate Jeff Teague, Tatum revealed that he wanted to trade to a different team after he was initially drafted.

Why did he stay? The city of Boston has Tatum's agent to thank.

Tatum was first drafted to the Boston Celtics at 19 years old in the 2017 NBA Draft. Although he received the third overall pick, Tatum explained in the podcast that he had some doubts for his rookie season.

As a big fan of Kobe Bryant, Tatum said he dreamed of playing for the Lakers, reflecting that it was "kind of devastating" not to be considered by the Los Angeles team who had their sights set on point guard Lonzo Ball.

Tatum moved on, looking into the Phoenix Suns before eventually landing in Boston. When he got there, however, he became concerned about playing time. Gordon Hayward, a small forward just like Tatum, had signed a 4-year deal for $128 million the same year. Tatum's initial reaction was to jump ship.

“I called my agent like ‘yo, I gotta get traded,'" he said on Teague's podcast. "I’m trying to play. I didn’t get drafted to come off the bench and not start."

Thankfully, Tatum's agent told him to relax, saying the Celtics are "a great organization" that would teach him to "play the right way," and Tatum listened.

“The rest was history, and it all worked out,” Tatum reflected - and it sure did. Eight seasons later, Tatum just agreed to the largest contract in NBA history - a five-year, $314m extension.
