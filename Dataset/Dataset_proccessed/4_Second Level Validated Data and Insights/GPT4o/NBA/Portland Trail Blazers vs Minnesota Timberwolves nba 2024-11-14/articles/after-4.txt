Greetings from North Portland! After the Trail Blazers followed up one of their worst performances with one of the best back-to-backs in recent memory, I had to get back in the podcast lab to record yet another edition of The Brief Case, which you can watch/listen/subscribe to below...

Topics on this, the 119th edition, include...

• Portland bouncing back from one of their worst losses in recent memory with back-to-back wins versus the Timberwolves

• Robert Williams III excites in his first game at Moda Center this season

• Donovan Clingan's 17-point, 12-rebound, 8-block coming out party in Wednesday's win versus the Timberwolves

• Shaedon Sharpe puts up 33 points and throws down a ridiculous dunk to secure the victory Wednesday night

• The Portland Trail Blazers sitting atop the Western Conference NBA Cup standings after one game in Group A play

• The official release of the Trail Blazers' 2024-25 City Edition jerseys

• Portland's record versus the spread and being ahead of schedule on the season win total
