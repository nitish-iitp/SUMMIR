Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets player stats and box score for Nov. 2 | 2024-25 NBA season

The Golden State Warriors survived in overtime as they edged past the Houston Rockets 127-121 at the Toyota Center on Saturday (Nov. 2). The win sees them open their five-game road stretch as they continue their run without superstar Steph Curry in the fold.

The Warriors stuck to their plans of getting Jonathan Kuminga off the bench again, with Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski forming the backcourt. At the same time, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green took over forward duties. Sharpshooter Buddy Hield came off the bench to provide the offensive spark as Golden State led 71-43 at halftime.

Houston was slow off the blocks allowing the Warriors to prop up an 18-point lead in the first quarter trailing by 28 points as they went into the half. But they capitalized on the Warriors' 18 missed free throws and sputtering offense to force an overtime contest tying 119-119 to end the fourth quarter.

Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets game recap

The Warriors were off to a solid start leading 71-43. However, timely bursts from Tari Eason (27 points) and Jabari Smith Jr. (21 points) saw the Rockets fight back into contention. Amen Thompson was another impact player off the bench with 18 points and 11 rebounds as Houston beat the Warriors 37-25 and 39-23 in the third and fourth quarters.

Golden State also botched their free throws as they missed 18, which eventually allowed the Rockets to get back into the contest. They lost the rebounding battle 49-47 and made just 64% of their shots from the charity stripe. Buddy Hield and Jonathan Kuminga came off the bench to prop up 27 and 23 points respectively. Draymond Green had 14 points and 11 rebounds, while Andrew Wiggins chipped in with 15 points and three rebounds.

The Warriors were helped by buckets from Kuminga and Anderson in overtime as they put some distance between the two teams. The Rockets were clearly out of juice and weren't able to get their shots to go in. The win sees the Warriors improve to 5-1, and they head to the Capital One Arena next to take on the Washington Wizards on Nov. 4. The Rockets host the New York Knicks, followed by the San Antonio Spurs.
