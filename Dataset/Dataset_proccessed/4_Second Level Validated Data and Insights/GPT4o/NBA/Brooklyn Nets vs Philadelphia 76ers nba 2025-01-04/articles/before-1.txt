Philadelphia 76ers vs Brooklyn Nets preview

The 76ers (13-19) and Nets (13-21) are positioned close together in the Eastern Conference standings, despite having different objectives. Philadelphia is in "win-now" mode after acquiring Paul George, but their goal remains distant, despite recent improvements.

Meanwhile, the Nets are in rebuilding mode, recently trading Dennis Schroder and Dorian Finney-Smith for assets.

In the last 10 games, as Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey have seen more time together, the 76ers have posted a top-10 offensive rating, though their defense remains in the bottom 10.

Embiid is averaging 24.1 points, 7.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists, while Paul George is averaging 16.3 ppg, his fourth-lowest in his career.

The 76ers have a long climb ahead in the standings, especially after a blowout loss to the Golden State Warriors in their last game.

The Nets have one of the league's worst defenses, and though they've fought hard, their primary aim is to secure a high draft pick.

They almost let a 24-point lead slip away against the Bucks on Thursday but managed to hold on for the win. Cam Johnson scored 26 points in the win but sustained an injury.

Philadelphia 76ers vs Brooklyn Nets predicted starting lineups

For the 76ers, Kelly Oubre is questionable due to a hand injury, while Joel Embiid is also questionable because of a foot injury. Jared McCain and Kenyon Martin are both out due to a meniscus issue and a foot injury, respectively.

For the Nets, De'Anthony Melton is out for the season with an ACL injury. Ben Simmons and Cameron Johnson are both questionable due to back and ankle injuries, respectively. Maxwell Lewis, Bojan Bogdanovic and Trendon Watford are out. Cam Thomas and Noah Clowney are also questionable due to hamstring and back injuries.
