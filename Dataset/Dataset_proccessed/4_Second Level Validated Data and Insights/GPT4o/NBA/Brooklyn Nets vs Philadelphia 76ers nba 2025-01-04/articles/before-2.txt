The Philadelphia 76ers and the Brooklyn Nets duke it out at the Barclays Center on Saturday night. Here’s a Philadelphia 76ers vs Brooklyn Nets Prediction. This article will include a Philadelphia 76ers vs Brooklyn Nets Pick.
Philadelphia 76ers 
The Philadelphia 76ers have been in decent shape as they've won six of their last nine games overall, but they will be hoping to avoid a third straight defeat after getting scorched by the Warriors in a 139-105 road defeat on Thursday. Joel Embiid led the team with 28 points and 14 rebounds, Paul George added 19 points while Tyrese Maxey chipped in with 14 points, six assists, and four steals. As a team, the 76ers shot 42 percent from the field and nine of 31 from the 3-point line as they struggled to contain the Warriors from the tipoff and were always fighting an uphill battle after getting outscored by 35-19 in the first quarter. Caleb Martin scored just two points on one of five shooting while Kyle Lowry scored just two points in 10 minutes of action, but the problems were on the defensive end as they allowed at least 33 points in each quarter. 
Brooklyn Nets 
Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Nets have been in a slump as they've lost eight of their last 11 games overall, but they will be eager to build some momentum after sneaking past the Bucks in a thrilling 113-110 road win on Thursday. Cameron Johnson led the team with 26 points on 10 of 16 shooting, Cam Thomas added 24 points in just 22 minutes off the bench, Nic Claxton tallied 16 points with 11 rebounds while D'Angelo Russell chipped in with 11 points and 12 assists. As a team, the Nets shot 43 percent from the field and 12 of 39 from the 3-point line as they jumped all over the Bucks in the first half to take an early 24-point lead. That proved to be just enough in the end, as the Bucks cut the lead to just one point with 37.1 seconds left on the clock. 
Why the Philadelphia 76ers will win
The Nets have lost each of their last 10 games as home underdogs after winning as underdogs.
The 76ers have won each of their last 14 Saturday games as road favorites.
The Nets have failed to cover the spread in nine of their last 10 games as home underdogs against Atlantic Division opponents.
The 76ers have covered the spread in each of their last four games against Eastern Conference opponents following a loss.
Total Points Facts
Nine of the 76ers' last 10 games as road favorites following a road loss have gone OVER the total points line.
Each of the Nets' last three home games against the 76ers following a road win have gone UNDER the total points line.
Philadelphia 76ers vs Brooklyn Nets Prediction
The 76ers are still missing Kelly Oubre Jr, and they have Joel Embiid listed as questionable, while the Nets are still missing Cameron Johnson and they have Cam Thomas listed as questionable for this one. This is definitely a game where you want to check the lineups before tipoff as a few injuries could really sway the line in this matchup. The 76ers were starting to build some momentum before they got embarrassed by the Warriors in their last outing, while the Nets were ice-cold before their surprising win over the Bucks. I understand why the 76ers are still favorites on the road, but I just don't feel they should be favored by so many points. I am looking at the Nets to keep this one close and get the cover in the end.
