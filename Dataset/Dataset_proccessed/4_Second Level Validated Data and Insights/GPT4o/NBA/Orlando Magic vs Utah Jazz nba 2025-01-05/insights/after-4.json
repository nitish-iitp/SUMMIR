        "Jazz picked up two victories in 24 hours in Florida, and they did it without most of their starting lineup. Lauri Markkanen, John Collins and Keyonte George, each of whom played 26 minutes or more on Saturday, did not play Sunday.",
        "With Jalen Suggs joining Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Mo Wagner on the injured list, the Magic played without their top four scorers. Suggs, who strained his back on Friday night, missed his third game of the season. Banchero, who has missed 32 games with a torn oblique, is expected to play soon."
