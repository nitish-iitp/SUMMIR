Klay Thompson and the Dallas Mavericks hosted the Orlando Magic on Sunday. The Mavericks came from an upsetting loss against the Houston Rockets and hoped to get back in the win column against the Magic. Looking at Klay Thompson's performance last game, he struggled to get a basket to go. Heading into their game against Orlando, he hoped to make a difference.

However, it wasn't Thompson's night after a low-scoring performance with inefficient shooting splits. Here are his final stats of the night:

In the second quarter, Thompson finally got a shot to go but struggled to sink his next few attempts. Fortunately for him, he was able to contribute in other ways to the Mavericks. Klay added two rebounds, two assists, one steal, and one block to help his team. Dallas ended the first half with a huge 65-40 lead.

This is thanks to Luka Doncic’s unstoppable offense. The fire he caught in the first quarter didn’t go away in the second. Doncic added 11 more points and shot an accurate 60% from the field in the first half.

Come the third quarter, Klay Thompson managed to drain a few shots from mid-range. However, he continued to struggle from beyond the arc and missed all two of his attempts in the third.

Fortunately, his ice-cold shooting didn’t affect the Dallas Mavericks as they increased their lead to a 27-point deficit. Ultimately, it was the Mavericks who came out on top 108-85. Thompson finished the game with nine points, five rebounds, four assists, and two blocks.

Nevertheless, the Mavericks dominated the Orlando Magic on Sunday after coming up with a 108-85 victory. As usual, Luka Doncic comes through for Dallas as he nearly finished the game with a triple-double. Doncic put up 32 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists, matched with 50% shooting from the field overall.

The Mavs center Daniel Gafford contributed big time for the team as well. Gafford nearly notched a double-double with 18 points and eight rebounds. He was unstoppable inside the paint throughout the game.

His steady 69.2% shooting is what helped the Mavericks solidify their inside game. Two other Mavericks players were in double-scoring figures. These were namely Kyrie Irving (17 points) and Dereck Lively II (11 points and 11 rebounds). Dallas will take on the Indiana Pacers next and will hope to take advantage of their momentum.
