Doncic scored 14 points in the first quarter to help the Mavericks to a 30-22 lead and they were 65-40 ahead at the break.

The 25-year-old Slovenian scored 25 first-half points, including five three-pointers.

“Today was real fun,” he said. “We were guarding everybody, defending, rebounding, playing with a lot of pace. So that’s fun for me.”

Dallas maintained their momentum in the second half and stretched their advantage to 82-52 on Doncic’s free throw with six minutes and five seconds to play in the third quarter and they led by as many as 33 points during the fourth quarter.

Daniel Gafford scored a season-high 18 points for Dallas while Kyrie Irving added 17 and Dereck Lively II had 11 points and 11 rebounds.

It was a third defeat in a row for Orlando who made just eight of 41 three-point attempts and are currently without All-Star forward Paolo Banchero, who has an abdominal muscle injury and is set to miss at least the next four weeks.

Elsewhere, the Detroit Pistons bounced back from a 30-point loss to the New York Knicks on Friday to claim their second victory of the season with a 106-92 success against the Brooklyn Nets.

In New Orleans, Jalen Johnson scored 29 points and Trae Young added 23 points, four rebounds, 12 assists and a steal as the Atlanta Hawks won 126-111 to hand the injury-hit Pelicans their first home defeat of the season.

Brandon Ingram led scoring for the Pelicans with a game-high 32 points.
