The LA Lakers ended a two-game losing streak on Friday with a 116-106 victory against the Philadelphia 76ers. LA needed a triple-double from LeBron James and a 31-point night from Anthony Davis to hold off their visitors. Philly faced the hosts without the suspended Joel Embiid and the injured Tyrese Maxey.

James, who didn't score in the first quarter, finished with 21 points, 13 assists, 12 rebounds and three blocks. The Lakers also got solid production from D'Angelo Russell who was benched by JJ Redick to start the game. "D-Lo" responded with 18 points, three assists and two rebounds.

The gritty 76ers got contributions from across the roster to give the home team a fight. Andre Drummond and Caleb Martin combined for 27 points, 15 rebounds, five assists and three steals. Rookie Jared McCain arguably had his best game this season with 18 points, three rebounds and two assists.
