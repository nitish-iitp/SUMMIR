LOS ANGELES LAKERS
LeBron James' Triple-Double in Year 22 Wows NBA Fans as Lakers Beat George, 76ers

Returning to Los Angeles after a five-game road trip was exactly what the Lakers needed to get back on track, as LeBron James recorded a triple-double in a 116-106 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.

You would never know James was in his 22nd NBA season and seven weeks away from his 40th birthday. He finished with 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting, 13 assists and 12 rebounds in 34 minutes to earn his 41st triple-double as a member of the Lakers.

James has been on a heater to start the season. He has ceded some of his scoring output to elevate Anthony Davis, but the level of efficiency he's playing with his incredible at this stage of his career.

Davis continues to be unstoppable when he plays. He had 31 points, nine rebounds and four blocks against the Sixers. The Lakers forward has scored at least 30 points in six of his eight games played.

James received a heap of praise for what he did to help the Lakers get back on track after losing four of their last five games.

LeBron in October: 21/7/7 on 49/39/77<br>LeBron in November: 27/8/10 on 56/56/81<br><br>New year, same story. It was fun seeing everyone overreact, though. <a href="https://t.co/omDJOx4sTw">https://t.co/omDJOx4sTw</a> <a href="https://t.co/HIVMb2xecr">pic.twitter.com/HIVMb2xecr</a>

The 76ers aren't really in position to challenge anyone right now, as they fell to 1-7 with the loss. They once again played without Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, resulting in a rather lifeless performance from the offense.

Paul George had an abysmal shooting game with just nine points on 4-of-13 shooting (0-of-8 from three-point range). He did have eight assists, but it wasn't nearly enough to overcome the onslaught from James and Davis.

JJ Redick's formula for the Lakers really isn't complicated. He is maximizing Davis' offensive ability, while letting James do what he's done for 22 years now. When that duo is on the floor together, the team is nearly unstoppable.

As long as both superstars can stay healthy all season, the Lakers will be in contention for a top six seed in the Western Conference and avoid the play-in tournament.

Next up for James and the Lakers is a home game against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday at 9:30 p.m. ET. Los Angeles defeated Toronto 131-125 at ScotiaBank Arena in the first meeting between these two teams this season on Nov. 1.
