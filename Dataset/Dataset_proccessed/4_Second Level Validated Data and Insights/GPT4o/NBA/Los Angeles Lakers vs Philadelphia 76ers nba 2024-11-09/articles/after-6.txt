LOS ANGELES LAKERS
Anthony Davis: Foot Injury 'Definitely Bothering Me' After Lakers' Win over 76ers

Los Angeles Lakers superstar big man Anthony Davis admitted Friday night that he is being hampered by a foot injury.

After registering 31 points, nine rebounds and four blocks in 116-106 home win over the Philadelphia 76ers, Davis told reporters:

"It hurts, definitely bothering me, but I'll figure it out. Getting it loose enough to go out there and play, and try to manage it throughout the course of the game so it doesn't tighten up. It felt good for the most part. … Off days are the most crucial to get it feeling good for game day."

AD has largely played through ailments so far this season, although he did sit out Wednesday's 131-114 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies due to a heel contusion.

Despite playing at less than 100 percent, Davis has to be considered an early-season MVP candidate by virtue of his league-leading 32.4 points per game to go along with 11.3 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 2.0 blocks and 1.4 steals.

He has also been as efficient as ever, shooting 56.9 percent from the field and 26.7 percent from beyond the arc.

Davis has always been a productive player when healthy, but injuries have often limited him. Before appearing in a career-high 76 games last season, Davis played in 56 or fewer games in each of the previous three campaigns.

During his six seasons with the Lakers, Davis is a three-time All-Star and he played a huge role in them winning an NBA championship in 2020, but he has usually been viewed as the No. 2 option behind LeBron James.

That hasn't been the case so far this season, though, as James' numbers have dipped a bit to the tune of 23.7 points, 8.1 assists and 7.4 rebounds per contest.

Davis becoming the No. 1 option over LeBron may be by design since James will turn 40 in December, and head coach JJ Redick undoubtedly knows the Lakers' best chance at playoff success is with a healthy James.

Having a healthy Davis will be equally important, though, which is why Redick and the Lakers brass must figure out the best way to manage the foot injury he is currently dealing with.

L.A. has had an up-and-down start to its 2024-25 campaign, winning each of its first three games before dropping four of the next five.

The Lakers are now 5-4, which is good for eighth place in the Western Conference.

In each of the past two seasons, the Lakers had to go through the postseason play-in tournament to reach the playoffs, so they would undoubtedly love to bypass that by finishing in the top six in the Western Conference this season.

The West is stacked and it won't be easy to go on a deep playoff run regardless, but a team with a healthy Davis and James would at least have a chance to make some noise.

The Lakers will be back in action Sunday against the Toronto Raptors, who have struggled to a 2-7 start.
