LOS ANGELES — Jalen Green scored 33 points and Amen Thompson added 23 points and 16 rebounds for the Houston Rockets, who held off LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, 119-115, in Houston on Monday (Manila time).

Fred VanVleet scored 15 points and stole the Lakers' inbounds pass intended for James with 5.7 seconds remaining and the Rockets up by three.

Fouled on the play, VanVleet made one of two free throws and the Rockets closed it out.

Anthony Davis scored 22 of his 30 points in the second half and grabbed 13 rebounds. James scored 21 points with 13 rebounds and nine assists but after falling behind by as many as 22 in the first half the Lakers couldn't get over the hump.

Trailing 67-49 at halftime, the Lakers stepped up their intensity in the third quarter and cut the deficit to two going into the fourth.

But Houston opened the final period on a 10-0 run and every time the Lakers got close managed to pull away again.

Meanwhile, the New Orleans Pelicans, fueled by 25 points from CJ McCollum and a triple-double of 14 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists from Dejounte Murray, beat the Wizards, 110-98, in Washington.
