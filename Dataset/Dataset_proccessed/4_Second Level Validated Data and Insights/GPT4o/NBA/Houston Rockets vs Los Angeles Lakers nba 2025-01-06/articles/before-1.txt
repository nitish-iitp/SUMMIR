But VanVleet stole the inbounds pass intended for James while the Lakers star was signaling for a timeout.

James addressed the referees not acknowledging his call for a timeout after the game.

"Max definitely still had the ball in his hands but it wasn't awarded," James told reporters. "That happens. We didn't lose the game because of that."

VanVleet made 1 of 2 free throws to secure the victory.

Russell Wilson 'not blinking' amid Steelers WR George Pickens' struggles
Russell Wilson is mitigating cause for concern surrounding WR George Pickens, who has struggled mightily these final few weeks.

Anthony Davis had 30 points and 13 rebounds for the Lakers. James added 21 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists.

Los Angeles used an 11-2 run, with six points from Davis, to get within two with 4 minutes to go. A dunk by Thompson started a 7-2 run that pushed Houston's lead to 115-108 with 2:30 minutes remaining.

The Rockets remained up by seven about a minute after that when a 3 by Davis cut the lead to 117-113 before the basket by James.

Takeaways

Lakers: Davis was dominant throughout this one but James struggled to get going early and had just five points at halftime.

Rockets: Thompson's performance Sunday was a good sign for Houston. The second-year player is starting in place of Jabari Smith Jr., who could be out up to two months after breaking a bone in his hand Friday.
