CJ McCollum #3 of the New Orleans Pelicans shoots a floater at Washington last season.
Behind the Numbers: Pelicans at Wizards (1/5/2025)

A look at three key numbers related to Sunday’s game in Capital One Arena between New Orleans and Washington (5 p.m. Central, GCSEN TV, WWL radio):

2: Rank among all NBA players in scoring average through the first four NBA nights of the 2025 calendar year for CJ McCollum (36.0 ppg). It took an overtime period Saturday for Denver’s Nikola Jokic (36.7) to inch ahead of McCollum on the new-year leaderboard. McCollum also ranks second behind only Jokic in scoring average over every team’s last four games, with the New Orleans shooting guard averaging 34.3 points on 57 percent shooting from the field and 51 percent three-point accuracy. Jokic has put up 36.5 points over Denver’s last four contests, on lesser efficiency (47 percent from field, 36 percent on threes) compared to McCollum’s recent offensive outburst.

5: New Orleans roster members who’ve scored 40-plus points in a game during their NBA career. McCollum is the only Pelican who has registered a 50-piece, having now done it two times (once with Portland in 2017, then Friday for New Orleans vs. Washington). The next-best career high among current Pelicans players is by forward Brandon Ingram, who piled up 49 points vs. Utah in a 2020 matchup. Next are Dejounte Murray (44 for Atlanta vs. Boston in 2024), Zion Williamson (43 vs. Minnesota in 2022) and Trey Murphy (41 vs. Portland in 2023). Coincidentally, Trey Jemison’s career high came against the Wizards, a 24-point output in March of last season, while Jemison was a Memphis center.

6: Rank among all NBA players (minimum average of 25 minutes per game) in assist-to-turnover ratio this season for Jose Alvarado, who has dished out 52 assists, but only turned the ball over 14 times in 2024-25. That ratio of 3.71 places Alvarado behind only Tyrese Haliburton (5.03), Tyus Jones (4.90), Chris Paul (4.79), Immanuel Quickley (4.75) and Fred VanVleet (3.96). Perhaps it was no coincidence that when the fourth-year point guard played Friday – in his first game since Nov. 11 – the Pelicans posted a turnover margin of plus-13 against Washington (only eight New Orleans turnovers; 21 by Washington). That was the club's best margin of the campaign, with their previous high being plus-nine vs. Chicago in the Oct. 23 season opener. That was the only previous game that New Orleans had both Murray and Alvarado in uniform.

Notes: Murray (elbow) is questionable. Ingram (ankle), Williamson (hamstring) and Karlo Matkovic (back) are out. … Brandon Boston ranks 17th in steals at 1.5 per game. The Pelicans are sixth in that category. … New Orleans and Washington have four of the top nine rookies in minutes played. Wizards guard Bub Carrington (959) tops the list, followed by Pelicans center Yves Missi (924). Washington first-year pros Alex Sarr (790) and Kyshawn George (685) are seventh and ninth, respectively. Missi’s 924 minutes leads the Pelicans, with Boston second at 807, then Murphy at 756. … New Orleans is trying to win consecutive games for the first time since Oct. 23 and 25, when it prevailed vs. Chicago and at Portland.

Marvin Bagley (knee) and Saddiq Bey (knee) are out. … Washington leads New Orleans in the all-time series 24-22, but the Pelicans have won three straight meetings, including a 2-0 sweep last season. That was NOLA’s first 2-0 sweep over Washington since 2010-11, when Willie Green was a guard for the then-Hornets. … Like New Orleans, Washington has won consecutive games only once this season, beating Atlanta on Oct. 28 and 30 in a home-and-home series.
