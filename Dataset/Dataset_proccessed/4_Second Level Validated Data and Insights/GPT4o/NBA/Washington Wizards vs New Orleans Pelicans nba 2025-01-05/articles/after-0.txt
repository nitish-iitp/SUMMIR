A New Orleans team weakness over the first two months of the season has suddenly become a major strength. In the NBA of 2024-25, it’s a category that has the power to swing a club’s success to a significant degree. The Pelicans were a bottom-tier three-point shooting squad through Christmas, but since the holiday they’ve transformed into elite. New Orleans drained 18 treys Sunday in our nation’s capital, the third time over the past week that the Pelicans made exactly that many in a game, a season high. The perimeter marksmanship vaulted New Orleans to a second straight victory for the first time since October, as the Pelicans built a double-digit first-half lead and were never seriously threatened by Washington after intermission.

THREE POINTS

More from McCollum.
Twelve-year NBA veteran guard CJ McCollum followed up his memorable 50-point Friday outing with 25 points Sunday, continuing to fire in three-point baskets at a rapid rate. McCollum shot 10/16 from beyond the arc Friday against Washington, and this time was 6/11. He also had an 8/14 outing Monday vs. the LA Clippers, the biggest reason why New Orleans’ offense is producing at a better clip over its last handful of games. “I’m just trying to be aggressive,” McCollum said in his TV walk-of interview. “We’re in a tough spot from a record standpoint. I’m trying to take advantage of the work I’ve been putting in. I’m trying to be as aggressive and efficient as possible to help us win.”
Murphy’s good news, bad news.
Pelicans TV analyst Antonio Daniels noted that Trey Murphy is the rare NBA player with the combination of skills that could allow him to win the dunk contest and the three-point contest on the same Saturday during All-Star weekend. Murphy backed up that opinion by throwing down three slams, as well as draining four trifectas (in 10 attempts), part of his 22-point game. Unfortunately all 22 points came in the first three quarters, because late in the third period he exited the game with a left ankle injury. He was ruled out shortly thereafter and did not return.
Dejounte triple-double.
Point guard Dejounte Murray has been a triple-double threat throughout his NBA career, but he notched his first as a Pelican on Sunday, finishing with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. Perhaps more importantly from a team perspective, Murray continues to improve his playmaking numbers, handing out a dozen dimes for a second straight game. Over the weekend pair of wins vs. Washington, he totaled 24 assists and five turnovers. He also had 15 assists early in the recent five-game homestand against Denver.

16, 7, 3: Points, rebounds and blocks for rookie center Yves Missi in his matchup against No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr of Washington. Missi on Sarr (18 points, 11 rebounds Sunday): “He’s a great player.”
