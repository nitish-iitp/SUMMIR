Wizards 'Flat' in Loss vs. Pelicans

The Washington Wizards couldn't come out on top in their 110-98 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night at home.

The Wizards fell behind early after a sizzling start from the Pelicans, who picked up right where they left off from Friday night's game in New Orleans.

Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma didn't like how the team played early on, and felt that it contributed to the loss.

“I think we just came out a little flat. We were a little tense at the beginning of the game when they got that lead out [in] the second quarter and we kind of played a little bit better from there, then had a couple lapses throughout. [We] stayed steady, but [we] need to be better still,” Kuzma said postgame.

The Wizards' problems throughout most of the year have been linked to being unable to piece together longer runs of consistent play. Teams that are towards the top of the league like the Oklahoma City Thunder and Cleveland Cavaliers play 48 minutes, or at least close to it, of high-quality, consistent basketball.

The Wizards find themselves doing that only a fraction of the time. It hurts especially when they don't start out strong, like they did against the Pelicans on Sunday night. When they go down early, it forces the Wizards to play behind the 8-ball all night long, and that's not good for anybody.

It creates poor possessions throughout the entire game and the Wizards don't get much value out of those.

If the Wizards want to be more competitive, they have to play well from the very beginning so they can keep teams on their toes for the remaining three quarters.

The Wizards' next game comes tomorrow when they take on the Houston Rockets. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET.

Josh Hart Hints At Knicks Locker Room Divide

Following the New York Knicks' 126-101 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night, the Knicks find themselves having lost four of their last five games. Prior to this skid, the Knicks had gone on a nine game winning streak. After Friday's loss, Josh Hart was asked if the Knicks have enough on their roster to compete against the NBA's best. "I think we do. We have to go out there with energy. We have to go out there with no egos. We have to go out there with no individual agendas. We have to go out there and sacrifice" Hart's answer was particularly interesting for some fans, as earlier in the week Hart had a similar message. On January 6, Hart told reporters: "It's an NBA season. There's going to be peaks and valleys. We've got to make sure we are focused and give off the right energy. We can't have our own individual agendas. Got to make sure we're locked in on this team". That's twice in one week that Hart has mentioned not having their own individual agendas. Is there trouble in paradise? Or, the Knicks locker room, for that matter, which over the last five games has seemingly been far from paradise. The Knicks are still on pace to top their 50-32 record from last season. The team made a number of additions this offseason, headlined by trades for Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges, with depth additions of Cameron Payne and Landry Shamet. Hart isn't the only one to mention agendas this season. In October, head coach Tom Thibodeau spoke of Hart. "That's what you love about him. There's no other agenda other than winning. Whatever you ask him to do, he's going to give you everything he has." Perhaps the phrase agendas is just one that's thrown around the locker room. Perhaps Hart is just speaking in team-oriented phrases. Or perhaps, where there's smoke there is fire. The Knicks continue their season on Sunday, when they'll take on the Milwaukee Bucks at home on the front end of a back to back, seeing the Detroit Pistons the next night.

Off-Ice 'Mess' Between Pastrnak and Marchand Gets Bad for Bruins

I won’t begin to pretend I know how plugged in this source is, but according to a report by Rich Keefe of the Jones Keefe show, the Boston Bruins aren’t just a mess on the ice, but they’re a “disaster” off of it. During a recent show, Keefe suggested he had a scoop on what was going on between two of the team’s top stars, David Pastrnak and Brad Marchand. It’s a bit similar to the kind of drama coming out of Vancouver over the past several weeks. Keefe noted: “First of all, what we can all see is that they’re a mess on the ice, right? They’ve lost six in a row. But what I’m hearing is they’re also a mess off the ice. Apparently, the locker room is a disaster.” He added that David Pastrnak is at the center of that and has told the team he doesn’t want to be on a line with Brad Marchand. Speculation is that it stems from Marchand calling out Pastrnak for some of his undisciplined and lazy play throughout the year. While Pastrnak is the team’s leading scorer and a 60-goal guy, the main reason why it is a disaster inside the locker room is that he doesn’t want to play with Marchand, and they’re not playing together (outside of some power play time). Keefe said the coach doesn’t have to do everything the player says, but it appears he’s trying to split them up. Keefe’s co-host said this kind of thing was on brand for the team as players have been called out in the past, Pastrnak a couple of times by former coach Jim Montgomery. They joked that Marchand was maybe a little mean to Pastrnak because he’d done something stupid in the defensive end or whatever else and it got called out. The hosts suggested he sometimes deserves to be called out for the plays he’s making. The shorthanded goal against this week was cited as one of the main reasons the Bruins have lost five in a row. “Maybe you can chalk it up as a player trying to do too much, or you can chalk it up to a player who just doesn’t care,” said Jones. So Now What for the Bruins? This has not been a good season for the Bruins, and it’s easy to see how locker-room drama can take on a life of its own in the NHL. Just look at what’s happening with the Canucks. Does that mean a trade is coming? It could. There was already talk of the Bruins potentially needing to make changes. But, would the Bruins really be willing to trade Pastrnak? He’s the team’s top forward. Like in Vancouver, where J.T. Miller is a vocal leader, Marchand isn’t afraid to speak his mind in Boston. Like Elias Pettersson, the assumption here is that Pastrnak is being overly sensitive. Can these two make up and get back to trying to win hockey games?

New York Rangers Forward Mika Zibanejad Reportedly Not…

The Vancouver Canucks may have shot down a trade offer from the New York Rangers recently, but it appears they may not have had a choice. This past week, it was revealed by Josh Yohe of The Athletic that the New York Rangers offered Mika Zibanejad to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for J.T. Miller, but the move was shot down by General Manager Patrik Allvin. Elliotte Friedman shared on the 32 Thoughts podcast why the trade fell through and added that the Canucks were trying to get the Rangers to add 23-year-old Braden Schneider to the deal, but that attempt was rejected. 'You'll remember that when Miller took his mental health break, the Rangers, who covet the player, were in Vancouver. From what I understand, they approached the Canucks to discuss what something could look like, and Zibanejad was included in the conversation. I don't know that Zibanejad, who has a no-move clause, was ever approached. I asked at the time and did not receive a clear answer. I also think it was actually a bigger deal, and one of the issues is that Vancouver adores Braden Schneider, who the Rangers do not want to trade. This would be the second time New York has rejected a Vancouver attempt for him.' Friedman said. It's been a struggle this season for Mika Zibanejad as he's recorded just eight goals through 41 games with the Rangers and as Chris Drury looks at all his options, it appears that the Swedish forward didn't want to come to Vancouver. Insider says Mika Zibanejad didn't want to come to Vancouver During the Real Kyper and Bourne podcast this week, former NHLer Nick Kypreos shared that at this time, Mika Zibanejad doesn't want to play in Vancouver. 'Everyone's got a right to change their minds and there could be more pressure points in various ways, but as of today, I'm told that Zibanejad does not want to go from the #NYR to the #Canucks.' Nick Kypreos said. We'll have to wait and see what the trade deadline has in store for Patrik Allvin and the Vancouver Canucks. If the team starts picking up their play in the coming weeks, they could end up being aggressive buyers on the market closer to March 7th.

Dak Prescott, Cowboys react to Cooper Rush's parting message after…

After missing a huge chunk of the campaign due to a hamstring injury, Dallas Cowboys cornerstone star Dak Prescott is expected to make a full recovery in time for the new season. At this point, however, it's unclear who will be behind him in the pecking order in 2025. Cooper Rush took over as Dallas' QB1 after Prescott suffered a season-ending injury in Week 9. Rush isn't exactly MVP material, but he did relatively well deputizing in Prescott's stead. Right now, though, there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding Rush's future in Dallas. The 31-year-old is set to be an unrestricted free agent this March and it remains to be seen if the Cowboys will offer him a contract extension. On Tuesday, the former Central Michigan standout took to Instagram to send a parting message after a memorable season. "Thanks to everyone for an unforgettable year 8," Rush wrote, sharing photos of some of his favorite moments from the past campaign. Prescott caught wind of Rush's post and the former just had to make his thoughts about his QB2 abundantly clear. "Red!! My (expletive) Guy!!! ♥️✊" Prescott wrote. Rush's other Cowboys teammates -- both past and present -- also jumped on the comments section to show their support. "Cold blooded coooop " responded Jalen Tolbert. "" wrote Terence Steele. "One of them" Tyler Smith reacted. "I see you coop!" Jalen Brooks said. "My guy," Brock Hoffman wrote. "My dawg Coop! " KaVontae Turpin responded. "Cooooooooop," posted Michael Gallup. It is clear that Prescott and the rest of his Cowboys teammates hold Rush in high regard. Whether or not this will have any impact on the team's decision on his future, however, is an altogether different matter.
