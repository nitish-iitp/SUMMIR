CJ McCollum #3 of the New Orleans Pelicans drives to the basket vs. Washington. He was 8/11 on twos in his 50-point offensive showcase.
CJ McCollum delivers 50 points in one of greatest offensive performances in Pelicans history
Veteran guard produced fifth game of 50-plus points in 23 seasons of New Orleans basketball, nearly matched his own team record of 11 threes

Over his four seasons in the Crescent City, it’s been common for CJ McCollum to confidently state that no matter how he’s shooting the ball during any given period, he knows he’ll eventually get back to 40 percent accuracy from three-point range. It’s an elite level he’s managed to maintain throughout a 12-year NBA career (39.8 percent over 753 games).

After starting the 2024-25 regular season in an extended slump, the 33-year-old recently repeated his familiar assertion to New Orleans coaches, telling them, “I’ll be at 40 percent in 10 days. Just give me 10 days.”

McCollum entered Friday’s matchup vs. Washington at 34 percent from beyond the arc this season. Following a 50-point eruption that featured 10 three-point baskets in 16 attempts – perhaps the greatest shooting performance in Pelicans franchise history – he rapidly improved that rate to 37 percent, halfway to his goal in 31 minutes of playing time. Ten days? The way McCollum has been shooting lately, he may not need that much time.

“That was vintage CJ McCollum right there,” said Pelicans forward Trey Murphy, 24, after the 132-120 win over the Wizards. “That was the CJ McCollum I saw playing when I was in elementary school. That was dope seeing that. It was really cool. When I was (on the floor) I was just trying to make sure he got the ball, make sure everyone understood that it was time to feed the hot man. I was happy for him.”

The Lehigh (Pa.) product matched his career high with 50 points, having posted a 50-point game with Portland in 2017. In addition to his 10 treys, he was 8/11 from inside the arc, sinking floaters, crafty layups and other buckets in the paint. On several of his jumpers, he exhibition no hesitation, firing quick-trigger stepbacks and pulling up from long distance before Washington’s defense could even react.

“CJ was fantastic,” head coach Willie Green said. “He was incredible tonight. Some of the shots he was hitting, he hit tough ones, he hit easy ones. He had it going. We just wanted to continue getting the ball to him.”

McCollum’s epic 50 may be a bit less surprising when looking back at how he’s been simmering offensively over the past week-plus. In the final two games of a New Orleans homestand to close December, he tallied 32 and 33 points vs. Memphis and the Clippers, respectively, going a combined 11/22 on threes. It was the first time since April of last season that he went for 30-plus points in consecutive contests. With an average of 34.3 points over his last four games, McCollum is tied with Denver’s Nikola Jokic and Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as the NBA’s leading scorer over that span. His shooting splits over the four appearances are a scorching 57/51/83.

Known throughout his career for diligent work ethic and preparation, McCollum was gratified to see the extra time he’s spent lately in the practice gym lead to a memorable night in the Smoothie King Center. A husband and father of two young children, McCollum noted Friday that his family provides clear motivation.

“I want (my kids) to know that their dad gave it his all,” he said. “(That) he prepared and left it all out there… I miss a lot of time from my family putting time into the game. So when you have success, it’s like ‘This isn’t all for naught.’ There’s a reason why I was able to hit 10 threes. I was at 34 percent (entering Friday’s game). I’ll be at 40 in like six days. But there’s a reason why. I work hard. I take advantage of my time. I understand how to play this game at a high level.”

While playing the biggest individual role in New Orleans ending an 11-game losing streak, McCollum proved that once again, in emphatic fashion.
