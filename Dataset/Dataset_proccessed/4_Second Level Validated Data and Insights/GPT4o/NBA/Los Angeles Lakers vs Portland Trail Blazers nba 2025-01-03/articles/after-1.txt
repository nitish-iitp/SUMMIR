Anfernee Simons in ‘hardest mental battle’ amid Blazers’ losing, but won’t ask for trade

PORTLAND — In his seventh NBA season, Anfernee Simons says he is engaged in the fight of his career as he navigates more massive losses amid the ever-changing landscape of the Portland Trail Blazers.

“I’m not going to lie, this is probably the hardest mental battle I’ve had in my career, and that’s saying a lot, because I went through some s— earlier in my career,” Simons told The Athletic.

Once an up-and-coming star, Simons’ ascent has stalled this season as the Blazers slog through their fourth consecutive season where the front office has chosen to value better lottery odds over winning. Simons is having his worst season since becoming a regular starter four seasons ago, averaging 17.7 points, down from a career-high 22.6 last season. His shooting percentages from 3-point range (.335) and the field (.415) are both second-worst of his career. And while he has still shown flashes of excellence — he has scored 30 twice and beat Denver with a buzzer-beating drive — his mental funk has kept him from being consistent.

The root of his funk? Losing.

The Trail Blazers’ heavy losses on the court and sweeping changes throughout a once-proud organization are starting to wear on the 25-year-old guard. He wants to be a good soldier. He wants to remain positive. And he wants to be a good example for the rest of the young roster. But he admits his struggle is getting harder to hide.

“It’s been hard as hell,” Simons said. “I be having my bad days. I’m like anybody else. I call them my ‘human days,’ when I let things get to me a little bit. Obviously, it has had an effect on my game. That’s what I’m trying to get out of.”

Simons acknowledges that, at times this season, he has appeared distracted and disconnected on the court, almost as if he has become numb to losing. Coach Chauncey Billups went even further, saying he noticed last season that something was off with Simons.

“We’ve talked about it, and my talks with Ant will be with Ant, but yes, I see it,” Billups said. “It was last year, too. We had some good, long talks over the summer, things that were bothering him, and things I could help him with. So, it hasn’t been a just-now thing. It’s been over time.”

Simons said he will not ask out of Portland. He said he has had two “very light” conversations with general manager Joe Cronin this season in which Cronin wanted to know his thoughts on the season and how the team was progressing. Although Simons is frustrated with the direction of the franchise, he said he doesn’t feel like he has the cachet or urgency to demand a trade.

“I can say how I feel, but I don’t think I’m in that position,” Simons said. “There’s only a few players who can go in there and make (demands). I don’t think that’s my job. My job is to go out and play. If it’s something that serious, I would let my agent take care of it. But you think about what you want out of your career, and stuff like that, and I figure it’s going to happen when it’s supposed to. I’m not going to make any irrational decisions on stuff like that.”

He says he would rather be part of the solution, and he knows that one way for Portland to win more is for him to play better. So, he has tried to show up with a good attitude and continue to work on his game. And, even though he expected more losses this season with such a young roster, he said, “You can be fully prepared for it, but once you are actually in it, it’s different.”

“Obviously, I want things to be better,” Simons said. “But you can’t control some of that stuff. I have to come in and be professional and be myself every day. This can be a tough situation if you let it be a tough situation. Obviously, not winning as much as you would like the last couple of years, it can get on you mentally.”

Portland (11-22) has the sixth-worst record in the NBA and has suffered 10 defeats by 20 or more points, including home losses by 45 to Memphis and 42 to Utah. Last season, the Blazers became the first NBA team to lose multiple games by 60 or more points. Their spiral into the NBA cellar has included changes within the roster, the coaching staff and the support staff.

It’s in stark contrast to the organization he first joined in 2018, where stability, structure and strong relationships ruled.

“When you are in the middle of a whole organizational turnaround, and you came into a culture that was set and everything was this-this-this and then, that changes, you are like … ‘S—, what the hell is going on?'” Simons said. “It’s definitely a lot different now.”

Simons said in mid-December he realized how much he missed how it used to be. When the Blazers played at San Antonio, he ran into Spurs physical therapist Logan Sullivan, who spent four seasons in Portland.

“It brings me up when I see people who used to work here,” Simons said. “Like, seeing Logan … it made me reminisce about my early years, how much I needed those moments and enjoyed those times. Making the playoffs …”

Simons’ malaise is a dangerous side effect of an organization’s pursuit of higher draft picks at the expense of winning. Since Cronin has taken over the Blazers, Portland has an 81-175 record (.316 winning percentage). He has drafted seventh (Shaedon Sharpe), third (Scoot Henderson) and seventh (Donovan Clingan) and will likely have a top-10 pick again. It has created a culture where not only is losing tolerated, but in Portland’s case, the roster has no clear direction or playing style.

“We have talked about it, and it has been a little difficult for him, because it’s not clear-cut that this is his team,” Billups said. “And to me, it’s in the air. It’s what he wants, it’s what Shaedon (Sharpe) wants, what DA (Deandre Ayton) wants, Jerami (Grant) wants, Deni (Avdija) wants … so, go get it. And to me, I’m giving them that opportunity, so I want them all to just go after it.”

Simons said it isn’t one thing that is bothering him; it’s a combination of factors, both professional and personal (he has a son, Ace, who turns 1 in February).

“It’s hard to explain it; some things just don’t feel right,” Simons said. “It could be a bit of everything. I’m not going to point out one thing. Ultimately, I gotta do what I gotta do, and get out of my funk and figure out ways to overcome it. Ultimately, this is a test of faith, and a test of mental toughness and what I’m going to do to get myself out of this feeling.”
