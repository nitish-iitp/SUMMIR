Podziemski, who hadn’t started any of Golden State’s first three games until Curry sprained his left ankle on Sunday, totaled 13 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. He had 19 points and five assists in his first start on Tuesday.

Golden State took a 13-point lead into the fourth quarter, then scored 12 of the period’s first 17 points to create a 91-71 cushion with seven minutes to play.

Hield did most of his scoring from beyond the 3-point arc, hitting 4 of 12 from deep. Golden State outscored the visitors 39-33 on 3-pointers.

Jackson-Davis shot 7-for-9 and Anderson hit all four of his attempts from the field, helping the Warriors shoot 47.1 percent as a team.

The Pelicans finished at just 36.7 percent. Even top scorer Hawkins went just 9-for-21.
