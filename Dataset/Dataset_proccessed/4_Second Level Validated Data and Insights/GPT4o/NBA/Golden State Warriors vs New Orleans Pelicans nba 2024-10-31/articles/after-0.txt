Draymond Green's Defensive Masterclass Against Pelicans
Green Records Five Blocks, Four on Williamson Who Was Held to Career-Worst 25 FG%

Among active players who have been named Defensive Player of the Year, nobody has more All-Defensive Team selections than Draymond Green (8). Green believes his name remains in the conversation among the league's best defenders and the film from Wednesday night's win over the Pelicans has great campaign footage. 

“He’s still one of the best defenders in the world, that’s for sure," Head Coach Steve Kerr said. "The way he battled out there,  the way he led and his energy. He was fantastic."

Green recorded a game-high five blocks, four of which on Pelicans' star forward Zion Williamson —who was held to the lowest field goal percentage of his career (25 percent, 5-for-20). Williamson is a strong, athletic 284 pounds, yet Green met him straight up at the rim twice, blocked a mid-range jumper and matched his physicality in the post for another denial. He consistently takes the challenge of guarding the opposing team's top forwards, with his final block coming on a Brandon Ingram 3-pointer. 

"Draymond has a unique ability to be physical without fouling," Kerr said. "It’s because he’s so smart, he knows the angles, he understands how to use his strength and his long arms to make people have to shoot over him. He’s an incredible shot challenger. Ingram had a three late and Draymond just went from the middle of the paint all the way to the three-point line and got a piece of it. It was just amazing to watch how smart he is and how active he is.”

Green is a 6'5 rim protector who is also skilled at switching out onto the perimeter. He can guard on and off the ball and switch one through five. Very few players in the league are as impactful and versatile defensively and two of them — Victor Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren — are 7-plus footers who are early in their second season, without the decade-plus of production on their resume. 

"It's been all summer watching everyone talk about Chet [Holmgren] and Wemby [Victor Wembanyama] and what they're doing defensively," Green said. "Don't forget about Dray. So I want to be in that conversation as well and I think I've earned the right to be in the conversation. Every game I'm coming out here motivated defensively to get back on the first team all defense.”

With Green anchoring the defense, the Warriors have the second-best defensive rating in the league (98.4), only trailing Holmgren's Thunder (91.3), who also have All-Defensive guard Alex Caruso. The Warriors have held two of their first five opponents below 90 points, including the Pelicans on Wednesday. 

The Warriors and Green are committed to defense this season, playing the rangy forward at his natural position — power forward — surrounding him with a traditional five and wing defenders. As the offense revolves around Curry, the defense is built around Green, the most accomplished defender in franchise history.
