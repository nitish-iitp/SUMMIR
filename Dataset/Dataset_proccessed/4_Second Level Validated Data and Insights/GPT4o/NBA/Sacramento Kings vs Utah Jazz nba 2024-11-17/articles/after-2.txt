SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — After scoring 60 points in a losing effort the night before, De’Aaron Fox had 49 to lead the Sacramento Kings to a 121-117 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night.

Fox went 16 of 30 from the field and made 14 of 19 from the free-throw line, and he added nine assists and two steals. Fox’s 109 points are the most over a two-game span in franchise history, passing DeMarcus Cousins.

Over the last 50 years, there has been only one instance of someone scoring more points in a two-day span. Kobe Bryant scored 110 points — 60 against Memphis and then 50 against New Orleans — on March 22 and 23, 2007.

Kevin Huerter had 18 points, and Trey Lyles added 17 for the Kings.

Lauri Markkanen had 25 points, Keyonte George scored 19 and Collin Sexton added 18 for the Jazz. Jordan Clarkson had 17 off the bench for Utah.

DeMar DeRozan, Malik Monk and Domantas Sabonis were sidelined for Sacramento, and Taylor Hendricks and Walker Kessler did not play for the Jazz.

Takeaways

Jazz: With John Collins scoring 16, the Jazz had five players score at least that many in a game for the first time this season.

Kings: Fox made his first seven shots from the floor, including three 3-pointers in the first quarter. By halftime, he had 26 points.
