Jazz coach Will Hardy told reporters after the game that Markkanen would get treatment on Wednesday. Utah is off until Thursday, when it faces the San Antonio Spurs in Salt Lake City. Hardy will wait until then to determine if Markkanen is good to play.

In four games (all starts) this season, Markkanen has averaged 18.0 points, 7.3 boards and 1.8 assists as one of the few bright spots for a Jazz team that is 0-4.
