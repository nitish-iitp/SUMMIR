Another day, another milestone for Sacramento Kings guard De’Aaron Fox.

One game removed from tallying his 10,000th career point, Fox secured the 671st steal of his career during Tuesday night’s win over the Utah Jazz, breaking a tie with Hall of Fame guard and Kings legend Mitch Richmond for the third-most in franchise history.

Fox, who led the NBA in steals (150) and steals per game (2.0) last season, has been an effective defender over the past couple of seasons with former Sacramento guard Doug Christie on the bench as an assistant coach.

Christie, a four-time member of the NBA’s All-Defensive teams during his time in a Kings uniform, is the lone player ahead of Fox on the Sacramento era (1985-present) steals list with 717 for his career.

At Fox’s current rate, he will pass Christie this season and take the steals crown for the Sac era, with only former Kansas City Kings center Sam Lacey (950) standing in the way of the franchise record.

More on De’Aaron Fox

Countless players have donned a Sacramento Kings jersey over the years, but very few have accomplished what De’Aaron Fox has in his NBA career.

Fox, who is just in his age-26 season, crossed the 10,000-point mark for his career during Monday’s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, becoming just the fifth player in franchise history to score 10,000 points or more during their time with the franchise,

Fox joins Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson (22,009), Jack Twyman (15,840), Mitch Richmond (12,070), and Tiny Archibald (10,894) on the exclusive list of greats–with plenty of basketball left to be played in his career, too.

Sacramento will continue its four-game road trip on Friday night when they face Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks at State Farm Arena.
