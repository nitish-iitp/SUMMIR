Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Charlotte Hornets, January 5, 2025
By Ethan Sands, cleveland.com

CLEVELAND, Ohio — New Year. Same Cavs, though.

Cleveland earned its first home victory of 2025 with a 115-105 win over the Charlotte Hornets at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on Sunday. It marked the team’s 10th straight win by double digits, a new franchise record. This is the second time in franchise history where the team has two separate 10-game winning streaks in a season (2008-09).

Coming off a four-game road trip where they swept their Western Conference opponents, Sunday’s matchup could have been interpreted as a trap game as the Charlotte Hornets were on a nine-game losing skid entering the contest. But the Cavs didn’t care. They are just the eighth team in NBA history to start 31-4 or better.

“That’s definitely a trap game,” Cavs swingman Max Strus said. “But the way that we approach every day here, the way that our guys have come to work every single day, no matter what the scenario is, we just approach it with a championship mindset and take it one day at a time and one game at a time and treat each game like it’s the most important game. We did that today and took care of business.”

The Cavs held just a six-point lead after the first quarter, but as they have become accustomed to doing, they went on a run in the second quarter to give them a 24-point lead at one point.

While Jarrett Allen quietly dominated the paint with a 15-point first half on 7-of-7 shooting and eight rebounds, the real fireworks unfolded on the perimeter in a high-stakes chess match between two of the league’s most electrifying young guards.

From the opening tip, the Cavs’ Darius Garland and Charlotte’s LaMelo Ball engaged in a spirited duel that set the tone for the game.

“I love it,” Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. “It’s the NBA. I mean guys are competitive. It’s like you’re in the schoolyard and you’re competing against your opposition and guys talk a little trash, it didn’t get over the top. They’re both good spirited guys. I thought it added a little intrigue to the game. It is an entertainment league too, so I think the fans got a kick out of it.”

Garland, taking pride in his on-ball defense, shadowed Ball for 94 feet and made an early statement by denying an inbound pass and delivering a light shove that sent Ball sprawling. It was the spark that ignited their back-and-forth battle.

As Cleveland began to assert control in the second quarter, Ball sought to pull his team out of the mire. Recognizing the size mismatch, the 6-foot-7 Hornets guard attacked Garland with intent.

On one sequence, Ball used his length to rise over Garland for a mid-range jumper that rattled around the rim and through the net, prompting him to trot back on defense with a roar directed at his rival. His teammate had to redirect him back to his defensive assignment.

Garland, unflustered, responded in kind. He orchestrated a switch to isolate Ball, then unleashed a snatch-back dribble into a mid-range jumper that left Ball off balance. Garland clapped emphatically as he sprinted back. Ball furiously waved for the ball to try and get back ahead of Garland in their mini chess match. He would miss the 3-pointer.

The chess match persisted, with both guards trading blows but neither seizing a clear edge, especially after Garland’s mid-range as the Hornets relinquished the opportunity for the Cavs’ point guard to get an isolation matchup with Ball.

“He tried to get like a one-on-one matchup, and he got like a little weak bucket. I went down, tried to get a little one-on-one matchup and they sent the double team,” Garland said of the back and forth. “It happened a couple times after that, so it wasn’t really a battle.

“I couldn’t reciprocate the same energy that he tried to do to me. I couldn’t reciprocate the same on the other end ‘cause I was getting double teamed. But it’s like Ty [Jerome] said, it’s a respect thing. So I’ll take the double team, I guess. Even though it wasn’t fun.”

Ball, leveraging his size, earned six of his 15 first-half points at the free-throw line, finishing with 24 points. Garland countered with four of his 13 points from the stripe, maintaining his poise as the Cavs built a commanding 15-point halftime lead.

The matchup had an unspoken edge, sparked by the first fan returns for All-Star voting. Ball topped Eastern Conference guards, Donovan Mitchell followed in second, and Garland was left outside the top 10. For the Cavs’ backcourt, this wasn’t just another game — it was a chance to show the talent scale tips heavier in their favor, even if the fans leaned toward Ball. Sunday’s showdown could begin to shift the All-Star narrative.

“I want to be an All-Star,” Garland stated firmly. “I want to get back to that level of play that I’ve been at and I’m healthy this season. I plan on being in San Francisco.”

Although Mitchell and Garland showcased their talents, they didn’t leave their teammates in the wind.

The difference between the two teams was stark. Cleveland’s offense flowed seamlessly, with crisp ball movement and unselfishness resulting in assists on 29 of their 44 made baskets.

Meanwhile, Charlotte leaned heavily on isolation plays from Ball and Brandon Miller, managing just 19 assists as a team.

By night’s end, the Cavs had showcased their depth and balance, with five players scoring 15 or more points. Garland led the way with 25, outdueling Ball, while Allen and Mitchell added 19 apiece.

The Cavs’ Evan Mobley contributed 17, rounding out a cohesive offensive effort. Allen’s dominance extended to the boards, where he secured his 20th double-double of the season with 11 rebounds. Mobley, the only Cavalier to log more than 30 minutes, played a controlled 31 as Cleveland cruised to another convincing victory.

Even as favorites, the Cavs approached the game with focus and energy and handled their business with precision.

“It’s our maturity. It’s our focus,” Atkinson said of coming back from a nine-day road trip and not missing a beat. “I was worried, really worried about this game. We got to bed at 5:30 in the morning, six in the morning. You got that next day, but it’s not like a normal day. So I was really, really pleased to see how they reacted.”
