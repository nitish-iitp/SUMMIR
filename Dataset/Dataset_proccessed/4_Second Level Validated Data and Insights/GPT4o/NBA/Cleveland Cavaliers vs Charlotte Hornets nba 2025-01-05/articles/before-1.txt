The Cavaliers, 30-4, have the best record in the NBA, but you would never know it by looking at the All-Star votes cast by fans.

Evan Mobley is 10th in the voting for Eastern Conference players in the front court with 145, 623 votes, according to the latest results released by the NBA.

Donovan Mitchell is second among guards in the East with 718,084 votes. LaMelo Ball of the Charlotte Hornets leads the Eastern Conference guards with 974,444 votes. Mitchell and Mobley are the only Cavaliers to crack the top 10 in voting.

Cavs center Jarrett Allen and guard Darius Garland certainly belong in the All-Star conversation. Maybe voting for them will pick up beginning Jan. 5 when the Cavaliers begin a homestand with a game against the Charlotte Hornets at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, though we are not living in the times when baseball fans would cast their votes by stuffing paper ballots into cardboard boxes set up on stadium concourses in every MLB stadium in the country.

Voting began on Dec. 19 and runs through 11:59 p.m. EST Jan. 20. Fans can easily vote by going to NBA.com and clicking on “Vote Now!” The instructions are simple to follow.

The All-Star Game will be played Feb. 16 at Chase Center, home arena of the Golden State Warriors.

NBA All-Star Games become boring because nobody plays defense seriously. The league is trying to change that by copying the format the NHL implemented a few years ago in which the All-Star game becomes a mini tournament involving four teams and three games.

Each team will have eight players. Two teams will meet in one semifinal. The remaining two teams will meet in the other semifinal. The winning teams from Game 1 and Game 2 will advance to face each other in the championship. For each game, the winner will be the first team to reach or surpass 40 points.

The next voting update will be announced Jan. 9.
