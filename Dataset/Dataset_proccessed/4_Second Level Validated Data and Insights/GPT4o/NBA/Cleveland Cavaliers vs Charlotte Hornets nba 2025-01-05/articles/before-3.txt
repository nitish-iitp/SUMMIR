Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Prediction

The Charlotte Hornets aren’t a good team at full strength, but now they’re without Ball, Miller, and Mann. It’s hard to take the Hornets seriously with all of these injuries and the fact Bridges is the go-to- guy for everything. And even with all of that said, the Cavaliers are 29-4 SU on the season and 24-9 ATS. With a cover percentage of 72.7 percent, only the Thunder are better at cashing tickets for NBA bettors this season. The Cavs have beaten the Hornets twice this season and covered double-digit chalk in both games. There’s really only one way to go here, and that’s to lay the big line with the Cavaliers at home.
