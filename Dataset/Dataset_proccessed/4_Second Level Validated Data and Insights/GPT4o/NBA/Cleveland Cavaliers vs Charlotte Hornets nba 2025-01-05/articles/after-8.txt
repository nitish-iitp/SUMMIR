Hornets Can’t Stop NBA’s Hottest Team
Ball, Miller Return; Smith Jr. Scores Season High in Cleveland
Matt Rochinski
January 5, 20259:05 PM EST

LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller returned to the Hornets lineup after missing three games with their respective injuries, giving Charlotte its projecting starting five to start the season for just the third time in 2024-25.  The Hornets duo led the way with 24 points apiece, but it wasn’t enough to put an end to the Cavs 10-game winning streak with a 115-105 loss at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, where Cleveland is now 18-1. Charlotte has now dropped 10-straight games, including six-straight on the road.

Top Performers

Both Ball (left ankle, right wrist) and Miller (left ankle) showed little rust to start the contest and continued to fight throughout. Ball scored seven points in the first quarter and finished with 24 points on 7-of-20 shooting from the field, including 3-of-11 from outside the arc, and added four assists and three rebounds in 33 minutes. Ball also connected on multiple treys for the 11th-straight game. Not to be outdone, Miller equaled the 24 on 8-of-14 shooting from the field, going 6-of-10 from long range. It was Miller’s 17th-consecutive game with multiple three-pointers as well. Miller also grabbed two rebounds and two assists while blocking one shot in 32 minutes.

Turning Point

The Hornets entered the second quarter trailing, 29-23, but when you’re up against the NBA’s hottest team on its home court, there’s little room for error, and the 3:24 stretch to start the second would prove crucial. The Hornets missed their first four shots off the frame and turned the ball over three times (equaling their first-quarter total), leading to six points for Cleveland on a 13-2 run that pushed the lead to 42-25. Charlotte struggled to find an option for Evan Mobley in the run, as the Cavs big man scored seven points by working his inside and outside game. Cleveland didn’t back down as the Hornets continued to struggle from the field. Charlotte connected on just 1-of-11 (9.1 percent) from the field and 1-of-7 (14.3 percent) from long range as the Cavs build their largest lead of the game, 53-29, at the 5:00 mark of the second quarter. The Hornets couldn’t get to within single digits the rest of the way on the way to the loss.

Good Night for Nick Smith Jr.

After seeing action in just five games for the Hornets in December, Nick Smith Jr. saw action in his second-straight game to start the New Year and scored a season-high 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting from the field and 4-of-6 shooting from outside the arc. Smith also filled the stat sheet with five rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot in 20 minutes off the bench. 

M and M Continue Board Work

Miles Bridges (23.3 points, 10.3 rebounds) and Mark Williams (16.7 points, 10.3 rebounds) both averaged double-doubles in Ball and Miller’s absence the past three games. While Ball and Miller took on a large chunk of the offensive load, Bridges (11 points, eight rebounds) and Williams (11 points, nine rebounds) both nearly recorded a double-double.

Postgame Quotes

“I thought that we started a little slow, and when you’re coming on the road and  playing a good team like that, they definitely make you pay for every mistake you make… But we’re fighting, we’re competing, we’re trying to find ways of having better offensive possessions so that it doesn’t continue to put as much pressure on our defense”

Hornets Head Coach Charles Lee 

“He took full advantage of his opportunity to play today. It’s just a testament to Nick continuing to put in the work with our Greensboro staff. He got some real, high-quality games there. They worked on the things that he needed to work on, and today he came out, hooped and balled and gave us the lift that we needed.”

Hornets Head Coach Charles Lee on Nick Smith Jr.
