Trey Murphy III scored 34 for the Pelicans, who played on the same day that at least 15 people were killed in New Orleans when a truck drove into a crowd of New Year's revelers on Bourbon Street in an attack that President Joe Biden described as “despicable.”

The Pelicans — who never led — lost for the 29th time in their last 32 games and are 1-20 in their last 21 contests.

Pelicans: CJ McCollum scored 22 for New Orleans, and Murphy's 34 points tied for the third-most by a Pelicans player this season. McCollum had 36 on Dec. 12 and Murphy had 35 on Dec. 27.

Heat: Jimmy Butler, in his first game following a five-game absence because of illness, had nine points, four rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes on 3-for-5 shooting. Miami is now 12-9 in games where Butler plays this season.

Herro missed his first four 3-point attempts, then threw a terrible alley-oop lob that he intended for Butler late in the first half. The pass went in — for three points, which technically became the first of five straight makes for Herro from beyond the arc.

The Pelicans have dropped 15 in a row on the road. It's the 100th time in NBA history that a team has had a road losing streak of 15 or more in the same season.

Heat host Indiana on Thursday, and Pelicans host Washington on Friday.

Sweden to contribute up to 3 warships to reinforced NATO presence in the Baltic
2025-01-12 22:56 Last Updated At：23:01

STOCKHOLM (AP) — Sweden will contribute up to three warships to a NATO effort to increase the alliance's presence in the Baltic Sea as it tries to guard against sabotage of underwater infrastructure, the government said Sunday.

The Swedish military also will contribute an ASC 890 surveillance aircraft, the government said in a statement. And the country's coast guard will contribute four ships to help monitor the Baltic, with a further seven vessels on standby.

Sweden became the Western military alliance’s 32nd member in March. It followed neighboring Finland into NATO after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The government said this will be the first time that Sweden as a NATO ally contributes armed forces to the alliance's defense and deterrence.

The decision comes as a string of incidents in the Baltic has heightened concerns about possible Russian activities in the region.

The undersea cables and pipelines that crisscross the sea link Nordic, Baltic and central European countries, promote trade, energy security and, in some cases, reduce dependence on Russian energy resources.

Ten Baltic Sea cables have been damaged since 2023, affecting Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. At least two incidents involved ships later accused of dragging their anchors.

Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said at an annual security conference Sunday that Sweden is not at war, but there is also no peace, Swedish news agency TT reported.
