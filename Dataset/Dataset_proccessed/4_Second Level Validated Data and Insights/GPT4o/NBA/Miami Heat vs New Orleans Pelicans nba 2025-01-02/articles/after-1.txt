Miami Heat’s Decisive Win Over New Orleans Pelicans
BY
EDITORIAL STAFF
JANUARY 2, 2025
2 MINUTE READ

The Miami Heat demonstrated a strong performance against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night, prevailing with a 119-108 victory.

The game at Kaseya Center saw two promising rookies face off: Kel’el Ware of the Miami Heat and Yves Missi from the Pelicans. Missi, having established a reputation for recording double-doubles and impressive rebound statistics, entered the match with considerable hype. However, it was Ware who capitalized on the opportunity to showcase his potential, particularly in the third quarter where his size and skills were pivotal in maintaining the Heat’s lead.

Ware, selected 15th in the draft from Indiana, utilized his abilities effectively during the match. He demonstrated his offensive threat with an alley-oop and an early three-pointer, although he is still refining his defensive skills. His contribution is expected to be significant moving forward, potentially surpassing Kevin Love in the rotation during Bam Adebayo’s rests.

The Heat’s lineup benefited from the return of key players Jimmy Butler and Duncan Robinson. Butler, who had recently recovered from illness, and Robinson, returning from a strained foot, started alongside Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and Haywood Highsmith. The team faced sanctions earlier, with Terry Rozier suspended and Herro fined for an altercation in Houston. Despite these challenges, coach Erik Spoelstra emphasized the importance of consistency and momentum.

Spoelstra expressed his trust in Butler’s readiness, acknowledging the team’s efforts to build a consistent performance. The Pelicans began the game with Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones, Trey Murphy, and Missi, while Alec Burks and Nikola Jovic were the initial substitutes for the Heat, followed by Ware and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Herro extended his streak of double-figure games to 61 and continued his impressive run of scoring three-pointers, breaking the Heat’s previous record set by Tim Hardaway. Meanwhile, Adebayo reached a personal milestone with his 8,000th career point, and Jovic achieved his 100th career three-pointer.

As the Heat managed their seventh back-to-back set this season, the team looked to maintain their winning momentum, having previously succeeded at home against the Suns and Cavaliers. The reunion of former teammates Corey Brewer, Butler, and Highsmith added a personal touch to the evening.

The Miami Heat’s victory over the Pelicans not only highlighted Kel’el Ware’s emerging talent but also underscored the team’s resilience and focus on consistency. With key players returning and new milestones achieved, the Heat are poised to build on this momentum in upcoming games.
