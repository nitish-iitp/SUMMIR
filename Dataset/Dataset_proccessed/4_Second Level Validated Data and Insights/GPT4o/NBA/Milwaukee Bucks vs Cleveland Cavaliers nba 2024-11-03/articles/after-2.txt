Takeaways

Cavaliers: Cleveland showed its gumption by winning at less than full strength one night after beating the Orlando Magic 120-109 at home. Cleveland was missing Caris LeVert due to a sore right knee.

Bucks: After shooting a combined 17 of 73 on 3-point attempts in losses at Boston and Memphis, the Bucks were 18 of 39 from beyond the arc Saturday. Their hot start from long range helped them build a 16-point first-quarter lead. In the end, Lillard and Antetokounmpo didn’t get enough help. The Bucks need more from Gary Trent Jr., who scored three points in 34 minutes.

Key moment

After Lillard put Milwaukee ahead, Cleveland called timeout. Evan Mobley inbounded a pass to Mitchell, who caught it while barely avoiding a backcourt violation. Mitchell briefly lost control of the ball, but regained possession in 3-point range, dribbled inside the arc and hit a 19-footer.

Key stat

Lillard’s 10 3-pointers were his most since joining the Bucks last season. His 41 points were two off his best total as a Buck.

The teams meet again Monday in Cleveland.
