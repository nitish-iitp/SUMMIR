Sure if the bucks had a superstar who could shoot 3s consistently dribble consistently with dame then it would’ve worked but that’s not Giannis it was stupid for the bucks to trade for dame at all everyone besides them knew they were a bad fit basketball wise

Ignoring the Doc Rivers poisonous element would be disingenuous.

Started 30-13 last year with Griffin then 2-1 with Prunty, and finally 17-19 with Doc. How he keeps getting these jobs is amazing, he was even a finalist for the Suns last year before they went with Vogel.

Taking a gamble on Lillard was worth taking for Milwaukee. The mere fact that Giannis resigned after the Lillard signing was enough and if it worked out it was even better.
Strictly on the court is a little different. With Lillard being a defensive liability it was a high risk, high reward situation.

That's simply not true. People on this board and plenty of basketball experts were drooling at the thought of the Dame-Giannis pick and roll. They had one of the best - if not the best - preseason gambling odds to win the championship. ESPN had them ranked #2 preseason. NBA.com had them ranked #2 preseason as well.

It's complete and total revisionist history to claim that everyone knew it was a bad fit. Most people thought the exact opposite.

I'm sure some of the fans who were so excited at the start of last season are just buzzin' with pain right now.

I thought Giannis would get the most out of Lillard, but I have said for years that Lillard is a third option on a championship team, but not many people on the board agreed.

Milwaukee needs another piece to the puzzle.

They are falling apart too soon. If they blow it up now, they could be on the upswing by the time the Blazers get the pick/swaps.

there is no such thing as lillard being a "gamble"   

giannis wanted him, giannis got him - simple

but the fallout of trading away jrue and firing bud was all because giannis got hurt and didn't finish the season if you ask me.

i am more perplexed that lillard and giannis can't figure it out. two all pro vets should know better AND neither crosses over into the other guys turf. this isn't wade/lebron trying to figure it out

me being a jrue guy, this has been about the importance of D in an offensive league, and jrue's validation so i'm happy. i hope the buxxx sukk eggs thru dame's career and jrue and the c's win 3more

Lillard may have started a decline, but coaching and behind the scenes issues seem to be a bigger issue. Its just barely over a season, Stotts quit as assistant coach despite a close relationship with Lillard (sounds like issues with the previous head coach), then they fire the head coach despite a good record, and then things really went to **** when they got Doc. This hasn’t been so much a talent issue.

They won't because even if the blazers don't own their 1st rounders other teams do whether it's the blazers matters to you as a blazer fan from a bucks perspective it's meaningless if it's NOP or the blazers you can't rebuild without being able to draft with your picks.

Their only option is as I've said wait three years until his PO is about to kick in if they haven't been able to correct things and he won't extend then move him. At least at that point they will be in a position to be much closer to controlling their own picks. At that point they can do a proper rebuild.

If I were the Bucks I wouldn't even move him if he asked. He'd have to sit out games and for the situation to be completely unsalvagable first. I mean most of their guys big money deals are going to expire soon so they have options to build around him either via a trade or in a year or two free agency. Like we had something similar with Harris we just had to have his deal play out before we could get a decent top-shelf player to pair with Embiid. If I were the Bucks I'd be looking to get some assets so they have some flexability or trade some expiring for term to get better players.

I was thinking Giannis could land enough picks to make up for the picks they don’t have of their own. But I certainly hope they are bottom of the league at the end of the decade.

Bucks win this trade by a landslide for winning the 2024 NBA cup and the 2025 NBA Finals in 6 months.

In ten years when we look at the cup as being close to a championship in value (maybe even higher because it's win or go home like the NFL) your tune will change. Because of the format the cup will benefit highly clutch players more since there's no second chance.

Only one problem.
No one will care in 10 years from now.
If it still exists.
