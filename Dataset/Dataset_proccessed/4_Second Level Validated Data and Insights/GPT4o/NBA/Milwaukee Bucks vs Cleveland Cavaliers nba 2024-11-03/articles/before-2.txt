Damian Lillard is coming off one of the worst shooting performances of his career on Thursday against the Memphis Grizzlies. Lillard shot 1-for-12 from the field as the Milwaukee Bucks dropped to 1-4 to start the season. How did the Bucks star perform on Saturday versus the Cleveland Cavaliers?

Lillard was fantastic for the Bucks tonight, finishing with 41 points, four rebounds and nine assists. He had the hot hand from start to end, going 13-for-24, including 10-for-15 from beyond the arc. However, Milwaukee suffered their fifth straight loss of the season to drop to 1-5.

It was definitely Dame Time late in the game, with Lillard hitting the go-ahead jump shot with 9.8 seconds left to give the Bucks the lead. Donovan Mitchell came back on the other for the answer to sink Milwaukee with his heart-dagging shot with 0.3 seconds remaining to get the 114-113 win.

How did Damian Lillard perform against the Cavaliers?

Damian Lillard started the game hot against the best team in the NBA based on the Cleveland Cavaliers' 6-0 record. Lillard made five 3-point shots in the period to guide the Milwaukee Bucks to an early lead and have momentum heading into the second quarter.

The Bucks were up 38-30 after one quarter, but the Cavaliers came back to get the lead with three minutes left in the second period. Lillard saved the quarter for Milwaukee, scoring the last five points for the team to maintain a 62-61 advantage at the half.

It turned into a back-and-forth contest in the second half, with no team gaining control of the game. Lillard cooled down in the third quarter before another explosion in the fourth quarter. He was fantastic down the stretch and the Bucks were seconds away from snapping their four-game skid.

Lillard's jump shot with 9.8 seconds left in the fourth quarter gave Milwaukee a 113-112 lead. Gary Trent Jr. did a wonderful job defending Donovan Mitchell in the next possession. Trent poked the ball out of Mitchell's hands, but was unable to get the steal.

The Cavs star made the Bucks pay, hitting the game-winning jump shot with just 0.3 seconds remaining. Lillard missed the 3-pointer at the buzzer as the Fiserv Forum crowd was stunned in disbelief.

What's next for Damian Lillard and the Bucks?

Damian Lillard's 41-point effort was wasted on Saturday night after the Milwaukee Bucks suffered their fifth-straight defeat. Lillard and the Bucks have no time to mope as they return to action on Monday in Cleveland for the second left of the home-and-away series against the Cavaliers.

The Bucks will need to play much better if they want to get out of their losing streak. It doesn't get easier because they have the Utah Jazz, New York Knicks and Boston Celtics next on their schedule.
