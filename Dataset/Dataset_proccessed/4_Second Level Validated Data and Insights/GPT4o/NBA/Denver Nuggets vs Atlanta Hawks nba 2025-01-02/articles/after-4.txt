Russell Westbrook making case for regular starting role with Denver Nuggets
The Denver Nuggets are 3-1 in the last four games with Russell Westbrook in the starting lineup, and Michael Malone's team has scored at least 132 points in all four. With Aaron Gordon nearing a return from a calf strain, Malone will have a decision to make about his starting five.

The time could soon be coming for Michael Malone to make a tough decision.

The Nuggets improved to 9-2 when Russell Westbrook is in the starting lineup with Wednesday’s win over the Atlanta Hawks. Westbrook has been the Nuggets’ fifth starter since Aaron Gordon strained his right calf muscle for the second time this season. The first time, Malone replaced Gordon with fellow forward Peyton Watson.

The second time around, Malone went to Westbrook. The Nuggets have scored 132 or more points in the four games since Westbrook rejoined the starting lineup with the only loss coming against the league’s best record, the 29-4 Cleveland Cavaliers. Westbrook is averaging 12.8 points and nine assists in that stretch while sharing the playmaking responsibilities with Nikola Jokic.

“Such a willing passer, finding guys buckets, he knows how to create points for other people,” Michael Porter Jr. said after Westbrook provided assists on two of his five 3-pointers against Atlanta. "Just make the simple pass for assists, he’s very good at that. Now, we’ve got Joker and Russ doing that.”

Jokic and Westbrook have quickly developed chemistry in their first season as teammates. Of Westbrook’s 11 assists against Atlanta, Jokic was on the scoring end of three of them. Westbrook was also on the finishing end on three of Jokic’s 15 assists.

“He’s the best player in the world. My job is to make the game easy for him,” Westbrook said during his on-court interview postgame. “He does it for everybody else. It’s a pleasure to be able to share the floor with him.”

Westbrook’s impact extends beyond the box score. On a team that hasn’t always had a consistent vocal leader, Westbrook quickly established the tone in his first season with the Nuggets.

“Russ, I know for a fact, has done it all year long. He’s the one guy that will talk, but I want (the rest of) them to take ownership,” Malone said.

“I want them to hold each other accountable, police each other, because when that happens, then you have a chance to be special.”

The results are hard to argue with, but the decision who Westbrook could potentially replace when Denver’s regular starting five is healthy is also difficult. Christian Braun is the leading candidate based on salary and seniority, but he’s also Malone’s best bet to guard bigger guards or wings and a big part of Denver’s league-best 19.5 fast-break points per game as Westbrook’s running mate.

“A big part of why we’ve been so good, especially these last few games, is Russ running in transition,” Braun said.

“It kind of shocked me how good of a passer he was. I knew he was a good passer. I didn’t know he was this good. He plays off Nikola really well. He finds me in transition a ton. He’s been great for us.”

Prior to Wednesday’s game, Malone said Gordon is progressing, but there isn’t a timeline for a return. Denver’s coach didn’t expect Gordon back for the next “couple of games,” and stressed the risk of bringing a player with a soft-tissue injury back too soon. Denver has a back-to-back set with the Spurs, the first Friday in Denver and the second Saturday in San Antonio. Then, the Nuggets have a couple of days off before Tuesday’s game against the defending-champion Boston Celtics.

“The reality is, while AG is out, other guys have to step up,” Malone said. “I think they’re doing that a little more consistently as of late.”
