The Denver Nuggets are on a roll. They won their third straight game on Wednesday night to ring in the New Year. The Atlanta Hawks kept pace with the Nuggets for one half, but a huge third quarter left no doubt as to the victor. Nikola Jokic gets yet another triple double and seven Nuggets score in double figures in a game that ended up being a complete laugher. Denver wins big 139-120.

Jokic led the offense to start the game, first diming up Michael Porter Jr., then getting an and-one. Atlanta kept pace by knocking down threes but Denver was scoring with ease. They went on a 7-0 run but stalled out after that. Atlanta closed back in behind Trae Young and trailed by a basket halfway through the quarter. Jokic kept Denver’s offense humming. With the bench, including Jalen Pickett, checking in, the Nuggets held a small lead. Julian Strawther got a couple of buckets but Atlanta was able to get points as well so Denver couldn’t pull away. Jokic continued to dominate, and led a strong close to the quarter. After one Denver led 40-33.

The Nuggets bench group kept up the scoring but also didn’t play a ton of defense which led to a fast paced, high scoring start to the second quarter. The Hawks started hitting threes (including a four point play) and Denver’s lead was dwindling. DeAndre Jordan had a solid shift and provided some paint offense when the Nuggets needed a bucket but the Hawks kept knocking down outside shots. De’Andre Hunter led a run for Atlanta and they eventually took the lead at the six minute mark. Both teams went on mini runs after that. Jokic was back in and things started clicking again for the Nuggets. The game stayed close and fast paced down the stretch, Joker nearly had a triple double in the first half and Denver went to the locker room up 74-71.

The second half opened pretty much the same way the first half went. Both teams piled up the points but the Nuggets had a little more firepower with Young being the only one producing for the Hawks. Denver finally started to get their focus on defense and built a lead. Porter and Christian Braun led the offense and halfway through the quarter Denver was up double digits. The Nuggets kept pushing, Atlanta started looking disinterested and it looked like the route was on. Denver pushed the lead up to twenty with a few minutes left in the third and kept running. Peyton Watson finished a lob from Braun with a reverse jam to pop the top on Ball Arena and the Hawks kept settling for jump shots. Denver ended up outscoring the Hawks by seventeen in the quarter and headed to the fourth leading 115-95.

Murray led the bench to open the fourth. Atlanta kept Denver from making the lead bigger but the Nuggets still found enough offense to keep their advantage above twenty. The offenses started to slow down with the game feeling like it was already in hand. Both teams took a lot of jump shots without a lot of movement. The Hawks knocked down a couple threes but looked resigned to chalk this one up to a loss. With Denver still up twenty plus and under four minutes to go the teams emptied out their benches. Not much of note from there except that Pickett continued to string together quality minutes. The deep bench closed it out and Denver blows out the Hawks again. Final score 139-120.

Plea’s Picks: Wemby brings all that talent to chilly Denver. DEN-7/237 Don’t know much about the Spurs other than that Wemby’s going to change the league. Playing golf today, maybe someone can write a preview. Trend lines San Antonio are 7-0 ATS in their last 7 games. San Antonio are 4-1 ATS in their last 5 games on the road. Denver are 4-2 ATS in their last 6 games.

I have my Jimmy and Denver thoughts like the next guy but let me give some context to the Jimmy situation. There’s clearly some animosity between Pat Riley and Jimmy. It probably has to do with Jimmy not getting a contract extension but it seems like Pat Riley calling out Jimmy for trash talking after they lost vs the Celtics after he missed the series was a factor. However, there’s a very clear development that happened in the last week and that’s Jimmy’s role in the offense. In the last… Read more »

Speaking of Doomerism, the Locked on Nuggets podcast after a 19 point win against the Hawks was ridiculous. Matt Moore spent 3/4th of the show on how bad they are defensively with the primary issue being how many 3s they gave up. IIRC not too many were even good looks.

I listened for the first time all season last week and was impressed that Matt was sticking with Denver winning the title despite much doom. Seems like his big picture take is they probably make a fringe trade but mostly just gradually put things together.

Still as big of a Jimmy to Denver fan as I was the day it became a possibility. These Russ/Mal/Jokic lineups are amazing and I’m taking nothing away from them but you add Jimmy to the puzzle and it’ll basically iron proof your offense and transform your defense.

It all depends on the ++. Is it Braun? Then no. Is it a first round pick? Alright I’d do it. Is it a first and Strawther? That’s my absolute limit but I’d still say yes given that no deal could happen without Zeke Nnaji.

Time will tell, but Russ’s impact on the offense seems to be having produced a change in Jokic’s scoring pattern. Jokic in his career has never been above 80% in ASTD% (the percent of assisted makes), around December 1st he started trending significantly up from his usual 60%-ish ASTD%, and now is over 80. Here is a comparison to his ASTD% in the Championship year.

Great find.

Nba.com tracks “passes from” on their individual player passing dashboard, and Russ is the biggest assister Jokic has ever had at 2.6 per game this year. Interesting that Russ doesn’t seem to have taken away assist opportunities for anyone else either, Murray is right where he’s been for years at 2 per game, MPJ has just about tripled last year’s number at 1.3, Braun has matched KCP at 0.9.

Nugs had 44 assists last night. In this recent run of 130+ point games assists are way up. Nobody has ever started 3 point guards before, AFAIK. Should be really interesting to see how it evolves.

“Interesting that Russ doesn’t seem to have taken away assist opportunities for anyone else either” It seems to be because the whole team is getting connected. The Russ and Jokic game is creating bigger gaps in the defense, and the rest of the team is in on the vibe. Jokic-Ball has found a catalyzing agent in Westbrook-Ball, and if the spacing is right Murray should be able to feast even as a passer. Also, more and more transition will spread assists to other players as well. Denver is at the… Read more »

This is pretty good on Russ with Denver: “I truly think this was the role he was born to play. Primary ballhandler with two other scorers who operate better when they are off the ball most of the time. Jamal has a tendency to overdribble, but with Russ in there much of the ballhandling cedes to him and the result is beautiful basketball where nobody is excluded, and this isn’t a knock on Jamal because there are times when it should go Jamal/Joker 2-man game, but a lot of us… Read more »

A very interesting, solid point. But…what would it look like if Braun just isn’t at SF/SG?
In limited minutes (98), Gordon, Jokic, Murray, Westbrook & Porter is at 59.7 eFG (vs opp eFG of 52.7%), OREB at 46.9% (vs opp 16.9). 129.8 ORTG.

That might be the secret unlock for the highest ceiling.

This lineup has had a 76.9% DREB %, the highest of any Jokic lineup (over 40 min). Defensive rebounding may be one of the most important factors in the team’s ceiling. It also has had the highest ORTG of Jokic lineups.

Otherwise no other team has that. 2) If any of the core 4 are injured in April If those 2 things aren’t happening, this team will beat anyone.

I agree. Another thing that isn’t talked about enough is experience. How many teams in NBA history have gone straight from never making a conference finals to being in the finals? I’d guess very few. That why OKC doesn’t scare me as much this year. They still haven’t learned what it takes to go that far in the playoffs. IMO Dallas is by far our biggest threat in the West. Luka is Luka and that team now has the aforementioned experience. They also have a form of twin towers you… Read more »

Jokic leads the Western Conference in All-Star voting. I know it was lame, but could we please have one more year of the Captains picking the teams. I want to see Nikola’s IDontGiveADamn team.

Nikola Jokić and Giannis Antetokounmpo lead their respective conferences in the first fan returns of #NBAAllStar Voting presented by AT&T.

Fans account for 50% of the vote to decide All-Star starters. NBA players and a media panel account for 25% each.

What benefit of the doubt are we not giving Jokic? I think everyone here recognizes him as the best player in nuggets history, best player in the world, and a 10 ten all time guy by the end of his career.

But he can’t win all by himself, as we saw in the playoffs last year.

As Jok said himself we are bad now but in a pretty good spot. They have a switch and the same core that won the title is still there so I don’t know where to help left.
The team that was built specifically to match with Denver is now gone.
I’m surprised you changed tune Tiddy I thought you would have been used to this.

We know the team is short of the rotation they expected to be using because they are getting zero minutes out of Saric, Cancar and Holmes. They might not have expected Holmes to be in the playoff rotation as a rookie but they definitely were planning regular season minutes for Holmes and Cancar and playoff minutes for Saric. It’s either make a trade now to get a better bench or wait until next year.

There is no such thing as title or bust. You give yourself the most and biggest bites at the apple that you can, and let it play out.

The doomer position is that the Nuggets currently don’t have any bite of any size, and that is wrong.

Maybe it’s ok to have different opinions? Jok gets the benefit, but it’s been proven he cannot do it by himself. I don’t see Jok playing with Shaq or other HOF players. LBJ went to 7 Finals in a row. Kobe went to multiple in a row, multiple times, our group got tired after 1.

Of course it’s ok to be a doomer and have a different opinion.

Being pessimistic doesn’t make it a trash take, perpetuating nonsense does. Like doubling, and tripling, and quadrupling down on the notion that a successful NBA offense must shoot a ton of 3s, despite that being repeatedly shown to be false.

Agreed. One we get past June, our draft capital doesn’t look too bad, with only the 27 and 29 picks moved. Trading that 31 1st for marginal value doesn’t move the bar and puts us right back into that hole with no real movable assets.

The tag system on the offensive glass is interesting. That’s the only part of this “system” I’m not familiar with (or at least not explicitly stated as a strategy for offensive rebounding). It seems like a good policy, allowing potentially more offensive rebounds without crashing in and compromising position in transition defense. Though if you’re playing against a fundamentally sound defensive rebounding team, they are supposed to all find a body first and hold good position when a shot, especially a long jump shot, goes up.

There’s such a weird split in the fanbase now, and it still seems to go back to TC/Booth. Those that were the biggest TC supporters seem to be actively rooting against the team right now. And yet, the Timberwolves have had near perfect health again (Conley is the only one of the top 8 to miss a game, and at this point that may benefit them) but are 2 games behind Denver in the standings.

I’ve seen a few things that concern me, particularly defensively and with MPJ not rebounding as well. They could use a perimeter defender against quicker guards and/or another big body to improve the interior defense and rebounding. However, the idea that nothing is going to make them a contender and this season is already over is just ridiculous.

Nuggets have a switch and it’s hard to believe it even though the team has done it multiple times. Their flaw last year was turning on the switch in Mar instead of April and hurting Jamal in the process.

I agree for the most part, but no one on the roster is equipped to defend smaller, quicker guards. KCP was best in that area because of his ability to navigate screens and stick close, but he was vulnerable to the blow by. It’s only a concern in certain match ups, but it’s there.

There was literally an article written two days ago, by an actual DS author, stating the team has no hope.

So much of the “criticism” has been deciding ahead of time that the team is bad, and then just making up the reasons to justify that belief with no regard to reality or broader context. It’s been beyond the pale the entire season.

This team does not feel at all like it did in 2023. 2023 felt like they were going to win from before the season started. And they felt like they had a whole team. Right now the team is short one or two rotation players for the playoffs. Strawther will get there but it might not be this year.

Revisionist. History.

I can’t search the site comments from 2022/23, but someone was making the exact same “seeding tends to be set in stone at this date” argument they we’ve seen recently but earlier in the season (around when Denver was the 5th seed in 22/23).

We had a couple of people here that made big bets on Denver to win the title that year before the season started. The seeding this year is so close only 3 games separate 4 from 10. I think the one seed is the only one set in stone, barring a season ending injury to SGA.

A lot of those bets were manufactured using new bettor promotions and betting on opposite sides of a random game. Actual amount at risk was 1/11th the bet (the vig essentially).

It had a different feel. Even myself who doubted (never thought the Nuggets would win it all) had a preseason bet on those Nuggets. I remember after game 2 or 3 of that regular season you could see what a difference BB and KCP were in playing the Warriors, who had just knocked them out the year prior. I came on multiple times saying they felt like they had championship vibes, because they did. You haven’t felt that this year. It may come but it’s not the same feel, yet.

Also, once you have those expectations, everything is looking through a forward lens. Fans, like the players to some extent, can’t really focus on the regular season as well and their mind is in the playoffs already. It’s all about what others are doing, and will things hold up when you get to the postseason. Whereas a younger team or one more “on the rise”, is getting excited more game by game about strawther and pickett becoming useful players for the future, or appreciating the history making numbers from Jokic,… Read more »

I have always felt like the Nuggets have a chance at a title this year if it comes together but had an uneven start. Hopefully that leads to them coming together and bringing home another title.

Yeah that will be an interesting dynamic. We have to monitor RW’s minutes in the starting lineup, and I think he could be just as valuable in a stagger, where Jamal is the first starter to the bench and RW plays a good chunk of his minutes with Jokic anyway. Malone will have a tough decision to make.

Btw, I agree with the flack because I certainly wouldn’t listen to my analyses of the draft either. 😂 Anyway I’d say now Straw will be good and Pickett will be very playable.

In my opinion, haven’t watched a lot of Russ over the last few years, Malone gets more than just some credit. He’s handled Russ much, much, MUCH better than his last two teams and 3 coaches. It’s been masterful.

Yes, Jokic in the equation certainly matters and is a huge factor.

Russ has increased his TS% each month this year, while his Usage declines each month. He’s learning to play in the flow of the team and not dominate the ball. His Usage is now at a career low and it’s been great to see him elevate his game by doing less.

The main change is that Malone took him out of the 2nd unit, which was a huge move. Russ was probably slotted to be the guy who ran the 2nd unit when they got him, but Malone saw pretty early that it brought out the WORST in Westbrook. Malone had some guts to pull that experiment, and move Murray to run the 2nd unit, a max player with growing pressure and criticism. Another coach would have kept pounding Russ with the 2nd unit and let Murray just get sync’d up… Read more »

Even before the AG injury, the rotation had been that Russ was (just about) tied at the hip to one of Jokic or Murray at all times. Like Media Res says, the minutes from ealier in the season with Russ as the bench floor general were disastrous to a much greater extent than even prior years’ crappy benches (-40ish net rating). Almost entirely going away from that concept has resulted in a huge positive swing in bench minutes.

Be careful there, SSS, which applies to the following takes. Westbrook Murray Watson Strawther Jordan is at -4. I’ll take it, and my realistic optimism is that this is where we go. Starters +15, Jokic stagger +10, non Jokic Stagger -5. WCF. But the stronger staggers with Porter and Braun(either Saric or Jordan) are> +10. With my confirmation bias blinders on this is where I go.

I’d like to see a heavier stagger with Saric as the bench C still, like you are saying. I think it’s pretty necessary that Murray and Gordon be part of that lineup. Could see an actual positive bench unit rather than the “positive swing” being a -5 net.

Murray/Westbrook/MPJ/Gordon/Saric was my suggestion a couple weeks ago.

Russ is “starting” because of AG’s injury, but even before the injury Malone was making the transition, Murray began making Murray the first starter to leave the game so he could run the second unit, and trying to get Russ away from the bench guys as much as possible. At some point he really pushed to make the majority of Russ’s minutes with Jokic. But, he has a log jam. Everyone is better playing with Jokic…the thing is though, the weak bench is particularly bad with Westbrook, and Malone is… Read more »

#6. It’s what happens when you have the equivalent of three PGs on the team and several players who are young, athletic, and aggressive who can/like to run. The faster pace also means opposing teams will score more, but to your point in #4 we still have to play D.

Russ and Mal/MPJ are still learning to play together. As such, this offense is still evolving. I think it will end up being marvelous.

Atlanta and Sac being ahead of Denver on defense is crazy as both teams don’t look like they play defense. This season is very reminiscent of 22/23 with OKC as the solid squad that wasn’t there in 22/23, but OKC could still be second round fodder if they play LAC then DAL.
Would that physical presence who can rebound be Daron Holmes? Possibly Vlatko if he comes back in Feb?

You can’t really play tight D on the three line because refs, but you can try to harass.

Great stuff! Regarding .16, could you see AG not stretching and playing this role exclusively for awhile when he comes back? It might be easier on his calf and wouldn’t screw up the chemistry of Russ starting, and not screw with Braun’s psyche as much being relegated to the second unit.

I just think if you don’t want to wear Gordon out – and he’s optimally NEXT to Jokic – you can’t having him be the 2nd unit go-to. Too many minutes, imo. If you just got one beef guy for the 2nd unit, then you could allow Gordon to moonlight there, and raise the unit even more, and even run center against the right matchups. You don’t want to be forced into playing Gordon too many minutes. You want it to be an option.

Thematically I agree, but to win a ring you need a hardcore 5 to lean on, to get through tough serieses, and those players need to all play together in the season a lot, to magnify their strengths and sync up. Especially with Russ, who is a timing player and throws unexpected windows.

I would count Murray, as he moves more to 2 guard, to be operating like James Worthy did in those offenses.

A guy who could just go and create a shot against pretty much anyone, and also was “Big Game James”, which Murray really is. They aren’t the same player, but if the Showtime… Read more »
