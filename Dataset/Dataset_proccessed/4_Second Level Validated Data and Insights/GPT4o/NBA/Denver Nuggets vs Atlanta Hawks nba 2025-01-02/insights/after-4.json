        "Westbrook said during his on-court interview postgame, 'He\u2019s the best player in the world. My job is to make the game easy for him. He does it for everybody else. It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to share the floor with him.'",
        "Malone said, 'Russ, I know for a fact, has done it all year long. He\u2019s the one guy that will talk, but I want (the rest of) them to take ownership. I want them to hold each other accountable, police each other, because when that happens, then you have a chance to be special.'",
        "Christian Braun said, 'A big part of why we\u2019ve been so good, especially these last few games, is Russ running in transition. It kind of shocked me how good of a passer he was. I knew he was a good passer. I didn\u2019t know he was this good. He plays off Nikola really well. He finds me in transition a ton. He\u2019s been great for us.'"
