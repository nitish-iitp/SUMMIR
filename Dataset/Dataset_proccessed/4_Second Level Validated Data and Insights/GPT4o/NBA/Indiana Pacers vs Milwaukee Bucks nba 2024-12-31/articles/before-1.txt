The Indiana Pacers play host to the Milwaukee Bucks at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Tuesday night. Here’s a Milwaukee Bucks vs Indiana Pacers Prediction. This article will include a Milwaukee Bucks vs Indiana Pacers Pick.
Milwaukee Bucks 

The Milwaukee Bucks have cooled off a bit recently as they've lost three of their past five games and they will be hoping to avoid a third straight defeat after falling to the Bulls in a 116-111 road defeat on Saturday. Damian Lillard led the team with 29 points and 12 assists, Brook Lopez added 22 points with seven rebounds and three blocks while Khris Middleton chipped in with 21 points, six rebounds, and four assists. As a team, the Bucks shot just 40 percent from the field and 15 of 45 from the 3-point line as they got off to a sluggish start and had to claw their way back from a 13-point deficit to take the lead late in the fourth quarter. However, the Bucks got outscored by 10-3 in the final 1:11 to allow the Bulls to snatch the game away in the end. The Bucks will face the Nets, Blazers, Raptors, and Spurs following this one.

Indiana Pacers 

Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers have been in pretty good form lately as they've won six of their last eight games overall and they will be eager to keep it going after taking down the Celtics in a 123-114 road win on Sunday. Tyrese Haliburton led the team with 31 points and seven assists on 11 of 19 shooting, Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard scored 17 points each while Bennedict Mathurin chipped in with 14 points. As a team, the Pacers shot 52 percent from the field and nine of 23 from the 3-point line as they took control of the contest with a 38-point burst in the second quarter to take the early lead before they finished with a flurry in the fourth quarter to push the margin out to 16 points at one stage. 

Why the Indiana Pacers will win
The Pacers have won 12 of their last 13 home games against the Bucks following a road win.
The Bucks have lost each of their last six road games after losing as favorites.
The Pacers have covered the spread in seven of their last eight games at Gainbridge Fieldhouse against Eastern Conference opponents that held a winning record.
The Bucks have failed to cover the spread in each of their last four day games against Eastern Conference opponents that held a losing record.
Total Points Facts
Each of the Pacers' last eight home games against the Bucks has gone OVER the total points line.
Each of the Bucks' last six Tuesday games as underdogs has gone UNDER the total points line.
Milwaukee Bucks vs Indiana Pacers Prediction

The Bucks could be a little shorthanded for this one with Giannis Antetokounmpo listed as questionable with an illness, while the Pacers are still keeping eyes on Obi Toppin who is questionable for this one. The Bucks are in a bit of a rut and they are coming into this one fresh off a tough loss to the Bulls, so this could be a good spot for the Pacers who will be full of confidence after beating the Celtics in their last game. The Bucks have more than enough firepower to get the win even if Antetokounmpo isn't able to suit up, but the Pacers have been playing better basketball over the last week or so and I think they can earn another statement win and cover at the short line.
