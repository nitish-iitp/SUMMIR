"Thought he was Caitlin Clark?": Fans blast Luka Doncic for "stupid" shot attempt in clutch with red-hot Kyrie Irving ball watching. (Image Source: Imagn)

Hoops fans were quick to criticize Luka Doncic after the Dallas Mavericks endured a heartbreaking 122-120 loss to the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. Frustrations ran high over Doncic’s decision-making in the clutch, especially with the Mavericks holding a 120-118 lead and just over a minute left on the clock.

With the shot clock winding down, the five-time NBA All-Star chose to go one-on-one against Peyton Watson, dribbling for a few seconds before launching a deep 3-pointer, which missed badly. The Nuggets capitalized on this opportunity, outmaneuvering the Mavericks in the final minute to secure a thrilling victory.

Fans voiced strong opinions on Doncic’s choice to take the deep shot instead of running the offense through Kyrie Irving, who was on fire in the fourth quarter. Kyrie, who scored 16 points in the final period, had set a screen for Doncic, then watched as the Slovenian star opted to go one-on-one against Watson.

"Kyrie should’ve touched the ball in every clutch possession idk why Luka thought he needed to be the hero," said another.
"Agreed but he was going for the 3 for 2. Still a force and could have tried to create earlier and have the same outcome," wrote another X user.

Meanwhile, Doncic had a tough night from beyond the arc, hitting just two of his nine shots. The Mavericks star ended the game with 24 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, one steal and one block.
