1. NUGGETS WIN 5TH STRAIGHT, DUBS TOP OKC, KINGS SNAP SUNS’ STREAK

Nuggets 122, Mavericks 120: In a game that included 22 lead changes and 15 ties, it was Michael Porter Jr. that hit the game-winning floater with 6.5 seconds left to lift the Nuggets over the Mavs for their fifth straight win.

Joker, Russ & Big O: This was Jokić’s 10th career game with at least 15 points, rebounds and assists, tying him with teammate Russell Westbrook for the second-most all-time behind Oscar Robertson (15)
Joker, Luka & Big O: Jokić’s second career game with 35+ points, 15+ rebounds and 15+ assists tied him with Luka Dončić for the second-most all-time, behind Robertson (5)

Warriors 127, Thunder 116: The Warriors got 36 points and seven 3s from Steph Curry and used one of their trademark 3rd quarters – outscoring OKC 42-21 to build a 30-point lead – before holding off a late rally from the Thunder to hand OKC its first home loss and give both teams matching 8-2 records 10 games into the season. | Recap

3. JOVIĆ SEALS HEAT WIN, ROCKETS EDGE PISTONS, LAKERS & GRIZZLIES ROLL

Grizzlies 134, Blazers 89: Jaren Jackson Jr. (20 pts, 7 reb, 3 stl, 3 3s) led seven Grizzlies with at least 12 points as the Grizzlies took the lead for good four minutes and four seconds into the game and never looked back, posting the fourth-largest win in franchise history (45 pts). | Recap

4. TONIGHT: CAVS GO FOR 12-0, CLIPPERS GO FOR 5TH STRAIGHT W

Cavaliers at Bulls (8 ET, League Pass): On Saturday, the Cavaliers overcame a 14-point deficit against Brooklyn to extend their perfect start to the season, becoming the 12th team to ever open a season 11-0.

Tonight in Chicago, they’ll look to join an even more exclusive club as only seven teams have ever began a season with a dozen straight wins.

Golden State Warriors (2015): 24 games
Houston Rockets (1993): 15
Washington Capitols (1948): 15
Dallas Mavericks (2002): 14
Boston Celtics (1957): 14
Chicago Bulls (1996): 12
Seattle SuperSonics (1982): 12

The last time these teams met – on Feb. 28 – the Bulls prevailed in double overtime to snap a seven-game losing streak to the Cavs that dated back to the start of the 2022-23 season. Can Chicago make it two in a row over Cleveland and spoil the Cavs’ historic start?

Clippers at Thunder (8 ET, NBA TV): When these teams met in Los Angeles on Nov. 2, the Thunder held the Clippers to a season-low 92 points, kept the Clippers winless at the Intuit Dome (0-4) and handed the Clippers their third straight loss (2-4).

The Clippers have not lost since – embarking on a four-game win streak, including their first three wins at their new home arena. Tonight in OKC, the Clippers look to extend their win streak to five in a row against a Thunder team coming off a 127-116 loss to Golden State on Sunday night.

Powell Power: Over LA’s last four games, Norm Powell is averaging a team-best 26 points per game while shooting a blistering 61.3% from 3 on just under eight attempts per game
Finding The Way: After the best start of the OKC era (7-0), the Thunder have dropped two of their last three games and will look to get back on track in their first game without Chet Holmgren

Three more games tip off at 8 ET on League Pass: Kings at Spurs; Nets at Pelicans, Wizards at Rockets.

5. EMIRATES NBA CUP COUNTDOWN: WEST GROUP C PREVIEW

The Emirates NBA Cup 2024 tips off tomorrow, with the first eight games of Group Play on the first of seven Cup Nights – all games played on Tuesdays and Friday from Nov. 12-Dec. 3 will all count toward the Emirates NBA Cup group standings.

Our countdown previewing every group in the competition wraps up today with West Group C – a group that features the past three teams to represent the West in the NBA Finals: Golden State (2022, won title). Denver (2023, won title) and Dallas (2024).

Here are the five teams in West Group C, ranked in order of win percentage in head-to-head matchups from last season against the other teams within the group.

Denver Nuggets: 12-2 (.857)
Dallas Mavericks: 8-7 (.533)
New Orleans Pelicans: 7-7 (.500)
Memphis Grizzlies: 5-10 (.333)
Golden State Warriors: 4-10 (.286)

The full 10-game Group Play schedule is above. Here are three matchups to circle:

Mavs at Warriors (Nov. 12, 10 ET, TNT): Klay Thompson returns to Golden State for the first time since joining the Mavericks in the offseason. The Warriors will “Salute Captain Klay” prior to tip-off to honor the four-time champion before his first game as a visitor at Chase Center
Mavs at Nuggets (Nov. 22, 10 ET, ESPN): A clash of the past two Western Conference champions and two of the biggest global stars in the game – Dallas’ Luka Dončić and Denver’s Nikola Jokić, the reigning scoring champ and league MVP, respectively
Warriors at Nuggets (Dec. 3, 10 ET, TNT): Both teams have tasted championship success – the Warriors in 2022, the Nuggets in 2023 – and are eager to get back to the mountain top. Denver swept the season series a year ago, but three of the four games were decided by six points or less
