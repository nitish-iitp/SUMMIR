        "Josh Hart emphasized the importance of team focus and energy, stating, 'We've got to make sure we are focused, that we give off the right energy. We can't have our own individual agendas, can't do any of that. We've got to make sure we're locked in on this team, sacrificing on this team, and go out there and play.'",
        "Jalen Brunson reflected on the need to impact the game in other areas when shots aren't falling, saying, 'The ball's not going in for us but that shouldn't be the reason why we're not winning games. We've got to find a way to impact the game in other areas when we're not making shots and it starts with me.'"
