JAKARTA Cole Anthony scored 14 out of a total of 24 points in the second half as Orlando Magic, who lacked players, won over New York Knicks with a score of 103-94 on Monday 6 January or Tuesday morning WIB at Madison Square Garden.

Total Carter Jr. scored 19 points from the bench, while Kentavideny Badminton-Pope added 15 points and Jonathan Isaac, also from the bench, contributed 13 points to Magic.

Armed with this victory, Magic managed to avoid a clean sweep defeat in four regular seasons against the Knicks, although they played without mainstay players such as Franz Wagner (right oblique injury), Jalen Siggs (back injury), and Moritz Wagner (left ACL injury).

Paolo Banchero, Magic's young star, who has scored an average of 29 points in his first five games of the season, is also still missing the 33rd straight game due to a right-handed oblique injury.

Carter, who previously only managed to get 8 of 50 three-point shots this season, scored three-point shot without missing against the Knicks.

In the Knicks, Josh Hart recorded double-doubles with 15 points and 14 rebounds, while Jalen Brunson and Mikal Bridges each contributed 24 points. However, the Knicks suffered their third straight defeat, which is their longest consecutive defeat of the season.

Precious Achiuwa added 10 points from the bench for Knicks, who also played without Karl-Anthony Towns due to a knee injury. Towns, which has 30-doubly doubled in 34 games this season, is a huge loss to the team.

Knicks recorded their lowest three-point shot percentage this season, only 18.2 percent (4 out of 22), and failed to score three points in 15 consecutive attempts before Cameron Payne slotted a three-point shot at the last second.

Knicks had taken the lead in the first quarter, but both teams exchanged advantages nine times in the second quarter. Jett Howard gave Magic a lead that was no longer overtaken by a three-point shot before buzzer, making the score 53-51.

Anthony, son of former Knicks's Greg Anthony, scored eight points in the third quarter as Magic outperformed Knicks 22-17.

Mikal Bridges had brought the Knicks closer with a score of 83-78 through a jump shot at 7:53 in the fourth quarter. However,minton-Pope answered with a three-point shot, and Carter added two points after Bridges failed to score. The Knicks never got more than six points away, while Magic had a lead of up to 12 points towards the end of the game.
