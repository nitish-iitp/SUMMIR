Zach Edey Stats Tonight: How did Grizzlies rookie fare vs Magic in 3rd game of the season? (Oct. 26) (Image Credit: Imagn)

Memphis Grizzlies rookie center Zach Edey played his third NBA game Saturday night. This time, they clashed against the undefeated Orlando Magic at FedEx Forum, with Edey starting for the shorthanded Grizzlies.

The first quarter was discreet for the former Purdue star. He only played three minutes and scored two points on 1-of-1 from the field. His two early fouls became an issue and was replaced by Brandon Clarke early in the first period.

Zach Edey clocked five minutes in the second quarter, adding three points to her account on 2-of-3 from the field and 1-of-1 from deep.

The third quarter saw Edey play for three more minutes, but he added two more personal fouls to the stat sheet. He sat for the rest of the third quarter as the Grizzlies took an 83-70 lead with 3:43 on the clock.

Edey played two more minutes the rest of the game, which didn't alter his numbers. He finished the night with 13 minutes, seven points and one rebound, but his four personal fouls played a key role in his reduced activity.

The Memphis Grizzlies didn't have much trouble beating the Orlando Magic, as they asserted their dominance from the very beginning. After a 34-24 first-quarter win, they followed with a 35-19 victory in the second quarter. The Magic responded with a 35-21 third-quarter win, but the home team secured the win with a one-point win in the fourth quarter (34-33).

Santi Aldama led the way off the bench with 22 points. Jay Huff added 18 points while Ja Morant contributed 16 units.

Zach Edey keeps adjusting to the NBA

The first three games of Zach Edey's career have been different from one another. He scored five and 13 points, respectively, in his first two games. Edey was one rebound shy of a double-double against the Rockets and entered this matchup keen to improve his numbers and get more minutes on the court.

Following that first game, he made sure he would bounce back, as Taylor Jenkins revealed on Friday.

"When I went to him yesterday to address the first game, he said, 'Hey, just keep going. I'll get better one day at a time.' I think his head space is in a great spot. He knows he is learning a lot right now. ... Things didn't go his way, but he is gonna get better from herein. He understands that."

The season is just starting and Edey is still young. If he finds consistency, he can be a solid contributor for the Grizzlies.
