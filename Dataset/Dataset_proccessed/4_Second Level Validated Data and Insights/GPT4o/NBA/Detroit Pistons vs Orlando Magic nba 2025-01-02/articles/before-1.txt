Detroit Pistons head coach J.B. Bickerstaff was visibly emotional following the game as he addressed Jaden Ivey’s devastating injury. Speaking afterward, Bickerstaff shared his thoughts on the atmosphere in the locker room, highlighting the strong bond and genuine care the players have for one another during such a difficult moment.

"It’s tough. No better teammate, person than JI," Bickerstaff said. "No one who cares more about this thing than him. It’s tough to see.
"They care about each other, and they care about JI and what this means to him and the sacrifices he’s made within his game, within himself to help this team. They banded together because they know that’s what he would’ve wanted him to do."
