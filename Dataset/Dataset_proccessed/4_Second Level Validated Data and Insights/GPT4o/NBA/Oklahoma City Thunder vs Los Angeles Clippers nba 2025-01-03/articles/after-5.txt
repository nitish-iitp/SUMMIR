The Oklahoma City Thunder earned their 13th consecutive NBA victory — and longest winning streak since the franchise moved to Oklahoma City — in a 116-98 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points and Jalen Williams added 18 to help the Thunder move within one win of the franchise’s all-time longest winning streak.

The Thunder, leading the NBA in points off turnovers, cranked up the heat defensively in the third quarter to take control. Oklahoma City forced seven turnovers in the third and turned those into 17 points on the other end to help them outscore the Clippers 42-20 in the frame. The Thunder scored 31 total points off turnovers in the win.

But unlike Tuesday’s win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, there was no fourth-quarter push that put the game in jeopardy. That allowed Thunder coach Mark Daigneault to sit Gilgeous-Alexander for the entire fourth quarter on the first night of a back-to-back.

The Clippers’ leading scorer this season, Norman Powell, missed his first 10 shots and didn’t connect until four minutes into the fourth. The shooting guard finished with a season-low six points on 1-of-11 shooting.

Amir Coffey led Los Angeles with a season-high 26 points.

While the Clippers got off to a hot start offensively, making seven of their first 10 shots, Oklahoma City was cold, especially from deep.

The Thunder sank just one of nine shots from beyond the arc in the first quarter as Los Angeles finished the frame with a 10-2 run to take an eight-point lead into the second.

The Clippers continued to find success in the second, stretching the run to 20-4 to lead by 16 points early in the second.

But just as they did Tuesday, when Oklahoma City cut a 12-point second-quarter deficit in half by halftime, the Thunder entered the third quarter with some momentum.
