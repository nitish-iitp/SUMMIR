OKLAHOMA CITY — Passing it out to the perimeter, Jalen Williams found Kenrich Williams for the 3-pointer. The outside shot pushed OKC's lead to a game-high 28 points. That was enough for LA to clear its bench and wave the white flag with over seven minutes left.

The Oklahoma City Thunder collected a 116-98 win over the LA Clippers. OKC has extended its win streak to a franchise-record 13 in a row.

The early stages of this contest certainly didn't look like another blowout win for OKC. The Clippers finished the first quarter on a 12-2 run to exit it with a 30-22 advantage. The Thunder's offense once again looked clunky to start.

The Thunder couldn't buy a bucket from outside as they started 1-of-10 from deep. The Clippers were the opposite as they suddenly led by as many as 16 points. A quick eight straight points helped the Thunder stop the bleeding. They scored 26 points in the second frame as Williams hit a floater to cut it to a manageable 52-48 halftime deficit.

Then, the OKC avalanche started. The third quarter has been the Thunder's money quarter this season. After the break, they were rejuvenated and overwhelmed LA like they did the Minnesota Timberwolves in their New Year's Eve win.

Williams kept his momentum going. He scored on a driving layup. And then did it again. And again. He then stole the basketball from Ivica Zubac and fed Isaiah Hartenstein the easy dunk. Before the Clippers could even register what happened, the Thunder suddenly had a 56-55 lead with over 10 minutes left.

The Thunder suffocated the Clippers with a decisive 27-7 run filled with LA turnovers and struggling to produce quality shots. OKC outscored it in the third quarter 42-20 to completely flip the scoreboard. They entered the third quarter in a six-point hole and exited with an 18-point cushion.

The fourth quarter became inconsequential. This was a surprising result considering how the game played out in the first half. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the frame. Williams and Hartenstein played less than five minutes in the quarter. It's valuable rest for OKC on a tough back-to-back.

The Thunder shot 50% from the field and went 14-of-38 (36.8%) from 3. They went 16-of-20 from the free-throw line. They had 29 assists on 43 baskets. Four Thunder players scored double-digit points.

Gilgeous-Alexander finished with an efficient 29 points. Williams had 18 points thanks to a hot second half. Hartenstein stuffed the stat sheet with a near 11-point triple-double.

Meanwhile, the Clippers struggled without Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. They shot 47% from the field and went 11-of-32 (34.4%) from 3. They went 11-of-17 from the free-throw line. They had 25 assists on 38 baskets. Five Clippers players scored double-digit points.

Amir Coffey led the way with 26 points on 10-of-14 shooting and went 6-of-8 from 3. Zubac had 11 points and nine rebounds. Mo Bamba had 12 points and eight rebounds. Norman Powell was limited to six points on 1-of-11 shooting.

Once Harden was ruled out, this became an easy contest for the Thunder. The short-handed Clippers didn't have their two best players and already struggled on offense. OKC took care of business after a sloppy start and turned this into a lopsided win thanks to a dominating third quarter.

Let's look at Thunder player grades:

Swinging right then left, Gilgeous-Alexander had Derrick Jones Jr. lost on an island. The MVP candidate splashed in a mid-range jumper before Jones Jr. even realized what occurred.

It was a fitting final bucket for Gilgeous-Alexander in a ho-hum performance. He finished with 29 points on 9-of-17 shooting, eight assists and three rebounds. He shot 2-of-5 from 3 and went 9-of-9 from the free-throw line.

Gilgeous-Alexander only logged 30 minutes before he sat out the fourth quarter. The Clippers blitzed the MVP candidate and forced him to be a facilitator. It's a sound strategy on paper but fell apart as the game progressed. He finished with 14 points in the first half but exploded for 15 in the third quarter.

The jumper rattled in from within the perimeter but Gilgeous-Alexander kept attacking the Clippers. LA conceded shooting fouls instead of easy baskets. That resulted in a busy night from the charity stripe for the 26-year-old.

The depleted Clippers were light work for Gilgeous-Alexander. He didn't need to go at full speed to put them away. Instead, OKC only needed one monster quarter to escape with another win.

In a race against time, Williams ran down the floor in seconds before he banked in a buzzer-beating floater at the end of the first half. What was a rough first 24 minutes soon became forgettable. The 23-year-old carried that momentum into the start of the second half.

Williams finished with 18 points on 8-of-14 shooting, four assists and three rebounds. He shot 1-of-3 from 3 and went 1-of-2 from the free-throw line.

On the opening play of the second half, Williams had a clear lane to the basket thanks to a Hartenstein screen. He scored on the layup. They again ran the same play with the same success. A minute later, the 23-year-old cut to the basket and was rewarded with a running layup as the seven-footer found him on a bounce pass.

In three minutes, Williams turned this from a rough outing to a positive. He scored 10 points in the third frame as the Thunder ran away from this contest.

Waiting for Gilgeous-Alexander to find a seam, Hartenstein collected two quick assists thanks to his patented bounce pass. Dunking, facilitating or rebounding, the seven-footer has been OKC's most versatile starter.

Hartenstein finished with 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting, nine rebounds, six assists and two blocks.

On the other end, Hartenstein held Zubac to just 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting. Because of LA's absences, it tried to give him additional scoring opportunities that didn't work out. His scoring limitations were exposed without an elite playmaker.

Hartenstein has been the Thunder's third-best player since his return. The double-double machine is enjoying a career season. He'll get a chance to play against his old team the New York Knicks on the second night of this back-to-back.

While Cason Wallace has mostly earned the fifth starter spot, Daigneault likes to throw the occasional curveball. That happened in this win with Wiggins receiving the rare start.

Wiggins finished with nine points on 4-of-7 shooting, four rebounds and two assists. He shot 1-of-3 from 3.

Against the Clippers, the Thunder are afforded a chance to experiment. Wiggins has been a good fit with the starters and gets plenty of open looks because of them. On his 26th birthday, he had a solid start.
