Analysis: Work to do for Wolves

Wolves clearly have some work to do to find rhythm and chemistry.

Just did not seem connected on either end.

I expected some clunkiness early this season and there was a LOT of it tonight.

Newest Timberwolves make their debut

Both Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo made their regular season debuts for the Timberwolves tonight just weeks after the blockbuster trade that sent the pair to Minnesota. Randle finished with a decent stateline, scoring 16 points on 5-10 shooting, adding nine rebounds and four assists. The offense looked clunky at points but that is to be expected and head coach Chris Finch did a good job of getting him involved early.

DiVincenzo finished with 10 points, but shot just 3-11 from the field and 2-8 from deep. He also added three rebounds, two assists and two steals in his 31 minutes of action.

Anthony Edwards leads Minnesota in scoring

On a night where the Timberwolves struggled to get going on offense, Anthony Edwards was burdened with carrying Minnesota's offense. While it was not his most efficient game, finishing with 27 points on 10-25 shooting, Edwards was aggressive all night and displayed a willingness to fire away from deep. It was also clear that he is still acclimating to the additions of Donte DiVincenzo and Julius Randle.

Monster night for Anthony Davis

Late in the fourth quarter, Anthony Davis stepped to the free-throw line as he was serenaded with "MVP" chants. Yes, it's only game one of the regular season but Davis earned those cheers tonight after a dominant performance. He finished with 36 points, 16 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocks, completely taking over both ends of the court. Davis even knocked down a three-pointer, an element of his game he hopes to continue to develop this season.

Great start to the season for The Brow.

Analysis: A statement win for the Lakers

This was a statement win from the Lakers — and a reminder of how good this team can be.

This starting lineup went 18-6 to close last season and picked up where they left off, only now with better organization and creativity on both sides of the floor.

LeBron James on Bronny: 'He's my lifeline, that's for sure.'

Getty Images

LeBron and Bronny participated in the postgame interview with TNT's Taylor Rooks.

Never before until tonight, there was a father-son duo to share the court in an NBA regular season game.

Bronny said the moment he will remember was "checking in for the first time" alongside his Dad.

"Crazy moment I will never forget," Bronny said.

As for what the moment meant to LeBron?

"It’s always been family over everything," LeBron said. "To be able to have this moment working still and working alongside my son, it’s one of the greatest gifts I got from the man above and I’m going to take full advantage of it."

With almost five minutes remaining, the Lakers are up 11 against the Timberwolves.

One other look we're seeing more from the J.J. Redick Lakers: Isolating Anthony Davis at the free-throw line extended.

That's been Joel Embiid's favorite spot on the floor for the last few years.

If AD is hitting his jumper, he's tough to guard from that spot.

The Lakers have only turned the ball over 5 times in the game.

Another sign that Minnesota's defense, No. 1 in the league last season, has not been up to its standard.

Encouraging stuff from Jaxson Hayes and Dalton Knecht on this LeBron-centric Lakers second unit. Knecht's shooting is spreading the floor, while Hayes' leaping ability is providing a jolt on pick-and-rolls.

If either or both of those players can give the Lakers quality minutes nightly, their depth issues may turn out to be overblown.

Are things starting to turn back L.A.'s direction?
