Sports Maven: What does the Thunder-Cavaliers showdown say about OKC's outlook?

The Oklahoma City Thunder (30-6, currently No. 1 in the Western Conference) got the showcase in the biggest regular-season game thus far that counted toward its record (since the NBA Cup final loss to the Milwaukee Bucks didn't) while playing the Cleveland Cavaliers (32-4, currently No. 1 in the Eastern Conference) on Wednesday in the battle of the two best teams, neither of which had made it as teams in the national focus.

The Thunder went into the game having won nine straight games, and the Cavs have now won 11 straight after pulling out the 129-22 victory against OKC at home. Cleveland led the last 9:05 of the game, although it was almost entirely within five points. 

Despite the high score, the Thunder played well on defense, forcing 15 turnovers and getting nine steals. OKC forced Donovan Mitchell, the Cavs' leading scorer at 22.9 points per game, to shoot 3-of-16 from the field on the way to 11 points. 

However, the Thunder struggled in an area that hurt them in the Western Conference semifinals loss to the Dallas Mavericks last year, as Cleveland outrebounded OKC 40-38, including 10-6 in the fourth quarter. The Cavs grabbed 29.3 percent of available offensive rebounds (12 total) and the Thunder got 24.3 percent (nine total). The reason is as simple as the fact that the Cavs start two post players, Evan Mobley (10 rebounds on Wednesday, 8.7 per game this season) and Jarrett Allen (11 rebounds this game, 10.1 per game this year), while OKC has started one post player, Isaiah Hartenstein (11 rebounds this game, 12.1 per game in 21 contests this year). 

The Thunder also were impacted by a rebounding disadvantage (52-43) in the 97-81 loss to the Bucks in the NBA Cup final on Dec. 17.

With Chet Holmgren still out for a while due to a hip injury, Hartenstein is playing a bigger role than expected and OKC's guards have had to crash the boards more than they might otherwise. The Thunder are 23rd in offensive rebound percentage (22.3 percent) and 27th in defensive rebound percentage (73.2 percent). 

In a game like this when the Thunder get outdone in some shooting areas, being able to match the opponent in rebounding. The Thunder shot 53.3 percent from the field while the Cavs shot 52.2 percent, but the Cavs made 41.7 percent from 3-point range on 36 attempts against 35.5 percent on 33 attempts by the Thunder and hit 20 of 27 free throws while the Thunder only got 17 free-throw attempts and made 15. 

Sure, the Thunder had two fewer turnovers, but more needs to be made up in other areas when facing a disadvantage in long-range and free-throw activity. 

The Thunder don't have many forward-sized players. Jaylin Williams, the 6-8 forward, has only played nine games after missing the first part of the season due to illness, and averages 3.1 rebounds in only 11.9 minutes per game. Ultimately, the the Fort Smith native is limited since his physical tools won't enable him to win many matchups. Kenrich Williams, a 6-7 forward who gets 2.9 rebounds in 13.8 minutes per game, has seen his action scaled down.

Granted, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has the length to get a fair number of rebounds, averaging 5.6 per game. 

SGA, who is third in the NBA with 31.3 points per game, scored a game-high 31 points on Wednesday, but didn't get all his ideal 3-point looks while going 1-of-6 from long range. Another day could be different. That's a reason why one game in a matchup between the two best team isn't definitive.

The Thunder will play the Cavs at home on Jan. 16. The matchup next week at Paycom Center could bring a different dynamic between the Thunder's top-rated defense (104 points allowed per 100 possessions) and the Cavs' top-rated offense (122.2 points per 100 possessions). As loud as that arena is, the Cavs might not get as many foul calls.

One thing is for sure. Even though OKC and Cleveland are small markets, many want to see more of this (perhaps in the NBA Finals). David Aldridge of The Athletic requested a seven-game series between them. Old-time Boston Globe writer Bob Ryan declared Thunder-Cavs to be "basketball as it should be."

If the Thunder get to their first NBA Finals since 2012 and face the Cavs, they will have time to make sure Holmgren is healthy and set their defense against an elite offensive team.
