Looking at Steph Curry's stats in Warriors' season opener - Image Source: Imagn

The Golden State Warriors tipped off their 2024-25 season on Wednesday night against the Portland Trail Blazers with a revamped lineup supporting core players Steph Curry and Draymond Green.

This game marked the Warriors' first regular-season game without Klay Thompson since drafting him in 2011. While Curry remains the centerpiece of their offense, the 2024-25 season will be one to watch as the team navigates its new identity.

In the Warriors' season opener, Steph Curry showed out with a near triple-double despite a poor shooting night. He scored 17 points, dished out 10 assists and pulled down nine rebounds on 40% shooting, steering Golden State to a dominant 139-104 win.

Steph Curry reveals expectations for 2024-25 Warriors

Steph Curry expressed that despite the offseason changes, the Warriors are still focused on chasing another championship. After winning the title in 2022, the team’s performance steadily declined, losing in the Western Conference semifinals in 2023 and missing the playoffs entirely in 2024.

Speaking to "SportsCenter", Curry affirmed the team's championship ambitions despite the roster shakeup.

“The season is fun. Competing with my guys, trying to chase another championship," Curry said. "You know that the ball is going to stop bouncing at some point. For me, I love this environment. I love being out there on the floor."

To bolster this championship goal, the Warriors are expected to execute another “significant” trade during the 2024-25 season, as reported by The Athletic’s Anthony Slater. He mentioned the likelihood of a "consolidation trade" involving rotation players, draft picks, and young talent to strengthen the team.

“They’ll make a significant trade: In a slightly upgraded form, the Warriors have the same problem as a season ago,” Slater said.
“I imagine they’ll win enough games to stay in the playoff mix, tick off a couple of capable players who are buried in the rotation and then, once January or February nears, find a consolidation trade that better balances the roster and rotation,” he added.

Under new GM Mike Dunleavy Jr., the Warriors have shown they’re willing to make tough decisions, including trading longtime players like Thompson, to keep the team competitive.
