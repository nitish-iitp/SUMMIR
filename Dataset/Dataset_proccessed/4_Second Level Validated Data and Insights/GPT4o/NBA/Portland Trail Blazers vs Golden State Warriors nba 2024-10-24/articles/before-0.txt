POR vs GSW Dream11 Prediction – Top Fantasy Picks

Stephen Curry, after a rest on the final pre-season game, Stephen Curry will be up for a task with new sharp-shooting partner in Buddy Hield. Creativity in shooting and space creation has been his main game and the 3-pointer maestro can change the game at will. Even on his off days, the star gives an average of 38-40 Dream11 points. He is a must-have pick for your POR vs GSW Dream11 team.

Deandre Ayton, since his move to Portland, the star is back to his best. Used as screen and ‘paint general’ Ayton has cemented his position as the next ‘big man’ in the league. He is great with rebounds and creating second-chance opportunities for his team. Ayton averages close to 34 Dream11 points per game. He’s a strong pick for today’s matchup.

Anfernee Simons of the Portland Trailblazers is developing in a scoring ‘juggernaut’ for his side. The departure of Lillard allowed Simons more time on the ball and is a focal point of scoring for his side. With an average 32 of Dream 11 points, is also a valuable pick in the POR vs GSW Dream 11.
