Suns’ Kevin Durant, tired of leadership criticism, calls ESPN star ‘a clown to me’

PHOENIX — Mike Budenholzer was recently asked about Kevin Durant’s leadership over the past month. The first-year Phoenix Suns coach didn’t hold back. He said Durant has been “off the charts.” He praised Durant’s actions. He praised his voice. And he said the veteran forward has set the tone for the Phoenix organization.

After Saturday night’s 103-97 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, which increased the Suns’ record to 5-1, Durant was asked for his reaction to Budenholzer’s comments.

First, Durant wanted to know something: “Why’d you ask him that?” he said.

Durant’s leadership is not a new NBA topic, but during an Oct. 24 episode of “First Take,” ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith used it as a reason to argue against the Suns as a serious contender. The popular basketball analyst praised Durant’s greatness and commitment, but he questioned the 14-time All-Star’s leadership and ability to inspire teammates.

After “First Take” posted the segment on social media, Durant responded on X, telling Smith that he respectfully disagreed and that he would argue “passionately” that his intangibles have always been on par with his talent.

In the Phoenix locker room Saturday night, after several teammates had already left Footprint Center, Durant spoke more forcefully.

“Yeah, Stephen A., I don’t understand how people even listen to Stephen A.,” he told The Athletic. “I’ve been in the league for 18 years. I’ve never seen Stephen A. at a practice, or a film session, or a shoot-around. I’ve never seen him anywhere but on TV talking s— about players. … He’s a clown to me. He’s always been a clown. You can write that, too.”

Smith, who has worked for more than three decades as an NBA and general sports columnist and multimedia personality, is not the first to question Durant’s leadership. Perhaps the sport’s most influential voice, Charles Barkley called Durant a “follower” during last season’s NBA All-Star weekend. If it’s not a sensitive topic for Durant, it’s an irritating one.

Durant doesn’t claim to be a perfect basketball player — “Of course, I got things I need to work on,” he said — but he said when people try to find something to criticize about his game, they often settle on leadership, “stuff that’s, like, so vague and subjective.”

For much of his nine seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder, he was widely considered a leader of a rising team. At the end of each season, The Oklahoman published report cards on each player. Durant often got As in efficiency, defensive rebounding — and leadership. A headline about him in the Charlotte Observer once read: “Thunder star provides leadership to a team in transition but with expectations.”

Since leaving Oklahoma City in 2016, Durant has played for Golden State, where he won two titles, Brooklyn and Phoenix. And often, even while climbing to eighth on the NBA’s career scoring list, his leadership skills come up, especially when his teams fail to reach expectations.

In a recent phone interview, former Suns assistant coach Kevin Young said leadership comes in different forms. During his four seasons with the Suns, point guard Chris Paul led more with his voice, while Durant did so with his work habits. Young said there’s no secret sauce for Durant. He shows up every day and works hard. Then he shows up the next day and does the same thing. And the next day.

“But make no mistake about it, Kev speaks up in film sessions,” said Young, now the head coach at BYU. “Kev wants to win. He’s probably more vocal behind the scenes than I think people realize. At least he was in my experience.”

With Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, the Suns last season were expected to contend. Instead, they won 49 games and were swept in the postseason’s first round. The Athletic reported after the season that Durant was not always happy with how he was used in the offense, but that he also may not have adamantly voiced those concerns with the coaching staff. In May, owner Mat Ishbia and the front office fired then-coach Frank Vogel and later hired Budenholzer, setting the organization on a new path.

Durant, of course, remained a centerpiece.

“We’re kind of through the camp phase of life, but how hard he went in camp, the drills and the different things,” Budenholzer said last week of Durant. “He set the tone for us as an organization, for us as a team. And it’s not just been by leadership. It’s been his voice. He’s put his arms around young players. He’s put his arm around veterans. He’s put his arm around me. It’s something that’s important to us. I don’t know if he likes it or knows it, but I’m going to keep pushing him to be his best, in all ways, including as a leader.”

Asked if he’s tried to be more vocal this season, Durant, 36, said he’s been the “same dude.”

“Obviously, you grow as a human being, you get more comfortable with yourself, you get more comfortable talking to crowds as you experience more and more in the league,” he said in the locker room. “… I’ve always been on this trajectory, of diving deep into the game, not just for myself but for the whole team. To say that I’m just sitting here, you paint this picture of me coming into the locker room, not talking to my teammates, quiet, not talking to my coaches. Like, come on, man. It’s just ridiculous.”

Conversations with teammates about Durant’s leadership almost always start with his work ethic. It’s not so much the time that Durant puts in as the intensity and focus with which he attacks each session. Booker said the pace of Durant’s workouts is second to none.

“It’s contagious,” point guard Tyus Jones said. “He’s an all-time great. You see him showing up, going 110 percent each and every day, working on his craft. Even in Year 18, he’s still looking for ways to get better. He’s still pushing himself to get better. How do you not do the same?”

Reserve point guard Monte Morris played five seasons in Denver with star big man Nikola Jokić. He said Jokić would encourage him to make plays, and he said Durant has had a similar message here. Beal said Durant’s encouragement has helped rookie Ryan Dunn get off to such a solid start.

“A lot of times you’re in your mindset, you’re in ‘kill mode,’ and you want everybody else to follow suit,” Beal said. “But that encouragement that he gives and that confidence he gives Ryan, that goes a long way. That’s a reason why guys step up and play the way they do, when you have guys like (Durant) backing you up.”

“Everybody has their ways of getting into other people,” forward Josh Okogie said. “Some people are ‘rah-rah’ guys. We don’t have a lot of ‘rah-rah’ guys in here. We have guys who are all about results. You either do it or you don’t, and Kevin is a good guy who makes sure everybody is held accountable.”

For Durant, it’s a tired topic, and one that’s not likely to go away. But he’s happy about one thing.

“I’m glad my coaches and teammates got my back,” he said.
