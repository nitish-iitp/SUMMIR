Devin Booker recorded 28 points, nine rebounds and nine assists to help the Phoenix Suns notch a 103-97 victory over the visiting Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday night.

The Suns let a 26-point, fourth-quarter lead dwindle to two before holding off Portland for their fourth straight victory and fifth in six games this season.

Kevin Durant registered 21 points and nine rebounds and Grayson Allen scored 18 points off the bench for Phoenix. Bradley Beal and Tyus Jones added 15 points apiece for the Suns.

Jerami Grant and Anfernee Simons scored 20 points apiece for the Trail Blazers, who have lost five of their first seven games this season.

Deni Avdija had 13 points, Dalano Banton added 12 and Deandre Ayton had 10 points and 13 boards.

Phoenix shot just 37.6 percent from the field, going 17-for-52 from 3-point range.

Portland also struggled, hitting 33.3 percent of its attempts from the field and 14 of 43 from behind the arc.

The Trail Blazers made it close, as Simons and Grant each scored five points during a 15-0 run that moved Portland within 97-94 with 1:33 remaining.

Booker hit a baseline jumper with 1:18 left, but Banton answered with a trey with 1:04 to go to get the Trail Blazers within two.

Banton had a chance to put Portland ahead, but his 3-pointer went in-and-out with 28.5 seconds remaining.

Jones and Booker each made two free throws to seal the win.

Phoenix trailed by four at the break before outscoring Portland 44-18 in the third quarter. Booker and Allen each had 10 points in the period as the Suns made 17 of 28 shot attempts overall, including 9 of 18 from 3-point range. The Trail Blazers were 7-for-27 and 1-for-11, respectively.

The score was tied at 54 with 9:15 left in the third before Phoenix began pulling away with a 26-4 burst.

Beal’s basket with 6:11 left gave the Suns a 69-56 lead. Royce O’Neale drained a 3-pointer to end Phoenix’s run and make it 80-58 with 2:32 left.

Phoenix led 87-65 entering the final stanza and increased the lead to 26 before Portland rallied.

Booker’s jumper pushed the lead back to 18 with 7:01 left before Portland’s furious comeback bid.

The Trail Blazers finished the first half with a 17-4 spurt to hold a 47-43 lead.

Durant had 14 points in the half to lead Phoenix, while Grant scored 11 to pace Portland.
