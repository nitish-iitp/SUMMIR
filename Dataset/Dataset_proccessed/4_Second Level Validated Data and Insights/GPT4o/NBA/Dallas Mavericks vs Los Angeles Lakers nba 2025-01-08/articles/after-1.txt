Undermanned Mavs overcome skid thanks to budding chemistry: ‘Give this group some time’

Jason Kidd removed his glasses during his postgame news conference to relay a message from P.J. Washington Jr.

“Give this group some time,” he said.

The Dallas Mavericks were in the midst of their longest losing streak of the season entering Tuesday’s game. The team is battered and bruised with injuries to Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Daniel Gafford and Dante Exum. But after a poor showing in the previous five games, the shorthanded group emerged victorious over the Los Angeles Lakers.

Traditionally, success for Dallas this season has meant a scoring explosion by either Doncic or Irving, supplemented by a breakout performance by a role player. On Tuesday, the Mavericks received contributions on both ends of the floor from several players who are usually confined to a specific role, but find themselves shouldering more responsibility to keep the team afloat.

The roster was constructed to supplement the playmaking skills of Doncic and Irving, which makes the Mavericks a championship contender when their stars are healthy. Tuesday’s victory over LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the rest of the Lakers served as a reminder that even without the duo, the Mavericks should have the roster depth to support playoff aspirations.

Just as the team struggled to build continuity early in the season, a new version of the Mavericks is navigating the chemistry-building process while their best players remain sidelined.

“This is a new group. A lot of injuries. We’re learning each other,” Kidd said Tuesday. “We’re asking guys to change their role to make a pivot and guys have been in a positive state. The energy is great. We believe every time we take the floor that we can win. ... It’s a long season.”

Kidd has received meaningful contributions from several players.

He’s allowed Quentin Grimes, who entered the season as a catch-and-shoot 3-point threat, the freedom to put the ball on the floor and serve as a playmaker to create scoring opportunities. The fourth-year wing is shooting more 2-pointers than ever in his career, with 44% of his attempts coming from inside the arc. He’s also averaging a career-high 4.2 rebounds per game and tied a career high with nine rebounds against the Lakers.

“We’re kind of just taking it game by game,” Grimes said. “Just having two superstars out, that definitely gives me more opportunity to be more aggressive. I don’t have to hunt threes, but I have more opportunity to be aggressive and look for my shot. Just making plays.”

Late in the fourth quarter, Grimes drove past Austin Reaves and threw a one-handed pass to Washington, who rose vertically for a reverse dunk. It was Grimes’ third consecutive games with six assists, indicating his intention to share the ball.

As for Washington, he has remained one of the most valuable Mavericks when in uniform. Dallas has a 1-6 record without the versatile forward, whose do-it-all skillset sets him apart from his teammates. Washington scored 22 points Monday thanks to his ability to drive into the paint and is emerging as a more confident pull-up shooter.

The Mavericks are big proponents of the “next man up” mentality whenever a player is expected to miss a significant amount of time due to injury. After Monday’s loss to Memphis, Washington was asked if the phrase is easier said than to actually play through.

“We just gotta get into rhythm,” he said. “We don’t have a feel right now. Obviously our two best players are out so it’s kind of tough. We just gotta figure out a way to win and be consistent doing it.”

Aside from key performances by Grimes and Washington on Tuesday, Klay Thompson and Jaden Hardy displayed their ability to catch a groove from the 3-point line in rapid fashion. Both players knocked down three consecutive 3-pointers to help Dallas establish momentum against the Lakers.

The threat of Thompson’s ability as a 3-point marksman was on full display at the end of the second quarter when the Lakers doubled him so he wouldn’t get an open look from beyond the arc. The extra defensive pressure allowed Spencer Dinwiddie to drive into the paint for an open dunk to cap an 11-0 run.

Dinwiddie was also a consistent scoring threat against his former team, continuing a trend that’s developed throughout the season when he’s been called upon to enter the starting lineup. He’s averaging 15.7 points and 5.4 assists in seven games as a starter.

“With our two quarterbacks out, there are others that have to participate and make decisions,” Kidd said.

Ending a five-game skid comes on the heels of another home game against the Portland Trail Blazers, who were 4-15 on the road entering their game Wednesday in New Orleans. The Mavericks could be without Irving for the next two to six games, according to his one-to-two week timeline with a back injury. Doncic will likely be out for the rest of January. Gafford is day to day with a right ankle sprain.

Dallas has a long way to go to prove it’s a competent team without Doncic and Irving. It’s presumable the group would struggle to qualify for the play-in tournament based on its 1-4 record without the pair.

But if the Mavericks can continue to rely on their roster depth, they can maintain their momentum from Tuesday’s win and avoid a slide down the Western Conference standings.
