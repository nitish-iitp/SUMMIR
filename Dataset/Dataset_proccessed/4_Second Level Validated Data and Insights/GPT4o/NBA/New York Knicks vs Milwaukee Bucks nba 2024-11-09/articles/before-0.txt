NEW YORK (AP) — Karl-Anthony Towns had 32 points, 11 rebounds and five assists and the New York Knicks snapped a two-game losing streak with a 116-94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.

New York (4-4) did not trail, and six different Knicks scored in double figures. Jalen Brunson chipped in 15 points and nine assists, and Josh Hart had 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in the Knicks' third win of at least 20 points this season.

Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 12 rebounds, and Damian Lillard had 19 points. Milwaukee (2-7) lost for the seventh time in eight games and is 1-5 on the road this season.

Milwaukee: A night after snapping its six-game losing streak with a 23-point home win against Utah, the Bucks had no answer for Towns and the new-look Knicks. Milwaukee hasn't had a losing record since the 2015-16 season, but a 2-7 start to the season isn't helping the Bucks keep the streak alive.

New York: The Knicks led by as many as 30 points after starting the fourth quarter on a 22-11 run, keyed by guard Miles McBride (14 points) and rookie Tyler Kolek (8 points).

Key moment

Towns fired up the home crowd by slamming home two one-handed dunks in the second quarter, one over Milwaukee center Brook Lopez.
