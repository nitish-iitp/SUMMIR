How did Josh Giddey perform against the Charlotte Hornets?

In the first quarter, Josh Giddey only had two points as the Chicago Bulls were cold from anywhere. They could barely knock down shots, with the Hornets building a 24-15 lead after the first 12 minutes.

The Bulls were much better in the second quarter, finally making shots and even getting the lead at the 5:08 mark. Giddey added seven points to his tally, including two late free throws toward the end of the half to give Chicago a 52-46 advantage.

Josh Giddey was called the entire second half, but the Chicago Bulls still managed to get the win. Giddey only had four points in the final 29 minutes of the game, two in the third quarter, zero in the fourth and two in overtime. He put the game to bed with two clutch free throws with 14 seconds remaining.

The Bulls ended the year on a two-game winning streak, improving to 15-18 for the season. They currently sit ninth in the Eastern Conference standings and are primed to finish in the Play-In Tournament spots.

Giddey and company begin 2025 on the road against the Washington Wizards before two consecutive home games, welcoming the New York Knicks and San Antoni Spurs.

Things will get interesting as the trade deadline nears since players such as Nikola Vucevic and Zach LaVine are linked to multiple teams. Giddey is playing for his next contract as he's set to be a restricted free agent this offseason. He's interested in returning to the Bulls, who acquired him from the OKC Thunder last summer.

Giddey spent the first three seasons of his career with the Thunder, posting career highs in his second year there. However, a scandalous rumor last season affected his play despite being a starter. His numbers across the board were down, with Oklahoma City sending him to Chicago last June in exchange for Alex Caruso.
