White’s offense came despite going 1-for-11 on threes. Patrick Williams and Craig made up for it by bagging five 3-pointers apiece.

The Bulls had a cold spell down the stretch of regulation after leading 91-84 with just over four minutes to play.

Mark Williams completed a three-point play with 1:32 left in regulation to bring Charlotte within 96-95. White’s short jumper stretched the Chicago lead to three with 1:09 remaining.

Charlotte’s next two possessions resulted in a turnover and a missed 3-pointer, but the Bulls couldn’t put the game out of reach.

After White’s jumper was off the mark, the Hornets got the ball back with 10.1 seconds to play before Bridges tied the contest.
