Jimmy Butler has struggled amid persistent trade rumors. The Miami Heat recently announced that they would not part ways with the six-time NBA All-Star in a bid to quash such talks. Butler just pushed back, saying he probably would not get his “joy” of playing while with the Heat.

Following a 128-115 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Thursday, Jimmy Buckets glumly faced reporters in the press conference. Butler’s statement was the closest he has come to ask for a trade in public.

In the press conference, Butler said that he was happy “off the court” in Miami, but wanted to get his “joy back.” He added that he wants to be “dominant” but told a reporter he probably would not get that with the Heat.

Shams Charania reported in early December that Jimmy Butler wanted out of Miami. Bernie Lee, Butler’s agent, blasted the ESPN journalist for making up stories. The Miami Heat joined the fray by announcing they don’t plan to trade their franchise cornerstone.

Jimmy Butler is open to playing anywhere other than Miami, per Shams Charania and Brian Windhorst

Following Jimmy Butler’s comments after the loss to the Indiana Pacers, Shams Charania and Brian Windhorst doubled down on the former’s exclusive news in December about Butler asking for a trade.

“Six-time All-Star Jimmy Butler has indicated to the Miami Heat he wants the team to trade him, league sources told ESPN.
“Butler does not plan to furnish the Heat with a list of favored destinations, sources told ESPN. He is open to playing anywhere other than Miami and feels he can make any team a contender -- no matter where he is moved, sources said. He does plan to take part in all team activities and will plan to do whatever the Heat ask of him during this process, sources said.”

The report added that they are still waiting for the Heat to respond. Butler is averaging 9.0 PPG, 4.0 RPG and 2.0 APG since returning from a five-game absence due to illness. He has a $52.4 million player option next season, allowing him to leave the Heat if he chooses to do so. Miami might be forced to trade him to recoup assets.
