Key stat

Haliburton had 16 points and five assists in the first quarter. It marked the third time in his career that he has done that in a quarter, joining the third quarter of a Pacers-Charlotte game on Nov. 4, 2023 (25 and 6) and the fourth quarter of a Pacers-San Antonio game on Oct. 21, 2022 (18 and 5). Oddly, the Pacers lost both of those games.
