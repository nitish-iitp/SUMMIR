Celtics Overcome Shooting Slump to Sink the Nets in OT

BOSTON – Jayson Tatum produced a terrific scoring effort Friday night, pouring in a game-high 33 points against the Brooklyn Nets. Yet, his shining moment was a selfless pass late in the fourth quarter to help lift Sam Hauser out of a rut and send the Celtics to a 108-104 overtime win at TD Garden.

Boston was trailing 91-89 with a little more than two minutes remaining in regulation when Tatum drove to the rack, looking to tie the game. But as he rose to the rim and felt Brooklyn’s defense collapsing around him, he opted to kick out to a wide-open Hauser, who rose up from the right corner and gave Boston the lead.

Before that play, Hauser had not been himself. He had shot 1-for-9 from deep and was visibly frustrated with his performance. However, JT never doubted him in one of the game’s biggest moments. After all, why should he doubt the most efficient 3-point shooter in Celtics history just because he missed a few prior?

“We always believe the next one is going in because he’s such a proven shooter and works really hard at his craft,” Tatum said of Hauser. “I’m never like, ‘Oh, s–––, Sam just missed his last two shots, I’m not about to pass it to him.’ I would never think that.”

Not all superstars think that way. Many in Tatum’s shoes wouldn’t have even glanced toward the corner on a drive to the rim in crunch time. But he’s an unusually selfish superstar.

And not every player would have the confidence to bury such a monumental shot after missing eight earlier. But it’s easier to trust yourself when your teammates have faith in you. 

“All of his teammates were empowering him to keep shooting,” Joe Mazzulla said of Hauser. “And 1-for-9 just means he's going to have a 6-for-10 game coming up here soon. So it's just part of the game. He generated great looks. He got great looks. He has to shoot them. Guys have to pass to him, and we move on about our day.”

Moving on was the theme of Friday night’s game. Hauser wasn’t the only one trying to snap out of a shooting slump; most of the team struggled to shoot the 3-ball throughout the game. The C’s shot a season-low 26.4 percent from deep, yet they made their shots when it mattered most.

Horford had a similar trajectory as Hauser, opening the game 2-of-8 from deep, but he made a massive tie-breaking triple in overtime that gave Boston the lead for good.

“I don't think it's very hard [to maintain confidence], just because we know the type of shooters that we have,” Horford said. “We work at this every day, and those are shots that we have to take. We had a lot of good looks, and you just have to take them and trust in your process. And I always just think back on our work, on our preparation when we have any kind of ruts like this.” 

Even Tatum had some cold spells in the middle of a 33-point, nine-rebound, six-assist, two-block, one-steal performance. That didn’t stop him from shooting and encouraging his teammates to let it fly. He realizes that is the most prolific 3-point shooting team in NBA history, and their makes will come as long as they stick to the game plan.

“That’s a principle of life,” Tatum said. “You’ve got to be the same person when things are going great and when things aren’t. It’s not time to panic when things aren’t going great … Sometimes you’re going to make shots. Sometimes you’re going to miss them. But we’ve still got to play the way that we believe to be the right way to play.”
