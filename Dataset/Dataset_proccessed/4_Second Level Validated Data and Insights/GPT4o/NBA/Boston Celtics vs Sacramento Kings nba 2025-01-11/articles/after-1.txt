The surging Sacramento Kings (19-19) overwhelmed the Boston Celtics (27-11) in the fourth quarter, cruising to a 114-97 victory on January 11.

Sacramento Kings Top Performers:

Domantas Sabonis 23 PTS | 28 REB | 3 AST | 60.1 FPS

Sabonis is a double-double monster, putting up his 33rd and 15th straight double-double with averages of 22.0 points and 19.6 rebounds in his last three games. But his turnovers and lack of defensive stats are hindering his fantasy value.

DeMar DeRozan 24 PTS | 4 REB | 9 AST | 48.3 FPS

DeRozan’s offense is starting to ignite, with three 24+ point games in his last four, but he’s yet to find ways to be more efficient.

Malik Monk 22 PTS | 3 REB | 8 AST | 42.6 FPS

Monk has been thriving in the point guard spot, reaching 20+ points in five straight games while putting up good numbers across the board.

Keegan Murray 19 PTS | 2 STL | 3 BLK | 37.6 FPS

Murray’s rebounding has been up-and-down lately, but he remains a consistent contributor on offense and stocks.

Trey Lyles 7 PTS | 11 REB | 3 AST | 29.7 FPS

Lyles’ scoring has gone cold, with three straight games under double digits, but he’s still a force on the boards and a threat for steals.

Boston Celtics Top Performers:

Jaylen Brown 28 PTS | 5 AST | 1 STL | 41.7 FPS

Brown’s offense has been erratic in recent games since coming back from a shoulder injury, but he appears to be getting his groove back after delivering a more efficient performance today on higher usage.

Kristaps Porzingis 22 PTS | 10 REB | 2 BLK | 40.0 FPS

Porzingis has been playing incredibly well, almost recording three straight 20-point, 10-rebound games. He’s likely to continue this streak, but his health is always a major question mark.

Jrue Holiday 5 PTS | 5 REB | 1 BLK | 19.0 FPS

Holiday is capable of putting up numbers in all areas of the game, but his offense has been lacking, with only one strong scoring game in his last six.Best video game consoles

Derrick White 3 PTS | 3 AST | 2 BLK | 17.7 FPS

White’s offense and overall contributions have been trending down, even before his illness, but he’s kept up his block production.

Payton Pritchard 9 PTS | 2 AST | 1 STL | 16.4 FPS

Pritchard has cooled off significantly, missing a lot of threes and averaging a mere 5.2 points in four of his last five games. This is likely just a slump, making now the perfect time to buy low.

Biggest Disappointment of the Game:

Jayson Tatum 15 PTS | 5-13 FG | 3-7 3PT

Tatum’s recent performance has been disastrous, with a 1-for-9 shooting night from three in his last game and 8 turnovers today.Best video game consoles
