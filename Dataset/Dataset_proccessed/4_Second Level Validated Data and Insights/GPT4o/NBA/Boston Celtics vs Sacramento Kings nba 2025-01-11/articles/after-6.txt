NBA: Sabonis pulls down franchise-record 28 rebounds for Kings
Loop Sports 19 hrs ago
Sacramento Kings' Domantas Sabonis (11) shoots against Boston Celtics' Luke Kornet (40) during the second half of an NBA basketball game Friday, Jan. 10, 2025, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer).

Domantas Sabonis had 23 points and a franchise-record 28 rebounds as the Sacramento Kings used a dominant fourth quarter in a 114-97 victory over the Boston Celtics in the NBA on Friday night.

The victory extended Sacramento's season-high win streak to six games. It was Sabonis’ 33rd double-double of the season and 24th game of his career with 20 or more rebounds. Entering Friday, the NBA’s previous high for rebounds in a game this season was 23 by San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama.

Sabonis surpassed his own franchise record of 26 rebounds, set against Memphis on January 29, 2024. Chris Webber also had 26 boards against Indiana on January 5, 2001.

DeMar DeRozan added 24 points and nine assists, and Malik Monk finished with 22 points and eight assists for Sacramento.

Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 28 points, Kristaps Porzingis added 22 and 10 rebounds, and Jayson Tatum had 15 points and 12 rebounds.

The game was tied at 76 after three quarters. Sacramento then took command, opening the fourth on a 24-9 run to take a 100-85 lead with 6:03 to play. The Kings outscored the Celtics 38-21 over the final 12 minutes.

Banchero stars in return but Bucks win

Giannis Antetokounmpo had 41 points and 14 rebounds and the Milwaukee Bucks beat Orlando 109-106 despite 34 points by the Magic's Paolo Banchero in his long-awaited return from an injury.

Damian Lillard added 29 points for the Bucks, including a pair of free throws with 9.3 seconds left for the game's final points.

Playing for the first time since tearing his right oblique on October 30, Banchero also had seven rebounds and three assists in 27 minutes. He made 5 of 8 3-point shots.

Cole Anthony had 18 points and seven rebounds for Orlando and Tristan da Silva had 16 points and 10 boards.

With the Bucks clinging to a one-point lead with 9.3 seconds left, Lillard was fouled by Anthony Black and fell down while taking an inbounds pass. The Magic challenged the call, but it was ruled that Black had made contact with both hands.

Thunder pound Knicks for 16th win in 17

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 39 points in 29 minutes, and the Oklahoma City Thunder emphatically bounced back to rout the New York Knicks 126-101 in the first game since their 15-game winning streak was snapped.

Isaiah Joe added 23 of his 31 points in the first half for the Thunder, who were coming off a 129-122 loss at NBA-leading Cleveland on Wednesday in the biggest game of the season thus far. There was no hangover at Madison Square Garden, where Oklahoma City had a 36-12 run in the first half en route to a 70-43 lead.

Jalen Brunson scored 27 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 in the Knicks' fourth loss in five games, a stretch that began when the Thunder used a big fourth quarter to win 117-107 last Friday and snap New York's nine-game winning streak.

The Knicks were booed multiple times in the first half of perhaps the low point of their season, which featured an 0-for-9 night by Mikal Bridges.

Oklahoma City closed the first quarter with a 12-0 spurt to lead 31-17. The Thunder then unleashed a 19-5 run over more than six minutes of the second to extend a 12-point lead to 55-29. Joe got 11 points in that stretch.

Friday's scores
Orlando Magic 106, Milwaukee Bucks 109
Indiana Pacers 108, Golden State Warriors 96
Philadelphia 76ers 115, New Orleans Pelicans 123
Boston Celtics 97, Sacramento Kings 114
New York Knicks 101, Oklahoma City Thunder 126
Chicago Bulls 138, Washington Wizards 105
Denver Nuggets 124, Brooklyn Nets 105
