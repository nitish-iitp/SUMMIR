Man, what a game. I expected the Kings to lose and wouldn’t have been surprised to lose badly, but I hoped they would at least play hard.

Well, not only did we beat the Celtics on their home floor, we won by 17 points and thoroughly outperformed them in the 4th quarter.

What a turnaround from how I was feeling two weeks ago. I felt like the season was over and there was no hope to salvage the season. I know it’s still a somewhat small size of games since Doug took over as coach, but man, the difference of how the guys are playing is night and day. Feels like the Kings of 2022-23.

Light that beam, and let’s keep this up, Kings! We’ve climbed back to .500 (not to mention we now sit at the 9th seed), so now let’s keep winning games and get over .500!!!!!

Played to their strengths on offense –
DeRozan big, Monk big, Keegan big – Domas huge.

Defense – Keon, Keegan toughing it out.

8 v 5
Sac the aggressor amd only 9 FTA to Boston’s 22! Yet Sac with a 17 point win,

Rook looked good as well.

If I look at it all, what’s different? – it’s the energy, to me. The team plays with grit and fire not warmth and smoke.

I’m a still a bit bewildered- but happily so

Fighting to win instead of hoping/expecting to win

Domas brings the intensity- because Domas always brings intensity
Monk brings the energy- he is going to spring and bounce every minute
Keegan is going to quietly work on his man coverage, and now,
make them pay on the other end by hitting some 3s (12-22 last 3 games)
DeMar is going to grind the mid game (I have to admit I like Mark Jones calling DeRozan the President of the Middy Committee)
Keon – Keon is going to bring the active hands and feet, cutting off passing and driving lanes and the lack of hesitation on calling his own number on offense (which was sorely lacking)
Lyles is going to bring some lane clogging, and make some 3s
Devin Carter – rookie confidence, not overly handy D, nice variety of 3s and drives on offense- and how about those rebounds!

Ok – SavageBeast brought this up yesterday: I am excited to bring De’Aaron back in this mix- should I be?

That’s what I call team ball. Also a lot of you were very wary about Devin Carter, I agree it is still a small size but what I saw last night shows a little why Monte drafter the kid. He can play basketball. He plays with the confidence a rookie doesn’t play with. IMO he is going to help this team. Because of the way he is playing Kevin Huerter just lost a lot of his minutes. I think a trade might be coming in the right situation.

Rik,

Wake up my man, you have more early morning work to do watching the replay of this game!

Perhaps the best complimentary game played by the Kings on Offense and Defense this season. Even better than Golden State. They played with confidence the entire game.

Kings out rebounded the Celtics 56-43 I believe and had 17 points on fast breaks.

Devan Clark had a very nice game including 8 straight points at the beginning of fhe 4th qtr.

Lyles had 11 rebounds about half were off the offensive boards.

I’m wondering if KH will become an end-of-bench guy when Fox returns. I don’t think Doug will do that but I think he needs to. Keon needs his minutes for this team to be its best and KH has become nearly unwatchable. As one of the TKH writers said the other day, MB might still be the coach if he hasn’t mismanaged Keon’s minutes so badly.

I think Huerter should be the 5th guard in the depth chart. Hard to trade him now because he doesn’t make shots much anymore, gets cooked 1 on 1. He gets some deflections, but not enough to offset his poor offense.

He played nearly 19 minutes last night and, in a 17 pt win, his BPM was -9.2 (per basketball-ref). The next lowest on the team was DeRozan at +1.3. If we’re trying to showcase him, it’s not working.

Not ignored AT ALL. Use them in comparison. At some point in the next 6 months a decision has to be made. Spend a quarter billion dollars or make a trade.
If you are just as good of a team without spending that kind of money AND you can improve your depth, it’s a conversation to be had.

The issue for me is that the max is not an overpay for Fox when you look across the league.

The Supermax only comes into play if Fox makes all-NBA. For that to occur he’s going to have to play out of his mind while the Kings finish like a freight train.

The historical odds do not favor the Kings getting back a player that is better than Fox in trade.

Want to deal Fox? Fine. But it better not be for a handful of magic beans. And while tbe micro may say one thing, the macro says that the Kings are better with Fox than without.

Comes down to value for me. With the max or super max Fox will be making 2x-3x more than Monk and he is not 2x the player.

IMO, in a small market a super max player needs to be an MVP level player to justify it and Fox ain’t that.

The other thing is I don’t think his game is going to age well so two years into the massive contract the Kings could be in a Bradley Beal or John Wall situation.

Pass on that, trade him for the best package available.

Two weeks ago the Kings season was lost. You’re not giving Fox the supermax based on if he’s an MVP-level player today. You’re giving it on the belief he can be that player. It’s fine if folks don’t think he can be, but I still believe he can. We’ve seen him reach that higher level, and if he reaches it with more consistency he’s at that MVP level. It’s a risk, I understand the concerns, but I believe in Fox.

Yes, it comes down to how you rate and forecast Fox. I know I rate him lower than most on here.

I agree at his very best he is that guy but it just doesn’t happen often enough.

And the traits that make him potentially that level of player are all traits that don’t age well; speed, aggressiveness, ability to finish in the paint as a smallish guard.

Yea I agree with you Greg. If Fox had Klay Thompson from 6 years ago in his corner we’d be talking about Fox being an assist machine, maybe.

At the same time, I’m a doomer when it comes to him staying, so talking about dealing him might be smart management.

There is much more to learn this season, it would seem.

He’s 8 years in, Greg. I don’t imagine he’ll make a leap at this point to being an MVP level player. I know it chaps some people, but in considering his track record, Fox is closer to the Zach LaVines and CJ McCollums of the league than he is to guys who carry their teams like Shai, Luka, or Tatum.

The reality is, he’s made just one All-NBA team and he’s far from MVP consideration. He may not even be the MVP on his own team.

So we are depending on a 35 year old DDR to carry this team in late game situations for the next few years. We all saw the end of the Miami game….that offense was not great and DDR bailed them out a few times with TOUGH shots. It was awesome. But…

If you are expecting that consistently from aging guy you are in trouble. Fox was a monster part of great crunch time play against Philly and Dallas to start this streak and numerous others over past few years. You need a guy that can iso and get his own shot downs stretches against good teams…that’s just how it works. Besides DDR nobody else consistently fills that role.

I get it sometimes Fox takes over and wins you a game.

How about that DET game and press conference? Is that a max player?

Another concern is if Fox gets a huge contract at some point it will cost them keeping someone like Keon or Keegan or maybe both.

And it’s not losing Fox and getting nothing back. You lose him but if (big if) Monte is smart you are getting a great player or multiple good players and picks in return and strengthening weak spots. And IMO the net result is the Kings are better.

It would be nice if the Kings had balls and traded a star at peak value from a position of strength not when they had to.

Examples of trading stars that worked out:

Richmond for CWebb, started the glory years Cousins trade, avoided big contract and ended up being smart could have got more IMOHaliburton for Domas, started the Beam team

Also Corliss for Christie. Kings got a piece we needed and Peja became a starter. If Fox is traded, that leaves Keon and Carter to take his minutes and we get a strong player in a position of need, plus likely more depth.

I see this as an opportunity for the Kings to take the next step. It’s a chance to contend possibly.

Has to be the right trade though. That is where I have apprehension, if Monte can pull it off.

If you were to trade Fox to the Hear you would probably get bach Tyler Hero as one of the players. Averaging around 23 points a game and is coming around defensively he could be your starting point guard with Monk at SG. Along with Hero IMO we should ask for Highsmith and Jovic plus 2 firsts. That would do it, Highsmith is a very good defender and Jovic at 6’10” is an up and coming PF.

Except it really doesn’t work that way in the NBA. You can’t really chop Fox’s salary into 2 or 3 lesser players and hope to make up for him in the aggregate. This is not fantasy league basketball, at least not when you get to the top players in the league.

Yes, there is risk. But if you’re the Kings, and you look back over the past 40 years at the players that have been here and been better than Fox (you won’t need two hands), you trade him only if you’re getting an absolute stud in return, or as an absolute last resort.

Trust me I’m not into fantasy league ball, could not care less about that.

And my point was not that you add 2-3 lesser players for Fox. It’s that he is not worth that contract and maybe if he is traded he brings back an All Star level PF or wing. Or above average of both. Add that to what the Kings have been doing sans Fox and now they are a legit playoff team possibly a contender IMO. And the roster is much more flexible and less redundant.

…at least not when you get to the top players in the league…

When I think top players in the league, who I would pay a max, I’m saying the top 10 or so players in the league. I don’t put Fox there, maybe you do. To me he is more around 20-25 and not irreplaceable.

Absolutely this.

Fox is what, a top five in the NBA in being able to create his own shot? So many times in the playoffs it comes down to who can create good shots late in the series when the teams know each other so well and have schemed for everything. There are few in the league who can get to their spot like Fox. Look at what he did against the Warriors in the Beam Team season.

I love Monk, but I am not sure he can handle the on ball pressure that Fox can, and someone like Herro can’t really either, and neither can crank up their harassment of opposing ball handlers like Fox can either.

If Carter is the real deal and can be a rotation player, then getting Fox back healthy, and hopefully using Kevin’s salary to get some size, I think they will be very competitive the rest of the season.

But is it an overpay if you are getting equal results (wins) without him? Probably.
Just a couple weeks ago we were talking how imbalanced our team is. We don’t have anything that anyone wants in a trade to get back someone of quality.
We can’t trade Huerter for some star that fills our needs.
Lyles? What does that leave us with absolutely no bigs left on the team outside Sabonis.
Would you rather have a great wing added and a couple first rounders? Or a backup big and wing and a first rounder by trading Fox?
Fox is ONLY worth the money if the TEAM does better with him than without.

Historically, this team has been worse without him than with him. I’m not going to consider a decision of this magnitude on a six game sample size.

The roster is imbalanced. Fox for Lauri? I’m at least listening. Fox for Jabari and stuff? I’m less enthused. Fox for a gaggle of prospects from SA? Nope.

The team has won three straight with Fox out, after winning three straight with him. That this is at all a talking point in why he should be traded amazes me.

This is me and not you, but my eyes glaze over and I stop reading when I see the playoff argument. Good thing OKC never bought into that with SGA. And there are a ton of players in the East that have playoff credentials that would have never sniffed the playoffs in the West.

But I think we’re close to being on the same page. We probably just have different valuations of Fox.

I feel there are players than once they are on the court they instantly raise the ceiling of that team, even if surrounded by mediocre talent. Luka did it in Dallas, Kawhi did it in Toronto, Butler in Miami, LBJ has done it everywhere, Jokic led a bunch of role players to a title, etc.

Fox has not shown that he is of the upper tier of those type of players. I feel he falls into the tier of exceptional players that can put up eye popping numbers, but not really lead his team deep into the playoffs. Like I mentioned above, LaVine comes to mind, so does Beal, and even DeRozan hits that bill. They are great players and all, but if your team is giving them the max contract, I’m not sure you should expect a whole lot of post season success.

Agreed that Fox is not among the pantheon of players that you noted. That does not mean that he is not a max contract player, or that he does not immensely improve the roster that he resides on.

Other examples might be Ant or Jimmy Butler or Devin Booker. Hell, up until last year, folks would have put Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown in this category. Jokic was nothing more than a stat filler until there was an appropriate team built around him.

It’s really not about Fox. It’s about the front office. Put a balanced roster together and the point is likely moot. And again, if you could achieve this by sending Fox & Lyles for Lauri and Collins, I’m listening. But two things that I have zero concern over are Fox playing as a Sacramento King, and Fox getting the max.

I still believe that the answer lies in building around the margins. Swap out DDR for Collins (easier said than done) and this roster sets up a little better. And I’d have zero reservations watching Ellis & Carter back Keegan at the three.

I agree. If this roster was balanced and the Kings were sitting in the 5th or 6th seed, the conversation about giving Fox the max wouldn’t be a debate, but therein lies the issue. If Monte stands pat, rides the roster past the deadline, but the Kings fail at making postseason noise, do you still give Fox the max? Monte has then proven he can’t seem to build around Fox and Sabonis, so why build the foreseeable future around those two?

One thing that I don’t believe has been mentioned is that with this potential max deal, Fox is also eligible for a no-trade clause, just like Beal has. You have to be in the league for 8 years and at least 4 with the team in order to qualify for it.

Should Fox insist on the no-trade clause to go along with his max contract, do you give it to him?

As would I. I should note, it doesn’t mean he’s gonna ask for a no-trade clause, but being that he qualifies for it, I’d imagine his camp would push for it. I would figure that anyone who qualifies for it as part of a max contract would want it since it truly allows the player to dictate their own future.

If Fox tries to play out of his mind for the SuperMax it will be to the detriment of the team. Fox jacking up more shots is not what this team needs. They clearly play better without him and now is time to move him.
I don’t know what has happened to him the last couple of years, but he is a very unenjoyable player to watch. Very close to Cousins territory. Constantly whining about calls, giving half assed effort. Bonehead decisions like the 4 point play and no accountability.
I send him on his way for the best package we can get. Even if that is a bunch of expiring’s and picks. I’d be happy with just him gone and his salary off the books at this point.

Fox has bought in. No need to move him now. It’s in his body language. Fox isn’t a cheerleader when not playing, but last night he was one of the loudest on the bench. That showed me a lot. Trust me, no bias here. I want the best team out there.

Still, we do need to make a move to keep winning. That move isn’t Fox, right now. I’m thinking more of decreasing his minutes now to keep him fresh to close games out and for the playoffs. Fuck the play-in, the playoffs.

Plus Monk seems perfectly capable of running the offense, and this Carter kid is a steal by Monte, albiet a rookie, but still.

Strike now while the irons are hot, they say. The Kings can be set up for years to come if we get a good return for Fox, and Monte can work his magic.

Apples and oranges for me. Hali was an insane value to contract, Fox fair value. So Fox was the preferred asset to move. But once the trade was made, I had no qualms over paying Fox, then or now.

I can’t stress it enough – $50+m does not scare me. This number does not mean what it meant even two years ago, and it won’t mean nearly as much in two years. The last thing I want to see this organization is scrimp at the top of the roster. Been there. Done (with) that.

Yeah, I get that. The max contract for a player of Fox’s tenure is 30% of the cap. Those contacts go up every year just as the cap does. I also get that in a few years it won’t be so eye-popping as long as the player continues to perform at that level.

My only concern is future cap flexibility on a team that obviously needs to make major adjustments to get to another level. Couple that with the money that Sabonis is making and there isn’t a lot of “room” to make those adjustments. Monte would sort of be approaching the PHX Suns type of cap restraints. A max deal for Fox, a near max for Sabonis, $24M for DDR, $18M for Monk, and a likely rookie extension for Keegan, really puts the clamps on improving around the edges. Monte would almost assuredly need to move some core pieces to try and improve things.

I’m all on board with a DDR for a stretch rim protecting 4, but I’m not holding my breath on it.

Here are the the projected caps and luxury tax levels beginning two seasons from now (remember, Fox is still under contract next season at $37m):
171/207
188/228
207/251
228/276

These numbers are based on the 10% annual increase that is baked into the current CBA. I don’t have an issue with the percentage of contract that a max has against these numbers if we are talking about a top 30ish player. I’d probably pay that money to Lauri if he were here. I’d probably pay Maxey or KAT or Booker. They may not be LeBron or Curry or the oncoming Wemby, but they are the BPAs, and your choice is to spend or not spend the money.

It is a star player’s league, so chopping this investment into multiple players rarely, rarely works. And I would not want to waste Sabonis’ prime years on a rebuild or re-tool.

One thing that I am not worried about is a guard with true handles. If the right deal came along and you could balance this roster with a star level player by trading Fox (Lauri level), I think that Sabonis’ handle allows you to trot out Monk, Ellis and Carter as capable handling guards.

I mostly agree with you except for your comfort with Ellis as a “capable handling” guard. I’ve mentioned elsewhere that he seems to have difficulty even with routine entry passes into Domas. He’s currently at only 2 assists per 36, and his AST/TO ratio is about 1.4 to 1.

A serviceable backup big and/or defensive wing is still a must in my opinion. They don’t have to break the bank, but standing pat at another trade deadline would be foolish. Like Gafford and PJ did for the Mavs last deadline, the Kings need to find their version of that. Mavs wanted Pascal, but had to pivot. Have a plan and a backup plan to upgrade the roster. Go Kings!!

Not even a mention of Sabonis with 28 rebounds.

I don’t like how the league, reporters, pundits, etc. are quick to engage in the negative stuff around the league, talk bad a player or team, and rarely discuss the positive aspects in any given season.

Just a general gripe. “Kings fired Brown in a classless move” was the headline.

“Kings winners of 6 in a row, and are 6-1 since Christie took over” said no national media member.

Whatever, just light that fucking beam and screw the national media.

To be fair, Michael Malone and Steve Kerr aren’t offering sound bytes about the Kings winning six straight. But you’re not wrong.

I really don’t care about the media. They don’t play for the Kings. They don’t coach the Kings. They just sit in their chairs get fat and never say anything about the Kings. Just leave them alone to their criticisms( mostly negative) and use YOUR energy to support the Kings. GO KINGS!

Hear Hear!

I don’t expect more and better applause for when the team is performing well, nor yearn for it, as overcoming adversity and winning 6 in a row is it’s own reward, but I sure welcome it.

Christie Count: (with 44 to go)
needs to go 20-24 to finish his season over.500 (26-25)
For Kings >.500 (42-40) team needs to go 23-21
For Kings to
46 wins (last season): 27-17
48 wins (Beam season): 29-15
50 wins (ok to dream): 31-13

That 50 wins makes into the fantasy is amazing, given the 13-18 record at the time of Coach Brown’s firing.

Someone (apologies, I can’t recall whom) used:
Christie The ReBeamer
&ct=g
The famous Christ the Redeemer statue overlooks Rio de Janeiro (river in January)
coincidence? fate? Kismet?

of course, one loss, and we’ll all be floating (or crashing) back to Earth

I watched the highlights of the Celtics losing to the Kings last night on NBA TV.

The “announcer” introduced the clips of the losing team by saying “Fox was replaced in the starting lineup by Malik Monk…”

Just. Plain. Awful.

Neither of the other two pundits corrected the error.

Great game! Gotta love this seasons swings. Choke against Pistons at home complete an 0-5 home stand. Fire the coach and 2 weeks later riding a 6 game winning streak and beat the Celts in Baastan. Incredible! Oh and Domas with 28 freaking boards. That’s more than some team totals. Dude is a joy to watch.

Everytime we step on the court, we believe in us and it’s always “Fuck Them”.

Gotta love DC man. I’ve waiting on this mentally to come back since the 2002 WCFs .

Would be amazing to find out that they have a life size cardboard portrait of Rick Fox in the locker room and every time they win, they remove a section of his uniform and he’s hideous underneath. Just like Rachel Phelps and the Indians in Major League.

Watched the game and couldn’t believe what I was seeing… for the 6th game in a row?
so I went to bed.
Then I woke up at 4, panicked that it was all a dream, so I came back to see if this thread was still here, and you guys…
IT WAS!!!!
WE’RE FREAKIN’ STEAKIN’!!!

Will there be an article up about Monte getting lobbed softballs from Marc Jones and hitting singles, while there were no pitches in the Brown and/or Fox strike zones?

Or is there no use, due to the lack of content?

We’re really not vested in Monte interviews.
