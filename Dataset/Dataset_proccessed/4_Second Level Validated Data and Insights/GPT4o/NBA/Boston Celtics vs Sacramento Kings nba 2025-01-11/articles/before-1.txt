C's Vow to Get Through Rough Patch: 'It's Part of the Journey'

BOSTON – The Celtics returned home from a satisfying 3-1 Western Conference road trip Friday night, only to be stunned by the Sacramento Kings, 114-97. 

It was a classic example of a trap-game loss. But Boston’s players refused to excuse it as such.

For one, their opponent entered as one of the hottest teams in the league. Sacramento has experienced a resurgence under interim head coach Doug Christie, winning six straight to return to .500. Its offense was dialed in at TD Garden with three 20-point scorers, and they dominated the glass behind Domantas Sabonis’ career-high 28 rebounds.

But more importantly, Jayson Tatum says, the Celtics must dig deeper after losing seven of their last 15 games. They have to fight their way out of this rough patch, and they believe that they will.

“I don't want to blame why we lost today on it being a trap game,” Tatum said following a 15-point, 12-rebound, five-assist effort. “Everybody plays 82 games, everybody travels, everybody plays back-to-backs. So don't really want to use that as an excuse. We’ve just got to be better in all areas of the game.”

Specifically, Joe Mazzulla noted, they must be more consistent on offense. His Celtics put up a solid 55-point first half against Sacramento but followed it up with just a 42-point second half. They were outscored 38-21 in the fourth quarter, during which they shot just 14.3 percent from three while the Kings shot 72.7 percent.

“When you’re having an inefficient offense, it puts pressure on your defense,” Mazzulla said. Whether it's shot-making, whether it's execution, whether it's spacing, I think that takes a toll on you. And then, if you're going to shoot 28 percent from three (for the game), you're going to have to do a bunch of other things, really, really, really well, and it puts pressure on your defense throughout the game. So we have to be better there.”

Jaylen Brown believes they will be better. And the first step toward improvement starts in the film room.

“Film doesn't lie,” Brown said after a 28-point night. “Accept it. Just be better. Accept criticism well. Are you willing to be coached and come out and put your best foot forward? Do what your team needs you to do to win and be excellent at that. Anything that's ever been asked of me, I always try to lead by example, and we gotta do that as a unit. So, I'm looking forward to it. We've gotta continue to figure it out as a group. It's part of the journey. It might not be as pretty as some would like. But I believe in this team. I believe in these guys, and I think we'll be alright."

This team should be believed in because they’ve shown what they’re capable of when they’re operating at full strength for an extended period. For the most part this season, they have not had that luxury. 

Friday’s game was just the third time all season that their main core played at full strength. It takes time to rebuild that rhythm, Kristaps Porzingis explained.

“We're gonna get past it,” he said after a 22-point, 10-rebound night. “I’m telling you, I’m confident we’ll bounce back. We’re just having not the prettiest moment right now as a team, and it’s completely normal. But believe me, we’ll figure it out.”

Their next opportunity to do so will be Sunday night when they host the New Orleans Pelicans before heading back on the road.
