Pippen had 11 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. Rookie Zach Edey had 14 points, eight rebounds and two blocks for the Grizzlies, and Santi Aldama added 12 points.

Takeaways

Wizards: The Wizards are dealing with injuries to key players, which left them with a couple of rookies in the starting lineup with second-year player Bilal Coulibaly. The inexperience led to 13 turnovers in the first half, leading to 19 points as Memphis built a double-digit lead.

Grizzlies: Memphis is continually picking up the pace this season putting it in the top 5 in the league. That led to Wizards coach Brian Keefe continually yelling for his defenders to get back during most of the game.

Key moment

With 3:50 left in the third and Memphis leading by 24, the 7-foot-4 Edey got tangled with Wizards veteran 7-footer Jonas Valanciunas. There was some shoving and an elbow or two flicked between the pair along with a forearm from Edey before play was stopped and double-technicals assessed against the two centers.
