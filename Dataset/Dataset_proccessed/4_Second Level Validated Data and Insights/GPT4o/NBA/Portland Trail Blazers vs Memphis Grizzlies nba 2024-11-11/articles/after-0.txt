The Portland Trail Blazers are due for some serious soul-searching following a demoralizing 134-89 home loss to the injury-ravaged Memphis Grizzlies Sunday night. At the very least, the players are in for a poor night’s sleep, according to Portland head coach Chauncey Billups.

“I told them that anybody that sleeps well tonight, you’re a loser,” Billups told reporters when asked about his postgame message to the team. “It’s just that simple. ... You sleep well after this one, you’re a loser.”

If you think that’s harsh, Billups’ six-minute postgame press conference was peppered with several other fiery soundbites, as he laid into his players about a lack of effort. When asked to describe his teams’ performance, this is how the fourth-year head coach opened up the presser:

“It was just f--- embarrassing, to be honest with you. We was soft as hell the whole game. Nobody really fought. It was just embarrassing for everybody. That’s just not who we are. It really isn’t. There’s no excuse for that.”

Billups continued: “You have a lot of rough nights in this league, obviously, but I don’t even care. It just wasn’t even that. It was like our guys just showed up because they had to be here, but didn’t want to play, didn’t want to actually work. And that’s embarrassing.”

Sunday’s postgame presser and loss were the kind that raise alarms about where this Blazers season is headed. Even in a year where the Blazers are projected to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, losses like the one Billups described aren’t supposed to happen. For the most part, the Blazers have avoided them in the early season and shown fight, even while accumulating a 3-8 record. That wasn’t the case Sunday. It was hardly watchable, as boos broke out at the Moda Center multiple times.

From start to finish, the Grizzlies punked the Blazers on their home floor. Memphis was missing Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, Marcus Smart and GG Jackson, while Portland was only missing reserve wing Matisse Thybulle. It didn’t matter. Seven Memphis players reached double-figures as they got run-out after run-out.

The Blazers trailed by 14 after the first quarter, 20 at the half, 38 after the third quarter, and 45 when the final buzzer sounded.

The Blazers shot 34% from the field and a shocking 9.5% (4-42) on 3s. They turned the ball over 23 times. What was more baffling was how they coughed it up — kicking the ball off their feet, forcing countless passes into non-existent windows, throwing a bounce pass to oneself for a travel, stumbling and falling down, etc.

With all those clanks and miscues, the offense had no rhythm. The talented young backcourt — Anfernee Simons, Shaedon Sharpe and Scoot Henderson — that is supposed show the promise of this rebuilding franchise combined for just 16 points on 7-26 shooting. Simons scored four points, matching his number of turnovers, while Henderson had three turnovers himself.

Jerami Grant led Portland with 20 points on 7-15 shooting, but reserves Dalano Banton and Donovan Clingan were the only other Blazers to reach double-figures. Billups appreciated some of the effort from the deep-bench guys who got minutes late, but he couldn’t say the same for the rest of the roster.

“I’m not just gonna pinpoint one or two guys, they all were terrible,” Billups said. “ ... [F]or the most part, everybody — they all sucked.”

This was the second time in 11 games this season that Billups called out his players for a lack of effort. The first time came after Portland’s season-opening 140-104 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 23. Even after that loss, Billups smiled a few times in the postgame press conference; he offered the respite that “it’s just a game” and “it’s not the end of the world.”

On Sunday, he offered no silver linings or reassuring smiles, as the mood in the room was decidedly tenser. Normally, Billups doesn’t like to address the team after losses, but he said Sunday’s game was an exception to that rule.

“This was different, and more not because we lost,” Billups said. “We’ve lost by more points than this, but it’s just how. It’s how. It’s just you laying down and just kind of caving in.”

While Billups called out his players, he said he’s also looking in the mirror and taking accountability. As head coach, he said he has to have his team more prepared.

“At the end of the day, that’s on me. I’m the leader of this,” Billups said. “This is our team but I’m the head of this. So to me, I take that very personal because I don’t have none of that, not one bone of that in my body, to just lay down, so that’s on me. I got to be better.”

After the game, Simons said he couldn’t explain what went so wrong Sunday, but he said everybody needs to be better. A reporter asked Simons if he sensed anything before the game that indicated something was off with the team. The seventh-year guard mentioned the team’s 127-102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday and mounting frustration with the team’s losing record after going 21-61 last season.

“Having a bad year last year, and then coming in this year, things can start to really settle in,” Simons said. “The frustration can definitely build from there.”

“I think we gave effort, but there was no structure to it,” added Grant. “I think it was a lot of mental lapses.”

As the veteran and only player aged 30 or above on the roster, Grant said the players need to hold a meeting to address what’s going wrong and “figure it out.” They’ll have to find answers quickly; the Blazers see the title-contending Timberwolves again for a back-to-back on Tuesday and Wednesday.

At the end of Billups’ postgame presser with reporters, he was asked if he plans to watch film of the loss. Once again, he didn’t mince words:

“No, I don’t want to see that s---. No, no, I’ve seen enough already.”
