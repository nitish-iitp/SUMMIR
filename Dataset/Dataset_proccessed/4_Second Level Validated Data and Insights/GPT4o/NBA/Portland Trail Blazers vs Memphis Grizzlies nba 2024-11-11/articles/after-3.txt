Without Ja Morant and multiple impact players, Memphis Grizzlies flexing early-season depth

It would have been easy to draw flashbacks to last season’s horrors when the Memphis Grizzlies' starting lineup was unveiled Sunday in Portland.

Just like many of those starting lineups, Jaren Jackson Jr. was included. And also like many of those groupings, there was no Ja Morant, Desmond Bane or Marcus Smart.

But unlike last season, this year’s Grizzlies have Jaylen Wells, Jay Huff and Zach Edey. There’s a healthier Brandon Clarke, plus more experienced versions of Jake LaRavia and Scotty Pippen Jr.

That depth was showcased in a 134-89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center.

Memphis had seven players finish in double figures with scoring, led by Jackson’s 20 points. The Grizzlies also had 15 steals and 13 blocks for a total of 28 stocks. That is the most stocks Memphis has had in a game since Nov. 8, 2002.

The Grizzlies have now won five of their past six games, and it doesn’t feel like one player is carrying this team. Sure, Morant, before his recent injury, and Jackson have been statistically satisfying as stars, but it’s the multitude of options coming up with big plays that is keeping this engine going.

Sunday’s win was the latest example of Memphis flexing its depth as one of the NBA’s deepest rosters.

Mr. Do-it-all, Jake LaRavia

LaRavia has figured out his role in Memphis. That sounds simple, but that wasn’t easy for him during his first two seasons of inconsistent playing time and injuries. He might not be the shooter some hoped he’d be as a first-round pick in 2022, but LaRavia is making up for it by becoming a do-it-all type of player. He’s rebounding, passing, defending, cutting and shooting. He had 18 points, four rebounds, three steals and three blocks against the Blazers.

Luke Kennard evidence of Grizzlies' offensive versatility

Luke Kennard is known as a shooter, but it was his passing that stood out Sunday, when he finished with a career-high 11 assists in 20 minutes. Finding ways to be effective when the shot isn’t falling will be Kennard’s route to consistently impactful minutes. The new offense’s emphasis on cutting and pace allows for players like Kennard to show off their playmaking abilities more.

Big guys bringing the defense

Two 7-footers were responsible for the Grizzlies’ lead in steals and blocks. Jay Huff paced Memphis with six blocks, Edey led the way with four steals. Defensive activity is one of the biggest areas of emphasis for the Grizzlies because it allows them to get out in transition for easy scoring chances.
