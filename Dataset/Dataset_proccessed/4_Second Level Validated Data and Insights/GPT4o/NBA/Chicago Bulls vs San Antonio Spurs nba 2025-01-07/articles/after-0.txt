After White’s layup gave the Bulls their first lead at 111-110, Devin Vassell threw away the ball for San Antonio. White then drove into the lane and dunked over a late-arriving Wembanyama, delighting the crowd of 18,886 at the United Center.

Wembanyama had 23 points, 14 rebounds and eight blocks for San Antonio, which carried a 95-82 lead into the final period. Chris Paul added 18 points and nine assists in the opener of a four-game trip.

Chicago used an 11-0 run to trim San Antonio’s lead to 79-71 with 5:24 left in the third quarter. But then Paul made two foul shots, a pullup jumper and a 3-pointer to extend the Spurs’ advantage to 86-73 with 4:18 remaining in the period.
