Zach LaVine scored 14 of his game-high 35 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 10 rebounds for the game while Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 11 boards to lift the host Chicago Bulls to a 114-110 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night.

Chicago overcame a 19-point deficit that it faced in the third quarter, taking its first lead of the night on Coby White’s driving layup with 47.1 seconds left in the fourth that made it 111-110. The Bulls ended the game on an 11-0 run.

Chris Paul missed a desperation 3-pointer in the final second for San Antonio. The shot followed a jump ball that was the result of a won challenge by the Bulls, who were able to get a foul call on a 3-point attempt by the Spurs reversed.

San Antonio went scoreless over the game’s final 3:52. Victor Wembanyama had 23 points and 14 rebounds to go along with eight blocks while pacing eight Spurs scorers in double figures.

Paul had 18 points and nine assists for San Antonio. Julian Champagnie scored 12 points, Jeremy Sochan, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson each had 11 and Harrison Barnes and Stephon Castle chipped in 10 apiece.

San Antonio shot 46.3 percent from the field compared to 43.1 percent for Chicago. The Spurs dished out 31 assists and finished with a 49-47 edge on the glass.

LaVine, who reached the 30-point plateau for the fourth time in five games, added eight assists on Monday. White scored 23 points, and Patrick Williams added 12.

The Bulls didn’t register their first points until a White layup at the 8:18 mark of the first quarter. They ended up trailing 29-20 after 12 minutes of action.

Buoyed by a balanced attack, the Spurs took a 65-50 lead into halftime. Wembanyama (12 points) and Vassell (11) had scoring totals in double figures at the break, while Sochan (nine) and Barnes (eight) weren’t far behind.

San Antonio shot 57.1 percent overall in the first half compared to 38.9 percent for Chicago, which was led by LaVine (13 first-half points) and Vucevic (11).

Wembanyama threw down a dunk with 7:33 to go in the third quarter to provide the Spurs with a 19-point lead, 79-60.
