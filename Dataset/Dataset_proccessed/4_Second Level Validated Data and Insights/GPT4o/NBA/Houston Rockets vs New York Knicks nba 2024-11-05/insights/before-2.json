        "Reed Sheppard's competition for minutes are Jalen Green and Fred VanVleet, arguably the Houston Rockets' best scorers.",
        "Ime Udoka is unlikely to reduce Jalen Green's minutes for Reed Sheppard.",
        "Fred VanVleet's leadership and experience are too valuable for Udoka to replace him with Sheppard.",
        "Dillon Brooks is the Rockets' best perimeter defender, making it unlikely for Udoka to take him out for Sheppard.",
        "Alperen Sengun is untouchable while Jabari Smith Jr. complements Sengun well.",
        "For Sheppard to get more minutes, he must work hard on both ends for Udoka to trust him.",
        "Sheppard did not play more than eight minutes in his past four games but had 14 on Monday, a good sign for the combo guard."
