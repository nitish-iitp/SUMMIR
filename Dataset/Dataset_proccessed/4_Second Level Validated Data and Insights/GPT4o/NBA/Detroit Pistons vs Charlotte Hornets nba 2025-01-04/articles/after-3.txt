Seth Curry had a three-point play during the outburst, and Bridges finished it off by picking off a pass and making a 31-foot 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer.

Up 86-85 with under nine minutes left, the Pistons had a 6-0 spurt that included two Harris baskets. After the Hornets pulled within two points, Cunningham hit a midrange jumper for a 94-90 lead with 3:10 left.
