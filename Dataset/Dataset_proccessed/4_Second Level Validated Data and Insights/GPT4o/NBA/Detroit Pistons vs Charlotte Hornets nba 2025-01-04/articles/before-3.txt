LaMelo Ball's future with 'leaderless' Hornets (Image Source: IMAGN)

NBA analyst Kevin O'Connor reflected on LaMelo Ball's stint with the Charlotte Hornets. While Ball is the Hornets' best player, O'Connor feels the team still lacks a leader.

O'Connor explained that LaMelo Ball still isn't leadership material. At this stage of Ball's career, he is seen as the fun guy who everyone wants to hang out with. O'Connor noted that Melo wouldn't grow into that figure until his late 20s. However, even by then the NBA analyst believes that LaMelo still wouldn't grow into a true leader.

"If you're the [Charlotte] Hornets, one of your best players, if you want to be a championship contender, needs to be a leader," O'Connor said at 37:00. "Unless LaMelo [Ball] grows into it, he's still only 23, maybe by the time he becomes 26 or 27, becomes that [leader].

"I'm not betting on LaMelo to become that," O'Connor continued. "I mean, all due respect to LaMelo Ball, but you're more of the fun guy, having a good time, everybody likes partying with you and having a good time with you. You're not the leader."

NBA insider Tom Haberstroh then predicted LaMelo Ball's future with the Hornets. Haberstroh mentioned how Ball has been dominant as a player, averaging a little over 30 points per game while being a good playmaker. His value as a player is high, which means that Charlotte can get a good deal out of him if they trade him now.

"LaMelo [Ball] is averaging 30 points per game," Haberstroh said at 38:06. "But he's been injury-riddled throughout his career. Maybe [Charlotte Hornets] say "Look, while his stock is high and he's got great individual numbers... that this is when you trade him." You sell high."

LaMelo Ball is one of the best players in the league playing for one of the worst teams this season. As of this writing, the Charlotte Hornets are in 14th place in the Eastern Conference with an 7-25 record. They were also on an eight-game losing streak before facing the Detroit Pistons on Friday.

Despite all these setbacks, Ball has still notched top-tier performances as he tries to lead his team to success. He's averaging 30.1 points, 7.4 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals in 22 games this season. However, given how Melo is consistently injured, the Hornets don't always get to enjoy having their ace player by their side.

Last season, Charlotte had a 21-61 record and placed 13th in the conference. Given how they've performed so far this year, it's likely they could replicate a similar outcome.
