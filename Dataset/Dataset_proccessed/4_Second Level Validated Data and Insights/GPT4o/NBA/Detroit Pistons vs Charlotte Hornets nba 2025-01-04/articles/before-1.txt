Detroit

The Pistons have had a great season under their new coach, J.B. Bickerstaff. The team's defence has improved a lot, letting in an average of 114.6 points per game compared to 119 last season. Their offense has also got better, with the team scoring 112 points per game, up from 109.9 last season. Cade Cunningham, the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft, has also improved. So far this season, the guard is averaging 23.8 points and 9.7 assists, which are both personal bests. In their last home game against Orlando (105:96), Detroit coped well, despite losing Jaden Ivey to injury. The Pistons' defenceman is expected to miss about four weeks, but the team has done well overall, with four wins in the last five games and an overall balance of 15-18. Detroit is currently in ninth place in the Eastern Conference standings.

Charlotte

The Hornets, on the other hand, haven't made much progress under their new head coach, Charles Lee. Charlotte's defense is ranked 16th in the league, with an average passer rating of 112.8 points per game, but on offence they're 29-and-over with 106.2 points scored per game. Before the matchup with Detroit, the Hornets had failed eight straight games. Charlotte has played the last two games at home, first losing to Oklahoma (94:106) and then failing to handle Chicago (108:115 (98:98) in overtime).

Expert Betting Tips

Detroit is currently a more ambitious and more competitive team than Charlotte. Both face-to-face meetings in the current championship ended in victories for the Hornets, which, however, makes the Pistons an even bigger favourite in the upcoming game. It'll be interesting to see if Bickerstaff's team can pull off a 0:3 loss in this series, given the difference in class. We're going for Detroit and the total under. Firstly, Charlotte's offense isn't the strongest, and secondly, the Pistons lost their main scorer Jaden Ivey to injury. We're also betting on Detroit for assists.
