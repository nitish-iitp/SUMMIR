The Detroit Pistons (15-18) enjoying a recent surge in form expect to continue to climb up the standings when they host the floundering Charlotte Hornets (7-25) at home on Saturday morning. However, they’ll need to navigate the rest of the season without guard Jaden Ivey, who broke his fibula in their victory over the Orlando Magic earlier this week. The Hornets have battled injuries themselves with a slate of absences impacting team performances this season. Miles Bridges has been a standout player for the Hornets but the losses keep piling up. The Detroit Pistons are huge favorites to win.

Detroit Pistons

The Pistons’ fourth win in five games was soured when guard Jaden Ivey broke his leg in the 4th quarter against the Orlando Magic on January 2nd. The Pistons returned to winning ways with a 105-96 victory after dropping a game against Denver Nuggets to close out 2024. Jaden Ivey, the No. 5 pick from the 2022 Draft, scored 17 points against the Nuggets and added another 22 against the Magic to lead his team in both games. With ten minutes to go against Orlando Magic, Cole Anthony slipped and fell on Ivey’s leg while going for the ball and broke the 22-year-old’s leg. Averaging 17.6 points, Ivey was in his third year at Detroit. Cade Cunningham scored 19 points while dealing with an injured knee himself, while Jalen Duren added 18 points as the Pistons secured the victory after Ivey had been stretchered off. The Detroit Pistons are ninth seed in the East.
