The Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors battled it out again on Saturday night for the third time this season. The Grizzlies and Warriors have one win each heading into the matchup. However, both teams are without their best players in Ja Morant and Steph Curry, respectively, due to injuries.

Morant missed his fourth straight game with a sprained shoulder, while the Warriors decided to sit out Curry to give him additional rest. The two-time NBA MVP has been dealing with knee issues throughout the season, which has been described as a patellofemoral pain in both knees.

Andrew Wiggins stepped up for Golden State, finishing with 24 points, three assists and four steals to lead the Warriors to a 121-113 win. Dennis Schroder had 17 points and nine assists, while Lindy Waters III provided 16 points off the bench.
