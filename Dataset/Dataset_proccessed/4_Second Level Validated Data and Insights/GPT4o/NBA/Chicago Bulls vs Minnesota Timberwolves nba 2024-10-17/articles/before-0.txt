“What I've heard is yes, Julius Randle has been going hard, he's been playing, he's been practicing, doing bits and pieces more every single day," Charania said. "But the biggest thing that I checked in on is what has that dynamic been between Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards.
“Everything I hear … they've been hitting it off behind the scenes and I think how competitive and we know the spirit that Julius Randle has from a competitiveness perspective. Him and Donte DiVincenzo, the Timberwolves really believe bring a uniqueness when it comes to that competitive fire,” he added.

Earlier, Anthony Edwards praised DiVincenzo, saying Knicks fans would miss him:

"You can't be mad at him, man. He makes all the right plays and hits everything. New York is definitely going to miss him."

The Timberwolves will cap off their preseason tomorrow against the Denver Nuggets. They will open their regular season with a clash against the LA Lakers on Oct. 22.
