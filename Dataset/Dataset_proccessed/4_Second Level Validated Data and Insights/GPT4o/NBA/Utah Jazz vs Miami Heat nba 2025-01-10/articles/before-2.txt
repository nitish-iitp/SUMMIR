SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Tyler Herro scored 23 points and Jaime Jaquez had 20, including five in the final 1:03, to lead the Miami Heat to a 97-92 victory over the Utah Jazz on Thursday night.

In a ragged game with 31 combined turnovers and both teams shooting under 40%, the Heat made the most of transition points (17-7) and hustle plays when it mattered.

Collin Sexton and Lauri Markkanen each scored 23 for Utah, which has lost nine in a row at home.

The Jazz were missing six injured players, including Jordan Clarkson (foot), John Collins (hip), Keyonte George (heel) and Brice Sensabaugh, who scored 61 points in Utah's last two wins against Miami and Orlando before falling ill.

The Heat played without Kevin Love (personal reasons), who had rallied his teammates in a emotional meeting after Jimmy Butler was suspended for seven games, according to teammate Nikola Jovic.

Takeaways

Heat: Miami lost 136-100 to the Jazz at home in the first game of Butler's suspension but has improved each game since, losing in two overtimes to Sacramento before winning against Golden State and Utah.

Jazz: Already the worst team in the NBA at taking care of the ball, the Jazz had 17 turnovers — many unforced — but became the aggressors in the final minutes to give themselves a chance.

Herro set a franchise record with 70 straight games with at least one 3-pointer, breaking teammate Duncan Robinson's mark of 69 games ending in 2021.
