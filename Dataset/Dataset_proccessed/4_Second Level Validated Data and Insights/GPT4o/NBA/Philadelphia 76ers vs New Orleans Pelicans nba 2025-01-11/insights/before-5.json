        "The New Orleans Pelicans have suspended power forward Zion Williamson for their game against Philadelphia for a violation of team policies.",
        "Williamson has been tardy this season to multiple Pelicans practices or flights, which led to the one-game ban.",
        "Williamson has been sidelined by various injuries for more games than he has played since being drafted first overall out of Duke in 2019.",
        "Williamson has appeared in just seven of New Orleans\u2019 38 games this season. The Pelicans have gone 2-5 in those games, and 5-26 without him.",
        "The Pelicans also will play Friday without forward and top defensive player Herb Jones. Jones has a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder that will sideline him indefinitely."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "The 24-year-old Williamson apologized in a statement to team owner Gayle Benson and the entire organization for his behavior.",
        "Williamson stated, 'I take full responsibility for this suspension. I\u2019ve worked extremely hard in rehab to get healthy to deliver for this team. There is no excuse for being late to team activities. I have apologized to Mrs. Benson and my teammates and coaches and I also owe an apology to the fans. I can and will be better as a teammate and member of this organization.'",
        "Pelicans executive vice president David Griffin said, 'This one-game suspension is a result of failing to meet our team standards. His dedication to this organization is of paramount significance to us and to him. He has taken accountability for his actions and reaffirmed that commitment to the team today. I\u2019m confident he will continue to evolve positively on and off the floor.'"
