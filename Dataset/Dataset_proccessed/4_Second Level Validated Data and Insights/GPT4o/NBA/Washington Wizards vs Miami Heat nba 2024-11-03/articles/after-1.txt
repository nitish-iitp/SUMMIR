Behind Bam Adebayo’s best performance of the 2024-25 season to date, the Miami Heat secured a 118-98 win over the Washington Wizards in Mexico City Saturday night.

After struggling to find his offensive rhythm through the first four games, Adebayo posted a game-high 32 points on 12-of-24 shooting, including 3-of-5 from 3-point range in the winning effort. He also added 14 rebounds, including five offensive, with a pair of assists, one block and one steal. Miami shot 42.2 percent from the floor, including 15-of-37 (40.5 percent) from 3-point range.

The Heat stressed getting Adebayo involved early, scoring seven first-quarter points and 20 in the first half. Jimmy Butler followed suit with 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists on 6-of-13 shooting; Tyler Herro and Alec Burks posted 15 points apiece while Terry Rozier tallied 12 points with four assists.

Miami dominated the battle on the glass, finishing a plus-21 (65-44)–hauling down 21 offensive rebounds with 21 second-chance points.

Pelle Larsson also got his first real minutes of the season with Duncan Robinson (personal reasons) not making the trip. He had seven points, one rebound and two assists on 3-of-4 shooting with one triple in 14 minutes. First-round rookie Kel’el Ware saw three minutes of action at the end of the game, with Thomas Bryant getting primary backup big minutes behind Adebayo.

Second-year wing Bilal Coulibaly wasa the biggest standout from Saturday’s game on Washington’s side, adding a team-high 22 points on 8-of-12 shooting with eight rebounds and two assists. Jordan Poole finished with 21 points while the Wizards’ No. 2 overall pick Alex SSarr had 17 points, six rebounds, three assists and four blocks.

All in all, this was the Heat’s third victory against a bottom-feeder this season. It also marked their first double-digit victory, but now is where the brunt of the schedule ensues, with Sacramento coming up on Monday.

There are speculation, that Lillard could be available. Any interest for him around here?

As always, depends on the deal. At least he has one less year on that contract.

I wanted him to come last year. But it was a different situation. Jimmy played like MVP in the playoffs and Dame was supposed to be that second superstar that would help us win a championship. But even back then I was very much concerned about his contract.
Now we see that Dame is not the same Dame as he was few years ago and for sure Jimmy is not the same Jimmy. And more importantly we know what our deficits are and Dame is not the solution for them. So, I guess not. Superstars are hard to get, but this pairing with Jimmy would be a huge gamble at this point of their careers. Honestly I don’t think it would work. We should look elsewhere instead.

Hopefully this game will unlock bam for the rest of the season, this game should be the blueprint to get bam rolling by feeding him early, and often.

It was a great game for him. And he started taking those mid range shots. And he hit threes. He was a threat from everywhere. Played with energy.. That’s the Bam that we know.

Love to see it, if he continues playing like that I would consider it a good jump in his game offensively.

This was a revival game. Next 10 or so will show, where we are. Positive score after next 10 games will be a good sign.

Heat did that in the past several times.

Still, personally I would like to see a blow out win against good team.. just to see if there is a potential with this group.

Nice win! The team needed an easy one before a rough stretch coming up over the next couple of weeks.

Heat at home on Monday against Sacramento (3-3). Then a rough 6 game road trip to Phoenix (5-1), Denver (3-3), Minnesota (3-3), Detroit (1-5), and Indiana (2-4) twice. Team then returns home for two against Philadelphia (1-4) and Dallas (3-2) then Milwaukee (1-5) on the road.

Hopefully, we catch these teams when they are still not playing their best basketball.

I wonder if Miami folks had a chance to talk to Washington’s folks about a Kuzma trade? Still scuttlebutt out there about that trade happening.

I wouldn’t be surprised if we win just 2-3 games out of the next 10. We are better than Detroit and we should beat them, but we struggle against good teams. 76ers will have Embiid and George by then and the Bucks will not keep losing forever, too.
I don’t think we will beat Sacramento, Denver, Minesotta and Dallas. Hopefully they will prove me wrong…

And they have big dominant centers, who will bully us in the paint. This is always a problem for us.

I still want that trade. If you still have Jimmy, you go all in, and that trade is about the most impactful thing we are capable of with our payroll, roster, and draft capital. The best part is Washington wants to deal him too. Trade for him and we become competitive. Trade either Jovic or JJJ, with Larsen, add a pick, and maybe another player to make the money work, the other team gets two players with potential upside and a pick, and the moves don’t weaken us at all. Sit on your hands and we go nowhere.

W! I’d like another b2b wins pls.
In the 2 losses it was the guards who took the scoring reins, in the wins guess who? Jimmy. Now Bam. Small sample but if this will be the trend, Butler needs to play 80 games lol. We’ll rest him the last 2.

The Heat would be one of the best teams in the East if Jimmy Butler was still alive

Meanwhile, Dame goes for 40 in a loss, Embiid fights a reporter, and the Bucks and Sixers are a combined 2-9. HAHA!

More drama in that side of the league. Embiid’s fragile body is causing instability. Again.
