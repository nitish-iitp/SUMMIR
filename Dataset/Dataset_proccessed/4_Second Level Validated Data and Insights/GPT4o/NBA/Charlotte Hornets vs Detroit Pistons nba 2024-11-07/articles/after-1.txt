LaMelo Ball stats tonight: How did Hornets star guard fare against the Detroit Pistons? (Image credit: Imagn)

LaMelo Ball and the Charlotte Hornets hosted the Detroit Pistons at Spectrum Center, hoping to defy the odds (-1.5 handicap for the Pistons) and get their third win of the season. After a discreet game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday, the former No. 3 overall pick tried to bounce back against a similar opponent.

Ball had an active start to the game, but his shots weren't falling early on. He finished the first quarter with four points in six minutes, shooting 2-from-4 from the field. The Pistons took a one-point lead after the first period.

LaMelo Ball played seven more minutes in the second quarter, sinking his first 3-point attempt to enter halftime with seven points on 3-from-8 from the field. The Hornets took the lead of the game, 46-45.

The second half was as competitive as they come, with neither team winning the next two quarters. Ball kept trying to lead his team to the promised land but the Pistons wouldn't go down without a fight. He added three points to his account while dishing four assists.

The Hornets ended the third quarter up 77-76 and Ball was heating up for an entertaining final period. The first two minutes of the fourth quarter weren't the best for LaMelo Ball, as he missed a jump shot, a 3-pointer and committed a foul. He started making shots later, including a 27-foot step-back triple. Ball entered the final minute of the game with 20 points, but as the duel became more competitive, he scored five points in that span.

His floating jump shot with 24.1 seconds on the clock put the Hornets up 106-103. Brandon Miller called game with a tip shot after Grant Williams missed a game-winning 3-pointer.

The third and fourth quarter ended tied at 31 points per team, resulting in the Hornets winning after they got the advantage in the second quarter. The guard finished with 25 points on 10-from-23 from the field, including 5-from-12 from deep.

After an entertaining and hard-fought matchup, LaMelo Ball and the Charlotte Hornets improved to 3-5. The Hornets are playing better than expected and while they aren't seen as a serious title candidate, this team could lay the ground for more competitive seasons.

This result makes them an NBA play-in tournament team alongside the Bulls, Hawks and Magic. Charlotte snapped a three-game skid and will try to extend its good moment against the Pacers on Friday.
