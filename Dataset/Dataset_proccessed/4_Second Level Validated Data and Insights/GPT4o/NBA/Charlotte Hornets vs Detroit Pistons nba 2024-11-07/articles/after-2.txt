Honestly surprised this line opened this low with the current situation with the Hornets. Hornets are without Mark Williams and Nick Richards due to injury, which leaves the paint to be guarded by Taj "Grandpa" Gibson and Grant "Hobbit" Williams. For context, Gibson is 39 years old and can NOT keep up with Duren's athletic ability and Williams is 6'6" and Duren should have a field day on the glass for easy clean up buckets.

Duren had 12+ points in 40/58 (69%) games last season when he played at least 20 mins, Duren has played at least 21+ mins in every game this season. Duren has had 13+ points in 4/L5 vs the Hornets and 14+ in 3 straight. Those numbers are with the Hornets having their best big men, but now without them, Duren has an even greater advantage. The Hornets allow the 5th most points to Centers and the 7th most points in the paint. Everything is tilted in Duren's favor in this matchup and I expect him to dominate.

The Huddle got it here but 32.5 playable

LaMelo could very well go over this line with just points but this is a great spot for his assists to bounce back as well.

LaMelo saw his assists decline after 3 games against the Celtics (x2) and the Timberwolves, two of the best defensive teams in the league that also play at below average Paces. The Wolves allow the second fewest assists to their opponents and the Celtics allow the fourth-fewest.

Here, he gets a matchup against the Pistons who allow the 10th-most assists and have the 19th ranked Adjusted Defensive Rating.

LaMelo has exceeded this line in 71% of games this season and is averaging 34.3 PA. Tonight, I have him at about 27.5 points and 6.5 assists but think there’s some additional upside in the assists department due to matchup.

I’ll grab him to exceed 31.5 PA.

Playing on Underdog. Been under this line in 7/8 games and averaging 0.9 rebounds per game this season. Minutes are there but rebound opportunities have not been playing alongside Duren (10.5 rebs per game), Harris (7.8), Cade (6.4), & Ivey (4.5). Even the second unit of Stewart & Fontecchio are averaging a combined 10.2 rebs per game.
