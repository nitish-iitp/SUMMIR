Detroit had gained a little space in the tight game by going up 96-92 on Hardaway’s 3-pointer with 4:02 left. The score was tied three times in the final 3:27 at 96, 98 and 101.

The Hornets made all 16 of their free throw attempts during the game, while the Pistons were 5-for-9 at the foul line.

Detroit lost center Jalen Duren, 20, to an injured left ankle after just eight minutes of playing time. He exited with zero points and three rebounds one game after notching his 67th career double-double, marking the second most in NBA history for a player before turning 21 years old (Dwight Howard, 105).

Charlotte had a third-quarter stretch of almost three minutes without scoring, but Williams’ basket and Tidjane Salaun’s 3-pointer provided a 69-64 lead.
