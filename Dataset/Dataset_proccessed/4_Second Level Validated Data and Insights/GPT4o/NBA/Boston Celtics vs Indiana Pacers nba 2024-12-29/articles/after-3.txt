There are six games scheduled for Sunday night, including the Indiana Pacers vs Boston Celtics matchup. It's a rematch of last season's Eastern Conference Finals, as well as the third meeting of the regular season between the two teams. The Pacers won the first one 135-132 in overtime on Oct. 30 before the Celtics got their revenge on Dec. 27 with a dominating 142-105 victory.

Indiana has now lost two in a row after going on a five-game winning streak from Dec. 13 to Dec. 23. The Pacers currently sit eighth in the East standings with a 15-17 record. They are among the most inconsistent teams of the season so far.

Meanwhile, the Celtics were back to their winning ways after losing two straight games against the Orlando Magic on Dec. 23 and the Philadelphia 76ers on Christmas. They defeated the Pacers with ease on Friday, but they should expect a better fight tonight.

Indiana Pacers vs Boston Celtics Betting Tips

Tyrese Haliburton has an over/under of 17.5 points, which is slightly higher than his season average of 17.4 points per game. Haliburton is favored to go under due to his struggles offensively with the Indiana Pacers this season. Take the odds and bet on him to score 17 points or less.

Pascal Siakam is averaging 19.9 ppg this season and is favored to go over 18.5 points. Siakam has scored at least 19 points or more in six of his last seven games, which is a good indicator of his consistency. Place your money on "Spicy P" to go over 17.5 points.

Jayson Tatum is having an MVP-caliber season, averaging 28.7 ppg this season. Tatum has an over/under 28.5 points but is favored to go under. He has scored 29 or more in three of his last four games. He only had 22 points against the Pacers on Friday, but could easily get 29 points or more.

Jaylen Brown scored a season-high 44 points on Friday against the Pacers. Brown was simply unstoppable though his over/under is at 25.5 points. He has even odds heading into tonight's game, but it's possibly safer to bet on him to score at least 26 points.

Indiana Pacers vs Boston Celtics Prediction

The Boston Celtics are the overwhelming favorites to win Sunday's game against the Indiana Pacers. The oddsmakers have no faith that the Pacers will pull off the upset, given how badly they lost on Dec. 27.

The prediction is an easy win for the Celtics, with the total score likely going over 233.5 points.
