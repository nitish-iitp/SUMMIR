James Harden stats against the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 23 (Image Source: IMAGN)

James Harden and the LA Clippers hosted the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday at the newly-opened Intuit Dome. Without Kawhi Leonard, “The Beard” led the Clippers against the star-studded visitors. Joining Harden in the starting lineup were Derrick Jones Jr., Ivica Zubac, Terance Mann and Norman Powell.

Harden didn’t have his shooting touch to start the game. He was 1-for-9 midway through the second quarter, including 0-for-5 from deep. Suns star Devin Booker played a key role in limiting the three-time scoring champ. The Clippers point guard, however, hustled on the boards and impacted the game with his playmaking.

James Harden bounced back from a rough shooting first half to scatter 14 points in the third quarter. Clippers coach Ty Lue forced Suns defenders to go through multiple screens to give “The Beard” some daylight. The strategy worked as Harden got into a rhythm and dragged his team back into the game. After trailing 47-39 at halftime, the Clippers took a 74-72 lead before the fourth quarter.

The former Houston Rockets MVP continued to sizzle in the fourth quarter. He added eight more points to his tally, four coming in the final 1:14 in regulation. Harden had a chance to win the game for the Clippers but missed a potential game-winning layup as time expired.

Harden looked tired in the extra period. He continued to run the offense but couldn't complete his heroics as the Phoenix Suns walked away with a 116-113 win in overtime.

LA Clippers needed vintage James Harden to compete against Phoenix Suns

Phoenix looked ready to run Los Angeles out of its $2 billion arena before vintage James Harden showed up. Harden’s second-half performance dragged the Kawhi Leonard-less team to a near upset of the Suns.

“The Beard” impressed on offense, smartly using screens and switches to get his preferred matchups. He mostly targeted Tyus Jones, the Suns’ diminutive point guard. Harden might have completed his heroics in regulation had he made a last-second layup.

Harden also showed up on the defensive end. He hustled and provided help defense when needed. This is the version of Harden the Clippers need to have from Harden to keep afloat while Leonard recovers from a sore knee.
