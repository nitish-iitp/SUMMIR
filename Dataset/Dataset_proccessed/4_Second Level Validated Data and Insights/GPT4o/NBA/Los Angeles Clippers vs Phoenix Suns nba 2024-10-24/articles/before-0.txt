Looking at Kevin Durant's stats tonight (Image Source: Getty)

Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns took on the LA Clippers in their newly unveiled Intuit Dome on Wednesday to kick off their 2024-25 season. The Suns, anchored by their star trio of Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, have a fresh start with new head coach Mike Budenholzer as they aim to improve on last season's early playoff exit in the first round.

Their first challenge came against a Clippers team that lost Paul George during the offseason and is grappling with the indefinite absence of star forward Kawhi Leonard, sidelined by ongoing knee issues.

The Suns had to dig deep to survive the Clippers and capture a 116-113 win in overtime. Durant led the team in scoring with 25 points, while Beal and Booker had 24 and 15, respectively.

Will Kevin Durant sign an extension with Suns?

Despite the Suns' recent playoff struggles, Kevin Durant has remained a reliable presence, posting averages of 27.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game last season.

Phoenix acquired Durant from the Nets in a high-profile trade that sent Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, four first-round picks and a 2028 first-round pick swap to Brooklyn.

Durant still has two years remaining on his current deal and will become an unrestricted free agent after the 2025-26 season. However, He's eligible for a one-year, $59.7 million extension that would keep him with the Suns through the 2026-27 season.

During media day, Durant said contract talks would come at the right time and expressed he would first focus on the season ahead.

"Two years left on my contract, I’m focused on being the best that I can every day… We’ll figure that stuff out when it’s time,” he said via Yahoo Sports.

Suns owner Matt Ishbia reiterated the franchise's commitment to keeping Durant long-term, noting that the two-time champion enjoys playing in Phoenix.

"Kevin Durant loves it here, we love Kevin Durant. We talk to him and his agent Rich Kleiman all the time… We don’t really go through contract extensions publicly, but I’ll tell you this: Kevin loves it, we love Kevin. We plan on Kevin being here and nothing’s changing with that."
