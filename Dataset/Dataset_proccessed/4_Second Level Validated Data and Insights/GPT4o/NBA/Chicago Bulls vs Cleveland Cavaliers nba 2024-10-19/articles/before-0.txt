Bulls continue commitment to new offensive identity in preseason finale against Cavaliers
Overall, the Bulls feel good about their three-point attack and pace. They know how important it is for them to attack teams in transition and to make the three-pointer a weapon.

On a Bulls possession in the third quarter Friday, guard Zach LaVine made a backdoor cut and sank a reverse layup. As he ran back in transition, the Bulls lost Cavaliers guard Caris LeVert, who knocked down a corner three-pointer.

Immediately after the defensive breakdown, assistant coach Wes Unseld Jr. — who coached in place of Billy Donovan (illness) — called a timeout.

That sequence perfectly summed up the Bulls’ performance in their 139-137 preseason victory against the Cavaliers in overtime: A good play immediately was followed by a mistake.
