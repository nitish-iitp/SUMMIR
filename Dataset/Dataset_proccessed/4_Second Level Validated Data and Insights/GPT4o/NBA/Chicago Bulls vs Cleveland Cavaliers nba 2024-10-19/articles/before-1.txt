Lonzo Ball stats against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Oct. 18 (Image Source: IMAGN)

Lonzo Ball was greeted with a standing ovation on Wednesday when he played for the Chicago Bulls for the first time since January 2022. He promptly drained two 3-pointers that had the United Center crowd rocking. “Zo” couldn’t replicate the same hot display in his first few minutes on Friday against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Like in his first game, he came in midway through the first quarter but missed his first two shots. He did have another solid performance running the Chicago Bulls offense. Ball’s stat showed one assist that led to a point-blank layup by Nikola Vucevic.

The former LA Lakers guard got his chance to play in the second quarter with 7:27 remaining in the period. He shared the floor with Coby White as Chicago’s two point guards. Ball's first basket was a 26-footer off a Zach LaVine handoff with 5:37 on the clock. He helped keep the Bulls within 61-54 of the Cavaliers by halftime.

Lonzo Ball's best stretch happened in the third quarter when he scattered eight points, two assists and two rebounds. He effectively orchestrated the plays and contributed in rebounding and on defense. It was another solid display from the 2017 No. 2 pick.

Chicago Bulls coach Billy Donovan kept him sidelined in the fourth quarter and overtime in Chicago's 139-137 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Lonzo Ball's two-way impact was impressive

From a player who hasn't played in nearly three years, Lonzo Ball looked like he hasn't missed a beat in his return. Ball showed flashes of his two-way impact against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday. Two nights later, he had even bigger contributions on both ends of the floor.

When Billy Donovan used both Coby White and Ball together, it was the veteran guard who handled playmaking chores. "Zo" didn't disappoint Donovan and the team. One play in the third quarter stood out that had the home fans lustily approving.

Ball almost lazily brought the ball to the Bulls' end of the court before suddenly whipping a pass to Zach LaVine. The point guard caught Cleveland's defense napping and his pass allowed LaVine to score an easy layup.

Defensively, Ball had no trouble shadowing guards and small forwards. He even had stretches defending the speedy Darius Garland. Chicago's 6-foot-7 also held up when matched up against bigger players in the paint.

Lonzo Ball's two-way impact on Friday was impressive and fans will hope he can have an impact on the new season.
