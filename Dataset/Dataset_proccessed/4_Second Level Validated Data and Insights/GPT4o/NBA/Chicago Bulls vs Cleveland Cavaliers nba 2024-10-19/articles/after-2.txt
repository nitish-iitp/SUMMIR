CLEVELAND CAVALIERS
Cavaliers' Max Strus Out 6 Weeks with Ankle Injury Suffered in Individual Workouts

Cleveland Cavaliers sharpshooter Max Strus is out and will be reassessed by the team in six weeks after suffering a sprained right ankle during an individual workout on Thursday, according to Daryl Ruiter of 92.3 The Fan.

Strus missed two preseason games with a hip contusion before the ankle sprain kept him out of Cleveland's matchup with the Chicago Bulls on Friday, per Ruiter.

The 28-year-old started 70 regular-season games and 12 playoff contests for the Cavaliers last year.

He previously missed 12 games in March due to a right knee strain.

The team announced on Saturday that Strus underwent an X-ray and MRI to confirm the severity of the sprain before determining the six-week reassessment timeline.

It's a tough blow to a Cavaliers starting unit that's expected to attempt a high volume of threes under new head coach Kenny Atkinson. Point guard Darius Garland discussed the approach that Atkinson wanted the opening five to take when speaking to reporters on Oct. 7.

"Kenny's a big three-point attempt guy," Garland said (h/t SI.com's Spencer Davies). "So we try to get as many threes as we can. Try to get out in transition, walk-up threes. He's been on me and [Donovan Mitchell] about those in transition as well. Even Max [Strus] when he's open."

Strus' long-range proficiency is one of the main reasons why Cleveland handed him a four-year, $63 million contract as part of a sign-and-trade agreement during the 2023 offseason.

He shot 35.1 percent from three while attempting 6.8 shots from behind the arc per game during his first year with the organization, averaging a career-high 12.2 points each night.

Until he's able to return, Cleveland will likely rely on Dean Wade and Georges Niang to replace his production.
