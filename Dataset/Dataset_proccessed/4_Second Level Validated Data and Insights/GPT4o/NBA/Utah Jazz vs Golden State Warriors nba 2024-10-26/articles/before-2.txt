Looking at Steph Curry's stats tonight - Image Source: Imagn

Steph Curry had been listed as questionable with a right hip contusion before the Golden State Warriors' Friday night matchup against the Utah Jazz, but he ended up playing and starting.

The Warriors entered the game following a commanding 140-104 win over the Portland Trail Blazers in their home opener, setting a franchise record for the largest margin of victory in a road opener and most points in any season debut with the 36-point triumph. Meanwhile, the Jazz were still seeking their first win after a narrow loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.

The Warriors won convincingly, toppling the home team by 41 points, 127-86. Six players scored in double digits for the Warriors, including Curry who had 20 points in 27 minutes and Buddy Hield who exploded for 27 points and seven 3s off the bench.

Steph Curry confident in Warriors’ potential despite missing out on major offseason targets

The Warriors explored acquiring Paul George and trading for Lauri Markkanen this offseason, but neither pursuit materialized. Nonetheless, Steph Curry remains optimistic about the Warriors’ outlook.

“It always has been and still is a goal of mine to be a Warrior for life, to stay competitive throughout that process. I’m very confident in the fact of being here and being a relevant winning team is possible," Curry said.
"Until I’m proven otherwise, that’s the way I’m moving forward.”

Coach Steve Kerr intends to utilize a 12-man rotation this season to capitalize on the Warriors' depth, but an insider anticipates the team will make another “significant” trade during the 2024-25 season.

According to The Athletic’s Anthony Slater, the Warriors are likely to pursue a "consolidation trade" involving rotation players, draft picks, and young talent to reinforce the roster.

“They’ll make a significant trade. In a slightly upgraded form, the Warriors have the same problem as a season ago,” Slater said.
“I imagine they’ll win enough games to stay in the playoff mix, tick off a couple of capable players who are buried in the rotation and then, once January or February nears, find a consolidation trade that better balances the roster and rotation.”
