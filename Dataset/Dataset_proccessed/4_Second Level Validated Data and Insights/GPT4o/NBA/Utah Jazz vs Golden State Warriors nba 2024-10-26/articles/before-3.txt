Steph Curry fires direct command to teammates

Following the Warriors' season-opening win, coach Steve Kerr discussed plans to regularly rotate 12 players. In response, Steph Curry acknowledged that the rotation would likely tighten as the season progresses but urged his teammates to maintain high energy and set aside personal egos for the team’s success.

"I'm sure there's going to be a little bit of narrowing down of rotation at some point, depending on how things materialize, but that's not for us to worry about right now," Curry said.
