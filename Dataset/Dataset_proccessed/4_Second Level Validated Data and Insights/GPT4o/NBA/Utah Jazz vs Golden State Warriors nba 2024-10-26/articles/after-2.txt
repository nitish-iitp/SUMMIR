Takeaways

Warriors: Golden State had its second straight blowout win over a team that may be battling for lottery position after beating Portland 140-104 in the opener. The Warriors employed a trapping defense to force the Jazz into turnovers and crisp passing to get Hield and Curry open jumpers. Curry and most of the starters sat out the fourth quarter.

Jazz: After a competitive loss to Memphis, the Jazz couldn’t shoot or handle the pressure from the Warriors. Simple rotations were bungled and the Jazz misfired from the 3-point line all the way to the lane.

Key moment

Hield came off the bench midway through the first quarter with the Warriors trailing by nine and immediately hit a 3-pointer off a pass from Curry and followed it with a layup. Hield then became a facilitator and found Curry for a 3 and Gary Payton II for a layup to give the Warriors a 22-21 lead.
