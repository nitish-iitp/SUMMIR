Kings 113, 76ers 107: Kentucky Connection in the Clutch
The Kings used a 15-0 run at the end of the game to win their second straight.

The Kings flipped the script on Wednesday’s New Years Day matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers, pulling off a clutch 4th quarter comeback to win 113 to 107. When Philadelphia star Tyrese Maxey snagged a turnover from De’Aaron Fox and hit a running layup to put the 76ers up 107 to 98 with 3:34 to go, it seemed recent history in the Golden 1 Center may be repeating itself. Instead, Sacramento went on a 15-0 run to end the game and secure their second straight victory, winning 113 to 107.

It was the Kentucky Connection of Fox and Malik Monk who secured the game on offense; Fox finished with 35 points and 4 assists on 13 of 16 shooting and scored 14 of those points in the final period. Monk had 20 points and 6 assists in the game, and had 10 points and went 8 of 8 from the free throw line in the 4th. But the Kings also upped their defensive physicality in the clutch, as they stopped the 76ers on their final eight possessions that included two huge steals by DeMar DeRozan.

DeRozan finished with 18 points, 5 boards, and the DPOG Crown, while Domantas Sabonis had 17 points, 21 rebounds, and 7 assists (albeit with 7 turnovers) and feasted at times against a 76ers front line that was absent star Joel Embiid.

Paul George had 30 points and 8 boards for the Sixers but scored none of those points in the 4th quarter. Maxey finished with 27 points and 7 assists.

Keegan Murray missed the contest due to ankle soreness. In the absence of both Murray and Embiid, both teams ran with smaller starting lineups – Nick Nurse started Guerschon Yabusele (8 points and 1 rebound) to matchup with Sabonis at center, while Doug Christie started Keon Ellis in Murray’s place. Ellis finished with 9 points, 4 steals, and 2 blocks, and hit a big three with 1:48 to go in the game that kept the Kings’ momentum going.

Golden 1 Center sounded like they were watching a playoff contest in the closing minutes. To celebrate the victory, Coach Christie took the team to see the Beam in person.

The Kings stick around in Sacramento for a matchup tomorrow against the Memphis Grizzlies.

Fox and Monk were huge, and a big part of it was that they weren’t settling for three or forcing threes. They both were getting into the paint and attacking. Great to see.

The defense stepped up a notch in the fourth. Throwing double teams at PG especially, and recovering from them well.

DeMar’s read on that last inbound was incredible. Started off guarding Lowry who was inbounding the ball, and then drifted off when he read what the offense was doing and and stole the ball as Lowry tried to get it to Maxey. Fantastic read and reaction.

The final 3.5 minutes were very fun.

I can’t recall a team coming from behind that late in the game by going on a 15-0 run. That’s impressive no matter what anyone’s thoughts on the team are.

reminiscent of the 19-0 shut out run the Beam Team (2022-2023 vintage) had in Cleveland (December 9, 2022).

‘Ya’ll are the light of the city, man. And when you light that motherfucker, it means something to people’

I am hoping the old dog, DC, can put some fight into the new guys, this team has been soft for a long time.

My hopes are they are turning it around and beating depleted teams is a start. We have seen them lose many, many of these type of games in the last two years. So winning a couple is a little progress. Also, playing with some defensive intensity and hustle is some progress. Maybe they can turn it around.

My fears are the roster is too wonky and flawed, they are too inconsistent and Monte will fail to rebalance the roster in a meaningful way. The season is too far gone. And this is a short term, we got our coach fired so we better play hard, unsustainable boost.

Doug knows what it is like to win at a high level in Sacramento. There isn’t another team in the 4 major sports in Sacramento (unless the A’s count now, but whatever). It’s the only national attention we get. Sacramento is a proud city.

It’s easy to dismiss wins against depleted opponents, but as you said we’ve seen them lose so many games to “inferior” teams over the last few years that I welcome any game in which they play hard, execute well (for the most part), and win.

Last year, if they took care of teams like DET, POR, WSH which were similar types of games, they would have been in the playoffs not the play-in. So winning when you should win counts for a lot.

They play the opponent on the schedule. Can’t control the opponents injuries, rest, etc. Take the wins when you can get them.

Let’s say this team ends up 41-41 this season, and they lost to “depleted teams”, we would be looking back saying “damn, if they only beat those teams that didn’t have their stars playing, they would be have been 45-37.”

Just win the games. They played hard, with toughness, and didn’t shy away from the moment. That’s what competing is all about.

I woke up in the middle of the night with some weird thought in my head: Are the Kings the 76ers West?

1) Both teams are offensively focused around their super skilled big men (Sabonis and Embiid)

2) Both teams have extremely quick and offensive minded PGs (Fox and Maxey)

3) Both teams went out and got an aging star to take them to the next level (DDR and PG)

4) Both teams rounded out their weak benches with washed vet minimum deals (McDermott/Crowder and Lowry/Gordon)

5) Both teams have traditional 7′ backup centers (Len and Drummond)

6) Both teams have struggled to get things to gel and have underperformed in their respective conferences.

7) Lastly, IMO both teams/fanbases are wondering if they have what it takes to compete or should things just get blown up (Marty have have some Philly fan imput on this one).

I just watched the game last night and thought the 76ers had the same kind of issues we see from the Kings. Are the pieces just mismatched and underperforming?

Also, in terms of Fox vs Maxey, I see them as very similar players but the difference is Maxey is now 3rd fiddle to Embiid and PG, so it made we wonder if Fox really should be the #1 option for a winning team, or is he and his team best served as him being the Robin to a team’s Batman?

#1 on a winning team, maybe.

Fox is not and will never be a #1 on a contender and I have said that for years. He is good to very good not great. He is an elite, elite athlete who plays basketball, not an elite, elite basketball player.

That has been the Kings problem treating (hoping) him like he is a true #1.

And not bashing him just saying he is not that level, IMO there are only around 10-15 (maybe less) of those guys at any given time.

Does that mean that 15-20 teams should just punt every season until they find one of those 10-15 #1 players on a title contender? (probably more like 5-10)

That’s where I get stuck as a basketball fan (and sports fan in general). You head in to the season knowing you don’t have Luka, Jokic, Tatum, Lebron, Curry, etc. so why the hell even try?

Because that list you just rattled off changes every couple of years. 3 years ago, no one would have dropped Tatum or Jokic into that conversation in a serious way. In 3 years, Curry, KD and LeBron won’t be in it all anymore (Curry is slipping HARD this year and I’d be surprised if he doesn’t hang them up this year or next). Throwing “Sabonis or Fox” into that conversation right now is crazy, but there’s a non-zero chance that Fox+Domas is as good or better than Joker+Murray. It’s the rest we need to figure out.

We don’t know if someone is a #1 option on a title contender until they have shown it.

I watch the Kings anyway, win or lose, good or terrible. It is the sport I have stuck with the most. My baseball enjoyment has pretty much gone away, even though I played for 20 years and think it is the best sport out there (thank Manfred and Fischer!).

Jimmy Butler? From where he began his career to where he got with the Heat was quite the transformation. I didn’t think he would be the scorer he became, especially in the playoffs.

Steph it means going back a long time but, yeah, at one point I didn’t think he was great.

I would agree with Butler and Steph (first 3-4 years) for sure.

Going back to Fox or Sabonis, any who were this far into their career and still not sure about?

I guess Butler like you mentioned maybe there are others. Not many though

Curry was six years in, I think. Kawhi was several years in when he got to Toronto. He had established himself as an elite player in SA, but I don’t know that he had alpha status yet.

It is such a cocktail of timing, luck, talent and opportunity. Hell, LeBron has missed the playoffs during his career, so it is more than being even an arguable GOAT. You have to have the right supporting cast, the right coaching, good health, and a few breaks along the way. I would have not seen recent versions of the Celts or Nugs winning championships. And while I really can’t see Fox and Sabonis being Tatum/Brown or Jokic/Murray, I think that chances of that (less than 5%) are better than starting from scratch (a 1 in 30 team chance would be 3%, and you probably have to dial that down even farther for small market teams).

I’m not in the blow it up camp. I think with some tweaks to the roster this team can get better and be a playoff team. Contender? Probably not.

Just IMO, I don’t think Fox or Domas are at that level and they aren’t young players anymore.

I think the level of players we are discussing are usually good enough to get their teams to the playoffs even without a great supporting cast.

Before they won titles I think most people would have had Giannis, Tatum or Joker as a top 10-15 player in the world.

Guys moving into that list or future maybes, IMO;
SGA, Wemby, Brunson

I have never seen Fox or Sabonis as that. Maybe 15-20 but 20-25 seems more realistic without actually making a list.

How many players have worn a Sacramento Kings uniform and simultaneously been one of the top 10-15 over the last 40 years? Mitch and C-Webb are the only two I can think of. It’s sad to compare this franchise with the rest of the NBA from that perspective. Fox has pretty much peaked around that 15-25 range, imo.

Steph has outside the NBA projects which will help when he retires, but as we know and have seen, he will become quickly forgettable once his basketball career finishes. And he’s legendary (like Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Wayne Gretzky) – unless you stay in the public eye, the public mind forgets (Shaq, Barkley and the Inside the NBA gig).

Can you win it all without a Superstar?

I believe, in NBA basketball, you can. It is difficult, but attainable. You have to have a well constructed roster, that is well coached and well constructed. And luck.

It is my argument for reasonable expectations, here in good ol’ Sacramento. I want, I expect, there should be – a competitive product on the court every season. Win a championship, compete for a championship? We can hope, but it’s likely a pipe dream. Think Cleveland. Miami. They can get close – and sometimes, when the cards line up, they can make the Finals, and maybe a superstar will end up in The City of Trees and carry them, but I wouldn’t count on it (but Milwaukee, and San Antonio). Look at OKC now. And there was the Glory Day Kings.

Compete. Be a playoff team. Win a playoff series. Maybe compete for a conference or finals series win.

What teams have won it all without a superstar?

03-04 Pistons?
78-79 Supersonics?

I didn’t do a deep dive, but those teams stood out. Pistons had a good group of players (Billups, Rasheed, Hamilton, Wallace, Tayshaun) but no real superstar. I think that is what the Kings chances would look like. A group of really good players that mesh well.

P.S.
The Kings are nowhere near the level of the 03-04 Pistons.

It happens but not often. The Pistons with Sheed and Billups are probably the most recent. Supersonics from the 70s maybe. Maybe Toronto from a few years back depending on how you view Kawhi.

Maybe Winning a Championship shouldn’t be the goal at this time.

Maybe – let’s construct a stable winning franchise and get players and agents interested in being a part of a Playoff perennial or regular team.

Laughingstock is cheap, and the Kings are plentiful in their accumulation of it.

The Stockton/Malone Utah Jazz teams – so close yet so far, the Seattle teams, some of the D’Antoni Phoenix teams, the more recent, post Hakeem Rockets. Even those Adelman Glory Day Kings teams.

Good, tough, squads that were a challenge to beat everyone, anyone, not a challenge to watch or support.

Kinda, yeah. It’s the reality of pro sports. I would say especially the NBA. The NFL too if you think of QBs.

I guess it all depends on how you fan. Personally, if the Kings are even decent I will watch most of the games and be into it. If they are good, I am all in. If they suck, I don’t give them as much time or thought.

It comes as a big shock to me that .500 isn’t the ultimate goal. A shock! <clutches pearls>

I mean, seriously. We won 48 games 2 years ago but every Kings fan was deeply disappointed in the first round exit. I don’t know where you get off assuming every other Kings fan is just an idiot rube. It’s condescending and tiring, no matter which of your many personas you’re using.

(Marty have have some Philly fan imput on this one).

Both of my teams have me feeling “meh” for different reasons that seem obvious.

I like Fox’s game, but feel like they should FOR ONCE get something in return for an asset before he walks. I’ve never liked Embiid’s game, fool’s gold.

One thing is for sure, nobody in Philly thinks this team has a deep playoff run in it. When I look at the calendar ahead I say to myself, “That’s the day Embiid misses the rest of the season.”

I watched the game last night and I just don’t care. I wonder if it’s me entering my mid-50’s and not caring about professional sports as much as I used.. GO EAGLES!

I can’t help but watch a game like last night and zoom out to the view from 50,000 feet/aliens on The Simpsons and say, “None of this really matters.”

It’s written higher up on this thread, something about if we don’t get that franchise-altering player than what’s the point? I struggle with that in Sacramento because I know A-listers aren’t coming here, no matter how many rah-rahs Doug leads on the roof.

If Fox stays I strongly believe we need a solid point guard to run the offense and Fox is the two. The next level of competition plays at a different level than Fox does at the point.

Fox is a scoring threat because of speed.

Man the Sam Amick spot on the radio this morning with Jason Ross is just dispiriting. The general gist is that the organization is really poorly run. Vivek treats his employees like garbage and all of this chaos comes from him. It’s basically everything we sort of already knew but it’s just depressing to me. Even if they make some roster changes, it won’t matter in the long run. When the core of the organization is rotten, the fruit is always going to turn out bad.

They won a couple games against teams that were very injured and still needed large comebacks to do it. None of the underlying issues with the team have improved AT ALL. The three point shooting is still awful and they can’t defend the three point line. As soon as they run up against non-injured or just better teams they’re going to go on another losing streak. It’s just impossible for me to see any positives with this team moving forward.

Here is a little “test” that I like to give out: Without researching, name the owners of the San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder (Seattle fans ace this one), and the Miami Heat.

The best owners cede the decision making (and the spotlight) to well run front offices. They still have the final word, but you won’t find a “Stauskas” video anywhere for Peter Holt, Clay Bennett or Micky Arison. They won’t insert themselves into a Kendrick Lamar – Drake beef. The Spurs, Thunder and Heat? They not like us.

I knew nothing had changed in Game 1 of the Warriors playoff series when Vivek pushed himself to light the beam with Fox on ABC. Vivek wants to be the center of attention when things are going well but refuses to take accountability when things aren’t.

 It’s just impossible for me to see any positives with this team moving forward.

This last line is the only one I didn’t find myself agreeing with. Things are pretty dark overall and I do think that Vivek is at the core of this pathetic, mostly-garbage franchise.

But I’m still high on Keegan. I love that we have Monk for 4 years. I think that Domas is the best center that Sacramento has ever seen. I’m cautiously excited about what Devin Carter can bring. Keon is an absolute joy to watch. I can’t remember many players since Bobby and Doug that play with such defensive intensity. When he’s on, DeMar is fabulous. I’m very appreciative that we aren’t watching players whine and complain like Boogie used to do. And nobody on this team is as stupid as Buddy Hield, so we’ve got that going for us.

I also think that we all need to appreciate how great Fox has been for the franchise overall and I’m thankful that Monte McNair isn’t a complete Vlade or D’Alessandro-type fuckup, while I acknowledge his failure to keep Vivek’s mitts off the team. He has amassed a set of players on mostly tradeable contracts which makes me think we could bounce back quickly.

Shit’s bad, no doubt. But on a personal level, I’m not going to act like there’s nothing positive. I just wish the positives outweighed the negatives.

This.

+1 I think there are only 5 teams in the west who I would definitely trade situations with right now. OKC, Dallas, San Antonio, Nuggets and Houston.

Portland is young, but not fun. I couldn’t bring myself to root for Ja Morant. I think LAL, GSW, and PHX are going off into the sunset with little reason for long-term optimism. Utah has Danny Ainge, but will pick 8th every year forever [and I live here]. The Pelican are at least as messy as Sacramento, and while I love ANT, the Wolves have big problems, too. They reached higher peaks, but I think they’re tapped out on resources.

The Warriors have far superior owners than the Kings, which is a good reason for long term optimism for that franchise, regardless of short-term issues. I’d trade situations with the Warriors over the next 10 years easily.

Definitely to an extent, I buy this. However — as a perhaps indefatigable optimist — I will say that there are at least two positives here.

#1 — The culture is better than it was pre-Mike Brown. I’m glad we’ve kept the beam, DPoG Crown, and so forth which I thought might go away with DC. DC instead seems to be a capable (so far!) x’s and o’s guy who gets being on the court in those big moments. I like his comments about not being too friendly with other players during games. It makes us better. Are we championship caliber? No. But Vivek seems to love the spotlight (like Rob points out) and so the spotlight on his crap (no breakfast, basketball hell, meddling openly) seems to have put pressure on him to at least stay a little more behind. The more Sam Amick and others point this out publicly and often, I think Vivek changes if only becuase he’s a reputation first guy.

#2 Every team is streaky. Remember when the Warriors and Suns were 9-2? Dubs have gone gone 7-14 over their last 21 games and the Suns have gone 6-15. Point differential (which is a significantly better long term projector than current record) has the Kings 12th in the League. And that’s with their point differential being low because of losses. If the team evens out (like I like to think they would have with Mike Brown and I still believe with DC) that is possible to go up. The kings are 6-7 over their last 13, and are 7-4 in games decided by 10+ points this year. They’re close in nearly every game this year, and they integrated a massive new piece this year. Being 8-15 in close games (and more pointedly 8-12 overall at home this year) stings because it’s so counter to what we hope and expect. We tend as human beings to believe in infinite current trends from how we see them, but that’s not usually how things go. Give the kings a reasonable 6 game win streak and they no longer have to play .680 ball the rest of the year to make the play-in.

Some of the losses recently have stung extra. 3 straight to LAL? Ouch. 5 straight at home? oof. I mean, we didn’t even make the NBA Cup semis this year. What a rough start.

But that old adage about starts and finishes is there for a reason. Dallas was a 6 seed who made the finals last year. LAL has did crazy things after early bad returns two years ago.

That’s the point. This team is not catching any team in the Top 6. If they get to a play in, do you call that progress? They will not beat any of the Top 6 teams healthy in a series.

Play in is the high bar for this roster. A
Cam
Johnson move.
This team is still a play in.

No one talks about Lavine and what’s he’s doing this year. Quietly one of the Top 3 Sgs in the league this year.

Seems worth the money now

Gets paid a lot. But Kings threw their money at DDR. Just like when Brooks was available last season.’

Some kings fans didn’t want him. He’ will
ruin the culture? What Culture.

What no one is talking about and is pathetic. Still no press conference on the firing or anything. Really trash. And really unheard of.

The wins with Christie are wins. Does the team win either with Dallas entire starting lineup and Embiid playing for the Sixers No.

I have heard multiple Podcasts from top end NBA best reporters. Not one. Not 1 has anything good to say about this front office.

You wonder why free agents will ever come here. When it comes to trades.
Most good players are automatically going to tell their current team and agent. Send me anywhere but to Hell.

Demar and Monk came here (Monk even re-signed when he could have went elsewhere this offseason).

Vivek is the issue. He is the leader of the franchise. Everything falls on him. Lack of communication, lack of accountability, poor interpersonal relationships, bad vibes, etc. A good leader takes ownership of the failures of his team/organization, and looks inside himself to see where he messed up and how he can improve moving forward. I don’t think Vivek does that, nor will he ever do that. So it comes down to everyone else succeeding in spite of Vivek (makes me think of Major League and how they all banded together to overcome their owner that wanted them to fail).

Pass. I get that Hield makes more shots this season, but that dude is clueless. At least Kevin seems to be decently smart on the court.

Seen the Buddy show before, not worth watching again.

I’d rather watch Huerter go 1 for 8 every night than watch Buddy dribble the ball out of bounds off his foot or yell instructions to the team while his defender picks his pocket for a game-clinching TO in the final minute of a game ever again.

I hope to one day soon see an NBA basketball team in Sacramento that will beat a weakened opponent at least three out of four quarters. The comebacks are fun but not at all necessary or a sign of a quality basketball organization. It was 70% of the Sixers that we put all we had against them.

The win against a bad team is sign of rock bottom being found and some sort of stable bottom now exists. We can and should do better as an organization.

An unimpressive win is a win. Possibly something to build on.

Better than losing against depleted/bad opponents, we have our share of those. I am 100% convinced they lose last night with MB.

What I say is you need to go root for the Lakers. You are always negative and never have told me any solutions to your negativity. I see positives in this organization. Not at the top but in the players themselves and the coach. I enjoy watching them even if they just win a game or two against depleted teams. It has to start somewhere. All you have to do is go to a game and watch and listen to the Sacramento Kings fans. Yes they deserve better but they won’t stop cheering and having fun. GO KINGS! GO KINGS! GO KINGS. I am so tired of all this negative crap.

One man’s pessimism is another man’s realism. Wherever one determines to set his/her reality, this organization constantly makes it easier to default to the negative side of things as opposed to the positive side of things.

To wit, do you know who leads this team in total blocks this season? As well as 3P% for those that have shot it 100+ times? And also leads the team in steal%? It would be none other than Keon Ellis, who also happens to rank fifth out of the five chuckers in total minutes played. WTF? How does this happen? He’s shooting .419 from deep for a team that is collectively at .338, while also providing probably the best overall defense of any player. This is the tomfuckery that leads Kings fans to be a little cranky when their team is gacking up game after game after game.

Every Kings fan that participates on this site does so because they are Kings fans. Some fuel themselves with hope, while others do so with the misery that has been the calling card of this wobegone organization for the overwhelming majority of its time in Sacramento.

I don’t agree with all of the “negativity” that I read in the comments, but I sure understand it. And sadly, over the past 40 years, those types of comments have proven out to be much more often right than wrong.

I like to think that this team can compete for titles in the near future. That is not next week but hopefully within the next three to five years. As fans we need to hold the front office and ownership accountable. Accepting less than average performance is not doing that.

There are obvious needs this team has ignored and that is an injustice to this fanbase.

Winning 3 out of 4 quarters isn’t the ultimate goal. Winning championships is. I, for one, choose to hold the Kings organization to a higher standard than just 3 out of 4 quarters!

Am I doing this right? Should I also get another 10 logins and give myself 10 thumbs up?

A team that wins games consistently wins the majority of the games they play. That would make them a successful team.

I’ll answer your question if you answer mine that follows. Nope, not angry at all. I just don’t enjoy how much you tell others how they’re allowed to “fan”, according to you. I say that understanding the irony that it probably sounds like I’m telling you how to “fan” here, too.

My question (okay, questions) for you is: why so many profiles? Do you get tired of the way people interact with you and feel like you need a fresh new approach? If that’s the case, why not just try changing your interaction style in the same way that you do for the first 5-10 days after you start commenting under a new profile, but, you know, permanently?
