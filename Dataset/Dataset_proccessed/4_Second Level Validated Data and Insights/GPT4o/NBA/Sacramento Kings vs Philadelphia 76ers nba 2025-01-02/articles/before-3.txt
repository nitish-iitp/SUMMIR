Poll
Do you think Congress should act to make Social Security benefits tax-exempt, as President-elect Trump has proposed?
1. Yes. Taxes were already paid on the orginal earnings. Taxing benefits is double taxation.
2. Yes. Making benefits tax-free will give needed extra money to Social Security recipients.
3. No. It could bankrupt the Social Security system quickly, putting all retirees at risk.
4. No. Unless Congress can identify another funding source, it’s a dangerous, risky move.
5. Unsure. It’s hard to say. It would depend on what kind of proposals come forward.
