Joel Embiid (sprained left foot) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (sprained left hand) did not play for the Sixers, while Keegan Murray was sidelined for the Kings with left ankle soreness.

Sacramento trailed by 14 in the first half but tied it 57-all at halftime. Philadelphia then led 107-98 with 3:15 remaining before the Kings took over.

Fox started the surge with a short floater and assisted on a 3-pointer by Keon Ellis before DeRozan tied it on a basket with a minute left. A goaltending call against the 76ers on Monk's driving layup gave the Kings the lead with 33.1 seconds to play.

George lost the ball and fouled Monk, who hit two free throws to make it 111-107 with 7.1 seconds left.
