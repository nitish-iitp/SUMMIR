Buddy Hield (28 PTS, 7 3PM) and Lindy Waters III (21 PTS, 3 3PM) combined for 49 points and 10 3-pointers in the Warriors' 124-106 comeback victory over the New Orleans Pelicans at Chase Center on Tuesday. Hield exploded for 25 points on 8-for-10 shooting in the second half, while Waters scored 17 points over a two-quarter span, which the Warriors won by 25 points.

The Dubs had a 36-point advantage from behind the arc, sinking 21 3-pointers compared to just nine for the Pelicans. Depth and perimeter shooting have been pillars emphasized by Head Coach Steve Kerr about this group and both were on display on Tuesday, as the Warriors were without Stephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins and De'Anthony Melton. They trailed by as many as 20 points and nearly did a full-reversal, winning by 18.

WATERS SPLASHES OFF THE BENCH
Lindy Waters III turned the tide for the Warriors with long-distance splashes and used his gravity to also get easy buckets around the rim. Waters scored 17 points in his first 17 minutes of action and his third 3-pointer gave the Dubs their first lead since the game's opening minutes (69-67). Waters started the second half due to his impactful play and the Warriors scored 40 points in the third quarter, outscoring the Pelicans by a combined 25 points over the second and third quarters.

Waters also set a career-high with eight rebounds. The Warriors acquired the sharpshooting guard from the Oklahoma City Thunder this offseason and Waters considers this team the 'best possible fit' for his playstyle.

FOURTH QUARTER BUDDY BUCKETS
Buddy Hield caught fire in the fourth quarter, scoring 19 points on 6-for-8 shooting and a perfect 4-for-4 from deep. Hield has already had multiple shooting explosions in his four games as a Warrior, but this was his first at Chase Center and rocking the new Classic edition uniforms. The newly acquired sharpshooter ranks second in the league in made 3-pointers this season (20), just two shy of Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards (22).

PODZ, JK AND MOODY STEP UP
Without two of their top ball handlers and a starting two-way wing, Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody and Jonathan Kuminga all contributed to softening the blow, putting the Dubs' depth on display. Podziemski scored 19 points and dished out five assists, Moody scored 17 points and shot 5-for-6 from three and Kuminga added 17 points, including a highlight-reel transition dunk.
