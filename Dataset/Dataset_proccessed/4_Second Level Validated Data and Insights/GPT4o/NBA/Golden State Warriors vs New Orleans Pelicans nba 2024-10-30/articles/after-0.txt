WATERS PROVING HIMSELF
Lindy Waters III scored 21 points and grabbed a career-high eight rebounds in the Warriors' win over the Pelicans on Tuesday, finishing a game-best plus-26 in 31 minutes. Waters is a shooter first, something he's emphasized in his game for several years. On Tuesday night, most of his actions stemmed from his shooting threat. He sank three 3-pointers but also had two deep twos with his foot on the line and due to his defender overplaying his shot, he got two easy buckets at the rim cutting backdoor. Add in a crafty euro-step layup in transition and there's all eight of Waters' made field goals, which led all reserves. » Full Story

NEW ORLEANS SCOUTING REPORT
Zion Williamson (31) and Brandon Ingram (30) combined for 61 points in the Pelicans' loss to the Warriors on Tuesday. Williamson and Ingram made 24 of the Pelicans' 40 field goals, as the Warriors did a great job limiting shot creator CJ McCollum to five points on 2-for-8 shooting and sharpshooter Jordan Hawkins to four points on 0-for-6 shooting. Despite Daniel Theis getting the start at center, 6'11 center Yves Missi played slightly more minutes and tallied nine points, seven rebounds, three assists and two blocks.
