Behind the Numbers: Pelicans at Warriors (10/30/2024)
New Orleans tries to finish .500 on road trip in back-to-back at Golden State

A look at three key numbers related to Wednesday’s game in Chase Center between New Orleans and Golden State (9 p.m. Central, GCSEN TV, WWL radio):

14, 37, 51: Rank among all NBA players in total three-pointers made this season for CJ McCollum (who is shooting 38.2 percent from the arc), Brandon Ingram (43.5) and Jordan Hawkins (50.0), respectively. New Orleans has a trio of perimeter marksmen off to quality starts on their long-range attempts, but there’s been a major drop-off from there across the roster. As a result, the Pelicans are just 20th in three-pointers made per game (10.8), while tied for 14th in three-point percentage (35.8, compared to 38.3 last season). McCollum (13 of 34), Ingram (10 of 23) and Hawkins (9 of 18) are a combined 32 of 75 on threes, which is 43 percent, but the other Pelicans are just 11 of 45 (24 percent).

2, 2, 1: Yves Missi ranking among all NBA rookies in individual averages for scoring, rebounding and blocks. As a developing 20-year-old who averaged a modest 10.7 points during his one college season at Baylor, Missi’s early point production as a pro (8.5 per game) is perhaps the most unexpected of his statistics. The 6-foot-11 center is trailing only Washington’s Bub Carrington (8.7) among rooks in that category. Meanwhile, he’s grabbing 5.8 rebounds a game, a notch behind Washington’s Alex Sarr (6.7). Sarr and Portland’s Donovan Clingan (2.0 bpg apiece) are a fraction below first-year leader Missi (2.3 bpg) in shot-blocking average.

11: Golden State players averaging at least 6.3 points per game during the club’s 3-1 start. That level of depth and balance was evident in Tuesday’s 18-point victory over New Orleans, highlighted by reserves Lindy Waters and Jonathan Kuminga contributing 21 and 17 points, respectively. Golden State’s reserves enjoyed a 42-14 points advantage over the first three quarters, tilting the scoreboard in favor of the hosts (after a fourth quarter that partly featured mop-up minutes, the final bench margin was 54-30). The Warriors did not have Steph Curry available Tuesday due to injury, but in a surprising development, Curry has not led his club in points in any game so far, with Buddy Hield (three times) and Andrew Wiggins (Sunday vs. Clippers) holding scoring honors.

Previous Game Starting Lineups

NEW ORLEANS (2-2)

Tuesday loss at Golden State

CJ McCollum, Herb Jones, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Daniel Theis

Notes: This group is 1-2. The Pelicans won their opener vs. Chicago with Dejounte Murray at starting point guard, but he sustained a broken left hand in that victory and is sidelined. Trey Murphy (hamstring) is also out of action. … Based on NBA rules, both New Orleans and Golden State will submit their official injury report prior to today’s 1 p.m. local deadline for the second game of a back-to-back (3 p.m. Central time). Jones exited Tuesday's game in the second half due to a right shoulder injury. … Williamson (31 points) and Ingram (30 points) led New Orleans in scoring Tuesday.

GOLDEN STATE (3-1)

Tuesday win vs. New Orleans

Brandin Podziemski, Buddy Hield, Moses Moody, Draymond Green, Trayce Jackson-Davis

Notes: This group is 1-0, representing a significant change in lineup compared to the Warriors’ previous three games. Not only were Curry (peroneal) and Wiggins (back) both replaced from the starting backcourt out of necessity by Podziemski at point guard and Hield at shooting guard, but Moody made his first start of 2024-25 at small forward, taking over for Kuminga. Kuminga responded by coming off the bench and tallying a season-best 17 points. … Golden State comes to the Blender twice this season, on Nov. 22 (NBA Cup pool play) and March 28.
