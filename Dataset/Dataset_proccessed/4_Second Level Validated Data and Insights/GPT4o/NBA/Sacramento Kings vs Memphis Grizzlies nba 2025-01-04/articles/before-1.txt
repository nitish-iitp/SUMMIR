Grizzlies vs Kings final score, highlights: Jaylen Wells’ career-high 30 points not enough

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Up and down, the two high-octane offenses went.

The Memphis Grizzlies and Sacramento Kings combined for 202 points through three quarters in a battle of fast and explosive offenses.

Sacramento spent most of the night leading until two Scotty Pippen Jr. free throws gave Memphis a lead with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter.

The Kings responded with a 3-pointer, and the battle continued.

A stretch of timely shot-making from the Kings allowed them to pull away and create room. Memphis spent the last seven minutes playing from behind in a 138-133 loss at Golden 1 Center.

Malik Monk, De’Aaron Fox and DeMar DeRozan each scored more than 20 points for the Kings (16-19).

Grizzlies rookie Jaylen Wells surpassed his career high in scoring during the third quarter and finished with 30 points. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 28 points for the Grizzlies (23-12), but fouled out with 43.8 seconds left after picking up all six of his fouls in the fourth quarter.

Zach Edey, Jake LaRavia and Brandon Clarke returned on Friday after being out with injuries. Clarke started at center, while Edey and LaRavia came off the bench.

The Grizzlies have a quick turnaround before a game against the Golden State Warriors on Saturday night (7:30 p.m. CT, FanDuel Sports Network).
