LaMelo Ball fined $100K for using anti-gay language in interview after Hornets beat Bucks

Charlotte Hornets guard LaMelo Ball was fined $100,000 by the NBA for a homophobic comment during a postgame interview after the team’s game Saturday night.

Ball was being interviewed on the Hornets’ local FanDuel Sports Network television broadcast after the team’s 115-114 win over the Milwaukee Bucks (4-9) when he was asked about the team’s strategy in defending Giannis Antetokounmpo on the Bucks’ final possession.

“Yeah, we loaded up — no homo,” Ball said. “But that’s what we wanted. Put the hand up, and then live with the results.”

In a statement released Sunday, the NBA said that comment was “offensive and derogatory” when it levied the fine. Ball, 23, is in his fifth season in Charlotte (5-7) and signed a max rookie extension that kicked in this season. In 12 games this season, Ball is averaging 29.6 points, 6.3 assists and 5.3 rebounds per game.

He is the latest player to be fined by the league for making anti-gay comments. Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards was fined $40,000 in 2022 for making inappropriate statements on his Instagram account. Kevin Durant, then with the Nets, was fined $50,000 for using homophobic and misogynistic language in private messages that were then released publicly.
