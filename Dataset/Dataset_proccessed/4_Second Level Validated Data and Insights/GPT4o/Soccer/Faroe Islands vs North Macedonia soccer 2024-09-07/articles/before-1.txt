Faroe Islands and North Macedonia face off on Saturday in exciting UEFA Nations League action. Watch the game live free on Fubo.

The fourth edition of the UEFA Nations League gets underway this week, where the Faroe Islands and North Macedonia will hope to get a leg up in their efforts to gain promotion from League C this year. The two teams line up in Group 4 of the competition’s third tier and are aiming to climb after each finishing third in their respective pools in the last campaign and failing to progress on that occasion. It was only last year the two nations met for the first time, with North Macedonia hoping to repeat those friendly heroics after Bojan Miovski’s goal was all that separated the pair.

The Lynxes make their maiden visit to Torsvollur on Saturday for what could be an all-important fixture in the final context of who ascends from Group 4 come November.

Each of the other two countries in their pool – Armenia and Latvia – are newcomers to League C after they were relegated from League B and promoted from League D, respectively, last year.

That could mean mainstays North Macedonia and the Faroe Islands are well-placed to duke it out for one of the top two places, with the Group runner-up advancing to the qualification play-offs.

Saturday’s match falls almost exactly 12 months after North Macedonia last recorded a competitive win when they beat Malta 2-0 in a Euros qualifier back on September 12 of last year.

The wait has been even longer for the Faroe Islanders, however, having not collected a meaningful victory since they defeated Turkey 2-1 in the UEFA Nations League two years ago:

In fact, Hakan Ericson’s side have added only one more to the win column since then, a 4-0 friendly fleecing of Liechtenstein in March 2024.

Still, home advantage should count for something as the Scandinavian hosts look to show some defiance and give their UEFA Nations League hopes an instant boost in the bid for promotion.
