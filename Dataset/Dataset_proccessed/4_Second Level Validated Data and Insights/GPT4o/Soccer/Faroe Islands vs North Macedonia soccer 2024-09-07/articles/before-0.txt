North Macedonia

Torsvollur will host Saturday’s Nations League game between Faroe Islands and North Macedonia, the two out-of-form teams. Faroe Islands aim to put an end to their three-game losing run in all competitions and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against the Macedonians. A man to watch in the home team will be Klaemint Olsen, who has netted 10 goals in 63 appearances for the national team.

The visitors, on the other hand, are on a three-game losing run as well. As North Macedonia are likely to adopt an attack-minded approach in Saturday’s showdown, both teams to score betting option should be considered. The likes of Alioski, Churlinov, Bardhi, and Elmas are the most notable players in the visiting team. You should bear in mind that North Macedonia defeated Faroe Islands 1-0 when the two sides met in a friendly last year.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (NORTH MACEDONIA):

Former Yugoslavian republic North Macedonia became member of both FIFA and UEFA in 1994 and they have been competing on the international stage ever since. The Crveni Risovi rolled over Slovenia (4-1) in their first ever official match and the team recorded their biggest win on November 9, 11996, with the team crushing minnows Liechtenstein 11-1 in Eschen-Mauren.

The North Macedonians have yet to qualify for the finals of a major tournament despite the fact that several high-profile footballers played for the former Yugoslav republic. Goran Pandev is undisputedly the team’s most notable player as he played for the likes of Lazion, Inter, Napoli and Galatasaray during his professional career.

Pandev scored his 28th and 29th goal for North Macedonia in a 3-0 win over Belarus in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. However, Goce Seldloski is the most capped player (100). North Macedonia welcome their rivals at Philip II Arena and they wear red shirts with yellow stripe and red shorts when playing at home ground. The colour of their away kits is white.
