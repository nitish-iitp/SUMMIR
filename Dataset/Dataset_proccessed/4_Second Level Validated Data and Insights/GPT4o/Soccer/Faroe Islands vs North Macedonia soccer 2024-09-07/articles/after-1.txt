The Faroe Islands will face North Macedonia at the Tórsvøllur on Saturday in the opening game of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign. The home side enjoyed a positive Nations League campaign in 2022, shaking off their slow start to the tournament before embarking on a strong finish to their group-stage run which included a shock 2-1 victory over group winners Turkey.

They have, however, struggled for results since then, most recently suffering a 1-0 defeat to Latvia in the third-place clash of the 2024 Baltic Cup and will be looking to bounce back here.

North Macedonia have also endured a difficult run of results in recent games and will hope they can find better luck elsewhere this weekend. They were beaten 2-1 by the Czech Republic last time out and had looked set to be headed toward a draw following an Isnik Alimi second-half strike before their opponents clinched the win from the spot at the death.

The visitors will be targeting a winning start to their Nations League campaign this weekend before returning to home soil, where they will face Armenia next week.

Faroe Islands vs North Macedonia Head-to-Head and Key Numbers
Saturday's game will mark just the second meeting between the Faroe Islands and North Macedonia.
The two sides faced off for the first-ever time in a friendly clash last March which the visitors won 1-0 via a late strike from Girona striker Bojan Miovski.
The hosts have managed just two clean sheets in their last 22 games across all competitions.
The Lions were ranked 72nd in the latest FIFA rankings and now sit 66 places above their weekend opponents.
Faroe Islands vs North Macedonia Prediction

The Faroe Islands are on a three-game losing streak and have won just one of their last 16 games across all competitions. They have lost their last four games on home soil and could struggle this weekend.

North Macedonia have also lost their last three games on the bounce and are winless in their last six. They are, however, the stronger side ahead of Saturday's game and should come out on top here.

Prediction: Faroe Islands 0-2 North Macedonia

Faroe Islands vs North Macedonia Betting Tips
