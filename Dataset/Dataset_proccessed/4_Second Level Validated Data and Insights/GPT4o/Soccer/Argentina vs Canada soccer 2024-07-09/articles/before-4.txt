PREVIEW: Canada look to continue dream run at Copa América in semifinal rematch with Argentina

 Argentina vs. Canada
Copa América 2024 — Semifinal
July 9, 2024 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT
MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey

Even before Canada opened the 2024 Copa América tournament against Argentina in Atlanta just over two weeks ago, the possibility of meeting again in the semifinals seemed only possible in the wildest of dreams.

But when Canadian soccer fans wake up on Tuesday morning, that will be their reality. Canada face Lionel Messi and Argentina in the semifinal of a Copa América with a spot in the final on the line.

The group stage meeting between these two sides on June 20 ended in a 2-0 victory for Argentina, despite a strong performance from Canada. The difference in experience at this stage in the competition is significant. This a Canadian team in their first Copa América going up against an Argentina side who have reached this stage in six of the last seven tournaments — and progressed to the final five times. They’ve won this competition 15 times, including the most recent edition in 2021.

Canada, as such, will enter this match as the overwhelming underdog. But with each challenge they have faced and overcome at this competition, they gain internal belief. This won’t be the same Argentina they faced in the group stage, as only a match away from reaching another Copa América final they will be at peak intensity. But this isn’t the same Canada — either.

“[It] will have to be the best match we’ve ever played and it still might not be enough,” said Canada coach Jesse Marsch. “But, whatever. We’re going to go for it.”

It’s that sort of bravery that served Canada so well in the first meeting between the two sides, not being afraid to go toe-to-toe with Argentina for large stretches of the match. If they can dig deep and go boldly and bravely into Tuesday’s contest they have shown all the tools to give the World’s number one team a significant challenge once again.

Both Canada and Argentina come into Tuesday’s contest off the back of quarter-final victories on penalty kicks. Argentina were forced to the spot after Ecuador’s Kevin Rodríguez scored a stoppage-time equalizer in a 1-1 draw. Lionel Messi hit the bar on a Panenka with Argentina’s first penalty, but they were perfect thereafter while goalkeeper Emi Martínez continued his dominance in shootouts saving two of Ecuador’s efforts.

Canada, meanwhile, were also tied 1-1 after 90 minutes against Venezuela in their quarter-final, and after five rounds of penalty kicks. But in sudden death pens, Max Crépeau continued his tournament heroics with a save on Wilker Ángel before Ismaël Koné stepped up and won the match for Canada with a coolly taken penalty kick. Should Canada and Argentina be tied after 90 minutes again in Tuesday’s semifinal, the match will once again go directly to penalties.

Canada’s rise at this competition has been perhaps best personified by that of Jacob Shaffelburg. The 24-year-old winger from Kentville, Nova Scotia scored their goal against Venezuela, and looked their biggest threat throughout also firing two shots on target, creating a chance that Jonathan David really should have buried and consistently providing Canada a threat in behind.

Crucially, he also seems to be developing strong chemistry with Canada captain Alphonso Davies at fullback behind him. Davies’ ability to play dangerous through-balls up the wing fits perfectly into Shaffelburg’s style and will be a significant weapon for Canada in this match and beyond.

Shaffelburg was a real headache for Argentina in his half-hour cameo off the bench in the tournament opener, despite playing his off-wing. Almost certain to start on the left on Tuesday, he will again be one of Canada’s players to watch.

For Argentina, after scoring late against Canada in the tournament’s opening match as a substitute, Inter Milan’s Lautauro Martínez has taken the tournament by storm, scoring a competition-leading four goals.

On the other side of the bracket sits the only country other than Argentina to have won 15 Copa América tournaments, Uruguay, who take on 2001 Copa América champions, Colombia on Wednesday. That 2001 tournament is actually the only other Copa América for which Canada qualified but they had to withdraw after the tournament was initially cancelled due to security concerns. Argentina, coincidentally, also withdrew from that edition.

For the losing team in both of the semifinals, their tournament will not be over, but instead, they head to Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina to play in the tournament’s third-place game on Saturday, July 13. The 2024 Copa América final is the next day at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida on Sunday, July 14.

If Canada want to reach the latter match, they will need to be far more clinical than they have been so far under Marsch. The goal they scored against Venezuela was only their second of the tournament, and in six matches under Marsch, despite four big chances and 1.65 in that match.

It seems almost impossible that they get that many opportunities against an Argentina side who just allowed their first goal of the tournament in the quarter-finals. In fact, since winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Argentina have kept 14 clean sheets in 18 matches. They have failed to win just once during that stretch, a 2-0 World Cup qualifying loss to Uruguay back in November.

But the odds have been stacked against Canada since the very start at this Copa América tournament. Yet here they are, still standing as every other Concacaf country at the tournament, not to mention the likes of Brazil, have been eliminated over the past few weeks.

As Canada step onto the field on Tuesday, they will be looking to hit ‘snooze’ on the alarm clock just a little bit longer — and extend this incredible dream run at the Copa América which has inspired a nation.
