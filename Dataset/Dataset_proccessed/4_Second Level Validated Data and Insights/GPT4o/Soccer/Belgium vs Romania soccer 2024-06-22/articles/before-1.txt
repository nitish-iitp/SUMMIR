How Romania could line up against Belgium
By Ben Knapton, Senior Reporter

Romania head coach Edward Iordanescu is reportedly considering an attacking alteration for his side's second Euro 2024 Group E affair with Belgium in Cologne on Saturday.

The Tricolours produced one of the early shocks with a 3-0 beating of Ukraine in their opening contest, where no players missed out through injury or indeed picked up any issues at the Allianz Arena.

While most of Iordanescu's starters from that affair should therefore line up from the off once more, the 46-year-old is believed to be pondering a change on the left, bringing in Valentin Mihaila for Florinel Coman.

Parma's Mihaila struck three goals in qualifying for Romania, whose local media have claimed that he did not make the first XI against Ukraine due to a fever, but he is now in with a strong chance of displacing Coman in the final third.

Mihaila will no doubt line up alongside Denis Dragus - who struck the Tricolours' third on Monday - and Dennis Man, who chipped in with a pair of assists in his nation's astonishing victory.

One of those was for captain Nicolae Stanciu, having capitalised on a poor clearance from Ukraine goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, and the Romania skipper prepares to line up alongside fellow goalscorer Razvan Marin and midfield screen Marius Marin.

The headline name in the Tricolours backline, Tottenham Hotspur's Radu Dragusin forms part of the shield alongside Andrei Ratiu, Andrei Burca and Nicusor Bancu in front of 36-year-old Florin Nita.

Romania possible starting lineup:
Nita; Ratiu, Dragusin, Burca, Bancu; R. Marin, M. Marin, Stanciu; Man, Dragus, Mihaila
