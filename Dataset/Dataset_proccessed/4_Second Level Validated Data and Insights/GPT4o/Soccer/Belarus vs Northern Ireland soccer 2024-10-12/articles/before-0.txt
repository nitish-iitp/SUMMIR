Preview: Belarus vs. Northern Ireland - prediction, team news, lineups

Meeting behind closed doors on Saturday evening, Northern Ireland and Belarus resume their UEFA Nations League campaigns, separated by just one point in League C Group 3.

The teams convene at ZTE Arena in Zalaegerszeg, Hungary - where no fans will be present due to UEFA restrictions - with both vying for a top-two finish next month.

Northern Ireland began their latest Nations League campaign by beating Luxembourg 2-0 in Belfast, with early goals from Paddy McNair and Dan Ballard putting them in charge of their opening Group 3 contest.

However, Michael O'Neill's men then lost 1-0 in Bulgaria three days later, ending a positive run featuring four wins - all with clean sheets - and only one defeat, in a pre-Euros friendly against Spain.

Following a disappointing 2023, during which they lost seven of 10 fixtures and subsequently failed to make the Euro 2024 playoffs, there have been signs of progress as O'Neill introduces some fresh faces to his squad.

Northern Ireland's last outing in the Nations League resulted in a meagre tally of five points from six matches, which saw them finish third in their group; however, improving one place this season would earn a promotion playoff, while finishing first gains automatic elevation to League B.

Trailing joint-leaders Bulgaria and Belarus by one point in the table, they could quickly turn that deficit around this month: Saturday's meeting with the latter will be swiftly followed by a game against Bulgaria at Windsor Park.

Having lost three previous encounters with Northern Ireland - most recently during Euro 2020 qualifying - Belarus will be hoping to break new ground on Saturday night.

Like their next opponents, the White Wings failed to qualify for Euro 2024, though they did collect a commendable total of 12 points from 10 group matches, finishing just three points behind the playoff position.

This season, they are aiming to improve on their performance in the last Nations League, during which they failed to win any of six fixtures and finished rock bottom behind Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Slovakia.

Spanish head coach Carlos Alos, who has been in charge of the Belarusian national team since late 2023, oversaw a much more positive start to the 2024-25 edition, as his side picked up four points in September without conceding a goal.

Three days after holding Bulgaria to a 0-0 draw, Belarus saw off Luxembourg by virtue of a second-half strike from substitute Valeri Gromyko, putting them in great shape to secure a cherished top-two placing next month.

Michael O'Neill will be without injured goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell for both Nations League games, so Mansfield Town's Christy Pym has been called up as cover - the latter will vie with Luke Southwood and Pierce Charles to start on Saturday.

Meanwhile, in defence, Dan Ballard is sidelined and Manchester United's Jonny Evans recently retired from international football.

Northern Ireland's attacking options have been bolstered, though, as Jamie Reid returns after a blood clot caused the Stevenage striker to miss September's matches.

Josh Magennis is the most experienced of the four forwards selected, with 11 goals from 79 caps to date, but he has yet to score for Exeter City this season. Uncapped ADO Den Haag striker Lee Bonis netted a hat-trick for his club last week, having joined the Dutch side from Irish Premiership champions Larne during the summer.

Like Larne, Belarus champions Dinamo Minsk are representing their nation in the Conference League this season, and several of their players have been called up by Carlos Alos - most notably, goalkeeper Fyodor Lapoukhov, who should start between the posts.

Dmitri Antilevski and Yevgeni Shikavka are set to keep their places in the White Wings' front line, but fellow forward Ivan Bakhar has been ruled out by injury.

Veteran centre-back Alyaksandr Martynovich has 77 international caps to his name and will most likely feature in the middle of a three-man defence.


Belarus possible starting lineup:
Lapoukhov; Volkov, Martynovich, Zabelin; Karpovich, Yablonsky, Ebong, Pyachenin; Gromyko, Shikavka, Antilevski

Northern Ireland possible starting lineup:
Southwood; Hume, McNair, Toal, Brown, Lewis; Bradley, Saville, S. Charles, Price; D. Charles



We say: Belarus 0-0 Northern Ireland

As Northern Ireland struggle to score goals and Belarus have kept the back door firmly shut during this Nations League campaign, a goalless draw could result when they meet in Hungary.

Neither would be fully satisfied, but one point apiece keeps both teams in the hunt for promotion.
