Croatia vs Poland
UEFA Nations League
Preview
Date: Sunday, Sep 8
Kick-off Time: 6:45 pm GMT
Venue: The Opus Arena, Osijek

Croatia vs Poland is next in the UEFA Nations League A Group 1 this Sunday. The Opus Arena in Osijek will be energized to see the hosts grab all three points against the visiting Polish. In recent years, Croatia has established itself as a footballing powerhouse but the decline is getting eminent. The bar is too high for the Checkered Ones after the golden generation made qualification for major international competitions easy, but now with the team seeing new faces, the fans still expect the side to reach the semi-finals and the finals and perhaps even to win them.

However, Croatia will be determined to lift the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League, for their legend Modric. The recent 2-1 defeat to Portugal has added more pressure to win the remaining two fixtures against Poland and Scotland in Group if they at least want to end up runners-up and qualify for the quarter-finals.

On the other hand, Poland may not be riding on the same pressure of winning any major international competitions anytime soon, but they have always been a footballing nation that qualifies for the World Cups and the European Championships. Michał Probierz’s have got UEFA Nations League League A Group 1 on to a winning start edging past Scotland and winning 3-2, while matches versus Croatia and Portugal remain. Despite, Portugal being the clear favorites to win the group, and Croatia will also be in the same bracket for second place, Poland could change the story with a win on Sunday.

Croatia, looking for their first win in five games, may change their roster this weekend. After Domagoj Vida and midfielder Marcelo Brozovic retired from international action, Josip Stanisic and Martin Erlic were both ruled out of this month’s training due to injuries, while Duje Caleta-Car has been suffering with fitness.

Robert Lewandowski is leading a team without long-serving players Wojciech Szczesny and Kamil Grosicki, the latter of whom has retired from football altogether, and his injured striking partner Arkadiusz Milik. Adam Buksa is an alternate possibility, although Krzysztof Piatek, who has been playing well in the Turkish Super Lig, partnered with his captain in attack the previous game. In the absence of Szczesny’s, goalkeeper Marcin Bulka will start in goal.

Last two H2H results:

2008/06/17- Poland 0-1 Croatia

2006/06/03- Croatia 0-1 Poland

Croatia vs Poland Prediction
