CROATIA PREVIEW: CROATS STUCK IN LIMBO

Croatia appear to be embarking upon the new international cycle by sticking with the tried and tested. Luka Modric remains captain, Ivan Perisic remains vice-captain and the likes of Bruno Petkovic, Mateo Kovacic and Ante Budimir are still around the squad.

After being knocked out in the group stages of UEFA EURO 2024, Zlatko Dalic could have done with a much-improved performance the other night but they went down by two goals to one at Estadio da Luz in Lisbon against Portugal.

POLAND PREVIEW: LAST GASP POLISH VICTORY

On Thursday, Poland found themselves 2-0 up against Scotland in Glasgow with a goal from range scored by Sebastian Szymanski and then a penalty from Robert Lewandowski. Nicola Zalewski’s 97th minute penalty eventually gave them a 3-2 win after Scotland had fought back.

Poland, under the management of Michal Probierz, endured a difficult UEFA EURO 2024 campaign after only making the tournament with a penalty shootout victory over Wales at the Cardiff City Stadium in the playoffs in March.

CROATIA TEAM NEWS: CHANGE IN SYSTEM

Zlatko Dalic has been wedded to the same sort of players and sort of system, whether that be a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3, throughout his tenure as Croatia boss but he did change to a back three for the defeat in Lisbon.

PREDICTED XI (3-5-1-1): Livakovic; Sutalo, Pongracic, Gvardiol; Jakic, Modric, Kovacic, Baturina, Sosa; Pasalic; Kramaric

POLAND TEAM NEWS: FULLY FIT POLAND

Poland do appear to have a bit of a better balance for the Michal Probierz era. There are clear wing-backs such as Przemyslaw Frankowski and Nicola Zalewski with Sebastian Szymanski emerging to offer creative support to Piotr Zielinski.

PREDICTED XI (3-5-2): Bulka; Bednarek, Dawidowicz, Kiwior; Frankowski, Szymanski, Urbanski, Zielinski, Zalewski; Piatek, Lewandowski

CROATIA VS POLAND PREDICTION

There is a chance that things become quite stale with this generation of Croatian talent, despite the emergence in the last couple of years of one of the best defenders in the world in Josko Gvardiol as well as the current form of Andrej Kramaric. Poland are not a team that score three too often so their win against Scotland cannot be taken as the new look Poland, especially when it involved a goal from distance as well as two penalties. The likelihood remains a low-scoring affair.

CROATIA VS POLAND TIP: UNDER 3.5 GOALS
