And here is David Hytner’s match report from Wembley, which will serve as my parting gift. Bye!

It was a night when England wanted to impose themselves as an attacking force, after the frustration of Saturday’s 1-0 defeat here against Brazil, and they did. There was a goal for Ivan Toney on his full debut from the penalty spot and a virtuoso performance from another player making his first England start – the fearless 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo.

On this evidence, and what Mainoo has shown since breaking into the Manchester United team in November, the midfielder has made a serious case to gatecrash Gareth Southgate’s squad for the European Championship. Jarrod Bowen advanced his claim, as well.

In addition to it all, there was the fighting spirit which saw England go until the very end. It had felt as though profligacy would be their enemy and blunders within a makeshift defence, Southgate’s team conceding two completely avoidable goals.

Jude Bellingham has a chat. He says Mainoo played well but “it’s difficult - I’m speaking like the old head here but I know how hard it could be when there’s that clamour and I don’t want to add to that”, which seems very wise.

I liked the goal because I knew the rubbish we’d have got if we’d lost two games on the bounce. Really we should be winning with all the chances we made. I think it’s two games that will stand is in great stead going into the Euros. We trust everyone who comes into the squad, they’re all in the squad for good reasons. It’s hard for the gaffer, he planned a fully fit team and to give it a really good crack. I’m sure he’s glad with the players he got to see.

They’ve pulled a rabbit out of the hat! Pickford lumps the ball forward, it eventually drops to Maddison on the byline and he finds an excellent pass to pick out Bellingham, who sidefoots into the far corner!

90+5 mins: England win a free kick in their own half and have to take it quickly. Batshuayi stands in front of the ball, and is booked.

17.38 EDT

90+4 mins: England have had no trouble finding opportunities to shoot, but there has almost always been a Belgian boot in the way when they’ve done so. Faes blocks Bellingham’s effort this time.

26 Mar 2024
17.36 EDT

90+1 mins: What a chance for Belgium! Doku runs down the left, Openda distracts a couple of defenders and Lukebakio sprints into space on the right. Doku finds him, but Lukebakio shoots over the bar!

90+1 mins: Into the first of four minutes of stoppage time, which starts with Rice arguing with Onana, and Maddison getting booked for dissent.

17.34 EDT

89 mins: An excellent tackle on Doku – I’m not sure who was responsible – sends the ball to Foden, inside the area and in space, but Vertonghen turns up in time to block the shot.

17.32 EDT

87 mins: England are doing their very best to fashion a chance, but just can’t do it. Chilwell sprints with the ball towards the area, but Meunier gets across to take possession and the English left-back runs straight into him with painful results.

17.30 EDT

85 mins: An excellently entertaining jinking run from Doku helps Belgium carry the ball from 40 yards away from their own goal on the left to 40 yards away from their own goal on the right. It didn’t achieve a lot, but it was extremely stylish.

82 mins: A triple change from Belgium: Mangala, Debast and Lukaku come off, Openda, Faes and Batshuayi come on. Batshuayi has gone up a lot in my estimations since I saw him wearing a greatcoat as a cape.

80 mins: Had Bowen missed by more it might have set Bellingham up for a tap-in. Instead he goes straight off, along with Toney, while Ollie Watkins and Anthony Gordon come on.

79 mins: Ooooh! Bowen plays in Foden, running into the left of the penalty area, but his left-foot shot runs just wide of the far post.

77 mins: Several more substitutes are being readied by England, who need a bit of fresh energy and impetus.

74 mins: Mangala is played down the right, but Rice eventually get back to cut out his pass, and anyway he was miles offside. Maddison, meanwhile, comes on for Mainoo, who has been very good.

17.17 EDT

72 mins: James Maddison is getting ready to come on. “Surely the obvious counter to Belgium’s Tintin-inspired kit would be for England to turn up looking like Melchester Rovers,” suggests Kari Tulinius. “The shirt with the off-center stripe is especially fetching.” It’s yellow checked shorts or bust for me.

65 mins: England’s best chance of the half falls to Mainoo at the end of another excellent attack, but he shoots into Sels. Foden thinks he should have had a penalty in the build-up, but the referee does not and neither does the VAR. “I’m actually quite familiar with the combo of chocolate brown and sky blue as they are the colors of my alma mater, Tufts University in Medford, MA,” writes Ky Rogers, as Lukaku sends a first-time 20-yarder well over the bar. “Check out their instagram for a variety of sports uniforms in those colors. ‘Steady and true, rush along brown and blue...’” Hmmm, I saw lots of blue and lots of brown but had to look pretty hard for both at the same time.

59 mins: Gomez tracks Doku again, but that means Theate is in all sorts of space when the ball is past to him, and his low cross would have been excellent had anyone anticipated it but instead runs across goal and out the other side.

54 mins: Chance! Gomez’s cross picks out Bellingham, who is unmarked and seven yards out but heads wide.

53 mins: A lovely move from England, but they can’t create any space in the penalty area and in the end Foden’s shot is blocked.

26 Mar 2024
16.57 EDT

52 mins: Chance for England! Foden carries the ball towards the Belgian area and then passes to Toney, whose shot towards the near post is easily saved.

51 mins: It’s been a quiet opening to the second half, and almost all of it has been spent with the ball in England’s half.

England players will again wear shirts without names on the back in the second half of their friendly against Belgium on Tuesday as part of a campaign to raise awareness of dementia. The “disappearance” of the names from the first half to the second is intended to highlight how people with dementia can lose precious memories.

After Kyle Walker against Brazil, John Stones’ injury completes a bad few days for Manchester City defenders in England shirts. “First Walker, now Stones,” writes the Guardian’s own Philip Cornwall, “Guardiola will be apoPeptic”

“Is nobody going to mention Belgium’s cavalier fashion sense in mixing donkey brown and sky blue?” asks Adrian Riley. “I’m struggling to think who else has ever played in brown shorts (other than Gary Lineker in ‘90 World Cup).”

Two points here. Firstly, it’s a Tintin tribute:

Half time: England 1-2 Belgium

45+3 mins: We have had half of the time. So much to admire from England, but a couple of very poor errors in defence means they trail at the break.

26 Mar 2024
16.33 EDT

45+3 mins: Now Bowen shoots from 25 yards or so, again without enough power to trouble Sels.

Share
26 Mar 2024
16.32 EDT

45+2 mins: Bowen traps Gomez’s cross – he could perhaps have let it run to Toney – and then passes to Bellingham, who does well to turn and shoot but not well enough to get much power on it.

Share
26 Mar 2024
16.31 EDT

45+1 mins: There’ll be three minutes of stoppage time, almost all of it making up for VAR interventions.

Share
26 Mar 2024
16.29 EDT

43 mins: Gomez is tackled by Onana and goes over, and catches Onana’s head with a boot in doing so. The Belgian physios are on.

26 Mar 2024
16.27 EDT

42 mins: Sels catches the cross.

26 Mar 2024

41 mins: Onana refuses to let Mainoo get past him after being nutmegged, and England have a free-kick on the right flank in a promising crossing position.

16.24 EDT

39 mins: England are playing pretty well. The quality of players they have at their disposal these days is ridiculous, but so is the comfort with which they play international football – this is where Gareth Southgate has excelled. But the depth of talent is not the same in defence as it is in attack, and individual errors do happen. Better to get them out of their systems now rather than in the summer.
