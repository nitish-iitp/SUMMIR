Jude Bellingham's last-gasp equaliser spared England a second successive Wembley defeat after defensive errors threatened to cost them dearly in the friendly against Belgium.

Having lost at home to Brazil, Gareth Southgate's reshuffled side were a mixed bag.

They showed promise up front but vulnerability at the back, which was punished ruthlessly by Belgium before Bellingham's dramatic intervention seconds from time.

England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford made a rare error, his first to cost a goal in 60 international appearances, when his poor clearance led to Youri Tielemans putting Belgium ahead after 11 minutes.

Ivan Toney marked his first England start with the equaliser from the spot six minutes later, opening his international account after he had been brought down by veteran Jan Vertonghen.

Jarrod Bowen had a close-range header ruled out for offside, before another England error saw Belgium restore their lead nine minutes before the break.

Lewis Dunk's mistake allowed Romelu Lukaku to provide the perfect cross for Tielemans to head in at the far post.

England, with 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo making an excellent first England start, had chances of their own with Bellingham twice off target when he should have done better and Phil Foden driving across the face of goal when well placed.

Belgium keeper Matz Sels saved well from Bowen before Bellingham made amends for his earlier misses when he drove home a low finish with virtually the last kick of the game to give England a deserved draw.

FT: England 2-2 Belgium

Jude Bellingham scored his third England goal, with this his first at Wembley. He’s just the second Real Madrid player to score for the Three Lions at Wembley, along with Steve McManaman in September 1999 vs Luxembourg.
Declan Rice became the first Arsenal player to start a match as England captain since Sol Campbell in 2005 against USA, and the first at Wembley since Tony Adams in 2000 against Germany in the final game at the old Wembley.

England

England striker Ivan Toney, speaking to Sky Sports News, says: "Very special to get on the scoresheet. We would've gone in on a little downer if we had lost the game but thankfully Jude got the goal and I felt we deserved something.

"You always have to stay calm from the penalty spot, you see the goalkeeper trying to put you off but I waited.

"I hope I did [impress] and I'm always trying to work hard. I support Ollie [Watkins], it is friendly competition and I wish him all the best when he goes on the pitch. Hopefully I did well today and gave myself a chance to put myself forward for the Euros.

"When you have class players around you it is easier. It's a joy to play with these players and hopefully I can play with them a lot more."

On Kobbie Mainoo's performance: "At 18 I was probably playing on the Xbox and he is out there being a man and playing for England. He just glides with the ball and I'm sure there's more to come from him and he will go right to the top."

Belgium's ex-Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen, speaking to Sky Sports News, says: "It was a tough 90 minutes. If you are 2-1 up with the last ball of the game you have to win the game and unfortunately we didn't.

"It was open from the first minute with the big chance for [Ivan] Toney right from the start. It was two teams that wanted to play football and go forwards. There were a lot of players in our side that have played or play in the Premier League.

"It was a positive game with lots of chances for both sides and this is always a special game."

England

England's Jarrod Bowen, speaking to Sky Sports News, says: "We did leave it late and kept everyone on their toes. It shows the resilience in the squad. We would've been disappointed with two defeats from two games and that's not the standard we have set.

"Today we deserved more than a draw, but we kept fighting and got there in the end.

"Everyone played their part. Madders [substitute James Maddison] played the ball to Jude [for the equaliser] so it's not just about the starting 11. A lot of players have played [in the past two games] and everyone has looked at ease."

Belgium miss out on first away win against England

FT: England 2-2 Belgium

England remain unbeaten against Belgium on English soil, winning six and drawing two – the other game they failed to win also saw them come from 2-1 down at half-time to draw 2-2 back in 1964.
Ivan Toney is the first player to score a penalty on his first England start since Allan Clarke against Czechoslovakia at the 1970 World Cup. Toney is the first Brentford player to score for England, with the Bees the 46th different English league club to provide a scorer for the national side since the creation of the Football League in 1888.
In his 60th England cap, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford made an error leading to an opposition goal for the very first time.
Youri Tielemans became the first Belgian player to score at Wembley for both club (for Leicester City against Chelsea in the 2021 FA Cup final) and country. Tielemans was the first player to score two first half goals against England since Tranquillo Barnetta in June 2011 for Switzerland.

England

Jude Bellingham, speaking on ITV about his last-gasp equaliser, said: "I liked it. I knew the rubbish we would've got if we had lost two games on the bounce. A lot of these lads I've never played with before.

"We should be winning with all the chances we've made. But these are two games that will stand us in good stead. I know people will be negative but we have to take the positives.

"You trust everyone that comes into the squad and they are all in there because they are good players. It's hard for the gaffer, you plan these games because you expect a fit team. I'm sure the manager will be happy with how we played. You're never happy with a loss or a draw but we have to be happy with how we played."

On Kobbie Mainoo's performance: "He was good tonight. It's difficult, I'm speaking like the old head and I know there's a clamour [for him to be picked] but he is definitely a brilliant player and he will have a great future for Manchester United and hopefully for England too."

Why on earth has Jarrad Branthwaite not been given a run out tonight? Surely the perfect opportunity and been playing better this season that pretty much all the defenders we've had on the pitch. So frustrating.

Night goes on for Wales

Wales 0-0 Poland

It's been tight, it's been tense and it's been impossible to separate Wales and Poland after 90 minutes.

So we know what that means... extra-time. Possibly penalties.

Wales had the ball in the net seconds before half-time but Ben Davies' header was ruled out for an offside.

Poland also had Wojciech Szczęsny to thank for keeping out a header from Kieffer Moore early in the second half.

The visitors have not offered too much at the other end but there is always a danger when Robert Lewandowski is about, with the Barcelona striker nearly breaking Welsh hearts at the end of normal time with a shot which fizzed wide.

On we go! Follow all the action from Cardiff here.

Ukraine 2-1 Iceland

With his nation still under attack from Russia, Ukraine coach Serhiy Rebrov said reaching the Euro 2024 finals would bring "a bit of happiness" in the difficult circumstances.

Rebrov's side have booked their place at the finals in Germany next summer, thanks to a second-half turnaround in their play-off against Iceland.

Iceland led 1-0 at half-time after Albert Gudmundsson's stunner, but Ukraine - playing their 'home' tie in Polish city Wroclaw - fought back to win through Viktor Tsyhankov and Mykhailo Mudryk.

Ukraine will go into Group E, alongside Belgium, Slovakia and Romania.

Jude Bellingham

England snatch a draw in the fourth minute of injury time. All credit to substitute James Maddison as he creates the chance on the left side of the penalty area, his cross whips off a Belgian arm and it would've been a good shout for a penalty.

But play-on is the call and it falls to Jude Bellingham 10 yards out and he strokes the finish past Matz Sels to make it 2-2 in dramatic style.
