Goodnight all!

What a night of drama!

I'm starting to get out of breath, it was a night that had it all, and it seems to have taken it out of me. Maybe I need to start going to the gym...

Jude Bellingham came to the rescue for England in the last minute of stoppage-time to earn Gareth Southgate's side a 2-2 draw against Belgium.

Kobbie Mainoo was the star of the show on his first start at just 18 years old, while Ivan Toney did his Euro 2024 hopes no damage with a fine display that included a goal from the penalty spot - his first for his country,

However, there is no possibility of England facing Wales in an international tournament this year as Poland dumped out Rob Page's side via a penalty shootout in Cardiff.

It was a devastating way to lose a European Championships play-off match, but for Poland, their delight will be there for all to see for a long time.

That's it now for international football until June, now it's time to turn our focus back onto the domestic leagues. Just two months to go until we find out our winners and losers all around the world.

Thank you for following along with me, I will see you on the flip side!

23:00
First Wembley goal for golden boy Bellingham

When I watch Jude Bellingham play, it feels like he has been around for years.

Now that Kobbi Mainoo has arrived, it's easy to forget that Bellingham is still only 20 years old.

The Real Madrid player plays with maturity far beyond his years, and tonight his last-minute equaliser showed how imperative he is to the team.

It was actually his first goal at Wembley, his other two for England have been away from home against Scotland and Iran.

I'm sure there will be plenty more where that came from.

22:55
SOFASCORE STATS: England 2-2 Belgium

Earlier I said that a draw was a fair result, now I am starting to think I was wrong...

These stats show how dominant England were tonight, but their defensive frailties let them down.

Their problems at the back are becoming a real worry.

22:51
Mainoo now a mainstay?

Well, before that whirlwind of a 45 minutes in Cardiff, England grabbed a draw from the clutches of defeat at Wembley against Belgium.

I couldn't leave tonight without touching more on Kobbie Mainoo's performance. What can I say, he was simply brilliant.

I think the 18-year-old could have a strong case to start at the Euros in the summer.

He gets better and better every time I watch him - simply sensational.

22:46
What could have been

For just one moment, Wales and their fans believed they had gone 1-0 up before half-time.

However, Ben Davies was deemed to be offside as Kieffer Moor headed the ball across to him - rightfully so.

Football has its highs and lows, fans emotions are thrown all over the place. Unfortunately for Wales, theirs are in the dumps at the moment.

22:41
Joe Allen: 'Such a cruel way to end a game'

Joe Allen, ex-Wales midfielder, speaking on Sgorio:

Such a cruel way to end a game, so sad for Dan James.It's disappointing not to go to Germany but I'm so proud of the boys in what they've done over the last two years.
The future is a bright one for Wales, after this summer focus will turn to the World Cup campaign.
22:37
Wales fans stay with players

The Wales fans aren't leaving, even if they are devastated.

They sing once again to console their side, they will be back in the future, and the fans know that.

Football is just beautiful at times, whoever you support.

22:33
Poland perfect from the spot

When it mattered at the end, Poland were perfect. Nearly all the spot-kicks were expertly taken, and all went in.

Robert Lewandowski will be leading his country at another major tournament, they are off to Germany!

22:31
Wales fall at the final hurdle

Dan James slumps, the stadium falls silent, and Poland celebrate like crazy.

That is devastating. I just had a feeling he would miss, I don't know why, I just did.

This will take some time for Wales to recover from.

22:29
POLAND QUALIFY FOR EURO 2024! PENS: Wales 4-5 Poland

Dan James is up, he has to score.

But he doesn't - Wales are out.

22:28
PENS: Wales 4-5 Poland

Now it's sudden death.

Piatek is up for Poland and he scores. That's five out of five.

22:27
PENS: Wales 4-4 Poland

What a great penalty from Neco Williams, it's 4-4.

22:26
PENS: Wales 3-4 Poland

Ward goes the right way but Zalewski's power is too much for him.

22:26
PENS: Wales 3-3 Poland

Harry Wilson steps up for Wales... and he scores, just about.

Another penalty that goes straight down the middle.

22:25
PENS: Wales 2-3 Poland

Poland are not messing around, Frankowski slams it home.

22:24
PENS: Wales 2-2 Poland

Oh my word, Kieffer Moore just about squeezes it in via the crossbar.

22:23
PENS: Wales 1-2 Poland

Szymanski is next and he also scores.

Not the most convincing penalty but it flies past Danny Ward, that's all that matters.

22:22
PENS: Wales 1-1 Poland

Ben Davies is up for Wales... he scores.

Both captains find the back of the net.

22:22
PENS: Wales 0-1 Poland

Robert Lewandowski is up first, you expect him to score - he usually does...

And, he does. He cooly slots it home after a stutter.

22:20
'Land of My Fathers' rings around Cardiff City Stadium

The hairs are standing up on the back of my neck.

'Land of My Fathers' is being pelted out by the Wales fans, it is truly inspirational. When they sing it, everybody listens.

Can it inspire their team to victory?

22:17
PENALTIES! Wales 0-0 Poland

There goes the whistle!

A penalty shoot-out it is, after 120 minutes of a tight and tense affair at the Cardiff City Stadium.

It's the best way to win, but the worst way to lose. Who will be heading to Germany?

22:17
RED CARD: Wales 0-0 Poland (Mepham)

Right at the end, Chris Mepham is shown a second yellow card.

Both have come in extra time, but it looks as though the red card is so late it won't matter.

22:15,
120'
ONE added minute

It looks like it's going to be penalties, we are just 60 seconds from them.

Or can someone pop up with a goal?

22:12,
117'
Wales 0-0 Poland

This is so, so tense.

Every time the ball is launched into the Wales area during a Poland attack, the whole stadium holds its breath.

Luckily for them, none of the warnings have come to fruition - it's been one of those games.

22:09,
113'
SUBSTITUTION: Wales 0-0 Poland

Hmmmm...

Substitute David Brooks is coming off, he only came on in the 84th minute and looked like the freshest player on the pitch - surely it's an injury?

Nathan Broadhead comes on, maybe he is an expert penalty taker, but we aren't there yet...

22:07,
112'
Wales 0-0 Poland

Not much doing here for either side.

It feels like it's a match destined for penalties, both teams look like they want them.

Watch me eat my words...

22:00,
106'
EXTRA-TIME SECOND HALF: Wales 0-0 Poland

'Land of My Fathers' is belted out around the stadium, Cardiff is willing Wales on.

Surely that could give them the extra ounce of energy they need, it is such a special song.

Wales will need every song and cheer they can in these next 15 minutes.

21:58
EXTRA-TIME HALF-TIME: Wales 0-0 Poland

Still no goals in this one.

Wales dominated that period of play, but it has to be said, they do look very tired.

It has a feel of a dangerous counter-attack from Poland breaking Wales' hearts - it nearly happened through Jakub Piotrowski.

15 more minutes, and then potential penalties!

21:56,
103'
Wales 0-0 Poland

Kieffer Moore should be doing better there.

The Ipswich striker pounces on a mishap at the back from Poland, but his effort dribbles into Wojciech Szczesny's hands.

Moore looked gassed, he could barely run...

21:54,
100'
CHANCE! Wales 0-0 Poland

Poland come very close through Jakub Piotrowski.

It's been Welsh dominance, but they get hit on the counter-attack and Piotrowski bends an effort just inches wide.

That would have been a heartbreaker, but it also would have been a fantastic goal.

However, neither point stands as it went wide.

21:51,
98'
YELLOW CARD: Wales 0-0 Poland (Mepham)

Yellow card for Chris Mepham and he can have no complaints, he stops a Poland counter-attack.

It's all Wales though, really, they just can't find a decent opening yet!

21:44,
91'
EXTRA-TIME: Wales 0-0 Poland

Can Wales get it done with an extra thirty minutes?

I'm sure Poland will have something to say about it, let's see!

21:40
FULL-TIME: England 2-2 Belgium

It is the last kick of the game.

Belgium still don't get their win in England and it's because of Jude Bellingham that they haven't.

A draw is probably a fair result in the end, but it looks like Lukebakio's stoppage-time miss proved costly in the end for the visitors.

Gareth Southgate will be happy that they managed to evade two losses in a row, but he will be more pleased with some of the individual performances.

Both Ivan Toney and Kobbie Mainoo showed why they deserved their starts, they were brilliant.

Now we wait until June, over to Cardiff we go!

21:39
GOAL: ENGLAND 2-2 Belgium (Bellingham 90+5')

Bellingham with the last kick of the game!

I said he'd been giving it his all, and with his third England goal he has saved them from the clutches of defeat at the death.

James Maddison plays a wonderful cutback into Bellingham who fires it low into the corner.

The let-off inside Wembley is huge - it doesn't feel like a friendly going by that celebration.

21:39
FULL-TIME: Wales 0-0 Poland

Extra-time it is...

The teams can't be separated in this tense affair, and now we have 30 more minutes and the possibility of penalties.

This is so tense!

21:38,
94'
England 1-2 Belgium

Jude Bellingham has tried his best tonight, but just can't find the back of the net.

He has a go inside the box and forces a corner from his effort, but once again the delivery is poor and it comes to nothing.

That could be that.

21:37,
92'
England 1-2 Belgium

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

If this is to be a defeat for England then it will be an unjust and careless one.
Southgate’s teams have created problems for themselves at the back but have created more than enough chances to win this game.
21:36,
91'
FOUR added minutes

England have four minutes to find an equaliser.

However, moments after the board goes up Dodi Lukebakio comes very close to sealing the win, but his strike goes over.

21:34,
90'
England 1-2 Belgium

It's not been a classic Phil Foden performance, if I'm honest.

He can't find an England shirt in the middle as he tries to drag the ball back into the area. Instead, it gets blocked.

We are closing in on stoppage-time now.

21:30,
86'
England 1-2 Belgium

The substitutions have sucked the life out of the game, it all feels rather flat now.

It looks like England are set to lose two games in a row at Wembley after 20 in a row unbeaten before.

Unless someone pops up with a bit of magic.

21:29,
83'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-2 Belgium

A triple change for Belgium.

One of the three coming on is Michy Batshuayi, former Chelsea striker, he comes on for Romelu Lukaku,

Wout Faes and Lois Openda also come onto the pitch.

21:27,
80'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-2 Belgium

That was Jarrod Bowen's last action of the night - he doesn't get his goal in the end.

Both Bowen and goalscorer Ivan Toney come off for Anthony Gordon and Ollie Watkins.

Toney has put in a performance worthy of being rewarded with a ticket to Germany in the summer, what do you all think?

21:25,
80'
GOOD CHANCE! England 1-2 Belgium

So, so, close to an equaliser.

Phil Foden drags his shot wide from the lefthand side of the area after some brilliant football from Jarrod Bowen.

It was a typical Phil Foden chance, you expected him to put it away - he should have.

Time is running out...

21:21,
78'
Wales 0-0 Poland

Still no goals in this one.

Both sides have had their chances but it looks like Poland are the more threatening at the moment.

It's very nervy in Cardiff at the moment, can they find a winner?

21:19,
74'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-2 Belgium

Just as I say that...

Kobbie Mainoo is coming off, and what a performance he has put in. He has done his Euro 2024 chances a world of good tonight.

James Maddison is coming on for him, it's a big chance for him to do something, but he only has 15 minutes, or so, to do it.

21:17,
71'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-2 Belgium

Youri Tielemans night is done, and it has been a really impressive performance from him. He hadn't scored for 15 games internationally before his brace tonight.

Aster Vranckx comes on in his place as does Thomas Meunier fro Arthur Theate.

No signs of movement from the England bench just yet.

21:14,
67'
YELLOW CARD: England 1-2 Belgium (Gomez)

Joe Gomez is the first player in the book after one too many challenges.

It's a cynical foul as he stops Jeremy Doku on the counter-attack.

21:12,
66'
England 1-2 Belgium

So close from Kobbie Mainoo!

Firstly, Phil Foden goes down and he believes he should have a penalty. Play then goes on and Jude Bellingham fires it across the area before it lands at the feet of Mainoo.

The midfielder gets a good strike away, but it's brilliantly smothered by Matz Sels, he is keeping Belgium in front at the moment.

that would have capped a brilliant performance from the youngster.

21:10,
65'
England 1-2 Belgium

A hard chance for Romelu Lukaku and he fires it over the bar.

It went absolutely miles over, it did bobble in front of him in all fairness.

21:08,
63'
BIG CHANCE! England 1-2 Belgium

It's just not Jarrod Bowen's day so far.

It's some more top football from England as the ball is worked out wide to Joe Gomez before he cuts it back to Bowen.

The West Ham forward manages to get a strong first-time effort off just inside the six-yard box, but it's well saved by Matz Sels.

Surely a goal is coming? I've probably jinxed it again.

21:06,
60'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-2 Belgium

A first change for Belgium.

Leandro Troassard is the man coming off and in his place comes Dodi Lukebakio.

I must admit, I didn't hear Trossard's name very often, he is usually a live wire, but not tonight.

21:04,
59'
England 1-2 Belgium

Sami Mokbel, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

I like Kobbie Mainoo’s composure, the way he isn’t in a rush to move possession on when he has the ball. It’s risky, but he has the skill set to release in tight spaces. Jarrod Bowen has done his chances of making the squad no harm either.
21:02,
58'
England 1-2 Belgium

Joe Gomez does well to only give away a corner.

Jeremy Doku twists and turns as he usually does inside the area, but the Liverpool defender is having none of it and puts it behind.

Nothing comes from the corner.

21:01,
57'
England 1-2 Belgium

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

This is the Belgium version of Romelu Lukaku that we are seeing here, rather than the one who ultimately flattered to deceive in the Premier League with Manchester United and Chelsea.
Lukaku is 30 now but always looks about five years younger, quicker and more alert when he plays for his country. Lukaku has been impressive from the start here.
20:59,
54'
England 1-2 Belgium

More good football from England.

It's a brilliant cross from Joe Gomez to find Jude Bellingham, but the Real Madrid midfielder's header bounces wide.

Could he have done better there?

20:57,
53'
England 1-2 Belgium

Strong save from Matz Sels to deny Ivan Toney his second of the match.

Toney is always getting involved and this time he is fed down the right side of the box and tries to sneak one inside the near post, but it's a good save.

England have started the second half the better team again.

20:50,
46'
SECOND HALF!

The second 45 minutes are back underway in both England and Wales.

What do we think will happen then, will England comeback or can Belgium hold on?

And can Wales seal qualification for Euro 2024?

Let's find out!

20:48
'Lewis Dunk is struggling at this level'

Oliver Holt, Mail Sport's Chief Sports Writer, at Wembley Stadium:

A breathless first half had so much to admire from both sides going forward but a lot for England to fret about at the back. There is some evidence to suggest that Lewis Dunk is struggling at this level and he was at fault for Belgium's second goal when he did not have the strength or the conviction to prevent the ball reaching Romelu Lukaku.
Those who condemn Southgate for caution when he shields England's defence with two holding midfielders may be starting to realise why he does it.
20:47
'Mainoo and Toney very good'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, is also very impressed with Kobbie Mainoo in the middle of the park.

I agree that Ivan Toney has also been impressive.

20:45
Impressive Mainoo

We wondered how Kobbie Mainoo would fare, well, he has answered very clearly - very well.

At 18 years of age the Manchester United midfielder is one of the coolest men, or boys shall I say, in the stadium.

His passing, movement, and link-up play are all excellent. One of the best players on the pitch.

20:42
'Davies was offside – marginally, yes, but offside'

Tom Collomosse, Mail Sport, at the Cardiff City Stadium:

Great example there of how VAR *should* work. Davies was offside – marginally, yes, but offside. Flag goes up, quick check to confirm linesman’s call, job done. Shouldn’t be too hard, should it?
20:35
HALF-TIME: England 1-2 Belgium

This has been a very entertaining game.

If I was putting it briefly, England have dominated, but gifted Belgium two opportunities to the visitors which they took with aplomb.

First, it was Jordan Pickford who made a mistake before Youri Tielemans calmly dragged it back across the England keeper.

Ivan Toney then got his first goal for the Three Lions from the spot, before Jarrod Bowen thought he had too with a header- but it was ruled out for offside.

Then after controlling the game, Tielemans put Belgium back in front with a wonderful header from a stunning Romelu Lukaku cross.

England have lots they can be happy about, but they are behind at Wembley.

20:35
HALF-TIME: Wales 0-0 Poland

Well, 0-0 it is.

It has been a tense affair, you can see how much is on the line by how the two teams are playing.

Wales thought they were leading, but the offside flag ruined Ben Davies' celebrations.

It's a shame for them, but will give them confidence going into the second half.

20:34,
47'
England 1-2 Belgium

A couple of shots from distance from England through Jude Bellingham and Jarrod Bowen, but nothing doing.

They have looked a little flat since going 2-1 behind, they need to get back upbeat again.

20:31,
45'
GOAL DISALLOWED! Wales 0-0 Poland (Davies)

Ben Davies thinks he has put Wales in front, the Cardiff City Stadium goes bananas, but he is ruled offside.

I originally thought he was onside as Kieffer Moore headed it back across goal for him to nod home, but upon reflection it was offside - even if it was tight.

Either way, that let-off was huge!

20:30
THREE added minutes

Three minutes for England to find a goal before half-time.

20:28,
42'
England 1-2 Belgium

Wembley is very flat now, you can only hear the Belgium fans at the moment.

Although England may be behind on the scoreline, they have still put in a very strong performance.

They just need to keep going and I can see them getting back in this game once again.

20:26,
40'
England 1-2 Belgium

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium

That is one of the best goals I've ever seen live at Wembley. Tielemans has been outstanding so far.

That's a huge statement Craig - it was a very good goal!

20:21,
36'
GOAL!!! England 1-2 Belgium (Tielemans 36')

Belgium lead again.

Two mistakes, two goals, and it's Youri Tielemans again. Lewis Dunk overshoots a sliding tackle to let Romelu Lukaku in, but wow, what a cross from the on-loan Roma striker.

He whips in a stunning ball and Tielemans dives like his life depends on it to head home at the back post.

England have been brilliant, but their mistakes are costing them. That said, it was a beautiful goal.

20:20,
32'
England 1-1 Belgium

It doesn't look like he will give up on getting that first goal though, Craig.

Jarrod Bowen has a go again, but it flies over the bar. I feel he will get his goal today if he continues the way he is playing.

Going by this performance, he strongly staking a claim for a spot on the plane!

20:18,
31'
England 1-1 Belgium

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium

That's a big thing to have taken away from you, your first England goal, and at Wembley. It's not like it was the fifth in a routine home win over Burnley.
20:13,
29'
GOAL DISALLOWED! England 1-1 Belgium

There we go, it has been chalked off.

That is a huge shame for Jarrod Bowen, he looked absolutely delighted.

The fact of the matter is that he was clearly offside as Lewis Dunk headed the ball back across the area.

Either way, it's been a really positive response from England to going behind.

20:12,
27'
GOAL!!! England 2-1 Belgium (Bowen 27')

Jarrod Bowen scores his first England goal!

Or has he, this looks like it's going to be chalked off, there is a VAR check for offside ongoing.

He does look offside to me.

20:11,
26'
England 1-1 Belgium

Very nearly an own goal.

In the end, you have to say, it's a brilliant bit of defending to clear it over the bar by Zeno Debast!

It was a brilliant bit of play from England and Jude Bellingham though.

20:07,
21'
STRONG SAVE! England 1-1 Belgium

Big save from Jordan Pickford.

After some poor football with his feet, he shows why he is England number one.

He strongly palms away Jeremy Doku's stinging strike, it really looked like it was moving.

England then launch a counter-attack only moments later, with Kobbie Mainoo heavily involved again, but Jude Bellingham's strike at the end is blocked.

A great game, this!

20:04,
19'
England 1-1 Belgium

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium

That came from Mainoo's positive turn in the middle of the park. He's made a good start, the teenager.
20:02,
17'
GOAL!!! England 1-1 Belgium (Toney 17')

He can!

Ivan Toney never misses, does he? Well, he hasn't this time, after a little stutter he cooly slots it into the bottom lefthand corner.

What a moment that is for the Brentford striker on his full England debut, especially after the year he has had.

Jordan Pickford will be relieved, parity is restored.

20:00,
16'
PENALTY TO ENGLAND!

That's a stonewall penalty.

It's Ivan Toney who is fed through and taken out by Jan Vertonghen, it doesn't get much clearer than that.

Now, can Toney score on his full England debut from the spot?

20:00,
14'
England 0-1 Belgium

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium

Just as well for Jordan Pickford there is no real alternative in goal...
19:56,
11'
GOAL!!! England 0-1 Belgium (Tielemans 11')

Oh dear, oh dear...

That is an absolute gift. That is a poor error from Jordan Pickford, he tries a drilled pass from the back while wide of his goal - it doesn't work.

The ball bounces straight off Amadou Onana to Youri Tielemans, who drags the ball back across Pickford as he is sprinting across goal.

Not the start, England wanted - couldn't have gone much worse.

19:55,
10'
SUBSTITUTION: England 0-0 Belgium

Oh no!

It looks like there is another injury amongst the England ranks, and it's John Stones. He slipped on the retreat and must have felt something.

Joe Gomez is coming on in his place, no chances being taken. It took just nine minutes for a player to get injured.

This is bad news for Manchester City too...

19:52,
7'
England 0-0 Belgium

After a couple of early openings, this game has substantially calmed down.

England have to make sure they don't sink into the pattern that they did on Saturday.

Otherwise, it could be another night of disappointment.

19:49,
3'
England 0-0 Belgium

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

This will be another interesting test for England given the numbers of players absent through injury.
Squads rather than teams tend to win major tournaments and it’s across the back that England look a little light.

England 0-0 Belgium

What a start that would have been.

Jarrod Bowen pings a cross into Ivan Toney, but he volley hits his own arm!

A very bright start.

KICK-OFF

Here we go, we are underway in both London and Cardiff.

For England, it's a chance to show everybody they are still the favourites for Euro 2024, meanwhile, Wales need to win tonight to get there.

What a night we have in store!

19:43
Here come England!

Declan Rice leads England out onto the pitch, what a moment for him.

And here are the national anthems. I said it on Saturday, and I'll say it again, I always love this part.

We are just moments away from kick-off!

19:40
Strong police presence in Cardiff

Ian Herbert, Mail Sport, at the Cardiff City Stadium:

There’s police presence outside the Cardiff City Stadium tonight, with South Wales Police on alert for ticketless Polish fans.
A big British Polish contingent here and from I’ve seen all in good spirits so far
19:38
'It feels like Anthony Gordon and Jarrod Bowen are playing for one place'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium

It feels like Anthony Gordon and Jarrod Bowen are playing for one place in the squad. The former did very well against Brazil on Saturday but Bowen also impressed when he came on. It is the turn of the West Ham winger to shine tonight.
I think this call is 60-40 in Gordon's favour at present, as much because of his defensive work - and England have a potential weakness at left back. But a goal for Bowen here might just swing things in his favour.

19:34
Big chance for Konsa

There was a time when England could have filled a full team with right-backs.

Well, now they are starting a centre-back in that position.

Due to all the injuries, Ezri Konsa's versatility was used on Saturday as he came on against Brazil, and is being used today from the start.

It will stand him in good stead for selection, it's always handy to have someone who can play in multiple positions.

Let's see how he does then, eh?

19:28
'Neither Cardiff nor Swansea represented in Rob Page’s side'

Tom Collomosse, Mail Sport, at the Cardiff City Stadium:

Four Leeds players, two from Tottenham, yet not a single one in the Wales starting XI from either of the country’s two biggest clubs.
With Aaron Ramsey on the bench, neither Cardiff nor Swansea are represented in Rob Page’s side for their most significant fixture since the 2022 World Cup.This says less about the big two in Wales than it does about the strength now available to Page.
19:23
First of many for Mainoo?

As Mail Sport predicted, Kobbie Mainoo gets his first start for England tonight.

After not originally being called up for the squad for this round of fixtures, it's very impressive he has forced his way into the side.

His ceiling is undoubtedly extremely high, and tonight could be the first start in a long international career.

He certainly looks happy!

19:14
Three Lions getting ready to go

Warm-ups have begun at Wembley.

It is sure to be a very important few hours for all of the players on that pitch right now, and even some that aren't on it.

I wonder if any nerves are jangling?

19:10
How will Poland's managerial merry-go-round affect them?

Tom Collomosse, Mail Sport, at the Cardiff City Stadium:

Poland are rapidly developing a reputation as the Watford of international football, with current boss Michal Probierz the fourth man in the hotseat since Jerzy Brzeczek departed in January 2021.

19:03
High spirits in the Wales camp

It doesn't look like these lads are feeling the pressure.

If they can handle it like it looks like they will from these photos, it could be a great night for Wales.

18:59
Should Toney have a place on the plane?

As you can see, the question over if Ivan Toney should be in the Euro 2024 squad this summer is doing the rounds.

I want to know what you all think, should Toney be there in Germany come June?

Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

18:55
'Interesting to see how Toney leads the line'

Sami Mokbel, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

The England starting XI is out and it’s as predicted by Mail Online last night and the Daily Mail this morning. That means full debuts for Ivan Toney, Kobbie Mainoo and Ezri Konsa.
What an opportunity for the trio to gatecrash the Euro 2024 squad. Particularly interesting to see how Toney leads the line. A good performance tonight and surely he’s on the plane.
18:53
'This feels like a make-or-break night for Ivan Toney's Euros hopes'

Oliver Holt, Mail Sport's Chief Sports Writer, at Wembley Stadium:

This feels like a make-or-break night for Ivan Toney's hopes of being included in Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024. The consensus is that only one of Toney and Ollie Watkins will go to Germany, effectively as Harry Kane's understudy.
After Watkins struggled to make an impression in a flat team performance against Brazil, this is Toney's big opportunity.
18:50
Injuries birth new opportunities

As Gareth Southgate has said, England have an ‘incredible number’ of players unavailable through injury.

The Three Lions are missing the likes of Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, Harry Maguire and Kyle Walker, who are all more than likely to be starters if fit in the summer.

Southgate is also without the talent of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Luke Shaw, and Sam Johnstone, so more and more new players are getting their chances - as seen with the five changes tonight.

Kobbie Mainoo and Ivan Toney are getting their go tonight, but so is Ezri Konsa who also makes his full debut.

It’s a big chance for non-regulars to stake their place for a spot on the plane to Germany.

18:44
Toney’s big audition

This could turn out to be a massive night for Ivan Toney’s England career.

Toney missed out on the World Cup in Qatar, and not long after served an eight-month suspension for breaking betting rules.

The Brentford striker has only has one cap for the Three Lions to his name, which came a year ago against Ukraine, and this will be his first start in England colours.

There are many questions over who should play Harry Kane’s understudy at Euro 2023, with the fight seemingly between Ollie Watkins and Toney.

So, can he grab the opportunity with both hands tonight?

18:41
Poland Team News - Lewandowski up top

We wouldn't expect anything else, would we?

Robert Lewandowski, the main man for Poland, captains the side, as Jakub Kiwior, Arsenal defender, also starts for Poland.

This team will be looking to ignore the atmosphere tonight and break Wales' hearts.

18:40
Wales Line-up - Moore STARTS

Some big team news for Wales, Kieffer Moore comes into the side replacing David Brooks.

Aaron Ramsey does make the squad, but is not fit enough to play from the start.

Robert Page was obviously happy with his team from Saturday, with Moore being the only change.

18:37
Belgium Starting XI - Captain Lukaku

Plenty of Premier League names to look out for in this side.

Domenico Tedesco has made seven changes to the side that drew 0-0 to Ireland, with Romelu Lukaku coming in to captain the side.

Can this team do damage to England?

18:36
England Team News - Mainoo STARTS

There it is, confirmation that both Kobbie Mainoo and Ivan Toney will make their first starts for England tonight.

Ezri Konsa, Lewis Dunk, and Jarrod Bowen, follow them into the line-up as Gareth Southgate makes five changes from the side that lost to Brazil on Saturday.

A big night in store!

18:34
Wales’ thumping semi-final victory

Let's look at how Wales made it to the play-off finals then.

It was a fairly easy night in Cardiff on Saturday as Wales swept aside Finland 4-1.

David Brooks and Neco Williams put Wales two goals to the good before Teemu Pukki pulled one back for the visitors on the stroke of half-time.

However, it took just 90 seconds into the second period for Wales to restore their two-goal lead through Brennan Johnson.

Dan James then sealed a magical night for the Welsh off the bench.

Surely, that will give them huge confidence going into tonight, they are just one step away from Euro 2024.

18:28
The Three Lions’ bogey team

When I think of England facing Belgium, I don’t normally think of victory for the Three Lions.

Historically England have a very good record against Belgium, winning 16 of their 25 meetings, however, they have not fared so well in recent times losing three of the last four of them.

The one anomaly from the last four came in October 2020, as they came out 2-1 at Wembley. Although, those two goals are the only ones England have scored in their last four meetings with Belgium.

Not great stats I must say…

18:23
England are in the building

So, we know Kobbie Mainoo and Ivan Toney are set to start tonight, but who else are we likely to see?

I suspect Gareth Southgate will put out a very strong 11, it's their last chance to show what they've got before June!

18:16
No names on England kit in second half

England will arise from the tunnel after half-time with no names on the back of their shirts.

What is the reason for this? Well, it is for a great cause. Tonight’s match is devoted to Alzheimer's Society because of the charity’s partnership with the Football Association.

This is the second occasion England have decided to do this and the reason behind the nameless shirts is to bring ‘attention to how people with dementia lose precious memories’ including forgetting their favourite football players' names.

The shirts in question will be the new England away strip, which is being played in for the first time.

18:14
Mainoo and Toney in line to start

I mentioned earlier that there would be some possible changes, and there are two that stand out.

It has been reported by Sami Mokbel, Mail Sport, that both Kobbie Mainoo and Ivan Toney are set to be given their chance from the start tonight.

18-year-old Mainoo made his international debut in the loss to Brazil with a short cameo from the bench, but now is a chance to see what he can do in a Three Lins shirt.

Toney did not come on against Brazil, but after Ollie Watkins failed to make an impression, he is set to be given a chance to stake his claim for a Euro 2024 spot.

It’s exciting times for England that with all the absentees at the moment, they can still bring in two players of real quality into the fold.

It’s a huge opportunity for both of them.

18:09
What Wales and Poland are fighting for

While tonight is huge for both Wales and Poland, it could only be the start of a very tough run in the Euros this summer.

Whoever does get through tonight will not have it easy in Germany. The winner of tonight’s match will end up in group D, and these are the sides they are fighting to face:

France
Netherlands
Austria

Can Wales fill that spot?

18:07
Declan Rice set to captain England for 50th Cap

Life really moves fast, doesn’t it?

It feels like just yesterday Declan Rice was given his first England call-up, snubbing Ireland in the process after making three caps in green (sorry to bring that up Ireland fans).

However, that is now five years in the past and Rice is set to step out onto the grass in England colours for the 50th time. To make things even more special, it has already been confirmed he will be captain in the absence of Harry Kane.

It’s fair to say the Arsenal midfielder is over the moon about it all, in the pre-match press conference, he said:

On my 50th cap, to walk out at Wembley in front of my family and friends, it is a great honour - I'm a bit speechless.
It is a pinch-me moment, it will be an honour. I was absolutely lost for words when [Gareth Southgate] said to me I was going to be captain.

18:03
The stage is set in Cardiff

The moment ‘Land of My Fathers’ begins at the Cardiff City Stadium tonight; the Wales players will feel the unwavering support of their fans in a way that not many will have felt before.

After moving on from the likes of Gareth Bale and Joe Allen, the new generation of Wales players are looking to ensure their country reaches a third European Championships in a row.

Standing in their way, Poland, who with Robert Lewandowski leading the line can cause anybody problems.

I remember the atmosphere when Wales beat Ukraine in 2022 to seal their place at the Qatar World Cup later in the same year, and if tonight is anything like that, we are in for one hell of a match.

Get your seatbelts at the ready, it’s going to be a crazy ride.

18:01
Can England bounce back?

England’s build-up to the European Championships this summer did not get off to the best start on Saturday.

The Three Lions, who are arguably favourites for the competition in Germany, got a slap of reality when Endrick netted an 80th-minute winner for Brazil to end England’s 20-match Wembley unbeaten streak.

Well, tonight they return to the national stadium to face off against Belgium in their final match until June.

Facing the Red Devils has not always brought the fondest of memories for England in recent years, but this evening is a chance for Gareth Southgate’s injury-hit side to show that they are still a force to be reckoned with.

Last time out, I predicted lots of goals and we got one, so maybe I should keep my lips sealed tonight…

18:00
Good evening!

Welcome, or croeso for our Welsh fans following along.

We have a huge night of international football in store for you, and it is the last one until Euro 2024 preparations come to a head in June.

Gareth Southgate is set to make some big changes as England seek to recover from Saturday’s loss to Brazil with victory over Belgium.

Meanwhile, Wales have a mammoth day in store as they face Poland in the Euro 2024 play-off finals tonight for a spot in Germany this summer.

With it being such a massive day for some of our home nations, we will keep you up to date with the ongoings in both London and Cardiff.

While international football outside of major competitions doesn’t always get a lot of love, days like these are simply great to cover.

I can’t wait any longer, so let’s get going!
