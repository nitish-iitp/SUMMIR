Kosovo bounces back with a convincing victory against Cyprus 

9 September, 2024 – The Kosovo national team secured a convincing victory against Cyprus on Monday evening in Larnaca, triumphing with a 4-0 result. This was the first win for the Dardanians in the fourth edition of the UEFA Nations League, where our team completely dominated the match and delivered an impressive performance.

Kosovo clearly showed its superiority over the opponent in every aspect from the very start. After the loss in the last match against Romania, the Dardanians restored confidence with an excellent performance. Cyprus, who had won their previous match against Lithuania, stood no chance against Kosovo’s fast and organized play.

Kosovo started the match fiercely, scoring the first goal in the 9th minute. Donat Rrudhani won a penalty, which Vedat Muriqi converted to give Kosovo a 1-0 lead. It didn’t take long for Muriqi to score again, heading in another goal in the 21st minute after a precise cross from Rrudhani, making it 2-0. The first half ended with complete domination from the Dardanians.

The second half started with some tactical changes from Kosovo. Albion Rrahmani replaced Muriqi, and Lumbardh Dellova came on for Fidan Aliti. These changes had an immediate impact, as Rrahmani scored the third goal in the 48th minute following a beautiful assist from Milot Rashica.

In the 55th minute, after a well-coordinated play, Rrudhani passed the ball into the box for Lumbardh Dellova, who struck with precision to seal the 4-0 result.

Coach Franco Foda continued to rotate players, bringing on Ilir Krasniqi, Emir Sahiti, and Eliot Bujupi, who made his debut for the national team. Shortly before the end, Emir Sahiti had a great opportunity to score, but his shot hit the post.

This victory boosts the team’s morale and demonstrates the players’ commitment to giving their best in every upcoming match.
