We said: Benin 2-1 Libya
Libya will feel gutted not to have secured all three points against Rwanda and will head into Tuesday's clash looking to bounce back. However, Benin boast the quality needed to get the job done here and we are tipping them to come away with a narrow victory at the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Read more.
