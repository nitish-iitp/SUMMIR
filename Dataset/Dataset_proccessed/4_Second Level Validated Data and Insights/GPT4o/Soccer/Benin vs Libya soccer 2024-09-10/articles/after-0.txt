Outstanding player Benin

Steve Mounié is the player to watch for this team. Undoubtedly, the FC Ausburg striker is the reference in the attack and the goal options will pass through his feet. He has played 51 games for his national team, scoring 17 goals and providing 3 assists.

Libya, a story far from home

War and conflict in African countries is unfortunately present in everyday life. Libya has not been exempt from it and that is why it had to play its matches outside its country for almost 7 years. 
On March 25, 2021, its population returned to see Liu's national team play a soccer match. That day they faced the Tunisian national team and were defeated 2-5. However, the important thing that night was not the match, it was that a part of the population could return to the stadium without fear.
