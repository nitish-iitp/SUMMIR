Preview: Benin vs. Libya - prediction, team news, lineups

Benin and Libya return to action in Group D of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they go head to head at the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny on Tuesday.

This will be the first meeting between the two nations since November 2018, when the Mediterranean Knights picked up a 1-0 friendly victory, and they will both be looking to secure their first win of the campaign.

Benin were outclassed and outplayed by West African rivals Nigeria in their Group D opener as they fell to a 3-0 defeat against the Super Eagles at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium on Saturday.

Atalanta BC forward Ademola Lookman turned in a performance of the highest quality as he scored either side of Victor Osimhen's strike to hand Nigeria a comfortable opening-day victory.

Prior to that, Gernot Rohr's men were unbeaten in three back-to-back competitive matches, picking up one draw and consecutive wins over Rwanda and Nigeria in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Benin have enjoyed an impressive start to the World Cup qualifying campaign, claiming seven points from their four matches to sit third in Group C, only behind first-placed Rwanda on goal difference.

Since their quarter-final finish in Egypt back in 2019, Les Guepards have failed to feature in the Africa Cup of Nations and will head into Tuesday's tie looking to get their quest for a place in Morocco up and running.

Libya, on the other hand, were denied a dream start to their AFCON qualifying campaign as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Rwanda in Tripoli's 11 June Stadium last Wednesday.

Al Ittihad SC defender Sobhi Al Mabrouk grabbed his debut international goal in the 16th minute to put the hosts in front but 26-year-old striker Innocent Nshuti netted two minutes into the second half to hand Rwanda a share of the spoils.

This followed a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Cape Verde in the World Cup qualifiers on June 11, a result which saw the Mediterranean Knights' nine-game unbeaten run across all competitions come to an end.

Despite their loss to Cape Verde, Libya remain well on course to secure a first-ever World Cup appearance as they sit second in Group D, level on seven points with Cape Verde and one point behind leaders Cameroon.

Head coach Milutin Sredojevic will hope his side can take the positives from Wednesday's stalemate and quickly find their feet as they look to end their 12-year AFCON absence.

Libya's last appearance in the continental showpiece came back in 2012, when they crashed out in the group stages after picking up one win and one draw from their three matches to collect four points and finish third in Group A.

Despite their disappointing result against Nigeria, we expect to see an unchanged Benin XI on Tuesday, with David Kiki, Olivier Verdon, Cedric Hountondji and Rachid Moumini forming the back four once again.

Steve Mounie was a bright spark against the Super Eagles and the Augsburg striker, who has 17 goals since his debut in October 2015, should lead Les Guepards attack, alongside Aiyegun Tosin and Junior Olaitan.

Apollon Limassol's Sessi D'Almeida made his 37th appearance for Benin at the weekend and the 28-year-old should retain his role at the centre of the park, forming the midfield trio with Hassane Imourane and Dokou Dodo.

Al Mabrouk got off the mark for Libya with his opener against Rwanda last time out and the 21-year-old should form the back four with Sanad Elkouri, Ali Yusuf and Majdi Erteiba once again.

Faisal Al Badri and Osama Al Shreimy should form the two-man midfield pivot while we should see the attacking quarter of Fadel Salama, Omar Al Khoja, Noureddine Al Gleib and Al Ahli Tripoli man Ahmed Krawaa.


Benin possible starting lineup:
Dandjinou; Kiki, Verdon, Hountondji, Moumini; D'Almeida, Imourane, Dodo; Olaitan, Mounie, Tosin

Libya possible starting lineup:
Al Wuhayshi; Elkouri, Yusuf, Erteiba, Al Mabrouk; Al Badri, Al Shreimy; Salama, Al Khoja, Al Gleib; Krawaa


We say: Benin 2-1 Libya

Libya will feel gutted not to have secured all three points against Rwanda and will head into Tuesday's clash looking to bounce back. However, Benin boast the quality needed to get the job done here and we are tipping them to come away with a narrow victory at the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
