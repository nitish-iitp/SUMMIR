In a friendly international duel with Egypt on Sunday, January 7, 2024, the Taifa Stars were defeated 2-0.

Dar es Salaam. Tanzania National Football Team (Taifa Stars) captain, Mbwana Samatta, has said there is ample room for the team’s technical bench to rectify mistakes before they compete in the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals in Ivory Coast.

In a friendly international duel with Egypt on Sunday, January 7, 2024, the Taifa Stars were defeated 2-0.

In the match played at the Cairo International Stadium, Taifa Stars players created numerous scoring opportunities but failed to convert them into goals. Mahmoud Hassan ‘Trezeguet’ gave the hosts the lead after 33 minutes, and skipper Mohamed Salah sealed the victory with a second-half penalty, capitalising on a foul on Omar Marmoush in the box.

Reflecting on the challenging encounter, Samatta said that playing against one of the African giants was a valuable experience and the perfect build-up before facing Morocco on January 17 at the Laurent Pokou Stadium in San Pédro. “It was a tough match, and I believe our technical bench has spotted mistakes that will be rectified before we play our first matches against Morocco and others,” said Samatta. He shared the lessons learned from facing Egypt. “Egypt is a strong team on the continent, and playing against them has helped us pick up some lessons that we shall work on going into the Afcon.” Taifa Stars head coach Adel Amrouche echoed Samatta’s sentiments, saying that the team has prepared well in Egypt and is heading to the Afcon not just to participate but to compete. Amrouche declared, “There is no easy game in the competition, and we need to fight in all matches.”

Apart from Morocco, Taifa Stars will face Zambia on January 21 and DR Congo in the last group match on January 24. The team’s 27 players are now in Ivory Coast, ready for the competition. The players are goalkeepers Aishi Manula, Kwesi Kawawa and Beno Kakolanya.

The defence boasts a formidable lineup, including experienced campaigners like Mohammed Hussein and Ibrahim Hamadi Bacca, alongside Shakhtar Donetsk’s Novatus Dismas and England-based Haji Mnoga and Abdi Banda.

The midfield is equally impressive, with Azam FC duo Sospeter Bajana and Feisal Salum alongside Mudathir Yahaya and Morice Abraham.

The attacking unit promises fireworks, with Ben Starkie, Cyprian Kachwele, and Charles M’mombwa joined by Saimon Msuva and the experienced captain, Mbwana Samatta.
