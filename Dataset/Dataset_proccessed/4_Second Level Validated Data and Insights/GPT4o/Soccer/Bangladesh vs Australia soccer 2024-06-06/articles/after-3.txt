Socceroos scrap out 2-0 qualifying win over Bangladesh

The Socceroos’ hopes of a goal-scoring blitz of Bangladesh have fallen flat, with Graham Arnold’s charges instead scrapping out a frustrating 2-0 win in their World Cup qualifier in Dhaka.

In hot, humid conditions on a shabby, waterlogged pitch at the Bashundhara Kings Arena, debutant Nestory Irankunda was handed a shock start by Arnold in an attacking starting line-up.

The physical, dour game against world No.184 Bangladesh was effectively a dead rubber given Australia have already progressed to the next round of qualifying, while they claimed top spot in Group I with Thursday’s win.

But the Socceroos clearly would have wanted more goals than Ajdin Hrustic’s deflected long-range strike in the 29th minute and Kusini Yengi’s header in the 62nd.

Hrustic also hobbled off after consecutive physical challenges shortly after halftime.

Australia’s performance was marred by poor crosses and finishing, in difficult conditions - but Jordy Bos was superb.

The roaming left-back worked tirelessly and was Australia’s main creative outlet.

Irankunda, the 18-year-old sensation, who is bound for Bayern Munich, had been widely expected to come off the bench in his first senior appearance.

Instead, he started on the right wing as strikers Yengi and Mitch Duke started together up top and Hrustic played attacking midfield.

The Socceroos dominated possession as Bangladesh sat deep - but recorded just four shots on target from 15 attempts.

Irankunda scuffed a strike wide in the 17th minute.

Shortly after, Duke was hacked down close to goal but his pleas for a penalty fell on deaf ears, while the striker fluffed a header in the 27th minute.

Australia finally broke through when Irankunda found Hrustic, whose long-range strike took a cruel deflection into the back of the net.

Bangladesh managed a shot through Rakib Hossain in the 33rd minute - though it was so far off target it literally ended up in the car park.

Bos couldn’t believe he hadn’t been awarded a penalty when he was sandwiched by three Bangladesh defenders in the 39th.

Four minutes later, Duke again failed to properly connect with a header.

Irankunda provided a glimpse of his precocious talents in the 58th minute when he beat a defender and danced into the area.

Four minutes later, Bos floated in a wonderful ball that a leaping Yengi superbly nodded home.

Daniel Arzani replaced Irankunda in the 64th minute, his first cap since the 2018 World Cup, and showed exciting flashes, albeit without reward as the game petered out.

The Socceroos will head straight to Perth for Tuesday night’s final qualifier against Palestine.

And that’s it - Australia wins 2-0

And there’s the final whistle, putting us all out of our misery. The Socceroos have claimed a 2-0 win over Bangladesh in tonight’s World Cup qualifier, their fifth in this stage of the process.

Ajdin Hrustic scored the opening goal in the 29th minute courtesy of a very fortunate deflection which took his long-range shot past Bangladesh’s goalkeeper.

Kusini Yengi added the second goal in the 62nd minute with a header from a fantastic Jordy Bos cross from the left.

Australia will be disappointed, though, that they didn’t score more goals. Conditions were tough, the pitch was terrible and their opponents were ultra-defensive but the Socceroos generated just four shots on target, meaning the questions over their attacking ability will linger.

But there is a risk of over-analysis, too. Playing in Asia is difficult, especially on nights like this. Alex Brosque is on the broadcast talking about how you take the three points and move on from games like that.

Nestory Irankunda made an eye-catching debut while Daniel Arzani was pretty impressive off the bench in the second half too.

We’re into stoppage time

Not that I want this match to go on for any longer, but the fourth official has just indicated there will be three minutes of additional time - and that’s just ridiculous. There has been at least six minutes of stoppages, if not more. Timekeeping in football is a real problem.

Anyway when you’ve got me complaining about timekeeping, you know the game’s a bit boring. This has been pretty sloppy stuff from the Socceroos. For all the possession they’ve enjoyed they’ve still only generated four shots on target all night.

Arzani is making things happen

Cheeky little nutmeg by Daniel Arzani to get past his man on the right flank and find space for a cross. He’s looked really good since coming into the match.

Only a few more minutes left here, with a decent whack of added time to come because of various stoppages and injuries to Bangladeshi players. And now we’re stopping due to a pitch invader. How about that? We’ve had everything tonight - except, really, for good football.

More changes for the Socceroos

Two more substitutions here - Aziz Behich and Cammy Devlin on, Connor Metcalfe and Jackson Irvine off. I presume that means a move to the left wing for Jordy Bos, who has been fantastic tonight - I’d say probably the player of the match. I think this is the first time Graham Arnold has used him in his natural position of left-back and that decision is paying dividends. Well, until now, that is. Meanwhile, this is Devlin’s first cap in over a year - I’m a big fan of the feisty midfielder so hopefully he makes an impression.

Taggart blows it over the bar

This game hasn’t lived up to expectations. And by that I mean my own. I thought the Socceroos would hammer Bangladesh but it’s been a pretty frustrating night in front of goal. Adam Taggart’s miss there from point-blank range sums it up there - Josh Nisbet’s cutback for him was fantastic and he should have put that away.

Meanwhile, we have lost the stream. Oh dear.
