England are bidding to bounce back to winning ways when they travel to Helsinki to face Finland in the UEFA Nations League this weekend.

The Three Lions' hopes of sealing a return to League A by winning Group B2 are in the balance following the shock 2-1 defeat to Greece at Wembley on Thursday.

Lee Carsley's decision to start without a striker in the absence of the injured Harry Kane backfired, and it now seems highly unlikely the interim boss will be given the full-time gig as Gareth Southgate's successor.

Watch Finland v England on ITV1

Kane could return to the starting XI, and he has fond memories of facing Finland after bagging a second-half brace on his 100th England appearance in last month's reverse fixture.

The Three Lions are the heavy favourites to claim all three points, as Finland have lost all three of their Nations League games and prop up the table.

RadioTimes.com has rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch Finland v England on TV and online.
