England lineup vs. Finland: Predicted XI for UEFA Nations League clash

England are facing a nervous wait over two of their most integral attackers ahead of Sunday's UEFA Nations League clash with Finland in Helsinki.

The Three Lions suffered their first defeat under interim head coach Lee Carsley on Thursday evening, a shock 2-1 home loss versus Greece, leaving them second in the League B Group 2 standings.

Captain Harry Kane missed that match with the knock he sustained while on duty for Bayern Munich last weekend, while Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was brought off early in the second half with a leg issue.

Saka appeared to be holding the back of his thigh as he trudged off, which would indicate a hamstring problem, so there is virtually no chance that the 23-year-old will be able to feature on Sunday.

England's attacking situation is further complicated by Jack Grealish's own fitness problem, so all of Jude Bellingham, Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer - filling in for Saka on the right - could hold their places.

However, Carsley's decision to go without a recognised striker on Thursday backfired spectacularly, so the 50-year-old will surely bring in either Ollie Watkins or Dominic Solanke if Kane is not fit enough to start.

Conor Gallagher in midfield would not go amiss either, as the Atletico Madrid man offers a stable presence alongside Declan Rice, while Levi Colwill, Rico Lewis and Jordan Pickford should all continue in defence.

John Stones - who captained England on Thursday night - may cede his place to Marc Guehi, though, while Kyle Walker could also be a straight swap for Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right.

England possible starting lineup:
Pickford; Walker, Guehi, Colwill, Lewis; Rice, Gallagher; Palmer, Bellingham, Gordon; Watkins
