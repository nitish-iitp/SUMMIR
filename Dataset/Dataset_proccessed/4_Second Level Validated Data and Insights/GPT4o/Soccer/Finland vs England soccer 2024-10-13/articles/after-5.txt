Finland vs England LIVE!

England bounced back from their shock defeat to Greece as Trent Alexander-Arnold scored a stunning free-kick in a 3-1 win over Finland. Lee Carsley made six changes after that Wembley disaster and it was a more controlled display from the Three Lions, if at times a little lethargic in failing to force the issue against a side ranked 64th in the world.

Victory, though, ensures automatic promotion in the Nations League is still in England’s hands, with goals from Jack Grealish, Alexander-Arnold and Declan Rice sending the visitors on their way to a much-needed win. Jack Grealish, one of those brought into the side, opened the scoring in the first-half, as he curled a low finish into the bottom corner after a lovely flicked pass from Angel Gomes.

Finland had half-chances to equalise before the break, but then should have got themselves level within ten minutes of the second-half. The ball was cut back perfectly into the path of Fredrik Jensen, but he somehow ballooned his effort over the bar from close range. It proved costly for the hosts, as England pulled away and eased over the finish lead. With 15 minutes remaining, Alexander-Arnold stepped up and whipped a brilliant free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards out, giving them the cushion that felt necessary.

Declan Rice then added that to that, finishing well as he burst into the six-yard box to get on the end of Ollie Watkins’ low ball into the middle. A defensive lapse allowed Finland to get on the scoresheet in the closing stages, England not dealing with a corner and Arttu Hoskonen took full advantage to head home at the near post from a corner.

Finland good value for goal

That was a frustrating goal for England to concede but no less than Finland deserve on the balance of play, writes Dan Kilpatrick.

England are worthy winners but the hosts have created openings and if Fredrik Jensen had brought his shooting boots, this may have been a more uncomfortable evening for Lee Carsley and his side.
