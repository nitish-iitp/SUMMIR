Morocco crushes CAR 5-0 in AFCON qualifier rout.Moroccan cuisine

Doha - The Moroccan national football team concluded their match against the Central African Republic with a resounding 5-0 victory on Saturday, October 12, at the Stade d’Honneur in Oujda.

The match, part of the third round of the African qualifiers for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations set to be hosted by Morocco, saw the Atlas Lions dominate from start to finish.Moroccan cuisine

Abdel Samad Ezzalzouli opened the scoring for the national team in the 18th minute, capitalizing on a rebound after a cross from the right side by captain Achraf Hakimi was parried by the Central African Republic goalkeeper.

Morocco doubled their lead in the 38th minute through a stunning strike from outside the box by Azzedine Ounahi, who curled the ball into the net.

Just two minutes into first-half stoppage time, Ounahi scored his second and Morocco’s third goal, assisted by Ezzalzouli.

Captain Achraf Hakimi capped off the first-half scoring with an individual effort, receiving the ball from Ounahi before slotting it past the goalkeeper in the 45th minute.

In the second half, Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 71st minute to make it 5-0 for Morocco.

The match saw the premature exit of Morocco’s goalkeeper Yassine Bounou due to a hamstring strain, with Munir El Kajoui of Renaissance Berkane coming on as a substitute.

Morocco maintained heavy pressure on the Central African Republic’s goal throughout the match in an attempt to extend their lead, while their opponents were limited to defending their area, unable to match the high press from the national team.

Under head coach Walid Regragui, the Atlas Lions aim to secure their third consecutive win, having previously defeated Gabon and Lesotho, and maintain their position at the top of Group B.

Beyond the result, Regragui seeks to improve the national team’s overall performance, especially in light of criticisms regarding the team’s lackluster displays and lack of cohesion between lines, despite winning most of their matches.

The team’s struggles, particularly against opponents employing a deep defensive block, have drawn significant criticism of Regragui and his squad, raising doubts about Morocco’s ability to win the continental trophy they are set to host next year.

The match was officiated by Gambian referee Bakary Gassama, assisted by compatriots Abdoulie Bojang Jallow and Nfally Jarju, with Omar Salah serving as the fourth official.

Morocco leads Group B, which includes Gabon, Lesotho, and the Central African Republic, having won their first match against Gabon (4-1) and their second against Lesotho (1-0) last month at the Grand Stade d’Agadir.
