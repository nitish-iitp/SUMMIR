Lionel Messi scores brace in Argentina's final Copa América tune-up

This will go down as one of the easiest goals Lionel Messi will ever score.

The legend’s 107th goal for Argentina came in La Albiceleste’s final Copa América tune-up, a 4-1 win in an international friendly against Guatemala at Commanders Field Friday night. And it was gift-wrapped by Columbus Crew goalkeeper Nicholas Hagen, whose attempted first-time pass out of the back was picked off by Messi.

The GOAT then tapped in from just outside the six-yard box to level in the 12th minute.

The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner and FIFA World Cup champion scored his first goal for Argentina since he struck for a brace against Peru in a World Cup qualifier in October. He was unlucky not to have two goals before the halftime break, firing a free kick off the post in the closing moments of the first half.

But Messi would not be denied in the 77th minute, latching onto a sublime service by Ángel Di María and clipping over an onrushing Hagen for Argentina's final goal of the night.

MESSI.

Another one 😤

Messi has been on a torrid pace for Supporters Shield-leading Inter Miami CF this season, becoming the fastest player in MLS history to reach 25 goal contributions with 12g/13a in 12 matches.

Messi and Argentina begin their Copa América title defense with a Group A clash against Canada at Atlanta United’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 20.
