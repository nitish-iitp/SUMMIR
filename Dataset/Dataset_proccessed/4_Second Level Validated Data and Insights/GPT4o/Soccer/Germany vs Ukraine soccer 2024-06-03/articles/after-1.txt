Germany 0-0 Ukraine

Germany's opening match at this summer's tournament is just 11 days away, with this only one of two games they have to prepare. While Julian Nagelsmann was without the likes of Toni Kroos, Antonio Rüdiger, Niclas Füllkrug and Nico Schlotterbeck following their UEFA Champions League exploits, he still named a strong starting XI for the encounter against a Ukraine side also gearing up for this summer's big tournament. The visitors warned Germany of their counterattacking danger within five minutes when Mykola Matviienko fired over from close range, but Nagelmann's men responded strongly. Admittedly, there were few clear-cut chances, but İlkay Gündoğan should have scored from the edge of the six-yard box as he mistimed his header from Pascal Groß's cross, while Matviienko deflected Jamal Musiala's late shot narrowly wide of the post. At the end other end, Roman Yaremchuk forced a strong save from Manuel Neuer after Jonathan Tah had been dispossessed. In the end, though, neither side could find a breakthrough before the break.

After the interval, Germany were far more dangerous, especially following the introduction of Maximilian Beier. Kai Havertz had headed beyond the post shortly after the restart, but replacement Beier hit the woodwork with his first involvement after coming on around the hour mark before forcing an important low save from Anatoliy Trubin. Ukraine continued to threaten on the break, yet Neuer was relatively serene between the sticks and was rarely forced into action. As if often the way with international friendlies, the substitutes were frequent as the game approached its climax, with both managers keen to take a good look at the players they have available to them. Another sub, Chris Führich, tested Trubin with a fierce effort before Beier headed wide from Deniz Undav's cross to the back post. Overall, Germany dominated possession and were increasingly in control as time went by, but they were ultimately unable to find the goal they were looking for. Nagelsmann and his players will now turn their attention to Friday's match with Greece at Borussia-Park, where the head coach will hope to be with his full squad.
