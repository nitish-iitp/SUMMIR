        "Interim England boss Lee Carsley makes his Wembley bow on Tuesday night as his side host Finland in Nations League Group B2.",
        "Carsley will be hoping to impress after stepping up from his role with the England U21s in the summer to become Gareth Southgate's temporary successor.",
        "The 50-year-old is expected to take charge of the Three Lions for their Nations League games this autumn before a permanent replacement is found, but a strong showing over the next few weeks could well see him land the full-time role.",
        "England's relegation in the last Nations League campaign sees them drawn alongside Finland, the Republic of Ireland and Greece in Group B, which means there is added pressure on Carsley to continue his winning start.",
        "While the hosts are stepping into a new era, the Fins handed Markku Kanerva, who has been in charge since 2016, a contract extension in June.",
        "They are 63rd in the world rankings, 59 places below England, and did not qualify for this summer's Euros - but the hope is that their long-serving coach can help them qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 2026.",
        "They are a team lacking in superstars, but English football fans may recognise the likes of ex-Norwich City marksman Teemu Pukki, former Leeds United midfielder Glen Kamara, and Celtic goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo, who made the move from Aston Villa this summer."
