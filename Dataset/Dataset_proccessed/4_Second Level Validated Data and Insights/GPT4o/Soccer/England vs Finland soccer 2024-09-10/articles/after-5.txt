England vs Finland LIVE!

England captain Harry Kane marked his 100th senior international appearance in trademark fashion with both goals in his team's 2-0 victory over a feeble Finland side in Nations League Group B2 at Wembley on Tuesday. The 31-year-old striker, who received a golden cap before kick-off and sported a pair of dazzling golden boots, broke Finland's gritty resistance with a dipping right-footed strike in the 57th minute.

At times it appeared to be a battle between Kane and Finland's impressive keeper Lukas Hradecky on a wet London night with the stopper making several fine saves to deny the striker. But a razor-sharp Kane beat Hradecky again in the 76th minute, sweeping in another right-footed effort to take his England tally to a record-extending 68.

Kane, who also had a first-half header ruled out for offside, was given a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 80th minute. England's win was their second under interim manager Lee Carsley after the away victory over Ireland on Saturday and puts them joint top of their Nations League group with Greece.

Trent Alexander-Arnold 8

England’s best player. Five or six stunning passes that carved the Finns open. Got an assist for one of his more routine passes thanks to Kane’s brilliant strike, then created the second with ball for Madueke.
