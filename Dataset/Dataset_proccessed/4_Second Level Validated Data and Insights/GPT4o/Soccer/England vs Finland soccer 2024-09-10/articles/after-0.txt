Lee Carsley, impressive and humble, talks to ITV. “I thought Harry Kane took his two goals really well … it was a big occasion for him … kids here and the wife … an emotional occasion … I’m really happy for him … he fully deserves all the plaudits he’s getting … he’s highly motivated to play for England and score goals … hopefully that continues … we played Trent Alexander-Arnold in a bit of a different position tonight, along with Rico Lewis, who was also excellent … you’ve seen from Trent an array of passing, an ability to control the game from a deeper area … getting forward as well … it’s not a surprise … I definitely don’t feel comfortable, I’ve been out of my comfort zone during this international window ... it’s been enjoyable but I’ve had to make sure every single day I’m producing a really high standard … everyone has seemed to respond to it … we try to do as good a job as we can … we’ve been fortunate to get two good results and it’s about building on that now.”

Post-match postbag. “Finland look like they’ve been regressing lately. While it’s partly explained by personnel changes, these days the Eagle-Owls seem lost when attacking. Keskinen might’ve been the most obvious culprit, but at least he was enterprising. The other Finnish attackers seemed to wait for others to make runs that didn’t happen” – Kári Tulinius

“Surely if most of the crowd had left early, those staying until the end would have an easier time getting home?” – Redmond Grimes

A delighted Harry Kane, 100 appearances in and with 68 goals to show for them, speaks to ITV. “It was a big night for me … obviously really proud to reach 100 caps … you know what I’m like, I want to score goals and help the team so it was great to be able to do that today … whenever you are doubted it makes you more hungry to prove people wrong … I always back myself to score goals … I am excited for the future … a great performance [by Trent Alexander-Arnold] … he backed up another great performance against Ireland … we know what he can do when he gets into those pockets … 2-0 is a really good performance and we’re not going to complain but we spoke about being ruthless … you have to keep knocking on the door and you’ll get your rewards, and that’s what happened tonight … [Lee Carsley] has come with a great energy, he talks a lot about freedom … suffocating teams … we have room for improvement but it’s been a great start for him and it’s been great to work with him.”

FULL TIME: Republic of Ireland 0-2 Greece. In the other game in Group B2, Greece have done a number on Ireland at an eerily quiet Lansdowne Road, Fotis Ioannidis and Christos Tzolis with the second-half goals. Heimir Hallgrímsson and John O’Shea look pretty dejected in the dugout as a few boos ring out at the final whistle.

It’s two wins from two for Lee Carsley. Sam Allardyce had nothing on this.

90 min +4: Madueke advances down the right and attempts a curler towards the top left. High and wide. Bowen, in space in the middle, wonders what could have been.

90 min +3: Grealish dances down the left touchline in the impish style. He’s having fun now. Another player who has enjoyed a good international break. Quite a few England players have.

16.36 EDT

90 min +2: Grealish tears past a now-static Ståhl on the left. A low cross sails invitingly through the six-yard box. Madueke is inches away from poking home. Cutting his toenails last night probably cost him a debut goal.

89 min: Wembley, far from full at the start, is half empty now. Most of the crowd content enough with what they’ve seen, and away home to beat the rush.

87 min: Bowen drops a shoulder and dribbles entertainingly down the inside right. He can’t find anyone in the middle, but that was a fun run.

16.30 EDT

86 min: Alexander-Arnold quarterbacks another fine pass down the middle from deep. Madueke and Rice faff around on the edge of the box, when one of them should really have got a shot away. It’s been a good international break for Trent.

79 min: That’s the evening’s work done for Harry Kane. He goes off to the warmest of receptions, smiling broadly, replaced by Jarrod Bowen. An inch, give or take, away from a hat-trick. Meanwhile Stones makes way for Marc Guéhi.

78 min: Kane turns playmaker, raking a glorious diagonal box towards Madueke on the right. Madueke sashays into the box and has a whack from a tight angle. He can’t force the ball through. It deflects to the far stick, but Lewis can’t tee up Kane, who had since made up ground.

GOAL! England 2-0 Finland (Kane 76)

… but back in the real world, it’s Harry Kane who has scored twice, and it’s Alexander-Arnold with two killer passes. This time he pings a defence-splitter down the inside right for Madueke, who immediately hooks a pass into the box for Kane. One lash across Hradecky and Harry Hundreds scores his 68th goal for England!

74 min: Oliver Antman comes on for Topi Keskinen, who, somewhere in the multiverse, has two assists tonight, Teemu Pukki with the goals. Decisions, decisions.

73 min: Alexander-Arnold crosses deep from the right. It drops to Eze on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Eze leans back and blazes over.

72 min: Madueke dribbles elegantly down the right. It requires two men to force him to turn tail. He’s been super-lively since coming on. “Trent AA has had such a positive impact on the game so far with delightfully incisive passes and it was only fitting that he played the through-ball to Kane,” writes Colum Fordham. “I’m thrilled Carsley clearly admires Alexander Arnold’s talents.”

70 min: Eze crosses from the left for Madueke, who can’t beat Niskanen to a header at the far post. The ball nearly drops for Kane, six yards out, but the whistle goes as the England captain is overly eager to win it.

68 min: Nearly a second assist for Alexander-Arnold down the inside-right channel, but Eze can neither lob the ball over Hradecky or round him.

67 min: Madueke is immediately involved, twisting across the front of the Finnish box, right to left, before sending a bobbling, deflected shot into the arms of Hradecky.

66 min: That’s Gordon’s last contribution. He leaves along with Saka, the wingmen replaced by Eberechi Eze and, making his debut, Noni Madueke.

65 min: Gordon turns on the jets and launches a counter down the left. Schüller cynically grabs him by both shoulders and goes into the book. “Watch England retreat into their shell and try to hold onto their one goal advantage,” writes Philip Ritson. “What? England don’t do that anymore?”

64 min: A little bit of space for Gordon, just outside the Finland D. His bobbling shot proves an easy gather for Hradecky.

10 Sept 2024
16.07 EDT

62 min: Finland replace Fredrik Jensen with Robin Lod. “Having lost by three goals against Greece, I had expected England to crush Finland,” writes Sara Torvalds. “But getting through 45 minutes without conceding a goal opened the door for Hope - which I shouldn’t have done, as Harry Kane then promptly shut it in my face.”

61 min: Konsa can’t continue. On comes Levi Colwill. Play restarts and soon after Gomes sends Kane barrelling down the middle. A shot is blocked. Finland have become ragged.

59 min: Suddenly Finland look super-vulnerable. Lewis enters the Finnish box down the left and lashes a low shot across Hradecky and inches wide of the right-hand post.

57 min: Kane drives down the middle. The ball’s passed to Grealish to his left, then shuttled on to Gordon, who shoots. Hradecky parries well. Then a cross comes in and Kane’s effort is straight at Hradecky, who saves again. But no matter, because England come for a third time, and …

55 min: Some pinball in the Finland box. Nothing drops to a white shirt, and eventually a blue one blooters clear. “It sounds like Saka is being pretty lively and threatening,” observes Charles Antaki. “Wonderful of course, but in one corner of the Arsenal fans heart is the preference that he tone it down a bit, ease up, and maybe dawdle a few feet away from where he should be, just to be out of range of any harmful boots. An England win would be highly desirable of course, but there is the North London derby coming up.”

HALF TIME: Republic of Ireland 0-0 Greece. In the other Group B2 match, it’s goalless in Dublin. Like England at Wembley, the hosts have had the ball in the net, but Chiedozie Ogbene’s effort was ruled out, the same player having been caught offside earlier in the move.

HALF TIME: England 0-0 Finland

Harry Kane had a goal disallowed for offside, but otherwise that’s it for England. Finland meanwhile will rue Topi Keskinen’s inability to spot Teemu Pukki free on a couple of occasions. Markku Kanerva will be the happier coach; Lee Carsley has a bit of work to do.

44 min: Kamara clanks into Gomes, just to the left of the D. A free kick in a very dangerous position. Kane wants to take it, but Alexander-Arnold wins the argument. He steps up, and …

43 min: Jensen advances down the right and wins a corner. Keskinen’s delivery is no good and it’s another set piece wasted by Finland. They’ve had their chances to work Pickford but not taken any of them.

42 min: Saka dribbles down the left and reaches the corner of the six-yard box, but can’t find room to either shoot or cross. He pulls back for Lewis, who rolls across the face of the box towards Alexander-Arnold. A fierce low diagonal drive flies inches wide of the left-hand post.

41 min: England continue to probe; Finland continue to hold firm. It’s been a staunch defensive display.

39 min: For the second time this evening, Keskinen has the chance to play Pukki clear. He runs down the middle, but instead of teeing up his striker to the left, attempts a much more difficult reverse pass down the right for Schüller, and the ball’s easily intercepted. A fair chance Pukki will offer Keskinen some beneficial advice during the break.

15.26 EDT

38 min: Alexander-Arnold rolls a pass down the inside-right channel and Kane nearly gets in ahead of Hoskonen. The defender telescopes a leg to divert out for a corner, from which nothing comes. Kane might have been a smidgen offside there, so had the pass reached the striker, any resulting goal would most likely have been chalked off.

36 min: Kane shows the first signs of frustration, penalised for pushing and pulling in the Finnish box then grimacing hard and muttering quite a lot.

34 min: The corner’s worked back to Saka again. This time the shot is no good, woefully wide and high. “It’s gonna take a decent finish to finish the Finnish,” quips Peter Oh, who couldn’t look that gift horse in the mouth.

33 min: Grealish’s presence down the left earns another England corner. Alexander-Arnold takes it quickly, Grealish cuts back for Saka, and the resulting shot is deflected wide left by Kamara. Another corner coming up.
