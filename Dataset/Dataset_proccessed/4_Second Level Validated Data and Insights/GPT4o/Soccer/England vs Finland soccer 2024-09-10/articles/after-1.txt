Kane's special night

It's time for us to part ways.

It has not only been a special night for England's Harry but also for the Mail's Harry who is bringing this blog to you. It's been a pleasure.

We all got to witness Kane deliver on his landmark 100th appearance for the Three Lions, netting a double against Finland at Wembley.

It was by no means a vintage display, but Lee Carsley's side certainly looked in fine fettle once again.

With that match now behind us, we can soon focus on the Premier league once more, the good stuff.

I hope I see you all there this weekend, it's going to be a cracker.

Until then, goodbye.

Kane: 'The game is evolving'

Harry Kane, England captain, speaking to the press:

My son was having a bit of a meltdown it was past his bedtime, thankfully my wife was there to look after him.
I don't think I was even thinking of 100 caps when I was on loan at Millwall, Norwich and Leicester. At that time it was about getting back into the Spurs team. I have always had a good self belief. I have learned a lot of over the years with Mauricio [Pochettino] when he was at Spurs.
The game is evolving a bit and it is great for me to keep learning. I would for sure be proud If I knew I was going to get 100 caps.
21:52
Craig's video verdict

You have read what Craig Hope has had to say, now you can hear it.

I'll give you a slight spoiler, he was very impressed by a certain Trent Alexander-Arnold. Unsurprising.

If you want to know more, then you will have to watch it, won't you?

21:47
Home is where the heart is

Harry Kane loves Wembley, and Wembley loves Hary Kane.

Tonight saw the England captain score his 26th and 27th goals in 35 appearances at Wembley for his country.

He had already netted the most of any England player at the National Stadium and he has only added to it.

That's more than the majority of stars manage in their whole international careers.

21:43
PLAYER RATINGS: England 2-0 Finland

Want to read what someone else has to say?

Yep, thought so.

Mail Sport's Craig Hope was one of our reporters on location tonight as England cruised to another 2-0 win.

Unsurprisingly he has given Harry Kane a high rating, as well as a few other Three Lions stars.

But who impressed him the most?

Find out here:

England 2-0 Finland PLAYER RATINGS: Harry Kane stars in landmark match
CRAIG HOPE AT WEMBLEY: Harry Kane scored twice on his historic 100th appearance for England in Tuesday's 2-0 win over Finland as Lee Carsley made his second cap as Three Lions boss.
Mail Online

21:37
TAA the creator

This statistic does not surprise me one bit.

Trent Alexander-Arnold is all of creativity, he always unlocks doors for attackers to thrive.

He did that on many occasions tonight, as you can see. It's not the first time he has created five or more chances for England.

21:33
Carsley's perfect start

Not all England managers get off to a good start in charge.

Lee Carsley has, though, and he is the first boss to do so in nearly two decades.

He is the first England manager to win his first two competitive games and keep a clean sheet in both since Steve McClaren in 2006.

Let's hope he doesn't continue in the vain that McClaren did, though, that wouldn't be good.

Carsley may need to break out the rain dance...

21:29
SOFASCORE STATS: England 2-0 Finland

Dominance, total dominance.

I think based off of these statistics it's fair to say that this match was fairly one-sided.

I mean, it's not surprising really. England had so much of the ball that Finland rarely got the chance to leave their own half.

Lukas Hradecky had a busy night, making six saves, but he still couldn't keep two out.

A superb night for England.

21:23
'Kane proves his critics wrong'

Oliver Holt, Mail Sport Chief Sports Reporter, at Wembley Stadium:

Kane has been proving critics wrong throughout a long international career bedecked with individual landmarks and he did it again tonight.

21:19
Trent shines again

Just a quick word for Trent Alexander-Arnold, wasn't he brilliant?

It feels like the era of Alexander-Arnold in an England shirt is truly underway, at last.

Back in a full-back role, he is comfortable once more and is being deployed in the right way, unlike under Gareth Southgate.

Just like on Saturday, he was superb. He showcased his sublime passing range at will and also stepped into midfield to launch attacks.

The Liverpool man was a joy to watch, just like he is in the Premier League for the Reds.

Has Carsley finally unlocked his powers for the national side?

21:13
Kane's ton in numbers

Harry Kane has now officially joined the 100-club.

It's fair to say, the England captain has had a rather fruitful time in the Three Lions jersey.

Just see for yourselves, his numbers are ridiculous.

21:09
Carsley-ball

Two games in, I think we know what Carsley-ball is all about.

Yep, he loves precise passing.

England attempted 801 passes against Finland tonight, no team has attempted more in a single match in the 2024-25 Nations League.

Just like Pep Guardiola, Lee Carsley wants to pass the fight out of the opposition. Kill them with movement.

The fact that I have put Carsley in the same sentence as Guardiola is rather mad, isn't it.

I guess they are both bald...

21:02
Carsley: 'I am out of my comfort zone'

Lee Carsley, England interim head coach, speaking to ITV1:

Harry took his goals really well, a big occasion for him. Kids being here, an emotional night, but really happy for Harry. He fully deserves all the plaudits.
What I have noticed this week is he is highly motivated to play for England and score goals and to have a centre forward like that, hopefully it continues.
We played Trent in a different position, along with Rico, you have seen with Trent an array of passing, an ability to control the game. Not a surprise as we have seen him do it for Liverpool.
I definitely don't feel comfortable still, I have been out of my comfort zone. Enjoyable but we have to had make sure every single day we are producing high standards. Fortunate to get two good results and about building on that.

21:00
WATCH: Kane gets his brace

The first goal was good, but I think the second was even better.

It's a lovely team move, England at their very best. The pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold is particularly brilliant.

As soon as the ball came the way of Harry Kane you just knew where it was heading.

A fine first-time finish.

20:56
Kane: 'A big night for me'

Harry Kane, England captain, speaking to ITV1:

It was a big night for me, really proud. I want to score goals and help the team. Whenever you are doubted, it makes you more hungry to prove people wrong. I always back myself to score goals and I am excited for the future.
Trent backed up with another great performance. We always looked like the team who would break the deadlock. We spoke about being ruthless but in these games you have to keep knocking on the door and you will get your reward.
The manager has come in with great energy, talks a lot about freedom and attacking and hurting the teams. Of course, there is a room for improvement, but a great start for him.

20:55
'Not a classic'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

Trent Alexander-Arnold's passing and Harry Kane's class finishing was the combo needed to break down the Finland resistance.
Rico Lewis and Angel Gomes also played well. Not a classic, but they found a way to win.
20:51
Two in two for Carsley

Not a bad start, eh?

Lee Carsley's audition for the permanent role as England manager is going well so far.

Two matches, two wins, four goals, two clean sheets. It couldn't have gone much better really.

The football on display ain't half bad either, England controlled Finland tonight and really enjoyed themselves.

You can see exactly what Carsley wants to see from his side, he loves build-up play and possession-based football.

It's working...

20:47
WATCH: Kane marks special night in style

Right, let's look at Harry Kane's first goal, shall we?

There's one word for it in my book. Crackerjack.

The sound it makes off the bar is divine and the net rippling is a sight for sore eyes.

Just look at what it meant to Kane too, he loved that one just as much as his first.

20:43
Kane delivers once more

Now that's how you celebrate a century of international caps.

With golden boots on his feet, Harry Kane hit a double to down Finland tonight. And my word, they were both superb finishes.

We haven't exactly seen the captain at his best of late but he was always going to deliver on his special day.

That's now 68 goals for England's all-time top scorer and he doesn't look like he will slow down any time soon.

A lovely way to end the international break.

20:39
FULL-TIME: England 2-0 Finland

Another three points for England.

Two games under Lee Carsley, two wins. The perfect start for the interim head coach.

Harry Kane got the job done for the new boss by scoring a brace on his 100th cap for his country.

A special night for the captain and his side.

20:38,
94'
England 2-0 Finland

Noni Madueke really wants that maiden goal, but it's not going to happen tonight.

The winger tries to bend the all into the top left-hand corner but gets it all wrong.

20:36,
93'
CLOSE! England 2-0 Finland

Noni Madueke comes so close to making it 3-0.

Jack Grealish does brilliantly on the left and jinks into the box before fizzing a low pass across the box.

Madueke steams in to try and tap it home but only manages to get the smallest of contact.

A split second earlier and Madueke would have netted his first England goal.

20:34
FIVE added minutes

There will be five minutes of stoppage time for the 10 people left in the stands to watch.

Only joking, there may actually be 20...

20:33,
89'
England 2-0 Finland

Wembley is now practically empty.

I am pretty sure there are less people in there than there were when attendance was limited due to COVID-19. It's a sea of red seats.

I guess it's a Tuesday night, but still...

20:32
'Fizzing strikes'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

I am not sure the Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky even saw either of those strikes from Harry Kane. Maybe he heard them as they fizzed by him.

20:29,
85'
SUBSTITUTION: England 2-0 Finland

It's time for another substitution...

Leo Walta is now on for the visitors with Rasmus Schulelr making way for him.

We have just five more minutes of normal time left on the clock.

20:27,
83'
England 2-0 Finland

Now Harry Kane is off, England fans have decided they've seen what they wanted to see.

Fans are flooding for the exit despite there being over seven minutes to go. Weird.

I never understand why supporters do that, just enjoy the match.

20:25,
80'
SUBSTITUTION: England 2-0 Finland

No hat-trick for Harry Kane.

The England captain will have to settle for just two goals on his special day as Wembley rises to applaud the main man.

He leaves the pitch and is replaced by Jarrod Bowen for the final ten minutes.

John Stones also makes way for Marc Guehi.

20:23,
79'
England 2-0 Finland

I have just watched that Trent Alexander-Arniold pass again in the build-up to that goal. What a ball.

He really is thriving under Lee Carsley and is exactly where he wants to be. He will be key for England moving forward.

20:20,
76'
GOAL:England 2-0 Finland (Kane 76')

Harry Kane at the double!

The England captain's special day just gets better and better as he bends home a second.

Trent Alexander-Arnold sends a lovely ball through to Noni Madueke who slides it across for Kane to hit first time.

A lovely pass, a lovely strike, a lovely goal.

20:19,
74'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-0 Finland

Finland turn to the bench again.

And Marvel fans may be happy as Antman is entering proceedings, but sadly for you, it's not the superhero.

His name is Oliver Antman, not Paul Rudd, and he replaces Topi Keskinen.

20:18,
73'
England 1-0 Finland

Eberechi Eze has been really bright since entering the action and is proving why Ian Ladyman called for substitutions.

He is desperate to find the back of the net and has his third shot of the night already, ut blazes a volley over.

And when I mean over, I mean miles over.

20:16,
72'
England 1-0 Finland

This has been a much better half from England.

Finland just can't get near them, they are stroking the ball around with real authority and opening them up at will.

It's hard to see this finishing 1-0...

20:13,
69'
England 1-0 Finland

Trent Alexander-Arniold is really enjoying himself under Lee Carsely.

He sends a fine ball over the top in search of substitute Eberechi Eze and it nearly comes off.

Eze looks like he is in but Lukas Hradecky smothers him right at the critical moment.

20:11,
66'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-0 Finland

Right on cue, Ian!

Lee Carsley heard your cries for substitutions and brings on both Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze.

Bukayo Saka and Anthony Gordon are the two players who are hooked for them.

20:09
'Carsely needs to be proactive'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

One of Gareth Southgate’s failings in the Euros was his reluctant use of substitutions. He often left it too late.
I would like to see Lee Carsley be a little bit more proactive here, especially given his team are now ahead.
Carsley didn’t make any until the 77th minute in Dublin at the weekend. Come on, mix it up a bit…
20:08,
64'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-0 Finland

Now Finland turn to the bench again.

Robin Lod is on for the visitors, replacing midfielder Fredrik Jensen.

Can he make a difference?

20:07,
62'
England 1-0 Finland

Harry Kane is really hungry for goals tonight.

The ball falls to him again and he hits it toward goal straight away, but this time it is blocked.

How many more can he get tonight?

I mean, England have sparked into life, so maybe he will have a few more to his name if he is lucky.

20:05,
61'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-0 Finland

Oh, Ezri Konsa cannot continue.

The centre-haf has never recovered from his two knocks and has to make way for Levi Colwill.

A real shame for the Villa man.

20:01,
57'
GOAL:England 1-0 Finland (Kane 57')

HARRY KANE GETS HIS GOAL!

The England captain can't be kept out on his special day and he lashes the hosts in front on his 100th cap for the Three Lions.

Finland give the ball away at the back and the ball falls to Kane, who smashes the ball into the net off the bar from the edge of the area.

It just had to be him, didn't it?

20:00,
57'
BIG SAVES! England 0-0 Finland

Lukas Hradecky is having a blinder!!

He makes two huge stops to keep the scores level. I'm not sure how England are not ahead...

The Finnish keeper first keeps out Anthony Gordon who is in on the left before foiling an overhead kick from Harry Kane.

The Three Lions should be ahead.

19:58,
54'
GOOD SAVE! England 0-0 Finland

What a strike that is from Harry Kane!

The captain decides that he is going to take responsibility this time and blasts the ball low toward the bottom left corner.

It's hit with venom and seems bound to hit the back of the net but Lukas Hradecky gets across to get in the way of it.

A great stop.

19:57,
53'
England 0-0 Finland

England have another dangerous free-kick in a great position.

Jack Grealish is wiped out before Declan Rice sees a strong strike palmed wide by Lukas Hradecky.

The referee pulls it back. Can England make it count this time?

19:55,
51'
England 0-0 Finland

Well, both legs seem to be fine and working for Ezri Konsa.

The Aston Villa defender comes back onto the pitch and seems to be running OK.

One to keep an eye on, though.

19:53,
49'
England 0-0 Finland

Ezri Konsa looks in a real spot of bother.

And I have just seen why... OUCH. The defender rolls his right ankle as he tries to pass the ball out.

But, he is not being treated for that, the physios are looking at his left leg. Double-bubble blow for the Villa man.

19:49,
46'
SECOND HALF: England 0-0 Finland

Interesting...

Teemu Pukki has been hooked at half-time, he has been replaced by Benjamin Kallman.

Could that be an injury? I thought he played OK.

Ilmari Niskanen also comes on for the hosts and Jere Uronen makes way.

Anyway, we are now back underway.

19:47
Golden boots for the golden boy

I mean, why not?

Harry Kane has never been the most flashy but he is certainly flexing tonight. Well, I think he is.

The England captain has decided to mark his 100th appearance by wearing gold boots.

They may look cool, but they aren't doing the job for him, so far.

19:44
WATCH: Kane's strike disallowed

For just a brief moment, Harry Kane thought he had marked his 100th cap in the perfect fashion.

Just look at the joy on his face as he heads the ball into the back of the net.

Well, as you can see, it was taken away very quickly.

Kane was a good chunk offside in the end. Very disappointing from the captain on his special day.

19:42
'Final ball lacking'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

England started brightly, Gordon in particular, but the final ball and shot has been lacking. Only two on target and Finland smothering space.
The hosts just need that moment of inspiration to come. Harry Kane is still not at his sharpest but Angel Gomes has been tidy.
19:40
Slow starters

England fans, there is no need to worry.

Yes, that first half may have been frustrating to watch, and pretty boring at time too. But it's normal fro the Three Lions.

England have only been in front at half-time in one of their previous seven matches at Wembley.

They have gone in level four times and been behind on two other occasions at the National Stadium.

The solitary time they have led was against Malta in November 2023.

19:37
Three Lions frustrated

I think this picture sums up England's first half.

The Three Lions have been fairly dominant, but things just aren't going their way tonight.

That first 45 minutes was not quite the electric football we saw on display in Dublin.

The weather reflects the mood, right now, that's for sure.

19:33
HALF-TIME: England 0-0 Finland

After a short minute of stoppage time, the whistle is blown.

England have been far from their best and have not given their fans much to cheer about.

Harry Kane did get them jumping for a brief second as he found the net, but the flag shortly went up to rule out the goal.

There have been a few chances on top of that, but Finland have done well to keep the hosts quiet.

Not the best half of football I have ever watched.

19:33,
45'
CLOSE! England 0-0 Finland

Trent Alexander-Arnold wins the battle... but can't find the net.

He tries to bend the ball into the top corner from the free-kick but it curls a little too wide for his liking.

Not a bad effort, though.

19:32,
44'
England 0-0 Finland

Oooh, now this could hurt Finland.

Glen Kamara wipes out Angel Gomes on the edge of the box and a free-kick is given.

There are four or five players lurking over this free-kick... it's scoreable.

19:30,
42'
CLOSE! England 0-0 Finland

Oooft, Trent Alexander-Arnold comes very close to opening the scoring.

Bukayo Saka is sent through and works his way into the area on the left before cutting the ball back to Rico Lewis.

Lewis then finds Alexander-Arnold who only has one thing on his mind.

He has a crack from the edge of the box and the ball flashes narrowly wide of the post.

For a split second, I thought it was in.

19:28,
40'
England 0-0 Finland

There is an 'oooo' from the crowd as the ball rolls parallel to the Finland goalline from a Harry Kane cross.

But the whistle is blown as the ball had gone out before Kane got his boot to it.

Not sure how the linesman managed to see that, in truth.

19:26,
38'
England 0-0 Finland

While the action on the pitch isn't the most exhilarating, it seems the fans are enjoying themselves anyway.

There are a bunch of 'whey's' from the crowd, I wonder what's going on in the stands.

They then make more noise as Trent Alexander-Arnold tries to slide through Harry Kane, but the ball is intercepted.

19:22
'Lewis has been bright'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

It's interesting to note the positioning of Rico Lewis here - left back out of possession, but inside right in possession. He's been bright and has seen plenty of the ball, too.

19:21,
34'
England 0-0 Finland

This game has been rather odd in my book.

England have shown flashes of quality and some lovely link-up play, but overall it's been a pretty slow match, so far.

Bukayo Saka has a couple of cracks as I say that, but both are well wide. Not his best efforts.

19:18,
30'
England 0-0 Finland

Matti Peltola is a very lucky boy...

The Finnish defender is stuck in his own box and doesn't know what to do with the ball as Angel Gomes closes him down.

He decides to then hit the deck under the slightest touch from Gomes and the referee buys it.

Very harsh, Gomes was in.

19:16
'Gordon and Trent expressive'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

Lee Carsley doesn’t like the word ‘freedom’ but his players are spelling it out for him anyway. Anthony Gordon and Trent Alexander-Arnold are particularly expressive so far and it’s good to watch.
*Yes I know it’s only Finland and I know England haven’t scored yet
19:15,
27'
CHANCE! England 0-0 Finland

Oh dear, Topi Keskinen...

The man who dons a tattoo of Wayne Rooney (weird I know) has just missed a big chance for Finland.

He has Teemu Pukki free to his left but goes alone and smashes the ball well wide.

If only he had Rooney's ability.

19:12,
25'
England 0-0 Finland

VAR check the goal for an age for some reason.

Kane was miles off, I'm not sure why they had to look at it for so long.

Very odd, just get on with the game lads.

19:11,
23'
DISALLOWED GOAL!

Oh no...

Harry Kane thinks he has marked his 100th cap with a goal as he nods into the back of the net.

But he strays offside...

That's unlike him, he didn't hold his line whatsoever as the cross comes in.

I'm sure he will get more chances, though.

19:09,
21'
CHANCE! England 0-0 Finland

That's a brilliant move from England!

Angel Gomes shows what he is about and finds space just outside the box before the ball is worked to Harry Kane.

You know exactly what is coming next and Kane fires the ball toward goal but Lukas Hradecky.

Finland then break, but there is a foul on Ezri Konsa that stops them in their tracks.

19:07,
19'
England 0-0 Finland

Everything is going through Anthony Gordon on the left.

The winger is loving life and he looks to beat his man again before fizzing in a low cross.

He does the first bit well but his final ball is intercepted and put behind for a corner.

Nothing comes from the resulting set-piece. In fact, it's pretty woeful.

19:04
England flying... sort of

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

Sixteen minutes in and..... we've had our first paper aeroplane land on the pitch. What happened to Cars-ball??
19:03,
15'
England 0-0 Finland

Anthony Gordon really has been good and he is nearly involved again.

He comes steaming in at the back post as Declan Rice looks to slide the ball across the area.

But the delivery is poor and collected by Lukas Hradecky.

19:01
'Good start from Gordon'

Sami Mokbel, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

Very good start to the game from Anthony Gordon here. Terrorising his right-back. Nice balance and genuine end product. Will be interesting to see how he fits into Carsley’s plans when Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham are back available.

19:00,
12'
England 0-0 Finland

England are having all the ball.

It's only been 12 minutes and they have had 88% possession. Finland seem content to sit back.

Oh wait, I have done it again.

As I am typing, Finland break free and Teemu Pukki sees an effort diverted wide.

I wish they would stop making me look silly.

18:56,
8'
England 0-0 Finland

I think Harry Kane may have heard you, Craig.

However, his efforts to produce don't go very well and he skews one way over the bar at the back post.

He wins a corner, though. It must have taken a huge deflection on the way through.

It makes the strike look less poor, I guess.

18:54
'Kane has to produce'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

All of the pre-match ceremony has been around Harry Kane - and rightly so - but he does need to produce on the pitch now, after another below-par performance in Dublin.
At what stage do we start asking serious questions about his place in the starting XI? I can't remember his last outstanding game for England.
18:53,
5'
England 0-0 Finland

I normally jinx proceedings, but that was a new level even for me.

I couldn't even finish the post before England made me eat my words.

To be fair to myself, the first three minutes were played at a very slow pace and I just wanted to keep you in the loop.

That's my job, and I love it.

18:51,
4'
England 0-0 Finland

It's fair to say it's been a fairly slow start.

Wait a minute, just as I type that suddenly England have come alive...

Out of nowhere, Anthony Gordon drives down the left, confuses the Finland full-back, and sends in a teasing cross.

But Bukayo Saka cannot turn it home.

18:49
'Wembley nowhere near full'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

Whatever official attendance is given later on, the fact is that Wembley is nowhere near full. The top tier is about half full and there are spaces on the lower section too.
Now that the national stadium has been fully paid off, there really is no excuse for not taking England games round the country. The best atmosphere for an England game recently was at St James’ Park when Gareth Southgate’s team played a pre-Euro 2024 friendly against Bosnia.
18:47,
1'
KICK-OFF: England 0-0 Finland

The players have now had their final chats and are ready to go.

It's still lashing it down at the National Stadium, the ball should zip across this surface.

Well, it certainly does as the whistle is blown.

18:47
Minute's applause for Sven

The time has come to pay tribute to Sven-Goran Eriksson.

Wembley rises to remember England's former manager who passed away aged 67 last month.

His first competitive match in charge was against tonight's opponents, a fitting fixture to pay tribute to the great man.

18:45
Carsley does NOT sing national anthem

I can't say I am surprised.

For the second match running, Le Carsley does not sing 'God Save the King' in the dugout.

It's something England fans are going to have to get used to for the time being. And maybe longer if he gets the permanent job.

18:42
Kane's golden cap

The teams are out in the pouring rain with Harry Kane leading them out.

The England captain has two of his daughters with him while his wife, Katie, and son, follow the players onto the pitch.

He then leaves his teammates to collect his golden cap from fellow centurion Frank Lampard.

Then there is a lovely touch from Finland as captain Lukas Hradecky hands Kane a bunch of flowers.

Now it's time for the national anthems...

18:37
It's raining, it's pouring...

The Wembley weather is pretty grim.

Fans are avoiding their seats at the moment and staying in the concourse as the rain lashes down.

It's nights like these I am glad to be inside...

18:30
Grealish trusted

Jack Grealish really is back in the England picture, isn't he?

The winger may not have been involved at Euro 2024, but it seems Lee Carsley has taken a liking to him.

Grealish has now been named in the starting XI in consecutive England games for the first time since June 2021.

Consistency breeds excellence.

18:26
'Keen to see how Gomes gets on'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

I am keen to see how players such Angel Gomes get on tonight but it will be hard to make a definitive judgement given the nature of the opposition.
Finland are ranked 63rd in the world and the last team of note they beat was Denmark back in Euro 2020. This is the problem facing England in Nations League Group B2, sadly. The opposition will not necessarily provide much of a test.

18:23
Carsley: 'Gomes can dictate play'

Lee Carsley, England interim head coach, speaking to ITV1:

It's important we look forward to playing at home. Hopefully we can give the fans something good to see.
Hopefully Angel Gomes will control the game and dictate the play. It's important we don't put too much pressure on him. I have a lot of confidence in him. I have played Rico Lewis as left-back before and I have a lot of confidence. We've got to be creative with the way that we play.
Jack Grealish and Anthony Gordon were excellent the other night. They get you up the pitch. It's a great moment. It's a moment I'm really looking forward to and hopefully it will be a memorable one.

18:18
Will Carsley sing the national anthem?

I think we know the answer to this already, don't we?

There was major backlash after Lee Carsley didn't sing 'God Save the King' prior to England's match against Ireland.

Carsley was born and raised in England but played for the Ireland national team during his career.

So, now that the Three Lions aren't playing his old national side, will he sing the national anthem?

Keep your eyes peeled...

18:14
Allez Angel

Someone who will also feel believed in is Angel Gomes.

The midfielder has been given the nod by Lee Carsley and it means we have a crazy statistic for you.

Gomes plays for Lille and as you can see, England don't usually have players who play for French clubs.

A first for a long, long time.

18:10
Cole: 'Sven gave me belief'

Ashley Cole, England coach, speaking about Sven-Goran Eriksson on ITV1:

He gave me an opportunity in the team, he gave me belief. He made sure you were ok. We were going there (Germany) as underdogs. Sven made that clear. To go there and produce the performance we did was massive.
The team was that good, and exciting. There was always the belief that Sven would get the best out of the team. He gave us the framework.
What we saw of the character was a lovely man. I felt Sven could have got more out of us (in the 2006 World Cup). I want to be left with a beautiful memory of him.

18:06
That night in Munich

While we remember Sven-Goran Eriksson, we have to turn to one specific match from his England reign.

He gave England fans some of their greatest memories in the 21st century, but there is one in particular that supporters hold above the rest.

You guessed it, that famous night in Munich when he guided England to a mammoth 5-1 win over Germany in 2001.

I was personally too young to remember, but I know many members of my family who adore Eriksson for that match alone.

A magical night.

18:02
'Eriksson lived his life with uncommon grace'

Oliver Holt, Mail Sport Chief Sports Reporter:

Sven-Goran Eriksson did not waste any time on anger, resentment or regret. He lived his life with uncommon grace. When he was lampooned by critics, he never responded in kind. The worst that he did was turn the other way.
He never criticised his players in public and they loved him for that, too. His last act as England manager, in fact, was to plead with the media not to ‘kill’ Wayne Rooney after he had been sent off during England’s quarter-final elimination at the hands of Portugal during the 2006 World Cup.
And many loved him for his pursuit of hedonism. Football, it sometimes seemed, was a vehicle for him to chase prizes in his personal life that might otherwise have been beyond his reach.

17:58
Remembering Sven

Sven-Goran Eriksson will always be fondly remembered in this country.

He was a brilliant football manager who affected so many people's lives with how he led England during the early 2000s.

The former Three Lions boss sadly passed away aged 76 on 26 August after a battle with pancreatic cancer.

Tonight, the FA will celebrate Eriksson's life with a pre-match tribute.

A lovely picture of Eriksson also adorns the cover of the match programme.

17:56
'Carsley wants players to call him "Cars"'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at Wembley Stadium:

Ahead of Lee Carsley’s home debut as England manager, I was interested to hear him say he doesn’t want his players to address him formally.
‘Lee’ or ‘Cars’ are his preferred terms and I find that a little odd. He may only be the stand-in manager, but he’s still the manager…

17:51
Angel's time to shine

I wonder how this man is feeling?

My presumption would be nervous. I mean, I would be bricking it, but then again, I'm not a professional footballer.

Angel Gomes only made his debut for the senior England men's team on Saturday against Ireland, and he obviously impressed Lee Carsley.

We know Gomes has a good relationship with the interim head coach from his Under 21 days, and tonight he has been handed his full debut.

Can he shine next to Declan Rice in the middle?

17:48
Finland Team News - Pukki STARTS

I think you will recognise a few of these names.

Starting with Teemu Pukki. The former Norwich man is Finland's all-time record goalscorer and he starts up top for them tonight.

Former Rangers and Leeds midfielder Glen Kamara is also included, starting in the middle of the park.

A tidy team, that.

17:45
England Team News - Gomes STARTS

Of course, our predicted XI was spot on.

Rico Lewis does indeed make his second senior England start this evening and he will be joined by his clubmate John Stones.

It's a special day for Angel Gomes too, he makes his first-ever start for the Three Lions.

And of course, it will be cap number 100 for Mr. Harry Kane!

17:43
England arrive

I reckon the players have seen the drink prices going by their faces.

They look rather moody, don't they?

Well, we are about to let you know which 11 of them will be playing this evening.

Will are predicted XI be correct?

17:39
Wembley's high drink prices

Well, maybe this will get them down/

If those fans fancy a drink this evening, they are in for a shock...

Just four cans of beer at the National Stadium will cost supporters a staggering £27.50, according to sportscasting.com/uk.

At these prices, this means Wembley are charging £21 more for four tins than Tesco - who are advertising the same at just £6.50 on their website.

I mean, that's not great, is it?

It's not only beer, a glass of Wembley wine isn’t much better at £10, but vino drinkers can bring this cost down to £15 if they buy two glasses.

All the prices of drinks are below:

Pint Of Beer (Stella) £7.85
Pint Of Cider (Magners) £7.75
4 Cans Of Stella £27.50
4 Pints Of Beer (Bud) £28.50
1 Glass Of Wine £10.00
2 Glasses Of Wine £15.00
Absolut Vodka & Sprite £8.00
Coke (500ml) £5.00
Sprite (500ml) £4.80
Fanta (500ml) £4.80
Coke Zero (650ml) £4.95
Bottle of Water (small) £3.20
4 Bottles of Water (small) £10.00
17:38
Atmosphere building

The fans are flooding in at Wembley.

Just look at the smiles on some of the faces, the Three Lions faithful are delighted to be in north London.

They are in for a treat tonight, even if the weather is trying to ruin their fun.

Nothing can get them down...

17:32
Carsley: 'We have to be realistic with certain players'

Lee Carsley, England interim head coach, speaking on Monday:

We have to be realistic that the players that didn’t have a lot of time off in the summer, came back having maybe not played as many minutes, to expect them just to go into, especially, a game in Dublin at the tempo that we thought it would be and the physicality. I didn’t want to put them in a position where if they didn’t do well, you could almost see what they didn’t do well.
It just gave us a chance to do a bit more work with them during the week and then put them in a position… and there’s maybe four or five that needed that extra work and that extra day’s training which will hopefully help them.

17:29
England's LEAKED XI

Of course, Mail Sport's Sami Mokbel has delivered the goods again.

England's line-up is always a huge talking point before matches... and Sami always gets the scoop on them leading up to kick-off.

Well, we have put together the most probable England line-up tonight based on information from within the England camp.

It seems like a certain Angel Gomes may get his full England debut tonight after a cameo off the bench against Ireland.

Meanwhile, Jack Grealish is set to keep his place following his goalscoring display in Dublin.

England predicted XI: (4231): Pickford; Trent; Stones, Konsa, Lewis; Gomes, Rice; Saka, Grealish, Gordon; Kane

17:26
'Lewis is in line to start'

Sami Mokbel, Mail Sport, at Wembley Stadium:

Rico Lewis is in line to start for England tonight. The 19-year-old full-back is hopeful of getting the nod to make only his second senior appearance, coming in for Levi Colwill - who started Saturday’s 2-0 win over Republic of Ireland.
Lee Carsley is pondering two other changes to his defence; with centre-backs John Stones and Ezri Konsa in line to start the game ahead of Marc Guehi and Harry Maguire, who played in Dublin.

17:22
Carsley's Wembley debut

Lee Carsley may only be one game into his interim spell in charge but so far, so good, right?

His first match in charge proved successful on Saturday evening as the Three Lions ran out 2-0 winners in Ireland.

I must say, the football on display was lovely at times.

Now Carsley will take charge of the senior side at Wembley Stadium for the very first time.

Can he make it two wins from two?

17:18
Favourite Kane moment?

From scoring 79 seconds into his debut to silencing the Three Lions' old foes Germany at Euro 2020. Harry Kane has produced some big moments in an England shirt.

I would try and go through them all, but I think this post would be 1000 words long if I tried to.

So, I'll leave it down to all of you to do the hard work for me.

What has been your favourite Kane moment in an England shirt?

Also, you'll notice that his celebrations never change...

17:15
Pre-match presentation

A century of international appearances does not come around often, does it?

So, when it does, it has to be celebrated.

Well, England are commemorating Harry Kane's landmark appearance by presenting the England captain with a golden cap before the match

It will start the evening off in the best possible way.

17:12
England men's Centurions
Peter Shilton – 125 caps
Wayne Rooney – 120 caps
David Beckham – 115 caps
Steven Gerrard – 114 caps
Bobby Moore – 108 caps
Ashley Cole – 107 caps
Sir Bobby Charlton – 106 caps
Frank Lampard – 106 caps
Billy Wright – 105 caps

17:06
Kane: 'It's possible to reach 100 goals'

Harry Kane, England captain, speaking on Monday:

These 100 caps have come around so quickly, especially the last few years playing three major tournaments in such a short space of time. The goals were similar, I felt I was on 30 goals and then, bam… I went to 50 and 60. It is definitely there and definitely possible [to reach 100 goals]. I feel like I am in a good place and these are good targets to try to reach.
Some people may see them as unrealistic but I would rather go for something unrealistic and not quite make it rather than be comfortable just saying I will be happy with 70 or 80 goals. [Staying at the top level] is probably the hardest part. You see a lot of players who have a few good seasons but then drop off and I think the hardest thing to do is to maintain it and consistently play at the highest level.
That’s why I have so much respect for Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and these players. To be able to do it for 15 or 20 years is some mindset and some achievement. For now, 100 caps tomorrow, that’s part of the reason I am really proud. At 31, I am in a good place both mentally and physically and some of the players ahead of me like Ronaldo have helped prove to me I can be at this level for a long time.

17:02
100 up for Kane

99 and counting...

If this was cricket and a batter needed just one run to hit a century, it would be what we call 'twitchy-bum time'.

Luckily for Harry Kane, this is football.

The England captain will reach a century of England caps when he leads out the Three Lions. Some achievement, right?

Only nine players have achieved that feat for the men's side with Peter Shilton sitting top of the pile with 125 appearances.

Wayne Rooney was the last one to hit the milestone just under a decade ago. He went on to appear 20 more times for England.

It's fair to say, it's Kane's time to take the plaudits tonight.

17:00
Century looming

Today is the day that Harry Kane joins an elite club.

The England captain will step onto the turf in an England jersey for the 100th time this evening as the Three Lions take on Finland.

What would usually be seen as a fairly run-of-the-mill match in the Nations League has not become a rather special occasion.

It is also Lee Carsley's Wembley bow as interim boss, and I'm pretty sure he will want a winning start.

Going off those first four paragraphs, I think we are in for a rather action-packed evening, aren't we?

So, I think it's time we get this show on the road!
