Kane is the most disrespected man to have ever lived. Trophies or not, the quality he has produced for every team he's played in, regardless of the team's form or quality, is undeniable. Hoping Bayern win the treble and his critics take a long hard look in the mirror.

England v Finland: the best stats
published at 15:48 British Summer Time 10 September
15:48 BST 10 September

England v Finland (19:45 BST)

England are unbeaten in all 11 of their previous meetings with Finland (W9 D2).
England will host Finland for the first time since a March 2001 World Cup qualifier, winning 2-1 in Sven-Goran Eriksson’s first competitive game in charge thanks to goals from Michael Owen and David Beckham.
Teemu Pukki has been directly involved in 12 goals in 18 appearances in the Nations League (eight goals and four assists), at least three times as many as any other player for Finland in the competition (Robin Lod, 4).

Harry Kane will not only reach the 100-cap milestone at Wembley later but England have said they will also celebrate the life of former manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who died last month aged 76.

"He's one of our most famous, most popular managers," said England in a post on X.

England captain Kane added: "It'll be a sad night for a lot of England fans and [former] England players. It'll be a good tribute to him, that he fully deserves.

"I didn't get to meet him personally but he was a great person and he was really loyal to his players and his job. He'll go down as one of England's best managers. We hope we can pay him a good tribute."

Kane has been great, but seems to be on the wane. However, Watkins and Toney are not really anything like the same quality. The England team needs to hope a new central striker emerges in the next year or so - but there's no obvious candidate in the PL, so maybe there's chance for a Championship player to make their claim and break into the squad.

Gomes & Lewis set to start for Three Lions?

Henry Winter
Football writer on BBC Radio 5 Live

I think we'll see 4-2-3-1 again. I think Angel Gomes, who did so well for Lee Carsley in the Under-21s when they won the Euros last summer, will come in alongside Declan Rice in midfield.

Rico Lewis has been outstanding as a full-back for Manchester City and can step into midfield. He is a right-sided full-back but I think he'll play at left-back because England have so many issues there.

Both Kane and Greaves have scored 44 goals for England from open play. Greaves never took a penalty for England and reached his total in just 57 matches. He still has the edge over Kane for me.

England interim manager Lee Carsley speaking to BBC's chief Football correspondent John Murray about being interim manager at Wembley: "I spoke about how proud I was to be the head coach in Dublin and again same position.

"The family will be there, cheering England on, fantastic achievement not only for myself but the staff. Ashley, Joleon, Tim, it's a brilliant achievement for them.

"It's a big jump from the U21s, there's no going away from that, but ultimately the players aren't the same because obviously they are older but they're still humans, they still want to feel you believe in them and that you care about them, that you want them to do well. I think they've definitely responded to that."

England interim manager Lee Carsley spoke to BBC's chief Football correspondent John Murray on his role. Here is what he had to say: "I've said from day one, I really feel the support and trust and belief. It really helps when you feel that you're getting that support from your bosses.

"I think the role of a head coach/manager has changed, as have positions in football. I think we have to adjust to that. I think for whoever comes in, it's important that we support them and play to their strengths.

"I see my strength in coaching, developing players and hopefully developing teams. I'm going to need help with the other parts of the job, while I'm here on an interim basis, [I'm] definitely getting that. This is something I've quite enjoyed. It's been good."

Kane had (or has) all the potential to be remembered as an ‘England Great’ however he’ll be remembered as one of the best strikers in the world, playing within a golden generation team, who won absolutely nothing. So it’s a no, in fact he might be the poster boy for these disappointments.

New York Times Sport journalist Rory Smith on the Monday Night Club: "I think if [Lee] Carsley can show over these games, even against, with all due respect to these nations, more limited opposition than England will need to beat to win a major trophy, then he can go quite a long way to stay and say 'look, maybe you don't need to worry about trying to extricate Eddie Howe or whoever it may be. You have a continuity candidate here who works'."

Carsley isn't 'the sort of manager to get carried away'

Wolves defender Conor Coady spoke about the excitement around England on the Monday Night Club: "I think as England fans we should always feel excited. I think we should look at the squad and the pool of players we have to pick from and always get excited.

"There's some incredible footballers within that pool of talent we're talking about. Going back to Lee Carsley, I don't think he's the sort of manager to ever get carried away, in terms of what he is doing.

"The first half [against Republic of Ireland] was fantastic, of course the goals, I thought were outstanding. The way England played, they were on the front foot, they were getting forward. I think a big part of it was their control in the game, just controlling the game and I've seen Lee speak a lot about that, in terms of what he wants from his teams. He's certainly done that with the under-21s as well.

"England fans should always be excited, I look at that England team, no matter what England team gets picked, and go 'you're not far away' and I mean that in terms of the pool of players we've got."

Should the FA approach Howe despite Carsley's pole position?

England v Finland (19:45 BST)

Former Blackburn striker Chris Sutton speaking on the Monday Night Club about whether Newcastle boss Eddie Howe is a "clear and obvious candidate" to become England manager, instead of Lee Carlsey: "I think so. I think he would come into the thinking if he became available in the coming weeks. Something isn't quite right at Newcastle, so if he became available, I think the FA would have a big decision to make."

This debate on the day of his 100th cap is, frankly, very disrespectful. He’s clearly an England great and one of the best we have ever produced. Why can’t we just celebrate him? I’ll be there this evening showing my appreciation, as will thousands of others who know what a fantastic job he has done playing for and captaining his country.

Carsley 'can't afford a slip up' in bid for England job
published at 15:04 British Summer Time 10 September
15:04 BST 10 September

BBC Sounds

Former Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton spoke about whether Lee Carlsey could keep his role on a permanent basis: "I don't think he can afford a slip-up really. It has to be more of the same. What will be interesting is when he gets some of the big hitters back, [Phil] Foden and [Jude] Bellingham and Cole Palmer. Those decisions which he will have to make, they are possibly three players who we would all think deserve a starting place in the England XI and that's going to be an issue because right away, everybody's talking about Anthony Gordon, the way he played at the weekend on that left-hand side.

"People will look back to the Euros and think that was a problem position for England, Foden often played off that side. Gareth Southgate was accused of trying to fit his best players into the team. Gordon's performance was impressive. It will be interesting when they come back into the fold who he selects and how he goes about it. It is a wait and see and these games are important."

'I know my role for the next three camps'

England v Finland (19:45 BST)

England

There were lots of reasons to be optimistic about England's football against the Republic of Ireland, particularly in the first half, but Lee Carsley's focus is on short-term objectives rather than long-term planning.

"I try not to think about myself too much," he said.

"The best person should get the job. I know my role for the next three camps and I am comfortable with that."

The FA has said Carsley is expected to stay in charge during the autumn as the hunt for Gareth Southgate's long-term successor progresses.

There were no new injuries for the temporary boss to report at his pre-match news conference, but he is likely to make some changes to keep everyone fresh.

"If you make 11 changes it maybe sends out the wrong signal," Carsley said.

"The good thing about this group is they are highly motivated to do well. There will be two or three changes, but not wholesale changes.

"We have to make sure we protect the players as well."

Only 'the best' will do for England

England v Finland (19:45 BST)

England

Interim boss Lee Carsley said only "the best" will do for England as he responded to the question of whether beating the Republic of Ireland in his first match in charge might have strengthened his case for the permanent job.

Ahead of his second game, the 50-year-old stayed on safe ground on Monday by backing the Football Association to get the appointment right.

Carsley oversaw a comfortable 2-0 Nations League win in Dublin on Saturday in his debut game as head coach.

What's to come?
published at 14:48 British Summer Time 10 September
14:48 BST 10 September

We will throw in a few more, alternative views before this page closes today, but those four are a pretty decent cross-section of the opinions expressed.

Right, we must remember that England have a Nations League tie against Finland to play later, one that will surely be remembered fondly by Harry Kane once his international career ends, but also a tie that could have an important impact on the future of interim boss Lee Carsley.
