Finland will be visited by England in the second round of the UEFA Nations League, League B on September 10, 2024 The game will take place in the venerable Wembley Stadium in London, with 90,000 capacity. Denmark’s Krogh M., the referee for this much awaited match, will provide the game even more international taste. Both teams are in need of points; England wants to keep up momentum following a strong win, while Finland is trying to recover from a bad loss to Greece.

Given both teams want to rank first in Group B2, this collision occurs at a pivotal point in the tournament. Not only with their better FIFA rating but also with their undefeated head-to-performance against Finland in 11 past games, England is the favourites. The stakes are high for both sides as the second match of the UEFA Nations League campaign, and supporters should expect a fierce battle under the well-known Wembley lights.

Betting Tips and Match Insights

Examining the England vs Finland forecast now requires us to take team form into account as well. Following interim manager Lee Carsley, England is off a strong 2-0 triumph against the Republic of Ireland and has shown more attacking freedom than in past games. Finland has suffered in their most recent games as well, including a 3-0 loss to Greece, which has put more strain on the team.

England has traditionally dominated Finland, drawing two and winning nine of their eleven meetings. Particularly in away games, Finland’s defence has been erratic; it has given up three goals in several recent games. The Three Lions will probably take advantage of this flaw, hence England is the preferred country for this meeting. The England vs Finland match prediction should mostly benefit the home side for bettors.

England Recent Results

England has shown mixed results in recent international competitions, but they remain a formidable side. Below are their last five matches:

Date\tCompetition\tMatchup\tResult\tW/L
07.09.2024\tUNL\tIreland vs England\t0-2\tW
14.07.2024\tEuro 2024\tSpain vs England\t2-1\tL
10.07.2024\tEuro 2024\tNetherlands vs England\t1-2\tW
06.07.2024\tEuro 2024\tEngland vs Switzerland\t2-1\tW(after penalties)
30.06.2024\tEuro 2024\tEngland vs Slovakia\t2-1\tW(after penalties)

With four of their last five games victories, England has shown regular performance. Their sole recent setback was a narrow loss to Spain in the Euro 2024 final; the Nations League recovered strongly against Ireland. Particularly on the offensive front, the team seems to be in good form; key players like Harry Kane and Jack Grealish contribute often.

Finland Recent Results

Finland’s recent performances have been less impressive, with only one win in their last five games. Here’s a look at their results:

Date\tCompetition\tMatchup\tResult\tW/L
07.09.2024\tUNL\tGreece vs Finland\t3-0\tL
07.06.2024\tFriendly\tScotland vs Finland\t2-2\tD
04.06.2024\tFriendly\tPortugal vs Finland\t4-2\tL
26.03.2024\tFriendly\tFinland vs Estonia\t2-1\tW
21.03.2024\tEuro Qualifier\tWales vs Finland\t4-1\tL

Finland’s defense has been a point of concern, as they’ve conceded 13 goals in their last five matches. Despite some respectable performances in previous campaigns, their recent form does not inspire confidence, particularly in matches away from home. Finland’s chances of pulling off an upset against a strong England side appear slim.

England vs Finland Head-to-Head Matches

The historical head-to-head record heavily favors England. Below are the last five matches between the two sides:

Date\tCompetition\tMatchup\tResult
24.03.2001\tWorld Cup Qual.\tEngland vs Finland\t2-1
11.10.2000\tWorld Cup Qual.\tFinland vs England\t0-0
21.05.1985\tWorld Cup Qual.\tFinland vs England\t1-1
16.10.1984\tWorld Cup Qual.\tEngland vs Finland\t5-0
12.10.1976\tWorld Cup Qual.\tEngland vs Finland\t2-1

England has dominated Finland in past encounters, with Finland yet to register a win. England’s ability to score multiple goals, especially at home, has been a key factor in their success. Finland will need a near-perfect performance to break this historical trend.

England Probable Lineup

As England prepares for their UEFA Nations League clash against Finland, they are expected to field a strong lineup that balances both experience and youth. Under interim coach Lee Carsley, the team is looking to continue their winning form. Below is the predicted starting eleven for England:

Pickford (GK), Alexander-Arnold (DF), Guehi (DF), Maguire (DF), Colwill (DF), Mainoo (MF), Rice (MF), Grealish (MF), Saka (FW), Kane (FW), Gordon (FW).

Finland Probable Lineup

Finland enters this crucial UEFA Nations League match after a disappointing defeat against Greece. With several key players injured, coach Markku Kanerva will likely rely on a mix of seasoned veterans and emerging talents. Below is the expected starting lineup for Finland:

Hradecky (GK), Stahl (DF), Hoskonen (DF), Ivanov (DF), Uronen (DF), Peltola (MF), Nissila (MF), Lod (MF), Kamara (MF), Antman (MF), Pohjanpalo (FW).

INJURED AND QUESTIONABLE PLAYERS

Injuries and suspensions often have a significant impact on a team’s performance, and this upcoming match is no exception. Here are the players who are confirmed or highly likely to miss the match due to injury or other reasons.

England Player\tReason\tFinland Player\tReason
John Stones\tInjury\tKaan Kairinen\tInjury
Morgan Gibbs-White\tInjury\tRasmus Schuller\tInjury
Ben Chilwell\tInjury\t\t

Both teams will have to make tactical adjustments due to these key absences, which could play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the match.

Key Factors to Watch

As we approach the match, several key factors will influence the outcome:

Harry Kane’s 100th cap: The England captain is set to make his 100th appearance, providing extra motivation to deliver a top performance;
Finland’s defensive struggles: Finland has conceded at least two goals in each of their last four away games;
England’s improved attack: Under Lee Carsley, England has shown more attacking freedom, registering more shots on target than under previous management;
Injury concerns for Finland: Key midfielders Kaan Kairinen and Rasmus Schuller are in doubt, weakening their already vulnerable defense;
England’s poor Wembley form: Despite being the favorite, England has failed to win their last three matches at Wembley;
Jack Grealish’s form: The England winger has been in fine form, contributing goals and assists in recent matches;
Finland’s away record: Finland has lost four of their last five away matches, making a win at Wembley unlikely;
Head-to-head dominance: England has never lost to Finland in 11 meetings.

Free Tips on England vs Finland

Predicting results in football games requires thorough research into past events and team form as well as statistical analysis. We shall underline in this part some important elements that might affect the result of the forthcoming England against Finland game in the UEFA Nations League. Your betting decisions will be better informed if you concentrate on team dynamics, form, and outside variables.

Team Form: England is coming into this match on the back of a solid 2-0 victory against Ireland, while Finland is reeling from a 3-0 defeat to Greece. England’s confidence will be high, while Finland may struggle to regain morale after recent losses.
Home vs. Away Performance: England plays at Wembley, which has historically been a fortress for the Three Lions, even though they have struggled there recently. On the other hand, Finland’s recent away form has been poor, with losses in four of their last five away games.
Injuries & Suspensions: Finland is dealing with key injuries to players like Kaan Kairinen and Rasmus Schuller. The absence of these key players will make it more difficult for Finland to control the midfield and keep up with England’s pace.
Tactical Style of Play: Under Lee Carsley, England has adopted a more attacking and free-flowing approach, which contrasts with Finland’s defensive mindset. This clash of styles could lead to England creating more chances and dominating possession.
Motivation: England will be highly motivated to secure their position in the group after their relegation from League A, whereas Finland might find it challenging to get back on track after a series of defeats. This difference in motivation could play a key role in the outcome of the match.

By focusing on these key aspects, you can enhance your understanding of the likely result and make more calculated decisions when placing your bets.

England vs Finland Match Prediction 2024

The England against Finland odds make it abundantly evident that the home side is quite likely to prevail in this game. A comfortable England victory is most likely given England’s better form and Finland’s defensive weaknesses. Harry Kane’s milestone game and the recent tactical freedom under Lee Carsley provide additional confidence for the hosts. Finland, struggling with injuries and poor away form, will have difficulty containing England’s attack.
