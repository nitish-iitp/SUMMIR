Belgium on 17-match streak heading into Slovakia fixture at Euro 2024

Belgium will be heading into Monday's Euro 2024 fixture against Slovakia having put together a 17-match streak.

The Red Devils are the clear favourites to prevail from a group that also features Romania and Ukraine as they bid to end their wait for a major trophy.

Head coach Domenico Tedesco will be confident that his side can start positively at the Frankfurt Arena having not lost a single game since his appointment.

A total of 10 victories and four draws have been recorded in 14 matches since February 2023, with Belgium having not lost since defeat to Morocco at the 2022 World Cup.

However, as well as the possibility of extending an unbeaten streak, Belgium may also add another game to a run of particular results in a European Championship fixture.

Belgium currently on 44-year streak

Aside from the aforementioned World Cup in question, Belgium have generally performed well at major tournaments, winning numerous matches before an exit in the knockout stages.

Belgium have played in four European Championship since losing in the final in 1980, being eliminated in the group stage in 1984 and 2000 before quarter-finals appearances in 2016 and 2020.

In each of those competitions, as well as the 1980 showpiece, Belgium have not suffered a single draw, winning nine times and losing on eight occasions.

Their most recent draw was a goalless stalemate with Italy in the group stages 44 years ago before they ultimately progressed further in the tournament.

Belgium to play Slovakia in first competitive fixture

These two nations have only met on three occasions in their respective history, all of which have been friendly internationals.

The first two of those games - in 2002 and 2006 - ended in draws, each team playing a game on home territory.

In 2013, Belgium would run out 2-1 victors in Bruges courtesy of an early Eden Hazard penalty and a last-gasp Dries Mertens effort.
