Two Romelu Lukaku goals were ruled out by video review, and Belgium fell to a stunning 1-0 loss to Slovakia in wild Group D at the European Championship on Monday.

Per FOX Sports research, it's the biggest upset by FIFA ranking differential in Euro history. 

Belgium was ranked No. 3 in FIFA men's world rankings entering the match, while Slovakia was ranked No. 48. That is a difference of 45 spots, unseating Finland's upset over Denmark at Euro 2020 (a 44-spot rankings difference) for the title of biggest European Championship upset since FIFA rankings were introduced in 1992.

From a sports betting perspective, it was also historic, as Slovakia was +600 to win outright before the match started, while Belgium was the heavy favorite at -210. The odds of a draw closed at +340.

Slovakia struck with a seventh-minute goal by forward Ivan Schranz then survived a string of misses by Belgium record scorer Lukaku, who had two second-half goals overturned, and all that playmaker Kevin De Bruyne could help create.

Slovakia's deserved win also was preserved by defender Dávid Hancko's brave goal-line block that left him sprawled in the goal net with a face injury inflicted by a teammate's knee.

That came in the 62nd minute, from substitute Johan Bakayoko's close-range shot, just seven minutes after Lukaku's first ‘goal' was overturned when a video review spotted an offside.

The second VAR intervention in the 86th disallowed Lukaku's powerful shot because of a handball by Loïs Openda before his decisive pass.

Lukaku set a competition record of 14 goals in a qualifying group last year, yet somehow failed to score in a wasteful first half including twice before Slovakia led.

The drama in Frankfurt came hours after Romania upended predictions by outclassing Ukraine 3-0 in Munich.
