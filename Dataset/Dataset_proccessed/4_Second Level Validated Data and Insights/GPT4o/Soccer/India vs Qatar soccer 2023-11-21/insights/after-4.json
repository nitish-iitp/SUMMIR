        "Rahul Bheke: 'This year, you\u2019ll see that we have played well, have maintained ball possession and have won trophies. Somewhere, I feel the work that Igor Stimac has done here over the years, except during the pandemic period when there was hardly any time for preparation, is bearing fruits now.'"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Qatar cruises past India and extends its lead in the top of the table. Qatar kept asking questions of a struggling Indian backline that just wasn\u2019t sharp enough to stop the away side\u2019s attackers. The back-line was not tight enough in its marking and failed to read the large amount of plays made by Qatar. India too made a few decent chances but in the end, couldn\u2019t find the net. A disappointing night for the underdogs.",
        "Arsene Wenger says 'India needs to take the hand-brakes off and play with a little bit more tempo in the second half. They should also be a bit more tighter in marking attackers and go for it in the second half.'"
