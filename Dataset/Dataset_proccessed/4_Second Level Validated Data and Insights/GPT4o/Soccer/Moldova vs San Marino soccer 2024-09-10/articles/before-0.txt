Preview: Moldova vs. San Marino - prediction, team news, lineups

Following their first-ever victory in a competitive match, San Marino's history makers seek back-to-back wins on Tuesday, as they meet Moldova in the UEFA Nations League.

The world's lowest-ranked team head to Chisinau having begun their campaign by beating Liechtenstein; meanwhile, Moldova saw off Malta in their League D Group 1 opener.

History was made on Thursday evening in San Marino, as the tiny microstate finally tasted victory in an official competitive fixture, with Nicko Sensoli's 53rd-minute strike proving enough to defeat fellow minnows Liechtenstein.

A first win of any kind for some 20 years was celebrated wildly, as the nation that sits rock-bottom of FIFA's world rankings picked up three points for the first time ever.

With a population of just 33,000 people, San Marino's squad is mostly made up of amateurs, and they had previously lost 196 of 205 games played - including three so far this year.

Their goalless draw with Saint Kitts and Nevis in March was the first time the Biancazzurri had even avoided defeat since 2022, having understandably struggled to make any impact on Euro 2024 qualifying.

Now, Roberto Cevoli's men will aim to back up their long-awaited success by making more Sammarinese history and ultimately achieving promotion from League D: topping Group 1 would secure automatic elevation, while second place is sufficient for a playoff.

Precedent will be against San Marino on Tuesday, though: when they met their hosts in the inaugural Nations League six years ago, Moldova won both home and away without conceding a goal.

The overall ledger stands at 6-0 to the Moldovans thus far, and they also got off to a winning start when they welcomed Malta to Chisinau last time out.

Serghei Clescenco's side led by two goals at half time, thanks to Mihail Caimacov's opener and an Ion Nicolaescu penalty, and they held on during the second half to post maximum points from their Group 1 opener.

Despite their lowly stature, the Tricolorii are certainly on the rise, having almost become the lowest-ranked nation ever to reach a major tournament by taking points off Poland, Albania and the Czech Republic in Euro 2024 qualifying.

They ultimately lost out in a winner-takes-all decider against the Czechs, but getting back into League C of the Nations League is now a realistic target.

Relegated in 2020, Moldova narrowly missed out on promotion last time around - only finishing behind Latvia on goal difference - so they will want to avoid a costly slip up at home to San Marino.

Roberto Cevoli may be loath to make many changes to a successful side, so teenage matchwinner Nicko Sensoli should again start in support of San Marino's star striker Nicola Nanni, who plays in Italy's third tier.

Goalkeeper Edoardo Colombo also featured in Serie C last season, recording 10 clean sheets for Rimini, and he will continue between the posts in Chisinau.

While Nanni is the visitors' main marksman, Moldova's top striker is Ion Nicolaescu, who has now scored 11 goals in his last 21 international appearances.

The 26-year-old has been in good form for Eredivisie side Heerenveen of late; despite being without a club since leaving Pisa, experienced forward Artur Ionita should support him.

Captain Vadim Rata runs the hosts' midfield, while Spartak Moscow left-back Oleg Reabciuk earned his 50th senior cap at the weekend and will surely start again.


Moldova possible starting lineup:
Celeadnic; Craciun, Mudrac, Marandici; Ionita, Rata, Motpan, Caimacov, Reabciuk; Damascan, Nicolaescu

San Marino possible starting lineup:
Colombo; Benvenuti, Cevoli, Rossi, Tosi; Golinucci, Capicchioni, Casadei; Contandini, Nanni, Sensoli



We say: Moldova 2-0 San Marino

After the high of a first three-point haul, San Marino are set for the more familiar taste of defeat at Stadionul Zimbru.

Moldova have been gradually improving for some time now, and they are deservedly favourites to earn promotion from League D.
