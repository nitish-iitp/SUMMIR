We said: Latvia 1-0 Faroe Islands
While the Faroe Islands only lost their advantage on Saturday due to a cheap penalty, they were under the cosh for large periods and could have easily been put to the sword on another day. Facing a hostile atmosphere in Riga, we cannot picture the visitors avenging their Baltic Cup loss to Latvia, who may very well come up trumps by just the one goal once more. Read more.
