Cape Verde Islands to win
10

Cape Verde suffered a shocking loss days ago against Botswana as hosts and now will seek revenge far from home. The match, this time, is in Botswana.

The guests may turn it around

Botswana won with quite a bit of luck days ago, after scoring in the second minute, and then the defensive formation definitely did the job, although the then hosts missed quite a few opportunities. However, something slightly different can be expected now. It is clear that the guests are the more capable team and this time Botswana will not be able to just sit back in defense, as the home expectations will be different. The match probably won't be decisive again, but this time it seems to me that the guests will take their chance.

Bet on Cape Verde to win

For more security - under 3.5 goals with X2.
