        "A bravura point-scoring performance against the Netherlands has put Hungary in a better position for their crucial match in Bosnia in the UEFA Nations League.",
        "The winner of the encounter in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina will almost certainly finish third in the standings.",
        "If Marco Rossi\u2019s squad collects the three points, they will remain mathematically in contention for the top two places in the quarter-finals and four points clear of their immediate rivals.",
        "Conversely, the Bosnians would gain a two-point advantage, leaving the Hungarians in a winless situation as they face the stronger Dutch and Germans in the last two rounds.",
        "A draw would not decide third place, but the national team would still have the advantage, meaning the Bosnians would need to pull off a feat like the Hungarian team did against the Netherlands on Friday to overtake them.",
        "Against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Italian head coach of the national team would like the squad to attack more. In addition to achieving more possession and more offensive leadership, it will be just as important to keep the defense stable.",
        "Looking at the past, it is encouraging that the Hungarians have never been defeated by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the five meetings so far.",
        "Last Friday, the Hungarian national football team played an impressive 1-1 draw at home against the Netherlands in the third round of the UEFA Nations League, and with their superb performance they moved up to third place in the group.",
        "Marco Rossi\u2019s men had little more than 25 percent possession throughout the match, but Roland Sallai scored in the 32nd minute after a fine attack.",
        "The pressure on the Hungarian goal increased in the second half, and the Dutch equalized in the second half through Denzel Dumfries\u2019 header despite playing a man down due to Virgil van Dijk\u2019s sending off.",
        "The Hungarian national team did not lose to the Netherlands for the first time in 40 years, after nine defeats in a row.",
        "Head coach Marco Rossi noted that the 1-1 draw against the Netherlands is a bravura result, but he still feels a bit disappointed that the opponents managed to equalize.",
        "In Bosnia we have to perform in the same way. Of course there we will try to attack more and win, but we have to at least get a draw because that is what we need to stay in the top of the Nations League."
