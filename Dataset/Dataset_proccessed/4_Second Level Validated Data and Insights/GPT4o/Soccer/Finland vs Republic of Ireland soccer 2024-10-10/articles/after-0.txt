AS IT HAPPENED
As it happened: Finland v Ireland, Uefa Nations League
Kick-off at Helsinki Olympic Stadium is at 7:45pm.
6.59pm, 10 Oct 2024

Good evening!

How’s everyone?

Welcome to our live coverage of Ireland’s trip to Helskinki to face Finland in the Uefa Nations League.

There are 1,100 Irish fans at the Olympic Stadium in the Finnish capital as Heimir Halgrímsson seeks his first win in charge.

It’s Gavan Casey with you here and if you’re not at the ground yourself and can’t get near a telly, I’ll keep you up to speed here.

Kick-off is at 7:45pm!

…And this man starts.

Ireland team

Our man David Sneyd is in Helsinki and here’s his interpretation of the Ireland lineup:

“Finn Azaz will make his competitive debut for the Republic of Ireland in tonight’s Nations League clash with Finland, while Evan Ferguson returns to lead the line up front.

“Azaz comes into the midfield, with Josh Cullen also returning after injury and Jasyon Molumby drops to bench as manager Heimir Hallgrímsson makes four changes to the starting XI that lost 2-0 to Greece last month.

“Celtic defender Liam Scales, who was an unused substitute in both of the opening Group 2 games for this League B campaign, replaces Andrew Omobamidele, although it will not be a like for like swap as Scales is set to feature on the left side of defence.

“The presence of Robbie Brady in the team would suggest a back five with the veteran Preston North End man as left back or wing back.”

Republic of Ireland team: Caoimhín Kelleher; Chiedozie Ogbene, Dara O’Shea, Nathan Collins (captain), Liam Scales; Robbie Brady, Josh Cullen, Jason Knight, Finn Azaz, Sammie Szmodics; Evan Ferguson.

10 OCT
7:21pm

Sneydy has also been sending back some curious imagery from the Finnish capital.

Anyone need a pair of Teemu Pukki GOAT socks, or?

10 OCT
7:30pm

Oreland’s defence warming up as a back four: Robbie Brady left-back, Liam Scales left-side centre-back, Nathan Collins right-sided centre-back, and Dara O’Shea right-back.

10 OCT
7:37pm
How are we feeling?

There were only 15-odd-thousand tickets sold for this one at a 36,000-capacity stadium as of this morning, and over 1,000 of those were picked up by travelling Irish supporters.

The Finns are, by all accounts, even less optimistic about their national team than the Irish public are about our own.

This is clearly a relegation scrap and each side’s best chance of victory in the Nations League so far.

But how are you feeling about Ireland’s chances?


We'll do 'em
Vintage, horrible draw
I can't remember what it's like to not feel sad watching this team and it's beyond my capacity to envision a world in which they don't lose

7:44pm

Amhrán na bhFiann has just concluded and the Irish fans definitely made themselves known.

The Finnish anthem, ‘Maamme’ (Our Land), written by a German immigrant by the name of Fredrik Pacius, is just getting going. It’s no banger, let me tell you. But it’s getting a good belting, in fairness.

10 OCT
7:48pm
Kick-off

1′ – FIN 0-0 IRE: Ireland, all in green, get us underway. And Liam Scales immediately gets it launched.

Neither of these sides have scored yet in the Nations League this season, so something has to give this evening. Unfortunately, it may be our collective will in a 0-0 draw — but here’s hoping Ireland can roll back the years to 2002 when they beat Finland 3-0 in a post-World Cup friendly at this ground.

10 OCT
7:51pm

5′ – FIN 0-0 IRE:Ireland’s attacking players not really engaging the Finnish defence with any kind of press.

Ireland instead sitting off and looking to spring traps when the ball gets to midfield.

Couple of sloppy touches by both sides so far, nothing to write home about quite yet.

10 OCT
7:57pm

10′ – FIN 0-0 IRE: Nice move by Ireland. Liam Scales plays a lovely ball into midfield to Sammie Szmodics.

The Ipswich man turns and feeds Finn Azaz, who exchanges passes with Chieodoze Ogbene before whipping a dangerous cross across the Finnish six-yard box.

The hosts clear without too much hassle in the end, but a positive attack by Ireland.

Otherwise, the Finns have had most of the ball and are trying to get at Dara O’Shea down their left flank. They have so far failed.

10 OCT
8:00pm

12′ – FIN 0-0 IRE: A point of note: Ireland just blocked a shot from outside their box.

The Heimir Halgrímsson revolution is up and running!

10 OCT
8:02pm

13′ – FIN 0-0 IRE: Nah, scratch that: Leo Walta just found himself in a square mile of space and fired one down Caoimhín Kelleher’s throat from 25 yards.

First shot on target for either side but Kelleher figuratively threw his cap on it.

10 OCT
8:05pm
Goal for Finland! Finland 1-0 Ireland

17′ – GOOOOAAALLLL! FIN 1-0 IRE: Oh, balls!

It’s an unexplainable human error by Nathan Collins at the back.

He mishits a back-pass to Kelleher under no pressure, and Joel Pohjanpalo seizes upon the loose ball.

Pohjanpalo waltzes through and slides it past Kelleher.

Honestly, it would be a comical goal to concede if it was actually funny.

Collins just seemed to skim the ball as he attempted the first-time pass back to his ‘keeper. It tricked into No Man’s Land, presenting Pohjanpalo with the gift.

10 OCT
8:09pm
Disallowed goal for Ireland

21′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: Almost, almost…

After Ogbene is fouled on the right-hand side, Robbie Brady whips in an excellent in-swinger.

Nathan Collins peels around the back and nods the ball across goal to Evan Ferguson, who taps in what Ireland believe to be the equaliser.

The flag goes up straight away, however: Collins was just offside, which is confirmed after a VAR check.

A pity, but promising.

10 OCT
8:14pm

27′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: Ireland’s response to the opener has been decent. They’ve had 57% possession and are completing a lot of passes, albeit their lack of incision is leading to frustration even amongst themselves.

Still, it’s a positive little spell.

10 OCT
8:18pm

30′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: Almost the famous Liveblogger’s Curse, there, as Finland fashioned a chance for goalscorer Pohjanpalo.

His effort though, appeared to be partially blocked by Scales before rolling into the grateful arms of Kelleher. Well, either it was half-blocked or it was just an appalling effort.

10 OCT
8:21pm

35′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: If you wanted to watch this but you were unable to for whatever reason, close your eyes for 10 seconds and try to visualise what you think a game between Finland and Ireland would look like.

Congratulations! You’re fully caught up.

10 OCT
8:24pm

36′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: Finn Azaz does well to win a free-kick in a left-of-central position about 28-30 yards from the Finnish goal.

Azaz was on the march, found himself under pressure from three defenders, and shimmied out of a challenge to earn the foul.

Robbie Brady sends his free-kick straight into the top of the Finnish wall. One of those where, if it was a couple of inches higher, it might have flown in, but ultimately frustrating.

10 OCT
8:28pm

41′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: Ireland have their first shot on target as Ferguson turns a clever, quick ball infield to Azaz.

The shot from the left-hand corner of the box is as tame as it is ambitious, unfortunately.

10 OCT
8:32pm

44′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: Ferguson becoming a little bit more involved over the last couple of minutes.

Stretches for a shot after a snap-cross by Szmodics. Doesn’t really connect but the ball very nearly drops to Collins, who also stretches and just misses the ball — much to Finnish goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky’s relief.

Moments later, a nice move by Ireland sends Ferguson wide right in the box and his cross-turned-shot is saved by the feet of Hradecky.

Two almost-chances rather than full-on chances, but certainly worthy of inclusion in a liveblog severely lacking in compelling material (aside from Sneydy’s pics).

10 OCT
8:37pm
Half-time: Finland 1-0 Ireland

Oh, sugar. Ryan Byrne / INPHO

Listen, it’s been bad.

The game has been bad. Finland have been bad. Ireland have been worse by only an infinitesimal margin. Without the plainly unfortunate Collins mistake for Pohjanpalo’s goal, this would have been… okay, as away first halves go against opposition of a similar level.

But Ireland do trail, and there’s very little else to say for the moment.

I’ll catch you in 15 minutes!

10 OCT
8:52pm
Highlights (term used very loosely)

RTÉ are saying the Ferguson disallowed goal was chalked off because the ball was out of play from Brady’s cross as opposed to Collins being offside.

I’m not sure. Upon replay, it seems the most likely reason for it being ruled out might be that Ferguson was fractionally offside on the initial delivery?

Also, if you can stomach it, here was Finland’s goal…

10 OCT
8:54pm
Second half

47′ – FIN 1-0 IRE: Jason Knight tests Hradecky from range.

Ferguson then wins a corner with some clever footwork, which almost created a shooting chance. Brady’s delivery is headed by Scales into the path of Szmodics, who flicks it into Hradecky.

Decent chance for Szmodics, there. Good spell of Irish pressure.

10 OCT
9:02pm
Goal for Ireland! Finland 1-1 Ireland

57′ – GOOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLL! FIN 1-1 IRE: SCAAAAAAALLLLLEEESSSSS!

A brilliant delivery by Brady with a free-kick from deep on the right-hand side.

Liam Scales, unchallenged, plants a wonderful header past Hradecky — who didn’t move — and Ireland are level!

A much better start to the second half by Ireland overall, and the Finns look a bit rattled.

Ogbene did well to win the free-kick from which Brady whipped in the assist.

10 OCT
9:07pm

63′ – FIN 1-1 IRE: Finland go close!

It’s a chance out of nothing, really, as the ball bobbles to Glen Kamara at the edge of the Irish area.

He takes it first-time with his instep but the ball doesn’t curl back around enough to nestle in the top right-hand corner.

A bit of a let-off for Ireland, but it would have been such an annoying goal to concede.

10 OCT
9:10pm

66′ – FIN 1-1 IRE: Big Ev is causing them hassle, throwing himself about and taking a couple of names.

You’d wonder how much he’ll have left in the tank given his lack of minutes for Brighton so far this season, but he’s actually looked sharper in the second half than he did in the first. Definitely shaking off a bit of rust as he goes.

10 OCT
9:14pm

69′ – FIN 1-1 IRE: Troy Parrot on for Ferguson. Jamie McGrath on for Azaz.

Solid shift for Ferguson, who was just getting warmed up — but obviously the data indicating his race would be run around 70 minutes.

Azaz oscillated between promising and frustrating, but it’s been that kind of game for nearly everyone to be fair.

10 OCT
9:19pm

Liam Scales’ goal, if you’re out and about.

The Celtic man’s first goal for his country.

10 OCT
9:21pm

77′ – FIN 1-1 IRE: A couple of scares for Ireland at the back. They seem intent to cause themselves a few problems which keep interrupting any glimmer of momentum. It’s incredibly annoying, to be honest with you.

The Finns are making attacking changes, with Teemu Pukki among those to enter the field.

124 caps, 42 goals for his country. Makes a fine sock, too.

10 OCT
9:24pm

80′ – FIN 1-1 IRE: Festy Ebosele on for Ogbene, Adam Idah on for Szmodics.

So, Halgrímsson is clearly going for this as well.

Big 10 minutes, now — for both sides, really. But I dare say I don’t care about Finland at all.

10 OCT
9:26pm

83′ – FIN 1-1 IRE: Ireland have lost all presence in this game since Ferguson went off.

Nothing sticking up front, or anywhere. Finns on top without causing too much ruckus.

10 OCT
9:31pm

87′ – FIN 1-1 IRE: Oh my days, Finland go so close.

Benjamin Kallman rises like a phoenix at the back post and heads across goal, taking a lick of paint off Caoimhín Kelleher’s post.

Great effort. Ireland get away with it. Need to get something going here!

10 OCT
9:32pm
GOAL FOR IRELAND! Finland 1-2 Ireland

88′ – GOOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL! FIN 1-2 IRE: ROBBIE BRAAAAAAADDDDYYYYYYYY!!!

10 OCT
9:34pm

Festy Ebosele turns the Finnish defence inside-out on the right flank! He cuts onto his left foot and floats a delightful cross towards the hosts’ back post.

It skims the head of the last defender and lands at the feet of Brady.

Perfect control. Composes himself. BOOM! BLASTS IT INTO THE ROOF OF THE NET!

IRELAND LEAD IN HELSINKI!

10 OCT
9:35pm

91′ – FIN 1-2 IRE: Parrott almost closes the show!

Ebosele again fashions the chance, squaring it to Parrott at the edge of the area.

The in-form AZ striker lashes one off his left and stings the palms of Hradecky.

Three minutes of stoppage time, of which one has already been played.

Can Ireland seal this?

10 OCT
9:37pm
Full-time: Finland 1-2 Ireland

GET IN!

IRELAND COME FROM BEHIND AT THE BREAK TO EARN THREE POINTS IN HELSINKI!

2-1! Three points on the board! And Heimir Halgrímsson is off the mark!

10 OCT
9:41pm

Yeow.

10 OCT
9:43pm
Cheers, all!

That’s it from me — thanks a mill for joining for our live updates.

David Sneyd in Helsinki is on match-report and reaction duty. There’ll also be player ratings from Paul Fennessy. Keep an eye on The 42 for all of that and more.

I’ll catch you for the next one. Take it easy!
