Despite a spirited performance, the Copper Bullets could not find the match-needed goal that would have sent them to the knockout stage, as they just needed a draw to advance.

BolaNews rates the performances of the Chipolopolo Boys in their last group match of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).

GOALKEEPER

Lawrence Mulenga (8/10): The shot-stopper was a man mountain against the Atlas Lions, as he produced six (6) impressive saves to keep Zambia in the contest.

DEFENDERS

Tandi Mwape (5/10): The defender was given the cumbersome task of marking the dribbling wizard, Soufiane Boufal. The Moroccans made life difficult for the Chipolopolo backline.

Stopilla Sunzu (7/10): Sunzu made his presence felt at the back against Morocco. The 2012 AFCON winner won more duels than any other player on the pitch (9).

Frankie Musonda (7/10): The Ayr United man made sure to snuff out any danger from Zambia’s box as Morocco were probing from all angles. He made the most clearances in the contest (6).

Lubambo Musonda (6/10): Just as in the Tanzania game, the Chipolopolo captain demonstrated that he is better suited for a full-back role than playing as a forward.

MIDFIELDERS

Miguel Changa Chaiwa (8/10): Chaiwa, Zambia’s youngest starter at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, was a breath of fresh air in Zambia’s midfield. Following his masterclass against Morocco, the teenager should be the main candidate for Zambia’s holding midfield role.

Emmanuel Banda (7/10): The midfield general pulled the strings in the middle of the park as the Chipolopolo delivered their best performance at the 2023 AFCON. No player made more final third passes in the match than the playmaker (11). He also had the most shots on target (2).

FORWARDS

Edward Chilufya (6/10): Chilufya had a very bright start to the match, but his explosiveness fizzled out as the game progressed.

Lameck Banda (7/10) : The Italian-based winger had Morocco’s defenders on string as he constantly maneuvered past them. Only Soufiane Boufal completed more dribbles than Banda.

Kennedy Musonda (6/10)
Musonda’s link-up play upfront was very crucial in most of Zambia’s dangerous attacking play.

Patson Daka (6/10): The Leicester City striker failed to punish Morocco when presented with a glorious scoring opportunity but created the joint-most chances in the match (4).

SUBSTITUTES

Kings Kangwa (5/10): The playmaker was introduced in the 71st minute after getting relegated to the substitutes bench for a poor display against Tanzania.

Fashion Sakala (5/10): Sakala couldn’t offer anything productive enough to get the goal that the Chipolopolo desperately needed.

Clatous Chota Chama (N/A): The Tanzania-based midfielder contributed to Zambia’s last push for an equalizer.

COACH

Avram Grant (8/10): Avram Grant’s Copper Bullets finally showed the quality, passion, and desire that the Zambian faithful have become accustomed to under the Israeli gaffer. The Copper Bullets now turn to the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, where a rematch with Morocco awaits in June.
