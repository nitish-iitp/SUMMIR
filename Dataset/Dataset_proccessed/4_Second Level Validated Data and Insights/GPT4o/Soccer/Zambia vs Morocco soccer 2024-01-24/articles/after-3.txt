Hakim Ziyech scored to give Morocco a 1-0 Africa Cup of Nations Group F win over Zambia on Wednesday, January 24, a result that enabled hosts Côte d'Ivoire to scrape into the last 16, after a day in which the tournament hosts sacked their coach. The Ivorians, humbled 4-0 by Equatorial Guinea on Monday, were among the four highest-ranked third-placed teams who qualified.

Group winners Morocco will face South Africa in the round of 16 while runners-up the Democratic Republic of Congo, who drew 0-0 with Tanzania, face Egypt.

Morocco coach Walid Regragui watched the match from the stand after being banned for two matches following a post-match clash with DR Congo captain Chancel Mbemba on Sunday. Regragui entered the pitch after a 1-1 draw and appeared to have strong words with Mbemba, while also attempting to shake hands. The two men then had to be separated by several people.

The Royal Moroccan Football Federation said they will appeal the suspension, calling it an "incomprehensible decision (as) Regragui did not (...) contravene the spirit of fair play."

Morocco began the final round group match already assured of a last-16 place while Zambia had to at least draw to squeeze through at the expense of Côte d'Ivoire. As anticipated, a Moroccan team ranked number one in Africa quickly established control of territory and possession in the southwestern coastal city.

Zambia survived a number of scares before finally falling behind after 38 minutes in a stadium named after deceased Ivorian football legend Laurent Pokou. Goalkeeper Lawrence Mulenga spilled a cross from Achraf Hakimi and Ziyech reacted quickest in the goalmouth and slammed the loose ball into the net.

Moroccan winger Sofiane Boufal was lectured by the Gabonese referee soon after for diving in the area, seeking a penalty. Ziyech, on loan to Istanbul outfit Galatasaray from Chelsea, did not reappear for the second half due to an injury and was replaced by Amine Adli. With 20 minutes remaining, Zambia coach and former Chelsea and West Ham United manager Avram Grant introduced Sakala and Kangwa, hoping they could boost chances of an equalizer.

DR Congo moves on

The Democratic Republic of Congo secured a spot in the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations on Wednesday thanks to a 0-0 draw with Tanzania, a result which sealed the Taifa Stars' elimination from the competition.

Yoane Wissa came closest to scoring in Korhogo in a game lacking in quality in the final third, the Brentford forward testing Aishi Manula midway through the first half and almost beating the Tanzania goalkeeper with a chip from the left-hand edge of the box late on.

DR Congo will now return to the coastal city of San-Pedro for a last-16 showdown with Egypt on Sunday. Meanwhile, Tanzania will go home after collecting just two points and finishing bottom of the group.

Tunisia eliminated

Tunisia, ranked third in Africa, meekly bowed out of the Cup of Nations after drawing 0-0 with South Africa in a poor final round Group E match in Korhogo. The North Africans had a late chance to snatch victory and survive but substitute Haythem Jouini headed a cross well over the crossbar.
