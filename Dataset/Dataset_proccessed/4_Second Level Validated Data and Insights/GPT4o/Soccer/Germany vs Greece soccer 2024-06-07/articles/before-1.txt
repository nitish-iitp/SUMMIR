Die Mannschaft to take on Greece in a friendly before their Euro 2024 opener against Scotland.

Germany takes on Greece in their final friendly game before they begin their quest for European Championship glory as the host country. The two nations meet for the first time in 12 years after Die Mannschaft claimed a 4-2 victory in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 last time. Since replacing Hansi Flick as head coach in September last year, Julian Nagelsmann has experienced a relatively mixed start to life in the German hot seat.

Nagelsmann might have taken positives from his side’s dominant showing at Max-Morlock-Stadion, but they ultimately lacked a cutting edge in the final third. They have players who are capable of making a difference, if they win in this upcoming match it will give them good confidence for sure for the big tournament ahead.

Greece are gearing up for their first fixture since March when they were eliminated from Euro 2024 qualifying following a heartbreaking penalty shootout defeat in a playoff semi-final against Georgia. The Greeks have never beaten the German team but now they will have the chance to beat them, surely it will be a very difficult task for them. The visitors will have to be at their best to get something positive from this match.

Players to Watch
Florian Wirtz (Germany)

A technically gifted player, Florian Wirtz is able to receive the ball against pressure, with a notable ability to break lines with intricate passes. He aids progression by receiving between the opposition’s defensive and midfield lines.

Wirtz is fluid in attacking areas, such as drifting wider at times. This allows him to play passes back inside. It also gives him more time compared to being central – to create with quality against low blocks. His performance will be very crucial for the German team in the upcoming tournament.

Georgios Masouras (Greece)

Georgios Masouras is one of the most lethal and dangerous players in the Greece national team, he plays as a winger and is good with both feet. Masouras does not have that fast pace which many wingers have but what he has is pure technical skills and high game intelligence.

He is also a very clinical finisher inside the box. The 30-year-old is not a selfish player and always helps out his teammates. He also does defensive work very well and will be a threat to the opposition team.
