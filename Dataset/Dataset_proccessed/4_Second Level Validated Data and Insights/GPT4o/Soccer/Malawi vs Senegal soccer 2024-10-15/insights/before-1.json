        "Needing just one more win to confirm their place in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, Senegal visit the Bingu National Stadium on Tuesday to lock horns against Malawi.",
        "Malawi, meanwhile, take to the field needing a victory to keep their already slim chances of making it through to Africa's biggest football showpiece alive.",
        "Senegal were back to their usual standards at the top end of the pitch en route to a 4-0 demolition of Malawi at Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade on Friday.",
        "Replacing the controversially sacked Aliou Cisse, caretaker manager Pape Thiaw could not have asked for a better start to life in charge as strikes from Pape Gueye, Sadio Mane, Boulaye Dia and Nicolas Jackson secured a resounding win.",
        "Picking up consecutive wins in competitive outings for the first time since January, the Lions of Teranga are now without defeat in seven matches on the bounce, recording five victories and two stalemates.",
        "Senegal have largely been defensively frugal in that time, letting in just two goals and keeping an impressive five clean sheets following their most recent shutout against Malawi.",
        "Tuesday's visitors watched Burkina Faso\u2014current leaders of Group J\u2014book their AFCON spot with a 2-0 victory over Burundi earlier today and now have the opportunity to join their fellow West Africans in the hat for next year's tournament.",
        "Malawi's crushing defeat to Senegal was the latest episode of a downward spiral which kicked off in July 2023 off the back of their COSAFA Cup exit at the hands of Lesotho.",
        "Patrick Mabedi's men have won just two of their 11 matches across all competitions since then, including defeats in each of their most recent four involvements across World Cup and AFCON qualifying duties.",
        "The Flames are yet to record a point from their three AFCON qualifying matchups and are bottom of Group L at the moment, trailing their next opponents by seven points ahead of Tuesday's affair in Lilongwe.",
        "Taking part in 1984, 2010 and 2021, Malawi have just three AFCON campaigns under their belt, and failure to come out on top against Senegal would spell the end of their aspirations to increase that tally.",
        "Tuesday's visitors have conceded 10 goals already\u2014the most in the qualifiers\u2014so any hopes of them ending their four-game winless run against Senegal will hinge on better defensive stability."
