OPTIMISTIC—The Flames
SHARE

With a battered reputation, stalked by awful displays in three consecutive matches, Malawi National Football Team go into battle against Senegal in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers hoping to redeem their pride at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe this afternoon.

Heading into the match, the Flames’ hopes of booking a ticket to next year’s Afcon final are all but over.

Burkina Faso have already qualified for the Afcon finals following a 2-0 victory over Burundi on Sunday.

This means Senegal are in pole position to take the remaining one slot in Group L.

With a win over Malawi this afternoon, the Lions of Teranga will book their place at next year’s finals—to be staged in Morocco.

In all fairness, the odds are stacked against the Flames in today’s match, having suffered a 4-0 humiliating defeat to Senegal in Dakar last Friday.

The latest loss came after they suffered 3-2 and 3-1 defeats to Burundi and Burkina Faso, respectively.

Currently ranked 133rd in the World and 39th in Africa, the Flames are under intense pressure from fans.

OPTIMISTIC—Mabedi

They need to get a positive result against star-studded Senegal to restore the bond of trust with the fans.

It has been a campaign to forget for coach Patrick Mabedi, who has only managed two victories in nine consecutive matches in all competitions since November last year.

Ahead of the match, Mabedi admitted that his charges would play for pride against Senegal on Mothers’ Day.

“It will be a different ball game against Senegal but we will play for pride against them.

“I am not a coward. I am a professional coach. There is no one who can come out of the house to lose a match when we go onto the field,” Mabedi said, adding that it was a different game and they were looking forward to competing and doing well.

On his part, Flames captain John Banda said they were geared to make the nation proud.

“We are playing for pride. This is the time to redeem ourselves,” he said.

The Flames gaffer will likely ring changes to the side that lost 4-0 on Friday.

Goalkeeper George Chikooka will be handed a starting role following the red card to Brighton Munthali.

Midfielders Chimwemwe Idana, Lloyd Aaron and Yamikani Chester are also likely to start this afternoon.

Banda will likely lead the team, with Dennis Chembezi, Nickson Mwase and Lanjesi Nkhoma likely to start the match.

Mabedi has also beefed up the squad with goalkeeper William Thole and defender Maxwell Paipi.

On the other hand, the Lions of Teranga would hope to join Burkina Faso at next year’s Afcon finals with two matches to spare.

The Lions of Teranga have rediscovered their sparkle under the tutelage of interim coach Pape Thiaw, who replaced Aliou Cisse.

“We have very good mindset in the team. We know that it will not be easy because they are playing at home and in front of the crowd. Malawi will fight to win because they want to revive their qualification hopes,” Thiew said.

Thiaw has all the weapons including Sadio Mane, Nickolas Jackson, Pape Gueye, Ismaila Sarr and captain Kalidou Koulibaly.

So far, the Flames are bottom of the group without a point from three matches.

Senegal are second in the group with seven points, three points behind leaders Burkina Faso, who have played a match more.

Burundi are third in the group with three points from four matches.
