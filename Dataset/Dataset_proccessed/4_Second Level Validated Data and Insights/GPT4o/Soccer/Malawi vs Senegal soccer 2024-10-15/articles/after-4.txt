Senegal confirmed their spot in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations tournament this week after Sadio Mane inspired his team to a tense 1-0 win against Malawi in Group L at the Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe on Tuesday afternoon.

Senegal's Kalidou Koulibaly produced one of the first attempts at goal in the 18th minute as the centre-back rose highest at a corner situation.

Let down by the missed attempt, Koulibaly’s header went wide of the mark after a telling ball into the area by El Hadji Diouf.

The Lions of Teranga continued to pile on the pressure as the first half progressed with the likes of Moussa Niakhaté and Mane eager to open the scoring.

Diouf, along with Formose Mendy, looked dangerous for Senegal after the restart while Patrick Mwaungulu produced a rare shot at goal for Malawi early on.

Senegal began to turn on the pressure after the hour mark as the likes of Pape Gueye, Nicolas Jackson and Boulaye Dia produced scoring chances in quick succession.

In search of inspiration, Mane attempted to have a go at goal with a left-footed shot inside the box in the 80th minute, however the veteran attacker missed from the mark.

Nonetheless, Mane had the last laugh in the encounter after scoring from a direct free-kick in the 96th minute of the tie.

Mane and company have now officially booked their spot in next year’s showpiece.
