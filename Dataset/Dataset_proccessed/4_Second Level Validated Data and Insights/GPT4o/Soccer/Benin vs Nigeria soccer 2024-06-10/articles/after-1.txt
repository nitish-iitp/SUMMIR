The Super Eagles on Monday suffered an embarrassing defeat to Benin in the FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifier at the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Stadium in Abidjan.

Nigeria raced into the lead through Raphael Onyedika, who scored from outside the box in the 27th minute. However, Benin hit back with two goals before halftime.

Junior Olaitan scored for the Squirrels after a defensive mix-up, and then from a corner, Steve Mounié found space in the Nigeria box to poke past Stanley Nwabali.

Despite long spells of domination in the second half, Nigeria could not find an equaliser, and Benin squeezed through for a famous win.

Super Eagles Player Ratings

Stanley Nwabali – Cannot be faulted for the goals Nigeria conceded as he also made two decent saves in the game. He showed composure when called upon but will be disappointed he did not keep a clean sheet against Benin.
7/10

Bright Osayi-Samuel – Had a poor game by his own standards. Was caught out of position a few times and also made a few unforced errors.
4/10

Calvin Bassey – Started with Semi Ajayi at centre back but later switched to left back. He was culpable in some ways for both goals. A game he will want to forget in a hurry.
4/10

Semi Ajayi – The West Brom defender was beaten for pace a few times and was caught napping for the second goal as he left Mounié open to score for Benin.
5/10

Alex Iwobi – Not a great game for Iwobi, who was supposed to be the creative spark in the middle. Made a few loose passes and failed to track back a few times when Benin attacked.
5/10

Benjamin Tanimu – The former Bendel Insurance player had a game to forget against Benin. Though he stepped up later in the game, he was found wanting a couple of times. Made a couple of wrong passes too.
6/10

Wilfred Ndidi – Captain of the side but was not at his best as Benin held sway for long periods in the game. Could have done better with releasing the ball to his attackers when there was space.
5.5/10

Ademola Lookman – Ineffective offensively and defensively as Nigeria tried to break Benin down. He held on too long to the ball when a pass would have been better. He had an off day against Benin.
5/10

Terem Moffi – Started the game in Abidjan ahead of Paul Onuachu but did not put a foot right until he was substituted. He looked leggy and heavy for most parts.
5/10

Raphael Onyedika – Probably the best Eagle on the pitch against Benin as he made a couple of decent tackles and passes to tee up Moffi and Lookman, albeit to no positive effect. Scored Nigeria’s only goal of the game.
7/10

Samuel Chukwueze – Started the game brightly but later fizzled out as Benin took the initiative. His typical burst of pace and crossing was not visible on a night the Eagles will want to forget.
5/10

Substitutes:

Paul Onuachu – Came on for Alex Iwobi but did not get the supplies he usually thrives on.
4/10

Victor Boniface – Came on for Terem Moffi but looked disinterested in the game. A couple of flashes here and there but nothing of promise.
4/10

Ibrahim Olawoyin – The former Rangers player made his debut as a sub for Samuel Chukwueze but could not help Nigeria get anything out of the game.
3/10

Ismaila Sodiq – Not the best way to make your debut as the full-back was thrust into the game for Bright Osayi-Samuel. He made a couple of crosses that were not utilised.
3/10

Alhassan Yusuf – Had probably a cameo when he came on for Wilfred Ndidi with 10 minutes left of the game. Nothing worthy of note from that to rate him.
