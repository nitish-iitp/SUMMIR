After an impressive campaign in League B a year ago, Guyana will be up against some of the more experienced sides the region has to offer in 2024-25.




The Guyanese, currently ranked 154th by FIFA, will be playing in a group with Costa Rica, Guatemala, Martinique, Guadeloupe and Suriname and will need to finish in the top two to progress to the knockout stages and in the top four to avoid relegation and earn a place in the Gold Cup qualifiers.




Under Jamal Shabazz, they won all five of their matches in League B last year and finished with a goal difference of +15, second only to Nicaragua's +16.




Guyana go into the match off the back of a 3-1 win over Belize in their last World Cup qualifier in June, which left them third in Group D, three points behind Nicaragua and Panama for a place in the third round.




Guyana have won four of their six Nations League matches at the Synthetic Track and Field Facility, including a 3-2 win over the Bahamas in their only match at Leonora last year.




In League B, the Golden Jaguars have come from behind to win three of their 2023 matches, with nine of their 15 points coming from defeat.




Suriname head into a new Nations League campaign in high spirits on the back of two convincing victories in World Cup qualifying, defeating Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (4-1) and Anguilla (4-0) to sit top of their second-round group.




Since the appointment of Stanley Menzo in March, this side have yet to lose in three matches played across all competitions, outscoring their three opponents by a combined margin of 9-2.




Natio have only suffered one defeat in their previous seven matches played across all competitions, and that 1-0 loss to Cuba on matchday two of the previous Nations League season may have cost them a place in the knockout phase, as they wound up two points below Honduras for a spot in the quarter-finals.




At this tournament a year ago, a slow start proved costly for the side from the West Indies, who failed to win their first three matches before a convincing 4-1 triumph in their final Nations League affair versus Grenada.




That victory was the only one this team have had in eight total League A fixtures, while they have yet to win a Nations League encounter outside of Suriname in the top tier.




They have triumphed in their previous two meetings with Guyana, but Suriname have not won an away match against them since June 2008, when they claimed a 2-1 victory in a World Cup qualifying fixture at Providence Stadium.




Guyana possible starting lineup:

McKenzie-Lyle; Lovell, J. Jones, Vancooten, Gordon; Ferguson, Bonds, Moriah-Welsh, Duke-McKenna; Moore, I. Jones




Suriname possible starting lineup:

Vaessen; Dijksteel, Abena, Denswil, Haps; Lonwijk, Pherai, Paal, Misidjan; Vlijter, Becker




Prediction:Guyana 0-2 Suriname
