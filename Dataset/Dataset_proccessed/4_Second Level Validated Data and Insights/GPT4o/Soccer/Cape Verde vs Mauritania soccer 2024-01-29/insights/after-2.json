        "Mendes had an early opportunity to score the opening goal, breaking through from the halfway line in the third minute, but his shot was deflected off a defender's boot and away for a corner.",
        "Six minutes later, Mendes produced a super first touch to take a long pass out of the air and in the same movement fired at goal from an angle, but was narrowly wide.",
        "Cape Verde's high pressing game put Mauritania on the back foot, but clear-cut chances were in short supply.",

        "Mauritania had an even better chance two minutes later as Amar Sidi Bouna fed Souleymane Anne who was clear on goal, but missed from close range with a left-foot effort that swerved away from the target and clipped the outside of the woodwork.",
        "Cape Verde ratcheted up the tempo, winning a series of corners in the last 15 minutes, but Niasse made some decisive saves while Cape Verde\u2019s shooting also let them down."
