        "Milestone man Sunil Chhetri will be the cynosure of all eyes as India hope to overcome their struggles in front of the goal in the return leg of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Afghanistan in Guwahati on March 26.",
        "Igor Stimac's India fired a blank in a disappointing draw in the away leg Group A match in Abha, Saudi Arabia on March 22 against their lower-ranked opponents, extending their goalless run.",
        "In this backdrop, it will be imperative from India's point of view that Chhetri, who will be appearing in his 150th international match, rises to the occasion and make his landmark game memorable at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium.",
        "Stimac has prioritised qualification to the third round of World Cup Qualifiers and secure a direct entry into the 2027 AFC Asian Cup but with his team coming off a disappointing campaign in the last continental showpiece, the Croatian will be under pressure and will want his wards to show a lot more desperation, composure and urgency upfront.",
        "India will need at least four points from their next three matches \u2013 against Afghanistan (Tuesday), Kuwait (June 6) and Qatar (June 11) to remain in control of their fate.",
        "Stimac hoped that Chhetri could make his landmark match all the more special with a performance befitting his stature in Indian football.",
        "\"Being chosen to represent your country is a dream of millions of kids when they start kicking the ball, and to make it 150 times is possible only for the GOATs (greatest of all times),\" said Stimac.",
        "\"We hope our captain will make it memorable on March 26 for all Indian fans and himself.\""
