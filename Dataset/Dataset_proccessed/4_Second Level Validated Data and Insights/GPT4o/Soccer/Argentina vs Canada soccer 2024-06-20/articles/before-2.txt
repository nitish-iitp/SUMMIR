We originally were flying to KC for the July 1 game. I had some issues at work recently and we decided to skip KC and reserved rooms in Vegas on July 5-6 and a room in Glendale on July 6. Both can be canceled.

So if USA gets first in the group, we will go to Vegas. If they get 2nd, we will play in AZ. If they don’t get out of the group, I will be glad I saved some money.

After giving up three goals in MLS play tonight I might become a Canada fan for this tournament….

I was thinking the same thing. He has them playing the "counter press" well and it's needed v Argentina. You can see the ease where Argentina can build up and create some chances, but the keeper coming off his line is aggressive and smart.

And also not afraid. Organized, smart, but unafraid

And Canada takes away the passing lanes once Argentina gets close. Give them the flanks, but cover the middle.

If they can continue to get Davies behind the defense, they will continue to get good chances.

I get frustrated watching Canada because we have more talent, but don't maximize it. They maximize their talent and strengths.

Yep had to do something. A seemingly broken play leads to a goal..
