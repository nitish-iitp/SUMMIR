The United States will once again take on the role of host of the 2024 Copa América, as announced by CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, who have reached an agreement that will benefit and breathe new life into the world’s oldest national team tournament. While the Copa is traditionally contested by the 10 CONMEBOL teams, in 2024 it was decided to create an alliance that will help strengthen soccer ties across the continent, offering opportunities for the growth and exposure of soccer in the region, which is also preparing to host the World Cup in 2026.

The Copa América will be played in 14 cities across the United States in some of the best-known and most advanced stadiums that have staged other massive events such as the Super Bowl and will also be home to the next World Cup. Here are all the details about the tournament:

When is the Copa América 2024: inauguration, group stage, quarterfinals, semifinals, third place and final?

The inauguration of the Copa América will take place on June 20, 2024 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. No details of the event have been confirmed at this time, but since Colombian singer Shakira will perform a version of her song Puntería for the Copa, there are rumors that it will be the Colombian singer who will make a special presentation before the first match of the tournament, which will be played between reigning champion Argentina and Canada.

Inauguration: June 20, 2024 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia
Group stage: June 20-July 2
Quarterfinals: July 4 to July 6
Semifinals: July 9-10 in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and Charlotte, North Carolina
Third-place game: July 13 at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C.
Copa América 2024 Final: July 14 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.
Which teams will play in the Copa América 2024?

The tournament will feature 16 teams: the 10 nations that make up CONMEBOL, and six from CONCACAF. The CONCACAF teams were decided through the 2023-2024 CONCACAF Nations League, in which the United States won first place for the third time and left Mexico in second.
