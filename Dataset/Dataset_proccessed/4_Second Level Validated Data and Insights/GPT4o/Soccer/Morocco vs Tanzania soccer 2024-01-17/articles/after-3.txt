Morocco defeated Tanzania on Wednesday in their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) opening game, topping the group with style as they scored three to secure three crucial points.

Captain Romain Saiss opened the scoreline for Morocco in the 30th minute. Azzedine Ounahi solidified Morocco’s position after scoring a second goal in the 77th goal, while  Youssef En-Nesyri brought comfort by scoring the third in the 80th minute.

The comfortable win was hardly surprising as many predictions placed Morocco as a favorite to win today’s game.

Notably, the website Opta predicted Morocco to win the game with ease.

“The Opta supercomputer is backing Morocco as firm favorites for this encounter,” the website wrote, recalling the rapid football development that the North African country has witnessed in the past decade.Moroccan cuisine

While Morocco’s Afcon record is unspectacular, having won the continental trophy only once, the Atlas Lions’ eye-catching and historic performances at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have made them most watchers’ main favorites to win this year’s continental trophy. Moroccan cuisine

But Morocco knows that being the favorite does not mean that the games will be won easily, the Atlas Lions coach said in his pre-match press conference as he reiterated his call for caution as Morocco looks to win a second continental trophy.  

“Since the start of the competition, there haven’t been any easy matches,” Head Coach Walid Regragui told the press before this evening’s statement win against Tanzania. “Our first match is important for us to enter the competitive atmosphere.”
