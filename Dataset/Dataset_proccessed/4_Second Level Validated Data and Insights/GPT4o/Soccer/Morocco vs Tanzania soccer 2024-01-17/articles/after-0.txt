Goals from Romain Saïss, Azzedine Ounahi and Youssef En-Nesyri fired Morocco to a 3-0 win against Tanzania in a one-sided Africa Cup of Nations opener.

The former Wolves defender Saïss struck in the first half but, despite their total dominance, Morocco had to wait until the unfancied Tanzanians were reduced to 10 men late in the second half before finishing them off.

While Morocco could boast players such as the Paris Saint-Germain defender Achraf Hakimi and the Manchester United midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, Tanzania started with Tarryn Allarakhia of Wealdstone in attack. The gulf in class between the World Cup semi-finalists and the minnows who have never won a match at Afcon was clear, but Morocco could not find a way through until the 30th minute.

Ibrahim Hamad’s foul on Hakim Ziyech gave the winger, on loan at Galatasaray from Chelsea, the chance to get the first shot on target of the match. Ziyech’s fierce free-kick was beaten out by Tanzania’s goalkeeper, Aishi Manula, but Saïss buried the rebound.

Ziyech, becoming increasingly influential down the right, then swung in a cross which En-Nesyri headed over before forcing a decent near-post save from Manula. As half-time approached, Abdessamad Ezzalzouli blazed over from a tight angle as Tanzania somehow made it to the break trailing only by one.

Tanzania were pushing their luck with some physical challenges and a predictable second yellow card ended Novatus Miroshi’s involvement 20 minutes from time. Morocco then doubled their lead when Ounahi played a slick one-two with the substitute Amine Adli before slotting past Manula.

Moments later Ounahi crossed for the Sevilla striker En-Nesyri to tuck in the third and ensure the Atlas Lions got off to a winning start.

The Democratic Republic of Congo squandered a number of chances in a 1-1 draw with Zambia, who took the lead thanks to quick-thinking before being swiftly pegged back in their Group F clash at the Laurent Pokou Stadium.

Kings Kangwa put Zambia ahead in the 23rd minute with an innovative effort but their neighbours equalised within four minutes through Yoane Wissa.

Zambia’s goal came against the run of play but it was smart thinking that caught the Congolese cold after their goalkeeper Lionel Mpasi came dashing off his line to try to intercept the Zambia captain, Patson Daka, down the left flank. The clash felled both players and the ball went out of play but Daka reacted quickly to take the throw-in which went back to his teammate Kangwa.

He hit it goalward from well outside the Congolese penalty area and watched in delight as it bounced between two scrambling defenders and into the empty net with Mpasi late in getting back to his goal.

But as innovative as the Zambian effort was, the response from the Congolese four minutes later was classic in its construction. Gaël Kakuta hit a perfect pass over the midfield for Cédric Bakambu to run on to and he, in turn, played his square pass with precision for Wissa to tuck away.

Meanwhile, André Onana is likely to be included in Cameroon’s lineup for their group game against the holders, Senegal, on Friday after returning to training with the team on Wednesday.

The goalkeeper missed Cameroon’s opening match of the tournament in Ivory Coast on Monday after he was allowed to stay at Manchester United and play in their 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Sunday. He flew overnight to west Africa after the match at Old Trafford but arrived only hours before the start of the Group C game against Guinea, in which Cameroon came from behind to force a 1-1 draw.

The decision to allow the 27-year-old to forgo their opening match of the tournament caused controversy among Cameroon supporters. In an interview after his arrival in Ivory Coast, Onana told reporters of the tug of loyalty between club and country, especially for African internationals forced to leave their European clubs mid-season to compete at the Cup of Nations.

“It’s like choosing between my father and my mother, but my country comes first, that’s why I’m here,” he said. “Let people continue to criticise me. I’m used to it. I do what is good for my country.”

Onana has a chequered history with Cameroon since breaking through into the team while still a teenager at Ajax. He turned down a call-up to the 2017 Cup of Nations finals, which Cameroon went on to win, and at the last World Cup in Qatar was sent home after one match after a row with the coach, Rigobert Song, which has since been patched up.
