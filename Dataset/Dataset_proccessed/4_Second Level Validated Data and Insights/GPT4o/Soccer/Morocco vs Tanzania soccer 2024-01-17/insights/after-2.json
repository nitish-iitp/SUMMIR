        "On a hot and humid evening, the game started in a relatively timid fashion which will have pleased Tanzanian manager Adel Amrouche.",

        "PLAYER OF THE MATCH \u2013 HAKIM ZIYECH (MOROCCO): Although he didn\u2019t get on the scoresheet his performance deserved one. Right from the start he was Morocco\u2019s best player and even during the slow early stages looked likely to break the deadlock. It was his free kick which set up the opener by Saiss and throughout the game he created multiple chances for his teammates. The trademark silky feet and deadly set-pieces caused numerous issues for Tanzania who simply couldn\u2019t cope with this creativity.",
