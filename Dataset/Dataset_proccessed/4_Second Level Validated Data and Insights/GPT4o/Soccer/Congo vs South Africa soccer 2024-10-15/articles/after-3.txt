South Africa’s senior men’s soccer side, Bafana Bafana, let slip a 1-0 lead as they drew 1-1 with Congo-Brazzaville in the pair’s second Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier in less than a week.

After knocking on the Congolese door a few times, the South Africans finally broke it down with just over 30 minutes played. However, after that goal, the hosts stamped their authority on the game in front of their supporters at the Alphonse Massamba-Débat Stadium in Brazzaville.

The South Africans were fortunate not to head into the halftime break trailing as the home side mounted a spirited fightback after conceding.

During that period, there were multiple warning signs for Bafana Bafana, with their defence looking less solid than it did during their rampant 5-0 win over Congo on Friday.

The Congolese were rewarded for their resilience and persistence when they equalised through Mons Bassouamina on the stroke of halftime. In the second stanza, the teams traded blows, but neither could land the knockout punch.

The display by the Congolese was particularly impressive after their shambolic showing in South Africa a few days ago.

As a result, the central Africans kept alive their slim hopes of qualifying for  Afcon 2025 in Morocco. They trail second-placed South Africa (eight points) by four points in Group K.

As for Bafana Bafana, they need one win from their final two matches of the qualifying campaign to secure passage to the next continental showpiece.

They play group leaders Uganda on 11 November, before hosting South Sudan a few days later.

Trusted soldiers

Ahead of selecting his team for this double-header against Congo, coach Hugo Broos found himself in a tight corner. He had to decide whether to select right back Khuliso Mudau and midfielder Teboho Mokoena.

Early in Mamelodi Sundowns’ Premiership campaign, the two players, whom the Belgian trusts, have found themselves out in the cold under new Masandawana head coach Manqoba Mngqithi.

The Sundowns tactician has not provided a public explanation for freezing out the pair, even though they are fit. Additionally, on their day, they have the quality to walk into the starting lineup of any team in South Africa’s top flight.

Broos trusted them to perform in these two crucial fixtures. And they did, despite their limited game time at club level.

Their performances during this window justified his decision to stick with them. However, in the long term, their absence from Sundowns’ starting lineup will force Broos to look elsewhere.

“I put my confidence in those players because I know what they are, and how good they are and how important they are for the team,” said Broos.

“I just pray that Sundowns change their mind and that the guys get an opportunity to play again. Because if [things don’t change], I will have to make decisions that I don’t like to make. Let’s hope that doesn’t happen.”  DM

Mokwena and Mudau are too useful to not be playing weekly for a club, it’s probably time to look up North in January. Bafana seem to struggle on artificial pitches, having said that Brazzaville showed character. Let’s wrap this up against Uganda.

I still maintain they need women in the side. Decades of history tell us that it would do no harm to at least try. Our best men are not inspirational. If men can compete in womens boxing at the olympics, then why cant women play for bafana bafana. Seems fair and worth a shot. Nothing else works.

If Bafana win a few games in a row, we can at least start comparing their last few decades of performance with Eskom.

I don’t think you are okay: your transphobia and just general hateful commentary signifies a need to heal. Heal mate.
