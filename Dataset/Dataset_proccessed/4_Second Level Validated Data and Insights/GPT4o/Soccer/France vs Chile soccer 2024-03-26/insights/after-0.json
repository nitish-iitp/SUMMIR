        "France forward Kylian Mbappe is expecting to be booed by his own fans when Les Bleus take the field in Marseille's home ground.",
        "Les Bleus take on Chile in an international friendly on Tuesday night, the two sides set to feature at the Stade Velodrome, the home of Ligue 1 club Marseille.",
        "Mbappe, France's captain, has conceded that he might not be welcomed by fans.",
        "Mbappe, the star of the PSG project, has historically faced hostile responses in the Velodrome, given the intense rivalry between his club and Marseille.",
        "Both he and the rest of Les Bleus' Parisian contingent are set to receive nothing less this evening - despite wearing the colours of the national team.",
        "In a press conference, Mbappe admitted it might be an uncomfortable evening: 'If I am not whistled, I will be pleasantly surprised. I know very well that I am not on conquered territory there! But I don't have a problem with it, I don't take it personally. I understand too. Even if it's the selection, I remain a PSG player, I don't expect the red carpet to be rolled out for me. They know very well that this is not going to change the way I play.'"
