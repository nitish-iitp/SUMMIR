Preview: Algeria vs. South Africa - prediction, team news, lineups

In their final warm-up friendly before returning to the World Cup qualifiers, Algeria and South Africa go head to head at the Stade Nelson Mandela on Tuesday.

This will be the first meeting between the two nations since January 2015, when the Desert Warriors picked up a comfortable 3-1 victory in the group stages of the Africa Cup of Nations.

Algeria turned in an attacking show of class on Friday as they secured a thrilling 3-2 victory over South American side Bolivia when the sides met at the Stade Nelson Mandela.

After falling behind to Amine Gouiri's 43rd-minute strike, Carmelo Algaranaz and Jose Sagredo found the target to put Bolivia ahead, but Yassine Benzia levelled matters in the 79th minute before Villarreal man Aissa Mandi completed the comeback with a 94th-minute strike.

This followed a forgettable run in the Africa Cup of Nations earlier in the year, when Algeria suffered a group-stage exit after picking up just two points from their three matches in Group D.

The Desert Warriors' woeful run in Ivory Coast was a repeat of their 2021 embarrassment when they floundered in their title defence, crashing out in the group stages with just one point from three matches.

Vladimir Petkovic's side will head into Tuesday's tie looking to pick up where they left off against Bolivia as they gather momentum ahead of their return to the World Cup qualifiers, where they have flown out of the blocks in Group G.

Algeria kicked off their quest for a place in the 2026 World Cup with a 3-1 victory over Somalia on November 16, three days before picking up a 2-0 win against Mozambique courtesy of goals from Fares Chaibi and Ramiz Zerroouki.

South Africa, on the other hand, enjoyed an impressive outing at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations as they clinched third place — their highest finish in the continental tournament since also securing the bronze medal back in 2000.

After finishing as runners-up in Group E, goals from Evidence Makgopa and Teboho Mokoena fired the Bafana Bafana to a 2-0 victory over Morocco in the round-of-16 on January 30, four days before they saw off Cape Verde on penalties in the quarter-finals.

A penalty-shootout defeat against West African powerhouse Nigeria saw South Africa's dreams for a first AFCON final appearance since 1998 come to an end on February 7, three days before beating Congo DR in the third-placed playoff.

Hugo Broos's men, who are 58th in the latest FIFA World Rankings, head into Tuesday's game off the back of a 1-1 draw with Andorra in the first of their two friendlies before returning to the World Cup qualifiers.

The 1996 African champions have enjoyed a decent start to their World Cup qualifying campaign, claiming three points from their opening two matches to sit second in Group C, one point behind first-placed Rwanda.

While South Africa will be looking to return to winning ways on Tuesday, they will have to show their mettle against an opposing side who are unbeaten in each of their last three meetings, claiming one win and two draws since a 2-1 loss in January 1996.

Borussia Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini was forced off inside the opening 19 minutes against Bolivia last time out and the 28-year-old is a major for Algeria.

In his absence, Esperance Tunis man Mohamed Tougai will push for a place in the XI, forming the back four with Youcef Atal, Mandi and Wolverhampton Wanderers man Rayan Ait-Nouri.

With his strike on Saturday, Gouiri now has five goal involvements in his last six games for club and country and we expect the Rennes striker to spearhead Algeria's attack once again.

Off the back of a solid team display against Andorra, Broos could name a similar side on Tuesday, with Mokwana, Khanyisa Erick Mayo and Orlando Pirates man Patrick Maswanganyi retaining their roles in the final third.

Veteran midfielder Thabang Monare should team up with 24-year-old Goodman Mosele in the centre of the park, while Thapelo Morena, Nkosinathi Sibisi, Tapelo Xoki and Terrence Mashego should form the back four once again.


Algeria possible starting lineup:
Mandrea; Atal, Mandi, Tougai, Ait-Nouri; Chaibi, Bentaleb, Zerrouki, Brahimi; Bounedjah, Gouiri

South Africa possible starting lineup:
Goss; Morena, Sibisi, Xoki, Mashego; Mbanjwa, Mosele, Monare; Mokwana, Maswanganyi, Mayo


We say: Algeria 2-1 South Africa

Algeria made light work of Bolivia last time out and will head into Tuesday's game with sky-high confidence. While South Africa's home advantage gives them a slight edge, Petkovic's men boast a stronger squad on paper and we see them coming away with the desired result at the Stade Nelson Mandela.
