FECAFOOT vs Ministry: Cameroon Team Faces Confusion Before Namibia Match

As Cameroon prepares to host Namibia on September 7, 2024, for the first match of the CAN Morocco 2025 qualifiers, the national team is caught in a dispute between FECAFOOT and the Ministry of Sports. The two parties disagree not only on the choice of the stadium but also on the location for the players’ assembly.

The players are caught between two conflicting flight plans, one from the coordinator of selections appointed by FECAFOOT and the other from the national team coordinator appointed by the government.

“I personally received two flight plans, one asking me to land in Douala and the other saying my destination is Yaoundé. This situation is embarrassing,” one of the 24 players called up by coach Marc Brys told Équinoxe TV and radio. Two other players also confirmed receiving two flight plans.

The first players have already arrived in Cameroon and are awaiting the start of the preparatory camp, scheduled for September 2. However, uncertainty looms over the assembly location. With the players’ meeting starting tomorrow, we will finally know which city will host the Indomitable Lions’ camp.
