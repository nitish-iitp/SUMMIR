Cameroon and Namibia get their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign underway when they go head to head at the Roumde Adjia Stadium on Saturday.

Both sides, who also met in the 2023 AFCON qualifiers last year, have been drawn in Group C and will battle Kenya and Zimbabwe for a place in Morocco next year.

Cameroon were denied a second consecutive victory in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Angola at the Estadio 11 de Novembro on June 11.

Brentford forward Bryan Mbuemo gave the visitors a dream start to the game as he netted in the 11th minute to put them in front but veteran defender Michael Ngadeu inadvertently turned the ball into his own net in the 54th minute to force a share of the spoils.

Having suffered a group-stage exit in Qatar two years ago, Cameroon have now picked up two wins and two draws in their four World Cup qualifying matches to sit top of Group D, one point above second-placed Libya in the playoff spot.

Marc Brys's men, who are currently 51st in the latest FIFA World Rankings, will now look to build on their result against Angola as they begin their quest for a fifth consecutive appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations.

The Indomitable Lions flattered to deceive in the 2023 AFCON where they finished second in Group C with four points from three matches before suffering a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Nigeria in the round of 16 on January 27.

While Cameroon will look to kick off their quest for a place in Morocco as they mean to go on, they failed to win their last two games against Saturday's visitors, losing once and claiming one draw in their two encounters in the 2023 AFCON qualifiers last year.

Namibia, on the other hand, were outclassed and outplayed by Angola in the 2024 COSAFA Cup final as they suffered a 5-0 thrashing against the Black Sable Antelopes at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on July 7.

In a game where Ivan Kamberipa received his marching orders, Vidinho and Pedro Bondo both scored twice, with Gil Vicente striker Depu also hitting the target to fire Angola to their fourth COSAFA Cup crown.

Prior to that, Namibia were on a six-match unbeaten run across all competitions, picking up three wins and three draws, including successive stalemates against Liberia and Tunisia in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Collin Benjamin's side have enjoyed an impressive run in the World Cup qualifiers, claiming two wins and two draws from their four matches in Group H to collect eight points and sit second in the table, two points behind first-placed Tunisia.

Following their round-of-16 exit in Ivory Coast earlier in the year, the Brave Warriors will now look to out their COSAFA Cup disappointments behind them and kick off their hunt for back-to-back AFCON appearances on a positive note.

Namibia picked up four points from a possible nine in Group E of the 2023 AFCON to finish as one of the best third-placed sides before they were thrashed 3-0 by Southern African rivals Angola in the round of 16 on January 27.

Cameroon have called up 24 players for September's qualifiers, with the likes of Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa, Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana and veteran forward Vincent Aboubakar headlining the team.

Aboubakar, who is currently third in the nation's all-time scoring chart with 39 goals in 102 caps, should lead the attack once again, alongside Mbuemo and Ankaragucu forward Christian Bassogog.

Carlos Baleba started the game against Angola last time out and the Brighton and Hove Albion man could retain his role in the centre of the park, teaming up with Napoli's Anguissa and 26-year-old Martin Hongla.

Namibia have named a 25-man squad for the upcoming games against Cameroon and Kenya, with Brys retaining the majority of the players called up for the COSAFA Cup earlier in the year.

Edmar Kamatuka, Bethuel Muzeu and 27-year-old Erastus Kulula started the game against Angola last time out and should lead the Brave Warriors' attack while Aprocius Petrus and Romeo Kasume should team up at the centre of the park.

At the defensive end of the pitch, Tjipe Karuuombe, Charles Hambira, Tuli-Ngenovali Nashixwa and Kamberipa should form the back four once again shielding Kamaijanda Ndisiro between the sticks.


Cameroon possible starting lineup:
Onana; Tolo, Wooh, Ngadeu, Tchatchoua; Baleba, Anguissa, Hongla; Aboubakar, Mbuemo, Bassogog

Namibia possible starting lineup:
Ndisiro; Karuuombe, Kamberipa, Hambira, Nashixwa; Shidolo, Petrus, Kasume; Kalula, Kamatuka, Muzeu


We say: Cameroon 2-0 Namibia

Following July's COSAFA Cup heartbreak, Namibia will head into the weekend looking to restore some pride and begin their quality journey on a high. However, Cameroon boast the firepower needed to get the job done and we are tipping them to secure all three points on home soil.
