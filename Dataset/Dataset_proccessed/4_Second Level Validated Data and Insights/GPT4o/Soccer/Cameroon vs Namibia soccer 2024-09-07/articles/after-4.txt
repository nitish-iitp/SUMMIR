As the qualifiers for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations continue, controversies have emerged over the location of the match and the training arrangements of the Cameroonian national team. The Cameroon Football Federation (FECAFOOT) eventually received approval from the country’s Prime Minister to hold the match against Namibia on Saturday, September 7th, in Garoua.

This decision initially appeared to signal a truce between the Minister of Sports and FECAFOOT President Samuel Eto’o. However, just hours before the kickoff, the conflict remains unresolved, further fueled by the contentious appointment of Belgian coach Marc Brys as head of the Indomitable Lions.

On Friday, when tensions between Marc Brys and FECAFOOT seemed to have temporarily subsided, the federation reignited the dispute. FECAFOOT, through a court-appointed bailiff, issued a formal notice to the Belgian coach, demanding that he hand over the players’ passports to the coordinators designated by Samuel Eto’o.

During a pre-match press conference, the decision to host the match in Garoua was addressed. Marc Brys defended the choice, stating that the Roumdé Adjia Stadium met all the necessary requirements for a quality match. “The only parameters I need are security and the condition of the pitch. Both are satisfactory, which is why we decided to come here,” Brys explained.

Regarding the choice of the team’s training base, FECAFOOT initially chose Douala, but Marc Brys opted for Yaoundé, where the entire squad eventually gathered. Goalkeeper André Onana described the team’s reaction as a professional response: “We remain professional. Hierarchically, our leader is the coach. We have no bias. The most important thing is playing for Cameroon. We know why we are here. Tomorrow, we aim to win.”

The last two encounters between the two teams ended in a draw and a victory for Namibia.

As the match approaches, the ongoing disputes between FECAFOOT and the government continue to cast a shadow over the proceedings, leaving fans and players alike wondering how these tensions will affect the Indomitable Lions’ performance on the field.
