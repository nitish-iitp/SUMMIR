2025 NHL Winter Classic between Blackhawks and Blues could be…

Weather conditions don't look ideal as of now for the 2025 NHL Winter Classic, which means there is a chance the game could get rescheduled to a new date. No strangers to outdoor games, the Chicago Blackhawks have faced off against the Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, Washington Capitals, Minnesota Wild, and St. Louis Blues in previous match-ups. This time, the Blackhawks will renew that rivalry with the Blues at Wrigley Field after their 2017 meeting at Busch Stadium. The Blackhawks lost that one 4-1 to Alex Pietrangelo and the Blues in a very feisty affair. But could winter weather disrupt what promises to be another classic clash between these rivals, whose history dates back to 1967? According to Ben Pope of the 'Chicago Sun-Times', the forecast is less than ideal for hockey, with potential snow and even rain threatening the event. With the Blackhawks set to welcome the Blues, and star forward Jordan Kyrou, to Wrigleyville, the game represents the team's seventh outdoor appearance. If the weather cooperates, it could be an opportunity for Connor Bedard and the Blackhawks to notch their second-ever outdoor win. The Blackhawks enter this one at 1-5-0 outdoors, but a win in Chicago would put them at 2-1-0 at home. Hopefully, the weather cooperates!

Klay Thompson Clarifies His Stance On Stephen Curry After Calling…

Dallas Mavericks sharpshooter Klay Thompson recently caught some heat for snubbing his former teammate, Stephen Curry, from his rightful title as the greatest shooter ever. At the time, Thompson said Reggie Miller was the best, but he has since clarified his stance in response to a fan on social media. Fan: "We love you in the Bay, Steph the greatest shooter of all time, you know that bruh!" Klay Thompson: "My man lemme clarify. I wrote this caption with my childhood in mind. At the time Reggie was the standard for off-guards and ball movement along with shot-making. We all know 30 is the GOAT shooter." Warriors fans felt betrayed when Klay alluded to Reggie as the greatest shooter ever, but Thompson didn't mean it as they thought. Growing up in the 90s, Klay didn't get to watch guys like Stephen Curry or Damian Lillard flash their ridiculous range. Instead, it was people like Reggie Miller, Glen Rice, and Mitch Richmond who dominated from the perimeter. Over his 18 years in the NBA, Reggie Miller set the ultimate standard for three-point shot-making with averages of 18.2 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game on 47.1% shooting. He made 2,560 threes in his career and shot a respectable 39.5%. In those days, perimeter play wasn't nearly as developed and three-pointers were usually taken in moderation throughout the games. Miller broke all the norms at the time by not only shooting with high volume but also knowing them down consistently enough to be effective on the court. Recently, after passing Miller on the All-Time threes list (Thompson is now 5th all-time with 2,563), he felt compelled to honor the legend in some way, which is why he wrote that caption calling him the greatest shooter. In reality, we all know that title belongs to Curry. As his teammate for 11 years, Thompson knows that more than anyone and he's standing by it today. Besides being first on the NBA's all-time threes list (3,849), Curry boasts an impressive career stat line of 24.7 points, 6.4 assists, and 4.7 rebounds per game on 47.2% shooting. As a 10x All-Star, 10x All-NBA player, 4x champion, 2x scoring leader, and 2x MVP, Steph is undoubtedly one of the greatest point guards ever, and his mastery of the three-pointer has changed the game to a massive degree. From 2015-2019, Curry and Thompson dominated the league together as a ridiculous shooting tandem. They formed a dynasty with Draymond Green and head coach Steve Kerr, who helped lead the team to four championships in eight seasons, including five consecutive Finals appearances. Today, at 36 years old, Curry is still making his mark, even if it's without his longtime Splash Bro. In 24 games this season, No. 30 is averaging 22.5 points, 6.5 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per game on 44.4% shooting. He's single-handedly keeping the Warriors afloat, who currently rank 11th in the West at 15-15. Tonight, the Warriors have a matchup against the Phoenix Suns at 8:30 PM EST at Footprint Center. On Monday, December 30th, they play the Cleveland Cavaliers at Chase Center before a game against the Philadelphia 76ers at home again on Thursday, January 2nd, at 10:00 PM EST.

Iowa State HC Matt Campbell disagrees with take on program's first…

The No. 18 Iowa State Cyclones may have come up short in the Big 12 championship game, but the team won 10 games for the first time in the program's 133-year history. That's a remarkable achievement for any program that's existed for that long. So, head coach Matt Campbell doesn't want to hear anybody calling his team's season a disappointment. At a news conference Friday ahead of the Cyclones' appearance in the Pop Tarts Bowl against No. 13 Miami, Campbell joined opposing head coach Mario Cristobal to answer questions from reporters. Campbell was asked how he would address those criticizing the team's failure to win the Big 12 and qualify for the College Football Playoff. "I would say I chuckle at that comment, to be quite honest with you," he responded sharply. "To say something like that, you know, is ridiculous." Campbell cited Iowa State's two Big 12 Championship Game appearances in the last four seasons and his team's historic 10-win season as reasons to be proud. "Nobody ever thought that was even possible at Iowa State," Campbell said. The Cyclones were trounced 45-19 by eventual champion Arizona State in Dallas and will now instead face Miami on Saturday in Orlando. The Hurricanes suffered a similar fate in the ACC with a late-season stumble that cost them a shot at a national championship. Iowa State has never qualified for the College Football Playoff, but this year was the closest it came with the introduction of the new 12-team format. Campbell has proven in recent years that he's built a competitive program in Ames, one that will continue to threaten for the league title in seasons to come.

Raiders HC Antonio Pierce dismisses report about job status

The future of Antonio Pierce as the Las Vegas Raiders head coach remains unclear following a 25-10 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Sunday that Pierce's future as the Raiders coach is "in serious doubt." It is expected that Mark Davis will take his time and make a decision after the season with input from minority owner Tom Brady, Pelissero said. Following the win over the Saints, The Athletic's Vic Tafur asked Pierce about his future with the Raiders and if the players made a statement with the win. "I have no comment on that," Pierce said. Many players vouched for Pierce to be the head coach following last season's 8-9 record. Players such as Maxx Crosby, Josh Jacobs and Davante Adams put their stamp of approval for the hire. Jacobs, however, signed a free-agent contract with the Green Bay Packers and Adams was traded to the New York Jets in October. That leaves Crosby, who recently said he wants to win now. The Raiders (4-12) started the season 2-2 but lost 10 straight until defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 19-14 on Dec. 22. Las Vegas began the season with Gardner Minshew as the starting quarterback, but O'Connell got the start after Minshew (collarbone) was injured on Nov. 24. O'Connell has seen a different side of the Raiders. "We could've thrown in the (towel) a long time ago," O'Connell told reporters. "Guys are just hungry. I think it speaks to the locker room we have of players that want to play hard, that want to work hard. Just go out there and try to win. We had some heartbreaking losses for sure, and I think it's just going to fuel us." The Raiders conclude the 2024 NFL season at Allegiant Stadium against the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers. Afterward, it's anyone's guess what will happen to Pierce.
