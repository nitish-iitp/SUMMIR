Rival in the group

Mozambique 

On Independence Day 1975, Mozambique played its first match, a friendly against Zambia, and won 2-1. Two years later, Cuba became the first non-African opponent when the two countries met in a match that Cuba won 2-0. Mozambique qualified for the World Cup for the first time in the 1982 qualifying round. Mozambique was defeated 7-3 in the two matches by Zaire in the first round. 

Mozambique qualified for its first African Cup of Nations in 1986. In the qualifying round, they beat Mauritius, Malawi (on penalties) and finally Libya, winning again on penalties. In the final tournament, held in Egypt, Mozambique qualified for Group A, along with Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire and hosts Egypt. They were defeated 3-0, 2-0 and 2-0, without scoring a goal. 

After being absent for 12 years from Africa Cup of Nations soccer, Mozambique was placed in Group C with Egypt, Nigeria and Benin. In their first match, they played Benin and drew 2-2 after trailing 2-0, with goals from Miro and Fumo. They then lost 2-0 to eventual tournament winners Egypt and 3-0 to Nigeria, which eliminated them from the tournament. After the tournament, the all-time leading scorer and captain Tico-Tico retired from international soccer. 

Mozambique has yet to reach a fifth Africa Cup of Nations final despite several near misses. During the 2013 qualifiers, they reached the final round and beat Morocco 2-0 in the first leg in Maputo. However, they were defeated 4-0 in Marrakech four days later. In the 2019 qualifiers, the Mambas were only beaten by an injury-time equalizer from Guinea-Bissau at the end of their final Group K match.

Mali national football team.

Mali is a major powerhouse in youth football both in Africa and around the world, having never qualified for any World Cup as a senior national team in its history. They have qualified for the African Cup of Nations on 13 occasions, consecutively since 2008. And their greatest achievement has been the runner-up position in the 1972 African Cup of Nations.

The Republic of Mali played its first match after its independence on 22 September 1960 against Nigeria. On 8 November 1960 they won in Lagos by 3-1.

Finalist in the 1963 Kwame Nkrumah Cup, they lost 4-0 to Ghana in Accra,1 after having eliminated Senegal on 24 February 1963 in the first match between the two teams after the separation of the Mali Federation, which took place on 19 August 1960. In that team were Ousmane Traoré "Ousmanebléni", Abdoulaye Diawara "Blocus", goalkeeper Abdoulaye Traoré "Elastic".2

Later, Mali participated for the first time in the qualification for the 1965 African Cup of Nations,3 sharing a group with Guinea and Senegal, their absolute debut in an official competition was with a defeat against Senegal, at home; later they would lose again against their counterpart by 3-1 away, Salif Keïta scored Mali's first goal in an official competition; On May 23, 1965, Mali achieved its first official victory by 2-0 over Guinea, only to lose 2-1 to Guinea, finishing last in its group.
