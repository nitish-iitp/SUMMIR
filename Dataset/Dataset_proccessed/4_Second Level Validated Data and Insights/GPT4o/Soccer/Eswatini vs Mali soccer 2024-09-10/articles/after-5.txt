ESWATINI AND MALI PREDICTS A TOUGH MATCH IN MBOMBELA
SEPTEMBER 10, 202415350

The Eswatini Senior Men’s national team (Sihlangu SeMnikati) assistant coach, Sifiso Ntibane and Mali Head Coach Tom Saintfiet predicts a tough match when the two national teams play on Tuesday, 10th September 2024 at the Mbombela Stadium in the TotalEnergies AFCON Qualifiers. “Mali have good players who play in big leagues which testifies about their quality”, Ntibane said. Having said that, the coach highlighted that the players are motivated in as far as this fixture is concerned. “The players are motivated in playing against Mali which is one of the big football national in Africa,” Ntibane said. Eswatini has been shy in front of goal in recent matches which is something that bothers the technical bench of Sihlangu SeMnikati. “In recent matches, we have been creating a lot of goal scoring opportunities; however, what bothers us is that we were not converting those chances into goals”, Ntibane said.

The head coach of the Malian National Team, Tom Saintfield. is also conscious in as far as the TotalEnergies AFCON match against Eswatini is concerned. “Eswatini is a good national team as they only suffered narrow defeats against Eswatini is concerned. “Eswatini is a good team as they only suffered narrow defeats against Guinea Bissau and Angola in recent matches. This is not an easy opponent. They have good players like Justice Figueredo who plays in the Betway Premiership in the Betway Premiership in the elite football league in the Republic of South Africa”, Saintfield said.
