Petros Mantalos (7/10): Distributed the ball to his teammates up front and open spaces with his accurate passes.

Goalkeeper

Lukas Hradecky (5.9/10): Not his best performance by Hradecky considering the amount of goals he conceded.

Defenders

Robert Ivanov (6.8/10): Did his best to protect the box but Greece was so effective with the chances.

Midfielders

Topi Keskinen (6.5/10): Came with an expectation of scoring a goal but didn’t happen.

Joel Pohjanpalo (6.8/10): Failed to deliver his performance as Findland needed a goal badly when left behind with two goals.

Leo Walta (6.5/10): Couldn’t make any significant impact on the team as he only played eight minutes in normal time.
