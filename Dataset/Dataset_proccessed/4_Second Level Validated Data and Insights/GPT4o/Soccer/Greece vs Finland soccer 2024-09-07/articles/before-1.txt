Greece vs Finland
UEFA Nations League
Preview
Tournament: UEFA Nations League
Date: Saturday, Sep 07
Kick-off Time: 06:45 pm GMT
Venue: Karaiskakis Stadium, Greece

The UEFA Nations League is scheduled to kick off, and two teams from League B Group 2, Greece and Finland are about to lock horns. The game will be hosted by Greece, who will play in League B for the first time, after getting promotion from the third tier in 2022.

It’s a start from scratch for Greece, who went through a devastating Euro 2024 qualifier, where Georgia shocked them. The side seems good to go under new coach Ivan Jovanovic. They will look to leave a mark in their first appearance in League 2, after three attempts to get through the third tier.

Finland also looks evenly fine for the fixture, having won in six of their last 10 competitive games. The side will also look to target three points but will enter as underdogs while facing a stronger home side.
