Zambia's match against Tanzania

Rabat - The nail-biting Africa Cup of Nations Sunday encounter between Zambia and Tanzania ended in a thrilling 1-1 equalizer, with the highlight of the match taking place in the dying minutes as Patson Daka's header secured a much-needed point for Zambia.

The 89th minute proved to be the turning point of the match when Zambia’s Clatous Chama delivered a precision cross from a corner kick, finding the head of Patson Daka in the left side of the box. 

Daka’s powerful header soared into the high center of the goal, bringing the game to a tie.

Tanzania had taken the lead earlier in the 11th minute with Simon Msuva’s clinical finish, but Zambia’s late equalizer showcased their resilience and determination to salvage a point.

The closing minutes witnessed heightened action, with both teams pushing for a decisive goal. Zambia’s Kennedy Musonda attempted a shot that was blocked by the Tanzanian defense, while substitutions were made on both sides in a strategic bid to secure victory.

Despite the efforts of both teams to secure a late winner, the match ended with a 1-1 draw. 

While Zambia and Tanzania walked away with a point each in the Africa Cup of Nations Group F encounter, Zambia remains third in the group, while Tanzania's chances at moving to the next round are looking doubtful.
