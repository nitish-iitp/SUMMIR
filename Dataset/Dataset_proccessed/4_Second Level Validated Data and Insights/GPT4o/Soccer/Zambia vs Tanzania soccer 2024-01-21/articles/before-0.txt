The second round of matches in Group F at the Africa Cup of Nations will see Zambia taking on Tanzania at Stade de San Pedro on Sunday afternoon.

Tournament favourites Morocco have shot off to lead the group after the first round of matches and they will take on second-placed Congo DR at this venue earlier in the day.

Zambia were making a comeback after missing the last three editions of the AFCON and sought their first win at the tournament since their surprising triumph in 2012 when they took the field against Congo DR on Wednesday.

However, a win proved to be too much to ask as Chipolopolo had major difficulty creating goal-scoring opportunities in their first match of the competition, registering only three shots against Congo DR, but they did manage to secure a valuable point with a 1-1 draw.

Avram Grant's team went ahead in the first half of that match as Kings Kangwa cleverly scored from 25 yards, taking advantage of Lionel Mpasi being off his line after attempting to tackle Patson Daka.

The draw between the former African champions came after heavily fancied Group F rivals Morocco started their campaign with a convincing 3-0 victory over 10-man Tanzania at the same stadium.

While their opening fixture may not have ended in victory, Chipolopolo will know that this is their opportunity to take all three points against an opponent that they have not lost to in their last four meetings, winning on two occasions and drawing the other two.

Few had given Tanzania much of a chance in their tournament opener against Morocco, but what was most concerning was just how toothless they were in attack across the entire 90 minutes.

The Taifa Stars managed only two touches in Morocco's box on the day, marking their lowest tally in an Africa Cup of Nations match, and it was also the lowest among all teams in the first round of matches.

After slumping to defeat, Tanzania are still in search of their first-ever win in AFCON history, having lost six and drawn one of the seven games they have played in the competition.

Adding to the woes for Tanzania, Adel Amrouche has now been suspended by the Tanzania Football Federation for eight matches after a complaint was submitted by Morocco claiming that the Taifa Stars boss had made insulting remarks about the Atlas Lions.

As a consequence of Amrouche's suspension, Hemed Morocco has been appointed as Tanzania's acting coach for the remainder of the tournament, and he will be assisted by Juma Mgunda.

Team News

Zambia came away from their opening match of the competition with no injury concerns, and considering the solid performances they put on, it would not be surprising to see the same 11 take the field on Sunday.

Grant made only two changes in the first match, bringing on Lameck Banda and Larry Bwalya, and if the former Chelsea boss does opt to make any changes in this one, Silkeborg's Lubambo Musonda will likely be the one to make way, having been withdrawn early in the last match.

In the opposite dugout, Tanzania will not only be without their head coach but will also have to make do without Novatus Miroshi, who was sent off in the final 20 minutes against Morocco on Wednesday.

Morice Abraham will likely replace Miroshi in the three-man midfield alongside Himid Mao Mkami and Mudathiri Yahya, while Simon Msuva will be pushing for a starting role after coming off the bench in the last match.


Zambia possible starting lineup:
Mulenga; Mwape, Sunzu, Musonda, Kabwe; Kapumbu, Musonda, Kangwa, Banda; Sakala, Daka

Tanzania possible starting lineup:
Manula; Mnoga, Nondo, Hamad, Mohamed; Yahya, Mkami, Abraham; Samatta, M'Mombwa, Msuva



We say: Zambia 1-0 Tanzania

While Zambia were far from impressive in attack in their first match, their defensive solidity was commendable, and they will likely prioritise keeping a clean sheet in this match against a Tanzania attack that lacks genuine firepower. This has the feel of a low-scoring, tactical match, and we feel that the first goal will likely end up being the winner.
