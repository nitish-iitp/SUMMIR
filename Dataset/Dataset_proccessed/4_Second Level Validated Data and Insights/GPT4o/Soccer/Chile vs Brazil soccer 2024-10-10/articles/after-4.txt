SAO PAULO — An 89th-minute goal by substitute Luiz Henrique gave Brazil a much-needed 2-1 away win over Chile in a World Cup qualifying match. Brazil, under coach Dorival Júnior, will finish the ninth round of the round-robin South American competition in fourth place. Earlier, Lionel Messi's Argentina drew Venezuela 1-1 in a match that was delayed for 30 minutes due to a wet pitch at Monumental Stadium in the Venezuelan city of Maturin. Argentina, which leads the 10-team competition, now has 19 points after nine matches. Colombia, with 16 points, remains in second place after losing 1-0 at Bolivia.
