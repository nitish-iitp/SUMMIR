Last-gasp Luiz Henrique effort gives Brazil win at Chile
ByReuters
Updated: Oct 11, 2024, 05:03 am

Lacklustre Brazil pulled off a last-gasp 2-1 away victory over Chile in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Thursday, thanks to a goal by substitute Luiz Henrique in the 89th minute.

Off the back of a disappointing loss to Paraguay and losing four of their last five qualifiers with a series of poor performances, Brazil had to recover from a goal down as Eduardo Vargas put the locals in front with a fine header from a Felipe Loyola cross in the second minute.

Chile wasted chances to extend their lead, but Brazil managed to find the equaliser in added time before the break, when Savinho made a good run down the right and crossed to Igor Jesus who nodded a towering header past the goalkeeper, scoring on his first call-up for the national team.

Brazil controlled the second half and found a duly deserved winner late with a fine effort by Jesus' teammate at Brazilian league leaders and Copa Libertadores semi-finalists Botafogo Luiz Henrique, who slotted a curling strike from the edge of the box to rescue the five-time World Cup champions three much needed points.

The victory lifted Brazil to fourth in the standings with 13 points, two behind Uruguay and eight from leaders Argentina. Chile are second from bottom on five points.

Earlier on Thursday, leaders Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw against Venezuela in Lionel Messi's return to international duty from an injury.

The Argentine captain brilliantly assisted Nicolás Otamendi on a drenched pitch to open the scoring 13 minutes after kick-off, but a relentless Venezuela fought back to equalise with a Salomón Rondón's header in the second half.

In-form Bolivia grabbed a gritty 1-0 win, their third successive victory, handing second-placed Colombia their first loss in the qualifiers.

Trying to end a 13-game winless run against their opponents, Bolivia started well but had to play most of the game with 10 men as Héctor Cuéllar was sent off with a straight red card for bringing striker Roger Martinez down as the last man in the 20th minute.

However, the fierce locals managed to find the winner in a stunning strike by Miguel Terceros, who dominated near the right touchline, cutting inside to beat two Colombian defenders before unleashing a fine left-footed strike that flew into the top-left corner in the 58th minute.

Argentina are on top of the standings on 19 points, three ahead of Colombia and four from third-place Uruguay, who have a game in hand and will face last-placed Peru on Friday.

Brazil climbed to fourth, leapfrogging Ecuador, who are in fifth place on 12 points following a goalless draw against Paraguay.

Bolivia are behind Ecuador on goal difference in sixth, followed by Venezuela with a point behind in seventh. Only the top six are guaranteed a berth at the 2026 finals.
