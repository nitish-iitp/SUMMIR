Intercontinental Cup 2024: Manolo Marquez makes tepid start as India plays out goalless draw against Mauritius

Manolo Marquez had a tepid start to his career as India coach since his boys played out a goalless draw against Mauritius in their Intercontinental Cup 2024 opener at the G. M. C. Balayogi Athletic Stadium here on Tuesday. 

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 21:25
FULL-TIME

Three minutes added

Just a few more minutes to go. India has the ball now, trying to get that one decisive move.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 21:19
87’- IND 0-0 MRI; Time running out

Streaks of blue can be seen going up the field but getting stopped in its tracks with blots of red on the field. Time is running our for both sides to score a winner. Mauritius has been resolute in its defence.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 21:11

Jay Gupta’s minutes come to an end in this match as Subasish Bose comes on.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 21:00
67’- IND 0-0 MRI; Substitutes combining well for Mauritius

Botlar’s cross into the box doesn’t face any impediment as it easily finds Mathieu who goes for a first-time shot, but skies it over the crossbar.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:58
66’- IND 0-0 MRI; Manolo makes another change

Apuia off for Suresh in the midfield.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:55
63’- IND 0-0 MRI; Mauritius creating more chances

Second half has seen a much more pro-active Mauritian side, which has won a number of set pieces and even forced Amrinder to make saves and spring to action. India, as of now, with its back to the wall.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:48
55’- IND 0-0 MRI; Changes for Mauritius

Adrien and Lalsingh come off for Botlar and Mathieu.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:43
India players warming up

Kiyan Nassiri and Subasish Bose are seen warming up on the sidelines. We can expect more changes from Manolo soon.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:38
46’- IND 0-0 MRI; Chhangte with the after-burners!

Right at the off in the second half, India looks to score the first goal at the earliest as Chhangte runs down the right flank and flicks it inside the box but the Mauritian goalkeeper gets a big glove to it.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:37
Second half underway

With some fresh legs on the pitch, India gets the second half going against Mauritius at the GMC Balayogi Stadium in the Intercontinental Cup in Hyderabad.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:34
Changes for India

Thapa and Liston will make way for Sahal Abdul Samad and Nandhakumar Sekar respectively.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:20
HALFTIME
HALFTIME; IND 0-0 MRI

That was a lukewarm start from Manolo Marquez’s first starting XI as India and Mauritius go into the break without scoring.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:11
39’- IND 0-0 MRI; Colaco finds the wall

Liston does go for glory but only finds the wall with his attempt. Just over five minutes to go in the first half.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:10
38’- IND 0-0 MRI; Freekick for India

Liston Colaco is pulled down a few paces outside the box. Colaco is standing on top of the dead ball. Will he go for glory?

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:07
35’- IND 0-0 MRI; Manvir’s attempt saved!

Great vision from Anirudh Thapa who puts Manvir Singh through on goal with a defence-splitting pass. The forward then tries his luck from a tight angle, forcing Kevin Obrian to a save.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 20:06
34’- IND 0-0 MRI; Play has simmered down

India still with more of the ball and trying to find avenues to disturb Mauritius’s goalie, but the ball is mostly being passed around in the middle of the park.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:59
26’- IND 0-0 MRI; Good move from India

It started with Bheke moving forward, finding Chhangte, who plays a delightful flick to find a racing Asish Rai, who bombs down the right flank to cross in a ball, but wins a corner. Smoothly done by Manolo’s men.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:52
20’- IND 0-0 MRI; End-to-end football!

As Liston Colaco tries to put in those flat balls into the box, Jean Aristide drops his shoulders on the other side, leaving Indian defenders in his wake as he tries to enter the opposition box and create some problems.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:45
12’- IND 0-0 MRI; Mauritius slipping in a few attacks

While India has more than 50 per cent of the ball possession, Mauritius is sneaking in an attack or two from time to time. This time the winger on the right flank put in a ball inside the box. Amrinder seemed to be the one to collect the ball but skipper Rahul Bheke swooped in to clear the lines. Signs of miscommunication at the back?

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:38
6’- IND 0-0 MRI; Sana comes close!

Thapa floats in the ball from the corner kick, finds a blue shirt who bops it towards the back post as Sana Singh runs it to get a head to it, but just misses the bus. Great chance for India goes begging.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:35
3’- IND 0-0 MRI; Blue Tigers with the ball

After an initial scare from the players clad in red in the opening seconds when Mauritius attacked the Indian box, the host has now had most of the ball, slowly trying to stitch together passes.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:31
KICKOFF

Mauritius gets the ball rolling against India in the Intercontinental Cup at the GMC Balayogi Stadium in Hyderabad on Tuesaday.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:23
Players have come out on the pitch!

As sparklers light up the pathway towards the field, India and Mauritius players make their way out as the kickoff is minutes away.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2024 19:15
How is a team coached by Manolo Marquez expected to play?

Conceding goals at crucial stages and succumbing from a winning position was synonymous with India, which preceded the Stimac era. What should excite Indian fans is that Manolo does not compromise defence for his attacking style of football.

Match preview for India vs Mauritius

The Indian men’s national football team ushers in a new era with the familiar face of Manolo Marquez at the helm. After almost a three-month-long hiatus, the Blue Tigers spring back into action as they gear up to face Mauritius in the 2024 Intercontinental Cup at the G. M. C. Balayogi Athletic Stadium here on Tuesday.

This will be India’s first competitive outing since the 1-2 defeat against Qatar in the 2026 FIFA World Cup second-round qualifier, which saw the side finish in third place in its four-team group. Only the top two advanced to the third round of qualification.

After Igor Stimac’s exit as India’s head coach, the Blue Tigers aim to move beyond the pain of the past and look forward with an experienced Manolo steering the ship.
