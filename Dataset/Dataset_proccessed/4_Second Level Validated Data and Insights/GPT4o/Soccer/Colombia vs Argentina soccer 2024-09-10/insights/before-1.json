        "James Rodriguez is expected to be in action vs Argentina.",
        "Colombia will miss two of their most experienced players for this clash as former Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina and former Tottenham Hotspur defender Davinson Sanchez are both out with injury, respectively.",
        "Jhon Duran could attain a starting spot for this game.",
        "Colombia captain James Rodriguez only featured for 45 minutes in the last game and is expected to start and feature for the whole match against Argentina.",
        "Luis Diaz will be the man to watch in this game as he is currently in the form of his life.",
        "Argentina are obviously without Lionel Messi, who is still nursing an ankle injury that had forced him off the field in the Copa America final this past summer.",
        "Nicolas Tagliafico and Leonardo Balerdi are also injured alongside Exequiel Palacios.",
        "Angel Di Maria\u2019s replacement Matias Soule could get a chance to start in this game along with striker Taty Castellanos.",
        "Argentina will have their regular duo of Alexis Mac Allister and Enzo Fernandez available for selection, which will give them additional protection in midfield.",
        "Emiliano Martinez is expected to start in goal for the world champions.",
        "James Rodriguez will be crucial for Colombia as he has always been.",
        "The 33-year-old midfield magician has been ever-present for the Colombian national football team since 2011 and has made over 100 appearances for his country, scoring over 25 goals.",
        "James makes Colombia tick and if he is in the mood, he can still be one of the most devastating attacking midfielders on his day.",
        "Argentina will need to be alert to his threat, especially on set-pieces and shots from outside the box.",
        "His vision and hold-up play could be crucial for Colombia\u2019s chances of coming up with an unlikely win in this game.",
        "In Messi\u2019s absence, Julian Alvarez will have to rise to the occasion for Argentina.",
        "Former Manchester City man Julian Alvarez is our pick from the Argentina side.",
        "The forward is box-office when it comes to crucial moments in big games and in the absence of Messi, we could see him have more of the ball.",
        "Alvarez is an expert in making crucial runs through the oppositions\u2019 defensive channels and this is exactly how Scaloni will try to use him against Colombia.",
        "With Lautaro Martinez alongside him, Alvarez may have to just keep getting in pockets of space in order to create chances or receive goalscoring chances from his teammates throughout the game.",
        "Expect Alvarez to get on the scoresheet in this one!",
        "Colombia haven\u2019t been able to beat Argentina since 2019 and we expect that trend to continue despite Lionel Messi\u2019s absence.",
        "Colombia do have the creative acumen to hurt Argentina, but we believe that Lionel Scaloni\u2019s men are way too balanced as a team as compared to their opponents in this one.",
        "Predicted Score: Colombia 1-2 Argentina"
