        "Ben Old is set to make his first All Whites appearances since moving to France to join Ligue Un club Saint-\u00c9tienne.",
        "The All Whites were most recently in action at the Oceania Nations Cup in Vanuatu in June, where they won all four of their matches in comfortable fashion to claim the regional title.",
        "It has been 18 months since they last won outside Oceania, against China in Wellington in March last year.",
        "Mexico are paying $1.33 to continue their winning run against the All Whites, who are paying $7.00 to pull off an impressive win, with the draw at $4.50.",
        "The All Whites and Mexico have met seven times over the years, including in a home-and-away playoff for a place at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Both those matches ended in defeats for New Zealand, as did the four others this century, the most recent of which was a 2-1 loss at the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia. The All Whites did have a 4-0 win when they hosted Mexico in 1980, ahead of their first successful World Cup qualification campaign."
