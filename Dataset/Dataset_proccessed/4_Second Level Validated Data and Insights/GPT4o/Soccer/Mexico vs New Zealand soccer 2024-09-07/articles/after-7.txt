New Zealand ‘raring to go’ against Mexico and United States, says Bazeley
 posted in: All Whites, National teams, News |

The All Whites are “raring to go” for their international friendlies against Mexico and the United States, head coach Darren Bazeley says.

Bazeley said the squad had prepared well at their training camp in California despite having to make injury-forced changes to the squad in the lead-up to Sunday’s game against Mexico.

Withdrawals from the squad were midfielder Sarpreet Singh (minor injury), defender Tyler Bindon (concussion) and full back Dalton Wilkins (injury).

Brought into the squad were Auckland FC striker Logan Rogerson, Charlotte defender Bill Tuiloma and Wellington Phoenix fullback Sam Sutton.

“It’s always disappointing to lose players in the build-up to the camp,” Bazeley said.

“Obviously, we lost Sarpreet and Tyler, you know, just before coming here.

“And, also, Dalton picked up that injury yesterday so that’s disappointing to lose (them) but we’ve replaced them with good players.

“What we have now, we have good depth in lots of positions so now it’s an opportunity for those players (coming in).”

Bazeley said the side’s main priority was to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup but the games against Mexico and United States would provide a measure of the All Whites’ progress.

“It’s a good opportunity for us to test ourselves … make sure that we see where we’re at, … how close are we to getting ready to beat one of these bigger teams.

“So it’s a good challenge, one we’re ready for.”

New Zealand have selected a squad that is considered one of the strongest ever, including players attached to clubs in the English Premier League, Italy’s Serie A, and France’s LIgue 1.
