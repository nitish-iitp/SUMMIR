The All Whites have been outclassed by an impressive Mexico side in an international friendly at the Rose Bowl in California.

Darren Bazeley’s side were no match for El Tri on a sweltering evening in Pasadena, fortunate to keep the scoreline to 3-0.

In the first meeting between the nations since 2017, when Mexico won 2-1 at the Confederations Cup in Russia, the Central American side scored a well-worked opener in the fifth minute through Orbelin Pineda and held that lead to halftime.

Mexico had been unfortunate to hit the post before the break and struck the woodwork again in the second spell, allowing the All Whites a chance to work their way back into the game.

But a near full-strength team led by Chris Wood failed to manufacture any clear chances, their best opportunity coming when Tommy Smith couldn’t quite get his head to a corner that had been flicked on.

Mexico found a second goal in the 53rd minute through Cesar Huerta before Luis Romo sealed the result four minutes later.

It was the All Whites’ seventh loss to Mexico in as many matches since 2000. New Zealand now travel to Cincinnati when they will take on the United States on Wednesday.
