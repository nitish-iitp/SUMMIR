        "The biggest match in Group F of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers takes place today, October 10, 2024, at the Accra Sports Stadium.",
        "The build-up to the game has focused largely on Ghana\u2019s last-minute efforts to get the stadium ready for the game, as well as the battle between Ghana coach Otto Addo and Sudan coach Kwasi Appiah, who is a Ghanaian.",
        "Ghana has been dealt major blows in terms of the availability of key players, with Thomas Partey, Joseph Paintsil, Kingsley Schindler, and Osman Ibrahim all ruled out.",
        "Sudan, on the other hand, has no injury worries and came to Ghana with the full complement of their squad.",
        "After one point from two games, the Black Stars currently lie third on the table, while Sudan has three points from two games and is second.",
        "Angola leads the group with six points, while Niger is at the bottom with one point.",
        "Otto Addo\u2019s record as Ghana coach: The Black Stars have played six matches since Otto Addo returned as substantive coach. The Black Stars have won two, lost two, and drawn two of the matches.",
        "In the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Otto Addo is yet to win a game, having played two matches.",
        "The Black Stars have scored ten goals in Otto Addo\u2019s second stint and conceded.",
        "Kwasi Appiah\u2019s record as Sudan coach: Under Kwasi Appiah, Sudan has played sixteen matches, winning eight, drawing four, and losing four of the sixteen matches.",
        "They have scored twenty goals and conceded eleven.",
        "Ghana and Sudan have met 14 times, with the Black Stars having the upper hand in terms of the number of victories chalked so far. Of the 14 matches, Ghana has won 10, with Sudan winning 3, while one ended in a draw.",
        "Mohammed Kudus\u2019 2024/2025 season may not be going as expected, but he is still Ghana\u2019s best player. The West Ham midfielder has the potential to conjure miracles and make things work for the Black Stars.",
        "Seifi Tieri is the one man the Sudanese will be hoping to do the damage for them in their game against Ghana. The 30-year-old, who plies his trade with Pharco FC, will prove a headache for the Ghanaian defense, which has not looked solid recently."
