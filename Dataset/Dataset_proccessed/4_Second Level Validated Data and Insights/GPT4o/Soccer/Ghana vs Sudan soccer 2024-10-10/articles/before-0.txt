Ghana’s Black Stars coach, Otto Addo, has unveiled 25-man squad for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Sudan, scheduled for October 10, 2024, at the Accra Sports Stadium.

This crucial match is a stepping stone for Ghana’s bid to secure a spot in the 2024 AFCON tournament.

Star Players Lead the Charge

The squad boasts an impressive lineup, featuring captain Thomas Partey, Jordan Ayew, Mohammed Kudus, Antoine Semenyo, and Inaki Williams, who have been making waves in Europe.

Other key players include Tariq Lamptey, Lawrence Ati Zigi, Alezander Djiku, and Joseph Wallacott.

Rising Stars from Local Leagues

Otto Addo has also tapped into Ghana’s local talent pool, selecting promising players like Fredrick Asare from Kumasi Asante Kotoko.

This move is expected to inject fresh energy into the team and provide opportunities for homegrown talent to shine.

Ghana’s AFCON Quest

Ghana is grouped with Sudan, Angola, and Niger in Group F, and a win against Sudan would be a significant boost to their qualification chances.

With this strong squad, Otto Addo is confident of securing a spot in the 2024 AFCON tournament.
