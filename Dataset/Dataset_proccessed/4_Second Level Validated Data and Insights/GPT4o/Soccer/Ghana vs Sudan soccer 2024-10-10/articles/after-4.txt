President of the Ghana Football Association, Kurt Okraku didn’t hold back as he delivered a tough talk to the Black Stars players.

With Ghana’s 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying hopes hanging by a thread, Okraku laid into the team, expressing his frustration over their recent underwhelming performances ahead of their crucial doubleheader against Sudan this month.

Their campaign began with a disappointing home loss to Angola, followed by a 1-1 draw against Niger, leaving Ghana with just one point out of a possible six.

Sitting third in Group F, the team must step up to stay in contention for next year’s tournament in Morocco.

In his address to the squad on October 8, Okraku didn’t mince words. He urged the players to give their all for the country, clearly frustrated with what he perceived as a lack of passion on the pitch.

“The minimum I expect, the minimum Ghana expects, is a team of boys or men who will show passion and desire to play for our country,” he said.

“Not when you are dribbled and you will be seen walking on the pitch and the ball is heading towards your net. That is impossible, I told the coach.”

He reminded the players that putting on the national jersey should inspire pride, and that they’re expected to show aggression and a will to win.

“It’s either you guys decide to die for Ghana or decide you will not, then you’ll never be selected,” he continued.

The Black Stars are set to face Sudan at the Accra Sports Stadium on October 10 before heading to Libya for the return fixture on October 15.
