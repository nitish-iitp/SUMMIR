Wasteful Ghana draw with Sudan

Ghana endured more frustration on matchday 3 in qualifying for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations after they were held to a goalless draw by Sudan at the Accra Sports Stadium on Thursday.

The Black Stars created a whole host of chances on a poor playing surface in Accra, but a lack of cutting edge in front of goal meant they remained winless at the halfway point of the qualifying campaign.

The situation in Group F is unchanged, with Otto Addo's side still third on two points, two behind the Falcons of Jediane and a further two adrift of leaders Angola, who host Niger on Friday, 11 October.

The home team were hoping for better fortunes after playing out to a 1-1 draw with the Menas on 9 September and they made a bright start as Alexander Djiku hit the crossbar with a header from Mohammed Kudus's cross on five minutes.

Ernest Nuamah then lashed a shot just wide just of goal in the 11th minute following an exquisite pass from Kudus before Antoine Semenyo tested Mohamed Al Mustafa after bursting into the box on 17 minutes.

The visitors defended doggedly to ensure it remained 0-0 at the break and they came under more pressure in the second half as Ghana pushed for the opener.

Semenyo struggled to bring the ball under control from Alidu Seidu's cross on the right in the 56th minute, allowing the goalkeeper to clear his lines and Kudus drew a smart save from Al Mustafa moments later after latching onto a rebound.

Sudan's best opportunity came on 72 minutes when they won a free-kick in a central position 30 yards out and Lawrence Ati-Zigi took no chances as he tipped a curling shot behind that might have been going over the bar, while Mustafa Karshoum sent a firm header narrowly wide of the right post from the resulting corner.

The Black Stars continued to carve out openings in the closing stages and how they didn't score from at least one of those is a mystery.

Inaki Williams fired a shot across the face of goal from an acute angle on the right in the 85th minute after being released into the box and Kudus somehow failed to turn the ball home from a yard out on 88 minutes after Williams missed Seidu's cross.

Williams squandered an even better chance in stoppage time after being picked out by Kudus inside the 18-yard area and Abdul Fatawu blazed over on the rebound following good work from the keeper.
