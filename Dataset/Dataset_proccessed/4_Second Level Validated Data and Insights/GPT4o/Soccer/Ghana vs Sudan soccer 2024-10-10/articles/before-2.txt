Ghana will host Sudan at the Accra Sports Stadium in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match on Thursday evening.

The Black Stars are yet to register a victory in this qualifying campaign, while the visitors are seeking to rebound from defeat in their last match.

After seeing their 24-year unbeaten streak at Kumasi's Baba Yara Sports Stadium end with a 1-0 defeat against Angola in their opening Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign, the Black Stars followed it up with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Niger in their second match.

Alidu Seidu gave Ghana the lead just before half-time, but they failed to extend their advantage despite dominating the game, which ultimately cost them as Niger equalised through Oumar Sako in the 81st minute.

Otto Addo's side have just one point and are third in Group F, making their two games against Sudan in this window crucial to their AFCON qualification campaign, as there will be only two games remaining.

Having featured in each of the last 10 AFCON editions since missing out in 2004, failure to qualify for the 2025 AFCON would be a significant blow for the Black Stars, but they will be confident heading into Thursday's clash as they are unbeaten at home against Sudan, recording four wins and a draw in five such games.

After a 1-0 victory over Niger in their Group F curtain-raiser, Sudan succumbed to a 2-1 defeat against Angola in their second match of the qualifying campaign.

The defeat ended the Falcons of Jediane's four-match unbeaten run in competitive matches, a run that included victories over Congo DR, Mauritania, and South Sudan in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

This leaves James Kwesi Appiah's side second in the group with three points, leaving them well-positioned heading into this double header with Ghana.

Sudan had won two straight matches on the road – against South Sudan and Mauritania in the World Cup qualifiers – prior to the defeat against Angola in their last match.

Led by former Black Stars coach, Kwesi Appiah, the Falcons of Jediane would be hoping to improve upon the goalless draw they picked up away at Ghana in 2010 in an AFCON qualifying match.

Thomas Partey, Joseph Paintsil, Kingsley Schindler and Osman Ibrahim have all withdrawn from the initial squad named by Ghana due to various injuries.

Abu Francis, Jonas Adjei Adjetey, Michael Baidoo and Ibrahim Sadick were called up as replacements after the initial quartet pulled out.

Athletic Bilbao's forward Inaki Williams, Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, West Ham's Mohammed Kudus and Leicester City's Abdul Fatawu are the expected attacking quartet.

Former Al Hilal star Eid Moghaddam and Al-Merreikh goalkeeper Ahmed Peter have made a return to the Sudanese team for this clash.

Abo Eisa and Mustafa Karshom have each scored one goal for the visitors during this AFCON qualifiers, but centre-forward Mohamed Abdelrahman will be aiming to get off the mark on Thursday.


Ghana possible starting lineup:
Ati-Zigi; Seidu, Salisu, Mumin, Lamptey; Samed, Ashimeru; Fatawu, Kudus, Semenyo; Ayew

Sudan possible starting lineup:
Abou; Agab, Koko, Karshoum, Khamis, Abuaagla, Khidir; Eisa, Omer, Thierry; Abdelrahman



We say: Ghana 2-1 Sudan

Ghana may have struggled in their opening two matches, but the quality within their squad is undeniable, and this could prove too much to handle for Sudan, who have historically struggled as visitors in this fixture.
