Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey and three others have pulled out of Ghana’s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sudan.

Partey, Joseph Paintsil, Ibrahim Osman and Kingsley Schindler withdrew from the squad due to injuries.

The England-based midfielder was unable to join the Black stars due to medical issues he is currently experiencing, and his club has scheduled him for further tests in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Paintsil experienced some pain in his hamstrings during their last game on Saturday, October 5. He is therefore unavailable to join the Black stars.

Osman experienced pain in his calf muscles during their last game and was substituted in the 65th minute. His club has since communicated his unavailability to the Ghana Football Association.

And Schindler was unable to join the Black Stars due to a medical emergency he’s currently receiving treatment for.

The Black Stars are set to face Sudan on Thursday, October 10 and Tuesday, October 15, 2024 in two very important Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.
