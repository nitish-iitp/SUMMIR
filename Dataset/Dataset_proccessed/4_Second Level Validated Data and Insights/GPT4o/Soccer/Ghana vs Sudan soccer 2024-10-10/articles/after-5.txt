A Group F stalemate between Ghana and Sudan in Accra
 October 10, 2024
 Football Sierra Leone

In the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers, Ghana continued to struggle in Group F with another goalless draw against Sudan. (GFA Photo) – the Black Stars couldn’t take advantage of their home ground despite having a lot of possession at the Accra Sports Stadium.

Ghanaian fans were hopeful that the Black Stars would record their first win after their slow start in Group F, which included a surprising home loss to Angola and an away draw against Niger. Despite the significant pressure, Ghana coach Otto Addo remains confident in his team’s abilities.

Players like Jordan Ayew, West Ham attacker Moahmed Kudus, and Antoine Samedu were all part of the starting eleven but couldn’t make a difference in the stalemate.

During the match, Ghana struggled to score, with Mohammed Kudus and Iñaki Williams coming closest to finding the net. However, Sudan’s defence, led by goalkeeper Mohamed Al Mustafa, held strong. Ghana’s attacking players had difficulty breaking through Sudan’s determined defence, and despite late pressure, they were unable to score, resulting in a goalless draw.

In their three matches so far, the Black Stars are currently in third place in Group F with just two points, while Sudan has moved up to second place with four points after securing a draw. Sudan host Ghana in Libya on October 15th for match day four of the qualifiers.

Angola is currently leading the group with six points from two games, and Niger is at the bottom with one point. Angola is scheduled to play against Niger on Friday.
