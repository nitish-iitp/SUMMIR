HANOI (21 November 2023) – With just hours left to Vietnam’s clash against Iraq, head coach Philippe Troussier has promised that his team will be out to make things difficult for the Middle Eastern side.

Vietnam will take on Iraq in their second game Group F of the second round qualifiers of the FIFA World Cup 2026 at the My Dinh National Stadium later tonight.

“We will make every effort to get good results against Iraq. Each opponent has a different playing style and my goal is to adjust accordingly to make things difficult for them. We are prepared,” said the Frenchman.

“I know Iraq and their position. It can be considered that Iraq is currently in the top 5 or 6 in Asia. Therefore, in theory, Iraq is rated higher than the Vietnam team.

“But my players will go into the game with the mindset of having nothing to lose, and the desire to prove everyone wrong.”

Vietnam started their campaign in Group F with a 2-0 win over the Philippines in Manila while Iraq smashed Indonesia 5-1 at home in Basra.

A win for either side today will see the winner wresting control of the leadership of the group.

“Iraq are a strong opponent. They just beat Indonesia 5-1. The advantage for us is that we play at home and have the support of our fans,” added midfielder Nguyen Thai Son.
