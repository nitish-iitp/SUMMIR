HOMENEWSSPORTSDANG VAN LAM: 'LOSING AT THE LAST MINUTE IS A GRIM OUTCOME'
Dang Van Lam: 'Losing at the last minute is a grim outcome'
VnExpress
November 21, 2023




Ha NoiGoalkeeper Dang Van Lam regretted when the Vietnamese team lost to Iraq at the last minute, but believes the team will correct mistakes to come back strongest in the second qualifying round of the 2026 World Cup in Asia.

"It's a pity that we conceded a goal when the match was only measured in seconds," Van Lam said after the match. “The Vietnamese team tried their best, always having to play under great pressure from their opponents. But also because the whole team showed high fighting spirit, admitting defeat in the last seconds was a grim outcome."

At My Dinh Stadium on the night of November 21, Iraq started the match strongly, quickly proving their position as the strongest team in Group F with an overwhelming attack, actively competing and creating high pressure. However, the Vietnamese players calmly played close, closely followed and defended tightly. Van Lam stood out in the home team's defense with three important saves in the first half.

In the second half, the goalkeeper born in 1993 with mixed Vietnamese and Russian blood continued to make two more amazing saves in front of the Iraqi striker's boot. However, with only a few seconds left in the match, from Bayesh's tight ball on the right wing, Van Lam rushed out one beat slower than his opponent, and could not stop Mohanad Ali's header in time.

“This failure is truly regrettable. But the whole team will try to correct mistakes and stand up to look forward to the next matches. We believe in Coach Troussier's instructions to come back strongest in 2024," Van Lam added.

In this match, coach Troussier continued to use many young players such as Minh Trong, Tuan Tai, Thai Son, Dinh Bac, Khuat Van Khang... According to Van Lam, being given regular opportunities on high-level playgrounds like the The 2026 World Cup is a good experience for juniors. “After matches like that, they will accumulate a lot of experience for the future. If they can overcome the psychological barrier from this failure, they will become more mature."

Captain Que Ngoc Hai also regretted the last-minute defeat, but still saw positive points. "We lost, but we are very proud because the young players were given the opportunity and they deserve recognition," said the central defender of the Binh Duong speak.

Despite the loss, Vietnam still finished second in the group because the two opponents Indonesia and the Philippines tied 1-1. According to Que Ngoc Hai, Vietnam is still confident that they will play well in the upcoming matches. "Through the last two matches, everyone has seen how hard we tried. With what we have shown, we are not too worried but will try to win one of the two tickets in this group to enter the third qualifying round," the Vietnamese defender said. Nghe An added.
