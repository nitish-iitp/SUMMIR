WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFICATION
COLOMBIA
CHILE

Colombia will take Chile in the tenth round of the South American World Championship Qualification at 20:30 local time on October 15, 2024. The game will take place at the 46,789 spectator capacity Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Meléndez in Barranquilla. Venezuelan referee Valenzuela J. will officiate the game while Chile sorely needs to raise their position in the CONMEBOL standings and Colombia aims to get vital points on their road to qualifying for the World Cup.

Colombia, after a disappointing loss to Bolivia, will be looking to regain momentum at home, where they’ve been solid throughout this campaign. Chile, struggling with only five points in nine matches, will try to defy the odds and claim a rare away victory. Both teams will be highly motivated, and this match promises to be a significant turning point for both in the qualification process.

BETTING TIPS AND MATCH INSIGHTS

Today’s Colombia vs Chile prediction centres on a pivotal fight in Barranquilla, where both sides need points for separate purposes. While Chile comes in as the underdog, lying last in the standings, Colombia, despite their loss against Bolivia, has a great home record. Although their head-to-head encounters have sometimes been close-knit, Colombia has lately dominated. While Chile will want to counterattack and take advantage of any defensive mistakes from their opponent, Colombia will probably try to rule possession and apply their tactical edge. Colombia is preferred to win, thus this game is likely to be quite competitive.

Colombia Results

Colombia’s recent form has been mixed, with some strong home performances contrasted by away struggles. Below are their last five matches:

Date\tCompetition\tMatchup\tResult\tOutcome
10.10.24\tWCQ\tBolivia vs Colombia\t1-0\tL
10.09.24\tWCQ\tColombia vs Argentina\t2-1\tW
07.09.24\tWCQ\tPeru vs Colombia\t1-1\tD
15.07.24\tCopa America\tArgentina vs Colombia\t1-0\tL
11.07.24\tCopa America\tUruguay vs Colombia\t0-1\tW

Colombia’s results show that they’ve been solid at home, picking up crucial victories against Argentina and Uruguay. However, their away performance, especially the recent loss to Bolivia, raises concerns about consistency. Nevertheless, their home strength suggests that they are well-prepared to handle Chile on their own turf.

Chile Results

Chile has struggled throughout the qualification campaign, and their form in recent matches shows a team in dire need of improvement. Below are their last five matches:

Date\tCompetition\tMatchup\tResult\tOutcome
11.10.24\tWCQ\tChile vs Brazil\t1-2\tL
10.09.24\tWCQ\tChile vs Bolivia\t1-2\tL
06.09.24\tWCQ\tArgentina vs Chile\t3-0\tL
30.06.24\tCopa America\tCanada vs Chile\t0-0\tD
26.06.24\tCopa America\tChile vs Argentina\t0-1\tL

Chile’s form has been poor, with four losses and one draw in their last five games. Their defense has been particularly vulnerable, conceding multiple goals against Brazil and Argentina. Chile’s inability to convert their chances, along with defensive fragility, puts them in a difficult position ahead of this match.

Colombia vs Chile Head-to-Head Results

The head-to-head results between these two sides have been relatively close, though Colombia has been more successful in recent years. Here are the last five matches between the two:

Date\tCompetition\tMatchup\tResult
13.09.23\tWCQ\tChile vs Colombia\t0-0
09.09.21\tWCQ\tColombia vs Chile\t3-1
14.10.20\tWCQ\tChile vs Colombia\t2-2
12.10.19\tFriendly\tColombia vs Chile\t0-0
28.06.19\tCopa America\tColombia vs Chile\t0-1

The recent matches show a balanced contest between the two nations, with two draws, two wins for Colombia, and one for Chile. The 3-1 victory in 2021 highlights Colombia’s dominance at home, where they’ve generally been stronger in this fixture.
