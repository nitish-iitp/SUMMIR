adidas and the Colombian Football Federation (FCF) have launched a special edition jersey to mark the Federation’s centenary.

The jersey will be worn on 15 October 2024, during the World Cup Qualifier against Chile, paying tribute to the first kit worn by the national team in 1945.

The Chalk White shirt symbolises Colombia's humble beginnings and the legacy of those who have represented the nation. It features the Colombian flag on the chest and a 100th-anniversary FCF logo on the back. The adidas trefoil and FCF logos are presented in gold, highlighting the unique character of this limited edition, while the collar features the vibrant colours of the national flag.

Very very nice. Adidas should just keep this logo for good, instead of their current revamped one which just looks like Mizuno from a distance.
