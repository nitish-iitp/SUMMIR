Preview: Kosovo vs. Romania - prediction, team news, lineups

Kosovo welcome Romania to Pristina on Friday in one of the standout fixtures in League C of the UEFA Nations League this week.

UEFA's youngest nation continue to strive for a shot at a major tournament while Romania come in fresh off the back of reaching the knockout stages at Euro 2024.

This will be a first competitive fixture in charge for Kosovo boss Franco Foda, who signed up in February, and it will be against the toughest opponents in their section.

Foda, who guided Austria to the last 16 of Euro 2020, will be hoping he can take Kosovo into League B for the first time, as previous draws have not been kind to the Balkan side.

Since promotion from League D shortly after their accession to FIFA and UEFA, clearly a class above the likes of Malta, Azerbaijan and the Faroe Islands, Kosovo have faced very tough opposition in the Nations League.

Nations such as Slovenia and Greece are arguably too good for the third tier, and Kosovo were unable to usurp either, meaning they now start a third successive campaign in League C.

Once again though, Kosovo have been drawn against the heavyweights of the entire tier in Romania, so they will need to upset the apple cart similarly to how they did in Euro 2024 qualifying if they are to have any chance of promotion.

The Dardanians held Romania and Switzerland, twice, to draws, while also beating Israel on home soil, but their campaign fell to pieces due to a draw with Andorra and two defeats to Belarus.

Kosovo have the ability to succeed with so many players in Europe's top-five leagues, but inconsistency has held them back ever since becoming a UEFA member.

Romania are unlikely to find it easy in Pristina though, as their 0-0 draw here during Euro 2024 qualifying was part of an ongoing run which has seen Kosovo lose just one of their last nine home games.

Legendary manager Mircea Lucescu, known for revolutionising Shakhtar Donetsk in a 12-year spell, is back at the helm 43 years after first taking charge between 1981 and 1986, replacing Edward Iordanescu, who led the Tricolorii in Germany over the summer.

Lucescu gave Gheorghe Hagi his Romania debut, and helped plant the seeds for the country's phenomenal rise in the 1990s, and with all signs currently pointing in the right direction, hopes of reaching another World Cup in the United States is not beyond them.

Recovering excellently from relegation in the last iteration of the Nations League is a positive, as Romania went down unfortunately with seven points, but bounced back by reaching Euro 2024, going unbeaten across their qualifying section, taking 22 points and keeping six clean sheets in 10 games.

Netherlands got the better of Romania in the last 16, but the 3-0 win over Ukraine in the group opener will go down as one of their finest days since the memorable years in the 90s.

Kosovo pair Mirlind Kryeziu and Bernard Berisha have both pulled out of the squad late with injury, while Elbasan Rashani is not fit enough for a call up having not yet featured for Elche after his summer switch from Clermont.

Foda named a preliminary squad for these two upcoming fixtures before trimming it down to 26, and Lirim Kastrati, Bersant Celina and Arber Zeneli were all surprise exclusions, potentially leaving the door open for Elvis Rexhbecaj to make his debut after switching allegiance from Germany.

Edon Zhegrova is the man in form after helping Lille to qualify for the league phase of the Champions League, while Vedat Muriqi is continuing his fine goalscoring exploits at Real Mallorca.

Romania goalkeeper Horatiu Moldovan has pulled out of the squad, meaning 37-year-old Florin Nita is set to start between the sticks, as he did during the Euros.

Mihai Lixandru was set to make his international bow, but an unfortunately-timed injury means the FCSB midfielder has had to withdraw.

From the squad selected for the Euros, Alexandru Cicaldau, Ionut Nedelcearu and Bogdan Racovitan have all lost their places under new manager Lucescu for the time being.

Defence was the strong point under Iordanescu, and Lucescu will hope that continues, so he will have been glad to see Radu Dragusin get some much-needed game time for Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, filling in for the absent Micky van de Ven.

Kosovo possible starting lineup:
Muric; Rrahmani, Aliti, Paqarada; Hadergjonaj, V Berisha, Rexhbecaj, Vojvoda; Zhegrova, Muriqi, Rashica

Romania possible starting lineup:
Nita; Ratiu, Dragusin, Burca, Bancu; R Marin, M Marin, Stanciu; Man, Dragus, Mihaila



We say: Kosovo 0-0 Romania

With new eras for both nations under managers taking charge of their first competitive matches, this is a tough one to call, especially given Kosovo's strong home form.

These two played out a goalless draw here last year, and another could be likely considering just one of Kosovo's last eight games, and only four of Romania's previous 13, have seen both teams score.
