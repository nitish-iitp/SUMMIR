Reasoning
Cyriel Dessers is the key candidate to score for Rangers in Matondo's absence. With three Premiership goals and sharp movement, Dessers' aerial strength and finishing ability can exploit Dundee United’s defence effectively.

The Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in Group D kick off with Libya hosting Rwanda at the 11 June Stadium in Tripoli. This encounter marks the beginning of a journey for both nations aiming to secure a spot in the prestigious tournament. Libya, under new leadership, have shown promise in recent outings, while Rwanda have also improved their performances significantly under their current manager. With both sides eager to start on a positive note, this match is set to be a fascinating contest where every inch of the pitch will be fiercely contested.

The most compelling bet for this match is to back under 2.5 goals. The data points towards a low-scoring affair, with both teams showcasing solid defensive capabilities in recent matches. Libya, under the stewardship of Serbian tactician Milutin Sredojević, have been a side that focusses on maintaining a sturdy defence. In their last seven matches, they have conceded very few opportunities to their opponents, and their recent friendly against Botswana saw them restrict the opposition to just three shots on target, none of which seriously threatened their goal.

Libya’s attacking prowess has been more restrained, often converting only the limited chances they create. Their recent record shows that they have been involved in many low-scoring matches, with four of their last five home games seeing under 2.5 goals. Given that Libya’s approach under Sredojević is heavily reliant on maintaining a disciplined defensive structure, it is likely that they will look to keep things tight at the back once again.

Rwanda, on the other hand, have been equally impressive in defence since the arrival of their German manager, Torsten Spittler. The Wasps have only conceded one goal in Spittler’s first six matches in charge, illustrating a strong defensive foundation. Rwanda’s matches have also been characterised by a scarcity of goals, with 18 of their last 19 fixtures seeing under 2.5 goals. Their recent encounters reflect a cautious approach, prioritising defensive solidity over expansive play.

Given the defensive strengths of both teams and their recent form, a low-scoring draw or a narrow win for either side seems the most plausible outcome. BettingTips4You.com expert Emmanuel Nwankwo summarises this sentiment well: “With both teams boasting resolute defences and a tendency towards low-scoring games, under 2.5 goals appears to be the safest bet in what promises to be a closely fought encounter.” The statistics clearly back this up, making under 2.5 goals the best bet for this fixture.

Correct Score Prediction: Libya 1-0 Rwanda

Eligibility & payment exclusions apply. T&Cs apply.

For the correct score prediction, a 1-0 victory for Libya seems the most likely outcome. The Mediterranean Knights have been in good form, particularly at home, where they have managed to eke out narrow victories by relying on their defensive strength and taking advantage of set-pieces or rare scoring opportunities.

Libya’s ability to keep things tight at the back, combined with Rwanda’s struggle to score freely, suggests that this match will be settled by a single goal. While Rwanda have improved under Spittler, their attacking output remains limited, and breaking down a well-organised Libyan defence will be challenging. Therefore, a slender 1-0 win for Libya aligns with the overall analysis and is a solid prediction.
