Preview: Libya vs. Rwanda - prediction, team news, lineups

Group D at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers kicks off this weekend with Libya taking on Rwanda at the 11 June Stadium in Tripoli on Wednesday evening.

The group also features African powerhouse Nigeria and Benin, who will lock horns in their opening match on Saturday at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo.

Match preview

Libya will head into their first match of AFCON qualifying in good spirits after putting on a solid display to beat Botswana 1-0 in a friendly match at this venue over the weekend.

While the Mediterranean Knights were not the most attacking in that game, scoring with pretty much their only big chance of the game, they were impressive in defence, conceding just three shots on target, none of which looked likely to find the back of the net.

Since the Libyan Football Federation announced the appointment of Serbia tactician Milutin Micho Sredojevic at the start of October, the side have experienced a notable upturn in performances, with the new boss suffering only one loss in 11 matches since his arrival.

During that time, the team have also posted a record of seven wins and three draws, with the only defeat coming against Cape Verde in their most recent CAF World Cup qualification match back in June.

Libya are set to feature in their 11th AFCON qualifying campaign this year, but have only reached the main draw three times, with the last being in the 2011-12 tournament.

Meanwhile, Rwanda will be aiming for a major improvement in this qualifying campaign after finishing rock bottom in the last edition and failing to win any of their six group-stage matches.

However, the Wasps head into this competition carrying solid form, currently sitting atop their group in CAF World Cup qualification with a record of two wins one draw and just one loss in their first four games.

Notably, since Torsten Spittler took the reigns, Rwanda have been excellent in defence, conceding only one goal in the German manager's first six matches in charge.

Like their upcoming opponents, the Wasps are embarking on their 11th AFCON qualifiers but have only made it to the main competition once in their history which was back in 2003-04.

These two nations have faced each other a total of eight times over the years and Libya hold the advantage in the head-to-head standings with five wins, while Rwanda have won once and two games finished level.

Team News

Ali Yousef will be eligible to return to the Libyan national team this week after missing the World Cup qualifier against Cape Verde due to the red card he received against Mauritius at the start of June.

The Club Africain centre-back is expected to step straight back into the starting 11 and should slot in alongside Magdy Artiba in central defence, with Abdelaziz Ali and Mohamed Al-Takbali completing the back four.

Six of the 10 professional players currently playing abroad joined their first training session with Amavubi on Wednesday, including the likes of Bonheur Mugisha of AS Marsa in Tunisia and Arthur Gitego of AFC Leopards.

Al Ahli's Thierry Manzi, Innocent Nshuti of US third-tier side One Knoxville and Steve Rubanguka of Saudi outfit Al Nonjoom are all available for selection this week.


Libya possible starting lineup:
Al-Woheshi; Al-Takabali, Yousef, Arteeba, Ali; Al Badri, Al Shremi, Aleiyan; Tabal, Salama, Ekrawa

Rwanda possible starting lineup:
Ntwari; Omborenga, Mutsinzi, Manzi, Imanishimwe; Muhire, B Mugisha, Bizimana; Kwizera, Nshuti, G Mugisha



We say: Libya 1-1 Rwanda

Both these sides have made notable improvements under new management and are carrying solid form into this match. There is very little to choose between these two and we feel there will be nothing to split them at the final whistle as well.
