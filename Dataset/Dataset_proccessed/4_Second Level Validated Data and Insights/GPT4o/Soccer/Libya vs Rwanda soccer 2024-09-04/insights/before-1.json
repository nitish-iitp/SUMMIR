        "Libya vs Rwanda predictions for this Africa Cup of Nations Qualifying affair. Libya face Rwanda at the 11 June Stadium in Tripoli on Wednesday evening, marking the start of Group D in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.",
        "Libya, under new leadership, have shown promise in recent outings, while Rwanda have also improved their performances significantly under their current manager.",
        "With both sides eager to start on a positive note, this match is set to be a fascinating contest where every inch of the pitch will be fiercely contested.",
        "The most compelling bet for this match is to back under 2.5 goals. The data points towards a low-scoring affair, with both teams showcasing solid defensive capabilities in recent matches.",
        "Libya, under the stewardship of Serbian tactician Milutin Sredojevi\u0107, have been a side that focusses on maintaining a sturdy defence.",
        "Rwanda, on the other hand, have been equally impressive in defence since the arrival of their German manager, Torsten Spittler. The Wasps have only conceded one goal in Spittler\u2019s first six matches in charge, illustrating a strong defensive foundation."
