On a freezing night in Reykjavik, Craig Bellamy’s achievement in becoming the first Wales manager to remain unbeaten through his first three competitive matches was small consolation for a spectacular second-half collapse.

First-half goals from Brennan Johnson and Harry Wilson appeared to have Wales on course for a comfortable victory in their Nations League group game but the substitute Logi Tomasson inspired Iceland to score two goals in three minutes and earn a deserved point.

To add to Bellamy’s harsh learning experience in his third game in management, his decision to recall Danny Ward backfired when the Leicester City goalkeeper was credited with Iceland’s equaliser through an own goal.

Bellamy also left himself open to scrutiny with his decision to take off Johnson at the interval, after the Tottenham Hotspur winger was booked, following a petulant altercation with Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson, which means he misses Monday’s meeting with Montenegro in Cardiff.

“It was a really pleasing performance, but also a learning experience,” Bellamy claimed. “Me learning about the players, them about us. It was perfect.

“We struggled to find the solutions but it’s so good for us. I just spoke to the players in there and we will benefit so much from those 45 minutes. It will be in the ‘library’ and in the long run be really beneficial for us.”

There was still little sign of the collapse to come as Wales coasted into a two-goal lead, Johnson giving his country an ideal start after only 11 minutes with his seventh goal in as many games for club and country.

Neco Williams’ superb long pass allowed Wilson a shot which passed beneath the goalkeeper Hakon Valdimarsson, who could only claw the ball off the line and into the path of Johnson to score. Wilson struck the foot of the post before adding a second on 29 minutes, taking another superb pass from Williams in his stride before unleashing an unstoppable left-foot finish.

But Iceland’s performance was unrecognisable after the interval, with three clear chances missed and the bar struck before, on 69 minutes, a well-worked corner saw Thorsteinsson find the unmarked Tomasson who beat Ward from the edge of the area with a superb shot.

Just three minutes later, Thorsteinsson’s back-heel sent Tomasson down to the byline and his cross flew through Ward’s legs and was deflected into the goal via the goalkeeper’s elbow.

There could have been few complaints had Thorsteinsson’s 89th-minute shot gone in, rather than strike the post, although Wales just about hung on to preserve their manager’s unbeaten start.
