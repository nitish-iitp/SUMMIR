Wales surrender two-goal led in draw with Iceland
ByReuters
Updated: Oct 11, 2024, 08:51 pm

Iceland staged a second half comeback to earn a 2-2 draw at home to Wales in their Nations League Group B4 game on Friday, where the visitors looked in complete control at half time but the home side were much the better team after the break.

Wales took the lead in the 11th minute when Harry Wilson's effort was chased down and clawed off the line by the keeper but Brennan Johnson was there to tap in from close range.

The second goal was almost a carbon copy, with Neco Williams again sending a ball over the top to send Wilson free and this time his powerful strike left the keeper with no chance and they went in 2-0 up at half time.

A spirited Iceland created chance after chance in the second half and in the 69th minute they pulled one back with substitute Logi Tomasson curling a shot into the far bottom corner from the edge of the box.

Three minutes later, Tomasson attempted a cut back from the byline but the pass took a deflection off keeper Danny Ward at his near post which sent the ball into his own net for the deserved equaliser, with Wales hanging on to earn a point.

Wales, still unbeaten under Craig Bellamy after three games, are second in the group on five points, two behind leaders Turkey who won 1-0 against Montenegro while Iceland are third with four points. Iceland host Turkey and Wales are home to Montenegro on Monday.
