Iceland secured a comeback draw against Wales in the Nations League in a match of two halves played out in the cold conditions of Reykjavik.

Wales started the game as the more aggressive and competant side. They were free flowing and in control of the ball in the midfield areas. This dominance resulted in two eerily similar goals. Neco Williams with a long ball over the top, Harry Wilson with a run from deep in behind the defence.

Wilson’s first effort was cleared off the line by Hakon Rafn Valdimarsson only for Brennan Johnson to tap in the rebound. The second effort was coolly dispatched by the midfielder meaning the Dragons led 2-0 at half-time.

But they never got going again. Substitutions and an intense press from Iceland saw them turn the game around. The hosts were unafraid to shoot from even half-decent positions and Logi Tomasson netted twice to draw level. From there Wales were clinging on and managed to keep out the hosts to earn themselves a good point.

Craig Bellamy says Wales players receiving support after George Baldock death

Wales manager Craig Bellamy says his players have been affected by the death of George Baldock with some receiving support ahead of their Nations League clash with Iceland.

Former Sheffield United defender Baldock died in Greece – where he was playing for Panathinaikos – on Wednesday at the age of 31.

Two members of Bellamy’s squad, Adam Davies and Rhys Norrington-Davies, had been team-mates of Baldock at Bramall Lane over the past few seasons before his summer departure to Greece.

Wales make four changes

Craig Bellamy has brought changes for this match with four swaps in personnel.

Danny Ward replaces Karl Darlow in goal while Chris Mepham is taken from defence and gets replaced by Sorba Thomas.

Ethan Ampadu and Lewis Koumas drop out with Jordan James and Brennan Johson replacing them. It’s a balanced line-up and expect the full backs to get forward when Wales have possession.

Bellamy reflects on first camp

“I couldn’t have enjoyed it any more,” Craig Bellamy said of his first camp in charge of Wales. “The players were exceptional. I’m always conscious of the amount of information we give because we don’t want to overload but, when we spoke to the players, they wanted more.

“It’s new to me as well. I was conscious of everyone telling me you only have so many days with them. I’ve never really felt it was that way. Footballers are really intelligent, they can take more than you can give because they’re the ones playing, the ones who have a feel for the game.

“If you can show why - and there has to be a why in everything you do - they start to feel that and see it for themselves then go with it even more. That was the most pleasing aspect of it all.”

Davies excited for Iceland game

Ben Davies echoed Craig Bellamy’s thoughts but added that playing for Wales brings a new level of excitement. He said: “There’s excitement and a bit of added pressure to repeat it [from the last camp]. All we can do is try and play the exciting football that we can and try and win games.

“We have a plan and we have to stick to that. We try to be dominant on the ball and create as many chances as we can. We try to make games exciting and I think we showed that in the first couple of games.”

The defender also addressed being named captian of the national team saying: “It’s always a privilege to captain your country,.

“I love doing it and that will never grow old on me. It’s the best feeling in football to be honest.”

Bellamy won’t ‘play down’ expectations

Wales manager Craig Bellamy says he is aware of the expectations on the team and promised to never ‘play them down’ as the national side look to qualify for the top league in the Nations League and reach the next World Cup.

“I’d be worried if there wasn’t expectations,” said Bellamy. “I certainly don’t believe in ever trying to play them down. I don’t think that would be fair to people who come to watch.

“We have a level of patience but also understanding within the group, we have to be sensible as well, but for anyone whether it’s the public or whatever, if they’re excited that’s exactly where we want them to be.

“I certainly wouldn’t play that down. I’ve got to be honest, I’m excited.”

George Baldock’s fiancee pays tribute after footballer dies in Greek swimming pool

George Baldock’s fiancee paid tribute to “the perfect dad” after the footballer was found dead in a swimming pool in Greece.

Baldock drowned in the pool of his new home in Athens, having signed for Greek giants Panathinaikos in the summer. Greek police said there was no evidence that criminal activity caused the death of the former Sheffield United defender.

Annabel Dignam, with whom Baldock had son Brody, posted a message on Instagram and revealed he had been due to fly home this week to celebrate his son’s first birthday.

Iceland vs Wales prediction

With Wales travelling away from home and still getting used to life under Craig Bellamy expect a performance that feels incomplete at times.

They’ll have to weather some pressure especially early on but there’s enough quality in the forward line to score at least one goal which may just be enough to nick a win.

Iceland will be confident though and it’s easy to see how this match plays out in a draw.

Iceland 1-1 Wales.
