On Thursday, the Swiss national team will kick off the new international season with an away game against Denmark. The most important change: Gregor Kobel has replaced Yann Sommer as number 1. "That was my dream as a young boy," says Kobel on the day before the game.

Gregor Kobel is in a great mood. No wonder. Because since Yann Sommer's retirement from the national team two weeks ago, it has been clear that the BVB goalie is Switzerland's new number one. He was as happy as a cockchafer when he received the news, said goalkeeping coach Patrick Foletti on Tuesday.

Nati goalkeeping coach Foletti speaks now
"Maybe Kobel wanted to become number 1 a little too early"

Kobel confirmed on Wednesday: "Playing in the national team is the greatest thing. It was already my dream as a little boy. So I was very pleased. I think that's normal," says the 26-year-old with a broad grin. He was in Yann Sommer's shadow for a long time, he had to wait a long time for his chance. Now it's here.

Great respect for Sommer

He hasn't had any contact with Sommer since his retirement: "I respect him very much and have great respect for his career. That's why I haven't commented on this topic until today," explains Kobel. "The time belongs to him now."

He is now facing a new challenge that is not comparable to club football, where he has been one of the best for years. "It's a huge honor for me to wear the national team jersey. It will be even nicer if I can do it more often now," says Kobel, who is also part of the new national team squad.

On Thursday, he will stand between the posts for Switzerland for only the sixth time against Denmark. For the first time as a regular goalkeeper. Kobel: "I'm incredibly proud."

Zubi speaks plainly
"It may well be that Akanji & Co. are annoyed by Kobel"

That's it

The press conference is over.

Kobel on the news of being the new number 1

"Playing in the national team is the greatest thing. It was already my dream as a little boy. So I was very happy. I think that's also normal."

Who will play alongside Akanji in central defense?

Yakin: "There are various options. The playful option, the more stable option, the old familiar option ... We can't replace Schär one-to-one. We've now had two training sessions, we haven't been able to rehearse much. I have my thoughts, there are various options. I expect a tough duel against Denmark."

Who will take the penalties?

After Shaqiri's retirement, the question arises as to who will take the penalties in the national team. Yakin ponders for a long time, then Kobel raises his hand. The journalists laugh. Then Yakin says: "A mean question. The captain decides during the game. There are two or three selections beforehand. If no one feels comfortable, Granit Xhaka decides."

Kobel new to the national team council

"This is a new challenge for me. I want to perform, prove myself on the pitch and also create a good atmosphere. We have great personalities in the national team that I respect very much."

Kobel on the long wait for number 1 status

"At the end of the day, we're all professional athletes and want to play all the games. I've always tried to put myself at the service of the team. I want to continue with this mentality and play my part in the team's success so that we can all go full throttle."

Kobel on goalie coach Foletti

"I've known Fox for a long time, I really appreciate and respect him. We have a very professional relationship. He's very freaky in a positive sense, I respect his work a lot."

Nati goalkeeping coach Foletti speaks now
"Maybe Kobel wanted to become number 1 a little too early"
Yakin on the goals of the national team

"We want to play successful football and are taking the Nations League very seriously because it's also important for the World Cup qualifiers. There are two or three changes in the team. We definitely want to stay in League A. We're looking game by game, and now we're up against Denmark, a good opponent. I'm delighted, also for Gregor Kobel, for whom it's a new situation."

Kobel on Sommer

"I respect him a lot and have great respect for his career. That's why I haven't commented on this topic until today. I haven't had any contact with him since he retired. The time belongs to him now."

Yakin on the system against Denmark

"I won't be announcing the line-up today. We'll play a system with two central midfielders. I'm trying to field the best players. I can also imagine Zakaria in defense."
