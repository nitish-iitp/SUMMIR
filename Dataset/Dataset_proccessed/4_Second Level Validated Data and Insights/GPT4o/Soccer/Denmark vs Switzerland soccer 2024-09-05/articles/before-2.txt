After both reached the knockout phase of Euro 2024, Denmark and Switzerland will kick off their quests for UEFA Nations League glory on Thursday.

The teams convene in Copenhagen, aiming to make a fast start to their League A Group 4 campaign.

Following a frustrating time at this summer's European Championship, Denmark will seek their first win in five matches on Thursday evening, as they return to Parken Stadion for the first time since their last-16 exit.

The Danes did not win a game in the group stage, scoring just two of the seven goals in a sterile Group C, although Morten Hjulmand's superb strike against England will be remembered as one of the goals of the tournament.

Having eked through the first phase, Denmark's knockout contest with hosts Germany was disrupted by a storm, after which the luckless Joachim Andersen was involved in events that saw his nation eliminated: first he had a goal ruled out for a marginal offside, moments later he handled the ball and conceded a penalty.

Following a 2-0 defeat, coach Kasper Hjulmand stood down, having previously led his country to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and through qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where they failed to register a win and finished bottom of their group.

Hjulmand also oversaw two Nations League upsets against France, as Denmark finished second in League A Group 1 last time around - just one point shy of winners Croatia and a place in the finals.

With an overall record of 33 wins from 55 matches - effectively a 60% win rate - he will be a hard act to follow; a caretaker coaching team leads the squad this week, during which the Danes host both Switzerland and Euro 2024 foes Serbia.

In a group also featuring reigning Nations League champions Spain - fresh from their sparkling Euros success - Switzerland cannot afford to slip up if they are to make it through to the final tournament next June.

Though they ultimately exited the European Championship in the quarter-finals again, losing on penalties to eventual finalists England, the Rossocrociati will still have fond memories of swatting aside holders Italy in Dusseldorf.

Having beaten Hungary and drawn with Scotland and Germany during the group stage, Switzerland had strung together an eight-game unbeaten streak across all competitions, and - penalties aside - they have lost just once since the last World Cup.

With three wins and three losses from a tough section including Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic, Murat Yakin's men failed to reach the most recent Nations League finals, though another strong showing in Germany will boost hopes that they can do so on this occasion.

Yakin was not universally popular heading into the Euro 2024 campaign, but with his authority renewed and an experienced squad available, Switzerland can contend for a top-two spot in Group 4.

Having undergone ankle surgery after suffering a serious injury on his Brighton & Hove Albion debut - just days after completing a £25m move from Celtic - Matt O'Riley has been ruled out of Denmark's squad.

Maurits Kjaergaard was then called up as replacement, but following his subsequent withdrawal, Brentford's Mathias Jensen has been added by interim coach Lars Knudsen.

The latter was only appointed after stand-in boss Morten Wieghorst went on sick leave, and he will rely on the experience of international-cap centurions Kasper Schmeichel and Christian Eriksen. However, Barcelona's Andreas Christensen and Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund are both unavailable.

Meanwhile, Switzerland have waved goodbye to veteran goalkeeper Yann Sommer, who announced his national-team retirement after Euro 2024, so Gregor Kobel should start between the posts on Thursday evening.

Long-serving forward Xherdan Shaqiri has also ended his time with the Rossocrociati after scoring 32 goals - including several at major finals - in 125 appearances; Newcastle United defender Fabian Schar is solely concentrating on club football too.

Otherwise, it is a familiar squad that travels to Copenhagen, with captain Granit Xhaka leading the visitors' midfield and Manuel Akanji still the main man in defence.


Denmark possible starting lineup:
Schmeichel; Vestergaard, Nelsson, Andersen; Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Dorgu; Eriksen, Skov Olsen; Wind

Switzerland possible starting lineup:
Kobel; Akanji, Elvedi, Rodriguez; Ndoye, Xhaka, Freuler, Aebischer; Vargas, Okafor; Embolo



We say: Denmark 1-1 Switzerland

Switzerland should start favourites, but Denmark tend to raise their game at Parken and could hold out for a point on the opening matchday.

Without a permanent manager or their star striker, the Danes may struggle to subdue an impressive Swiss side who are edging closer to Europe's elite.
