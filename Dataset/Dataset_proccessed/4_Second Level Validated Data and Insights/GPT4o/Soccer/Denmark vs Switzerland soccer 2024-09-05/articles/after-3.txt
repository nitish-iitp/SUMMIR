Denmark defeated Switzerland 2-0 at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen on Thursday night after Denmark’s Høgbjerg sealed the win two minutes into stoppage time.

Denmark came out firing to kick off their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign on Thursday.

Outside of the stadium before the match, we met the Danish supporter Carl, who has high hopes for his team in this year’s Nations League.

– I’m looking forward to seeing the team prepare for the next World Cup in 2026. I believe Christian Eriksen will be our most impressive player even though he is beginning to age, he said.

And Carl had reason to celebrate after the game, as Denmark gained 3 points in the standing, and now sit atop of their group.

During the game Switzerland was able to survive a flurry of chances but eventually their luck ran out.

The Danes were struggling to score even after Swiss defender Nico Elvedi got handed a red card in the fifty-second minute. 

But defender Patrick Dorgu was finally able to find the back of the net for Denmark in the eighty-second minute to make it 1-0 just moments after he was subbed in. The goal was followed by a fight which led to multiple yellow cards on both sides. 

Shortly after Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka was given Switzerland’s second red card of the match leaving them with just nine men on the pitch for the final minutes of the match. 

Danish midfielder Pierre-Emile Høgbjerg sealed the victory with a goal 2 minutes into stoppage time to make it 2-0.
