Former Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka was sent off in a fiery clash between Denmark and Switzerland on Thursday night.

After a relatively uneventful first half between Denmark and Switzerland on Thursday, the game sparked into life in the second period.

First, Switzerland’s Silvan Widmer was booked for wasting time. A few minutes later, Nico Elvedi was sent off for a last-man foul on Kasper Dolberg.

Denmark stepped up the pressure, but Switzerland managed to hold out at 0-0 with 10 men until the final eight minutes of the game.

With Switzerland’s Breel Embolo writhing on the ground claiming a foul, Denmark ran up the other end and took the lead through Patrick Dorgu.

Granit Xhaka was incensed by the decision, and he earned a yellow card for his complaints. He wasn’t the only one booked, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Morten Hjulmand, and Manuel Akanji also receiving yellow cards in the ensuing argument.

A few minutes later, Xhaka caught Spurs loanee Hojbjerg with a very late challenge – albeit a relatively harmless one – and was shown a second yellow card.

Hojbjerg went on to score a second for Denmark, who took all three points from the contest.

“He is a top footballer, but he is also a bit of a b***h,” Joachim Andersen said of Xhaka after the game.

“We know Granit, and he can go to it once in a while and get a little angry on the pitch. That’s the way it is. He is a player I have a lot of respect for, and sometimes you can lose your head.

“I think he has been good at keeping calm for many years, but today he lost his head a little.”

Xhaka will now be suspended for Switzerland’s match against Spain on Sunday.
