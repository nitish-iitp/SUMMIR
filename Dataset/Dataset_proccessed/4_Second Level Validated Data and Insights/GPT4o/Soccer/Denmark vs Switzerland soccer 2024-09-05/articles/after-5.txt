Denmark and Switzerland meet in their Nations League campaign opener

Denmark will welcome Switzerland to Parken Stadium in the group stage of the UEFA Nations League on Thursday. Both teams played in League A in the 2022-23 campaign but failed to qualify for the knockout stage.

The hosts suffered their first loss of the year in their previous outing, losing 2-0 to Germany in the UEFA Euro 2024 round of 16 in June. Interestingly, they had a winless run in the competition, drawing their three group-stage games.

The visitors have also suffered just one loss in 2024 across all competitions. They met England in the quarterfinals of Euro 2024 in their previous outing and, after the scoreline ended 1-1 after extra time, they suffered a 5-3 loss in the penalty shootout.
