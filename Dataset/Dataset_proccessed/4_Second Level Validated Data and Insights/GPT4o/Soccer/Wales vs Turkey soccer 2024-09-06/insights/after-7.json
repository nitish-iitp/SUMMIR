        "Wales' Ben Davies attempts an acrobatic shot past Turkey's Abdulkerim Bardakci.",

        "A huge chance for Wales to nick it, as substitute Lewis Koumas jigs his way down the left and pulls back for Brennan Johnson, who spins on the spot only for his effort to get deflected wide.",
        "The ten men nearly take the lead with four minutes remaining! A corner fizzed in from the left. Abd\u00fclkerim Bardakc\u0131 meets it with a powerful downward header but Danny Ward handles confidently on his goalline.",
        "Kieffer Moore is fine to continue, but he\u2019s all bandaged up having had his forehead cut open.",
        "RED CARD: Bar\u0131\u015f Alper Y\u0131lmaz (Turkey). Y\u0131lmaz was slightly unfortunate to get booked in the first half after a 50-50 kerfuffle with Joe Rodon. But he knows he\u2019s on a booking, and going in late on Neco Williams isn\u2019t the wisest move. Studs on top of boot. An argument that it could be a red by itself, though it\u2019s probably more like an orange. But a second yellow is enough to send him packing.",
        "Aaron Ramsey misses his third good chance of the evening, heading Harry Wilson\u2019s cross over the bar from 12 yards.",
        "Harry Wilson pearls a rising screamer that only just flies wide of the top-right corner.",
        "Connor Roberts curls a sensational ball in from the right. It drops to Joe Rodon, six yards out and all alone. He\u2019s been played onside, and has to score, but leans back and shanks his sidefooted effort yards over the bar."
