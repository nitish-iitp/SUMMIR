WALES VS. TURKEY - PREDICTION

It's hard to know what to expect from Wales here given they're under the guidance of a new manager. These two sides have faced off three times in the last few years, with both sides winning one game each while the other ended in a draw.

Even amidst their final few years with Page in charge, which was deemed a poor period, Wales have won three of their last five games on home soil, which included a 2-1 win over Croatia. They're also unbeaten in their last five home games, excluding penalty shootouts.

Overall, a mild improvement in the team under Bellamy should see Wales good enough for a point from this one, with the Dragons generally a tough nut to crack on their own turf. Wales 1-1 Turkey.

WALES VS. TURKEY: PREDICTION, PREVIEW & BETTING TIPS

This Friday, Wales will take on Turkey in what promises to be an intriguing encounter in the UEFA Nations League.

Date: 06/09/2024
Kick-off time: 19:45
Location: Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff

Wales enter this match amidst a period of significant change. The departure of Rob Page after a four-year tenure has ushered in a new era, with former player Craig Bellamy stepping into the managerial role. Bellamy, who enjoyed an eventful playing career, is relatively inexperienced as a manager, and this lack of experience brings both uncertainty and a sense of optimism. For Welsh fans, Bellamy’s appointment offers hope after what was perceived as a stagnation in the team’s progress during the final years of Page’s management.

Page’s time at the helm was a mixed bag. While he led Wales to the knockout stages of Euro 2020 and secured a spot in the 2022 World Cup, the last two years have been less fruitful. The team’s failure to qualify for Euro 2024 was particularly disheartening, with their campaign ending in a penalty shootout defeat to Poland. This result not only deprived Wales of a place in the tournament but also symbolised the team’s struggles to recapture the form and spirit that had seen them punch above their weight on the international stage in previous years.

Bellamy now faces the daunting task of reinvigorating a squad that is in the midst of a transition. The departure of key players like Gareth Bale and Joe Allen has left a void in both experience and leadership, while Aaron Ramsey, once the heartbeat of the team, is now in the twilight of his career. The need to integrate new talent into the team is pressing, and Bellamy has already shown a willingness to bring fresh faces into the fold.

Among the new names in the Welsh setup are Owen Beck, Charlie Crew, and Lewis Koumas. These young players represent the future of Welsh football, but their lack of experience at the club level means they will need to be carefully managed. Crew and Koumas, in particular, are promising talents, but they are still very much in the early stages of their development. Bellamy’s challenge will be to strike a balance between nurturing this new generation and maintaining a competitive edge in what is a challenging Nations League group.

In stark contrast to Wales, Turkey are coming into this match on a high following their best tournament performance in over 15 years. Under the guidance of Vincenzo Montella, Turkey reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024, a significant achievement for a team that has often been labelled as underachievers on the international stage. This summer’s success has helped shake off the reputation of Turkey as a team that “bottles” it when the stakes are high.

Turkey’s journey to the last eight of Euro 2024 was marked by a series of impressive performances, and they only narrowly lost to the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Montella’s tactical acumen and ability to get the best out of his players were key factors in this success. His management has been widely praised in Turkey, and there is a sense that the national team is finally realising its potential.

Montella also looks keen to integrate new talent into the squad, with one of the most exciting prospects being 17-year-old Mustafa Hekimoğlu. The young forward, who plays for Beşiktaş, is seen as one of the brightest talents in Turkish football. Hekimoğlu’s inclusion in the senior squad at such a young age is a testament to his ability, but it also highlights Montella’s willingness to take risks and invest in the future.

Turkey’s recent success has created a positive atmosphere around the team, but there is also a recognition that they need to build on this momentum. The Nations League offers Turkey a chance to continue their upward trajectory and establish themselves as a force on the European stage, with a view to continuing their development in pursuit of a long-awaited place back at the World Cup.

TEAM NEWS

Wales Team News:

Predicted lineup: Ward; Williams, Rodon, Mepham, Davies; James, Ampadu, Ramsey; Johnson, Moore, Koumas.

Turkey Team News:

Full-back Ferdi Kadıoğlu is unavailable after an inactive first few weeks of the season, delayed by a transfer to Brighton & Hove Albion. Ahmetcan Kaplan is also unavailable while Yunus Akgün has not been called up.

WALES VS. TURKEY - FORM GUIDE

Wales are coming off the back of a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Slovakia in what was a sorry performance and result - a result that proved the final nail in the coffin for Rob Page.

Prior to that, Wales drew 0-0 with Gibraltar, a result that was arguably as bad as the one that followed it given the rank of the opponent, with all due respect to Gibraltar.

Wales were faced with a Euro 2024 play-off final against Poland in Cardiff, a game that ended 0-0 after a performance where Wales will feel like they edged the better of the play. Regardless, though, that was worth very little as they were beaten in a penalty shootout.

Before that came Wales' last feel-good moment as they ran out convincing 4-1 winners over Finland in their Euro 2024 play-off semi-final, where David Brooks, Neco Williams, Brennan Johnson and Dan James grabbed the goals.

That result was preceded by a 1-1 draw against this week's opponents, Turkey, where Williams' early goal was cancelled out by a Yusuf Yazıcı penalty.

Turkey's most recent game was a 2-1 loss to the Netherlands in the quarter-final of Euro 2024. Turkey took the lead in the first half through Samet Akaydin, in a first 45 where they generally frustrated the Dutch. However, a late blitz in the second half saw the Netherlands turn the game on its head through Stefan de Vrij and a Mert Müldür own goal in the 70th and 76th minutes, a pair of goals that decided the game. Turkey will, though, have been hugely frustrated to miss a number of very good chances late in the game, with Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen making a number of outstanding saves.

Prior to that, Turkey beat Austria 2-1 thanks to a brace from Merih Demiral. Turkey took a deserved 2-0 lead and despite coming under the cosh for the final half an hour, with Mert Günok making a couple of excellent saves, they held on for a monumental victory.

That win followed a 2-1 win over the Czechia, with the goals coming from Hakan Çalhanoğlu and Cenk Tosun in a game where Turkey were fairly disappointing against an opponent that played the majority of the game with ten men.

That game was preceded by a 0-3 drubbing at the hands of Portugal, which followed a fine 3-1 win over Georgia in one of the most entertaining games in the history of the European Championship group stages, with Müldür, Arda Güler and Kerem Aktürkoğlu sealing the win.
