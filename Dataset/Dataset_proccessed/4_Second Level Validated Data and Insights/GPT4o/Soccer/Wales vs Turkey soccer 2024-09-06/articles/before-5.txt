Wales vs Turkey Preview
Tournament: UEFA Nations League
Date: Friday, 6ᵗʰ September
Kick-off time: 6:45 PM GMT
Venue: Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff

The first round of the UEFA Nations League 2024/25 will include Wales hosting Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium. Both nations are a part of Group Four in the second tier of the current Nations League campaign. Turkey will start as the slight favourites but the Welsh threat cannot be overlooked. It will certainly be an exciting watch for the fans since the hosts have not scored in their last three matches while the visitors have failed to keep a clean sheet in six games.

Wales will commence a new era in its football journey with the appointment of Craig Bellamy as the head coach. Since the memorable World Cup run in Qatar, the Welsh have endured mixed results with several experienced players including Gareth Bale announcing their retirements. In the last six matches, Wales has managed a solitary victory along with four draws and a defeat. The nation failed to qualify for the Euros in Germany and will now look to bounce back on a positive note.

Turkey, on the other hand, was the surprise of the summer. The country went all the way to the quarter-finals of the European Championship, delivering several impressive displays. Coach, Vincenzo Montella has been able to frame a perfect blend of youth and experience in his camp. Turkey has witnessed the rise of numerous talents over the summer who will now have another chance to settle in better at the international level. Turkey will be confident to finish the group at the top which also includes Iceland and Montenegro.

Coach, Craig Bellamy has confirmed in his recent press conferences that Aaron Ramsey will be included in his squad and will also serve as the captain. The former Juventus midfielder will be a key piece owing to his time at the top. Wales will have to deal with the massive absence of Daniel James, who had to leave the national team camp due to a hamstring injury.

Vincenzo Montella is expected to continue with his hybrid 5-4-1 system which can modify to a three-at-the-back in possession. The formation brought the Italian coach plenty of joy and success at the Euros. Baris Yilmaz will lead the line as the target man and will be supported by Kenan Yildiz and Arda Guler on either side. Set-pieces will be a great weapon for Turkey against Wales due to the superior physicality in its ranks.

Predicted Line-ups

Wales Predicted Line-up (3-5-2): Ward; Rodon, Cabango, Davies; Roberts, James, Ampadu, Williams; Wilson, Johnson; Matondo

Turkey Predicted Line-Up (5-4-1): Günok; Muldur, Ayhan, Akaydin, Demiral, Kadioglu; Guler, Ozcan, Calhanoglu, Yildiz; Yilmaz

Head-to-Head Stats

Wales and Turkey have been frequent opponents over the years. The last outing between the two sides occurred in late 2023 at the Euro Qualifiers. The nations played out a 1-1 draw which ultimately proved detrimental to the Welsh qualification journey. Bellamy’s side will be hungry to take revenge against Turkey on their home soil.

Last five H2H results:

Wales 1-1 Turkey (2023. Euro Qualifiers)

Turkey 2-0 Wales (2023, Euro Qualifiers)

Turkey 0-2 Wales (2021, Euros)

Turkey 6-4 Wales (1997, World Cup Qualifiers)

Wales 0-0 Turkey (1996, World Cup Qualifiers)

Key Players to Watch in Wales vs Turkey
Arda Guler (Turkey)

The Real Madrid youngster was sensational at the European Championship, scoring a goal whilst also providing two assists. Guler had a troublesome 2023 due to injury woes but has been on a remarkable run in 2024. Although his minutes have been limited with his club this season, Montella will not sacrifice his starting position in the eleven. The 19-year-old will start on the right flank and will gradually drift inwards with his close dribbling ability. Arda Guler will also be a handful from set pieces thanks to his wonderful left foot.

Mert Günok (Turkey)

Turkey is expected to dominate the game against Wales but can also expect quality chances at its goal from the Welsh. One of the biggest reasons for the Turkish success at the Euros was its goalkeeper, Mert Günok. The 35-year-old who plays for Besiktas in the Süper Lig delivered a quite outstanding shot-stopping display. His incredible last-minute save against Austria in the round of 16 was voted by many as the moment of the tournament. Günok’s performances in the Nations League will have a huge bearing on Turkey’s run.

Wales vs Turkey Prediction

Craig Bellamy will feel that they can cause damage and unrest to Turkey but the Dragons face a monstrous task to earn a victory. Both sides will be looking to go in with the strongest XIs in the opening game of the new Nations League season. Turkey will be confident to negate the Welsh hurdle with enough quality accompanied by a strong bench as well. If Turkey can find the top gear from the start it can get pretty worse for the hosts.

Predicted Score: Wales 1-3 Turkey
