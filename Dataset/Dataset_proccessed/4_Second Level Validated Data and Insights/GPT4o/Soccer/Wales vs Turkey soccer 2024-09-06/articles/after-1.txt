Referee Rohit Saggi speaks to Wales pair Aaron Ramsey and Ethan Ampadu in the goalless Nations League draw with Turkey (David Davies/PA) (PA Wire)

Craig Bellamy’s first match in charge of the Welsh national team was an exciting and promising affair that displayed how he wants them to play going forward. The Dragons hosted Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium and drew 0-0 in a positive performance that had flair and style.

From the get-go Wales were the more aggressive team. They took charge of the ball and utilised the pace of forwards Brennan Johnson and Sorba Thomas who set up on either wing. In the middle Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson juggled playmaking duties admirably as Wales created the better chances over the first 45 minutes.

Ramsey nodded a chance over the top and Joe Rodon failed to convert from close range. The best chance fell to Thomas who broke through the lines and perfectly lobbed the goalkeeper only to be ruled offside.

In the second half there was hope of a famous win after Baris Yilmaz collected a second yellow card and Turkey went down to 10 men. Bellamy made substitutions to try and keep the energy levels high, but Wales couldn’t break the deadlock, and the match finished goalless.

Not the result the Welsh fans wanted but they were encouraged by the performance. Bellamy has Wales playing exciting football.

Wales vs Turkey LIVE

Wales open their Nations League campaign against Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium on Friday looking for the perfect start to Craig Bellamy’s reign.

Former Wales captain Bellamy was appointed manager in early July and has set about preparing Wales as they look to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, though the Nations League provides the first chances to shape his team and test themselves against similar opposition.

Nevertheless, their first test is against a Turkey side that many will feel are far superior to The Dragons, with players such as Real Madrid’s Arda Guler and Inter Milan’s Hakan Çalhanoğlu having helped them to the quarter-finals of Euro 2024.

Turkey left Germany disappointed after a narrow loss to the Netherlands, but their future is in safe hands and head coach Vincenzo Montella will look to build on an inspiring summer, starting with a win in Cardiff.

Wales’ early team news

Craig Bellamy’s first Wales squad features many of the names that fans have become used to seeing, including Ethan Ampadu and Aaron Ramsey, who Bellamy announced will retain the captaincy.

Ipswich pair Nathan Broadhead and Wes Burns were not considered due to injury, and nor was Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks, while winger Dan James has been ruled out through injury.

Bellamy has added 33-year-old Karl Darlow as goalkeeping back-up, while recalling Mark Harris and Oli Cooper for the first time in over a year. Sorba Thomas has also been recalled, having left Huddersfield last summer to join Ligue 1 club Nantes on loan.

Wales vs Turkey prediction

Wales begin a new era under Craig Bellamy and several players will be desperate to impress, so Wales should be able to find a result against a Turkey side who performed well at Euro 2024. Turkey have more quality in their ranks, but the nature of the match means Wales should be able to get at least a draw.

Wales 1-1 Turkey.

The return of the Nations League: Groups, favourites and what’s new in 2024/25 as Spain defend crown

An expanded Uefa Nations League is upon us as the first international break of the Premier League season ramps up.

The fourth edition of this competition adds an extra knockout round and maintains the jeopardy of promotion and relegation in its mini leagues – a fate England know too well after dropping to League B following a poor string of results in 2022.

Designed to eliminate meaningless international friendlies in favour of pitting similarly ranked nations against each other in a competitive environment, the Nations League has proven a springboard to success for previous winners Portugal, France and Spain.

England’s best result remains the third-place finish they achieved under Gareth Southgate in the 2018/19 inaugural edition. This time out, Lee Carsley’s men will aim for promotion back to the elite.

Bellamy hoping to introduce new style of play

Craig Bellamy will begin his much-anticipated reign as Wales head coach on Friday with a Nations League match against Turkey in Cardiff.

He has used his first training sessions with the squad to implement a progressive new style of play and tonight’s game will provide an insight into how the team are developing.

“It’s going to be a very proud moment. I’ve worked hard for this and I’m going to recognise that,” said Bellamy, “But that moment when the game gets going, I’m not paid to be emotional. I’m paid to make the best decisions possible on the side.

“That’s the business I’m in straight away. Of course I’m proud and I’m fully aware that the moment is going to catch me. But it has to leave very quickly because there’s a big responsibility and the players need me as well in that moment.

“When I look back on my career I wished I’d enjoyed it more. I’m fully aware of what it means representing your country. But I want to enjoy it by being calm and clear on every situation that can occur in the game.”
