NATIONS LEAGUE: CRAIG BELLAMY'S WALES HELD BY 10-MAN TURKEY, KEVIN DE BRUYNE HITS BRACE IN BELGIUM WIN OVER ISRAEL
BYLEON IMBER

PUBLISHED 06/09/2024 AT 21:27 GMT

Craig Bellamy took charge of Wales for the first time on Friday as he led his side to a 0-0 draw with 10-man Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium. Wales were dominant without capitalising on their numerical advantage after Baris Alper Yilmaz was shown a red card on 62 minutes, but showed positive signs under their new manager's leadership as they held the Euro 2024 quarter-finalists goalless.

Wales had to settle for a point in their Nations League B opener as they struggled to find a way past 10-man Turkey despite a strong performance at the Cardiff City Stadium.
The clash was Craig Bellamy's first in charge of Wales, after being appointed on a four-year deal in July following the dismissal of previous boss Rob Page - and there was plenty of promise on show from the new-look side.

Wales had the better of the chances against the Euro 2024 quarter-finalists, but failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage after Turkey's Baris Alper Yilmaz was dismissed for a second booking on 62 minutes.

Yilmaz saw yellow for his protests after not being awarded a penalty on 31 minutes, and was sent off 17 minutes after the break for catching the boot of Neco Williams.
The Galatasaray striker's infringements were indicative of a frustrating night for Turkey, as Wales showed comfort in possession, while also forging multiple chances to take the lead.
Turkey, meanwhile, managed just one shot on target as they were largely reliant upon counterattacks following long spells of pressure from the home side.

De Bruyne stars for Belgium
Kevin De Bruyne was on hand to fire Belgium past Israel, with the Manchester City star scoring twice as Domenico Tedesco's side cruised to a 3-1 victory over Israel.
In their first match since the disappointing round-of-16 exit at Euro 2024, Belgium showcased their undoubted quality with a dominant performance in Debrecen held behind closed doors.
De Bruyne opened the scoring on 21 minutes, but Belgium were pegged back before half-time as Timothy Castagne turned the ball into his own net nine minutes before the break.
Belgium fought back in style as Youri Tielemans scored three minutes after the break, with De Bruyne adding his brace four minutes later.
Lois Openda could have made matters worse for Israel just minutes later, but his spot-kick was saved by Yoav Gerafi
Italy responded to going a goal behind within the first minute to defeat Euro 2024 semi-finalists France 3-1.
In League B, Slovenia and Austria played out a 1-1 draw, while Iceland defeated Montenegro 2-0.
Erling Haaland was in action for Norway but failed to score as his side drew 0-0 with Kazakhstan.
In League C, Cyprus edged out Lithuania with a 1-0 victory, while Romania defeated 10-man Kosovo 3-0.
