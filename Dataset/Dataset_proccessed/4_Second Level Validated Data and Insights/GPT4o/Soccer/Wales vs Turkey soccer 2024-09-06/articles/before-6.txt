Turkey

There will be fireworks when Wales and Turkey go head to head in an eagerly-awaited Nations League game on Friday evening. The Dragons continue life without Gareth Bale, who retired from international football and, no doubt, they are eager to make amends for a heavy 4-0 loss to Slovakia. New boss Craig Bellamy has included the likes of Ollie Cooper and Mark Harris to the squad as well as Leeds United goalkeeper Karl Darlow.

The Turks, on the other hand, did well to make it to the EURO 2024 quarter-finals, meaning that they are high on confidence ahead of the trip to Cardiff. A man to watch in the away team will be Real Madrid rising star Arda Gular, who enjoyed a very successful EURO 2024 campaign. As under 2.5 goals have been netted in each of the previous three meetings between the two sides, a low-scoring affair is on the cards at Cardiff City Stadium.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (HAKAN CALHANOGLU):

Hakan Calhanoglu is another one in the long line of Turkish footballers who were born in Germany, so it is hardly surprising he came to prominence thanks to his performances in Bundesliga. The attacking midfielder with great vision and very good goalscoring record started his professional career at Karlsruher, scoring impressive 17 goals in 50 league outings to earn a move to Bundesliga side Hamburg.

The spell at Imtech Arena was merely a stepping stone for bigger things as 11 goals in his debut top flight campaign persuaded Bayer Leverkusen to splash nearly €15 million on his services. That proved a very good investment as Calhanoglu continued the rich vein of form, and it is now a matter of time before he joins one of European powerhouses.

The midfield maestro had a bright start to his career in the Turkey national team, scoring 5 goals in first 16 caps, and chances are he will become a leader for Milli Takim in the foreseeable future.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (WALES):

Despite being part of the United Kingdom, Wales national football team has been competing in FIFA tournaments since 1950, although they have so far only reached two tournament finals. The Dragons surprised everyone by making it to the quarter-finals at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, but little did they know that it would remain their only World Cup appearance up to date.

Wales had plenty of problems in the European Championship qualifiers as well, but they finally managed to end the barren run by securing their place at the Euro 2016 in France. Led by the likes of Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Ashley Williams, the Dragons performed admirably throughout the campaign and even reached the 8th position in the FIFA Rankings in October 2015.

Neville Southall remains the team’s most capped player, but the generation that included Ryan Giggs, Gary Speed, Craig Bellamy and John Hartson will also be remembered for some impressive performances against top European national teams.
