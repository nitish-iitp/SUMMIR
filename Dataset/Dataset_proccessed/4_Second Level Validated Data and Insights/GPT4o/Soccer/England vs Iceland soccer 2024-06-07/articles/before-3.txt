And while several were players who were expected to be dropped from the provisional 33-man squad Southgate named last month, the decision to axe Grealish sent shockwaves through football - both inside and outside the England camp.

The Telegraph have revealed that players within St. Georges' Park were shocked to learn that the Manchester City winger would not be going to Germany, with one senior player even seeking out Southgate to discuss the decision.

England v Iceland recap - Southgate's men lose final Euro 2024 friendly
England squad for Euro 2024 announced with Grealish among seven officially axed

It's said that the player in question approached Southgate in order to better understand the decision and, in turn, explain it to team-mates, who are said to have rallied round the former Aston Villa man.

Although it's stressed that there were no confrontations in the wake of the decision, it's also outlined that Grealish was 'stunned and upset' upon learning that he would not be a part of England's squad for the Euros.

Grealish struggled for form at Manchester City last season and Southgate revealed that the performances of other players in the squad played a major part in his decision to leave the winger behind.

Join the debate! Has Southgate got it wrong by getting rid of Grealish? Let us know here.

Speaking in his pre-match press conference ahead of Friday's match against Iceland, Southgate said: "All the players took the news really respectfully. Of course, all players will believe they should be in, and that’s why they are top players. They have that self-belief and mindset, but the fact is we have some players who have been playing extremely well all season in the league".

On his decision to omit Grealish and Maddison, he added: "We just feel other players had stronger seasons, particularly in the last six months or so.
