England 0 Iceland 1: Mainoo’s audition, a disjointed press and are they really Euros favourites?
By Rob Tanner and Liam Tharme

So much for England’s celebratory send-off for Euro 2024.

Gareth Southgate’s side conceded the first goal in a game at Wembley — yet again — and could only huff and puff in search of an equaliser as Iceland, who failed to qualify for this month’s tournament, secured a historic first win there. This was a downbeat way to finish preparations before the team depart for Germany.

Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson — who was in Fulham’s academy ranks for four years but left without playing for their first team — scored the only goal of a disjointed affair early on, after cutting in off the left and firing a shot through John Stones’ legs, beyond the unsighted Aaron Ramsdale and inside the near post. That rather sucked the optimism out of the evening as England struggled to break down a massed defence.

Harry Kane spurned a fine opportunity to equalise from Cole Palmer’s delightful delivery, but there was grumbling discontent in the stands at the interval with the hosts trailing. Palmer himself went close to drawing them level after the break, but the few chances England created were missed. There were boos at the final whistle.

Southgate and his players must hope for better things when the competitive football starts against Serbia next Sunday. Rob Tanner and Liam Tharme were at Wembley to break down some of the main talking points from the game.

What is it about Wembley and England conceding the first goal?

England have set a lot of records under Southgate, but this is one to which they would not want to lay claim: going 1-0 down in three consecutive Wembley games for the first time since November 1954, after doing so against both Belgium and Brazil in March.

There was plenty to dislike about all three of the opening goals they shipped in those matches.

Belgium and Brazil both exploited errors at the back, showing their own cutting edge, but Iceland’s was an aggregation of bad defending. England did not press aggressively enough down the right and Iceland split their press with one pass; then John Stones over-committed himself to allow a clear shot at goal and Aaron Ramsdale was caught out by the near-post shot.

These are not lapses England can afford at the tournament, especially with a makeshift defence.

Did Kobbie Mainoo prove he should be a starter?

Gareth Southgate’s starting lineup for that opening group game against Serbia seems written in stone, fitness permitting, except for one position — the third midfield spot.

The two main contenders to partner Declan Rice in the deeper lying roles seem to be Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo — though Trent Alexander-Arnold might be an alternative option — and both have been given the opportunity to impress in the build-up to the tournament. But on the evidence of tonight, it is the Manchester United man who seems the most likely to start a week on Sunday in Gelsenkirchen, handed the deeper brief behind Jude Bellingham.

Mainoo combined well with Rice tonight and there seemed to be decent communication between the two. The teenager, who looks comfortable taking the ball in tight situations on the turn and playing forward, certainly played the more advanced of the pair, but when Rice did venture forward he was quick to drop in and cover.

He even encouraged Rice, by far the more experienced player, to throw off his defensive shackles at one stage in the first half. This is a kid full of confidence.

Against top-class opposition, England’s recently-flung-together back four cannot be left exposed, so much will hinge upon how the deep-lying midfield duo cover for full-backs Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier, when those two inevitably fly forward.

Discipline will be key.

Is that defence solid enough?

England’s defence was under question before this game even kicked off.

Southgate’s decision to drop Harry Maguire for physical reasons and Jarrad Branthwaite for form (and timing, so early into his career) as he cut his squad to 26 meant ripping up the established partnership with John Stones that had served in three major tournaments. In Marc Guehi and Lewis Dunk, Southgate has picked two right-footed left-sided centre-backs and there’s no natural left-back to play outside them until Luke Shaw proves he is fit.

There were worries over balance and experience.

Truth be told, Guehi was solid against Iceland. He and Stones had only started together once before — in that forgettable 4-0 Nations League defeat to Hungary at Molineux in June 2022. Ezri Konsa replaced an injured Stones at half-time, but England’s defensive issues lay further forward.

Their pressing lacked intensity and, in the first half especially, it was disjointed, offering Iceland’s back line time and space to pick passes through midfield and exposing the defence. Twice in the second half, they got in behind and England had to scramble.

The country who only conceded twice, and not at all from open play, in their seven games while finishing as runners-up at the previous Euros three years ago need to find defensive solutions — fast.

Do England look like favourites to win Euro 2024?

This display did nothing to justify England’s status as one of the favourites to win the European Championship this summer. The likes of Spain, France and Germany will hardly be quaking in their boots having watched their preparations from afar.

Sure, they will look at the attacking talent at Southgate’s disposal and realise England will be a big threat in that department. A front four of Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka, with Cole Palmer, Anthony Gordon and the wildcard that is Eberechi Eze to come on when defences are tiring, looks as strong a group going forward as any. But various combinations of those lavish talents only fired in fits and starts across the two warm-up games against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iceland.

And there are certainly question marks elsewhere in the team.

Stones was hurt here when Thorsteinsson fell on his right ankle early on and was visibly discomforted in the moments that followed.

He did not come out for the second half. Southgate said post-match that the defender was “probably okay” with his withdrawal precautionary. He can hardly contemplate life without three of his preferred back four through injury (with Luke Shaw unlikely to play until the middle group game against Denmark on June 20 at the earliest), leaving a makeshift rearguard with inexperience at its heart and imbalanced with right footers.

Attack may be their best form of defence, but if they are too gung-ho, their soft underbelly could be exposed, as it was here by Iceland. As exciting as England may be going forward — on paper at least — there could be some nervy moments at the back, too.

To be tournament winners, you need a solid foundation, as history has repeatedly shown. Ask the Italians.

Rob Tanner

What did Gareth Southgate say?

“We learned a lot. We know the performance wasn’t good enough. Equally, so many of the players needed the game. A lot of players… we’re managing their minutes. They’ve had a break since the end of the Premier League and we’re trying to refresh them, but they’re out of the rhythm of playing. And so it was obviously a disjointed and disappointing performance and we didn’t show enough character.

“But, actually, I think it’s a really good focus for us ahead of the tournament. People are saying we’re going to go there and walk through with no problems. The reality of international football isn’t that. We’ve got to be far better without the ball than we were today, and we’ve got to show more composure with the ball.

“We didn’t get our pressing right. We were too stretched without the ball and there were questions asked that we weren’t able to answer. No matter how much talent you have with the ball, if your out-of-possession game isn’t right, it can make it feel like you don’t have a foothold in the game.

“But we’ll be ready. Tonight hasn’t gone as well as we hoped, but we have to stay very calm.”

What next for England?

Sunday, June 16: Serbia, Euro 2024 Group C, 8pm UK, 3pm ET
