England fans have been left stunned by Gareth Southgate's decision to omit Jack Grealish from his 26-man squad for Euro 2024.

The Three Lions boss, 53, named a provisional squad consisting of 33 players last month ahead of tune-up matches against Bosnia & Herzegovina and Iceland knowing that he would have to cull seven players before England jet off to Germany.

And it now seems as though Grealish, James Maddison, Curtis Jones, James Trafford, Jarell Quansah, Jarrad Branthwaite and Harry Maguire are the unlucky few who will miss out.

But while in some instances, like Maguire, injuries have forced Southgate's hand, not all of his decisions have been well received on social media.

Despite enduring a difficult season with Manchester City, Grealish has established himself in the England squad over the past couple of years. He, along with Maguire, are arguably the biggest omissions from the squad which will compete in Germany.

Several in-form players, such as Eberechi Eze, Jarrod Bowen and Anthony Gordon, have made the cut ahead of Grealish - and some fans have expressed their disbelief online.

One fan posted: "Leaving out Grealish is a big mistake, and I’m sure Southgate will end up regretting that decision", while another wrote: "Not taking Grealish to Germany, what an absolute joke. Shame on you Gareth."

Join the debate! Who do you think Southgate should cut from England's Euro 2024 squad? Let us know here.

England fans have also slammed Gareth Southgate for axing Jarrad Branthwaite ( Image: The FA via Getty Images)

The decision attracted comments all across social media with another person quipping: "Grealish left out the squad Madness. Must be because he came on the pitch on Monday and changed the game for us and we looked better."

Other fans have taken umbrage at the fact that Branthwaite, a summer transfer target for Manchester United, looks set to be miss out on a place in the squad - particularly given that Maguire will play no part in the tournament.

One fan fumed: "If this is right and he’s dropped Branthwaite over Dunk and Gomez then god save us", while another said: "Not taking Branthwaite following the Maguire cut is shocking."

Intriguingly, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher also joined those bemoaning Southgate's decision to leave the Everton defender at home. He said: "Lots of bigger names than Jarrad Branthwaite have missed out on the England squad, but he should’ve been picked to go to Euro 2024. He’s England’s present & future."
