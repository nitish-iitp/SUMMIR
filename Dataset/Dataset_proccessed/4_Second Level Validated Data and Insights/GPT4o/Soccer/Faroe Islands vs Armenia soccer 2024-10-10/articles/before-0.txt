In their third game in the group stage of UEFA Nations League C, Faroe Islands are set to host Armenia at Torsvollur on Thursday.

The home side are last in their four-team group with one point from two games, while the visitors are second with three points and lost 2-0 against North Macedonia in their most recent match in the competition on September 10.

Faroe Islands lost 1-0 last time out in the Nations League against Latvia in what was an evenly contested match, with Latvia producing two big chances and Faroe Islands creating three of their own.

In their first game of the 2024-25 tournament, the hosts drew 1-1 with North Macedonia on September 7, their third stalemate in their last five Nations League matches.

Faroe Islands finished third in their four-team group in the 2022-23 iteration of the competition with eight points from six games in League C, and they finished five points behind group winners Turkey, who were promoted to League B.

Manager Hakan Ericson's side are in poor form and have lost 12, drawn two and won just one of their 15 most recent fixtures, failing to score on 11 occasions in that period.

Ericson will also be concerned about his team's home record given they have lost four and drawn one of their last five home games, though they did win three and lose three of the previous six matches at Torsvollur.

As for the visitors, they come into the clash having lost 2-0 against North Macedonia, a match in which they had a player advantage for the entirety of the second half after Gjoko Zajkov was sent off in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time when the scoreline was 0-0.

Despite having a player advantage for the second 45 minutes, Armenia were unable to create any big chances in the game and conceded twice from North Macedonia's three second-half shots.

In the 2022-23 edition of the Nations League, Thursday's away team were relegated from League B to League C after finishing last in their four-team group with just three points from six matches.

Boss Oleksandr Petrakov was appointed in January 2023 and won two of his first four games in charge but drew two and lost seven of his next nine games.

Petrakov's side have won two of their three most recent matches, including a 4-1 win against Latvia in their first Nations League game of 2024-25 on September 7.

Armenia have lost their last six away fixtures and have in fact lost 14, drawn five and won just one of their 20 most recent games on the road.

The hosts could name Bardur A Reynatrod in goal behind a back four consisting of Joannes Kalso Danielsen, Samuel Johansen Chukwudi, Andrias Edmundsson and Viljormur Davidsen.

Gunnar Vatnhamar may start at the base of midfield, with Solvi Vatnhamar and Hanus Sorensen also likely to feature in the middle of the pitch.

Joan Edmundsson started as a striker against Latvia and could be joined in the forward line on Thursday by Rene Shaki Joensen and Meinhard Olsen.

Meanwhile, the visitors are likely to field goalkeeper Ognjen Cancarevic behind centre-backs Andre Calisir, Varazdat Haroyan and Georgii Arutiunian.

Armenia could start Ugochukwu Iwu and Eduard Spertsyan in a midfield double pivot, while Kamo Hovhannisyan and Nair Tiknizyan may start as wing-backs.

Lucas Zelarayan could be chosen to lead the forward line alongside attackers Grant-Leon Ranos and Edgar Sevikyan.


Faroe Islands possible starting lineup:
Reynatrod; Danielsen, Chukwudi, A Edmundsson, Davidsen; Sorensen, G Vatnhamar, S Vatnhamar; Joensen, J Edmundsson, Olsen

Armenia possible starting lineup:
Cancarevic; Calisir, Haroyan, Arutiunian; Hovhannisyan, Iwu, Spertsyan, Tiknizyan; Sevikyan, Ranos; Zelarayan



We say: Faroe Islands 0-2 Armenia

Considering Armenia have won two of their last three games in all competitions, it would not be surprising if they came into Thursday's clash confident of rectifying their defeat last time out.

Additionally, Faroe Islands' offensive record in recent matches has been poor, and it is difficult to see how they would get back into the game were they to concede first.
