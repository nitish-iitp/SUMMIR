We said: Faroe Islands 0-2 Armenia
Considering Armenia have won two of their last three games in all competitions, it would not be surprising if they came into Thursday's clash confident of rectifying their defeat last time out. Additionally, Faroe Islands' offensive record in recent matches has been poor, and it is difficult to see how they would get back into the game were they to concede first. Read more.
Data Analysis

Our analysis of all available data, including recent performances and player stats up until an hour before kickoff, suggested the most likely outcome of this match was a Armenia win with a probability of 53.25%.
