Venezuela meet Bolivia in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers

Bolivia will entertain Venezuela at Estadio Municipal de El Alto in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Thursday. The hosts have just one win in their six qualifying games thus far while La Vinotinto have won twice but are in fourth place in the standings after suffering just one loss.

La Verde have endured a poor run of form recently, suffering six consecutive losses. They lost all three group-stage games in the Copa America 2024 in June, scoring just once while conceding 10 goals. They met Uruguay in their previous World Cup qualifying match last year and suffered a 3-0 away loss.

The visitors enjoyed a good run in the Copa America and won all three group-stage games. They were eliminated from the quarterfinals by debutants Canada, who won the penalty shootout 4-3 after the score ended 1-1 after regulation time.

Bolivia vs Venezuela Prediction

La Verde have suffered six consecutive losses, scoring just two goals in these games. They have a good home record in this fixture, suffering just one loss while recording three wins, and will look to build on that form.

Óscar Villegas will take charge of his first game as the team's manager and will look to begin his reign on a positive note. His side will play at the city of El Alto and the stadium is located at an altitude of over 4,150 meters, which should work in their favor.

La Vinotinto had a good outing in the Copa America and were unlucky to be eliminated on penalties. They have suffered just one loss in the qualifying campaign thus far, conceding just three goals, and will look to build on that form.

Yangel Herrera was ruled out of the meetings against Bolivia and Uruguay due to a thigh injury and Jesús Bueno was added to the squad as his replacement.

Considering the current form of the two teams and the hosts' recent struggles, Venezuela are expected to eke out a narrow win.

Prediction: Bolivia 1-2 Venezuela
