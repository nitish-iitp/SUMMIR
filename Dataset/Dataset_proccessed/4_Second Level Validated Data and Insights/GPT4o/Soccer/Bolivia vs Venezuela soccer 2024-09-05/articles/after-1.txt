Bolivia thrash Venezuela in high-altitude World Cup qualifier
ByReuters
Updated: Sep 6, 2024, 12:00 am

Bolivia claimed their second win in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Thursday with a 4-0 home victory over Venezuela on their first match at one of the world's highest altitude stadiums.

Some 20,000 fans gathered at the Municipal de El Alto stadium at 4,150 metres above sea level and 550 metres above the Hernando Siles stadium in La Paz, where Bolivia usually host international games.

"La Verde" made the most of their home advantage to earn newly-appointed coach Oscar Villegas his first triumph at the helm in a match that broke the altitude record for an international fixture.

Ramiro Vaca opened the scoring for the hosts in the 13th minute with a long-range shot that sailed into the top corner before Carmelo Algarañaz doubled the lead from the spot before the break.

Miguel Terceros found the net early in the second half and Enzo Monteiro in the 89th to seal the win that moved Bolivia provisionally into international playoffs spot in seventh place with six points, just one behind Brazil.

Bolivia next play at Chile on Tuesday, while fourth-placed Venezuela host Uruguay.
