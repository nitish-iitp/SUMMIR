We said: Bolivia 1-2 Venezuela
Venezuela will be targeting maximum points against a nation that has lost five of their six qualifiers, but we think that they may have to settle for a draw after failing to win any of their previous 12 away matches in World Cup qualifying. Read more.
Data Analysis

Our analysis of all available data, including recent performances and player stats up until an hour before kickoff, suggested the most likely outcome of this match was a Venezuela win with a probability of 53.7%. A draw had a probability of 26.7% and a win for Bolivia had a probability of 19.65%.

The most likely scoreline for a Venezuela win was 0-1 with a probability of 15.72%. The next most likely scorelines for that outcome were 0-2 (11.5%) and 1-2 (8.83%).
