A clash between two unbeaten teams from Group A.

Guinea Bissau national football team are in Group A alongside Egypt and four others in the 2026 FIFA World Cup African qualifiers. They are in second place with five points. Post a 0-0 draw with Ethiopia, they now take on group leaders to try and reduce the gap up top.

Egypt are runaway leader of the group at the moment. They have managed to win all three qualifier games so far, totalling nine points on the table. The Pharaohs came out on top in a close-call encounter against Burkina Faso in the last game. The match ended 2-1 in favour of the former.

Players to Watch
Mama Balde (⁠Guinea Bissau)

Mama Balde is expected to lead the frontline of the host nation. The 28-year-old forward has 20 caps for the national team. In those outings, he could only manage two goals but the player makes up for the low numbers with other qualities on the pitch.

Mahmoud Trezeguet (Egypt)

Mahmoud Trezeguet is the man in the form of the Pharaohs. The 29-year-old winger scored a brace of goals last game against Burkina Faso which ultimately won them three points. With Mohamed Salah not providing goals for the national team recently, all eyes will be on Trezeguet.

Egypt have had a mixed result in that period, winning two, losing two and drawing once.
The away side currently holds a four-point lead over ⁠Guinea Bissau in Group A.
