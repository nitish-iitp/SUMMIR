Guinea-Bissau and Egypt are undefeated in World Cup qualifying heading into Monday's fourth encounter in Group A at Estadio Nacional 24 de Setembro.

However, the hosts have played out two draws, seeing them already adrift of the unblemished North African side.

Guinea-Bissau's start to World Cup qualifying has them second in Group A after three matches, statistically making them one of the best sides in that position heading into the fourth round of games.

Djurtus moved into that position after a goalless encounter with Ethiopia on June 6 saw them leapfrog Burkina Faso, who suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Egypt in Cairo.

Regardless, Luis Boa Morte's men would not make the playoffs as one of the highest-ranked second-placed nations were qualifying to end today, owing to Namibia (seven points), Comoros, Gabon and Guinea (all on six) accruing more points after three matches.

That is expected to change over the next round, and Guinea-Bissau could even make a play for first spot by defeating the Pharaohs on Monday.

They undoubtedly have what it takes to prevent their illustrious opponents from scoring, having kept consecutive clean sheets against Djibouti and Ethiopia — and four shutouts in their last five World Cup qualifiers. However, finding the net consistently remains the West African nation's bugbear.

Hossam Hassan's Egypt claimed maximum points in a potential banana skin to defeat Burkina Faso 2-1 last time out, sealing success for the African giants in pole position to advance automatically from Group A.

Despite their excellence on the continent, the seven-time African champions participating in just three World Cup finals is a shame for anyone wanting to experience the Pharaohs on the world stage, and they aim to make it to a fourth.

With four points separating Hassan's men from Monday's opponents and five between the table-topping side and Burkina Faso, the North Africans seek to increase their lead on the chasing pack further as qualifying nears its halfway point.

There is reason for optimism for Egypt to extend that lead, with the giants keeping consecutive clean sheets and being circa 30 minutes from a third before Lassina Traore halved the deficit in Cairo.

Egypt's only loss in their last 14 World Cup qualifying matches came in their double-header with Senegal in the lead-up to the 2022 finals. That defeat ended the Pharaohs' five-year undefeated streak, and they aim to extend the ongoing one to four on Monday.

Houboulang Mendes, sent off after two yellows against Djibouti in November 2023, should return to the squad on Monday.

Boa Morte will demand more from Mama Balde up top, with the forward potentially pivotal to Djurtus' chances of stunning the Pharaohs.

Trezeguet's brace saw Egypt claim maximum points last time out, and the former Aston Villa man taking responsibility in qualifying has been evident as the wide attacker has netted their last four goals in qualifying — a brace in the 2-0 win over Sierra Leone in November and another pair against Burkina Faso.

Despite Mohamed Salah's return to the fold, the Liverpool forward has not netted for the Pharaohs since their Africa Cup of Nations opening match against Mozambique in January, firing blanks in three straight competitive games.


Guinea-Bissau possible starting lineup:
Manuel Balde; Cande, Encada, Sangante, Djalo; Cassama, Bikel, Semedo; Dju, Mama Balde, E Balde

Egypt possible starting lineup:
El Shenawy; Rabia, Fathi, Abdelmonem; Hany, Attia, Zizo, Ashour, Trezeguet; Mohamed, Salah



We say: Guinea-Bissau 0-1 Egypt

Despite Guinea-Bissau keeping two clean sheets in qualifying after three games, Monday's encounter could end Djurtus' undefeated run with Egypt's superior quality giving them the edge in Bissau.

Success for Egypt increases their advantage in Group A, thus motivating Hassan's men to outdo their opponents in the fourth round of fixtures.
