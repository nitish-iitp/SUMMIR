Returning to action on Friday night, France will tackle old rivals Italy in the first match of their new UEFA Nations League campaign, as the teams meet in Paris.

While Les Bleus have been hit by several injuries, their well of talent is particularly deep, so long-serving coach Didier Deschamps has been able to call up some talented players as cover.

Fresh from his big move to Bayern Munich, former Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise receives his first senior call-up, having helped France claim a silver medal at the Olympics.

After recently completing a switch to the Italian capital, Roma's Manu Kone could also make his debut against the Azzurri - particularly as Deschamps dropped midfielder Adrien Rabiot, who is still a free agent after leaving Juventus.

Inter Milan's Benjamin Pavard has also been left out, while left-back Ferland Mendy (leg) and Wesley Fofana (fitness) have both withdrawn, reducing the hosts' defensive options for Friday and next week's game against Belgium.

Sevilla centre-back Loic Bade and Lazio's Matteo Guendouzi were both drafted in, but neither is expected to start at Parc des Princes, where captain Kylian Mbappe returns to win an 85th international cap - the Real Madrid striker needs just two more goals to reach his half-century.

It remains to be seen who joins the former Paris Saint-Germain star up front, but Inter's Marcus Thuram has made a flying start to the new Serie A season and may be favoured over PSG's Randal Kolo Muani, with vice-captain Antoine Griezmann also bound for the bench.

France possible starting lineup: Maignan; Kounde, Saliba, Konate, T. Hernandez; Kante, Tchouameni, Zaire-Emery; Dembele, Thuram, Mbappe
