Did you know? Sortiraparis is a pioneering cultural guide on the Internet: we remain fiercely attached to the now rare concept of freedom of the press.
That's why Sortiraparis has made a choice at the heart of its editorial team: our journalists write only for you, our readers. Millions of you read us, and we believe you deserve independent information every time you rely on us to spend a good time with your loved ones. That's why our mission since 2002 has been to help our readers build lasting memories with their loved ones.
Companies can write professional content themselves on Sortiraparis, in which case it is always marked "sponsored" in the top left-hand corner, so that you can always identify the source. Our journalists, on the other hand, write exclusively for our readers. This independence also depends on you. Are you tired of being misled by misleading content? You can do something about it! From now on, support information spaces that are free from influence, and that defend you.
A FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR COOKIES
Cookies aren't just cakes (although we often talk about them on Sortiraparis!). Sortiraparis creates free content through advertising. That's why we and our partners store and/or access information stored on a terminal, such as Internet cookies, and process personal data, such as unique identifiers and standard information, sent by each terminal to deliver personalized ads and content, measure ad and content performance, obtain audience data, and develop and improve products. With your permission, we and our partners may use geolocation and identification data through terminal analysis. By accepting, you consent to the processing described above, and we thank you very much for your support.

Home  Leisure  Sport and Wellness  Nations League: book your tickets to see France - Italy at the Parc des Princes
NATIONS LEAGUE: BOOK YOUR TICKETS TO SEE FRANCE - ITALY AT THE PARC DES PRINCES
Published by Graziella de Sortiraparis · Photos by Graziella de Sortiraparis · Published on September 1, 2024 at 05:18 p.m.
For France's match against Italy in the Nations League, Les Bleus will be playing at the heart of the Parc des Princes on September 6, 2024. Tickets are still available for this first match of the season!

Since the French soccer team's victory in the Nations League in 2021, the competition has not been a success for us. Can we reverse the trend this year? Les Bleus' first opponents in the group phase are Italy, Belgium and Israel, with two matches starting in September. And on September 6, 2024, it's the Parc des Princes, not the Stade de France, that hosts the home match against Italy, at 8:45pm.

[midroll]

And tickets are still available starting at 79 euros for this first match! The French will need to make a fine start to the competition to build up their confidence, after a lacklustre Euro, which saw them beaten in the semi-finals. As for the Nations League, it's been a few years since Les Bleus have distinguished themselves by failing to progress beyond the Round of 16, but here's a new challenge for them!

And what could be better than a match against Euro 2020 winners Italy? The French team will need your support to get back on track in the Nations League! So head over to the Fédération Française de Football website to get your tickets for the stadium where Paris-Saint-Germain usually play, as the stadium is always taken by athletics at the Paralympic Games. Allez les Bleus!
