France vs Italy Prediction & Betting tips

Friday evening from 19:45, the Parc des Princes stadium will host the match between France and Italy in the UEFA Nations League – Group A. The two national teams are facing each other for the first time in this competition and the last official match was at Euro 2008, when Italy won 2-0 against France and qualified further in 2nd place while France finished the group in the last position. The most recent confrontation took place in a friendly in 2018, which France won 3-1 at home in Nice. Both teams participated this year in Euro 2024 where they managed to get out of the groups.

France:

As we said above, France participated in Euro 2024 this summer but stopped in the semifinals, being eliminated by the winner of the competition, Spain, score 2-1. France was considered the main favorite to win the trophy, but although it did not play badly in the match against Spain in the semifinals and opened the scoring in the 9th minute, it was turned back in the first half. France’s squad did not undergo major changes compared to the 2024 European Championship and coach Didier Dechamps remained in office to qualify the team for the 2026 World Cup. In 2021-2021, France won the UEFA Nations trophy after defeating Spain in the final with 2-1.

Italy:

Italy also participated in Euro 2024 but had an evolution below expectations even though it was the European champion en-titre. Italy won only the first match in the group and the same was quite difficult, 2-1 against Albania. The weakest match played by Italy was in the confrontation with Spain, where they were led from one end to the other and luckily lost only 1-0. In the third match, Italy recorded a draw, score 1-1 with Italy, which qualified them for the round of 16, where they played another weak match, being eliminated by Switzerland. Luciano Spalletti was reconfirmed as coach and hopes to qualify the national team for the 2026 World Cup.
