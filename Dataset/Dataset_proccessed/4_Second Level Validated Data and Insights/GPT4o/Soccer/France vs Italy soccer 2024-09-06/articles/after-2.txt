Barcola opens scoring for France vs Italy
Scores fastest goal in France's history
France lose 3-1 to Italy despite quick start
WHAT HAPPENED?

It was a disastrous start for Luciano Spalletti's Italy in the Nations League group-stage opener against France as Barcola was able to capitalize on Giovanni di Lorenzo's mistake to give Didier Deschamps' men the lead after just 12 seconds.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Les Bleus have announced that Barcola's early striker was the fastest-ever goal scored by France in the last 90 years. However, OptaJean has revealed that the same cannot be verified as France had scored three goals in the first minute before 1993 and with accurate data not available for those matches, Barcola will be unofficially handed the title.

DID YOU KNOW?

Barcola's composed strike was also his first goal for the French national team as he made his sixth appearance for the Deschamps' side. The winger had a very impressive season with Paris Saint-Germain last season and was also taken to the Euros in Germany.

WHAT NEXT FOR FRANCE?

Despite the impressive start to the clash against Italy, France were blown out of the water by Gli Azzurri as they went on to lose the clash 3-1 with goals from Federico Dimarco, Davide Frattesi and Giacomo Raspadori.
