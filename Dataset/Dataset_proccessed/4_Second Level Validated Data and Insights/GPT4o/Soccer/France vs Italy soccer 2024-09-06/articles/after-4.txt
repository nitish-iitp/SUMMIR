UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
FRANCE 1-3 ITALY: KYLIAN MBAPPE FAILS TO FIRE AS DIDIER DESCHAMPS' SIDE MAKE LOSING START TO NATIONS LEAGUE CAMPAIGN
BYBEN SOUTHBY

UPDATED 06/09/2024 AT 21:16 GMT

Italy might have made a poor start in their UEFA Nations League encounter with France - conceding after just 13 seconds to Bradley Barcola - but they rebounded in superb fashion, hitting back with three strikes from Federico Dimarco, Davide Frattesi and Giacomo Raspadori respectively to stun Didier Deschamps' hosts. Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe failed to fire for Les Bleus.

Italy came from behind to beat France 3-1 at the Parc des Princes in Paris to get their UEFA Nations League campaign off to a flyer.
France had a dream start when Paris Saint-Germain winger Bradley Barcola stole the ball from the feet of Giovanni Di Lorenzo before darting into the box and striking his side ahead after just 13 seconds for his first international goal.

Italy came agonisingly close to an equaliser just five minutes later when Davide Frattesi was presented with a chance from close range, but his header hit the crossbar.

The visitors pulled level on the half-hour mark though when Federico Dimarco and Sandro Tonali combined beautifully. In a one-touch move, Dimarco found the Newcastle midfielder, who flicked the ball back for Dimarco to pull the trigger with a fierce volley which nestled into the far top corner.
Five minutes into the second half, Frattesi made up for his earlier miss to put the Italians ahead when he met Mateo Retegui’s low cross to steer the ball past a helpless Mike Maignan and into the net.
Giacomo Raspadori made sure of the three points for the visitors when he received the ball in the box after some brilliance from Destiny Udogie on the left, before busting past William Saliba to slot home Italy’s third.
TALKING POINT - TOUGH START FOR FRANCE
After their disappointing exit to Spain in the semi-finals at Euro 2024 a couple of months ago, France were unable to bounce back in front of their own fans in their Nations League opener. Things started so well, but they quickly began to unravel when Italy found the equaliser and Deschamps' team did not really threaten much after that.
Despite having 12 shots compared to Italy’s 11, the home side could only muster up an ‘expected goals’ total (xG) of 0.86, while Italy were much more threatening offensively, and even outdone their own xG of 1.71.
It is back to the drawing board for Deschamps, as France face a tough test against Belgium next.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - MATEO RETEGUI (ITALY)
He did not get his goal, but Retegui made himself a handful for the France defence. The experienced partnership of Saliba and Ibrahim Konate struggled to contain him for large parts of the game as he provided a constant threat both from the flanks and down the middle.
Despite blanking, he did find an assist to set up Frattesi’s second goal with a pinpoint cross which he flashed across the penalty box for his team-mate to guide home.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
1’ - GOAL!!! - FRANCE 1-0 ITALY (BARCOLA): France have the lead inside 13 seconds! Giovanni Di Lorenzo is waiting to recieve the ball at the back as it trickles to his feet, but a switched-on Barcola snatches the ball from him, drives into the box and finishes excellently to put the hosts ahead. What a start!
6’ - OFF THE BAR! Lorenzo Pellegrini dinks a ball to the back post which Andrea Cambiaso heads back across goal towards Davide Frattesi, who rattles the bar with a header. Italy come agonisingly close to an instant reply!
30’ - GOAL!!! - FRANCE 1-1 ITALY (DIMARCO): Dimarco fires Italy level on the volley! What a hit! Cambiaso sprays the ball across the pitch to Dimarco on the left, who plays one-touch football with Tonli, popping the ball to the midfielder who flicks the ball back to him over the top of the defence before Dimarco unleashes a fierce volley into the far top corner. Incredible!
51’ - GOAL!!! - FRANCE 1-2 ITALY (FRATTESI): Italy are ahead! In a silky move, Retegui darts down the right and fizzes a low pass across the penalty area for Frattesi to meet and slot home to put the visitors in front.
74’ - GOAL!!! - FRANCE 1-3 ITALY (RASPADORI): Italy extend their lead! Italy extend their lead! Udogie cuts in from the right and threads the ball to Raspadori in the box, who bursts past Saliba before slotting home for a two-goal cushion. Brilliant from Udogie and a long way back for France now!
KEY STAT
Barcola has scored five goals in his first four games at the start of the 2024/25 season.
