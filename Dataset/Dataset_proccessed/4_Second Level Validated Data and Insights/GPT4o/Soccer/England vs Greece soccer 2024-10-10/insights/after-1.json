        "Vangelis Pavlidis scored deep in second-half stoppage time to condemn England to a 2-1 UEFA Nations League defeat to Greece at Wembley.",
        "Pavlidis slammed home his second of the game after scrappy defending in the England penalty area in the 94th minute.",
        "England thought they had snatched a draw when Jude Bellingham lashed in an equaliser with three minutes of normal time remaining.",
        "Pavlidis dribbled his way through four defenders before bending a neat finish beyond Pickford for Greece\u2019s first goal at Wembley.",
        "Bellingham\u2019s powerful long-range finish appeared to have dragged England out of the mud, yet Greece had other ideas, and after some terrible defending from stand-in captain John Stones and his Manchester City team-mate Rico Lewis, Pavlidis drilled in a deserved winner for the visitors."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "England set up with what appeared to be an ultra-attacking XI against Greece on Thursday night at Wembley.",
        "Carsley went with an experimental starting XI in the absence of Harry Kane, choosing to start Anthony Gordon, Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer, Phil Foden and Bellingham, but not playing a recognised forward despite having Ollie Watkins and Dominic Solanke in reserve."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Lee Carsley\u2019s team \u2013 who were second best throughout \u2013 got what they deserved for slack play at the back.",
        "Carsley tried to give the England fans what they wanted, but by crowbarring in Gordon, Saka, Foden, Palmer and Bellingham, it was a case of too many chefs spoiling the broth.",
        "England had no focal point, and the lopsided nature of their team meant Declan Rice \u2013 who was poor \u2013 was unable to shield an exposed defence, behind which Pickford was shaky.",
        "Kane will be back soon enough, but Carsley did not react quickly enough in game, and it will perhaps give the FA\u2019s decision makers cause for concern."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "It was an emotional, historic night for Greece, and one that will live long in the memory.",
        "Pavlidis dedicated his first goal to his former national team-mate George Baldock, who passed away in Athens on Wednesday."
