England star 'trains individually' before Greece clash after injury scare

England have been dealt an injury blow ahead of Thursday night's UEFA Nations League clash with Greece at Wembley.

The Three Lions are at the start of the new era on the international stage following the departure of long-serving manager Gareth Southgate after the conclusion of Euro 2024.

Although he will go down as one of the country's greatest-ever custodians in the managerial hotseat, the former Middlesbrough boss was unable to guide England to a major honour.

Taking charge of the squad on an interim basis, Lee Carsley has enjoyed a perfect start to life as Three Lions coach in terms of results.

England recorded a comfortable 2-0 victory over Republic of Ireland to commence their Nations League campaign on September 7, before beating Finland by the same scoreline three days later.

Kane trains away from England teammates

Bagging a brace in the victory over Teemu Pukki and company last month, Harry Kane is a doubt to feature in Thursday's clash with table-topping Greece.

The 31-year-old picked up a thigh issue during Bayern Munich's 3-3 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday afternoon, forcing him off after 72 minutes.

Kane was cleared by England's medical staff to form part of the October plans on Monday, however it appears that the striker is far from 100% fitness.

The Three Lions' all-time leading goalscorer carried out his own individualised training programme away from the rest of his teammates on Tuesday.

Therefore, the Bayern marksman is in a race against time to be available to feature for England against first-placed Greece in London on Thursday.

Carsley's alternatives to Kane

If fully fit, Kane is a guaranteed starter for England, regardless of often-disrespectful criticism that the forward received during Euro 2024.

However, with the 31-year-old training away from his teammates, Carsley might need to come up with an alternative solution up front on Thursday.

Returning to the Three Lions fold, Tottenham Hotspur striker Dominic Solanke could lead the line, while there is also a case for Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa to start.
