How to watch England vs Greece? 

England vs Greece is scheduled for a 7:45pm BST kick-off on Thursday, October 10, 2024.

The match will be played at Wembley Stadium in London, England.

Football fans in the United Kingdom can watch the match live on ITV and STV. Subscribers will also be able to watch via the ITV X app and website, as well as the STV Player..

England v Greece betting preview  

England won their opening two UEFA Nations League B2 games under new interim manager Lee Carsley, convincingly defeating Ireland and Finland. The Three Lions won both games 2-0 with Declan Rice and Jack Grealish both scoring against the Republic, while Harry Kane scored both goals against Finland on the night he won his 100th cap. Carsley is aiming to become the first England manager ever to win his first three games without conceding a goal.

Greece also started a new managerial era with the appointment of Ivan Jovanovic. They took six points from Finland and Ireland in the first round of games, beating them 3-0 and 2-0 respectively. Under previous manager they played two international friendlies in June, as they didn't take part in the European Championship. The Greek team was narrowly beaten by tournament hosts Germany (2-1) and recorded a 2-0 victory in Malta.

Best Odds

England are huge favourites to take maximum points, as they are priced at around 3/10 (1.30). The draw is 9/2 (5.50) while a shocking victory for the visitors can be backed at 12/1 (13.00).

Probable Line-ups

England (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Alexander-Arnold, Guehi, Stones, Lewis; Rice, Bellingham; Saka, Palmer, Gordon; Kane.

Harry Kane has been declared fit despite limping off during Bayern Munich’s 3-3 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday while Morgan Gibbs-White, Ezri Konsa and Kobbie Mainoo all withdrew through injury. The former Tottenham striker will be supported by Bukayo Saka, Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer with the latter expected to oust Jack Grealish. The likes of Phil Foden and Noni Madueke provide further offensive options, as well as Dominic Solanke who has earned his first call-up in seven years. Rico Lewis will start as left-back, completing the backline alongside John Stones, Marc Guehi and Trent Alexander Arnold. Tino Livramento and Curtis Jones have been to the squad.

Greece (4-2-3-1): Vlachodimos; Rota, Mavropanos, Koulierakis, Tsimikas; Siopis, Kourbelis; Masouras, Bakasetas, Tzolis; Pavlidis

Greece boss Ivan Jovanovic, who took over in August, could select Premier League trio Kostas Tsimikas (Liverpool), Konstantinos Mavropanos (West Ham) and goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos (Newcastle). Highly-rated forward Fotis Ioannidis, who has scored three times in the Nations League, will miss this game with an adductor injury, with Vangelis Pavlidis - who scored a phenomenal 80 goals in three seasons with AZ Alkmaar before joining Portuguese giants Benfica this summer - set to come in.

Head To Head

In terms of head-to-head battles, As to direct encounters, England have never lost to their opponents in nine previous meetings, seven of which they won. Anyway, this will be the first match between the two countries in 18 years.




Our England v Greece Betting Tips 

England have won 16 of their last 21 competitive home matches across all competitions, drawing three and losing the remaining two. Thre Three Lions have also kept six clean sheets in their last nine games.

Greece have failed to score in seven of their previous nine meetings with England and their best striker - Fotis Ioannidis - is out through injury.

As a result, we can envisage England to win to NIL here. Another 2-0 victory is our pick in the Correct Score market.

As to possible goalscorer, we recommend a bet on Cole Palmer.
