The lay of the land

The Socceroos have jumped up to third spot in Group C behind Japan and Saudi Arabia, who play each other in Jeddah at 5am tomorrow AEDT. Regardless of that result, Australia will head to Japan wanting and needing a result of some kind to further improve their circumstances.

More immediately, a piece from tonight’s match is on the way from Vince after the post-match press conferences so keep an eye out for that. And stay tuned in the coming days for build-up to that big match in Saitama on Tuesday night.

Thank you and goodnight.

Feels like new beginnings for Gauci

“I think so,” says the Aston Villa keeper who replaced Mat Ryan in goal tonight. “Obviously as a South Australian, I’m happy to have a record crowd here. It was a fantastic turnout. South Australia always gets behind its sporting events and it was great to see it get behind football and the Socceroos like it did the Matildas.

“It does feel like a new beginning. This is a positive step in the right direction. It wasn’t perfect by any means. We have a lot to work on and we go away to Japan for a tough game, but we are looking forward to the challenge and ultimately if we want to be in world football, we have to be coming up against the best teams and facing them head-on and ready to compete.”

Goodwin is player of the match

And he’s with the Network 10 commentary team admiring his goal, and the one he scored against Lebanon a few months back, and confirming neither compare in his mind to the one he scored against France in Australia’s opening 2022 World Cup match.

“We did really well even in the first half,” he says. “China were very, very compact. We maybe forced it a little bit … we talked about that at half-time and we showed big character to respond in the way we did.”

And on life under Popovic, who has apparently removed all lollies from the change room as part of his characteristically stringent dietary requirements.

“It’s different messaging, different style of play,” Goodwin says. “New dietitian, and getting back to the elite standards that we have to hold … that we know we can hit.”

Full-time! Australia defeat China 3-1

That’s all she wrote at Adelaide Oval, and it’s a win to mark Popovic’s first match in charge.

And ... breathe

There it is. The Socceroos are home and hosed, the debutant Nishan Velupillay - the first Aussie of Sri Lankan descent to represent this team - bangs home the sealer in stoppage time. Strong vindication for Tony Popovic, whose selection of his former Melbourne Victory charge raised many an eyebrow across the game. There’s the riposte. And now Craig Goodwin is coming off to an absolute hero’s reception. What a night for him.

Velupillay scores!

On international debut, if you don’t mind. McGree provides the initial ball and Bos the cutback. From there it’s a little messy, and the way it falls for Velupillay is a little fortuitous. But the 23-year-old turns on the spot and throws his boot through it to give Australia a two-goal buffer.

Five minutes of added time

Velupillay overcooks a cross from right to left but only slightly. The idea is right. Bos tries to chase it down to no avail, but good signs.

Bos makes himself known

Bos drifts in behind at such a pace that he’s hurtled well over the byline before he can get away a cutback. Goodwin is waiting in the box and plants the ball into the back of the net but literally nobody displays any body language to indicate they actually believe that’s a goal.

But Bos is lively, and he comes again and links up with McGree for a half-chance. Australia are moving the ball quickly now inside China’s half and Miller has a crack at another goal to match his first for the evening.

Duke’s night is over

He seems okay, so it must be precautionary ahead of that Japan game next Tuesday. For now, it means an international debut for Melbourne Victory’s Nishan Velupillay.
