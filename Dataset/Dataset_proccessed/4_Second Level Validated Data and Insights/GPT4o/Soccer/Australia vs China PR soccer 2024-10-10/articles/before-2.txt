Stamatelopoulos: Whenever I go into a game of football, I feel like I'm going to score

Apostolos Stamatelopoulos is back in the Subway Socceroos squad and is determined to make an impact in our upcoming FIFA World Cup 2026™ Round Three qualifiers against China PR and Japan.

After picking up a hamstring injury at the start of the season, Stamatelopoulos netted his first goal for new club Motherwell at the weekend and the Australia forward is hoping to continue that goal-scoring form in front of a home crowd at Adelaide Oval this Thursday.

Here’s what the Adelaide local said to the media earlier today ahead of our all-important AFC Asian Qualifier against China PR.

On being back home in Adelaide representing the Socceroos

I’m incredibly proud to be here. It’s great to come back home and see family, friends and represent my country at home. Everyone's very focused, very switched on. We definitely want to get three points from this game against China. I’m looking forward to it.

On scoring his first Motherwell goal after returning from injury

It was definitely a big relief. Basically, I had my first start of the season, then got injured and was out for six weeks. Came off the bench two weeks ago, and then started the week after and scored. It was definitely a big relief. I'm loving it [at Motherwell], loving the club, where I'm living, just outside of Glasgow. It's great. My family's over there now as well, so it's been a bit of an adjustment, but it's great.

On adapting to life in Scotland

My missus had my son, and then I left three days after, and I was over there for exactly two months by myself, and my missus was back here in Adelaide. Then she came over and I left eight or nine days after to come here, so definitely not in the good books with my wife at the moment, but now we're happy that we're together finally!

It was pretty hard. And obviously, as a footballer, you have football to take your mind away from it, and then getting injured straight away. It was a tough two months for sure.

On his confidence in front of goal

Whenever I go into a game of football, I feel like I'm going to score regardless of where I am and where the game is. So, I feel like I can do that for sure.

On the team bouncing back after the games against Bahrain and Indonesia

Yeah, we're disappointed about not getting those first wins but the mood is high and I think we're going to go in and put in a good performance on Thursday night.

On playing at Adelaide Oval

It's a stadium that's going to hold a lot of people and create the best atmosphere for us to go out and perform. So, I’m happy about it.

On adapting to a new coach

I haven't had him [Tony Popovic] as a coach directly, but obviously played against him. So I know and have heard what he wants - very intense, very focused on working hard, so looking to do that in training, for sure.

On what to expect from China PR

I think obviously with them being away from home, they're going to sit very deep, try to keep a clean sheet, so for us, it's just about breaking them down and getting that first goal and letting the game open up and going from there.
