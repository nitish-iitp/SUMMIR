The Socceroos have come from behind to beat China 3-1 at Adelaide Oval, handing Tony Popovic a hard-earned victory in his first match as coach.

Xie Wenneng scored against the run of play in the first half, silencing the 46,291 supporters at Adelaide Oval, who must have feared the worst following a winless start to the third phase of World Cup qualifying. 

However, goals to Lewis Miller, a Craig Goodwin screamer and a debut goal to Nishan Velupillay gave the Socceroos a much-needed victory to kick start their campaign.

Following a shock defeat to Bahrain and a lacklustre draw against Indonesia, the Socceroos were at real risk of drifting out of contention for the top two qualification spots in this third phase of qualification from the AFC.

So, although not many who saw the match would say it was pretty, in truth the only thing that mattered for the Socceroos was getting the victory.

However a moment of real brilliance in the second half from Goodwin lifted Australia to victory.

The former Adelaide United man and the Reds' all time leading goalscorer picked up the ball 30 yards from goal after being played in by a neat pass from Jackson Irvine and unleashed a fearsome strike into the far corner of the goal.

The strike was utterly sublime, "just as I imagined it," according to Goodwin, and lifted the Socceroos into a second half display that was far more impressive than their first.

After making five changes from Graham Arnold's last side that laboured to a draw against Indonesia, the Socceroos were likely to be disjointed.

Yet they started well, dominating the opening 20 minutes with almost 80 per cent possession, only to be caught on the counter attack by Xie, whose brilliant finish stunned Adelaide Oval.

The Socceroos did not panic though and, in first-half stoppage time, found themselves level thanks to Miller's header.

"In previous games, we may have felt a bit flustered and felt the pressure to score the goal," goalkeeper Joe Gauci told Channel 10 after the match.

"Definitely in the two games before, we definitely had that feeling, but tonight we were more patient, trusted the opportunities would come and, when we got them, we would take them.

"Getting the goal right before half-time definitely swung momentum in our favour."

China, who have now lost four-straight internationals for the first time since 2003, battled bravely and robustly, but were powerless to deny Goodwin's screamer.

The visitors still threatened periodically, Adelaide Oval's nervousness threatening to bleed into the players psyche.

But when debutant Nishan Velupillay smartly finished in stoppage time, the pressure valve was finally released.

The Socceroos will face a far sterner test on Tuesday, when they take on group leaders Japan in Saitama (9:35pm AEST)

Tough test awaits

By Simon Smale

Thanks for a great blog of what ended up a good game Simon, the 2nd half was a lot more positive from the Aussies. Just need to keep it going against Japan....in Japan - shouldn't be a problem for the Popa crew...

- Mike

Japan take on Saudi Arabia in Jeddah tomorrow morning AEDT.

That will be a huge test for the Samurai Blue.

But such a trip means the Socceroos will possibly be fresher when they meet in Saitama on Tuesday night.

Maybe.

Either way, we'll be there to bring you all the action, and I can't wait.

See you then.

'Nice': Goodwin comments on his goal

By Simon Smale

Craig Goodwin is speaking to Channel 10.

He says the goal was "exactly how I imagined it" and that he was used to playing centrally at his age.

"This year in Saudi, it's a position I'm playing a lot more," he says, before interrupting his train of thought to comment on his strike.

"It is nice to be able to get the goal and to get the win," he says.

He adds that the only goal that was better than that was his World Cup goal.

"I think we did well. Especially the first goal. In the first half China were very compact," he says.

"Hats off to the boys. We were running them down. After the first two games, the results that we had, it could have gone into our shell but we found big character to respond in the way that we did.

"A big three points and now we need to move onto a big game away."

The alternative view

By Simon Smale

Geria, O'Neil, McCree, Duke are not of international quality. Get rid of them. We won't be beating Japan or qualifying

- Thiru

I think we can agree that it wasn't a vintage performance, Thiru.

But this game wasn't about performance. It was about the win.

Also, who is coming in instead?

McGree was good

By Simon Smale

To be fair on the third goal McGree did so excellent lead up work holding 2 defenders off with his back to the goal before turning the ball in to a strong attacking position

- Pete

I think he made a hell of a difference after he came on.

It wasn't quite happening for Nestory in the first half.

I'm not sure whether he come off as a result of that knock he got before half time, but it's hard to say that it didn't work out for the Socceroos.

The Socceroos get their victory!

It might not have been particularly pretty, but the Socceroos get the job done.

It took something very special from local hero Craig Goodwin to put the Socceroos into the lead after that shock goal from Xie Wenneng and Lewis Miller's equaliser.

And then Nishan Velupillay got the icing on top of the cake with a fine finish at the end of a bit of a scramble.

For China, that's their fourth successive defeat, the first time that's happened to the erstwhile Asian giants since 2003.

90+2' Goal Socceroos!

By Simon Smale

That seals it!

And it's a debut goal for Nishan Velupillay!

A lovely finish for the 23-year-old from Melbourne Victory after the ball fell fortuitously to him after a bit of a goalmouth scrap.

Huge relief around Adelaide Oval - the Socceroos wont lose this.

They lead 3-1.

Oh, he should have done better, really!

The Socceroos sweep forward from the left side to the right, Miller arrives on the edge of the penalty area with the goal at his mercy, and sends the ball high over the bar.

86' Goodwin put the ball in the net

By Simon Smale

But the ball was well out of play before Jordan Bos was able to get the cross away.

Inexplicably though, the assistant on that far side hadn't raised his flag until after Goodwin had forced a really good save from Wang Dalei.

Bizarre.

Nice run from Jordan Bos though.

81' Duke goes down

By Simon Smale

Oh no, this doesn't look good.

It was a nice cross from Jordan Bos into the penalty area, with Mitch Duke diving to attempt a header.

He doesn't get to it and as he falls, he clutches at his shoulder - the same one he injured in the first half.

He'll pick himself up and carry on but that does look sore.

78' Craig Goodwin lucky to avoid a yellow

By Simon Smale

It has been a physical game, so that might have saved him, but he's taken out Tyias Browning as the centreback tried to launch a break.

It would have been a costly one too - he'd have missed the match against Japan with a suspension if he is booked here.

Aziz Behich, underused in the first half you'd say, although it was him being fouled that led to the Socceroos equaliser, is the man who makes way.

72' Chance China!

By Simon Smale

Oh that was close!

A lovely bit of skill on the left side saw a cross whipped in from the byline, where Jason Geria got the faintest of touches at the near post to take the ball away from hitting Behram Abduweli flush on the forehead.

This game isn't done yet. China haven't shown much but there is just enough to give the Socceroos cause for concern.
