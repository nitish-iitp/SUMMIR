        "The Westfallonstadion in Dortmund is known for its electrifying atmosphere, and Saturday evening should be no different as Euro 2024 hosts Germany take on Denmark in the round of 16.",
        "Die Mannschaft flew under the radar a little ahead of the tournament, but Julian Nagelsmann's side have let their football do all the talking so far \u2013 going unbeaten as they finished top of Group A with seven points and qualified for the knockout stages with a game to spare.",
        "There is now a real belief that this side, led by rising stars like Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala, as well as Toni Kroos on his swan song, can go on and secure Germany a record fourth Euros triumph - but the focus now must be beating Denmark to reach the quarter-finals, where Spain may lie in wait.",
        "The Danes also boast an unbeaten record, but have scored just twice and are yet to win a game.",
        "They proved they're well-drilled and tough to break down as they finished second in Group C behind England, but will need to find another gear if they're to cause an upset.",
        "Twelve years on from Germany's 2-1 victory in the round of 16 and 32 since the Danes beat West Germany in the final, the current sides get a chance to write their own chapter in the pair's Euros history."
