        "The highly anticipated Euro 2024 last-16 tie between Germany and Denmark is set to take place at the iconic Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund on June 29, 2024, at 8pm UK time.",
        "Germany enters this knockout stage with a renewed sense of confidence, having banished the demons of their last two World Cup campaigns, which ended in premature group-stage exits.",
        "Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s men topped Group A, securing their place in the last 16 with dominant performances, including a 7-0 aggregate scoreline against Scotland and Hungary.",
        "Despite a slight scare against Switzerland, where they were on the brink of losing their top spot, Niclas Fullkrug\u2019s injury-time equalizer ensured Germany finished as group winners, avoiding a last-16 battle with reigning champions Italy.",
        "Denmark\u2019s journey to the knockout stages was less straightforward. The Scandinavian side finished second in Group C, a group notorious for its low-scoring matches.",
        "With only seven goals scored across six games, Denmark managed three draws against England, Slovenia, and Serbia, which was enough to secure their progression.",
        "This achievement marks the first time Denmark has reached the knockout stages in back-to-back Euros, highlighting their growing consistency on the European stage.",
        "Germany\u2019s resurgence under Julian Nagelsmann has been remarkable. The team remains unbeaten in 2024, winning five and drawing two of their seven matches.",
        "The attacking prowess of players like Kai Havertz, Jamal Musiala, and Ilkay Gundogan has been pivotal, while the defense, marshaled by veterans like Antonio Rudiger and Nico Schlotterbeck, has been resilient.",
        "Germany\u2019s tactical flexibility, often deploying a 4-2-3-1 formation, allows them to adapt to various in-game scenarios.",
        "The midfield duo of Toni Kroos and Robert Andrich provides stability and creativity, essential for controlling the game\u2019s tempo.",

        "Denmark, under the stewardship of Kasper Hjulmand, has built a reputation for being a tough team to break down.",
        "Despite their low goal tally in the group stages, their defensive solidity has been commendable.",
        "The Danes share an unbeaten run with Germany in 2024, further emphasizing their resilience.",
        "Key players like Christian Eriksen, who orchestrates the midfield, and Kasper Schmeichel, the reliable shot-stopper, will be crucial in their quest to neutralize Germany\u2019s attacking threats.",
        "Hjulmand\u2019s tactical approach often involves a 3-4-2-1 formation, providing defensive solidity while allowing wing-backs like Joakim Maehle and Jens Stryger Larsen to contribute offensively.",
        "However, the suspension of Morten Hjulmand, combined with Jonas Wind\u2019s recent struggles up front, means Hjulmand may need to shuffle his lineup to find the right balance.",
        "Historically, Germany holds an edge over Denmark in competitive fixtures. Their last competitive meeting at the 2012 European Championships saw Germany triumph 2-1.",
        "However, the recent friendly encounters have ended in 1-1 draws, indicating that Denmark can compete with the tournament hosts on their day.",

        "Germany\u2019s home advantage and superior attacking options make them the favorites in this encounter.",
        "While Denmark\u2019s defensive capabilities should not be underestimated, Germany\u2019s form and quality are likely to see them through to the quarter-finals.",
