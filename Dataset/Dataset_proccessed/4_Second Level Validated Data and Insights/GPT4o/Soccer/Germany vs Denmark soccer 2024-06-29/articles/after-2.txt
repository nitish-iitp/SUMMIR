Germany and Denmark's Euro 2024 last 16 match in Dortmund halted due to storm

Germany advanced to the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 after an enthralling and fascinating contest against Denmark in Dortmund.

The hosts started as the more aggressive side and thought they had the opener when Nico Schlotterbeck headed home in the fourth minute. That goal was ruled out for an infringement in the box and Denmark had a reprieve.

They strengthened in the first half and were in the ascendancy when a rare thunderstorm called proceedings to a halt due to dangerous lightning. The match resumed and the team went into the break all square.

Denmark then struck first in the second half as Jaochim Andersen finished of a fortunate set piece routine only for VAR to rule him offside. Mere minutes later, Andersen was penalised for handling the ball in his own box and gave away a penalty.

Kai Havertz slotted it past Kasper Schmeichel and the hosts never looked back. Jamal Musiala added a second with a superb curling strike and Germany secured the win to reach the next round.

Relive all the latest updates from Germany v Denmark below.

Jamal Musiala weathers mighty storm but Germany’s real Euro 2024 test is still ahead

On a night of stoppages, Germany almost stumble, but keep going. That was summed up and sealed by Jamal Musiala’s smooth run and finish after a performance that previously had so many rough edges.

That goal put a sheen on a match that had literally been so muddied, where Germany were somewhat fortunate to turn it all on two big decisions and a controversial Kai Havertz penalty.

Just moments after Joachim Andersen had a goal ruled out for a genuine toenail offside, the ball hit his stretched hand for the call that ultimately sent the hosts to a 2-0 win.

Ange Postecoglou defends Michael Oliver after dubious penalty call in Germany’s Euro 2024 win over Denmark

Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou came to referee Michael Oliver’s defence after a number of VAR decisions influenced Germany’s 2-0 victory over Denmark in the last-16 at Euro 2024.

The hosts had a goal chalked off in the first half for an infringement in the build-up before Denmark saw their only goal ruled out by the semi-automated offside technology.

To make matters worse, goalscorer Joachim Andersen was punished a couple of minutes later for handball with VAR sending Oliver to the pitchside monitor where he awarded Germany a penalty that swung the momentum of the match.

Denmark have failed to win any of their last eight games at major competitions (D4 L4), with their last such victory coming in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 against the Czech Republic (2-1).

Ange Postecoglou had the strongest reaction to the penalty and offside calls saying: “My question is that we can’t see ball contact at that disallowed goal for Andersen. How do we know that’s right?

“That’s my problem all along, Michael Oliver isn’t making that decision. It’s not on Michael Oliver. Technology is supposed to be definitive.

“If I hear one more person say that VAR isn’t re-refereeing a game, I will blow up. This is not on Michael Oliver, we are criticising the technology.

“When the offside is that tight, I don’t know why it is being looked at. If we accept that we accept other two-minute delays for other incidents.”

Naturally most of the post match analysis has been about Germany’s penalty.

Roy Keane said: “I’m always critical of defenders coming out defending with their hands behind their back, but I see it. I feel for defenders. That’s not the game we grew up loving, these types of decisions. People tomorrow wouldn’t be waking up tomorrow saying ‘why is that not a penalty?’”

While Ian Wright added: “That as a handball will never ever sit well for me, I’m not sure why they’re going so deep into the science of it. The offside law for me has gone crazy.”

“For a young man, great composure.”

Euro 2024 Golden Boot standings: Jamal Musiala, Cody Gakpo and others battle to be top scorer in Germany

Europe’s best strikers are vying for individual honours as well as team success as they aim to top the scoring charts at Euro 2024.

The quadrennial continental tournament is currently taking place in Germany with many of the world’s top marksmen on show and battling it out for the Golden Boot.

Cristiano Ronaldo became the leading scorer in competition history with five goals at Euro 2020 taking his overall aggregate to 14 and sealing the Golden Boot in the process, as his assist saw him edge the comparatively unheralded Patrik Schick of the Czech Republic, who also netted on five occasions during the tournament.

Manuel Neuer made his 38th appearance at a major competition, the joint-most for Germany alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger.

He should break that record in the quarter-final. This was also his 19th appearance at the Euros, taking him past Schweinsteiger’s 18.
