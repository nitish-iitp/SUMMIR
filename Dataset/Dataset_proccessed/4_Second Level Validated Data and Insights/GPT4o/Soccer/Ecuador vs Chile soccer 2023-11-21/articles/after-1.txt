We said: Ecuador 0-0 Chile
Ecuador have been steady if not spectacular so far and will expect to claim another result against a Chile side in disarray. The visitors will have to regroup quickly after the resignation of their manager just a few days ago, and an away trip to a side notoriously stingy in defence is not the ideal fixture. Read more.
