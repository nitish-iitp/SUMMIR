AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS
EGYPT 2-2 GHANA - BLACK STARS PEGGED BACK TWICE DESPITE MOHAMMED KUDUS DOUBLE BUT PHARAOHS SUFFER MOHAMED SALAH SCARE
BYPATRIC RIDGE

UPDATED 18/01/2024 AT 22:49 GMT

A Mohammed Kudus brace wasn't enough for Ghana to secure the win in their African Nations Cup clash with Egypt as goals from Omar Marmoush and Mostafa Mohamed meant the points were shared. Both sides remain winless in the competition after two games and there was more conceren for Egypt who saw Mohamed Salah limp off just before the break.

Egypt lost Mohamed Salah to injury but twice fought back to draw 2-2 with Ghana at the Africa Cup of Nations.
Thursday’s Group B game at Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny sparked into life on the stroke of half-time when, just 53 seconds after Egypt’s star man Salah had trudged off with an apparent hamstring issue, the seven-time AFCON champions fell behind to Mohamed Kudus’ stunning opener.

The drudgery of the first half made way for a frantic second period, however, with three goals in the space of five minutes and 10 seconds seeing the pendulum swing back and forth.

WHO HAS QUALIFIED FOR THE AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS QUARTER-FINALS?

Inaki Williams’ dreadful pass enabled the excellent Omar Marmoush to restore parity in the 69th minute, only for Kudus to double his tally 101 seconds later.
Yet Ghana were only able to hold onto their lead for another three minutes, with Mostafa Mohamed tucking home from Trezeguet’s cutback to haul Egypt level once more, though the Pharaohs got lucky when Iddrisu Baba headed wide of a gaping goal in stoppage time.
Salah’s injury came in innocuous fashion – Egypt’s captain dropping to the turf and ripping off his armband in the 45th minute, immediately signalling that he needed to go off and holding his left hamstring.
Egypt’s frustration was swiftly compounded as Kudus found a way through three defenders before arrowing in a wonderful left-footed finish from the edge of the box.
Yet a prolonged spell of Egypt pressure, in which the Pharaohs had a goal disallowed for offside, finally told when Williams inadvertently played in Marmoush, who coolly rounded Richard Ofori before slotting in.
That goal sparked a chaotic five-minute spell. First, Kudus’ low effort fooled Mohamed El Shenawy after taking a slight deflection, only for Egypt to capitalise on more shambolic Ghana defending as Trezeguet got to the line and supplied Mohamed with a simple finish.
Ofori’s save from Emam Ashour’s attempt paved the way for one final Ghana push, and Baba should have won it when he latched onto an inswinging corner, only to put his header wide, with the result leaving the Black Stars on a point and Egypt on two heading into their final Group A matches.
TALKING POINT – LIVERPOOL’S SALAH WORRY
If you were to bet on what Jurgen Klopp feared the most this month, then it would be pretty safe to put money on a Salah injury featuring high on that list.
Now, both Klopp and Rui Vitoria will be hoping and praying it is nothing too serious. Egypt need their talisman back for the last group game, and Liverpool surely cannot afford to lose their star player for a prolonged period if they are to hold off their title rivals in the Premier League.

PLAYER OF THE MATCH – MOHAMED KUDUS (GHANA)
With a special mention to Marmoush, Kudus gets the nod for his two goals. While his second one had a good stroke of fortune to it, his opener was a thing of beauty.
Kudus has been putting away some great goals for West Ham this season, and his 10th international strike was right up there with the best of them. It would be a great shame if he is not able to shine later on in the tournament, but the Black Stars might have to win their last group match, against Mozambique, to qualify.
PLAYER RATINGS
Egypt: El Shenawy 5, Kamal 6, Hegazy 6, Abdelmonem 6, Hamdy 6, Fathy 6, Elneny 6, Salah 5, Marmoush 8, Ashour 6, Mohamed 6. Subs: Fathi 6, Trezeguet 7, Attia 6.
Ghana: Ofori 7, Odoi 6, Djiku 5, Salisu 5, Mensah 7, Ashimeru 6, Kudus 9*, Abdul Samed 6, Semenyo 6, Williams 3, J.Ayew 6. Subs: Bukari 5, Baba 6, Owusu 6, Paintsil 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
46’ – Injury (Salah): Well, this has thrown a spanner in the works! Just as four minutes stoppage time was confirmed, Salah goes down clutching his left hamstring, and he immediately rips off the captain’s armband. It quickly becomes apparent that he can’t carry on, and he trudges off to the touchline. A huge blow for Egypt, and possibly Liverpool!
48’ – Goal! Egypt 0-1 Ghana (Kudus): It goes form bad to worse for Egypt, as just a minute after they lose Salah to that hamstring injury, they go behind to a quite wonderful attempt from Mohamed Kudus! Salah can only watch on glumly from the bench as Ghana’s star player comes alive 25 yards out, skipping between a group of defenders before arrowing a strike into the left-hand corner, giving El Shenawy no chance. It may have taken a slight deflection, but Kudus and Ghana will care not. It’s 1-0 to Ghana!
51’ – No goal! Egypt 0-1 Ghana (Abdelmonem): Egypt think they have restored parity, but the linesman has his flag up to cut short their celebrations after Abdelmonem bundled in following a free-kick which Hegazy met at the back post and steered back into the area.
69’ – Goal! Egypt 1-1 Ghana (Marmoush): What a shocker from Williams! He’s hardly had a kick today, but he’s just made a calamitous mistake to gift Egypt their equaliser, and it’s that man Marmoush who gets it. Williams won the ball back in Ghana’s half but bizarrely hit a back pass that neither Ofori or Odoi were alert to. Marmoush reacted quickly, and brilliantly took it around Ghana’s goalkeeper before coolly slotting home.
71’ – Goal! Egypt 1-2 Ghana (Kudus): Parity didn’t last long – in fact, it was just one minute and 42 seconds – with Kudus restoring Ghana’s lead! Odoi, who played his part in Egypt’s goal, responded with a great run down the right that resulted in a throw in. It was taken quickly, with Odoi then threading a neat pass into Kudus, whose finish takes a slight deflection that deceives El Shenawy, and it’s 2-1 Ghana!
74’ – Goal! Egypt 2-2 Ghana (Mohamed): This is ludicrous! After such a drab first half, we’ve now had three goals in the space of five minutes, with some more dreadful Ghana defending allowing Mohamed – who has been largely anonymous – to pop up and tuck home from Trezeguet’s cutback. Incredible scenes.
90+7’ – Chance! (Baba): That was the chance! Baba met the corner, with El Shenawy in no man’s land, but the Ghana substitute sends his header wide of a gaping goal. What a miss!
