Black Stars captain, Andre Ayew

Black Stars skipper Dede Ayew has been benched in Ghana's game against Namibia in an international friendly to close off their preparations for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.

Head coach Chris Hughton has named a relatively strong lineup to start the game to test the strength of his first team ahead of the tournament.

The game will also help him give some new faces minutes to prove their worth and showcase their abilities and how integral they could be for the Black Stars at the 2023 AFCON.

At the moment, 26 players out of the 27 players announced for the competition are available for the game. Kudus Mohammed, who is reported to be nursing a minor injury, is the only absentee.

The match will come off at Baba Yara Sports Stadium at 20:00 GMT. The team is expected to jet off to Ivory Coast on Wednesday, January 10, 2024.
