        "For the first time in 2024, the bright lights of Wembley will shine down on England on Saturday evening, when the Three Lions square off with Brazil in a mouthwatering friendly battle.",
        "As Gareth Southgate's men ramp up preparations for Euro 2024, their South American visitors are intending to snap a demoralising sequence of results in Dorival Junior's first game as head coach.",
        "Three years on from their Wembley heartache in the Euro 2020 final, this year's continental championships may represent Southgate's last-chance saloon to finally deliver another slice of international glory to the Three Lions faithful.",
        "Following a 2022 which was best consigned to the back pages of the FA history books, where England suffered World Cup quarter-final dejection and lost their top-tier status in the Nations League, Southgate's men only dropped four points en route to a first-placed finish in their Euro 2024 qualifying section.",
        "Before Southgate's troops can dream of European supremacy, or begin their bid to rise back into League A of the Nations League against Greece, Finland and the Republic of Ireland in tier two, the Three Lions have four friendlies on the 2024 calendar, the second of which sees Belgium make the trek to Wembley three days after Brazil's stopover.",
        "Iceland and Bosnia-Herzegovina will represent England's final pre-Euro 2024 tests in June before the world's third-ranked nation board the plane to Germany.",
        "Southgate's men host Brazil on a 10-match unbeaten run since their World Cup 2022 campaign ended at the hands of France.",
        "While England navigated 2023 without suffering a single defeat, Brazil's post-Tite era has got off to a largely disastrous start, as the five-time champions of the globe arrive at Wembley on a three-game losing run in qualification for the 2026 World Cup.",
        "Despite their uncharacteristic streak of red, Brazil are still on course for qualification to the 2026 World Cup - they sit in the sixth and final automatic spot in the CONMEBOL table.",
        "Two exhibition fixtures with England and Spain represent a prime opportunity for Dorival Junior's men to revert to type, or alternatively decrease national morale further ahead of the 2024 Copa America.",
        "Some solace can be taken from Brazil's head-to-head record versus England, whom they have only lost to four times from their previous 26 competitive and non-competitive matches.",
        "Among the four uncapped players in the England squad is Manchester United's midfield protege Kobbie Mainoo, who was initially called up to the Under-21s this month but was quickly promoted to the first-team ranks by Southgate.",
        "Jarrad Branthwaite, Anthony Gordon and Ezri Konsa also have aspirations of donning the England strip for the first time at senior level.",
        "Kieran Trippier, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Jack Grealish, Luke Shaw, Kalvin Phillips and Ben White - who did not want to be considered for selection - are all missing.",
        "Following an injury scare while playing for Bayern Munich, Harry Kane was one of four players to miss team training on Wednesday - a list which also includes Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and Jordan Henderson - and none of them will be involved here; Saka has left the camp entirely.",
        "As for Brazil, head coach Dorival Junior has already been dealt a quintuple fitness blow this month, as all of Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ederson, Marquinhos and Casemiro have withdrawn from the squad due to injury.",
        "With Alisson Becker also out of contention due to his thigh issue, Junior is working with three uncapped goalkeepers in Leo Jardim, Bento and Rafael, one of whom will therefore make their first-team Brazil debuts at Wembley this weekend.",
        "The shot-stopping trio are three of 11 players bidding to earn their first caps for the five-time World Cup winners this month, a list which also includes Wolverhampton Wanderers' Joao Gomes and Girona winger Savio, soon to be sporting the Manchester City kit."
