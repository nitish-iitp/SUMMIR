England vs. Brazil: Head-to-head record and past meetings

Head-to-head record

Previous meetings: 27
England wins: 4
Draws: 11
Brazil wins: 12

As is the case with so many nations who face Brazil, England are yet another team that have enjoyed very little success against the Selecao across their footballing history.

In 27 meetings, England are fully aware of their dismal record against the five-time world champions, as a win rate of just 15% is their lowest against a single opponent.

Brazil have not proven themselves as good travellers to England in the past though, winning just three of their 13 matches at Wembley, and the 1966 World Cup held in the country was the only tournament they failed to win between 1958 and 1970.

The World Cup is where the two have had their most famous meetings, but the first - back in 1958 - was not a classic, ending in a 0-0 draw, as England were eliminated in the group stage and Brazil went on to win the competition in Sweden.

Four years later on South American soil in Chile, it was the same story as Brazil finished as world champions, and a 3-1 win over England in the quarter-finals was crucial in that success, with Garrincha netting twice in Vina del Mar.

The two nations met again at the 1970 finals in Mexico, and even though England entered as world champions this time, Brazil came out on top again, thanks to Jairzinho's solitary strike, but the game has become synonymous with a phenomenal save by Gordon Banks to deny Pele, often regarded as the 'Save of the Century'.

Over four decades would pass before England and Brazil met at the World Cup again, and like in 1962, the 2002 edition saw the two meet in the quarter-finals.

A 7:30am kickoff time in the UK did not stop millions from tuning in to see Michael Owen give the Three Lions an early lead, but Rivaldo's equaliser in first-half injury time allowed Ronaldinho to score the winner shortly after the interval with an audacious free kick from distance that left David Seaman red-faced in the England goal.

Away from those heavyweight competitive clashes, the two have also played numerous friendlies over the years, the first coming in 1956, when doubles for Tommy Taylor and Colin Grainger helped England to a 4-2 win in front of 100,000 fans at Wembley.

Another meeting in 1981 saw the legendary Zico grace the hallowed turf at Wembley, and the Brazilian scored the only goal as the Selecao left with a 1-0 win.

England got revenge three years later though, as a famous goal from John Barnes helped Bobby Robson's men to a brilliant 2-0 win at the Maracana.

In recent times, both nations have enjoyed success against one another, with Brazil winning 1-0 in 2009, before losing 2-1 at Wembley in 2013.

Later that year, the two faced off again as England made their first trip to the Maracana since that win in 1984, and they were eight minutes from replicating the side from 29 years earlier after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wayne Rooney goals had put Roy Hodgson's side ahead, until Paulinho's late strike saw the match end 2-2.

The most recent meeting was a disappointing one for England though, as Endrick memorably scored his first international goal at the age of 17 in a 1-0 win for the Brazilians at Wembley.
