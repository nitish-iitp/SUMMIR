England's preparations for Euro 2024 get properly under way at Wembley on Saturday, as they face Brazil in the first of two friendlies in the March international break.

There is plenty of excitement surrounding Gareth Southgate's side, who are being tipped as one of the favourites to win this summer's tournament, and the Three Lions boss will hope to use the games against Brazil and Belgium, which are the first internationals since November, to cement his plans ahead of the June deadline for squad selection.

Among those hoping for a chance to force their way onto the plane to Germany are Man Utd teenager Kobbie Mainoo, Brentford striker Ivan Toney, West Ham forward Jarrod Bowen, Aston Villa marksman Ollie Watkins, Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite and Liverpool utility man Joe Gomez.

The visitors may not be quite the force that they were during the eras of Pelé, Ronaldo or Neymar, but Saturday's game will give Southgate's side a chance to test themselves against a top team that boasts some of the best players in world football in their ranks, including the likes of Ederson, Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr.

In terms of Saturday night entertainment, it does not get much better than the first meeting between England and Brazil in seven years at Wembley. A fitting occasion for the first run out of the new Three Lions kit.
