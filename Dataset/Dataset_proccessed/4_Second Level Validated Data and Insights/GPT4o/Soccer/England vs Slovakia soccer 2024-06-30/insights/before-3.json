        "It's do or die for England and Gareth Southgate as they face Slovakia on Sunday in the Euro 2024 round of 16.",
        "The Three Lions may have won Group C, but the hype surrounding them has all but evaporated on the back of three uninspiring performances.",
        "Calls for Southgate to make significant changes have, so far, fallen on deaf ears.",
        "It remains to be seen whether the promising performances of the likes of rising stars Kobbie Mainoo, Cole Palmer and Anthony Gordon late on in the dire goalless draw with Slovenia will be enough to earn the trio a place in the starting XI.",
        "England have been solid defensively and the draw has been kind to them, with a favourable run to the final, but they cannot underestimate a Slovakia team that are in the knockout stages on merit.",
        "Francesco Calzona's squad may not be packed with household names, but they handed Belgium a shock 1-0 defeat in their Group E opener on their way to a third-place finish.",
        "Slovakia will work hard out of possession and pose a direct threat, which could spell trouble given what we've seen from the Three Lions so far.",
        "The pressure will be on England, but if they can respond with a convincing performance to book their place in the quarter-finals it will reignite the nation's Euro 2024 hopes."
