        "Gareth Southgate's side have a favourable last-16 draw as they aim to kick-start their Euro 2024 campaign.",
        "England face Slovakia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday for a place in the Euro 2024 quarter-finals.",
        "This is a crucial last 16 clash for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side after a disappointing group stage in which they scored just two goals.",
        "England beat Serbia 1-0 in their opening game before drawing with Denmark and Slovenia to top Group C.",
        "They will be hoping for more from their star-studded attack, including Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Phil Foden, in their first knockout match in Germany.",
        "England\u2019s biggest injury concern ahead is Kieran Trippier.",
        "The Newcastle full-back trained with the group on Saturday but is reportedly an injury doubt due to an ongoing calf complaint.",
        "Trippier has been starting out of position at left-back throughout the tournament in place of Luke Shaw.",
        "Shaw is back to full fitness, but having not played since February, he still needs minutes off the bench, ideally behind Trippier.",
        "If the first and second-choice left-backs are both unavailable, Southgate is left with two right-footed centre-backs to deploy on the left \u2013 Joe Gomez and Ezri Konsa.",
        "Gomez has played far more football this season on the left, but Southgate appears to prefer Konsa, starting him in the pre-tournament friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
        "In central midfield, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo appears set to replace Conor Gallagher alongside Declan Rice.",
        "Further forward, Foden returned from the birth of his third child quickly enough to assume he will be able to start against Slovakia.",
        "There has been a pronounced clamour for Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon to start ahead of Foden, who has struggled to make strong connections with the attacking players around him."
