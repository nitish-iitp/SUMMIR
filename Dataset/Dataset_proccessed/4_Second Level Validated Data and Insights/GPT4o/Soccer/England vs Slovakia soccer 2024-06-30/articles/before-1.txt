Phil Foden update: Decision made on England return for Euro 2024 Slovakia clash

Phil Foden will return to England's training camp in Germany ahead of Sunday's Euro 2024 last-16 clash with Slovakia after the birth of his third child.

The Football Association revealed on Wednesday that Foden had returned to the UK for a "pressing family matter", just a day after England's drab goalless draw with Slovenia.

With the blessing of Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate, Foden travelled home to be with his pregnant partner, Rebecca Cooke, who has since given birth to a baby boy.

According to multiple reports, Foden will fly back to Germany and return to England's Blankenhain training base on Thursday night.

The Manchester City attacker is set to be back with the first-team squad in time for a closed training session with his Three Lions teammates on Friday.

In April, Foden, 24, and Cooke, 23, announced on Instagram they were expecting a third child.

The couple's other children are five-year-old son Ronnie and two-year-old daughter True.

Will Phil Foden play against Slovakia?

While Foden's return to the England squad is a timely boost ahead of Sunday's contest, it remains to be seen whether he will retain his place in Southgate's starting lineup.

Foden was handed a start in all three of England's group-stage matches against Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia as they finished top of Group C.

However, the Three Lions have flattered to deceive in Germany thus far, picking up five points and scoring only two goals in three group games, and Foden's position on the left flank has been questioned.

Southgate is expected to deliver an update on Foden's situation at a press conference on Saturday ahead of England's 5pm encounter with Slovakia at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen.

If Foden is left out of England's starting lineup, then that could open the door for Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon, a natural left-winger, to come into the first XI, while Chelsea's Cole Palmer and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze are also vying to earn their first start of the tournament.

Alternatively, Southgate may consider starting Foden in his favoured number 10 role, which could see Jude Bellingham move into a deeper role or drop out of the side.
