England face Slovakia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday for a place in the Euro 2024 quarter-finals.

This is a crucial last 16 clash for Gareth Southgate’s side after a disappointing group stage in which they scored just two goals.

England beat Serbia 1-0 in their opening game before drawing with Denmark and Slovenia to top Group C.

And they will be hoping from more from their star-studded attack, including Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Phil Foden, in their first knockout match in Germany.

What time does England vs Slovakia kick off?

England will play Slovakia at 5pm BST in Gelsenkirchen’s Veltins Arena.

The game will go to extra-time and penalties if there is no winner after normal time.

England vs Slovakia TV channel and live stream

England vs Slovakia will be aired on ITV1 and ITVX, with coverage starting at 3.30pm BST ahead of the 5pm kickoff.

Coverage will be hosted by Mark Pougatch, with Ian Wright, Gary Neville and Roy Keane likely featured as pundits.

The Newcastle full-back trained with the group on Saturday but is reportedly an injury doubt due to an ongoing calf complaint.

Trippier has been starting out of position at left-back throughout the tournament in place of Luke Shaw.

Shaw is back to full fitness, but having not played since February, he still needs minutes off the bench, ideally behind Trippier.

But if the first and second-choice left-backs are both unavailable, Southgate is left with two right-footed centre-backs to deploy on the left – Joe Gomez and Ezri Konsa.

Gomez has played far more football this season on the left, but Southgate appears to prefer Konsa, starting him in the pre-tournament friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In central midfield, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo appears set to replace Conor Gallagher alongside Declan Rice.

And further forward, Foden returned from the birth of his third child quickly enough to assume he will be able to start against Slovakia.

There has been a pronounced clamour for Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon to start ahead of Foden, who has struggled to make strong connections with the attacking players around him.
