Preview: Botswana vs. Egypt - prediction, team news, lineups

Botswana will take on Egypt in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match at the Francistown Stadium on Tuesday.

The hosts are looking to record their first set of points in this AFCON qualifying campaign, and their first ever win against the visitors.

Botswana's only AFCON appearance came in 2012, and they lost all three matches in that tournament - if their start to the current qualifying campaign is anything to go by, the Zebras may see this wait prolonged.

Despite holding on for the most part, Didier Gomes Da Rosa's men eventually succumbed to an 84th-minute goal by Sidi Bouna Amar, losing 1-0 against Mauritania.

The defeat saw Botswana's winless run extended to four matches – two draws and two losses each, part of which was during an underwhelming COSAFA Cup campaign.

Didier Gomes was appointed as the head coach of the Zebras in November ahead of the World Cup 2026 qualifiers, and he has recorded only two wins so far – both in World Cup qualifying matches.

The home side have also failed to score in six of 11 matches under the French coach, while they have conceded 10 times in that period.

Things could get even worse as the hosts will take on a side they have never beaten despite playing them six times in the past – including four AFCON qualifying matches which they have lost three and drawn one.

Africa's most successful side in the continental tournament, Egypt, lived up to their reputation in the first match of their AFCON qualifiers at the Cairo International Stadium last Friday.

The Pharaohs won 3-0 against Cape Verde, thanks to first-half goals from Ramy Rabia and Omar Marmoush, and a second-half strike from Ibrahim Adel.

Currently top of Group C, Hossam Hassan's side will hope they can extend their winning run in the AFCON qualifiers to six matches when they take on Botswana, as well as their current unbeaten run across all competitions to four matches.

Egypt are also enjoying a four-match unbeaten run on the road – which has included three wins and a draw – but their last away defeat was in an AFCON qualifying match against Ethiopia.

After featuring in the last match, Mosha Gaolaolwe rose to fifth on Botswana's all-time appearance list with 79 caps, and he is expected to remain as the midfield anchor on Tuesday.

Kabelo Seakanyeng, who has scored 10 goals in 61 caps, and the winger should be part of a front three that includes Tumisang Orebonye and Molaodi Tlhalefang.

Eintracht Frankfurt forward Marmoush made a return to the Egypt squad after missing the June matches due to a hand injury and got on the scoresheet.

He is expected to be part of an attacking quartet that should include Liverpool star Mohamed Salah, Ahmed Sayed and Mostafa Mohamed.


Botswana possible starting lineup:
Phoko; Mangolo, Ditlhokwe, Kopelang, Sikele; Mohutsiwa, Gaolaolwe, Majafi; Orebonye, Tlhalefang, Seakanyeng

Egypt possible starting lineup:
El Shenawy; Hany, Rabia, Fathi, Hamdy; Trezeguet, Attia; Marmoush, Sayed, Salah; Mohamed



We say: Botswana 0-2 Egypt

Egypt possess a wealth of quality in their ranks, which will likely prove too much for Botswana to handle – the visitors have also demonstrated in the past that they can cope with this opponent, which is why we predict a victory for them.
