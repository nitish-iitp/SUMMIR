Botswana vs Egypt Player Ratings: Trezeguet stars in 4-0 win for the Pharaohs
Africa Cup Of Nations
Botswana
Botswana vs Egypt
Egypt

A first half brace from Trezeguet laid the foundation for Egypt to go on and beat Botswana 4-0 in the African Cup of Nations Qualification, Group C, Round 2 game played on Tuesday.

Botswana looked out of sorts and there was a clear difference in quality between both sides right from the very first whistle. After Trezeguet’s first-half brace, Liverpool star Mohamed Salah scored the third goal in the 56th minute of the game and Egypt went on to comfortably close the game from there on before Fathi placed the cherry on the cake right at the end of the game with a goal to his name.

After this defeat, Botswana will return to international football action in October when they take on Cape Verde in back-to-back games on the 7th and 15th respectively.

For Egypt, Mohamed Salah and co. will be facing Mauritania in a doubleheader, again on the 7th and 15th October respectively. Here’s a look at Botswana vs Egypt Player Ratings:

Goalkeeper:

G. Phoko – 7/10 – Without his four very good saves, Botswana could have faced a very heavy defeat.

Defenders:

B. Mangolo – 6/10 – Was dominated by Mohamed Salah till the Egyptian was on the field. But, who can blame him? Salah dominates everyone he plays against.

T. Ditlhokwe – 6/10 – Two clearances, one successful tackle and one interception. Tried his best, but the gulf in quality between the two sides was just too much.

T. Kopelang – 5.5/10 – Lost possession seven times in the game in crucial positions, not something you’d expect out of a national-level footballer.

A. Velaphi – 5/10 – If Kopelang wasn’t bad, Velaphi was worse. Lost possession 12 times in the game. Trezeguet absolutely bullied him.

Midfielders:

G. Mohutsiwa – 6/10 – Played close to 70 minutes. Tried to help his left-back defend against Mohamed Salah and spent most of his time doing exactly that in the game.

K. Majafi – 5.5/10 – Very poor in the first half. Was substituted in the 52nd minute as he seemed to have run out of steam.

M. Gaolaolwe – 6.5/10 – Best midfielder for Botswana on the night. Possessed a 77% passing accuracy and won four duels.

Forwards:

K. Seakanyeng – 6.5/10 – Played full 90 minutes and could muster one shot on target. Also missed one big chance to score in the game.

T. Orebonye – 6.5/10 – Also featured for 90 minutes, maintained a 78% pass accuracy rate. Took one shot, which was off-target. Lost possession 16 times.

O. Ramotse – 6.7/10 – 76% passing accuracy, and had 68 touches in and around the Egyptian penalty area. Was more of a menace than his other two strike partners.

Substitutes:

T. Sesinyi – 6.5/10 – Brought in some energy but wasn’t enough as Egypt completely overpowered him and his teammates.

G.Baruti – 6/10 – Average at best, couldn’t have any kind of impact to help Botswana find a way back into the game.

Gape Thibedi – 6/10 – Was a spectator, especially for Egypt’s final goal of the game.

Manager:

Didier Gomes Da Rosa – 6/10

Goalkeeper:

El-Shenawy – 6.5/10 – Didn’t have a single save to make throughout the game.

Defenders:

M. Hany – 7/10 – Looked jittery for quite some time before calming himself. Had a brilliant second half.

R. Rabia – 7/10 – Was solid whenever called upon, and built multiple moves that led to strong Egyptian attacks.

K. Sobhi – 7/10 – Didn’t have much to do in the game. Handled the odd Botswana attack with ease.

M. Hamdi – 7/10 – Continuously bombarded Botswana’s right side with his penetrating runs and created space for his attacking teammates.

Midfielders:

H. Fathi – 7/10 – Complemented Attia very well. Featured for 83 minutes and didn’t put a foot wrong.

M. Attia – 7/10 – Sat deep alongside Fathi and didn’t put a foot wrong throughout the game.

M.Salah – 8/10 – The Liverpool superstar can’t stop scoring at the moment. Was at his devastating best from the right.

Zizo – 7/10 – Sat at number 10 and pulled the strings to arrange key passes of the ball wide on both sides to Salah and Trezeguet.

M. Trezeguet – 9/10 – The best player on the pitch by a country mile. An incredible feat considering he shared the pitch with Mohamed Salah.

Forwards:

O. Faisal – 6.5/10 – Decent in helping his teammates in building-up play, and did everything except scoring a goal.

Substitutes:

A.N. Koka – 6.5/10 – Steadied the ship and held possession well to help Egypt cruise to a win.

I. Adel – 7/10 – Played for just 15 odd minutes and was the star of the show until the end of the game.

M. Elneny – 6.5/10 – Helped close out the game for Egypt as he has done on so many occasions in the past.

N. Maher – N/A – Came in too late to have any effect on the game.

M. Fathy – 7/10 – Came in too late, but despite that, scored Egypt’s fourth goal.

Manager:

Hossam Hassan – 8/10
