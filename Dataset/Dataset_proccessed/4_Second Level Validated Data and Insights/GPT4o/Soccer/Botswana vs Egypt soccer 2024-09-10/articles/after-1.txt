Botswana and Egypt square off in Group C of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Tuesday

Botswana and Egypt are back in action in Group C of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they square off at the Francistown Stadium on Tuesday. Both sides head into the game off the back of contrasting opening-day results, with the Pharaohs claiming a comfortable victory over Cape Verde.

Botswana’s bid for an AFCON return kicked off on Saturday when they fell to a 1-0 defeat against Mauritania at the Stade de la Capitale. Didier Da Rosa’s men have now failed to win their last four matches across all competitions, a run which saw them crash out of the 2024 COSAFA Cup in the group stages back in July.

Botswana, whose last AFCON appearance came back in 2012, will now look to get their qualifying campaign up and running as they aim to end their 14-year absence from the continental showpiece.

Meanwhile, Egypt turned in a superb team performance last Friday when they cruised to a 3-0 victory over Cape Verde in their group opener. In a one-sided affair at the Cairo International Stadium, Rami Rabia, Omar Marmoush and Ibrahim Adel all found the target to fire the Pharaohs to a comfortable victory.

Egypt will look to pick up consecutive wins for the first time since beating Djibouti and Sierra Leone in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers back in November 2023.

Botswana vs Egypt Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
Egypt hold a clear upper hand in the history of this fixture, having picked up four wins and one draw in the previous five encounters between the two nations.
The Pharaohs are unbeaten in 12 of their last 13 competitive matches, claiming eight wins and four draws since June 2022.
Botswana have failed to win eight of their nine games across all competitions in 2024, losing three and picking up five draws since the turn of the year.
Egypt have lost just one of their last nine competitive away matches while picking up three wins and five draws since June 2022.
Botswana vs Egypt Prediction

Egypt kicked off the qualifying journey with a comprehensive victory over Cape Verde and will head into Tuesday’s clash with sky-high confidence. The Pharaohs have been dominant in the history of this fixture and we are backing them to come away with all three points at the Francistown Stadium.
