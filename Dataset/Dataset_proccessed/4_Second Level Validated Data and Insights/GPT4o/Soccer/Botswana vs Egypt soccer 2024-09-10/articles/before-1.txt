Botswana vs Egypt
Preview
Tournament: AFCON Qualifying
Date: Tuesday, Sep 10
Kick-off Time: 2:00 pm GMT
Venue: Francistown Stadium, Botswana

Egypt’s national football team will battle for supremacy with the Botswana national football team for the top spot in the Group C AFCON qualifying at the Francistown Stadium. Botswana doesn’t have any significant status on the international stage, so we could expect an easy win for The Pharaohs.

The hosts have struggled recently and lost their opening game of the qualification to Mauritania. It has been more than 12 years since they have qualified for the African Cup of Nations and their only appearance came in the 2012 edition. The Zebra’s latest defeat saw their winless run extend to four matches.

Meanwhile, Egypt’s national football team are the most successful team in the AFCON and are coming off a 3-0 win over Cape Verde in their opening game of the qualifying. Hossam Hassan’s squad will be hoping to extend their winning run to six matches in the AFCON qualifiers. Historically, Egypt had the upper hand in their last five meetings against the hosts.

Botswana vs Egypt Prediction

Botswana’s national football team have consistently struggled to qualify for the competition and their only participation came in 2012 when they lost their three matches to exit from the group stage. They have started their World Cup qualifying campaign with a 1-0 loss in Mauritania which left them without a goal in their last three games. But they have managed to keep clean sheets in two out of their last four games.

Egypt’s national football team, meanwhile, are favourites for this tie due to their dominant record against the hosts. Egypt are the most successful team in the tournament are clear favorite to win this fixture.
