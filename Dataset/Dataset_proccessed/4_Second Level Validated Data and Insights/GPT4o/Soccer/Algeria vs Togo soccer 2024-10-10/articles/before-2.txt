Preview: Algeria vs. Togo - prediction, team news, lineups
By Babafemi Busari
Published: October 8 2024 | 21:19

Algeria and Togo will clash in a Group E Africa Cup of Nations qualifier this Thursday, with the hosts eager to preserve their perfect start to the campaign, having won both of their opening matches to sit atop the group.

With a strong home record, having not lost an AFCON qualifying match on home soil since 2007, the hosts will be confident of building on their recent form under their new manager.

Algeria will head into this match against Togo in high spirits, sitting atop the table with six points from two games, having secured victories over Equatorial Guinea and Liberia while maintaining clean sheets in both matches.

The Fennec Foxes' impressive 16-game unbeaten streak in AFCON qualifiers - with their last defeat dating back to an away loss to Benin in 2018 and their last home defeat dating back to 2007 - gives them a significant advantage heading into their upcoming match.

Algeria's recent form across all competitions highlights a strong side, currently enjoying a three-match winning streak, with their last loss occurring against Guinea in a World Cup qualifying match, which marked the first competitive fixture under new manager Vladimir Petkovic.

Since that setback, Petkovic's men have won three consecutive games, two of which have reinforced their early dominance in Group E, as a victory in this match would grant the home side an almost unassailable lead in the group.

The hosts' star-studded roster, featuring Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani, is a key factor in their reputation as one of Africa's top teams and that wealth of talent as well as top-level experience, will be crucial in leading the charge against a struggling Togo side.

Togo enter this game with a sense of urgency, having drawn both of their opening group games, and with just two points from as many matches, they sit in second place behind their hosts and will need to secure points to distance themselves from the other two teams in the group to maintain their qualification hopes.

The visitors have struggled to secure victories in this qualifying campaign, relying heavily on the individual brilliance of their best players, as demonstrated in their most recent outing - a 2-2 draw against Equatorial Guinea, where they needed a last-minute equaliser from Kodjo Fo Doh Laba to salvage a point.

Defensively, Togo have shown vulnerability, highlighted by a five-match winless streak across all competitions as well as the three goals already conceded in their opening two qualifying games.

Manager Dare Nibombe, appointed in July, is still seeking his first win as head coach and his team's vulnerable defensive organisation will face another significant challenge against Algeria's attacking firepower in this game.

Goalkeeper Anthony Mandrea, who has been a regular for the Desert Foxes, was not called up due to urgent family matters, while Alexandre Okidja, who recently came out of international retirement, misses out as well due to a reported lack of match fitness.

In attack, the squad sees the inclusion of Ibrahim Maza for the first time, as the 20-year-old forward continues to impress.

Petkovic also welcomes back Badredine Bouanani, who has been in fine form for Nice and Ahmed Touba, whose performances for Belgian side Mechelen have earned him a recall.

Togo will be without their talisman Kodjo Laba, who scored in their last match and has been a key figure for the team in this AFCON qualifying campaign. His absence will be a major blow to the visitors, who will need to find alternative solutions in attack.

The visitors' goalkeeper Geoffrey Agbolossou will need to be at his best if the visitors are to secure a result in this challenging encounter - his performance will be crucial in keeping out the hosts' potent attack.


Algeria possible starting lineup:
Bouhalfaya; Mandi, Ait-Nouri, Bensebaini; Farsi, Boudawi, Zerrouki, Aouar, Hadjam; Gouiri, Mahrez

Togo possible starting lineup:
Agbolossou; Akueson, Djene, Amevor; Narey, Aholou, Romao, Agbagno; Tchakei, Placca; Denkey



We say: Algeria 2-0 Togo

Algeria's formidable home record in AFCON qualifiers, combined with their current winning streak and defensive solidity, makes them strong favourites to secure a victory.

Togo, on the other hand, have struggled defensively, and with their talisman Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba unavailable, they are likely to find it difficult to break down the hosts.
