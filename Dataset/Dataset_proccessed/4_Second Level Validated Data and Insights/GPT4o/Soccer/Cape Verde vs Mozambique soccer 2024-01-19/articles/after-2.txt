WATCH: Ex-Man Utd flop Bebe scores INSANE long-range free kick for Cape Verde against Mozambique at 2023 AFCON

Cape Verde vs Mozambique
Mozambique

Manchester United flop Bebe scored a brilliant free-kick for Cape Verde in their African Cup of Nations clash with Mozambique on Friday.

Bebe scored a wonder goal

Bebe flopped under Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford
WHAT HAPPENED?

Bebe took aim from a ridiculous distance after a free-kick was awarded for Cape Verde against Mozambique. Standing around 40 yards out, he decided to shoot, and somehow found the back of the net. Mozambique goalkeeper Hernani Siluane got a hand to the ball, but only seemed to push it in. Cape Verde ultimately won the game 3-0, as Ryan Mendes and Kevin Pina also found the net.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Bebe currently plays for Real Zaragoza in the Spanish second-tier, on loan from Rayo Vallecano. He has endured a rather nomadic career since playing for Manchester United between 2010 and 2014; he cost the club £7.4m but only played seven times in total. He has since played for Benfica, Eibar and Vallecano permanently, and embarked on seven loan spells.

WHAT NEXT FOR BEBE?

Cape Verde are next in action against Egypt on Monday. They are currently top of Group B in AFCON after winning their opening two games against Ghana and Mozambique.
