Cape Verde seek qualification from their Africa Cup of Nations group when they take on Mozambique at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium on Friday.

The Blue Sharks began their Group B journey with a victory over Ghana, while the Mambas suffered late misery against seven-time champions Egypt.

Cape Verde claimed a deserved third win at AFCON on Sunday when they scored a late winning goal against Ghana to seal a 2-1 victory.

Jamiro Monteiro and Garry Rodrigues scored either side of Alexander Djiku's second-half equaliser, with the Blue Sharks' 92nd-minute strike no less than they merited after outplaying the Black Stars for considerable periods.

Bubista's men go into Friday's clash with Mozambique keen to secure maximum points to assure them of a spot in the round of 16 at the continental showpiece, matching their AFCON 2021 performance.

It would be gratifying for Cape Verde to make the first knockout round in successive finals for the first time, and they should back themselves to produce a similar showing from Sunday's win to seal qualification.

The Blue Sharks face Egypt in their final group fixture, and going into that game without the pressure of needing a result will be just what the doctor ordered.

As for Mozambique, Chiquinho Conde hopes his players have let go of Sunday's disappointment against Egypt when they take to the field against Cape Verde.

The Mambas trailed to an early Mostafa Mohamed goal but rallied after half time to lead 2-1 through goals from Witi and Clesio Bauque in minutes 55 and 58 to send the underdogs ahead in Abidjan.

However, a late penalty conceded and ultimately scored by Liverpool star Mohamed Salah robbed Chiquinho's men of a memorable first win at the continental showpiece against the seven-time winners.

Mozambique showed promise when they broke forward with speed against the Pharaohs, but it remains to be seen if those counter-attacking opportunities present themselves on Friday.

While the Mambas' were let down by their execution against the North African giants, fans hope the reduced pressure against Cape Verde aids decision-making for a nation seeking its first win at this level.

The Blue Sharks avoided injuries to Sunday's starters and could lean on that group against Mozambique in their second match at AFCON 2023.

Rodrigues could push for a start following his impact as a substitute against the Black Stars.

It remains to be seen if the hamstring issue sustained against Egypt prevents Clesio from starting, but the attacker should play from the off if he is 100%.

Domingos struggled defensively against the Pharaohs, eventually conceding the penalty that cost Mozambique, and the right-back seeks an improved showing in the Mambas' second game.


Cape Verde possible starting lineup:
Vozinha; Moreira, Costa, Pico, Paulo; Duarte, Pina, Monteiro; Mendes, Bebe, Cabral

Mozambique possible starting lineup:
Ernani; Macandza, Mexer, Dove, Mandava; Witi, Guima, Amade, Gildo; Clesio; Ratifo



We say: Cape Verde 2-1 Mozambique

Cape Verde are undefeated in three games against Mozambique (two wins), and that unbeaten sequence should become four as the Blue Sharks secure progress to the round of 16.
