15:48 – South Sudan 1-1 South Africa. Bafana agonisingly close to a second goal, with Thapelo Morena seeing a shot blocked by a defender on the goal line – with more than a hint of hand-ball – and he then hits the rebound onto the crossbar!




15h43 – Rwanda 0-0 Nigeria: Victor Boniface comes agonisingly close to opening the scoring after a shot inside the area struck the crossbar.

15:16 – South Sudan 0-0 South Africa. Penalty to South Sudan! Siyabonga Ngezana with a clumsy foul on Tito Okello and the hosts have the chance to open the scoring from 12 yards.
