We said: Chad 0-3 Ivory Coast
While Chad will look to build on their opening-day result against Sierra Leone, they have their work cut out against a star-studded Ivory Coast who are currently firing on all cylinders. Given the gulf in quality and depth between the two nations, we are backing the reigning African champions to come away with a comfortable victory at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium. Read more.
