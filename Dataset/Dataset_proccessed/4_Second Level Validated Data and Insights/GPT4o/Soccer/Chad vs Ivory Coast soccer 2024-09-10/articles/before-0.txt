Chad will be looking to secure their first win in Group G of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they take on reigning champions Ivory Coast at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium on Tuesday.

Les Elephants journey to Yaounde unbeaten in each of their last nine outings across all competitions and will be looking to make it two wins from two to start their push for a place in Morocco.

Chad's bid for a first-ever AFCON appearance kicked off on Friday when they held on to secure a goalless draw against Sierra Leone at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex.

A total of 19 shots were fired between the two nations but neither goalkeeper would end up picking the ball out of the back of the net, with a draw being a fair result upon reflection.

While head coach Kevin Nicaise would have hoped for all three points, the 39-year-old will feel proud of the performance from his side, who had lost each of their four matches in World Cup qualifiers to sit rock-bottom in Group I.

Chad have now gone unbeaten in three straight AFCON qualifying, having picked up home and away victories over Mauritania in their preliminary-round clash in March to complete a 3-1 aggregate win over the Lions of Chinguetti.

On the other hand, reigning African champions Ivory Coast kicked off their qualifying journey on a positive note as they picked up a 2-0 victory over Zambia when the two nations squared off on Friday.

Following a goalless first half at the Stade de la Paix, Paris FC striker Jean-Philippe Krasso single-handedly put the visitors to the sword as he netted twice in an 11-minute spell to hand the D all three points.

Ivory Coast have now gone nine consecutive games without defeat across all competitions — picking up seven wins and two draws — a run which saw them clinch their third AFCON title courtesy of a 2-1 victory over Nigeria in the final on February 11.

Emerse Fae's men are also well on course to secure their place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, having picked up 10 points from the first 12 available in Group F to sit top of the table, one point above Gabon in the playoff spot.

Ivory Coast will be backing themselves to continue from where they left off on Saturday as they take on an opposing side who have failed to win 16 of their last 18 games across all competitions, losing 12 and claiming four draws since November 2015.

Foullah Edifice FC man Acyl Mbogo was forced off injured late in Chad's opening game against Sierra Leone at the weekend and the 22-year-old defender is a doubt for Tuesday's clash.

Should he fail to shake off the injury, Yverdon-Sport's Mahamat Thiam will push for a place in the starting XI, forming the back five with Natoyoum Osee, Charles Tchouplaou, Ahmat Abdaraman and Ahmad Toure Ngouyamsa.

At the opposite end of the pitch, 26-year-old Marius Mouandilmadji should lead Chad's attack once again, while Wiliam Damba and Sindou Yeo should team up at the centre of the park.

Off the back of a super cameo against Zambia, Krasso could be rewarded with a starting role on Tuesday, which will see Nice's Evann Guessand sweat over his role in the front three.

Simon Adingra was also a standout performer against the Chipolopolo and the Brighton and Hove Albion man should start on the left side of the front three, while Amad Diallo, Jean Michael Seri and skipper Franck Kessie should start in midfield.

At the defensive end of the pitch, we expect Fae to name an unchanged back four of Wilfried Singo, Emmanuel Agbadou, Evan Ndicka and Christopher Operi shielding Angers man Yahia Fofana in goal.


Chad possible starting lineup:
Gabin; Osee, Tchouplaou, Abdaraman, Ngouyamsa, Thiam; Hiver, Damba, Yeo, Allarabaye; Mouandilmadji

Ivory Coast possible starting lineup:
Fofana; Singo, Agbadou, Ndicka, Operi; Diallo, Seri, Kessie; Diakite, Krasso, Adingra


We say: Chad 0-3 Ivory Coast

While Chad will look to build on their opening-day result against Sierra Leone, they have their work cut out against a star-studded Ivory Coast who are currently firing on all cylinders.

Given the gulf in quality and depth between the two nations, we are backing the reigning African champions to come away with a comfortable victory at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium.
