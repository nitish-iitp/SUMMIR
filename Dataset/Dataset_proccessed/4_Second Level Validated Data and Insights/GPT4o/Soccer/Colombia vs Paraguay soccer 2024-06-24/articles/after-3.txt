Colombia look like the real deal

Nine wins on the bounce for Colombia, and 24 matches since their last defeat. Despite a nervier-than-expected closing 20 minutes, they look as dynamic and as fired-up as their amazing run of form suggests.

FT: Colombia 2-1 Paraguay

One last half-chance for Paraguay but their final shot is closer to clearing the stadium roof than it is to troubling Colombia's goalkeeper.

The referee whistles for full time shortly thereafter and Colombia have held on to take all three points!

Well, it's been real. Colombia's fans popped some smoke bombs and the fire alarm in the press box is now going off.

Looks like we'll be ushered out of here shortly.

Colombia make their final subs as James Rodríguez, assister of both of their goals, comes off to a great ovation alongside Jhon Arias. Juan Fernando Quintero and Kevin Castaño come on in their place.

Paraguay make their final sub as well, surprisingly taking off Julio Enciso. Matías Rojas comes on in his stead.

After reviewing the play at the monitor, the referee announces to the largely pro-Colombia crowd that the penalty is disallowed!

PENALTY to Colombia!

84' Colombia 2-1 Paraguay

The referee spots Velazquez pulling on Mina, preventing him from winning a header at the back post, and points to the spot for a penalty without hesitation!

The Paraguay players surround him, they are livid. VAR is reviewing the call.

Worth noting that Velazquez has already been booked.

77' Colombia 2-1 Paraguay

Rodriguez goes for goal this time, shooting around a defender but dragging the ball wide of the far post.

Rodriguez wanted a third assist

75' Colombia 2-1 Paraguay

Rodriguez is too unselfish! Colombia break forward, Arias releasing Rodriguez on the left side, but the former Real Madrid man attempts to cut the ball back for a teammate instead of going for goal himself. He had a clear view of the near side of the goal but instead his pass is cut out by Balbuena.

Paraguay looking to overturn 77 years of history

72' Colombia 2-1 Paraguay

"The last time Paraguay came back from a two-goal deficit at Copa America?" I hear some of you asking now.

Well, the answer is 1947, when they beat Uruguay 4-2 after trailing 2-0.
