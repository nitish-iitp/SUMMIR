TELL ME MORE

A dominant first half from Colombia set the tone for the match, with Los Cafeteros instilling an intimidating stance. However, their failure to capitalize on momentum allowed Paraguay back it late.

Two first-half headers, both of which were assisted by James Rodriguez, put Los Cafeteros up 2-0 at the break. The first was nodded home by Daniel Munoz and the second by Jefferson Lerma.

Paraguay climbed back into the match in the second half. Brighton winger Julio Enciso, their brightest player all match, found the back of the net with a tidy effort in the 69th minute.

However, it was too little, too late.

Los Cafeteros closed out the match and secured the 2-1 victory, with L:A Albirroja falling just short late.

DID YOU KNOW?

They did not qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

THE MVP

James Rodriguez:

What is this, 2016? What a showing from the ex-Real Madrid star. This was the best version of Rodriguez possible, and Colombia were the better for it. With two magnificent assists, his vision on the ball never ceases to amaze.

If he can perform like this throughout the entirety of Copa America, Los Cafeteros have to be considered one of the favorites to take the crown.

THE BIG LOSER

Miguel Almiron:

The Newcastle winger was non-existent across the match, failing to lead his attack as their established superstar. The former Atlanta United player struggled to make anything happen in the final-third, and didn't spark any momentum for his nation on the ball.

He was hooked after just 59 minutes.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Colombia will take on Costa Rica on June 28 in the next match of the Group Stage. Then, it will be a finale against Brazil and Vinicius Jr. on Tuesday, July 2.
