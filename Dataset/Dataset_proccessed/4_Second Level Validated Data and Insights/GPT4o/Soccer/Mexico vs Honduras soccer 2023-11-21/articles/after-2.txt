Mexico vs Honduras
Honduras

TELL ME MORE

After falling 2-0 to Honduras in the opener, Mexico returned to the Azteca knowing that the team would need a big result to seal automatic qualification to the Copa America.

A goal from Luis Chavez in the second half gave the hosts hope, bringing them within a goal. Honduras legs tired as the match wore on and Mexico turned up the pressure, creating several chances late on to equalize the aggregate scoreline.

Finally, in minute 11 of the nine minutes of stoppage time, Mexico controversially got their equalizer as Alvarez played hero by firing El Tri's second goal. Honduras were left incensed and proceeded to lose their heads, earning two red cards en route to penalties.

Once there, though, there was no denying Mexico. Bryan Rochez's penalty was stopped by Luis Malagon, giving Mexico the early advantage. Honduras was handed a lifeline when goalkeeper Edrick Menjivar stopped Cesar Huerta not once but twice from the spot. However, on both saves, Menjivar was deemed to be off his line, with Huerta burying the ensuing penalty on the way to Mexico's victory.

THE MVP

You have to hand it to Alvarez, who is as important as ever to El Tri. The standout midfielder was spectacular throughout the match, and of course, it was him that stepped up with the goal to save Mexico's skin.

It was a superstar-like goal from a Mexican ace, one that kept his side's Copa America dream alive when all hope appeared to be totally lost.

THE BIG LOSER

Poor, poor Honduras.

They were seconds away from stunning El Tri, having deservedly won the first leg on home soil. They fought valiantly in this away leg, too, and easily could have escaped the famous Azteca with the result they needed.

It wasn't to be. After Alvarez's goal, Honduras lost their heads, but did just enough to get to penalties. Once there, they were unfortunate that Menjivar was called twice for popping on his line.

It just seemed the Soccer Gods were against Honduras, who just couldn't quite hold on.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

With the win, Mexico have locked up their spot in the Copa America, as well as a match against Panama in the Nations League semifinals during the March international window window. The winner of that clash will face either the U.S. or Jamaica in the final, with El Tri having seen their last two Nations League campaigns ended at the hands of the rival Americans.

Honduras will now have to sweat out their Copa America spot and won't know their fate until March. During the March international window, they will face Costa Rica, with the winner booking a spot in the Copa America.
