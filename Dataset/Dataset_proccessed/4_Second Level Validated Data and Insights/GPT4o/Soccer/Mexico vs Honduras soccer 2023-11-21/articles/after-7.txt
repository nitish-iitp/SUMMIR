A gassed Honduras side could not hold on and gave up the tying goal in the 10th minute of added time, then survived to reach penalty kicks, during the spot kicks Mexico’s César Huerta missed his penalty kick attempts twice but scored on his third attempt after referee Iván Barton stated Honduras keeper Edrick Menjívar stepped off his line twice before.


As Mexico advanced 4-2 on penalty kicks the world press came down hard on Iván Barton and Honduras newspapers wrote in the morning that things were called in Mexico’s favor so they can qualify for the Copa America and continue in the Nations League.
