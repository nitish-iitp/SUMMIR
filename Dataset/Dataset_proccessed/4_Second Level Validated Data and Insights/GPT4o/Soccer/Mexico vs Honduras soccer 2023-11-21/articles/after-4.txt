MEXICAN ELEGANCE!

Adidas released one of its retro jerseys for the Mexican national team inspired by the classic style of the mid-80s, prior to the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. This retro design is characterized by the emblematic three stripes on the sleeves, the V-neck with the traditional colors of Mexico and the shield of the Mexican Football Federation embroidered on the right chest. The vintage touch is completed with the distinctive presence of the adidas Trifolio.

THE AWAY GOAL FACTOR

Mexico will have to be careful in the defensive zone for this match since a goal by the opponent would force the tricolor to score four goals due to the fact that it was established as a tie-breaking factor for these Quarterfinals. In other words, Mexico must win 2-0 to qualify for the semifinals and if they concede, they must win by a four-goal difference regardless of the score.

THE PRESSURE IS ON

The Mexican National Team will face this second leg of the CONCACAF Nations League Quarterfinals with the greatest of responsibilities, but also with enormous pressure from its own and others, as it is playing for a ticket to the Copa América after having stumbled in Tegucigalpa in the first leg. Likewise, a goal by the Honduran National Team would force Mexico to score 4 goals, so it will not be allowed to make mistakes in the defensive zone.

Apart from being the match that will give the winner a ticket to the semifinals of the CONCACAF Nations League and, therefore, the opportunity to play in the final four of the same, it will also be the match that will grant one of the 16 tickets to next year's Copa América. However, there will be one more ticket at stake in a playoff to be played on Saturday, March 23, 2024 for the loser of the game.

Close to glory and a ticket to the Copa América

On the other hand, the Honduran national team arrives at the Azteca Stadium in high spirits after having played one of the best games in the last ten years of Honduran soccer after defeating the Mexican national team with a great soccer by a final score of 2-0. With the advantage obtained in the first leg, Honduras is close to getting its pass to the Copa América and to do so, it will only need to tie or win at the mythical Coloso de Santa Úrsula to leave the champion of the confederation on display once again.

A comeback is a must

After losing in Tegucigalpa to a great display of soccer by Honduras, the Mexican tricolor will have to rethink the game at the Azteca Stadium as the pressure Jaime Lozano and his players will be under will be the greatest since the new era of the national D. Likewise, the score in Honduras means that Mexico will have to play a perfect game because if they allow a goal, it would complicate their attempt to get a ticket to the Copa América 2025, since in this qualifying round the away goal does count as a tiebreaker.
