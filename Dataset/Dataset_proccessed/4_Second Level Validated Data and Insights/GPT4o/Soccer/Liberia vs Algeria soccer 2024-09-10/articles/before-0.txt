Algeria set out in search of a second consecutive victory in Group E of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they visit the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex to take on Liberia on Tuesday.

Having failed to win any of the previous six meetings between the two nations, the Lone Stars will head into the midweek clash looking to get one over the visitors and secure their first win of the campaign.

Liberia had to dig deep in the Group E curtain-raiser as they fought back from behind to snatch a point against Togo when the two nations squared off at the Stade de Kegue.

With nothing to separate the two sides heading into the final 10 minutes, Cercle Brugge striker Kevin Denkey broke the deadlock to put Togo in front, but William Gibson scored a 92nd-minute header to force a share of the spoils.

Despite the result, head coach Mario Marinica will be impressed with the show of fighting spirit from his side, who picked up a 2-0 aggregate victory over Djibouti in the preliminary phase of the qualifiers back in March.

Liberia have now gone unbeaten in five straight games across all competitions, claiming three draws and two wins, including a 1-0 victory over Sao Tome and Principe in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, where they sit third in Group H, three points off first-placed Tunisia.

Next up for the Lone Stars is the stern challenge of taking on an opposing side whom they have failed to get the better of in the last six encounters between the teams, losing three and claiming three draws since February 1999.

Algeria, on the other hand, kicked off their quest for a place in Morocco on a high as they secured a 2-0 victory over Equatorial Guinea at the Miloud Hadefi Stadium on Thursday.

After Riyad Mahrez failed to convert his 24th-minute penalty, former Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar broke the deadlock in the 69th minute before substitute Amine Gouiri put the result beyond reach with a 95th-minute strike.

This followed a 2-1 comeback victory over Uganda in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers at the Mandela National Stadium on June 10, a result which saw the Greens' run of four back-to-back competitive games without a win come to an end.

Algeria have picked up three wins from their four games in Group G of the World Cup qualifiers to sit top of the table, level on nine points with second-placed Mozambique in the playoff spot.

With Thursday's result, Vladimir Petkovic's men have now gone 15 consecutive matches without defeat in the AFCON qualifiers, picking up 11 wins and four draws since a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Benin in October 2018.

Algeria, who are 46th in the latest FIFA World Rankings, will now set out in search of a third straight competitive victory for the first time since June 2023 as they look to secure a sixth AFCON appearance since missing out in 2012.

It is worth noting that since clinching crown in 2019, Algeria have failed to progress past the group stages of continental showpiece as they picked up just one point from their three games in 2021 and 2023 respectively.

Gibson got off the mark for Liberia with his leveller against Togo on Friday and the 16-year-old striker should start from the bench once again on Tuesday.

Peter Wilson, Terry Sackor and skipper Oscar Dorley should lead the Lone Stars' attack while Kemoh Kamara, Natus Jamel Swen and Viktoria Plzen man Sampson Dweh should form the three-man defence.

Mahrez failed to add to his 31 international goals against Equatorial Guinea on Thursday but the former Manchester City man should retain his role on the right side of the Algeria attack.

Baghdad Bounedjah, who is one goal shy of Mahrez's tally for the Greens, should join Said Benrahma in the three-man attack, while Auoar, Ismael Bennacer and Ramiz Zerrouki should team up in midfield.

At the defensive end of the pitch, we should see an unchanged back four of Aissa Mandi, Mohamed Tougai, Ramy Bensebaini and Jaouen Hadjam, with Anthony Mandrea starting in goal once again.


Liberia possible starting lineup:
Koulibaly; Kamara, Swen Dweh; Teclar, Sangare, Kenneh, Freeman; Wilson, Sackor, Dorley

Algeria possible starting lineup:
Mandrea; Mandi, Tougai, Bensebaini, Hadjam; Bennacer, Zerrouki, Aouar; Mahrez, Benrahma, Bounedjah


We say: Liberia 0-2 Algeria

Despite their home advantage, Liberia will need to be at their best against Algeria, who are unbeaten in their last six encounters. The Greens boast the firepower needed to get the job done and we are tipping them off to secure all three points at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex.
