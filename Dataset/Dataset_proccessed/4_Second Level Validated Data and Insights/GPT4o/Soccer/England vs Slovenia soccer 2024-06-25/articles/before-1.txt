The game will take place in Cologne, but ITV have based their matchday coverage in Berlin, outside the Brandenburg Gate. Pougatch had been in Stuttgart to watch Scotland's defeat to Hungary.

The presenter has been attempting to make his way back to the capital over the course of Monday afternoon. But he ran into serious difficulties, with his train delayed leaving Stuttgart, then being forced to stop recharge its battery and then eventually terminating early in Leipzig.

Pougatch opened up on his nightmare journey in a series of posts on Twitter. His first stated: "Train from Stuttgart to Berlin left 25 mins late, now we’re having a 20 min stop to recharge the battery. ‘So please get off and have a smoke.’ German ladies next to me have bought me an ice cream as we debate who has the worst rail system. We win that one, of course!"

Twenty-five minutes later, he added: "Battery still not charged. Train still somewhere. Ladies giving me water now. Journey beginning to have shades of Avanti/South West trains…"

After another 20 minutes, Pougatch wrote: "We are now terminating in Leipzig and have to find another train for Berlin. This is quite entertainingly shambolic in a very pleasant, polite Teutonic way but I will miss the ladies who are feeding and watering me like a lost ten year old."

HAVE YOUR SAY! What should be England's line-up against Slovenia? Comment below.

Pougatch ran into further problems at Leipzig station and eventually gave up on trying to get the train altogether. Instead, he decided to switch to a car to get him to Berlin, comparing his journey to Britain's own dreadful trains.

He concluded: "My new friends say the platform at Leipzig will be chaos because of the Fussball fans. We may be going rogue. Still have 27 hours till we’re on air for England. Even money we make it. Should’ve put GWR on roll call of shame!

"My new friends left me at Erfurt station & we’ve given up on the train at Leipzig. They’re sleek & comfortable but all the anecdotes this Euros say utterly unreliable! Not just us then… Autobahn it is to Berlin."

Boss Southgate is hopeful Pougatch will enjoy the game if he finally does make it to Berlin. England have endured a difficult opening two games so far, though are all but assured of a place in the knockouts.

"Whatever I say is fairly irrelevant, we have to do it on the pitch. We're all on the same page. The route forward was pretty simple to highlight and we have to go and deliver it. I'm expecting we do that tomorrow," he said.

"The mood is very good. We know the world we live in, there will always be external noise but it shouldn't affect us. What's important is the internal. The performance is what we're focussing on. The results have basically put us in the next round already and now we want to top the group."
