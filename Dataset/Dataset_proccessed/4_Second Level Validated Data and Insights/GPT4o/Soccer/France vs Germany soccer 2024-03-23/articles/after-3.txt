Toni Kroos returned and Florian Wirtz scored the fastest-ever Germany goal as the Euro 2024 hosts defeated France 2-0 in Lyon.

Kroos, coaxed out of international retirement for the upcoming European Championship, wasted no time with a precise pass for Wirtz, who let fly from outside the penalty area to score after seven seconds.

The German soccer federation said it was the quickest goal ever scored in a national team game. The previous best was nine seconds by Lukas Podolski in a 2013 win over Ecuador. That was the fastest in international football until Austria’s Christoph Baumgartner scored six seconds into a 2-0 friendly win over Slovakia earlier on Saturday.

Kai Havertz made it 2-0 after the break and Antonio Rüdiger produced a late goalline clearance as the smiles returned to the German national team and hopes were raised that they can excel on home ground at Euro 2024. France, in contrast, were whistled derisively by the home fans at full time.

It was Germany’s second consecutive victory over France, but only their third win in 11 games, giving Julian Nagelsmann a timely boost.

Stuttgart’s Maximilian Mittelstädt started at left-back on his debut and Bayer Leverkusen’s Robert Andrich also impressed in just his second cap. Germany showed bite and commitment as the visitors bossed the opening 20 minutes before Marcus Thuram fired the first France chance over. More followed. Marc-André ter Stegen denied the France captain, Kylian Mbappé, the best opportunity in a one-on-one as the Germans withstood the pressure for the rest of the half.

Kroos was again involved in the second goal, combining with Mittelstädt at the back before Wirtz sent the ball to Jamal Musiala, who rounded the goalkeeper and cut the ball back for Havertz to score in the 49th minute.

Ousmane Dembélé flashed a shot wide of the far post in response, but the French were unable to exert the same pressure and slipped to a tame defeat.
