        "Ahead of the team's quarterfinal against Switzerland in Dusseldorf on Saturday, proficiency from 12 yards out might be the least of Southgate's worries.",
        "Captain Harry Kane would be the first name on Southgate's list, and probably the first in the order, should 120 minutes prove insufficient to find a winner.",

        "Palmer, the young Chelsea playmaker, took 10 and scored all of them over the past season, his big breakout.",
        "Bellingham's poise, maturity and big-game mentality would make him another obvious choice.",
        "Bukayo Saka is a regular penalty taker with Arsenal, but did miss the final kick of the Euro 2020 final, his effort saved by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
