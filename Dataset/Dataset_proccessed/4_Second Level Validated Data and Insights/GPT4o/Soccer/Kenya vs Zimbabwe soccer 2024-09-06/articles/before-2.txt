Coach Firat explores injury alternatives as AFCON qualifier against Zimbabwe beckons
written by Rebeccah Maria September 3, 2024
In a spirited attempt to beat the clock ahead of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Zimbabwe, Harambee Stars Head Coach Engin Firat is leaving nothing to chance.

During an open media session held at the Police Sacco Stadium, Firat spoke candidly about the team’s readiness, injury concerns, and the overall competitiveness of their AFCON qualifying group.

He emphasized that while the initial matches will be crucial, the team’s ultimate success will be dependent on their performance throughout the entire campaign.

Harambee Stars are in intense preparation mode with the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers fast approaching.

The team, pooled in Group J alongside Cameroon, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, is bracing up for a crucial match against Zimbabwe on September 6th, 2024, at Stade Mandela National Stadium in Uganda.

This will be followed by a challenging encounter against Namibia in South Africa.

Collins Sichenje has been ruled out of the qualifier and so are Ayub Timbe and Masud Juma.

Stars Indefatigable hitman Michael Olunga is doubtful whilst Daniel Anyembe is away for personal reasons.

Olunga is scheduled to undergo an MRI scan to assess the severity of his injury.

–Fitness Concerns–

Firat expressed his frustration at not being able to field a full-strength squad, noting that several other players are also dealing with fitness issues.

In an effort to strengthen the squad, Firat revealed his intention to invite two players from England, Australia, and Ireland.

Firat nevertheless cited difficulties with Kenya’s passport and immigration procedures, stating, “It’s not easy in Kenya with the passports since I have experience and have no clue how it works.” This logistical challenge has hampered his efforts to bring in international talent that could potentially make a difference in the qualifiers.

Despite these hurdles, Firat remains optimistic about the upcoming fixtures. He expressed hope for a strong start in the qualifiers, stating, “The games are far and difficult, but if we have six points, it’ll be a good start. Even four points would be a positive outcome.”

When asked about selection of players from the Kenya Premier League (KPL), Firat mentioned that the league’s real performance level typically emerges after 5-6 weeks.

“The players are coming from preparations, and I have seen from them that they are still tired from it,” Firat noted, suggesting that many KPL players are still working their way to peak fitness.

“It’s not important what we will do in the first two matches but how many points we have at the last match,” Firat explained, using the metaphor of “poison” to describe the team’s intensity and focus.

“Especially in this group where the teams are close to each other and have strong squads.” he quipped.

Firat also highlighted the strength of their opponents, beginning with Zimbabwe. “Zimbabwe’s players are fit, and those who didn’t play previously are back. They have a new coach, so it’ll be tough,” he explained.

Namibia is equally daunting. “At AFCON in January, they beat Tunisia, and in the last AFCON qualifier, they took four points from Cameroon. So we are facing a strong team,” Firat added.

Namibia’s recent form and their ability to compete against top-tier African teams make them a force to be reckoned with.

–Omala’s Take–

Benson Omalla, one of the standout players in the squad, shared his thoughts on the team’s preparations.

“The preparations have been well, and it’ll be nice playing the first game and winning,” Omalla said, adding: “Every player wants to play at the highest level, and I take it seriously because I want to ply my trade at the top level.”

Omalla, who is eyeing his first AFCON experience, is determined to make his mark, confident that his dream of playing at the continent’s highest level will come true.

Antony Okumu, another key player, acknowledged the weight of the task ahead. “The games are heavy because we last played AFCON in 2019, and we must do our best in the group we’re playing,” Okumu said. He added that Kenya has a huge chance of qualifying this time, given the support and quality of the squad. “We have support and good players,” he concluded.

Adding to the team’s confidence is their recent track record against Zimbabwe. The Harambee Stars secured a 2-0 victory over Zimbabwe in the COSAFA Cup on July 2, 2024, following a decisive 3-0 win in a World Friendly International on March 26, 2024. These victories suggest that Kenya has what it takes to overcome Zimbabwe once again, provided they can field their best players
