DOHA - China got another goalless draw at the AFC Asian Cup after being held 0-0 with Lebanon in the second round of Group A here on Wednesday.


In the first round of the tournament, China had a 0-0 draw with Tajikistan, while Lebanon lost to host Qatar 3-0.

Both sides were desperately seeking a win to keep their chances of advancing to the knockout stage alive.

"We played against a tough team. We don't win the game, but we showed a good mentality, excellent attitude and put up a big fight. The road is still long. One more game to play, and target is the same to go through knockout stage," Chinese team head coach Aleksandar Jankovic said at post-match conference.

Jankovic, who admitted that his team were a little nervous in the opening match, made two changes in his familiar 5-3-2 starting lineup, with Tan Long, Wang Qiuming being replaced by Zhang Yuning and Xu Xin.

After the disappointing draw, China, with two points, will take on host Qatar in the third round next Monday, while Lebanon is set to play against Tajikistan at the same time

Both teams had a few chances in the match but missed them all. In the 45th minute, Zhang unleashed two consecutive strikes in the penalty area which were saved by Lebanese goalkeeper Ostafa Matar.

Lebanon was close to open scoring in the stoppage time of first half, but Hassan Maatouk's right footed shot from outside the box went off the crossbar in a counterattack.

The Lebanese side hit the woodwork again in the 52nd minute by Hasan Srour following a combination play with Bassel Jradi.


In the 65th minute, Wu Lei had the best opportunity of match but his close range shot was cleared before the goal line, after Dai Weijun crossed the ball into the goal area.

"We can see from the matches that Asian football has been improving. We played not badly today, we just need to score," Chinese goalkeeper Yan Junling noted.

Jankovic owed the two goalless matches to back luck. "We missed chances, and that's football. Sometimes you do everything to score, but you don't score," he said. "We did better controlling the better, to be brave, and we made some improvements to deal with stress. Today I have nothing to blame."

After the disappointing draw, China, with two points, will take on host Qatar in the third round next Monday, while Lebanon is set to play against Tajikistan at the same time.


China still has hope to qualify with at least a draw in the third round as six group winners and runners-up will advance to the knockout stage, along with the four best third-placed teams.

"We know that we depend on ourselves before the last group match. Despite our playing against the host team who is the defending champion with World Cup experience, we still depend on ourselves, and as a coach I always to be in this situation," Jankovic added.
