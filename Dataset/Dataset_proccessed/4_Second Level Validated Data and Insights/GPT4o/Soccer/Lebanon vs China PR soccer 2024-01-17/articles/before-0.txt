Both teams will be hoping to record their first win of the AFC Asian Cup 2023.

Lebanon and China will face each other in their next Group A fixture of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup on 17 January 2024. The sides need a win and must secure all three points to create a chance of making it into the knockout stages.

Lebanon fought bravely but eventually came up short against a strong Qatar side in a 3-0 defeat. On the other hand, China played a gritty goalless draw with Tajikistan and sit with just a point. As both teams are direct competitors for the second qualifying spot that offers direct qualification into the Round of 16, winning the upcoming game becomes essential for them.

Here is a look at what to expect from the AFC Asian Cup fixture between Lebanon and China from Group A in a high-stakes contest:

Kick-off

Wednesday, 17 January 2024, 5:00 PM IST (11:30 GMT) at the Al Thumama Stadium in Doha, Qatar.

Form 

Lebanon (all competitions): D-D-W-L-L

China (all competitions): L-W-L-L-D

Player to Watch

Hassan Maatouk did not have a lot of opportunities to score against Qatar but the situation will be different against China. The skipper had a shot on target and completed 80% of his passes against Qatar. If he receives good service from the rest of the team, then Lebanon’s fans can expect him to find the back of the net.

Yang Liu (China)
Yang Liu will be China’s driving force in this encounter.

Yang Liu gave a brilliant account of himself in the draw versus Tajikistan. The full-back dominated the left flank and won nine out of 12 duels in the match. He also made four interceptions and four clearances, emerging as China’s most influential player in the game. His influence will be vital if the side is to secure a win against Lebanon in the upcoming fixture.
