Lebanon vs China
K. Khamis

Lebanon defender Khalil Khamis escaped a straight red card after landing a kung fu kick on Chinese opponent in Asian Cup.

Lebanon's Khamis avoided red card after kung fu kick
Kicked China's Tsun in his face
Lebanon held China to a goalless draw
WHAT HAPPENED?

In the 23rd minute of the Asian Cup Group A fixture, Khamis accidentally kicked China's Dai Wai Tsun in his face while trying to clear a ball. While the Lebanese defender successfully hit the ball out of the park, in the follow-through, his left foot landed on Tsun's face. The Chinese players immediately demanded a punishment but to everyone's surprise, the referee decided to continue with the game without showing any card. Even a VAR check later did not find the Lebanon international guilty.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

The match eventually ended in a goalless draw which allowed group toppers and hosts Qatar to progress to the knockout stage with six points from their first two matches. China's future, on the other hand, now hangs in the balance after they failed to register a win in their first two group games.
