Lebanon and Tajikistan will square off in their final group match on Monday facing a similar situation as a win for the either side can take them to the last 16, should Qatar avoid defeat against China.

Yesterday, in front of a crowd of 14,137, both Lebanon and China saw several efforts being thwarted as well as missed despite displaying a determined approach right from the start.

However, Khalil Khamsi’s early header was collected safely by China goalkeeper Yan Junling while Hasan Maatouk’s shot hit the crossbar before going into the break.

At the other end, Lui Bin Bin’s effort was punched away by Lebanese custodian Mostafa Matar.

The second half saw both teams pushing for a breakthrough. China’s Zhang Linpeng forced a save from Lebanon’s goalkeeper, while Hasan Srour’s right-footed shot was denied by China’s Yan Junling.

In the 65th minute, China almost came close to breaking the deadlock, but Wu Lei’s close-range effort was cleared off the line by Lebanon’s defense.

Both sides made late substitutions in search of a decisive goal, but failed to do so, forcing the points to be shared at the end of the thrilling encounter.
Despite having to share the points, Lebanon coach Miodrag Radulovic remained positive.

“It’s a very important point for us especially after a tough defeat against Qatar,” Radulovic said. “We hit two posts, but unfortunately we didn’t score again. I’m satisfied with this point because we are still in the game to the end for the next round.”

His opposite number, China coach Aleksandar Jankovic is aware of the task ahead. He emphasized the importance of self-reliance, acknowledging the challenge posed by Qatar’s World Cup experience when they take on the hosts next Monday.

“We know that we depend on ourselves and that is something that every team would like to be in that position before the last game. So we depend on ourselves. No matter if we play against a host country... Qatar with their World Cup experience, we still depend on ourselves and I always like to be in this kind of situation,” Jankovic said.
