        "Lebanon coach Miodrag Radulovic remained positive, stating, 'It\u2019s a very important point for us especially after a tough defeat against Qatar. We hit two posts, but unfortunately we didn\u2019t score again. I\u2019m satisfied with this point because we are still in the game to the end for the next round.'",
        "China coach Aleksandar Jankovic emphasized the importance of self-reliance, acknowledging the challenge posed by Qatar\u2019s World Cup experience when they take on the hosts next Monday. He said, 'We know that we depend on ourselves and that is something that every team would like to be in that position before the last game. So we depend on ourselves. No matter if we play against a host country... Qatar with their World Cup experience, we still depend on ourselves and I always like to be in this kind of situation.'"
