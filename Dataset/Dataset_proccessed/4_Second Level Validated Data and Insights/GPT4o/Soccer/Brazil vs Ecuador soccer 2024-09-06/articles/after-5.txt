Brazil player ratings vs Ecuador: Brilliant Rodrygo lifts bleak Selecao to crucial World Cup Qualifying victory

Brazil vs Ecuador

The Real Madrid forward's stunning long-range strike was the difference as the Selecao earned a crucial three points on the road to 2026

Rodrygo came to the rescue as Brazil defeated Ecuador 1-0 in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying on Friday. The Selecao were tested heavily by Moises Caicedo and La Tricolor, but the Real Madrid star's incredible first-half goal made all the difference.

Rodrygo's opener, and ultimately the winner, arrived in the 30th minute off a Lucas Paqueta assist. The winger received the ball on his left foot, switched to his right, and fired a 20-yard strike past the goalkeeper and into the back of the net.

After a disappointing showing at Copa America 2024, where Brazil exited in the quarter-finals, Dorival Junior's side bounced back with a win in front of their home fans. Ecuador didn’t make it easy for the home side, though. The visitors’ best chance came in first-half stoppage time when Chelsea midfielder Caicedo found himself one-v-one with Alisson Becker. However, the Liverpool shot-stopper came up big with a massive save to deny him.

With the three points, Brazil leapfrog Ecuador and Venezuela from seventh to fourth place, and after seven matches in the 2026 cycle, they now sit on 10 points. They return to the pitch on Tuesday as they look to secure six points from two matches, with Paraguay hosting the Selecao.

Goalkeeper & Defence

Alisson (8/10):

Brilliant save in first half, the difference between one and three points.

Danilo (8/10):

Was slinging the ball on a platter all evening, with some sensational cross-field switches and crosses. Won 100 percent of his aerial duels, as well.

Marquinhos (6/10):

A veteran performance. He didn't stand out by any means, but was composed when called upon.

Gabriel Magalhaes (8/10):

Outstanding in and around the box, including a goal-line clearance in the first half. Really impressive.

Guilherme Arana (6/10):

Didn't link with the attack much, but was defensively sound and a reliable outlet when passing out of the back.

Midfield

Andre (7/10):

A surprise start for the new Wolves signing, he impressed in place of Joao Gomes. He challenged Caicedo all night long and held a feisty Paez quiet in the second half

Bruno Guimaraes (6/10):

Really struggled learning a new midfield partner in Andre, and didn't look too comfortable next to him. Not his best day. Subbed off midway through second half.

Lucas Paqueta (7/10):

Cheeky assist on Rodrygo's goal. Was firing passes all night. Top performance.

Attack

Rodrygo (8/10):

Lovely footwork to create the opener, was a threat in and around the box all night. A lively performance.

Vinicius Junior (6/10):

A really quiet night for the Madrid star. Couldn't get anything going, looked rather uncomfortable all evening.

Luiz Henrique (5/10):

Struggled to notice he was on the pitch. Failed to make anything of the opportunity handed to him.

Subs & Manager

Estevao Willian (6/10):

The Chelsea-bound teenager made his international debut off the bench in the 62nd minute, completing 12 of 12 passes. Was quietly composed and looked the part, too.

Gerson (6/10):

Replaced Guimaraes in the 62nd minute, put in a solid shift off the bench.

Lucas Moura (N/A):

Introduced with 15 minutes to go. Replaced Paqueta.

Wendell (N/A):

Replaced Arana late, a like-for-like change.

Joao Gomes (N/A):

Subbed on for Andre with minutes to spare.

Dorival Junior (6/10):

It wasn't a blistering performance from the Selecao, but they earned three points, and in the grand scheme of things, that's all that mattered. The defence was rock-solid, but the midfield lacked a sense of unity, struggling to connect with the front-three. Dorival should be ecstatic to claim victory, but he should know it was nowhere near their best.
