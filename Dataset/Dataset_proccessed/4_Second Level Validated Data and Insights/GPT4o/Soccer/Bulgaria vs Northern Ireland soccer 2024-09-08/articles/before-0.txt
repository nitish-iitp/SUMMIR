Michael O'Neill's young Northern Ireland squad head to Bulgaria for their second Nations League Group C3 game of the new campaign.

The last year or so has felt like a changing of the guard, with some experienced heads, including Jonny Evans and Steven Davis, calling time on their international careers, but some of the talent coming through suggests the future can be bright.

Putting right an awful Nations League record, with just one win in 16 games in the competition before this international break, will be a key priority for Northern Ireland this autumn, with six fixtures to be played before the end of 2024.

Watch Bulgaria v Northern Ireland on ITVX

Alongside Bulgaria, Thursday's opponents Luxembourg and Belarus join O'Neill's side in Group C3 – with a top-two finish needed to have a chance of winning promotion up to Nations League B.

Sunday's hosts may be eight places lower than Northern Ireland in the FIFA Rankings, but they have making progress since the appointment of manager Ilian Iliev last year, and will have promotion aspirations of their own.
