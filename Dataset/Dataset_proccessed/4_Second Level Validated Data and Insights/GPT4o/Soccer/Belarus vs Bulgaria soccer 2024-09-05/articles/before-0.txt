Belarus vs Bulgaria Predictions
Can Defensive Struggles Lead to an Entertaining Clash in the Nations League?
Belarus have conceded an average of 1.4 goals per game in their last 10 international matches.
Bulgaria have drawn five of their last six games but failed to keep a clean sheet in any of them.
Max Ebong is Belarus’s top scorer in their squad with five international goals, while Bulgaria’s Kiril Despodov leads with 14 goals.
Best Bet


Draw and Both Teams to Score @ 10/3




BET HERE


Reasoning
A draw with both teams scoring seems likely. Everton's attack, led by Beto, is strong, but defensive frailties persist. Southampton could exploit this despite their own scoring struggles.
Odds subject to change

Belarus and Bulgaria will square off at the neutral ZTE Arena in Hungary, opening their respective 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaigns. Both nations aim to make a strong start in League C Group 3, where they will battle with Northern Ireland and Luxembourg. As each team seeks to establish themselves early in the group, this fixture promises to be an intriguing contest.

The first prediction for this match focuses on both teams finding the back of the net. The data supports this as the best bet, given several key statistics surrounding both teams’ performances.

Belarus and Bulgaria have struggled defensively in recent times, and both sides have demonstrated vulnerabilities that make it likely we’ll see goals from either camp. Belarus have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last four international fixtures, shipping four goals in two of those matches. While their attack hasn’t been prolific, the presence of players like Max Ebong and Dmitri Antilevski, who have been among their top scorers in recent competitions, suggests they are capable of capitalising on Bulgaria’s shaky defence.

On the other hand, Bulgaria’s defensive fragility has been exposed throughout their recent fixtures. Although they’ve managed to hold their own in some matches, their record of conceding 14 goals in eight Euro 2024 qualification matches speaks volumes. Ilian Iliev’s side also failed to keep a clean sheet in their last six matches, highlighting the challenges they face in containing opposition attacks. With Belarus aiming to bounce back from recent defeats, they are likely to exploit Bulgaria’s defensive lapses.

In terms of attacking potency, Bulgaria have Kiril Despodov, who has 14 international goals to his name, and the Minchev brothers, both of whom have shown a knack for creating chances. Given Belarus’s inconsistency at the back, there is a strong case to be made for Bulgaria finding the net as well.

The match-up between two teams that are not known for their defensive solidity makes this a clear candidate for both teams to score. As BettingTips4You.com expert Wolfgang Shotten summarises: “Given the weaknesses in both defences and the potential for individual brilliance in attack, a scenario where both teams score is highly likely.”

The attacking data from both sides supports this bet. Belarus average 0.9 goals per game from their last 10 matches, with Bulgaria matching that statistic. Meanwhile, both teams have created enough big chances per game (1.5 for Belarus and Bulgaria) to suggest that finishing opportunities will present themselves. Moreover, Bulgaria’s average of 10.5 shots per game indicates they will pressure Belarus’s defence throughout the match, which in turn boosts the likelihood of both teams scoring.

Correct Score Prediction: Belarus 1-2 Bulgaria

The best bet of both teams scoring ties in well with the prediction of a narrow 2-1 win for Bulgaria. While both sides are expected to find the back of the net, Bulgaria’s slight edge in attacking form gives them the advantage. Although Belarus have managed to keep a clean sheet only four times in their last 10 matches, their attacking unit has shown enough quality to grab at least a goal in this fixture.

Bulgaria, while vulnerable at the back, have performed solidly under Iliev’s management, remaining unbeaten in six of their last matches. Their ability to grind out results, even if by narrow margins, suggests they may have just enough firepower to edge Belarus. The presence of goal-scoring threats like Despodov, combined with Bulgaria’s recent resilience in drawing matches against tough opponents, points towards a 2-1 victory.

Belarus’s struggles in defence, as seen in their heavy defeats to Russia and Israel, make them vulnerable to Bulgaria’s attacking options, and this is why a 2-1 scoreline seems appropriate. Additionally, Bulgaria’s form shows they are capable of snatching a win despite not being the most prolific side, further justifying this prediction.
