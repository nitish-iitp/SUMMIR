        "Hungary and Switzerland face-off in Group A on Saturday afternoon for their first games of the 2024 European Championships.",
        "This is only the second time these two nations are meeting in the finals of a major tournament. The last time was at the World Cup in 1938, in which Hungary won 2-0.",
        "Switzerland are favoured to come out on top in this match at 5/4 odds.",
        "The Swiss nation have won six of their last nine games against Hungary, not losing to Hungary since 1998.",
        "This game has seen a fair few goals in their last few meetings, with Switzerland beating Hungary 3-2 and 5-2 in the World Cup qualifiers in 2016 and 2017 respectively.",
        "The Swiss have gone unbeaten in their last four games, drawing twice and winning another two.",
        "Granit Xhaka is still a key part of Switzerland's midfield and should play a leading role in this tournament.",
        "Xhaka played 33 games in the season just gone for Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen and alongside former Premier League player Xherdan Shaqiri, should give them some hope in reaching the knockouts at least."
