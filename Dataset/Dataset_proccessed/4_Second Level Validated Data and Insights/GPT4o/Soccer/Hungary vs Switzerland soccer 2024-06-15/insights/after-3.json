        "An impressive, deserved victory for Switzerland in Cologne. They had a 20-minute wobble when Barnabas Varga made it 2-1, but overall they were much the better team. Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer scored their first international goals during a dominant first-half performance, and the substitute Breel Embolo \u2013 who barely kicked a ball for Monaco last season because of injury \u2013 settled matters in added time."
