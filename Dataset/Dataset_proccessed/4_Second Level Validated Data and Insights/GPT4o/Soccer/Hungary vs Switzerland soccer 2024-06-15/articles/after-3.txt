“Hungary aren’t quite as shockingly poor as Turkey were at the last Euros,” says Kári Tulinius, “but this may be another case of a tournament dark horse stumbling out of the gate.”

Full time: Hungary 1-3 Switzerland

An impressive, deserved victory for Switzerland in Cologne. They had a 20-minute wobble when Barnabas Varga made it 2-1, but overall they were much the better team. Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer scored their first international goals during a dominant first-half performance, and the substitute Breel Embolo – who barely kicked a ball for Monaco last season because of injury – settled matters in added time.

90+6 min Switzerland break again, four on two I think, and Embolo’s low cross just evades Amdouni in front of goal.

90+4 min Embolo had some kind of strapping that came off as he chested the ball down. He didn’t even notice; in fact he still hasn’t because he hasn’t retrieved it.

10.52 EDT

A beautiful moment for Breel Embolo, who has barely kicked a ball in the last 12 months. Yann Sommer’s long kick was peculiarly headed across the face of his own area by Orban. Embolo chested the ball down, calmly lobbed it over the outrushing Gulacsi and set off on a cathartic celebration.

90+1 min Embolo leads a three-on-three break and plays in Rieder. He goes round the outrushing Gulacsi but goes too wide and his eventual cross-shot is booted off the line. It wasn’t going in anyway.

90 min: Good save by Gulacsi! Rieder’s inswinging corner from the right is met ahead of the near post by Xhaka, whose header deflects off Szoboszlai and is clawed away by Gulacsi. That’s an excellent reaction save.

82 min “Optimistic from Simon McMahon, I fear,” says James Humphries. “My bet is that Switzerland give us another shoeing on Wednesday and then Hungary, having lost to Germany in the interim, come out absolutely desperate for a win and third place. In short: we’re effed, and I don’t know what else I expected.”

It’s the hope that kills!

81 min Adam’s dangerous cross is headed away crucially by the diving Rodriguez. Moments later he heads away again after Sallai nutmegs a defender and crosses from the left. It’s all Hungary.

GOAL! Hungary 1-2 Switzerland (Varga 66)

Hungary are back in it! Barnabas Varga, who missed that great chance a moment ago, has stooped to head Szoboszlai’s inswinging cross past Sommer from close range. It was a good finish – he got round the back of Aebischer at the far post, fell forward to meet the ball and brushed a header past Sommer.

65 min “Ok, this is good for Scotland,” says Simon McMahon, high-fiving a confused granny in the deli aisle. “We play Switzerland next, who will be very confident, perhaps over confident, and probably happy with a point after winning their first game. Germany will surely beat Hungary, meaning that victory for Scotland in their final group game against the Magyars will almost certainly guarantee qualification. A tried and tested formula that has worked in the past for Scotland against Yugoslavia in 1974, Holland in 1978, the Soviet Union in 1982, Uruguay in 1986, Brazil in 1990, Switzerland in 1996, Morocco in 1998, Croatia in 2021.”

63 min: Great chance for Hungary! That one would have counted. Sallai, on the left, curled a beautiful cross onto the head of Varga, unmarked eight yards out. He powered a header back across goal and just wide of the post. Sommer didn’t move.

62 min Varga scampers through one on one and curls wastefully over the bar. The flag went up for offside, although it was tight. Varga probably fouled Rodriguez anyway, so any goal would have disallowed one way or another.

Half time: Hungary 0-2 Switzerland

That was very impressive from Switzerland, who outplayed Hungary throughout and scored two classy goals. Michel Aesbischer made a first international goal for Kwadwo Duah, then scored his first for Switzerland on the stroke of half-time. It’s a long way back for Hungary.

It’s Aebischer’s first international goal, and he took it beautifully. He received a square pass on the edge of the D, used the overlapping Rodriguez by not using him and whipped a right-footed curler into the bottom corner. That’s a lovely finish.

43 min The only negative for Switzerland is that, for a team who have been so dominant, they haven’t created too many chances. Poor though they have been, Hungary will still be in the game if it’s 1-0 at half-time.
