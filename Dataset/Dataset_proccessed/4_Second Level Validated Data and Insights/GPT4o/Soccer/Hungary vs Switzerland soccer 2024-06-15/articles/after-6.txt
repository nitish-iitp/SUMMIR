EURO 2024
HUNGARY 1-3 SWITZERLAND: BREEL EMBOLO SCORES ON EMOTIONAL RETURN TO NATIONAL TEAM AS SWITZERLAND BEAT HUNGARY
BYWILL EVANS

UPDATED 15/06/2024 AT 20:58 GMT

Breel Embolo had not played for the Switzerland national team since the 2022 Qatar World Cup but he made an emotional return coming off the bench in his country’s opening Euro 2024 game, scoring the final goal in a 3-1 win over Hungary. The strike came after Hungary had peppered Switzerland, desperately trying to find an equaliser in the second half until Embolo's late intervention.

Switzerland’s dominant first-half display helped earn them a 3-1 victory over Hungary in Group A at Euro 2024.
In just his second appearance for his country, Kwadwo Duah opened the scoring after a brilliantly timed run allowed him to latch on to Michel Aebischer’s through ball and beat Peter Gulacsi.

Switzerland continued to push for a second and were rewarded just before half-time with Aebischer's beautiful curling effort landing in the bottom right-hand corner.

SZOBOSZLAI PANENKA EARNS HUNGARY LAST-GASP DRAW AGAINST GERMANY

19/11/2024 AT 22:36

Hungary came out fighting after the break and got themselves back into it when a cross from captain Dominik Szoboszlai found the head of Barnabas Varga.
The Hungarians pressed for a leveller, but failed to find one and Breel Embolo sealed the win for Switzerland with a lifted finish over Gulacsi in stoppage time.
The win puts Switzerland level on points with hosts Germany in Group A, with Hungary and Scotland propping up the standings.
TALKING POINT - ARE HUNGARY FEELING THE PRESSURE?
Heading into the tournament Hungary were fancied by many as being one of the dark horses given their impressive unbeaten run in qualifying, but they looked off the pace against Switzerland.
They struggled to create chances in the first half and while they were much improved in the second period, but they made mistakes and were punished.
Their next game is against the hosts Germany and it will be a huge ask for them to get anything out of it.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH – MICHEL AEBISCHER (SWITZERLAND)
There were several good Swiss players on the pitch and their experience showed, but Aebischer's display in the first half was incredible.
He created several chances from midfield, assisting Duah for the first goal and then expertly finishing from 23 yards out for the second.
If Scotland are to have any chance of beating Switzerland next week, they will need to deal with him.
PLAYER RATINGS
Hungary: Gulacsi 5; Lang 4, Orban 5, Szalai 5; Fiola 4, Nagy 5, Schafer 4, Kerkez 4; Sallai 6, Szoboszlai 7; Varga 7.
Switzerland: Sommer 7; Schar 7, Akanji 6, Rodriguez 6; Widmer 7, Xhaka 8, Freuler 7, Ndoye 7; Aebischer 9, Vargas 7; Duah 8.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
12 - GOAL! HUNGARY 0-1 SWITZERLAND (DUAH) - Duah's perfectly timed run allowed him to latch on to a through ball from Aebischer and slot past Gulacsi.
44 - GOAL! HUNGARY 0-2 SWITZERLAND (AEBISCHER) - Aebischer was looking for a pass on the edge of the box but decided to go it alone and beautifully curled the ball past Gulacsi .
66 - GOAL! HUNGARY 1-2 SWITZERLAND (VARGA) - A cross from captain Szoboszlai finds Varga who gets ahead of his man and heads home from a couple of yards out.
90+3 - GOAL! HUNGARY 1-3 SWITZERLAND (EMBOLO) - A terrible header from Fiola fell straight to Embolo who volleyed the ball over Gulacsi's head.
