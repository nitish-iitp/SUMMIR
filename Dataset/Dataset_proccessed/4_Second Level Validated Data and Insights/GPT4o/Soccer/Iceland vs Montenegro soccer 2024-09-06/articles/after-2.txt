Iceland head into an encounter against Montenegro this coming Friday. Played out at Laugardalsvoellur, this is their first of six outings in the UEFA Nations League group phase. The last time these two sides facing off here came up against each other, Montenegro came away with a 2-1 win. They have a similar outcome in mind at Laugardalsvoellur, but face stern opposition, of course.

While Iceland join this game this coming Friday as number 71 in the FIFA world ranking, visitors Montenegro are number 73.

Iceland have a tough match on hand, as they welcome Montenegro at Laugardalsvoellur. They are favoured by the bookmakers for the win, but this could be a tight match decided by small margins.

Iceland scored an average of 1.6 goals in four matches or a total of six while allowing six goals against. This is an average of 1.6 goals against per match with zero clean sheets along the way.

Montenegro travel to their next UEFA Nations League match, averaging a lowly one goals per game in their last six matches. They scored a disappointing total of six goals, while also conceding six goals. That amounts to an average of one per game, in which they kept their opponents from scoring two times.

Iceland vs Montenegro Prediction
Iceland Form

Showing inconsistent form, Iceland lost two of their past three matches, going down 2-1 against Ukraine, before beating England 0-1. The joy was short-lived, as Netherlands proved too strong in a 4-0 defeat. Iceland managed a strong return of four wins from their previous six internationals, where they also drew zero and lost two. They scored nine goals and conceded seven times.

Montenegro Form

In their last three matches, Montenegro won 1-0 win against North Macedonia, lost 2-0 against Belgium and lost 1-3 against Georgia. Montenegro managed a decent return of three wins in their last six internationals, in which they scored seven while also conceding eight times. They also experienced zero draws and three defeats.

This particular encounter between Iceland and Montenegro looks a little trickier for the favourites, than prices with the bookmakers suggest. All things considered, though, we still believe, the home side has enough about them to pull off a win on Friday.

Iceland vs Montenegro Betting Tips

Having scored just once lately for his country, Arnor Ingvi Traustason will be eager to hit the target again, and the upcoming game presents an opportunity to step up.
