Iceland vs Montenegro Predictions
Can Iceland’s Defence Seal a Tight Win in Reykjavik?
Iceland have kept clean sheets in 50% of their last six competitive matches.
Montenegro have failed to score in three of their last six games.
Seven of Iceland’s last ten home fixtures have featured under 2.5 goals.
Best Bet


Draw/Juventus – Half Time/Full Time @ 19/5




BET HERE


Reasoning
Backing the Draw/Juventus Half Time/Full Time market is a solid bet. Juventus' strong defence and PSV's European away struggles suggest a cautious first half, with Juventus capitalising in the second.
Odds subject to change

As Iceland prepare to host Montenegro in their opening fixture of the UEFA Nations League 2024-25, both teams will be keen to begin with a positive result. Iceland, under the management of Age Hareide, will look to improve on their previous campaign in League B, where they finished second in their group. Montenegro, on the other hand, are still trying to find their footing at this level, having finished third in their group last time out. With both sides aiming for an upward trajectory, this contest promises to be fiercely contested, even if the goals may be in short supply.

The best value bet for this fixture is Iceland to win and under 2.5 goals, primarily due to the recent form of both teams and the playing styles they are expected to deploy. Iceland’s pragmatic approach, particularly at home, has often led to tight games with few goals. They have only conceded 1.6 goals per game in their last 12 competitive matches, showing that they can hold their own defensively. Although they suffered a heavy defeat to the Netherlands in a recent friendly, their ability to control matches against similarly ranked teams has been notable, especially with their organised defence. In fact, they have managed three clean sheets in their last six competitive outings.

Montenegro, despite having some quality in their attacking ranks, have struggled to consistently find the net. They only managed 1.1 goals per game in their Euro 2024 qualification campaign, highlighting their inefficiency in front of goal. Furthermore, their reliance on key players like Stevan Jovetic and Stefan Mugosa means that when these individuals do not perform, the team’s attacking threat diminishes considerably.

The under 2.5 goals prediction is supported by the fact that both Iceland and Montenegro have shown a pattern of low-scoring games. Seven of Iceland’s last ten home games have finished with fewer than three goals, and Montenegro’s away matches have similarly seen under 2.5 goals in six of their last ten encounters. These statistics strongly point towards a defensive battle where Iceland’s ability to eke out narrow victories could make the difference.

“Iceland’s defensive structure and Montenegro’s struggles in front of goal make this match likely to be a low-scoring affair, with Iceland being the more probable winners,” BettingTips4You.com expert Robin Bylund.

Iceland’s ability to frustrate stronger teams, such as their 1-0 win over England earlier this year, demonstrates their capacity to grind out results. With a compact midfield, featuring experienced players like Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson, they are well-equipped to limit Montenegro’s attacking opportunities. Andri Gudjohnsen is expected to lead the line for Iceland, and while goalscoring has not been his strongest suit, he can provide the focal point for Iceland’s play in the final third. His presence, along with the disciplined Icelandic defence, should give the hosts a narrow advantage.

Correct Score Prediction: Iceland 1-0 Montenegro

Eligibility & payment exclusions apply. T&Cs apply.

Given the analysis above, the most likely correct score prediction is a 1-0 victory for Iceland. Iceland’s defence, which has been relatively solid in recent games, should be able to hold Montenegro at bay, while Montenegro’s attack has struggled to break down organised defences in similar situations. Iceland’s home advantage and their ability to keep matches tight suggest that a single goal could be enough to secure the win.

Montenegro’s defensive stats also back up this prediction, with the team conceding just 1.4 goals per game in their recent qualifying campaign. While they have the ability to stay in games, their lack of firepower upfront makes it difficult to see them scoring in Reykjavik. A narrow 1-0 scoreline reflects both Iceland’s slight superiority and the likelihood of a low-scoring affair.
