Croatia Analysis: Only lost 3 games of their last 10

When Croatia faced Spain, all of their worst concerns came true as Spain’s ability and pace overwhelmed Croatia en route to three goals in the first half. Around the 29-minute mark, they scored twice in three minutes, ending Croatia’s attempt to prove they were a team not meant to play from behind. As one of the stronger third seeds, Croatia’s hopes of making it to the knockout phase are hampered by their goal differential absorbing a -3 setback in the opening game. Croatia has never won a game in the European knockout stages, and this year is probably not going to be any different. As a result, they are unable to duplicate their World Cup glory.

 

Albania Analysis: Coming off a 2-1 loss

Nedim Bajrami’s goal against Italy 23 seconds into the competition opened gave Albania’s Euro bid the perfect start. Italy leveled the score at the 34-minute point and then seized the lead, however their lead only lasted 11 minutes. Albania’s goal in their opening Group of Death match was the fastest in European history, and their one-goal defeat wasn’t a bad outcome. Albania might be in position for an improbable run to the group stage if they upset Croatia. When Albania plays patiently till the very end, they are a more formidable squad. Albania loses their cool in games when they trail, but Croatia’s poor goal scoring record will allow them to play the style they want.
