France and Canada played out a 0-0 draw in a friendly on Sunday as the two nations concluded their preparations for Euro 2024 and the Copa America.

France threatened to take the lead in the first half but efforts by N'Golo Kante and Marcus Thuram were denied by fine saves from goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.

The stalemate continued in the second half, with both sides creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.

France star Kylian Mbappé came off the bench in the 74th minute. The new Real Madrid forward was close to score in the last play of the match, but Crepeau prevented him from making it 1-0.

It was France forward and record scorer Olivier Giroud's last appearance on home soil after announcing his international retirement following the European Championship, and he received a standing ovation at the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux.

"We were up against some good opposition with a lot of intensity, and we had a few good chances in the first half. After that it was more difficult," said manager Didier Deschamps.

France, who comfortably beat Luxembourg 3-0 on Wednesday, are among the favourites to win the European title with the tournament kicking off in Germany on Friday.

"It's not ideal but it was important for me to spread the play around and get everyone involved in these two friendly games. It wasn't easy today, and we're going to make the most of it in terms of what awaits us on June 17," Deschamps added.

France face Austria in their tournament opener before taking on the Netherlands on June 21 and Poland four days later. Canada, under new coach Jesse Marsch, will kick off the Copa America against Lionel Messi's Argentina on June 20, before facing Peru five days later and Chile on June 29.
