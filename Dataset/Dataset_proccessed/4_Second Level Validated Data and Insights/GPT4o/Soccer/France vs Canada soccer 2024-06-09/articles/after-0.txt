France 0 Canada 0: How did Mbappe look? Positives for Marsch; stodgy France – The Briefing
By Tim Spiers and Joshua Kloke

Friendlies mean nothing, right? Well, France will certainly hope so after they failed to impress against a well-organised Canada.

Didier Deschamps’ side were packed with talent (including second-half substitute Kylian Mbappe) but were blunted by a team who had been beaten 4-0 by the Netherlands just days earlier in Jesse Marsch’s first game in charge.

That heavy defeat in Rotterdam featured a reasonable first-half display from Canada but in Bordeaux, they were much more accomplished.

And despite the bland 0-0 draw, there was some good news for France (and neutrals): Mbappe came on and looks ready for their Euro 2024 opener against Austria on June 17.

France now head off to Germany, while Marsch’s Canada continue preparations for Copa America.

Here, The Athletic’s Tim Spiers and Joshua Kloke break down the action.

Why did France struggle to build through midfield?

Even with Mbappe on the bench, there was giddy anticipation in the sell-out 42,000 crowd for France’s first match in Bordeaux since 2015.

After all, against a Canada side who had just been walloped 4-0 by the Dutch, surely a front four of Antoine Griezmann, Marcus Thuram, Ousmane Dembele and Olivier Giroud, the latter playing a home international for France for the final time, would run riot and send the team to Germany in a blaze of goal-based euphoria?

Well, in the first half, aside from a spurt of early chances when France looked to exploit space in behind Alphonso Davies on Canada’s left side, France were laboured and the initially excitable crowd were soon reduced to Mexican waves to entertain themselves.

N’Golo Kante and Eduardo Camavinga anchored the midfield, with Griezmann drifting deep and looking to pick the lock ahead of them but it was Canada who looked the more composed in midfield, enjoying more possession than France, who looked top-heavy.

What positives were there for Marsch?

Marsch’s first friendly in charge of Canada presented a tale of two halves: against the Netherlands, Canada looked dynamic and aggressive in the first half but deflated in the second and ran out of steam.

But against France, Canada’s press was not nearly as uncompromising. They slowed things down and looked intelligent in their movement. As a result, Marsch’s side were far more organized and looked capable of holding their own against France for longer spells into the second half.

Canada deserve credit for shutting down France but also testing them with their limited chances. This performance and result should build confidence in the Canadian camp for Copa America.

There were questions about whether Marsch was a single-tooled manager who would be able to get his team to press and press alone. The fact Marsch got his players to shift their approach suggests Canada could be capable of showing different looks against different sides. Could Canada press aggressively to catch out Argentina and then back off and try to own possession against Chile?

Some of Canada’s best players against the Netherlands had strong showings again: Derek Cornelius and Ismael Kone in particular helped dictate the pace of play in a more composed manner for Canada. After flirting with a role for Canada for years, Cornelius will be relied upon by Marsch from here on in: of Canada’s players, he made the most passes into the final third (nine).

How did Mbappe look?

France’s ponderous build-up play gave way to a more direct approach in the second half, with a plethora of crosses and corners testing the Canada defence, who to their credit held firm.

France were missing that one magical touch in front of goal and there was only one man for the job.

Mbappe, kept on the bench because of a problem with his knee, warmed up on the touchline and waved to the stands — the young crowd screamed like he was Justin Bieber (or another pop star that young people like).

Finally, in the 74th minute, he arrived to a hero’s reception. The stage was set.

Except, well, France’s all-round play was still so mundane that Mbappe’s first touch wasn’t until six minutes later and that was to play a drop ball back to Canada’s ‘keeper after a stoppage.

Real Madrid’s latest superstar had seen enough. He came deep inside his own half, skipped past one player and dashed 40 yards upfield. Both knees appeared to work just fine.
Thereafter he was busy and breezy, looking to play one-twos and lift France’s tempo.

Could he find a late winner? No, the closest he came was a 20-yard curler that sailed over the bar. He ruefully shook his head, summing up an underwhelming night for France.

And then, in the dying seconds of stoppage time, there he went, full Mbappe boss mode, haring towards the box, slaloming inside and out of two defenders… but shooting too close to the goalkeeper.

Does Canada have a goaltending decision to make?

It was always the plan for Marsch to split starts between Dayne St Clair and Maxime Crepeau in Canada’s two friendlies this week.

St Clair did well against the Netherlands, keeping Canada in the match with his shot-stopping and athleticism as the players in front of him tired. His start was a surprise, though, considering Crepeau’s experience.

Against France, Crepeau showed what that know-how looked like. He shut out the World Cup finalists — how many Canadian goalkeepers can put that on their CV? Not only was Crepeau’s positioning against a hungry French side in the first half excellent, but he also played far higher up the pitch to aid Canada’s press. Crepeau’s distribution helped put Canada’s midfielders in good spots.

It’s going to be a debate moving forward: St Clair’s superior shot-stopping and aggression versus the more composed and cerebral Crepeau?

But after none of France’s shots on target made it past Crepeau, he might have put himself in the driver’s seat for the starter’s spot for Copa America. And deservedly so.
