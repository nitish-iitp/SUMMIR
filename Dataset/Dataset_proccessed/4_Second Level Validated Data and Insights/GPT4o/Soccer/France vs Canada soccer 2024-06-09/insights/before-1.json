        "Concluding their preparations for Euro 2024, France take on Canada at the Stade Matmut Atlantique in Sunday evening's international friendly.",
        "Didier Deschamps's men ran out convincing 3-0 victors over Luxembourg in their first fixture of the month, while their visitors were crushed 4-0 by the Netherlands on Thursday evening.",
        "Neither of France's opening two results of 2024 - a 2-0 loss to Germany and nervy 3-2 win over Chile - would have raised hopes of ending their agonising wait for Euros glory this summer, but Deschamps's charges were as dominant as expected in Wednesday's battle against Luxembourg.",
        "By registering helpers for Kolo Muani and Clauss's efforts, Mbappe took his assists tally for the national team to a staggering 27 - a number that not even Zinedine Zidane nor Thierry Henry could manage - helping to reignite belief that France are one of the undisputed favourites for Euro 2024 glory.",
        "Before Les Bleus can begin to dream of continental stardom, challenging group fixtures with the Netherlands, an in-form Austria and 2022 World Cup foes Poland must be navigated this month, but a third-straight friendly victory is the next item on Deschamps's agenda.",
        "The aforementioned 2-0 loss to Germany represents the only loss that France have been subjected to in their last nine home battles, as each of the other eight have ended in victory, including their record-breaking 14-0 annihilation of Gibraltar in Euro 2024 qualifying.",
        "Sunday's battle will see Canada pit their wits against the second of three Euro 2024 Group D teams, having tested their mettle against the Dutch on Thursday evening, but Jesse Marsch's men were no match for their counterparts in orange.",
        "Obtaining his first victory at the helm at the second time of asking this Sunday will be another tall order for Marsch, whose side are also gearing up for their own continental championships, taking part in their final friendly before the Copa America begins.",
        "First and foremost, attention turns to just a second-ever meeting with France, whom they faced in their first-ever World Cup match in the 1986 edition, but a solitary Jean-Pierre Papin strike was enough to propel Les Bleus to a 1-0 win on that occasion."
