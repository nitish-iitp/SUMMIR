India vs Kuwait Football Live Streaming: India take ON Kuwait in Sunil Chhetri’s last match for the national team. (AIFF)

India vs Kuwait, Sunil Chhetri retirement match Live Streaming Details: India’s talismanic striker Sunil Chhetri will hang up his boots for the national side after the FIFA World Cup qualifier match against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

A win would put India in a comfortable position to advance to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers and will be a fitting farewell to the legend who has scored 94 goals for the Blue Tigers in 150 appearances.

It’s almost poetic that Chhetri plays his final match in a city that had shaped his career since his days as a Mohun Bagan player back in 2002-05 and then again in 2011-12. He has even played for Bagan’s arch-rivals East Bengal for a year in between. The venue is a lucky one as well with the Indian team not having lost in the Salt Lake Stadium since August 2006.
