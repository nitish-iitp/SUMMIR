We at The Football Yeller are here to cover France vs Belgium Predicted Lineups for the Nations League 2024 Group B Matchday 2 matchup that will take place on Monday, 9th September 2024, at Parc Olympique Lyonnais, in Décines-Charpieu, France.

France vs Belgium Predicted Lineups Preview

On Monday evening, two long-standing rivals will face off again, as France welcomes Belgium for their second match in the UEFA Nations League this season. Despite Les Bleus suffering a defeat at home against Italy on the opening night of Group 2, the Red Devils secured a perfect score as they prepared for their journey to Lyon.

France took an early lead just 13 seconds into their Nations League match against Italy on Friday night. Still, ultimately, they ended up with nothing to show for it as the revitalised Azzurri turned the tide in their favour. In a thrilling match, in-form forward Bradley Barcola netted his nation’s fastest-ever goal, only for Italy to respond with a stunning equaliser, leaving both teams tied at the half.

France suffered two more goals in the second half, marking their first home defeat to Italy in 70 years. Following a disappointing display at Euro 2024, veteran coach Didier Deschamps was anticipated to deliver a strong performance for the fans in Paris. Still, he now faces mounting pressure to secure a win against yet another neighbouring rival of Les Bleus.

Deschamps led the French team to triumph in the 2021 Nations League finals, yet they struggled in their recent campaign, finishing third in their group with just five points from six matches. With the upcoming changes for the 2024-25 season, the team that ends up at the bottom of each League A group will face automatic relegation, and those finishing in third place will have to compete in a playoff to avoid dropping down.

With only the leading duo in Group 2 set to advance to the exciting quarterfinal stage, France finds themselves three points behind their key competitors and must avoid falling further behind. Italy is now joined at the summit of the early Group 2 standings by Belgium, who secured a victory over Israel on neutral ground, claiming all three points in their first match.

With captain Kevin De Bruyne leading the charge, the Red Devils secured a 3-1 victory in Hungary, a location chosen due to security issues. Following De Bruyne’s impressive two-goal performance, he opted to forgo the opportunity for a hat-trick by declining a penalty. Meanwhile, Lois Openda had the luxury of missing a penalty as Youri Tielemans had already found the net earlier in a lively second half.

Domenico Tedesco’s team is preparing to exact revenge on France for the disappointing exit they suffered from Euro 2024 just two months prior. In the end, Tedesco aims to move forward from his initial tournament at the helm and guarantee that Belgium clinches a top-two position in their Nations League group, all while setting sights on the 2026 World Cup.

The Belgians fell short of making it to the last Nations League finals, and surpassing their best finish of fourth overall, achieved in 2021, would indicate they are making progress.
