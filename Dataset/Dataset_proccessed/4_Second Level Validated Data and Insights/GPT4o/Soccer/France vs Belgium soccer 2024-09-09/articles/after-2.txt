UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
FRANCE 2-0 BELGIUM - RANDAL KOLO MUANI AND OUSMANE DEMBELE FIRE LES BLEUS TO NATIONS LEAGUE WIN
BYPATRIC RIDGE

UPDATED 09/09/2024 AT 21:13 GMT

After suffering a surprise loss to Italy in their Nations League opener, France eased the pressure on coach Didier Deschamps with a win over Belgium in Lyon on Monday evening. With Kylian Mbappe on the bench, Randal Kolo Muani took centre stage by firing Les Bleus in front in the first half. The points were secured when Ousmane Dembele curled home superbly on 54 minutes.

Ousmane Dembele’s stunner helped France to a relatively comfortable 2-0 victory over Belgium in the Nations League on Monday.
Dembele thundered in a blistering second goal for Les Bleus 12 minutes after the interval in Lyon.

Randal Kolo Muani had earlier hammered France into the lead against the run of play, with Belgium having shaded the opening exchanges.
UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
FRANCE WIN IN ITALY TO SNATCH TOP SPOT IN GROUP FROM AZZURRI

17/11/2024 AT 23:11

Indeed, matters would have been different had the post not come to France’s rescue early on when Dodi Lukebakio ghosted into the six-yard box unmarked.
Didier Deschamps’ side ultimately made their fortune count, though, and an accomplished second-half display was capped off by Dembele’s excellent solo strike, as France bounced back from their defeat to Italy last time out.
Mike Maignan was well placed to bundle the ball out of play after Lukebakio poked against the woodwork in the sixth minute, though France’s goalkeeper would have been helpless to prevent Lois Openda tucking into a gaping net had Lukebakio shown more composure when put through by Kevin De Bruyne soon after.
Having gained a foothold, however, France opened the scoring in the 30th minute with their first real chance.
Dembele’s scuffed attempt was parried out by Koen Casteels, with Kolo Muani lashing a venomous strike in via a deflection from Wout Faes, who had got back on the line.
A strong start to the second half paved the way for France to double their advantage when Dembele skipped in from the right flank, evaded a series of defenders and lashed a brilliant finish beyond Casteels.
Substitute Kylian Mbappe looked to make up for lost time upon his introduction, going close on three occasions, but France ultimately had to settle for two as they got their Nations League campaign up and running.
TALKING POINT – BELGIUM MISSING A SPARK
Belgium started well, yet once France opened the scoring, Domenico Tedesco’s team looked remarkably short of ideas.
De Bruyne did his best to get things going, but in truth, Belgium were hardly a threat in the second half, and after an underwhelming Euro 2024 campaign, it does not seem Tedesco is so far having the desired impact when it comes to matching the Red Devils up against the very best sides.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH – N’GOLO KANTE (FRANCE)
It is bizarre to think that just a few short months ago, it seemed like Kante’s France career was over.
Yet he came in out of the blue to star at Euro 2024, and the veteran campaigner kept up that level of performance this time out. He was instrumental to France gaining a measure of control in the first half, and also played a role in both goals.
PLAYER RATINGS
France: Maignan 7, Kounde 7, Upamecano 6, Saliba 6, Digne 6, Kante 9, Guendouzi 6, Kone 6, Dembele 7, Thuram 6, Kolo Muani 7. Subs: Fofana 6, Barcola 6, Griezmann 6, Mbappe 7, Olise 6.
Belgium: Casteels 6, Castagne 6, Debast 6, Faes 6, Theate 6, Onana 6, Tielemans 5, De Bruyne 6, Lukebakio 5, Openda 6, Doku 4. Subs: Bakayoko 5, De Ketelaere 6, Duranville 6, Mangala 6, Meunier 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
6’ – Post! France 0-0 Belgium (Lukebakio): Huge chance for Belgium! A cross is arched to the back post, where Lukebakio is on hand to acrobatically meet it. He prods the ball goalwards, but the upright comes to France's rescue, with goalkeeper Maignan then able to bundle it out of play for a corner.
9’ – Chance! France 0-0 Belgium (Lukebakio): France are all over the place defensively and it really should be 1-0 to Belgium! De Bruyne released Lukebakio with a fantastic through ball, and the winger was never getting caught. However, with Openda on for a simple square ball, Lukebakio gets far too much on his pass, and the opportunity goes begging. Another lucky escape for the hosts.
30’ – Goal! France 1-0 Belgium (Kolo Muani): Against the run of play, France have the opener! Kante weaves his way forward and pokes it through for Dembele, who takes a wild swipe with his right foot. The ball bobbles and bounces, and Casteels somewhat flaps at the save, palming it straight into the path of Kolo Muani, who hammers it in via a deflection.
57’ – Goal! France 2-0 Belgium (Dembele): And that is now six goals in a row for France scored by PSG players, as Dembele rifles a brilliant finish into the back of the net. Having cut in from the right flank after combining with Kante, Dembele skips beyond two defenders before lining up for a left-footed strike, which he plants beyond Casteels with venom! That should settle any French nerves.
73’ – Save! France 2-0 Belgium (Mbappe): That looked for all the world like it was going to be 3-0 after Mbappe raced clear of Belgium's defence from Dembele's pass. But Casteels was off his line quickly to tighten the angle, and then made an excellent stop with his feet to keep the Red Devils in this contest, though time is running out for the visitors.
