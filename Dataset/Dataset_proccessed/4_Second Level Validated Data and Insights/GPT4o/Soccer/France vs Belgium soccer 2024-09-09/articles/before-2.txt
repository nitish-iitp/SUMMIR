Despite reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2024, France’s national football team were awful to watch as the level of performance that the squad displayed was shameful as a collective. The two-time world champions will be determined to bounce back on Monday on home soil. This will be Didier Deschamps’ seventh major tournament as manager of the French side.

Meanwhile, Belgium’s national football team also had an underwhelming UEFA Euro campaign this summer but have started the Nations League on a strong note. They are coming off a comfortable 3-1 win over Israel in their opening game of the competition. But they have lost each of their last three meetings with Les Blues in all competitions.

Kylian Mbappe’s first game at the international level as a Real Madrid player ended in a disappointing 3-1 loss at home to Italy. The Frenchman has struggled to find his feet in La Liga as a return of three goals in five games is not what was expected of the Frenchman. The former PSG man is just one goal short of taking his international tally to 50.

Kevin de Bruyne (Belgium)
