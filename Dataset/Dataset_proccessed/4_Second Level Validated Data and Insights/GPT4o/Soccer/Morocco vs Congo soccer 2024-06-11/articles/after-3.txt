The Moroccan national football team dominated their match against Congo Brazzaville, securing a resounding 6-0 victory on Tuesday at Adrar Stadium in Agadir. The win strengthens their lead in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

Attacking midfielder Azeddine Ounahi opened the scoring in the 8th minute. Chadi Riad doubled the lead by the 16th minute.

Ayoub El Kaabi, striker for Greek club Olympiacos, emerged as the star of the game, netting a hat-trick against Congo Brazzaville, scoring at the 20th, 39th, and 53rd minutes. Forward Soufiane Rahimi closed the scoring with a sixth goal in the 62nd minute.

«I instructed the players to step up the game, and they responded brilliantly», said the Moroccan coach Walid Regragui. «The team was showing signs of fatigue, so we used this opportunity to give some playing time to others. I'm very happy with the group's overall performance, but we understand there's still work to be done».

He elaborated that he opted for a system change, returning to a formation that the players are more comfortable with. The coach also singled out Brahim Diaz and Soufiane Rahimi for praise, highlighting Rahimi's goal shortly after coming on as a substitute.

This dominant performance puts Morocco at the top of Group E with 9 points. Tanzania sits in second with 6 points, followed by Niger and Zambia with 3 points each. Congo Brazzaville and Eritrea remain scoreless.
