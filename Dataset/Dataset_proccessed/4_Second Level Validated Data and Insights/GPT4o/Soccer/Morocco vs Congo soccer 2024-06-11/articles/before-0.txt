As part of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Morocco’s national team, led by coach Walid Rikraki, is set to make significant changes to its squad for its upcoming match against Congo. Through these changes, Rikraki is looking to improve the team’s performance and ensure a win in this crucial match.

Congo match preview
The upcoming match against Congo is an important opportunity for the Moroccan national team to consolidate their position in the World Cup qualifiers. After a disappointing draw against Zambia, the Atlas Lions will be looking for a positive result to restore the confidence of the fans.

Changes in the defence
Chadi Riad: Rising Star
Rikraki is planning to introduce young defender Shadi Riad into the starting line-up, after his impressive form for Real Betis in La Liga.

Shining for Real Betis
Shady Riad’s performances for Real Betis this season have been so impressive that it is hard to ignore him in the national team. His performances have earned him the attention of many European clubs.

A move to the Premier League
Thanks to his outstanding performances, Chadi Riad was able to secure a move to the Premier League, boosting his chances of putting in a strong performance for the national team.

Rikraki’s trade-off between Saiss and Akred
Mistakes in the Zambia match
After a host of errors in the Zambia game, including the only goal scored by Yassine Bounou, some changes in the defence are necessary.

Akrad returns from injury
Although Nayef Akrad has returned from injury, Rikraki is still deciding between him and Ghanem Saiss to make the best decision on the starting line-up.

Changes in the forward line
Youssef Nasiri on the bench
Rikraki intends to put Sevilla striker Youssef Nasiri on the bench, after Nasiri expressed his anger in the previous match against Zambia after being substituted early in the second half.

Ayoub El Kaabi to start
In terms of strengthening the attack, Rikraki is expected to start Ayoub El Kaabi in the upcoming match, capitalising on his speed and goal-scoring ability.

Sufian Rahimi as a second option
In addition to Kaabi, Sofiane Rahimi remains a second option for the attack, as he has high individual skills and the ability to create goalscoring opportunities.

Midfield reshuffle
The return of Sofiane Amrabet
Sofiane Amrabet will return to his position in the defensive midfield, after missing Friday’s game due to a suspension after receiving a red card in the Moroccan national team’s last match at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Oussama El Azouzi’s good performance
Oussama El Azouzi performed well in the previous game against Zambia, but Amrabet’s return means adjustments in the midfield to optimise balance.

Reasons for the changes
Boosting performance
These changes are aimed at strengthening the team’s performance, both defensively and offensively, to ensure the best possible performance in the upcoming matches.

Ensure a win
Winning the next match is the main goal for Rakraki and the national team, as it will greatly contribute to the team’s chances of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Challenges facing the team
Injuries and suspensions
The team faces some challenges such as injuries and suspensions that affect Rakraki’s choices in the starting line-up.

Coordination between players
The new changes require time for coordination and understanding between the players, to ensure optimal performance in the match.

Impact on the team
Defensive stability
The changes in the defence are expected to bring greater stability to the team, making it more difficult to penetrate the defence.

Offensive efficiency
Thanks to the changes in the attacking line, Rikraki hopes to increase the team’s attacking effectiveness and score more goals.

Fans’ reactions
Expectations and hopes
Moroccan fans have high hopes for the changes made by Al-Rikraki, hoping that they will contribute to improving the team’s performance and achieving the desired results.

Criticisms and observations
Despite the positive expectations, there are some criticisms and observations about the proposed lineup and changes, which reflect the diversity of views among fans and analysts.

Conclusion
In conclusion, national coach Walid Rikraki is looking to make significant changes to the Atlas Lions’ lineup to boost the team’s chances of winning their upcoming match against Congo. These changes are part of an overall strategy aimed at improving the team’s performance and securing qualification for the 2026 World Cup.
