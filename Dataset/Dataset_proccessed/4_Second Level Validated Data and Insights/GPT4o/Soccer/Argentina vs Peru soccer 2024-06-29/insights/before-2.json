        "Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi will miss Argentina's final Group A fixture at the 2024 Copa America against Peru due to a sore throat, fever, and a tweaked right hamstring.",
        "Manager Lionel Scaloni, who will serve a touchline ban, has confirmed that changes will be made to his starting lineup and those who did not feature in Argentina's first two group matches will play against Peru.",
        "A change in goal could be on the cards, with both Franco Armani and Geronimo Rulli set to battle for a starting spot ahead of first-choice shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez.",
        "Lucas Martinez Quarta and German Pezzella are yet to feature at this summer's tournament, while Nicolas Otamendi has made just one substitute outing, and all three centre-backs will compete for a start ahead of Lisandro Martinez and Cristian Romero.",
        "Exequiel Palacios and Guido Rodriguez are in contention to start in centre-midfield, with Enzo Fernandez in line to drop out of the first XI and be given a rest having only just recovered from a groin problem.",
        "In the absence of Messi, Lautaro Martinez could start his first game of the tournament after scoring two goals in two games as a substitute, while Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho will be pushing to make his Copa America debut at the expense of either Nicolas Gonzalez or Rodrigo de Paul."
