        "Lautaro Mart\u00ednez struck twice in the second half to help Argentina's second string beat Peru 2-0 at the Copa Am\u00e9rica on Saturday and finish top of Group A, knocking Peru out of the tournament.",
        "Mart\u00ednez, featuring in the starting line-up for the first time in the competition, found the net in the 47th and 86th minutes, scoring for a third straight match.",
