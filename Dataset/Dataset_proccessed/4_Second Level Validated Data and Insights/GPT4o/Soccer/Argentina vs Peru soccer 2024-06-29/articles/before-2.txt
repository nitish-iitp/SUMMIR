Argentina lineup vs. Peru: Predicted XI for Copa America Group A match

Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi will miss Argentina's final Group A fixture at the 2024 Copa America against Peru at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida on Saturday night.

Messi was suffering with a sore throat and a fever prior to Argentina's 2-0 win over Chile on Wednesday, but he then tweaked his right hamstring in the second half before managing to see out the full 90 minutes.

The 37-year-old acknowledged after the match that the issue is "nothing serious" but he did "find it difficult to move freely" towards the end of the contest with Chile, and it has since been confirmed by assistant coach Walter Samuel that Messi will not be involved against Peru.

Manager Lionel Scaloni, who will serve a touchline ban, has confirmed that changes will be made to his starting lineup and those who did not feature in Argentina's first two group matches "will play" against Peru.

A change in goal could therefore be on the cards, with both Franco Armani and Geronimo Rulli set to battle for a starting spot between the sticks ahead of first-choice shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez.

Lucas Martinez Quarta and German Pezzella are yet to feature at this summer's tournament, while Nicolas Otamendi has made just the one substitute outing, and all three centre-backs will compete for a start ahead of Lisandro Martinez and Cristian Romero.

Exequiel Palacios and Guido Rodriguez are in contention to start in centre-midfield, with Enzo Fernandez in line to drop out of the first XI and be given a rest having only just recovered from a groin problem.

In the absence of Messi, Lautaro Martinez could start his first game of the tournament after scoring two goals in two games as a substitute, while Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho will be pushing to make his Copa America debut at the expense of either Nicolas Gonzalez or Rodrigo de Paul.

Argentina possible starting lineup: Armani; Montiel, Otamendi, Pezzella, Acuna; Mac Allister, Rodriguez, Palacios; Di Maria, La. Martinez, Garnacho
