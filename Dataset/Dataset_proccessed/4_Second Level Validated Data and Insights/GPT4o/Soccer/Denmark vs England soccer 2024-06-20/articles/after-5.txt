EURO 2024
DENMARK 1-1 ENGLAND - STODGY THREE LIONS LIMP TO EURO 2024 DRAW AFTER MORTEN HJULMAND STUNNER
BYCIARAN BAYNES

UPDATED 20/06/2024 AT 22:59 GMT

A disappointing England performance ended with a sloppy 1-1 draw against Denmark that left Gareth Southgate’s side in control of Group C, but with even more questions as to their credentials as contenders for the tournament. England lacked purpose and were outplayed by a Denmark side who will be frustrated they could not take more from the game after Morten Hjulmand's stunning strike.

England missed the opportunity to secure their passage to the second round of Euro 2024 with a desperately disappointing draw against Denmark.
Once more they secured an early goal, scored by skipper Harry Kane, but again it led to the side dropping back and inviting Denmark to come forward with no pressure whatsoever, which led to an equaliser - albeit from a great strike from Morten Hjulmand.

Although England were the closest to adding to the score, through Phil Foden's 20-yard drive against the post, it is their Scandinavian opponents who will feel their play warranted three points.

ENGLAND SEAL NATIONS LEAGUE PROMOTION WITH FIVE-STAR DISPLAY AGAINST 10-MAN IRELAND

17/11/2024 AT 20:50

Twice in the last 10 minutes, they were close to securing a winner. First Andreas Christensen half-volleyed over the bar when a corner dropped to him on the six-yard line and then moments later Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s effort curled just wide of Jordan Pickford's far post.
Despite the poor display, England remain in control of Group C, topping the table on four points with Denmark and Slovenia next with two from two.
TALKING POINT - ENGLAND SHOULD NOT BE AMONG FAVOURITES
They looked a worse side in possession than Denmark, with little signs of any system. After the criticism of the overly defensive display against Serbia, it was incredible to see them seek to sit back with 11 men behind the ball when the Danes entered their half.
There was no pressure on Denmark in possession, no orchestrated press from England; no cohesion between the lines. As a result Denmark had the easiest task to come forward and camp inside their attacking half. As the game entered the final phase there was only one side which looked like winning.
In some ways this mirrored the game against Scotland three years ago and perhaps with their predominance of England-based players, they were similarly suited to raise their game against Gareth Southgate's side.
That said, it is very hard to see England stumbling into a system which makes them play with the fluidity to justify their pre-tournament bookmakers' favourites tag.
They may well top the group. They may win a second-round clash with a third-place team. And even get through to the last-four on penalties. But this is not a side which will threaten the top-four sides in the tournament.

PLAYER OF THE MATCH - PIERRE-EMILE HOJBJERG (DENMARK)
He was inches from winning the game for Denmark and it would have been just reward as he thoroughly outplayed the much higher-rated midfielders in the opposition. Whenever his team got the ball in the attacking third, he drove forward putting pressure on England and though he was a bit shot-happy, it nearly worked out for him in the end.
PLAYER RATINGS
Denmark: Schmeichel 6; Andersen 6, Christensen 6, Vestergaard 6; Maehle 6, Hojbjerg 8*, Hjulmand 7, Kristiansen 5; Eriksen 7; Hojlund 6, Wind 6.
Subs: Damshaard 7, Poulsen 6, Bah 6, Skov Olsen 6, Nrgaard 6.
England: Pickford 6; Walker 6, Stones 6, Guehi 7, Trippier 6; Alexander-Arnold 6, Rice 5; Saka 7, Bellingham 6, Foden 7; Kane 6.
Subs: Gallagher 6, Eze 6, Watkins 6, Bowen 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
18' GOAL! ENGLAND (KANE) 1-0 DENMARK Walker robs Kristiansen then bursts into the box and takes his time before sliding a pass which is deflected into the path of the England skipper and he makes no mistake.
34' GOAL! ENGLAND 1-1 DENMARK (HUJLMAND) A fantastic strike from the Denmark midfielder. No one closes him down 25 yards from goal and he hits an unerring shot in off the post.
56' FODEN HITS THE POST! Saka plays the ball into his feet 25 yards from goal and he drives a low effort which has Schmeichel beaten but comes off his near post.
72' GREAT BALL FROM BELLINGHAM! Watkins runs onto the ball and shoots from a tight angle but Schmeichel came out to block his shot.
73' HOJBERG SHOOTS FROM 30 YARDS! Pickford has to scramble across his line to push the ball away. It may have been hitting the post.
84' CHRISTENSEN WITH A GREAT CHANCE! The corner misses the bodies at the front post and the defender has a chance from six yards but half-volleys over.
85' HOJBERG INCHES WIDE FROM SCORING! After England give the ball away once more, his effort curls towards the far post and Pickford was flat footed and just hoping the ball drifted wide - and thankfully, it just does.
