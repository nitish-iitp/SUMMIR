England vs Denmark Predicted Lineups Preview

England is gearing up for Euro 2024 with a lot of optimism, thanks to a talented squad and impressive showings in recent international tournaments. The Three Lions, under the guidance of Gareth Southgate, have consistently demonstrated their skill on the pitch, making it to the Euro 2020 final and the World Cup semi-finals in 2018.

Key players such as Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, and Jude Bellingham are anticipated to have crucial roles in England’s campaign. Kane, in particular, continues to be one of the most prolific strikers in Europe, and his leadership and goal-scoring ability will be of utmost importance.

Throughout its history, England has experienced ups and downs in the European Championships, culminating in a second-place finish in 2020. Nevertheless, the team remains resolute in their pursuit to overcome previous letdowns and emerge victorious in 2024.

With a strong squad and valuable experience from previous tournaments, England is considered a top contender to make a deep run in the competition. Fans and pundits are excited to see if Southgate’s team can bring football home and win their first major international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.

Going into this fixture, England has a win probability of 55%, whereas Denmark has a win probability of 20%.
