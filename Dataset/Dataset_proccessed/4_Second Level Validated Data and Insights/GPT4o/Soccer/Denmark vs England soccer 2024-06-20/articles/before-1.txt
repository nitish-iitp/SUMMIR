Wherever Denmark play during the European Championship this summer they will inevitably paint the city red.

Last Sunday, ahead of their opening game against Slovenia, Stuttgart was temporarily overtaken by thousands of Danish supporters, sporting bright red Hummel football shirts from various decades with matching Viking helmets perched on their heads.

Fittingly for a carnival-like atmosphere, there was an accompanying float: The Roliganbussen, a 30-year-old Volvo B10M that’s undergone a dramatic transformation.

Painted in the country’s red and white cross, the bus hummed alongside the fans on foot, blaring out football anthems as pints of beer were poured on board, escorted either side by German Polizei cars as it meandered towards its campsite in the vicinity of the Stuttgart Arena. It was a fitting place for the bus to make its grand debut given the city’s inextricable links with the automobile industry in the form of powerhouse brands Mercedes Benz and Porsche.

It will take to the streets of Frankfurt and Munich next for Denmark’s games against England and Serbia, no doubt attracting a mixture of admiring and confused glances from outside its windows.

The bus personifies Danish supporters’ outlook on football fandom. They want to enjoy themselves but aim to do so in a peaceful, respectful and colourful manner.

The Danish word Rolig translates as calm or quiet in the English language and the term Roligan was coined by a newspaper in the mid-80s when hooliganism was rife around Europe. From Roligan came the catchy, unofficial term “Rooligan”: the anti-hooligan.

“There was no official hooligan scene in Denmark at the time, and Danes considered watching football in a different and more civilized way than what we saw elsewhere on the continent,” Toke Moller Theilade, editor-in-chief at Vilfortpark, explains.

“Anybody that supports Denmark can and will use that expression about themselves. So there will be hundreds of thousands of people considering themselves Roligans in Denmark.”

Jan Leth is one of them and among a group of five fans using the Roliganbussen throughout the tournament, both as a mode of transport and a place to sleep.

“You will not see many Danish fans who are not in red and white. It’s a red sea when we are walking and in the stadium,” he tells i.

“I think we have a very nice fan culture because it has to be fun and we will not fight anyone. We are proud of that.”

This is the third time he has travelled to a major competition in a motorhome, after the World Cup in France in 1998 – when he and his fellow campers stayed in a cosier Volkswagen campervan – and at the European Championship in Portugal in 2004.

“We were afraid to live in a place where the English were,” says Leth, recalling France ’98 which was marred by violence.

“We got into this place and we saw a lot of English and they were not looking good, they looked like they could eat rats! Some bald guys with tattoos. But we put their national song on our music system and they were very nice. It was fantastic. God Save The Queen saved the Danes!”

Twenty years on from his previous tournament adventure, Leth decided to reboot the Roliganbussen.

“Some of my friends haven’t been on the other trips so they have asked me a lot of times to do it again,” he adds. “When we first saw that the European Championship would be in Germany it was obvious that of course, we should go there as we’re living in the neighbouring country.”

Leth, the crew’s youngest member at 53, and his friends – the oldest of whom is 60 – bought the bus 18 months ago and gradually began redesigning it from an everyday vehicle into a pub on wheels.

They created a mini-bar complete with a chic neon sign that wouldn’t look out of place in an east London bar, with two beer kegs installed that produce freshly pulled pints of Danish lager Tuborg and 1664 Blanc Weissbier.

A flatscreen TV was mounted at the front to ensure that no minute of the tournament would pass by unwatched and Danish flags, scarves and memorabilia were pinned to the inner walls and the roof to give it a homely feel.

The group has quickly become popular with fellow Danes in Germany, who have sought out the bus to pose for pictures or to enjoy a refreshing draft beer in the sunshine.

The fanfare over the bus has also brought Leth and his friends “15 minutes of fame” and led to meetings with Danish celebrities and famous footballers from yesteryear to the present day at home and in Germany.

It appeared in a Uefa-produced film featuring messages of support to Kasper Hjulmand’s squad from some of Denmark’s most famous faces, which was beamed out to the Stuttgart Arena before kick-off last weekend.

One of the addresses came from Malte Ebert, the singer of Denmark’s official Euro 2024 anthem Kongen Af Danmark – The King of Denmark – sitting inside the Roliganbussen. The sight almost brought tears to Leth’s eyes, but he managed to keep his emotions in check and his red face paint unsmudged.

“Everyone is asking about the bus,” he says. “Danish television asked us to visit where some of the 1992 European Championship winners from our national team were. We got them in our bus and drove around with them.

“We had [ex-Arsenal midfielder] John “Faxe” Jensen and the top-scoring player in our team that year Henrik Larsen with us. They are fat boys now drinking beer and eating burgers! So that was funny.”

It is a sign of how much the culture is revered and respected that the Danish Football Association (DBU) has aligned itself with Roligan supporters in recent years. It’s a no-brainer given the movement portrays Danish football in an overwhelmingly positive light.

“The Danish FA is proud of the whole Roligan movement as it is something that is uniquely tied to the Danish national team,” Theilade explains.

“They frequently use it in their marketing and messages to both fans, media and sponsors. It is also Danish football heritage and part of the culture around the national team.”

Last week, the DBU invited Leth and his friends to Denmark’s training base in the Baden-Wurttemberg town of Freudenstadt, although kept the details about the visit vague.

“When Denmark’s technical director Peter Moller saw the bus he started clapping and cheering,” Leth says.

“Then he said, “Wait, I will get the others”. We looked at each other and thought ‘who are the others?’ and then all of the players came out to us. Christian Eriksen, Rasmus Hojlund, everybody and they all signed the bus.”

The legendary Danish winger Allan Simonsen, who has the unusual distinction of being the only footballer in history to have both won the Ballon d’Or and played for Charlton Athletic, also penned his signature on the bodywork.

“Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg came inside the bus and when he saw the tap machine he said, ‘woah, you’ve got your own beer machine!'” Leth continues.

“Me and Christian Eriksen are from the same city so I talked a little bit with him. I had a shirt made with a heart with his initials “CE” inside it [after his cardiac arrest in 2021] and I asked him if he saw it. He said it was the first thing that he saw [in the bus] and that he was very thankful.

“They were very nice and took time to go into the bus and walk around. That was a good experience.”

i only witnessed positive interactions between the bus and supporters on the outside ahead of last Sunday’s game, with many tipsy fans attempting to keep up with it as it drifted off into the distance.

However, while Theilade insists the Roligan movement is extremely popular, he claims it is not universally endorsed.

“Most fans who go to a national team match consider themselves Roligans and part of the movement and culture,” he says.

“However, there are ultras from the Danish clubs who are tired of the whole Roligan wave. These are people who would want a more passionate support for the national team rather than the festive and sometimes silly way of support that the Roligans are known for.

“There have been various attempts to create a more dedicated stand in Parken for the home matches, and we are also seeing the Danish fans make tifos before the matches. Nevertheless, the Roligan culture is strong and apart from the ultras it is something most Danes are proud of.”

You can’t please everybody. A few mean-spirited social media users described the Roligan ethos and the bus generally as “Woke” in response to a video of it posted by i. Nevertheless, it is easy to see why it has gained such widespread appeal.

While the emphasis is on fun there is a fundraising aspect to it too. The bus is sponsoring KidsAID, a Danish charity that organises group trips, activities and experiences for sick and vulnerable children and young adults to enjoy with their families.

“We have grass on the rooftop and we invite people up and every time they come up we say to them “please put some money into KidsAID,” and they do it every time,” Leth says.

“KidsAID wrote to me and said now the money is rolling in, so that’s really good.”

There is also a sense of duty to preserve this unique aspect of Danish football fan culture and ensure that it endures over time.

Unlike in 1998 and 2004, Leth has been accompanied to this tournament by his son who joined him on board the Roliganbussen in Stuttgart. His boy was sceptical about Danish supporters’ exemplary reputation abroad until the opening night of Euro 2024 when he and his father posed for selfies with German and Scottish fans.

“I think he will have the bus in a couple of years! But that is part of the plan,” Leth says. “We show our kids why we’re doing it and that they can do it.

“It isn’t the world’s biggest project. It’s just a bus that we have painted and have had fun with, but we love that we can pass it on to the next generation.

“Hopefully, we’ll still be here in 30 years too. Then we’ll have a handicap bus with a ramp!”
