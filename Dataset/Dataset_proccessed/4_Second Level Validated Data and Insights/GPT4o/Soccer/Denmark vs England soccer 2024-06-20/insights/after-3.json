        "Harry Kane became the third player to score at four different major international tournaments for England, along with Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney.",
        "Harry Kane\u2019s opener was his fifth goal at the UEFA European Championship, becoming the first England player and eighth player overall to score 5+ goals at both the men\u2019s FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship.",
        "Denmark\u2019s leveller was England\u2019s eighth goal conceded from outside the box at the UEFA European Championship. No side has conceded more on record in the history of the competition (since 1980, Portugal also 8).",
        "Morten Hjulmand\u2019s equaliser was his first goal for Denmark (9th appearance). It was also Denmark\u2019s ninth goal from outside the box at the UEFA European Championship, with only three teams netting more on record (since 1980 \u2013 Germany 15, Netherlands 12, France 11)."

    "Key Match Events": [
        "Kyle Walker charged forward after Jude Bellingham\u2019s overhit pass down the right wing and caught Denmark left-back Victor Kristiansen by surprise, nicking the ball and running clear into the box. Walker cut the ball back and, via a couple of deflections, found Harry Kane, who slotted into the corner of the net.",
        "Harry Kane played a blind pass across the pitch inside his own half, which Kristensen collected. He found Morten Hjulmand, who fizzed an unstoppable effort from way outside the box low, and off the inside of the post into the net.",
        "Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg forced Jordan Pickford into a save low down at his near post, and on another occasion, he flashed a fierce effort just wide of the post. Substitute Mikkel Damsgaard also drew a save from Pickford."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "England gained a point that puts them in a strong position to win the group, but they will want to leave this desperate performance behind them. There\u2019ll need to be a huge improvement against Slovenia next Tuesday."

        "The goal meant 13 goals have already been scored at Euro 2024 from outside the penalty area \u2013 accounting for 28.3% of the goals so far, up from 13.4% at Euro 2020.",
        "England again struggled to create much down their left flank, with Phil Foden starting there once more but drifting into central areas and right-footed left-back Kieran Trippier again unable to provide attacking width.",
        "Denmark have won just one of their last 10 group stage games at major international tournaments (EURO/World Cup), beating Russia 4-1 on MD3 in EURO 2020 (D5 L4)."
