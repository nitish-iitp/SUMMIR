The fourth-place finishers of the 2022 FIFA World Cup are eyeing the quarter-finals

The Morocco national football team made a big name in the 2022 FIFA World Cup while finishing fourth. It was a historic showcasing of the talent plus they also knocked out Cristiano Ronaldo‘s Portugal in that run. In the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, the Atlas Lions have reached the Round of 16 after finishing first in Group F.

The South Africa national football team, on the other hand, were grouped with Mali, Namibia and Tunisia in Group E. After witnessing all the facades of a football game that is a win, draw and defeat, they managed to finish second. Now a daunting task awaits for Hugo Broos’s men to try and test the ambitions of Morocco.

Players to Watch
Achraf Hakimi (Morocco)

Currently, the biggest name in his national side, Achraf Hakimi is expected to be a key player. The right-back is versatile both in attack and defence. After three games in the Ivory Coast AFCON tournament, the Paris Saint-Germain star player has a goal and an assist.

Themba Zwane (South Africa)

South Africa played three group games but failed to open scoring in two of those games. And in the one they did, Themba Zwane scored a brace against Namibia. The 34-year-old is showing age is just a number and continues to be an integral part of Broos’s plan.

Match Facts
Morocco made it to the Round of 16 after finishing as Group F winner while South Africa came second in Group E
Bafana Bafana’s 4-0 win against Namibia is one of the two highest winning margins so far in the tournament (the other one is, Equatorial Guinea 4-0 Ivory Coast)
The winner will meet either Cape Verde or Mauritania in the quarter-finals
Injury & Team News

As the Confederation of African Football (CAF) lifted the ban on head coach Walid Regragui, it comes as a major boost for Morocco. The match-winner against Zambia, Hakim Ziyech, was subbed off with an ankle injury. He remains a doubt.

Hugo Broos’s men have no major issues in the squad right now. Expect a fully available squad at his disposal for selection on Tuesday.
