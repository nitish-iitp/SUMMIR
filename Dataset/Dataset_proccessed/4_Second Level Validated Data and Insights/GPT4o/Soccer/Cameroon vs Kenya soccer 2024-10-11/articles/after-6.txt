NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct 11 – Harambee Stars suffered a heavy 4-1 thrashing at the hands of Cameroon in their third Group J match of the 2025 Africa Cup Of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde on Friday night, coach Engin Firat’s heaviest defeat since he took charge of the team.

Captain Vincent Aboubakar’s early penalty opened the floodgates for the Indomitable Lions, before Martin Hongla, Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Bassogog added more goals. Kenya’s consolation was scored by skipper Michael Olunga.

It was a strange day for Stars and coach Firat, as they were found flat footed by the determined Cameroonians. After just eight minutes, they had broken the deadlock when Aboubakar converted from the penalty spit after Erick Ouma was adjudged to have handed the ball inside the box.

Stars tried to rally back and get themselves back into contention. However, six minutes to the break, it was 2-0. Hongla struck a shot from the edge of the box, with keeper Patrick matasi, who was returning to the starting team, fumbling his handling to see the ball bounce into the net.

But three minutes later, Stars gave themselves hope when Eric Ouma’s freekick from the left landed on skipper Olunga’s run at the backpost, the latter directing the ball home.

But, the joy was shortlived as Cameroon restored their two goal advantage, Mbeumo tapping the ball home from close range off a Bassogog cross.

At the turn of the half, coach Firat tried to stabilize his backline, pulling out Amos Nondi for Joseph Okumu, Nondi having faced a torrid time against Bassogog on the right. But, Cameroon needed just nine minutes in the second half to complete their victory, Bassogog turning home Hongla’s assist.

Stars were deflated, and Cameroon easily passed the ball around the pack.

Firat will now have three days to re-organize his charges before the return tie in Kampala on Monday.
