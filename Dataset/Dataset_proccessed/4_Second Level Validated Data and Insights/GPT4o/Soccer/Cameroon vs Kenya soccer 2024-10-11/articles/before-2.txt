Kenya vs. Cameroon: A Historical Head-to-Head Analysis of the Group J Leaders' Showdown
Author: Sakwa Kombo
Wed Oct 09 2024

The top of Group J is set to have a head to head clash of the leaders as Kenya's takes on Cameroon. The two-legged match is set for Friday, October 11, 2024, at Japoma Stadium in Douala, Cameroon. There will then be a return leg, behind closed doors at the at Mandela National Stadium in Kampala Uganda. This Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier fixture will be on Monday, October 14, 2024.

In African football, these two nations at the top of group J have never really been considered equals. Even as they fight to reach the 2025 showpiece in Morocco, the Indomitable Lions are approaching the two fixtures as 5-time AFCON champions, 2nd in the all-time list. The West African nation, who won the tournament seven years ago, has played in seven finals, losing only two times.

Kenya on the other hand have nothing near the same record. In 2019, Harambee Stars ended a 15-year wait to participate in AFCON, after finishing second in Group F below Ghana in qualification. This was the country’s sixth continental tournament appearance, having previously participated in 1972, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 2004. 

Unlike Cameroon, they have no final to speak of, Harambee Stars have never progressed to the knockout stage of the competition in all their appearances.

Kenya History of AFCON Matches Versus Cameroon

 

Interestingly, when Kenya made her first AFCON appearance 52 years ago, it was placed in Group A alongside Cameroon. Kenya's opponents also happened to be the tournament’s hosts. In fact, in the first 3 tournaments Harambee Stars qualified for, the team was placed in the same group as the Indomitable Lions.

In the 1972 Group A opener, Kenya narrowly lost the match 2-1 to the hosts. The second time, the teams met at the continental tournament in 1988, the match ended in a 0-0 draw. The 1990 tournament was the last AFCON meet for the two sides, a game Cameroon triumphed 2-0 over Kenya.

After, the1972 meet, the two teams played a friendly match in 1984 that ended with Kenya losing 1-3 to the West African Nation. Three years later, Kenya hosted the All African Games in Nairobi where they played out a 3-3 draw with Cameroon in the football tournament.

The 2025 qualifiers are the second time the two sides have met at this stage. Previously, they were part of Group 5 in the qualifiers stage for the 1998 tournament. Both games ended in a draw. The return fixture was in Yaoundé, at the Stade Omnisport, where Fabrice Moreau scored an 89th minute penalty to cancel out a strike from Francis Were that came in the 49th minute. The February fixture in Nairobi had ended 0-0. This was the last competitive fixture between the sides as only a friendly was held in 2010.

As it stands, Kenya has never beaten Cameroon in 8 different encounters. They have drawn 4 times and have lost the rest while scoring 7 goals. Cameroon on their part have found the net 14 times against Kenya.

 

All in all, these teams are not football equals meeting, however, Harambee Stars coach was bullish after the last round of fixtures saying “am not afraid of Cameroon “.

Sadly, this will be another international break where Kenyans will not have a chance to watch their national team live due to lack of facilities. The last time the senior men’s national team played at home was on September the 12th, 2023 at the Moi International Sports Center Kasarani.
