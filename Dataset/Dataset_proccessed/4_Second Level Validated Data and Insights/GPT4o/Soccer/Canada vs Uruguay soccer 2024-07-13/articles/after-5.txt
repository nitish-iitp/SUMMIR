Uruguay beat Canada on penalties to snatch bronze

Uruguay beat Canada on penalty kicks to claim bronze at the 2024 Copa America after Luis Suarez scored a dramatic stoppage-time equalizer.

Uruguay were the overwhelming favorites to win in Charlotte and quickly took the lead when Rodrigo Bentancur smashed in a knock-down from a corner.

But Canada went on to play their best football of the tournament and got back on level terms when the impressive Ismael Kone scored an acrobatic overhead kick. And, in the second-half, Canada took the lead when Jonathan David pounced to slot home a rebound.

Suarez broke Canada’s hearts at the death, however, and it was Uruguay who held their nerve in the shootout. Ismael Kone’s tame effort was saved and Canada captain Alphonso Davies then hit the crossbar with a Panenka to hand third-place to the fortunate Uruguayans.

Of course it had to be Luis Suarez...

The 37-year-old Inter Miami striker, one of the most divisive and controversial players in soccer, came off the bench to level for Uruguay in stoppage time and force this chaotic game to a penalty shootout.

Ismael Kone, who had earlier scored a brilliantly innovative goal, and Alphonso Davies, the star of this Canada team, both failed to convert their penalties to give Uruguay victory.

Rodrigo Bentancur had put Uruguay ahead with a sharp angled finish and Kone equalized for Canada with… well, we’re not quite sure what it was. A standing bicycle kick with one foot planted on the ground, maybe? Anyway, it was ambitious and audacious — and we like that.

Facundo Pellestri saw his first-half goal disallowed after a video assistant referee (VAR) review but then Jonathan David came off the bench to score for Canada in the 80th minute. His side looked set for a $1 million windfall (the team that finishes third at Copa America receives $5 million and the fourth $4 million) but Suarez had other ideas.

Throw in two former Leeds United coaches’ pre-match comments — Marcelo Bielsa said the tournament was “unprofessional” and Jesse Marsch claimed his side has been treated like “second-class” citizens — and this was always going to be a lively encounter.

And ultimately it was Uruguay and Bielsa who came out on top.

Pablo Maurer, Joshua Kloke and Jack Lang dissect the big talking points below…

Canada should hold their heads high

It’s a desperately disappointing way for Canada’s tournament to end but they should still consider this a successful summer.

They finished the highest of all the guest nations invited to compete at the U.S. Copa America.

Panama — quarter-finalists

Jamaica — group stage

Heartbreak for Canada.

Canada were the better team and were just seconds away from winning bronze.

But Luis Suarez struck at the death and the Uruguayans then held their nerve to win the penalty shootout, with Alphonso Davies missing a Panenka to hand victory to Marceo Bielsa’s side.

How Uruguay scored their second

Uruguay are throwing the kitchen sink at it with Gimenez acting as an auxiliary winger and the veteran breaks down the right.

He cuts the ball across the face of goal and — who else — but Luis Suarez is there to race onto his pass.

He may have missed moments ago but he doesn’t make the same mistake twice and buries this one beyond St Clair.

It looks as though we are heading to penalties!

REFEREE!

88’ Canada 2-1 Uruguay

What are you doing, ref!

Uruguay are on the attack but lose possession on the edge of Canada’s box and the break is on!

Millar, a second-half substitute, attempts to dribble round Gimenez and fails, but the ball falls kindly to Davies who gets on his bike.

But as he nudges it forward the ball takes a slight ricochet off referee Alexis Herrera who halts play despite Canada having men over!

The correct decision, legally speaking, but Canada have every right to feel aggrieved there.
