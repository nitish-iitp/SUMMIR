PREVIEW: CanMNT get chance to leave lasting Copa América impression in third place match against Uruguay

Canada vs. Uruguay
Copa América 2024 — Third Place Match
July 13, 2024 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT
Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina

Bronze medal games have a special place in the hearts of Canadian soccer fans.

At the 2012 London Olympics, the Canadian women’s national team famously beat France 1-0 in the bronze medal game to cap off a run that had inspired an entire country. It was a moment that ignited that team’s belief,  as they would go on to earn another bronze four years later in Rio, before ‘changing the colour of the medal’ as they won Gold in Tokyo in 2021.

It also came just three years before a home World Cup in 2015, a tournament that while maybe not as successful on the pitch as the Canadian women’s national team would have hoped unquestionably further boosted their profile off of it.

The men’s national team’s 2-0 semifinal loss to Argentina at this year’s Copa América wasn’t quite on the same level of drama as that 4-3 extra time heartbreaker against the Americans at the 2012 Olympics. There was no hat-trick hero like the legendary Christine Sinclair, after all, and Canada were much closer to winning on that August 6, 2012 night at Old Trafford.

But the country is still clearly watching, as 6.9 million Canadians were estimated to have tuned in to that semifinal match against the defending World Cup winners, with an average audience of 2.8 million. Canada’s Copa América run has had just enough heroic efforts, strong showings against the world’s best and refereeing controversy sprinkled in to draw parallels to that London team.

On Saturday in North Carolina, the men’s national team will get their chance to write a happy ending of their own as they face Uruguay in the Copa América’s third-place game. It is also a chance to leave a lasting impression on the wider Canadian public with the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil now just under 700 days away.

It is also yet another important opportunity for Canada to test themselves against one of the world’s best teams at a major competition. Marcelo Bielsa’s Uruguay currently sit 14th in the world and are the only team to have defeated Argentina since the 2022 World Cup, doing so at La Bombonera in Buenos Aires, no less. They sit second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying, and beat Brazil on penalties in the Copa América quarter-finals.

The 15-time Copa América champions will also will be motivated to end their tournament on a positive note after a disappointing 1-0 semi-final loss to ten-man Colombia. That match ended with ugly scenes as several Uruguay players, including Liverpool’s Darwin Núñez, were involved in an altercation in the stands with Colombian supporters.

At the time of writing, there is no word on whether there will be any resulting suspensions or discipline ahead of Saturday’s match, but defender Guillermo Varela, who received a late red card is suspended. The man he replaced off the bench, Tottenham’s Rodrigo Bentancur, was subbed off through injury and is also unlikely to be available against Canada.

The two nations have only met twice before at the senior level, with the most recent being a friendly prior to the 2022 Qatar World Cup in September of the year. Uruguay won 2-0 on that day, with goals from Nicholas de la Cruz and Núñez.

With how taxing this tournament has been on many of Canada’s regular starters so far, and in an interest to see what he has in many players that have not seen much action yet during the torrid start to his managerial career with Canada, head coach Jesse Marsch has said to expect changes. Players like Ali Ahmed, Mathieu Choinière and Tani Oluwaseyi were all mentioned as players who could potentially get a longer look on Saturday.

One particularly interesting name that Marsch mentioned who could be in line for his first international start on Saturday is 18-year-old defender Luc de Fougerolles of Fulham. So far he has made just one appearance for Canada, as a late substitute off the bench against Trinidad and Tobago in a Copa América play-off back in March.

Unquestionably one of the most promising stories for Canada at this Copa América has been the performance of centreback pairing Moïse Bombito and Derek Cornelius. If de Fougerolles shows he can be another dependable option for the Canadian manager both now and especially leading up to 2026 that will only be the cherry on top.

It is also an opportunity for Canada to show another strong attribute they seem to have developed since Marsch took over — an ability to bounce back after disappointment. Be that a strong performance in a 0-0 draw with France after a 4-0 drubbing to the Netherlands in his debut match as Canada coach, or a 1-0 win over Peru after their last 2-0 loss to Argentina to open this tournament, the group has shown a good reaction to adversity.

To bounce back on Saturday and pick up a win against an elite opponent. It might not come with a trophy just yet, but like with the women’s national team 12 years ago it could prove an important moment in the road to eventually do so.

Canada has reignited belief in the program at this 2024 Copa América. But the job is not done, and they have a chance to make an important lasting impression by finishing the tournament with a monumental and memorable win.
