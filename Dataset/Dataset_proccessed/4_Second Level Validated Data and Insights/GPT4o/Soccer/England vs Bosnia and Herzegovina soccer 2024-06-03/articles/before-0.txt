Seven England players absent from training before Bosnia-Herzegovina friendly

England head coach Gareth Southgate was without as many as seven players for Sunday's training session as the Three Lions prepare to face Bosnia-Herzegovina in Monday's friendly.

In the first of the Three Lions' two warm-up matches for Euro 2024, Bosnia will arrive at St James' Park on June 3, meeting with England for the very first time in a competitive or non-competitive setting.

Southgate's men will then return to their usual Wembley base for the visit of Iceland next Friday, before jetting off to Germany to tackle Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia in Euro 2024 Group C.

The England boss called up a preliminary squad of 33 players for the prep period, which must be trimmed down to a minimum of 23 and a maximum of 26 players by June 7, when the final Euros squads must be submitted.

However, Southgate was already missing seven troops on Sunday, where a handful sat out training due to injury, while a few others were absent due to recent club commitments.

Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Anthony Gordon work individually

Manchester United duo Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw have been nursing calf and thigh problems respectively, and both men were restricted to individual training over the weekend.

Maguire's problem should not impact his chances of playing for England at the Euros, but straight after naming his preliminary squad, Southgate conceded that the luckless Shaw would be a "long shot".

In addition, Newcastle United winger Anthony Gordon was not present on the grass with his teammates either, suggesting that the 23-year-old will miss out on the chance to play for his nation at his home stadium.

Gordon missed the Magpies' last game of the Premier League season due to an ankle injury, but Harry Kane was involved in Sunday's practice session, despite struggling with a back problem in the closing stages of his debut Bayern Munich campaign.

Whether the England captain is risked for Monday's game is another matter entirely, though, as Southgate could call upon Ollie Watkins or Ivan Toney to deputise in the number nine position.

In addition to the injured trio, another quartet of Englishmen will not be available for Monday's friendly due to recent finals for their club teams, including Real Madrid hotshot Jude Bellingham.

The 20-year-old became a Champions League winner at Wembley on Saturday night as Los Blancos defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-0, and he will link up with the team at some point next week before their friendly with Iceland.

As well as Bellingham, Manchester City duo Phil Foden and Kyle Walker are still on a break following the FA Cup final, as is Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo, one of the Red Devils' scorers at Wembley.

Walker's absence complicates England's full-back situation further for Monday's game, although Joe Gomez and Ezri Konsa are both capable of deputising on the right if Kieran Trippier operates as a makeshift left-back.

Meanwhile, Foden and Gordon being unavailable could open the door for Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze to start on the left, although Jack Grealish is another option for Southgate.
