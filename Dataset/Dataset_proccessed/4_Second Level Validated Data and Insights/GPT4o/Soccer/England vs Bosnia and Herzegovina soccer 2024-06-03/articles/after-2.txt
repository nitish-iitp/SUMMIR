Just one more friendly...

I'm sorry guys, but the time has come for me to leave you.

The international summer is now well and truly underway as England put three past Bosnia to secure a comfortable win at St James' Park.

The scoreline does not tell the whole story, the Three Lions were very sluggish in the first half, but they upped their game in the second to get the job done.

Anyway, the England train is now on its way to Germany with just one more stop on the way against Iceland at Wembley.

We will be there for it, and beyond.

Thank you for joining us tonight, it is always a pleasure to deliver this content to you all, it's never a chore.

I will see you all very soon, tara!

Match Story: England 3-0 Bosnia

Right, before we go, I have one more thing for you to read.

You have heard Oliver Holt's post-match thoughts, well, here is his match story.

You know that our Chief Sports Writer was a fan of Trent Alexander-Arnold tonight, but what else did he take from the evening?

I'm not giving any hints, you will have to take a look.

To do so, click below:

Trent Alexander-Arnold staked a claim to start with Declan Rice
ENGLAND 3-0 BOSNIA - OLIVER HOLT AT ST JAMES' PARK: A game of hints and suggestions gave Southgate a few clues and plenty of encouragement.
Mail Online

21:50
'I thought Trent AA was best player on pitch'

So, I'm not the only one who thinks this.

Mail Sport's Chief Sports Writer, Oliver Holt, was at St James' Park this evening, and he has given his thoughts on certain individual performances.

It seems he agrees with what I was saying about Trent Alexander-Arnold earlier. Great minds think alike...

21:44
Eberechi Eze: 'I am grateful'

Eberechi Eze, England forward, speaking to BBC 5 Live:

Grateful to God to have this opportunity and I tried to express myself and to try enjoy it. I felt like that has been my mindset to keep going with momentum and to keep enjoying my football.
Again I feel like for me I am grateful to God to be in the position now and to come from so many different challenges. To be in this position is a huge blessing - I am grateful.
21:40
Eze shines

Eberechi Eze certainly took his opportunity tonight.

In that first half, he was a bright spark in a dull performance. Eze drove at the defence, danced around opposing players, and provided some sort of a press when others weren't.

In the second period he continued to be just as impressive, and he has done his Euro 2024 chances no harm whatsoever tonight.

If it was up to me, he'd be on that plane next week.

21:33
SOFASCORE STATS: England 3-0 Bosnia

Now this is what you call dominance...

I must admit, it didn't feel like England had 25 shots today, but I guess they did start to create a lot of openings in the second half.

While Bosnia can be happy they held out for 60 minutes, they didn't really offer anything all match. They only had one shot.

This proves you can't take too much away from today's game.

21:30
Two Three Lions debuts

It's been a special day for two of the England boys.

Those two are Jarrad Branthwaite and Adam Wharton, who both stepped on to the pitch in England shirt for the very first time tonight.

There must not be many better feelings than representing your country for the first time.

Just look at their beaming smiles.

21:25
Palmer the penalty man...

Cole Palmer absolutely loves a penalty, doesn't he?

He scored all nine of his spot kicks for Chelsea this season, so it's fitting that his first goal for the Three Lions was a penalty.

By scoring his kick, Palmer became just the fifth England player to score his first senior goal for the national team via the penalty spot.

Unfortunately for him, he won't have many opportunities to bury them when Harry Kane is on the pitch.

21:21
63 up for kane

Harry Kane just can't stop scoring this season.

He now has 63 goals for his country, the most in Three Lions history, now 10 clear of the second place Wayne Rooney.

It's certainly not the best he has ever scored, but they all count.

21:18
Gareth Southgate: 'It was a good workout'

Gareth Southgate, England manager, speaking to Channel 4:

They were an opponent that were dogged, determined. Physically, it was a good workout but in the end, a good performance. The scoreline reflected the performance.
We had a lot of fresh players to bring in. Once you break that resistance then it starts to come. A lot players didn't have many caps that started so it was going to be a sticky start.
I thought they both [Eze and Palamer] played with the freedom. Ebere has got lovely movement to go past players, he's got power. A couple of times, Cole was being too precise and if he got his shots away earlier maybe he could've got a couple.

On Harry Kane and injuries:

Our plan today was half an hour and he'll [Kane] start on Friday. The great thing is we've got through the last few days with no new problems. That's really important. We needed to get through these first matches to get a clearer picture and the guys rehabbing have done well. A little bit [more selection headaches] but that's a good thing. I would rather have good performances than poor performances.
21:08
The striker dilemma...

Gareth Southgate has a dilemma on his hands in the striker department.

We now know that Harry Kane is starting on Friday against Iceland at Wembley, so what does that mean for Ivan Toney?

Ollie Watkins didn't exactly grab his chance with both hands today, but if Toney doesn't play, does that mean he is on the plane?

Or are all three going to go?

Honestly, I have no idea. I think Southgate should only take two, but I'm still not sure on who the second striker should be.

Is it too late to call Dominic Solanke?

I just have so many questions.

21:02
Cole Palmer: 'When it went in, I was buzzing'

Cole Palmer, England goalscorer, speaking to Channel 4:

It's a great feeling, my first goal for my country. When it went in, I was buzzing. Of course he [Kane] would've took it, it was just before he came on. Thankfully, I took it.
I hope [I have done enough to make the squad]. Tonight wasn't my best game, finding my feet on my first start but hopefully I've done enough.

20:59
Palmer impresses

We have to talk about Cole Palmer, don't we?

The Chelsea youngster was exceptional for the Blues in the Premier league this season, and it seems his form is continuing for his country.

He didn't start of the quickest, but as the game progressed he started to cause Bosnia more, and more, problems.

He eventually got his goal, his first for England, and he can leave Tyneside a very happy man.

Will he make the final 26-man squad, though?

20:54
Harry Kane: 'A really good game for us'

Harry Kane, England captain, speaking to Channel 4:

A really good game for us. It's been a good camp. For me it's about having a good week training. It's good preparation. Unbelievable season.
I'm feeling good, a lot of the end of the season was a precaution. In the end it was a good chance to get a good break. I've  had a good week training. I should be ready to go come the group stages. It's almost worked in my favour. It's just about getting minutes.
20:48
Should Trent be a starter?

Has Trent Alexander-Arnold just played himself into a starting spot at Euro 2024?

It took him a while to get going, but once he did, boy, oh boy, did he show just how good he is.

With his passing ability in the midfield along Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham, the blend in midfield would be beautiful.

I think he deserves a shot in there, especially after that.

20:42
WATCH: TAA's sublime volley for the second

I could watch this goal on repeat for a long time.

You can not underestimate how hard it is to execute a volley like that from that tight of an angle.

And the way Trent Alexander-Arnold just strolled away like nothing happened somehow made it even better.

If you haven't seen the goal, watch it.

20:37
FULL-TIME: England 3-0 Bosnia

Three goals and three points... oh wait., that's not how friendlies work is it.

England have got the job done. The score line may flatter them but they were so much better in the second half after a lacklustre first.

Cole Palmer got them on their way on the hour mark via the penalty spot, before Trent Alexander-Arnold and Harry Kane added two late goals.

There were some impressive performances from Palmer, and Eberechi Eze on debut too.

But in all honesty, I'm not sure how that perforamnce will help Gareth Southgate decide who he is going to cut.

20:36,
93'
England 3-0 Bosnia

In the celebrations of that third Jarrod Bowen looked gutted.

That's because he was set to net his first-ever England goal but, I'm not sure how, Ezri Konsa blocked the ball just as it was goal bound.

Konsa probably won't be getting invited to Bowen's birthday party after that.

20:34
FOUR added minutes

The board goes up and there will be four minutes of stoppage time.

The way England are suddenly play, I wouldn't be surprised to see another goal here.

20:31,
87'
GOAL!!! England 3-0 Bosnia (Kane 89')

I told you it would be 3-0!

It's nothing pretty, but England will take it.

It's the captain who has sealed the victory in scruffy fashion as he just about squeezes the ball home after pinball in the box.

He then wheels away and does his signature celebration.

That should be that.

20:31
England 2-0 Bosnia

That goal has woken up St James' Park!

The national anthem rings around the stadium just as play gets underway.

Its finally gotten noisey and it's lovely to see.

20:28,
85'
GOAL!!! England 2-0 Bosnia (Alexander-Arnold 85')

What a finish that is from Trent Alexander-Arnold!

The Liverpool man has been brilliant in this half and he has just showcased just how good his technique is with a sublime volley.

Jack Grealish clips a delightful ball towards Alexander-Arnold, who is in space on the right-hand side.

It looks like a tough angle but he strikes the ball so sweetly and back across goal into the side-netting.

He then simply strolls away with a smile on his face.

20:25,
82'
CLOSE! England 1-0 Bosnia

Ohhhh, I thought that was going to be two!

James Maddison looks like he is set to double the Three Lions' lead from six yards out but he slips as he pulls the trigger.

He does manage to get a shot away, but it squirms wide. Very close!

20:23,
80'
England 1-0 Bosnia

There are a ridiculous amount of bodies in the Bosnia penalty area.

Jarrod Bowen, James Maddison, and Harry Kane, all try to free up some space in the area but are hunted down like a pack of wolves.

I mean, it's brilliant team defending. Maybe I was too premature to predict more goals...

20:20,
77'
YELLOW CARD: England 1-0 Bosnia (Branthwaite)

First cap for England, first yellow card for England, for Jarrad Branthwaite.

He goes up for a header and leaves one on Gigovic. In truth, I think it's a harsh booking myself.

20:18,
74'
SUBSTITUTION: England 1-0 Bosnia

Gareth Southgate has decides to make another change.

There will be some more reshuffling at the back as Joe Gomez replaces Lewis Dunk, but he moves to left-back.

Ezri Konsa moves into the middle.

20:16,
73'
GOOD SAVE! England 1-0 Bosnia

Harry Kane is desperate for a goal here.

He surprises everbody by going for goal from distance and it's a good effort, but Vasilj.

We have seen him score them before, so cannot have a go at him.

20:15,
71'
CLOSE! England 1-0 Bosnia

This second goal is coming, it really isn't far away.

Harry Kane has been involved in everything since coming onto the pitch and he comes close to heading in a second.

He is off balance, though, as the ball finds his head three yards out.

20:12,
69'
England 1-0 Bosnia

Harry Kane tries to squeeze the ball into the near post from a James Maddison corner, but he jabs the ball wide.

I must admit, it is rather weird seeing him wear the number 20, and not the number nine.

It just doesn't feel right.

20:10,
68'
England 1-0 Bosnia

England sense blood here.

I feel the penalty may open the floodgates, they have been so much better in this second half.

I reckon this will end 3-0, so let's see if I am right. I am just glad the painful watch is over.

20:08,
63'
SUBSTITUTIONS: England 1-0 Bosnia

Harry Kane must be kicking himself, as soon as the penalty went in, he comes on as a substitute.

He comes onto replace Ollie Watkins while James Maddison also enters the fray, coming on for the goalscorer Cole Palmer.

There are some England debuts too, for Jarrad Branthwaite and 20-year-old Adam Wharton.

Eberechi Eze's debut has come to an end, Jack Grealish replaces him.

20:03,
60'
GOAL!!! England 1-0 Bosnia (Palmer pen 60')

Cole Palmer puts the penalty away... just about!

Palmer never misses and he keeps his record in tact by slotting it narrowly past the keeper into the bottom right corner.

He is a touch fortunate, the goalkeeper got a touch and maybe should have done better there.

He won't care though!

20:01
PENALTY TO ENGLAND!

Its been given!

It's a bit soft, but you can't pull defenders down like that, can you?

Harry Kane is about to come on, but not soon enough, Cole Palmer is standing over the spot.

20:01
POTENTIAL ENGLAND PENALTY

How did that miss all those bodies?

I was just expecting someone to turn home Jarrod Bowen's low cross, but nobody was there.

Oh wait... there could be a potential England penalty. Ezri Konsa was pulled down from a corner.

The referee goes to the screen.

19:59,
56'
England 0-0 Bosnia

Cole Palmer, that was your moment...

Jarrod Bowen finds him in the area and he has time and space, you just expect him to go for goal.

But he takes way too many touches and just doesn't pull the trigger quickly enough.

When he does, it gets blocked easily. That was a decent chance.

19:57,
54'
England 0-0 Bosnia

Trent Alexander-Arnold has found his passing range and it's making a huge difference.

He slides in a defence-splitting pass to Cole Palmer, who's shot is deflected wide.

A couple more chances come from the corner, but nothing doing.

I am at least being entertained now, aren't you?

19:55,
52'
England 0-0 Bosnia

England have certainly upped the pressure in the seven minutes after the break.

If they keep this up, a goal will come, they just need to keeping piling the pressure on.

19:53,
50'
England 0-0 Bosnia

That was very, very, nearly brilliant from England.

Trent Alexander-Arnold pings through his signature ball over the top and Ollie Watkins looks set to meet it.

But as the goalkeeper rushes out, Watkins can't get the contact he wants to send the ball past him. If he managed it, it would be 1-0.

A stunning pass, though, I must say.

19:50,
47'
England 0-0 Bosnia

That's already better from England.

Cole Palmer and Jarrod Bowen hunt down the Bosnia backline and win the ball high up the pitch before the former earns a corner.

From the set-piece, Ollie Watkins meets the ball but can't get a strong head on it.

A bit more lively.

19:48,
46'
SECOND HALF: England 0-0 Bosnia

Surely, this half of football can't be any worse than the first.

The ball is back rolling again, let's hope there is a bit more energy to this match in this 45 minutes.

Otherweise I will get the sleep mask out.

19:43
Joe Cole: 'It's been a bit too stagnant'

Joe Cole, former England midfielder, on Channel 4:

It's been a bit too stagnant. Gareth [Southgate] might look at changing a few to spark a few. It looks a bit lacklustre at the moment.
19:42
Rice and Grealish smiling

This is probably the most interesting thing to have happened tonight.

If nothing changes in thesecond half, this will be the highlights package...

Let's hope it does change for the better.

19:39
Lacklustre England

Those fan opinions sum this match up, so far.

It's been a lacklustre and sluggish performance. It's been extremely comfortable for Bosnia.

If England are going to challenge this summer, they certainly can't play like that, can they?

19:37
Fan opinions...
Anonymous: Well that’s 45 mins I will never get back . Predictable, lacklustre, boring, uninspiring. The list goes on….
Anonymous: England making Bosnia look like Brasil. What a waste of a warm-up match, playing players who will get nowhere near the final squad
Anonymous: I'm that bored with this I think I'll go and clean out the kitchen odds & ends drawer. See what I can find.
19:33
HALF-TIME: England 0-0 Bosnia

Thankfully, that half is over...

It's been a really poor 45 minutes of football. I would give you a proper summary, but there is not too much to say.

England have passed it about with little threat, and their shots have not caused many problems.

They need to be much better in the second half.

19:32
ONE added minute

This doesn't surprise me one bit, there is just one minute of stoppage time.

As the board goes up Jarrod Bowen has a pop at goal, but it goes straight down the throat of Vasilj.

19:29,
42'
CLOSE! England 0-0 Bosnia

That just sums up this England performance.

Marc Guehi lazily passes the ball across goal and it goes straight to Hajradinović.

The Bosnian forward doesn't hang about, he pulls the trigger and it goes narrowly wide thanks to a deflection.

Nothing comes from the corner, but that is a warning sign.

19:26,
40'
England 0-0 Bosnia

This match is just getting slower, and slower.

The pace is similar to what is played at my local Bowles club... which has an average age of over 70.

This is not the best advert for international football.

19:22
England 0-0 Bosnia

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at St James' Park:

I'm playing here in a media game on Wednesday... and I'm not sure the pace will be that much slower than what we're seeing now! It's all gone a bit pedestrian.
19:21,
34'
England 0-0 Bosnia

This is the poorest I have seen Cole Palmer play in a while.

He has just given the ball away outside the area, and just doesn't look comfortable.

It is his first start for his country, though, so I can't be too harsh.

19:16,
30'
YELLOW CARD: England 0-0 Bosnia (Guehi)

Wowzers, Marc Guehi flew into that challenge.

The centre-back is sold short by a poor pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold, and as he is chasing the ball he launches into a sliding tackle.

It's not a great one, and unsurprisingly, he gets a yellowcard.

19:15,
27'
CHANCE! England 0-0 Bosnia

Ohhh, Eberechi eze, that is classy!

He dances his way past several players before being wiped out. He is really enjoying himself out there.

Just as I am typing this Ezri Konsa forces a save from Vasilj with his feet, and he really should do better.

England are starting to wake up.

19:12
England 0-0 Bosnia

That's a little bit better from England.

Cole Palmer finally gets involved in the game by floating in a cross to the back post, but the ball is eventually cleared behind for a corner.

Ollie Watkins then thinks he is superman and chucks himself at Palmer's delivery, but the ball doesn't touch him.

It does bounce of a defender, though, and into the arms of Vasilj.

19:09,
24'
England 0-0 Bosnia

Not much is going on at St James' Park.

So, I thought Id' ask a question, what are you all having for dinner?

Yes, that's how eventless this game has been...

19:07
England 0-0 Bosnia

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at St James' Park:

As I'd expected, Eze has been the best of it for England so far. He's been direct and energetic, and has lifted the atmosphere when he has got motoring.

19:05,
19'
England 0-0 Bosnia

England fans cream 'shoooooot' and Conor Gallagher obliges.

I'm not sure why he did because his shot was very poor. He pulls the trigger from outside the area and it flies high and wide.

He had options too.

19:02
England 0-0 Bosnia

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at St James' Park:

Honesty probably cost Ollie Watkins as he shrugged off a defender to bring a save from the Bosnian goalkeeper. The defender was all over him and had he gone down he may well have got a penalty.

19:01,
15'
England 0-0 Bosnia

The Bosnian fans are louder than the England supporters at the moment.

It really is flat at St James' Park, a bit like the match unfolding in front of us.

This game just hasn't got going.

19:00,
14'
England 0-0 Bosnia

There's a break in play as Gazibegovic receives some treatment after a collison with Jarrod Bowen.

It really wasn't much, and unsurprisingly, the Bosnian man is ok to continue.

18:57,
10'
CHANCE! England 0-0 Bosnia

That's a big chance for Ollie Watkins.

The Aston Villa man is wrestling to break free in the area, and he does so well.

However, the angle is tight as he pulls the trigger and Vasilj makes the stop.

That's the first really positive thing the Three Lions have done.

18:53,
7'
England 0-0 Bosnia

It's free-kick galore at the moment.

First Conor Gallagher gets wiped out, and then a few moments later Kieran Trippier gives one back.

It's getting a little tasty...

18:51,
5'
England 0-0 Bosnia

I forgot to mention, England are playing in their away strip tonight, while Bosnia are playing in white.

The atmosphere is not quite as buzzing as it was before kick-off, but I'm sure that will change as England press forward.

They haven't done too much of it, so far.

Oh wait, just as I say that, Eberechi Eze wins a free-kick on the left-hand side outside the area.

But it comes to nothing...

18:48,
3'
England 0-0 Bosnia

As expected, England are having all the ball...

Trent Alexander-Arnold has already tried to launch one into the path of a chasing Ollie Watkins, but he overcooked the pass.

It seems the midfield are just rotating positions, but Conor Gallagher looks like he is the deepest.

18:46,
1'
KICK-OFF: England 0-0 Bosnia

The two captains shake hands, the players take their places, and the ball is now rolling.

Can England get their summer of football off to the perfect start, or will Bosnia take advantage of an experimental side?

We will find out over the course of the next 90 minutes...

18:44
‘I know that was then, but it could be again’

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at St James' Park:

A banner has been unveiled at the Gallowgate End saying: ‘I know that was then, but it could be again’. It’s a line from the Skinner and Baddiel ‘Three Lions’ hit that formed the background of England’s Euro 96 campaign.
That tournament ended at the semi-final stage of course. We just need a couple of steps further forward this time please.
18:42
Here come the teams!

Here they are, both teams arise from the tunnel with the sun in the background of St James' Park.

There is a huge England flag mosaic being displayed, but it comes down as the national anthems begin.

Bosnia go first, but how loud will 'God Save the King' sound?

18:39
Music blaring out at SJP

The music really is blasting out at St James Park.

DJ Schak is currently playing a remix of Smalltown Boy by Bronski Beat/Jimmy Somerville.

The original is a fantastic song, and to be fair to the DJ, the remix isn't too bad either.

18:35
10 minutes to go...

How excited is everybody?

I'll tell you all how I am feeling... fantastic. I love international football over the summer.

We are now just 10 minutes away from England's summer campaign getting underway.

They will be hoping today is a cracker.

18:32
'This feels like audition night'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport, at St James' Park:

This feels like audition night for several starters here. I can't wait to see how Eberechi Eze gets on. He's the one I'm backing to bolt into the squad, but that would need a top performance tonight.
18:31
Atmosphere building

St James' Park is vibing right now.

Newcastle is buzzing as kick-off closes in. The flags are out, hats are on, and the sun is shining too. Fantastic.

I have also found myself grooving to the beats of DJ Schak these last few minutes. It's groovy music!

18:25
How will TAA do in the middle?

I completely agree with Ian there.

It's going to be really interesting to see how Trent Alexander-Arnold does in midfield tonight.

We know he has the ability, his passing is simply sensational, but how will he cope in this system?

Tonight is his audition for a starting sport at Euro 2024. It's a tough ask, but he has the talent to partner Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice.

Arne Slot will almost certainly be watching how he fares tonight, as well.

18:20
'Trent Alexander-Arnold will be the focus of much attention'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at St James' Park:

Trent Alexander-Arnold will be the focus of much attention here tonight as he lines up in the centre of midfield.
Problem is that he needs the chance to show he can really do it against top class opposition. Bosnia’s FIFA ranking is 74, just a place below Northern Ireland
18:17
Missing out...

I wonder what is going through all of their heads?

I reckon it's something along the lines of 'I wish I was out there'.

There is a lot of talent on that bench watching the warm-up, but none of it will be used tonight.

I'd say at least three of the four players in this photo will certainly be on the plane, Harry Maguire, John Stones, and Bukayo Saka.

Mail Sport also understand Anthony Gordon should be ok too.

Still must feel rubbish for them.

Marc Guehi: 'We've got to focus on today first'

Marc Guehi, England defender, speaking to Channel 4:

I'm really glad to be here. It's always tough when you're injured. I was trying to focus on coming back as quick as possible.
It's always a good opportunity to pull on the shirt. Everyone's really excited. To actually potentially be involved would be amazing for all of us. We've got to focus on today first.

18:07
'I am not a fan of playing experimental teams'

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport Football Editor, at St James' Park:

I am not a fan of playing experimental teams ahead of big tournaments. I would rather England’s first team be given time to find a groove.
Almost impossible today, though. Too many injuries and players unavailable.
18:04
Big night for Eze

I'm extremely excited to see this man start tonight.

Eberechi Eze has been dazzling defences in recent months under Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace.

He certainly deserves his first-ever start tonight, it's his chance to shine, can he take it?

The midfielder looks nice and relaxed, that's for sure.

17:58
Slow starters

England's recent form has left a little to be desired.

The Three Lions are without a win in their last three matches, and they have conceded first in all of them.

It's unlike a Gareth Southgate side to start so slow, they had only conceded first in three of their previous 14 games games before that.

They won't want to do the same tonight, they haven't conceded first in four games in a row for 39 years...

That's a very long time. I wasn't even born.

17:54
FULL-TIME: Gibraltar 0-2 Scotland

The Tartan Army get the job done in Portugal.

After hammering away at the Gibraltar defence, they finally managed to break it in the second half.

Goals from Ryan Christie and Che Adams seal teh deal for them and they start their road to Germany off with a bang.

I bet they are gutted the game is over, it looks gorgeous over there.

17:50
No Jude

So, where is Jude Bellingham?

Now that the team news is out and he is not in it, I thought I would elaborate on why.

Unless you have been living under a rock, Bellingham has been celebrating becoming a king of Europe the past few days.

He got his hands on the Champions League on Saturday, and has been loving life ever since.

England will be hoping that's not the only European trophy he wins this summer.

17:44
GOAL!!! Gibraltar 0-2 Scotland (Adams 85')

And that should be that!

Oooft, that is some hit by Che Adams. The ball is floated over to the back post and he smashes a volley home.

That's all she wrote, and Scotland have finished it in style with a stunning goal.

17:40
Bosnia and Herzegovina Team News - Dzeko BENCHED

Well, well, well... Edin Dzeko does not start.

Sheffield United defender, Anel Ahmedhodzic, does though. The last time he played at St James' Park, he scored.

Although, his team did get battered 5-1 by Newcastle, in the end.

17:35
England Team News - Palmer and Eze START

The waiting is over... here is the team news.

As expected, Gareth Southgate has given opportunities to those who don't get them too often.

Cole Palmer and Eberechi Eze will start in a Three Lions team for the very first time, while Ollie Watkins gets the nod ahead of Ivan Toney up top.

Trent Alexander-Arnold will be deployed as a midfielder it seems, which is what we have come to expect under Southgate.

Let's see what they can do then, eh?

17:29
Fans arriving at SJP

The excitement is starting to build on Tyneside.

As kick-off approaches, the fans are starting to flock towards St james' park for the action.

There are some happy faces in there, and also some impressive tattoos. Seriously special artwork there, wow.

17:23
Toney or Watkins?

If Harry Kane isn't starting tonight, who is?

His undertsudy's, Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney are lying in waiting and one will get the call tonight at St James' Park.

Tonight could be huge for both of them, it's a chance to make a statement to Gareth Southgate that they deserve to be on the plane to Germany.

You never know, he may pick both, but equally, he may not.

Whoever gets the nod tonight has to take their opportunity.

17:16
GOAL!!! Gibraltar 0-1 Scotland (Christie 59')

Scotland have finally broken the deadlock!

It's not the prettiest goal you will ever see, but they won't care.

A cross finds it's way to Ryan Christie on the right-hand side of the area, and after the ball bumbles and bounces around a little bit, he fires it into the top corner.

The celebrations are muted, but the Scots are still smiling in the Portugal sunshine.

17:12
Marc Guehi in line to start England's opening Euro 2024 fixture against Serbia

Well, it seems we know one player that won't be cut...

Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi is expected to start England's Euro 2024 opener against Serbia, Mail Sport's Sami Mokbel has revealed.

The centre-back is in line to start the tournament instead of Harry Maguire, who is still struggling with injury.

It's a huge chance for Guehi, and he is set to start tonight also, alongside Lewis Dunk, we understand.

I guess we have to see what he has got. Going off his club form, England are in good hands.

For the full story, read below:

Guehi in line to start England's opening Euro 2024 game against Serbia
England head coach Southgate ruled Maguire, who is suffering with a calf injury, out of contention for Monday's friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mail Online

17:07
Who would you cut?

It's time to be brutal.

We know that the 33-man squad can not go to Germany, it has to be cut down by seven players.

It may even be more, Gareth Southgate does not have to take 26 players if he doesn't want to (I think he should though).

So, if you were in his shoes, who would you leave out?

Let us know your seven players in the comments.

17:04
Second half underway for the Scots

Right, over in Portugal, Scotland are back in action after the break.

Can they start to take some of their chances, or is their a shock on the cards?

I guess we will find out over the next 45 minutes!

17:00
Kieran Trippier: 'We can go all the way'

Kieran Trippier, England full-back, speaking on Sunday:

I've said it many times, we shouldn't be shy to say that we can win it. We're not saying that in an arrogant way. We've got a great squad, top manager, top stuff. We've been so close recently over so many years and it's just about taking that next step now.
I fully believe with the squad that we've got, we can go all the way. The most important thing is that [the] togetherness that we've got in the squad is unbelievable, probably the best I've been involved.

16:56
Kieran Trippier to captain Three Lions tonight

So, we already know that Kieran Trippier is going to start.

The 33-year-old will lead England out on to the turf he plays on every week for his club.

This means that Harry Kane will not be starting tonight, so who will lead the line instead?

16:51
All square at the break in the Algarve

Scotland are certainly not having it their own way.

The whistle has been blown for the break and neither Scotland nor Gibraltar have found the back of the net as of yet.

The Scots have been in control and had lots of chances, but ultimately, they just have not been clinical.

You do feel it won't be too long until they are, though.

16:47
Gareth Southgate: 'Time is our friend this week'

Gareth Southgate, England manager, speaking on Sunday:

I think we know where we’re likely to be. Time is our friend this week. It’s worth using the time. Tomorrow’s game could throw up another physical issue and then we’ve got something else in the mix.
We think we know who the best have been across the season, what we don’t totally know is how many we need to take or how many we can allow ourselves to take because of the cover we might need in other positions as well.

16:43
Not all England fans support Southgate...

This has blown me away...

Foobtlla fans love to shout out their opinions, it's what makes being a fan so great, everyone is entitled to theirs.

However, these statistics have blown me away.

Ahead of tonight’s friendly, new stats from free-to-play game Sorare Rivals shows that 40% of England fans say if called on tomorrow, they could do as good or better a job than Gareth Southgate.

We can also reveal the England Fans’ starting XI, if they were in charge: Harry Kane (66% would pick), Jude Bellingham (62%), Phil Foden (62%), Kyle Walker (54%), Declan Rice (53%), Bukayo Saka (51%), Jordan Pickford (45%), John Stones (44%), Harry Maguire (35%), Trent Alexander-Arnold (35%) and Kieran Trippier (35%).

Do you agree?

16:36
Three Lions arrive on Tyneside

Here they are, the England boys are in the building.

With just over two hours until kick-off, Gareth Southgate and his side have arrived at St James' Park.

Which players will make the starting 11, though?

We are just going to have to wait for a little while.

16:30
Who is unavailable tonight?

While there are 33 names on the list just shown, not all are available for action tonight.

Gareth Southgate could be without nine players this evening...

Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, and Anthony Gordon are set to miss out as they are recovering from injury.

Meanwhile Bukayo Saka is being rested and John Stones joined up late with the squad, so both won't be available for selection.

The list doesn't stop quite yet.

Kobbie Mainoo, Kyle Walker and Phil Foden have not yet joined up with the squad after the FA Cup final, and Jude Bellingham is set for a week off after winning the Champions League with Real Madrid on Saturday.

There should be lots of opportunities for the fringe players tonight, shouldn't there?

16:22
England’s provisional Euro 2024 squad

I think we should remind ourselves of the training squad Gareth Southgate selected.

Tonight isn't just about getting the squad ready for Euro 2024, it's also an audition night for some of the fringe players.

So, who are the 33 players in the squad? Here is the list:

Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), James Trafford (Burnley)

Defenders: Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Lewis Dunk (Brighton), Joe Gomez (Liverpool), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Jarell Quansah (Liverpool), Luke Shaw (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Kieran Trippier (Newcastle), Kyle Walker (Manchester City)

Midfielders: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Curtis Jones (Liverpool), Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace)

Forwards: Jude Bellingham, (Real Madrid), Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Jack Grealish (Manchester City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), James Maddison (Tottenham), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)

16:18
Three Lions last visit to SJP...

Want to see how England fared in their last visit to St James' Park? Of course, you do.

Cast your minds back 19 years, a team filled with superstars under Sven-Goran Eriksson faced Azerbaijan.

Unsurprisingly, they came out on top 2-0.

David Beckham scored the second, but here is a video of the first goal that night, from Steven Gerrard.

What a team that was... enjoy!

16:12
Tonight’s venue

Wembley has seen a lot of action in the last few weeks, but it is being given a rest tonight.

Instead, the mammoth St James' Park, home of Newcastle United, will play host to England and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

This is the first Three Lions match being played at St James’ Park since 2005.

England hold a good record at the home of the Geordies, they have not lost any of their last four matches there while also not conceding in any.

Good omens...

16:07
A first meeting

There is always a first time for everything.

Tonight is the very first time that an England side will face a Bosnia and Herzegovina team. It’s not often the Three Lions have not faced a nation, is it?

So, they won’t be able to call on past experiences.

However, that really doesn’t matter these days. England’s backroom staff will have done so much analysis on this Bosnian side.

The majority of people watching this game tonight will already think the result is a done deal. Whatever team Gareth Southgate puts out should take home the win.

Bosnia may have players like Edin Dzeko – former Manchester City striker – but as favourites for Euro 2024, anything less than a win is not a great start.

Let’s see what they have in store for us.

16:02
Underway in the Algarve

As I have already said, it's not just England in action tonight.

Scotland's final preparations for Euro 2024 are now officially underway, their friendly against Gibralter has just kicked off.

There are virtually no fans in the stands, but it is truly a sight to behold.

I hop the Scots have their sun cream on!

16:00
Road to the Euro 2024 begins…

It all starts today… the final route to Germany!

I am currently typing this post with a massive smile on my face as the summer of international football is about to begin.

England’s final preparations for Euro 2024 begin at 7.45pm tonight as they face Bosnia and Herzegovina at St James’ Park.

It’s the first of two friendlies this week that will help Gareth Southgate decide who will make his final squad for the competition that starts in under two weeks.

Elsewhere, just this second, Scotland have kicked off their first preparation friendly against Gibraltar in Algarve, Portugal. I have to tell you, the scenery there is truly stunning.

We will be giving you major updates from Steve Clarke’s side’s friendly in the build-up to the Three Lions’ clash.

Right, that’s enough of an introduction, don’t you think?
