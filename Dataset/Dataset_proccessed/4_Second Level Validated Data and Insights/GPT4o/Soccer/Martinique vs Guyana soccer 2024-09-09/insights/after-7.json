        "The Golden Jaguars will look to bounce back against Martinique in League A.",
        "Coach Jamaal Shabazz\u2019s side will be looking to bounce back after a 3-1 home defeat to Suriname last Thursday.",
        "Omari Glasgow has scored 17 times for the Golden Jaguars and is just one goal shy of tying the country\u2019s all-time record, set by Nigel Codrington.",
        "Despite the opening setback, Shabazz remains optimistic. 'When you\u2019re in League A, you want to stay up. It took Guyana ten years to reach this level. One loss won\u2019t break our spirits,' he said.",
        "Acknowledging the challenge of facing Martinique, Shabazz added, 'We know it\u2019s a tough assignment, but these are the moments we\u2019ve worked hard to reach. Now, we\u2019re going to battle it out and see where it takes us.'",
        "After the defeat to Suriname, team captain Elliot Bonds reflected on their performance. He noted that while the team made individual mistakes, the match against Martinique offers a chance for redemption. 'We know what needs to be done. The 3-1 loss was down to our own errors, but we\u2019re learning from it and know where to improve,' Bonds said.",
        "With just four days between games, Bonds emphasized the need to move forward quickly. 'There\u2019s no time to dwell on it. We\u2019ll review the game, make adjustments, and focus on what\u2019s next,' he added.",
        "It will be interesting to see Shabazz\u2019s approach against Martinique, a team they last faced in 2017, ending in a scoreless draw at Mackenzie Sports Club Ground in Linden.",
        "Martinique, playing at home, have won four and lost one of their last five matches, scoring and conceding four goals in that period.",
        "In the Nations League, they\u2019ve played 12 matches, winning two, drawing five, and losing five. Meanwhile, Guyana has played 17 Nations League matches, winning 11, drawing twice, and losing four.",
        "The Golden Jaguars have struggled on the road, with one win and four losses in their last five away games, while Martinique have two wins, two draws, and one loss in their last five outings."
