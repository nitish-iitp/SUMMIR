The top two finishers from the group, which also comprises Costa Rica and Guadeloupe, will advance to the quarterfinal section in November.

Guyana sealed their qualification to League A in the CONCACAF Nations League following a 5-0 record in Group D in League B.

The Guyanese defeated Antigua and Barbuda [5-1, 6-0], the Bahamas [3-2], and Puerto Rico [3-1, 3-1]. In the 2022-2023 edition of League B, Guyana ended up in second place with 10 points. In the inaugural 2019–2020 edition, Guyana finished in the runner-up spot in league B with nine points.

According to CONCACAF, League A comprises 16 teams and a quarterfinal section, with 12 teams battling in an initial group stage format utilising the ‘Swiss Format’, as each team will play two home fixtures and as many away matches.

The release stated, “After Group Stage play in September and October 2024, the first and second-place finishers of each group (four teams in total) will advance to the Quarterfinals, where they will join the four top-ranked League A teams (Mexico, the United States, Panama, and Canada).”

The release further stated, “The quarterfinals will be played in a home-and-away format, with the aggregate score winner in each matchup advancing to the 2025 Concacaf Nations League Finals.”
