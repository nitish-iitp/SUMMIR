Post-match postbag. “Karl Darlow has played very well and could have played himself as No 1. Nico Williams has run his socks off. Harry Wilson same with a belting goal to boot. We looked significantly less secure when Connor Roberts came off, replacing him with Brennan Johnson didn’t work. All told, good value for all S4C viewers” – David Bowen

Kieffer Moore talks to S4C after Wales’ hard-fought victory in Montenegro. “We’re really happy … it was very tough … gruelling … you can tell by the conditions and how wet I am! … we knew we had to lay a marker straight away … when a ball falls to you that nicely you have to put it away … there’s been a lot of information for all of us … it’s coming along really well and we’re really enjoying it.”

In retrospect, the job was done after two-and-a-half whirlwind minutes. But Montenegro had their chances afterwards, and will wonder how they didn’t at least earn a point. The Craig Bellamy revolution continues apace!

GOAL! Norway 2-1 Austria (Haaland 83). Erling Haaland didn’t get a shot on target against Kazakhstan on Friday. He hadn’t had one tonight, either … until now. Some stories write themselves. This dude is a force of nature.

France 2-0 Belgium. Kylian Mbappé barrels down the left this time, and very nearly plants a low drive across Koen Casteels and into the bottom right. Inches wide of the post. The man looks in the mood to prove a point.

Montenegro 1-2 Wales. “This has been riotous entertainment so far,” writes David Bowen. “Could easily have been 5-2 to Montenegro on another night. The goal was definitely coming and Montenegro look likely again. This is where Craig Bellamy earns his corn to keep him in box-fresh trainers and high-end bomber jackets.”

France 2-0 Belgium. Kylian Mbappé is on for France, and already causing Belgium problems. His powerful run down the inside-right channel ends with a fierce shot from a tight angle that Koen Casteels does well to block and turn around the post. Nothing comes from the resulting corner.

Norway 1-1 Austria. Some worrying news for Arsenal (and indeed Norway) fans. “Ødegård had to leave the match with what looked like a serious ankle injury,” reports Henning Reinton. Looks like he was carted off the pitch in tears, unable to put much, if any, weight on his leg. God speed, Martin.

GOAL! Montenegro 1-2 Wales (Camaj 73)

Yes, well, sorry for mentioning that. The hosts finally find the net, and it had been coming. A simple enough goal, Nikola Krstović turning the Welsh defence and chasing a long punt down the right, drawing Karl Darlow, then crossing for Driton Camaj to slam into the open goal.

Montenegro 0-2 Wales. Montenegro must be wondering how they’ve not scored tonight. Stevan Jovetić sends a diving header towards the bottom right, but Karl Darlow somehow shovels it around the post, and nothing comes of the corner. Craig Bellamy may be proving himself a football genius since taking over as Wales boss, but he’s also leading something of a charmed life tonight.

Montenegro 0-2 Wales. Another close thing for the hosts. Vladimir Jovović takes a speculative whack from 25 yards, the shot pinging off the inside of the left-hand post and away. That’s the second time Montenegro have rattled the frame of Karl Darlow’s goal. The ball rebounds to Nikola Krstović, who should slot into an unguarded net from six yards, Darlow having launched himself towards the initial shot, but somehow skies over the bar. Krstović’s blushes are spared, sort of, when the flag pops up correctly for offside.

GOAL! France 2-0 Belgium (Dembélé 57)

Ousmane Dembélé has copped plenty of stick for a lack of end product. But he delivers here. He sashays in from the right flank and sends a rising, swerving shot into the top-left corner from just inside the box. The hosts on course to bounce back from the disappointing Italy defeat.

Montenegro 0-2 Wales. A huge chance for Montenegro to halve the Welsh lead. A cross looped in from the left. Stefan Mugoša is all alone, ten yards out, but can only send a weak downward header miles wide right.

Montenegro 0-2 Wales. Brennan Johnson cuts in from the left and, despite having three red shirts around him, manages to unleash a rising shot that heads towards the top-left corner and stings home keeper Milan Mijatović’s hands. Fine football all round.

Montenegro 0-2 Wales. A couple of Montenegro corners in quick succession. Wales deal with them easily enough, but they’re sitting back and inviting trouble. Everything happening in the visitors’ half. It’s still tipping down, as well.

France 1-0 Belgium. The hosts begin the second period looking for another goal. All the play in the Belgium half, but the visitors are holding them at arm’s length right now. The final ball lacking.

Montenegro 0-2 Wales. The hosts have started the second half as they ended the first: on the front foot but unable to find a way through. There’s also a spot of bother for Neco Williams, who is booked for his part in a brouhaha over a throw-in with Miloš Brnović. The Montenegro player goes into the notebook as well.

The matches have restarted all across Europe. “It’s still pouring down here in Nikšić but the Montenegro FA have kindly allocated us seats in the only stand with a roof,” reports Wales fan Alun Pugh. “The locals are getting a drenching out in the open. We are singing ‘we’re covered in’ as a thank you. This might not go the 90 minutes given the rain as the ball is not rolling properly. 0-2 flatters us. Jam side up indeed.”

More half-time entertainment. “Nice unexpected Tommy Handley reference,” begins Sam Bain, one of the geniuses behind Peep Show, I’ll be bound. “My grandfather Ronald Frankau was in a comedy double act with him called Murgatroyd and Winterbottom. Although if he had been in a double act with Benjamin Sesko, they probably would have scored a lot more goals.”

Well that’s this evening’s internet rabbit hole sorted. I defy anyone not to splutter out loud when their faces first appear at the start of this clip. Magnificent.
