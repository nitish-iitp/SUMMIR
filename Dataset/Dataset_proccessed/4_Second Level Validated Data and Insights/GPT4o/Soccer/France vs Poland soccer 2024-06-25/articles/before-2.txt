France boss Didier Deschamps has expressed his concern that playing with a mask could limit Kylian Mbappe’s vision at Euro 2024.

Mbappe broke his nose in France’s opening match of the tournament against Austria, but having been fitted with a special mask - including one with the French tricolour on to wear at training - he was included in the squad for the goalless draw with the Netherlands.

He failed to make it off the bench against the Dutch, but could now feature in France’s final match of the group stages against Poland in Dortmund on Tuesday.

When asked if the mask was inhibiting his star striker, Deschamps said: “Breathing no, but the way he sees yes.

“I’ve never had to play with a mask, but I imagine for those that have it’s not something that is comfortable.

“I wouldn’t say that it’s a constraint per se, but it does limit your vision, but the reason he is wearing the mask is because he needs to protect his face in certain instances that could occur. But yes I imagine that it does limit his vision.”

Deschamps fielded questions about Mbappe at his press conference prior to the clash with Poland, but remained tight-lipped over whether or not he would feature.

"He's getting better every day," said Deschamps. "Yesterday he was in our training session and the bruise has gone down a lot. He is getting used to playing with the mask.

"He wants to play, he's raring to go, he wanted to play against the Netherlands and he wants to play against Poland."

France's only goal in their two matches thus far was an own goal scored by Austria's Maximilian Wober, and that lack of ruthlessness in front of goal coupled with Mbappe's injury had lead to concerns about their cutting edge in attack, with changes called for by many in France.

Deschamps dismissed concerns though, saying: "No, I've got a cool head. I keep my head on my shoulders. I do everything I can with my staff to ensure that everything goes swimmingly, and then obviously we can't control what's going on on the pitch.

"But I'm not worried, per se, no. I would have preferred that we scored a little bit more, then we'd have had two more points in the bag, but we've got a third game to play."
