Kylian Mbappe teases Euro 2024 France comeback with brace in Paderborn friendly
By Ben Knapton, Senior Reporter

France attacker Kylian Mbappe reportedly scored twice and laid on two assists in a behind-closed-doors friendly ahead of his expected Euro 2024 comeback.

The Real Madrid-bound 25-year-old did not play a part in Friday's goalless draw with the Netherlands after breaking his nose in Les Bleus' opening Group D battle with Austria.

After providing the assist for France's winner - which came via the head of Austria defender Maximilian Wober - Mbappe smashed his face into Kevin Danso's shoulder and sported a blood-stained shirt in the aftermath.

What followed was a substitution farce, as the on-field referee did not allow France a break in play to make their changes, leading to Mbappe to come back onto the pitch without permission in order to get the game stopped, being booked for his troubles.

The former Paris Saint-Germain winger quickly returned to training with a specially designed mask embellished with the colours of the French flag, their emblem and his initials, although he can only wear a plain one during matches.

Mbappe was part of the France matchday squad for the stalemate with the Netherlands, but despite Les Bleus' struggles to break down the Oranje defence, Deschamps decided against risking him for the contest.

Paderborn players 'told to go easy' on Mbappe

However, the 25-year-old was back in action on Saturday, taking part in a training match against Paderborn's Under-21s alongside his fellow compatriots who also did not start the clash with the Netherlands.

According to FutbolFantasy, Mbappe put in a strong shift with two goals and two assists in the victory, playing both 30-minute halves with a black mask and coming out unscathed.

Paderborn's players were apparently told not to go in too hard on Mbappe in order to let the Frenchman enjoy a simple re-integration into the team, and all the signs are now pointing towards an imminent comeback.

PSG's all-time leading scorer is therefore expected to be 100% operational for France's final group game of the European Championships, which sees Deschamps's men take on already-eliminated Poland at the Westfalenstadion on Tuesday evening.

Les Bleus sit second in the section on account of an inferior goal difference to the Netherlands, who take on Austria - just one point adrift of both sides in third place - at the same time on June 25.

France need just a point to assure themselves of a top-two finish, but they would likely qualify for the last 16 as one of the best third-placed sides even if both results go against them.
