Ben Fisher was at the BVB Stadion Dortmund this afternoon, and his verdict has landed. Here it is! Congratulations/commiserations to France, just commiserations to Poland, and thanks for reading this MBM.

France’s failure to hold onto that lead is costly. They’re now in the same side of the draw as hosts Germany, Spain and Portugal. Should England win Group C tonight, they’d be in the other half, with a route to the final that on paper looks significantly easier. Then again, Austria. And if they don’t, chances are they’ll be playing Germany in the next round. Probably wisest to wait and see how it all comes down, though where’s the fun in that?

Austria have beaten the Netherlands, and so it’s Ralf Rangnick’s vibrant side who finish top of Group D. France go through in second place, which they can hardly complain about, seeing they’ve only got one penalty and an own goal to their name in three matches. The Dutch are guaranteed to make it through as one of the four best third-place finishers.

13.57 EDT
FULL TIME: France 1-1 Poland

The whistle goes. A valedictory draw for the Poles, who thoroughly deserved it. France were disappointing and are disappointed. Mbappé sad rather than angry, perhaps there wasn’t so much in that late penalty shout after all.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.55 EDT

90 min +5: Mbappe tries to spin Dawidowicz on the edge of the box. Dawidowicz clatters into him. It looks like a penalty, but neither referee nor VAR agrees. Didier Deschamps is livid.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.54 EDT

90 min +4: Kounde instigates some pinball in the Poland box after crossing low from the right. Again the ball’s blootered long by Poland, who are determined not to go out of Euro 2024 with a record of three defeats.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.53 EDT

90 min +3: Świderski is booked for a preposterous rugby tackle on Hernandez. He goes into the book, and the resulting free kick is sent into the mixer from the left, and clanked out of play by Upamecano.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.52 EDT

90 min +2: Mbappé drops a shoulder to come in from the left, but can’t make a decent shooting opportunity for himself. Eventually in desperation he takes a whack, but it’s predictably deflected and loops harmlessly into the arms of Skorupski.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.50 EDT

90 min +1: Mbappe probes down the left but there’s nobody in the middle to find. He settles for a corner, and swings it in himself. Poland hoick it clear.

90 min: There will be five additional minutes.

89 min: Giroud spins Dawidowicz, who takes one for the team by cynically checking his man. Into the book he goes.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.48 EDT

88 min: Mbappe takes a whack on the mask from Lewandowski. Accidental, as the pair competed for possession, but that’s gotta hurt.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.47 EDT

86 min: A corner from the left leads to a corner from the right. And from that second one, the ball drops to Griezmann in space on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. Everyone expects the net to bulge, but Skorupski tips away at the striker’s feet. What a game the Polish reserve keeper has had!

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.46 EDT

85 min: Mbappe releases Kounde down the inside-right channel with a glorious defence-splitting back-flick. Kounde cuts back for Giroud, who has a first-time swing at the ball. It deflects off Bednarek, who spreads himself bravely. Corner coming up. Before it can be taken, Randal Kolo Muani comes on for Dembele.

25 Jun 2024
13.44 EDT

84 min: Poland are on top. Moder floats a cross in from the right for Lewandowski, whose earlier mugging of Tchouameni has sparked something in the Poles. Upamecano is forced to head behind under serious pressure. Nothing comes of the corner, but France are suddenly hanging on a bit here.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.42 EDT

82 min: France are rocking now. Fofana comes on for Tchouameni. Then Lewandowski – who has now scored in four separate Euros - steps into the box from the left and lashes a rising drive inches over the bar. This is great fun!

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.41 EDT

80 min: While that was going on, the Dutch equalised against Austria … only for Ralf Rangnick’s side to retake the lead again soon after! All of which means Group D now looks like this …

GOAL! France 1-1 Poland (Lewandowski 79 pen)

… but VAR gets involved! Maignan had come fractionally off his line, and Lewandowski is gifted a second chance! He does the tippy-toes again, and sends it towards the bottom left again, but this time there’s more power behind the penalty and he tucks it tight into the corner! What drama!

77 min: Lewandowski misses! He stops mid-run, performing the tippy-toes, and can only scuff towards the bottom left. Easy for Maignan to tip away! What an awful penalty!

25 Jun 2024
13.36 EDT
Penalty for Poland

76 min: VAR gets involved, and Upamecano did indeed clip his opponent on the heel. There wasn’t much in it … but there was enough in it. Lewandowski to take.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.35 EDT

74 min: End-to-end drama as Upamecano appears to clip Świderski from behind in the box. No penalty, according to the referee. France go up the other end, where Mbappe is teed up on the edge of the D by Dembele. Mbappe sidefoots weakly straight at Skorupski. But hold on…

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.33 EDT

73 min: That was brilliant play by Lewandowski, and perhaps it’s woken France up, because they’ve been strangely passive for the last few minutes. Mbappe attempts to dribble into the Poland box down the left but can’t fashion space to shoot.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.32 EDT

72 min: Lewandowski, who has been feeding on scraps, takes matters into his own hands and strips the snoozing Tchouameni of possession, 35 yards from goal. He turns and steams towards the French box, fizzing a low drive inches wide of the left-hand post. Maignan probably had it covered, though he was diving across in desperation.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.30 EDT

70 min: A lot of space for Hernandez out on the left. His low cross is easily mopped up by the Polish defence, because there’s nobody in blue in the middle. The ball, begging to be rammed home, deserved better.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.29 EDT

69 min: Tchouameni and Lewandowski race to meet a loose ball in midfield. A clatter. Lewandowski takes a sore one on the lug, and he’s not happy about it, but there’s no official censure.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.27 EDT

68 min: Poland make a double change. Sebastian Szymański and Nicola Zalewski are replaced by Karol Świderski and Michał Skóraś.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.27 EDT

67 min: Dembele drops deep and attempts to find Mbappé with a clever long pass down the inside-right channel. Skorupski reads the danger and races out of his box to blooter clear.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.26 EDT

66 min: Griezmann takes a whack from the edge of the D. It’s not a particularly good shot, but it gets deflected wide left for a corner that Griezmann takes himself. Another wasted corner.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.25 EDT

65 min: Poland haven’t really responded to falling behind, and France are strolling around in the content style. Nothing much happening right now, in other words.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.23 EDT

63 min: Dembele once again romps into acres down the right. Does he shoot? Does he cross? It’s not clear. Goal kick.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.22 EDT

62 min: A triple change by France. N’Golo Kanté, Adrien Rabiot and Bradley Barcola make way for Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud and Eduardo Camavinga. Giroud is making his 33rd appearance at a major tournament for France, a new mark that usurps the previous record-holder Lilian Thuram.

60 min: Barcola turns Bednarek inside out as he sashays down the left. He enters the box and shoots from a tight angle. Another confident stop by Skorupski, who has been Poland’s man of the match so far.

25 Jun 2024

58 min: It’s fair to say that goal had been coming. But France had been getting a little frustrated at their inability to break the deadlock, so Kiwior did them a big favour there.

GOAL! France 1-0 Poland (Mbappé 56 pen)

Mbappé opens his body and, having sent Skorupski the wrong way, slots calmly into the bottom right. He swipes off his mask to soak up the applause. That’s his first goal at a European Championship finals, and the first goal scored by a French player in this tournament!

55 min: Dembele turns on the jets and flies down the inside-right channel. He enters the box. Kiwior sticks out a leg and Dembele doesn’t need asking twice. He goes over it, and the referee immediately points to the spot.

53 min: Hernández comes clattering into Bednarek. He’s comedically late, and fortunate to escape a booking. Poland coach Michał Probierz isn’t so fortunate, though; he’s shown yellow for telling it to referee Marco Guida as he sees it.

25 Jun 2024
13.11 EDT

51 min: Poland haven’t really come out for the second half yet. France had gotten on top towards the end of the first period, and they continue to look by far the most likely.

Share
25 Jun 2024
13.10 EDT

50 min: Mbappe isn’t going to stop trying. He whips a low shot across Skorupski and inches wide of the right-hand post. “How much mayonnaise do Hellmans have to sell before they get a return on their investment in pitchside adverts?” wonders Gary Naylor. “Answer in swimming pools please.” Gotta say, I haven’t even noticed their ads, so best of luck to them, though Heinz make a better mayo in my book, and in any case salad cream tops the lot. (That may finally get me sacked by the Guardian. So be it.)

48 min: Dembele breezes down the right and cuts back for Kante, whose shot is deflected wide right. Once again, the resulting corner is a non-event.

47 min: The Dutch have already equalised against Austria. Barry Glendenning has the details and now the group looks like this …

After a brief wait for Mbappé to secure his mask, and the referee to source a ball to play with, France get the second half underway. No changes. “Has anyone called him Mbappman yet?” wonders Craig Sinnamon. “The m€rch po$$ibilitie$…” A cursory glance at X suggests you might need to get your skates on to secure the intellectual property.

HALF TIME: France 0-0 Poland

Both teams have given it a good go; both have had their chances; neither have managed to find the net. France were beginning to crank up the pressure towards the end of the half, though. As things stand, with Austria leading the Netherlands 1-0 at the break, Group D looks like this …

45 min: … and now Mbappe finds himself in more space down the left! He shoots from a tight angle but can’t force the ball past Skorupski, who blocks with his feet at the near post and is having quite the game. Again, the corner leads to nothing.

42 min: Barcola spins elegantly down the inside-left channel and into the box. He’s not able to shoot, though, because Mbappe takes charge and flicks a cute shot across the keeper. Skorupski sticks out a strong arm to deflect the ball inches wide of the right-hand post. Great play all round. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.
