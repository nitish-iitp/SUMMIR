        "\u0141ukasz Skorupski, Poland goalkeeper: 'I always want to be ready. I haven't had many chances with the team despite being in the Poland camp for many years. I think I showed today that if [Wojciech] Szcz\u0119sny decides to retire I'm ready to be No1. I learnt I was playing two days ago in training. The coach asked me if I was ready ... and I told him that I am. I think I repaid his faith in me.'",
        "Didier Deschamps, France coach: 'I'm not disappointed at all. Of course we wanted top spot but who was just here? [Skorupski]. He was excellent, he made a lot of saves; you have to give credit to the goalkeeper. You can have two chances and score two. You can have seven as we did today and not score. I'd be more worried if there were no chances.'",
        "Micha\u0142 Probierz, Poland coach: 'I would like to thank the fans for turning out today despite us being eliminated. We fought until the end, and we had some really good spells \u2013 that's how I want to play football going forward. I want to thank the players for their commitment \u2013 it's a shame we couldn't qualify. It's a pity we have to leave.'"
