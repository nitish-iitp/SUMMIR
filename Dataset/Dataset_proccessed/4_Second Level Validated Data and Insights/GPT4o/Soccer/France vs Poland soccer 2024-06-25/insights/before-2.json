        "Deschamps fielded questions about Mbappe at his press conference prior to the clash with Poland, but remained tight-lipped over whether or not he would feature.",
        "Deschamps said: 'He wants to play, he's raring to go, he wanted to play against the Netherlands and he wants to play against Poland.'",
