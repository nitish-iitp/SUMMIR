        "Botswana kicked off their quest for a place in Morocco with a 2-0 win over Cape Verde.",
        "Despite having over 75% of the possession and more than 25 shots on target, Cape Verde were left empty-handed as Tumisang Orebonye's second-minute strike was enough to give Botswana all three points.",
        "Botswana, currently 147th in the latest FIFA World Ranking, will now be looking to record back-to-back wins for the first time since July 2023 and move up to second place in Group C.",
        "The Zebras will be aiming to make their second appearance at the AFCON, having made their first appearance in 2012 when they were knocked out at the group stage after losing all three of their Group D matches.",
        "For Cape Verde, Thursday's defeat brought their quest for a third consecutive AFCON back down to earth, with just three points from their opening three games.",
        "Cape Verde go into Tuesday's clash on the back of four defeats in their last six matches in all competitions, including a 4-1 loss to Cameroon in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, but they have taken seven points from four games and sit third in Group D, one point off the summit."
