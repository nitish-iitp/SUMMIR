IN GOOD SPIRITS—The Flames
SHARE

Malawi National Football Team, the Flames, face one of their biggest tests when they host Tunisia’s Carthage Eagles in their second Group H match of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier at Bingu National Stadium this afternoon.

Following a 1-0 victory over Liberia in Monrovia on Friday, the Flames have every reason to be optimistic going into the match against the Carthage Eagles.

The Flames will be looking to maintain their perfect start in the qualifiers and utilise home advantage against Tunisia, a side full of class and quality.

However, the Flames, who arrived on Sunday afternoon from Liberia, will have to shrug off jetlag after travelling for 24 hours from Liberia via Ghana, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia to Malawi.

Heading into the tie, the Flames should look beyond the Carthage Eagles’ status and avoid being intimidated by their previous achievements.

The two teams are separated by 91 places on the Fifa rankings, with the Flames on 123 whereas Carthage Eagles are on position 32 in the world.

Malawi and Tunisia have met seven times since 1987. The Flames have beaten Tunisia twice 3-2 in 1987 and 1-0 in 1989.

However, the Carthage Eagles beat Malawi 3-0 in the same year.

In 2004, Malawi and Tunisia shared the spoils after a 2-2 stalemate at Kamuzu Stadium before Carthage Eagles thrashed the Flames 7-0 in Tunis. The most recent matches between the two teams ended in stalemates.

They drew 2-2 in Tunisia in 2010 before a goalless draw in Blantyre in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers.

Patrick Mabedi

Flames coach Patrick Mabedi will likely throw his best players into the fray this afternoon.

After final training Monday, Mabedi said his troops would not be intimidated by previous records.

“This is a different generation. I would like to see us keeping the ball and we have to take out the mentality of fearing the opponents. We know Tunisia is a very good team, we respect them but we do not fear anyone. It is 11 against 11 on the pitch,” Mabedi said.

He will likely ring some changes to the team that started against Liberia in today’s match.

However, goalkeeper Brighton Munthali will be maintained alongside Stanley Sanudi, Dennis Chembezi, Lawrence Chaziya, Chimwemwe Idana, Lloyd Aaron, Robert Saizi, John Banda and Lanjesi Nkhoma.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE—The team’s skipper John Banda

Captain CJ Banda said the players are ready for the big showdown.

“We know what is at stake. We want to get all the points. The fans should come in large numbers and we will not disappoint them,” Banda said.

Tunisia arrived in Malawi on Sunday on a chartered plane. They trained at Silver Stadium.

The Flames are third with three points, behind Tunisia on goal difference who defeated Sao Tome and Principe 4-0. Equatorial Guinea are second with three points as well.
