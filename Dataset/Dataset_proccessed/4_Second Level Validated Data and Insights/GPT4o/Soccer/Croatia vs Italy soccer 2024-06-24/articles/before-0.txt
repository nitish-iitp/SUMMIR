How Croatia could line up against Italy
By Jonathan O'Shea

Needing a win to stand any chance of continuing their campaign at Euro 2024, Croatia meet Group B rivals Italy in Leipzig on Monday evening.

Two disappointing displays have left the Vatreni with only one point on the board, so head coach Zlatko Dalic is sure to rotate his resources in search of a quick change in fortunes.

Though Nikola Vlasic left the squad last week due to a muscular injury, Dalic has each of his remaining 25 men available to take on the reigning European champions.

Substituted at half time in the 2-2 draw with Albania, midfield fulcrum Marcelo Brozovic may now be dropped to the bench, allowing an opportunity for RB Salzburg prospect Luka Sucic or even Dinamo Zagreb's Martin Baturina to start instead.

Either international rookie would line up alongside long-term fixtures Luka Modric and Mateo Kovacic, both of whom have won over 100 caps for their nation.

Meanwhile, up front, Bruno Petkovic missed a penalty against Spain and then made way for Ante Budimir midway through the second half against Albania, so the latter could be promoted to the starting XI.

After switching from left-back to the heart of Croatia's defence last time out, Josko Gvardiol is set to continue in his preferred role; ever versatile, Ivan Perisic filled in at full-back, but Borna Sosa may now win the fight for selection.

Croatia possible starting lineup: Livakovic; Stanisic, Sutalo, Gvardiol, Sosa; Modric, Sucic, Kovacic; Pasalic, Budimir, Kramaric
