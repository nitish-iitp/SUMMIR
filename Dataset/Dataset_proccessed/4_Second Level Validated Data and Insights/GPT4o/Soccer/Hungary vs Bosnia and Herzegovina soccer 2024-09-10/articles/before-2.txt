Prediction: 2-1

Bosnia Herzegovina

Hungary will be aiming to make amends for a heavy loss to Germany when they take on Bosnia in their second group game. The Hungarians are likely to fight tooth and nail against the Balkan Dragons, but they will have to prove their worth on the field. Even though there are no fresh injury worries in the home team, SK Rapid defender Bendeguz Bolla should be recalled to the starting XI.

The Bosnians, on the other hand, are on a seven-game losing run in all competitions and given their poor defensive display in a 5-2 loss to Netherlands, home win should definitely be considered. As always, Fenerbahce attacker Edin Dzeko will lead the line for the visitors, while Crvena Zvezda summer signing Rade Krunic should be recalled to the starting XI. Bosnia boss Sergej Barbarez should stick to the 4-3-3 formation.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (WILLI ORBAN):

Willi Orban was born on 3 November, 1992 in Kaiserslautern, Germany. Orban plays as a centre back, but he can operate as a defensive midfielder as well.

Orban made his debut for the first team in 2011, against Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. The Kaiserslautern footballer made 68 league appearances for Kaiserslautern, scoring 7 goals for the German outfit between 2011 and 2015, but in May 2015 he signed a contract with Leipzig. Kaislerslautern fans were very angry with the defender when he decided to join die Bullen.
