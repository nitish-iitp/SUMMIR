Makono Eldinho’s late goal saw Burundi stun hosts Malawi 3-2 in a Group L opening match of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Thursday afternoon.

Eldino made the most of poor defending to score the winner at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, leaving the Flames bottom of the group.

Coach Patrick Mabedi’s charges, who trained for a day due to crammed domestic fixtures, seemed the brighter of the two sides in the early stages of the two teams’ second-ever meeting across all competitions.

Malawi threatened to score through a throw-in which dipped at the far-post. Burundi goalkeeper Mateo Nkurunzinza reacted the fastest to tip the ball out for corner-kick in the 17th minute.

The Falcons eventually punished the hosts when Malawi midfielder Chimwemwe Idana headed the ball past his goalkeeper George Chikooka in the 23rd minute while trying to avoid a ball from the right following skipper Ntibazonkiza Saidi’s corner kick.

However, Burundi’s lead lasted six minutes as striker Chawanangwa Kaonga scored the leveler for the home side through a powerful free-kick that deflected past the visitors’ green human wall.

Five minutes later, the Falcons restored their advantage as overlapping defender Jean Claude Girumugisha slid into the net a dropping ball from the right past goalkeeper Chikooka.

A few minutes later, Idana sought to atone for his earlier OG but he sent his rebound into the packed terraces.

Burundi led 2-1 at the break. Malawi responded in the second half. Forward Lanjesi Nkhoma scored with 15 minutes remaining on the clock, only for Eldinho to claim the winner for the visitors in the 87th minute.

Burundi, ranked13 places behind Malawi, lead the group heading into their next assignment against Senegal on September 9 2024 whereas Malawi face Burkina Faso in neutral Mali on September 10, 2024.

STARTING XI:

Malawi: George Chikooka, Stanley Sanudi, Gomezgani Chirwa, Chembezi Denis, Llyod Aaron, Nickson Mwase, Chimwemwe Idana, Chawanangwa Kaonga, Chifundo Mphasi, Lanjesi Nkhoma, Yamikani Chester.
