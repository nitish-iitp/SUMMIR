Austria looking to halt historic streak against Netherlands at Euro 2024

Austria will be looking to end an all-time streak when facing Netherlands at Euro 2024 on Tuesday evening.

Under the guidance of Ralf Rangnick, Das Team are enjoying some of the best form in their history with 15 wins coming from their 25 matches under the former Manchester United man.

Such is his investment in the project with the national team that Rangnick turned down the opportunity to join Bayern Munich.

However, Austria still have work to do if they wish to book their place in the last 16 of Euro 2024 having collected three points from their opening two games.

Having put in a strong performance during a 1-0 defeat to France, Austria bounced back with a 3-1 victory over Poland in their second Group D encounter.

As a result, at least third position is assured, putting them in the running to progress through that route as a bare minimum, but they will have to halt an historic run if they want to earn any further points.

Austria on unwanted 34-year streak

Rangnick takes his side into the showdown at the Olympiastadion with Austria having lost each of their last seven encounters with Oranje.

That represents the longest such run against a single opponent in their entire history, dating back to a friendly fixture in Vienna in May 1990.

Incredibly, Netherlands have scored at least twice in the following seven matches, netting a total of 20 times in friendlies, qualifiers and at Euro 2020.

Furthermore, Austria have prevailed just twice versus Netherlands in the 13 contests that have taken place since 1974.

Netherlands looking to extend their own run

Netherlands are looking to defeat Austria for the third successive time at a major tournament, with a 5-1 triumph coming at the 1978 World Cup and 2-0 victory being posted at the last Euros.

More notably, though, Netherlands are bidding to extend their unbeaten record in group-stage fixtures at major tournaments to 12 matches (nine wins, two draws).

The only time that they have failed to score during that period, which lasts since 2014, was in the goalless draw with France on Friday night.
