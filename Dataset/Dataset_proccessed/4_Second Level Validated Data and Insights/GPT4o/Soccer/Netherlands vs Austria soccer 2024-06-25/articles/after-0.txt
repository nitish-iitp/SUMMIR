Player of the Match: Marcel Sabitzer

What a tournament Sabitzer is having.

He is the recipient of UEFA's Player of the Match award, and deservedly so.

It was his superb winning goal that ultimately means Austria have finished top of Group D and it adds to the assist he registered in the 3-1 win against Poland in the last game.

With Grillitsch, Baumgartner and Seiwald around him in the team, there aren't many teams at this tournament that can boast a better selection of midfield options.

Austria will face Turkey, Czech Republic or Georgia

As confirmed Group D winners, Austria will face the runners up in Group F.

And, judging by that group, they will fancy their chances of making the quarter-final.

Turkey are the current second-placed team in Group F, but they could be replaced by Czech Republic of Georgia tomorrow evening.

Netherlands could face England in the last 16

Meanwhile, the Netherlands do not look the threat many will have expected, nor do France!

Having finished third and being confirmed as one of the best four third-place teams, Koeman's side could face England in the last 16 if Gareth Southgate's side are confirmed as Group C winners later on.

Austria's place as Group D winners is confirmed!

UEFA

Wow.

What a turn up for the books in Group D.

France and the Netherlands were widely expected to coast through in the top two spots, but it is Austria who have topped the group after France could only draw 1-1 with already-relegated Poland.

No one will want to face Rangnick's side in the knockouts!

90+6' Netherlands 2-3 Austria

This has been very good in stoppage time from Austria,

They have found a perfect balance between pressing and defending their own box and have limited their opponents to hardly anything.

Not long left for the Netherlands now...

Pentz denies Van de Ven!

90+3' Netherlands 2-3 Austria

Austria haven't conceded too much in the way of chances in the last few minutes, but Pentz had to be alive to the danger a few moments ago.

Gakpo threaded a nice ball into the left channel for Van de Ven to chase and he attempted to fire a square ball into the six-yard box, but for a strong denial from goalkeeper Pentz.

Substitute Querfeld did everything he could to get in the way of the Tottenham defender but has paid the price with an injury.

The Netherlands have six more minutes to find an equaliser.

A suddenly tired-looking Austria side have the same amount of time to protect their 3-2 lead.

Netherlands pushing for an equaliser

88' Netherlands 2-3 Austria

For the first time in this game, Austria have retreated to their own defensive third.

They just need to protect their goal in what remains of this match and they are doing a good job so far.

Although, there will be a decent chunk of stoppage time so the Netherlands certainly still have a chance of sharing the points and, as things stand, topping Group D.

Weghorst heads over

86' Netherlands 2-3 Austria

This is positively fast and furious now in Berlin — perhaps the game of the tournament so far.

Weghorst is never far from the action when he comes off the bench but he will be disappointed that he has just arrowed a header from 14 yards over the crossbar.

The offside flag denies Austria a fourth goal!

83' Netherlands 2-3 Austria

Now it is Austria who are back in ascendancy and, for a split second, they thought they had made it 4-2.

Baumgartner, from an even tighter angle than the one that faced Sabizter, curled a right-footed effort past Verbruggen and into the bottom corner, but he had gone too early and was rightly flagged offside.

A sublime goal

81' Netherlands 2-3 Austria

That is a fantastic goal for Austria.

Baumgartner threaded a sublime deft pass into Sabitzer but the former Manchester United loanee was rapidly running out of room in the penalty area.

That didn't matter, though as he flashed a quite brilliant left-footed strike into the roof of the net.

Just moments after conceding, Austria have retaken the lead in Berlin!

The goal stands! Netherlands are level

78' Netherlands 2-2 Austria

Referee Ivan Kruzliak was forced over to the VAR monitor by his colleagues and had to overturn his decision after replays showed that the ball was nowhere near Depay's arm.

I have no idea why that VAR check took so long, the ball very obviously hadn't touched Depay's arm.

Depay equalises for the Netherlands... no he doesn't!

Getty Images

76' Netherlands 1-2 Austria

A typically big contribution for Weghorst as he nodded a long ball into the path of Depay, who finished brilliantly into the top corner on the volley.

But, no! The referee's whistle cut his celebrations short and he indicated that the former Manchester United forward had handled the ball before his finish.

VAR is checking this one...

Close your legs, Cody!

73' Netherlands 1-2 Austria

That'll get the fans off their seats.

Some very delicate footwork from Prass who nudged the ball through the legs of Gakpo! It is met by a huge cheer from the Austria fans — they're really enjoying themselves in Berlin.

Malen's race is run, Weghorst replaces him

Getty Images

70' Netherlands 1-2 Austria

A foul on Malen from Prass — who cannot be far off being shown a yellow card — has left the Dortmund forward looking unable to carry on.

Weghorst was seemingly being ready, anyway, so it is a straightforward swap. It has been one to forget for Malen who scored an own goal inside six minutes before missing a gilt-edged chance later in the first half.

Will Weghorst be able to make his usual impact impact off the bench?
