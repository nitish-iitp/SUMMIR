The final countdown to UEFA Euro 2024 has officially begun as we approach a string of highly anticipated international friendlies. Some of the nations that are playing this week are heading for the big tournament and others aren’t, but either way, it’s important for all of them to try and build some momentum. Today, we’ll be taking a look at the impending clash between Gibraltar and Scotland.

Gibraltar Form Guide

As a national team that is barely a decade old, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that Gibraltar are underdogs. It happens in just about every game they partake in and, really, so it should. They don’t really have the resources necessary to make this kind of operation work right now but in truth, it’s all about baby steps, which is why it’ll be exciting to see how things continue to develop.

Gibraltar’s qualifying campaign for the Euros, to put it bluntly, was a bit of a disaster. They didn’t score a single goal, they conceded 41 times, and they lost all eight of their fixtures to ensure they finished dead bottom. Oh, and they were also beaten 14-0 by France.

Scotland Form Guide

Scotland enjoyed their cameo at the last European Championships so much that they’re ready to try and do it all over again. They’ve certainly got a great deal of raw talent and they have a spirit within their squad that we haven’t seen from them in years. Now, it’s a case of whether or not they can keep up their consistency in the face of adversity, which has often held them back in the past.

Scotland’s qualifying campaign, in totality, was really quite impressive. They finished 2nd in Group A behind just Spain and they were actually one of the first sides to reach the final tournament, which says a lot about how far they’ve come as a nation.

Match Prediction

In a game like this, the whole point is to do everything in your power to make an impact - but at the same time, there are far more important matches that lie ahead. Therefore, while we do think there will be some big moments here and there, our official prediction is over 2.5 goals scored.
