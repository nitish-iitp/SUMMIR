GIBRALTAR V SCOTLAND - FRIENDLY MATCH PREVIEW

Plenty of Scots to head to the Algarve at this time of year but for Steve Clarke and his players this trip to Faro is strictly business.

Having booked a spot at Euro 2024 with matches to spare after a blistering start to the qualification campaign, the national team have lost their way a little and need to get back on track following poor losses to the Netherlands and. Northern Ireland last time out in the March break which left the nation on a downer ahead of the squad being named for the big one. Clarke selected 28 bodies for the pre-camp ahead of jetting out to the finals but he already faces a huge call after Lyndon Dykes was ruled out in a major injury blow.

Scotland and Gibraltar are no strangers to each other having locked horns twice previous with the Dark Blues firing home six goals on both occasions, so it's a fixture that should, on paper at least, allow them to get a confidence-boosting result against a nation ranked 203rd in the world, below even the likes of the Cayman Islands. Clarke has stated in the build-up that he plans to play a different looking team with a number of players in need of minutes set to benefit while young Ben Doak could also land his debut.
