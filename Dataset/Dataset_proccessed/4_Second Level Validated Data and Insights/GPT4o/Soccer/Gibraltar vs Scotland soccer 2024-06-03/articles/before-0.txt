The Tartan Army will aim to get back to winning ways against Gibraltar.

Bound for Euro 2024, Scotland will aim to end their poor run with a win against Gibraltar on Monday at Estadio Algarve. Steve Clarke’s squad have struggled since securing qualification, conceding 19 goals in their last seven matches, including losses to Northern Ireland and the Netherlands. Their dismal friendly record, with only one win in their last 13 matches and five consecutive losses, highlights the need for a morale boost before the Euros kickoff.

Gibraltar, after heavy defeats to France and the Netherlands in their Euro qualifiers, lost both legs of their UEFA Nations League playoffs to Lithuania, resulting in relegation to League D. They will now face San Marino and Liechtenstein in the next Nations League campaign. Following their meeting with Scotland, the small Mediterranean nation will play Wales. Victory in either of these matches would mean a lot to them.

Kick-off

Monday, 3 June 2024 at 5 PM BST (9:30 PM IST)

Location: Estádio Algarve

Form

Gibraltar (All Competitions): L-L-L-L-L

Scotland (All Competitions): L-D-D-L-L

Players to watch
Joseph Chipolina (Gibraltar)

Joseph Chipolina is a well-known leader in defence. In Gibraltar’s defensive line, Chipolina’s skills and experience are invaluable. He is the coach’s “Mr Reliable” player. Chipolina happens to be his nation’s third-most capped player.

Andrew Robertson (Scotland)

Andrew Robertson is the kind of leader a team yearns for. Robertson has led Scotland by example, playing in various positions from left midfielder to left-back. Expect the Scottish captain to trouble Gibraltar on Monday with his deadly crosses and bursting runs.

Match facts
Gibraltar’s last victory dates back to November 2022. That was also the last time they scored a goal in a match.
Scotland’s last six games have ended in four losses and two draws, with the last win dating back to September 2023.

Injury & Team News

Gibraltar have added six uncapped players to their squad, including Chesterfield winger Liam Jessop and Manchester United youngster James Scanlon. Despite this fresh injection of talent, regulars like Tjay De Barr, Liam Walker and 42-year-old veteran Lee Casciaro are expected to start at Estadio Algarve.

Scotland manager Steve Clarke may have to cope without first-choice striker Lyndon Dykes, who was stretchered off during training on Friday. Dykes, with nine goals in 36 internationals, could join Bologna captain Lewis Ferguson as well as full-backs Aaron Hickey and Nathan Patterson on the injury list.

In their absence, Ross McCrorie and Anthony Ralston will compete for the right-back position, while the fitness of Stuart Armstrong, John Souttar, Ben Doak and Ryan Jack remains uncertain.
