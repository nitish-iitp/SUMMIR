All eyes on Paez in Venezuela’s win over Ecuador
CHELSEA’S NEW SIGNING SHOWED WHY HE IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING TALENTS IN THE COPA AMERICA AND WORLD FOOTBALL AT LEVI’S STADIUM

Kendry Paez played a key role in the pivotal moment of Ecuador’s 2-1 defeat to Venezuela – just not one he would have wanted.

Surging up the field in the 18th minute at Levi’s Stadium, the 17-year-old dissected the Venezuela defense with a pass to Piero Hincapie and then raced on to the Bayer Leverkusen player’s cross. 

The ball was bouncing, with defenders closing in, when he met it with a powerful side footed shot with his weaker right foot. 

Venezuela keeper Rafael Romo saved well, blocking Paez’ shot and parrying it toward the penalty spot where Jose Martinez was set to clear. That was until Enner Valencia, Ecuador’s 34-year-old captain and most experienced player, came flying in with a chest high kick that earned a booking that was then turned red after a VAR check.

That Paez kept his shot down and on target while sprinting at full speed illustrated the phenomenal technique that has made him one of the most exciting teenagers in world football.

English Premier League side Chelsea concluded a transfer for Paez in June 2023, paying a rumored $12.5 million to Ecuadorian club Independiete del Valle for his signature. He will move to England when he turns 18 in May 2025. 

Paez’ contribution was the highlight of the game up until Valencia’s expulsion. Afterwards the odds tilted dramatically in Venezuela’s favor, even if Ecuador still dominated the next 25 minutes.

And Paez was at the center of much of it, although it was Brighton’s Jeremy Sarmiento who opened the scoring with a well taken finish on 39 minutes. 

So what type of player have Chelsea got in Paez?

On this evidence a very good one, with a ridiculous amount of potential and a wand of a left foot. 

In hot conditions, while others flagged or conserved gas, he was energetic, progressing the ball, often in isolation, and looking to exploit 1-v-1 opportunities. 

Although Paez was the youngest player on the pitch he looked one of the best.

His compatriot Moises Caicedo will welcome him to Chelsea. While it may take Paez some time to reach his compatriot’s level,, the signs are that he has a good chance of reaching the very top. 

Jack Lang’s excellent Paez profile in The Athletic illustrated his confidence and extreme belief in his ability. While his desire to get on the ball and run at Venezuela, despite his side being a man down, underlined his determination and proactive style of play. 

Word from England suggests a period of acclimatization in and around the Chelsea first team squad next summer before may await Paez, before a loan somewhere he can express himself while gaining much needed game time. As a caveat, the appearance against Venezuela was Paez’ 58th senior appearance for club and country.

After Ecuador went to ten men, Paez was a willing and useful outball. His team understandably tired, and after taking the lead, were eventually pegged back and eventually overcome by Venezuela who recorded a famous victory, their first against Ecuador at a Copa since 2011.

Venezuela looked jittery at the start, but after coach Fernando Batista made a couple of half time substitutions, Jhonder Cádiz and Eduard Bello who both scored, they slowly took control. 

By the end Ecuador were running on fumes and Paez was withdrawn in the 79th minute.

On this evidence Chelsea have signed a very good player. 

Venezuela faces Mexico next in Copa America Group B on Wednesday, while Ecuador takes on Jamaica. 

Another chance for Paez to show Chelsea, and the wider football world, how good he could become.
