How Venezuela battled back to beat Ecuador

Venezuela came from behind to beat 10-man Ecuador in California on Saturday to begin their 2024 Copa America campaign with a win.

Ecuador played the majority of the match with 10 players after their captain, Enner Valencia, was sent off for an incredibly ugly lunge on Venezuela defender Jose Martinez.

But Ecuador then took a deserved lead when Jeremy Sarmiento, who spent this season on loan at Ipswich Town from Brighton & Hove Albion, found the net with a low shot.

Venezuela made their one-man advantage count in the second half, however, and two goals in the space of 10 minutes secured them a vital win. First Jhonder Cadiz scored from Salomon Rondon’s layoff, with Eduard Bello smashing home a rebound to win the game.

Disappointing start for Ecuador

As Michael mentioned, Ecuador have not won their opening game at a Copa America since 1993. Nine defeats and three draws since then.

Not for the first time, they're going to have do do things the hard way.

Significance of Venezuela's win

Playing in Copa America for the 20th time, this is just the third time that Venezuela have begun the tournament with a victory, having also done so in 2015 and 2016.

It's just their ninth win in 71 matches at Copa America all-time. It gives Venezuela a fantastic platform from which to attempt to reach the knockout stages.

For Ecuador, they still have not begun Copa America with a win since 1993. With Enner Valencia likely to be suspended for their remaining two group-stage games, they may struggle to finish in the top two of Group B.

Rondon key to Venezuela's comeback

Getty Images

Salomon Rondon entered this tournament in terrific form. The striker was at the heart of Pachuca’s successful CONCACAF Champions Cup campaign. After joining the Liga MX club in January, the Venezuelan bagged a brace in the final to push his side past the Columbus Crew.

The 34-year-old assisted the leveler tonight against Ecuador, and he’s arguably never looked finer leading a forward line than he does these days.

Rincon should provide composure

90+4' Ecuador 1-2 Venezuela

On comes Tomas Rincon, and if experience is what is needed in situations like this, Venezuela are in luck. This is his 133rd international cap and he has been a fixture of the squad since 2008. Clever player.

A third Venezuela goal would seal it

87' Ecuador 1-2 Venezuela

Savarino rolls the ball across the face of Ecuador's goal but no teammate is there to tap it home.

Venezuela look the likelier side to score at the moment but this match is far from over.

Ecuador searching for equalizer

81' Ecuador 1-2 Venezuela

Ecuador have a corner, giving them an opportunity to pack bodies into the Venezuela box.

Venezuela don't defend the corner overconfidently, but a header floats wide of the goal and Venezuela have a goal kick.

Can Venezuela hang on against 10-man Ecuador?

79' Ecuador 1-2 Venezuela

Superb comeback from Venezuela, but it will be interesting to see how they navigate these last 10 minutes. They are having so much joy in the final third that they should keep attacking, in search of a third goal.

My instinct, however, tells me they will probably go into their shells at some point. Can Ecuador play on the inevitable nerves?

GOAL: Venezuela score to take the lead!

74' Ecuador 1-2 Venezuela

Right on cue! Rondon's header forces a great save from Dominguez but Ecuador can't stop Bello from slotting home the rebound!

Both of Venezuela's halftime subs have scored.

Venezuela's intensity pays off

73' Ecuador 1-1 Venezuela

Hard not to be pleased for Venezuela – they have been a bit frantic trying to make their man advantage pay, but have their reward for upping the intensity level in the sweltering California heat.

Those were some wild celebrations too – imagine if they take the lead!

What's at stake here

70' Ecuador 1-1 Venezuela

As we approach the end of this game with both sides capable of grabbing a late winner, it's worth pointing out what a win would mean for each:

Venezuela have won just eight of their 70 Copa America matches all-time
Ecuador haven't won their opening match at Copa America since 1993

A win would also be huge in what is a wide-open Group B alongside Mexico and Jamaica.

Cadiz's first goal for Venezuela

68' Ecuador 1-1 Venezuela

That's Jhonder Cádiz's first goal for his country. He is a bit of a late developer but really came to the fore in Portugal last season, scoring 15 league goals for midtable battlers Famalicao. Credit, too, to Salomon Rondon, for a clever bit of holdup play in the buildup to the strike.
