Ecuador favored against Venezuela in Copa America 2024 group stage.

Beni Mellal - Ecuador and Venezuela are set to face off at Levi’s Stadium today at 23:00 pm GMT+1 in a highly anticipated group stage match in the Copa America 2024, where they are both part of Group B.

Ecuador’s “La Tri” will be looking to build on their recent victories over Bolivia and Honduras, and will need to showcase their abilities on the pitch.

Veteran striker Enner Valencia is expected to lead Ecuador’s attack, while forward Kevin Rodriguez’s return from injury means he will also be part of the lineup.

Another key player for Felix Sanchez’s team is Bayer Leverkusen left-back Piero Hincapie.

On the other hand, Venezuela put in a disappointing performance in their scoreless draw with Guatemala, making Ecuador the favorite to win this matchup.

Venezuelan football icon Salomon Rondon is likely to return to the starting lineup after scoring as a substitute in the last friendly match.

The previous meeting between the two teams in the 2021 Copa America ended in a 2-2 draw.

Ranked 30th in the latest FIFA rankings, Ecuador has scored 19 goals in 15 matches over the past two years, while conceding 13.

Venezuela, ranked 54th, has scored 12 goals in 13 matches during the same period, while allowing in 8.

According to Fox Sports, Ecuador posted a positive goal differential of +6, while Venezuela was also in positive territory at +4.

Statistically, the odds favor Ecuador, with the moneyline odds at +100 for an Ecuador win, +225 for a draw, and +330 for a Venezuela victory.

The over/under for total goals is set at 1.5, with the over at -210 and the under at +165.

While past meetings and rankings point to Ecuador as the favorite, Venezuela will be looking to rebound from their lackluster performance against Guatemala and prove their mettle in this Copa America opener.

The stage is set for an exciting clash between these two South American rivals.
