Group C could witness a closely contested match-up on Matchday 1

Two years ago, Cameroon hosted the event and secured a third-place finish on their home turf. They suffered a penalty shootout loss to Egypt in the semi-finals but later emerged victorious in a shootout against Burkina Faso in the third-place play-off.

Guinea showcased their abilities by securing a draw against Senegal and advancing to the knockout stages, leaving a lasting impression. Notably, since 1998, they have only encountered one instance of failing to progress beyond the group stage when participating in the tournament’s qualifiers.

Kick-Off:

Monday; 15 January 2024, 05:00 PM GMT (10:30 PM IST)

Location: Charles Konan Banny Stadium

Form

Cameroon (all competitions): L-L-W-D-D

Guinea (all competitions): W-D-W-L-W

Players to watch
Frank Magri (Cameroon)

Frank Magri, the young Cameroonian striker currently playing for Toulouse in Ligue 1, is known for a distinct playing style that blends finesse with a ruthless finishing instinct. He exhibits intelligent movement off the ball, creating space for himself and teammates. He can drop deep to link up play or make diagonal runs to exploit gaps in the defense. His composure in the box allows him to convert chances efficiently.

Serhou Guirassy (Guinea)
Serhou Guirassy has netted 17 goals in 14 Bundesliga matches for Stuttgart in the 2023-24 season

At 27 years old, the player has displayed remarkable performance this season by netting 17 goals in 14 Bundesliga matches for Stuttgart. After representing the French under-16, under-19, and under-20 squads, Guirassy made a switch to play for his parent country. With 12 international caps for Guinea, the forward has scored three goals, including one against Brazil in a friendly match last year.

Injury and Team News

Bryan Mbeumo of Brentford will be absent from the Cameroon squad as he underwent ankle surgery last month, ruling him out of the tournament. Cameroon’s number one, Andre Onana is questionable for this encounter after committing to play against Tottenham. Cameroon suffered a huge blow as Aboubakar will miss the AFCON after sustaining an injury in training.

Guinea enter this match with a clean bill of health, indicating that all players are in good physical condition without any reported injuries or health concerns.

Match prediction for Cameroon vs Guinea

Cameroon’s recent performance have been less than stellar, marked by a drawn warm-up match against Zambia and being held to a tie by Libya in a World Cup qualifier back in November. On the contrary, Guinea enter the upcoming match with high confidence, having secured a friendly victory against Nigeria. They appear well-equipped to pose challenges for Cameroon in what promises to be a closely contested encounter.

Prediction: Cameroon 1-1 Guinea
