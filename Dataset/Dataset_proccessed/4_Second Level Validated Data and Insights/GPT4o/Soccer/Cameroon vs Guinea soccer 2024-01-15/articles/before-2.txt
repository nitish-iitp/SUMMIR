Preview: Cameroon vs. Guinea - prediction, team news, lineups

A tricky Group C in the Africa Cup of Nations will get underway this week, and Cameroon will be looking to make a positive start to the competition when they face Guinea in their opening match on Monday evening.

It would not be a huge surprise if we saw three sides from Group C qualify for the knockout stages as it features four very good teams, including Senegal and Gambia, who will square off earlier in the day.

Cameroon have gone under the radar in the buildup to this showpiece event, with most onlookers expecting the likes of Morocco, Egypt, Senegal and the hosts Ivory Coast to feature in the latter stages of the tournament.

All things considered, being just the eighth-favourite in the competition may suit the Indomitable Lions just fine, though, as they will not be burdened as much by the weight of expectancy, especially after a very average warm-up match, which saw them draw 1-1 to Zambia last week.

However, despite what the bookmakers may think, you simply cannot write off Cameroon in any competition, especially AFCON, as they are still one of only three countries to ever successfully defend the continental crown.

In addition, the Indomitable Lions - who won their fifth AFCON title in Gabon in 2017 when they were unfancied as well - are the second-most successful nation in the history of this competition behind The Pharaohs (seven titles).

Cameroon also have a habit of performing at their best in West Africa, as they are the only side to have won three AFCON titles in the West of the continent. Their first victory came here in the Ivory Coast back in 1984 before their back-to-back triumphs in 2000 and 2002 in Nigeria and Mali, respectively.

While it may be just the opening match of the competition, the importance of getting a result here cannot be overstated, as it could be a deciding match in the race for the top two spots if Senegal live up to expectations and win the group.

Guinea, though, are definitely a team to keep an eye on in this competition and they raised a fair few eyebrows in the lead-up to the competition when they beat Nigeria in their sole warm-up match last week.

The National Elephants have improved immensely over the last five to seven years and enter the tournament ranked 15th among African nations, according to the latest FIFA world rankings.

Guinea reached the knockout stages of the last competition and have solid momentum heading into this edition, having only lost one of their last six matches while winning four and drawing one of the other five.

Despite Cameroon's record in this competition, Kaba Diawara's side have been the more successful in the head-to-head battle in recent times, winning the last two encounters in 2021 and 2017.

Cameroon will have to make do without the services of the influential Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo, who underwent surgery on his ankle last month, which ruled him out of this tournament.

The Indomitable Lions also face uncertainty around their goalkeeper situation since Andre Onana will only arrive in the Ivory Coast less than 24 hours before kickoff, having been granted permission to play for Manchester United against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.

Rigobert Song was dealt what could be a huge late blow in preparation for this match as Vincent Aboubakar sustained an injury in training over the weekend, and reports suggest that the national team's skipper may have to withdraw from the competition.

Guinea have one major problem of their own, and it revolves around the fitness of their star striker Serhou Guirassy, who took a knock to his thigh, which saw him withdrawn early in the match against Nigeria last week.

Guirassy has been in superb form for his club Stuttgart this season and has already notched up 17 goals in just 14 matches in the Bundesliga this season. Liverpool's Naby Keita, meanwhile, is expected to wear the captain's armband for the National Elephants.


Cameroon possible starting lineup:
Epassy; Castelletto, Wooh, Moukoudi, Tolo; Ntcham, Kemen, Anguissa; Ngamaleu, Ekambi, Magri

Guinea possible starting lineup:
Kone; Conte, Jeanvier, Diakhaby, Sylla; Camara, Konate, Keita; Guilavogui, Kamano, Guirassy



We say: Cameroon 1-1 Guinea

This could easily end up being the best watch in the opening round of matches in their year's competition. Cameroon have a history of good performances in AFCON, while Guniea are one of the rising stars on the continent and have a red-hot striker in Guirassy at their disposal.

There is very little to choose between these sides, and considering that the four best-finishing third-placed sides will also qualify, we feel these two will be fairly content to settle for a share of the spoils.
