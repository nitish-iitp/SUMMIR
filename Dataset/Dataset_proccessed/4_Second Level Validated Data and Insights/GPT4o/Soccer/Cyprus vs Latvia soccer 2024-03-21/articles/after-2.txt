Euro 2024 qualifying group tables, standings, fixtures and results for UEFA tournament qualifiers

SPORTING NEWS

March 26, 2024
•
10:48 am UTC

The road to Euro 2024 officially resumed in March 2023 with qualifying kicking off across Europe.

At the end of the group-stage qualifiers, 21 teams had joined hosts Germany in being guaranteed a place in the tournament so far, with a further three to join them over the coming months. Italy are the defending champions but only narrowly qualified.

A total of 53 nations competed for a spot at Euro 2024 with teams finishing first and second in the 10 qualifying groups (see tables below) booking their tickets to Germany. That accounts for 20 of the 23 open slots.

The remaining berths will be decided via playoffs that will see 12 countries competing for a spot at Euro 2024. The 12 playoff participants were determined based on performance and final rankings from the 2022/23 UEFA Nations League.

The 12 UEFA Nations League group winners (four from League A, four from League B, and four from League C) advanced to the Euro playoffs unless they'd already qualified directly via Euro 2024 qualifying. If already qualified, that country's place in the playoffs was taken by the next highest-ranked team in their specific league (i.e. League A, B or C). 

The Sporting News is keeping track of Euro 2024 qualifying matches and standings below. This was the list of Euro 2024 group tiebreakers as outlined in the official tournament regulations (Article 15):

When is Euro 2024?

Euro 2024 will officially kick off on June 14, 2024 in Germany with the hosts involved in the first match at the Allianz Arena in Munich.

The UEFA tournament will last exactly one month with the final to be played on July 14, 2024 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.

Euro 2024 will consist of 51 total matches with no third-place playoff to be held.

The tournament will start with the 24 finalists split up in six groups with each group winner and runner-up advancing to the knockout rounds together with the four best third-place teams.

Those 16 sides left standing will then do battle in the single-elimination knockout rounds beginning with the Round of 16, through to the quarter finals, semifinals and then the final in Berlin.
