Liechtenstein

Gibraltar will look to kick off their UEFA Nations League campaign in great manner when they take on Liechtenstein on Sunday afternoon. Gibraltar defeated Andorra in a friendly on Wednesday, with Lincoln Red Imps defender Dan Bent scoring the only goal of the match, but they do not want to stop now. You should bear in mind that Jurgen Henn’s troops are eyeing their third consecutive clean sheet in all competitions.

Liechtenstein, on the other hand, struggled offensively in a 1-0 loss to San Marino, which is probably the main reason why we are going to bet on under 2.5 goals. Both Simon Luchinger and Felix Oberwaditzer are pushing for recalls to the starting XI after the duo came off the bench in the opener. You should bear in mind that under 2.5 goals have been netted in five of the previous six meetings between the two sides in all competitions.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (GIBRALTAR):

Gibraltar played their first unofficial match against Jersey in the 1993 Island Games. The Gibraltarians suffered a 2-1 loss to Jersey, but they did well to hold Slovakia to a goalless draw in their first official international match. Gibraltar participated in the 2016 World Cup qualifiers and they were drawn in Group D alongside Germany, Poland, Georgia, Republic of Ireland and Scotland.

They failed to impress on their debut in the World Cup qualifiers and it has to be noted that the minnows suffered a loss in each of their ten group games (goal difference 2:56). Gibraltar recorded their first ever win against Malta on April 6, 2014 and that is considered the team’s biggest success.

Danny Higginbotham, who played for the likes of Manchester United, Southampton, Sunderland, Stoke City and Sheffield United during his professional career, has three caps for Gibraltar national football team and he is considered the greatest player who whore Gibraltar shirt. The Gibraltarians play their home games at Estadio Algarve, speaking of qualifying matches.
