Gibraltar take on Liechtenstein in the UEFA Nations League on Sunday

Gibraltar kick off their 2024 UEFA Nations League campaign when they play host to Liechtenstein at the Europa Sports Complex on Sunday. This will be the first meeting between the two nations since November 2022, when Julio Ribas’ men secured a 2-0 victory in a friendly.

Gibraltar picked up a morale-boosting result in their final warm-up game on Wednesday when they beat Andorra 1-0 in a friendly at the Europa Sports Complex.

Before that, Ribas’ men were on a 14-game winless run across all competitions, losing 13 and claiming one draw since also securing a 1-0 victory over Andorra in November 2022.

Gibraltar now launch their Nations League campaign, where they finished last in Group 4 of League C back in 2022 before suffering a 2-0 aggregate defeat against Lithuania in the relegation playoff in March.

Trending

Liechtenstein, on the other hand, were on the receiving end of a surprise 1-0 loss against European whipping boys San Marino in Thursday’s Nation League group opener.

Teenage forward Nicko Sensoli grabbed the headlines at the San Marino Stadium as he struck in the 53rd minute to inspire San Marino to their first win since 2004.

With the midweek result, Konrad Funfstuck’s men have now lost 21 straight competitive matches, a run which saw them finish rock-bottom in Group 1 of League D in the Nations League back in 2022.

Gibraltar vs Liechtenstein Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
With three wins from the last six meetings between the sides, Gibraltar boast a superior record in the history of this fixture.
Liechtenstein have picked up one win in that time, which came in September 2018, when they beat Ribas’ side 2-0 in the Nations League, while the spoils have been shared twice.
Gibraltar have lost their last 13 competitive matches, stretching back to a 1-1 draw against Bulgaria in June 2022.
Liechtenstein have gone 40 consecutive games without a win across all competitions, dating back to a 2-1 friendly victory over Luxembourg in October 2020.
Gibraltar vs Liechtenstein Prediction

Gibraltar and Liechtenstein head into the weekend on a dire run of results and will be looking to stop the rot. However, the home side have enjoyed the better of this fixture and we are backing them to heap more misery on Funfstuck’s men.

Prediction: Gibraltar 2-1 Liechtenstein
