AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS
Equatorial Guinea 4-2 Guinea-Bissau: Chaos N’Sue-s for African Wild Dogs

Made In Africa Sport

JANUARY 18, 2024, 7:52 PM2419

(AFP) – Emilio Nsue’s second hat-trick in international football helped Equatorial Guinea register their first-ever H2H victory over Guinea-Bissau, doing so via an emphatic 4-2 success at the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpé.

Before the tournament, this was widely seen as a straight duel to avoid last place. And in the first competitive encounter between Group A’s distant underdogs, following two prior friendly H2H victories for Guinea-Bissau, the Djurtus unsurprisingly began the stronger. Yet, it was at the opposite end of the field where the deadlock would be broken in the 21st minute. A brief lapse in concentration from Janio Bikel allowed Emilio Nsue through, and he converted with an expertly-taken one-on-one finish.

Josete Miranda then came close to doubling Equatorial Guinea’s lead only a matter of minutes later, but the striker would be denied a goal on his recall to the Elefantes’ XI, as his ambitious cross-shot beat Ouparine Djoco, but not the crossbar. Guinea-Bissau heeded this warning, and thought they had turned the game on its head in a crazy four-minute spell in front of goal, however there was to be a sting in the tail, as an 37th-minute own goal from Esteban Orozco brought the Djurtus back to a level playing field.

The comeback then seemed to be truly on when referee Samuel Uwikunda pointed to the spot, for what appeared like a clumsy challenge from Saúl Coco on Franculino Djú. However, VAR would save Equatorial Guinea on this occasion, as a review of his on-field monitor led to an overturn. It was a let-off Equatorial Guinea capitalised upon very well, as – amid an array of impressive dance moves in the stands from both sets of supporters during HT – they were celebrating on the pitch almost immediately after the restart, when Miranda sublimely volleyed his side back ahead.

And unbelievably, the Elefantes’ early second-half charge towards victory was not finished there, as Nsue shortly slotted home his second goal from the back post courtesy of Basilio Ndong’s delicious delivery into the danger zone. By now Guinea-Bissau were truly on the ropes, and following another prolonged intervention from VAR, Nsue was eventually allowed to celebrate an unforgettable afternoon in Abidjan with his ecstatic teammates, with the Elefantes’ captain bringing up his hat-trick via another clinical one-on-one strike past Djoco.

Zé Turbo fired in a late consolation deep in second-half stoppage-time for Guinea-Bissau, but it ultimately had no impact on the contrast of emotions at FT. Unbelievably, against all pre-tournament expectations, this comprehensive victory for Equatorial Guinea provisionally lifts them above Ivory Coast to the top of Group A. Meanwhile, Guinea-Bissau now have it all to do if they want to qualify for the knockout stages, as even a victory in their last group game might ultimately end up not being enough.

There has been a tendency in football circles in recent years to look down on the African Cup of Nations as an inferior brand to the European Championship with racist predictions of a sporting disaster abounded but did AFCON prove its critics wrong?

Sadio Mane, Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy, Ismaïla Sarr… they are all kings of a championship that has had many green shoots of positivity. It was a tournament that was also a failure in terms of the organization and safety off the park.

10 days after the unique trophy was lifted by Senegal, we look back to pick out its best and worst moments. Remi Sulola from The Cable was there from start to finish, she joined Olamide Abe to analyze those moments where we got to see the good, the bad, the ugly, and the funny side of it all.
