Matchday two of the Africa Cup of Nations sees Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau face off at the Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara on Thursday.

Neither team was able to come away with maximum points from their opening encounters, and they will both be keen to get their AFCON campaign up and running with all three points here.

Equatorial Guinea played out a 1-1 stalemate against the Super Eagles of Nigeria when the sides faced off in their curtain-raiser on Sunday.

Juan Micha's men got their noses in front in the 36th minute through Iban Salvador but were pegged back in next to no time by Victor Osimhen.

As a result, Los Elefantes currently occupy third place in Group A, level on points with Nigeria and two points behind leaders Ivory Coast.

Next up is the challenge of an opposing outfit who have emerged victorious from the previous two editions of this fixture by a combined score of 7-1.

Unbeaten in their last 11 outings across all competitions, Equatorial Guinea now go in search of a much-needed three points to all but confirm their place in the last 16.

Guinea-Bissau were on the receiving end of a comprehensive 2-0 defeat against tournament hosts Ivory Coast at the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpe on Saturday evening.

Baciro Cande's men fell behind to Seko Fofana's early opener after which Jean-Philippe Krasso sealed the deal just shy of the hour mark.

The only team yet to pick up a point in Group A so far, the Wild Dogs currently sit bottom of the group but are far from out heading into the penultimate round of group-stage games.

Having let in a whopping eight goals across their last two matches, Guinea-Bissau will need to tighten up at the back to stand any chance of avoiding defeat here.

Team News

Ouparine Djoco looks to have usurped Jonas Mendes in the battle for Guinea-Bissau's number one spot and is expected to feature between the sticks once again.

Thirty-two-year-old Opa Sangante could be dropped to the substitutes' bench for this one, having a day to forget against Ivory Coast last time out.

Following his opener against Nigeria, Iban Salvador has now scored six times for Equatorial Guinea, with only Emilio Nsue finding the back of the net on more occasions of the 27-man AFCON squad.

Midfielder Federico Bikoro is set to make his 49th international cap, which would see him move within one of half a century of appearances.


Equatorial Guinea possible starting lineup:
Owono; Ndong, Coco, Orozco, Akapo; Ganet, Bikoro; Buyla, Machin, Salvador; Nsue

Guinea-Bissau possible starting lineup:
Djoco; Encada, Sangante, Djalo, Cande; Bikel, Semedo, Cassama; Mane, Balde, Rodrigues



We say: Equatorial Guinea 2-1 Guinea-Bissau

Both teams gave good accounts of themselves in their respective opening matches, and we are expecting a keenly-contested affair here. That said, we just about tip Equatorial Guinea to get the job done come the end of the 90 minutes.
