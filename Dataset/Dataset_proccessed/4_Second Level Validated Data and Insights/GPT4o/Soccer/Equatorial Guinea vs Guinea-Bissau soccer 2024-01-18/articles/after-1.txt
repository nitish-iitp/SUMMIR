AFRICA CUP 2024 FIXTURES+RESULTS VIDEO
2024 AFRICA CUP - GROUP A - DAY 06 - EQUATORIAL GUINEA VS GUINEA BISSAU 4:2

AFRICA CUP 2024
GROUP A

DAY 06
Match 13

Equatorial Guinea vs Guinea Bissau 4:2

 

 

FACTS
Emilio Nsue scored a hat-trick as Equatorial Guinea closed in on the knockout stages of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations by thrashing Guinea-Bissau. Nsue slotted in the first-half opener and struck twice after the break for the first Afcon treble since 2008.

Esteban Orozco's own goal sent the sides in level at half-time, but Josete Miranda's strike restored Equatorial Guinea's lead early in the second half. Ze Turbo netted a consolation for Guinea-Bissau in stoppage time.

The result sends Equatorial Guinea top of Group A on four points before hosts Ivory Coast face Nigeria (17:00 GMT) and puts Juan Micha's side on the brink of a place in the last 16 following their 1:1 draw against Nigeria on Sunday
