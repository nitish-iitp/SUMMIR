UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE: CROATIA SEAL COMEBACK WIN THROUGH ANDREJ KRAMARIC AS SCOTLAND SUFFER THIRD-STRAIGHT DEFEAT
BYRHYS JONES

UPDATED 12/10/2024 AT 18:54 GMT

Scotland let a 1-0 lead slip away as Croatia beat Steve Clarke's side 2-1 in Zagreb in the UEFA Nations League. It is a third defeat in Group 1 for the Scots, who sit bottom after suffering late defeats to Portugal and Poland, having matched their opponents for lengthy moments of each of the three clashes. Clarke's side now face Portugal on Tuesday in Glasgow.

Croatia beat Scotland 2-1 in Group 1 of the UEFA Nations League on Saturday, marking the Scots' third straight loss in League A.
It was another sickening last-gasp defeat for Scotland, who thought they had salvaged a draw with the last play of the game at the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb.

Kristijan Jakic scored an own goal in the 94th minute, only for Che Adams to be deemed offside, and VAR overturned the goal to break Scottish hearts and deny them a point.

Like against Portugal and Poland, Scotland had managed to match their opponents for lengthy moments of the tie, only to fade away and lose out to an agonising late goal.
Steve Clarke had to make do without several of his key players as a debilitating injury list has denied him the likes of Kieran Tierney, Jack Hendry and Aaron Hickey amongst others.
The absence of goalkeeper Angus Gunn also saw a return for 41-year-old Craig Gordon between the posts, while 18-year-old Ben Doak became the youngest player to start a competitive match for Scotland since Willie Johnston in 1965 - as reported by the BBC.

The loss now sees Clarke's side sit bottom of Group 1, with another clash with Portugal taking place on Tuesday at Hampden Park.
Scotland had taken a 1-0 lead against Croatia, only to let it slip three minutes later.
Ryan Christie struck first for the visitors in the 33rd minute. The Bournemouth midfielder took advantage of a dreadful attempt at a clearance in the box from Luka Sucic, who sliced the ball behind him for Christie to swivel into space and score.
Croatia responded almost immediately and the hosts levelled things up in a matter of minutes.
Igor Matanovic netted his first goal for his country with a crisp right-footed finish into the far corner after a neat cut-back from Ivan Perisic.
Despite that, the Scots continued to match their opponents for quality across the park, with Billy Gilmour proving to be a handful for the experienced Croatian midfield duo of Luka Modric and Mario Pasalic.
It took until around the 60th minute for Croatia to assert themselves on the game, and in the 70th it was Andrej Kramaric who scored the decisive goal.
The 33-year-old pounced on a rebound from Borna Sosa's shot which was parried by Gordon, and the striker simply headed home from close range.
As Scotland desperately probed for an equaliser, a dramatic finale unravelled as Adams found the net via Jakic, only for Scottish celebrations to be curtailed by an intervention from VAR.
