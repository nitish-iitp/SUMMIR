Scotland will be looking to bounce back from their September heartbreak in the Nations League when they face Croatia in Zagreb on Saturday.

Steve Clarke's side are playing in the competition's top tier for the first time this term after winning promotion to League A, and were stung twice by late winners as the new campaign got under way last month.

Nicola Zalewski's stoppage-time penalty earned Poland a 3-2 win at Hamden Park, while Cristiano Ronaldo robbed the Scots of a hard-earned point a few days later, popping up in the 88th minute to secure a 2-1 victory for Portugal.

That leaves the Scots on a run of one win in their last 14 and bottom Nations League Group A1, while Clarke's options are severely limited by injury issues.

A bleak outlook, then, for their trip to the Croatian capital, where Zlatko Dalić's side lie in wait.

They beat Poland last time out to pick up a first victory since their disappointing group stage exit at Euro 2024, and are in something of a transition period.

Experienced heads like Luka Modrić, Mateo Kovačić and Ivan Perišić remain part of the squad, but Dalić has recognised the need to try to bring the new generation through - a number of whom we may see against Scotland on Saturday.
