Luka Modric’s Croatia were up against Scotland in their first UEFA Nations League group stage game this international break. Zlatko Dalic’s side completed a comeback win after going down in the 32nd minute. Croatia picked up their second win in the group stage after a 1-0 win over Poland last month.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup runner’s up were off to a laborious start until a poor clearance attempt at the back had them trailing in the 32nd minute, thanks to a composed finish in the box by Ryan Christie. Croatia however wasted no time and immediately went on the offensive. Their efforts paid off, equalizing just four minutes later after Ivan Perisic and Igor Matanovic combined for their opener.

Croatia looked far more threatening in the second half, registering 11 shots to Scotland’s four and forcing some good saves. However, a sequence initiated by their captain, Modric, had them equalized from close range through Andre Kramaric in the 70th minute. Scotland brought on Che Adams, who created a lot of danger in the final 13 minutes of the game but couldn’t find the goal.

The game almost had a dramatic end to it with Scotland having the ball in the back of the net with the last kick of the game, only for it to be called back for offside, meaning Croatia walk away with all three points.

Luka Modric performance vs Scotland

Modric captained the side and was impactful throughout the game. The 39-year-old orchaestrated the play through the middle, covering every blade of the grass, while imposing himself on and off the ball. He won all three of his tackles, made six recoveries and intercepted the ball six times as well. While he might not have picked up an assist, his ability to disrupt play and kickstart attacks in one swift move was evident on multiple Croatia’s sequences.

His passing was crisp, helping his side traverse vertically on the pitch. The former Ballon d’Or winner was the perfect link between the defence and the attack line. He positioned himself well between the lines, in the half-spaces on either side while dictating his sides possession. A performance much akin to his old times.

Croatia have six points from their first three games in the group and are set to face Poland in their next game on 15th October.
