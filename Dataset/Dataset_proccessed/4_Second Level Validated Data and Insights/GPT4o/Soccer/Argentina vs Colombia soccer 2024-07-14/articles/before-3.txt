For Argentina’s advancement, Julián Álvarez scored in the first half of the semifinal against Canada. Lionel Messi secured their spot with his first goal in the tournament, ending in a 2-0 victory.

While Colombia only has one Copa America win from 2001, Argentina is looking to become the tournament’s historic champion with a record-breaking 16 wins. Safe to say a lot is on the line for both teams.
