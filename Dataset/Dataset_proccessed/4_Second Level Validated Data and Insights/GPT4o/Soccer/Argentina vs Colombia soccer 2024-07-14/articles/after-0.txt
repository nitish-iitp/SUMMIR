Moreno: Argentina got better when Messi exited

Alejandro Moreno explains why Argentina became better after Lionel Messi came off the pitch.

Defending champions Argentina overcame the loss of Lionel Messi to win a record 16th Copa América title by beating Colombia 1-0, thanks to a late extra-time goal from substitute Lautaro Martínez at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.

Inter Milan striker Martínez, the tournament's leading goal scorer, latched onto a precise through ball from Giovani Lo Celso before lifting his effort over advancing Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas in the 112th minute.

Messi appeared to suffer a noncontact injury while running and falling in the 64th minute and covered his face with his hands when he sat on the bench.

Martínez later ran to the bench to hug his captain after the goal that propelled Argentina to surpass Uruguay for the most Copa América titles.

The win also marked Angel Di Maria's final Argentina match after the 36-year-old said last year he would retire from international football after the Copa, while defender Nicolas Otamendi, 36, is also set to end his international career.

"The truth is, this was written, it was this way," Di Maria said. "I dreamed it, I dreamed that I would arrive to the final and win it and retire in this way.

"I have so many beautiful feelings and I am eternally grateful to this generation and today I am leaving in this way with a title."

In a match that started over 75 minutes late because of crowd trouble at Hard Rock Stadium, Argentina won their third straight major title following the 2021 Copa América and 2022 World Cup and matched Spain, who won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships around the 2010 World Cup.

Argentina also stopped Colombia's 28-game unbeaten streak dating to a February 2022 loss to the Albiceleste, when Martínez also scored the only goal.

Martínez entered in the 97th minute and scored from Giovani Lo Celso's perfect through pass. Just inside the penalty area, Martínez sent a right-foot shot through the upraised arms of sliding goalkeeper Camilo Vargas for his 29th international goal, his tournament-high fifth.

Making his 39th and possibly last Copa América appearance at age 37, Messi had one goal in the tournament. He went down after his ankle was stepped on in the first half but remained in the game.

"Messi had to leave because of that ankle problem, but finally we were able to give him some joy," Di Maria, who jointly lifted the trophy alongside captain Messi and Otamendi at the presentation ceremony, added.

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi looked to the bench as soon as he fell to the field in the second half, appearing to know his tournament was over. He took off his right boot as he walked off and slammed it in frustration, and his ankle appeared to swell.

The start was delayed from 8 p.m. ET to 9:22 p.m. because of crowd control issues outside the stadium, including troves of fans breaching security gates at a venue to be used for the 2026 World Cup.

Days after Uruguay players were involved in a brawl with Colombia fans following their semifinal match in Charlotte, North Carolina, video showed fans climbing fences and railings to get inside the championship match, with officials unable to keep track of who had purchased tickets and who hadn't.

Colombia was more aggressive and forced goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez to make four saves in the first half, but Argentina began to threaten more in the second.

Nicolás Tagliafico thought he scored in the 75th minute but was ruled offside. Nicolas Gonzalez, who replaced Messi, was stopped by Vargas in the 95th minute.

Numerous players lost their footing during the second half of Sunday's match. The grass was heavily watered with sprinklers following the half-time performance by Colombian pop star Shakira, which caused an extended half-time break.
