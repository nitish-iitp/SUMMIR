Argentina win 2024 Copa America on a dramatic day

The Copa America final between Argentina and Colombia was delayed by more than an hour after chaotic and dangerous scenes saw thousands of fans prevented from entering the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

The match finally got underway at 9:22pm ET, 82 minutes after it was scheduled to start. Argentina went on to beat Colombia 1-0 after extra time to defend their Copa America crown, despite their star player Lionel Messi being forced off with an injury.

Miami-Dade Police Department said that there were “several incidents” before the gates opened at the stadium. Fans spoken to by The Athletic blamed organizers CONMEBOL. “It’s a disaster,” one said. “They won’t even give water. Not even water!”

Supporters, including young children, were left stranded outside the stadium in large numbers with the searing heat in the area only adding to the issues. And a number of fans were ejected from the stadium throughout the game. For a full recap, click here.

Scaloni: 'This team never ceases to surprise'

As they did in their last two major-tournament campaigns, Argentina pulled a rabbit out of a hat when they needed to do it most against Colombia. Scaloni was asked if a third-straight trophy was an era-defining one.

“I don't know if it marks an era, but it's true this team never ceases to surprise, they overcame the difficulties of a very difficult match, with a very complicated opponent and without a good first half,” he said.

“In the second half I think we improved and deserved to win and then always in extra time, in the long run the team always finds something extra, so it's gratifying to see them play and I'm eternally grateful for the way they give their all.”

Lorenzo: 'We're just getting started'

The narrow extra-time defeat marked a first defeat for Colombia in 29 matches and coach Lorenzo was upbeat when he spoke afterwards.

“Of the two finalists there is one who is marking an era, it is not a coincidence and before this era they lost two Copa America finals and a World Cup final,” he said. “Scaloni has been with the boys for seven years, I congratulate them. We’re just getting started.

“I hope we play in the next final and qualify for the World Cup. I’m proud of the boys. I thank the players.”

Pre-match delays had an impact, says Lorenzo

Speaking after the defeat, Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo claimed that the pre-match delay affected his side's preparations.

“I think we had a very good build-up to the game but then some unusual situations started to happen,” he said. “(The players) warmed up, cooled down, warmed up again, before the kick-off. Then we had 25 minutes of half-time, strange things for both teams.”

He then discussed the difference in experience of the two teams.

“Generally the tension is felt more by those who have less experience in finals, and it took its toll on us,” added Lorenzo. “It’s not easy to play in a final for everyone, the boys felt a bit of the effort of the whole tournament, they played six games in 21 days.”

Argentina are special – Copa America proves they just win

Getty Images

There’s something special about Argentina, but it isn’t their football. The three-time world champions stumbled their way to a second consecutive Copa America with a 1-0 extra-time win over Colombia. It proved one thing: Argentina just keep winning.

That’s what champions do. Over four weeks in the United States, Argentina never found their best form. Their possession-based philosophy didn’t overwhelm their opponents. Lionel Messi, who won his 45th title as a professional, was a shadow of himself.

Messi, 37, was impactful in flashes but he has been hampered by a groin injury since June 25. He was substituted in the 66th minute of the final with what appeared to be a painful right ankle injury. Yet still, Argentina walked away with their third straight major trophy — the 2022 World Cup sandwiched between the 2021 Copa and this one — becoming the first South American team to do so. The Albiceleste matched the great Spain team that achieved the same feat from 2008-2012.

As did Lo Celso

Those three extra-time substitutions from Lionel Scaloni will go down in history for Argentina as they all played a key role in the goal.

Paredes won the ball back and gave it Lo Celso who played a perfectly timed pass into Lautaro and you know the rest!

That was Lo Celso's 14th assist for Argentina since Scaloni took the job as manager in 2018 — only Messi (with 16 assists) has more in that time.

Substitute Paredes made a telling contribution

Like matchwinner Lautaro, Leandro Paredes was introduced in the seventh minute of extra time. And like the Inter Milan striker, Paredes made his presence count.

He made four tackles during his time on the pitch, more than any of his team-mates throughout the entirety of the match. He also became the first player in the 21st century to make that many tackles as a substitute in a Copa America final.

Oh, and it was one of those tackles that started off the move for the winning goal.

Some contribution from the Roma midfielder!

Di Maria: 'I'll always be grateful to this generation'

As he said leading into the match, Di Maria knows only too well how it feels to be on the losing side at a major tournament. He was part of the Argentina squad beaten in the final of the 2014 World Cup as well as those in 2015 and 2016 Copa America.

"I'll be always grateful to this generation who gave me everything, helped me win what I always wanted and today," he said after the win against Colombia. "I am leaving like this. It could not be better."

Thankfully Argentina didn't need Di Maria's goals

Getty Images

36-year-old Di Maria turned in a vintage performance for Argentina who, for once in a final, didn't need one of his goals.

He scored in the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup finals as his country lifted the trophies on both occasions. This final marks the first in 30 years that Argentina have won without Di Maria being on the scoresheet.

By the time they make it to another final, they will be without the former Real Madrid winger...

The worst time for Colombia to draw a blank

Getty Images

Colombia led 2024 Copa America for goals scored with 12 across their seven matches.

They managed six throughout the group stage and six in their first two knockout games. But when it mattered, in the final, they failed to find the net for the first time at the tournament, despite having eight more shots across the 120 minutes than Argentina.

Lautaro joins Batistuta in Argentinian folklore

Lautaro Martinez's winning goal in extra time was his fifth goal of 2024 Copa America, earning him the Golden Boot.

Since the start of the 1960s, he is just the second player to score more than four goals in a victorious Copa America campaign.

The other? Countryman Gabriel Batistuta who scored six times in the 1991 edition.

Scaloni on Lionel Messi’s injury

Getty Images

Lionel Scaloni has said that Lionel Messi attempted to play through the pain in the 2024 Copa America final “because he did not want to let his team-mates down”.

Messi received medical treatment in the first half and was withdrawn in the second with an apparent leg injury. Cameras later showed him on the bench with a badly swollen right ankle.

“Leo has something that everyone should have. He's the best in history and, even with an ankle like that, he doesn't want to go off,” Scaloni said.

“But it's not because he is selfish, but because he does not want to let his team-mates down. He was born to be on a pitch.”

Sanchez: ‘Colombia deserves everything but we go on’

Tonight’s result means that Colombia’s incredible 28-match unbeaten streak has come to an end. Their last result prior to tonight? Argentina, in February 2022.

Davinson Sanchez, formerly of Tottenham Hotspur and now plying his trade with Galatasaray in Turkey, was one of the few Colombia players to front up after they fell at the final hurdle.

“It hurts after a tournament that the whole team fought for, it hurts when you compete to win and we felt we deserved more. But we have to thank the people,” he said.

“We wanted to give the victory to a country that deserves it, Colombia deserves everything, and we leave empty-handed, but we will go on.”

Scaloni on Di Maria: ‘He ran like he was 25’

Getty Images

Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni is full of praise for the departing Angel Di Maria, who disappears into the sunset this evening having won 145 caps for his country, along with two Copa America titles at the 2022 World Cup.

Scaloni said: “He’s had some spectacular games for us but today was one of the best.

“He had the energy to press high when others were faltering. He ran like he was 25. I tried to convince him to carry on, at least to play again in front of his public. He's a legend.”

Needless to say Di Maria isn’t 25 — he turned 36 in February.

Incredible stat here: Emiliano Martinez has now played 45 times in goal for Argentina. He has kept 33 clean sheets. THIRTY THREE! That is beyond spectacular.

Argentina conceded only one goal in this tournament, becoming just the fourth team ever to play at least five matches in a single edition of the tournament and concede one or zero goals.

Winning goal was a rare sight

Prior to this match, there hadn't been an extra-time goal in the Copa America final since 1937! Lautaro Martínez’s winner was only the fourth ever in extra time of a Copa America final.

The other three were one by Arthur Friedenreich for Brazil against Uruguay in 1919 and two by Vicente de la Mata for Argentina against Brazil in 1937.

Emi Martínez has become the first Argentina goalkeeper to record five clean sheets in a single edition of Copa América. He allowed just one goal, coming from Ecuador's Kevin Rodríguez in the quarterfinal.

Martinez was instrumental in Argentina's victory in this tournament, particularly distinguishing himself during the penalty shootout against Ecuador.

Reader reaction: 'My heart rate won’t recover for a while'

Getty Images

We've had more than 600 comments on our discussion page for this match, and here are a few of the choice ones reacting to Argentina's victory.

Carlos M.: I think Colombia was the best team of the tournament. But Argentina knows how to win these games. The fact that Colombia had one less day of rest and had a tougher semifinal game than Argentina really showed beginning in the 75th minute.

Caroline C.: Lautaro!!! I’m so glad he scored and decided it after a confidence diminishing World Cup (for him). I’m so happy Paredes came in too. The De Paul, Lo Celso, Paredes midfield is class. Though credit to Mac Allister and Enzo for playing great too. Fair play to Colombia. You guys played really well and my heart rate won’t recover for a while. It was an even game. We’ll see you for qualifiers.

Jose A.: Was this a Colombia bottle job or Argentina rising to the occasion, again? Colombia arguably played the best football in the tournament, with James doing a true comeback MVP performance, but LOS MUCHACHOS have so much experience at this, they can limp though a tournament like this and still have the resources to get it done. Much more impressive is that this one was won with Messi being sub-par for long stretches of the Cup, with injury problems to boot in the final.
