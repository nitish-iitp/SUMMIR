DUESSELDORF, Germany - Following is reaction to France's 1-0 win over Belgium in the Euro 2024 round of 16 in Duesseldorf on Monday, which sets them up for a quarter-final match with either Portugal or Slovenia.

France coach Didier Deschamps: "It's beautiful, we played a big game, it was tight but enjoyed possession and we had more opportunities."

"We had several chances but missed the target. We did a lot of good things. We have to savour it, it's quite an achievement. We're in the quarter finals, they're going home."

"We made a lot of progress and the opponent was a little more cautious, even though on paper they're an offensive, attacking team."

"We created more chances than Belgium did, we were on the back foot, playing a waiting game but wouldn't fall into the trap they were looking for."

"We were firing shots but they weren't on target ... we're into the quarter-finals and that's what counts."

"We're into the quarter-finals, let's not play down that moment."

France's Randal Kolo Muani: "We're enjoying this, we pushed hard, we had a lot of attempts but we were missing the target. I got lucky (on the goal), the coach had told me to bring my energy ... to bring danger with my speed. I tried to bring some freshness to the game."

Belgian captain Kevin De Bruyne: "We did everything to try to win. We were five minutes from extra time."

"We had chances, not so many. Then they score and there isn't enough time to react.

"We were defending pretty well but then there's a deflection. It's a shame but that's football... I had that chance towards the end but couldn't score. The keeper did well. The team really did everything we could do."

Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco: "We will analyse the games, analyse the Euros, we will see in a few weeks.

"We're too disappointed to go into details ... we can't say we were lucky during this tournament."

France's Jules Kounde, the player of the match: "My job is always to defend but when there are spaces to get into, I try to do everything for the team."

"I was surprised (by Belgium playing defensively) as they're usually more on the offensive. On a tactical front, we were all together, attacking together."

"In my opinion it was the best game of the competition for us. We had a comprehensive game, we were in it to win it and the goal came - it all paid off in the end."

"We have to do better and should do better (in scoring goals) but we are creating a lot of chances, I trust the attackers will score goals."

"I have that competitive spirit, I want to win the Euros, as many matches as possible, and the whole team is aligned with that."

Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels: "It was for us a very middling tournament ... I think it will be a very quiet changing room full of disappointment." REUTERS
