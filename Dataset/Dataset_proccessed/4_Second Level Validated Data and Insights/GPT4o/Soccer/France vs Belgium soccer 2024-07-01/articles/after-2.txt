Germany fans sing You'll Never Walk Alone before Euro 2024 match

France reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 after edging past Belgium in a scrappy and tight contest in Dusseldorf.

Les Bleus were the more proactive side, looking to feed Kylian Mbappe and Marcus Thuram the ball as they ventured further up the pitch with Belgium electing for a back five approach off the ball. Thuram met a cross with a solid header in the first half only to send it over the top. That was a story of the match for France. Wonderful build-up play to bring the ball into the penalty area but no clinical finishing. Midway through the second half they’d had 19 shots with just one on target.

Belgium had their moments too. As the game wore on Romelu Lukaku spun into the 18-yard area and forced a save from Mike Maignan at the near post and Kevin De Bruyne came close with blazing effort from range only for Maignan to keep him out too.

Then came the decisive moment. Jules Kounde giving the ball to N’Golo Kante, Kante slipping Randal Kolo Muani into the box, Kolo Muani’s shot hitting Jan Vertonghen, the ball deflecting past Koen Casteels and crossing the line. Belgium will be gutted, France ecstatic. Les Bleus are into the quarter-finals.

The piece of luck that sent dour France past Belgium and into Euro 2024 quarter-finals

Of course, it wasn’t pretty. Didier Deschamps won’t care. All that matters, the French coach would strenuously argue, is that they got there. That could be said about France’s winning goal and the very 1-0 last-16 win over Belgium it decided.

After 85 minutes of what had perhaps been the worst football in this tournament – outside, maybe, some of England’s games – substitute Randal Kolo Muani tried a speculative shot that was mishit off the ground and deflected off the unfortunate Jan Vertonghen and in.

The game maybe deserved that, but it’s arguable whether France did. An otherwise sensationally talented squad made their way into the quarter-finals by dour obduracy rather than any creativity or class. It may yet take them to victory, of course, but it doesn’t make much of it memorable. The most stirring moment of the game was a tackle, which was Theo Hernandez on Yannick Carrasco.

If this is Kevin De Bruyne’s last stand, Belgium have wasted it at Euro 2024

Three days prior to Belgium’s last-16 clash with France, Kevin De Bruyne celebrated his 33rd birthday. As it was a rest day at the European Championship, he may actually have celebrated, with teammates at least.

We may be in an era where elite players enjoy longer careers, generally speaking, but there’s no way to avoid the truth of this tremendous player’s advancing years: injuries have significantly hampered him for club and country over the past couple of campaigns, to the extent of missing major finals and being unable to contribute at some very important moments, as well as needing surgery more than once.

Add into the equation a dwindling contract at club level which the player himself has acknowledged means all options are on the table - including a move to a less-than-stellar league where few have remained playing at the elite level on current evidence - and it all means that there is a high likelihood Euro 2024 might have been be De Bruyne’s final tournament in, or anywhere near, his prime. Maybe his last full stop.

If this is Kevin De Bruyne’s last stand, Belgium have wasted it at Euro 2024

The Red Devils are out in the last 16 and their playmaker was marginalised by their tactics

France v Belgium player ratings as late Jan Vertonghen own goal settles tight Euro 2024 tie

France edged out Belgium to advance to the Euro 2024 quarter-finals as Jan Vertonghen’s late own goal settled a tight affair in Dusseldorf.

With Belgium sat deep, France struggled mightily to create clear chances despite controlling the contest, flashing a series of finishes wide and high but never looking particularly likely to break through.

But they finally struck five minutes from time, Randal Kolo Muani releasing a shot at the end of a fluent passing move that took a healthy piece of Vertonghen’s knee to beat Koen Casteels in the Belgian goal.

But how did each player perform? Here are The Independent’s player ratings:

Roy Keane reacts to Belgium’s Euro 2024 exit:

“It’s tough on them. I think France were the better team. Obviously, the quality wasn’t really there.

“It wasn’t a surprise that it was an own goal that settled the game. You also need a bit of luck. France kept a clean sheet and when you do that, you will always have a chance.”

Full-time! France 1-0 Belgium

90+3 mins: France get over the line!

They needed help, a Jan Vertonghen own goal, late in the match to finally break through Belgium’s defence. Domenico Tedesco set up his team to defend strongly and use the counter attack to hurt France.

They tried their best and for 84 minutes held their own. A late goal sends Les Bleus into the quarter-finals where either Portugal or Slovenia awaits.

88 mins: The goal have actually gone down as a Jan Vertonghen own goal. It is currently the deciding factor in this last-16 tie. How many added minutes will there be for Belgium to save themselves?

England managed to yesterday, can Belgium emulate them?

GOAL! France 1-0 Belgium (Kolo Muani, 85’)⚽️

85 mins: Heartbreak for Belgium.

France move the ball superbly. Short passes from the left wing sees them bring the ball across to Jules Kounde who rolls it back to N’Golo Kante.

Kante slips a pass into the box for Randal Kolo Muani who checks to the right and shoots. There’s a big deflection which wrongfoots the goalkeeper.

Koen Casteels drops to his right and the ball passes on his left. France were care, they’re in front with just a few minutes left!

84 mins: Save! Was that the moment for Belgium?

They burst up the pitch after picking out Lukaku. He gives it Doku who feeds De Bruyne. The Belgium captain lets the ball roll across to his right foot and smashes a shot at goal only for Mike Maignan to slap it clear as he drops to the right.

Big moment, huge save.
