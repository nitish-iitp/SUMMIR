France lineup vs. Belgium: Predicted XI for Euro 2024 last-16 tie

France head coach Didier Deschamps is facing an intriguing selection dilemma in the final third for Monday's Euro 2024 last-16 tie with Belgium at the Merkur Spiel-Arena in Dusseldorf.

Les Bleus were forced to accept second place in Group D behind Austria on account of their 1-1 draw with Poland on Tuesday, where Kylian Mbappe's spot kick preceded Robert Lewandowski's own penalty.

The former's first goal of Euro 2024 came upon his return to the starting lineup from a broken nose, and as he came through the full 90 unscathed, he will no doubt be given the thumbs-up to continue in the final third.

The identity of the 25-year-old's supporting cast remains a topic of uncertainty, though, as Antoine Griezmann should almost certainly return after being benched in the final group game, but Ousmane Dembele's spot on the right will apparently come under some threat.

Instead of the Paris Saint-Germain attacker, Marcus Thuram is reportedly set to start in tandem with Mbappe up front, with Griezmann - taking the place of Bradley Barcola - operating just behind them.

Such a switch would see Deschamps change his formation to a 4-3-1-2 shape, with N'Golo Kante, Aurelien Tchouameni and Adrien Rabiot manning the midfield.

Deschamps's backline has remained untouched throughout the tournament, and that theme should continue here, as Theo Hernandez, William Saliba, Dayot Upamecano and Jules Kounde shield Mike Maignan, left vexed by Lewandowski's retaken penalty on Tuesday after he was penalised for coming off his line.

France possible starting lineup:
Maignan; Kounde, Saliba, Upamecano, Hernandez; Kante, Tchouameni, Rabiot; Griezmann; Thuram, Mbappe
