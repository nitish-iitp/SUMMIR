        "Roy Keane reacted to Belgium\u2019s Euro 2024 exit, stating, 'It\u2019s tough on them. I think France were the better team. Obviously, the quality wasn\u2019t really there. It wasn\u2019t a surprise that it was an own goal that settled the game. You also need a bit of luck. France kept a clean sheet and when you do that, you will always have a chance.'"
