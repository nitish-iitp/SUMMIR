Moldova vs Malta Predictions
Can Moldova Dominate Malta in Their Nations League Opener?

Malta have lost eight of their last 10 away games and failed to score in five of those.
Ion Nicolaescu has scored 10 goals in his last 20 international appearances.
Best Bet


Erling Haaland to Score Anytime @ 10/13




BET HERE


Reasoning
Erling Haaland is an excellent bet to score, given his nine goals this season and incredible Champions League record. Inter’s defensive vulnerabilities make it likely he’ll extend his scoring streak.

Moldova and Malta are set to clash in the UEFA Nations League, with both sides aiming to make a strong start in the competition. Moldova, buoyed by a near miss in their Euro 2024 qualification campaign, will host the out-of-form Malta at the Stadionul Zimbru in Chisinau. While Moldova look to build on their promising performances from recent months, Malta arrive with little momentum after a series of disappointing results. This encounter provides a great opportunity for Moldova to assert themselves as favourites in their group.

Given the current form of both teams, Moldova to win stands out as the best bet for this match. Moldova’s recent performances, including taking points off teams like Poland and Albania in the Euro 2024 qualifiers, underline their potential. They will be returning to competitive action with a sense of purpose and confidence, especially in front of their home crowd. In contrast, Malta have struggled, losing all eight of their Euro 2024 qualifiers and conceding a staggering 20 goals in that period.

Moldova’s offensive capabilities, led by Ion Nicolaescu, who has 10 goals in his last 20 appearances, will be a significant factor in this match. Nicolaescu’s sharpness in front of goal will pose a real threat to a Malta defence that has conceded an average of 2.5 goals per game in their last 20 outings. Moldova’s ability to create chances, with an average of 8.9 shots per game, gives them a clear attacking advantage, especially against a Maltese side that struggles to hold possession and limit opposition opportunities.

On the defensive front, Moldova are relatively solid, having kept two clean sheets in their last eight matches. They will be confident of keeping a Malta side quiet, especially given that Malta have only scored twice in their last eight games. Moldova’s defensive resilience is supported by their high clearance rate (27.1 per game) and ability to intercept the ball effectively (9.5 per game), which should frustrate Malta’s attack. Furthermore, Malta’s inability to capitalise on scoring opportunities, with just 1.5 shots on target per match, highlights their limited threat in the final third.

According to BettingTips4You.com expert Steve Harrington, “Moldova’s home advantage, coupled with Malta’s poor form, makes a home win the most likely outcome. With Moldova’s key players performing well and Malta struggling for goals, a comfortable victory for the hosts is on the cards.” Moldova have the added benefit of fielding a settled team, with left-back Oleg Reabciuk expected to earn his 50th cap and lead from the back. In contrast, Malta are going through a transitional phase, with key players retiring and uncapped players stepping in, which will likely disrupt their defensive cohesion.

With all these factors considered, Moldova are well-positioned to secure a win, and backing them to emerge victorious seems a strong option. Given Malta’s track record, it’s hard to see how they will overcome Moldova’s organised defence and goal-scoring capabilities.

Correct Score Prediction: Moldova 2-0 Malta

New customers only. Register with BETFRED50. Deposit £10+ via Debit Card and place first bet £10+ at Evens (2.0)+ on Sports within 7 days to get 3 x £10 in Sports Free Bets & 2 x £10 in Acca Free Bets within 10 hours of settlement. 7-day expiry. Eligibility & payment exclusions apply. T&Cs apply.

In line with the best bet, a 2-0 scoreline in favour of Moldova seems the most plausible outcome. Moldova have shown the ability to score multiple goals against lower-ranked teams, and with Nicolaescu leading the attack, they are likely to find the net more than once. Malta’s inability to score, particularly in the first half, will make it difficult for them to break through Moldova’s defence, which has only conceded 1.3 goals per game on average.

Moldova’s average of 0.9 goals per game may seem modest, but against a vulnerable Malta defence that concedes 2.5 goals per match, they should find enough opportunities to net at least twice. Malta, on the other hand, have been shut out in five of their last 10 away games, further supporting the prediction of a 2-0 Moldova victory.
