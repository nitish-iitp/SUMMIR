Malta’s ambition of winning promotion in the UEFA Nations League suffered a simmering blow as the national team slumped to a disappointing defeat to Moldova in Chisinau on Saturday.

First-half goals from Mihail Caimacov and an Ion Nicolaescu penalty conversion earned the Moldovans three crucial points that put them well in the driving season in League D Group 2, despite this being the first match of the campaign.

This is because with Andorra, the other team in the group, unlikely to challenge for top spot in the group, Saturday’s match between Moldova and Malta held high stakes with the winner making a major step towards promotion.

Moldova fully deserved their win as they were in control against a Malta side that was shorn of some key personnel such as defensive duo Enrico Pepe and Steve Borg and influential midfielder Teddy Teuma who was not passed fit enough to start the match and was only a second-half substitute.

The loss of Teuma was a major blow for Malta as the team lacked any flair moving forward, particularly in the first half where the team failed to have a shot on target.

The inclusion of Montebello after the break added more threat but still was not enough to avoid defeat.

Malta will now have to beat Andorra in La Vella on Tuesday to keep their flickering hopes alive ahead of their decisive clash against Moldova at the National Stadium on October 13.

Malta coach Michele Marcolini, who was already without experienced defenders Steve Borg and Enrico Pepe, was forced to leave out influential midfielder Teddy Teuma who failed to fully recover from an injury he picked up with his club Stade Reims and started on the bench.

Sliema midfielder Steve Pisani was given the nod to start just in front of team skipper Matthew Guillaumier.

The home side made a bright start and after three minutes of play Caimacov sped inside the area and fed Ionita who fired wide.

Malta were looking to remain compact against a Moldova side who, as expected, were dominating possession, with the visitors looking to catch the home side with quick transition play on Kemar Reid and Paul Mbong.

However, the Maltese were struggling to keep hold of the ball as their distribution towards the forwards left much to be desire.

On 22 minutes, Ionita let fly a stinging low drive but his shot just missed the upright.

Malta finally threatened two minutes later when Ryan Camenzuli sped clear on the right but his cross was not met by Paul Mbong from a few metres out.

On 31 minutes Moldova took the lead with a stunning goal.

Jean Borg conceded a free-kick just outside the penalty area and Caimacov let fly a spectacular curling drive that flew into the top corner of the net.

After that setback one expected Malta to be more offensive but the Moldovans kept control of the game with their passing play, giving little opportunity to the visitors to threaten.

On the stroke of half-time Paul Mbong was upended just inside the area but the referee waved play on.

Instead, it was Moldova who doubled their lead.

Caimacov nicked between two Maltese defenders but was upended by Bonello with the referee immediately pointing to the spot.

Nicolescu stepped up and sent Bonello the wrong way to put Moldova firmly on their way.

After that double set-back, it was no surprise that Marcolini made a double change at the break as Luke Montebello and Carlo Zammit Lonardelli were roped in at the expense of Reid and Yankam.

Montebello almost left an instant mark and on 47 minutes he sped clear on the right but his shot was too central to trouble Celeadnic.

At the other end, Nicolaescu almost grabbed his second goal of the match on 53 minutes when he powered past his marker, but his shot came off the upright.

Montebello’s inclusion added more penetration to Malta’s forward line and the Ħamrun striker fed Paul Mbong on the hour mark but the Birkirkara forward fired into the sidenetting.

Twenty minutes from time, Marcolini roped in Teuma and Kyrian Nwoko in a bid to add more firepower and try to reopen the match.

Thirteen minutes from time, Montebello picked up a short clearance by the Moldova defence on a Teuma free-kick but his shot finished wide.
