Malta beaten 2-0 in Chisinau
National Team UEFA
 7 September 2024 by Antoine Busuttil

Two goals late in the first half handed Moldova a 2-0 win over Malta in the first match from Group D2 of the UEFA Nations League at the Stadionul Zimbru in Chisinau.

As expected, the hosts played a very aggressive game pushing tthe boys in red in their own half especially during the first half. The Maltese kept their opponents at bay for half an hour but then Moldova managed to break the deadlock, scoring a second goal thanks to a penalty just before the end of the first half.

With Steve Borg and Enrico Pepe, Marcolini opted to start with Zach Muscat, Kurt Shaw and Jean Borg at the back. On the other hand, Teddy Teuma still struggling to regain full fitness, Steve Pisani joined Matthew Guillaumier and Yannick Yankam in midfield

Henry Bonello started in goal with Muscat, Shaw and Borg at the back, Joseph Mbong and Ryan Camenzuli on the flanks, Yankam, Guillaumier and Pisani in midfield with Paul Mbong and Kemar Reid employed up front.

The hosts went close after six minutes when Caimacov released Platica on the right and off the latter’s pass, Artur Ionita hit just wide. Two minutes later, Ionita served Caimacov from the left and the latter controlled before hitting wide. Ionita then had a powerful shot from outside the area which scraped past the post on 23 minutes. 

Malta replied with a good cross by Ryan Camenzuli from the left and although Yannick Yankam failed to connect, Paul Mbong controlled the ball and tested goalkeeper Celeadnic with an angled shot from the right on 25 minutes.

Seven minutes later, Moldova took the lead as Mihail Caimacov’s direct freekick from the right gave goalkeeper Bonello no chance.

Four minutes in added time, Moldova doubled the score when they were awarded a penalty as Ukrainian referee Mykola Balakin ordered a penalty for what was adjudged to be a foul by Bonello on Caiamacov and from the penalty spot, Ion Nicolaescu converted.

For the second half,  Marcolini replaced Yannick Yankam and Kemar Reid with Carlo Zammit Lonardelli and Luke Montebello and after just two minutes, the Hamrun player tested the Moldovan goalkeeper when served on the left by Paul Mbong.

But on 52 minutes, Nicolaescu almost increased the lead when he gained possession on the edge of the area but his conclusion hit the foot of the upright. A freekick by Caimacov ended just over the bar on 66 minutes. Five minutes later, Bonello performed a good save on a Ionita freekick.

Matthew Guilluamier had a powerful drive from outside the area parried by Celeadnic on 84 minutes.
