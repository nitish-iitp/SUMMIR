Senegal eye first win from Group L in AFCON qualifier
 September 9, 2024
 @football_sierra

Senegal will try to recover from a slow start in their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying campaign when they play against Burundi in a Group L match at the Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi, on Monday, 9 September.

In their last game, Senegal looked like they were going to win at home against Burkina Faso, but gave up a late goal, ending in a 1-1 draw.

Senegal’s coach, Aliou Cisse, was disappointed with the result but defended the team’s game plan.

On the other hand, Burundi comes into the match as the Group L leaders after securing a 3-2 away win over Malawi.

In their history of playing against each other, Senegal has won three out of four matches against Burundi, and their most recent meeting in June 2016 resulted in a 2-0 victory for Senegal.
