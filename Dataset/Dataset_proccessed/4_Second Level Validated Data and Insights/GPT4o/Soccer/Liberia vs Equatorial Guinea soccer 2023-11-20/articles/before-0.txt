Liberia vs Equatorial Guinea – Best Free Predictions and Betting Tips

Liberia suffered a 1-0 loss against Malawi in the first group match while Equatorial Guinea received a huge boost in the qualification battle following a 1-0 success over Namibia just a few days ago.

Match Result Prediction: Equatorial Guinea to win

Equatorial Guinea have been flying high in terms of momentum in recent form. The team are unbeaten in the last eight matches in all competitions. After consecutive stalemates a few months ago, the team has opened up the group stages with a victory over Namibia. Liberia could not be in a worse situation coming into the match after five straight defeats including the loss against Malawi in the opener.

Total Goals Prediction: Total goals under 2.5

Liberia are on the back of five consecutive losses and damage limitation will be the primary focus for the team. Equatorial Guinea are heading into the game on the back of eight matches without a defeat but they have been unable to get over 1.5 goals in any of the last four matches. Equatorial Guinea have not been without a big victory over the last few matches and it is unlikely to change in the upcoming match.

BTTS Prediction: Goals from both teams – no

Equatorial Guinea have been able to enjoy majority of their recent success owing to a strong defensive display in recent matches. Not many teams have been able to get the better of Equatorial Guinea and the resolute defence. This is explained by the team picking up back-to-back clean sheets in two different competitions. Liberia are without a goal in the last two games.
