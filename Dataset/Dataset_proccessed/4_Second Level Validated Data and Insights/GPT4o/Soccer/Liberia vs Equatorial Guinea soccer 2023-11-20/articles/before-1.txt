The action continues in Group H of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers as Liberia and Equatorial Guinea go head to head at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex on Monday.

These nations head into the game off the back of contrasting opening-day results, with the Nzalang Nacional claiming a narrow victory over Namibia in midweek.

Liberia were denied a dream start to the 2026 World Cup qualifiers as they suffered a 1-0 defeat at the hand of Malawi when the sides squared off in Monrovia on Friday.

Teenage striker Chifundo Mphasi came off the bench to grab the headlines at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex as he scored the winning goal in the 78th minute to hand the Flames all three points.

Ansumana Keita's men have now lost five games on the bounce and are without a win in their last eight across all competitions, losing six and claiming two draws since a 2-1 victory over Senegal in the Africa Nations Championship in July 2022.

This poor run of form saw the Lone Stars' dreams of a first Africa Cup of Nations appearance since 2002 come to an end as they finished rock bottom in Group K of the qualifiers after picking up just one point from four matches.

While Liberia will be looking to stop the rot on Monday, next up is an opposing side who they have failed to get the better of in their last three meetings, losing once and claiming two draws since September 2006.

Equatorial Guinea could not have hoped for a better start to their hunt for a first World Cup appearance as they picked up a 1-0 victory over Namibia at the Nuevo Estadio de Malabo last Wednesday.

Following a goalless first half, former Middlesbrough and Birmingham City man Emilio Nsue delivered the goods once again as he found the back of the net in the 64th minute to hand the hosts all three points.

This was in keeping with their impressive performance in the 2023 AFCON qualifiers, where they picked up 13 points from six matches in Group J and finished only behind group winners Tunisia on goal difference.

Juan Micha's side have won one of their five competitive games in 2023 — with a 1-1 draw against Libya on September 6 being the exception — and will look to close out the year on a high as they prepare for the 2023 AFCON which takes centre stage in January.

Having reached the quarter-finals in 2021, the Nzalang Nacional kick off their quest to conquer the continent for the first time on January 14, when they take on three-time champions Nigeria in Group A, where they have been drawn alongside Guinea-Bissau and Ivory Coast.

Brem Soumaoro and goalkeeper Boison Wynney were both forced off injured midway through the first half against Malawi on Friday and are major doubts for Liberia.

In their absence, Ashley Williams should start between the sticks on Monday, while Divine Teah, who has one goal in seven senior caps, should team up with Nohan Kenneh and skipper Oscar Dorley at the centre of the park.

In attack, 31-year-old Kpah Sherman should spearhead the Lone Stars once again, while Mohammed Kamara and former Ankaragum man Tonia Tisdell should start on either flank.

Fresh off the back of an injury-free victory over Namibia, Micha could name an unchanged XI on Monday, meaning that we could see a back four of Carlos Akapo, Esteban Orozco, Saul Coco and Basilio Ndong shielding Jesus Owono in goal.

With his winner against Namibia, Nsue has now moved into seventh place in the nation's all-time scoring chart with 36 goals and should lead the Nzalang Nacional attack, alongside Iban Salvador and 25-year-old Josete Miranda.


Liberia possible starting lineup:
Williams; Alajarin, Dweh, Sangare, Jamal; Teah, Dorley, Kenneh; Tisdell, Sherman, Kamara

Equatorial Guinea possible starting lineup:
Owono; Akapo, Orozco, Coco, Ndong; Bikoro, Ganet; Salvador, Machin, Miranda; Nsue


We say: Liberia 0-2 Equatorial Guinea

Equatorial Guinea have enjoyed a brilliant year and will be looking to end the calendar on a positive note. The Nzalang Nacional head into the game as the more in-form side and we are backing them to come away with all three points against Liberia who have lost their last five outings.
