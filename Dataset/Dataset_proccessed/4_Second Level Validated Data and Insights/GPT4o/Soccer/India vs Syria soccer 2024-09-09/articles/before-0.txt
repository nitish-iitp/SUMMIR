India vs Syria
Preview
Tournament: Intercontinental Cup 2024
Date: September 9, 2024
Kick-off time: 2pm GMT
Venue: Gachibowli Stadium, Hyderabad

India vs Syria will be the highlight clash of the Intercontinental Cup 2024 after the Blue Tigers were held to a goalless draw against Mauritius on September 3 at the same venue. This was the first match India played under new coach Manolo Marquez.

The game against Mauritius saw India play in Hyderabad for the first time in 16 years, and they were disappointed throughout the 90 minutes. In this tournament decider against Syria, India needs to level up their midfield if they are to have any chance of coming up with a much-needed win.

Syria’s striker, Mawas, is in incredible form and will prove to be a handful for the Indian defence. From what we have seen in the tournament till now, the Syrians are extremely disciplined and are well-oiled in the coaching department. Against Mauritius, Marquez’s men were clueless in the final third, which is something they can’t afford to do in this one!

If we are to even think of an Indian victory against Syria, it cannot be achieved with individual quality or a moment of brilliance. The Blue Tigers have to work together like a machine and overcome every single mental block that they will face against an aggressive and physical Syrian side in order to get something out of this match, especially considering the fact that Syria beat India 1-0 earlier this year in the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar.

Now that you have an overview of what’s happened leading up to this game, let’s take a look at India vs Syria Prediction and team news from both camps.

If Manolo Marquez decides to go defensive, especially with his tactics in midfield and maintaining a low block, we could see Anirudh Thapa in an attacking role instead of Sahal Abdul Samad as he did in the first match, because Thapa’s defensive transitions and ability to track back are better than that of Sahal. Subhasish Bose could start at left-back with Nikhil Poojary on the right. Chhangte and Manvir will be crucial in the attack.

Syria National Football Team News

Mustafa Abdullatif and Mahmoud Al-Mawas will be raring to go against an under-confident Indian side after having come up with brilliant performances against Mauritius. Al-Mawas scored the all-important goal against Mauritius and will be aiming to replicate his performance in the decider. The rest of the team is expected to be fit and raring to go against an Indian team that are low on confidence and can’t find the back of the net at the moment.

Key Players to Watch
Gurpreet Singh Sandhu (India)

The Bengaluru FC goalkeeper will have to be at his ultimate best to keep the ball out of India’s net when they take on a deadly Syrian attacking lineup. The Blue Tigers are in an era of extreme transition from the legend of Sunil Chhetri, so the weight of elevating the standards of this young team now lies on the very capable shoulders of Sandhu. This game demands for a leader in the Indian team and we believe Gurpreet will have his moment here!

Mahmoud Al-Mawas (Syria)

The 31-year-old attacking midfielder has been ever-present in the Syrian national team since 2012, having featured in 94 games for them, scoring 16 goals. His experience in finding pockets of space behind the opposition defence will prove to be crucial for Syria’s chances in this game. The Indian team is low on confidence and this is the environment in which Al-Mawas thrives. Expect him to shine!

India vs Syria Prediction

The Blue Tigers are still adjusting to a brand new system that Manolo Marquez is trying to establish and we think the wait for their first victory under new management is likely to extend. The Syrians are well-oiled and their attacking as well as defensive transitions are way better than their Indian counterparts.

However, we can expect India to come out all guns blazing in order to make a quick start and put the Syrians under pressure. We think the Indian team will score first, followed by a Syrian comeback later in the game when the Blue Tigers’ defenders get tired.

Predicted Score: India 1-2 Syria
