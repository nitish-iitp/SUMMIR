In Short
Syria defeated India 3-0 in the Intercontinental Cup
Marquez felt the scoreline was a fair reflection of the game
Marquez said his side was 1000 times better in the second half

India coach Manolo Marquez said that he was happy with his side's performance, especially in the second half despite losing to Syria on Monday, September 9. Syria won the match 3-0 on the day, but the hosts had a lot of good chances in the second half of the Intercontinental Cup match.

Speaking after the match, Marquez said he was angry in the first half as he felt his side was scared in the first few minutes. The India boss said that 3-0 wasn't a fair reflection of the game and felt they deserved to score. Marquez felt his side were brave in the second half of the match.

"I am angry with the first half. I don't like teams who are scared. We were completely scared in the first minutes. Their goal was an action we could avoid. I'm satisfied with the second half. I think 3-0 is not what happened in the game. I think we at least deserved to score. It was a very similar game to Syria vs Mauritius. They have very good players in counter-attack, and they killed us. We need to keep going. I repeat, in the second half, not only the attitude, the positioning, we were brave," said Marquez.

Team 1000 times better in 2nd half

After a rather lacklustre 1st half, India had a host of chances as they were able to test the Syrian goalkeeper. Liston Colaco would unleash a fiery shot that would rattle the crossbar and almost went in. Marquez felt that his side was 1000 times better in the second half of the match.

At least today we had chances. The other day, practically, we didn't arrive. Today we created some chances. We will score, yes, but today, I think we cannot say anything about not having this player or that player. The goalkeeper saved two or three very difficult balls. The performance in the second half is a positive. The team was 1000 times better in the second half than in the first half. We were very brave," said Marquez.
