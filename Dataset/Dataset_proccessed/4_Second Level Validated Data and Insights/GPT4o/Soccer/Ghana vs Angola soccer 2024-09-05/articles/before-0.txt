Fatawu Issahaku is confident in helping Ghana clinch victory in their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Angola.

The four-time African champions will trade tackles with the Palacas Negras on Thursday, September 5, 2024, at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi as they aim to begin on a strong note.

Fatawu Issahaku has suddenly become an instrumental player for the team evidenced by his heroics against Mali where he set up Jordan Ayew for the winning goal and again scored in Kumasi against Central African Republic in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

The Leicester City forward is hoping to continue brilliantly as the team gears up for the crucial encounter.

“It’s just another game and we just go with full energy. As we always have the support we are ready to also give all for the nation. We’re just going to give all and take a win. I just want to say we need the support. We are ready and we are going to give all for the nation to get the three points,” Issahaku stated after a training session in Accra.
