14:36 CET - Next up in the Asian Cup, Indonesia play Iraq in Group D. The two sides met back in November in a World Cup qualifier with Iraq romping to a 5-1 win.

Iraq are one of the few nations to have won the Asian Cup and will be fancied to get out of the group. Indonesia are one of the big sleeping giants of Asian football but have been in terrible form lately - they haven’t won since October.

14:34 CET - South Korea have beaten Bahrain 3-1 in their Asian Cup opener. Bahrain levelled the match shortly after the break but a Lee Kang-In double secured the win for the Koreans.
