    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Pedro Gon\u00e7alves, Angola's coach, told the media: 'Let's do what we haven't done before, this is our main objective. We know that if we win twice, we qualify. We will see how far our performance and ability will take us, but I think we can qualify from the group and try to win the knockout stage. If you do that, then you have a chance to go to the final. We'll see.'",
        "Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi spoke to the media: 'It is a huge pride to represent my country and lead this national team in incredible competitions like the AFCON and, at the same time, it is a huge responsibility because we are a football country and we have a population that loves football and especially the national team and we gave our people a lot of joy when we won the AFCON in 2019. We were disappointed with the last one because there were many expectations and we could not satisfy them, we could not satisfy ourselves first and we could not satisfy them, that's why we feel like we have to give something back at this AFCON.'",
        "'I know that there are many big teams; Since we were eliminated in the first round in Cameroon, we cannot say that we are favorites for this competition, no. We were not in the last World Cup, which was our main objective since 2019. We put a lot of energy into qualifying for 'This World Cup, in fact, was our first objective.'",
        "'So we can't say that we are favorites, we can't say that we are going to win, but we can say that we have prepared ourselves to give our best and to perform in this competition and go as far as possible.'"
