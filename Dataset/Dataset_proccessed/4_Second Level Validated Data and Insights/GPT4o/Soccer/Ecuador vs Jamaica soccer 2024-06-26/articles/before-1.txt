Two sides seeking their first points at the 2024 Copa America will square off in Group B action on Wednesday, as Ecuador battle Jamaica from Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.

La Tri conceded two quick goals in the second half of their opener, losing 2-1 to Venezuela, while the Reggae Boyz were narrowly defeated 1-0 by Mexico.

Playing a man short for over an hour became too much to overcome for Ecuador last week as their two-match winning run came to an end.

A VAR red card decision reduced them to 10 men on 22 minutes, as Felix Sanchez Bas saw his side on the back foot, with a mere 16% possession following the expulsion.

Even so, they managed to go in front five minutes before the break but could not hang on, losing for only the third time in their previous 11 contests.

It is the third straight time that La Tri lost their opening match of this tournament, while they are now winless in nine consecutive Copa America encounters.

Their defeat on Saturday was the first time since October 2021 that Ecuador went on to lose a match when leading at the half, once again suffering a 2-1 defeat to Venezuela on that day.

It has been over five years since they were beaten by a CONCACAF opponent, suffering a 3-2 defeat in a June 2019 friendly against Mexico.

The Jamaicans continue to search for a first-ever victory at the Copa America and had their chances to break that slide on Saturday.

Heimir Hallgrimsson thought his side had gone in front early in the second half, only to have a Michail Antonio headed goal ruled out by VAR for offside.

An unstoppable volley from Gerardo Arteaga put the Mexicans in front and ultimately ended a three-match winning run for the Reggae Boyz.

In seven all-time Copa America affairs, the Jamaicans have not collected a single point, failing to score a single goal over that stretch.

So far in 2024, the Reggae Boyz have played seven matches and failed to concede once in the opening 45 minutes, but they have been outscored by a 6-2 margin in the second half over that span.

Wednesday will be the fifth time they meet Ecuador on the international stage, and Jamaica have lost four of those encounters, with their only positive result being a 0-0 draw in an August 2009 friendly played at Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

Ecuador will be without their team captain, Enner Valencia, for this match after VAR deemed his challenge to be worthy of a red card on matchday one.

Jeremy Sarmiento, who plays for newly promoted Premier League side Ipswich Town, netted his second goal for La Tricolor, though he and Kendry Paez are on a yellow card and in danger of missing their final group fixture with a caution in this match.

Jahmali Waite started between the sticks once again for Jamaica in place of injured captain Andre Blake, while Damion Lowe was back in the lineup following a minor knock sustained in World Cup qualifying.

Shamar Nicholson has scored three of their four strikes in World Cup qualification and can surpass Walter Boyd for sixth in all-time goals for this team.

Ecuador possible starting lineup:
Dominguez; Preciado, Torres, Pacho, Hincapie; Gruezo, M. Caicedo; Minda, Paez, Sarmiento; Rodriguez

Jamaica possible starting lineup:
Waite; Bernard, Latibeaudiere, Pinnock; Lembikisa, Decordova-Reid, Anderson, Leigh; Nicholson, Gray; Antonio



We say: Ecuador 1-0 Jamaica

Even with their goal ruled out, the Reggae Boys were quite wasteful in their opener and could have difficulty penetrating a well-organised Ecuadorian backline that have bounced back well from setbacks.
