        "Austria will face Serbia at the Ernst Happel Stadion on Tuesday in a friendly clash between the two teams.",
        "Austria thrashed Turkey 6-1 in their last match, with four different players getting on the scoresheet including Freiburg man Michael Gregoritsch who netted a brilliant hat-trick to take his goal tally for the nation to 15.",
        "Serbia picked up a narrow but largely deserved 1-0 win over Cyprus in their last outing, with Sergej Milinkovic-Savic netting the sole goal of the game just seven minutes after kick-off.",
        "Following Tuesday's game, Serbia will lock horns with Sweden in another friendly clash before facing England in their group opener midway through the month.",
        "Tuesday's game will mark the fifth meeting between Austria and Serbia. The hosts have won just one of their previous matchups while the visitors have won the other three.",
        "The two sides last faced off in a World Cup qualifying clash back in 2017 which the hosts won 3-2, with Hannover man Louis Schaub netting a stunning winner late in the game.",
        "Austria are on a brilliant five-game winning streak and have lost just once since November 2022. They have lost just one of their last seven games on home soil and will be looking forward to Tuesday's game.",
        "Serbia's latest result ended a three-game winless streak and they will aim to build on that this week. They have, however, lost three of their last four games on the road and could see defeat here as well."
