Players to Watch
Christoph Baumgartner (Austria)

He’s a technically proficient attacking midfielder who is capable of good defensive work with one of his best attributes being great pressing. He is a player who usually is at the end of the build-up phase and helps the team transition into the attack.

He is great at exploiting space between opposition defenders and usually positions himself in that area for the most part.

Dusan Vlahovic (Serbia)

Vlahovic is able to offer infinite solutions to his teams, either through long balls into space, where he can utilize his speed of movement, or through aerial balls, being able to hold the ball up and organize the attacking play for his side.

He masters many fundamentals when it comes to finishing the play. However, the individual fundamental that sets him apart from the rest is his ability to prioritize accuracy over power when it comes to shooting. He is great at finding pockets of spaces inside the box and always is a threat to the opposition.
