Argentina is advancing after a 1-1 win over Ecuador that ended with penalty kicks in Copa América on Thursday.

After a strong showing in the group stages, the defending Copa América champions had to deal with plenty of stress against Ecuador but ultimately punched a ticket to the semifinals, where it will face the winner of Canada vs. Venezuela.

After Argentina's victory, here's a look at the updated bracket, a recap of the match and the schedule moving forward:

Quarterfinal

Argentina def. Ecuador (1-1); Will face winner of Canada vs. Venezuela 
Canada vs. Venezuela; Winner faces Argentina
Columbia vs. Panama; Will face winner of Uruguay vs. Brazil
Uruguay vs. Brazil; Will face winner of Columbia vs. Panama

Argentina 1, Ecuador 1 (Argentina wins 4-2 on Penalties)

It was a defensive battle for most of the first half, but Argentina managed to find the back of the net in the 34th minute to take a 1-0 lead before the break. In a beautifully executed corner kick, Lisandro Martínez found himself with a clear shot at the goal and scored off a header.
