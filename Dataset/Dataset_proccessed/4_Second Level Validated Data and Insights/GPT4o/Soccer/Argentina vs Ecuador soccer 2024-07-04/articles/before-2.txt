For those who won't be watching the fireworks on the 4th of July, the Argentina vs. Ecuador quarterfinal match on the Copa America is likely to be just as good of a spectacle. If you're not paying for a streaming subscription to watch the Copa América, you can still catch the games for free using a VPN very similar to the way you can watch the EURO 2024 tournament for free.

How to watch Copa América matches

It's a great summer for soccer fans. The Copa América matches are scheduled for the evening, while the EURO 2024 matches happen in the morning and early afternoon. Similar to EURO 2024, the Copa América matches will be broadcast in English on Fox Sports and Fox Sports 1. Univision holds the Spanish-language rights, so you can watch the games on TUDN, Univision, and TelevisaUnivision (UniMás). For streaming options, the matches are available on FuboTV, Sling TV, TUDN, ViX, and DirecTV Stream.

DirecTV Stream is the only service offering all Copa América matches with a subscription of $79.99 per month. The Fubo Pro subscription, also $79.99 per month, gives you access to all relevant Fox channels and includes a seven-day free trial if you just want to catch a few games. Sling Blue is available for $40 per month, allowing streaming on three devices simultaneously. ViX Premium, starting at $4.99 per month with ads, also streams on three screens but keep in mind that the commentary will be in Spanish.

How to stream Argentina vs. Ecuador for free using a VPN

The quarter-final games start July 4th at 9:00 pm ET with Argentina vs. Ecuador. The World Cup champions Argentina managed to win all of their games from their group and finish first in Group A. Ecuador, on the other hand, finished second in Group B after losing to Venezuela and tying with Mexico. However, the Ecuadorians are still a strong team currently in fifth place in the World Cup qualifiers. Argentina should still be able to win, but it won't be as easy as their Group A games.

To watch the game for free, head over to Sportitallia, who are streaming all of the Copa America matches for free in Italy. Yes, you might not be physically in Italy, but that's where a VPN can come in clutch. Express VPN is our favorite VPN for bypassing geo-blocking restrictions. It will run you $12.95 per month, $9.99 per month for six months, or they also offer an annual plan for $8.32. You can see our comparison of ExpressVPN with NordVPN (another top VPN provider) here. Once you have ExpressVPN, open the app and go to Sportitallia on the same device (you'll probably need your browser to translate to English unless you speak Italian), and you'll be able to watch the Copa America matches for free.
