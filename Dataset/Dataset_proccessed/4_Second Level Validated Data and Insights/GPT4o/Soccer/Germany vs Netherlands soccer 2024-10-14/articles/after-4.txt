Initial reactions and observations
First Undav, now Leweling. Stuttgart forwards seem to be cooking for Germany nowadays. What is Sebastian Hoeneß feeding them? Well, we’ll find out soon enough — they visit Bayern Munich this Saturday.
This game was a masterclass by Julian Nagelsmann. Despite missing so many first team players, Germany hardly allowed the Netherlands a shot on goal. The final scoreline may read 1-0, but the performance was far more dominant than the lack of goals suggests.
Despite spending much of the game as a spectator, Oliver Baumann’s key save on Xavi’s long range effort in final ten minutes of the game edges him ahead of Alex Nübel’s performance on Friday. Seems like Germany have a new #1.

Four observations from Germany’s 1-0 win against the Netherlands at the Allianz Arena

Full time: Germany 1-0 Netherlands.

63’ — GOOOOOOOOOOOAL! Leweling makes it 1-0! Finally!

45’ — The second half is underway! Andrich has been subbed on for Wirtz.

Halftime: Germany 0-0 Netherlands.

5’ — NOOOOOO! Leweling’s goal ruled offside by VAR.

Kickoff: We’re underway!

One hour until kickoff: We have lineups! New faces in midfield with Angelo Stiller and Aleksandar Pavlović, while Deniz Undav has been replaced with Leweling. Is Nagelsmann cooking? Only time will tell.

So Germany are back at the Allianz Arena to face the Netherlands, with a long list of injuries in tow. The last time these two sides met, it ended 2-2 at the Amsterdam Arena with the Germans maybe feeling they could have won. Well, if that’s the case, then today’s a good time to prove it — at home in front of the Munich crowd, with 75,000 home fans cheering the team on.
