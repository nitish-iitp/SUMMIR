UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
GERMANY 1-0 NETHERLANDS - JAMIE LEWELING GOAL SENDS JULIAN NAGELSMANN'S SIDE CLEAR AT TOP OF NATIONS LEAGUE GROUP
BYBEN SOUTHBY

UPDATED 14/10/2024 AT 21:12 GMT

Germany took on Netherlands at Allianz Arena on Monday evening, and on a night when the old guard was honoured, a rising force in Jamie Leweling fired Julian Nagelsmann's Germany to victory in their UEFA Nations League clash. Before the game, the Allianz Arena stood to applaud Germany legends Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos, Ilkay Gundogan and Thomas Muller.

Jamie Leweling starred on his senior debut and bagged the only goal of the game as Germany overcame Netherlands 1-0 in the UEFA Nations League on Monday.
Stuttgart’s Leweling was cruelly denied a dream start to his international career when his strike inside two minutes was disallowed for offside by VAR. The winger thought he had fired the hosts ahead on his debut, but Serge Gnabry was ruled to be marginally offside in the build-up.

Germany controlled the opening stages of the game, with Brighton & Hove Albion goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen called into action a handful of times to keep the hosts at bay.

Netherlands weathered the early storm and then gained some control in the match which helped them survive until half-time with the contest well poised.
Not much separated the teams in the second half, until another moment of magic from Leweling gave Germany lift off. The 23-year-old picked up a loose ball from a corner and struck a sweet, first-time rocket into the roof of the net as he sealed his debut goal.
Netherlands looked to hit back and came close through late strikes from Xavi Simons and Donyell Malen, but 34-year-old debutant Oliver Baumann made two incredible saves to protect a special clean sheet.
Germany held on for the three points, which means they moved five points clear of Ronald Koeman’s side at the top of Group A3.
TALKING POINT - A MEMORABLE NIGHT FOR A NEW-LOOK GERMANY SIDE
Julian Nagelsmann made five changes to the team who overcame Bosnia and Herzegovina on Friday, with two debutants in Baumann and Leweling. Key figures such as Kai Havertz, Jamal Musiala and Marc-Andre Ter Stegen have been absent this international break, but it has not stopped them from collecting maximum points.
There are lots of factors that Nagelsmann and Germany fans alike can be excited about from Monday’s showing so much inexperience in the team. Leweling came into the side and thrived, Angelo Stiller and Aleksandar Pavlovic bossed the midfield and there was even more youth injection off the bench.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - JAMIE LEWELING (GERMANY)
The impressive Leweling was inches from bagging a stunning debut brace in what was a memorable evening for the Stuttgart winger. He did nothing wrong for his first-half strike, which was eventually ruled out, and he took the chance really well nonetheless.
He showed great attitude and ability to quickly shake off the disappointment of the dream start which had been snatched away from him and became a thorn in the visitors’ side throughout the game.
Leweling did eventually get his debut goal with another sublime strike, which was more than deserved.
MATCH RATINGS
Germany: Baumann 8, Kimmich 7, Rudiger 7, Schlotterbeck 8, Mittelstaedt 7, Stiller 7, Pavlovic 7, Leweling 9, Wirtz 6, Gnabry 6, Kleindienst 7
Subs: Gosens N/A, Anton N/A, Andrich 6, Burkardt N/A, Schade 6
Netherlands: Verbruggen 7, Hato 7, Van de Ven 6, De Vrij 6, Dumfries 6, Timber 6, Reijnders 6, Gravenberch 6, Gakpo 5, Brobbey 5, Simons 7
Subs: Frimpong 6, Geertruida 6, Wieffer 6, Malen 6, Zirkzee 6
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
2’ - GOAL!!! - GERMANY 1-0 NETHERLANDS (LEWELING): Jamie Leweling makes the dream start to his Germany debut and the hosts are off to a flyer! During a period of German pressure, the Netherlands can't get the ball clear and Serge Gnabry finds the Stuttgart man on the edge of the box, who sends a deflected effort beyond the goalkeeper.
6’ - NO GOAL - OFFSIDE - We're going to VAR for a possible offside. It looks as though Gnabry could have been slightly off in the build-up to the goal. And that is such a shame for the 23-year-old as the goal is ruled out, but rules are rules and it remains 0-0. Nonetheless, that will give Lewewling all the confidence in the world.
11’ - ANOTHER SAVE FROM VERBRUGGEN! This time Maximilian Mittelstaedt takes aim from a similar position to Kleindienst just moments ago, and he is also denied by the goalkeeper. Germany have made a really bright start.
27’ - LEWLING DENIED! The ball tees up perfectly for Leweling who is as free as a bird in the box and he pulls the trigger with a first-time strike from 10 yards out, but his effort is saved and put behind for a corner. Antonio Rudiger gets on the end of the corner, but his header is straight into the arms of Verbruggen.
40’ - ALMOST A CALAMITY FOR THE NETHERLANDS! They play out from a goal-kick and Gnabry pokes the ball away from Timber on the edge of the box and his touch rockets towards goal, but narrowly fizzes wide of the post. A big let-off for the visitors who have been a tad careless at the back so far.
64’ - GOAL!!! - GERMANY 1-0 NETHERLANDS (LEWELING): They won't rule this one out and Leweling gets his debut goal! A Germany corner falls to Leweling, who is poised on the edge of the box, and he thumps a rocket into the roof of the net.
77’ - OFF THE BAR! Simons rattles the bar with a terrific shot from 25 yards out! That's the closest the Netherlands have come all evening.
90’ - BAUMANN DENIES MALEN EMPHATICALLY! And that might have earned him a clean sheet on his debut! Malen finds room for a fierce strike on the edge of the box, but Baumann beats his effort away.
KEY STAT
The loss means Netherlands have suffered their first defeat in the league phase of the UEFA Nations League since September 2020.
