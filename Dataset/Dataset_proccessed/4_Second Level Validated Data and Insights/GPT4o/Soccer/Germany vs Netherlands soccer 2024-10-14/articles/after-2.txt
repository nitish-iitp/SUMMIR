Jamie Leweling fires Germany past the Netherlands and into UEFA Nations League quater-final stage

VfB Stuttgart's Jamie Leweling marked his senior international debut with the winning goal as Germany secured their place in the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League knockouts with victory over the Netherlands.

German football paid tribute to recently retired international quartet Manuel Neuer, Thomas Müller, Toni Kroos and İlkay Gündogan prior to kick-off. The party vibe continued as next-gen talent Leweling fired home inside five minutes, only for the VfB Stuttgart attacker's goal to be ruled out for an offside decision in the build-up against Bayern Munich counterpart Serge Gnabry. Julian Nagelsmann's charges continued to take the game to the visitors as Stuttgart left-back Maximilian Mittelstädt sent a low strike wide and Borussia Mönchengladbach's Tim Kleindienst missed with a header. Kleindienst went close again, before Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller tested Bart Verbruggen and Gnabry drilled just past the upright.

Germany had to withstand a wave of Netherlands pressure after the restart, though debutant goalkeeper Oliver Baumann remained untested. Gnabry fired off another warning shot as the hosts rediscovered their groove, before Leweling made it a case of second time lucky with an emphatic close-range finish following a Joshua Kimmich corner. RB Leipzig's Xavi took the bull by the horns in a bid to bring the Oranje back on level terms, but his thunderous strike was brilliantly tipped onto the crossbar by Baumann. The Hoffenheim stopper was at it again in added time, diving full stretch to thwart Borussia Dortmund's Donyell Malen as the four-time world champions - unbeaten and top of Group A3 - progressed to the Nations League quarter-final stage with two group games to spare.

Match stats

Germany have lifted four FIFA World Cups and three UEFA Euro titles, but the Nations League has so far eluded them.
Leweling, 23, scored twice across 17 appearances for Germany's U19s, 20s and 21s.
Nagelsmann has now won 10 of 17 games as Germany head coach (D4, L3).
Aged 34 years and 131 years, Baumann is the second oldest player to make his Germany debut in the post-war era.
Three Stuttgart players featured in consecutive Germany games for the first time since 2009.
Gnabry's 22 goals for Germany make him the highest-scoring current squad member. However, his last international goal came in March 2023.
