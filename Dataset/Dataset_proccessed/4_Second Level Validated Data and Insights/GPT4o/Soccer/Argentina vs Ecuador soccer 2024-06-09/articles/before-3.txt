La Albiceleste will begin their Copa America title defence after facing Ecuador and Guatemala in friendlies.

Argentina come into the upcoming 2024 Copa America as the defending champions, having won the competition in 2021 with a 1-0 victory over Brazil in the final. Winning this would make it three major honours in a row following their 2021 Copa America and 2022 FIFA World Cup titles.

La Albiceleste are currently on 15 Copa America titles, tied with Uruguay for the most in history. Triumph this summer would break the record. The defending champions are placed in Group A along with Peru, Chile and Canada. Lionel Scaloni is about to test his players against strong opponents for sure.

Ecuador may find it difficult to get on the scoresheet against a dominant Argentinian defence. They don’t have an impressive record against Argentina, but they have quality players on their squad to give them a tough challenge. They are placed in Group B along with Mexico, Venezuela and Jamaica. This will be an exciting clash for sure.

Players to Watch
Alejandro Garnacho (Argentina)

Alejandro Garnacho is always full of confidence, he likes to run at defenders and he’s afraid of no one. He takes on defenders on the edge of the box and beats them.

Garnacho is not only capable of creating chances but also clinical enough to score goals. He has a good work-ethic and likes to press high up the pitch. He can be one of the best players at the upcoming Copa America for Argentina.

Jeremy Sarmiento (Ecuador)

Jeremy Sarmiento possesses lightning pace and has the agility to shift inside quickly. He can move his body quickly and uses body feints and fast feet to wrong-foot the opposition.

Sarmiento is an intense presser when there is a realistic chance of winning the ball back. He thinks quickly and creates opportunities in seemingly impossible situations with bits of skill and link-up play. His presence on the pitch draws in defenders and in turn creates space for his teammates.
