Lithuania vs Cyprus Predictions
Can Lithuania Build on Defensive Stability to Outfox Cyprus?
Lithuania have kept clean sheets in three of their last four matches, showcasing strong defensive form.
Cyprus have failed to win a competitive away match since 2019, losing 14 out of their last 17 such encounters.
Both teams have struggled to score, with Cyprus averaging just 0.4 goals per game in their Euro 2024 qualification campaign.
Best Bet


Ollie Watkins to Score Anytime @ 6/5

Reasoning
Backing Ollie Watkins to score anytime is a strong bet. After ending his goal drought, Watkins, with his sharp movement and finishing, is poised to exploit Young Boys’ defensive weaknesses.
Odds subject to change

The upcoming UEFA Nations League clash between Lithuania and Cyprus offers an intriguing contest as both sides seek to avoid relegation in Group C2. Lithuania, under Edgaras Jankauskas, are riding a wave of steady form after a respectable Euro 2024 qualifying campaign, while Cyprus find themselves under increasing pressure following a dismal run in recent international competitions. With both sides keen to start their campaign positively, this match offers a pivotal moment for their fortunes in this group.

Given the current dynamics between these two teams, the prediction of under 2.5 goals is the most likely outcome. Cyprus have struggled immensely in front of goal, managing just three goals in their eight Euro 2024 qualifying matches. This stark lack of firepower has been evident in their gameplay, with their inability to consistently create clear chances. Their average of only 6 shots per game, with a meagre 2.8 on target, further highlights their struggles in the attacking third.

Defensively, Cyprus have been vulnerable, conceding an average of 3.5 goals per game. Yet, Lithuania, despite showing improvement, have also not been prolific scorers. In their last eight UEFA Nations League matches, Lithuania managed only four goals. Both teams have an expected goal output that remains modest, indicating that the game could turn into a low-scoring affair.

Furthermore, Lithuania’s improvement in defence has been a significant factor in their recent successes. They have kept three clean sheets in their last four matches, proving that they are becoming increasingly adept at managing games and neutralising threats. This defensive solidity, combined with Cyprus’ attacking woes, suggests that we are unlikely to see a high-scoring match.

Wolfgang Shotten from BettingTips4You.com agrees with this view, stating: “With both sides demonstrating a lack of attacking potency and Lithuania’s recent defensive stability, backing under 2.5 goals offers a solid chance for value. Neither team will want to take too many risks early in their campaign.”

Cyprus’ failure to score consistently, along with Lithuania’s cautious approach in recent fixtures, supports the rationale that this match is likely to be tightly contested, with few chances and even fewer goals. Both sides will be aware of their limitations and may prioritise avoiding defeat over chasing a win at all costs.

Correct Score Prediction: Lithuania 1-0 Cyprus

Eligibility & payment exclusions apply. T&Cs apply.

A 1-0 victory for Lithuania aligns closely with the logic behind the best bet of under 2.5 goals. Lithuania, though not prolific scorers, have found ways to edge tight contests, particularly at home. In their Euro 2024 qualification run, they managed narrow victories and showcased an ability to grind out results, especially against similarly matched opponents.

Cyprus, on the other hand, have been defensively frail but are unlikely to be overwhelmed by a Lithuanian attack that lacks consistent threat. Lithuania’s strength lies in their ability to keep things tight, and Cyprus, despite their poor form, will likely put up enough resistance to avoid a heavy defeat. However, given Cyprus’ long-standing issue of failing to win away from home, Lithuania’s superior recent form makes them favourites to sneak a victory.

The prediction of a 1-0 scoreline also mirrors Cyprus’ tendency to keep things relatively close in matches where they have been the underdogs. This, combined with Lithuania’s limited attacking output, points towards a low-scoring, closely fought contest where a solitary goal could well decide the game.
