Lithuania take on Cyprus at Dariaus Ir Gireno Stadium, where an exciting match should be on the cards this coming Friday. It is one of the matches in round one of the group phase of the UEFA Nations League this season. Lithuania took a hit when Cyprus handed them a 1-0 defeat in their latest encounter. The former did win the reverse match though, as they secured a triumph to their name by claiming a 2-1 win.

While Lithuania join this game on Friday as number 135 in the FIFA world ranking, visitors Cyprus are number 127.

Lithuania are most likely in for a tough match when welcoming Cyprus at Dariaus Ir Gireno Stadium. They are favoured by the bookmakers for the win, but it could get tight on Friday.

Lithuania scored six times in the last ten outings for an average of 0.6 goals a game. They conceded 17 and managed two clean sheets.

Cyprus travel to their next UEFA Nations League match, averaging a lowly 0.8 goals per game in their last ten matches. They scored a disappointing total of eight goals, while also conceding 17 goals. That amounts to an average of 1.7 per game, in which they kept their opponents from scoring four times.

Lithuania vs Cyprus Prediction
Lithuania Form

In the previous three matches, Lithuania lost 1-0 against Cyprus, beat Gibraltar by 0-1 and won 1-0 against Gibraltar. Lithuania claimed a middle-of-the-road three wins in their previous six internationals. They also drew zero and lost three, as they scored eight and conceded eight goals.

Cyprus Form

Cyprus collected one win from their last three matches, as Serbia won by 0-1. Moldova were too strong as well, winning 3-2, before Cyprus won 1-4 against San Marino. Cyprus won twice, while also recording one draw and three defeats in their last six internationals. The scoreline from these matches says nine goals conceded and nine scored.

Both Lithuania and Cyprus are having a hard time finding their way to the net. With the teams clashing in this round 1, we find a low scoring match is the natural pick.

Lithuania vs Cyprus Betting Tips

As the new UEFA Nations League campaign has recently started, we are still a bit in the dark, as to which striker will dominate the top scorer table for Lithuania and Cyprus this season. However, there might be some interesting prospects, when looking at the list of players who are in the best form at the moment.

Lithuania won one of their previous 10 matches across all tournaments at Dariaus Ir Gireno Stadium. They drew six and lost three as well, while Cyprus won two of their last 10 games away. They drew two and lost six. Goals are usually flowing for Lithuania on home soil these days, and at both ends of pitch. Both teams found the back of the net in six of their last 10 matches here. In contrast, both teams to score happened seven times for Cyprus in their last 10 league games away from home.

Over 2.5 goals came out one time in the last two encounters between these two teams. Lithuania managed an average of one goal, with Cyprus averaging one goal in these games. Both teams to score was a winning bet one time in this run of matches. Over 2.5 goals happened in three of Lithuania’s last ten matches across all tournaments.

Tips
Under 2.5
Lithuania find it tough these days to get a goal in, but Cyprus are equally lacklustre in front of goal currently, and going with under 2.5 goals in the betting market is the obvious choice.
