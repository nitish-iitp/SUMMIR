        "Lithuania have kept clean sheets in three of their last four matches, showcasing strong defensive form.",
        "Cyprus have failed to win a competitive away match since 2019, losing 14 out of their last 17 such encounters.",
        "Both teams have struggled to score, with Cyprus averaging just 0.4 goals per game in their Euro 2024 qualification campaign.",
        "Lithuania, under Edgaras Jankauskas, are riding a wave of steady form after a respectable Euro 2024 qualifying campaign.",
        "Cyprus find themselves under increasing pressure following a dismal run in recent international competitions.",
        "Given the current dynamics between these two teams, the prediction of under 2.5 goals is the most likely outcome.",
        "Cyprus have struggled immensely in front of goal, managing just three goals in their eight Euro 2024 qualifying matches.",
        "Cyprus\u2019 average of only 6 shots per game, with a meagre 2.8 on target, further highlights their struggles in the attacking third.",
        "Defensively, Cyprus have been vulnerable, conceding an average of 3.5 goals per game.",
        "Lithuania, despite showing improvement, have also not been prolific scorers, managing only four goals in their last eight UEFA Nations League matches.",
        "Lithuania\u2019s improvement in defence has been a significant factor in their recent successes, keeping three clean sheets in their last four matches.",
        "Wolfgang Shotten from BettingTips4You.com states: 'With both sides demonstrating a lack of attacking potency and Lithuania\u2019s recent defensive stability, backing under 2.5 goals offers a solid chance for value.'"
