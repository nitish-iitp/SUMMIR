Denmark reach knockouts, Serbia exit Euro 2024 after draw
ByReuters
Updated: Jun 26, 2024, 01:08 am

Denmark secured a place in the knockout phase of Euro 2024 with a nervy 0-0 draw in Munich on Tuesday against Serbia who head home after coming bottom of Group C.

The Danes -- knowing they only needed a draw to move into the next phase -- had more chances with Christian Eriksen pulling the strings from midfield, but were unable to turn that into a goal in their third draw of the tournament.

Denmark and Slovenia finished even on points, goal difference and goals scored. There were also six yellow cards apiece for the players for both teams. But Denmark had a better disciplinary record after Slovenia assistant coach Milivoje Novakovic received a yellow card in his side's opening match against Denmark.

Denmark will play hosts Germany in the round of 16 in Dortmund on Saturday.

"It's going to be great against Germany," Danish keeper Kasper Schmeichel said of the last-16 match in Dortmund on Saturday. "If we don't believe in our chances, we might as well go home."

Serbia defended stoutly for long periods, but could not provide opportunities for veteran striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, who appealed unsuccessfully for a penalty several times. They came fourth in the group with two points from two draws.

"We did not create enough chances to score the goal and that cost us," Mitrovic said. "It is a bitter feeling. It is the worst when you are so near and you can do it and at the end you fail. We are emotionally drained."

Both teams had goals disallowed, Denmark for a corner that went out of play and Serbia for offside.

The Danes enjoyed substantial possession in the opening period against a Serbia side needing a victory to have a chance of making the knock-out stage of the tournament.

Eriksen, who set a record for most appearances for Denmark with his 133rd international game, had a shot saved in the first half and was the main attacking threat throughout.

"They had to go forward to score while we already had a result at 0-0 and for that reason we were a bit passive at the end," Eriksen said. "It's surreal to stand here with 133 caps, it's completely insane. I never dreamed of that."

Serbia mainly soaked up the pressure and looked to counter but rarely threatened.

Serbia manager Dragan Stojkovic brought on Dusan Tadic and Luka Jovic to start the second half and his side almost broke the deadlock moments after the break. Jovic later put the ball in the net but the goal was disallowed for offside.

Denmark had 10 total attempts in the match compared to five for Serbia who finished with three strikers as they frantically searched for the goal that would keep them in the tournament.
