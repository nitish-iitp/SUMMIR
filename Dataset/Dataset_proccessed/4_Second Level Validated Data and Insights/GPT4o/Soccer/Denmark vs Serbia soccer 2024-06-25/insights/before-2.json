        "Denmark and Serbia meet to conclude their UEFA EURO 2024 Group C campaigns on Tuesday 25 June.",
        "The permutations are complicated, and who finishes third in Group C will also depend on what happens when England meet Slovenia, but for Denmark and Serbia the top-line figures are pretty simple: they both need to win.",
        "Kasper Hjulmand's side have drawn both of their games so far 1-1; Dragan Stojkovi\u0107's team have just the one point, their 1-0 loss to England followed by a 1-1 draw with Slovenia, earned by a late Luka Jovi\u0107 goal.",
        "The countries' previous ten meetings have ended with five wins apiece, but the momentum is very much with the Danes, who have won their four most recent encounters.",
        "Denmark can also call on greater recent EURO experience, but as Slovenia discovered last time out, Serbia do not give up easily.",
        "Possible line-ups for Denmark: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; M\u00e6hle, Hjulmand, Eriksen, H\u00f8jbjerg, Bah; H\u00f8jlund, Wind.",
        "Possible line-ups for Serbia: Rajkovi\u0107; Veljkovi\u0107, Milenkovi\u0107, Pavlovi\u0107; Birman\u010devi\u0107, Ili\u0107, Gudelj, Mladenovi\u0107; Tadi\u0107, Samard\u017ei\u0107; Mitrovi\u0107.",
        "Denmark's form (all competitions, most recent first): DDWWWD.",
        "Serbia's form (all competitions, most recent first): DLWLWL.",
        "Expert prediction from Sture Sand\u00f8, Denmark reporter: The Denmark machine went like clockwork against England, and the only thing missing was the three points. Kasper Hjulmand will do everything he can to engineer a repeat of that performance against Serbia, where a victory will seal Denmark a spot in the round of 16. A draw could turn out to be enough, but don't expect them to be counting on that. The message from coach Hjulmand and his players is clear: they are in Munich to win!",
        "Expert prediction from Aleksandra Stojkovi\u0107, Serbia reporter: It is 'to be or not to be' time for the Eagles, who kept their fate in their own hands with a last-gasp equaliser against Slovenia. The pressure is high but this generation of players, led by coach Stojkovi\u0107, showed that they can prevail under pressure, and are used to being underdogs. The starting XI remains uncertain, with Serbia arguably yet to find the perfect combination. This game would be a great time to do so."
