We said: Lesotho 1-1 Gabon
Without Aubameyang leading the line, Gabon could struggle to finish many of their chances in front of goal, and it would not be surprising if the visitors failed to score more than once. If Lesotho are as defensively resilient as they were in their previous encounter with Gabon, it is plausible that they can earn their second point of their qualifying campaign. Read more.
Data Analysis

Our analysis of all available data, including recent performances and player stats up until an hour before kickoff, suggested the most likely outcome of this match was a Gabon win with a probability of 42.63%. A draw had a probability of 29.4% and a win for Lesotho had a probability of 27.98%.

The most likely scoreline for a Gabon win was 0-1 with a probability of 14.47%. The next most likely scorelines for that outcome were 0-2 (8.7%) and 1-2 (7.96%). The likeliest drawn scoreline was 1-1 (13.24%), while for a Lesotho win it was 1-0 (11.01%). The actual scoreline of 0-2 was predicted with an 8.7% likelihood.
