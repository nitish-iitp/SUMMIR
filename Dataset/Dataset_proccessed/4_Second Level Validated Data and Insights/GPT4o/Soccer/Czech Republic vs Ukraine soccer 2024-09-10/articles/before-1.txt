Can Czech Republic and Ukraine Salvage Their Nations League Campaign?
Czech Republic’s Leaky Defence
In their last eight matches under Ivan Hasek, the Czech Republic have both scored and conceded, highlighting their attacking potential but also their fragility at the back. They conceded four goals in their most recent match against Georgia, leaving them with the second-worst defensive record in their group.
Ukraine’s Possession Dominance
Ukraine controlled 59% of the ball in their previous match and completed 421 passes with an 87% accuracy rate. Their dominance in possession, especially in the opposition half, is a key factor that could help them unlock the Czech defence in this upcoming contest.
Czech Republic’s Struggle for Clean Sheets
The Czech Republic have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last eight matches, conceding 15 goals during that time. This porous defence is a major concern, especially given Ukraine’s ability to create scoring opportunities despite missing key attacking players.

As the UEFA Nations League continues, an intriguing matchup awaits at the Fortuna Arena in Prague, where the Czech Republic take on Ukraine in a crucial Group B clash. Both teams are under pressure to deliver a much-needed result, having faced early setbacks in the competition. The hosts were humbled 4-1 by Georgia, while Ukraine also faltered, letting a lead slip to lose 2-1 against Albania. Neither side can afford to drop more points if they aim to climb the group standings and stave off relegation to the third tier.

This match presents a compelling storyline, not only because of the similar fortunes of both teams but also due to their respective recent struggles. Ivan Hasek’s Czech squad has been winless in their last four competitive matches, while Ukraine, under Sergiy Rebrov, are also grappling with inconsistency. Both nations are recovering from disappointing exits in the Euro 2024 group stages, and the pressure to redeem themselves is palpable. Fans can anticipate a tense and hard-fought battle between two teams eager to prove they still belong at this level.

With all these factors in play, it’s difficult to predict a clear winner, but there is enough evidence to suggest where the key moments of the match might unfold. In particular, we expect this game to offer plenty of goal-scoring opportunities, which informs our best bet for the clash.

Given the attacking tendencies and defensive vulnerabilities of both teams, the best bet for this fixture is for both teams to score. Recent form and statistics indicate that neither the Czech Republic nor Ukraine are adept at keeping clean sheets, making it highly likely that both sides will find the net in this encounter.

The Czech Republic have shown a penchant for high-scoring games, particularly under Ivan Hasek’s management. Despite their poor defensive performance, they have managed to score in each of their last eight matches, including their most recent defeat to Georgia, where Lukas Kalvach’s late strike denied their opponents a clean sheet.

In total, the Czechs are averaging 10 shots per game, five of which are on target, reflecting their ability to create chances, even in defeat. This attacking capability, however, is counterbalanced by a defence that has struggled mightily, conceding four goals in their first Nations League match and showing a tendency to make errors leading to dangerous situations.

Ukraine, too, have had a similar defensive record, having conceded twice in their opener against Albania, but they’ve also demonstrated their attacking prowess. Yukhym Konoplya scored early in their recent fixture, and the team managed a total of 16 shots, with three on target. While they’ve missed some big chances—two in the match against Albania—their ability to carve out opportunities cannot be overlooked. Although key players like Artem Dovbyk and Mykhaylo Mudryk are missing, Ukraine’s forward line, featuring the likes of Viktor Tsygankov and Roman Yaremchuk, is still capable of troubling the Czech defence.

Given these attacking strengths and defensive frailties, the likelihood of both teams scoring is high. As BettingTips4You.com expert Wolfgang Shotten summarises: “Neither side has been able to keep clean sheets in recent fixtures, and with their defensive vulnerabilities, there’s every chance that both teams will score in this match. It’s hard to see either side shutting out the other, given the form we’ve seen.”

Additionally, historical trends back this up, as both teams scored the last time these two sides met. The match is likely to follow a similar pattern, with goals at both ends being the most reliable outcome. Given their respective forms and statistical tendencies, this makes for the strongest bet in this matchup.

Correct Score Prediction: Czech Republic 1-2 Ukraine

Eligibility & payment exclusions apply. T&Cs apply.

With both teams likely to score, the correct score prediction for this match is 1-2 in favour of Ukraine. While neither team has impressed defensively, Ukraine seem to have the edge in terms of attacking threat, even without some of their key players. The Czech Republic’s defence, which has already conceded four goals in one match, could be further exposed by Ukraine’s quick, counter-attacking play.

Ukraine’s ability to control possession—59% in their last match—and their overall accuracy in passing in the opposition half (nearly 82%) make them well-suited to exploit gaps in the Czech backline. While the Czech Republic should manage to score, much like they did late against Georgia, their defensive lapses make it unlikely that they will be able to prevent Ukraine from finding the net more than once.

Ukraine’s greater composure in attack, as shown by their 16 shots per game and their ability to create big chances, should ultimately see them emerge victorious, albeit in a closely contested affair. A 2-1 victory for Ukraine mirrors their recent form, where they’ve often scored but failed to keep a clean sheet, and this scenario looks likely to play out again in Prague.
