Burkina Faso will head into their Matchday 2 encounter against Malawi as clear favorites, buoyed by a solid performance in their opening match where they earned a hard-fought draw against one of AFCON favorites Senegal. The 1-1 result against the former African champions not only boosted their confidence but also solidified Burkina Faso’s position as a serious contender in the qualification race.

Now turning their focus to Malawi, a team that lost 2-3 to Burundi in their first qualifier, Burkina Faso are keen to maintain momentum. With the Burkinabé team unbeaten in their last four meetings with Malawi—having won once and drawn three times—they hold a psychological advantage going into the match.

Burkina Faso’s defensive discipline and attacking threat were on full display against Senegal, and coach Brama Traore will likely deploy a similar strategy to exploit Malawi’s weaknesses. Players like Dango Ouattara and Aziz Ki will look to lead the charge as Burkina Faso aim to secure their first victory of the campaign.

On the other hand, Malawi faces an uphill battle. After their opening loss to Burundi, the Flames will need to regroup quickly to avoid falling further behind in the qualification race. Despite their underdog status, Malawi has proven capable of surprises in the past, and they will be desperate to secure a positive result against Burkina Faso.

As the two sides prepare for the showdown, Burkina Faso enters as the clear favorites. However, with qualification on the line and everything to play for, both teams will be looking to leave their mark on Matchday 2.
