UPEAT—The Flames train
SHARE

Malawi National Football Team, the Flames, have a make or break encounter when they face Burkina Faso’s Stallions in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers at a neutral venue, Stade du 26 Mars, in Bamako, Mali, tonight.

The match is scheduled to kick off at 9pm (21:00 hours) local time. Both teams are aiming for their first victory in the qualifiers after dropping points in their respective opening matches.

The Flames started the 2025 Afcon qualifiers with a surprise 3-2 defeat to Burundi at Bingu National Stadium whereas the Stallions held Senegal to a 1-1 draw in Daka, Senegal.

UPEAT—Mabedi

Stalked by a battered reputation and internal squabbles, Flames coach Patrick Mabedi leads his troops into what some believe is mission impossible.

Surely, the odds are stacked against the Flames in this fixture, having failed to beat the Stallions in all competitions. In the last six matches, the Stallions have won four matches and drawn twice against Malawi since 2000.

Malawi and Burkina Faso drew 1-1 in 2000 before the Stallions beat the Flames 4-2 in 2001.

The two sides were also in the same group during the 2021 Afcon qualifiers but the Flames lost 3-1 away before a goal-less stalemate at Kamuzu Stadium.

Before 2021, they were also in the same group in the 2009 Fifa World Cup qualifiers but the Flames lost by 1-0 margins in both fixtures.

Despite having a good record against the Flames in all competitions, the Stallions are winless in the last nine matches.

Malawi and Burkina Faso are separated by 59 places on Fifa rankings, with the Stallions on 67 whereas the Flames are 126 in the world.

Mabedi admitted Monday that the Flames had no choice but to get a positive result against the Stallions tonight.

“So far, the team is looking good. We are ready now and we are looking forward to the game. We need to put a smile back on the faces of the fans and we will do our best to make them happy,” Mabedi said.

The former Kaizer Chiefs mentor and player said everything is possible in football.

“We are facing a very good team. They have very good players and fast attackers. We just need to make sure we are disciplined and also utilise our chances. Any team is beatable,” Mabedi said.

“The best way of defending is attacking. We need to go out there and attack the team. And be disciplined when we lose the ball to manage transition both attacking and defending,’’ Mabedi added.

Mabedi is likely to make changes to the side that started against Burundi.

Captain John Banda will likely be thrown into the fray after he was an unused substitute against Burundi.

Lawrence Chaziya

Goalkeeper George Chikooka will keep his place but Mabedi will likely also reshuffle the back four. Lawrence Chaziya could be given a chance.

On the other hand, the Stallions boast of a lot of quality in their squad.

Bayer Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba, Benfica defender Issa Kabore, strikers Dango Ouattara of English Premiership side Bournemouth, Bertrand Traore of Ajax, Trova Boni, Sancha Banse and Hassane Bande are available for the match.

Meanwhile, sports analyst Roy Abramo M’dechi has said Malawi must beat Burkina Faso to remain in contention in Group L.

“Losing or getting just a point in this fixture is not enough and if that happens we must forget about qualifying for Afcon finals,” M’dechi said.
