Will Burkina Faso’s Home Advantage Be Enough to Overcome Malawi’s Resilience?
Burkina Faso’s Defensive Struggles: Burkina Faso have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last eight matches across all competitions. Despite their solid individual defenders, such as Tapsoba and Kabore, their collective defensive performances have been far from watertight, conceding crucial goals that have cost them wins.
Malawi’s Attacking Threat: Malawi have averaged two goals per game in AFCON qualifying so far, showcasing their ability to create and convert chances. Despite their loss to Burundi, they fired 22 shots, with 7 on target, proving they can trouble defences with sustained pressure.
Head-to-Head Dominance: Burkina Faso have won four of their last six encounters with Malawi, demonstrating a psychological edge. Their ability to come out on top in these past meetings provides them with added confidence going into this fixture, especially given Malawi’s defensive frailties in recent games.

Reasoning
Burkina Faso to win and both teams to score is a strong bet, given Burkina Faso's attacking quality and defensive vulnerabilities. Malawi’s recent scoring form further supports this prediction for an open contest.

The upcoming clash between Burkina Faso and Malawi in the AFCON qualifiers promises to be an intriguing contest, as both teams are in search of crucial points following contrasting results in their opening matches. Burkina Faso will host Malawi in Bamako, Mali, due to a lack of a suitable venue in their home country, which adds an extra layer of uncertainty to this already tightly poised fixture. Both sides will be desperate to bounce back from less-than-ideal starts to their qualification campaigns, with Burkina Faso securing a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Senegal, while Malawi were left ruing a 3-2 defeat at home to Burundi. Despite these mixed results, there’s a lot at stake for both teams as they aim to build momentum.

Burkina Faso, though winless in their last eight outings, can take confidence from their solid defensive structure and competitive performance against Senegal. On the other hand, Malawi will be looking to shake off their defensive frailties, especially after conceding three goals at home in a match where they dominated large spells. As both teams prepare for Sunday’s showdown, it’s clear that neither side can afford to slip up if they hope to secure a place in next year’s Africa Cup of Nations.

The best bet for this encounter is Burkina Faso to win and both teams to score. The reasoning for this prediction is multi-faceted and stems from both sides’ recent form and attacking potential. Burkina Faso have shown themselves capable of scoring, evidenced by their dramatic equaliser in Senegal, yet their defensive vulnerabilities are evident, having failed to keep a clean sheet in their last eight games. Malawi, despite their defensive issues, have demonstrated an ability to find the back of the net, as seen in their 3-2 loss to Burundi, where they netted twice.

Burkina Faso will be buoyed by their strong squad featuring experienced European-based players like Bayer Leverkusen’s Edmond Tapsoba and Bournemouth’s Dango Ouattara. These players bring a level of composure and quality that should see Burkina Faso control the tempo of the game and create chances. However, as they’ve conceded in nearly every recent match, it’s unlikely that their defence will hold firm against a Malawi side eager to respond after their opening defeat. Malawi’s attack, spearheaded by Chawanangwa Kaonga and Lanjesi Nkhoma, has enough firepower to trouble Burkina Faso’s backline. In their defeat to Burundi, they proved that they can find the net, even when under pressure.

Burkina Faso’s key weakness lies in their defensive lapses, which were evident in their inability to keep Senegal at bay. Despite their strong attacking options, they’ve struggled to maintain clean sheets, and this presents a significant factor when predicting that both teams will score. Additionally, Malawi’s own defensive shortcomings, having conceded three against Burundi, make it hard to envision them keeping Burkina Faso’s forwards quiet.

“Burkina Faso’s quality in attack should see them through, but their leaky defence means both sides are likely to find the net,” says BettingTips4You.com expert Emmanuel Nwankwo. “Given their performances in recent matches, backing a Burkina Faso win with both teams to score offers good value.”

Malawi’s ability to capitalise on Burkina Faso’s defensive issues, combined with the latter’s attacking potency, creates a scenario where we expect goals from both sides. However, given Burkina Faso’s superior quality and depth, they should be able to edge this encounter.

Correct Score Prediction: Burkina Faso 2-1 Malawi

In keeping with the rationale behind the best bet, the correct score prediction for this match is 2-1 in favour of Burkina Faso. Both teams’ recent form suggests that goals are likely, but Burkina Faso’s slightly better overall quality, especially with players like Ouattara and Bertrand Traore in their ranks, should see them narrowly outscore their opponents. Malawi’s defensive frailties, coupled with their occasional lapses in concentration, will likely leave them exposed to Burkina Faso’s attacking threats.

While Malawi have shown they can be dangerous going forward, their defence remains suspect, having conceded three goals in their last outing. A 2-1 scoreline reflects Burkina Faso’s ability to exploit these defensive gaps, while also acknowledging that Malawi possess the attacking potential to get on the scoresheet. Burkina Faso, with their well-organised midfield and attacking structure, should have enough to secure the win, albeit not without a scare from their Malawian opponents.
