Two teams searching for their first points at the 2023 Asian Cup will do battle on Friday as Vietnam and Indonesia square off in Group D action at Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium in Doha.

In their opening fixture the Golden Star Warriors could not maintain their first-half advantage, losing 4-2 to Japan, while the Indonesians suffered a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Iraq.

Early into their opening fixture on Sunday, Vietnam appeared poised to cause a massive upset, leading the top-ranked side in Asia minutes before the interval.

Unfortunately, Philippe Troussier's men could not hold out before the half-time whistle, conceding twice before the half was done, a devastating blow which seemed to impact their morale in the final 45 minutes.

Despite the setback, their veteran French manager has given them hope to make a run at the title this season and possibly make it to the next World Cup, with Vietnam currently in line to make the third stage of 2026 qualifying, sitting second in Group F with three points from two matches.

Although they are pointless after one match, Vietnam will look back at the 2019 group stage and know that nothing is over just yet, with the Golden Star Warriors losing their opening two group fixtures in 2019 but still advancing into the knockout stage.

Vietnam enter this contest on a three-match losing run in all competitions, scoring as many goals on Sunday as they had in their two previous matches combined.

Only one of their last seven goals scored in this competition occurred in the final 45 minutes, while they have conceded a second-half strike in three successive competitive fixtures.

A promising 45 minutes by Indonesia proved to be all for nothing as they conceded the winning goal deep into first-half stoppage time, while they could not muster much offence in half number two.

What was most promising about their play early on in that encounter was their ability to stay poised under pressure before succumbing late in the half.

For the first time in their Asian Cup history, Tim Garuda were beaten in their opening fixture, while they have lost their second match at this tournament in each of their previous four group stage campaigns.

Shin Tae-yong's men have been rather sloppy defensively over the past couple of months, conceding multiple goals in three of their previous four matches in all competitions.

The Indonesians have conceded in all but one of their Asian Cup fixtures historically (0-0 draw versus Kuwait in 2000), allowing multiple strikes in two of their previous three matches in this competition.

They are winless in their last six meetings with Vietnam, failing to score in their previous four matches played against them, with their last victory versus the Golden Star Warriors coming in December 2016 (2-1).

Several youngsters featured for the Vietnamese on matchday one, with Nguyen Van Truong and Nguyen Filip each collecting their second caps for the senior side, while Le Pham Thanh Long made just his third international appearance.

Captain Do Hung Dung is one cap away from 40, Vu Van Thanh needs five more to reach 50 and Nguyen Van Toan is two shy of 60.

Nguyen Dinh Bac scored five minutes after Japan drew first blood on Sunday, while Pham Tuan Hai gave them a surprise lead beyond the half-hour mark, the second and fifth international goals for each player, respectively.

There were concerns about the health of Indonesian captain Asnawi Mangkualam, who suffered a muscle injury days before their opening match, though he did feature against Iraq before being replaced by Witan Sulaeman at the half.

Pratama Arhan made his 40th appearance in their opener, Justin Hubner collected just his fourth cap with the national team and Yakob Sayuri is now just two caps shy of 20.

Marselino Ferdinan briefly put his side on level terms against Iraq with his third international goal, before Ernardo Ari conceded the winner deep into first-half stoppage time, while giving up another one in the second half.

Vietnam possible starting lineup:
Filip; Binh, B. Anh, Tai; T. Anh, Son, N. Ahn, Khang; Dung, Bac; Hai

Indonesia possible starting lineup:
Ari; Mangkualam, Ridho, Baggott, Arhan; Klok; Sayuri, Salaeman, Hubner, Ferdinan; Struick



We say: Vietnam 2-1 Indonesia

These sides are relatively equal in terms of quality, but Troussier's major tournament experience could give the Vietnamese a slight edge in this match.
