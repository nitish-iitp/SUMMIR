Coach Troussier laments 'small mistake' in Indonesia defeat
By Lam Thoa   January 19, 2024 | 04:17 pm PT
Vietnam's national coach Philippe Troussier expressed disappointment about Vietnam's early elimination in the Asian Cup, coming from a player's mistake that earned Indonesia the winning penalty shot.

"I'm disappointed by our defeat," Troussier said after the match in Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium in Doha Friday night.

"It was a high-quality match where the result was decided by a penalty, from a small mistake inside the box. A small mistake has affected the whole team."

Troussier was referring to the situation in the 40th minute when midfielder Nguyen Thanh Binh pulled the shirt of Rafael Struick inside the box and the referee pointed at the spot. Asanwi Mangkualam made no mistake and coverted the penalty to get Indonesia ahead.

The French coach said he respected the referee's decision and had a talk with Binh during the break time to boost his morale.

"He played much better in the second half, blocking the opponents effectively. I did not scold him."

Vietnam did not have their best form in the first half. Their midfield could not keep possession like they did in the game with Japan, where they lost 2-4. The team missed their star Nguyen Dinh Bac in this game due to injury, and his replacement Nguyen Van Tung did not meet expectations.

Indonesia squad, with players that have better physique, often won in one on one situations and committed many fouls.

They were pressing Vietnam right from the start looking for an early goal. They got their first shot on target in the first minute, but goalkeeper Filip Nguyen saved it.

In the second half, Vietnam made two substitutions and had several chances to score, but their shots still lacked accuracy against very solid defense.

Troussier said their opponents on Friday night were a strong team, who were "different from the Indonesia at AFF Cup or SEA Games."

"It was clearly a difficult game. Indonesia have a quality squad with naturalized players. We lost but I am proud that we had fought strongly until the last second."

The game ended with a 0-1 defeat for Vietnam and this also eliminated them from Asian Cup group stage early. They will play the last match with Iraq on Jan. 24.

Troussier said Vietnam will continue to fight for three points in their last game. "We cannot give up."

Indeed, the AFC 2023 has been full of surprises. The outcome of this match between Vietnam and Indonesia represents another major upset and surprise in this competition (the other two being Iraqs unexpected victory over Japan and the draw between South Korea and Jordan).

Having watched the full record of this match, I can confidently state that this is a far more humiliating defeat than the match between Japan and Iraq. The reasons are as follow:
