Garry Rodrigues scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner as the Cape Verde Islands beat four-time champions Ghana 2-1 in Group B to continue Sunday's sequence of surprise results at the Africa Cup of Nations finals.

It was the third match of the day in Abidjan and followed Nigeria's draw with Equatorial Guinea in Group A while Egypt needed a last-gasp penalty to draw with Mozambique in the opening Group B match at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Stadium.

Cape Verde went ahead in the 17th minute when Dutch-born Rodrigues's shot was parried by Ghana goalkeeper Richard Ofori, falling for Jamiro Monteiro to tuck away from close range.

Ghana equalised 11 minutes into the second half with Alexander Djiku heading home from Jordan Ayew's corner, stooping to get his head to it as the Cape Verde defence failed to clear an innocuous delivery
