Reggae Boyz head coach Steve McClaren said the pressure was on his team to deliver the goods in Honduras following the disappointing 0-0 stalemate against Cuba in Kingston in the CONCACAF Nations League competition.

Jamaica defeated Honduras 2-1 on Tuesday night to top Group B with four points from two games. It was the Englishman’s first victory in Jamaican colours.

“We had to win. We couldn’t afford to lose the game as that would have left us in a bad situation. It was imperative we come here with a good performance and get the win,” said McClaren during a post-match press briefing in Honduras.

“After the Cuba result in which we played so well, regretfully we couldn’t score any goals that added the pressure for us coming here,” he noted.

An own goal by Denil Maldonado in the 49th minute and a 76th penalty by Michail Antonio propelled Jamaica to their sixth straight win over the Hondurans. David Ruiz scored for Honduras in the 50th minute.

“It was a tough game and we knew it would be and playing away from home would always be difficult with the fans and the energy,” McClaren pointed out.

“But credit to our players. I thought they were magnificent. The first 20 minutes I thought we were controlling the game,” he added. “We were very brave in possession and we build from the back and I was so impressed with that to play football like that.”

Jamaica made two changes to the starting team on the right side, bringing in Greg Leigh for Dexter Lembikisa at right back and replacing Jamal Lowe with Norman Campbell at outside right.

That was a masterstroke by McClaren as Campbell, a former Jamaica College standout, worked hard throughout and assisted in the first goal following a brilliant run that the Honduran defender deflected in. Then substitute Kaheim Dixon who replaced Campbell assisted in Jamaica’s second goal in the 76th minute with a beautiful through ball to Antonio who was fouled resulting in the penalty.

“We were always dangerous in transition and we had three opportunities in the first half and the second half was very good,” said McClaren.

“They were very good. I am proud of the players. They were hard to beat. Great team spirit, unbelievable team spirit. We had good players coming off the bench to finish the game. It was really, really tough and we came out on top,” he reiterated.

“We have three to four weeks and another tough game,” McClaren said smiling.
