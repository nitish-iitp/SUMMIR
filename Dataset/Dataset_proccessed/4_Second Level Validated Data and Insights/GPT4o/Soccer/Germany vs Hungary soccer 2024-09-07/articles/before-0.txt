GERMANY PREVIEW: NO REBOOT YET

The German national team have had to deal with a couple of key retirements since they were knocked out in the quarter-finals of UEFA EURO 2024, which they hosted, by Spain with a gut-wrenching late Mikel Merino goal deep into extra-time.

Die Mannschaft will begin the new international cycle without goalkeeper Manuel Neuer or captain Ilkay Gundogan as they have both retired from the national team as well as Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller.

HUNGARY PREVIEW: FRUSTRATING EUROS

Under the management of Italian coach Marco Rossi, Hungary went into UEFA EURO 2024 with hopes of living up to the ‘dark horse’ tag. They were frustratingly beaten 3-1 by Switzerland in what was quite an even opening encounter.

After that they were beaten 2-0 by Germany before a last-gasp win against Scotland but three points was enough for the Magyars to edge their way through to the Round of 16 even as one of the four best third placed teams.

GERMANY TEAM NEWS: NEXT FOR NAGELSMANN

It is evolution rather than revolution for the German national team, despite the four big retirements since the summer. Marc-Andre ter Stegen will become the new number one goalkeeper with Joshua Kimmich taking the captaincy.

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Tah, Schlotterbeck, Mittelstadt; Pavlovic, Andrich; Wirtz, Havertz, Musiala; Fullkrug

HUNGARY TEAM NEWS: RELATIONISM OF ROSSI

Tactical relationism was a tedious phrase of UEFA EURO 2024 with Rossi and Hungary trying to implement a formation-less system at the tournament and that ‘formation-less’ system, which is a 3-4-2-1, is expected to be deployed again.

PREDICTED XI (3-4-2-1): Gulacsi; Balogh, Orban, Dardai; Bolla, A. Nagy, Schafer, Kerkez; Szoboszlai, Sallai; Varga

GERMANY VS HUNGARY PREDICTION

Germany are beginning something of a new era and it will be interesting to see how much the handbrake remains off for Julian Nagelsmann’s Germans. Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz remain the stars of a tricky attack. Hungary didn’t find their best in the summer but can hurt teams and did have chances in their game against the Germans. Germany should well win but it should be quite an entertaining match for the neutral.
