A new era begins for Germany on Saturday evening, as they welcome familiar foes Hungary to Dusseldorf for their opening UEFA Nations League fixture.

Several stars stepped down following the hosts' exit from Euro 2024, so a new-look side will start their first League A Group 3 game.

Germany's dream of lifting the European Championship trophy on home soil ended in the quarter-finals of this summer's tournament, as Julian Nagelsmann's side were eliminated by eventual winners Spain in Stuttgart.

Having gone into the finals after a tumultuous year that saw Hansi Flick replaced by another ex-Bayern Munich boss, Die Nationalelf were not necessarily expected to go further, so Nagelsmann remains safe in the hotseat.

He will now usher in a new era for the German national team, as senior players such as Manuel Neuer, Ilkay Gundogan, Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos have all departed the international stage after several years of duty.

Some fresh faces are therefore involved in Nagelsmann's first Nations League campaign, as he builds towards qualifying for the 2026 World Cup and then trying to regain the global title.

The 37-year-old has won seven of his first 13 matches in charge - losing three - with one of those victories coming against this week's opponents at the Euros, where the hosts won 2-0 en route to topping Group A.

Germany also met Hungary in the last Nations League, but they fared less well across two League A matches in the 2022-23 season, losing at home and picking up a point on the road.

Hungary still trail in the overall head-to-head, with 12 wins to the Germans' 14 - plus a dozen draws - with their most famous defeat coming in the 1954 World Cup final, when all-time great Ferenc Puskas just missed out on glory in a controversial contest.

More recently, Marco Rossi's current squad only missed out on a place in the knockout phase of Euro 2024 due to goal difference, as they took three points from as many Group A games.

At least beating Scotland saw the Magyars end an eight-match winless streak at the European Championship, though they have still won only two of their last 18 at major tournaments when playing other European nations.

Heading into the Euros, Hungary had lost just once in 16 games, helping them push Italy all the way for a place in the last Nations League finals, before coming up one point short in a group also featuring Germany and England.

Appointed in 2018, Rossi remains in charge for the challenge ahead, as his side try to beat the Netherlands and Bosnia-Herzegovina to a top-two finish in Group 3, which would be good enough to reach the new quarter-final stage.

With several long-serving players no longer available, Julian Nagelsmann has appointed Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich as Germany captain, suggesting the versatile 29-year-old is set to continue at right-back for his country.

Kimmich will skipper the side for a ninth time on Saturday, when Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller hopes to make his international debut; though Aleksandar Pavlovic, Robert Andrich and Pascal Gross are perhaps favourites to fill the midfield void left by Toni Kroos and Ilkay Gundogan.

Elsewhere, Antonio Rudiger has been rested, while Leroy Sane is short of match fitness and also misses out on selection.

Young stars Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala should start in the final third, supporting either Kai Havertz or fellow Premier League forward Niclas Fullkrug up front.

Meanwhile, Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai captains the visitors, while two of his former teammates in Leipzig - goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi and centre-back Willi Orban - are also expected to start.

Another Germany-based player, Rolland Sallai of Freiburg, is the top-scoring Bundesliga player in Hungary's squad, with 20 goals to date.

Attila Fiola, Laszlo Kleinheisler, Adam Lang, Callum Styles and Atilla Szalai have all been dropped from the squad that took part at Euro 2024, but Barnabas Varga is back from the serious head injury he sustained against Scotland.


Germany possible starting lineup:
Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Schlotterbeck, Tah, Mittelstadt; Gross, Pavlovic; Musiala, Wirtz, Fuhrich; Havertz

Hungary possible starting lineup:
Gulacsi; Botka, Orban, M. Dardai; Bolla, A. Nagy, Schafer, Kerkez; Sallai, Szoboszlai; Varga



We say: Germany 2-1 Hungary

Germany are yet to win the Nations League - or even progress beyond the group phase - in three previous attempts, but they should be among the favourites to prevail next June.

With an abundance of attacking talent available, Julian Nagelsmann's men are set to beat a stubborn Hungary side again on Saturday night.
