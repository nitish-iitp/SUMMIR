A new era begins for Die Mannschaft.

Germany are going through a big transition period after several of the senior players announced their retirements from international football. It includes some of the big names in world football. Julian Nagelsmann has already begun the new era announcing Joshua Kimmich as the new captain. 

Die Mannschaft will now mostly focus on the younger core with the likes of Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala leading the new generation. The UEFA Nations League is the perfect way to begin the new chapter at their home after a mixed performance in the UEFA Euro 2024 on home soil. 

Hungary have built a reputation of being one of the stubborn sides who on their day can take on any opponent. Marco Rossi’s side will be aiming to bounce back after enduring a disappointing run in the recently concluded Euro 2024. There they failed to progress from the group stage. 

The team led by Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai, have all the tools to create an upset in League A Group 3 after being drawn against Germany, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Netherlands. Their first match is an away trip to Germany followed by a home clash against Bosnia and Herzegovina on match day two.

Saturday, 7 September 2024 at 7:45 PM UK

Sunday, 8 September 2024 at 12:15 AM IST

Location: Merkur Spiel-Arena

Players to Watch
Kai Havertz (⁠Germany)

Kai Havertz has impressed everyone with his performances in the number nine role despite not being a traditional nine. He has played the role effectively for club and country after netting 14 goals last season and also providing another seven assists. Havertz has given a different dimension to the team who have benefitted from his excellent movement and positional play. He will be aiming to play another important role here after opening the new season in excellent form. 

Dominik Szoboszlai (Hungary)

The Liverpool playmaker has emerged as an important member of this national team. This has mainly been the case after being given the extra role of captaincy which has eventually brought out the best of him. This move has gone well as he now plays with more responsibility and maturity.

Szoboszlai has thrived in this role with his playmaking abilities and long spectacular goals a highlight of his improved form. He will be vital in unlocking the German defence with his exceptional vision and passing ability in this match.
