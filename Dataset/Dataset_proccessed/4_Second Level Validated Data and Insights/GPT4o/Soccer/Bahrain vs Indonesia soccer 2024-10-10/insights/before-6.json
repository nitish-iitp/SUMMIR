        "Bahrain and Indonesia square off on Thursday in what is a crucial fixture in their efforts to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.",
        "Sitting in third and fourth respectively in Group B in the third round of AFC qualifying, one of these nations can take a step closer to guaranteeing a minimum of a fourth-round spot with victory in Riffa.",
        "With the World Cup in 2026 being extended to 48 teams, nations such as Bahrain and Indonesia have been left to dream putting themselves in contention for a spot on the biggest stage.",
        "Both of these teams have been presented with a far tougher task than they may have been with Japan, Saudi Arabia and Australia in their group.",
        "Bahrain causing shockwaves on the Gold Coast with a 1-0 victory in Australia has shaken this six-nation group up, Australia now without success in two games.",
        "Bahrain subsequently lost 5-0 at home to Japan in their following contest, yet sitting in third spot after two games with home matches against Indonesia and China to come in their next three outings is arguably a dream scenario.",
        "Should Dragan Talajic's side collect at least three points from that double-header, they will remain very much in the hunt for a top-four spot, which would guarantee progression to the next round.",
        "In their last nine matches in all competitions, Bahrain have suffered just the two defeats, both of which have come at the hands of Japan.",
        "Opponents Indonesia are also in excellent form having only experienced one defeat in their most recent encounters in all competitions.",
        "That came to Iraq in June, yet they have since responded with draws against the likes Saudi Arabia and Australia in this group.",
        "Keeping a clean sheet in the latter would have made their rivals in the group take note that Shin Tae-yong's side are capable of extending their participation in this qualifying campaign."
