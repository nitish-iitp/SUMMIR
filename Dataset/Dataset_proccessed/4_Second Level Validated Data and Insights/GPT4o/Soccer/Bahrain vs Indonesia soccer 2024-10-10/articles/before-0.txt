JAKARTA - The Bahrain vs Indonesia Party is not just the third match of Group C of the Third Round of the 2026 World Cup Qualification in the Asian Zone.

The Indonesian national team looked at the duel with various missions. The first target clearly wants to get three points.

Ranked, Bahrain is far above Indonesia. The hosts are in 76th position, while the Garuda Squad is in the 129th.

However, that ranking did not make Shin Tae-yong's troops inferior and afraid. Bahrain is an opponent who has a big chance to beat.

Meeting records prove that the two are not far apart. Bahrain won three times, while Indonesia won twice. The remaining two matches ended in a series of a total of seven meetings in all competitions since 1980 according to 11v11.

This means that Bahrain cannot be complacent, let alone superior in front of the Indonesian national team. The Garuda squad is no longer the same team.

Since being handled by Shin Tae-yong, the Indonesian national team has been taken into account at the Asian level. They can penetrate the first knockout phase in history in the 2023 Asian Cup.

Not to mention the latest achievement in the 2026 World Cup Qualification, which in the first two matches Indonesia detained the series of Saudi Arabia's giant teams (1-1) and Australia (0-0).

Bahrain needs to be wary. The Indonesian national team is ready to improve the meeting record.

In addition to the mission of winning three points, the Garuda Squad also wants to return its face in front of Bahrain.

As is known, the last meeting in the 2014 World Cup Qualification, the Indonesian national team lost very badly, 0-10, on February 29, 2012.

However, Bahrain needs to know that at that time the Garuda Squad was not the truth. PSSI's dualism in 2012 was the culprit of the Indonesian national team, which could not be strengthened by the best players. The uncertainty of the federation at that time also affected the players' mentality.

Currently, the Indonesian national team is clearly much different. In terms of strength, it has been mentioned previously.

Naturalized players are almost all lines and the depth of the squad is capable of being ammunition that threatens anyone's opponent.

PSSI, which is no longer in conflict, has made the Red and White Team able to focus on preparing themselves. This situation made the Indonesian chance for revenge wide open.

Moreover, Shin Tae-yong's big mission is to make history in qualifying for the World Cup for the first time.

The top two teams in Group C of the Third Round of 2026 World Cup Qualifiers will qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup.

The Indonesian national team is now in fourth place with a capital of two points from two matches. There are still eight more matches, one of which is against Bahrain which can be maximized.

The fight against Bahrain will be held at the Bahrain National Stadium, Riffa, on Thursday, October 10, 2024, at 23.00 WIB.
