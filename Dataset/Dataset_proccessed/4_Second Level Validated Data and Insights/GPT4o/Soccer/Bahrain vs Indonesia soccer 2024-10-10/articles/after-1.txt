The Indonesian national team again won a draw after holding 2-2 Bahrain in the third match of Group C of the third round of the 2026 World Cup Qualification for the Asian zone at Bahrain National Stadium, Riffa, Thursday (10/10/2024).

Bahrain’s goals came through Mohamed Marhoon in the 15th minute and 90+8′.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian national team scored through Ragnar Oratmangoen in the 45+2nd minute and Rafael Struick 74′.

This match went viral on social media because it was full of controversy. Indonesia almost won at Bahrain headquarters. Having been 2-1 ahead until eight minutes of injury time, the Indonesian national team’s victory was shattered after Bahrain scored an equalizer through Mohamed Marhoon in the ninth minute.

Referee Ahmed Al Kaf’s controversial decision at the end of the match ruined the Indonesian national team‘s victory. The referee from Oman gave six minutes of extra time in the second half, but instead, the match was allowed to end for nine minutes. Bahrain was able to equalize in the 90+9th minute.

Based on Footy Rankings records, Indonesia received an additional 4.39 points in the FIFA ranking. However, the Indonesian national team’s position in the FIFA ranking has not changed, remaining in 129th position in the world.

On the other hand, Bahrain experienced a significant decline in FIFA’s ranking, namely two positions. Dragan Talajic’s team dropped to 78th in the FIFA world ranking after losing 4.39 points.

Indonesian national team coach Shin Tae-yong expressed disappointment about referee Ahmed Al Kaf’s leadership during the match against Bahrain in the 2026 World Cup Qualification for the Asian Zone.

“Both Bahrain and Indonesia did their best until the final whistle by the referee,” Shin Tae-yong said in the post-match press conference, as quoted by Bolasport.

“Still, I will mention the embarrassing thing about the referee’s decision. If the AFC wants to develop, the referee’s decision must also be improved,” said the South Korean coach.

Shin Tae-yong also called the referee’s decision in this match biased, which caused the Indonesian national team players to express anger at the end of the match.

The Indonesian national team players also strongly protested the referee’s decision at the end of the match. The Indonesian national team manager, Sumardji, even received a red card from the referee for protesting too loudly.

Profile of Ahmed Al Kaf, Indonesia vs Bahrain Referee

Before the match Indonesia vs Bahrain, Al Kaf’s appointment was questioned, considering that his home country, Oman, is in the same football body as Bahrain, namely the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF).

Another concern about Al Kaf is his hobby of issuing yellow cards. According to records, Al Kaf gives an average of five yellow cards per match! He has led 114 matches with a total of 343 yellow cards and ten red cards.

Indeed, this concern was proven when Al Kaf issued three yellow cards in the Bahrain vs. Indonesia match, one for Bahrain and two for Indonesia. Not only that, but Al Kaf also fouled Indonesia 27 times, one of which led to a free kick that gave Bahrain the lead in the 15th minute.
