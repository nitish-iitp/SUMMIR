Preview: Germany vs. Netherlands - prediction, team news, lineups

Two European heavyweights will lock horns at Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt on Tuesday night, when Euro 2024 hosts Germany welcome the Netherlands for an important international friendly.

Die Mannschaft are in buoyant mood following the comfortable success over France on Saturday night, whilst Oranje will be hoping to build on a handsome victory over Scotland a day earlier.

Making his first start since returning from a three-year international hiatus, Real Madrid superstar Toni Kroos provided the assist for Florian Wirtz's 20-yard stunner to put Germany ahead after just seven seconds in Lyon on Saturday night - it is fair to say that things could not have started much better for the visitors.

The industry of Los Blancos legend Kroos and Bayer Leverkusen's Robert Andrich allowed Die Mannschaft's emerging talents to wreak havoc against Didier Deschamps's troops, with both 20-year-old Wirtz and Jamal Musiala influential as Kai Havertz scored in the second period to double his side's advantage.

Following back-to-back defeats to Turkey and Austria during the November international break, a memorable night in France was exactly what the doctor ordered for Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann, who is reluctant to discuss his future in the managerial hotseat as links to Borussia Dortmund intensify.

Saturday night witnessed a clean sheet for Die Mannschaft in any fixture for the first time since the 2-0 beating of South American side Peru a year ago, with a centre-back pairing of Antonio Rudiger and Jonathan Tah staking their claim to be the duo that starts against Scotland on June 14 when the Euros commence.

Germany's home record during a raft of friendly fixtures in 2023 was extremely worrying for a side who will be expected to seriously challenge for the European crown on home soil in the summer - Turkey, Colombia, Japan and Belgium have all managed to earn wins on the road versus Die Mannschaft over the past 12 months.

Aiming to build towards winning their second European Championship title in the summer, the Netherlands commenced their 2024 scheduled with a convincing 4-0 victory over Steve Clarke's Scotland in Amsterdam on Friday night, when an exciting midfielder netted his first-ever goal for his country.

Playing only his seventh match for Oranje, AC Milan playmaker Tijjani Reijnders left Angus Gunn helpless in the visitors' net with a long-range strike to give the Netherlands a first-half lead, and goals from Georginio Wijnaldum, Wout Weghorst and Donyell Malen sealed a comfortable night for the hosts during the second period.

Following a disappointing end to their Nations League campaign - in which they lost to both Croatia and Italy in June to end up finishing fourth overall - Ronald Koeman's side are beginning to hit their stride as the Euros approach, winning four-straight matches and keeping a quartet of clean sheets along the way.

Three of those shutouts were achieved with Brighton & Hove Albion's Bart Verbruggen in between the sticks, but it was Brentford's Mark Flekken in goal for Friday's thrashing of the Scots, making only his seventh start for Oranje since receiving his maiden call-up in September 2021.

The Netherlands are unbeaten during their last two visits to Germany, including a much-needed 4-2 victory in Euro 2020 qualifying back in September 2019, when goals from Frenkie De Jong, Borussia Dortmund's Malen and Al Ettifaq star Wijnaldum ensured a productive night in Hamburg.

With Euro 2024 fast approaching, Germany boss Nagelsmann is looking to build connections between his preferred starters, meaning that we could see a similar XI to the one which lined up against France on Saturday.

A change could be in order up front, though, with Die Mannschaft potentially looking to sound out the different attributes that Niclas Fullkrug can bring to the table compared to Arsenal man Havertz.

After making his debut in Lyon, left-back Maximilian Mittelstadt is in contention for back-to-back starts, but RB Leipzig's David Raum is an alternative option on that side of defence.

Die Mannschaft are without the services of Manuel Neuer during this month's international break, meaning that Marc-Andre ter Stegen will continue in goal.

Operating at right-back on Friday, Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong started in the Netherlands defence as the Scots came to town, but he is set to be replaced by a natural option in that position in the form of Denzel Dumfries.

Mats Wieffer endured some difficult moments in the midfield battle against Clarke's charges last time out, with the 24-year-old potentially making way for PSV Eindhoven's Joey Veerman on Tuesday night.

Weghorst and Malen are banging on the door for starting berths after they both netted off the bench in Amsterdam, but Memphis Depay is still one of the first names on the teamsheet for Koeman.


Germany possible starting lineup:
Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Rudiger, Tah, Mittelstadt; Andrich, Kroos, Musiala, Gundogan, Wirtz; Fullkrug

Netherlands possible starting lineup:
Flekken; Dumfries, Geertruida, Van Dijk, Ake; Veerman, Wijnaldum, Reijnders; Simons, Gakpo, Depay



We say: Germany 2-1 Netherlands

Germany's victory over France on the weekend certainly raised a few eyebrows across the continent as the Euros draw nearer, and a sold-out Frankfurt crowd will expect another exciting display on Tuesday.

The Netherlands are in sensational form - scoring 12 and conceding none over the last four matches - but we feel that a potentially-resurgent Die Mannschaft side will earn the victory in this encounter.
