        "Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann is expected to name a similar XI to the one which dismantled France as the Netherlands visit Frankfurt on Tuesday.",
        "A centre-back pairing of Antonio Rudiger and Jonathan Tah assisted Marc-Andre ter Stegen to a rare shutout versus Didier Deschamps's men in Lyon, with both defenders set to retain their spots in the side.",
        "There is a three-horse race emerging for the berth at the focal point of Germany's attack - Arsenal's Kai Havertz staked his claim on the position with a goal last time out, but Nagelsmann may want to see what Niclas Fullkrug and Denis Undav can offer.",
        "With Toni Kroos and Bayer Leverkusen's Robert Andrich dominating the midfield battle versus France, Joshua Kimmich looks set to remain in a right-back role as the Netherlands come to town, although RB Leipzig's Benjamin Henrichs is another option should Die Mannschaft opt to go slightly experimental in Frankfurt.",
        "Positions that certainly do not require tinkering ahead of Euro 2024 in June are the left and right flanks, where Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala have the potential to fire Germany into the latter stages of a home tournament, whilst Barcelona's Ilkay Gundogan provides the stability further infield.",
        "After making his debut for Die Mannschaft at the age of 27, Maximilian Mittelstadt is fighting for back-to-back starts during this month's international window, with the Stuttgart defender currently keeping David Raum out for the XI.",
        "Once a staple of successful Germany outfits, Thomas Muller settled for a spot amongst the substitutes against France as the 34-year-old approaches what looks set to be his final major tournament for his country, and the Bayern Munich enforcer is likely to start on the bench once again."
