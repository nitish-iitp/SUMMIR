        "Friday has a chance to be the best day of the tournament, and it starts with a dream quarterfinal matchup between Spain and Germany -- the two most impressive teams thus far in Euro 2024.",
        "Spain have won all four of their matches in the tournament, scoring nine goals and giving up one. Germany have won three of four -- drawing the other -- and have totaled 10 goals while conceding only twice (one of which was an own goal).",
        "Spain's defense has conceded just once, but they have likely benefitted from facing weaker attacks. In Spain's one game against a good attacking side, they permitted 2.1 xG to Croatia.",
        "Germany's defense has kept two clean sheets -- versus Hungary in group play and against Denmark in the Round of 16 -- but they were lucky to do so each time, allowing exactly 1.2 xG in both games.",
        "Spain's attack should create chances regardless of who they're facing. They have put out their first-choice starting 11 in three matches this tournament, amassing 2.0, 2.0, and 3.3 expected goals (xG).",
        "Germany's attack has mustered at least 1.4 xG in each match, including 2.6 last time out against a solid Denmark team."
