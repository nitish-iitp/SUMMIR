        "Julian Nagelsmann, Germany coach, stated: 'It\u2019s not a final, it\u2019s a quarterfinal. We want to be one of the teams in the semifinal. Spain want to be champions as well, so it\u2019ll be a tough game. Both teams are good in possession, have good counter-pressing qualities and can put their opponents under pressure.'",
        "Luis de la Fuente, Spain coach, stated: 'It\u2019s going to be an equal game. It could have been the Euro final and I think it\u2019ll be an even game on a footballing level. Germany always start matches strongly, so obviously we\u2019ll try and counter that. We\u2019ll try and take the initiative and go all-out from the first minute.'"
