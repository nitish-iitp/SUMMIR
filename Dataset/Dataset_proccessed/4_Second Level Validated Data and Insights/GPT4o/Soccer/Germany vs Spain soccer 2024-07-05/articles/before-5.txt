Team and Injury News

Spain: The Spanish team did not have any issues with injuries entering into Euro 2024 except for Gavi and Isco, who suffered ACL and leg fractures, respectively. But, they faced a few hiccups initially, with Aymeric Laporte missing the first game against Croatia and Nacho missing the game against Italy. Substitute Ayoze Perez was out from the squad against Albania but returned to the bench in the previous game. However, everyone seems to have recovered from the knockouts and played with their full-strength team in the round of 16. La Roja is expected to line up the same team that played against Georgia.

Germany: The 1996 champions faced some crucial setbacks arriving into the tournament with midfielder Aleksandar Pavlović ruled out just a few days ahead because of a recurring Tonsilitis. Earlier, Julian Nagelsmann’s team lost Serge Gnabry due to a hamstring injury in Bayern Munich’s Champions League game against Real Madrid. Nevertheless, the team doesn’t have any issues currently. However, reports suggest that Florian Wirtz may come back into the eleven for Leroy Sane and Jonathan Tah will return after a suspension last game.

Expected Lineups

Spain Predicted XI: Unai Simón; Dani Carvajal, Robin Le Normand, Aymeric Laporte, Marc Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Fabian Ruiz; Lamine Yamal, Alvaro Morata, Nico Williams.

Germany Predicted XI: Manuel Neuer; Joshua Kimmich, Antonio Rüdiger, Jonathan Tah, David Raum; Robert Andrich, Toni Kroos; Florian Wirtz, Ilkay Gündogan, Jamal Musiala; Kai Havertz.

Head-to-head and Predictions

Both teams locked horns 26 times before this. Although there is hardly anything to separate the two teams, Germany has an extra win with 9 compared to Spain’s 8, and the rest of the games ended equally. Predicting the game, Spain is the slight favorite despite playing at the opponent’s home and could progress to the semifinal.

Prediction: Spain 3-2 Germany
