How France could line up against Luxembourg
By Ben Knapton, Senior Reporter

France head coach Didier Deschamps will not have any of his three Real Madrid players at his disposal for Wednesday's international friendly against Luxembourg at the Stade Saint-Symphorien.

Ferland Mendy and Eduardo Camavinga were both starters in Los Blancos' 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final, and the pair should be given more time to recuperate.

Meanwhile, Aurelien Tchouameni missed the Wembley victory due to a foot injury, which plunged his Euro 2024 hopes into doubt, but he has affirmed that he will be OK to take part in the Championships.

However, Tchouameni has no chance of making the cut here and may also miss France's second friendly of the month with Canada, potentially offering the recalled N'Golo Kante the chance for a start on Wednesday.

Adrien Rabiot and Warren Zaire-Emery - who has also been called up for the 2024 Olympics - are more likely starters in Deschamps's midfield, though, and the pair should line up behind Antoine Griezmann, whose record-breaking streak of 84 successive France matches ended in March due to injury.

Ousmane Dembele, Olivier Giroud and Real Madrid's shiny new toy Kylian Mbappe should form the attacking quartet alongside Griezmann in what may be France's first-choice offensive line for the Euros, although Marcus Thuram will have something to say about that.

Deschamps is still spoiled for choice at the back despite the absences of Mendy and fellow left-back Lucas Hernandez, who is out with an ACL injury, but Theo Hernandez has nailed down that position anyway.

Jules Kounde is seemingly the first pick on the right flank, while Benjamin Pavard and Dayot Upamecano may hold off Premier League counterparts William Saliba and Ibrahima Konate to form Mike Maignan's central shield.

France possible starting lineup:
Maignan; Kounde, Pavard, Upamecano, T. Hernandez; Zaire-Emery, Rabiot; Dembele, Griezmann, Mbappe; Giroud
