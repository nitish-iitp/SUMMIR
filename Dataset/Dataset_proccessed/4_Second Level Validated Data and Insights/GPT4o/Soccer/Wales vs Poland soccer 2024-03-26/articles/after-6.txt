Devastation for Wales! Daniel James' missed penalty proves costly as Poland secure Euro 2024 qualification

Wales vs Poland

Wales will not be going to Euro 2024 after Dan James missed the crucial penalty in the shootout to hand Poland victory in Tuesday's play-off.

TELL ME MORE

Wales created the best of the chances on the night, as Ben Davies headed narrowly over the bar in the first half before having a goal disallowed shortly before the break. Wojciech Szczesny, meanwhile, did well to claw away a looping header from Kieffer Moore early in the second half.

Poland, on the other hand, struggled to carve out many opportunities for star striker Robert Lewandowski, and Arsenal defender Jakub Kiwior missed their best chance when he sliced over from close-range after a ball was drilled across the box.

In the end, neither side could find a breakthrough over the course of 120 minutes, and after Chris Mepham was sent off for a second yellow card in the final seconds of extra-time, it came down to spot-kicks. The first nine takers all found the net before James saw his effort pushed away by Szczesny to silence the boisterous home crowd in Cardiff.

THE MVP

Szczesny is a veteran of 80 caps for his country, but this must go down as one of his finest nights on the international scene. His save to deny Moore was spectacular, while he made some key interventions to stop crosses from reaching onrushing Wales players on the edge of the six-yard box.

His performance, though, will mostly be remembered for his save from James, and the Juventus shot-stopper will rightly be the toast of Poland this evening.

THE BIG LOSER

You have to feel sorry for James, who has never let his country down and is enjoying a fine season for Leeds United as they eye promotion back to the Premier League. In the end, though, it was his weak spot-kick that will live in infamy within Welsh football for days, weeks and potentially even years to come, and that will be hard for him to take.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Poland will now join France, the Netherlands and Austria in Group D at Euro 2024, with their opening game against the Dutch on June 16. Wales, meanwhile, are back in action against Slovakia on June 9, but they now have no summer tournament to look forward to.
