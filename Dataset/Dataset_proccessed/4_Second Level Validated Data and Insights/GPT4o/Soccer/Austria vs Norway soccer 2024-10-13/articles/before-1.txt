Austria’s attacking form: Austria have scored six goals in their first three Nations League matches, averaging two goals per game, and will rely on their potent attack to break down Norway.
Norway’s defensive frailty away from home: Norway have conceded three goals in three of their last six away matches, highlighting their vulnerability on the road.
Haaland’s goal-scoring machine: Erling Haaland has averaged 0.94 goals per game for Norway, making him the primary threat to Austria’s defence, who will need to be at their best to contain him.
Our Tips
Draw


15/8 - odds when tipped
\t


BET HERE


Reasoning
A draw is likely as Empoli’s poor home form clashes with Torino’s goal-scoring struggles. Both sides lack attacking consistency, and strong defensive setups suggest a low-scoring stalemate.

Draw 1-1


5/1 - odds when tipped
\t


BET HERE


Reasoning
A 1-1 draw appears most likely, with Empoli’s momentum offset by Torino’s defensive solidity. Both sides’ scoring struggles and injury issues suggest a tight, low-scoring contest.

This Sunday, football fans will be treated to a fascinating UEFA Nations League encounter as Austria prepare to host Norway in Linz. It’s a battle for supremacy in League B Group 3, with both teams vying for promotion to the prestigious League A. Austria, currently second, will be looking to capitalise on home advantage and leapfrog group leaders Norway, who remain unbeaten in the competition. Norway, fresh off an impressive victory that saw Erling Haaland become their all-time top goalscorer, have been flying high but will face a real challenge against an Austrian side that is finding form at just the right moment. With so much at stake, the atmosphere promises to be electric as both sides push for a crucial win.

Despite Norway’s unbeaten start, Austria’s recent demolition of Kazakhstan, where they smashed four goals past their opponents, has bolstered their confidence. However, the Austrians have struggled against Norway in recent meetings, winning just once in their last four encounters. The pressure is on for Austria to deliver, but will home advantage and their high-energy style under Ralf Rangnick be enough to topple Norway?

Best Bet: Austria to Win and Both Teams to Score

For those looking to place a wager, Austria to win with both teams finding the net looks like the best value bet for this match. This prediction is built on Austria’s recent attacking prowess and Norway’s shaky away form, especially defensively. Austria have shown they can score in bunches, as evidenced by their 4-0 victory over Kazakhstan. They have averaged two goals per game in the Nations League this season, and their high possession stats (61.7%) demonstrate their ability to control the tempo and keep the pressure on their opponents. Additionally, Austria’s midfield creativity, spearheaded by Marcel Sabitzer and Christoph Baumgartner, ensures they will likely break through the Norwegian defence.

However, it’s equally worth noting that Norway have been far from watertight at the back when playing on the road. They have conceded three goals in three of their last six away matches. Haaland, of course, remains a constant goal threat. With an incredible record of 0.94 goals per game for his country, it’s hard to imagine Norway leaving the pitch without a goal. And while Austria’s defence has been decent, the absence of key players like David Alaba, coupled with their tendency to concede (averaging one goal allowed per game), means they will likely struggle to keep a clean sheet against Norway’s star-studded attack, particularly Haaland and Alexander Sørloth.

What makes this bet even more appealing is Norway’s inconsistency on the road. Though they have kept two clean sheets in their last three games, their overall form away from home has been mixed. Austria’s relentless high-pressing game, a hallmark of Rangnick’s tactics, is designed to overwhelm opponents who are shaky in possession. Without their influential captain Martin Ødegaard, Norway might struggle to cope with Austria’s physical and fast-paced style, leaving them exposed at the back while relying on Haaland’s brilliance to bail them out.

BettingTips4You.com expert Wolfgang Shotten summarises it perfectly: “Austria’s high-energy approach combined with Norway’s fragility away from home should see the hosts win, but with someone like Haaland on the pitch, it’s never safe to bet against Norway finding the net.” Austria to win and both teams to score looks like the ideal play for those backing goals and a home victory.

Correct Score Prediction: Austria 3-1 Norway

In terms of a correct score prediction, 3-1 in favour of Austria feels like a logical outcome. Austria have been scoring freely at home, with four goals in their last match and a total of six goals from three Nations League games. Sabitzer has been particularly lethal, with two goals already in this campaign, and the presence of Arnautovic could provide the cutting edge needed to exploit Norway’s defensive frailties.

Norway, despite their firepower, have struggled defensively, especially away from home. They conceded three goals in their recent defeat to Denmark and have shown a tendency to allow their opponents to find the back of the net. Austria, playing at home and with their pressing game likely forcing mistakes from a weakened Norwegian midfield missing Ødegaard, could take advantage. At the same time, Haaland’s inevitable contribution means Austria’s defence will need to be on their toes, but a single goal from Norway seems the most likely scenario given Austria’s solid overall form at the back.
