Khama Billiat marked his return to South African soil on a successful note after guiding Zimbabwe to a tense 1-0 win over Namibia in their latest 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Orlando Stadium on Thursday.

The former Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs star was summoned to the penalty spot moments after the half-hour mark with his converted shot being enough for Zimbabwe to bag maximum points in Gauteng.

Zimbabwe held most of the ball during the first 10 minutes of the match but played the majority of the game inside their own half.

However, it was Namibia who came closest to scoring after Kennedy Amutenya hit the woodwork with a close-range header from a corner.

The Brave Warriors continued to dominate the possession count midway through the first half but battled to make the most of their chance in the final third of the pitch.

After Amutenya struck the upright early on, Marshal Munetsi missed another headed attempt following a corner.

Zimbabwe’s pressure eventually paid off in the 34th minute after Amutenya committed a foul in the 18-yard-area, which prompted the referee to point to the penalty spot.

In stepping up to his mark, Billiat made no mistake by converting his effort with an accurate right-footed shot.

Namibia came agonisingly close to scoring moments before the break after Prins Tjiueza hit the woodwork from a left-footed strike from the middle of the goal area.

Nevertheless, Zimbabwe headed into the break with their 1-0 lead intact.

Colin Benjamin’s troops looked lively after the restart as seen with attempts by Peter Shalulile and Romeo Kasume, who actively searched to level matters for their nation.

The Warriors remained on the front foot after an hour played at the Orlando Stadium and continued to pose a threat in the air.

However, Zimbabwe proved to be a tough nut to track amid Namibia’s increase in activity on the ball.

Namibia piled on the pressure during the closing stages of the match, with Zimbabwe struggling to get out of their half as the 80th minute approached.

Nevertheless, Zimbabwe held on to secure all three points in matchday three of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.
