Zimbabwe go top of Group J after win over Namibia
 October 10, 2024

Zimbabwe has taken the lead in Group J  of the African Cup of Nations qualifiers for Morocco next year on five points after securing a 1-0 victory over Namibia.

The match took place at the Orlando Stadium on Thursday afternoon. Zimbabwe scored the winning goal through Khama Billiat in the 34th minute from the penalty spot.

This victory places Namibia at the bottom of the group after losing their first two matches against Cameroon and Kenya.

Zimbabwe currently holds the top position in Group J until the outcome of the match between Kenya and Cameroon, which will take place at the Japoma Stadium in Douala on Friday.

Both Zimbabwe and Namibia will face each other again in a few days in South Africa on neutral ground.

This upcoming match is expected to be closely contested due to the rivalry between the two nations. Namibia must win at least to revive their qualification hopes.
