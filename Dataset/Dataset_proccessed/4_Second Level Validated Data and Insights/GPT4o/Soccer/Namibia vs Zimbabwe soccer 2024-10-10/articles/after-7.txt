Warriors head coach Michael Nees has secured his first three points since his appointment as Zimbabwe battled to a 1-0 victory over Namibia in the 2025 AFCON Qualifiers, Group J, on matchday three at Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.

 

Khama Billiat’s penalty in the 34th minute ensured the Warriors reached five points, placing them at the top of the group following two draws against Kenya and Cameroon, who face each other tomorrow.

Udinese’s Jordan Zemura won the penalty after a Namibian defender bundled into him as they both leapt to contest a long ball in the box. Billiat stepped up to take the penalty and scored, albeit with a poor strike by his standards. The keeper guessed correctly, but the ball fortuitously bounced past him.

The match kicked off with Zimbabwe conceding a corner in the 3rd minute from a free kick, which was headed over the bar after a Namibian player outjumped the Zimbabwean defence.

The first clear chance of the game fell to Terrence Dzvukamanja, who skillfully bypassed two Brave Warriors defenders but failed to beat the keeper, who anticipated the play and rushed off his line to block the shot.

Namibia earned their second corner in the 15th minute, signaling their intent for victory, but it was headed clear by Marshal Munetsi.

Mamelodi Sundowns’ Peter Shalulile was lively in the opening minutes, exploiting Zimbabwe’s left side. However, there was an injury scare when Munetsi suffered a crude tackle in midfield, requiring medical attention.

With Zimbabwe somewhat weakened in midfield, Namibia came close to equalizing in the 42nd minute, but their effort struck the upright.

The Warriors appeared disjointed, with the midfield playing too far apart, a situation exacerbated by Munetsi’s injury as he struggled towards the end of the first half. Captain Marvellous Nakamba, returning to the squad after a long injury layoff, formed a midfield trio with Andy Rinomhota and Munetsi.

Namibia resumed after the break in search of an equalizer and had the first shot on target in the 50th minute, a header from Shalulile that went straight into the arms of Washington Arubi.

Three minutes later, Zimbabwe’s Daniel Musendami struck the upright following a beautiful pass from Munetsi.

In the 69th minute, Michael Nees made a double substitution, replacing Musendami and Dzvukamanja with Prince Dube and Douglas Mapfumo.

Despite scoring the penalty, Billiat had a largely underwhelming performance and was replaced by Hachiro, while Nakamba made way for Divine Lunga as Zimbabwe sought to consolidate their slim lead.

Douglas Mapfumo had a chance to seal the game in the 90th minute but chose to shoot instead of passing to the open Zemura. His shot was tipped over the bar for a corner kick.

Washington Arubi delivered a man-of-the-match performance, making numerous saves to ensure the Warriors collected all three points.
