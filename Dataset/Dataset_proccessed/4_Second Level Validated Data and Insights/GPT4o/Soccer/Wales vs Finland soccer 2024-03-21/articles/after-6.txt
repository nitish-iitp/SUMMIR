Wales celebrate their third goal of the game (Getty Images)

Wales beat Finland tonight in the Euro 2024 play-off semi-finals as they bid to join England and Scotland in the tournament this summer. David Brooks, Neco Williams, Brennan Johnson and Dan James got on the scoresheet in a comprehensive 4-1 win.

Rob Page’s side have now qualified for a play-off final against Poland on Tuesday, also in Cardiff, after the Poles beat Estonia. The winner of that match will book their place at the Euros.

Wales qualified for both of the past two European Championships, memorably reaching the semi-finals in France in 2016 where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal, before they were knocked out by Denmark in the round of 16 in the delayed Euro 2020. Wales also qualified for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar but failed to win a game and were knocked out in the group stage.

Follow all the latest reaction from Wales v Finland in their Euro 2024 play-off semi-final below.

Summary: Wales move within one win of Euro 2024

Substitute Dan James put the icing on the cake with a second-half solo goal as Wales thrashed Finland 4-1 in Cardiff on Thursday to set up a playoff final with Poland for a place at Euro 2024.

A leaping David Brooks got the hosts off to a dream start in the third minute when Harry Wilson’s shot was saved and rebounded to him for the knock-in.

Neco Williams made it 2-0 in the 38th when he blasted the ball into the top corner off a backheeled free kick by Wilson on the edge of the box, but Finland pulled one back with Teemu Pukki’s 40th international goal on the stroke of halftime.

Brennan Johnson restored the two-goal cushion from close-range in the 47th, after Ethan Ampadu headed on from a free kick, and stand-in captain Ben Davies had a fourth ruled out by VAR in the 79th.

James then made it 4-1 in the 86th when he sprinted clear, dribbled around goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky and slotted the ball into an open goal.

Wales will play Poland, who beat a 10-man Estonia 5-1, at the same Cardiff stadium on Tuesday.

Neco Williams reacts to Wales win

“A great performance. We came into the night with a gameplan and it came off. It wasn’t planned or anything, it was just instinct. Happy to score for my country, it’s a special feeling.

“We’ve got a final now on Tuesday. We’ve got one huge game to go and hopefully we put on one huge performance to put us through to the Euros.”

Full-time: Wales 4-1 Finland

Wales go through to the Euro 2024 play-off finals, and they do so in style, playing some excellent football and scoring some lovely goals too.

They will be back here on Tuesday to take on Poland, which will be a much stiffer task. The winner will go to Euro 2024.

Here’s a look at that slightly bizarre fourth Wales goal:

GOAL! Wales 4-1 Finland (James, 87)

Well this time it does count! Dan James pounces on a terrible piece of defending, pinches the ball, dribbles around Hradecky and rolls it into an empty net.

RULED OUT! Wales 3-1 Finland

Presumably there is no goal-line technology at play here, because the referee has gone with VAR’s view that the ball never fully crossed the line, after a brief check of a pitch-side monitor.

The replay isn’t perfect but does seem to suggest there might have been a fraction of the ball not fully over the goal line. It’s ruled out, much to Ben Davies’ surprise.

GOAL! Wales 4-1 Finland (Davies, 79)... or is it?

Ben Davies meets a corner with a solid header, which Hradecky can only push towards his left post. The goalkeeper dives across to try and prevent the ball from going over the line but he gets there late, Davies appeals and the referee gives a goal. Now VAR is checking...
