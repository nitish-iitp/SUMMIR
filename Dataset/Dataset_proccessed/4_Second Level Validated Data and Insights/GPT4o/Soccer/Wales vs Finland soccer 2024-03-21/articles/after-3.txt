TELL ME MORE

Rob Page's team set up a final date with a Poland side who ran riot in a 5-1 win against Estonia on the same day. However, the Dragons showed they can give Robert Lewandowski and Co. something to fear when they welcome them to the Cardiff City Stadium next week.

Wales could hardly have made a better start to the match. The hosts found the lead just three minutes in when Harry Wilson played a one-two to break into the Finland box and fired a shot at goal. It was saved but knocked into the path of David Brooks, who made no mistake with his finish.

Finland managed to hold the majority of possession after the goal, but the away team had a hard time getting into difficult positions, with heavy touches and wayward passes proving their undoing. Instead, it was Wales who struck next when they were given a free-kick outside the box and Neco Williams lashed it into the net.

Finland pulled a goal back just before half-time when a smart pass found Teemu Pukki and the Minnesota United forward slotted past Danny Ward. Wales killed off their momentum quickly in the second half, though, as a deep cross was headed across goal and knocked towards Brennan Johnson, who fired in from close range.

Wales were on top from then on and, after having another goal ruled out, they struck for a fourth time when a defensive howler gave Daniel James a free run at the goalkeeper to tuck it away right at the end.

THE MVP

Southampton forward Brooks was decisive for the Welsh as he grabbed the important early opener to give his team a boost and rattle their opponents. He then helped ensure they restored a comfortable lead when he found Johnson in space to smash home their third.

THE BIG LOSER

Finland winger Daniel Hakans did not have the best of matches for the away side. He saw one wayward effort miss the target in the first half and then slipped as he challenged Ethan Ampadu for the header and ended up playing Johnson onside, letting Wales kill the game off.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Wales progress to the play-off final where they will take on a Poland side who beat Estonia on Thursday. The final will be played in Cardiff on March 26 and the winner will go on to join Netherlands, France and Austria in Group D.
