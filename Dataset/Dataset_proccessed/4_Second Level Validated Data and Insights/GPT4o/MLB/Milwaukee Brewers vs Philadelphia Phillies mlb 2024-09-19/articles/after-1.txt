Brewers give 20-year-old Jackson Chourio stroller of non-alcoholic beer for clinch party

Jackson Chourio has been doing unprecedented things at age 20, becoming the first player in Major League history to hit 20 homers and record 20 stolen bases before he turns 21.

But there's one thing he cannot do — legally drink alcohol.

That meant his celebration would be a bit different when the Brewers clinched the National League Central on Wednesday, and apparently, his teammates let him know about it.

Inside the clubhouse for Chourio was a stroller full of non-alcoholic options, plus a Chourio shirsey and a bobblehead in case anyone doubted for whom the ensemble was intended.

Chourio led off the ninth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies with a triple and eventually scored the winning run on Jake Bauers' single for a 2-1 victory. The Brewers had clinched earlier in the day when the Chicago Cubs fell to Oakland, but the walk-off win was icing on the cake.
