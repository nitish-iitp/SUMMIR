TEXAS RANGERS CLINCH HISTORIC FIRST WORLD SERIES AS GAME 5 WIN LANDS SERIES VICTORY OVER ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS
BYIBRAHIM MUSTAPHA

UPDATED 02/11/2023 AT 12:58 GMT

The Texas Rangers are World Series champions for the first time in the history of the franchise following a 4-1 series win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, sealed with a 5-0 victory in game five at Chase field. After opening the scoring in the seventh innings, the Rangers extended their lead in the ninth to take the title. It was manager Bruce Bochy's fourth World Series crown.

The Texas Rangers have won their first World Series title after sealing a 4-1 series win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
The best-of-seven series was settled with two games to spare as the Rangers ran out 5-0 winners at Chase Field, with Marcus Semien scoring a two-run home run.

A tense and tight match saw Diamondbacks starting pitcher Zac Gallen not allowing a single hit in the first six innings.

On the plate for the Rangers, Nathan Eovaldi was able to keep the hosts at bay for much of the opening exchanges as the game remained scoreless, albeit with the Diamondbacks failing to capitalise with runners on the bases in both the third and fifth innings.
The Rangers finally got on the board in the seventh after Corey Seager picked up their first hit of the night in Arizona, allowing Mitch Garver the opportunity to send him home with a single.
Bolstered by this breakthrough, the Rangers stretched their lead at the top of the ninth, courtesy of Jonah Heim’s single forcing an error in the outfield from Alek Thomas, freeing up Josh Jung and Nathaniel Lowe to make it 3-0.
Semien put the icing on the cake with his two-run homer before Josh Sborz struck out Ketel Marte to set celebrations in motion as the Rangers clinched a first title after a 62-year wait.
Having started life as the Washington Senators in 1961, the franchise moved to Texas in 1972 but despite some American League Championship success, the World Series had eluded them until now.
Victory for manager Bruce Bochy saw the 68-year-old claim his fourth World Series crown having secured his previous three with the San Francisco Giants.
“That’s a credit to [general manager] Chris Young and the ownership, Ray Davis,” Bochy said afterwards.
“They were determined to get winning baseball back to the Texas Rangers. And when we met, that's what we talked about. And they did everything they said they were going to do.”
Rangers shortstop Seager was named series MVP, making him just the fourth player to win the award twice having previously picked up the award in 2020 while with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
He joins legends Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson and Reggie Jackson on this exclusive list of multiple World Series MVP winners.
“I don’t think you can ever fathom that,” the 29-year old said. “It’s a pretty special group to be part of.”
