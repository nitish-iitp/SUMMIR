With Shohei Ohtani having secured his 50/50 season and the team clinching a postseason berth now in the rearview mirror, there wasn’t much at stake in the Los Angeles Dodgers’ series against the Colorado Rockies this weekend.

The Dodgers are still determined to stay ahead of the San Diego Padres and clinch the National League West division title. This series was between two teams whose postseason fates have been decided: one that will be in the thick of a championship chase, and another that will be on a beach in Cancun, a couch in the Colorado mountains or somewhere in between.

Given the stark contrast between the Rockies and Dodgers, LA had the option of sitting back, relaxing and focusing on the playoffs ahead. Instead, they attacked the series with the same energy and emotion as if it were the playoffs. Dodger fans can only hope the team will maintain that mentality for clutch situations in October.

Friday’s game was a true bullpen game. Brusdar Graterol was the only Dodger to throw multiple innings, getting through the third and fourth. Ryan Brasier, Joe Kelly, Daniel Hudson, Alex Vesia, Evan Phillips, Blake Treinen and Michael Kopech also threw an inning each. The eight arms each did their part to help the Dodgers secure a 6-4 victory, and Vesia was credited with the win and Kopech the save.

Offensively, the story was clutch home runs. Ohtani hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the bottom of the fifth, and after the Rox tied it in the sixth, Teoscar Hernandez put the boys in blue right back ahead with a go-ahead solo shot. Hernandez also helped extend the lead with an RBI single in the bottom of the seventh.

Much has been made out of Ohtani’s addition to the Dodgers’ already deep and dangerous lineup with hopes he can help them get over the hump this postseason, but in October, its often unheralded heroes that come out of the woodworks. If he continues his clutch hitting, Hernandez could end up being the lineup addition that breaks the annual curse of Dodger bats freezing up in October.

The Dodgers dropped the middle game on Saturday 6-3. The game was tied 3-3 at one point, but Rockies infielder Ryan McMahon hit a go-ahead homer in the top of the fifth and the Rockies bullpen locked the game down from there while the bats continued to extend their lead.

The most encouraging aspect of the game for the Dodgers was Walker Buehler’s start. It wasn’t particularly great as he surrendered four runs, but he competed and kept the Dodgers in the game through five and a half innings of work. With so many rotation arms continuing to be on the shelf and the bullpen having to endure a high workload, Buehler’s growth in stretching himself out coming off Tommy John is encouraging. If he can eat up innings and compete in October, that will do wonders for a Dodger rotation that desperately needs it. Fortunately, Buehler himself said that he felt like he competed well and he’s simply hoping for better results. He has one more start before the postseason to sort things out.

Sunday’s game was by far the most entertaining. After a short and mediocre start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Dodgers found themselves down 5-1 early and still trailed  5-4 heading into the bottom of the ninth.

In the ninth inning, however, the Dodgers’ playoff energy came in. Leading off the inning, Ohtani jumped on an off-speed pitch from Seth Halvorsen and crushed it to right-center field to tie the game. The emotion was written all over Ohtani’s face as he rounded the bases and screamed back at an erupting Dodger Stadium.

Perhaps energized by Ohtani, Mookie Betts followed Ohtani’s homer up by casually flipping a 100mph fastball over the left-field wall to give the Dodgers a 6-5 lead and the win. Betts emulated Ohtani’s energy when he rounded the bases, looking as if the Dodgers had won a playoff game.

Back-to-back home runs to win a game is not something seen every day, but that’s exactly what the Dodgers will need in the postseason given the perennial target on their back: improbable exciting feats of stardom in desperate moments.

Luckily, they have a roster full of players who can provide just that.

This article was written before the Dodgers 4-2 defeat to the San Diego Padres on September 24.
