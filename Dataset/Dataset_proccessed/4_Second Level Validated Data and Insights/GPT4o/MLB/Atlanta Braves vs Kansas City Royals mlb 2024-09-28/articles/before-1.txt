Kansas City Royals vs Atlanta Braves Prediction

I might try KC here. Lugo has one bad start and two pretty good ones in his last three outings. In the bad one Lugo notched four earned in 4.2 innings versus the Tigers. In the two good starts Lugo posted a combined 14.0 innings and two earned runs, going 1-1 in the pair.

On Friday the Royals got a pretty nice pitching effort overall but the offense couldn’t rise to the occasion. Michael Massey had two of the team’s three hits and there were only two walks in the game. I like KC to come back better Saturday but they’ve got to get the bats going.
