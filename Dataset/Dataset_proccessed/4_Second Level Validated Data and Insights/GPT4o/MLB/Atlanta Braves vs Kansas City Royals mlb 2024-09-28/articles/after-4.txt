13 SECONDS REMAINING

ATLANTA -- Reynaldo López's return start was very encouraging. Travis d'Arnaud's walk-off home run was exciting. But things got even better for the Braves after they celebrated a 2-1 win over the Royals on Saturday night at Truist Park.

Shortly after d’Arnaud’s game-ending homer sailed over the center field wall, the Mets suffered a 6-0 loss to the Brewers. Less than an hour later, the D-backs were blanked 5-0 by the Padres.

So the Braves stand a game ahead of both the D-backs and Mets in the battle for the National League’s final two Wild Card spots. Atlanta can clinch a postseason berth with either a win over the Royals on Sunday, or a D-backs loss to the Padres.

Even if the Braves clinch, there is a chance they would still have to play Monday’s doubleheader against the Mets, if the Mets have not yet clinched. New York holds the tiebreaker over Arizona.

All the potential scenarios in the NL Wild Card race

“Our mentality is to keep doing whatever is necessary to win these games, hopefully get a spot in the postseason and then just wreak havoc from there,” López said through an interpreter.

The Braves entered this week two games behind both the Mets and D-backs. But their true resiliency in a season filled with significant injuries has shown during the final week. They claimed their fifth straight win when d’Arnaud drilled Sam Long’s 2-0 fastball and watched it sail over the outfield wall.

“I feel like that gave us a bolt of energy and a real boost right there,” López said.

d’Arnaud’s second career walk-off homer and first for the Braves certainly added to this week’s excitement. The Braves claimed a big win over the Mets on Tuesday, sat idle through two weather-related postponements, watched Max Fried finish an out shy of a shutout on Friday and then saw López dazzle in his first start off the injured list.

López surrendered two hits and one run while recording nine strikeouts during his 73-pitch, six-inning effort. Consecutive singles to begin the third inning led to the lone run. Each of his strikeouts was registered with his slider. He had never previously tallied more than five strikeouts in a game with that pitch.

“I think when he hit 99 (mph) in the first, we knew he was feeling OK,” d’Arnaud said. “Even his bullpen was electric too. For him to go six innings after missing that much time gives us a lot of confidence going forward, especially if we’re fortunate enough to advance. Having him along with all of our other starters is going to be a deadly weapon.”

Exactly who the Braves would have available to start the Wild Card Series -- which would be played from Tuesday-Thursday -- remains to be seen, though after the game they did announce that Charlie Morton would start the finale against the Royals.

By starting Morton on Sunday, the Braves can hold Chris Sale and Spencer Schwellenbach back to see what could be at stake on Monday. If the Braves have nothing to play for that day, both could be saved for the best-of-three Wild Card Series, which would be played against either the Brewers or the Padres.

Fried would be on regular rest for Wednesday’s Game 2. López would be on regular rest if needed to start Thursday’s Game 3.

In other words, manager Brian Snitker has a number of good options regardless of what unfolds over the next few days.

“Our rotation from top to bottom is the best we’ve had since I’ve been a manager here,” Snitker said.

When López left his Sept. 10 start after just one inning, there was reason to wonder if his shoulder discomfort would prevent him from pitching again this season. The 30-year-old hurler quieted concerns with a couple bullpen sessions he threw over the past week.

But he was far better than anybody could have imagined. His four-seam fastball touched 98.9 mph and still registered 96.7 mph during his sixth and final inning. The Royals whiffed with 12 of 18 swings against his slider.

“I think what our pitchers did is better than what I did at the end, because I wouldn't have had that chance unless our pitchers kept us in the game like they did,” d’Arnaud said.

López was a successful reliever who transitioned to a starting role during Spring Training and earned his first All-Star selection. A pair of short stints on the injured list could be attributed to him serving as a starter for the first time since 2021. But he posted a 2.00 ERA over 25 starts and now may have a chance to make postseason starts.

“I couldn’t have expected this type of season to be put together, and I think it’s just been tremendous,” López said.
