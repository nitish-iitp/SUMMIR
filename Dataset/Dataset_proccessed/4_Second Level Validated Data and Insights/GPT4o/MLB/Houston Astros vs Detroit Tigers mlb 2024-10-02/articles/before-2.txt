AL Wild Card Game 2 Preview: Detroit Tigers vs. Houston Astros - October 2, 2024

Matchup: Detroit Tigers (86-76) at Houston Astros (88-73)

Venue: Minute Maid Park, Houston, Texas - 11:30 AM ET

 

Introduction

The Houston Astros face the Detroit Tigers in Game 2 of the AL Wild Card series, aiming to even the series after dropping Game 1. With Hunter Brown on the mound, who has dominated Detroit throughout the regular season, Houston is well-positioned to bounce back. The Tigers will counter with left-hander Tyler Holton, who has been solid in relief this season but faces a daunting task against a powerful Astros lineup.

 

Odds Table
Team\tMoneyline\tRun Line\tOver/Under
Detroit Tigers (86-76)\t+145\t+1.5 (-150)\tOver 7.5 (-110)
Houston Astros (88-73)\t-175\t-1.5 (+125)\tUnder 7.5 (-110)

Interpretation: The Astros are favored at -175 after their Game 1 loss, with the Tigers as +145 underdogs. The total is set at 7.5, reflecting the expectation of a low-scoring game, largely due to Hunter Brown's success against the Tigers and Detroit's inconsistent offense.

 

Team Analysis
Detroit Tigers

The Tigers secured a 3-1 victory in Game 1 to take a 1-0 series lead. Riley Greene, who leads the team with 24 home runs and 74 RBIs, will need to continue being a catalyst for Detroit’s offense. Despite Greene’s production, the Tigers' .234 team batting average and lack of depth in their lineup remain concerns. Facing Houston’s ace, Hunter Brown, Detroit’s hitters will be tested, and another low-scoring game is likely if they can't string together quality at-bats.

Tyler Holton will make the start for the Tigers. Holton has primarily worked as a reliever, posting a 2.66 ERA over 74 appearances this season. In 84.2 innings pitched, he has struck out 77 batters while maintaining a solid 1.09 WHIP. However, his lack of starting experience in a postseason setting raises concerns. Holton’s ability to induce soft contact and pitch efficiently will be crucial if Detroit is to pull off another upset.

Houston Astros

The Astros, despite their Game 1 loss, have been one of the most consistent teams in the league. Yordan Alvarez continues to be a force in the middle of the lineup with 35 home runs, 86 RBIs, and a .308 average. The Astros’ .262 team batting average and .322 OBP illustrate their balanced attack. Heading into Game 2, Houston will look to capitalize on Tyler Holton’s inexperience and avoid falling into an 0-2 hole at home.

Hunter Brown, the Astros’ right-hander, will take the mound in Game 2. Brown had an outstanding regular season, finishing with a 14-7 record, a 3.38 ERA, and a 1.17 WHIP over 189 innings. He racked up 204 strikeouts while allowing just 52 walks. His fastball, which regularly hits the upper 90s, combined with a sharp curveball, has made him one of the most effective pitchers in the AL. Brown has been especially dominant against Detroit, holding the Tigers to a .198 batting average in his two starts against them this season, allowing just two earned runs across 14 innings.

 
Starting Pitcher Analysis
Tyler Holton (DET)

Tyler Holton enters this game with limited starting experience but has been a valuable piece in Detroit's bullpen throughout the regular season. His 2.66 ERA and 1.09 WHIP over 84.2 innings reflect his ability to handle high-leverage situations. Holton's success has come from inducing weak contact, with his changeup and slider being his primary weapons against right-handed hitters. However, starting against a potent Astros lineup in a must-win game presents a significant challenge, and Holton’s ability to work deep into the game is uncertain.

Hunter Brown (HOU)

Hunter Brown has emerged as one of Houston’s aces, with a 14-7 record, a 3.38 ERA, and 204 strikeouts over 189 innings this season. His ability to generate strikeouts, with an impressive 10.6 K/9 rate, has made him a dominant force. Brown has owned the Tigers in previous meetings, limiting their offense to just two earned runs in 14 innings while striking out 19. With his mix of velocity and off-speed pitches, Brown is well-equipped to silence Detroit’s bats once again and put Houston in a position to even the series.

 
Recent Performance
Detroit Tigers
10/1/24: Won 3-1 @ Astros
9/29/24: Lost 9-5 vs. White Sox
9/28/24: Lost 4-0 vs. White Sox
9/27/24: Won 4-1 vs. White Sox
9/26/24: Won 4-3 vs. Rays

The Tigers enter Game 2 with momentum after their Game 1 victory, but their offense has been inconsistent in recent games, with multiple low-scoring performances to close the regular season. They’ll need to rely on their pitching staff to keep the game close if they are to secure a series win.

Houston Astros
10/1/24: Lost 3-1 vs. Tigers
9/28/24: Won 4-3 @ Guardians
9/27/24: Won 5-2 @ Guardians
9/25/24: Lost 8-1 vs. Mariners
9/24/24: Won 4-3 vs. Mariners

The Astros have been steady, despite dropping Game 1, and have shown the ability to bounce back after losses. With their backs against the wall in Game 2, they’ll need their offense to step up and support Brown on the mound to avoid an early playoff exit.

Head-to-Head Comparison

Houston dominated the regular-season series against Detroit, largely due to Hunter Brown’s dominance. The Astros' pitching has kept the Tigers' offense in check, and with Brown on the mound again in Game 2, Houston has a significant edge. Detroit’s Game 1 win may provide confidence, but their lack of offensive firepower against Brown’s electric arsenal suggests Houston will have the upper hand.

Against the Spread (ATS) Records
Detroit Tigers

Detroit is 79-83 ATS this season, with mixed results as road underdogs. While they managed to pull off an upset in Game 1, the combination of Tyler Holton’s inexperience as a starter and Hunter Brown’s dominance over Detroit makes it difficult for the Tigers to cover in Game 2.

Houston Astros

Houston is 85-76 ATS in 2024, particularly strong as home favorites. After a rare loss in Game 1, the Astros are poised to bounce back behind Brown, and their ATS record as heavy favorites points to them covering the run line.

Betting Stats and Trends
The Astros are 8-3 in their last 11 home games as favorites.
Houston is 5-1 in their last six games after a loss.
The under is 6-2 in Detroit’s last eight games against AL West opponents.
Detroit has gone under the total in 58% of their games when playing on the road with totals of 7.5 or lower.
The Astros are 9-4 in their last 13 playoff games as favorites of -150 or more.
 
Prediction

Hunter Brown’s dominance over the Tigers, combined with Houston’s need to avoid elimination, makes the Astros the clear favorite in this matchup. Brown’s ability to overpower Detroit’s lineup, coupled with Holton’s limited experience, gives Houston a strong advantage. Expect the Astros to win Game 2 and force a decisive Game 3 in this AL Wild Card series.
