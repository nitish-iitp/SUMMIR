121! White Sox fall to playoff-bound Tigers, set modern-era record for losses in season
A 4-1 defeat of the Sox before a celebrating sold-out crowd at Comerica Park clinched a playoff berth for the Tigers (86-74), who have won as many games (39) since the All-Star break as the Sox (39-121) have all season.

DETROIT — The White Sox held it off for as long as they could.

But there’s no stopping these red-hot Tigers.

After enjoying a three-game sweep of the struggling Angels to avoid history in front of their disgruntled home fans, the Sox went back to their losing ways Friday, falling for the 121st time to set a modern-day major-league record on the third-to-last day of the season.
