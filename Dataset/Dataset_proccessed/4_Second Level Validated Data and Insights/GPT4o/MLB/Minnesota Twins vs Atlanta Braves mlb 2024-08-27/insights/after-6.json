        "Manager Brian Snitker commented, 'That\u2019s a good win. It was going to be a costly loss, quite honestly. Now, it\u2019s a good win.'",
        "Travis d\u2019Arnaud said, 'We knew we were getting some heat, and were able to fight off the good offspeed pitches, too. Just competitive at-bats throughout. I think everybody felt bad that we gave up the lead and wanted to make sure we ended with a win.'",
        "Marcell Ozuna praised d'Arnaud, saying, 'He\u2019s a clutch hitter. Every time he\u2019s got the situation in that spot, he\u2019ll do something. He\u2019ll do some damage.'",
        "Ozuna also reflected, 'We always play the game like a playoff [matchup]. We always build and prepare for what\u2019s next coming up.'"
