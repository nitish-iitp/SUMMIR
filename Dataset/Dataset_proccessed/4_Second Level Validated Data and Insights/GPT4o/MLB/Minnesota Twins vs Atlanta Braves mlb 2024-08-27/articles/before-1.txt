Avoids arbitration with Minnesota
The Twins and Jeffers avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $4.55 million contract Thursday, Darren Wolfson of Channel 5 Saint Paul reports.
Impact Jeffers had been eligible for salary arbitration for a second time. The catcher took a step back offensively in 2024 with a .226/.300/.432 batting line but still crank a career-high 21 home runs. He's currently slated to share catching duties with Christian Vazquez in 2025.

Starting again Sunday
Jeffers will serve as the Twins' designated hitter and bat seventh in Sunday's game against the Royals.
Impact With Carlos Santana (illness) sitting out, Jeffers will be included in the lineup for the fifth time in six games. Jeffers has made three starts at catcher and two at DH during that stretch, but he'll likely fall back into more of a timeshare behind the plate with Christian Vazquez and see his opportunities at DH diminish once Santana is healthy again.

Back on bench Monday
Jeffers is out of the lineup for Monday's game against Atlanta.

The Twins haven't indicated that Jeffers emerged from the contest with any sort of setback, as his absence from the lineup a day later is likely just a result of him being in a near-even timeshare behind the plate with Christian Vazquez, who draws the starting nod Monday.
