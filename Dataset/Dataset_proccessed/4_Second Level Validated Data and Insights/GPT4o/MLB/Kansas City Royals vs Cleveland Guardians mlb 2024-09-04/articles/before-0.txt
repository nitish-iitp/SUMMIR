Cleveland Guardians vs Kansas City Royals Prediction 

Cleveland comes into this game red hot and they are looking for their fourth win in a row. The Guardians were really struggling about a week ago, but they have turned things around and are pulling away in the AL Central once again. Cleveland is 37-34 on the road, while KC is 41-30 at home this year. Both of these pitchers have been pretty strong all season, but they have had some poor outings recently. I really don’t trust either starter in this spot, so I am going to side with the over in this matchup.
