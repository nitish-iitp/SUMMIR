Max Rieper has been the managing editor of Royals Review since 2014.

Craig Brown wrote he was still optimistic during the losing streak.

A six-game losing streak in late August that spills over into September would, you would think, damage the chances of a contending team. That’s not necessarily the case as the Wild Card has become a war of attrition. Not only have the Royals stumbled in their last 10 games, the team closest to the Wild Card pack, the Boston Red Sox, have failed to capitalize, matching the Royals’ record. The Twins had a chance to build some distance between themselves and the Royals, but could only add a single game.

So it remains a 4.5 game cushion. Obviously, that can evaporate if the Royals remain mired in an offensive funk, but given some of the numbers I presented above, I see these most recent issues as a little regression in the extreme.

Kevin O’Brien at Royals Reporter writes that Tommy Pham and Robbie Grossman could give the team an offensive lift.

Pham has a BB/K ratio of 0.41, while Grossman has a ratio of 0.64. Both those ratios would rank them in the Top 5 of Royals hitters with ten or more plate appearances this season.

Furthermore, their Decision Value+ metrics have demonstrated excellent trends throughout the season. That makes them ideal candidates for the Royals’ leadoff duties for the remainder of the year.

As Royals fans can see above, Pham has a season Decision Value+ near 120, which ranks him in the 90th percentile of the league. Grossman’s mark is above 110, which puts him above the 75th percentile. Grossman has seen a marked improvement since July after hovering near the league average in this area in June.

The Royals need that kind of decision-making from the top spot of the batting order.
