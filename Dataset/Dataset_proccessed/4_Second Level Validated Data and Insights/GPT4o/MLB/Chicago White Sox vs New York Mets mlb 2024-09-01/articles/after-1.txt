A miserable year continues to get worse for the Chicago White Sox.

Chicago fell 2-0 to the New York Mets on Sunday, completing a sweep in the weekend series. More notably, it was the White Sox's 10th consecutive loss and 107th loss on the season.

This sets the franchise record for losses in a single season, beating the previous mark set by the 1970 team. That squad went 56-106.

Despite taking the loss, starting pitcher Garrett Crochet looked pretty sharp. The southpaw struck out eight batters—including an AL record-tying seven straight to start the game—while allowing just three hits and a run.

Interim manager Grady Sizemore ultimately pulled the plug early to manage his inning count.

"He was pretty frustrated when I came out there, but I think he knows the situation and what we're trying to do," Sizemore said, per the Associated Press. "He threw well. He was on, he had good stuff. It's going to be tough when he's on a short leash like that and a pitch count, that he's never going to get to go as deep as he wants."

The bats were ultimately unable to get anything going, which wasted a pretty solid day from the pitching staff. The two hits mustered came from Gavin Sheets and Miguel Vargas, neither of which resulted in anything beyond a single.

The loss officially makes this disastrous season historic and the franchise will have major decisions to make following the season. More history could be coming before that happens.

The worst record of all-time is unattainable, as the 1899 Cleveland Spiders went a dismal 20-134. However, the worst record of the modern era is still in play, as the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics went 36-117.

The worst record in a 162-game season belongs to the 2003 Detroit Tigers, who went 43-119. The White Sox would have to go 12-12 down the stretch to tie that record.

Chicago will be back in action on Monday against the Baltimore Orioles. That game has a 3:05 p.m. ET. start.
