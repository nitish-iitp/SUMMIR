Dodgers' Freddie Freeman channels Kirk Gibson with walk-off grand slam
By Michael Duarte

Thirty-six years ago, Kirk Gibson hit a walk-off grand slam in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series.

In Game 1 against the New York Yankees, it was Freddie Freeman's turn to deliver for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Los Angeles went on to win the 1988 title 4-1 over the Oakland Athletics. Freeman's play may be the moment that sparks another Dodgers' triumph.

Freeman played through a broken finger earlier in the year, then missed two weeks at the end of July after his three-year old son Max was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological condition in which the body’s immune system attacks its nerves, causing weakness, numbness, and in the case of Max, full-body paralysis.

“These last few months have been a lot. They’ve been a grind,” said Freeman reflecting on his tumultuous journey to this moment in time. “I love the history of this game, so to be a part of it, it’s special.”

So why was the change suddenly made?
