        "The Dodgers head into New York in a position of strength in the World Series, up two games to none.",
        "Walker Buehler will start Game 3 on Monday night in New York.",
        "The Dodgers will run a bullpen game in Game 4, with Jack Flaherty presumably available for a potential Game 5 on four days rest if his hamstring feels good.",
        "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, whose two-run home run in Game 2 widened the Dodgers\u2019 lead, said the Dodgers are confident whether or not Ohtani plays."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez said, 'We were battling throughout the year with a lot of injuries. First was the starting pitchers, then Mookie, and then Freddie. And hopefully not Ohtani in this case. It\u2019s not going to be a good feeling, but if he can\u2019t go on Monday, we just have to keep doing the thing we\u2019ve been doing for the past couple weeks.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Historically, being up 2-0 in the World Series has proven fruitful, with 45 of the first 56 teams (80.4 percent) that won the first two games also winning the championship.",
        "Even though it had been 43 years since the Yankees and Dodgers met in the Fall Classic, they have an October history richer than any pair of teams in major league history, as this is their 12th World Series matchup."
