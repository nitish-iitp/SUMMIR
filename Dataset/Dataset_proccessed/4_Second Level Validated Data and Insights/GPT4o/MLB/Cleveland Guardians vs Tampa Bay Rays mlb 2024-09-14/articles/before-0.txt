Tampa Bay Rays vs Cleveland Guardians Prediction

I might try Cleveland here. Probably not touching it, though. Cantillo is coming off a very nice start on September 9—but it was against the flailing White Sox. In that one Cantillo went 7.0 innings with just two hits and one earned in a victory. A quality start this time is probably a coin-flip proposition.

On Friday the Guardians got a nice pen performance and Tanner Bibee wasn’t too bad (6.0 innings; three earned; nine Ks). The bats were pretty silent on four team hits, though. Cleveland needs to come alive at the plate Saturday.
