Hunter Goodman is making his case to catch in 2025

Early in the season I questioned what the Colorado Rockies were doing to facilitate the development of Hunter Goodman, who had been called up at the end of April but was still receiving only sporadic playing time.

When he did play, Goodman largely donned a first baseman or outfielder’s glove. Goodman primarily played catcher in college with the University of Memphis before he was drafted by the Rockies in 2021. Concerns about his defense and receiving saw him spend more time at first base and in the outfield as a part of the Rockies’ farm system.

Fangraphs was particularly low on Goodman’s future as a catcher, calling him “a heavy-handed receiver with mobility issues” that was unlikely to stay behind the plate.

When Elias Díaz injured his hand in May, Goodman finally made his first career start at his native position on May 18th while going 2-for-4 on offense.

Playing in 34 games between May 18th and the All-Star Break, Goodman made 11 moren appearances behind the plate. Offensively he struggled, racking up 31 strikeouts and just two walks while posting a .191 batting average and a .209 on-base percentage. However, he did flash potential as a power threat with seven doubles and five home runs. The highlight of this stretch came on June 15th against the Pittsburgh Pirates where he went 4-for-5 with two home runs.

Goodman also drew praise for his abilities as a backstop, which he had been working on over the offseason with former MLB catchers in Rockies catching coordinator Dustin Garneau and bench coach Mike Redmond, as well as bullpen catcher Aaron Muñoz.

“Overall, he brings calmness, and he has a good feel for the game, game-calling, and in the technical aspects of catching, he’s a solid performer,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “Game-calling and blocking, and he throws and receives fine. It’s there. It just hasn’t been talked about or gotten a lot of attention.”

After the All-Star Break, Goodman’s playing time began to dry up, and when he did play it was either in the outfield or as the designated hitter. Michael Toglia had seized the starting first baseman job for himself and starts at catcher were once again going to the veteran duo of Elias Díaz and Jacob Stallings. When top catching prospect Drew Romo (no. 9 PuRP) was promoted to the big league roster, it wasn’t long before Goodman was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque.

Since Goodman returned to the big league club with the September roster expansion he has a .871 OPS with three home runs and seven doubles over 28 at-bats. He has also made five starts at catcher in his nine games played.

On Friday against the Cubs he received starting pitcher Austin Gomber well while also having a fantastic night at the plate. Goodman went 3-for-4 with two home runs and seven RsSI, including a heroic late game grand slam that brought the Rockies victory. As the season winds down, Goodman is using these opportunities to audition for a continued big league role.

“With just a couple weeks left, there’s impact to be had for these young guys,” Bud Black said. “They’re wanting to make a statement in letting us know that they’re Major League players. And a night like this from Goody helps his cause.”

The Rockies’ catching position for 2025 is surprisingly murky. When Drew Romo was promoted it was expected that he would receive the lion’s share of playing time—and he did for a time. From August 17th through August 31st Romo made eight starts as catcher, splitting time with Jacob Stallings. However, he has played less than expected so far this September. With the month half-over Romo has played in just five games so far with four starts behind the plate. In that time he has just one hit in 16 at-bats.

At the same time the veteran Stallings has thrived this season in Colorado, hitting .261/.358/.455 in 75 games with a career high nine home runs. Stallings, 34, has a mutual option for 2025 that could see him return to the team next season and with Elias Díaz now gone the Rockies could look to retain him as a veteran presence for a young team getting younger.

Stallings has also embraced his role as a teacher for the younger catching group.

“It’s just helping them understand that the struggles of the big leagues are going to come, whether it’s behind the plate or at the plate, and the guys who are most consistent are most consistent mentally,” Stallings said. “Just be nice to yourself. The game is so much faster up here, especially for a catcher.”

For Hunter Goodman, the last few weeks of the 2024 season represent a chance to establish a role for himself with the future of this organization both at the plate and behind it. With the 2025 catching group yet to be set in stone, he is making his case to be a part of it.

On the Farm

Triple-A: Las Vegas Aviators 13, Albuquerque Isotopes 1

It was a tough final home game for the Isotopes, who were trounced by Las Vegas in definitive fashion. Ty Blach gave up nine runs off of eight hits—including two home runs—to the Aviators while the ‘Topes offense was anemic. Albuquerque’s sole run came via a solo shot off the bat of Trevor Boone. Ryan Rolison pitched two scoreless innings of relief, giving up just one hit.

Double-A: Hartford Yard Goats 5, Akron RubberDucks 4

Adael Amador (no. 3 PuRP) went 2-for-4 with his 14th home run of the season as he looks to finish the 2024 season strong while Bladimir Restituyo and Juan Guerrero also had multi-hit outings. The Yard Goats’ regular season is complete and they will take on the Somerset Patriots (New York Yankees) in the Division Series starting on Tuesday.

Injuries & Moves: Senzatela to be activated Monday | MLB.com

Right-handed pitcher Antonio Senzatela will make his triumphant return from Tommy John surgery this evening against the Arizona Diamondbacks for his first start since May of 2023. Senzatela will likely be on a firm pitch count of 70 for his start. The corresponding roster move to activate Senzatela is unknown, but could be Kris Bryant heading to the 60-day IL as his season is more than likely over.

‘Spokane needed a title’: Rockies’ High-A affiliate snaps championship drought | MLB.com

The High-A Spokane Indians won their first championship since 2008 as they beat the Vancouver Canadians for the Northwest League title over the weekend. The Indians became the most decorated team in Northwest League history as Kyle Karros (no. 14 PuRP) wore a pitch with the bases loaded in extra innings to drive in the winning run.
