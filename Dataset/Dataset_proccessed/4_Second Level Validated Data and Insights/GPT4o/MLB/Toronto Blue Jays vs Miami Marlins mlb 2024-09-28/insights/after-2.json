        "The Marlins and Blue Jays combined for 20 runs last night, and we expect more of the same this afternoon with two subpar hurlers taking the mound.",
        "Xzavion Curry has largely pitched out of the bullpen for the Marlins this season, but he\u2019s expected to make his fifth start of the year and first since July 23.",
        "Curry, who owns a 5.02 ERA on the season, has been slightly worse when starting ballgames, posting a 5.29 across those four previous outings.",
        "Things don\u2019t look much better on Toronto\u2019s mound as Yariel Rodriguez gets the call. He gave up four hits and three earned runs to the Rays in a losing effort on September 21 \u2014 the fourth time in seven starts that he surrendered at least three.",
        "Rodriguez, who likely won\u2019t pitch past the fifth inning, will hand the ball over to the second-worst bullpen in the majors (4.83 ERA), so we could see the Marlins do some damage late in the game once again."
