Philadelphia Phillies vs Toronto Blue Jays Prediction 

Toronto was able to jump on the Phillies in the first inning on Tuesday, but their pitching staff blew a five-run lead in the loss. The Phillies are 35-31 on the road, while the Blue Jays are 34-34 at home. Philadelphia has played very well over their last ten games and they are starting to play like they did prior to the All-Star break. The Blue Jays have been pretty bad with their pitching staff this year, but they are starting Bowden Francis, who has been electric over the last few weeks. The Phillies are going with Cristopher Sanchez, who has been very solid this year, despite a few poor outings in the last two months. Bowden Francis might be the hottest pitcher in the MLB right now, but I am still going to side with the Phillies at this reasonable number.
