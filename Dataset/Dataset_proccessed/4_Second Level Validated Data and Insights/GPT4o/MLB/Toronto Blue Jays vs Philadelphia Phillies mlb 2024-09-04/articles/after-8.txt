12 SECONDS REMAINING

TORONTO -- The Phillies want to clinch their first NL East title since 2011 and the No. 1 postseason seed as soon as possible.

These are their priorities.

But they also want their players to finish the regular season in good health. They will need them when the postseason begins in October. So hearts skipped a beat during Wednesday afternoon’s 4-2 victory over the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre, where Bryce Harper got drilled on the left elbow with a 92.9 mph fastball in the first inning and Brandon Marsh got drilled in the ribs with a 94.1 mph fastball in the seventh.

Harper left the game before the third inning with a bruised left elbow.

Marsh continued.

“I feel good,” Harper said. “I feel fine.”

Harper has been playing for weeks with a sore wrist and sore right elbow. He winced following a swing in the ninth inning on Tuesday night.

It looked bad, but manager Rob Thomson isn’t concerned, because his trainers and Harper aren’t concerned. There aren’t any short-term plans to rest Harper for a few days.

“I just don’t know how good I’ll feel if I take one or two days,” Harper said. “You know what I’m saying? I feel like I’ll feel the same if I do take two days off or anything like that. That’s a conversation we’ve had before. But I just feel like I’m going to feel the exact same if I do take two or three days off and I come back.”

Harper said that his right elbow mostly bothers him when he swings and misses or fouls off a pitch.

“From what I understand of what’s going on, it’s not going to further injure me,” Harper said. “But swing-and-miss is going to happen. I’ll probably drop my bat again and you guys will see it. Just know it’s part of it. It’s not anything out of the ordinary.”

The Phillies flew to Miami on Thursday night with a seven-game lead over Atlanta in the division with 23 games to play. FanGraphs gives them a 97.2 percent chance to win the division, and an 86.3 percent chance to clinch a first-round bye.

It looks good for them, but they know they haven’t clinched until they’ve clinched.

“Obviously, we’re not far enough in this division to take the days and do those types of things,” Harper said about taking a few days of rest. “Maybe once we get there, hopefully we’ll get a couple days. But obviously we want to win this division, we want to check off that main goal of ours. Once we get there, we’ll see.”

Harper isn’t the only Phillies player dealing with something. Alec Bohm has not played since last Thursday because of a sore left hand, although the Phillies seem to think he will play before the end of the weekend in Miami. Nick Castellanos served as the DH on Wednesday after getting drilled in the left leg on Tuesday.

Other players are banged up, too.

It’s that time of year, Harper said.

“That’s the name of the game, having really good players, but making sure those players stay on the field,” said Kyle Schwarber, who hit a leadoff homer in the first inning. “It’s been a grind, obviously, for Harp, getting hit and not feeling his best. But he’s doing such a great job for us, going out there and stepping up every day. You see Casty playing every single game. J.T. [Realmuto] has been doing a great job. [Garrett Stubbs] and everybody stepped up when he was down. Everyone is doing a good job of taking care of themselves and making sure that we’re going to get to the place that we want to be.”
