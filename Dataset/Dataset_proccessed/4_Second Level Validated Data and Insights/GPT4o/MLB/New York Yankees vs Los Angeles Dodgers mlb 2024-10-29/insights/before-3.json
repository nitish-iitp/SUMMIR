        "David Cone had this to say about dealing with the situation prior to the game: 'My mindset was just to avoid the big inning early and give us a chance to get a lead. Normal thoughts you have every game, but you realize every pitch is much more magnified. How you handle that kind of pressure is something you have to experience to appreciate. Once you get out there, you understand what it\u2019s all about.'"

        "Clarke Schmidt said, 'Obviously, I didn\u2019t do my job tonight.'",
        "David Cone noted Schmidt\u2019s confidence, saying, 'There\u2019s a reason why he was a first-round pick by the Yankees. He was a Friday night pitcher and he\u2019s been in big spots, but there\u2019s nothing like a World Series. He\u2019s as ready as he can be. Now it\u2019s up to him.'"
