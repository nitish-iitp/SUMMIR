        "The Dodgers are optimistic that Shohei Ohtani will be back in the lineup for Game 3.",
        "Ohtani's injury is to the back shoulder in his swing, which should cause him fewer problems than if it had been his lead right shoulder.",
        "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts compared Ohtani's injury to the dislocated shoulder former Dodgers outfielder Cody Bellinger played through in the 2020 World Series.",
        "Roberts noted that even if Ohtani isn\u2019t 100%, his presence in the leadoff spot alone should benefit the Dodgers.",
        "Yankees Game 3 starter Clarke Schmidt will know that Shohei\u2019s in the box, which Roberts argued means everything."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Roberts said postgame strength and range-of-motion tests on Ohtani\u2019s shoulder were good, and the team was encouraged about his status.",
        "Roberts does not believe that Ohtani would be risking further injury if he plays in Game 3.",
        "Ohtani has remained one of the most dangerous presences in the Dodgers lineup this October, batting .260 in his first career postseason with three home runs, 10 RBIs and 12 walks."
