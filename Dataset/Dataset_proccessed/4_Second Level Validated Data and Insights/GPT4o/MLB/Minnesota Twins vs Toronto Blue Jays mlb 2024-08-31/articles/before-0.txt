Toronto Blue Jays vs Minnesota Twins Prediction 

Minnesota was able to pick up a much-needed win in game one of this series and they will look to make it two in a row here. The Twins are 38-29 at home this year, while the Blue Jays are just 32-38 on the road. Toronto is last in the AL East standings, but they have played decently well over the last two weeks. Toronto is playing the better baseball right now and I like how Berrios has looked in his last four starts, so give me the Blue Jays on the road here.
