Dodgers win 2024 World Series

It’s all over.

Dodgers vs. Yankees. Los Angeles vs. New York. Shohei Ohtani vs. Aaron Judge.

The Dodgers came back against Yankees ace Gerrit Cole and capitalized on several defensive miscues to win Game 5, 7-6, and capture their eighth World Series championship. A Mookie Betts sacrifice fly in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium Wednesday night ensured the Dodgers would not become the first team to blow a three-games-to-none World Series lead.

If the Dodgers felt in any way short-changed by their shortened-season title in 2020, there will be no doubting this one. The best team in baseball this regular season is also its champion in 2024.

While Judge robbed Freddie Freeman of extra bases with a sensational catch early in Game 5, Freeman’s two-run single in the Dodgers’ five-run fifth gave him 12 RBIs in the series, tying the Yankees’ Bobby Richardson in 1960 for the World Series record. Freeman, now a two-time World Series champion, was named series MVP. He homered four times, including a Game 1 walk-off grand slam, and set a record by homering in six consecutive World Series games dating to 2021.

Betts is a three-time champ. Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have their first ring.

But this World Series was a rollercoaster ride to the finish.

The Yankees authored a dream start to Game 5. Cole was tactical in a seven-pitch first inning. Judge announced his arrival this World Series by walloping the first pitch he saw for a two-run home run, his first extra-base hit in 13 days. Then Jazz Chisholm Jr. went back-to-back with a mile-high solo shot into the right-field seats. Yankee Stadium shook.

Dodgers starter Jack Flaherty lasted just four outs, departing after Alex Verdugo’s RBI single in the second. In the third, Giancarlo Stanton homered for the seventh time this postseason — a Yankees record — to push the lead to five runs. Cole was cooking. The Yanks were in command.

All of that was rendered more or less moot in the fifth inning when the Yankees learned the cost of gifting the Dodgers three extra outs.

What earlier had been Judge crashing into the center-field wall to steal extra bases turned into Judge dropping a routine fly ball. What had been a Cy Young winner cruising, cool, confident, unbothered, devolved into an ace shaken and sweating and searching for an out. What had been a nascent no-hit bid became a five-run, three-blunder, 38-pitch inning. What had been a 5-0 lead was now a 5-5 tie. The Yankees defense failed Cole in the fifth inning, but he did his part in that, as he declined to cover the bag on a squibber to first baseman Anthony Rizzo.

Somewhere, Tom Emanski watched in horror.

The Dodgers, however, did not yet occupy the driver’s seat. After leaving the bases loaded in the fifth, the Yankees went ahead again in the sixth with Stanton’s sacrifice fly.

Improbably, Cole continued into the seventh. He threw 108 pitches over 6 2/3 innings, allowing five runs, none earned, on four walks and four hits.

But the taxed Yankees bullpen could not protect the lead. Needing six more outs, manager Aaron Boone called upon reliever Tommy Kahnle. Two singles and a walk later, Boone was motioning for closer Luke Weaver to put out a fire. In the previous no-out, bases-loaded scenario in the fifth, Gavin Lux struck out. This time, he lifted a sacrifice fly to center field. Then, after a slumping Ohtani reached base on catcher’s interference, Betts hit a sacrifice fly of his own, then ran down the line pumping his fist as the go-ahead run scored.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts granted reliever Blake Treinen a second inning of work in the eighth, and even stuck with him after Judge doubled and Chisholm walked. Treinen repaid that trust, inducing a weak fly ball from Stanton and striking out Rizzo with a nasty sweeper. Treinen flexed, pointed two index fingers to the sky and walked off, spent, after 42 pitches.

Walker Buehler, the Dodgers’ hero of postseason pasts, came out of the bullpen for the ninth inning. He struck out Verdugo for the final out, and the celebration commenced.

Game 5's most valuable player

Blake Treinen

For the series, the MVP was Freddie Freeman. But for the night, there was no one more valuable than Treinen.

The Dodgers’ offensive burden was shared among many — Freeman, Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernández each drove in two runs, Kiké Hernández and Tommy Edman each scored two — but Treinen’s work out of the bullpen was a singular effort.

“Blake’s our guy,” manager Dave Roberts said during the postgame trophy presentation. “Blake’s been our guy.”

The veteran closer threw a season-high 42 pitches — he’d only once thrown more than 26 in the regular season — and gave the Dodgers 2 1/3 scoreless innings on a night when their pitching staff was stretched beyond its limits by starter Jack Flaherty’s brief outing that ended after just four outs.

Treinen was at his usual limit, just over 20 pitches, when he got through the meat of the Yankees lineup in the bottom of the eighth, easing the burden on Walker Buehler, who came out of the pen — two days after starting Game 3 — to get the save in the bottom of the ninth.

Just a tremendous performance by Treinen, who gave the Dodgers more than they could have asked for, which was everything they needed.

Game 5's least valuable player

Tommy Kahnle

If you wander over to Baseball Savant’s wild win probability graph for Game 5, you’ll see that the biggest swings in win probability came on Aaron Judge’s first-inning homer and Teoscar Hernández’s tying double in the fifth. That makes sense.

What also tracks: Three of the 10 most influential plays tonight, by win probability change, began with the baseball in Kahnle’s right hand. Kiké Hernández’s leadoff single stung (8.8 percent change). Tommy Edman’s infield single seriously hurt (12.1 percent). And walking Will Smith on four pitches (16.6 percent), well, that was basically ballgame.

The Yankees had already turned one bases-loaded, no-out jam into a proper mess. There was little reason to believe they’d be able to walk away from this one still holding a one-run lead.

Indeed, after Kahnle departed, two sacrifice flies put the Dodgers ahead for good.

Before that inning, Kahnle hadn’t given up an earned run this postseason. His changeup was so wicked, so delightful that John Smoltz on the Fox broadcast requested a changeup counter on the screen. But in the eighth inning a combination of rotten command and over-reliance on the changeup led directly to the Dodgers putting the series to bed.

What will we learn about Ohtani's injury?

Getty Images

I’ll be curious to see what sort of information Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers will reveal about the extent of his shoulder injury. Because, if one may be frank, there are two things here that are worth saying:

It’s astonishing Ohtani played at all after partially dislocating his shoulder in Game 2.
He had an awful World Series!

Ohtani went 0-for-4 in Game 5, bringing his World Series line to 2-for-19 (.105) with a single, double, hit-by-pitch and two walks. He was entirely ineffective as the Dodgers leadoff man in this series. In the end, it didn’t matter. And it’s a wonderful story that, after enduring six playoff-less seasons with the Angels, he gutted through a painful injury to win a World Series in his first postseason shot with the Dodgers. But, now that the games are done, Ohtani may be more willing to disclose just how limited he was in the final three games of the World Series.

Pivotal moment No. 2: Roberts sticks with Treinen

Getty Images

Dave Roberts had Walker Buehler hot and ready when he went to the mound to visit Blake Treinen after the Dodgers right-hander walked Jazz Chisholm Jr. with one out in the eighth inning, the Dodgers trying to hold onto a one-run lead for the title.

Treinen had already thrown 37 pitches, his most since throwing 39 in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Padres. The Dodgers had already used all of their leverage relievers and Buehler, on his day to throw a side session, was Roberts’ last resort.

Treinen had entered the game with two outs in the sixth inning with the Yankees having just taken the lead. After a 1-2-3 seventh by the Dodger reliever, his teammates gave him the lead into the bottom of the eighth.

After getting Soto to ground out for the first out of the eighth, he gave up a double to Aaron Judge and walked Chisholm, bringing Roberts to the mound.

“I just wanted to look in Blake’s eyes. Blake’s our guy. Blake’s been our guy. I just wanted to slow the game down a little bit,” Roberts said in his postgame interview on Fox. “I looked in his eyes, I said, ‘how you feeling? How much more you got?’

“He said, ‘I want it.’ I trusted him.”

Roberts made the right choice.

Giancarlo Stanton popped up to Mookie Betts on Treinen’s first pitch after Roberts’ visit and then Anthony Rizzo struck out on four pitches, ending the inning and leaving the bottom of the order for Buehler and a World Series title.

Pivotal moment No. 1: Yankees melt down in fifth

Getty Images

Costly fifth-inning mistakes open the door for a Dodgers comeback.

Aaron Judge had not made an error all season until the fifth inning of World Series Game 5. That’s when he dropped a lazy liner from Tommy Edman that also allowed Enrique Hernández to reach second base with nobody out.

On Halloween eve, the Yankees' fifth-inning house of horrors was just beginning.

Will Smith was the ensuing batter. Smith grounded to shortstop Anthony Volpe, who fielded the ball but spiked a throw to third base trying to cut down the lead runner. Everyone was safe on the second error of the inning.

With the bases loaded, Yankees ace Gerrit Cole responded with his best stuff of the evening to strike out Gavin Lux and Shohei Ohtani. It seemed Cole had completed a mesmerizing escape when Mookie Betts then hit a weak chopper to Anthony Rizzo at first base. Betts, though, hustled down the line. The ball took Rizzo just far enough from the bag that he could not complete the play himself. As Betts sprinted and touched the base with his left foot, Cole was frozen on the infield, failing to cover first in an inexplicable blunder. The Dodgers scored a run and still had the bases loaded. The rest is history: a Freddie Freeman single that scored two, then a Teoscar Hernández double that brought home two more and tied the game.

A five-run New York lead was gone in what felt like both an instant and an eon.

There was plenty more drama ahead, but none of it would have existed had the Yankees avoided a run of colossal mistakes that ultimately unraveled their championship dreams.

Your views on the Dodgers winning the World Series

Getty Images

Scotty P.: This fifth might be the most embarrassing inning I’ve ever witnessed in a World Series game. It’s inexcusable. Simply inexcusable. And Boone will do nothing.

William L.: You actually can’t call what the Dodgers did today a comeback. It was more like a GIVEBACK by NYY! Yanks crumpled. Threw up all over themselves.

Marcelo T.: People have said it this year, but Dave Roberts put ALL of his critics to rest with this entire postseason. Not just by winning, but by showing real growth, real adjustments and changing his tactics accordingly. He did things differently, managing injuries, pitcher fatigue, egos, everything, with absolute precision.

Alexwhitman.99: Hurts to watch as a Yankees fan, but an extremely well-played game by the Dodgers. Wish I could say the same for the Yankees defense in that brutal fifth inning, and all the mistakes after. Oh well, just a matter of replacing Boone.

Mark A.: Respect to the Yankees. They gave it all they had. Dodgers just had too much and never quit. Looking forward to the PARADE!!!!

A-Rod on fifth inning: 'One of the greatest meltdowns that I’ve ever seen'

The Yankees’ fifth-inning defensive blunders were a grisly sight for even a neutral party.

Derek Jeter does not claim to be a neutral party. And, on the Fox postgame broadcast, he admitted being baffled by that display.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever quite seen an inning like this, especially in a World Series or postseason game,” Jeter said. “Look, the Yankees made some mistakes. You can’t make mistakes against a team like the Los Angeles Dodgers. That particular inning, you gave them six outs.”

Alex Rodríguez added: “This is one of the greatest meltdowns that I’ve ever seen in 40 years.”

Dodgers win their 8th World Series title

Getty Images

The Los Angeles Dodgers have captured their eighth World Series championship, their first since 2020 and their first following a 162-game season since 1988.

1955: Dodgers over Yankees in 7

After being defeated by the Yankees in the World Series four times in a span of eight years, the Dodgers finally broke through in a series best remembered for Jackie Robinson’s steal of home. Johnny Podres was the MVP — the first time the award was ever given — after pitching a shutout in Game 7. It was the Dodgers’ only championship in Brooklyn. They moved to Los Angeles two years later.

1959: Dodgers over White Sox in 6

The first west coast World Series drew a record 92,706 fans to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for Game 5. Dodgers reliever Larry Sherry got two wins and two saves and was named series MVP.

1963: Dodgers over Yankees in 4

It’s fitting that the only Dodgers championship clinched at home was the first World Series ever played at Dodger Stadium. Sandy Koufax struck out 15 to beat Whitey Ford in Game 1, and the two had a rematch in Game 4 with Koufax pitching a complete game for a 2-1 Dodgers victory.

1965: Dodgers over Twins in 7

Koufax didn’t start Game 1 because it fell on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, but he would still start three games, including a shutout in the clincher on two days' rest. The Dodgers would return to the World Series the next year but were swept by the Orioles, and Koufax retired after the series.

1981: Dodgers over Yankees in 6

The Dodgers had lost to the Yankees in 1977 and 1978, and they lost the first two games of this series at Yankee Stadium. To get back in it, the Dodgers won three straight one-run games at home, and after finishing the series in New York, three Dodgers — Ron Cey, Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager — shared the MVP.

1988: Dodgers over A’s in 5

“In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened!” This was the last World Series legendary Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully called on TV, and he delivered one of his greatest lines when Kirk Gibson hit a walk-off, pinch-hit home run off Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley in Game 1. Orel Hershiser pitched a shutout in Game 2 and a complete game in Game 5.

2020: Dodgers over Rays in 6

After a 60-game regular season, the Dodgers played four rounds of an expanded playoff format to win their first championship in more than 30 years. The entire series was held at the Texas Rangers’ Globe Life Field, and Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager was named MVP after hitting .400 with two homers.

Reviewing our Dodgers keys to victory

Don’t let ‘em get ahead ❌

This was, instead, the key to a whole lotta shaky nerves in Los Angles tonight. Aaron Judge cracked a two-run homer in the first inning, Jazz Chisholm Jr. went back-to-back, and then the Yankees added on two more soon after. Jack Flaherty only got four outs. This was not the script! But with a lineup as relentless as the Dodgers’, and with the generosity of the Yankees defense in the fifth inning, a comeback was in the cards in Game 5.

Get to the Yankees bullpen ✅

I meant this more in a “chase Gerrit Cole early” way. The Dodgers didn’t do that. But they certainly got to the bullpen once Yankees manager Aaron Boone took the baseball from Cole. Tommy Kahnle and his changeup were a delightful circus act for most of this series. But the Dodgers were all over it in Game 5. Kiké Hernández smacked a single. Tommy Edman got an infield hit. Will Smith walked. Then all it took from there was a couple sacrifice flies against Yankees closer Luke Weaver, who was clearly toast by the end of his outing. We’ll put this game in the evidence file to show high-leverage relievers getting over-exposed in a series.

Score the most runs ✅

Boy, the noise would have gotten real loud if the Yankees had sent the series back to Los Angeles. But now only one bird is headed back to the West Coast. And there’s a party on board.

Gerrit Cole ✅

Cole seemed to be the biggest difference maker in this game, and that’s exactly what he was. Take away that brutal fifth inning — more on that in a bit — and Cole might have been good enough to get through eight innings. As it was, he settled for 6 2/3 innings with no earned runs. Four walks and one failure to cover first base were his biggest mistakes, but Cole absolutely did his part to give the Yankees a chance.

Minimize the damage ❌

For one brutal inning, the Dodgers did everything they could to maximize the damage. A dropped fly ball was Aaron Judge’s first error of the year, a throw in the dirt was Anthony Volpe’s low point in an otherwise good series, and Cole’s failure to cover first base was almost certainly his biggest mistake of the night. The Yankees gifted the Dodgers five unearned runs in the fifth, and then a catcher's interference helped set the stage for their two-run rally in the eighth.

Savages in the box ❌

This key was about a complete offensive effort, one that didn’t rely strictly on Judge, Juan Soto or Giancarlo Stanton doing all of the damage. Well, Judge and Stanton homered — so did Jazz Chisholm Jr. — and those three drove in five of the six Yankees runs. The team went 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position and couldn’t finish off a Dodgers team that trailed by five in the fifth inning and basically ran out of relievers at the end of the eighth.

Freeman joins Dodgers World Series MVPs

Getty Images

Freddie Freeman has been named World Series MVP. He homered in the first four games of the series, setting a record by homering in six consecutive World Series games dating to 2021. He matched another record by driving in 12 runs, tying 1960 Bobby Richardson for most RBI in a World Series. (Richardson got seven games, and his team lost. Freeman got five.)

Here are the MVPs from the Dodgers’ previous seven World Series:

1955: SP Johnny Podres

Podres pitched two complete games against the Yankees, allowing three runs (two earned) in Game 3 and then returning in Game 7 with an eight-hit shutout. Gil Hodges drove in the only two runs of the Dodgers’ Game 7 win, but Podres went home with the hardware.

1959: RP Larry Sherry

The Dodgers rookie tossed 12 2/3 innings of one-run baseball against the White Sox. After multi-inning saves in Games 2 and 3, Sherry won Games 4 and 6. He relieved Podres in the fourth inning of Game 6 and finished the game, 5 2/3 scoreless to secure a World Series title.

1963: SP Sandy Koufax

Koufax punched out 15 and held the Yankees to two runs in a Game 1 complete game. Then, with the Dodgers up three games to none in the series (sound familiar?), Koufax again went the distance, striking out eight over nine innings of one-run ball to sweep the Yanks.

1965: Koufax

Another legendary Koufax performance. Three starts, 24 innings, 29 strikeouts and one earned run. After declining to pitch Game 1 on Yom Kippur, Koufax allowed two runs (one earned) over six innings in a Game 2 loss against the Twins. He then turned in matching 10-strikeout complete games in Games 5 and 7 — the latter on two days’ rest.

1981: 3B Ron Cey, OF Pedro Guerrero and C Steve Yeager

For the first time, co-World Series MVPs. Cey went 7-for-20 with a homer and as many walks (three) as strikeouts (three). Guerrero rebounded from 0-fers in Games 1 and 2 to go 7-for-12 with four extra-base hits. He and Yeager went back-to-back in Game 5 to erase a Yankees lead. Yeager was 4-for-14 with a double and two homers in the series.

1988: SP Orel Hershiser

If you asked many baseball fans, I’m guessing half would assume Kirk Gibson won this one. Who cares if he took only one swing? We still talk about that swing! But Hershiser capped his incredible 1988 season by pitching 24 2/3 (!) innings in the NLCS, then tossing two complete games in the World Series: 18 innings, two runs on seven hits, and six walks to 17 strikeouts.

2020: SS Corey Seager

Seager won his first of two World Series MVPs by slashing .400/.556/.700 for the Dodgers against the Rays. After already capturing the NLCS MVP trophy, Seager scored seven runs, hit two homers and had five RBIs in the World Series. Seager won another World Series MVP last season with the Texas Rangers.
