Texas Rangers playing ‘loose and free,’ accomplishing goal of finishing 2024 strong
As the Rangers look toward 2025, they’re playing their best baseball of the 2024 season.

ARLINGTON — The Texas Rangers, if you haven’t heard by now, are trying to squeeze a boatload of checkpoints into the final month of the regular season. They want to finish strong. They want to see what they have in their younger players. They want to give their injured veterans a chance to compete before the winter. They want to set a foundation that can carry into next season.

So, with accountability in mind, there’s reason to reflect one goal that the Rangers set for themselves when it became increasingly clear that the postseason was an unlikely endeavor.

Here’s Andrew Heaney, on Aug. 21, when the Rangers were double-digit games under .500 and double-digit games back of first place in the American League West: “I’m hoping that guys will just kind of play loose and free at the end if we’re all just — I mean, I guess we’re not officially eliminated, right? Maybe we’ll go win some games.”

Here’s Heaney again, on Sunday, after a 7-4 win vs. the Los Angeles Angels at Globe Life Field that pulled the Rangers to within striking distance of a .500 record: “When you play well, the looseness happens. When you’re loose, the winning continues.”

The winning has continued at a rate the Rangers haven’t seen this season. They won three of four games vs the Angels, claimed their first seven-win homestand in Globe Life Field history, have won four consecutive series and have 10 wins in a 13-game stretch for the first time since last year.

It’s mathematically the best stretch of baseball that Texas has played in an otherwise disappointing World Series defense season.

Has it felt like their best stretch of baseball this season?

“I think, overall, yeah,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “I’ll go with that.”

And, to Heaney’s point, are they loose?

“Anytime you’re scoring runs and hitting the ball out of the ballpark,” said Marcus Semien, whose leadoff home run in Sunday’s game charged a three-run first inning, “I think it kind of loosens you up.”

Sunday’s win encompassed what Texas looks like at its best and, possibly, loosest. The Rangers scored early with two first-inning home runs from Semien and Nathaniel Lowe. They got six quality innings from Heaney. They tacked on late insurance — as has been their penchant lately — with two runs in the bottom of the eighth inning courtesy of a Travis Jankowski single and a Los Angeles error. Their back-end bullpen duo of David Robertson and Kirby Yates worked scoreless innings again in the eighth and ninth.

Now, the kicker: It’s awfully late. The Rangers’ 10-3 record in their last 13 games is the best in the American League; they’ve only improved their standing in the AL West by two games during it and still trail the first-place Houston Astros by eight with 18 to play. The wild card race — in which they trail Minnesota by 6½ games for the third and final berth — is suddenly a more realistic last-ditch initiative. That route into the postseason, still, would require a herculean effort.

The remainder of this season is focused on next season for all intents and purposes anyways. Heaney’s original call-for-looseness was built on the foundation of giving the Rangers “something to kind of hold onto next year.” He’s seen the vibes improve across the board. He’s got a theory — and comparison — he’d like to offer too.

“One of my biggest pet peeves is when people say that when things aren’t working well for me on the mound, ‘Oh he’s working slow, it looks like he’s laboring,’” Heaney said. “There’s runners on base, of course I’m going slower, I’ve got to shake, I’ve got to come set, I’ve got to check runners. That takes longer, of course I’m taking longer.”

Bear with him.

“It’s kind of the same thing [in regards to looseness],” Heaney continued. “When you see a team that’s potentially not scoring runs, not winning games, ‘Oh, the energy’s not there, the effort’s not there.’ You’re looking at it, and you’re saying that. Well, what the hell do you want me to cheer about? We have one hit through six innings, I’m doing my best to be a supporter. ... It just feels a little different because we’re winning more games. Inherently you’re going to have guys that are happier and looser.”

It might fringe on the territory of moral victories. It could in turn deliver on-field victories.
