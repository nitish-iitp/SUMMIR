The Los Angeles Angels and the Texas Rangers square off Sunday in MLB action from Globe Life Park. We will look at this from a betting perspective and determine the best bets for this game. Here’s a Los Angeles Angels vs. Texas Rangers prediction.

Starting Pitching Matchup

The Los Angeles Angels will send out Caden Dana for the start here and Dana is 1-0 with a 3.00 ERA and 4 strikeouts this season. This will be Dana’s first career start against the Rangers. The Texas Rangers will start Andrew Heaney here and Heaney is 4-13 with a 3.81 ERA and 141 strikeouts this season. In his career, Heaney is 0-1 with a 3.68 ERA and 10 strikeouts against the Angels.

Los Angeles Angels Recap

The Los Angeles Angels will try to salvage a split from the series after a 6-4 loss to the Rangers in Saturday’s matchup. The loss meant that the Angels could get a split at best, and that would follow another split in a two-game series with the Dodgers from last week.

Why the Los Angeles Angels will win

Texas Rangers Recap

The Texas Rangers will try to win the series after their victory in Saturday’s matchup to take a series lead heading into the final game. A series win would keep the Rangers’ playoff hops going after series wins over the Yankees, A’s and White Sox over the last two weeks.

Marcus Semien leads the Rangers with 135 hits along with 25 doubles, 18 home runs and 65 RBIs while Adolis Garcia has 22 home runs and 73 RBIs with 24 doubles as well as 11 stolen bases.

Wyatt Langford’s also chipped in 21 doubles, a team-high 4 triples, 10 homers, 63 RBIs and 12 stolen bases.

Why the Texas Rangers will win
The Angels have lost nine of their last 10 games against teams that held a losing record.
The Rangers have won seven of their last eight day games at Globe Life Field following a win.
The Angels have failed to cover the run line in 12 of their last 15 games against teams that held a losing record.
The Rangers have covered the run line in four of their last five games.
Angels vs. Rangers Prediction

Give me the Rangers here. I’m not in love with this matchup, and the Angels send out Dana for his second career start in this one. The Rangers are tearing the cover off of the ball against righties right now and I think Dana could be in some trouble. Heaney’s pitched a lot better than I give him credit for this season and I think the Rangers get the series W here. Give me the Rangers.
