13 SECONDS REMAINING

ARLINGTON -- Entering Sunday’s matchup with the Angels, Andrew Heaney had received two-or-fewer runs of support in seven straight starts and in 18 of his 27 starts. His team-low 3.55 run support average was the fifth-lowest mark in the American League (min. 130 IP).

But before Heaney could even blink, the Rangers scored five runs in the first two innings on Sunday afternoon, chasing Angels starter Caden Dana out of the game with no outs in the second inning. It’s a good thing they did, too, since it was just enough runs for Texas to pull out a 7-4 win over the Halos to complete a series win at Globe Life Field.

Heaney’s five runs of support from the Rangers’ offense eclipsed his run support total from his last seven starts combined (four runs).

“I was very happy, I was probably jumping up and down in the dugout, being kind of a clown,” Heaney joked. “But yeah, I was very happy about that. Happy for those guys. I know it's not intentional. I know those guys aren't having a meeting like, ‘Hey, don't forget, Andrew’s on the mound, don’t score.’ I know that. I know it's been trying for them. I've had very trying seasons. I know how frustrating that can be. So just for those guys to come out and score some runs early and kind of loosen up was nice.”

The Rangers have now won four straight series, prevailing over the White Sox, A's, Yankees and Angels. It matched their longest run in 2024, when they took series over the Reds, Nationals, Royals and A’s from April 26-May 8.

Texas is 10-3 since Aug. 28, marking the club's best 13-game stretch since Aug. 3-16, 2023 (also 10-3). Heaney said he feels the team is playing more loose and free over the past few weeks. That comes with the territory of winning ballgames.

“One of my biggest pet peeves is when people … see a team that's potentially not scoring runs, not winning games, they say ‘Oh, the energy's not there, the effort isn't there,’” Heaney said. “But what the hell do you want me to cheer about? The game is just hard.

“So I think when you play well, the looseness happens. When you're loose, the winning continues. It’s a little bit of chicken and the egg, but I think our guys are doing the exact same thing they've been all year. It just feels a little different because we're winning more games, and inherently, you're going to have guys that are happier and looser.”

As for Heaney individually, he collected his first win since July 21 against the Orioles.

Heaney also has a career-high 13 losses in 2024, which is tied for the second-most in MLB (14, Chris Flexen). The last time a Rangers pitcher had 13 losses in a season was Jordan Lyles in 2021, but he had a 5.15 ERA to go along with his 10-13 record. Heaney is now 5-13 with a 3.84 ERA after Sunday’s win.

“He's pitching so much better than his record,” said Marcus Semien, who had a pair of RBIs in the win. “This [might] actually [be] a career year for him, if you look at what he's been doing for us and staying healthy. I feel bad for him when he looks at his record. But I also feel really good for him.”

Before the game, manager Bruce Bochy praised Heaney for his consistency and being able to make his starts.

Throughout Heaney’s two seasons with the Rangers, he has not spent time on the injured list. He only made 25-plus starts once in his career prior to joining Texas, in 2018 with the Angels. He’s done so in both seasons with Texas, as he’s made more starts than any other Rangers pitcher between 2023-24.

“Sometimes your body just gives out,” Heaney said. “That's just the nature of sports. Harder-working guys don't always have health on their side. It can be frustrating. I’m not gonna sit here and say I'm the hardest working guy, but I think I work pretty hard. I feel good about what I do and take pride in the ability to go out there and to take the ball [about] every fifth day.

“On top of that, you also want to pitch well. I think that this year has kind of been a combination of that. I am proud. I am happy to do that. As a guy who's more of a role player, I know who I am. That's what you need to do to be successful and help the team win.”
