Marlins Fell Short

The Marlins on Tuesday fell short again. The Marlins offense scored four runs but it wasn’t enough as the pitching gave up six runs. Adam Oller went five innings seven hits and six runs. In this game, if the Marlins want to find success they are going to need the pitching to be better. 

The Marlins are averaging 3.83 runs while their pitching is giving up 5.17 runs per game. The offense is ranked 29th in the league while the pitching is ranked 28th. They have a negative run differential of -1.34 which is 28th. Jake Burger has hit 25 home runs and driven in 60 RBIs. The Marlins will face the Nats and Dodgers following this series.

Why the Marlins Will Beat the Pirates
The Pirates have lost eight of their last nine-day games at PNC Park following a win.
The Marlins have won each of their last five-day games after playing the previous day.
The Pirates have failed to cover the run line in eight of their last nine home games against National League opponents following a win.
The Marlins have covered the run line in six of their last seven-day games against National League opponents.
Pirates' Offense Was Strong

The Pirates offense was strong scoring six runs and that was enough for the victory. Andrew McCutchen had a strong game hitting a home run and driving in three RBIs. Bryan Reynolds finished with two hits and drove in one RBI. 

The Pirates are averaging 4.24 runs per game while their pitching is giving up 4.58 runs per game. The offense is ranked 17th in the league while the pitching is ranked 20th. Bryan Reynolds has hit 22 home runs and driven 83 RBIs so far this season. Getting the start for the Pirates will be Bailey Falter who sits with a 7-7 record and an ERA of 4.45. In his last start against the Washington Nationals, he went five innings giving up seven hits and three runs. 

Miami Marlins vs Pittsburgh Pirates Prediction

Bailey Falter went only five innings in his last start and he gave up seven hits and he’s going to really struggle again here. The Marlins are averaging 3.83 runs per game and they are going to have no issue here. I don’t think the Pirates' offense is going to find a whole lot of success here, and it’s going to be the Marlins that are going to get the job done. Back the Marlins on the money line to cash here.
