PHILADELPHIA - The Mets stunned the Phillies in Game 1 of the National League Division Series on Saturday, scoring five runs in the eighth inning and coming away with a 6-1 victory.

They knocked the Phillies down several times with decisive blows - two home runs by Mark Vientos and another by Pete Alonso - on Sunday, but the Phillies kept getting off the mat and punched back with Nick Castellanos’ walk-off single giving them a 7-6 win.

The series between the two geographical and National League East rivals will resume in New York on Tuesday afternoon tied at 1 in the best-of-5 format.

“Definitely an emotional roller coaster of a game. so many ups and down,” said Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto. “We didn’t start off hot, didn’t look good for a while. Big homer from Bryce (Harper), big homer from Casty. Then they take the lead again. Multiple times you felt good and other times you didn’t feel great about your chances. Seemed to happen quickly .... Glad we came out on top.”

The 2024 Mets continue to have so many 2022 Phillies vibes, it’s like they are twins. Both teams rallied in the second half of the season after slow starts.

That Phillies’ team finished the season on a long road trip, then had to play on the road for the entire first round and start of the second. The 2022 Phillies had a huge ninth-inning comeback in its first playoff game and stayed hot.

The Mets - who have been on the road for a while and have come back to win games at the end of the regular season, in the division series and in both games this series have shown just as much spunk, if not more..

Asked if he has a weird kind of respect for the Mets, Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto said he did, except for the weird part.

“I wouldn’t call it weird, I have respect for those guys over there,” said Realmuto. “They’re a really good ballclub, and they don’t quit. The whole second half they just grinded out (at-bats). They seem to get better in the later innings with their ABs. They do better off bullpen pitchers which is honestly hard to do.”

“When you’re playing a team that good that is as hot as they are over there you have to do it to the last out. That game had the most up and down lead changes I can remember, it was pretty wild.”

The respect is mutual. While lamenting the missed opportunity, Mets manager Carlos Mendoza noted it was because of the Phillies’ talent and perseverance that the series is heading to New York tied.

“That’s a really good team and you saw it today,” said Mendoza. “They got down, it was 3-0, and it seems like we took the crowd away and before you know it, they got back and tied the game. They continued to fight.”

Now the series moves to New York, which could have an atmosphere that rivals what has become known as the most raucous in baseball at Citizens Bank Park.
