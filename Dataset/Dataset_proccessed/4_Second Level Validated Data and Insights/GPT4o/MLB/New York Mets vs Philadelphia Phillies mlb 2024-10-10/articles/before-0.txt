Jose Quintana has pitched 11 innings in two clinching games this postseason and allowed zero earned runs. 

The Mets could not possibly ask for more from a potential free agent who is pitching as if he does not want this season and possibly his Mets tenure to end — and ensuring just that. 

Quintana was nails again, holding the Phillies to one unearned run in five innings of the Game 4, 4-1 win at Citi Field that sent the Mets into the NLCS for the first time since 2015.

Dating back to his 2022 start with the Cardinals, big-game Quintana has not allowed an earned run in three consecutive postseason starts, which is tied for the second-longest such streak in postseason history. 

“I always think: Just go out there and do my job,” Quintana said after baffling the Phillies for five innings without touching 93 mph once. “During the postseason, I’m always telling our guys it’s a lot of energy … don’t let the energy push you too much. Just focus on one pitch at a time.”

The veteran lefty, who held an ERA that started with a “5” in mid-June and recovered to crack the postseason rotation, has been more and more dominant as the year has gone on, allowing two runs in 25 innings in September to earn the ball in a win-or-go-home game in the wild-card series. 

After dealing for six scoreless innings in the Game 3 win in Milwaukee, Quintana lasted five-plus frames Wednesday and held the powerful Phillies offense in check. He left trailing by one, but Francisco Lindor’s sixth-inning grand slam ensured Quintana would not be the hard-luck loser. 

“When the team needs you, for me to be here and do my job and feel confident with all my stuff, it’s amazing,” Quintana said. “Against a great lineup — they dominated all year.” 

The 35-year-old excelled for five strong innings in which he let up two hits — a double to Nick Castellanos that hurt and a sixth-inning double to Bryce Harper that did not — and only was done in by a misplay by Mark Vientos.

His only real bit of trouble arrived in a scoreless game in the fourth. Quintana pitched around Harper, who walked on five pitches, before Castellanos’ double put two in scoring position.

Alec Bohm hit a slow chopper to Vientos, who had a play at home but bobbled the ball and couldn’t get anyone out on the play as the Phillies took the lead. 

But Quintana ensured that would be the only run the Phillies would get. With runners on the corners, J.T. Realmuto flied out to shallow right field before a lazy fly from Bryson Stott ended the trouble.

Quintana was lifted with a runner on in the sixth that Reed Garrett and David Peterson stranded.

From the trainer’s room, Quintana jumped up in excitement when he watched Lindor swing the Mets into the NLCS.

The Mets will not die, and Quintana has been on the mound in the games in which they have assured further life. 

“I’m really glad to be a part of this group,” Quintana said.
