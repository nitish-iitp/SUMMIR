Cubs Have Issues

The Cubs have already been eliminated from the playoffs and on Monday they scored only two runs on the way to the defeat. Mike Tauhman finished with one hit and one RBI. The Cubs are averaging 4.57 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.15 runs per game. The offense is ranked 13th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 12th. They do have a positive run differential of 0.43 runs per game, which is 13th in the league. Ian Happ has hit 25 home runs and driven in 85 RBIs so far this season. Getting the start for the Cubs will be Justin Steele who sits with a 5-5 record and an ERA of 3.03. In his last appearance against Oakland, he went 2.2 innings giving up two hits and zero runs. 

Why the Cubs Will Beat the Phillies
The Phillies have lost four of their last five games following a win.
The Cubs have won each of their last three games against National League opponents following a loss.
The Phillies have failed to cover the run line in seven of their last eight games against National League opponents following a home win.
The Cubs have covered the run line in 15 of their last 20 games against the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park following a loss.
Phillies Coming off a Win

The Phillies scored six runs on Monday and that was enough for the four-run victory. Aaron Nola went six innings giving up seven hits and two runs. Kyle Schwarber hit a home run. J.T. Realmuto hit a home run and drove in two RBIs. The Phillies are averaging 4.87 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.08 runs per game. The offense is ranked 4th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 9th. Kyle Schwarber has hit 36 home runs and driven in 99 RBIs so far this season. The Phillies will meet the Nats after this series.

Chicago Cubs vs Philadelphia Phillies Prediction 

I trust Steele even against a good Phillies offense. In his last appearance, he didn’t go as deep but he still gave up zero runs and he’s going to find success in this game. He currently sits with an ERA of 3.03. The Cubs offense is averaging 4.57 runs per game and they are going to find the offensive success early in this game. The Phillies are going to have no answer. Back the Cubs on the money line.
