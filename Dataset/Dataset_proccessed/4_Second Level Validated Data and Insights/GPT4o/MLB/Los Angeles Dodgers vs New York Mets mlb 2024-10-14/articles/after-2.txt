Dodgers cruise to dominant 9-0 win over Mets in NLCS Game 1 while matching MLB postseason shutout record
The Dodgers have gone 33 postseason innings without allowing a single run

Behind a huge outing on the mound from Jack Flaherty, the Los Angeles Dodgers have taken the early jump in the National League Championship Series.

The Dodgers cruised to a shutout 9-0 win over the New York Mets on Sunday at Dodger Stadium to kick off the NLCS. That gives them a 1-0 series lead heading into Monday’s Game 2 and puts them just three wins away from reaching their first World Series since they won the title in 2020.

While the Dodgers’ offense was solid once again — Max Muncy hit a two-RBI single in the first inning to give L.A. the lead right away, Shohei Ohtani followed suit with an RBI single in the second, and then a trio of guys each hit an RBI single in the fourth to put the Dodgers up 6-0 — it was the pitching that matched a wild postseason record.

Jack Flaherty pitched seven scoreless innings and allowed just two hits while striking out six in his start on Sunday. By the time the 9-0 victory was official, the Dodgers had gone a ridiculous 33 consecutive innings without allowing a run, dating to Game 3 of the NLDS against the San Diego Padres. That matched an MLB postseason record set by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1966 World Series.

Flaherty was replaced in the eighth by Daniel Hudson, who just barely made it out of the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers added three more runs in the bottom of the inning when Mookie Betts hit a double in what was remarkably the only extra-base hit of the night. From there, the Dodgers quickly closed out the Mets in the ninth to grab the win and match the shutout record.

Jack Flaherty's night for the Dodgers is officially done. He pitched seven shutout innings and had six strikeouts in 98 pitches. Daniel Hudson is in now to relieve him in the eighth.

The Dodgers put one on base in the seventh, but the Mets survived after Jose Butto came in to pitch to close it out. We'll head to the eighth now, and the Dodgers still lead 6-0.

Make it seven scoreless innings for Jack Flaherty. The Dodgers starter pitches a 1-2-3 seventh to maintain a 6-0 Los Angeles lead. He's at 98 pitches and could see an end to his night soon.

The postseason record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched is 33 by the 1966 Baltimore Orioles. The Dodgers would tie those Orioles with a shutout tonight.

Jack Flaherty has shut the Mets out for six innings in Game 1 of the NLCS. The Dodgers have not allowed a run in 30 innings. The record for consecutive scoreless innings for a team in the postseason is Baltimore in the 1966 World Series with 33. What a run for Dodgers pitching.

The Mets fail to score in the sixth, and the Dodgers extend their scoreless innings streak to 30. Jack Flaherty has allowed two hits and two walks with six strikeouts in six scoreless innings.

Teoscar Hernandez ended the inning with a nice grab over the wall in foul territory.

With New York's scoreless fifth inning, the Dodgers have set an NL postseason record with 29 consecutive scoreless innings pitched dating to the second inning of Game 3 of the NLDS against the San Diego Padres.

The Dodgers shut out the Padres in Games 4 and 5 to clinch the series and have held the Mets off the scoreboard through five innings of the NLCS. Not bad for a staff that has been riddled with injuries.

The Mets got their first two hits off of Jack Flaherty and managed to mess that up. Jesse Winker reached on a leadoff single in the fifth, but he got caught in a rundown between second and third on a hit by Jose Iglesias. A pair of outs to the outfield then ended the inning, and the Mets remain scoreless despite consecutive hits to lead off the inning.

Dodgers still lead 6-0.

Ohtani, Dodgers pile on

The Dodgers are cruising. Tommy Edman scored Kiké Hernández on a one-out single off of David Peterson in the bottom of the fourth to increase the Los Angeles lead to 3-0.

Shohei Ohtani then smoked a line drive to the right-field wall to score Hernández. Ohtani came home on a single by Freddie Freeman to double the Dodgers' lead to 6-0 through four innings.

Jack Flaherty still perfect

Dodgers starter Jack Flaherty is perfect after his first turn through the Mets' lineup. He retired the side in the third capped by a strikeout of Francisco Alvarez. That's four strikeouts and zero baserunners allowed through three innings. Dodgers lead 3-0.

Here's a rare sight. Shoehei Ohtani was just caught trying to steal second base to end the second inning. It's the first time since July that the presumptive NL MVP was caught stealing. He was successful on his previous 36 attempts.

Kodai Senga is done

It's a short outing for Mets starter Kodai Senga. He issued a leadoff walk to Gavin Lux, who came around to score on a Shohei Ohtani single. That's a 3-0 lead for the Dodgers with one out in the bottom of the second.

Kodai Senga issued consecutive walks to Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Teoscar Hernandez, and the Dodgers made him pay. Max Muncy scored Betts and Freeman with a two-out single to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead through one inning.

How will the Mets handle Ohtani?

One big storyline to keep an eye on during the NLCS is how the Mets try to match up against Shohei Ohtani late in games. The Padres kept Ohtani quiet in the NLDS (he went 2-for-his-last 15) in large part because they could deploy dominant southpaw reliever Tanner Scott in the later innings.

The Mets have only two left-handed relievers on their roster (David Peterson and Danny Young), neither of whom is an obvious weapon against Ohtani. Young didn’t pitch in the NLDS, and Peterson was mostly used in multi-inning spurts.

Game 1 will influence Dodgers' pitching strategy for Game 2

How Game 1 goes for the Dodgers could influence their pitching strategy for Game 2. Walker Buehler is the likely Game 2 starter, but manager Dave Roberts said it could be a bullpen game with Buehler then starting Game 3.

To that end, Dave Roberts said it’s “a possibility” the Dodgers go bullpen game in Game 2, with Walker Buehler in Game 3. A lot of that still depends on usage tonight. https://t.co/Q8wPGafC6Y
