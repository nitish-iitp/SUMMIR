PHOENIX — For only the second time in franchise history, the Arizona Diamondbacks drew more than 50,000 fans for a regular season game Saturday against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Saturday’s announced attendance was 50,041, the second-largest regular season crowd at Chase Field. A game between the Diamondbacks and Dodgers on Aug. 31, 2019, brought 50,180 fans to the ballpark.

Aside from the National League West matchup draw, this weekend is Hispanic Heritage Weekend with a postgame concert Saturday from Grupo Control. Plus, Labor Day is on Monday.

The Diamondbacks-Dodgers rivalry has heated up in the past year, as Arizona knocked out Los Angeles in the NLDS last October and is fighting to stay within striking distance for the NL West entering September.

The packed crowd received quite a start to the ballgame.

Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll hit an inside-the-park home run in the first inning after back-to-back-to-back home runs from Los Angeles’ Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. The D-backs led 4-3 after one inning, and the game was tied 6-6 by the eighth.

The Dodgers took an 8-6 lead in the ninth inning and held on for the win.

“There was a lot of excitement in this building. I felt the energy,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “The fans were engaged. There were a lot of fireworks for the first two innings. … It felt like we did enough to stay in this game.”

The attendance on Friday was announced at 46,606, and after the game Josh Bell said it felt like a postseason atmosphere.

The Diamondbacks play the Dodgers two more times with games Sunday and Monday for Labor Day.
