Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani makes MLB history with 43-43 season

Home runs are regular occurrences for Shohei Ohtani, but a blast in Friday’s win over the Arizona Diamondbacks was particularly significant for the Los Angeles Dodgers star.

That’s because, with an eighth-inning homer, Ohtani became the first MLB player with 43 home runs and 43 stolen bases in the same season. His history-making, solo HR was a 380-footer off Paul Sewald, which soared to left center. It gave the Dodgers a 10-5 lead and the eventual edge in their 10-9 victory.

Ohtani achieved his 43rd stolen base in the second inning, taking second base after Diamondbacks starter Zac Gallen threw a pitch in the dirt that bounced down the third base line.

Alex Rodriguez was previously the only MLB player to reach 42 homers and 42 stolen bases in a season.

Ohtani was already the first Dodger to join the 40-40 club, achieving the feat in 126 games — the quickest in major-league history.

The two-way star is in his first season with the Dodgers after signing a record 10-year, $700 million deal. Although he’s not pitching this season, he’s invested time in learning the nuances of the running game, working closely with first-base coach Clayton McCullough.

“I think he has bought into stealing bases, understands the value of the stolen base, getting 90 feet,” manager Dave Roberts said earlier this season. “Hasn’t surprised me. I think it’s welcome for me, for him, because he’s in a pennant race now. And I don’t think he’s been in a pennant race in his big-league career. So his enhanced focus is not a surprise to me.”

Ohtani remains on pace for even higher marks. Through Friday’s win, he’s on pace for the first 50-50 season in major-league history. And with two more nights like Friday, he’ll match Rickey Henderson for the major-league record of most such games in a single season (13, in 1986).
