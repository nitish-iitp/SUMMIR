The Washington Nationals got a very nice win this afternoon led by DJ Herz‘s five scoreless innings with no hits. Dylan Crews carried the offense with a home run, double, walk, two RBIs and two runs scored. With the unexpected day-off yesterday after a rain-out in Pittsburgh, this is the second game of this afternoon/evening split-doubleheader today against the Pirates.

Based on last year’s win total of 71-games, the Nats need to go 9-12 or better to beat that total. To exceed the 66-win total from FanGraphs, the Nats need to win 4 more games. There are just 21-games remaining in the season. The team will avoid triple-digit losses which happened to be what Baseball Prospectus was projecting as they had the Nats going 58-104.

The Nats are slight underdogs today, at +120 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $100 you would win $120. Bet $10.00 and you win $12.00.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez has a doubleheader to manage which is the toughest on the bullpen. With the roster expansion, he does have a 9-man bullpen, a day-game tomorrow, and a day-off on Monday. With no game yesterday — everyone got a rest. So the Nats will have to push through this one after using Jacob Barnes, Derek Law, Robert Garcia, and Kyle Finnegan.

This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward, and the plan is to get Trevor Williams back into the rotation and finish the final week-and-a-half of the season with a 6-man rotation:

Saturday: Mitchell Parker vs. Pirates
Sunday: Patrick Corbin vs. Pirates
Monday: Day-off September 9
Tuesday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Atlanta
Wednesday: Jake Irvin vs. Atlanta
Thursday: DJ Herz vs. Marlins
Friday: Parker vs. Marlins
Saturday: Corbin vs. Marlins
Sunday: Gore vs. Marlins
Monday: Irvin vs. Mets
Tuesday: Herz vs. Mets
Wednesday: Parker vs. Mets
Thursday: Corbin vs. Cubs
Friday: Gore vs. Cubs
Saturday: Irvin vs. Cubs
Sunday: Herz vs. Cubs
Monday: Day-off September 23
Tuesday: Parker vs. Royals
Wednesday: Corbin vs. Royals
Thursday: Gore vs. Royals
Friday: Irvin vs. Phillies
Saturday: Herz vs. Phillies
Sunday: Parker vs. Phillies (Final Game of the Season)

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Luis Garcia Jr. at a WAR of +2.9, and Jacob Young at +2.8. and CJ Abrams has sunk all the way back to +1.5. In total, 29 Nats’ players are in positive WAR and another six are at a neutral 0.0 WAR.

“I think [Irvin] relies a lot on his secondary pitches, and he gets beat up that way, starts falling behind. Then he comes back out and retired the next nine batters on really just throwing his fastball, commanding his fastball and keeping the ball down.”

— Nats’ manager Dave Martinez said after Thursday’s game
