Twins at Royals (7:15 p.m. ET on FOX and the FOX Sports app)
Probable starters: Bailey Ober (3.95 ERA) vs. Alec Marsh (4.70 ERA)

Minnesota has quietly been among the top teams in baseball all season long, entering the weekend holding one of the American League's three wild-card spots. The Twins rank in the top 10 offensively in many categories, though they've had some struggles of late with Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton still on the injured list. Pablo López has been one of the best pitchers in baseball since the All-Star break, recording a 1.71 ERA in August. Ober was solid in his last outing, allowing just one run over six innings against the Toronto Blue Jays. 

Kansas City surged up the standings in August to briefly take the lead in the AL Central, but has since cooled off. Still, the Royals are positioned to make the postseason, also holding one of the wild-card spots in the American League. Bobby Witt Jr. has been the biggest reason, leading the American League in batting average as he nears another 30/30 season. The Royals have gotten solid production out of a few arms in their rotation, though Marsh has been pretty shaky.

Bill Belichick reportedly garnering NFL interest after accepting UNC job
Bill Belichick said he didn't take the UNC job just "to leave." But that isn't stopping NFL teams from potentially asking him to do that.

Chicago has had a miserable 2024 season and is on track to break the New York Mets' record for most losses in a single season (120 in 1962). The White Sox's struggles have continued with interim manager Grady Sizemore, going 3-20 since he's taken over. Crochet, however, has been one of the better pitchers in baseball this year, surprising in his first full season as a starter. With the All-Star taking the bump on Saturday, maybe the White Sox can take a step closer to avoid being on the wrong side of history.

Boston has been in the playoff mix for much of the season yet enter the weekend on a five-game losing streak. A three-game set against the White Sox could help them get back on track, as Rafael Devers and Jarren Duran headline one of the best lineups in baseball.

Eric Karros' Top 5 World Series Contenders for the MLB 2024 Season

MLB Roundtable: Deesha Thosar and Rowan Kavner answer five burning questions, including where Juan Soto will sign, the AL East winner, the NL wild-card race, NL ROY and pitching X-factors this September.

Where is Jasson Domínguez?! The New York Yankees did not call up the switch-hitting top prospect when rosters expanded to 28 at the beginning of September, a decision Thosar openly questioned. 

Shohei Ohtani or Francisco Lindor? Hall of Famer John Smoltz weighs in on several topics in his latest weekly interview with Kavner, including NL MVP, MLB's best team, what current player he'd start a franchise with and the closest postseason races. 

Rookie Power Rankings: A three-way race has emerged for NL Rookie of the Year entering September, while the AL award is also up for grabs. So, who are the front-runners? Kavner delivers his latest top 10.

Why Shohei Ohtani made the right move: Ohtani is playing meaningful games in September for the first time in his career, and, as Kavner illuminates, this week's reunion with the Angels only reinforced why he had to sign with the Dodgers.

Power Rankings: Where do the best teams stand as the final month of the regular season begins? Ben Verlander offers his latest top 10.

Want more betting angles? The Dodgers are still the betting favorites to win the World Series, but which team isn't too far behind them? Here are the latest World Series odds. Meanwhile, Ohtani is still a big favorite to win NL MVP, but Lindor is closing in. Stop by our betting hub for all the latest MLB odds!
