Can Trevor Story’s return be a lesson for the Red Sox in beating longshot odds?

BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox’s postseason chances have not looked great lately, but on Friday, the team got a reminder that it’s possible to beat the odds.

Five months after what at the time was deemed season-ending shoulder surgery, Trevor Story is on the precipice of an unlikely return. On Friday, manager Alex Cora made the announcement that barring anything unforeseen, Story would be in the lineup Saturday and starting at shortstop.

“On the personal side, just for him to be out there, it’s huge,” Cora said. “He put in the work, he hasn’t hesitated. He had a goal and it’s going to happen. And I’m very happy for him.”

Story’s return comes at a time when the team is trying to claw its way into a postseason berth. A 3-1 win on Friday night over the Chicago White Sox snapped a five-game losing streak. The Red Sox sit five games back of the third American League wild-card spot, as Kansas City and Minnesota, teams that own the final two wild-card spots, face off this weekend. Seattle, with a win over St. Louis, pushed ahead of the Red Sox and sit 4 1/2 games out.

Rafael Devers broke an 0-for-13 skid with two hits and Enmanuel Valdez’s 12-pitch at-bat in the seventh helped set up Ceddanne Rafaela, who clubbed a two-run homer to break a tie and push the Red Sox ahead.

The odds aren’t great for the Red Sox and Friday’s win wasn’t pretty but it was a win nonetheless. With Story returning, the Red Sox are hoping they can mimic the way he’s exceeded injury recovery expectations.

It’s been a remarkable turnaround for Story, who fractured his non-throwing shoulder on a diving play during the eighth game of the season. From April through mid-July, Story remained away from the team, rehabbing at Elite OrthoSport in southern California where he had the shoulder surgery performed. The 31-year-old rejoined the Red Sox after the All-Star break for their series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, ramping up his workouts until he began a rehab assignment last week with Triple-A Worcester. After just four games, including a 4-for-5 night on Thursday, Story deemed himself ready.

“It’s very important not only for us, but for him too, just go out there and play,” Cora said.

There’s no expectation Story will boost an offense that’s struggled mightily over the last few weeks. That trend continued on Friday, as the lineup mustered just five hits in the win. But it’s clear Cora views Story’s return as a morale boost for the team, one he thinks can rejuvenate the club over the next 21 games. Meanwhile, Story’s defense will undoubtedly solidify the team.

With Story expected to play shortstop moving forward, the Red Sox will move Rafaela to second base, a position at which he’s appeared just 10 times in the majors, including just one start. Yet Cora isn’t worried about the move given Rafaela’s overall defensive excellence.

“He’s a good athlete. He’s been working out at second,” said Cora, who told Rafaela about a week ago that he’d be playing second when Story returned.

“It’s just something else on his resume,” Cora added. “And we expect him to be a good defensive second baseman.”

Rafaela beamed when asked about the opportunity to play alongside Story.

“I’m really excited to have him back and see the awesome player that he is,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Red Sox got another reminder about long shots on Friday after adding right-hander Luis Guerrero to the active roster.

The 2021 17th-round pick not only faced an uphill battle to reach the majors as a late-round draft selection, but he has overcome physical limitations along the way. The 24-year-old, who was born in the Dominican Republic but moved to Boston as a child, walks with a limp as a result of complications from knee surgery when he was young. He has limited mobility in his right knee, but that hasn’t stopped Guerrero from emerging as one of the best relief arms in the Red Sox system. Guerrero excelled out of the Worcester bullpen this season with 79 strikeouts in 54 1/3 innings.

“If you have the willingness to put in the work and the work ethic, you can make it,” Cora said, referencing retired MLB pitcher Jim Abbott, who was born without a right hand. “He’s a big leaguer now. That’s awesome.”

To make room on the roster for Guerrero, however, the Red Sox designated Rich Hill for assignment. Hill has been forced to beat long odds throughout his career and did so again last month, signing a deal with the Red Sox and pitching in his 20th major-league season after he’d taken most of the year off to coach his son’s Little League team. Hill built back up and reached a point where contributed at the big-league level, yet after Cora used him for four outings in five days, the workload was clearly too much for Hill. His departure created an opportunity for Guerrero.

As with the Red Sox’s postseason hopes, opportunities are fleeting. Story’s unlikely arrival coincides with an uphill battle to October with slim chances of making it, but the shortstop has already done the unthinkable this season, perhaps his boost will help them achieve a seemingly impossible task.
