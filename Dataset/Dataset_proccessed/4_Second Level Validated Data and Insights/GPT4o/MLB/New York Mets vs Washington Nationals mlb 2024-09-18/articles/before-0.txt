Not long after Carlos Mendoza praised Luisangel Acuna’s calmness on the field, the rookie made an ugly error in the top of the third that led to an unearned run on Tuesday. 

But in the bottom of the inning, Acuna helped make up for the miscue with a 109 mph rocket to left-center that went for a game-tying double. 

He added a single and a run scored later in the game and then capped off his night with his first MLB homer in the bottom of the eighth.

Acuna’s performance in the Mets’ 10-1 win over the Nationals at Citi Field showed why they still believe they’re OK even with Francisco Lindor sidelined with back soreness. 

“He’s calm [and] poised,” Mendoza said after the win. “He belongs in the big leagues.” 

Told of Mendoza’s comment, Acuna said through an interpreter: “I think it’s something I earned and what he said isn’t a lie.”

That mindset is one of the things that sets Acuna apart, according to his teammates. 

“He’s really confident,’’ said Tylor Megill, who played with Acuna this season at Triple-A. “He’s aggressive with the way he plays. Every time he goes out there, he’s giving it his all. He likes to swing the bat and swing early. Since he’s been up here, nothing’s changed.” 

Not only is Acuna trying to prove himself at the highest level, but he’s doing it while starting at shortstop in New York, with the Mets trying to get to the playoffs — and without their most consistent offensive player for most of the season. 

“He’s jelled super quick,” Pete Alonso said. “He’s a complete pro so far. I know it’s only a few games, but I’m impressed with how he goes about business.” 

The fast start to his MLB career followed an inconsistent season at Triple-A, which is part of the reason why it took until almost the middle of September for Acuna to get to the majors. 

Clearly, he’s not wasting any time getting acclimated to his new surroundings — and he’s had some assistance from his brother, Ronald, the injured Braves star.

“The confidence comes from my brother,’’ said Acuna, who has been talking to the ex-MVP regularly and getting tips.

“I was working hard to do everything I could at Triple-A and now I’m just here to help in any way I possibly can,’’ Acuna said. “It was difficult at the beginning of the season, but I was able to make adjustments.”
