The Washington Nationals got pummeled last night, and all you can do is turn the page. After tonight, there are just 10-games remaining for the Washington Nationals. This is the series finale for the Washington Nationals with the Mets, and this is a salvage game for the Nats.

The Nats need to go 4-7 or better to beat their 2023 win total. How great would that be to finish in the mid-70’s for a win total? For the remainder of the season, the Nats will face teams with winning records with postseason aspirations on the line.

The Nats are deep underdogs today, at +160 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $100 you would win $160. Bet $10.00 and you win $16.00.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez did not get to use Kyle Finnegan last night. He went to his “B” bullpen plus Eduardo Salazar yesterday.

Manager Dave Martinez said that he would like to seed Trevor Williams back into the rotation on Friday against the Cubs. Here is a look at the matchups:

Wednesday: DJ Herz vs. Mets
Thursday: Patrick Corbin vs. Cubs
Friday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Cubs
Saturday: Trevor Williams
Sunday Jake Irvin vs. Cubs
Monday: Day-off September 23
Tuesday: Mitchell Parker vs. Royals
Wednesday: Herz vs. Royals
Thursday: Corbin vs. Royals
Friday: Gore vs. Phillies
Saturday: Williams vs. Phillies
Sunday: Irvin vs. Phillies (Final Game of the Season)

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Luis Garcia Jr. at a WAR of +2.9, and Jacob Young at +2.7. CJ Abrams is at +1.6 WAR. There are 30 Nats’ players in positive WAR with another 7. Finally, Keibert Ruiz has worked his way back from -0.8 just last month to a positive +0.1 now.

“We just couldn’t catch up to a fastball. The guy was throwing fastballs, and we were late. Bad combination.”


— Nats’ manager Dave Martinez said after yesterday’s game
