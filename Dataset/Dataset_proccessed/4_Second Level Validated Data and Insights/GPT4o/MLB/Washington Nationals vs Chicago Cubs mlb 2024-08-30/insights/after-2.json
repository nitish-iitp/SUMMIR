        "Thanks to an extreme (and late-game) comeback on Wednesday, the Cubs wound up sweeping the Pirates.",
        "The Nationals are a theoretically easier opponent.",
        "Shota Imanaga is on the mound tonight.",
        "The Cubs lineup remains as stable as ever, with Miguel Amaya cycling back in for Christian Bethancourt, but no other changes.",
        "Since June 21, only two pitches in baseball have allowed more homers than Shota Imanaga\u2019s 15.",
        "Despite the longball, Imanaga has still been productive, especially his last two times out against the Blue Jays and Marlins (combined): 12.0 IP, 8H, 3ER, 3BB, 9K.",
        "Overall, Jake Irvin has been pretty solid this season, with a 3.80 ERA and just a 6.0% walk rate over 27 starts.",
        "After an outstanding 8.0 inning scoreless start against the Mets on the Fourth of July, Irvin has allowed 33 earned runs in 50.1 IP (5.90 ERA)."
