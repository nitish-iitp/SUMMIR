        "Cody Bellinger commented on the team's collective performance, saying, 'It\u2019s been really fun. Collectively as a whole, it\u2019s been loud. It\u2019s been a lot of barrels. I\u2019m just trying to be a part of that.'",
        "Washington manager Dave Martinez reflected on Jake Irvin's performance, stating, 'When he kept the ball down he was really good, as we saw. That\u2019s the key for him. Just keep everything down. When he\u2019s down, the curveball works, the changeup works, the two-seamer works. Hopefully he learns that when he\u2019s down, he\u2019s very effective.'"
