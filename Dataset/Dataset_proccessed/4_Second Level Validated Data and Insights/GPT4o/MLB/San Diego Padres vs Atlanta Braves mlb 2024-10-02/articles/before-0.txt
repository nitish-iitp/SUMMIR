NL Wild Card Game 2 Preview: Atlanta Braves vs. San Diego Padres Prediction - October 2, 2024

Matchup: Atlanta Braves (89-73) at San Diego Padres (93-69)

Venue: Petco Park, San Diego, California - 5:30 PM ET

 

Introduction

The San Diego Padres hold a 1-0 series lead heading into Game 2 of the NL Wild Card against the Atlanta Braves. After a dominant 4-0 victory in Game 1, the Padres are in prime position to advance with a win at Petco Park. Joe Musgrove will take the mound for San Diego, while Atlanta will counter with left-hander Max Fried, making this a compelling pitcher’s duel. The Braves are fighting to extend their season, but the Padres’ home-field advantage will give them a hard battle again.

 

Odds Table
Team\tMoneyline\tRun Line\tOver/Under
Atlanta Braves (89-73)\t+120\t+1.5 (-225)\tOver 6.5 (-135)
San Diego Padres (93-69)\t-120\t-1.5 (+175)\tUnder 6.5 (+115)

Interpretation: The Padres are slight favorites at -120, while the Braves are +120 underdogs. The run total is set at 6.5, indicating that oddsmakers expect a low-scoring game, likely due to the quality of the starting pitchers.

 
Team Analysis
Atlanta Braves

The Braves enter Game 2 facing elimination after being shut out in Game 1. Offensively, Atlanta has relied heavily on Marcell Ozuna, who hit 39 home runs and drove in 104 RBIs this season. However, without Ronald Acuña Jr., who is out for the series, the Braves’ lineup lacks depth and consistency. Atlanta’s ability to score runs will largely depend on their power hitters stepping up in this must-win game.

Max Fried will start for Atlanta. Fried had an 11-10 record during the regular season, along with a stellar 3.25 ERA and 1.16 WHIP. He has been a reliable force at the top of the Braves' rotation, striking out 166 batters over 190 innings. However, Fried has been inconsistent in the postseason in previous years, and facing a Padres lineup that has been effective at home could pose a challenge.

San Diego Padres

The Padres' offense has been led by Manny Machado, who hit 29 home runs with 105 RBIs, and Luis Arraez, who posted a .318 average. San Diego's balanced attack, combined with home-field advantage, makes them a tough team to beat at Petco Park. The Padres have a .263 team batting average, and their ability to hit for power and average puts pressure on opposing pitching staffs.

Joe Musgrove will start for San Diego in Game 2. Musgrove had a solid regular season, going 6-5 with a 3.88 ERA and 1.17 WHIP over 126 innings. While his win-loss record is not indicative of his true performance, Musgrove has been reliable when healthy, and his ability to limit base runners and strike out batters will be key against a Braves lineup that can be dangerous if given opportunities.

Starting Pitcher Analysis
Max Fried (ATL)

Max Fried has been Atlanta’s most dependable starter this season, finishing with an 11-10 record, a 3.25 ERA, and a 1.16 WHIP. Over 190 innings, he struck out 166 batters and allowed just 54 walks, showing excellent control. Fried’s ability to induce ground balls and limit home runs has been crucial to his success. However, his postseason track record has been shaky, and facing a Padres lineup in San Diego’s pitcher-friendly park may test his ability to keep the game under control.

Joe Musgrove (SD)

Joe Musgrove put together a solid season despite battling injuries. He posted a 6-5 record with a 3.88 ERA and 1.17 WHIP over 126 innings. Musgrove is known for his ability to generate strikeouts, with 101 Ks this season, while maintaining solid command, walking just 29 batters. His diverse pitch mix, which includes a sharp slider and an effective curveball, makes him a tough matchup for any lineup. Given the Braves’ struggles in Game 1, Musgrove has a great chance to lead the Padres to another victory and advance to the next round.

9/30/24: Lost 8-7 vs. Mets (Doubleheader)
9/29/24: Lost 4-2 vs. Royals
9/28/24: Won 2-1 vs. Royals

The Braves' offense has struggled, scoring just four total runs in their last three losses. They will need their bats to wake up if they hope to extend the series.

San Diego Padres
10/1/24: Won 4-0 vs. Braves (NL Wild Card Game 1)
9/29/24: Lost 11-2 @ Diamondbacks
9/28/24: Won 5-0 @ Diamondbacks
9/27/24: Won 5-3 @ Diamondbacks
9/26/24: Lost 7-2 @ Dodgers

San Diego’s pitching has been stellar, allowing just four runs combined in their last three wins. With Musgrove on the mound, they’ll look to continue that trend in Game 2.

Head-to-Head Comparison

The Padres took Game 1 of this series in commanding fashion, winning 4-0 and shutting down the Braves' offense. San Diego has also won four of their last five matchups against Atlanta this season. With Joe Musgrove’s reliable track record and Max Fried’s postseason struggles, the Padres are in a strong position to close out the series at home.

Against the Spread (ATS) Records
Atlanta Braves

The Braves are 83-79 ATS this season, but their struggles as road underdogs have been evident. With their offense sputtering and Max Fried’s inconsistent postseason history, Atlanta may have a hard time covering the spread in Game 2.

San Diego Padres

The Padres are 89-73 ATS in 2024 and have consistently covered as home favorites. With Joe Musgrove on the mound and San Diego holding momentum, the Padres are well-positioned to cover the run line and close out the series.

The Padres are 7-3 in their last 10 games as favorites.
The under is 5-2 in the Padres’ last seven home games.
The Braves are 2-5 in their last seven playoff games as underdogs.
