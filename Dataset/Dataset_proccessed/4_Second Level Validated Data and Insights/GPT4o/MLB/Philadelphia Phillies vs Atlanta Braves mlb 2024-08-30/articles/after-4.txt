Phillies' lead over Braves in NL East slips to 5 games as Arcia homers twice in 7-2 loss

August 31, 2024 / 5:53 AM EDT / CBS/AP

PHILADELPHIA (CBS/AP) -- Solo home runs from Bryson Stott and J.T. Realmuto weren't enough to stop the Atlanta Braves, who jacked three solo homers of their own en route to a 7-2 win over the Phillies Friday night at Citizens Bank Park.

Ranger Suárez (11-6) struck out the first five batters — the first Phillies pitcher to achieve that feat since Cole Hamels in 2010 — in his second start since he missed just more than a month with lower-back tightness. 

The left-hander then gave up back-to-back Braves shots in the third inning.

"The two home runs were just mislocations, just balls that leaked back out over the plate and they put good swings on them," Phillies manager Rob Thomson said after the game.

Orlando Arcia hit his 14th homer of the year, and .216-hitting catcher Sean Murphy connected for his eighth homer of the season for a 2-0 lead. Suárez allowed a pair of RBI groundouts in the fourth, including to Murphy, for a 4-0 lead.

Arcia, a noted Phillies tormentor, homered again to a rousing chorus of boos in the sixth off reliever Max Lazar for a 5-0 lead. The Braves hit at least three home runs in a game for the 26th time this season, the most in the National League.

"I'd like to think I'm just a player who likes to go out there and enjoy his game," Arcia said through a translator. "If they boo me, I've still got to go out there and take those at bats. It doesn't change much. I think the whole world could hear (the boos)."

While both teams are about a lock to reach the playoffs, a split of the first two games of a four-game weekend set between the NL East rivals moved the Braves within five games of the division-leading Phillies with 27 games left in the season.

"That's a really good team over there," Phillies slugger Bryce Harper said. "They're playing real good baseball right now. They're in our ballpark. We've got a good chance to go and beat them the next two."

Reynaldo López (8-4) won his second straight start and has seemingly rebounded from an 0-3 June. López gave up one run and tossed four-hit ball over six innings. He struck out six.

He lowered his ERA against the Phillies this season to 1.06 over three starts and 17 innings.

Harper doubled twice off López — giving him 33 this season — and singled but while wearing a black sleeve on his right arm. A two-time NL MVP, Harper told MLB.com ahead of the game he's battled nagging wrist and elbow issues.

"It's not anything crazy, but obviously it's there," said Harper, who has not homered since Aug. 9, a string of 77 consecutive plate appearances.

The Phillies' No. 1 and No. 2 hitters, Kyle Schwarber and Trea Turner, were a combined 0-for-8.

This season, Suárez jumped out to a 10-1 start and was named to his first All-Star team before injuries and a touch of ineffectiveness derailed any hope of a Cy Young Award. He gave up four runs and struck out five in four innings — the fourth time in his last five starts he's allowed at least three earned runs.

Pierce Johnson, Joe Jiménez and Dylan Lee preserved the lead a night after the Phillies rallied from a 4-0 hole to beat the Braves 5-4, tying their largest comeback win of the season.

Prior to the game, the Phillies paid respects to Johnny Gaudreau and Matthew Gaudreau, who were killed Thursday night by a suspected drunk driver in New Jersey.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Phillies reliever José Alvarado returned to the team Friday after he was placed earlier this week on the restricted list for a personal matter. The 29-year-old Alvarado has a 4.30 ERA in 56 appearances this season. He has converted 13 of 16 save opportunities. Manager Rob Thomson said he expected Alvarado would be activated after Saturday's game.

All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm did not play a night after he hurt his left hand on a swing.

UP NEXT

The Braves send LHP Max Fried (8-7, 3.50 ERA) to the mound against Phillies RHP Zack Wheeler (12-6, 2.74 ERA).
