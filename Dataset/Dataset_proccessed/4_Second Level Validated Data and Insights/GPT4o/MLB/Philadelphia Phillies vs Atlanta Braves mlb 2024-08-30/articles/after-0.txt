PHILADELPHIA -- Orlando Arcia was asked if he could hear the boos that he elicited while producing his second career multihomer game in the Braves’ 7-2 win over the Phillies on Friday night at Citizens Bank Park.

“I think the whole world could hear it,” a laughing Arcia said through translator Franco Garcia.

Arcia served as a villain to the Philadelphia fans he further angered when he playfully looked at Bryce Harper after hitting a home run last week in Atlanta. This was the continuation of a subplot that began during last year’s postseason.

But the Braves' shortstop also skillfully filled the hero role while backing Reynaldo López’s strong start and helping Atlanta again bounce back from a tough loss.

So, does he relish the villain role?

“I like to think I’m just a player who goes out there to enjoy his game, and if they boo me, I still have to go out there and take those at-bats,” Arcia said. “So it doesn’t really change much.”

Arcia went back-to-back with Sean Murphy off Ranger Suárez in the third inning and then fueled a two-run sixth by taking Max Lazar deep. His contributions allowed the Braves to distance themselves from the frustration felt on Thursday night, when they squandered a 4-0 sixth-inning lead and lost the opener of this key four-game series.

The Braves have won 13 of 18 since blowing an 8-2 eighth-inning lead against the Rockies at Coors Field on Aug. 11. They also have won eight of 11 since learning on Aug. 19 that Austin Riley will miss the remainder of the regular season with a broken hand. So maybe it shouldn’t have been surprising to see them bounce back and tally this win that brings them back within five games of the first-place Phillies in the National League East. They also have a three-game lead in the battle for the NL’s final Wild Card spot.

“These guys are fighting their rears off, man,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “We’re kind of in a day-to-day mode where we have to win every day, regardless of the series. We need every win we can get.”

One of the subplots of this NL East rivalry unraveled during last year’s NL Division Series. Multiple publications reported Arcia said, “Atta boy, Harper,” after the Phillies star was doubled off first to end Game 2. Harper responded by staring at Arcia after both of the homers he hit in Philadelphia’s Game 3 victory. Arcia playfully mimicked this gesture when he homered in Atlanta’s loss on Aug. 21.

From the players’ perspective, that storyline might have ended last week. But as Arcia was booed during pregame introductions and after both of his home runs, it was obvious Phillies fans haven’t forgotten.

López was the benefactor of Arcia’s first two-homer game since he tallied one for the Brewers on June 1, 2019, in Pittsburgh. The All-Star hurler allowed one run over six innings on Friday. He has surrendered just three runs over the 17 innings (three starts) he has completed since coming off the injured list and just two runs over 17 innings (three starts) against the Phillies this year.

The 30-year-old hurler has a 2.00 ERA through his first 22 starts. He missed three weeks because of right forearm tightness that developed during a July 28 start against the Mets.

“He’s had a tremendous year,” Arcia said. “I just pray to God that he stays healthy so that he can continue this terrific season.”

Braves starting pitchers haven’t allowed more than three runs in 19 straight games. Per Elias, this is the club’s longest single-season streak since the mound moved to its current distance in 1893.

The club’s attempt to get back to the postseason has also been bolstered by a suddenly powerful lineup. The Braves have hit 26 homers over their past 18 games. Matt Olson has fueled this surge, but Arcia has also aided the late charge.

Arcia hit seven home runs in 343 at-bats over his first 98 games. He has hit eight homers over the 113 at-bats he has tallied within the following 32 games. The 2023 All-Star’s OPS has jumped from a subpar .588 to a much-improved .654 during this stretch.

“I’m really happy,” Arcia said. “That’s why you put in the work to get those types of results. I just thank God for the way things have been going lately.”
