White Sox Continue to be Awful

The White Sox are hoping to fast forward a couple of months because this season has been awful. On Sunday the White Sox failed to score any runs and they ended up losing 2-0. The White Sox finished with only two total hits and even though the pitching was actually pretty good, it didn’t matter all that much. The White Sox are averaging 3.04 runs while their pitching is giving up 5.15 runs per game. Andrew Benintendi has hit 15 home runs and driven in 48 RBis so far this season. Getting the start for the Whtie Sox will be Chris Flexen who sits with a 2-13 record and an ERA of 5.29. In his last start against the Texas Rangers, he went 6.1 innings giving up nine hits and three runs. 

Orioles Coming off a Win

After losing on Saturday the Orioles bounced back in a big way and they were able to beat the Colorado Rockies. The Orioles scored six runs while the pitching gave up only one run at Coors Field. Zach Eflin went seven innings giving up four hits and one run. Gunnar Henderson finished with two hits and two RBIs. The Orioles are averaging 4.96 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.32 runs per game. The offense is ranked 4th in the league while the defense is ranked 13th. Getting the start for the Orioles will be Corbin Burnes who sits with a 12-7 record and an ERA of 3.23. In his last start against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he went five innings giving up five hits and six runs. 

Why the Orioles Will Beat the White Sox
The White Sox have lost each of their last 10 games.
The Orioles have won each of their last eight games against AL Central opponents that held a losing record.
The Orioles have covered the run line in each of their last eight-day games against AL Central opponents following a road win.
The White Sox have failed to cover the run line in nine of their last 10 road games against American League opponents that held a winning record.
Chicago White Sox vs Baltimore Orioles Prediction

We are trusting Chris Flexen here? I don’t think so. Even though he was better in his last start, he still sits with an ERA of 5.29. Burnes in his last start gave up six runs but he still sits with an ERA of 3.23 and he gets to face off against a terrible offense in the White Sox. The Orioles are going to put on a show here with the offense and they are going to cruise to the victory here. Back the Orioles -2.5 to cash.
