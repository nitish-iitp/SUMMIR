CLEVELAND, Ohio — A home schedule that started with a total solar eclipse has ended on a totally soggy note for the 2024 American League Central Division champion Guardians. After watching the moon slide in front of the sun on opening day April 8, Cleveland’s regular season finale at Progressive Field was washed away by interminable, annoying precipitation.

All of it leaving their six-time All-Star third baseman to wonder “what if?”

Sunday’s scheduled regular season finale between the Guardians (92-69) and Houston Astros (88-73) was canceled following a weather delay of three hours and five minutes. The game will not be made up, per the club.

Guardians third baseman — José Ramírez, sitting on 39 home runs, 39 doubles, and 41 steals — had an opportunity at the beginning of the day to become Cleveland’s first 40/40/40 hitter. But Ramírez was denied his shot when Major League Baseball officially canceled the game at 6:05 p.m.

The next time Cleveland will take the field is Oct. 5 in Game 1 of the American League Division Series. Their opponent could be the same Astros team, which must first advance past Detroit in the AL Wild Card series which begins Tuesday.

Managers from both clubs met with umpires, executives and grounds crew members at 2:30 p.m. to discuss their options before the three-hour delay. Stephen Vogt said Cleveland wanted to play, but the chief concern was the safety of Guardians players.

“The field has taken a ton of water over the last three days, and that was really the number one thing for us,” Vogt said. “At the end of the day, we waited until MLB decided we couldn’t go. If the rain isn’t going to stop, we don’t want to put our players out there in a game that has no consequence.”

Another concern was delaying Houston’s return home as the Astros prepare for a wild card series opener on Tuesday against the Tigers at Minute Maid Park.

“We just chatted out what each other wanted, but really at the end of the day it was in MLB’s hands,” Vogt said.

Ticketholders for Sunday’s game who purchased through CLEGuardians.com or the MLB Ballpark app will receive a credit amount for their tickets on their MyTickets account that can be used towards a 2024 postseason game or a 2025 regular season game, the club announced.
