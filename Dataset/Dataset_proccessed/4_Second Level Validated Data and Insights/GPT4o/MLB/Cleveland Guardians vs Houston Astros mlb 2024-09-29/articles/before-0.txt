Houston Astros vs Cleveland Guardians Prediction 

Houston has won the first two games in this series and they have played very well to close out the regular season. The Astros are 42-38 on the road this season, while the Guardians are 50-30 at home. Both of these teams are headed to the postseason and their seeds are set, so this game means very little for both sides. I don’t love either side in this matchup, but I am going to side with Cleveland and their stellar home record.
