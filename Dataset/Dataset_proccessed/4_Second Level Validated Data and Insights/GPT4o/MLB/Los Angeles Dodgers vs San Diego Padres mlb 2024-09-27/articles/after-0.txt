Shohei Ohtani hit a go-ahead single in a five-run seventh inning as the Los Angeles Dodgers clinched their 11th National League West title in 12 seasons with a 7-2 victory over the visiting San Diego Padres on Thursday.

Will Smith had a game-tying two-run homer and Mookie Betts added a two-run single in the seventh for the Dodgers (95-64), who also clinched a bye in the wild-card round. Ohtani went 3-for-5.

Los Angeles held off a second-half surge by the Padres, who clinched a playoff spot with a victory at Los Angeles on Tuesday.

The Dodgers' victory came at a cost, as first baseman Freddie Freeman departed in the seventh inning after rolling his right ankle trying to beat out a ground ball to second base.

The slugger's absence would be a big blow for the powerful Dodgers lineup. Freeman is batting .282 this season with 22 home runs and 89 RBIs. In 15 seasons, the eight-time All-Star and 2020 NL MVP is a career .300 hitter in 2,032 games with 343 home runs and 1,232 RBIs for the Atlanta Braves (2010-21) and the Dodgers.

Luis Arraez and Xander Bogaerts each drove in a run for the Padres (91-68), who needed a three-game sweep at Los Angeles to have a serious chance at catching the Dodgers in the division but lost the final two contests in the series.

Dodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up one run on five hits over five innings in his final tune-up before the playoffs. He fanned one and walked one. Anthony Banda (3-2) came off the injured list to pitch 1⅓ scoreless innings for the win.

Padres starter Joe Musgrove gave up two runs on five hits over 6⅓ innings with one walk and six strikeouts. Tanner Scott (9-6) was charged with three runs — two earned — in two-thirds of an inning.

San Diego broke through first in the fifth inning when former Dodger David Peralta drew a one-out walk and went to third on a double by Kyle Higashioka. Arraez brought home Peralta on a ground ball to first base.

The Padres upped their lead to 2-0 in the sixth inning against Dodgers right-hander Evan Phillips when Jurickson Profar singled and eventually scored on a sacrifice fly to center by Bogaerts.

Los Angeles finally got to Musgrove in the seventh inning. Max Muncy worked a leadoff walk and Smith hit a game-tying home run to center field, his 20th on the season and his third in 18 September games.

Enrique Hernandez had a pinch-hit single and Andy Pages was awarded first base on catcher's interference before Ohtani hit a slow roller into right field for a 3-2 lead. Betts followed with his two-run double.

Pages hit a two-run home run for the Dodgers in the eighth, his 12th.
