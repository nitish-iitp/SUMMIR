Kansas City Royals vs Pittsburgh Pirates Prediction

I might take a stab on the Pirates here. Keller hasn’t pitched terribly over his last two starts, despite going 0-1 in that pair. Keller notched 11.1 total innings with five earned on 18 hits and zero walks in those two. If he can keep things under control for six innings or so Pittsburgh will be in good shape.

On Friday the Pirates scored a couple of runs in the ninth but they were so far behind that it made little difference. Overall the Pittsburgh pen was pretty decent on 5.0 innings, three hits, one walk and one earned. That said, the bats were quiet for much of the game. The Pirates need a better effort on both sides Saturday.
