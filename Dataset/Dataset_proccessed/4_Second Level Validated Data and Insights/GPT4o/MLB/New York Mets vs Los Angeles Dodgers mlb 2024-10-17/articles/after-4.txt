Dodgers vs. Mets: L.A. takes 3-1 lead with another blowout win at Citi Field
Every player in the Dodgers lineup got a hit, with HRs from Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts

The Los Angeles Dodgers have a 3-1 lead in the NLCS after a show of force in Game 4, with their offense knocking around the New York Mets pitching staff early and often in a 10-2 win.

Shohei Ohtani provided a sign of things to come with a leadoff homer in the first inning, his first hit all postseason with the bases empty.

The Dodgers added multiple runs to their lead in the third inning, then the fourth, then the sixth, then the eighth. Their offense was relentless and exacting, drawing nine walks, plus a hit-by-pitch from a Mets staff that could be starting to feel the short starts from their rotation.

Mets reliever Danny Young threw a 1-2-3 inning in the ninth frame. It was New York's first clean inning since the fourth inning of Game 3.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto allowed two earned runs in 4 1/3 innings of work while striking out eight. The bullpen took over from there and didn't allow a run, though Evan Phillips and Blake Treinen both ran into some rare trouble during their outings.

The end result is a dire situation for the Mets, who enter Game 5 with few good starting pitching options after Kodai Senga's rough Game 1. Manager Carlos Mendoza told reporters following the game that David Peterson will get the start after working out of the bullpen all postseason.

Meanwhile, the Dodgers will be starting Jack Flaherty, who threw seven scoreless innings in Game 1. They will be heavily favored in Game 5, scheduled for Friday at 5:08 p.m. at Citi Field (Fox Sports 1).

FINAL: Dodgers 10, Mets 2

The Dodgers' offense did what it wanted, and they're now one win from a pennant.

Game 5 is scheduled for Friday at 5:08 p.m. ET, with Jack Flaherty scheduled to face TBD.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 8:43 PM PDT

The Dodgers go down in order in the ninth inning. Per the FS1 broadcast, it was their first 1-2-3 inning since the fourth inning of Game 3. Their offense has been that good.

"You all f***ing suck."

A Mets fan (we assume) makes his thoughts clear to the Fox Sports 1 microphones.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 8:36 PM PDT
Jack Baer

The Mets have several options for who pitches in Game 5, and none of them is ideal. There are:

Kodai Senga, who is still working his way back from an injury and got knocked around in 1 1/3 innings of work in Game 1

David Peterson, who had a strong regular season as a starter but has worked out of the bullpen all postseason

Sean Manaea, who was great in Game 2 but would be pitching on short rest (and that kicks the can down the road)

A bullpen game, which is basically what Senga's Game 1 disaster turned into (the Dodgers ended up scoring nine runs)

With Jack Flaherty starting for the Dodgers following his seven scoreless innings in Game 1, Los Angeles figures to be heavily favored to close this thing out on Friday.

The Dodgers now have ace defender Kevin Kiermaier, who pinch ran for Teoscar Hernandez, in center field, pushing Andy Pages to Hernandez's spot in left field.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 8:25 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Shohei Ohtani fouled a ball hard off his left knee and was in some pretty clear pain. He stayed in but was still noticeably limping around after a pitch. He strikes out to end the inning, and the Dodgers will now make sure he's OK.

Dodgers 10, Mets 2

Will Smith scores Edman with a single. The Dodgers have a lot of runs. Every player in their lineup has a hit. The Mets are in a bad place.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 8:18 PM PDT
Jack Baer

It's not all good for the Dodgers. Max Muncy strikes out and snaps his postseason on-base streak at a record-tying 12. Tough to watch.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 8:16 PM PDT
Jack Baer

This is a very good point. The Padres have a good rotation and one of the few lineups that can match up with the Dodgers. San Diego had them on the ropes, then their offense disappeared in the NLDS. There might not be a team that matches up better against Los Angeles left in this postseason.

The Padres were really, really good.

Dodgers 9, Mets 2

The Dodgers are just trying to break spirits now. Tommy Edman plates two runs with a double, and that's three games this series with at least eight runs.

It's the eighth inning, and some Mets fans are leaving.

Teoscar Hernandez draws another walk, the Dodgers' eighth of the game and 30th of the series. Per the broadcast, that ties the record for most in the first four games of a championship series. Combined with the power at the top of the order, that's a tough combination to beat across a series.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 8:07 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Marte flies out just short of the warning track. It's been more eventful than usual for the Dodgers bullpen in this game, but they still haven't allowed a run. Six outs left for the Mets to score five runs, or else they need an even bigger comeback to win this series.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 8:05 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Treinen allows a leadoff single to Francisco Lindor, then Brandon Nimmo puts runners on the corners with a two-out single. Mets have a chance for multiple runs here, and it comes down to Starling Marte.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:56 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Gasp, the Mets got Ohtani out with runners on base.

It's still 7-2 with the top of the Mets order due up in the bottom of the seventh inning. Blake Treinen will be staying in after throwing two pitches in the sixth.

Shohei Ohtani comes up with runners on first and second and two outs, and that will do it for Phil Maton. The left-handed Danny Young comes in and will try to keep this game within semi-reasonable striking distance.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:49 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Dodgers rookie Andy Pages takes an 88 mph sinker to the right wrist. He was in some clear pain but looks like he's staying in the game.

That's now eight free passes granted to the Dodgers lineup this game (seven walks and the HBP). That's nearly an entire turn through the order, in a series in which preserving your bullpen is vital.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:46 PM PDT

Max Muncy singles to open the seventh inning. That ties Reggie Jackson for the longest postseason on-base streak, and this is the only one that was done in a single season (a single series, no less).

Check that, Blake Treinen comes in to end the inning. Jesse Winker welcomes him with a deep fly ball, but Mookie Betts catches it at the warning track. It's another scoreless inning for the Dodgers bullpen.

Another aggressive move bringing in Treinen, and it's only the sixth inning.

McNeil hits a fly ball to center field, but it's caught and too shallow for Brandon Nimmo to score from third. The Mets bring Jesse Winker in as a pinch hitter, and the Dodgers respond by finally pulling Phillips for the left-handed Banda.

Still a bases-loaded situation, but Phillips responded by getting two very big outs.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:36 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Phillips strikes out Iglesias and is staying in to face pinch hitter Jeff McNeil. That is a curious decision from Dave Roberts, considering Phillips is at 28 pitches.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:33 PM PDT
Jack Baer

And now J.D. Martinez fights back from 1-2 to load the bases with a walk. The Mets have bases loaded with no outs, bottom of the order due up.

Dave Roberts opts to keep Phillips in to face the right-handed Jose Iglesias. Anthony Banda and Blake Treinen are both warming.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:30 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Evan Phillips stays in for the sixth after throwing nine pitches in the fifth. Brandon Nimmo and Starling Marte respond with back-to-back singles to open the frame.

Anthony Banda is warming for the Dodgers in a game that ain't over yet.

Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts are a combined 4-for-5 tonight with three walks, two homers, a double, five RBI and six runs scored.

It's also probably worth noting that the Dodgers sat Freddie Freeman to rest his ankle and have now scored seven runs in six innings. That's significant for both this series and what comes next if the Dodgers win one of the next three games.

Dodgers 7, Mets 2

Mookie Betts makes the Mets pay for walking Ohtani, breaking this thing open with a two-run homer. He was skipping down the first-base line. The Mets now have to score five runs in four innings to avoid a 3-1 hole.

If Betts is hitting like Mookie Betts again ... this Dodgers team is looking a lot better.

Shohei Ohtani draws his third walk of the game after his leadoff homer, and these aren't close balls. Mets pitchers have thrown two strikes total in his three walks. They are clearly avoiding the zone and just hoping he can be goaded into chasing.

José Buttó exits after 2 IP of work and is replaced by Phil Maton.

Evan Phillips strikes out Vientos and gets an easy fielder's choice from Pete Alonso to end a scoreless fifth inning.

A wild stat from the FS1 broadcast: The Dodgers bullpen hasn't allowed a run in a win this postseason.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:05 PM PDT
Jack Baer

The Dodgers have been one of the most aggressive teams with their bullpen this postseason, pulling their starters early and deploying their top relievers wherever there's a potential high-leverage situation.

The question is will that use cost them in a seven-game series after it succeeded in a five-game series against the Padres? It's less of an issue if they win tonight.

Thu, October 17, 2024 at 7:03 PM PDT

Yamamoto strikes out Francisco Lindor for the first out, and that will do it for him after 4 1/3 innings and 73 pitches. Dave Roberts brings in Evan Phillips to face Mark Vientos, who homered off Yamamoto in the first inning, and Pete Alonso.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto hits Francisco Alvarez in the left thigh to open the bottom of the fifth, and the young catcher is in clear pain. He's limping around first base as the trainer comes out to check on him.

Looks like he's staying in, but now the question is how far do the Dodgers let Yamamoto (68 pitches) go in his third time through the order. Evan Phillips is warming as the top of the Mets order comes up.

Max Muncy draws a walk and sets an MLB record with his 11th straight time reaching base in a single postseason. He can reach base one more time to tie the overall record, held by Reggie Jackson's 12 straight between the 1977 and 1978 postseasons.

We are all witnesses.

After a difficult third inning, Yamamoto gets through the fourth inning with a 1-2-3, 10-pitch performance. There were some audible boos at Citi Field after his strikeout of Harrison Bader.

Yamamoto is at 7 Ks and 66 pitches through four innings. A long start would be huge for the Dodgers after leaning hard on their bullpen in Game 3.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto has the secondary stuff working today.

He has seven strikeouts through four innings — four on the slider and three on the splitter.

He's generated 15 swings and misses on 66 pitches.

That'll do it for Jose Quintana, and the Dodgers offense did what it does best: running opposing starters ragged. The left-hander exits at 83 pitches in 3 1/3 innings of work, with three walks and five hits allowed.

José Buttó enters with two runners on and one out to face Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernandez.
