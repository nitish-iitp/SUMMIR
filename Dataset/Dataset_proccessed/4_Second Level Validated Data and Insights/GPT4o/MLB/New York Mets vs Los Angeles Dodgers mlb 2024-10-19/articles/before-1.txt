The New York Mets avoided elimination in Game 5 of the NLCS, celebrating a much-needed home victory after two tough consecutive losses. Following the game, Pete Alonso delivered a strong message to the Dodgers ahead of Game 6 and a potential Game 7.

Alonso joined the FOX Sports broadcast alongside Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, and Derek Jeter. Jeter playfully remarked, “I hate having to make a cross-country flight,” then asked Alonso, “How much is the locker room looking forward to heading back to L.A. and continuing with Game 6?”

Alonso responded, “We’ve got to fight another day. We stood up to go out there because this is a game of opportunities, and they’re rare. We want to capitalize, survive Game 6, and see what we’ve got in Game 7—but we’ve got to get there first.”

In a lighthearted moment, Pete Alonso also confessed to Jeter that his travel bag is still packed and joked that he hadn’t had time for laundry. It’s worth noting that the first two games of the NLCS were played at Dodger Stadium on October 13 and 14.
