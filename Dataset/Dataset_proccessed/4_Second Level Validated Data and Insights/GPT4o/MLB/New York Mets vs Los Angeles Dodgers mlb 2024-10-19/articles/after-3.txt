LOS ANGELES -- How quickly the vibes change in baseball’s postseason. The Mets’ early barrage in their 12-6 win in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series forced the series back to Dodger Stadium for Game 6, where the Dodgers will try again to punch their World Series ticket with a well-stocked bullpen ready to go -- but without their star first baseman.

A big storyline for the Dodgers as the series shifts back west is Freddie Freeman’s injured right ankle, and he is not in the Dodgers' starting lineup for Game 6. For New York, it's left-hander Sean Manaea’s renaissance, which included a win at Dodger Stadium in Game 2. And there are the bullpens, which are rested (Dodgers) and depleted (Mets) after each team took a different approach down the stretch of New York’s season-saving victory on Friday night.

The Mets deployed both Ryne Stanek and closer Edwin Díaz for multiple innings in Game 5, knowing it was a must-win game with an off-day to follow. The Dodgers will be in significantly better shape for Game 6 after Brent Honeywell spared the bulk of his bullpen by gobbling up 14 outs.

“That’s playoff baseball right there,” Honeywell said. “Save the dogs.”

The Dodgers need another win to move on to their second World Series in five years.

The Mets need another win to keep their season alive.

“This team has fought all year, so to be in this position isn’t really new to us,” Mets designated hitter Jesse Winker said. “We’ve just got to keep our head down and keep going, keep plugging away at it. It’s like one of those heavyweight prize fights. It’s going to be one of those. And we’re ready for it. We’re going to give it everything we’ve got.”

When is the game and how can I watch it?
Game 6 will be played at Dodger Stadium on Sunday. First pitch is scheduled for 8:08 p.m. ET/5:08 p.m. PT on FS1.

All games are available in the U.S. on MLB.TV (authentication to a participating Pay TV provider is required). Live games are also available in select countries outside the U.S. For full details, click here.

Who are the starting pitchers?
Mets: LHP Sean Manaea (12-6, 3.47 in the regular season)
Manaea held the Dodgers to two runs over five innings of his Game 2 start, limiting them to two hits but also walking four -- as many as in his previous four starts combined. Overall this postseason, Manaea is 2-0 with a 2.65 ERA in three starts. He’ll be operating on five days of rest in this one, as he has for each of his previous two playoff outings.

Dodgers: RHP Michael Kopech (6-8, 3.46 in regular season)
The Dodgers will go with a bullpen game on Sunday, with Kopech taking the ball to start the game. Kopech hasn't allowed a run in 4 1/3 innings this postseason and last appeared in NLCS Game 3, working one inning.

What are the starting lineups?
Mets: Manager Carlos Mendoza is sticking with the same lineup that he used in in the Mets' 12-6 Game 5 win, including Jeff McNeil at second base.

Francisco Lindor, SS
Brandon Nimmo, LF
Mark Vientos, 3B
Pete Alonso, 1B
Jesse Winker, DH
Starling Marte, RF
Tyrone Taylor, CF
Jeff McNeil, 2B
Francisco Alvarez, C

• Lindor and Winker's baseball bond dates back 15 years

Dodgers: With the left-hander on the mound and Freeman out, they’ll lean on a lineup that is somewhat similar to what they deployed in the Game 4 win against Jose Quintana.

Shohei Ohtani, DH
Mookie Betts, RF
Teoscar Hernández, LF
Tommy Edman, SS
Max Muncy, 1B
Kiké Hernández, 3B
Andy Pages, CF
Will Smith, C
Chris Taylor, 2B

• From Mizusawa to Chavez Ravine, Ohtani's impact spans continents

How will the bullpens line up after the starter?
Mets: The Mets will certainly do their best to take advantage of Saturday’s off-day, but after using Stanek for seven outs and Díaz for six in Game 5, they’ll be shorthanded heading into Game 6. Phil Maton will at least be fully rested, but he hasn’t been effective all postseason. Somebody -- whether Stanek, Díaz, Reed Garrett or Tylor Megill -- might need to pitch at less than 100 percent. In any case, the Mets are going to lean on Manaea for as long as possible.

• Manaea has had Ohtani's number -- but will he in Game 6?

Dodgers: With Honeywell taking down most of the innings behind Jack Flaherty in Game 5, the Dodgers should be in good shape, with all of their high-leverage relievers being available for multiple innings, if needed. Blake Treinen, Evan Phillips and Kopech will be leaned on heavily, and Ryan Brasier, Daniel Hudson and Anthony Banda give the team some depth behind them. If Los Angeles needs some length, it can turn to Landon Knack -- who struggled mightily in Game 2 -- or Ben Casparius.

Any injuries of note?
Mets: Although McNeil hasn’t seen much live pitching since he fractured his right wrist on Sept. 6, he did pick up 10 plate appearances in the Arizona Fall League and eight more so far in the NLCS. Mendoza said McNeil’s contact approach lends itself well to a successful return despite his lack of recent reps. In any case, McNeil is fully healthy and capable of contributing when the Mets call on him.

Nimmo is playing through plantar fasciitis in his left foot. Although Nimmo aggravated the injury during the NLDS, it hasn’t cost him significant time and is unlikely to do so going forward. For Nimmo, this is a pain tolerance issue.

As for the seven players on the Mets’ injured list -- Paul Blackburn, Christian Scott, Dedniel Núñez, Sean Reid-Foley, Drew Smith, Brooks Raley and Ronny Mauricio -- none will return this year.

Dodgers: Freeman has struggled at the plate as he continues to nurse a badly sprained right ankle, and he was held out of the starting lineup for Game 6.

Who is hot and who is not?
Mets: Heading into Friday, Alonso qualified for the “not hot” section of this FAQ. He responded with a three-run homer in the first inning and reached base safely in each of his first three Game 5 plate appearances. In the postseason, that’s how quickly things can change. One other example of that phenomenon is Alvarez, who was 6-for-36 over his first 11 playoff games before going 3-for-3 in his first three at-bats of Game 5.

Dodgers: Betts has homered in back-to-back games for the second time this postseason and now has four home runs in October. Muncy has also been one of the team’s best hitters despite going 0-for-3 in Game 4.

On the other hand, the Dodgers are still waiting for Teoscar Hernández and Smith to give them more production. The two All-Stars have struggled against the Mets, with Hernández still searching for his first hit of the series.

Anything else fans might want to know?

This is the fourth postseason meeting between the Mets and Dodgers, dating to a 1988 NLCS win for Los Angeles in what’s still considered one of the greatest postseason series. The Mets earned some revenge in the 2006 NLDS, sweeping the Dodgers, and again in a highly entertaining 2015 NLDS win.
While the Mets led Major League Baseball with a 67-40 record from May 30 through the end of the season, the Dodgers weren’t far behind at 62-42. Both ranked in MLB’s top five over that stretch.
In Game 5, the Mets became the first team since the 2022 Angels to avoid striking out in a postseason game. It has happened 11 times in the playoffs.
