        "It's unclear why Houston keeps falling short in extra innings, especially for a team that prioritizes batting average and limits strikeouts.",
        "Maybe it's bad luck, or maybe they're trying too hard.",
        "Maybe they should try Oakland's strategy of bunting at every pitch.",
        "Or maybe 54 games just isn't a large enough sample size.",
        "Still, they'd be even better if they could just win in extra innings."
