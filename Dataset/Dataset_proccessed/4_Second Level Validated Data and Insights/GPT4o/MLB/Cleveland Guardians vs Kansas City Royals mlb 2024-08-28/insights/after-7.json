        "Kansas City manager Matt Quatraro said, 'That\u2019s our goal, to win the division. Clearly nothing is decided. We got a month-plus to go, but we like the way we\u2019re playing. Our guys are super competitive. They don\u2019t back down from anything and this is what a pennant race should be.'",
        "Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said, 'For me, it\u2019s about the end of the season. It doesn\u2019t matter how you get there. What matters is that we do get there. Yeah, if you want to look back at the standings, you have a big lead that\u2019s early in the season, that\u2019s why you play 162 games. There\u2019s nothing that says in this final stretch that we don\u2019t go on a run. There\u2019s nothing that says we don\u2019t do it again. So you can\u2019t look at the standings and worry about where you are on any given day. You\u2019ve got to wait one day at a time, look where you are at the end of the season and then see where it lands.'"
