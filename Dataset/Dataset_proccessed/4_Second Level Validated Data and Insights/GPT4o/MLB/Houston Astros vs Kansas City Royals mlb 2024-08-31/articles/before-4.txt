Kansas City Royals vs Houston Astros Prediction

I’m going with Houston. Kikuchi had a couple of spotty moments in his last start versus Baltimore, ending up with three earned in 5.2 innings for a no-decision. In his two starts prior, however, Kikuchi had two earned in a combined 11.1 innings. As for Ragans, he’s 1-1 in his last three with six earned (four in one start) over 16.0 innings total.

On Friday Houston got a great start from Valdez, but there was a little drama on the scoreboard in the ninth inning. Kikuchi should be able to notch a good start himself, and if the bullpen comes through the Astros will be in a great position for another W in game three.
