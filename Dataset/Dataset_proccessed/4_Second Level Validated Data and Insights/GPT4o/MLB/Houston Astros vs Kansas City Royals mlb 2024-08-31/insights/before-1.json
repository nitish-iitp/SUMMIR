        "Royals manager Matt Quatraro praised Seth Lugo's performance, saying 'He was exceptional. Spun the ball really well, located. He got his sinker in, [threw] good changeups. He had it all working. Seven innings of one-run baseball against that team is a phenomenal effort.'",
        "Seth Lugo credited his preparation between starts for his performance, saying 'I was working on some stuff. I was trying to make an adjustment to put together more quality innings.'",
        "Paul DeJong reflected on his game-tying home run, saying 'He\u2019s been tying me up in, especially up and in with that fastball. He left a slider out there in the middle, kind of low. It was right where I wanted something. I didn\u2019t hit it great, but I got enough of it.'",
        "Despite the tough loss and the news that first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino would be out six to eight weeks with a broken thumb, the Royals showed resolve to fight."
