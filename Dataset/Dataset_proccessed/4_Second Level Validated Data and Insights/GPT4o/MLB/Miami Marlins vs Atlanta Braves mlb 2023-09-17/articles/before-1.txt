Miami Marlins star Jazz Chisholm Jr became only the second player since 1900 to both hit a grand slam and steal three bases in their Saturday night win over the Atlanta Braves.

After a quiet opening, Chisholm made his mark in the second half of the game at Marlins Park, stealing his first base of the evening during the bottom of the fifth inning against Braves reliever Jackson Stephens.

The center fielder then stole his second and third against lefty AJ Minter in the bottom of the seventh of a tied contest, but it was at the bottom of the eighth when he etched his name into the history books.

That was when Chisholm launched a grand slam against Michael Tonkin to put the game out of reach - with Atlanta previously leading 7-5 - and become the second man in 123 years to achieve both feats in a single game.

The only other player to hit a Grand Slam and steal three bases since 1900 is former All-Star outfielder Mike Cameron, who pulled it off for the Seattle Mariners against the Toronto Blue Jays back in 2002.

The center fielder is also the first player to pull off the accomplishment in 21 years

Chisholm entered Saturday's game hitting .251/.296/.446 (99 OPS+) with 16 home runs, 40 RBI and 19 stolen bases on 22 attempts.

Jake Burger also hit a go-ahead two-run homer on the night for the Marlins, while Luis Arraez and Yuli Gurriel went deep to help them become the first NL East team to win a series against the division champions. 

The Braves were 11-0-1 in their previous series against division opponents.

Matt Olson hit his major league-leading 52nd homer and overtook Andruw Jones as Atlanta's single-season home run leader. Jones hit 51 in 2005.

Josh Bell drew a two-out walk against Braves reliever Kirby Yates (7-2) before Burger made it 7-5 with a drive over the wall in center for his 32nd homer and seventh since he joined Miami on Aug. 1.

Gurriel singled, and Jesus Sanchez and Garrett Hampson walked before Chisholm connected off Michael Tonkin for Miami´s first grand slam of the season.

Ozzie Albies hit his 30th homer and became the fifth Braves´ player to reach the total this season.

Braves star outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. didn't play because of right calf tightness he experienced late in the series opener Friday.
