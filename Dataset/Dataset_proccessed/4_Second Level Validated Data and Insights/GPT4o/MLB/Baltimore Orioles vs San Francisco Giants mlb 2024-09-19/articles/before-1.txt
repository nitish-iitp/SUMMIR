Baltimore comes into this matchup trying to avoid being swept, but they are playing some of their worst baseball of the season right now. The Orioles are 42-35 at home, while the Giants are 33-41 on the road. San Francisco has struggled away from home this year and they came into this series with very little momentum, but they have rolled in the first two games. Both of these pitchers have decent numbers on the season, but Eflin has been lights out recently. Take Baltimore to avoid the sweep here.
