 Doug Gray  08/28/2024 214

Last night saw Oakland hit three home runs and score five runs during the 7th and 8th innings. That was enough for the Athletics to hang on for a 5-4 win over the Reds to open the series in Cincinnati. Tonight the two are back at it with first pitch scheduled for 6:40pm ET at Great American Ball Park.

Fernando Cruz


The Reds are running out of starting pitchers in both the big leagues and in Triple-A. That has led to back-to-back days where the team is utilizing a reliever as a starter. Today that reliever will be Fernando Cruz.

Left-handed hitters have crushed the ball against him this season. They walk more, make more contact, and hit for tons of power when he’s on the mound. Right-handed hitters walk at a solid slip, but when they make rare contact against him it doesn’t do much.

Osvaldo Bido


The season for Bido began in Triple-A. He made a spot start in a doubleheader in early May, but outside of that he spent the first 12 weeks of the year in the minors. Oakland called him up in late June and he pitched out of the bullpen for the next month before moving into the rotation. He got knocked around on July 28th by the Angels, giving up seven runs in 3.2 innings. Since then he’s made four starts with a 1.17 ERA in 23.0 innings and hasn’t allowed a home run.

In the big leagues this season he’s dominated against left-handed hitters, who are hitting just .154 and slugging just .205. Lefties have walked nearly as often as they struck out, but when they make contact they are doing nothing. Right-handed hitters aren’t exactly hitting well against him, either, but they have done much better than lefties have.

News and Notes

Evan Kravetz called up from Triple-A

As noted above, the team is running out of pitchers. That led to them calling up left-handed reliever Evan Kravetz from Triple-A this afternoon and optioning Casey Legumina back to Triple-A after he pitched last night for the Reds. They also moved Stuart Fairchild to the 60-day injured list, which ends his regular season.

Kravetz, drafted in the 5th round of the 2019 draft, has been in Triple-A with Louisville all season. He’s thrown 42.1 innings with a 3.40 ERA, 22 walks, and has 47 strikeouts. You can see his career stats here.

Rhett Lowder starting on Friday

Cincinnati will be calling up 2023 1st round pick Rhett Lowder to pitch in Friday’s doubleheader against Milwaukee. After beginning the year in High-A Dayton he moved up to Double-A Chattanooga in May and pitched there until last week when he made his one and so far only start in Triple-A with Louisville. We have a 1000-word piece on what we might be able to expect from him if you want to dive into more details.

Mr. Lowder, your table is ready?!

Oldtimer 08/28/2024

Reds brought up Jim O’Toole late in 1958 after he won 20 games at Nashville AA that summer. He won his debut. Hope the same for Lowder.

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

Hope Lowder does well too.
Not a fan of starting his clock though. But they are out of arms.
Is it a callup? Or just the extra player for the double header?

Jason Franklin 08/28/2024

I would say if he does well/average, than it is a callup until the end of the season. If he doesn’t, who knows. I would assume they may jettison him back for more seasoning in AAA.

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

Bido: “In the big leagues this season he’s dominated against left-handed hitters, who are hitting just .154 and slugging just .205.”

Bell: Let’s give Benson and Dom Smith shot, in the same game.

LDS 08/28/2024

Yes, innumerate decisions. I think giving Hinds the shot today would have made more sense.

JB 08/28/2024

No Bell loves his aging vets that get released by different teams. It’s amazing to me that Smith isn’t batting 4th.

comment edited to remove things

Doug Gray 08/28/2024

We aren’t going to keep playing this game. Stop with the insults or you’re going to lose your commenting abilities.

Randoxu1 08/28/2024

Why Smith is even on this roster is a joke. Benson has been the same all year, terrible. Why not just put a lineup out that actually has a chance to win and just play that same lineup everyday. France at 1B, India 2B, De la Cruz ss, Espinal 3B, Steer lf, friedel cf, Hinds Rf , Stephenson C and take your pick at DH. Bell cannot help himself. Also, last night taking Junis out after 43 pitches, totally ridiculous. Bell knows things.

Hanginwithem 08/28/2024

It does give one reason for pause…

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

I don’t know about Benson, some hope maybe, but why is Dom Smith taking at bats from anybody. The 2024 season is all about 2025 now Mr. Bell.

AllTheHype 08/28/2024

Bell is still trying to make the 25 team.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Kind of odd that the pre-game feed shows them prepping the field and TWC has it storming for another little while. I guess you trust your eyes, right? 

Let’s pick up where we left off and get the hit machines rolling. I’m pretty sure we’re going to need it to go Balancing Elephant Hunting!!

David 08/28/2024

Santiago Espinal is at least at 3rd base tonight, instead of RF.

You have to be grateful for the little things, sometimes.

MK 08/28/2024

This pitching situation is really being handled stupidly. Casey Kelly was a starter in the KBO earlier in the season and for several years. Doesn’t he make more sense as a starter than a group of relievers for an inning or two? Connor z Phillips is starting in Louisville today, again a better choice. It might be time for new organizational pitching coordinator. Doesn’t seem like his program is keeping guys healthy or progressing.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

2 balls + 1 cement mixer + GABP = down by 1 with the first batter

Kevin H 08/28/2024

So let’s play a guessing game. My guess is Kelly will come in for 4 or 5 innings.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

Cruz will not, and should not, be with this team next year. He was a good story but he has lost all of his confidence.

RedAlert 08/28/2024

I agree totally … he should not

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

The A’s pitcher has been throwing very well. Will the Reds score more or less than 3 runs?

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Based on that first inning ? 

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

No matter who you support as a manager or what players you think should stay or go there is one fact you can’t dispute about tonight’s game. The size of this crowd is very embarrassing to a once proud franchise. This can’t continue, I can’t wait to see the crowd for game one on Friday.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Thought the same thing as they “followed” Cruz in to start the game. Upper decks almost vacant.

RedAlert 08/28/2024

Reap what they sow … deserve every bit of it
. Can only go so far on bobbleheads and
fireworks …

Pharmer85 08/28/2024

There will be plenty of Brewers fans there.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

OK, through 2 with limited damage. That should be it for Cruz tonight.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Great bounce back inning by Cruz.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Retired 6 straight after the cement mixer

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Friedl’s triple last night seems like an outlier now with him getting under everything.

Then Steer jammed and Espinal a little unlucky.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Watching Espinal go inside out with his swing and go the other way is in my opinion a clinic on what one is supposed to do. When Reds played the Royals it was said Witt Jr, made it a mission to strike out less and go the opposite way.

Lets hope Reds use this mentality going forward and into next season.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Uh … nice thought … but that’s not one of the “3 true outcomes” in the book … 

Kevin H 08/28/2024

:). I can hope can’t I. lol

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

So this will burn Cruz for the next several days, won’t it?

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Yep, and that was my earlier post on another thread. Reliever’s will be tired by Friday’s game and its a no win situation right now. Trading Montas looks even more weird now doesn’t it.

I am thinking Kelly comes in and pitches 5 innings?

Erik the Red 08/28/2024

I was channel flipping and saw the Oakland lead-off homer. The actual crowd may top 3,000 at most. Hard to believe we will not be relevant as a team in September.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Cruz facing Butler again… 5 strikeouts first time thru the line up.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Who singles off a splitter.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Ate him up on that hop and ole play … Cowboy not happy with it being scored a hit.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

It may have been a hit but the effort was not there.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

I saw effort. De La Cruz is still developing and I would he will field that ball better next time, next week, next year.

LarkinPhillips 08/28/2024

Lack of effort would have been waiting back and getting the big safe hope and having no chance to throw him out. Elly went do or die on that and missed it. But that is the way you’re taught to go after the high hope on a fast runner.

Matt McWax 08/28/2024

He looked uncomfortable approaching the ball from that semi-shift position. I feel he would have handled that easily had he been in the normal shortstop position. Probably true for most ole plays – easier away from your body if on your glove side.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

That in my opinion was a in between hope. Even if he gets in front of ball and hits his chest. More in likely a base hit.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

I agree with Cowboy.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

His approach and flagging at it is what Cowboy noted. Neither of us would make it, but he maybe didn’t take the best approach.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Thanks for explaining what Cowboy said Mark. I can see that more so than anything else.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Butler steals second, but it doesn’t matter as Cruz gets Rooker with a heater to end the top of the inning.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Ahead of this game, you could just hear Tom Hanks as Jimmy Duggan … “Let’s go, ladies. Dozens of people are waiting.”

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

That is sad but true.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

ahahaha … dozens are waiting.

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

Busch stadium in St. Lou has a lot of people dressed as red chairs too lately.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Bido is supposed to be lights out against lefties … so far he’s been lights out against the whole lineup.

LarkinPhillips 08/28/2024

Smith now 2-15 with 8ks as a Red. Glad to see him in there, again.

JB 08/28/2024

Got to get him going.

Matt McWax 08/28/2024

I’ll reuse my comment I made about Moustakas a couple years back. Dominic Smith looks to be past the “athlete” phase of his career. Maybe it’s the young athletic makeup of the Reds spoiling me, but I’ve grown weary of bringing ANY of these kind of guys in.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

+5,000

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

Cruz lobbying Bell to stay in.
I don’t think he won.

SteveAReno 08/28/2024

Yes, I’m sure he was saying he can go another inning.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

9 up, 9 down, whiffs where we probably expected them.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

Somebody needs to tell this Reds team, both the manager and the players, that like it or not they still have 29 games left after tonight. So far tonight they look like a team that can’t wait to get the season over with. That is on all of them players and coaches.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Benson with a nice running catch.

Daytonnati 08/28/2024

Must feel like a home game for the A’s … 

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

+5,000

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

So much for the lefty-on-lefty advantage

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

2nd HR allowed all year.
1st to a lefty.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

And Sam Moll gives up a solo shot with 2 outs… A’s up 2-0.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

One solo shot every 3 innings would be manageable if our boyz would actually hit just a bit

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

This is reminding me of the Kansas City series, but the A’s aren’t nearly as good as the Royals but the Reds don’t seem to care.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

We’ll see what the Reds can do the 2nd time thru…

LDS 08/28/2024

Come on Reds, this is Oakland, at GABP. If you can’t get up for this game, what’s it going to take? I hate when the Reds have an “easy” August schedule

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Elly takes the first pitch strike and swings at a ball low for the second out… same ‘o same ‘o.

dimondfvr 08/28/2024

Elly did not even try to run that one out.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Ty Steve swings at ball 4 and ends the Reds 4th.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Can of corn, roll over, can of corn …

4 perfect innings for tonight’s ace in the form of Bido.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

People can disagree and say he is tired but I don’t really like Elly’s body language tonight or for that matter the whole team.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Dude is human Mark, and maybe not up for the game tonight. it happens. I am not holding up for him, however we all have down nights or bad days.

The team as a whole to me is pressing and trying to hit a five run home run. Has to be mentally frustrating to watch a team on the fringe of playoffs to be out so fast in later part of this month.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

I see both points. It does look like they are beat down. And I’ve commented before about them pressing, especially Elly.

Justin T 08/29/2024

Excuses. He is a big leaguer, stop making excuses for him. He is the tone setter, effort shouldn’t even be a topic.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Just have to keep the game close for the late innings rally.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Kelly in for a few innings.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

did somebody ask for Casey Kelly ? He’s out there now !

Kevin H 08/28/2024

I made the comment. LOL lets see if he can save the bullpen again tonight.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Good at bat for Schuemann, one on and one out, … and we get the Double Play to end the A’s half.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Friedl, Steel, and Espinal to start the 5th…

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Need to score here … it already feels like it’s getting late.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Friedl hits one hard but it goes for naught… 1 down

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Steer comes thru with the first Reds hit of the evening…

Kevin H 08/28/2024

I would prefer to see Hinds playing everyday. I like Benson, however just not his year.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

I’m at the point where I’d like Wil better at AAA until he figures out a few things.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

He is literally lost at this point Mark. No signs of breaking through either.

LarkinPhillips 08/28/2024

Been there for a month and a half Mark. 200 ABs was enough this year. We are over 300 ABs for Will now with a sub 200 average and a nearly 45% k rate. He has to make changes. I like Will a lot. But the same old same is getting old for us and I guarantee it’s terrible for him.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Espinal flies to right … and our hopes diminish.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Smith is gonna homer this ab. Calling it

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Close lol

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Another big fat ZERO

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

No strike outs this inning, and we hit two balls hard… Improvement, if not a real momentum change.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

I was thinking same thing, and would think perhaps Reds will start to put a string of hits together. Still a winnable game

Pete 08/28/2024

I really don’t care what the Reds do but they must keep David Bell. It’s not every day you have an All-Star manager guiding your team. I would probably give an extension given that they could probably get a good deal at this point.

Rome could be burning to ashes all around him but you would never know by David Bell’s demeanor. He is the definition of calm, cool and collected.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

LOL, all star manager… honorary.

Pharmer85 08/28/2024

I thought the rationale for batting Friedl 4th-if there ever was one- was to be a kind of 2nd lead off hitter. That doesn’t seem to be his approach though. Mostly he swings for the fences like nearly everyone else. What happened to the guy who lead the league in bunt hits last year? Reds could use a guy like that

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Triple last night is looking more like the outlier. He was unlucky on that line shot. But the rest are cans of corn.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

India really picked up his game when he got to bat first, and Friedl was out injured much of the year.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

I’m still predicting a late inning rally …

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Bit of a cookie to Rooker there …

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Another solo homer makes it 3-0 … The A’s are liking it here.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

I must be getting old because I just don’t understand how all Reds fans can’t be just incensed by what they have seen so far tonight. They are playing Oakland and these games seem to mean more to the A’s and I don’t care if the Reds are out of the race with 30 games to go you just should not look this lethargic.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

the Reds run hot and cold… and you can see that in the game this evening, but it’s not over yet.

Pharmer85 08/28/2024

I think a lot of us are just beat down at this point. Been following this team since the 60s and I don’t know that I’ve ever been more frustrated. Night after night of little or no offense, poor fundamentals, etc, etc. Yet I still watch/listen. Hoping for better days ahead.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

If someone at the bottom of the order can start things off, we might get one back.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Wil Be is due …

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

or not

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

I also have seen enough of your best lead off hitter batting clean up.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Benson goes deep in the count but can’t connect well enough.

Indy Red Man 08/28/2024

Reds fever….catch it! Will they get more hits then guys announced on the IL? Riveting stuff

DaveCT 08/28/2024

Hahaha! Reds Fever …

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

And India can’t do much with a fastball down the middle… 3 outs.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Larkin is saying the fastball must be deceptive as Reds just aren’t centering the ball. Must be the case , oh and this game is gonna be over way before 9pm lol

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

If by “deceptive” he means they have zero patience at the plate and are pressing on everything … then I agree 

Kevin H 08/28/2024

LOL,

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

I’m bordering on a Clete once again. This team isn’t just flat tonight … it’s downright concave.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Uh oh, left Kelly in too long… now 4-0 A’s.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Gelof steals 2nd and 3rd… one out.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

OK to walk one if we can double ’em up … Butler at the plate.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Evan K. replaces Kelly… unknown entity to me.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Almost get the double play on the first pitch, instead another run scores … it’s now 5-0 Oakland.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

It’s another tall order for the Reds to come back this evening… We only have 1 hit on the day.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

A bit too sluggish on the turn to get Butler. 5-0 feels like 10-0.

DaveCT 08/28/2024

Not sure what I expected but Jacob Wilson at 6’2″ 190 was not it.

2024 Reds … watching the other team’s top prospects.

From BA: “freakish bat-to-ball skills.”

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Elly starts things off in the middle of the 7th… We need to get Bido out of there this inning. And Elly needs to steal a bag or two.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Manufactured that run nicely. 12-game streak for TySteve.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Awright ! back to back pokes, and it’s now 5-1.

DaveCT 08/28/2024

EDLC, thinking triple on a hard hit ground ball past 2B … the ‘privilege of youth.’*

Extra credit for the Kevin Costner movie reference.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Costner’s three baseball movies are among the very best in that genre.

Pharmer85 08/28/2024

Bull Durham my personal favorite

DaveCT 08/28/2024

This quote was actually not from a baseball movie. But yes. He completely understands.

DaveCT 08/28/2024

Bull Durham is perennial.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

And Bido is gone… MacFarland on the mound.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

10-game streak for Espinal.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Espinal’s dbl brings in Ty Steve, and now Ty France is pinch hitting for Dominic. and he singles to bring in Espy… now 5-3.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Starting this comeback a bit earlier than last night, yes?

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Here come the Reds!!!!

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

OK … NOW Wil B is due …

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Just. Like. THAT!!!!

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

And Rosario continues the rally with a single, now runners on 1st and 3rd, with 2 outs and Benson at the plate.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

ahahaha, Who said Benson was due ? Well, how ’bout one over the wall ! A three run homer !!

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

[raises hand]

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Oh hell ya!!!!

LarkinPhillips 08/28/2024

Willie B! I take back everything I said about you earlier (for tonight anyway.)

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Same!!! LOL

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

Glad to be wrong about the team’s effort tonight, very happy for Benson. Now get the win.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

India having trouble with the slider… and strikes out to end it, but still the Reds get 6 and take the lead 6-5,

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Reds put up the veteran Right Hander, Emilio Pagan… for the 8th.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Bleday singles on the 2nd pitch, a splitter.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

The only thing I found odd about that inning was pinch hitting France for Smith vs a right handed pitcher = good move but why was Smith playing in the first place.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

He was announced while a lefty was on the mound.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Kratz had a 4 pitch inning??? Right?

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Well that euphoria subsided quickly. Gonna take some magic here to stay ahead.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Oh boy … now it REALLY faded.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Uh Oh, 2nd and 3rd with no outs…

JB 08/28/2024

And just like that…..

Mauired 08/28/2024

Dollar for dollar, Pagan might be one of the worst offseason signings across baseball.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Pagan not fooling any one. Reds still in it though

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

This is just devastating for the whole team, poor job by Pagan.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

and a homerun should end Pagan’s evening, it’s now 8-6.

It ain’t over till it’s over…

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

Have you not learned anything? lol
The worse you are doing, the longer your get to pitch.

LarkinPhillips 08/28/2024

2. Bad. Teams.

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

We got a half inning of euphoria….now it’s gone.
Pagan had been good lately too.

Stan 08/28/2024

Anybody surprised by what just happened?Pagan it’s pagone.

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

+1 for Pagone

Erik the Red 08/28/2024

90 plus losses seem quite possible now. Big step back for 2025. This is more than just bad injury luck now.

Mauired 08/28/2024

And how long is Belle going to stick with this guy? Until any chance of coming back is a distant dream?

Harry Stoner 08/28/2024

Can anyone explain the sense of burning up Moll in the 4th inning when he’s been extremely successful as a setup man late in the game?

Like for instance this inning.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Nope. I stopped trying to make sense of 90% of the moves and line-ups. It just makes my head hurt too much.

LarkinPhillips 08/28/2024

Nope. Can’t explain pulling kravetz after 4 pitches either then sticking with pagan after giving up 3 runs already.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Run and hit on a 2-strike count … and India wouldn’t have gotten it anyway by my judgement.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Pagan then gives up a couple of singles… 1st and 3rd with one out… sigh…

Mauired 08/28/2024

One out six batters. Bell wake up!

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Beat the throw and then came off the bag.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

He is out. Kept tag on him

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

How much pixie dust do we have left in the bats?

I’m thinking we don’t see their closer regardless.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Agreed, we got to him last night in our 5-4 loss.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

A’s make it 9-6 on a Sac Fly double play… at least we’re out of the inning and have 2 to make up 3 runs.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

In an awful year, in my opinion, Pagan just had the worst outing of any Reds reliever all year. Especially when you consider the situation.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Well Pagan showed emotion and looked upset. That is something I guess. *shrugs *

VaRedsFan 08/28/2024

So they got the out, but that shouldn’t skew the fact that Friedl overthrew 2nd. No chance at home….why throw it that far? Guys is safe all day if he doesn’t overslide.

Harry Stoner 08/28/2024

The team is becoming unglued.

The manager is already unglued.

Any individual goof up should be seen in that context.

If they survive the next 30 games at all, it will be a minor miracle.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

Harry Stoner: You are so right, take out the bottom of the 7th and this game was awful. However all the innings count so great 6 run inning but this bunch couldn’t even get an out before it was all for naught. I agree I don’t know how they will survive the next 30 games and at this rate there is no way they can bring Bell back. I’m not sure it’s all his fault but something must be done. I personally think if they lose the next 6 he should be relieved next Tuesday for his own sake.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

And they got the out because he over slid the base.

Stan 08/28/2024

Just thinking about next season gives me a headache.More bad managing,more bad fundamentals.more bad base running and hitters that shouldn’t be in the big leagues.May become a KC Royals fan.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

No magic in the bottom of the 8th… we go to the 9th.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Diaz gets Butler for the 1st out…

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

3 pitches for Diaz and two outs…

LDS 08/28/2024

Didn’t like the Pagan signing when it happened. Like it less now. At season’s end, give him the $250k and wish him the best. Just do not bring him back.

JB 08/28/2024

I think Pagan has the option only. You know he will take the 8 mil.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

and the A’s go down 1-2-3 in the 9th…

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Steer, Espinal, and France due up for the Reds…

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Steer wanted that slider, but didn’t quite get it all.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

Kind of surprised we’re seeing Miller again after an extended inning last night.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Espinal comes thru in the clutch… one on, one down.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

I have a feeling Benson may win this game if we can get to him.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

3-2 count on French, Miller throwing fastballs and sliders. And France works the walk… Now up to Rosario !

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

2 balls to R. and 2-0 is the count. And Rosario goes down on Strikes.

Now up to Benson with 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

oops, 0-2 was the count

Harry Stoner 08/28/2024

Espinal’s BA over the last 30 games has been plummeting.

From hitting around .500 he’s regressed to hitting around .400.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Truth, he’s been a different player the last month.

Mark Moore 08/28/2024

And Wil B reverts to form …

Really shouldn’t see Miller tomorrow no matter what now.

I’ll be on the road so limited to the WLW feed.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Well one thing I will say. No quit in this team. Looking at the dugout there they all look frustrated for sure

LDS 08/28/2024

How letting Benson bat seemed like a good idea escapes me. Oh well, at least the Pirates lost.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

He homered his previous at bat… that alone would do it. Rece H. is back…

Did you notice how Miller started throwing harder as the inning progressed ? Went from 98 mph to 101.

LDS 08/28/2024

Yeah, not bad for a guy that threw 30+ pitches last night. Who knew that was even possible? As for Benson? Homering twice is unlikely. Two hits from Benson in a game is uncommon as well. Though Hinds pinch hitting was a low probability outcome as well. I guess the bottom line is that the Reds aren’t very good. The difference between Votto’s wasted career with the Reds and EDLC is that EDLC will bail on the Reds when he can.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

And that’s the old ball game… The Reds forged ahead in the 7th, and the A’s immediately responded with 4 in the 8th. At least the Reds showed some life.

Mark A Verticchio 08/28/2024

I admire that they didn’t quit but the object is to win and they just aren’t cutting it. They have 6 more at home a day off and then 2 more. My question is at what point are they forced to make a move because this is awful.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

That the Reds came back from a 5 run deficit was nothing short of awesome. That Pagan just didn’t have it and should have been taken out, that cost us.

Andrew Brewer 08/28/2024

Oh yeah, they have to face 3 batters now, and that was 3 runs already.

Pagan, Pagan, You’ll soon be gone…
