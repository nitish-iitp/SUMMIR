The Mets won one of their all-time great games on Thursday, and their big boss could not be more thrilled.

Steve Cohen, the team’s owner, posted on X in the hours after the Mets knocked off the Brewers in Game 3 of the NL Wild Card Series that he said the Mets’ dramatic win was akin to a movie.

Pete Alonso crushed a three-run homer to put the Mets in the lead in the ninth before the Mets added one more on a Starling Marte RBI single.

David Peterson, who did not have a save in his MLB career, closed out the game by inducing a ground-ball double play.

“How about that finish!” Cohen wrote on X early Friday morning. “Hollywood couldn’t write a better script . So proud of this team. Onward to Philly.”

Cohen was in attendance for all three contests of the series and was spotted with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in Games 1 and 2.

After the clincher on Thursday, Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was seen hugging and lifting Cohen off the ground in excitement.
