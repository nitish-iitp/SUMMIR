MILWAUKEE — In Game 3 of the Wild Card Series against the Brewers, Pete Alonso had the biggest hit — a home run — of his Mets career.

With the Mets trailing 2-0 in the ninth inning, New York put two runners on for Alonso, who hadn’t homered since Sept. 19. That all changed when the slugger drilled one over the wall in right-center to put his team ahead 3-2. The Mets added another run to topple Milwaukee 4-2 on Thursday at American Family Field. They will now face the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL Division Series starting Saturday.

Mets manager Carlos Mendoza predicted the big hit was coming for Alonso in his postgame interview after the Mets’ Game 2 loss.

“He’s just one swing away from hitting a big one,” Mendoza told reporters. “He’s got another opportunity tomorrow and he’ll step up.”

That’s exactly what Alonso did. With just one swing, the veteran first baseman continued the Mets’ season of hope, one where the mantra between teammates is, “We weren’t supposed to be here.” Alonso had not hit a home run in 49 at bats and he was 1 for 8 in the series entering that at bat, often looking overmatched.

The Mets were 22-33 to start the year, “Rock bottom,” as SNY announced Gary Cohen announcer would call it. But then, a slew of roster changes brought with it a renewed sense of belief. Equipped with a new anthem — Jose Iglesias’s “OMG!” — and a revamped team, the Mets were the best team in baseball over a period of four months.

In Game 3 of the Wild Card Series, the Mets showed why. Their tenacity and inability to surrender carried them over the Brewers when everybody thought they were down.

After a scoreless 7 1/2 innings, Brewers bats finally came to life against Mets reliever Jose Butto. In the bottom of the seventh inning, after Mendoza lifted Jose Quintana for the young right-hander, Milwaukee tagged him for back-to-bak home runs to take a 2-0 lead.

Butto had been one of the team’s strongest relievers this season, excelling in the role after being called up on July 2. Since then, including his two playoff appearances, Butto has allowed 10 runs in 38 1/3 innings (2.36 ERA) with 44 strikeouts.

On Thursday, Butto just didn’t have it.

Before the Brewers’ pair of home runs, Game 3 featured a pitcher’s duel between Quintana and Brewers righty Tobias Myers. Neither pitcher allowed any runs or faced much trouble.

In Quintana’s case, the veteran starter pitched six scoreless innings, allowing four hits and a walk. While Milwaukee had traffic on the bases against Quintana, they couldn’t do anything with it, going 0-for-11 with runners on, and 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position.

This was a continuation of how Quintana had finished the regular season. In his last six starts, the 35-year-old went 4-1 with a 0.74 ERA and 29 strikeouts.

Myers was also dominant in his five scoreless innings, allowing just two hits — both to Lindor — and a hit by pitch. Mets hitters also went hitless with runners on base (0-for-7), and 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position against Myers.

In the end, this game came down to a battle of the bullpens, and the Brewers, who had the best bullpen in the NL, couldn’t finish the job despite having a two-run lead with their closer in the game.

Now the Mets get to taste the champagne again. They also get to host a postseason game in Queens.

“I know (fans) are going to be rooting for us,” Mendoza said before Game 3. “They’ve been with us the whole year, and my message to them is to continue to believe.
