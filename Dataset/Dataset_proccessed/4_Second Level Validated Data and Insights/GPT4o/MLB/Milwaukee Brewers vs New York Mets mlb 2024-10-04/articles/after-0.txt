NY Mets advancing to NLDS after Game 3 wildcard win against Milwaukee Brewers
By OneAdmin
 
 

The NY Mets rallied in the 9th inning to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 in Game 3 of the Wild Card Series on Thursday night, and will now advance to the National League Division Series.

Entering the 9th inning two runs down and with two outs away from elimination, NY Mets slugger Pete Alonso hit a game-winning, three-run home run off Brewers closer Devin Williams in the ninth inning to take a 3-2 lead. Williams then hit Jesse Winker with a pitch, who went on to steal second base, at which point NY’s Starling Marte hit a double to drive Winkler home, and add another run for the Mets to give them the 4–2 win.

The Mets will now face the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS, which begins Saturday at Citizens Bank Park.
