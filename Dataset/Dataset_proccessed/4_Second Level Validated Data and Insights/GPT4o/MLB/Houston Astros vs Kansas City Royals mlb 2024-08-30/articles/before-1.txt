HOUSTON (KCTV) - The Kansas City Royals lost two of their best players on the same play in Thursday night’s series opener against the Houston Astros.

With the Royals leading 3-2 in the bottom of the eighth inning, reliever Lucas Erceg induced a ground ball with one out and runners on first and second base. The potential double-play ball was hit directly back at him on a hop, leading him to attempt to field it with his throwing hand.

The ball bounced away from Erceg, who recovered to grab the ball and sling it toward first base. There, the throw led first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino’s glove into the running lane of Astros catcher Yainer Diaz.

The Astros tied the game at 3 on the play which ended both Erceg and Pasquantino’s nights.

After the game, Royals manager Matt Quatraro said Erceg and Pasquantino were receiving X-rays after each of them injured their right hand.

Pasquantino is fourth in MLB in RBIs with 97 this season.

Erceg was making his 13th appearance with the Royals. He had a 0.68 earned run average entering the night.

Reliever John Schreiber relieved Erceg and allowed three runs to score, leading to a 6-3 Royals loss.
