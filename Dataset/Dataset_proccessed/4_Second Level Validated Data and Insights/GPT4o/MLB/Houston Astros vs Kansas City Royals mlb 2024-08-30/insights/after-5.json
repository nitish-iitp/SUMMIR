        "The Royals lost first baseman and middle-of-the-order bat Vinnie Pasquantino to a broken thumb. He will miss the rest of the regular season and could miss the entirety of a potential Royals playoff run.",
        "Without Vinnie Pasquantino, the team will need to rely even more on superstars Salvador Perez and Bobby Witt Jr.",
        "The Royals are just 1.5 games behind the Cleveland Guardians in the American League Central and are holding firm to the second wild card spot in the American League, but this injury certainly has the ability to change everything for them."
