BLUE JAYS AT RED SOX | 7:10 P.M. (NESN)
Game 133: Blue Jays at Red Sox lineups and notes
By Andrew Mahoney Globe Staff,Updated August 28, 2024, 3:50 p.m.

Brayan Bello is 2-4 with a 6.96 ERA in seven career starts against Toronto.BARRY CHIN/GLOBE STAFF

Manager Alex Cora switched up the routine on Tuesday, cutting back on the pregame work for his players. That seemed to do the trick as the Red Sox responded with a 6-3 win over the Blue Jays.

The victory snapped a four-game losing streak. (The loss in the first game on Monday is credited to June 26, since the contest began on that date, and was not considered part of the skid. But we digress.)

Coupled with Minnesota’s loss, the Sox pulled to within four games of the Twins for the final wild-card spot with 30 games remaining.

Rafael Devers was out of the lineup for Tuesday night’s win with shoulder soreness and is out again tonight.

“If he needs two or three, we’ll do it,” said Cora. “We have to take care of him.”

The couple's gas bill was as high as before they switched to electric heat. Clearly, something was wrong.
CHRISTOPHER L. GASPER
