San Francisco Giants vs Milwaukee Brewers Prediction

I’ll lean toward the Brewers. This should be a fun starter matchup, though. Peralta is doing well over his last pair, going 1-0 with just one earned in 11.0 innings. As for Harrison, he’s given up six earned over his last three starts in 15.2 innings, going 1-0 in that trio as well.

On Tuesday the Brewers coughed up two runs in the seventh inning and capped off a tough loss. Overall the pitching wasn’t bad outside of Joel Payamps (0.2 innings; two earned) during a tough outing. There were some solid contributors on offense as well. I like the Brewers to bounce back Wednesday.
