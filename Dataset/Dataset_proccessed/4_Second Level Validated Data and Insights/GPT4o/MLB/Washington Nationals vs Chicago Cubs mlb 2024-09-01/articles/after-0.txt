BN  Chicago Cubs  Enhanced Box Score: Cubs 14,....
Enhanced Box Score: Cubs 14, Nationals 1 – September 1, 2024

CHICAGO CUBS

The Cubs fell behind 1-0 early in this one. It, heh, did not last.

THAT’S ANOTHER SWEEEEEEEEEP!!!

And another blowout, too. The offense just keeps on doing its thing (against inferior opponents, yes, but that’s what you’re supposed to do!). Multi-hit games up and down the lineup, every starter but one with at least one hit, and two touchdowns worth of runs. Four hits on the day earns Dansby Swanson the Ankin Law “Making it Personal” Player of the Game honors, but a whole lotta guys did a whole lotta good today.

It was very good to see Jordan Wicks back out there, even if he wasn’t necessarily at his best just yet. You could see that the stuff was looking pretty close to OK, but he wasn’t missing bats – couldn’t get the putaway pitch when he got to two strikes – so it’s fair to conclude the command/execution wasn’t quite there. He still made some good pitches, walked no one, got some good defense behind him, and put together five effective innings. You’ll gladly take that, and I think he’ll only get sharper from here.

New reliever Shawn Armstrong made his Cubs debut with a scoreless inning, so that was nice to see. Keegan Thompson was good once again, and what a huge boost it would be not only down the stretch but into next season if he’s really, fully, finally back.

Full box score.
