        "Jordan Wicks returned from a long stay on the injured list to make his first start since June 14 and got into a bases-loaded, nobody-out jam in the 2nd inning. The lefty was able to get a double play and a fly out to limit the damage to only a single run.",
        "In the 3rd inning, Pete Crow-Armstrong advanced to third on a botched pickoff throw and was knocked in by Ian Happ.",
        "In the 4th inning, PCA bunted with Nico Hoerner on first and probably would have beaten out a good throw. But third baseman Jos\u00e9 Tena threw wildly past first base, allowing the runner to come all the way around to score.",
        "In the 7th inning, Cody Bellinger had a two-RBI hit through a drawn-in infield that second baseman Luis Garcia Jr. probably should have fielded. Paredes eventually singled him home.",
        "The Cubs scored seven more runs in the top of the 9th inning, with Hoerner plating two with a hit and Miguel Amaya doubling home a pair in the 14-1 victory."

        "Chicago certainly did what they had to do on this nine-game road swing against bad teams, going 8-1. They are starting to at least make themselves noticeable in the playoff race even if the odds still aren\u2019t great. It might get very interesting if they can keep this going, but the road will get a bit tougher after they play the Pirates at Wrigley with the Yankees and Dodgers looming.",
        "The offense just continues mashing and they took full advantage of the sloppy play by their opponents."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Wicks got almost no whiffs but he was very efficient, especially in his final three innings: 5 IP, 1 R, 4 H, 0 K, and 0 BB.",
        "PCA is becoming a chaos monster on the bases and had three more hits Sunday.",
        "Hitting second seems to agree with Dansby Swanson, who had four base hits including a double.",
        "Fourteen of the Cubs\u2019 18 hits were singles."
