Game #145 wraps up Braves for the season

The Washington Nationals had already clinched the season series with the Atlanta Braves by winning 7-games. But still, losing to them last night by a final score of 12-0 was nothing to feel good about. Poor defense started the mess followed by some bad pitches.

How can you properly evaluate your pitching when the infield defense does not make much more than routine plays? Jose Tena has an .869 fielding percentage this season at the MLB level, and has become a major defensive liability.

The Nats need to go 8-10 or better to beat the 2023 win total. How great would that be to finish in the mid-70’s for a win total? All but four remaining games are against teams with postseason aspirations — and that will make it difficult.

The Nats are big underdogs today, at +150 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $100 you would win $150. Bet $10.00 and you win $15.00.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez went to Ildemaro Vargas to pitch the 9th inning and save some of his bullpen. It was good to see Zach Brzykcy put up another zero in relief, but the rest of the bullpen gave up at least one run each.

This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward, and the plan is to get Trevor Williams back into the rotation and finish the final week-and-a-half of the season with a 6-man rotation:

Wednesday: Jake Irvin vs. Atlanta
Thursday: Mitchell Parker vs. Marlins
Friday: DJ Herz vs. Marlins
Saturday: Patrick Corbin vs. Marlins
Sunday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Marlins
Monday: Irvin vs. Mets
Tuesday: Parker vs. Mets
Wednesday: Herz vs. Mets
Thursday: Corbin vs. Cubs
Friday: Gore vs. Cubs
Saturday: Irvin vs. Cubs
Sunday: Parker vs. Cubs
Monday: Day-off September 23
Tuesday: Herz vs. Royals
Wednesday: Corbin vs. Royals
Thursday: Gore vs. Royals
Friday: Irvin vs. Phillies
Saturday: Parker vs. Phillies
Sunday: Herz vs. Phillies (Final Game of the Season)

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Jacob Young at +2.8, Luis Garcia Jr. at a WAR of +2.8, and CJ Abrams has sunk all the way back to +1.5. In total, 29 Nats’ players are in positive WAR and another seven are at a neutral 0.0 WAR.

“He didn’t pitch well. We didn’t hit well. It was kind of a lopsided game.”


— Nats’ manager Dave Martinez said after yesterday’s game
