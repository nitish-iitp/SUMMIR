Team Analysis
New York Mets

The Mets come into Game 2 with momentum after a convincing 8-4 victory in Game 1. Their offense, led by Pete Alonso’s 34 home runs and Francisco Lindor’s 33 home runs and 91 RBIs, has shown the ability to produce in high-pressure moments. With a team batting average of .246 and an impressive 207 home runs on the season, New York's offense is well-equipped to capitalize on any lapses from Milwaukee’s pitching staff.

Sean Manaea will start for the Mets. He finished the regular season with a 12-6 record, a solid 3.47 ERA, and an excellent 1.08 WHIP. Over 184 strikeouts this season, Manaea has shown the ability to dominate at times, but he has also been prone to occasional blowups, giving up 20 home runs over 184 innings. His ability to contain the Brewers' potent lineup will be key, but he may struggle to keep the game low-scoring if his command falters.

Milwaukee Brewers

The Brewers’ offense has been led by Willy Adames, who hit 32 home runs with 112 RBIs, and William Contreras, who batted .281. Milwaukee has been effective offensively throughout the season, posting a .248 team batting average and scoring 777 runs. Their ability to string together big innings, especially at home, makes them a threat to break through against Sean Manaea.

Frankie Montas will take the ball for Milwaukee in this do-or-die game. Montas struggled this season, going 7-11 with a 4.84 ERA and a 1.37 WHIP over 154 innings. His inconsistency has been an issue, and his 21 home runs allowed show he can be vulnerable to power hitters. With the Mets lineup already heating up, Montas will need to find his best form to give Milwaukee a chance to stay alive in the series.

 
Starting Pitcher Analysis
Sean Manaea (NYM)

Sean Manaea enjoyed a solid season, posting a 12-6 record with a 3.47 ERA and 1.08 WHIP over 184 innings. His 184 strikeouts rank among the top 20 in the league, and his ability to limit base runners has been a key part of his success. However, Manaea has been prone to giving up the long ball, surrendering 20 home runs, and facing a Brewers team that thrives on power could pose a challenge. His ability to keep Milwaukee’s lineup in check will be critical, but expect him to face trouble in the middle innings.

Frankie Montas (MIL)

Frankie Montas has had a difficult season, going 7-11 with a 4.84 ERA and a 1.37 WHIP over 154 innings. Montas has struggled with consistency, allowing 21 home runs while striking out 148 batters. His inability to command the strike zone effectively has led to too many baserunners, and his high walk rate has compounded the issue. Facing a Mets team that excels at taking advantage of mistakes, Montas will need to significantly improve on his regular-season form to give Milwaukee a fighting chance.

 
Recent Performance
New York Mets
10/1/24: Won 8-4 @ Brewers (NL Wild Card Game 1)
9/30/24: Lost 3-0 @ Braves
9/30/24: Won 8-7 @ Braves (Doubleheader)
9/29/24: Won 5-0 @ Brewers
9/28/24: Lost 6-0 @ Brewers

The Mets offense has been hot and cold, but their recent eight-run performance in Game 1 suggests they’ve found their rhythm. New York’s ability to pile on runs, especially against suspect pitching, makes the over a tempting play.

Milwaukee Brewers
10/1/24: Lost 8-4 vs. Mets (NL Wild Card Game 1)
9/29/24: Lost 5-0 vs. Mets
9/28/24: Won 6-0 vs. Mets
9/27/24: Won 8-4 vs. Mets
9/26/24: Won 5-2 @ Pirates

Milwaukee’s offense has shown flashes of power, but their pitching staff has struggled to contain the Mets. If the Brewers are to win Game 2, they will need a big offensive performance, making the over a solid bet.

Head-to-Head Comparison

The Mets and Brewers have faced off seven times in the regular season, with the over hitting in four of those games. In their most recent Wild Card matchup, New York's offense erupted for eight runs. Both teams have shown the capability to score in bunches, and with questionable pitching on both sides, another high-scoring game seems likely.

Against the Spread (ATS) Records
New York Mets

The Mets are 80-83 ATS this season, often struggling to cover as road favorites. However, with their offense heating up and Sean Manaea on the mound, New York could provide value in Game 2.

Milwaukee Brewers

The Brewers are 89-73 ATS, and while they’ve been a strong home team, their struggles against New York in Game 1 could continue if Frankie Montas fails to deliver. Milwaukee’s inability to contain the Mets' offense makes it difficult to back them against the spread.

Betting Stats and Trends
The over is 4-2 in the Mets’ last six games as favorites.
Milwaukee has hit the over in five of their last eight home games.
The over has hit in three of the last four matchups between the Mets and Brewers.
