Mets Lose Game 2 to Brewers as Fans Lament Missed Opportunity in 2024 MLB Playoffs

In the past week, the New York Mets have felt like a team of destiny. On Wednesday night, Jackson Chourio took fate into his own hands.

The young Milwaukee Brewers star hit a pair of solo homers, including a game-tying blast in the bottom of the eighth inning, pacing his team to a season-saving 5-3 win.

Garrett Mitchell quickly followed with two-run shot of his own to give the Brewers the lead before Devin Williams closed out the game in the top of the ninth.

In the period of a few minutes, the Brewers went from the very real possibility of being swept to forcing a Game 3 on Thursday.

The Mets, meanwhile, went from being a team that felt like it had conjured the favor of the Baseball Gods—wielding that magic to forge dramatic, season-saving victories—to one that blew a golden opportunity.

And Mets fans, as you might imagine, were going through it:

This is the life of being a Mets fan. Series should have been over tonight. Maton nonsense on top of it. Constant fan torture 😆 <a href="https://t.co/4a95bFkDe1">https://t.co/4a95bFkDe1</a>

The Mets bullpen doing exactly what I expected them to do. Great job guys 🤡 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LGM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LGM</a>

The Mets just can't make anything easy for themselves.

Things you can count on in this life: death, taxes, and the collapse of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Mets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Mets</a> bullpen

Why do I root for them?

If the Brewers were going to break their streak of losses when down after 7 innings, it would be against these <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Mets</a>. Team was out managed tonight and they paid for it. Still one to go.

Maton didn't have it. But totally not all on him! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Mets</a> had multiple RISP and did nothing. The offense failed to capitalize in a few innings. 3 runs was not going to do it! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LGM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LGM</a>

<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Mets</a> had to tack on. Not going to hold down offensive teams forever

There were serious question marks about how the Mets would fare in the Wild Card Round after playing a doubleheader on Monday with a postseason berth on the line. Perhaps the bullpen surrendering the lead was an indication of that physical toll finally impacting them.

The Mets didn't exactly storm into the postseason, going 2-4 in their final two series of the season (though one of those losses was the pointless finale of the doubleheader against the Atlanta Braves after the team clinched a playoff berth the game prior).

In comeback wins over the Braves and Brewers in the past two days, however, it seemed as though baseball magic had courted them. Chourio and Mitchell reminded Mets fans just how quickly, and cruelly, baseball destiny can change hands.
