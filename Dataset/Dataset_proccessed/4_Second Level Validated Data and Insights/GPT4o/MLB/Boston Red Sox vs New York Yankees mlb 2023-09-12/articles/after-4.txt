Boston Red Sox outfielder Ceddanne Rafaela has officially gone yard for the first time in his big league career.

The rookie, who was called up to the majors on Aug. 28, started in center and led off for the Red Sox in the second game of Tuesday's double-header against the New York Yankees. Rafaela entered the game batting .381 with an .885 OPS in 12 games, but he had yet to hit a home run to that point.

That changed Tuesday night, when Rafaela took Carlos Rodón deep for a solo home run off the light tower on top of the Green Monster. After a bat flip halfway down the first base line, Rafaela did the "Ice in my veins" celebration and pointed into the stands before crossing home plate.

The 400-foot leadoff home run came in Rafaela's first career at-bat against the Yankees, which is quite the way for the 22-year-old to make his debut in baseball's most prestigious rivalry.

Rafaela was batting .302 with 20 home runs, 79 RBI, 36 stolen bases and an .870 OPS in the minors this season before the Red Sox promoted him. The center fielder and shortstop from Curacao is ranked as the No. 3 prospect in Boston's farm system, as well as the No. 72 overall prospect in baseball.

The Red Sox currently trail the Yankees 2-1 in the sixth inning. New York won game one of Tuesday's double-header to snap a seven-game losing streak against Boston that dated back to June 10.
