LOS ANGELES — A snapshot of Cubs left-hander Shota Imanaga and Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani just before the end of the fifth inning would show them almost side by side — Imanaga in front of the mound, Ohtani jogging up the first baseline with his bat still in hand.

They faced right field, their eyes following the trajectory of Ohtani’s long fly ball as frenzied Dodgers fans cheered. It fell short of the wall, into right fielder Cody Bellinger’s glove.

In the Cubs’ 6-3 victory Tuesday, that was as close as any of the Dodgers’ top three hitters came to doing damage against Imanaga. In seven innings, Imanaga didn’t give up a hit to Ohtani, Mookie Betts or Freddie Freeman. The three runs Imanaga surrendered came on solo home runs, two courtesy of Tommy Edman and one from Max Muncy.
