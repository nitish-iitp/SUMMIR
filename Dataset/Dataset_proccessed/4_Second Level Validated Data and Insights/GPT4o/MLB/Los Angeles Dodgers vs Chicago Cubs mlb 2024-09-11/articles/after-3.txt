The Cubs staged a rally in the late innings Tuesday night to stun the Dodgers and win the series. Los Angeles suffered a defensive meltdown in the 8th while Chicago benefited from three incredible catches by Pete Crow-Armstrong in center, including a game-ending home run robbery of Max Muncy.

The North Siders opened up the scoring against Yoshinobu Yamamoto in the 2nd when Crow-Armstrong singled off the glove of Freddie Freeman to bring home Isaac Paredes. The Dodgers tied the score when former Cardinal Tommy Edman hit a solo homer off of Shōta Imanaga in the bottom of the frame.

Edman launched his second dinger in the 4th inning and Muncy made it three solo shots in the 5th as LA went ahead 3-1. Imanaga pitched well other than those three mistakes, going seven strong frames to keep his team within two runs.

The game got completely flipped on its head in the top of the 8th, beginning with a leadoff walk to Ian Happ. Closer Evan Phillips took over at that point and Dansby Swanson reached first base on a throwing error by catcher Austin Barnes. Seiya Suzuki ripped an RBI single to center and Edman’s throw to third was wild, bouncing out of play to bring home Swanson with the tying run.

After an intentional walk to Cody Bellinger, Michael Busch appeared to hit a double play ball to second but Enrique Hernandez dropped the ball. Not only was everybody safe, but Suzuki came all the way around from second to plate the go-ahead run. Nico Hoerner added an RBI double and PCA had an RBI groundout to give the Cubs a 6-3 lead.

The Cubs closed out the final two innings with a big assist from the defense and took the series-clinching victory by the same 6-3 score. (Box score)

Key Moment

The Dodgers opened the door for the Cubs in that 8th inning, but the visitors kicked it open and built up some insurance that made things a little less tense at the end.

Why the Cubs Won

The pitching and defense kept things close until they could capitalize on their opponents’ numerous mistakes.

Stats That Matter

Imanaga did a very good job in the battle of Japanese aces putting up a quality start and he deserved the win: 7 IP, 3 R, 7 H, 4 K, and 0 BB.
Just a tremendous all-around performance for Crow-Armstrong with two hits and the sparkling defensive gems.
Suzuki and Hoerner each had three base hits to lead the charge on offense.

Bottom Line

PCA is becoming a star in real time and it has been very fun to watch. The Cubs have to be thrilled with his development over the last two months and it should mean big things starting next year. If he keeps this pace up, maybe Chicago can even make things interesting here in the last three weeks of 2024.

On Deck

Chicago tries for a sweep Wednesday night at 9:10pm CT. Jordan Wicks takes the mound against Bobby Miller in a game broadcast on Marquee and 670 The Score.
