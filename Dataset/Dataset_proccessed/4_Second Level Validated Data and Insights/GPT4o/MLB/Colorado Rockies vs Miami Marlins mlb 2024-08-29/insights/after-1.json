        "Kyle Stowers: 'Now that being said, the expectation from Day 1 was to perform for myself. So I don't want to act like that's an excuse, but I'm feeling settled now.'",
        "Derek Hill: 'I could kind of tell early in the day, when we got here and got into the cage and whatnot, that everybody was just kind of dialed in and ready to go out there and compete. And whenever we go out there and compete and stick to our game plan, we do some fun things.'",
        "Skip Schumaker: 'He's swinging at strikes. When he swings at strikes, he hits the ball really hard the other way, up the middle. He's got pull-side power when he wants it. He's a good overall hitter. It's just when he's in the strike zone. I could say that about 100 different guys in the Major Leagues. Still a young guy in this league, still trying to figure out the league as well. The league adjusted. He adjusted. So that means that he's a really good athlete, because he adjusted to the league.'"
