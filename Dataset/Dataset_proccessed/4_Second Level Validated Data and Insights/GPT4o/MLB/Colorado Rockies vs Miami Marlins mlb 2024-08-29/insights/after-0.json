    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Brendan Rodgers commented, 'It was good to have yesterday off and get a little rest. I put some good swings on the ball.'",
        "Bradley Blalock reflected, 'We had a plan coming in, but it didn\u2019t fall our way. But props to their hitters. I just have to be better next time.'",
        "Manager Bud Black stated, '(Blalock) wasn\u2019t quite sharp. He\u2019s learning through these first few handful of starts about the difference between facing major league hitters and minor league hitters and the importance of every pitch counting. Not throwing a good pitch and then a poor one. The consistency of quality pitches is something that he has to continue to focus on, and it will be his challenge as a major league starting pitcher.'"
