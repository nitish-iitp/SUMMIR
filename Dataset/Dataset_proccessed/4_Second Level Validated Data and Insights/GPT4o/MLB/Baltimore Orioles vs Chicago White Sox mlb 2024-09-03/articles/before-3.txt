Chicago White Sox vs Baltimore Orioles Prediction 

Baltimore absolutely dominated game one in this series and they will look to pick up another win here. The Orioles are 40-30 at home, while the White Sox are just 13-54 at home. Baltimore has to take advantage of this series, as they are neck and neck with the Yankees in the AL East. Neither starting pitcher has very good numbers on the season, but Nastrini has pitched better in his last two starts. I don’t love this big run line, but I don’t trust Povich, so I will take the White Sox +2.5 here.
