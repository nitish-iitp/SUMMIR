New York Yankees vs Chicago Cubs Prediction

I’m leaning toward the Yankees. Probably not touching it, though. Schmidt has given up just three earned runs in 18.0 innings over his last three outings, but those were back in May.  (He’s coming off the Injured List.) As for Assad, he’s got six earned in his last 13.0 innings over two starts, going 1-1 in that time.

On Friday the Yankees scored all their runs in the third inning and let the pitching staff do the rest. Outside of that one frame, however, New York didn’t have much going at the plate. I’d like to see the Yankees bats take some more initiative in this one.
