Cubs offense has quickly faded along with their October hopes after a hot August

CHICAGO — It was fun while it lasted. An 8-1 road trip had fans dreaming that a hot August could lead to a September run for the Chicago Cubs. Instead, a roaring offense that scored runs at a record pace returned to the Friendly Confines with a whimper.

After Saturday’s 2-0 loss to the New York Yankees, the Cubs have been shut out in three of their past four games and are 1-4 to start a six-game homestand. The slim hopes of a playoff berth have all but disappeared. A team that seemed to turn the corner now looks lost.

Nobody has answers. It’s hard to explain when one watches a lineup look unstoppable one day and then seemingly incapable of even getting a runner in scoring position the next.

“You’d like to say let’s score five or six every single day,” manager Craig Counsell said. “That’s pretty hard to do. But obviously you have to create offense on a daily basis to win games in these conditions, in this environment. No runs — you gotta pitch perfect. We pitched very well today, but obviously not enough.”

That was a theme for this group in May and June and the main reason why they’ve dug themselves such a big hole in the standings. That they’ve climbed from nine games under .500 to above water is commendable. But it’s not enough.

This team has to be better, especially on offense. The way the pitching, especially the starting staff, has performed has been more than enough for this team to compete. But a lineup that scored the sixth-most runs in baseball last summer has largely disappeared this season.

The question now becomes what this front office is going to do to make sure this season’s offensive performance isn’t repeated in 2025.

“It’s a complicated season to figure out from an offensive standpoint,” team president Jed Hoyer said. “We’ve had these explosions recently. We were really good in April then we struggled tremendously, mightily for two months.”

In April, the Cubs scored 149 runs, ninth in baseball. Their overall offense wasn’t that great, though, as they put up a 99 wRC+, more of a middling group. They just stood out with runners in scoring position and it led to a strong run-scoring month.

By May, that good luck shifted and their offensive performance matched the runs scored. They were 24th in wRC+ (85) and 26th in runs scored (99). It was more of the same in June (99 runs scored) despite a slight uptick in offensive performance (95 wRC+).

In July, they started to look more respectable (110 runs scored and 101 wRC+) and August was an offensive feast (155 runs scored, 121 wRC+). Hoyer spent much of the May and June struggles talking about how the Cubs would get out of their slump. A very similar lineup scored over 800 runs last season. The expectation was it could produce at a similarly high level, if not better.

That obviously didn’t happen. Hoyer is aware of one big difference between last year’s group and this one.

“We don’t have any one player having the type of season that Cody (Bellinger) had for us last year,” Hoyer said. “It felt like at times he was kind of carrying our offense. Every big hit, he was in the middle of everything. If you prorate his numbers, he was an MVP candidate offensive player last year. This year, we have a lot of balance and we have a lot of players having solid years now that they’ve come out of their May and June swoon. But we don’t have anyone doing that. I think that’s the difference between this year and last year.”

Last season, Bellinger had a 135 wRC+ with 26 home runs in 130 games played. This year, Bellinger has been solid with a 109 wRC+, but the power has dipped and the overall production just isn’t there. Seiya Suzuki has had a similar offensive output (132 wRC+) to Bellinger’s 2023 season with less over-the-fence power. But Hoyer’s point is valid. Bellinger seemed to deliver every time men were on base and found ways to come through when it mattered most. Nobody has done that with this team this season. Not regularly at least.

“We don’t have the player in the middle of the lineup this year who is going to be a six-, seven-, eight-win player,” Hoyer said. “So we’re going to have to rely on balance more than that consolidation of WAR. For a while, we didn’t have a consolidation of WAR and we didn’t have the balance. I think we saw the results of that. Now we’re seeing the results of at least having the balance where we can score in any inning, and it makes a big difference.”

Just looking at the talent on the Yankees, it doesn’t seem like they’re light-years ahead of the Cubs. Yet they are 22 games over .500 and battling for first place. The Cubs are just two games over .500 and need a miracle to make the postseason. The big difference between the teams is obvious: Aaron Judge and Juan Soto are Yankees and the Cubs don’t have comparable offensive talents.

Hoyer seems keenly aware that his team is missing that superstar presence in the middle of the lineup. This team isn’t bad. There is talent on offense up and down the lineup, especially now that Pete Crow-Armstrong and Miguel Amaya have emerged over the last two months and Dansby Swanson has come out of his early season slump. A balanced lineup can certainly produce.

But a superstar talent can be relied upon even when others slump. But Hoyer and this front office have never shown that they’ll do what it takes to bring in that type of talent via free agency. So those who saw Soto come to town this weekend and were hoping he’d fall in love with Wrigley can likely stop dreaming. With Scott Boras as his agent and Soto entering his age-26 season, this front office’s behavior would have to shift dramatically to meet a very lofty asking price.

The good news for fans should be that Hoyer doesn’t appear fooled by one month of strong offensive production.

“We have to own the fact that we were also the May and June Cubs and then we’re also this group,” Hoyer said. “My hope is that with the emergence of Pete and Miguel and some of those guys doing that, that’s more stable. But I don’t think you can just take the good and eliminate the bad. You have to take it all and analyze it and make those decisions this offseason.”

So how does the team get better? Crow-Armstrong is likely the future center fielder. With Ian Happ and Seiya Suzuki, the Cubs seem locked in with their corner outfield spots. Swanson, who has had a much better second half, isn’t going anywhere at shortstop.

Isaac Paredes may be struggling now, but it’s hard to know how much being uprooted from Tampa Bay in the middle of the season has impacted him mentally. The Cubs are going to believe two-plus seasons of results over a poor month-plus since being traded. It’s not as if the concerns about his pull-side power not translating to Wrigley have been the issue. He just hasn’t been hitting in any fashion.

One could go around the diamond and make an argument for every player. But the reality is, after another season without October baseball and an offense that’s lacked consistency, the front office has to look for any way to improve. Players who may seem locked into a spot can’t be considered safe if a potential upgrade is available.

That’s how this front office thinks. Is Amaya’s strong performance of late a good thing? Certainly. And it will be considered. But if they can upgrade at catcher, the Cubs will look to do so aggressively. That should be the thinking for nearly every position player.

The Cubs look at the whole value of the player — “We try to think about in terms of WAR more than OPS,” Hoyer said — so defensive prowess is a factor. But it’s hard to ignore the Cubs’ glaring inconsistencies on the offensive side.

There are still 20 games to gather more information. The front office will use every bit of it as it goes into decision-making mode this winter. But barring a Counsell-led miracle, yet again, there won’t be October baseball on the north side of Chicago. Something has to change because that’s been said for too many years now.
