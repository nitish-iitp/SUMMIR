The New York Yankees force Game 5 of the 2024 World Series after defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4.

This live blog about the World Series Game 4 has ended.

What to Know
Freddie Freeman hit a home run once again to open a 2-0 Dodgers lead after the top of the first inning.
Anthony Volpe woke up the Yankees with a grand slam in the bottom of the third to make it 5-2, but the Dodgers cut into the lead to make it 5-4 after the top of the fifth.
Gleyber Torres responded, drilling a three-run homer in the bottom of the eighth to extend New York's lead to 10-4 before Aaron Judge recorded his first RBI.
No team has ever come back from a 3-0 series deficit in the World Series, but the Yankees are still alive.
Luis Gil started Game 4 for the Yankees, while the Dodgers went with a bullpen game.

The Los Angeles Dodgers failed to break out the brooms in the Bronx on Tuesday.

The team held a commanding 3-0 series lead in their World Series showdown against the New York Yankees after a 4-2 win in Monday's Game 3. However, New York avoided a sweep with a strong 11-4 win.

An Anthony Volpe grand slam was the momentum swinger the Yankees sorely needed after Freddie Freeman opened the top of the first with yet another home run.

Gleyber Torres later hit a three-run homer to keep the offensive groove flowing, with Aaron Judge also later recording his first RBI of the series.

Los Angeles still leads the series 3-1 with Game 5 on Wednesday. Here's a look back at how Game 4 played out, along with some postgame comments from both clubs:

Yankees' Jazz Chisholm Jr.: ‘We're trying to make history'
By Sanjesh Singh

The odds are against the Yankees, but they still understand what they'll have to do.

No MLB club has came back to win a World Series down 3-0, so the Yankees will have to make history if they are to shock the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Yankees 2B Jazz Chisholm Jr., who had a run in Game 4 along with a walk, echoed the desire to make history in his postgame presser.

Jazz Chisholm Jr. : For us, we're out here trying to make history right now. We know it's never been done, a 3-0 comeback.

Papi: Did he say it's never been done?

What's the record for home runs in a single World Series? Where Freddie Freeman ranks
By Eric Mullin
Here’s a timeline of Freddie Freeman’s historic World Series home run streak, dating back to the Braves’ 2021 championship run.

Freddie Freeman did it again.

The Los Angeles Dodgers star extended his historic World Series home run streak to six games on Tuesday, hitting a two-run shot off New York Yankees starter Luis Gil in the first inning of Game 4.

The eight-time All-Star, who homered in the final two games of the Atlanta Braves' 2021 World Series win over the Houston Astros, is the first player to go yard in six consecutive games in the Fall Classic overall.

Freeman made more World Series history, too, as the first player to ever hit a home run in each of the first four games of a single Fall Classic. George Springer in 2017 with the Astros was the only other time a player homered in any four consecutive games of single World Series, according to MLB.com's Sarah Langs.

What is a bullpen game? Dodgers turn to relief pitchers to clinch World Series
By Mike Gavin
Brad Penner-Imagn

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts signals to the bullpen for a pitching change against the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the 2024 MLB World Series at Yankee Stadium.

Who will get the ball for the Los Angeles Dodgers when they attempt to sweep the World Series? A relief pitcher by the name of TBA.

The actual name of the pitcher who will face the New York Yankees in the first inning of Game 4 on Tuesday was not announced until just a few hours before first pitch. The only certainty until then, in this second of potentially three straight games at Yankee Stadium, was that it would be a relief pitcher.

Yes, a game that the Dodgers hope will end with a World Series title will start as a bullpen game. Here's what a bullpen game means and how the Dodgers have fared while using them.
