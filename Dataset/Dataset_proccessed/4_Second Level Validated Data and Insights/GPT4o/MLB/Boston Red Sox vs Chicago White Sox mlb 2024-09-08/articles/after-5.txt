Red Sox allow five runs in ninth in backbreaking loss to moribund White Sox

If the Red Sox wanted to give themselves any realistic shot at making the playoffs, they had to take care of business this weekend against the woeful Chicago White Sox.

They won the series, but Sunday they let perhaps the best opportunity to gain ground they’ll have slip away.

The Red Sox gave up five runs in the top of the ninth en route to a backbreaking 7-2 loss. All of those runs were charged to Zack Kelly, who allowed five hits and an intentional walk while recording just one out, and Boston’s offense collectively went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position.

It’s only Chicago’s sixth win since the All-Star break, and with the loss Boston squandered a chance to move within three games of the Minnesota Twins in the American League Wild Card race. Instead they’ll remain four games back with two tough series coming up against the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees.

“We had a chance,” manager Alex Cora said. “It was a tie game in the ninth, we just didn’t finish that inning.”

Frustrating as the outcome was, Sunday was a memorable day for Richard Fitts, who enjoyed a standout showing in his MLB debut. Pitching in front of about two dozen friends and families who hustled up to Boston from Alabama on about a day’s notice, Fitts pitched into the sixth inning and wound up allowing two unearned runs on six hits and a walk with two strikeouts over 5.2 innings.

“It was a lot of fun,” said Fitts, who was acquired this past offseason in the Alex Verdugo trade. “Today was really special because I got to share it with my family and I’m really honored to be a Red Sox, today and hopefully for a long time.”

Cora praised the rookie for his performance and said there were two plays that stood out to him. One was when he picked off Luis Robert Jr. in the top of the first, and the second came when he started a difficult 1-6-3 double play on a soft chopper to end the fourth.

“Those two plays tells me where he’s at mentally,” Cora said. “He knows what he needs to do to compete at this level.”

The first inning wasn’t exactly a glorious display of baserunning. Following Fitts’ pickoff of Robert, the Red Sox one-upped their opponents by running into two outs in the bottom of the frame. Jarren Duran was out by a mile at home after he was sent on a double down the right field line by Wilyer Abreu, and Abreu was caught between second and third for the final out of the inning.

The Red Sox recorded a third out on the bases later when Trevor Story was caught stealing second in the third inning.

Boston took the lead in the second when Connor Wong (3 for 4) hit a solo shot for his 13th home run of the season, but beyond that the Red Sox weren’t able to do much damage against Chicago starter Chris Flexen, who came into the game on a historic cold streak. The right-hander entered the day 2-14 with a 5.36 ERA, and since he last recorded a victory on May 8, his team hadn’t won any of his 21 starts since.

The offense squandered perhaps its best chance in the fifth, when Masataka Yoshida walked and Connor Wong singled to put two on with no outs. Both runners advanced into scoring position after Casas grounded out, but neither came home to score, with Flexen striking out Story and Enmanuel Valdez to end the threat.

That failure quickly proved costly when Casas let a line drive by Zach DeLoach go under his glove for a two-base error to start the sixth. DeLoach came around to score and tie the game two batters later on an RBI groundout by Andrew Benintendi, and Korey Lee followed with an RBI single to give Chicago a 2-1 lead.

Abreu tied the game with a solo home run with two outs in the sixth, a frozen rope that looked like a liner into the gap off the bat but wound up carrying 427 feet over the Red Sox bullpen, but other than the two solo shots the Red Sox couldn’t sustain any kind of offensive momentum.

Then in the top of the ninth things went completely off the rails.

Kelly allowed a leadoff single, got a strikeout and then let the next five men reach safely. Dominic Fletcher gave Chicago the lead with his go-ahead RBI double, the Red Sox intentionally walked Gavin Sheets to load the bases and set up a double play opportunity, and then Jacob Amaya and DeLoach each singled to extend the lead to 6-2.

Kelly chalked up his performance to bad luck, noting that everything the White Sox got off him was weakly hit but found the hole.

“I don’t know if I gave up a ball over 90 (mph),” Kelly said. “A couple were mid-70s exit velo, and yeah, just unlucky and obviously I didn’t make pitches when I needed to but I’ve pitched worse than that and given up zero runs.”

It is true the hardest contact Kelly allowed in the inning was just 90 mph, but Cora offered a much more pointed assessment following the game. The Red Sox manager said Kelly’s poor outing boiled down to “lack of execution” and that he needs to become more consistent.

“With that stuff we expect more. We want him to be like a big dog in the bullpen, that’s the reason he pitched the ninth, because stuff-wise there’s not too many guys like him,” Cora said. “But you’ve got to be consistent, that’s the most important thing, and there’s a few things he needs to work on to accomplish that.”

Cora said usual set-up man Chris Martin wasn’t available because he isn’t feeling well and closer Kenley Jansen would have only been used in a save situation. Following Kelly’s outing, Cora gave the ball to Luis Guerrero, who like Fitts made his MLB debut and pitched 0.2 scoreless innings to finish the ninth, allowing only a sacrifice fly to Robert that was charged to Kelly.

The Red Sox are now one game over .500 at 72-71 with 19 games to play. Next up is the Orioles, who come to Fenway Park seeking to solidify their own position amid a heated battle for the AL East championship with the Yankees.
