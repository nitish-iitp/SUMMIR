Why the Red Sox will Beat the White Sox
The White Sox have lost each of their last 10 day games against American League opponents following a loss.
The favorites have won each of the Red Sox's last eight games.
The White Sox have failed to cover the run line in each of their last 16 Sunday day games.
The favorites have covered the run line in each of the Red Sox's last six games.
Chicago White Sox vs Boson Red Sox Prediction

Thie White Sox are going to struggle here. The Red Sox’s offense was good on Saturday and they are going to have no issue here against Flexen. Flexen in his last start was hit hard and it’s going to be much of the same here. The White Sox’s offense isn’t going to be keeping up unless they finish in double digit runs, which they won’t do. Back the Red Sox on the run line to cash here.
