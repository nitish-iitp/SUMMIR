        "Red Sox manager Alex Cora commented, 'We had a chance, right? And it was a tie game in the ninth, so we just didn't finish that inning.'",
        "Cora also mentioned, 'We didn't do much today offensively. They put the ball in play, found some holes, and obviously, the ninth inning, that happened. But offensively, we didn't do much. It\u2019s a tough one.'",
        "Richard Fitts reflected on his debut, saying, 'Today was really special, just because I got to share it with my family. I\u2019m really honored to be a Red Sox today, and hopefully for a long time.'",
        "Triston Casas reflected on a fielding error, 'Hard hit. It hit the grass and then popped up, and I anticipated the next hop being just as high, and it just stayed down.'",
        "Casas also commented on the team's situation, 'We knew September was going to be a dogfight, but we\u2019re right where we want to be. We have our backs against the wall and we have to play well for sure, but that just puts that much more focus on these types of games.'"
