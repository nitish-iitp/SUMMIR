Yankees get to Guardians ace

Within the first three batters of the bottom of the first, the Yankees already had three runners reach base safely against Guardians ace Tanner Bibee. Gleyber Torres led off with a double, and Juan Soto kept his hot streak going with a single into right.

Then Aaron Judge hit a high pop up that drifted through the air and out of reach of Guardians shortstop Brayan Rocchio, who was named a finalist for the American League Gold Glove award earlier on Tuesday.

Will Brennan flashed his leather with a sliding grab in foul ground to freeze Soto at second and ultimately halting the Yankees’ scoring in the first.

But the Yankees continued to mash in the second inning as Anthony Volpe led off with a single, followed by an Anthony Rizzo single.

Three batters in, again, Alex Verdugo doubled, scoring Volpe and allowing Rizzo to advance to third.

The Guardians intentionally walked Soto to bring up Judge with the bases loaded. Judge hit a sacrifice fly to score the Yankees’ third run of the contest. Manager Stephen Vogt’s move to walk Soto halted the red-hot left fielder, and the risk of pitching to Judge paid off with limited damage.

Bibee was chased from the game after just 1 1/3 innings, allowing two earned runs on five hits and a walk while recording two strikeouts. Bibee threw just 39 pitches. Vogt’s decision to pull Bibee early could allow him to be available if the Guardians need relief in an elimination game or if the series advances past four games.

Guardians show fight

The fourth inning brought a tense moment for Yankees ace Gerrit Cole, as the Guardians loaded the bases with one out, putting the pressure squarely on the veteran right-hander.

Cole, however, showed his poise, getting pinch-hitter David Fry to foul out on a single pitch before striking out Brayan Rocchio to escape the jam unscathed.

While the Guardians failed to cash in, their persistence in that frame hinted at what was to come.

Cole loaded the bases again in the fifth after giving up singles to Steven Kwan and Rocchio, who, with a single in the third inning, extended his hitting streak to seven games for the longest streak by a Cleveland player to start a postseason career.

Cole also walked Jose Ramirez before giving up the first Guardians run of the game on a sacrifice fly by Josh Naylor. After walking Lane Thomas, Cole exited the game.

Yankees manager Aaron Boone opted to call on right-hander Clay Holmes, even though southpaw Tim Hill was warm and two lefties were due up. Holmes allowed another run to the Guardians on Brennan’s fielder’s choice before striking out Austin Hedges for the final out of the inning.

Cole finished after 4 1/3 innings pitched, allowing two earned runs on six hits and an uncharacteristic four walks while fanning four batters. The Yankees’ bullpen allowed just one run to finish the game, permitting just two walks and two hits while combining for three strikeouts.

The Guardians’ bats came alive by sticking to their patient, contact-oriented game plan, proving they can cause problems even for elite pitchers like Cole. By working deep counts and capitalizing on small opportunities, Cleveland showed their ability to manufacture runs through smart at-bats and disciplined baserunning. Their approach demonstrated that when they play their game, they can wear down any pitcher and create scoring chances without relying on the long ball.

Baserunning blunders

The Guardians’ defense took advantage of poor baserunning by the Yankees in the sixth inning.

Jazz Chisholm Jr., who led off with a double, was caught napping at second base, a crucial pickoff that halted what could have been a big inning for New York.

Shortly after, Rizzo doubled home Volpe, who had walked earlier, giving the Yankees a spark. But Rizzo, looking to advance on a bounced ball to the plate, found himself stranded in no-man’s-land between second and third. The Guardians were able to get Rizzo out at third base, shutting down what could have been a major scoring opportunity for New York.

Ramírez is beginning to find his rhythm for the Guardians, belting a homer in the final frame before the series shifts back to Cleveland. While his bat will be critical to any potential comeback, the Guardians can’t afford to rely solely on Ramírez.

If the Guardians want to claw their way back from a 2-0 hole, they’ll need to play smart, aggressive baseball — specifically, by exposing any cracks in the Yankees’ bullpen and improving their situational hitting with runners in scoring position. Cleveland will need to play to its strengths by taking advantage of the Yankees’ bullpen and improving with runners in scoring position.

Game 3 is set for Thursday at Progressive Field with the Guardians two games away from elimination and the Yankees two games away from the World Series.
