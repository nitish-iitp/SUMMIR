The Toronto Blue Jays are turning to a familiar opener for the resumption of their suspended game against the Boston Red Sox on Monday.

Reliever Ryan Burr will throw Toronto's first pitch in the game, which resumes in the top of the second inning after rain washed out the majority of the contest on June 26 at Fenway Park. The score is 0-0.

Burr opened last Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Angels, going one inning before being replaced by bulk pitcher Ryan Yarbrough, who worked five innings.

It would not be surprising to see the Blue Jays employ a similar formula in Boston.

On Monday, Burr will replace June 26 starter Yariel Rodriguez, who is slated to start Tuesday.

José Berríos now will start Monday's second game against Boston.

The Blue Jays acquired Burr at the end of May. He was pitching for the Philadelphia Phillies' triple-A affiliate. He was with the Tampa Bay Rays in the minors last year.

Burr is 0-1 with a 5.12 ERA in 19.1 innings for the Blue Jays this season.

Catch the Blue Jays-Red Sox opener at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT on Sportsnet or Sportsnet+.
