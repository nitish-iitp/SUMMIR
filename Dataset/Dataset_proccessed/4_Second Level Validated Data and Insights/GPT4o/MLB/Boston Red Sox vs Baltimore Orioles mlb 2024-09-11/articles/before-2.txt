Will focus primarily on CF
Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said earlier this week that the plan is to keep Rafaela in center field next season "as much as possible," Sean McAdam of MassLive.com...
Impact Rafaela made 72 starts in center field, 71 starts at shortstop and four starts at second base in 2024. Center field is his best defensive position and he will no longer be needed at shortstop, provided the Red Sox get a healthy season out of Trevor Story. The Red Sox have an opening at second base, but the club wants Rafaela to focus on one position, believing his production could have been affected in 2024 because he was bouncing around to different spots. There could be a potential outfield playing time crunch on the horizon, however, with Jarren Duran and Wilyer Abreu on the roster and top prospect Roman Anthony nearly big-league ready. Rafaela might see fewer starts at that point, or Boston could reconsider using him in the infield.

Plays second base
Rafaela started at second base and went 1-for-4 with an RBI in Wednesday's 5-3 extra-inning win over the Orioles.
Impact Rafaela made his second start at second base (fourth appearance overall) and first since shortstop Trevor Story was reinstated from the 60-day injured list. At the time of Story's return last week, the speculation was the Rafaela would move to second base, but that didn't occur until Wednesday's game.

Knocks in four in win
Rafaela went 2-for-4 with a double, four RBI and a run scored in Monday's 12-3 win over the Orioles.
Impact Rafaela gave Boston separation late in the game with a two-run single in the sixth inning and a two-run double in the eighth. It was assumed he'd move to second base with the return of shortstop Trevor Story from the 60-day injured list, but Rafaela has played only center field since, while Romy Gonzalez and Enmanuel Valdez handled second. Rafaela could eventually shift back to the infield, and it would seem to make sense as the Red Sox have a several outfield/DH bats that would be more dangerous in the lineup than the Gonzalez/Valdez duo.

Starts in center field
Rafaela started in center field and went 0-for-4 in Saturday's 7-5 win over the White Sox.
Impact The return of shortstop Trevor Story was initially expected to move Rafaela to second base, but Red Sox manager Alex Cora put him in the outfield. Rafaela is fighting it right now and is 5-for-40 (.125) over the last 12 games.

Will move to second base
Rafaela is expected to move to second base Saturday when shortstop Trevor Story (shoulder) will be activated off the injured list, MLB.com reports.
Impact Second base has been a revolving door all year long for the Red Sox, whose second baseman have combined for a league-lows in batting average (.196) and OPS (.535). The position had been designated for Vaughn Grissom, but injuries, setbacks and performance in the minors prevented that plan from being executed. Rafaela, whose two-run home run was the winning blow Friday, has slumped of late, going 5-for-36 (.139) with 14 strikeouts over the last 11 contests.
