Yankees’ surge falls short after Giancarlo Stanton just misses tying grand slam in loss

Giancarlo Stanton’s blast to center in the bottom of the eighth came just short of tying the game, and the Yankees had a chance to win in the ninth before Austin Wells struck out with two on to end a 6-5 loss Saturday to the Cardinals in The Bronx. 

Still, the Yankees head into September atop the AL East and with at least some reinforcements on the way, some as soon as Sunday. 

Now, the next test begins for a Yankee team that has visions of playing deep into the postseason. 

“It’s not been easy, but we’re in a great position,’’ Aaron Boone said after the loss. “We’re sitting atop the division, [with] the best record, or right around there, in the league. It’s definitely been a grind for us. It’s right there for the taking. I’m excited for this final push and hopefully to set us up to play in October.’’

They had a chance to be in an even better spot. 

However, Stanton’s shot to dead center hit near the top of the fence and went for a three-run double, which still left them a run down. 

Juan Soto made things interesting in the bottom of the ninth with a two-out double.

One day after pitching to Aaron Judge with a runner on and first base open, the Cardinals walked him intentionally to bring up the sizzling Wells. 

Wells, who had two hits earlier in the game, ripped a foul ball down the right field line before striking out on a 3-2 slider for the final out. 

The Yankees were placed in a five-run hole early thanks to another poor outing by Will Warren, who likely won’t make another start for the team this season, with Clarke Schmidt and Luis Gil close to returning from injuries.

And when the games get really important, Trent Grisham won’t be in center, where he played Saturday so that Judge could get a partial rest as the DH. 

Being shut down for seven innings by St. Louis right-hander Kyle Gibson was somewhat unexpected, as Gibson had allowed 15 earned runs over 14 ¹/₃ innings in his previous three starts.

But left-hander Matthew Liberatore gave up four straight two-out hits in the eighth. 

The Yankees loaded the bases against Liberatore, as Judge, Wells and Jazz Chisholm Jr. all singled before Anthony Volpe’s dribbler went for a fourth straight hit and scored Judge to make it 6-2. 

Stanton pinch-hit for Grisham and St. Louis went to righty Andrew Kittredge. 

Stanton pummeled a first-pitch slider 417 feet to center to make it 6-5. 

Ben Rice ran for Stanton, but Alex Verdugo grounded out to end the inning. 

In the ninth, Oswaldo Cabrera worked a full count against Ryan Helsley, but was called for a pitch clock violation and struck out to lead off the inning.

Gleyber Torres flied out, then Soto doubled and Judge walked before Wells came up empty. 

The Yankees got off to a solid start Saturday, as Wells continued his hot streak at the plate with a leadoff double in the bottom of the second and scored on Volpe’s single to left. 

Warren got in trouble in the third. 

Nolan Arenado’s RBI single to center tied the game and Brendan Donovan followed with a three-run shot to right to put the Yankees in a 4-1 hole. 

The 334-foot shot to right would have been a homer only at Yankee Stadium, according to Baseballsavant.com.

“The [outfield] corners are short here and I was really hoping it would stay in,’’ Warren said. 

The Yankees had a chance to get back in the game in the fourth, but with two on and one out, Volpe grounded out and Grisham whiffed on a questionable check swing call.

They also wasted a leadoff double by Verdugo in the fifth. 

Mark Leiter Jr. allowed two runs — one earned — in the sixth, as the right-hander continues to be ineffective since coming over in a trade from the Cubs.
