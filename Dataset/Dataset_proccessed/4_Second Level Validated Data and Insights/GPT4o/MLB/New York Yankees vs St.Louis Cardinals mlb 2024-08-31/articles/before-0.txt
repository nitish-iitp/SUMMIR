St. Louis Cardinals vs New York Yankees Prediction

I’m leaning toward trying the Cardinals but I’m probably just not touching this one. Gibson has two bad starts (0-2 record; 9.0 innings; 13 earned combined) and one good start (5.1 innings; two earned) in his last trio. Same deal with Warren. He’s got two bad starts (0-2 record; 7.1 innings; 13 earned combined) and one good start (5.0 innings; two earned) in his last three. It’s tough telling how things will go on the mound here.

On Friday the Cardinals had a couple of bad innings, giving up three runs in the third frame alone. St. Louis did have a pretty solid offensive night, but couldn’t cash in on many of their opportunities. The Cards should be competitive Saturday, though.
