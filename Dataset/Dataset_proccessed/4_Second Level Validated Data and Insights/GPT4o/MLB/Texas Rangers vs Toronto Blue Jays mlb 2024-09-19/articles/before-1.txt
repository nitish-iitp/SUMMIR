Toronto Blue Jays vs Texas Rangers Prediction 

Texas was able to win a very low-scoring game on Wednesday night and they are looking for a three-game sweep here. The Rangers are 43-34 at home this season, while the Blue Jays are 34-42 on the road. Texas is starting Kumar Rocker, who pitched well in his MLB debut against Seattle but only went four innings. Toronto is going with Kevin Gausman, who has been solid for them this season. I am interested to see how Rocker does against an offense that isn’t Seattle’s, but I don’t think I have enough faith in him here. Take the Blue Jays to avoid the sweep.
