        "Pe\u00f1a said, 'It\u2019s great to put runs on the board. That\u2019s what we try to do. I feel like whenever we\u2019ve got a lead our pitching staff does a great job of completing the game, so that\u2019s what we try to do \u2014 get some runs on the board and let our pitching staff do their thing.'",
        "Kikuchi said, 'I got hit around a little bit today. But I didn\u2019t give up a walk and kept the team in the game, so I\u2019m happy about that.'",
        "Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said, 'We didn\u2019t execute in some critical times on the mound. We made some mistakes defensively. There\u2019s just a couple of things we can pinpoint that will show up, as it did today, with big crooked numbers and a big score against a team like this when you don\u2019t play it to the level you\u2019re capable of playing.'",
        "Astros manager Joe Espada said, 'That was the swing of the game. Driving that ball the opposite way, which is not easy in this ballpark, to go oppo like that, but I thought overall our approach was really, really good today offensively.'"
