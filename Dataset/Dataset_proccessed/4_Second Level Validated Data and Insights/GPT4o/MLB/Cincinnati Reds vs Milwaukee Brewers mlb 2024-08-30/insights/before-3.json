        "The Cincinnati Reds are calling up 2023 1st round and 7th overall draft pick Rhett Lowder to pitch on Friday night against the Milwaukee Brewers.",
        "The two teams will be playing a day/night doubleheader, but it hasn\u2019t yet been announced if he will start the game at 12:40pm or the game at 6:40pm.",
        "Rhett Lowder began the year in High-A Dayton and posted a 2.49 ERA in five starts before moving up to Double-A Chattanooga.",
        "Lowder had a dominant run starting on July 9th, giving up only four runs over a 6-start stretch while throwing 34.0 innings with a 1.06 ERA.",
        "Last week, Lowder made his debut for Louisville and threw six shutout innings, allowing just three hits, walking no one, and striking out seven.",
        "The Reds are running out of starting pitching options both in the big leagues and in Triple-A, which has led to Lowder's call-up."
