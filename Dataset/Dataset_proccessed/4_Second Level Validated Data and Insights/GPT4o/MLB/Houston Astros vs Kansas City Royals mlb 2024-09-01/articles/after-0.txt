Yusei Kikuchi struck out 12 over seven strong innings and was backed by a two-run single by Yanier Diaz and a two-run triple from Jeremy Pena as the Houston Astros beat the visiting Kansas City Royals 5-2 on Saturday.

The Astros improved to 6-0 behind Kikuchi (7-9), who recorded exactly 17 outs in four of his first five starts since joining Houston at the trade deadline. Kikuchi allowed five hits and did not walk a batter.

"He was really, really good," Astros manager Joe Espada said. "He had all his pitches working, both sides of the plate. Our starting pitching has been phenomenal for a while, and Kikuchi just adds another level of quality of starts that we’ve been getting from these guys.”

Kikuchi carried a shutout into the seventh before surrendering back-to-back singles to Freddy Fermin and MJ Melendez, with Fermin scoring on a Nick Loftin grounder.

"He got ahead, he put hitters away right away," Espada said. "Our defense was really good behind him."

The Royals' Bobby Witt Jr. slugged his 29th home run with two outs in the eighth off reliever Hector Neris.

Diaz and Pena struck the decisive blows against Royals left-hander Cole Ragans (10-9), who allowed just two baserunners and dominated the Houston lineup through five innings before coming undone in a five-run sixth.

Ragans matched a franchise record with eight consecutive strikeouts through the third, doing so after Jose Altuve drove a fly ball out to center to open the bottom of the first. Ragans struck out Yordan Alvarez, Diaz, Pena, Jake Meyers, Victor Caratini and Mauricio Dubon in succession — all swinging — before getting called third strikes on Zach Dezenzo and Ben Gamel in the third.

Ragans surrendered an opposite-field single to Alvarez in the fourth and issued a one-out walk to Caratini in the fifth. When Gamel opened that frame with a sharp single to right, the wheels suddenly came off Ragans' wagon.

Altuve (hit by pitch) and Alvarez (walk) reached safely after Gamel, and Diaz smacked a ground ball past Witt and into left to give the Astros a 2-0 lead. Pena fell behind 0-2 in the count before blasting a knuckle curveball off the wall in center that drove home Alvarez and Diaz, who had just executed a double steal.

Pena, who chased Ragans with his triple, scored when Royals reliever Steven Cruz unleashed a wild pitch to Jake Meyers. Ragans allowed five runs on four hits and two walks with 10 strikeouts. It marked the third time this season that Ragans has posted double-digit strikeouts.

The Royals have dropped four consecutive games, while the Astros have won four in a row.

In other action, Shohei Ohtani connected on his 44th home run of the season in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 8-6 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix.

The Dodgers started fast as Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman became the first trio in franchise history to open a game with three consecutive homers.

Freeman had three hits and two RBIs as the Dodgers had a 16-5 edge in hits while defeating Arizona for the second straight night. Los Angeles has won four straight games and 10 of 12 and leads the National League West by six games over the Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres.

Ohtani finished 1-for-5 with two RBIs.

The game was knotted a 6-6 the top of the ninth when Tommy Edman delivered a tiebreaking two-run single.
