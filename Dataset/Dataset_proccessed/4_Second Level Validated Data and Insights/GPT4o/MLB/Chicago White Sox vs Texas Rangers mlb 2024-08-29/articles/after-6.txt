CHICAGO — Corey Seager hit his 200th career homer and Nathan Eovaldi pitched seven scoreless innings, leading the Texas Rangers to a 2-1 victory over the lowly Chicago White Sox on Thursday.

Eovaldi (10-7) matched his season high with 10 strikeouts in his second straight win. The right-hander was working on a no-hitter before Gavin Sheets hit a leadoff single in the fifth.

Kirby Yates surrendered Andrew Benintendi’s 15th homer with one out in the ninth, and then struck out Andrew Vaughn and retired Sheets on a grounder to second for his 25th save in 26 tries.

The Rangers have won three straight and five of seven overall. They finished a sweep of the season series against the White Sox.

Chicago rookie Nick Nastrini (0-6) retired his first 10 batters before Seager connected for his 30th homer of the season, a solo shot deep into the right-field patio in the fourth. A seated Seager also made a strong throw to first on Nicky Lopez’s grounder to shortstop in the eighth, stranding two runners.

According to the Rangers, Seager became the first exclusively left-handed-hitting shortstop in MLB history to reach 200 home runs. He hit 33 homers in each of his first two years with Texas after agreeing to a $325 million, 10-year contract in free agency in 2021.

Wyatt Langford extended the lead with an RBI single off Perlander Berroa in the seventh.

Nastrini, who was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte for his first major league start since June 8, pitched six innings of three-hit ball.
