Kansas City Royals vs Atlanta Braves Prediction

I might try the Royals on a value play here. Marsh is coming off a bit of a rough outing, taking a loss versus Detroit with three earned in 2.2 innings. Prior to that however, Marsh had 10.1 innings with three earned runs on nine hits and two walks in a pair of starts.

On Saturday the Royals got a nice start from Seth Lugo (2.0 innings; one hit; one walk) and couldn’t supplement the pitching performance with the bats. I like Kansas City to bounce back Sunday, though. If Marsh can keep things manageable in the meantime the Royals should have a reasonable shot.
