Oct 10, 2024; Detroit, Michigan, USA; Rick Osentoski/Imagn Images Cleveland Guardians first base David Fry bunts in the ninth inning against the Detroit Tigers Thursday during Game 4 of the ALDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Comerica Park in Detroit.

DETROIT — David Fry blasted a two-run homer in the seventh inning and added a run-scoring sacrifice bunt in the ninth Thursday to help the Cleveland Guardians keep their season alive with a 5-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.

Relievers Hunter Gaddis (1-0), Tim Herrin and Emmanuel Clase held the Tigers to one run over the last 3 2/3 innings as the Guardians tied the series 2-2 to set up a deciding Game 5 in Cleveland on Saturday.

The winner will face either the New York Yankees or Kansas City Royals in the ALCS beginning Monday in a best-of-seven series.

Cleveland earned its first playoff win when facing elimination since Game 6 of the 1997 World Series in Florida. The Guardians had dropped 11 consecutive postseason elimination games since then, the longest such losing streak in MLB history.

Fry gave the Guardians a 4-3 lead in the seventh with a two-run home run off Beau Brieske (0-1) with two outs. Fry’s 382-foot blast to left-center came on a 2-2 count, scoring Steven Kwan from second base.

Cleveland added an insurance run in the ninth. With runners at first and third and one out, Fry bunted and reliever Will Vest’s throw at the plate was not in time to tag a sliding Brayan Rocchio.

The Tigers pulled within one in the ninth when Justyn-Henry Malloy doubled, went to third on a groundout and came home on a groundout by Jace Jung. Clase fanned Matt Vierling to send the series back to Cleveland.

The Guardians — who had 11 hits in the game — snapped a 20-inning scoreless streak in the first inning when Lane Thomas singled to right field and Kwan scored from third base, giving Cleveland a 1-0 lead.

The Tigers loaded the bases in the bottom of the second and tied the score at 1 when Trey Sweeney’s sacrifice fly to center scored Colt Keith.

Jose Ramirez belted his first home run of the postseason in the fifth inning off reliever Tyler Holton to push Cleveland ahead 2-1. Ramirez was hitless in his past 10 at-bats before launching a two-out changeup 418 feet to left field. Holton had replaced Tigers starter Reese Olson, who allowed one run on five hits over four innings with one walk and four strikeouts.

Detroit’s Zach McKinstry tied the score at 2-2 leading off in the bottom half of the inning when he blasted a 354-foot home run off Tanner Bibee into left field. Bibee, who threw 4 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 1, was immediately replaced by Chad Smith after allowing four hits and two runs in four-plus innings.

Detroit jumped in front 3-2 in the sixth when pinch hitter Wenceel Perez hit a two-out single to center off Gaddis that allowed Kerry Carpenter to score from second base.
