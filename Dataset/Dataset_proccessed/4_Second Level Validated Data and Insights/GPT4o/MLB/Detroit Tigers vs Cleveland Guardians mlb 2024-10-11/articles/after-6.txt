Guardians-Tigers ALDS Game 5 moved up to Saturday afternoon

Rainy weather has prompted MLB to move up Game 5 of the American League Division Series between the Cleveland Guardians and Detroit Tigers, the league announced Friday.

Instead of starting Saturday at 8:08 p.m. ET, first pitch at Progressive Field in Cleveland will be at 1:08 p.m. ET.

According to the Weather Network, the forecast calls for occasional showers in the afternoon and rain at night in Cleveland.

The Guardians won a back-and-forth affair 5-4 on Thursday to force the fifth and decisive game of the series. David Fry hit the franchise’s first go-ahead, pinch-hit home run to secure the win on the road.

The winner of Saturday’s game will meet the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series, set to begin Monday night in The Bronx.
