        "The Guardians forced a winner-take-all game at Progressive Field with a dramatic 5-4 win over the Tigers in Game 4 on Thursday night.",
        "David Fry played the hero role with a go-ahead two-run homer in the seventh and a safety squeeze in the ninth that gave Cleveland a two-run lead.",
        "The safety squeeze in the top of the ninth turned out to be critical, because Detroit was able to get a run off Emmanuel Clase in the bottom half of the frame that cut the deficit to one run, but the Guardians' All-Star closer struck out Matt Vierling to end the game."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "MLB and the Guardians announced first pitch will be at 1:08 p.m. ET instead of the originally scheduled 8:08 p.m. ET start time due to weather.",
        "Despite not being able to close out the series at home, the Tigers should feel very confident going into Game 5 with Tarik Skubal getting the start on full rest. The AL Cy Young favorite has thrown 24 scoreless innings dating back to the regular season, including 13 innings across two playoff starts.",
        "Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt has not yet announced its starter for the game. Lefty starter Matthew Boyd, who threw 4.2 shutout innings against Skubal in Game 2, would be able to go on full rest. Right-hander Gavin Williams could get the nod given the hamstring injury that has put the availability of Kerry Carpenter into question."
