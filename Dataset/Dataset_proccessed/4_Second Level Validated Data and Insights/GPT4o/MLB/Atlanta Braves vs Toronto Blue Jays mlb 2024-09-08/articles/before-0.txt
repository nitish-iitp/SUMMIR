Toronto Blue Jays vs Atlanta Braves Prediction

I’ll stay with the Braves, but the line’s too thick to mess with in reality. Sale is doing well over his last three starts, posting a 2-0 record. In that time Sale has just three earned runs in 20.0 total innings. As for Rodriguez, he’s given up 11 earned runs in his last 12.1 innings of work, going 0-1 in his last trio.

On Saturday the Braves didn’t play very well at all, giving up three runs in both the fourth and ninth innings. There were a few bright spots offensively but not enough to dig out of the hole. Sale really needs a lengthy outing here, as Atlanta used six pitchers in their game two losing effort. I’m staying away, but you wouldn’t be crazy to try the Jays here either.
