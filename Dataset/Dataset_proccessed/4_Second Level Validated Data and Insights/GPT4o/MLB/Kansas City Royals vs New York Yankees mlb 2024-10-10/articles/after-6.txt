One year ago today, the Kansas City Royals were in a very different place than today. Here at this site, on October 10, 2023, we got some Royals Rumblings reporting on whether or not the Royals would trade Salvador Perez. Later that day, we asked whether or not the 2023 bullpen was the worst in franchise history.

These were the questions of a 106-loss team. It was a team that rallied to a 14-12 record in September after being the 2nd team eliminated from playoff contention on August 29. And it was a team that ended its season with a 5-2 win over the New York Yankees.

One year later, those same Yankees are threatening to end Kansas City’s season again. After Wednesday night’s 3-2 loss to New York in game 3 of the ALDS, the Royals must win the next two games to keep this remarkable season alive.

The first win must come tonight, at Kauffman Stadium.

When the Royals signed Michael Wacha to a one-year deal in December of last year, I think they would lie and say it was for nights like this. Nobody expected to be here. But here they are.

Here are the lineups for tonight’s action. One game for our lives.
