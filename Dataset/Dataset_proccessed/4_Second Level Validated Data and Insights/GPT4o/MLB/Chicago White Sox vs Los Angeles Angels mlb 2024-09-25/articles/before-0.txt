White Sox fans come out to witness history as team nears record losses — but see them win instead
The White Sox faced the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday looking to avoid a 121st loss, which would’ve surpassed the New York Mets’ 120 losses in 1962.

Zachary Piech and his friends were at Guaranteed Rate Field Tuesday night for a chance to witness history.

It wasn’t for a World Series or a key playoff game. The White Sox are on the brink of owning the worst record in the history of modern baseball. One more loss would clinch that embarrassing title, surpassing the New York Mets’ 120 losses in 1962. The team looked to avoid setting that mark at home against the Los Angeles Angels.

And it was another strange night for the Sox. After a largely scoreless night, the Angels took the lead in the 7th inning and quickly made it 2-0 in the top of the 8th. But the Sox rallied to score three runs in the bottom of the eighth and held on for a 3-2 victory.
