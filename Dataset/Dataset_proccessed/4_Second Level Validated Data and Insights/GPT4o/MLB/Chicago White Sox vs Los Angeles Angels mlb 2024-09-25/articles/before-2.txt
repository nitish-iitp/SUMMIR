Los Angeles Angels vs Chicago White Sox Prediction

I’ll stick with the Angels I suppose. Suarez is on a good run over his last three appearances. He’s got zero earned runs and a save in 12.0 total innings during that stretch. As for Martin, he’s given up eight earned over 8.0 innings during a pair of losses in his last two outings.

On Tuesday the Angels only had one bad inning—but that was enough to take the loss. Hunter Strickland gave up the damage (0.1 innings; three earned); otherwise, the pitching was quite good. LA should have a good shot at bouncing back in game two.
