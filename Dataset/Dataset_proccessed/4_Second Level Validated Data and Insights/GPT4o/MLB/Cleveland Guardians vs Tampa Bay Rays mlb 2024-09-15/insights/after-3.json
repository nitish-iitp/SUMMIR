        "Manager Kevin Cash said, 'We\u2019ve been in a situation for a month where we\u2019ve needed to win every series and win some of these tight games. We haven\u2019t, but I feel like the intensity has been there.'",
        "Taj Bradley reflected on his performance saying, 'The month of August was a learning experience with bumps and bruises. Everyone has them. It\u2019s all about how you bounce back, and I think I took positives from it.'",
        "Bradley relied heavily on his splitter (34 percent usage) and fastball (30 percent), which is around his season usage (27 and 41 percent, respectively). He had six strikeouts and generated eight whiffs with his splitter.",
        "Catcher Ben Rortvedt commented, 'His fastball command got better as the game went on. He had some misfires, but those could set us up for things later in the game. I thought he did a great job.'",
        "Manager Kevin Cash said, 'It really feels like we were in every one of those games [on the road trip]. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s great to say since our goal is to win games, but we\u2019re doing some good things for some of these players who are getting their first opportunity or getting acclimated with our club. That\u2019s something we can feel good about going into the offseason.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The loss closed out a 4-6 road trip that was highlighted by a series win over the Orioles last week and a series split against the Guardians this weekend, with a sweep at the hands of the Phillies in between.",
        "It marked the first time in MLB history that a team faced off against three straight division leaders on a road trip in September.",
        "Not only are the Rays (73-77) almost guaranteed to miss out on the postseason for the first time since 2018, but they\u2019re also in danger of recording their first losing season since 2017."
