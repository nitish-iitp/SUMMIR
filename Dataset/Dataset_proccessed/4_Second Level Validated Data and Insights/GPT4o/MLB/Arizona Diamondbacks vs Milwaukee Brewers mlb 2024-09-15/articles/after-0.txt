Suárez caps 3-run rally in 10th, D-backs beat Brewers 11-10 after wasting 5-run lead, avoid sweep

PHOENIX -- — Eugenio Suárez hit a game-ending single off the right-field wall, just a few feet shy of a grand slam, capping a three-run 10th inning that led Arizona Diamondbacks over the Milwaukee Brewers 11-10 on Sunday to avoid a series sweep.

Arizona wasted a 5-0, fifth-inning lead, then overcame an 8-5 deficit with two runs in the seventh and Suárez's sacrifice fly in the eighth.

“Crazy game,” Suárez said. “They gave me that opportunity."

Jackson Chourio had a career-high five RBI, including a two-out, opposite-field, two-run triple down the right-field line against Justin Martinez that put Milwaukee back ahead 10-8 in the 10th.

While Milwaukee closer Devin Williams warmed up twice, manager Pat Murphy did not bring him in for the bottom half. Murphy said Williams had limited availability.

“If you put him in the game with no outs, then potentially he’s got to throw a high number of pitches," Murphy said. "That would have been four out of six (days) and then he wouldn’t be available for awhile."

Joel Payamps got one out in the seventh. Murphy said Payamps had forearm tightness and otherwise he would have remained in for the eighth.

“That changed everything,” Murphy said.

Chourio tripled after right-hander Justin Martinez intentionally walked left-handed-hitting Brice Turang to bring up the right-handed-hitting Chourio.

“I walked him right into their hottest hitter. That’s on me,” acting manager Jeff Banister said. “It came down to the number of pitches. Turang is a contact-type guy."

Adrian Del Castillo singled off Jared Koenig (8-4) leading off the 10th, driving in automatic runner Kevin Newman. Singles by Ketel Marte and Corbin Carroll loaded the bases, and Koenig forced in the tying run when he hit Christian Walker with a cutter.

Blake Walston (1-0) struck out Willy Adames to strand Chourio at third to get his first big league win in his fourth appearance.

Arizona (83-66) is in the second NL wild card position, 1 1/2 games behind San Diego (85-65) and two games ahead of New York (81-68) and Atlanta (81-68). The Mets lost 2-1 in Philadelphia on Sunday afternoon while the Braves fell 9-2 to the Dodgers later Sunday.

The Diamondbacks improved to 37-1 this year when taking a five-run lead. Milwaukee has not overcome a five-run deficit to win on the road since May 11, 2018.

Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo missed the game to attend a memorial service in California for former major leaguer Billy Bean. MLB’s senior vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion, Bean died of leukemia Aug. 6 at age 60. Bench coach Jeff Banister filled in for Lovullo.

Gold Glove catcher Gabriel Moreno was activated from the injured list by Arizona and pinch hit in the seventh, reaching when he grounded into a forceout. Moreno had been sidelined since Aug. 5 with a left adductor strain. Right-hander Paul Sewald was put on the 15-day injured list with left neck discomfort.

Suárez and Josh Bell hit RBI singles in the first and Pavin Smith had a three-run double in the third off DL Hall, who allowed five runs, five hits and three walks in three innings.

Chourio's 21st homer, a three-run drive, cut the deficit in the fifth against Zac Gallen and Haase hit a two-run homer off Kevin Ginkel in a four-run sixth that included a two-run double by Willy Adames, who has a career-best 109 RBI.

Sal Frelick boosted the lead to 8-5 with an RBI single in the seventh, but Arizona closed in the bottom half when Gerardo Perdomo hit an RBI single and scored on Randal Grichuk's double.

Carroll singled in the eighth, stole second, took third on a wild pitch and scored on Suárez’s sacrifice fly

Walston was recalled from Triple-A Reno and reliever Dylan Floro was designated for assignment. Floro was acquired from Washington at the July trade deadline and had a 9.37 ERA in 16 1/3 innings for the Diamondbacks.
