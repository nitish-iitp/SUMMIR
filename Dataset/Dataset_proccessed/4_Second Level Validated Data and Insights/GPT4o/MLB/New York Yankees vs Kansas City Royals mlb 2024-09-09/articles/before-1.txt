Kansas City Royals vs New York Yankees Prediction

I’ll try the Yankees here. Rodon had a rough start in a loss to the Nationals back on August 28 with five earned runs in 5.2 innings. He was able to bounce back with one earned in 6.0 frames versus Texas in his last appearance, though. As for Singer, he’s doing fairly well over his last pair with four earned in 11.2 innings but he’s 0-1 in those two.

On Sunday the Yankees gave up both runs in the first inning and couldn’t find much offense to come back with on six hits. The good news is that the bullpen was strong and only used two arms. New York will have a fresh crop of pitchers on Monday, but they’ve got to get the bats working.
