Braves’ Michael Harris II made a catch so spectacular, the winning Phillies lauded it

PHILADELPHIA — Michael Harris II made a home run-robbing catch Saturday night that was so utterly spectacular, if it had come in a postseason win it would be hailed as one of the greatest catches in history.

Seriously, it was that good.

But the Atlanta Braves center fielder made the catch — the best so far in his young life — in a 3-0 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, who pushed their National League East lead to six games over the second-place Braves.

Max Fried pitched seven solid innings for the Braves, but Zack Wheeler pitched like the ace that he is for the Phillies, limiting the Braves to four hits and no walks with seven strikeouts in seven innings. Atlanta’s best opportunity to score came on Matt Olson’s would-be game-tying homer in the sixth inning, but it was caught by center fielder Johan Rojas.

Rojas made a nice catch. Harris made a catch for the ages.

Alas, it came in a late-season loss that mattered, so there was no postgame celebration for the Harris highlight in the clubhouse. But many teammates told him that his perfectly timed, leaping, twisting, acrobatic catch to rob Austin Hays of a would-be homer leading off the seventh inning was the best they’d witnessed.

“Michael’s play was incredible,” Fried said. “I’ve never had a home run robbery while I was pitching. A couple of close calls, but nothing to that extent. I mean, the way that he slowed down to time it, and to do all that in one motion, it’s special. He’s incredible out there.

“Probably the best catch that I’ve had behind me, for sure.”

Guys on the other side had similar opinions of what they saw.

“Unbelievable,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “The Harris catch is one of the best catches you will ever see in this game. I couldn’t believe that he came up with it.”

Several longtime Phillies press-box observers said it was the best catch they’d seen at Citizens Bank Park since it opened in 2004. The Phillies have seen Harris rob them of extra-base hits, though never with quite this degree of difficulty.

In fact, no one had seen him make a catch quite as good as this. Harris confirmed as much when the 23-year-old was asked where he’d rank the catch at any level he’s played, from childhood to MLB, the Atlanta-area native’s third season in the majors.

“I’d say (number) one,” he said, pausing to think about it for a moment. “Probably one. Yeah. Because I had to actually go over the wall to get it, so probably one.”

He smiled and added, “I’ve had some over the past couple of years that I wanted to bring back and couldn’t. That was good to get that one and make it to the top of my board.”

Oh, he brought it back all right. His glove and arm were extended past the fence before Harris’ body, bent at the waist over the top of the fence-top padding, recoiled in a supremely athletic motion as he bounced back onto the field, never losing his footing, and raised the glove to show it held the ball.

Hays had rounded first base and, realizing Harris made the catch, smiled and threw his hands in the air.

“That was crazy,” said Phillies reliever Jeff Hoffman, who was warming in the bullpen beyond right-center field and was closest to the play, maybe 10 yards away, when it happened. He was among several relievers who raised hands in the air and/or could be seen in the TV shot mouthing words of astonishment.

“We have a weird, coincidental ability to hit the ball in perfect spots for him to make plays like that,” Hoffman said. “It’s gotten old. (He smiled.) But, I mean, it’s so much fun to watch guys that can do that. Like, bring that level of athleticism to our game. Because how much do you really get to show something like that in our game? That’s real athletic ability.

“It was a great view. I just wish he missed it. I wish it was hit another six inches.”

Hoffman and most other Phillies relievers saw the top half of Harris’ body rise above and over the fence, and his momentum carried his arm over and down with the ball before he pulled it back, the ball inside his glove, the padding atop the fence serving almost as a springboard as Harris dropped back with his feet on the warning track.

Hays had connected with a first-pitch curveball on the outer edge of the plate, driving it at 103 mph off the bat on a high 37-degree arc just to the right of straightaway center. Initially, it looked like an out to the warning track, but the ball carried and carried.

“I was running with the ball and then, I guess a few steps before the wall, I kind of took a peek at it to see where I was at,” said Harris, who slowed for a moment before he got to the warning track, making sure he had his steps right as he neared the wall. “I tried to time it perfect to get up and get a glove on it.”

The hang time of the ball gave Harris time to size it up as he went back, and he timed his leap perfectly. It’s a relatively low fence in center, only 6 feet, and Harris, a left-hander, looked over his right shoulder while racing toward it, tracking the ball all the way, even as he jumped.

He put out his left hand to stabilize himself before impact, thrust his right arm and glove above and beyond the padded top of the fence, and snagged the ball, pulling it back from its downward path, to the surprise of Phillies relievers who had the best view in the sold-out stadium.

Harris was asked what it felt like to realize he’d caught the ball and held on.

“Initially it was one of those feelings like when you’re hitting and you don’t feel (a homer) off the bat,” he said. “It hit perfect in the web, and as I was coming back from the fence, I saw the Phillies pitchers in awe. That’s when I really knew I caught it. So it was pretty cool to make that catch and then (also) have some Phillies fans, even though we have the rivalry, give me a hats-off and applause.

“It didn’t really kick in until I saw their (relievers’) faces. I knew I had made contact with it, and then when (I) squeezed and felt some weight in there, I knew it was in there.”

Brian Snitker has seen a lot of great outfielders in his 4 1/2 decades of coaching and managing in the Braves’ minor-league system and the major-league team. He knows when he sees something special, a play by someone who’s got a gift few others do.

“That’s feel and God-given stuff that those kind of players have, quite honestly,” Snitker said of Harris’ catch. “It’s nothing you work on; you don’t teach that. It’s a God-given ability to do that, instinct and the whole thing. He helped us win a game in Minnesota (last week) with a play like that, when he came off the bench and made probably a game-saving play then. He’s must-see TV, I tell you that.”
