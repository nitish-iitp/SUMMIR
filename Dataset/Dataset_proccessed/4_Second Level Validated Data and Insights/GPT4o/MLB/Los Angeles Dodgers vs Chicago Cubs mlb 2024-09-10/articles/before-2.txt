LOS ANGELES — Cubs rookie Michael Busch sped toward second base, uncertain where exactly his opposite-field line drive had landed.

It had, in fact, cleared the short fence in the left-field corner, flown between a fan’s hands, hit him in the chest and bounced back onto the field. It was the second Cubs homer of the game, both hit by former Dodgers, and one of four hits from Busch to help power the Cubs to a 10-4 victory Monday night.

“It’s always a weird feeling,” said Cody Bellinger, who hit a two-run homer as part of a three-RBI night. “[Busch] knows a lot of the guys on the other side, as well. And it just shows how good he is. He can kind of lock it in when there’s extra things going on.”
