Toronto Blue Jays vs Atlanta Braves Prediction

I’ll lean toward the Braves. Schwellenbach isn’t pitching too badly these days. Over his last three outings, Schwellenbach is 1-0 with four earned in 17.0 total innings on 13 hits and five walks. A quality start would go a long way here.

On Friday the Braves didn’t notch the prettiest win in the world, but it worked. The pitching staff was the real hero, giving up seven hits, one walk, no earned, and 11 strikeouts. If Schwellenbach can keep the run going, the Braves bats should be able to do the rest.
