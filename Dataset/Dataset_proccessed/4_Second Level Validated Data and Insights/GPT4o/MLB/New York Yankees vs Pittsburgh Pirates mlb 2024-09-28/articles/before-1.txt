The Yankees have clinched the AL East title and are closing in on home-field advantage through the ALCS. 

Though they fell to the Pirates, 4-2, on Friday night in The Bronx, Jazz Chisholm Jr. announced the team’s lofty expectations once they get to October. 

“This was their goal all season, to get to the World Series, not just the playoffs,’’ Chisholm said. “This is only one stop and I feel in everybody’s heart in this clubhouse, we don’t think our stop is now. We’re not stopping ’til we get that ring.”

They’re in prime position to get it, with Gerrit Cole pitching like an ace of late and Friday’s starter, Carlos Rodon, looking like a weapon for the postseason, as well. 

Rodon’s turnaround from last season’s disaster has been one of the keys to the Yankees putting 2023 behind them and he was solid again against the Pirates.

The lefty didn’t allow a run until Nick Gonzalez and Bryan Reynolds hit back-to-back homers to open the sixth, wiping out the Yankees’ 2-0 lead that had been supplied by a two-run Chisholm single in the fifth. 

With the game tied in the eighth, Tommy Kahnle gave up a go-ahead, two-run homer to Reynolds and the Yankees couldn’t rally. 

Their primary directive over the next week, though, is setting themselves up as well as possible for the ALDS, with Cole set to pitch Game 1 and Rodon perhaps in Game 2.

Rodon ended last year in disarray, with questions surrounding whether he could survive in New York. 

He’s been dependable throughout this year and now wants more. 

“It’s gonna be really fun to start here in The Bronx,” Rodon said of the postseason. “It’s gonna be electric. … We’re going to the postseason. That’s way different than last year.”

The Yankees are still a bit of a work in progress, however, as Jasson Dominguez started again in left field and they rested Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Austin Wells and Anthony Rizzo. 

The night got off to a promising start as Rodon — setting a career high with his 32nd start of the year — pitched out of trouble in the first on his way to holding the Pirates scoreless through five. 

Rodon was aided by two fantastic running catches on deep fly balls to center by Trent Grisham, both off the bat of Nick Yorke, as well as Jose Trevino throwing out a pair of would-be base-stealers.

After Chisholm gave the Yankees the lead in the fifth, the Yankees loaded the bases later in the inning, but Alex Verdugo popped out to center and Anthony Volpe’s rocket went right to Billy Cook in center to keep it a two-run game. 

And then Rodon faltered in the sixth and Kahnle two innings later. 

But it did nothing to shake their confidence with the playoffs around the corner and their first World Series title since 2009 on their mind.

“That’s what I’ve been hearing since I got here and how I feel, too,’’ said Chisholm, who has provided a spark since arriving from Miami prior to the trade deadline.

“I’m super excited to go into war with these guys, knowing we’ve got the best talent in the league and I feel like we have the best teamwork and togetherness. I feel like we’re gonna be unstoppable.” 

One more win, or a loss by Cleveland, will give the Yankees home-field advantage at least through the ALCS, which would only help Chisholm’s pursuit.
