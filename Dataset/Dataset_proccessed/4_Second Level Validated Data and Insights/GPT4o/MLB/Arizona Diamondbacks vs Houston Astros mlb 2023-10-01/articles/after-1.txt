MLB Playoffs 2023: Full Schedule, TV Info, Dates for Entire World Series Bracket

The MLB postseason bracket is officially set.

All participants had secured a spot by Saturday night, but Sunday's action had quite the impact on seeding.

The Texas Rangers needed a victory or a Houston Astros loss to secure the AL West, but the Seattle Mariners played spoiler, taking down the Rangers 1-0. That opened the door for the Astros, who defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks to claim their sixth division title in seven seasons.

As a result, the defending World Series champs will have an automatic berth in the ALDS.

Here is how the seeding finished.

American League

1. Baltimore Orioles

2. Houston Astros

5. Texas Rangers

6. Toronto Blue Jays

The National League was much more set going into the final day, with all division winners and the top wild-card spot secured. The only loose end to tie up was who was traveling where for the Wild Card Round, and the Marlins were able to hold on to the fifth seed despite a loss in the final game.

Here is how the seeding finished.

National League

1. Atlanta Braves

2. Los Angeles Dodgers

3. Milwaukee Brewers

4. Philadelphia Phillies

5. Miami Marlins

6. Arizona Diamondbacks

With all of this now settled, the Wild Card Round may commence. Minnesota will host Toronto and Tampa Bay will host Texas in the AL, while Milwaukee will host Arizona and Philadelphia will host Miami in the NL.

The best-of-three series will determine who survives to the Division Series, and here is a look at the postseason schedule through the World Series.

The Astros were clearly the biggest winners of the weekend, as they were in danger of missing the playoffs a few days ago. Now they will be able to rest up before a home Game 1 on Oct. 7.

Still, the Orioles, Dodgers and Braves will also reap the benefits of the bye, and they have had more time to prepare for it. Texas will now have to salvage the season against a Rays team that would have won three of the six divisions in MLB.

Toronto will visit a Twins team that had a worse record on the season, while Miami will look to build on a postseason push and end a division rival's quest at a return to the World Series. The Marlins have never lost a playoff series in a 162-game season, so history could be on their side.

It should be an exciting postseason, and the 12 teams remaining all have a true case to chase a World Series championship.
