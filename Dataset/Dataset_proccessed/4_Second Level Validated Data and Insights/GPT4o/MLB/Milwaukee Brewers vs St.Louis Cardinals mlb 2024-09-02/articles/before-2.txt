Game Summary

The St. Louis Cardinals will face off against the Milwaukee Brewers on September 2, 2024, at American Family Field in Milwaukee at 2:10 PM EDT. This matchup is vital for both teams as they navigate through the final stretch of the regular season. The Cardinals currently sit third in the NL Central with a record of 69-68, while the Brewers lead the division at 80-57.

In their last encounter, the Cardinals showcased an impressive offensive display, led by Jordan Walker's five-hit game in a 14-7 victory over the New York Yankees. This performance highlights the Cardinals' potential to generate runs, making them a dangerous opponent.

Historically, this season has seen the Brewers hold a 7-3 advantage over the Cardinals in their head-to-head matchups. Milwaukee's home record stands strong at 40-25, and they are particularly effective when hitting multiple home runs, boasting a 30-8 record under such circumstances.

Recent performances indicate that the Brewers have a .257 batting average with a 2.86 ERA over their last ten games, while the Cardinals have fared slightly better at .290 with a 4.40 ERA. These statistics suggest a competitive game ahead, with both teams capable of making an impact at the plate.

As for the starting pitchers, we have Andre Pallante for the Cardinals with a record of 6-6 and a 3.80 ERA, while Freddy Peralta will take the mound for the Brewers, holding a 9-7 record and a 3.70 ERA. Both pitchers have shown resilience, and their performances will be critical in determining the game's outcome.

Player Prop Odds
Batter Hits: Over 0.5 (-170.0)
Batter RBIs: Over 0.5 (160.0)
Batter Runs Scored: Over 0.5 (100.0)
Batter Singles: Over 0.5 (110.0)
Batter Total Bases: Over 1.5 (150.0)

Player Analysis: Rhys Hoskins

Rhys Hoskins has been a pivotal player for the Cardinals this season, demonstrating a solid batting average and consistent power. His ability to get on base and drive in runs makes him a key figure in the Cardinals' offensive lineup.

This season, Hoskins is hitting .262 with 24 home runs and 75 RBIs. His on-base percentage of .360 and slugging percentage of .510 highlight his capability to impact the game positively. In recent games, he has shown improvement, particularly against right-handed pitchers like Freddy Peralta, who he will face today.

Against right-handed pitchers this year, Hoskins boasts a .270 batting average, which is impressive. His ability to hit for power while maintaining a decent contact rate makes him a prime candidate for the Over on several props today.

Opposing Analysis: Milwaukee Brewers

The Brewers' pitching staff has been effective this season, but they have shown vulnerabilities, especially against hitters with power. Freddy Peralta, while having a solid season, has given up significant home runs, allowing 22 in 148.1 innings pitched. This could play into Hoskins' favor as he aims to capitalize on any mistake pitches.

Additionally, the Brewers' bullpen has struggled at times, especially late in games, which presents opportunities for Hoskins to drive in runs or score if he gets on base early in the game.

Prop Analysis

Given Hoskins' current form and the matchup against Peralta, the "Batter Hits" prop at Over 0.5 seems highly favorable. With a -170 line, the expectation is that he will at least get one hit, given his recent performance and the Brewers' pitching style.

The RBI prop at Over 0.5 also aligns well with his role in the lineup. If he can get on base, there is a strong chance he can drive in a run due to the Cardinals' offensive capabilities. Similarly, the Runs Scored prop at Over 0.5 is a good bet, as he is likely to cross home plate if he is productive against Peralta.

Lastly, the Total Bases prop at Over 1.5 is another strong consideration since Hoskins has the potential to hit for extra bases, especially if he can connect against Peralta's fastball.

Starting Pitching Summary - Cardinals

Andre Pallante will start for the Cardinals. He has a 6-6 record with a 3.80 ERA and 68 strikeouts over 92.1 innings pitched. Pallante has been relatively consistent, allowing an average of 3.73 runs per game. His ability to manage the game and limit damage will be crucial against a Brewers lineup that can score in bunches.

Starting Pitching Summary - Brewers

Freddy Peralta takes the mound for the Brewers, sporting a 9-7 record and a 3.70 ERA. Peralta is known for his strikeout potential, amassing 172 strikeouts in 148.1 innings. However, he has also allowed a considerable number of home runs, which could be a factor for Hoskins' prop performance today.

Bullpen Summary - Cardinals

The Cardinals' bullpen has had its ups and downs this season, but they rank in the top tier for save conversions. Their ability to close out games will be tested today, especially if Pallante can keep the game close. They hold a collective ERA of 4.17, which could be a concern if the game becomes a high-scoring affair.

Bullpen Summary - Brewers

The Brewers' bullpen has been solid, ranking among the best in the league for save percentages. However, they have shown some vulnerability in high-pressure situations. If the game is close late, it will be interesting to see how they perform under pressure, especially if Hoskins is in a position to drive in runs.

Team Previews

The Cardinals have a solid batting lineup, ranking fifth in runs scored this season. Their ability to generate offense will be key against the Brewers' pitching staff. With players like Hoskins and Walker providing firepower, they can challenge any pitching staff. Defensively, they rank ninth in team ERA, which indicates they can hold leads effectively.

The Brewers, on the other hand, have a slightly weaker batting average at .249, ranking 12th in the league. However, they possess the ability to hit home runs and have a strong bullpen. Their success will hinge on the performance of Peralta and his ability to keep the Cardinals' bats at bay.
