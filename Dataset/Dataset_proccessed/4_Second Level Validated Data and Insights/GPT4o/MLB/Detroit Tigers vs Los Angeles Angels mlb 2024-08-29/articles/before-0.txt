LA Angels vs Detroit Tigers Prediction 

Detroit was able to pick up another win on Tuesday night and they have been one of the best teams in the MLB over the last two months. The Tigers are 33-32 at home this year, while the Angels are 27-39 on the road. Los Angeles has been awful over the last few weeks and they are starting Kochanowicz, who has been better recently, but has bad numbers on the season.

Detroit is starting Montero, who has bounced back from a very bad start to his year. These two teams are trending in opposite directions and all of a sudden, the Tigers are right back in the Wild Card race. Take Detroit to win by at least two runs here.
