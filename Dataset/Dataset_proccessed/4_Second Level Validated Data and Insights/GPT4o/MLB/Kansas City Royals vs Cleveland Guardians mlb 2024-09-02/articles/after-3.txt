Cleveland Guardians vs. Kansas City Royals, Sept. 2, 2024
By Joe Noga, cleveland.com

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Royals look a little different since they left Cleveland last week, and maybe so do the Guardians.

After winning three out of four games against the Guardians at Progressive Field, Kansas City added three veteran players via waiver claims. Two of them faced Cleveland on Monday, but it was the Guardians’ trade deadline acquisition that made the biggest difference in a 4-2 win against the Royals at Kauffman Stadium.

Cleveland’s lineup looks a little different in its own way when Lane Thomas is swinging the bat effectively. Thomas and All-Star mainstay Josh Naylor provided the Guardians all the offense they would need with a pair of two-run home runs as they added to their advantage over KC in the American League Central Division.

Thomas delivered his first home run in a Cleveland uniform, a two-run blast off Michael Wacha in the fifth that erased a Royals lead and put the Guardians in front, 2-1. Josh Naylor added a two-run shot of his own in the sixth after José Ramírez reached on an infield single.

After hitting just .143 in 27 August games, Thomas has five hits in two September contests. Manager Stephen Vogt said Thomas has been swinging the bat well the last few games and looks like he is getting timed back up against fastballs.

“He’s getting more aggressive, which is great and aggressive to good pitches,” Vogt said. “It was nice to see that one carry out of the yard. Big momentum for us, and obviously a nice pressure release for him.”

Thomas said all he wants to do is contribute to Cleveland’s success.

“It was nice to put a few runs on the board and give Gavin (Williams) a little support there and get him the win,” Thomas said.

Cleveland’s bullpen got the ball to Emmanuel Clase in the ninth after Williams turned in seven strong innings for his third win. Clase earned his 41st save of the season with a 1-2-3 ninth inning. He has converted his last 28 consecutive save opportunities.

Cleveland has won four of its last five and moved 4 1/2 games ahead of the Royals in the AL Central standings. Second-place Minnesota trails the Guardians by 3 1/2 games after a 5-4 win at Tampa Bay.

Cleveland’s magic number to clinch the division is at 22 with 24 games left. The magic number to clinch a playoff spot is 16 over Boston.

Naylor entered the game with nine hits in his last 17 at-bats over a stretch of four games. That included three doubles and six RBI. He drove a 1-0 fastball from Royals lefty Kris Bubic into the seats in right center for his 29th home run, giving the first baseman 100 RBI for the first time in his career.

Thomas, who struggled at the plate for most of August after being acquired from Washington on July 30, entered the game hitting .364 over his previous nine. He took Wacha deep with Jhonkensy Noel aboard for his ninth home run in the fifth on a 1-0 cutter over the middle of the plate. Thomas added a double in the ninth for his first multi-hit game since Aug. 7.

Williams allowed a run in the second inning when Yuli Gurriel walked with two out and moved into scoring position on a wild pitch. Maikel Garcia’s double into the left field corner scored Gurriel, who was one of KC’s waiver pickups after leading RBI man VInnie Pasquantino suffered a broken thumb over the weekend in Houston.

But Williams settled in after the Garcia double and retired the next 16 consecutive batters he faced. He needed just eight pitches to get through the third inning as the top of Kansas City’s lineup was no match for his fastball, which averaged 96.8 mph for the day. Williams struck out seven and walked one, completing a season-high seven innings.

Vogt said it looked like Williams was fighting himself through the first couple of innings and not getting down the mound effectively. After a talk with pitching coach Carl Willis, Williams appeared to make the adjustment.

“Carl talked with him after the second inning and he got back on line,” Vogt said. “What a performance. It was much needed for him, for us. He just made that adjustment, getting down the mound in a good direction.”

Williams said he has tended to pull pitches across his body lately, but on Monday he was able to turn things around.

“I just fell out the zone really,” Williams said. “Just talking with Bo (Naylor) and having a better plan, seeing the way (Royals hitters) took different pitches. They know what I’ve got. They just attack the first pitch, really. So it’s about keeping them off balance.”

Cade Smith took over in the eighth, and surrendered a leadoff double to Gurriel, who left the game with a sore hamstring after hobbling to the bag. But Guardians rookie right fielder Jhonkensy Noel made a diving catch on a sinking line drive by Garcia that appeared headed for extra bases in the gap. Kyle Isbel eventually drove in pinch runner Freddy Fermin with a sacrifice fly to center, but Noel’s catch helped curb a Royals rally.

“If that ball gets down, it’s a completely different inning, completely different game,” Vogt said. “Huge catch by Jhonkensy.”

Noel said the wind was bringing fly balls back toward the field, and that gave him confidence to go get it. He said, via Guardians interpreter Agustin Rivero, that he is happy to be contributing in the middle of the order in September on a team in a pennant race.

“It doesn’t matter what part of the order, as long as I’m able to help and help the team win,” Noel said. “I put the work to be in that position, but what matters more than anything is that I can help the team win.”

Cleveland moved to 28-33 overall since June 26 after starting season 51-26. The club is 21-22 since All-Star Break. The Guards are now 8-8 on the road in the second half after going 28-26 on road in before the All-Star break.
