On Tuesday, Nick Castellanos got mad.

On Wednesday, he got even.

One day after Rays pitcher Edwin Uceta hit Castellanos with a 96 mph sinker and ignited a benches-clearing altercation, the Phillies outfielder hit a two-run homer in a 3-2 Phils win. Zack Wheeler picked up his 15th win, the Phillies finished off a series sweep, and the team's magic number to clinch the division dropped to 9.

Here's the Castellanos bomb, with Nick Piccone adding audio from the Rays' radio network:

How Nick Castellanos' 1st inning dinger sounded on Rays radio, brought to you by Spectrum. They built the network you need for whatever future you want. TV, internet, voice, and mobile. Spectrum dot com today to learn more. Oh they're already... all right so that took 2 seconds pic.twitter.com/EcW4CNk4sq

That's a pretty good way to get some revenge.

According to https://t.co/vTNbPRILIt, The pitch Uceta threw to hit Castellanos was the hardest throw of his MLB career. https://t.co/72aAWv0TPz

Will the Rays never learn? (Ok, this one was unintentional.)

Zack Wheeler just allowed a leadoff triple then proceeded to strike the next three batters out. Insane.

Wheeler didn't have everything working, but there were still enough pitches in his repertoire to keep hitters guessing:

The NL CY Young race between Zack Wheeler (15-6, 2.60 ERA) and Chris Sale (16-3, 2.38 ERA) is down to the wire

Smell ya later, Tampa. The Phillies are off on Thursday before beginning a three-game home series against the Mets this weekend. They'll have a chance to pretty much put the division away.

Anyway, here's this:
