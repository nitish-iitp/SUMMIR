José Alvarado, still in the fight, looks refreshed for Phillies with October on horizon

PHILADELPHIA — José Alvarado spent a week at home in Venezuela last month and when he returned to the Phillies clubhouse, he had something new to decorate the vacant locker adjacent to his. He hung two Cleto Reyes red boxing gloves. They were a gift from a friend. Alvarado, who has declined to share specifics about the personal issue that forced him to leave the Phillies, said the gloves have no special meaning.

Then, the lefty reliever raised his fists to mimic a boxer.

Keep fighting.

“I’ve never given up,” Alvarado said through a team interpreter Wednesday night after another scoreless inning in a 3-2 Phillies win over the Tampa Bay Rays. “I’ve always said, ‘It’s not how we start. It’s how we finish.’ … My mentality is just going out and competing and not worrying about all the things that I can’t control.”

The Phillies are close to their first division title in 13 years — the magic number is nine — and every night now is about avoiding further injuries while thinking about more things in an October context. Manager Rob Thomson summoned Alvarado in the eighth inning for the second straight night. Alvarado recorded three outs on seven pitches.

He’s had five scoreless outings this month since returning to the roster.

“He’s just pitching free,” Thomson said. “Nothing’s on his mind. He’s good. Whatever the problem was, he took care of it. He’s relaxed and he’s just getting after it. He looks like the real Alvy.”

It’ll take more convincing than five September outings. But, come October, Alvarado is not someone the Phillies expect to pitch the ninth inning — or even the eighth. He might be their fifth reliever on the trust tree, which is a luxury when that guy can throw 95 mph cutters with his left arm.

Even while they went through their summer lull, the Phillies have always operated on this premise: They’ll take their 18 best players and match them against just about anyone in the postseason. That is easier to say if they can trust Alvarado in the middle of a playoff game against a pocket of lefty hitters.

“When he’s confident and he’s attacking the zone,” Nick Castellanos said, “his stuff is as good as anybody in baseball.”

Alvarado’s seven pitches Wednesday night were the second-fewest he’s ever needed to pitch a full inning. That is notable, considering Alvarado’s penchant for deep counts. His pitch counts in five innings this month: 14, 17, 15, 14, 7. He’s walked only one hitter.

He started the first hitter, Junior Caminero, with two cutters for balls Wednesday night. He fired a fastball down the middle. Caminero was late and skied it to right field. Alvarado induced a first-pitch foul out. Then he struck out Dylan Carlson on three heaters. The Rays had three righty hitters to face Alvarado, who has struggled against them all season, and he passed.

The night before, Alvarado’s cutter had more life. “I think the cutter’s back,” catcher Garrett Stubbs said. It is less about the velocity, Stubbs said, and more about the movement. The shape is better. Alvarado has some depth back to his cutter along with horizontal movement.

It’s the pitch that resurrected Alvarado’s career two years ago. It is important to his success. Stubbs loved the one Alvarado threw Tuesday night to José Caballero, who whiffed at it.

“It just goes straight down,” Stubbs said. “He’ll throw some that don’t go directly down, but they’re still good. That’s the game-changer.”

Stubbs paused.

“And throwing strikes,” he said.

Alvarado is an emotional person who has worked to sharpen his mind. His outlook on baseball — and pitching — has evolved. Surrendering a prodigious home run in Game 6 of the 2022 World Series might have broken him earlier in his career. He vowed not to let it define him. He was better last postseason but allowed a run in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series.

He did not exude confidence this summer. There might have been other things on his mind.

“It’s so much different when you go out and just focus on competing,” Alvarado said. “Not worry too much about those things that you can’t control. And I know that I came from a rough stretch of bad outings. But I think that we just left that behind now.”

He added: “It’s all different when you go out and not think about those things. And now I know what to do. I know who I am.”

The Phillies expect to use Alvarado in the sixth and seventh innings come October — just as they have in previous postseasons. They are excited about the recent progress from Carlos Estévez, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm and Orion Kerkering. By having Estévez in the ninth, they can deploy Hoffman in the stickiest situations earlier in the game. Kerkering has hit another gear in the last three weeks. Strahm remains someone Thomson trusts in any situation.

This current version of Alvarado would complete the bullpen picture. He’s looked more confident.

“Maybe a little reset,” said Zack Wheeler, who allowed two runs in six innings. “I don’t know. You have to ask him. But it looks fantastic. It looks like Alvarado.”

Ask Alvarado, and it sounds like he has a refreshed outlook on life.

“I mean, what can I say? It all seems like the best thing in the world when you’re on the best team in baseball with the best record in baseball and the best teammates in baseball,” Alvarado said. “It all just feels so nice when you’re in that position. Also when you’re in front of the best fans that do everything to support us and show up every single day. It’s so nice when you think about it that way.”

It is. Sometimes, he needs a little reminder. The red boxing gloves are hanging there for a reason.
