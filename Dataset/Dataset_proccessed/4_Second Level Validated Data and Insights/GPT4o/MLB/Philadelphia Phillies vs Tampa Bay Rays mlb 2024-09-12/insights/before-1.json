        "Nick Castellanos homered in his first at bat, drew a two-out walk and scored the winning run in his penultimate plate appearance, made a lunging catch in right field to prevent the tying run from reaching base in the top of the eighth, and was plunked again in the bottom of the eighth.",
        "Weston Wilson drove in the game-winning run, marking the third straight game that the winning run was driven in by a reserve player who was called up from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.",
        "In this series the Phillies got a walk off hit by Kody Clemens, a tiebreaking, pinch hit double by Cal Stevenson, the game-winning fister down the third base line by Wilson on Wednesday and important contributions from Buddy Kennedy in the first two games (A walk to set up Clemens heroics and an RBI single) and three excellent defensive plays by fourth-string catcher Aramis Ramirez, most notably throwing out the tying run trying to steal second base in the ninth inning."
