        "In Tuesday night's game against the Minnesota Twins, Atlanta Braves manager Brian Snitker made an unusual pitching change by inserting closer Raisel Iglesias into the eighth inning in search of a 4-out save. The move didn't work as Iglesias allowed a single, which scored the tying run for the Twins.",
        "After escaping Tuesday with a win despite a 4-run blown lead, Snitker and his team need to treat Wednesday's contest in Minnesota with urgency."

        "Atlanta's urgency in the series finale against the Twins should be even higher due to the fact Cy Young candidate Chris Sale is on the mound. Sale won't pitch against the Phillies, and he matches up against an opposing pitcher from Minnesota on Wednesday, David Festa, who has a 5.20 ERA this season."
