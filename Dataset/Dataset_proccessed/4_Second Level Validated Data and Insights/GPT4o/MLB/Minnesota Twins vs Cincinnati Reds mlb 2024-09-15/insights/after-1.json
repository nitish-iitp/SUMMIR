        "\u201cHitting\u2019s contagious. It always helps when there are guys on base,\u201d said Lee, whose two-run single in the sixth gave the Twins the lead.",
        "\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really playing tight,\u201d Jeffers said. \u201cIt\u2019s just how this game goes. You\u2019re hot, you\u2019re cold. You hope that while some guys are cold, some other guys are hot. It just so happened that for a week or so, the two-week stretch or whatever it is, there hasn\u2019t been many guys that are hot to carry the load. But hopefully, with that being said, we can all get hot together.\u201d",
        "\u201cOur pitching did a good job of stabilizing the middle of the game, and then the bats were able to break through,\u201d Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cWe had multiple big hits and big at-bats and guys getting on base. A lot of what we were aiming for, we got.\u201d",
        "\u201cEvery day is a new day, a new game,\u201d said Santana, a 15-year veteran who\u2019s playing his first season with the Twins. \u201cToday is great. This is the game we need. We have 13 more games left and we have to finish strong.\u201d"
