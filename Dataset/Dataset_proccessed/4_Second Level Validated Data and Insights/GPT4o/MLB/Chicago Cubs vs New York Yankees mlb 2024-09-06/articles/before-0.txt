New York Yankees vs Chicago Cubs Prediction

I’m sticking with the Cubs. Wicks posted a nice outing versus Washington back on September 1, tossing 5.0 innings with one earned on four hits during a victory. As for Gil, he’s struggled a bit over his last two outings, combining for 7.0 innings and seven earned on August 12 and 20th.

Chicago had a pretty spotty series versus the Pirates this week, getting outscored 10-3 in the first two games before the Wednesday blowout. As for New York, they’ve been hemorrhaging runs lately: six or more in four of the last five (four in the other). Should be an interesting series this weekend.
