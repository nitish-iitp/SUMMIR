The Yankees paired timely hitting with superb pitching against the Chicago Cubs in their 3-0 win on Friday afternoon to start the weekend series.

Here are the takeaways...

-Facing left-handed starter Jordan Wicks, New York loaded the bases with two outs in the top of the first inning on a single by Gleyber Torres and walks to Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, but left them loaded after Jazz Chisholm Jr. grounded out back to Wicks for the final out of the frame.

The Yankees would not squander their next opportunity to score, though, after putting the first two on in the third. Following a leadoff walk to Torres and a single by Juan Soto, Aaron Judge doubled down the third-base line to score the game’s first run.

-Entering Friday, Judge had been mired in a 6-for-34 (.176 batting average) slump with just two RBI, two extra-base hits and no home runs over his last nine games. The outfielder ended the day 1-for-3 with a walk and while he is still stuck on 51 home runs, he continues to lead MLB with 125 RBI.

-Batting cleanup, Austin Wells immediately followed by attacking the first pitch he saw and driving in two more runs with a single to give New York a 3-0 lead. Later in the inning – in a bit of an embarrassing moment – Wells was picked off first base for the final out after feigning to steal a base, stopping and then falling before getting tagged out. The catcher finished 1-for-3 with a walk.

-Making his first start since landing on the injured list with a lower back strain while pitching against the Cleveland Guardians on Aug. 20, Luis Gil returned to the mound looking as good as he has all season.

The right-hander had a no-hitter through 3.1 innings before Cody Bellinger doubled in the fourth. It was the only hit that Gil would allow over his six scoreless innings as the 26-year-old also struck out seven and walked two on just 89 pitches (54 strikes), shutting the door on Chicago after his team got him the lead.

It was also the first time Gil (13-6) went at least six innings since July 13 as he lowered his ERA to 3.24. A healthy and effective Gil down the stretch and into the postseason would be a huge help for the Yankees.

-New York's bullpen was just as dominant as Gil with Jake Cousins, Tommy Kahnle and Luke Weaver each pitching a scoreless inning to close it out. Weaver recorded his first save of the season after Clay Holmes lost his closer role earlier in the week following his 11th blown save against the Texas Rangers.

-Returning to Wrigley Field for the first time since joining the Yankees in 2021, Anthony Rizzo received a warm welcome from the crowd of his former team in his first at-bat in the second inning. Rizzo finished 1-for-3 with a walk.

Game MVP: Luis Gil

Following the Yanks' series loss to the Rangers and in need of a good outing by their starter, Gil answered the call -- in his first start off the IL, no less -- and held the Cubs' high-scoring offense in check.

Highlights
What's next
