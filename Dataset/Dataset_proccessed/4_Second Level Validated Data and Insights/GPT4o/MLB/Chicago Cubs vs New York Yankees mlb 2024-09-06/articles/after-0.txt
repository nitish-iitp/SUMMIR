CHICAGO — The Yankees farmed out a reliever during Thursday’s off day, another on Friday after they beat the Cubs 3-0 at Wrigley Field and another probably will be optioned before Saturday’s game.

The latest to go is Ron Marinaccio, who was sent to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The righty was sent down to make room for Clarke Schmidt, who is coming off the injured list to start Saturday’s game.

On Thursday, Scott Effross was optioned to open up a roster spot for Luis Gil, who came off the IL on Friday and pitched one-hit ball for six shutout innings against the Cubs.

On Saturday, the Yankees are expected to activate reliever Ian Hamilton from the IL. When he returns, they’ll probably option Phil Bickford to Triple-A.

Marinaccio, 29, has been sent down six times this season, five options plus he was up for a day as a 26th man for a doubleheader. He’s 1-0 with a 3.86 ERA in 16 games with the Yankees. In his last big-league stint, which lasted from Sept. 1 through Friday, he appeared in two games and in both allowed two runs in one inning of work.

In Triple-A, Marinaccio has pitched to a 2.02 ERA in 31 outings.
