Cleveland Guardains vs. Kansas City Royals, Sept. 3, 2024
By Joe Noga, cleveland.com

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The bunt eluded Brayan Rocchio, so the Guardians’ rookie shortstop busted out the big stick and blasted Cleveland to its fifth win in six games.

Rocchio homered and drove in a career-high four runs, and Tanner Bibee struck out six batters Tuesday as the Guardians handed the Royals their seventh straight loss, 7-1 at Kauffman Stadium.

With Bo Naylor standing on first base in the seventh following a leadoff single, Rocchio twice attempted to lay down a bunt and move the runner into scoring position. After fouling off two pitches from Royals lefty Sam Long, Rocchio swung away at a slider that hung over the middle of the plate and sent it into the seats down the left field line.

It was the eighth home run of the season for Rocchio and his first since a solo shot in Yankee Stadium on Aug. 20. He also drove in runs with a sacrifice fly and a bases-loaded walk. Rocchio now has 31 RBI.

Guardians manager Stephen Vogt joked that he caught a hard time from the dugout after calling for the bunt based on Rocchio’s result, but praised the young infielder for refocusing after he was unable to execute.

“It’s really easy when you don’t get the job done to get down on yourself and just give away an at-bat,” Vogt said. “He got a pitch up and he crushed it.”

Vogt said Rocchio is continuing to develop at the plate and is “growing up” more and more every single day.

“His at-bats have been really good the last few days,” Vogt said. “We really like what we’re seeing.”

Rocchio said he was simply trying to put the ball in play and move Naylor into scoring position, but he can live with the way the at-bat ended.

“That’s what we work on, trying to simplify things in those moments and execute the plan and help the team win,” Rocchio said.

Cleveland reduced its magic number to clinch the American League Central Division to 20 with 23 games remaining after second-place Minnesota lost earlier in the day at Tampa Bay. The Guardians hold a 4 1/2 game lead over the Twins and a 5 1/2 game advantage over the Royals in the AL Central. They also have a magic number of 14 to clinch a playoff spot by virtue of Boston losing to the Mets.

Bibee (11-6, 3.56) earned the win as he kept Cleveland’s hot streak of starting pitching going with six strong innings, allowing one run on just two hits with three walks and six strikeouts. Guardians starters over the last four games have gone at least six innings and allowed no more than one earned run each.

Bibee loaded the bases with nobody out in the sixth after a leadoff double by Tommy Pham and back-to-back walks to Bobby Witt Jr. and Michael Massey. But he retired Salvador Perez on a line out to left field before Paul DeJong drove in K.C.’s only run with a sacrifice fly. He finished his night by striking out MJ Melendez to end the sixth on a fastball up and out of the strike zone.

Vogt said Bibee has shown he can make pitches in big moments, especially after Perez’s liner to deep left was not deep enough to score the runner from third.

“We were fortunate there,” Vogt said. “Gave up the sac fly and then he made a great pitch to get out of the inning. Tanner’s a big-time pitcher, and he wants those moments. For him to be able to slow down and execute in that situation was huge.”

The right-hander let out a little emotion as he bounced off the mound following his sixth punchout.

“That was a lot of adrenaline,” Bibee said.

Cleveland’s league-leading bullpen brought it home from there. Nick Sandlin, Pedro Avila and Scott Barlow combined for three scoreless innings. It marked the 50th time this season Cleveland’s bullpen has tossed three or more shutout innings in a game. The Guardians are 62-2 when leading after the sixth inning, the best record in the majors.

Cleveland scored a run in the second off Kansas City starter Brady Singer (9-10, 3.35) after Will Brennan and Kyle Manzardo opened the inning with back-to-back singles. Brennan moved to third on a fielder’s choice ground out by Daniel Schneemann and scored on Rocchio’s RBI sacrifice fly to left.

Rocchio scored the next run for Cleveland in the fifth when he was hit by a Singer pitch to open the inning and moved into scoring position when Steven Kwan bounced out to first. Andrés Giménez delivered Rocchio with a line drive single to left for a 2-0 lead. It was the 55th RBI for Giménez, who has eight hits and five RBI in his last seven games.

Rocchio’s bases loaded walk in the eighth against James McArthur was the 10th RBI walk for Cleveland this season, trailing New York, Seattle and Texas (11 each) in the American League. The Cubs lead the NL with 16 bases-loaded walks this season. Kwan snapped an 0 for 16 skid with a two-run single off McArthur in the eighth that put Cleveland in front by six.

Manzardo finished with three hits including a double, and is batting .500 (5 for 10) with a pair of home runs since rejoining the club from Triple-A Columbus on Sunday. Brennan added a pair of hits and scored two runs.

Josh Naylor, who opened the eighth with a base hit, exited the game with acute back spasms according to the team. Jhonkensy Noel pinch-ran for Naylor and scored on Rocchio’s walk. After the game, Vogt gave a positive update on Naylor’s condition.

“He’s fine,” Vogt said. “He’s tested out of the major stuff. So, you’ve got some lower back tightness. Hopefully that’s all better.”

Next: The series concludes Wednesday with a 7:40 p.m. first pitch from Kauffman Stadium. Right-hander Ben Lively (11-8, 3.92) gets the start for Cleveland, while righty Seth Lugo (14-8, 3.12) takes the mound for the Royals. Bally Sports Great Lakes, FS1, WTAM 1100 AM, WMMS 100.7 FM and the Guardians Radio Network will carry the game.
