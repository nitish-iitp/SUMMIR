        "Juan Soto said, 'The fans showed up today. It was electric.'",
        "Soto reflected on his throw to home plate, saying, 'I know Perez is not that fast, so I just tried to make sure I made a great throw. Don\u2019t try to overthrow it or anything \u2013 make an accurate throw.'",
        "Manager Aaron Boone commented, 'They\u2019re set up big time right there if they score that run. That was a big play.'",
        "Catcher Austin Wells praised Soto, saying, 'He\u2019s going to get on base \u2013 and if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s going to be a tough out. He really wears out pitching staffs. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s on our team.'",
        "Soto said, 'We showed today that we aren\u2019t trying to be selfish. We are trying to pass the baton, take our walks. We aren\u2019t trying to hit five-run homers.'"
