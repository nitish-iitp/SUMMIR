Cincinnati Reds vs Chicago Cubs Prediction 

Chicago comes into this series after scoring 16 runs in their last two games, but they did lose two of three against the Phillies. The Cubs are 42-36 at home this season, while the Reds are just 37-41 on the road. Cincinnati has only scored three runs in their last three games and they will face Jameson Taillon, who has been very good in his last few starts. The Reds are starting Nick Martinez, who has also been very solid recently, so runs should be at a premium. This total is too low to take the under in my opinion, so I will side with the Cubs, as they have played well at home.
