As for Anderson, he’s 0-2 in his last three with eight earned on 16 hits and five walks. There should be some early opportunities for both offenses here.

On Wednesday the White Sox posted two homers in a pretty nice offensive display. It’s difficult to imagine Chicago taking a sweep this year but this might be the time to do it.
