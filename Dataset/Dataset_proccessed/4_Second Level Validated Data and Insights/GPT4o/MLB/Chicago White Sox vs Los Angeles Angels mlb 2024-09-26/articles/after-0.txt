SOX PARK — The 120-loss Chicago White Sox have found a way to disappoint their diehard fans one last time. 

The team’s final home series of the 2024 season against the Los Angeles Angels drew large crowds for all the wrong reasons, with fans hoping to watch one last train wreck: With just one more loss, the Sox would claim baseball’s modern record for the worst season ever, lowering the bar set by the New York Mets (40-120) in 1962. 

“I’ll be cheering when the Sox lose,” said Alan Kahn, who took off work to catch Thursday’s game while vowing in the same breath to ditch his season tickets of 30 years.

Kahn went home unhappy: The Sox swept the Angels (64-95) with a 7-0 win. 

The home team’s red-hot hitting lifted the reluctant crowd to a standing ovation.

The Sox will now hit the road — with rare momentum — for a series against the playoff-hunting Detroit Tigers to close out the season. 

“This team can’t even lose right,” Sox fan Dan Lewis, wearing a red clown nose, scribbled on a piece of cardboard as he frowned.

Ever since it became apparent how close the Sox were to making history, many frustrated fans have been rooting for them — to lose. Two days earlier, fans rose from their seats to applaud a White Sox error, with booming chants of “Sell The Team” sweeping the ballpark.

But infamy is stuck on ice for now, even after the White Sox emptied their stadium coolers to offload beers for just $5 a pop. The team also shut down its upper decks and invited fans to tour its outfield lounge, where unsold gear was on clearance for $50 or less.

A miniature marquee erected at nearby Irish pub Cork & Kerry, 3259 S. Princeton Ave., still reads, “White Sox Magic Number: 1.” 

Mario Scalise, owner of Stix n Brix Wood Fired at 218 W. 33rd St., said he’s plotting to give away a pizza for every White Sox loss — for the second year in a row.

“The little bit I’ve watched of the team this year, it’s not surprising it’s gotten this bad,” Scalise said. “The Sox got desperate as the season went on, with all the promos to get people into the park. It could hurt us when it’s the ‘first 15K fans,’ and people are not walking around the area and rushing in to get their T-shirt.”

Crowds were more hostile Tuesday and Wednesday night, with rows of fans trading Sox hats for paper bags over their heads. Some passed out free “Sell” t-shirts to spread the message to owner Jerry Reinsdorf. One man was seen smoking a blunt in his seat without consequence. Another frustrated fan wore a full uniform in a sad offer to help the Sox in right field. 

Dave Cella, cameraman for White Sox broadcasts, kicked off his shoes while filming the game Thursday afternoon in front of the sleepier crowd, mostly there to try their best at enjoying one last afternoon at the ballpark. Fans appeared to wear more jerseys for retired 2005 champ Paul Konerko than any current player on the Sox roster.

“Why go through all this just to not get the record?” said Cella, who’s endured documenting every Sox home game this season. “This is the best worst team I’ve ever seen. They got a $75 million man in left field, a five-tool player in center, promising young pitching, yet they make mistakes late in games and never have enough innings to catch up.”

Sox fan Brian Biel spelled out his disappointment on his No. 1 jersey Thursday afternoon, crudely stapling a printed-out “21” next to the original number.

“Hopefully the ownership reads this,” said Biel, who gave up on buying season tickets for the first time in 26 years.

One fan shrugged his shoulders as the Sox racked up seven runs in the fifth inning Thursday.

“We’re all going to be history at some point, anyway,” he said.
