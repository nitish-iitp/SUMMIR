'Unbelievable' Tarik Skubal gets 200th strikeout in Tigers' win over Red Sox
CHRIS MCCOSKY   The Detroit News

Detroit — Tarik Skubal immediately started asking for the baseball, but third baseman Ryan Kreidler had already thrown it into the crowd behind the Tigers’ dugout.

Skubal had punched out Tyler O’Neill to end the sixth inning. It was his seventh strikeout of the day and his 200th of the season. He was in middle of another electrifying performance — going a career-high eight innings and helping the Tigers beat the Boston Red Sox, 2-1, at Comerica Park on Saturday — but he was acutely aware of that milestone.

Unfortunately, nobody else was.

"I didn't even know," said catcher Jake Rogers. "I just threw the ball around like normal. All of a sudden he's asking for the ball. I was like, 'What for?' He said 200 strikeouts. Well, I could've held on to that for you if I'd have known."

Same for Kreidler. Fortunately, Matt Vierling was on the case and he was able to spot the fan and retrieve the ball. It was sitting in Skubal's locker after the game.

BOX SCORE: Tigers 2, Red Sox 1

Skubal is just the fourth Tigers lefty to record 200 strikeouts in a season, joining Mickey Lolich, Hal Newhouser and Matthew Boyd. For sure he wanted that ball.

"I didn't really know where I was at," Skubal said of his strikeout total. "But I got tagged on Instagram with something that said I had 193. I knew I needed seven. That's why I was a little more fired up behind that one in the sixth inning in a situation that wasn't that big."

A fired-up crowd of 34,355 who came early to celebrate the 40-year anniversary of the 1984 World Series championship gave Skubal standing ovations after both the seventh and eighth innings. He gave up a first-inning home run to O’Neill and essentially nothing else in eight innings.

"We should have them back every game," Skubal said of the 1984 team. "It was a great environment. The fans were great. Obviously, what those guys did in '84 was special, leading start to finish. And a lot of those guys are still around and very impactful in our organization.

"This was awesome all the way around."

It was the American League-best 16th win for Skubal and the Tigers are 19-8 in the games he pitches. He lowered his ERA to a league best 2.51. When he ended the eighth inning striking out Ceddanne Rafaela with a 99-mph fastball on his 98th pitch, the energy in the stadium was palpable.

"He's unbelievable," Spencer Torkelson said of Skubal. "It's not only his stuff. It's the conviction behind it. The intent and the confidence he has every single pitch he throws. You can really look up to somebody like that. He sets the tone. It builds character in our pitching staff and even in the position players.

"You see that and you want to put that much conviction in every single pitch you see and on every pre-step in the field."

Skubal allowed just three singles after the home run and finished with eight strikeouts. And, to Torkelson's point, the Tigers played stellar defensive behind him.

Rogers pounced on a bunt attempt and threw out speedy Rafaela by two steps in the third inning.

"I don't know how many catchers make that play, being able to turn and throw," manager AJ Hinch said.

Skubal agreed.

"He was like a cat," he said. "He said, 'I got it.' And I said, 'Thank God.' I didn't want it."

Left fielder Riley Greene threw out Romy Gonzalez at second base after he tried to stretch a single into a double leading off the second inning. It was just the fourth outfield assist in Greene's career, the third this season.

Another leadoff single was wiped out in the fifth when Zach McKinstry, playing second base, and shortstop Trey Sweeney turned an improbable double play on a high-chopper by Triston Casas in the fifth.

And in the eighth, Kreidler fielded a ball behind the bag at third and with all his momentum going toward the stands, fired a bullet across the diamond to retire Casas leading off the inning.

"That was one of the better plays I've seen in a while," Rogers said. "Tough throw, across your body and jumping like that. Great play."

Had Kreidler not made that play, Skubal likely wouldn't have finished the inning. Will Vest was up and ready in the bullpen.

"Those were all lead-off outs," Skubal said. "That's huge. It's really hard to score when you get the first guy out."

Skubal pitched fearlessly against a pesky Red Sox lineup known for long at-bats and driving pitch counts up. He got the eight strikeouts with 16 misses on 53 swings and 19 called strikes, plus 18 foul balls. Still, he had short innings. He was at 20 pitches after two innings, 46 after four and 57 after five.

"Very efficient and dominant," Hinch said. "That's a really good team and they will put together some tough at-bats. But being as efficient as he was and where they were in the order, it was an easy decision for me (to send Skubal back out for the eighth)."

Skubal punctuated his punch-out of Rafaela with a shout and a little backwards shuffle off the mound.

"I knew I got him on a changeup earlier and then he took a really good changeup on the fourth pitch of the at-bat," Skubal said. "When Rog called the heater, I got pretty amped up. I was just going to throw it as hard as I could and see what happened."

Strike three happened. A standing ovation happened. And after lefty Tyler Holton dispatched the top of the Red Sox order in the ninth, a victory happened. The Tigers (69-68) are six losses behind the Twins for the final wild card spot. They are 1½ games behind the Red Sox and a game behind the Mariners.

"We're going to keep it the same as we have all year," Skubal said. "We need to focus on winning each day's game. We need to win (Sunday) and win the series."

The Tigers scored their two runs in the span of three hitters in the second inning. Against right-hander Nick Pivetta, Torkelson singled, McKinstry doubled him to third and Sweeney doubled both runners home.

McKinstry’s double extended his hitting streak to a team-best 11 games and it was a bold send by third base coach Joey Cora that got McKinstry home on Sweeney's drive. McKinstry initially went back to tag at second, thinking the ball was going to be caught.

"We've talked all year about being aggressive," Hinch said. "And yes, there have been some outs at home and some tough calls. Sometimes near-safe, sometimes near-out. But that's an example of Z-Mac giving Joey a chance to read the throw."

Rafaela caught the relay throw flat-footed and facing the outfield. He never expected McKinstry would try to score.

"You have to risk something to create some momentum in that play," Hinch said. "If Z-Mac doesn't do his part after he went to tag, then Joey has to hold him up and we miss an opportunity. That's part of our identity and it's part of what we're trying to instill in these guys.

"You can bet I'm going to show that play in our hitter's meeting tomorrow as an example of how we win a game."
