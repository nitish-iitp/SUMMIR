Cincinnati Reds Betting Preview

This week the Reds played the St. Louis Cardinals. Cincinnati won 3-0 Tuesday then dropped the next pair. On Friday in the opener versus the Twins, the Reds powered out an 8-4 win with six runs in the seventh inning.

Nick Martinez will start for the Reds on Saturday. Martinez is 8-6 with a 3.46 ERA and 98 Ks.

Over on the Twins’ side, they played the Los Angeles Angels in their last set. Minnesota lost Monday then came back with wins 10-5 and 6-4 to take the series. On Friday the Twins scored three runs in the bottom of the seventh but didn’t get close to making a comeback.

It’ll be Simeon Woods Richardson in the start for the Twins on Saturday. This year Richardson is 5-4 with a 3.96 ERA in 25 starts. Over 27 games (26 starts) in his career Richardson is 5-5 with a 4.14 ERA.

Cincinnati Reds vs Minnesota Twins Prediction

I might take a stab on the Reds here. At least some of that is due to Richardson’s recent struggles. He’s given up nine earned runs combined over his last three starts in 12.2 innings total. Richardson hasn’t gotten past 4.2 innings in any of those outings, either.

On Friday the Reds had one big inning in the seventh and rode the wave to the win. Overall the pitching was pretty solid behind Julian Aguiar (6.1 innings; three earned) and there were a couple of big hitting performances. I think the Reds have a decent shot at keeping it going.
