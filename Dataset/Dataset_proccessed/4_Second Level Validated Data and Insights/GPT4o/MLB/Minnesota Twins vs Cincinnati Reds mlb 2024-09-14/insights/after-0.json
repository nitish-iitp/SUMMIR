        "Twins manager Rocco Baldelli commented on the difficulty of the game, stating, 'That was a tough game to watch, play in, manage, coach, the whole thing, so after the halfway point we're really just \u2014 you have to find a way to get through the game in the easiest way possible.'",
        "Louie Varland's performance was addressed by Baldelli, who said, 'He wasn\u2019t missing the bats that he normally does when the stuff is really good like that. We\u2019re still gonna need to go to him. He\u2019s still going to be a guy that we\u2019re going to have to go to in important spots to keep the game where it\u2019s at, to keep leads, to do things like that. He\u2019s going to have to do all these things for us, so I don\u2019t want to let this outing deter him, or it\u2019s not going to deter me in any way. But we got to get him right.'"

        "Despite the fourth-inning disaster, the impact of the returns of Buxton and Correa were clear early on. Buxton beat out the throw to first on an RBI infield single in the first inning to give the Twins a 1-0 lead.",
        "Correa helped turn a 4-6-3 double play in the second inning and doubled in the fourth inning.",
        "Both Buxton and Correa finished their nights 1 for 2 \u2014 with Buxton plating the Twins' lone run \u2014 but both went to the bench after their at-bats in the fourth inning with the game already well out of reach."
