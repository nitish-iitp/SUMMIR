Brewers 6, Giants 0: Aaron Civale sets the tone with seven shutout innings
TODD ROSIAK   Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

Aaron Civale is in a groove, which is great news for the Milwaukee Brewers.

The right-hander turned in his third strong start in his last four outings Thursday afternoon, throwing seven shutout innings and allowing only four baserunners to set the tone for a 6-0 victory over the San Francisco Giants at American Family Field.

Garrett Mitchell also homered and rookie Jackson Chourio doubled in a pair of runs, but it was Civale who was the story.

Acquired from the Tampa Bay Rays on July 3, the six-year veteran had pitched inconsistently over his first five starts with the Brewers before turning the corner of late.

BOX SCORE: Brewers 6, Giants 0

Including Thursday, he's won three of his last four starts – all six-inning efforts or longer – to improve to 5-8 and lower his season ERA to 4.59. He also improved to 3-1 with a 1.45 ERA in five starts in Milwaukee.

The Brewers, meanwhile, improved to 77-56 with a four-game series beginning Friday morning (first game of a doubleheader) at Cincinnati.

Aaron Civale was impressive

Staked to the early lead, Civale breezed his way through seven shutout innings with minimal issue. The Giants managed only four baserunners against Civale over 92 pitches, and he struck out seven.

It was his longest outing since last July 25 (eight innings vs. Kansas City with Cleveland) and his longest scoreless outing since last July 7 (also vs. Kansas City).

Civale's previous Brewers high was 6 ⅓ innings against Pittsburgh on July 11, and he threw six shutout innings against Cleveland on Aug. 16.

Aaron Ashby retired all six batters he faced over the final two innings, striking out three, to cap what was a terrific overall pitching performance by the Brewers.

Jackson Chourio just keeps doing it

Birdsong issued consecutive two-out walks in the fourth, ending his day at 92 pitches.

Chourio then greeted Sean Hjelle with a double to right and William Contreras followed with a single to left that plated Chourio and doubled Milwaukee's lead to 6-0.

The two-bagger was the 20th of the season for Chourio, who now has driven in runs in six of his last eight games and 62 total in 120 games.

Early lead for the Brewers

Mitchell got the Brewers onto the scoreboard first, sending a one-out Birdsong offering out to right-center in the second for a 1-0 lead.

It was Mitchell's third of the season, and first since Aug. 8 at Atlanta.

Gary Sánchez followed by walking, Joey Ortiz doubled him to third and a Blake Perkins sacrifice fly doubled Milwaukee's lead to 2-0.

The Brewers tacked another run on in the third when, with two outs and runners on the corners, Willy Adames broke for second base. As he engaged himself in a brief rundown, Contreras broke for home from third.

LaMonte Wade Jr. threw from first to third, but multi-time Gold Glove Award winner Matt Chapman dropped the ball in his haste to turn and throw to the plate, and Contreras was credited with a steal of home.
