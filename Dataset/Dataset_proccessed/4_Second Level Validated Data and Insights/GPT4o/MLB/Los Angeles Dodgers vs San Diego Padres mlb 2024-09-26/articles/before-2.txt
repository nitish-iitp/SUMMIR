Clayton Kershaw not ready to face hitters as chance of postseason return is fading

The chances of three-time National League Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw bolstering the Dodgers’ injury-ravaged rotation, at least for the first round of the playoffs, appear to be dwindling by the day.

Kershaw, who hasn’t pitched since he left an Aug. 30 start at Arizona after one inning because of pain in his left big toe, was able to complete several bullpen workouts in the last two weeks — one in which he threw about 80 pitches — but the veteran left-hander has not progressed to a point where he is ready to face hitters.

“We’re in a holding pattern with Clayton,” manager Dave Roberts said before Tuesday night’s series opener against the San Diego Padres. “I don’t think there’s been improvement. I don’t see him facing hitters this week … and that is pretty telling in itself. Hopefully in the next few days, we’ll get a little bit more clarity on how he’s feeling.”

Kershaw declined comment as he came off the field after batting practice. Roberts said Kershaw will “do whatever he can to be available” to boost a rotation that has lost ace Tyler Glasnow (elbow sprain) and rookie Gavin Stone (shoulder strain) for the rest of the season, but Kershaw’s toe does not appear to be the only concern.

“It’s the toe … it’s just the body,” Roberts said. “From what I understand, he’s playing catch. He was out there playing catch today. But there’s something that’s holding him up from progressing to face hitters. So for me, for the training staff, I was told that we’re kind of status quo on not moving forward.”

Clayton Kershaw ‘trying everything,’ even working with Skechers, to ease toe injury
Sept. 9, 2024

Kershaw, 36, missed the first four months of the season while recovering from last November’s surgery to repair the glenohumeral ligaments and capsule in his throwing shoulder. He was activated in late July and went 2-2 with a 4.50 ERA in seven starts, striking out 24 and walking nine in 30 innings.

With 2,968 strikeouts over his 17-year career, Kershaw, whose one-year, $10-million contract includes a $5-million player option for next year, needs only 32 strikeouts to reach 3,000.

Secret weapon?

The Dodgers called up right-handed pitching prospect Edgardo Henriquez for Tuesday’s game, completing a rapid ascent for the hard-throwing 22-year-old reliever. Henriquez started this season in class A Rancho Cucamonga but progressed all the way to triple-A Oklahoma City with a 2.72 ERA and 88 strikeouts in 53 innings across all levels.

Could he ever have expected to reach the big leagues before the end of the season?

“Not really,” he said with a smile in Spanish. “But with the work I was doing and all the preparation, I always had this possibility on my mind.”

He made his MLB debut Tuesday by giving up one hit and striking out two, including Fernando Tatis Jr. with a 101-mph fastball, in a scoreless seventh inning.

Henriquez, whose fastball has been clocked as high as 104 mph, was called up in place of fellow rookie Ben Casparius. Stone was placed on the 60-day injured list to open a 40-man roster spot.

“He’s certainly a weapon,” Roberts said of Henriquez.

Whether Henriquez can be a surprise October addition — like 20-year-old relief ace Francisco Rodriguez was for the Angels during their 2002 World Series run — is less clear.

Though the Venezuelan, who was signed in 2018, didn’t make his MLB debut until the final week of the season, he still would be eligible for a playoff roster spot.

The chances of the Dodgers carrying a rookie with minimal big-league experience on their postseason roster appear unlikely, but given the shorthanded state of the pitching staff, Roberts didn’t rule it out either.

“There’s a lot of guys that are up for consideration, and we’ll see if we can get him into a game and see how it looks,” Roberts said. “But certainly, arm talent, you can’t debate that.”

Ohtani pitching plan

The Dodgers, as of Tuesday, had not met with Shohei Ohtani to map out the final stages of his recovery from elbow surgery, but Roberts said the chances of the two-way star returning in time to pitch in the playoffs are remote.

“I just don’t see it happening; it’s very unlikely,” Roberts said. “But the meeting is gonna happen for Shohei to kind of figure out a plan of action over the next week or two.”

Ohtani has been throwing regularly off a bullpen mound for the last month. Is it important for him to face hitters before the end of the season, or would it be better to shut him down heading into the winter?

“You could argue both,” Roberts said. “You could argue to shut him down for rest, and there’s also an argument to continue to build up, face hitters and build up a little more going into the offseason. But that’s more for the training staff and the doctors.”

Rojas wins Campanella award

Veteran shortstop Miguel Rojas was named the winner of the 19th annual Roy Campanella Award, which is given to the Dodger who best exemplifies the spirit and leadership of the late Hall-of-Fame catcher.

The award, which is voted upon by uniformed Dodgers personnel, will be presented to Rojas by Joni Campanella Roan, who is Roy’s daughter, and Cari Bell, Roy’s grandson, during pregame ceremonies Wednesday night. The previous three Campanella Awards went to Jason Heyward (2023), Freddie Freeman (2022) and Chris Taylor (2021).
