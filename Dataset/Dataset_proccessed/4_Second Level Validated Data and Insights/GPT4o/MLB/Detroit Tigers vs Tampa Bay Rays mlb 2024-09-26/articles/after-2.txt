DETROIT — Justyn-Henry Malloy’s eighth-inning sacrifice fly helped the Detroit Tigers rally from a 3-0 deficit to move closer to the postseason with a 4-3 win over the Rays on Thursday afternoon.

“We do believe in what we can accomplish,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “Whether that’s magic, whether that’s momentum, whether that’s mojo, whether that’s vibe, whatever, we love it and we want more of it.”

The Rays (78-81), already eliminated from playoff contention, fell two games behind the third-place Red Sox (80-79) in the AL East. Boston was idle Thursday.

The Rays’ record of consecutive winning records ended after six seasons. They need to sweep their season-ending series against the Red Sox to finish at .500.

“That’s the last team in baseball that you want to give any momentum,” said Rays manager Kevin Cash, whose team was swept in the three-game series against the Tigers. “They are doing a lot of good things right now.”

Detroit, which has won five straight, is tied with Kansas City for the second and third American League wildcard spots, 2½ games ahead of Minnesota. The Twins were scheduled to play the Marlins Thursday night.

“We’re bringing the energy right now,” said rookie Colt Keith, who drove in two runs and scored another. “We have such a good team. I love this group.”

The Tigers trailed 3-2 with one out in the eighth, but Riley Greene singled off Garrett Cleavinger (7-5) and Matt Vierling drew a walk.

Keith tied the game with an RBI single, bringing up Malloy — the last position player on the Tigers bench — to pinch-hit for Kerry Carpenter. Malloy lifted a fly ball to medium center, and Vierling easily beat Jose Siri’s throw.

“They have four lefties in their bullpen, and we knew (Malloy) was going to hit against one of them,” Hinch said. “He was waiting all day for that specific spot.”

Beau Brieske (4-4) got the win with two innings of relief. Jason Foley pitched the ninth for his 27th save.

Rays starter Tyler Alexander allowed four hits and struck out six without walking a batter. He’s 1-0 with a 2.00 ERA in two career outings against Detroit, where he spent the first five seasons of his career.

The Rays took a 2-0 lead in the third. Ben Rortvedt and Taylor Walls singled with one out and scored on Brandon Lowe’s two-out base hit.

Walls tripled with one out in the fifth and scored on Casey Mize’s wild pitch.

The Tigers got on the board in the sixth when Hunter Bigge walked Vierling with two outs before Keith hit an RBI triple. Carpenter followed with a pinch-hit single to make it 3-2.

Kevin Kelly pitched a perfect seventh, extending his scoreless streak to 23⅓ innings over 25 outings.

Up next

Rays: Travel to Boston to start a weekend series with the Red Sox, needing three wins to finish 81-81. Right-hander Taj Bradley (7-11, 4.30) will start Friday’s opener against righty Nick Pivetta (6-11, 4.21).

Tigers: Remain at home for three games against the White Sox, knowing that two wins will clinch the franchise’s first postseason spot in 10 years. They have not announced their rotation for the final series, since it will depend on the playoff race.
