In a season marked by disappointment, the Toronto Blue Jays hoped fans on Tuesday night would pull through for a record-setting performance.

And they did.

Tuesday’s home game against the Boston Red Sox marked the last “Loonie Dog” night of the year. As the name indicates, the Blue Jays put hot dogs on sale for $1 every time the team plays a Tuesday game at Rogers Centre.

Up until then, the Blue Jays sold 678,488 Loonie Dogs, a spokesperson told Global News. In 2023, the Jays sold 693,865 Loonie Dogs.

“For the last Loonie Dogs Night presented by Schneiders of the season …, fans need to eat 15,377 Loonie Dogs to break the all-time season record, and 21,512 to cross the 700,000 dollar dog threshold,” they said in a statement.
