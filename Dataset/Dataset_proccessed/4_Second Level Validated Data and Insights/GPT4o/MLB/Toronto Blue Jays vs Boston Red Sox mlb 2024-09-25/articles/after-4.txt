TORONTO — The Red Sox’ late-season winning streak came to end Wednesday night, and with it, their longshot bid to sneak into the postseason.

The Sox dropped a 6-1 decision to the Toronto Blue Jays, snapping what had been a four-game streak. The loss, coupled with wins by both Kansas City and Detroit, officially eliminated the Red Sox from playoff contention. With three games remaining, the Red Sox need at least one win to avoid a losing record and two wins to finish above .500.

The Blue Jays jumped on rookie starter Richard Fitts for two runs in the fourth and two more in the fifth and never looked back. The Blue Jays piled on two more runs off reliever Josh WInckowski in the seventh to put the game away.

Blanked over the first five innings, the Red Sox finally managed to break through against Toronto starter Kevin Gausman in the sixth.

Jarren Duran led with his 48th double of the year and after Wilyer Abreu joined him on base with a walk, Duran rode home on a single to right by Triston Casas.

That left the Sox with two on and no out, but the inning then quickly dissolved as Tyler O’Neil’s grounder up the middle was turned into an unorthodox double play in which both baserunners were eliminated on the bases as O’Neill reached.

A fielder’s choice in which Blue Jays shortstop Ernie Clement failed to touch second base to force out O’Neill and a walk by Trevor Story then loaded the bases and presented the Sox with another chance to get back into the game. But Gausman, in what would be the final pitch of his outing, retired Nick Sogard on a flyout to right.

In the fifth, a leadoff walk to No. 9 hitter — and former Worcester batterymate — Tyler Heineman followed by a single to left by Jonatan Clase set the Jays up for the potential of a big inning. After a sacrifice bunt and an infield popup, Fitts was an out away from getting out the inning unscathed, but Alejando Kirk slammed an opposite field liner to right, delivering both baserunners.

Kirk was thrown out attempting to stretch at second by Abreu, but the damage had been done.

Fitts hadn’t allowed an earned run in his first three outings, and he cruised through the first three innings Wednesday, allowing just two baserunners.

But it didn’t take long for trouble to mount in the fourth. Vladimir Guerrero cracked a leadoff double to right center, just over the outstretched glove of Jarren Duran. A double to center from Alejandro Kirk followed, scoring Guerrero easily, and just like that, Fitts’ career-opening streak was done.

A single by Ernie Clement one out later stretched Toronto’s lead to 2-0.
