PHOENIX -- Sometimes, D-backs shortstop Geraldo Perdomo will get a feeling, something he can't quite describe or explain where it comes from. It’s just an instinctual feel that comes with experience.

As he stood at shortstop in the top of the ninth inning with two outs, a runner on third and Jose Iglesias at the plate, that little voice inside told Perdomo he should move a step or two to his left.

Each Arizona player carries in his back pocket a chart that tells him where to play on each hitter. There is science behind it, but manager Torey Lovullo also trusts the instincts of players like Perdomo, so he gives them the freedom to not follow the chart.

Almost always, Perdomo follows his instinct, but for whatever reason, this time he didn't.

Sure enough, Iglesias hit a grounder up the middle to Perdomo's left, and despite a diving attempt, the ball glanced off his glove for a base hit as pinch-runner Tyrone Taylor scored what proved to be the game-winning run as the Mets beat the D-backs, 3-2, on Thursday afternoon at Chase Field.

"I didn't trust my instincts," Perdomo said. "My instincts told me to move a little bit to the left side. Right before those last two pitches, something told me to move to the left side. I don’t know why I didn’t. That’s why I told a couple of my teammates that it was on me. A couple of days ago, too, it happened. And I didn’t trust my instincts there. I just need to move on."

There was logic to go with Perdomo's instinct. With Justin Martinez and his 100-plus mph fastball on the mound, it didn't seem like Iglesias, a right-handed hitter, would pull the ball to Perdomo's right.

"It just hit my glove," Perdomo said. "Even if I take a step, it’s going to be an easy ground ball, like a routine play. I think everybody knows the type of player I am and how hard I work on my defense. I think Torey gives me that trust in what I do and what I see during the game. Justin made a really good pitch, too, but in a situation like that, I need to trust more in my instincts."

With the loss, the D-backs have dropped just their second series in their last 13 as they remain in the lead for the National League's top Wild Card spot.

The Mets provided a test for the D-backs, who could have been swept if not for Corbin Carroll's grand slam in the eighth inning Wednesday night that erased a late deficit. The road gets no easier from here as the Dodgers come to town Friday for a crucial four-game series.

"It’s the same mindset," Perdomo said. "Go out there, have fun, play really good baseball and just get the ‘W.’ Like I’ve been saying the last couple of weeks, we treat everybody the same and I think it’s going to be a good match for us."

While the D-backs are in the lead in the Wild Card standings, they trail the Dodgers in the NL West by 3 1/2 games, pending the results of Los Angeles’ game against the Orioles on Thursday night.

This is the last regular-season head-to-head matchup between the two division rivals, so it's the best chance for Arizona to make up ground.

"Every game is important, and we have that mindset down the stretch here," Lovullo said. "We want to be playing good baseball. Every game is meaningful. We're taking nothing for granted. This group is hungry, and they want to go out and play a complete baseball game. So we respect every opponent, we know the L.A. Dodgers that are coming in here, and we want to do our job the best way we can."
