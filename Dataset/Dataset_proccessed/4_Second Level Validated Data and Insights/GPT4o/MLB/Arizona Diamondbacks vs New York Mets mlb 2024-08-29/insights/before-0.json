        "David Peterson and Ryne Nelson go head to head as we continue our MLB odds series with a Mets-Diamondbacks prediction and pick.",
        "David Peterson (8-1) with a 2.85 ERA, 1.32 WHIP, 85.1 innings pitched, 66K/37BB, .238 oBA",
        "Ryne Nelson (9-6) with a 4.29 ERA, 1.28 WHIP, 130 innings pitched, 108K/30BB, .268 oBA",
        "David Peterson has been good all season. He has been especially good in August, though. Peterson has thrown 31.2 innings this month, allowed just 23 hits, only one homerun, and he has a 1.71 ERA. He has also led the Mets to four straight wins in games he has started.",
        "Peterson is not much of a strikeout pitcher. However, one thing he does well is get the ground ball. He forces opposing teams to hit the ball on the ground more than half of the time, which is very important for him. The Diamondbacks have the fifth-highest ground ball rate in baseball, so you can expect plenty of balls on the ground this game.",
        "The Diamondbacks need Ryne Nelson to have one of his good starts in this game. The good news is Nelson has been very good since the beginning of July. In that span, Nelson has made 10 starts and has a record of 4-0. Along with that, Nelson has a 2.62 ERA in 62 innings pitched, 62 strikeouts, and just 47 hits allowed. The Diamondbacks are 8-2 in those 10 starts, as well.",
        "The Diamondbacks, as mentioned, hit a lot of ground balls. However, they are still second in the MLB in batting average. They are also fifth in the MLB in slugging percentage, ninth in home runs, second in triples, and second in wOBA. Peterson allows opposing hitters to make solid contact a lot, so the Diamondbacks should be able to take advantage of that."
