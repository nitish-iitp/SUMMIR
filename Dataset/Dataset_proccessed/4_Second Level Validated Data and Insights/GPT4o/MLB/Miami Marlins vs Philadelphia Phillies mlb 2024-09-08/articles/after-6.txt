MIAMI — Otto López was a triple shy of the cycle, Connor Norby homered and drove in three runs, and the Miami Marlins snapped NL East-leading Philadelphia’s six-game winning streak with a 9-5 victory over the Phillies on Saturday.

Jonah Bride also homered, while Xavier Edwards and Nick Fortes had two hits each for the Marlins, who had 14 hits a day after losing 16-2 to the Phillies.

“(Friday) was not great. Today was a lot better,” Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said. “To face one of the better pitchers in the league and one of the better teams in the league was impressive especially with all the moving parts in the clubhouse, meeting new guys.”

The Marlins were busy Saturday, adding four new players to the roster. Infielder Javier Sanoja made his major league debut with a pinch hit appearance in the seventh. The 22-year-old Sanoja hit a grounder to shortstop Trea Turner, who threw errantly attempting to cut down a runner at the plate that led to two runs. Sanoja was credited with a fielder’s choice RBI.

“I wanted to go out there and be aggressive,” Sanoja said through a translator. “Unfortunately, I didn’t get my first hit but I was able to get the RBI.”

John McMillon (2-1) pitched 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief for the win.

Phillies starter Aaron Nola (12-7) was lifted after he allowed five runs and nine hits over 4 2/3 innings, walking two and striking out five. It was his shortest start since allowing eight runs and 11 hits in 3 1/3 innings against Boston on June 13.

“I think just command of the baseball. He just missed the glove a lot — a lot more than he normally does — and he paid for it,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said.

Miami worked long counts against Nola throughout his start. He finished with 101 pitches.

“He’s an amazing pitcher and today the plan was let him pitch,” López said. “His command is amazing so we wanted to stretch out the pitches.”

Bride homered to lead off the fifth and put Miami ahead 5-3 and Jesús Sánchez added an RBI single in the sixth.

The Marlins padded their lead with a three-run seventh against former starter Taijuan Walker. López hit a solo homer over the center field wall before Griffin Conine and Fortes scored on Turner’s throwing error.

Philadelphia’s Kyle Schwarber hit a tying sacrifice fly in the third inning for his 93rd RBI of the season.

Norby hit a two-run homer in the first to put Miami ahead 2-1.

Marlins starter Darren McCaughan allowed three runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings. The right-hander struck out four.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Phillies: Thomson said catcher J.T. Realmuto has some swelling but will remain with the club as he recovers from a left knee contusion sustained Friday. The Phillies selected the contract of catcher Aramis Garcia from Triple-A Lehigh Valley and designated RHP Nick Nelson for assignment.

Marlins: Placed RHP Max Meyer (right shoulder bursitis) and RHP Calvin Faucher (right shoulder impingement) on the 15-day injured list and OF Derek Hill (right shoulder impingement) on the 10-day injured list. … LHP Andrew Nardi (left elbow muscle) was transferred to the 60-day injured list.

UP NEXT

RHP Seth Johnson will make his major league debut when he starts the series finale for the Phillies on Sunday. The Marlins have not announced a starter but Schumaker said RHP Edward Cabrera could get the nod when he cleared all tests after he withdrew from his scheduled start Friday because of migraine-like symptoms.
