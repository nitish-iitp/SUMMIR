Manny Machado went deep twice and tied the Padres’ record for career homers as San Diego beat the visiting San Francisco Giants 5-1 on Friday.

Machado’s second homer of the night, his 25th of the year, soared into the second deck in left field to start the bottom of the eighth inning. It was his 163rd homer with San Diego, tying Nate Colbert’s 50-year old record.

Michael King (12-8) fanned eight in six innings and limited San Francisco to one run on six hits and a walk. Three relievers threw hitless ball over the last three innings.

More on Manny Machado & Giants vs. Padres

San Diego (81-62) gained ground in the National League playoff race, going up by 1 1/2 games over Arizona for the top wild-card spot as the Diamondbacks lost 8-0 at Houston.

The Padres, who won for the fourth time in five games, also drew within four games of first-place Los Angeles in the NL West after the Dodgers took a 3-1 home loss to the Cleveland Guardians.

Rookie Mason Black (0-3) was tagged with the loss after permitting six hits and four runs in 4 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out six as the Giants (69-73) lost for the fifth time in six games.

Coming off a 4-3 loss on Thursday when the Detroit Tigers’ Parker Meadows hit a two-out, two-strike grand slam in the ninth off closer Robert Suarez, the Padres showed no ill effects, putting up three runs in the first inning with the help of a big defensive gaffe.

After Luis Arraez and Fernando Tatis Jr. singled, Jurickson Profar flied out to right. Arraez advanced to third and shortstop Tyler Fitzgerald cut off the throw in an attempt to get Tatis at second. However, Fitzgerald’s throw sailed into the right field corner and two runners scored.

Machado followed with his first solo homer, a 375-foot shot into the seats in left. He made it 4-0 in the fifth by greeting reliever Sean Hjelle with a two-out RBI single to right.

King kept San Francisco off the board until Michael Conforto led off the sixth with his 16th homer into the seats in right field.

Matt Chapman and Grant McCray each had two hits for the Giants.

Tatis finished 2-for-4 with two runs.
