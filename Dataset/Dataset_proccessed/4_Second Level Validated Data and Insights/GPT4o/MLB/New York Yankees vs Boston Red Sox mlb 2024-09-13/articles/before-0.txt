Red Sox seesaw season continues with loss to Yankees in extra innings

NEW YORK — For the second night in a row, the Boston Red Sox pushed an American League East opponent into extra innings.

But they didn’t have the same fate on Thursday night in the Bronx as they did on Wednesday in a walk-off win.

The Red Sox fell 2-1 to the New York Yankees as Juan Soto doubled in the automatic runner in the bottom of the 10th inning.

Boston’s offense struggled again, as a 12-run outburst against the Baltimore Orioles on Monday, one that could have served as a catalyst for the final three weeks of play, now appears to be a mirage.

Danny Jansen hit a solo homer in the fifth that tied the game, but ultimately it was the only run the Red Sox were able to push across against the Yankees.

“It’s been going on for a while now, we haven’t hit,” manager Alex Cora said. “We’re in this position — I mean, it’s a combination of a lot of things. We struggled from the mound for a little bit there but it seems like when we turned a corner pitching-wise, we haven’t been able to score runs. It’s been tough.”

The Red Sox did have chances against Yankees lefty Nestor Cortes. In the second, Connor Wong doubled and Jansen walked, but Wilyer Abreu struck out. In the fourth, Tyler O’Neill and Wong drew back-to-back walks with one out, but Trevor Story grounded into a double play. Abreu singled in the fifth after Jansen’s homer, but the next three batters went down in succession. In the ninth, O’Neill doubled and Wong walked with one out, but Story struck out and pinch hitter Triston Casas flied out. The Red Sox went 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position and left seven men on base.

“We’re going through a funk, it’s been a few weeks where we have been a little inconsistent,” hitting coach Pete Fatse said. “I think collectively, as a group, we’re capable of doing it. We have shown it before. The homestand was good for us. It comes down to getting pitches in the zone and executing.”

The lack of offense wasted a strong start from Cooper Criswell, who limited the Yankees to one run on four hits and three walks while striking out four over 5 1/3 innings. The lone run he allowed came on a solo homer from Gleyber Torres to lead off the bottom of the first. It wouldn’t have been a home run in any ballpark except for Yankee Stadium.

Criswell’s performance lowered Red Sox starters’ ERA to 2.43 over their last 17 games.

The Red Sox bullpen, which has struggled alongside the offense, had a strong night to hold the Yankees at bay and bide time for the struggling offense.

Criswell allowed a single in the sixth then recorded a strikeout before Cora turned to Cam Booser. Booser loaded the bases, but Zack Kelly entered and wriggled out of the jam with a fly out.

Justin Slaten, Chris Martin and Kenley Jansen pitched three scoreless innings to send the game to extras before Josh Winckowski gave up the walk-off hit.

On a day when Detroit lost to Colorado and Kansas City and Minnesota were idle, the Red Sox wasted a chance to make up ground in the wild-card race.

The Red Sox are 7-13 in their last 20 games, 14-21 in the last 35 and 21-30 in 51 games since the All-Star break. There are 15 games left in the season.

“You have to stay positive,” Rafael Devers said through a team translator. “You can come tomorrow and win and then win the next two games and you’re still right back there again in the fight.”

Cora confirmed Tanner Houck, who was skipped in his last start with a dead arm, will start on Friday as the Red Sox try, once again, to find consistency.
