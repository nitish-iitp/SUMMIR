Wednesday’s MLB odds, best bets: Projections for pitching matchups, playoffs and more
By Derek Carty
Sep 11, 2024

Wednesday’s MLB games include a matchup on Prime Video between the Kansas City Royals and New York Yankees in New York at 7:05 p.m. ET. We have odds and projections for that primetime matchup and every other game today. Powered by Derek Carty’s THE BAT X, the tables below provide up-to-the-minute MLB odds, projections, best bets and top picks each day.

Carty’s EV Analytics considers everything from best odds value to the lines with the most movement. There are updated projected records for all 30 MLB teams below the game projections, along with playoff and World Series likelihoods. All the odds you see are from BetMGM.

What are THE BAT X projections?

In the tables below, you’ll see details for each MLB matchup, then a lot of numbers (which are updated all day):

“Moneyline” shows each team’s odds on BetMGM.
“Implied Win%” is the chance a team has to win based on those BetMGM odds.
“THE BAT X win%” is the chance a team has to win based on EV Analytics’ projections.
“Cash Line” is how THE BAT X would price each team’s odds.
“Value” is the percentage difference between the odds chances and our projections.

The higher the value percentage, the better — which you can easily see from the color coding from red (bad pick) through to green (good pick).

Note: On mobile, you may have to scroll to see the color-coded “Value” column on the far right of the first set of tables.

Another note: If you’re seeing old data or the tables aren’t showing up, you may need to “hard refresh” this page, or you may have an ad blocker or other software blocking the tables from loading.
