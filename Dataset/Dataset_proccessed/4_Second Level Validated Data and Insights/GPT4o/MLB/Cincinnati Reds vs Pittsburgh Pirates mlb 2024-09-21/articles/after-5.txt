CINCINNATI (AP) — Elly De La Cruz hit a three-run homer, drove in four runs and scored twice to lead the Cincinnati Reds to a 7-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday.

De La Cruz, who had three hits, joined Eric Davis and Barry Larkin as the only Reds players with 25 homers and 65 stolen bases in a season.

“It means a lot to me, those are great players,” De La Cruz said. “I feel great. I wanted to finish strong.”

De La Cruz stole his 100th career base in his 251st game on Friday night.

Rookie Rhett Lowder (2-2) made his fifth start for Cincinnati and allowed five hits in five innings. He has a 1.40 ERA through five starts, allowing one earned run or fewer in four of them.

With runners on first and third in the fourth, Lowder fell behind 3-0 to Connor Joe. He struck out Joe then got Nick Yorke to fly out ending the inning. He also worked through a bases-loaded jam in the fifth.

“That’s the story today, just being able to make those pitches in crunch time,” Lowder said. “Not panicking 3-0 gave me a little boost going (forward). I’m pretty happy with how I made pitches in big situations.”

It was Lowder’s first victory at Great American Ball Park after having his 14 1/3-inning scoreless streak snapped in a loss to the Twins on Sunday at Target Field.

“He made pitches when he needed to, which shows the maturity,” Reds manager David Bell said. “He’s prepared. He knows what he’s doing. With that movement, always gives him a chance.”

De La Cruz doubled and scored on Tyler Stephenson’s single to put the Reds ahead 1-0 in the third. Ty France followed with his 13th homer of the season to make the score 3-0.

In the fourth, De La Cruz’s three-run homer struck the railing just below the upper-level bar in right field to make the score 6-0.

Pirates rookie Jared jones (6-8) tied season-highs with six earned runs and two homers allowed.

Billy Cook hit a solo homer off Alan Busenitz in the ninth for Pittsburgh’s run.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Reds: LHP Sam Moll (left shoulder impingement) will not pitch this season. ... C Austin Wynns (right teres major tear) had planned for a rehab assignment this month, but instead will be shut down.

UP NEXT

Pirates: RHP Paul Skenes (10-3, 2.07) has the lowest ERA in the major leagues since debuting on May 11.

Reds: RHP Hunter Greene (9-4, 2.83) will come off the injured list to make his first start since Aug 13.
