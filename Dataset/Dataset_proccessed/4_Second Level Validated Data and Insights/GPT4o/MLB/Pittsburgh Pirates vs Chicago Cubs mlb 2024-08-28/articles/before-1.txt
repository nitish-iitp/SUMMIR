Chicago Cubs (67-66) vs. Pittsburgh Pirates (62-70)

 

With a record that is almost half, the Cubs enter this encounter on a high winning 5 out of their last 6 games. This season, the team combines .238 batting average with the most competent bull-pen in their only 3.75 ERA and 1.23 WHIP. Their ability bee is more reliable when it comes to slugging whiz at 393, and this weapon has been apparent in most of the games and played a major role in most of the games. As they face the Pirates, the Royals-Guardians faceoff later today might also attract betting interests, considering the tight race in the central divisions.

 

On the contrary, it has been a very tough season for the Pirates, which is quite evident from the below .500 record. No more so against the Cubbies, who have an almost even at .235 Batting Average against the Pirates; however, the pitching holds a 4.04 ERA and a higher opponent’s batting average. As they look to capitalize on their home field advantage, the game against the Cubs might set a tone similar to the much-anticipated Houston Astros vs Philadelphia Phillies game, promising intense competition and strategic plays.

 

Kyle Hendricks (3-10, 6.33 ERA) vs. Paul Skenes (8-2, 2.16 ERA)

 

Kyle Hendricks from the Cubs expects better answers after allowing 19 home runs. However, the experience is something Kyle Hendricks has, and this may prevent him from hitting his season high, which means a less 6.33 ERA on 101 innings Hendricks has mounted so far. Known for the placement of his pitches, Hendricks will have to lower his WHIP from 1.45 if the Cubs have any hopes of a fighting chance. However, his execution in the last innings could be the winning factor in this match.

 

On the other hand, one man who has been an asset for the teams is Paul Skenes, who features with a 2.16 ERA and WHIP of 0.94, which is very commendable. In the span of 104 innings, Skenes has demonstrated that he is a most efficient pitcher in hits and runs, which has been key for the Pirates in the games he has started. However, his most prized possession, striking out the batsmen that have seen him claiming 130 strikes, shall prove to be the biggest nightmare for the Cubs’ batters.

 

MLB Odds/Point Spread: Pittsburgh Pirates -1.5 +128, Total Odds: 7.5

 

The betting odds lean slightly in favor of the Pirates, particularly given their pitching advantage with Skenes on the mound and their home field setting. The over/under at 7.5 with a tendency towards the over, reflects expectations for a high-scoring game, aligning with both teams’ recent trends.

 

Chicago Cubs Betting Trends

 

The Cubs have been formidable lately, especially in scoring, which aligns with the trend of games going over the total. Their solid run in the past games, including a significant advantage when playing on the road against Pittsburgh, could influence bettors towards trusting in their continued success.

 

Pittsburgh Pirates Betting Trends

 

Despite the Pirates’ less favorable season record, their betting trends show a consistent pattern of high-scoring games at home, which could be critical for over bettors. Their performance against the Cubs historically, especially at home, suggests potential for them to upset the odds.

 

Chicago Cubs vs. Pittsburgh Pirates 8/28/24 Betting Picks

 

Given the current performance and statistical predictions, Skenes’ impressive pitching skills may prove tough for the Cubs to handle, and therefore, it is safe to predict a victory for the Pirates. Nonetheless, the Cubs have scored many runs in the recent games, and the Pirates have been up and down for most of the season, striking a likely risk-rewarding market for placing Chicago on the hands new-looking spread.

 

With this expectation, the safest bet would be on the team totals going over 7.5 because of the last matches of the selected teams. Most probably, the offered line will correlate with the Wickard or Hughes individual statistic.
