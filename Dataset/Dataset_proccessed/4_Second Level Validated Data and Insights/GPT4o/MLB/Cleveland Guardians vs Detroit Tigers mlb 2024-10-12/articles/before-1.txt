Do Tigers Have Any Confidence Left?

The big question for the Tigers heading into this game is do they have any sort of confidence left. The Tigers had a 2-1 series lead, and they had many chances in the last game, but they couldn’t pull out the win and ended up losing 5-4. The Tigers finished the game with nine hits but only four runs, and they ended up losing by a run. Reese Olson went four innings, giving up five hits and one run. Zach McKinstry did have a strong game, hitting a home run and driving in an RBI. The Tigers did use five bullpen arms, but they should be more rested now after having the day off. 

Getting the start for the Tigers will be Tarik Skubal who sits with a 1-0 record and an ERA of 0.00 during the playoffs. So far, he has had 14 strikeouts. Against the Guardians in the last game he went seven innings giving up three hits and zero runs. 

Why the Tigers Will Beat the Guardians
The Tigers have won each of their last eight games as road favorites against the Guardians.
The Guardians have lost five of their last six night playoff games after not playing the previous day.
The Tigers have covered the run line in each of their last 10 games against the Guardians at Progressive Field following a loss.
The Guardians have failed to cover the run line in each of their last nine games against the Tigers at Progressive Field following a win.
How Can the Guardians Get the Bats going?

The Guardians couldn’t get the bats going any in the last game they played against Skubal and in this game they are going to need to try to find a way to get them going. On Thursday, the Guardians scored five runs and that was enough for the one run victory. David Fry had a huge game, hitting a home run and driving in three RBIs. Jose Ramirez also hit a big home run to really install some life into the team. Tanner Bibee went four innings, giving up four hits and two runs. For the Guardians to find success in this game, they are going to need the pitching to be dominant. 

Detroit Tigers vs Cleveland Guardians Prediction

Give me Skubal with the season on the line. The Tigers wouldn’t rather have it any other way. Skubal has been dominant so far this season, and he’s going to dominate again here. He hasn’t given up a run yet in the playoffs, and I don’t think he will either against the Guardians offense. The Tigers are only going to need a couple of runs to get the job done, and they will get the job done. Back the Tigers on the money line.
