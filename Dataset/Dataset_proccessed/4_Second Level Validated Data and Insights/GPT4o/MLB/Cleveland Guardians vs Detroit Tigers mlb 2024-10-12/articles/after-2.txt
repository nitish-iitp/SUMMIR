Cleveland Guardians vs. Detroit Tigers in game 5 of ALDS, October 12, 2024
By Paul Hoynes, cleveland.com

CLEVELAND, Ohio — Manager Stephen Vogt was in his office talking to reporters a couple of hours before Saturday’s winner-take-all Game 5 against Detroit in the American League Division Series. He said he believed the Guardians would be boarding a flight to New York later that day.

What’s in New York? Why, the Yankees and the American League Championship Series that starts Monday night at Yankee Stadium.

All managers in Vogt’s position would probably say the same thing. But the Guardians actually made his words ring true by beating Tarik Skubal and the Tigers, 7-3, at Progressive Field. It will be Cleveland’s first appearance in the ALCS since 2016.

It was the 10th winner-take-all game in franchise history and their first victory in such a game since beating the Yankees in Game 5 of the 1997 ALDS.

After the game Vogt was asked about his pre-game comment.

“You have to believe,” said Vogt. “If you don’t believe in your group, don’t even show up. We knew, as soon as we got back to Cleveland (after Thursday’s 5-4 win) we had a chance. And, yes, we’re facing the best pitcher in the league, but that’s who that group in that room is.

“They wanted it. They wanted to face him today.

The Guardians won Saturday by doing a little of this and a little of that. Not only did they use eight pitchers, they needed a grand slam by Lane Thomas, another three-hit game by Steven Kwan and a two-inning save by closer Emmanuel Clase.

“This is who we are,” said Vogt before the game. “We’re a team that finds a way ... You just never know what kind of game you’re going to see."

Detroit took a 1-0 lead in the fifth, but it did not last long. The Guardians countered that with five runs in the bottom of fifth for a 5-1 lead against Skubal, who had thrown seven scoreless innings against the Guardians in Game 2 while barking at their fans.

Thomas’ slam highlighted the big inning, but it was the work beforehand that made it possible.

Andres Gimenez, with just one hit in the first four games of the series, hit a leadoff single. Steven Kwan and David Fry followed with singles to load the bases and bring Jose Ramirez to the plate. Ramirez had been intentionally walked in his previous at-bat, but this time there was no place to put him.

Ramirez yanked the first pitch he saw foul down the right field line. Skubal hit him on the left elbow with a 100 mph sinker on the next pitch to bring Gimenez home and tie the score.

Thomas skied Skubal’s next pitch, a 97 mph fastball, into the bleachers in left center field as Progressive Field erupted in celebration. It was the first postseason grand slam by a Cleveland player since Francisco Lindor slammed the Yankees in Game 2 of the ALDS in 2017.

Asked what he was looking for on the slam, Lane said, “It’s tough. He’s got 100 mph in the tank and 95 on the sinker. In the third inning, I had the bases loaded and I didn’t think he would come to me (with a fastball), but he proved me wrong. So the next time it was, ‘I’ve got to be ready for the fastball.’ He threw a good one that I could hit

In his first three postseason starts, Skubal had not allowed a run in 13 innings. In Game 5, he allowed five on six hits in six innings. The five runs tied a season high.

The Tigers were not intimidated by the 5-1 deficit.

Jake Rogers reached Hunter Gaddis for an RBI single in the sixth to make it 5-2. Colt Keith added an RBI double off Gaddis in the seventh to make it 5-3. Eli Morgan relieved and stopped the rally with consecutive strikeouts.

The Guardians didn’t leave that five-spot on an island.

Thomas scored Kwan with an infield single in the seventh for a 6-3 lead. The five RBI are the second most for one game in franchise history. Omar Vizquel holds the record, driving in six runs against Seattle in Game 3 of the 2001 ALDS.

Brayan Rocchio, who had a great series offensively and defensively, made it 7-3 with a single in the eighth.

Detroit, which stranded five runners in the first four innings, took a 1-0 lead in the fifth against rookie Andrew Walters. Shortstop Trey Sweeney greeted Walters with a leadoff walk. Pinch-hitter Kerry Carpenter, who didn’t start because of a left hamstring injury suffered in Game 4, sent a long single to the wall in right center field. It bounced off the wall past Jhonkensy Noel as Sweeney scored from first just ahead of a strong relay throw home by Gimenez.

The Guardians missed a scoring chance in the third. Rocchio, who entered the game hitting .333 (4 for 12) in the ALDS, lined a one-out single to left. Kwan sent a liner toward the left field foul line that Riley Greene dropped for a two-base error. Rocchio stopped at third.

Skubal struck out Fry and Ramirez was intentionally walked for the third time in the series to load the bases. Skubal popped up Thomas to end the inning.

Kwan started the first inning with a hard grounder to Sweeney at short. Sweeney didn’t handle it cleanly and was charged with an error. The error was later changed to a hit, which extended Kwan’s postseason hitting streak to 10 games to tie Kenny Lofton for the longest in Cleveland history.

The Guardians’ leadoff hitter hit .524 (11 for 21) in the ALDS. He is just the third player in history to have three consecutive three-hit postseason games. Tim Anderson and Hall of Famer Lou Brock are the others.

Starter Matthew Boyd pitched only two innings before being relieved by Cade Smith, but it was an interesting two innings.

He hit Justyn-Henry Malloy with his first pitch. A one-out walk to Riley Greene followed, but ended the inning with two straight strikeouts.

Parker Meadows, dropped from leadoff to No. 7 in the lineup against the Cleveland lefty, doubled to left with one out in the second. He stole third, but Boyd retired Rogers on a short fly ball to right as Meadows held third. He ended the inning by striking out Sweeney.

In two innings, Boyd struck out five, allowed one hit, one walk and hit a batter.

Smith, the hard-throwing rookie who struck out 103 batters during the regular season, followed with 1 2/3 scoreless innings. Smith and Tim Herrin are the only Cleveland pitchers to appear in all five ALDS games. His 12 strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings are the most in a league division series.

It was the earliest Smith has entered a game this season. On July 28, he appeared in the fourth inning against the Phillies.

The Guardians and Tigers played each other 18 times this year, 13 coming in the regular season. The Guardians won 10 of the 18 games.

“I have so much respect for A.J. Hinch and the Tigers,” said Vogt. “It was such a fun series. Again, it was indicative of our matchups throughout the regular season, and it’s kind of whoever got the big hit was going to win. Fortunately, Lane got it. They didn’t go away. They don’t quit. We don’t quit.”

The Tigers had a chance to eliminate the Guardians in Game 4 Thursday in Detroit, but the Guardians rallied for a 5-4 win to send the series back to Cleveland. In the five ALDS games, the Guards hit .234 (39 for 167) with 19 runs and four homers. The Tigers hit .214 (34 for 159) with 13 runs and two homers.

Next: The Guardians will face the Yankees in Game 1 of the ALCS on Monday at 7:38 p.m. TBS, WTAM, WMMS and the Guardians radio network will carry the game.
