The Cleveland Guardians are ecstatic to be facing Tarik Skubal Saturday afternoon. Would they rather be facing a myriad of Tigers’ relievers? Of course, but they are happy to have persevered and survived Game 4 and to have in the process forced a fifth and deciding game in their American League Division series.

Thursday Night, Guardians’ pinch hitter David Fry blasted a 2-run home run in the seventh inning to put Cleveland in front for good as the Guardians won the game 5-4.

The win snapped a string of 11 straight losses by Cleveland in elimination games dating back to Game 6 of the 1997 World Series.

As mentioned, Detroit will be sending Cy Young favorite Tarik Skubal to the mound in hope of reaching the ALCS for the first time since 2013. He will be opposed by Matthew Boyd.

Lets dive into the matchup and find a sweat or two.
