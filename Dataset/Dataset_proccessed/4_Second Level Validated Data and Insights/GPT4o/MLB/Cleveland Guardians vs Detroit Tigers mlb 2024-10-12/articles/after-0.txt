DETROIT -- It will all come down to a winner-take-all bout back in Cleveland on Saturday, as the American League Division Series between the Guardians and Tigers was evened at two games apiece following the Guards’ tense, come-from-behind, 5-4 victory at Comerica Park on Thursday night.

Game 5 was originally scheduled for 8 p.m. ET on Saturday but was moved up to 1 p.m. ET due to the threat of inclement weather. The winner will advance to face the Yankees in the ALCS beginning Monday night in the Bronx.

“These elimination games are incredible,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “Everything that we've been playing for up to this point is now going to be on Saturday.”

Game 5 on Saturday from Progressive Field is expected to feature a rematch between mentor and mentee, as Cleveland will roll out veteran Matthew Boyd, who spent eight seasons in Detroit, while the Tigers will turn to AL Cy Young Award favorite Tarik Skubal, who was brilliant in Game 2.

“I think we've seen him three or four times now this year, and I think we'll have a pretty good game plan to go against him,” the Guardians’ Game 4 hero, David Fry, said. “He's had a heck of a season. He's been really good and threw well the other day and we're going to have to be ready to go. But it'll be a fun one, and Cleveland will be loud.”

Skubal has not allowed a run in either of his two outings in his first postseason, having blanked the Guardians over seven scoreless innings and showing incredible emotion in the process. He has a 24-inning scoreless streak dating back to the regular season. Boyd, who was instrumental in Skubal’s development, held the Tigers scoreless over 4 2/3 innings on Monday.

In all best-of-five postseason series, teams that have won Game 4 when trailing 2-1 have then won Game 5 and the series 27 of 48 times (56%). Heading into Game 5, teams are only 62-66 all-time in the postseason when playing a winner-take-all game in their home ballpark. That includes the Brewers’ loss to the Mets in Game 3 of this year’s NL Wild Card Series.

The Guardians and Tigers split the first four games of this round at the other’s ballpark, setting the stage for a dramatic conclusion to this AL Central matchup.

“I'm both excited and exhausted right now,” Guardians catcher Austin Hedges said, “but that's what the postseason is all about.”

Who are the starting pitchers?
Tigers: LHP Tarik Skubal
Take your pick of any pitcher in the league this year to start a winner-take-all game, and Skubal might be the most popular selection. Beyond a dominant regular season that included the American League’s pitching Triple Crown, Skubal has not allowed a run in two starts this postseason, covering 13 innings. That includes seven scoreless innings in Game 2 of this series on Monday at Progressive Field.

Guardians: LHP Matthew Boyd
The Guardians will start Boyd, who danced around some traffic in 4 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 2 of the ALDS. Because of the pressure that facing Skubal creates, Cleveland knows it can’t afford to give up many runs, so expect manager Stephen Vogt to turn to his bullpen at the first sign of trouble. If he has to do that early, that could mean the Guardians would have to tap into some relievers who haven’t had much experience this October.

What are the starting lineups?
Tigers: With Kerry Carpenter not starting because of his left hamstring injury, Justyn-Henry Malloy, who had a pair of singles off Boyd on Monday and a double against Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase in Game 4, got the nod at DH. It's the similar lineup the Tigers utilized in Game 2, but this time, Riley Greene and Andy Ibáñez flip-flopped spots in the order.

1. Justyn-Henry Malloy, DH
2. Matt Vierling, 3B
3. Riley Greene, LF
4. Andy Ibáñez, 2B
5. Wenceel Pérez, RF
6. Spencer Torkelson, 1B
7. Parker Meadows, CF
8. Jake Rogers, C
9. Trey Sweeney, SS

Guardians: Andrés Giménez moved down one spot in the order, but everyone, except catcher Austin Hedges, from the Game 2 lineup is set to face Skubal.

1. Steven Kwan, LF
2. David Fry, DH
3. José Ramírez, 3B
4. Lane Thomas, CF
5. Josh Naylor, 1B
6. Jhonkensy Noel, RF
7. Bo Naylor, C
8. Andrés Giménez, 2B
9. Brayan Rocchio, SS

How will the bullpens line up after the starter?
Tigers: Expect all hands on deck after Friday’s off-day, including right-hander Beau Brieske even after David Fry’s go-ahead home run off of him in Game 4. Left-handers Tyler Holton and Sean Guenther could be key to keeping Cleveland’s left-handed pinch-hitters on the bench.

Guardians: Even with Boyd getting the start, Cleveland likely will try to get the ball into Smith’s hand as quickly as possible. They’d then try to replicate what they did in Games 1, 2 and 4 by leaning heavily on the Big Four: Smith, Tim Herrin, Hunter Gaddis and Clase. If Smith opens the game, expect those four to do the heavy lifting, but guys like Eli Morgan, Erik Sabrowski and Andrew Walters could get into the mix.

Any injuries of note?
Tigers: Carpenter left Game 4 with a left hamstring injury after scoring from second base on a sixth-inning single. He was not in the starting lineup for Game 5.

Guardians: Utility man Tyler Freeman strained his left oblique during the team’s workout on the off day on Sunday and was replaced on the roster by Angel Martinez prior to Game 2.

Who’s hot?
Tigers: Meadows has hit safely in each of Detroit’s six games this postseason. He’s the first Tiger to hit in six straight postseason games to begin his career since Al Kaline in 1968. … Malloy is 5-for-7 with two walks this postseason. … Pérez had two singles in as many at-bats in Game 4 after entering as a pinch-hitter for Spencer Torkelson.

Guardians: Fry is fresh off of being the hero, extending the Guardians’ season at least one more game. He launched the go-ahead two-run homer in the seventh inning on Thursday before laying down the safety squeeze in the ninth that led to the victory. He went 0-for-3 against Skubal on Monday, but maybe the momentum he built in Game 4 will carry into Game 5.
