If you’ve seen the White Sox lose 114 times this season, you’ve seen them lose in every way imaginable.

In their 6-4 loss Wednesday to the Guardians that completed a three-game sweep and put them six losses away from tying the 1962 Mets’ modern-era record of 120 in a season, the Sox twice saw the Guardians score two runs on infield singles by the same player.

Lane Thomas beat out a slow roller to third baseman Miguel Vargas with two outs in the first inning, allowing Steven Kwan to score easily from third and Jose Ramirez to race in all the way from second.
