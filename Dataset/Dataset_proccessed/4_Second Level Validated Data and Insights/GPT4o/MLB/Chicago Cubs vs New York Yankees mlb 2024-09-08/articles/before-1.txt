New York Yankees vs Chicago Cubs Prediction

I’ll lean Yankees here. Cole hasn’t been too bad over his last three starts, even with the loss (5.0 innings; three earned). Over that trio Cole is 2-1 with four earned in 17.0 total innings. As for Taillon, he’s coming off 7.0 clean frames versus Pittsburgh but had given up eight earned over his previous 11.2 innings.

On Saturday the Yankees had a pretty tepid offensive day to put it generously; New York had only four team hits. The good news is that only one pitcher (Nestor Cortes) came out in relief. New York’s pen will be well-stocked for the finale.
