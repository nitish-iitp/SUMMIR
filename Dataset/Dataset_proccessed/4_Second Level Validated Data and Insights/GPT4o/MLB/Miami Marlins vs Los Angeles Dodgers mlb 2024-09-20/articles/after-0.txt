Shohei Ohtani records baseball's first 50-50 season with huge night in Miami

The Los Angeles Dodgers gave Shohei Ohtani a record-setting contract in the offseason with the full knowledge that at least during the first year of the deal, their new two-way superstar would be a one-way player.

Ohtani, though, even stripped of one of his superpowers, has still had a historic season that ranks high on the list of all-time offensive performances and is making a $700 million contract look like a bargain.

Ohtani added a new chapter to the MLB record book with his 50th home run of 2024 on Thursday to become the first player to reach 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a single season.

Founding the 50-50 club would be enough for most players, but Ohtani did it on a monster night with numbers straight out of a video game. The Japanese star hit three home runs and finished 6-for-6 with 10 RBIs, two doubles and a pair of stolen bases to power a 20-4 win over the Miami Marlins. His season totals stand at 51 home runs and 51 stolen bases with nine games remaining in the regular season.

It was such a magical performance that Ohtani received a curtain call on the road in Miami.

"To be honest, I'm the one most surprised," Ohtani said about his big night through interpreter Will Ireton. "I don't know where this came from."

To cap it all off, the Dodgers clinched a playoff berth with the victory, meaning Ohtani will compete in the MLB postseason for the first time in his career.

"Although I switched uniforms, came to a new team, my goal was always to be in the playoffs," said Ohtani, who spent his first six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels. "I'm glad we could make it today."

Ohtani reached the 40-40 mark faster than any player in MLB history which gave him a clear shot at a 50-50 season. The spotlight grew brighter as he crept closer to the milestone, and after reaching the summit, Ohtani admitted he was glad to put it behind him.

"If I'm being honest, it's something I wanted to get it over (with) as soon as possible," Ohtani said.

Ohtani's big night came in the same stadium where he struck out his former Angels teammate Mike Trout to clinch the World Baseball Classic title for Japan in March 2023.

"I've had perhaps the most memorable moments here in my career," he said. "This stadium has become one of my favorite stadiums."

Ohtani reached 50 stolen bases by swiping third in the top of first inning on Thursday and added another when he stole second in the top of the second.

Even with history two homers away, Ohtani said he was not swinging for the fences.

"I believe the best way for me to hit a homer is to have quality at-bats," Ohtani said later on MLB Network. "I tried not to aim to hit a homer."

He connected on his 49th home run of the year — a two-run shot — in the top of the sixth with a no-doubt 438-foot blast into the upper deck in right center at loanDepot Park. The 30-year-old established baseball’s 50-50 club with a 391-foot, two-run blast to left in his next at-bat in the top of the seventh. He added his third homer of the night in the top of the ninth with a three-run shot to right center that traveled 440 feet.

Joe Davis, the Dodgers' lead play-by-play announcer, called it "the greatest day in baseball history," as Ohtani's third home run flew toward the stands.

Marlins manager Skip Schumaker was later asked about his decision to pitch to Ohtani instead of walking him late in the game with his team trailing by a large margin.

"That's a bad move, baseball-wise, karma-wise, baseball gods-wise," Schumaker said. "You go after him and see if you can get him out. I think out of respect for the game, we were going to go after him. He hit the home run. That's just part of the deal. He's hit 50 of them. He's the most talented player I've ever seen."

Ohtani homered and stole a base in the same game for the 13th time this season to equal the MLB mark set by Rickey Henderson in 1986. He is the first player since at least 1901 with at least five hits and multiple home runs and stolen bases in the same game.

The base where Ohtani recorded his 50th steal was taken out of the game shortly afterward, and one of MLB's authenticators was hard at work in the Dodgers' dugout authenticating the tools — shoes, gloves and other equipment — Ohtani used to make history after his 50th home run.

Ohtani's historic season has come during a whirlwind period for the superstar. He signed a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers in December and announced the news of his marriage in February. He was thrust into controversy in March, when it was revealed his former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara stole millions from him to fund a gambling habit. Ohtani was not accused of any wrongdoing.

He entered his first year with the Dodgers as a full-time designated hitter while recovering from a September 2023 elbow procedure to repair a tear in his ulnar collateral ligament.

None of it had any impact on Ohtani, who continued to do things on the field once considered impossible.

The 50-50 mark was viewed by many as unreachable because of the elite mix of power, speed, consistency and health required. Power hitters generally do not steal this many bases, and basestealers don't often hit for this much power. There have been players with more home runs and more stolen bases but never one who simultaneously excelled at both the way Ohtani has in 2024.

According to MLB.com, only four other players have hit at least 50 home runs and stolen 20 bases in the same season.

Prior to this year, there had only been five to even enter the 40-40 club — Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Alfonso Soriano and Ronald Acuna Jr. — and none came particularly close to the 50-50 mark. Rodriguez was the closest with 42 home runs and 46 stolen bases in 1998. Acuna, who swiped 73 bases last year, was the only player to reach 50 in either category. Ohtani was the first player with at least a 43-43 season.

Ohtani became the third Dodgers player to join the 30-30 club in late July and became the fastest in history to reach the 40-40 mark on Aug. 23, when he stole a base and hit a walk-off grand slam. Ohtani entered the 40-40 club in the Dodgers' 129th game (it was Ohtani's 126th contest).

Ohtani has hit for power in the past, connecting on 46 home runs in 2021, 34 in 2022 and 44 last season. With no pitching obligations in 2024, he has been free to pour more time and effort into basestealing and has become an elite talent in that facet as well, trailing only the Cincinnati Reds' Elly De La Cruz — who has stolen 64 bases and been caught 16 times — among MLB players.

Ohtani has blown past his previous career high of 26 stolen bases while only being caught four times, and has been successful in 28 straight attempts. The Japanese star stole 16 bases over the first three months of the season before exploding with 27 in July and August.

Ohtani is the first Japanese player to record a 50-homer season — and registered the 50th overall in MLB history — and is five stolen bases away from Ichiro Suzuki's mark for the most steals by a Japanese player in a single campaign. He also became the first Dodgers player to hit 50 home runs, breaking the previous franchise record of 49 set by Shawn Green in 2001.

"You're the greatest player who's ever lived, and I'm honored to be mentioned in the same sentence as you, at least for this week," Green said in a video statement released by the Dodgers.

Ohtani leads the National League in home runs, RBIs (120) and on-base plus slugging percentage (1.005) and is fifth with a .294 batting average. He is the leading candidate to win the NL MVP award. Ohtani was the American League MVP in 2021 and 2023 and would join Frank Robinson as the only players to win in both leagues if he wins the NL honor.

The Dodgers clinched a playoff berth but are looking to head into the postseason as the NL West division champions. The team leads the San Diego Padres by four games in the race for the division crown.

"Now my goal is to be able to perform well in the playoffs," Ohtani said.
