Shohei Ohtani created MLB history on Thursday, becoming the first player in the majors with 50 home runs and stolen bases in a single season. The Los Angeles Dodgers took on the struggling Miami Marlins, where the team dominated and cruised to a 20-4 victory. After the victory, the Dodgers clinched a postseason berth and look to earn their third straight NL West division title. However, the headlines were hijacked by the biggest name in baseball.

Ohtani Roundup

The name Shohei Ohtani reverberates throughout the baseball globe for many reasons. Coming to the Los Angeles Angels as a two-way player, he changed the game with his dominant pitching and hitting. After six years with the organization, the two-time MVP and Silver Slugger recipient went cross town to join the Los Angeles Dodgers in a big move last winter. After undergoing Tommy John surgery, Ohtani took the role of designated hitter for the NL West powerhouse.

In 2024, Ohtani’s slash line looks straight out of a video game. The 30-year-old slashes .294/.376/.629 in 2024, amassing 176 hits, 120 RBI and 377 RBI in 153 games. Throughout the season, Ohtani’s presence in the batter’s box haunts pitchers, but on the base paths, his ability to swipe bags from first and second created another strong dynamic to his impeccable game.

History Forever Written

On Thursday, the Dodgers played the Marlins in a game that had eyes on Ohtani adding towards his chance of a 50/50 season. Going into the game, Ohtani had 48 home runs and 49 stolen bases. Hitting leadoff, he looked to make his mark and he did just that. The NL MVP favorite for 2024 created his MVP moment. Shohei went perfect, hitting 6-6. He doubled in the first inning, and after Freddie Freeman walked, a double steal gave Ohtani his 50th steal. In the third inning, Ohtani added his 51st steal after swiping second on a single.

Ohtani needed two more home runs to get to 50. In the sixth inning, Ohtani homered. The next inning, Ohtani created history with his 50th home run. In the ninth inning, Ohtani made it 51 on the season. In a night of breaking history, Shohei did it in style, adding 0.7 to his WAR alone just from this game. Ohtani posted 17 total bases, 10 RBI, and three home runs.

After such a successful game and breaking a monumental record, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred weighed in on history,

“While Shohei Ohtani has been a groundbreaking player for many years, his latest feat as the first 50/50 player in the history of Major League Baseball reflects not just his amazing power-and-speed talent, but his character, his drive, and his commitment to all-around excellence. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I congratulate Shohei on this remarkable achievement. We are proud that he continues to take our game to new heights.”

With nine games left in the season, Ohtani looks to add to his 50/50 season, and could even shoot for a 55/55 season with his dominance in 2024.
