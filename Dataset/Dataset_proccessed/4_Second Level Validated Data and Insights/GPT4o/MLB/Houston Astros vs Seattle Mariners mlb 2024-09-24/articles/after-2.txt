HOUSTON — Jason Heyward hit a go-ahead, two-run homer and made a dazzling defensive play as the Houston Astros beat the Seattle Mariners 4-3 to clinch their fourth consecutive AL West championship. Alex Bregman and Kyle Tucker each added a solo home run for the Astros, who are headed to the postseason for the eighth year in a row. The Astros trailed by one in the fifth inning when Victor Caratini singled before moving to second on a sacrifice bunt by Jeremy Peña. Heyward, who wowed on defense in the top of the inning, launched his home run to the second deck in right field off Logan Gilbert to put Houston on top 4-3.
