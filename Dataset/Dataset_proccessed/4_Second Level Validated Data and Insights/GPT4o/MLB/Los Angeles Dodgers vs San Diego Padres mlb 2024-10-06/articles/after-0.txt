Tensions ran high at Dodger Stadium during Game 2 of the National League Division Series on Sunday night. 

Over the last six years, the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres have turned into bitter rivals. Ever since Manny Machado switched uniforms from blue to brown after the 2018 season, betting the entirety of his $300 million contract that his Padres would win the World Series before the Dodgers. 

Words have been exchanged, benches have cleared, and emotions have boiled over after both teams took turns defeating the other in a playoff series over the last five seasons. 

So with Game 1 of their playoff trilogy now in the rearview, the Padres knew they had to recapture their identity for Game 2. 

If Yu Darvish could pitch against the Dodgers as he has his entire career, if San Diego slugged as they have in the second half of the season, and played defense they way they have all year, then they would even the National League Division Series at one game apiece. 

And that’s exactly what happened over the course of nine innings and 27 outs in Game 2 of the NLDS at Dodger Stadium. 

The Padres hit a total of six homers, blowing out the Dodgers 10-2, because Darvish pitched like the five-time All-Star he is, carving up the Dodgers lineup like a chef serving Thanksgiving dinner.

Darvish dumbfounded Dodgers hitters, allowing just one run on three hits in seven strong innings with three strikeouts. 

The Padres immediately gave Darvish a lead to protect after Fernando Tatis Jr. took Dodgers’ starter Jack Flaherty deep for a solo shot into the Dodgers bullpen in the first inning.

"That's just our mindset," said Tatis Jr. of the Padres wanting to throw the first punch and put runs on the board early. "How we are coming out of the gate with our foot on the pedal since the beginning. That's one thing that we have been doing since the entire year. So we're definitely not changing that and we're just adding more pressure. And that's what we're capable of as a group. And we're going to keep with that mentality."

Former Dodger, David Peralta extended the lead with a two-run homer in the top of the second.

The Dodgers loaded the bases in the second inning, but they wilted when Tommy Edman hit a line drive to Luis Arraez at first base that turned into an easy inning-ending double play. 

The Padres defense dazzled, taking away runs instead of giving away runs the way they did in Game 1 on Saturday night. 

Jurickson Profar set the tone in the first inning, robbing former MVP Mookie Betts from a game-tying home run.

Profar’s web gem was just one of many on the night for San Diego, as they flashed the leather all night long, perplexing the Dodgers hitters and squashing rallies before they began.

The Padres got back to the brand of baseball that got them here, and made them many MLB analysts pick to win the World Series this season. More importantly, it helped them head back down the 5-freeway with a series split in hand. 

That didn't stop the bad blood between the two teams from boiling over onto the field throughout the game. The hatred and vitriol between the two teams, and their fan bases was on full display during the game.

First it was Profar who jawed with fans after his home run robbery in the first inning. Then it was Tatis Jr. who got into it with many of the 54,119 fans in attendance. Later, it was Flaherty and Machado exchanging expletives after he struck out for the first out in the sixth inning.

"They didn't like the pitch to Tatis," said Flaherty of what he believed prompted the exchange between him and Machado. "I was fired up after getting Manny out in a big spot in the playoffs. Then he did some s*** between innings, he threw the ball at our dugout, and then me and him were going at it. The umpires immediately went over to talk to him. Our dugout was fired up, because there ain't no reason for that."

Finally, it was fans throwing baseballs onto the field during the bottom of the seventh inning that prompted Dodger Stadium security to encompass the outfield, leading to a lengthy delay.

"We're in a hostile environment," said Padres' manager Mike Shildt of the commotion in the seventh inning. "What I got out of it was a bunch of dudes that showed up in front of a big, hostile crowd with stuff being thrown at them and said, "We're going to talk with our play; we're not going to back down; we're going to elevate our game; we're going to be together; and we're going to take care of business."

Los Angeles only was able to muster up a few more opportunities before the Padres broke the game open with six total home runs in the blowout victory. The six homers allowed by the Dodgers were the most the team has ever allowed in a playoff game in franchise history.

Tatis Jr. hit two, with Peralta, rookie Jackson Merrill, Xander Bogaerts, and catcher Kyle Higashioka all hitting one.

Max Muncy hit a home run with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.

"We were sh** tonight," said Muncy of the loss. "You just have to flush it and move on. Like I said, we were sh** tonight, but that's not us as a group. We've been really good all year. We've come back from bad games before."

The Dodgers now look to avoid deja vu from their 2022 NLDS series loss to San Diego. In that series, the Dodgers won the first game, then proceeded to lose the next three, including back-to-back games at Petco Park. 

The Dodgers have lost four consecutive Game 2's of a playoff series and seven of eight overall.

The series now shifts to San Diego for Game 3 on Tuesday night at 6:08 PM PT.
