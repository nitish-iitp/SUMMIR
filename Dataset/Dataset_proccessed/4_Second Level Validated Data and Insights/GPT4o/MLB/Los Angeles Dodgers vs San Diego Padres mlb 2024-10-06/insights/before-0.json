        "Shohei Ohtani isn't nervous about his first post-season game in MLB.",
        "This will be the third post-season matchup between the two clubs in the past five years, with the Dodgers sweeping San Diego in 2020 before the Padres flipped the script in the 2022 NLDS.",
        "Regardless of how complete a team San Diego is, all the pressure in this series falls on the Dodgers\u2019 shoulders.",
        "With the MVP trio of Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, it\u2019s World Series or bust for the foreseeable future at Chavez Ravine.",
        "San Diego handled business against Los Angeles for most of the regular season, but the Dodgers locked up the NL West title with a series win against the Padres in the last week of September.",
        "For as many pitching injuries as the Dodgers sustained this season, it really didn\u2019t matter as the best offence in baseball by OPS and a better-than-advertised bullpen carried them to a 98-win season anyway.",
        "Ohtani, Betts and Freeman rightfully get all the headlines, but the four through nine of Los Angeles\u2019 order features a mix of solid veteran contributors Teoscar Hernandez, Will Smith and Max Muncy.",
        "Ohtani enters October coming off one of the most staggering months of his career, slashing a ridiculous .393/.458/.766 with 10 home runs in September, helping L.A. lock down the best record in baseball.",
        "The Dodger bullpen quietly stabilized after the trade deadline, pitching to a 3.29 ERA while holding opposing hitters to a .219 average against.",
        "The likes of Michael Kopech, Evan Phillips, Alex Vesia and Blake Treinen have been among baseball\u2019s stingiest relievers in the second half and will be called upon to play a major role in this series once the Dodgers get past their top two starters.",
        "Led by Fernando Tatis Jr. and supported by Kyle Higashioka, San Diego\u2019s offence continued to click in the wild-card round.",
        "Tatis went 4-for-6 against Atlanta, including his epic two-run blast in the first inning of Game 1.",
        "In the 25-year-old\u2019s brief post-season career, he now owns a 1.300 OPS with three home runs and seven walks in just 35 plate appearances.",
        "Higashioka homered twice in the series and star rookie Jackson Merrill looked ready for the playoff stage, going 3-for-7 with a double and rally-sealing triple over the two games against the Braves.",
        "Michael King introduced himself to the national audience with 12 strikeouts in his October debut.",
        "Even with Joe Musgrove out for the NLDS, San Diego\u2019s starting pitching will continue to be in good hands with King, Dylan Cease, Yu Darvish and Martin Perez.",
        "For the entirety of the 2024 season, Dodgers starters ranked 19th in MLB with a 4.23 ERA \u2014 made worse by a 4.57 second-half mark that leaves them vulnerable heading into this series.",
        "Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Jack Flaherty are the known variables for Games 1 and 2, but it\u2019s beyond those two where questions will arise.",
        "Walker Buehler and Landon Knack were the other two starters on the roster as the regular season came to a close, and neither instilled much confidence with their performance leading into the post-season.",
        "Freeman\u2019s status could also be cause for concern if his ankle sprain limits or forces him to miss time in the series.",
        "Manny Machado, Jurickson Profar, Xander Bogaerts and Jake Cronenworth combined to go 2-for-27 with eight strikeouts against Atlanta.",
        "Machado, Profar and Bogaerts have all been below-average hitters by wRC+ over their post-season careers.",
        "San Diego is going to need more than Tatis, Merrill and Luis Arraez to string together hits if they want to match the firepower coming out of the Dodgers\u2019 dugout."
