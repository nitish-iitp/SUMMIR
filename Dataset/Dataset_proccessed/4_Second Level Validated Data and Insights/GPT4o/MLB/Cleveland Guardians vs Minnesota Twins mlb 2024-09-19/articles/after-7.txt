Guardians celebrate as they clinch playoff berth

CLEVELAND, Ohio — A season of unexpected success will continue into October for the Cleveland Guardians, who clinched a Major League Baseball playoff spot with a 3-2 win in 10 innings Thursday against the Twins at Progressive Field.

Andrés Giménez drilled an RBI single into right field off Twins lefty Caleb Thielbar to score automatic runner José Ramírez for Cleveland’s second straight walk-off victory and seventh of the season.

The Guardians (89-65) are 10-3 in extra-inning games and notched their 42nd comeback win while improving the best home record in the AL to 48-28.

Giménez’s base hit touched off a wild celebration between first and second base. It was the fourth career walk-off plate appearance for Giménez and his second this season.

“I mean, that’s us, that’s the Cleveland Guardians this whole year,” Giménez said. ”We never give up. The guys in the bullpen really give us a chance to stay in the game, and from there we just have to do our job and try to keep the line moving.”

The Guardians were not a popular pick to reach the playoffs when the season started, but have spent the last 23 weeks perched atop the American League Central Division, yielding sole possession of the division’s top spot for only one day, when they shared the position with Kansas City last month.

Behind first-year manager Stephen Vogt, Cleveland became the second team in the AL to claim a spot in the playoffs after the Yankees, who punched their ticket late Wednesday in Seattle. It marks the 17th playoff appearance in franchise history for the club with baseball’s longest World Series championship drought, a dry spell that dates back to 1948.

Vogt said until he saw Giménez’s line drive hit green grass, he had not allowed himself to get excited about reaching the postseason.

“We just started hugging,” Vogt said. “Alby (bench coach Craig Albernaz) and just what this group has been through. This is really special. The goal is to get in and then from here we keep pushing. Once you get in, you have a chance.”

Guardians rookie Joey Cantillo pitched into the fifth inning before turning things over to the top-ranked bullpen in baseball. Cleveland relievers tossed 5 2/3 scoreless innings, holding the Twins hitless and striking out eight.

Minnesota threatened to score in the top of the 10th as Eli Morgan loaded the bases by hitting Matt Wallner with a pitch and walking Manuel Margot. But Morgan retired Carlos Correa on a pop to first base in foul territory and escaped the inning when Byron Buxton sent a fly ball to Lane Thomas in right for the final out. Morgan (3-0, 1.64) earned his third win while Thielbar (3-4, 5.65) lost for just the second time in his last 14 appearances.

Guardians vs Minnesota Twins, September 19, 2024

Cantillo was brilliant through four innings, but ran into trouble in the fifth when Kyle Farmer led off with a double and Willi Castro walked to set up a two-run double by Margot. Cantillo worked ahead in the count, but left a changeup over the middle of the plate that Margot drilled to the gap in left center.

Thomas cut the ball off, but did not handle the bounce cleanly, allowing Castro to come all the way around and score for a 2-1 Twins lead. Nick Sandlin relieved Cantillo and walked Correa before striking out Buxton and Carlos Santana to end the inning.

Cleveland tied the score in the bottom of the sixth after loading the bases against Minnesota lefty Cole Irvin. Base hits by Josh Naylor, Giménez and Jhonkensy Noel set the stage for a Brayan Rocchio RBI sacrifice fly to center that knotted the score at two runs apiece.

Cantillo struck out six and walked three, allowing two runs (one earned) on three hits in his third start since rejoining the roster Sept. 9 when Alex Cobb went on the injured list with blisters on his right hand. Since his return, Cantillo has logged at least four scoreless innings in each outing, including six perfect frames against the White Sox and 21 strikeouts to go along with four walks in 16 innings.

Cantillo said Thursday’s effort showed heart.

“Everyone’s been saying all year, everybody on this team loves each other and plays for each other,” Cantillo said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re down three, down two or tied, this team is going to fight until the 27th out.”

Rookie designated hitter Kyle Manzardo, batting second in Vogt’s lineup for the first time this season, opened the scoring when he yanked a changeup from Twins starter Simeon Woods Richardson into the seats in right for his fourth home run and second of the series. Manzardo added a one-out single in the third and a check-swing infield hit in the fifth for his fourth multi-hit game in 16 September appearances.

Manzardo entered Thursday’s game batting .357 (15 for 42) with four home runs, seven RBI and a 1.104 OPS in 16 games since being recalled from Triple-A Columbus on Sept. 1.
