Milwaukee Brewers vs St. Louis Cardinals Prediction

The St. Louis Cardinals have nothing to play for at this stage, and they look like it more times than not. Steven Matz doesn’t have the sample size to trust in a spot like this, and he’s been rough in limited innings. Aaron Civale is coming off a decent month of August, so he’s starting to find his footing after some shaky performances. Cheap price, I’m not sure how the Brewers aren’t the pick in this spot. Give me the Brewers in game 2 against the Cardinals.
