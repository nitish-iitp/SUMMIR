DENVER — Veteran right-hander Kyle Hendricks is still collecting firsts.

In the Cubs’ 6-2 victory against the Rockies on Sunday, he put on a master class of in-game adjustments and execution. The only run he allowed was a solo homer to Jacob Stallings. And that was one of just two hits he surrendered in six innings.

Hendricks became the first Cubs pitcher to go that deep into a game at Coors Field without allowing more than two hits and one run.
