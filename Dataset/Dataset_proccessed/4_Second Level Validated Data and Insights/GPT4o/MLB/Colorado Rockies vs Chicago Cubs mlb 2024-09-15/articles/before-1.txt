DENVER — Rockies left-hander Kyle Freeland challenged Cody Bellinger up and in with a sinker. But Bellinger’s smooth swing met it out in front to drive a solo home run just over the right-field wall.

Add Freeland to the list of left-handed pitchers who have been victimized by Bellinger this year.

“We kind of have an inside joke, me and the hitting coaches, with lefties,” Bellinger told the Sun-Times last month. “It’s just funny where I just feel comfortable against them.”
