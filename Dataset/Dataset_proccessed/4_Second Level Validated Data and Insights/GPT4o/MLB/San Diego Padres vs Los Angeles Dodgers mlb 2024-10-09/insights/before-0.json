        "Hazel Mae reports from San Diego ahead of Game 3 of the NLDS between the Padres and Dodgers to look at how both teams expect to keep a high-intensity level throughout the series before providing injury updates to Xander Bogaerts and Freddie Freeman.",
        "In a statement emailed to season ticket holders and posted on social media, Padres team president Erik Greupner credited fans with creating the best home-field advantage in baseball while reiterating that any fan who throws items onto the field or makes offensive, foul or abusive comments to anyone will be ejected.",

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "On Monday, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said it was 'bothersome' and 'unsettling' that a ball Machado threw into the Dodgers dugout seemed intended for him during the Padres\u2019 10-2 win the night before. Machado said he was merely throwing in a ball after infield warmups between innings.",
        "Asked about Roberts' comments, Padres manager Mike Shildt said he would never disparage a player on another team or an entire team.",
        "Shildt said, 'I thought Manny\u2019s exhibition of professionalism and leadership were on display the other night in a very tough environment. He nor I nor anyone would profess to be perfect, but Manny has made some strides that are very impressive both on and off the field. It\u2019s been a privilege to witness that.'",
        "Rookie Jackson Merrill said, 'Manny has been a really good leader. He\u2019s done a really good job keeping us focused on that one thing. I don\u2019t think any of us view him in a different way besides being a leader.'"
