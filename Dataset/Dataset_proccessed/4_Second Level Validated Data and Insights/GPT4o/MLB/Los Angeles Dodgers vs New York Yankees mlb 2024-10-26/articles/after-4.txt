The 2024 World Series continued on Saturday with the New York Yankees trying to even the series with the Los Angeles Dodgers following a gut-wrenching, 10th-inning loss in Game 1 at Dodger Stadium on Friday, but ultimately coming up short, 4-2, and going down 2-0 in the series.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto was sharp as the Dodgers' starter, only allowing one run. Carlos Rodón was taken off after allowing three runs in the third inning.

Final: Dodgers 4, Yankees 2

Kavner: Aaron Boone thought he saw a positive sign in Aaron Judge's last at-bat of Game 1, a pop-out to shortstop that Boone thought Judge barely got under. Whatever he saw didn't lead to production in Game 2 for the presumptive AL MVP. Judge is now 1-for-9 with six strikeouts in the World Series, one of which came as the Yankees tried to mount a ninth-inning comeback. The Yankees loaded the bases, putting the winning run on base, but the Dodgers survived and take a commanding 2-0 lead to the Bronx. Now they await word on their own presumptive MVP.

Ninth inning

Top 9: Stanton gets Yankees closer

Thosar: Anthony Volpe's weakness was fully exposed in the most important at-bat of his career to date. With the bases loaded and one out, Blake Treinen threw sweeper after sweeper after sweeper against Volpe, and the 23-year-old Yankees shortstop swung at all of them. Volpe struggled in his sophomore season this year with laying off outside pitches, and he just couldn't hold back in the ninth inning.

Kanver: Bases loaded, ninth inning, team at-bat trailing. Have we heard this before already? Treinen got a huge strikeout on Anthony Volpe. Alex Vesia now enters. Jose Trevino is pinch-hitting for Austin Wells with the Yankees down to their last out. What a start to the World Series.

Kavner: Well, things are getting interesting. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the ninth, but an RBI single from Giancarlo Stanton that hopped off the third-base bag, an eight-pitch single from Jazz Chisholm Jr. and an Anthony Rizzo hit by pitch have loaded the bases on Blake Treinen. The tying run's at second, the go-ahead run's at first, and there's only one out.

Seventh inning

Top 7: Yamamoto walks off

Kavner: Yamamoto got the first out of the seventh inning before departing with a hug from Dave Roberts and a standing ovation from the crowd of 52,725. He allowed just one hit, a solo homer, before retiring the final 11 batters he faced in his first career World Series start. Only one other Dodgers pitcher — Rich Hill in 2018 — has thrown at least six innings while allowing one hit in a World Series game. Dodgers fans might want to forget how that one ended.

Sixth inning

Top 6: Judge strikes out again

Kavner: Yamamoto is through six scoreless innings. The only hit he has allowed is Soto's solo homer in the third. He has retired 10 straight since then. This is his longest outing since ... the last time he faced the Yankees, on June 7 in New York. In 13 innings against them, he has allowed just three hits and one run. Lefty Anthony Banda is up in the Dodgers' pen, but there's no one throwing yet. Lefties Jazz Chisholm and Anthony Rizzo are due up in the 7th. Yamamoto's at 80 pitches.

Oct 26, 2024 - 10:02a ET
Fifth inning

Top 5: Yamamoto in control

Kavner: Yamamoto has really settled in, retiring seven straight since the Soto homer. Through five innings, that's the Yankees' only hit of the night. Yamamoto has not gone more than five innings in a start since returning on Sept. 10 from a shoulder injury that held him out for nearly three months, but there's no one warming up yet in the Dodgers' bullpen. He's at 72 pitches through five, and the top of the Yankees' lineup is about to come up a third time through.

Bottom 5: Teoscar left stranded

Oct 26, 2024 - 9:37a ET
Fourth inning

Top 4: NY shut out

The Yankees couldn't narrow the gap at all as Yamamoto continues his strong night.

Bottom 4: Rodón is done

Thosar: It made little sense to me when the Yankees opted to start Carlos Rodon for Game 2, because the Dodgers hit lefties so well, and Rodon pitches better at home. More than anything, I thought Clarke Schmidt would've given them a better chance to go back to New York with a series split. But the Yankees' worst-case scenario was the Rodon that showed up in the second and third inning, the one that unraveled after he allowed his third home run of the night after just 13 batters faced. It's always hard to tell what the Yankees will get from Rodon, and when they needed a reliable starter more than anything else for Game 2, their top southpaw couldn't deliver. Fortunately for the Yankees, a three-run deficit isn't the worst thing in the world.

Third inning

Top 3: Soto ties it

Thosar: The bat flip said it all. Juan Soto looked into his dugout and pounded his chest after he hammered a solo shot to right field off Yamamoto, who erroneously thought he could get away with a 95 mph fastball that covered the middle of the plate. Soto doesn't miss mistakes on a bad day, and right now he's feeling so good at the plate that Yamamoto's decision to go with anything that resembled a heater, let alone throw it in the zone, was immediately punished. Soto's fourth home run of the playoffs tied the game at 1-1, and he's reached base in each of his 11 postseason games this October.

Bottom 3: Two for Teo, one for Freeman

Kavner: Back in June, Teoscar Hernández was the hero of the Dodgers' offense in the Bronx, launching three homers in the series win. He's back to tormenting the Yankees again, taking a heater at the top of the zone out for a go-ahead two-run homer. Not to be outdone, Freddie Freeman then made it back-to-back (not his first homer of the series, as you might have heard). The Dodgers are teeing off on Rodon his second time through.

Oct 26, 2024 - 8:49a ET
Second inning

Bottom 1: Yamamoto holding NY

Rowan Kavner: Yoshinobu Yamamoto hasn't had great command or control early, but he has gotten through two scoreless with two walks and a strikeout. When he carved through the Yankees lineup back in June, his go-to secondaries were the slider and splitter. It's mostly been the curveball the first time through. I'll be curious to see if he works the slider in more often after having success with it his last time out, but he'll need to command the fastball better regardless the second time through.

Bottom 2: Edman strikes again

Kavner: What a day July 29 was for the Dodgers. In a three-team deal that probably wasn't talked about enough at the time, they got Tommy Edman and Michael Kopech for Miguel Vargas and two lower-level prospects. Kopech immediately became a reliable high-leverage piece, while Edman, who hadn't played a game this year before the Dodgers made the trade, turned into a vital addition both for his defensive versatility (he can both center and shortstop, all the more important with Miguel Rojas banged up) and the switch-hitter's bat against left-handed pitching. He took Sean Manaea deep in Game 6 of the NLCS, and he took Carlos Rodon deep in his first at-bat Saturday to start the scoring. Juan Soto, however, eliminated that advantage quickly.

Oct 26, 2024 - 8:43a ET
First inning

Top 1: Judge strikes out

Deesha Thosar: Even though his manager and hitting coach were encouraged by his at-bats in Game 1, Aaron Judge continues to look off at the plate. After leadoff man Gleyber Torres worked a walk, the Yankees' Big 3 had a prime opportunity to cash in. Soto grounded out, but he at least moved Torres up to second. But then Judge followed by striking out on seven pitches, and he kept whiffing on sliders down and away from Yoshinobu Yamamoto. In the regular season, that's a plate appearance that would normally end in a walk for Judge.

Bottom 1: No runs

Mookie Betts got his first hit of the World Series, but Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman both failed to get on base.
