LOS ANGELES — The Dodgers are now in the National League Championship Series, but let’s look back at how they got here, with some highlights and numbers from the thrilling, five-game NLDS win over the Padres.

“We won the West, but that team, they’re stacked. They’re stacked,” Kiké Hernández while drinking celebratory beer from a Gatorade bottle after Friday’s Game 5 win. “Not just in the rotation, but lineup and bullpen and defensively, and the way they run the bases and they way they play the game. It’s a hard team to beat in October.”

But the Dodgers did just that, thanks in large part to Hernández, whose home run provided half of the runs in Game 5. He had three hits in his two starts during the series.

The primary driver of success for the Dodgers was its bullpen. The pitching split was stark for the Dodgers in the NLDS, with the rotation allowing 15 runs in 18⅓ innings, a 7.36 ERA that improved greatly with the highly-encouraging five scoreless innings by Yoshinobu Yamamoto to help win Game 5.

But the bullpen was dominant, with a 2.10 ERA and 27 strikeouts in 25⅔ innings. Four of the six relief runs allowed came in the final two innings of Game 2’s blowout loss. The seven high-leverage relievers — Evan Phillips, Blake Treinen, Ryan Brasier, Michael Kopech, Alex Vesia, Anthony Banda, and Daniel Hudson — only allowed two runs in 23⅓ frames.

Game 4’s bullpen game went so well, the Dodgers were at least considering doing so again in Game 5. They turned to Yamamoto to start instead after literally hours of discussion and planning over the last few days.

“None of that really matters without our pitchers going out and executing the way they did. They were incredible,” president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said. “I mean, to a man, they passed the baton to one another. Even just hearing from them before the game, they don’t care when it is, when it is, what inning, what role. We’re going to go put up a zero. And we saw it time and time again.”

The final time the Padres scored during the NLDS was the third inning of Game 3 in San Diego, with a six-run explosion that was the low point of the series to that point for the Dodgers. To that point, the Padres scored 21 runs in the first 20 innings of the series, and had scored in eight different innings.

San Diego did not score in the final 24 innings of the series.

Dodgers pitchers put up consecutive shutouts in the postseason for just the third time in franchise history, along with Games 2-3 of the 2016 NLCS and Games 1-2 of the 2018 NLDS.

In Game 5, with the series still very much in doubt, Fernando Tatis Jr. came to the plate with two on and one out in the third inning, a real trouble spot for Yamamoto. But he induced a double play, extinguishing the final threat as the Padres finished off the series hitless in their final 19 at-bats.

Teoscar Hernández accounted for the Dodgers’ other run in Game 5 with a seventh-inning home run. During the series he led the team in hits (six), home runs (two, tied with Mookie Betts), and RBI (seven), continuing his excellent play from the regular season.

“I know I’m not going to have success every time those big moments come,” Hernández said after the game. “But not running away from it, it’s what makes me get better in every situation.”

Shohei Ohtani had the huge three-run home run in the second inning of Game 1, setting the tone for a Dodgers offense that responded in every game. But he ended his first postseason series just 4-for-20 (.200/.273/.350), with 10 strikeouts.

The good news for Ohtani is that he won’t have to face Yu Darvish anymore this season. He was 0-for-6 with three strikeouts against Darvish in the NLDS, and on the season was 0-for-11 with five strikeouts.

Wins in Game 4 and Game 5 improved the Dodgers’ record in elimination games under Dave Roberts to 13-7 (.650). All other MLB teams since 2016 through the Division Series round this year are 60-82 (.423) in such games.

Roberts likened this series’ intensity to the Dodgers’ 2020 NLCS against the Braves and even the 2004 Red Sox against the Yankees when he was a player.

“To win this series how we did, to kind of fall behind — those guys coming into the postseason had a lot of momentum — speaks to the character of our guys,” Roberts said. “This is right up there.”
