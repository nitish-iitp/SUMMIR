Another masterful evening for the Dodgers’ bullpen takes them to the NLCS

Oftentimes the job of baseball analysis revolves around erring on the side of caution. In a world that prioritizes polarizing and definitive statements, things aren’t quite that simple in baseball. That being said, and it isn’t a hyperbolic statement for the sake of it, but the Dodgers do owe nearly everything in their National League Division Series win over the Padres to their bullpen.

On an evening when the margins were incredibly slim as neither side gave an inch away, the Dodgers’ bullpen took this one home and was every bit as dominant as it needed to be.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto cruised through five scoreless frames and no matter how well the bullpen has done, it would’ve been easy to leave him out there longer, yet that’s not what Dave Roberts did. Analyzing the decision at the time, it looked clearly like one of those situations when the manager opens himself up to be criticized in case things go wrong. It’s far easier to imagine a harsher criticism if things go wrong with the bullpen coming in early than with the dealing starter eventually faltering.

Roberts, after the game, said, “I felt at that time he gave us everything he had and we could give it off to a very, very capable pen.”

While that was a common line of thought, it is not the one any decent manager must have. What matters is not your own personal exposure, but rather what do you foresee giving your team the best shot at winning this game? Everything that the bullpen had done, including the shutout win on the road in the previous game, made it abundantly clear it was in a great spot to keep things where they were and potentially hand the Dodgers a trip to the NLCS.

Evan Phillips, Alex Vesia, Michael Kopech, and Blake Treinen came on in that order, one directly influenced by which batters were up when they entered the game. All four of them were phenomenal, retiring the final 12 hitters they faced. In fact, going back to the latter portion of Yamamoto’s outing, the final 19 Padres went down in order to end this one, failing to muster up a single extra-base hit across the entire game.

Phillips may not have had his best season, losing the closer job, but the righty showed the stuff that made him a staple of this bullpen for the last few years. Roberts made the switch to start the sixth even though Yamamoto’s pitch count was well in hand because he didn’t want his starter facing that powerful lineup for a third time. This move meant Phillips would be dealing with the top of the order in what was still at that point a one-run game. The sweeper worked wonders as Phillips earned three strikeouts and held the red-hot Fernando Tatis Jr. also In check with a liner off the end of his bat.

Phillips was clicking, but with pretty drastic splits, Roberts took no risk and had Vesia come in the game with two outs in the seventh to face Jackson Merrill and strike him out. Obviously, this was not as attention-grabbing as the Yamamoto move, but once again, Roberts trusted the full strength of the arms at his disposal, unwilling to ride the hot hand through gut-feeling or any other rationalization.

Vesia was set to go back out there for the eighth, but he felt a cramp in his right side in the warmups, and exited the game. It would not matter as Michael Kopech absolutely bullied the bottom of that order with his 100+ mph heaters.

How fitting that one of the more experienced arms in this bullpen, Treinen would get to wrap things off and do so swiftly to avoid any further drama, after all this was a 2-0 lead that LA held. The thing about two-run leads is that you’re always one base runner away from facing the tying run, not a comfortable task against a lineup with many a home run hitters.

Dating back to the Friars Game 3 win, in which they scored all six runs in the second, the Dodgers held San Diego to 24 straight scoreless frames. At the end of things, the Dodgers had the longest scoreless streak to close out a playoff series in the 21st century, and third-longest in the history of the sport, per Sarah Langs of MLB.com.

This was one of the more dominant bullpen campaigns in a Divisional Series ever. Apart from the Game 2 debacle in which Ryan Brasier and some lower-leverage arms got roughed up late, the Dodgers’ bullpen held the Padres to 22 scoreless innings in the other four games, even including the highly-contested 6-5 loss in Game 3.

That proved to be a recipe for success.
