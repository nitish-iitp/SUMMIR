        "Nestor Cortes said, 'As bad as people think we are playing \u2026 we are still in first place. It\u2019s there for us to take. We just have to come out every day prepared and be ready to win every single day.'",
        "Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, 'The difference is, we couldn\u2019t close out that inning. We were still tied with two outs when they got all of those five runs. It\u2019s one of those games. Tommy has been so good. Cousins has been so good. So no issues going right back to those guys, and knowing how important they have been to our bullpen and our success on the back end.'",
        "Tommy Kahnle said, 'I got behind a couple of counts. I made some bad pitches. They adjusted and took advantage. \u2026 The changeup was over the plate a couple of times. A couple of heaters were hit pretty hard. \u2026 Obviously, I want to go out and do well, and it didn\u2019t go well for me. Hopefully, I can rebound from this.'",
        "Aaron Boone said, 'We know how important these games are. Another opportunity to win a series that we weren\u2019t able to finish and that sucks, but it\u2019s onward. \u2026 We have to play our best, and we have to put our best foot forward to win these games. And we hope we start that tomorrow night.'"
