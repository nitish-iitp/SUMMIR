        "Aaron Boone said, 'Tough day for us. We know how important these games are, certainly. We had another opportunity to win a series that we weren\u2019t able to finish and that sucks. We\u2019ve got to play our best.'",
        "Juan Soto said, 'This is the right time to get hot. We\u2019re definitely trying.'",
        "Nestor Cortes said, 'As bad as people think we\u2019re playing and as bad as it might show we\u2019re playing, we\u2019re still in first place. It goes to show it\u2019s there for us to take.'"
