MLB
Yankees’ Juan Soto commits several defensive miscues in forgettable day in outfield

Juan Soto isn’t going to be one of the most coveted free agents of all time this offseason because of his defensive prowess, but he had an especially rough game in right field in Sunday’s 14-7 loss to the Cardinals, as he misplayed several balls.

Although some of it may have been due to a wet field, it’s unusual for balls to go over the heads of right fielders at Yankee Stadium due to the short porch in right — yet it happened to Soto three times Sunday.

The first miscue came in the second, when Brendan Donovan led off with a fly ball that had an expected batting average of .090 and ended up getting by Soto for a double that led to a run.

“I saw the ball all the way, but when he hit it, I thought it was gonna be a high pop up in the infield,’’ Soto said. “But the ball just took off and the wind helped a little bit to push farther to the wall.”

And Lars Nootbaar’s decisive three-run double also eluded Soto on a play he could have made.

Soto said the backspin on the line drive affected the play, but Aaron Boone said he didn’t believe Soto should have caught it.

Overall, Soto’s defensive metrics in right aren’t bad.

His ability to dominate at the plate makes whatever shortcomings he has in the field almost meaningless, but occasionally they can impact a game, as they did on Sunday.

The Yankees pitching staff should get some key additions this week, as Luis Gil made what is expected to be his final minor league rehab start with Double-A Somerset on Sunday after recovering from a back strain.

He gave up three runs in 3 ²/₃ innings in his 80-pitch outing.

And Clarke Schmidt (lat) is set to throw what should also be his last rehab outing with Somerset on Monday.

Boone said both right-handers will likely be with the team for this week’s series against the Cubs in Chicago.

Boone said the team hasn’t decided what it will do with the rotation once the two are ready, which wouldn’t be before the end of the week.

Boone said Saturday that he didn’t anticipate going to a six-man rotation down the stretch.

Right-handers Scott Effross and Ron Marinaccio were recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Sunday.

Effross hadn’t pitched for the Yankees since undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2022 and was roughed up for two runs on three hits in just ²/₃ of an inning.

All four batters Effross faced hit balls clocked at over 100 mph — including a homer by Jordan Walker.

Marinaccio pitched one inning and also allowed two runs and a homer.

What do you think? Post a comment.

With Ian Hamilton (lat) expected to resume his rehab assignment after being scratched due to back spasms and Nick Burdi and Lou Trivino also pitching in the minors, the Yankees could shake up their bullpen again over the final weeks of the regular season.

Aaron Judge went hitless and struck out three times. In six games since hitting his 50th and 51st home runs, Judge is 4-for-21 with a double, six walks and 10 strikeouts.
