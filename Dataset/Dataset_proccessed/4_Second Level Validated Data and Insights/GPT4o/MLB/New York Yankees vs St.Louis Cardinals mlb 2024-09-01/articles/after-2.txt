NEW YORK (AP) — Brendan Donovan hit a three-run homer, Kyle Gibson pitched seven strong innings and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the New York Yankees 6-5 on Saturday for their first regular-season win at Yankee Stadium.

It was the first victory for St. Louis in the Bronx since Tim McCarver hit a three-run homer in the 10th inning in Game 5 of the 1964 World Series and Bob Gibson pitched a complete game in a 5-2 win. The Cardinals improved to 1-7 at Yankee Stadium in the regular season.

St. Louis went ahead to stay with four runs in the third against rookie Will Warren (0-3). Nolan Arenado hit a tying RBI single before Donovan connected for his 11th homer. It was his first three-run drive since July 23, 2023.

“Any day you hit a home run, I consider that a good day and to have a couple of people on base and to give us a little bit of breathing room, I think is good,” Donovan said after matching a career high in homers. “Someone said that’s the first time we’ve won here in 60 years, which is pretty special for this organization. First time here, it’s a pretty cool place.”

Iván Herrera hit an RBI double in the sixth and scored on a throwing error by Yankees catcher Austin Wells following a wild pitch by Mark Leiter Jr. Herrera reached three times and hit a single in the third when Paul Goldschmidt was thrown out at the plate.

Gibson (8-6) allowed one run and five hits. After struggling through his worst outing this season Monday against San Diego, he got his first win since July 7 at Washington.

“Today was just about trying to clear my mind a little bit, not look at ERA, not look at last couple of outings and try to be focused on what I’m trying to do today,” Gibson said.

After Gibson departed, the Cardinals had some trouble with their bullpen.

Matthew Liberatore allowed five hits, including Anthony Volpe’s RBI infield single. Andrew Kittredge gave up pinch-hitter Giancarlo Stanton’s three-run double off the top of the center-field fence to make it a one-run game.

“I thought he caught it maybe just enough off the end,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “Obviously a big swing there to get us back in it and give us a chance in the ninth.

Ryan Helsley worked a shaky ninth for his 42nd save in 45 chances.

Oswaldo Cabrera struck out on a pitch-clock violation and Gleyber Torres flied out before Juan Soto doubled with two down. Following an intentional walk to Aaron Judge, Helsley fanned Wells on a slider for the final out.

Helsley became the first Cardinal to record a save in the Bronx since Ron Taylor pitched the final four innings of Game 4 of the 1964 World Series.

“That’s what the fans came to see right there,” Donovan said of the ninth. “You got two of the best hitters in baseball on base and you got the best closer in baseball on the mound. You’re in Yankee Stadium, it’s the bottom of the ninth, you got a bunch of people screaming. It’s loud. I was like this is what people came to see, this is special.”

In his fifth career start, Warren allowed four runs and five hits in four innings. Warren and catcher/infielder Ben Rice were optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre after the game.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Cardinals: LHP Steven Matz (back), whose 30-day rehab period ended, is expected to be added when rosters expand to 28 Sunday and may start Monday in Milwaukee. ... OF Michael Siani (oblique) drew three walks in four plate appearances in a rehab game with Double-A Springfield on Friday. He was slated to play there later Saturday and could be activated when rosters increase.

Yankees: 1B Anthony Rizzo (fractured right forearm) likely will be activated off the injured list Sunday after missing over two months. ... RHP Clarke Schmidt (strained right lat) threw a side session and the team will decide by Sunday if he needs another rehab appearance Monday or can be activated. … RHP Ian Hamilton (strained right lat) was scratched from Friday’s rehab appearance for Somerset because of back spasms.

UP NEXT

Cardinals RHP Miles Mikolas (8-10, 5.23 ERA) opposes New York LHP Nestor Cortes (8-10, 3.89) on Sunday afternoon.
