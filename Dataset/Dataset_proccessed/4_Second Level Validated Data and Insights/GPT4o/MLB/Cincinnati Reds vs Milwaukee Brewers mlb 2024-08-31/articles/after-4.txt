Fernando Cruz


The splits for Fernando Cruz are huge in 2024. Right-handed hitters aren’t doing much of anything besides drawing walks at a solid clip against him. Left-handed hitters, though, are hitting like they are an MVP candidate when they face him.

Frankie Montas


The former Red will face off against his former teammates in this one. Montas has made five starts with the Brewers since he was acquired in a trade deadline deal and has a 3.33 ERA with 28 strikeouts in 27.0 innings for Milwaukee.

The splits on the season are large for Montas. Right-handed hitters aren’t finding much success against him. Lefties, though, are hitting quite well across the board against him. They hit for average, draw plenty of walks, make a lot of contact, and hit for good power.

At least 3 guys maybe 4 that won’t be with this team next year. Oh well, that’s David Bell.

CLT Reds Fan 08/31/2024

Hopefully the Opening Day Lineup 2025: McLain 2B, Friedl CF, EDLC SS, Stephenson C, Candy DH, Steer LF, CES 1B, Fraley RF, and Marte 3B. Hunter Greene SP. Does that healthy lineup look playoff competitive to you?

Oldtimer 08/31/2024

If all are healthy, yes. I will be surprised if Candy is a Red next year.

Oldtimer 08/31/2024

Strange lineup.

LDS 08/31/2024

No Stephenson. No India. No Hinds. No 2B. Not the Reds strongest lineup. I guess the season is officially over.

CLT Reds Fan 08/31/2024

Totally agree that Hinds needs to be playing more instead of riding the pines!! Young guys need to be playing almost every day. If the Reds organization doesn’t have confidence in him than call up Dunn or Hurtebise and give them another opportunity.

Mark A Verticchio 08/31/2024

Why in the world would you bat last year’s successful lead off hitter 3rd and your RBI leader 1st. I honestly think Bell is daring everybody, He is saying I will do what I want I know they will never fire me. regardless this line up is a joke.

LarkinPhillips 08/31/2024

I’ve seen some bad lineups but this one is insane. Three castaways as 4-5-6. 7-8-9 has no hope unless benson runs into one accidentally and the 8th inning guy lost this year as the starter with a random pick up as the main pitcher expected for the game. Hope maile is ready to pitch today.

DataDumpster 08/31/2024

He must be using some AI program or something (you know; garbage in, garbage out.) This card defies any rational baseball explanation. Steer is the best clutch hitter but the 7,8,9 don’t figure to get on base very often. Alternatively, maybe he looks at this blog at times, taking the temperature of the fanbase. That “may” matter to Castellini.

Wayne Nabors 08/31/2024

Drove from illinois for today’s and tomorrow’s game and as soon as I got here I seen lineup and wonder why i even make this drive

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Hope they at lest give you a few things to cheer and clap for besides the National Anthem.

Wayne Nabors 08/31/2024

It was amazing

Melvin 08/31/2024

Feel sorry for you. Must be a REAL Reds fan.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Wondering how it will look when they field two 1st Basemen? 

Oldtimer 08/31/2024

I imagine that’s a typo. Rosario 2B probably.

Bet on red 08/31/2024

With skill

LarkinPhillips 08/31/2024

Why is Hinds up if he is never going to play? Either leave him in AAA to work on things or play him but this is ridiculous.
Absolutely pathetic way to treat a prospect. Be different if he was a 32 year old journeyman… just crazy stuff that the reds are doing nowadays.

Greenfield Red 08/31/2024

agree

JB 08/31/2024

Seriously need to lose their next 26 to maybe have tinker lose his job. Lineups are a joke everyday.

Mark Moore 08/31/2024

First inning was uninspiring.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Which is better than it might be …

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Nothin’ to nothin’ after one. both teams with a base hit.
Feels strange to be facing Montas.
Wonder if it’s to our advantage or not. (?)

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Cruz with two strike outs in the first… Dealing to Adames to start the 2nd, who reaches on an error by the short stop.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Nice pitch on the corner to get the first out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Hoskins not getting fooled by the splitter and takes a walk. Two on with 1 out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

3 splitters sits down Mitchell, 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And Cruz gets him with a splitter for strike three ! That’s 5 strikeouts thru the first 9 just like his last outing. I hope he gets another inning as a reward !

Mark Moore 08/31/2024

Diaz works out of the jam in the 2nd. Nicely done after that bonehead play by our SS.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Diaz ?

Mark Moore 08/31/2024

Cruz 

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

I’d take Montas over Diaz these days.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

The bottom of the Reds order doesn’t look too potent tonight…

Melvin 08/31/2024

haha One would possibly think that, after getting our butts kicked last night and getting royally embarrassed we might think about putting our best lineup out there and fight back as a matter of pried?

Daniel 08/31/2024

pride

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Montas walks Benson with two outs in the bottom of the 2nd … up comes Steer.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Oops, Marte is up.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And Benson is caught stealing to end the 2nd.

Stoney 08/31/2024

Wouldn’t be a Reds game without a base runner being thrown out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buck Farmer takes the mound for the top of the 3rd.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Looks like a 2 inning limit for F. Cruz.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

thought Buck was going to lose him, but a nice pitch on the corner for strike three, one down.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Chourio dbls on a first pitch sinker down the middle…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Contreras walks and Chourio steals 3rd… one out.

SteveAReno 08/31/2024

Cruz can and should pitch more than two innings!

Mark Moore 08/31/2024

Well, I suppose it’s over before we start today. Football on the TV and my patience for this nonsense is way too low. We’re already too patchwork and making that worse with this particular line up.

Catch you all tomorrow … maybe.

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

I’m with you Mark! My Irish are battling Texas A&M tonight! Much more interesting than Bell’s dumpster fire!

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Farmer pays for it with a three run homer by Adames !

Stan 08/31/2024

Buck Farmer finally shows his true pitching ability.

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

Perfect! The Farmer walk allows Reds Killer Adames to bat and boom! 3 run HR is probably all the Brewers need against this Reds team!

Oldtimer 08/31/2024

It is 3-2 now but Brewers are threatening. Get your Wah Wah Wah voice ready.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buck strikes out the side, but gives up a dbl, walk, and a home run in between… it’s 3-0 for the Division leaders.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Marte starts things off with single in the bottom of the 3rd… now Steer is up !

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Who after a Maile single grounds into a Double Play ! Ouch !

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Reds come up empty in the 3rd.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Marte is not a smart player.
House said nothing to him afterwards.

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

I predicted yesterday that Montas would pitch a shutout against his former team! Looking highly likely after 3 innings!

Oldtimer 08/31/2024

It’s 3-2 now. Is that still considered a shutout?

Roger Garrett 08/31/2024

Only this team can have runners on the corners and no outs and 3 pitches later the inning is over and don’t score.Can we just forfeit,down the Kool Aid and cookies and go home.

Old-school 08/31/2024

Reds have runners 1-3
Steer hits into a double play and marte at 3rd walks back to 3b.

Literally worst play I’ve ever seen.
Brewers concede the run on the double play and marte walks back to 3b
‘

marte is lost and coaches are lost.

There is no one anywhere that can say this coaching staff and team isnt a broken mess.

Is there anyone out there that has seen what just happened?

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

If the infield had been in…he would have taken off.
I was very high on Marte after last year.

Now I want no part of him on the team.

RedAlert 08/31/2024

It’s pathetic ! Has happened all year long and nothing has changed … I’ve never seen a worse baserunning team in MLB . It’s
inexcusable … I mean what is spring training for ????!!!! do these guys work on any
fundamentals of the game at all ???

Bell and his coaching staff have to go , have to go !!!!!!
Zero accountability , zero consequences ….
SELL THE TEAM – embarrassing on all fronts !!!!

Randoxu1 08/31/2024

There is no words for this mess anymore. I would love to blame Bell on marte’s stupid base running gaffe but that’s on him and his terrible instincts. Bell gets the blame for never holding anyone accountable for all the mistakes. It happens every day. The guy needs to go, I have no idea who but there needs to be change.

Stan 08/31/2024

When they run they shouldn’t and when they don’t run they should.Can’t we just forfeit the rest of the season?

Justin T 08/31/2024

The error by Elly is another example of why he should play another position. Its concentration issues and he will battle it his entire career at short. His speed and athleticism will help make up for those mistakes in the outfield. Like the announcer said, he did everything right, he just missed it.

I am numb to the lineups by now. As a gen x guy I remember Myspace and the ol “top 8” feature where your favorite 8 friends were shown on your page. You could also tell it to randomize it daily if you were getting grief from your non top 8 friends. I see Bell’s lineups like that most of the time.

Frankie Tomatoes 08/31/2024

You should move guys for their physical inability to play a position not because they make mental mistakes at a position where they are still very good at. That is double true when they are 22 years old. If those mental mistakes are still happening in five years then you maybe have that conversation.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buchanan gets to take the mound today in the 4th.. and Mitchell works a walk.

Old-school 08/31/2024

Noelvi Marte is a dysfunctional pathetic cancer on this team. Never seen a player this bad fundamentally or functionally. He cheated and stinks and cant run the bases. How can he can still play? Bell and Krall wont demand accountability.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

I have to think it’s in the name, Marte greatness. But it’s not showing.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Hoskins, Ortiz and Turang all fly out to end the Brewer 4th.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Isn’t it the 3rd base coach’s job to tell the runner what to do in the situation?

Reds’ third base coach has been a lamp post all season.

Good for shaking hands with home run hitters and that’s about all.

Who is that guy?

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

“House” he’s been famous for getting guys thrown out at home.

Frankie Tomatoes 08/31/2024

One of the greatest high school quarterbacks ever.

This team is going to be the end of me.

I just want to see them win again before I die.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Montas gets Friedl on a ground out and up comes France… I like the Friedl – France batting order.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

But France gets called out on a marginal pitch up and out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Dom Smith doubles with two outs !

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

But Rosario lines out to right…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

The bottom 5 in the Reds lineup have put up 3 hits today after 4. Better than I expected, but no Runs against Montas yet.

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

Montas with 4 scoreless innings on 53 pitches! When did he ever do that as a Reds starter?

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

I was wondering who’d have the advantage in this situation. Appears that Frankie knows the Reds better than they can hit him.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buchanan back out for the 5th… 2 down.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buchanan sets the Bernies down in order in the 5th.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Benson works his second walk of the night to lead off the Reds 5th… and Noelvi M. singles for his second time of the night, and that brings Maile to the plate.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And Maile sac bunts, advancing both runners !

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

After Benson walks.
Marte swings out a 2-0 pitch outside the zone.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

He’s had 5 walks in 170 ABs.

Jose Peraza Dos.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

He does that alot, but this time it’s a hit !

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

170 ABs in, it’s time for Marte to put The Mendoza in his rear view mirror.

LarkinPhillips 08/31/2024

Benson hasn’t after 300 ABs and is still up. Why would marte be worried.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Poco a poco.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And Steer drives in two, and moves up to second on the throw !

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Kudos for Benson for telling Marte where to slide there.
Elly was there also, directing him.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Bunt leads to 2 runs.

Bell on acid or Maile going rogue?

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Text book, wasn’t it…

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Bell didn’t go to that school.

Still time to pass Baseball Fundamentals equivalency exam.

But he’s going to need to do some homework.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Money ball made bunting a lost art, but when your worst hitter can lay one down … it’s probably more luck than anything, but well appreciated.

RedlegScott 08/31/2024

What do you know about acid, Mr. Stoner?

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Not enough, bud.

Tried things out a few times in my youth.

Never really had the transcendent experience.

I’ve heard it can be illuminating, but I moved on.

Here’s my excuse: I live in Oregon. Lol

No excuse.

Elly grounds out to second, Steer moves up to 3rd, 2 down.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

That’s all for the Reds at the end of 5, trailing the cheese heads by 1, 3-2.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buchanan back out for the 6th ? Yep, and he gives up a leadoff single.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Followed by a Perkins ground rule double… mound visit.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Mitchell grounds out to De La Cruz, but one run scores… now 4-2 with 2 outs in the 6th.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buchanan gets the 3rd out, but he’s struggling.

Reds need to get one back, at least.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Montas walks France to lead off the bottom of the 6th… Let’s make it his last inning.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Rosario not making an impressive start to the Big Leagues… But then homers with one on to tie the game at 4. !!

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Rosario is batting .300 this year.

RedsFanInFL 08/31/2024

No way that should hit an HR because it doesn’t align with the R-L split the Bell likes

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And that’s all the Reds will get, but the score is tied after 6, 4-4.

SteveAReno 08/31/2024

Rosario is the bomb. He hit it 420 ft and could be a record for him.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Who will the Reds put out there for the 7th ? We can win this game, if we can shut down their offense.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Perkins makes a brilliant catch, but the thing I took from that was that Marte never ran, or jogged…but stood there and admired what he thought was a HR.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Wow, He’s been hitting the ball today. Usually they know if it’s going out or not.

RedsFanInFL 08/31/2024

Saw that too. If that ball is not caught and doesn’t go out of the ball park, it’s a long single. But no worries. Marte plays for a “players manager”

DaveCT 08/31/2024

The game and sports in general has changed dramatically. Celebrations are well accepted and commonplace. This was nothing more.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

I love celebrations.
All for them.
Have fun with it.
But celebrate AFTER something is accomplished.

DaveCT 08/31/2024

Point well taken.

Melvin 08/31/2024

Marte is not impressing me at all anymore. Not saying we should give up on him since he has a lot of raw talent. One could argue though that he has been pretty much a pain in the butt this entire year. Judging by the look on his face and the way he acts he doesn’t appear to care as much as he should to me. He’s one guy I would trade if he still has high value before it’s too late.

Daytonnati 08/31/2024

Cam Collier is a third baseman, isn’t he? Perhaps Marte is expendable?

Melvin 08/31/2024

If he has high value to some team I’d trade him.

SteveAReno 08/31/2024

That’s poor baserunning.

SteveAReno 08/31/2024

Again.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Buchanan is back out there for the 7th ! Bell must not be seeing what I saw.

The 2nd batter walks, with one out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And here comes Tony Santillan !

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

the ump gives Contreras the call, two on with one out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And Santillan gets Adames for the third out !

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Maile the mad bunter, Steer and De La Cruz to face Aaron Ashby in the bottom of the 7th.

And Maile works a walk to lead things off…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Steer follows with a single on an 0-2 count, Maile to second with no one out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

But De La Cruz is fooled by the Lefties curveball for strike three…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Friedl moves the runner to 3rd, but now two outs, with France up.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Oh, he goes down on strikes ending the Reds threat in the 7th.

RedAlert 08/31/2024

So Bell bunts a couple inning ago in a 3-0 game ; game on line bottom of 7 and first 2 men on ?????? TOTALLY CLUELESS !!!!!

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

Same old 4-run Frankie! Only difference tonight is that he was able to survive for 7 innings not the usual 4 or 5 innings when he pitched for the Reds!

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Montas went 6 innings 4 times and 7 innings 2 twice with the Reds.

Oldtimer 08/31/2024

There you go being factual.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Well, Montas made 19 starts for the Reds.

Your listing suggests he went 5 innings or less 13 times.

13 out of 19. 68% of the time.

Y’all can debate how you feel about that, but those are the numbers.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

People were griping the other day because Friedl hit a clean triple and they thought he was laboring. He didn’t need full speed.

He just busted it down the line to beat out a double play.

People often jump to conclusions.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

We get to see Perkins with a lead off bunt that puts him on second…

Stan 08/31/2024

Almost time for Diaz so we can end this game with another loss.

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

Bell is completely oblivious to the concept of “small ball”! Perfect example was the bottom of the 7th inning! First 2 batters reach base in a tie game but not attempt to bunt BOTH runners into scoring position! Result? Next 2 batters fail to get a hit and the final batter strikes out!

Classic “Bell ball”! Another reason Bell should be given his walking papers!

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Santillan proceeds to strike out Mitchell and Hoskins… 2 down in the 8th.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Make that a trifecta … onto the Reds bottom of the 8th.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

This has been one of the better home plate umps this year IMO.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Clint Vondrak is his name.

I’d be curious to see his post game report card.

RedAlert 08/31/2024

Santillan for closer – stuff as good as or
better than Diaz and the dude throws strikes majority of the time . Throws gas …..

DaveCT 08/31/2024

He has that Nasty Boys look, too. Big, intimidating, filthy stuff.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

and right now he’s got that intangible thing going. The batters are not in sync with him on the mound.

Chad Donnell 08/31/2024

I have noticed for the last two weeks that Santillan is a much better pitcher than Diaz. So why is he not our closer? I may be ready to kick Bell upstairs. Let him work in player development

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Because he’s so good at that?

Red Thunder 08/31/2024

No way in player development! Upstairs to keep Bob or Phil company, sounds goods.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Espinal pinch hits for Dom Smith and lines out to left…one down.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

I get the feeling that Aaron Ashby has been around the block. He shuts down the Reds in the 8th, pinch hitters and all…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Oh no, it’s Justin wilson to start the 9th…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

But he gets a bunt out on the first pitch to a pinch hitter.

RedAlert 08/31/2024

Don’t want to see Wilson in a Reds uniform next year …. No sir

magi210 08/31/2024

I don’t want to see him in one this year…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And there it goes into the stands, Chourio homers making it 5-4 milwaukee.

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Wilson in for a tie game…
Wonder what could happen?

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Same thing that’s happened plenty of other times.
Absolutely nobody saw that coming.

Mark A Verticchio 08/31/2024

I don’t think Bell did, but he sure should have. Don’t tell me the manager doesn’t matter in all these one run losses. 8 losses in 10 games.

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

I feel another one-run loss coming!

Again, the poor relief pitching aside, this Reds team, under the expert tutelage of one D. Bell, fails, time after time, to take advantage of potential scoring opportunities early in this and many games where they lose by one run! Just gets old!

VaRedsFan 08/31/2024

Sam Moll was warming earlier.
Why on earth would would you waste warming up Moll, and instead go to Justin “I Hate Tie Games” Wilson?

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Reds escape with only one run in the top of the 9th… But do we have one in us to tie ?

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

And they bring in Devin Williams to close it out…

Stan 08/31/2024

It’s the mound that causes all of pitchers to be bad.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Marte goes up out of the zone for the first out…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Pinch hitting Ty Steve works a walk. One on and one out.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Spencer Steer called out on ball 4… so much for good umpiring.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Oooh.

That was a bad call on Steer.

But he’s got to foul those off, not leave it to an ump.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

He gives nothing for Elly to hit, and walks him, 2 on with two out in the ninth, Friedl at the plate.

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Friedl hit by pitch to load ’em up for Ty France…

Andrew Brewer 08/31/2024

Williams gets a ground out to end it… He gets ahead in the count and then pitches around the zone. Tough loss in the 9th.

RedAlert 08/31/2024

Another one run loss … gonna continue to bang the drum here …FIRE DAVID BELL !!!!!

Sick of this !!!!! Never seen an owner
blatantly accept losing like this …. No excuse for it whatsoever ….

Dennis Westrick 08/31/2024

Another exciting one run loss! Aren’t you excited? And, another loss to Milwaukee! How many is that? 13? Versus 3 wins? Pathetic!

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

Brewers are a first place team and Reds are fighting hard to be in last.

The results are not surprising.

Given the circumstances the Reds played the Brewers fairly well.

Why Wilson was in against the RHers in the heart of the order and not Santillan, of course, is yet another chapter in the never ending Bell sack of woe.

Stan 08/31/2024

Another one run loss .Well the Brewer’s should bring their brooms tomorrow Bell tell Large the next time he’s on third with no outs and the defense is back run home.Never mind the only thing our manager does is fill out lineup cards and make wrongheaded decisions every chance he gets.

magi210 08/31/2024

Great play by the Brewer’s 1st baseman to end it.

Jeremiah 08/31/2024

I give the Reds some credit for their fight in the ith, really made Williams work for that save. In a terrible year overall, nice professionalism from Stephenson, Steer, France, Friedl, and De La Cruz nice at bat there too in the 9th overall.

Harry Stoner 08/31/2024

There have been much worse losses.

Jeremiah 08/31/2024

9th

Anthony 09/01/2024

Love the comments on TODAYS?? batting order picked out of a hat??. Now Friedl moves up to 3rd and Steer is tried leadoff again??. Benson is moved up too and France-Smith are your 4-5 RBI men?? THE 130th different combo. Then some fans still wonder why the offense has never been consistent??. Some other fellow Micro Reds fans and I were having a debate yesterday during OSU vs AKRON. I believe its truly this “Manager” who somehow dreams up this chaos every morning…others believe its simply plugging in AI and having Alexa develop its maximized optimal order for that day…while others believe its IMPOSSIBLE that the front office condones this so it must be texted or emailed to Bell every morning from upstairs ordering it be run this way? Any other views:?? I went to 9U and 11U fall ball games Saturday and those volunteer coaches switched up positions in batting orders every day in between cookies and juice boxes….sure everyone got to play every position including left-handed infielders….but we are watching MLB here supposedly??……….HELP??

Anthony 09/01/2024

With the way this is being run……Im still waiting for Fraley at 2B, Friedl at SS and Benson at 3B?? Im wondering for a year end promotion if they can locate the great grandson of Eddie Gaedel and have him leadoff one game (That idea would be really old school and hopefully the trivia oldtimers on this site get the joke). My philosophy is if our Reds are run like a JOKE why not go all out and entertain fully??
