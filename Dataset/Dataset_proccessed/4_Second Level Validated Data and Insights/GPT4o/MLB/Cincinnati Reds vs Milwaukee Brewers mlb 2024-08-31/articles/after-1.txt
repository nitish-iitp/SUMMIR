The Cincinnati Reds (64-73) fell 5-4 to the Milwaukee Brewers (80-56) on Saturday night. It was their third straight loss.

Here are our postgame takeaways:

Battled Back From Three Down

The Brewers got off to a 3-0 lead early when Willy Adames hit a three-run home run, his third home run of the series.

The Reds would battle back and score two runs to cut their deficit to 3-2 on a Spencer Steer two RBI single in the fifth.

After the Brewers added a run to extend their lead to 4-2 in the sixth, Amed Rosario hit a two-run home run to tie the game at four, his first home run since April 17th.

Noelvi Marte followed with what looked to be a home run to center field, but Brewers' center fielder Blake Perkins brought it back from over the fence.

A Wild Ninth Inning

With the game still tied at four in the ninth, Justin Wilson gave up an opposite-field go-ahead home run to Jackson Chourio.

The Reds loaded the bases in the ninth, but Brewers' first baseman Jake Bauers made a game-saving diving play against Ty France to end the game.

Up Next

The Reds will look to avoid the four-game sweep tomorrow at 12:10 ET.
