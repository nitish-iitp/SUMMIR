The New York Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 3-1 on Thursday to advance in the MLB playoffs as the Cleveland Guardians kept their season alive with a 5-4 win over the Detroit Tigers.

Juan Soto, Gleyber Torres and Giancarlo Stanton drove in runs for the Yankees, and pitching ace Gerrit Cole surrendered just one run over seven sparkling innings as New York clinched its best-of-five American League Division Series 3-1 to reach the American League Championship Series.

The Yankees will next face either the Tigers or the Guardians.

The Guardians evened that series at 2-2 thanks to a two-run home run in the seventh inning from David Fry — whose sacrifice bunt added an insurance run in the top of the ninth that would prove to be the difference maker.

In Kansas City, Soto put New York in front in the first inning with a single that scored Torres, who opened the game with a double.

Torres' single in the fifth put the Yankees up 2-0, and Game 3 home run hero Stanton knocked in a run with a single in the sixth.

That was all the scoring Cole and the Yankees bullpen needed.

"What a performance by GC to come out here and do his thing," Yankees slugger Aaron Judge said about Cole, who allowed six hits with no walks and four strikeouts on 87 pitches.

"That's why he's our ace. He goes out there and does performances like this when we need him to."

Kansas City's only run came with two outs in the bottom of the sixth — shortly after the benches briefly cleared in the wake of Yankees second baseman Anthony Volpe's hard tag on Maikel Garcia.

The Guardians were shut out by the upstart Tigers in Games 2 and 3 and trailed by a run in Game 4 when Fry was called in to pinch hit with one runner on and two outs in the top of the seventh.

He deposited a fastball from Tigers reliever Beau Brieske over the left-center field fence to put the Guardians ahead for good.

"I was just trying to get a pitch to hit," Fry said. "I had some opportunities yesterday to drive some runners in and didn't get the job done. So I was looking to get it done for the boys and luckily it went out."

Cleveland added a run in the top of the ninth, with Fry laying down a bunt that allowed Brayan Rocchio to score from third base. Rocchio had singled with one out in the inning and reached third on Steven Kwan's base hit.

That insurance run proved necessary when the Tigers clawed one back in the bottom of the ninth.

Cleveland ended a streak of 11 defeats in playoff elimination games, a skid dating back to Game 6 of the 1997 World Series.
