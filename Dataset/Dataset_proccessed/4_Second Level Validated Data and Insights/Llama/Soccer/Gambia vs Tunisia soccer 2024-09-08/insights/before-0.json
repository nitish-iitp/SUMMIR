        "Gambia are hoping to reach the Africa Cup of Nations main draw for a third consecutive time, following a quarter-final appearance in 2021-22 and a group-stage exit in the last edition in the Ivory Coast earlier this year.",
        "Tunisia, on the other hand, have been well below expectations in their performances over the last year.",
        "Gambia have been steadily improving over the same period, and if they can find a way to tighten up defensively, we could see them moving up the rankings in the coming months.",
        "The Carthage Eagles are considered the favourites here, but we feel the Scorpions will be able to earn a share of the spoils in this one."

        "Tunisia are likely to prioritise shutting out their upcoming opponents in this one as well.",
        "Gambia are likely to switch to a 4-4-2 formation, with Ebrima Colley being hooked at halftime against the Comoros for Hamza Barry.",

        "Sassi's match-winner against Madagascar may have earned him a spot in the starting 11 this week, potentially in place of Ali Youssef, who was withdrawn before the hour mark in the same match.",
        "Bilel Mejri made an impressive cameo in the final minutes of the last match and will be hoping to start this one, while Mortadha Ben Ouanes is a minor doubt owing to a knock."
