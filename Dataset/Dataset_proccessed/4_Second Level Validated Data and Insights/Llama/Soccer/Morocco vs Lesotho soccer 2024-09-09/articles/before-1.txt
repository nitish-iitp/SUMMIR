Preview: Lesotho vs. Morocco - prediction, team news, lineups

Lesotho will hope to achieve a giant-killing mission when they take on Morocco at Stade Adrar on Monday in an 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match.

The home side have never made it to the competition in their history, while the visitors have already qualified for next year's tournaments as the host.

Lesotho, the lowest-ranked team to qualify directly for the AFCON qualifiers group stage (ranked 44th out of 53 at the time of the draw), knew they faced a daunting task to reach the competition proper next year.

As the lowest-ranked side in group B, their 3-1 defeat to Central African Republic in the first round of qualifiers, conceding in the opening minute, served as a stark reminder of the challenges ahead.

The Southern African outfit will now face Morocco on the Northern African's turf, as they host all their AFCON qualifying home matches there due to the lack of an international-standard stadium back home.

This adds to the difficulty of their mission, although Lesotho's draw in Nigeria during a World Cup qualifier back in November suggests they can compete even in seemingly impossible situations.

However, Leslie Notsi's side enters this clash on a five-match winless streak, including a disappointing campaign at the COSAFA Cup in July.

Morocco maintained their status as Africa's current top-ranked team after comfortably defeating Gabon 4-1 at the Stade Adrar last Friday.

Despite having already secured automatic qualification to the next AFCON as hosts, the Atlas Lions did not lower their standards against the Gabonese – a Hakim Ziyech first-half brace from the penalty spot set the tone before Brahim Diaz and Ayoub El Kaabi also found the net in the second half.

Walid Regragui's men are now unbeaten in their last five matches across all competitions, winning the last three and scoring 10 goals in the last two.

In what will be the first-ever meeting against Lesotho, the Atlas Lions will hope to continue their impressive scoring form and extend their winning run in AFCON qualifiers to three matches – their last defeat in this competition was against South Africa in June 2023.

Twenty-nine-year-old striker Motebang Sera scored his 12th international goal, leaving him just three goals behind Jane Thabantso, who is the all-time record goalscorer and man with the most appearances for Lesotho.

Both players are expected to be part of an attacking quartet that also includes Lehlohonolo Fothoane and Tsepang Sefali.

Regragui could make a host of changes for this match in order to give everyone in the squad minutes.

El Kaabi, who has now scored four goals in his last two appearances for Morocco and is third on their all-time goalscorer chart, will be hoping to play from the start in this clash after coming off the bench last time out.

Fenerbahce's Youssef En-Nesyri played no part in the win over Gabon, but he is expected to be seen at some point in Monday's clash.


Lesotho possible starting lineup:
Owono; Ndong, Coco, Fernandez, Senra; Mascarell; Buyla, Ganet, Obiang, Salvador; Nlavo

Morocco possible starting lineup:
Bounou; Hakimi, Aguerd, Abqar, Mazraoui; Amrabat, Ounahi; Ziyech, Diaz, Adli; El-Kaabi



We say: Lesotho 0-3 Morocco

Morocco are the overwhelming favourites in this clash, and this is further boosted as the game will be played on their soil despite Lesotho being the hosts, which is why we are expecting a comprehensive victory from the Atlas Lions.
