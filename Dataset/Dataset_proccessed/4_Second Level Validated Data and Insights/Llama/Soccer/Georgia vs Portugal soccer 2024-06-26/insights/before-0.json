        "Cristiano Ronaldo's desire to play and add to his European Championships goal tally shouldn't be underestimated.",
        "Portugal can shuffle the pack for this group stage finale, but the rest of Group F is wide open, giving Georgia a chance of sneaking through.",
        "Roberto Martinez has already hinted at some squad rotation for Wednesday’s contest.",
        "Rafael Leao is suspended after bookings in both outings so far, while Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, and Vitinha are among those players who could be rested.",
        "There's so much depth on this roster, with Goncalo Ramos, Diogo Jota, and Joao Felix all waiting in the wings as well as talented 19-year-old midfielder Joao Neves.",
        "Portugal should have the lion’s share of possession and I like these odds for Martinez’s men to take a lead into the half-time break.",
        "Georgia have been a fun story at Euro 2024 and they’ve got threats on the counter-attack.",
        "If Ronaldo can be persuaded to take a breather here, there are some big shoes to fill in the Portugal front three — and Jota should be at the top of the list of replacements."
