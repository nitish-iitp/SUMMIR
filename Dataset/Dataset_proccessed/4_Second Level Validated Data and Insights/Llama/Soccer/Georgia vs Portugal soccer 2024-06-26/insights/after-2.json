    "New Records": [
        "Georgia became the first European nation to qualify from the group stage in their first major tournament (World Cup/Euros) since Iceland at Euro 2016.",
        "Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s goal after 01:32 is both Georgia’s fastest ever goal scored at the UEFA European Championship and the earliest Portugal have ever conceded in the competition.",
        "Georges Mikautadze has scored in all three of Georgia’s group matches, becoming only the ninth player to score in all three group matches at a European Championship."
    ],
    "Key Match Events": [
        "Silva’s careless wayward pass just inside his own half went straight to Mikautadze, who weighted his through ball for Kvaratskhelia perfectly, and the Napoli star swept home left-footed into the bottom-right corner with just 92 seconds played.",
        "Luka Lochoshvili winning a penalty following a clumsy – albeit soft – challenge from the somewhat unlucky Silva early in the second half, Mikautadze’s spot-kick couldn’t have been placed better as he slotted it just out of Diogo Costa’s reach in the bottom-right corner."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Georgia needed to beat the star-studded Portugal on Matchday 3 to make it through to the knockouts, it’s fair to say their chances of continuing in Germany looked minimal."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "This was a collective effort, though, and it produced a night Georgia won’t forget in a hurry as they became the first Euros debutants to reach the knockouts since Iceland in 2016."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Portugal saw 73% of the ball in the first 15 minutes, while Ronaldo, João Félix and João Palhinha all went close or tested the excellent Mamardashvili in the Georgia net over the course of the first half.",
        "João Neves (19y 273d), António Silva (20y 240), Francisco Conceição (21y 195d) and Gonçalo Inácio (22y 298d) all started for Portugal, making it the first time in their history that 4+ players under the age of 23 have started in the same match at the UEFA European Championship."
