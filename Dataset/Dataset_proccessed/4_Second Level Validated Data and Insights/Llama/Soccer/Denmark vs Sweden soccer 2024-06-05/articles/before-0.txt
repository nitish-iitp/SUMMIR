Kasper Hjulmand’s team take on Sweden before Norway clash in International Friendlies.

Sweden will make the trip to Parken to take on Denmark on Wednesday in an international friendly. While Kasper Hjulmand’s side are putting the final touches on their Euro 2024 preparations, their visitors will not be gunning for continental glory this summer.

After a strong showing in the qualifying for the Euro 2024, Denmark will look to build some momentum before heading into the tournament this summer. Sweden missed out on a spot at the Euros and will look to disrupt Denmark’s preparations. At the Euros, Denmark will compete in Group C. There they will take on Slovenia, Serbia and England.

Sweden’s poor qualification campaign led to the departure of long-serving boss Janne Andersson and the appointment of former Blackburn Rovers head coach Jon Dahl Tomasson, the first-ever non-Swede to take charge. The Blue and Yellow will look to perform well under the new manager and will try their best to grab a win away from home.

Kick-Off:

Wednesday, 5 June 2024 at 10:30 PM (IST), 05:00 PM (GMT), 12:30 PM (EST)

Stadium: Parken

Form

Denmark (All Competitions): W-D-L-W-W

Sweden (All Competitions): W-L-W-W-L

Players to Watch
Rasmus Hojlund (Denmark)

Rasmus Hojlund’s large physique allows him to hold play up and include others in the game. He often comes deep to collect the ball to assist his side in building from the back, frequently seeking to pass the ball wide for a teammate before turning and racing for a goal. He can finish with curlers, dribbles past the goalie into an open goal, soaring headers and long-range thunderbolts.

Alexander Isak (Sweden)

Alexander Isak is a right-footed centre-forward who can lead the front line on his own or work in a centre-forward pairing. He shows versatility in his movements. If space allows, he can spin in behind, running forward to attack beyond his centre-back markers. Isak can cut inside and shoot across the goal powerfully while maintaining accuracy in bending the ball inside the far post. Equally, he is calm when 1v1 with the goalkeeper.
