Denmark lock horns against Sweden in a friendly on Wednesday

Denmark will entertain Sweden at Parken in a friendly on Wednesday. The hosts play Norway in another friendly later this week before heading to Germany for UEFA Euro 2024.

The visitors have not qualified for the competition and will conclude the ongoing international break with a friendly against Serbia later this week.

The hosts are unbeaten in their two games in 2024, with a win and a draw to their name, keeping two clean sheets. In their previous outing, they overcame the Faroe Islands 2-0 in March. They have been drawn alongside England, Slovakia, and Serbia in a tricky Group C at the UEFA Euro 2024.

Denmark vs Sweden Prediction

De Rød-Hvide have been in good touch recently, suffering just one loss in all competitions since last March. They are unbeaten at home in friendlies since 2015, keeping 11 consecutive clean sheets, and are strong favorites.

Blågult have won three of their last four games in all competitions, scoring seven goals, and will look to build on that form. They have just one win in their last nine meetings against the hosts, scoring just three goals, which is a cause for concern.

Considering the current form of the two teams and the home advantage for Denmark, the hosts should be able to eke out a narrow win.

Prediction: Denmark 2-1 Sweden
