        "Gareth Southgate's men faded somewhat as the match went on, leading to criticism of their all-round performance despite taking maximum points.",
        "The talent at Southgate's disposal is undeniable but at the same time means he will have to make controversial selection choices, and given Alexander-Arnold's unique in-possession skillset, it would be a waste of his talents to not keep him in the starting XI.",
        "England's lacklustre Serbia display",
        "The likes of Harry Kane, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden all came in for criticism from commentators, with many lamenting the fact that these objectively world-class players were unable to showcase the best of their ability.",
        "Right-back turned left-back Kieran Trippier also disappointed, with the Newcastle United vice-captain struggling to influence proceedings.",
        "This has led to a demand for changes to the side ahead of England's clash with Denmark on Thursday, but doing so presents Southgate with a number of selection dilemmas that could lead to unpopular decisions.",
        "Only France can boast a squad as talented as England's, but Southgate will find it difficult to lead his side to victory in Euro 2024 without making difficult choices in regard to his team selection.",
        "Against Denmark, England have the opportunity to show significant improvement from Sunday's outing, but they must field a more balanced XI in order to do so, even if this means replacing talented players such as Foden, Trippier and Walker."

        "England began their campaign in winning fashion on Sunday night with a narrow 1-0 victory over Serbia - although you would not necessarily know it by the reaction.",

        "Trent Alexander-Arnold has proven at club level that he is one of the world's best right-backs, winning the Premier League and Champions League in his trophy-laden time on Merseyside.",
        "Trent Alexander-Arnold's unique abilities warrant a starting spot in Southgate's side against Denmark, but this would entail dropping veteran Kyle Walker, who many value for his defensive attributes.",
        "Kyle Walker has struggled defensively at times over the past season for Manchester City, and his ability on the ball is not comparable to his Liverpool counterpart.",
        "Adam Wharton would be ideal for the midfield position as his skillset lends itself well to possession-oriented football, and he is at present more defensively robust than Kobbie Mainoo.",
        "Playing Wharton alongside Rice would allow the Gunners midfielder to play in a box-to-box role similar to the one he played at Arsenal when Jorginho came into the side.",
        "Phil Foden is not particularly comfortable on the left, and to compensate for this Southgate allowed him to drift into central zones against Serbia while Trippier attacked down the left-hand side instead.",
        "If England were to field a front three of Gordon, Kane and Bukayo Saka against Denmark, it would give more balance to their attack and allow others like Alexander-Arnold to influence the game more significantly by playing passes beyond the Danish defence.",
        "England could win the tournament with these changes",
        "Only France can boast a squad as talented as England's, but Southgate will find it difficult to lead his side to victory in Euro 2024 without making difficult choices in regard to his team selection.",
