In the opening game of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League C campaign, Armenia are set to welcome Latvia at Vazgen Sargsyan anvan Hanrapetakan Marzadasht on Saturday.

The home side beat Kazakhstan 2-1 last time out on June 7, while the visitors managed to overcome Faroe Islands 1-0 on June 11.

The hosts are currently ranked as the 97th best national team in the world according to FIFA, and they were relegated from Nations League B after finishing last in the group stage of the 2022-23 iteration of the competition.

Armenia have lost their last five Nations League matches, and conceded 17 goals in those fixtures.

It should be noted that prior to those defeats, Havakakan won the previous three matches, and were unbeaten for six games.

Boss Oleksandr Petrakov's side come into Saturday's clash having lost seven of their last nine games, as well as having failed to win nine of their last 10 fixtures.

However, although their home form cannot exactly be described as strong, Petrakov's team have at least won two of their last five home matches.

Also, while they have struggled for results of late, Armenia have at least scored in 10 of their last 14 games in all competitions.

Opponents Latvia narrowly beat Faroe Islands 1-0 thanks to a goal in the 50th minute from Andrejs Ciganiks.

The visitors are currently ranked 137th in the world, and in their most recent Nations League campaign in 2022-23, they were promoted from the D League into the C League.

Boss Paolo Nicolato's side have failed to win their two most recent matches in the competition, but prior to these results they did win their last five Nations League games.

Though the 11 Wolves have only lost once in their last four matches, they have lost or been defeated on penalties in 11 of their last 15 fixtures.

Latvia will have to improve on their away form if they are to win on Saturday given they are winless in their last eight games on the road, losing six of those clashes.

The hosts could start Ognjen Cancarevic in goal, while centre-backs Sergey Muradyan and Varazdat Haroyan could marshal the defence.

Armenia may also start a midfield three of Artak Dashyan, Vahan Bichakhchyan and Nair Tiknizyan.

As for the visitors, goalkeeper Rihards Matrevics is likely to be shielded by centre-backs Raivis Jurkovskis, Antonijs Cernomordijs and Kristers Tobers.

Elsewhere, Latvia could start Eduards Daskevics and Davis Ikaunieks as the two most advanced players on Saturday.


Armenia possible starting lineup:
Cancarevic; Harutyunyan, Muradyan, Haroyan, Grigoryan; Dashyan, Bichakhchyan, Tiknizyan; Hovhannisyan, Sevikyan, Spertsyan

Latvia possible starting lineup:
Matrevics; Jurkovskis, Cernomordijs, Tobers; Savalnieks, Vapne, Saveljevs, Varslavans, Zelenkovs; Daskevics, Ikaunieks



We say: Armenia 2-1 Latvia

While neither side have been particularly strong of late, Armenia have at least demonstrated a good ability to find the back of the net in recent matches.

Additionally, Latvia have been poor away from home, and it would not be a surprise if they lost once again.
