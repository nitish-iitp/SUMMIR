Preview: Malawi vs. Burundi - prediction, team news, lineups

Malawi and Burundi will be looking to kick off their respective 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaigns with a win when they go head-to-head at the Bingu National Stadium on Thursday.
 
Both teams could really do with a victory in this one to get themselves back on track off the back of what has been an underwhelming spell since the turn of the year.

Having reached the AFCON knockout stages for the first time during the 2021 tournament, Malawi were optimistic of making it through to a second edition in a row last time out, but a disastrous qualifying round saw them miss out.
 
Managing just five points from their six matches, Patrick Mabedi's men finished third in Group D, five points shy of Guinea and a further five points adrift of group winners Egypt. 
 
The Flames somewhat moved past their continental disappointment to secure a fourth-place finish in last year's COSAFA Cup and have since picked up two wins from their four World Cup qualifiers.
 
The second of those aforementioned two victories came against Sao Tome and Principe on June 6, and that remains Malawi's only win from four outings in 2024—three of which have ended in defeat. 
 
With a clash against 2013 AFCON finalists Burkina Faso five days later to follow Thursday's affair, the home side will be keen to make a return to winning ways in front of their fans.

Like Malawi, Burundi were also absent from the most recent AFCON tournament earlier this year and have only made it to the competition's finals on one occasion in their history.
 
However, Etienne Ndayiragije's men did come close to booking a place at the continental event in Ivory Coast, finishing just one point shy of Namibia in the race for the final spot in Group C.
 
Due to Kenya's withdrawal, Les Hirondelles were drawn in one of the two three-team groups last time out but will have to compete with Senegal, Burkina Faso and Malawi for a place this time around.
 
Burundi failed to win any of their opening four matches of 2024 before finally getting the better of Seychelles in their last involvement to make it seven points from four World Cup qualifying outings.
 
A chance to secure consecutive wins for the first time in almost four years now awaits Thursday's visitors, who are also unbeaten in three straight games ahead of their trip to Lilongwe.

After a lengthy period of absence, defenders Gomezgani Chirwa and Nickson Nyasulu are back in contention for Malawi having both been called up to Mabedi's 28-man squad.
 
Thirty-one-year-old John Banda is closing in on making his 100th international cap and would become just the 11th person in his nation's history to reach that milestone.
 
Jonathan Nahimana is expected to return to Burundi's lineup for this one after Matteo Nkurunziza was handed a rare start against Seychelles last time out.
 
Bienvenue Kanakimana came off the bench to find the back of the net twice in the aforementioned game and will be looking to deliver the goods once again.


Malawi possible starting lineup:
Chokooka; Mwale, Sanudi, Chembezi, Papi; Idana, Chester; Nkhoma, Chawa, Mwaungulu; Chirwa

Burundi possible starting lineup:
Nahimana; Ntibazonkiza, Bukuru, Mukombozi, Musore; Bigirimana, Mokono, Msanga; Kamsoba, Amissi, Shabani




We say: Malawi 1-0 Burundi

Both Malawi and Burundi are short of attacking firepower at their disposal, and we expect a low scoring affair in this one.

That said, we are also backing the home side to just about drag themselves over the line and claim a narrow win at the end of the 90 minutes.
