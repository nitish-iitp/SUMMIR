This trip to Montenegro will live long in the memory for Craig Bellamy and the hundreds of Wales supporters who made the jaunt. In the city of Niksic, at a poky stadium with only two stands – one completely exposed to the elements, soaking the poncho-wearing fans – Bellamy chalked up his first win as Wales manager.

The pitch, ringfenced by a running track, had survived biblical rainstorms that prompted local power cuts but worsened throughout and by half-time it resembled a hazard-awareness course. In filthy if not farcical conditions, Wales made a lightning start, Kieffer Moore striking inside 38 seconds and Harry Wilson adding an improvised, superb second from about 25 yards less than two minutes later. Puddles littered the pitch but ultimately Driton Camaj’s 73rd-minute strike did not dampen the mood, though victory was not without problems.

This match was due to be played in Podgorica but a fortnight ago the game was moved to Niksic, 45 minutes away by car, because Uefa held concerns over the pitch. The surface, normally home to Montenegro Under-21 matches, was certainly tested. For Wales supporters, tricolour bucket hats helped shelter from incessant downpours. For the Montenegro manager, Robert Prosinecki, the former Real Madrid midfielder, a red and yellow cap did that job.

“It was the hardest, toughest conditions,” said Bellamy, who was drenched a few minutes into the game. “It just didn’t let up. I didn’t plan for that in Montenegro in early September … the conditions didn’t allow the football, it was just impossible. We had to battle it out and this group have got that. We had to dig in.”

It was hard not to think Montenegro’s players were affected by the emotional minute’s applause for their former goalkeeper, Matija Sarkic, who died aged 26 in June. Several players had tears pooling in their eyes for Sarkic, the former Millwall goalkeeper who died on holiday in Budva. Despite a dreadful start, the hosts rallied and while Neco Williams would have had a one-on-one chance to make it 3-0 had his touch been better just after the half-hour to enhance a dream start for Wales, the visitors were fortunate to not have conceded at half-time.

Nikola Krstovic sent a shot wide after collecting a devilish Stefan Mugosa cross on eight minutes. Wales also survived a strong penalty appeal after Stevan Jovetic’s header from a dinked cross struck Ben Davies’s right arm and Davies, the captain until Aaron Ramsey arrived from the bench late on, earlier made a magnificent goalline clearance to file away with the rest of them after a double save by the debutant Karl Darlow. Oh, and the former Manchester City striker Jovetic hit the crossbar with an effort from inside his own half.

Somehow Moore did not make it 3-0 on 66 minutes, contriving to miss from three yards out after Davies squared the ball from inside the box; Moore whacked the post in frustration after sliding in and scooping over the bar. A few minutes earlier Williams had another fine chance after the ball dropped in the box.

Until then Wales had begun to drop off. First-half injuries to Connor Roberts and Lewis Koumas, the latter on his first competitive start, did not help their flow. “A lot went on,” said Bellamy, revealing a painful bus journey from the capital. “Because of the conditions, part of me early on was like: ‘This game could get called off.’”

Montenegro still found it too easy to pick holes in the Wales defence. Vladimir Jovovic wellied a shot against a post from distance and then Darlow saved superbly from Jovetic. Eventually Montenegro got their reward, feasting on some slack defending as Krstovic squared for Camaj to convert from close range. Ultimately, though, Wales registered a first victory under Bellamy.

“What did I make of it? Wet!” said the manager, whose side have taken four points from their opening two Nations League matches and return to action against Iceland in Reykjavik in October. “It’s been a really good week. I’m a little bit sad because they’re [the players] going [back to their clubs] now so I won’t see them for a few weeks. I don’t want them to go … that’s how much I’ve enjoyed working with them. I hope they feel the same way.”
