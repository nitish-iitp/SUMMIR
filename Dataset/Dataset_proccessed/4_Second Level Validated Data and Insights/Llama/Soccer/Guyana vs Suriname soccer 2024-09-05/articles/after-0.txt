Guyana will play host to Suriname at the Synthetic Track and Field Facility in the CONCACAF Nations League on Thursday. The sides are set to face off against each other for the 22nd time.

Guyana vs Suriname Preview

Guyana will compete in Group A of League A alongside five other teams including Suriname. The top two finishers will advance to the quarterfinals while the fourth and fifth-placed teams will qualify for the Gold Cup preliminaries. The bottom two sides will be relegated to League B. Guyana are eying a ticket to the Nations League Finals.

The Golden Jaguars were promoted from League B to A in the previous edition after topping Group B of League B with 15 points. They are hoping for a better campaign this time by possibly reaching the finals for the first time. However, they will also fight to avoid relegation to League B. Guyana lost to Suriname 2-1 in their previous clash.

However, they continue to search for a historic qualification to the Nations League Finals, as they kick off their fourth participation in the competition.

Natio are undefeated in their last five matches in all competitions, after snapping an unimpressive winless streak of five games.
