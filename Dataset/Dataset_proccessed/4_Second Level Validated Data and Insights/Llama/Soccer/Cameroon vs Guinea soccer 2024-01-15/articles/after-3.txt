Guinea took an unexpected lead just 10 minutes in as they capitalised on some woeful defending from Olivier Kemen. Cameroon failed to clear the danger after a shot was saved and Kemen buckled under the pressure as he knocked the ball towards Mohamed Bayo who fired in the opener.

Things got tough for Guinea later in the half, however, as Francois Kamano was sent off for a nasty challenge. Cameroon managed to capitalise on their numerical advantage five minutes into the second half as Georges-Kevin N'Koudou's excellent cross found Frank Magri at the back post and the attacker headed in with his team's first effort on target.

Although Cameroon kept the ball in Guinea's half for the rest of the game, they could not find a way through until the 88th minute when Karl Toko Ekambi had a shot saved.

THE MVP

As well as setting up the equalising goal, N'Koudou was a big threat for Cameroon throughout the game thanks to his deliveries. They struggled to create many clear-cut chances but the winger stepped up with a vital ball into the box to make it 1-1.

THE BIG LOSER

Kamano's reckless challenge late in the first half saw him shown a straight red card and made life difficult for his team. Cameroon were dominating possession but struggled to create clear chances and Guinea still looked dangerous. All that changed in the second half, however, as 10-man Guinea struggled to get forward and were unable to register a single shot in the last 45 minutes.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Cameroon are set for a big challenge next as they take on reigning champions Senegal, who won their first game earlier in the day, on January 19. The same day, Guinea will face Gambia in their second match.
