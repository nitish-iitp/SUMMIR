    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Righto, Senegal, the defending champs, lead the group with three points and meet Cameroon, on one, next in what should be a jazzer; Guinea have one too, and face the Gambia, on zero."

        "What a result that is for Guinea, who will fancy themselves to beat the Gambia and give Senegal game. Cameroon, meanwhile, should still qualify, but to do anything in this competition, they’ll not only have to play better than that, they’ll have to play different to that."
