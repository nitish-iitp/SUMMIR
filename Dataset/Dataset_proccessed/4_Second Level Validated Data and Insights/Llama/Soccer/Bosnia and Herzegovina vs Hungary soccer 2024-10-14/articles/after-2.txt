Hungary Beat Bosnia with a Brace From Captain Szoboszlai

Hungary had a great international break this October. After an unexpected tie against the Euro 2024 semi-finalists Netherlands (1–1 at home), the national team beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 2–0 on the road in Zenica. The Bosnians are Hungary’s biggest rivals in the relegation clash in League A of the UEFA Nations League, and have now fallen behind in the race.

While Bosnia had most of the possession throughout the game, Hungary was the side that created the greater chances. Goalkeeper Nikola Vasilj, the Man of the Match of the Budapest game between the two national teams last month, was called into action a few times again early in the game.

In the 38th minute, however, there was nothing even he could do to stop Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai from scoring. He received a great low pass from Zsolt Nagy (who also scored an assist in the last game against the Dutch) into the box, took a touch, and then deftly put it into the side netting at the bottom far corner. 1–0 to Hungary.

The second half also started with a key moment from Nagy. The Puskás Akadémia wingback clashed with Omerović inside Bosnia and Herzegovina’s penalty area. English referee Anthony Taylor made a favourable call to our boys and awarded the penalty. Szoboszlai stepped up to finish the job, converted the spot kick, and Hungary was now two goals ahead. This was the Liverpool superstar’s 14th goal in his 49th game for Hungary.

For the rest of the game, the former Premier League champion Bosnian legend Edin Džeko had a couple of shots on goal, but was stopped both times by the Hungarian goalie Dénes Dibusz.

The game finished 2–0 to Hungary. Since Germany beat the Netherlands 1–0 at home in the other game of the group, Hungary are now sitting tied on points with the Netherlands in second and third place. The two sides are playing their re-match in Amsterdam, Netherlands on 16 November. Despite their recent draw, the Dutch are heavily favoured to win that game.

Hungary’s last game in the group stage of this Nations League season will be played on 19 November at the Puskás Arena in Budapest, Hungary against Germany. In the away leg of that tie, Hungary had a disappointing showing and was blown a heavy 5–0 loss. With direct relegation most likely avoided already, the national team’s main goal should be to make amends with the fans for the embarrassing defeat.
