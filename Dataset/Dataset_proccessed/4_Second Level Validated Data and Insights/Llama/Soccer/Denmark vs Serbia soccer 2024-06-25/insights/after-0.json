    "New Records": [
        "Denmark have drawn all three of their group games for the first time ever at a major tournament (World Cup & Euros)",
        "Denmark (28y 148d) named their oldest starting XI for a UEFA European Championship game since 2004",
        "Against Serbia, Eriksen added another two chances created to his total haul of 13 at EURO 2024, the most ever by a Danish player at a major tournament on record (World Cup & Euros since 1980)",
        "Denmark have qualified for the knockout stages of a UEFA European Championship on three of their last four attempts"
    ],
    "Key Match Events": [
        "Denmark’s solitary shot equated to just 0.06 expected goals (xG) and ensured they accumulated only two first-half shots on target across their three Group C matches, the joint fewest of any side in the tournament",
        "Serbia's solitary shot equated to just 0.06 expected goals (xG) and ensured they accumulated only two first-half shots on target across their three Group C matches",
        "Alexander Bah headed a good chance off target – that was the longest wait for the first shot in a Euro 2024 match so far",
        "Serbia went into the game in Munich with more than a fighting chance of progress, knowing a victory could even see them top the group",
        "Serbia turned to Dusan Tadic in an attempt to try something different. For a split early in the second half, it looked as though he’d provided the answer, slicing open the Denmark defence to feed fellow half-time substitute Luka Jovic"
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "We always want to win, we miss being in the locker room singing about how we won, that’s what we want,” Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said pre-game after successive draws in their first two games"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "With their own underwhelming output in front of goal, it’s fair to say that defensive solidity ultimately played a major role in Denmark’s progress to the last 16, where hosts Germany await"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Serbia mustered just one shot on target against Denmark, with their total haul of six shots on target at Euro 2024 their lowest-ever figure as an independent nation at a major tournament (World Cup & Euros since 2006)",
        "Denmark ended the group stage with the third-lowest xG against (2.3) among the teams to have played three matches",
        "Serbia are now without a victory in their last eight major tournament matches (Euros/World Cup – D3 L5), since a 1-0 win over Costa Rica at the 2018 World Cup"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Kasper Schmeichel was mostly a bystander even when his team were under pressure",
        "Andersen and Jannik Vestergaard were key to that; the former won nine of 14 aerial duels, the latter five of eight, while they amassed nine clearances between them",
        "A disappointingly tame Sergej Milinkovic-Savic effort from the edge of the box late on was as close as Serbia came to hoisting themselves into the knockouts"
