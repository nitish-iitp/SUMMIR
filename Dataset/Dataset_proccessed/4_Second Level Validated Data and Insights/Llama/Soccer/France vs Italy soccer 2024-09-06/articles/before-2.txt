France vs Italy Predicted Lineups Preview

Didier Deschamps has made some bold decisions in his most recent France squad selection leading up to next month’s international break. Under Deschamps’s leadership, France made it to the final of Euro 2016 while playing on their home turf. They then secured victory in the 2018 World Cup held in Russia.

The defence of their European championship came to a devastating end in 2020, followed by a heartbreaking loss to Argentina in the final of the 2022 World Cup. The French national team, unfortunately, faced defeat in the semi-final of Euro 2024 against Spain in Germany.

Coach Deschamps has announced the squad in the upcoming UEFA Nations League fixtures next month. Three players have been excluded from their Euro 2024 squad: Benjamin Pavard, Kingsley Coman, and Adrien Rabiot.

Kylian Mbappe is set to make his long-awaited return to the French national team after joining Real Madrid. Experienced forward Olivier Giroud, currently representing Major League Soccer team Los Angeles FC, decided to end his international career following the conclusion of the European Championship.

The victorious Les Bleus, who emerged triumphant in the Nations League this year, are set to face off against Israel in League A Group 2. The upcoming matches are scheduled to be held in October and November.

Sandro Tonali was recently reinstated into Italy’s squad following a 10-month suspension related to gambling. Coach Luciano Spalletti has recently included Leicester defender Caleb Okoli and Atalanta midfielder Marco Brescianini in the squad for upcoming Nations League matches against France and Israel.

Unfortunately, Nicolò Barella, a crucial midfielder, was unable to join the squad due to a sinus issue. Tonali has made a comeback on the pitch, playing for Newcastle. Almost a year ago, he faced a ban from the Italian football federation due to his involvement in betting on matches involving AC Milan and Brescia, teams he used to play for.

Fiorentina forward Moise Kean has made a return to the national team after being away for almost a year. Next Friday, Italy will be taking on France, followed by a match against Israel in Budapest three days later.

Italy’s hopes were dashed when they were knocked out by Switzerland in the round of 16 at the European Championship, a disappointing outcome for the Azzurri. Tonali was unable to participate in the tournament due to a ban. Juventus midfielder Nicolò Fagioli, who faced a ban for betting, made a comeback for the Euros and is still a part of the team.
