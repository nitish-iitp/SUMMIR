The Copa América final is set: Colombia will face Lionel Messi and Argentina, who will defend their championship title, on Sunday at the Hard Rock Stadium. Dubbed “the world’s oldest continental tournament,” Copa América has been underway in 14 venues across the U.S. this year, culminating in Miami Gardens with the top two teams in a final match on July 14th.

Read on for what you need to know about the Copa América final in Miami below.

When is the Copa América final at the Hard Rock Stadium?

The Hard Rock Stadium is scheduled to host a total of three games, including two group stages and the final. The two group stages already went down in June, with Uruguay beating Panama 3-1 on June 23rd and Argentina with a 2-0 win over Peru on June 29th.

Looking ahead to the final on Sunday, July 14th, the two teams facing off against each other are Colombia and Argentina. The match is scheduled for 8 p.m.

How to get tickets to the Copa América final

Tickets for the match is available for purchase on Ticketmaster, which can be found through the official Copa América site. Prices start at a whopping $1,500 and are going as far high as $9,000.

You can also find tickets on SeatGeek and StubHub.

How to get to the Hard Rock Stadium for Copa América

Driving straight to the stadium is an option (we’ll get to parking in a sec). But if you prefer to take a rideshare service, the designated pick-up and drop-off area is Lot 42 on NW 27th Ave. It’s south of Walmart and estimated to be a walk time of 20 minutes to and from the stadium.

If you’re coming from elsewhere in Florida, Aventura Brightline will also be offering complimentary shuttles to take you directly to the stadium. Shuttles will depart 10 minutes after every train arrival and return shuttles leave one hour before trains depart. To find the shuttles back to the station, make your way to the South of the stadium on 199th St.

Parking at the Hard Rock Stadium

Driving to the stadium? No prob! Parking is currently available for purchase and it’s recommended you plan ahead of time. Copa Finals parking will open at 3 p.m. on July 14, with on-site Orange and Yellow pre-paid parking at $50 and off-site Gray Lotat $45. If you choose to reserve parking on match day, fees are $60 with credit card or $55 SunPass Plus. Bus parking is $120.

Who will perform at the Copa América closing ceremony?

It’s none other than the Colombian icon herself — Shakira! She confirmed her participation in the closing ceremony with a social media post that read: “Save the date!  July 14, 2024  Hard Rock Stadium Miami, FL”. In fact, her song “Puntería” has been designated the official song for this year’s tournament, so it’s safe to say you’ll get to hear it live!

How to watch the Copa América from home

If you’re unable to make it to the Hard Rock Stadium, the tournament will be broadcast on FOX Networks, which includes Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, as well as the Fox Sports app. The matches will also be broadcast on Univision and TUDN with Spanish commentary.

If you don’t have cable, you can stream via Sling TV’s Blue Plan or Fubo, which is currently offering a free trial for new users.
