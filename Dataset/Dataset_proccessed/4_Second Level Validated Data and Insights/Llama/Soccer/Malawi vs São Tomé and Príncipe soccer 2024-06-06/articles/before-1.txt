Moroka Swallows red-hot striker Gabadinho Mhango has been dropped from the Fifa World Cup preliminary qualifying matches for Malawi’s Flames.

Mhango, whose goals helped Swallows escape relegation from the just-ended DStv Premiership campaign, was omitted from the Flames squad, which coach Patrick Mabedi released on Sunday.

The Kaizer Chiefs legend has not explained the reasons for the exclusion of Mhango who returned to the Flames squad for the recent Four-Nation Tournament held in Lilongwe from March 18 to 26 2024.

Mabedi has also sidelined Richards Bay striker Khuda Muyaba with Black Leopards goalkeeper Brighton Munthali as the only South Africa-based player in the 26-member squad.

Lidoda Duvha’s Malawian midfielder Rafick Namwera has also been ignored with the foreign-based players in the squad being America-based striker Henri Kumwenda, Chawanangwa Kaonga (Zanaco, Zambia), Chifundo Mphasi (Kabwe Warriors, Zambia), John Banda (UD Songo, Mozambique) and Iraq-based defender Chembezi Denis (Al Qasim FC).

Malawi host São Tomé and Príncipe on Thursday, June 6, 2024 then travel to Equatoria Guinea four days later in Group H of the World Cup qualifying matches for Africa.

The second-placed Flames started the World Cup qualifying race with an away 1-0 win in Liberia before losing at home by a similar margin to leaders Tunisia on November 21, 2023.
