England 'receive major injury boost' ahead of Euro 2024 quarter-final

England left-back Luke Shaw is expected to be passed fit for Saturday's Euro 2024 quarter-final against Switzerland.

The Three Lions are looking forward to making a quarter-final appearance after they ousted Slovakia in a dramatic last-16 tie.

Jude Bellingham scored a stoppage-time equaliser, before Harry Kane netted an early goal in extra time to set up a tricky encounter against Switzerland in Dusseldorf.

As England turn their focus to their fifth game of the tournament, Shaw's fitness is once again the subject of speculation.

Shaw to be ready for Switzerland clash

The Manchester United defender has been forced to miss the first four games at Euro 2024 due to a hamstring injury which has kept him out of action since February.

As the only natural left-back in the squad, Shaw's absence has resulted in an unbalanced side, with the right-footed Kieran Trippier forced to operate on the left side of defence.

According to the Daily Mail, Shaw is likely to be fit for Saturday's contest to give his country a much-needed boost.

The report claims that the 28-year-old will be available to play some role in the quarter-final tie, but it remains to be seen how many minutes, if any, he will be given against Switzerland.

Could Shaw start against Switzerland?

England boss Gareth Southgate may be reluctant to throw Shaw straight into the starting lineup due to his lack of match practice.

However, at this stage of the tournament, England are not going to be presented with many opportunities to ease Shaw back in, which is why Southgate may be tempted to take a risk and start him in the quarter-final.

If he decides to take the risk, Southgate would most likely use Shaw as a left wing-back, with the England boss expected to switch to a back three on Saturday.

Alternatively, he could leave Shaw on the bench and use either Bukayo Saka or Eberechi Eze as makeshift wing-backs.

Trent Alexander-Arnold and Trippier may also be considered to fill in on the left side if Southgate decides against using any of the alternative options.
