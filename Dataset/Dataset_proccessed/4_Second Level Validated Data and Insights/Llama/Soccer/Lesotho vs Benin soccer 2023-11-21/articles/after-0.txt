Lesotho and Benin lock horns in their second fixture of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa on Tuesday.

Ranked 153rd in the world, Lesotho have never qualified for any major tournament before. In their opening game of the World Cup qualifier, the Crocodiles were held to a 1-1 draw by Nigeria. Motlomelo Mkhwanazi put them in front after 56 minutes, but Semi Ajayi equalised for the Super Eagles after 11 minutes.

Meanwhile, Benin went down 2-1 to South Africa in their opening qualifier. Percy Tau put the Bafana Bafana in front after just two minutes before Khuliso Mudao made it 2-0 before the break. Steve Mounie pulled one back for Benin in the 70th minute as Gernot Rohr’s side threatened to come back into the game, but ultimately fell short of finding the equaliser.

In their previous two encounters, Benin beat Lesotho 1-0 before the sides drew 0-0 (both coming in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, in November 2020).

Lesotho starting XI: Sekhoane Moerane, Thabo Matsoele, Rethabile Rasethuntsa, Motlomelo Mkwanazi, Motete Mohai, Jane Thaba-Ntso, Lisema Lebokollane, Thabo Lesaoana, Tsepang Sefali, Tshwarelo Bereng, Sera Motebang.
