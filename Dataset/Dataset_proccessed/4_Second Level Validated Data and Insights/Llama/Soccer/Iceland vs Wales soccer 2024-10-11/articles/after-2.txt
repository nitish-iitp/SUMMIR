Iceland secured a comeback draw against Wales in the Nations League in a match of two halves played out in the cold conditions of Reykjavik.

Wales started the game as the more aggressive and competant side. They were free flowing and in control of the ball in the midfield areas. This dominance resulted in two eerily similar goals. Neco Williams with a long ball over the top, Harry Wilson with a run from deep in behind the defence.

Wilson’s first effort was cleared off the line by Hakon Rafn Valdimarsson only for Brennan Johnson to tap in the rebound. The second effort was coolly dispatched by the midfielder meaning the Dragons led 2-0 at half-time.

But they never got going again. Substitutions and an intense press from Iceland saw them turn the game around. The hosts were unafraid to shoot from even half-decent positions and Logi Tomasson netted twice to draw level. From there Wales were clinging on and managed to keep out the hosts to earn themselves a good point.

HT Iceland 0-2 Wales

Iceland have won only one of their previous seven meetings with Wales (one draw, five defeats), a 1-0 home win in 1984 in a World Cup qualifier.

Wales have won their last four games against Iceland, most recently 3-1 in a 2014 friendly. They have previously only won five successive matches against two opponents: Luxembourg (six between 1974 and 2010) and Azerbaijan (five between 2005 and 2019).

Half-time! Iceland 0-2 Wales

GOAL! Iceland 0-2 Wales (Harry Wilson, 29’)

It’s almost a carbon copy of the first goal!

Neco Williams with the pass over the top, Harry Wilson with the run from deep. He gets in behind the fullback, takes the ball into the box then slots it past the goalkeeper.

29 mins: Wales break through Neco Williams who looks sharp. He drifts into the midfield the gets clattered by Stefan Teitur Thordarson.

He collects a yellow card and will miss the next match for Iceland. Williams is lucky to bounce back from that challenge. It was a cruncher.
