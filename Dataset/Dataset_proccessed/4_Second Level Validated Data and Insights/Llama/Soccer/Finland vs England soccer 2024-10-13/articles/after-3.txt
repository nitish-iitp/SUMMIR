UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
FINLAND 1-3 ENGLAND - THREE LIONS GET BACK TO WINNING WAYS WITH VICTORY OVER FINLAND IN UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
BYLEON IMBER

UPDATED 13/10/2024 AT 18:43 GMT

England's home defeat against Greece was a chastening one for Lee Carsley and his players, but they did manage to respond with a solid win against Finland in their UEFA Nations League encounter at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium on Sunday. Jack Grealish netted the opener before Trent Alexander-Arnold bagged the second and Declan Rice the third. Finland grabbed a late consolation goal in response.

England banished the disappointment of their midweek UEFA Nations League defeat to Greece as they ran out 3-1 winners over Finland to boost their automatic promotion hopes from League B Group 2.
Lee Carsley's side disappointed the Wembley crowd on Thursday as they fell to a 2-1 defeat against the group leaders, but responded in quick fashion with Euro 2024 absentees Angel Gomes and Jack Grealish combining to open the scoring in Helsinki within 18 minutes.

The Three Lions lulled after the opening goal as Finland created several opportunities to level the scoring. Topi Keskinen, particularly, was a livewire for the hosts, but was let down by his team-mates' finishing.

Fredrik Jensen should have made it 1-1 shortly after the interval, spurning miles over from just yards out after Keskinen's excellent low cross.
But Carsley's side avoided being punished for some of their defensive frailties as an exceptional Trent Alexander-Arnold free-kick 16 minutes from time doubled their lead.
Substitute Ollie Watkins' surging run set up Declan Rice to make it three for England in the final six minutes, before Finland got a consolation late on - Arttu Hoskonen heading home with ease from a corner.
The result saw England go level on points with Greece but trailing on goal difference, with the leaders set to face Republic of Ireland in their game in hand on Sunday evening.

TALKING POINT - ENGLAND VICTORIOUS, BUT DO THEY MAKE IT HARDER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE?
There's a clear disparity in the world rankings between England (No. 4) and Finland (No. 64). But from Grealish's opener on 18 minutes until Alexander-Arnold doubled the lead in the 74th, there was not a whole lot between the two sides.
In fact, it was Finland who carved out the better opportunities for much of the game as Carsley's side struggled to break down the hosts' defence. The hosts had Jensen's horrible miss on 56 minutes to blame for not being level in the second half. The Augsburg forward, who has suffered a torrid few years in front of goal for both club and nation, blew the best opportunity of the game from Keskinen's fabulous cross. Had it gone in, the game could have panned out quite differently.
England were spared by Finland's poor form in front of goal and ultimately rescued a comfortable cushion in the final moments as the hosts began to tire. But they will not get these luxuries against higher-ranked opposition, who they hope to match-up with as promotion from Nations League B remains the ambition. But, after the disappointment against Greece on Thursday, getting back to winning ways was the most important thing for Carsley's side. And a 3-1 victory will ultimately be gratefully received in the England camp, even if they will be disappointed with the cheap manner of Finland's late consolation.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - TRENT ALEXANDER-ARNOLD (ENGLAND)
This so nearly went to Finland forward Keskinen, who was let down by his side's poor finishing. But ultimately, after scoring the absolutely belting free-kick to establish a two-goal cushion, it has to go to the out-of-position Alexander-Arnold.
Many of England's defensive troubles throughout the evening came on their right-hand side, something not anticipated ahead of kick-off with Alexander-Arnold figuring in the unfamiliar left-back position. But he did well out there. Cutting inside to contribute to the build-up for the first goal, while nestling in that delightful second. He likely won't be the long-term solution out on the left, but he did more than a commendable job in Helsinki.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
18' GOAL! Finland 0-1 England (Grealish): An excellent goal, that. Grealish starts the move and finishes it. The Manchester City man finds Alexander-Arnold who came inside to feed Gomes. The Lille midfielder takes his time before playing an inch-perfect little through pass back to Grealish, who tucked home a really nice finish.
56' JENSEN MISSES GLORIOUS CHANCE! Keskinen AGAIN orchestrates Finland's forays forward, and he flashes an absolute peach of a low cross into Jensen. The Augsburg striker, from yards out, fires well over. It's a horrific miss. There's really no surprise that this side have struggled to chalk up goals with this display of finishing. He should have two this evening. Keskinen will feel aggrieved that he has not grabbed a couple of assists too.
74' GOAL! Finland 0-2 England (Alexander-Arnold): What a strike! Alexander-Arnold sets himself from the free-kick, about 25 yards out slightly to the left, and hits an absolute pearler to put England 2-0 up! You don't see them hit too much sweeter, with Hradecky only able to push it further into his top right corner.
84' GOAL! Finland 0-3 England (Rice): This has suddenly become comfortable for Carsley's side. Watkins shows his worth with an excellent run out on the left. He finds Rice, who strayed into the box from midfield. The Arsenal midfielder simply taps home and victory is ensured for the visitors.
87' GOAL! Finland 1-3 England (Hoskonen): Wow, that was simple. A corner is flashed in and Hoskonen gets a head to it at the near post to fire beyond Henderson. England clearly switched off there. It will only be a consolation, but a weak goal to give away.
