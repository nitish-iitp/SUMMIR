    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Admittedly, Džeko was largely ineffective tonight. But if you’ve ever played as a 38-year-old against guys who are fifteen years younger, then you understand how amazing it feels to score against an elite opponent in any league or competition.",
        "In the 30th minute, Andrich delivered a beautiful ball to Wirtz that led to the opening goal.",
        "In the 35th minute, Andrich produced the play of the match when he chased down Ermedin Demirović and barely nudged him in the box to prevent an easy breakaway goal that would have tied the match."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Germany used a quick passing attack to dominate possession and keep the Bosnians on their heels.",
        "Thanks to a favorable result in the other Group A3 match, Germany sit alone atop the group.",
        "Bayern loanee Alexander Nübel earned his first international start."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Jamal Musiala, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Leroy Sané all missed the match due to minor injuries.",
        "The game was relatively uneventful until the 30th minute.",
        "Germany’s tactical setup allowed Mittelstädt to roam freely and he consistently sent dangerous balls into the box."
