        "Austria, for all the plaudits about their improvement in the past couple of years, exit the Euros at the same stage as in the tournament’s previous playing three years ago — when they put up a serious fight before going down 2-1, after extra time, to Italy, the eventual champions."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The huge number of Turks living in Germany has made them almost the secondary ‘home’ side in this tournament, obvious in cities throughout the country whenever they’re playing, but never clearer than at the actual matches."

    "Others": [
        "The actual standard of football, it must be said, was often atrocious.",
