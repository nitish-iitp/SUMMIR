Gibraltar hilariously trolled Wales after holding Rob Pages' side to a 0-0 draw at the Estadio Algarve on Thursday.

The hosts managed just a single shot and had 21% possession throughout the 90 minutes but were able to keep Wales side that featured the likes of Brennan Johnson and Daniel James at bay and halt their 13-game losing streak in the process.

Prior to the game BBC Sport Wales' X account tweeted that Gibraltar were in the midst of the worst losing streak in their history having suffered 13 consecutive defeats with an aggregate score of 0-50.

Page was booed following the game and insisted he understood the frustrations of the fans

Following the game Wales fans booed Page and called for the former Northampton boss to be sacked, with the result the side's latest setback after they failed to qualify for Euro 2024.

'They are entitled to their opinion, absolutely. I get it, I completely get it,' Page said of the fans' reaction.

'I'm a Welsh supporter as well as the manager, I'm disappointed. But I have to keep saying about the bigger picture and I'll probably get criticised for that.

'It's the bigger picture and we're not going to lose focus on what we've done.'
