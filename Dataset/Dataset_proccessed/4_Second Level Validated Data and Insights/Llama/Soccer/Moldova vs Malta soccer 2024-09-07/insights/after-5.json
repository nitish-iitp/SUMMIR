        "The Malta national football team's ambition of winning promotion in the UEFA Nations League is facing a major test in Chisinau when they open their UEFA Nations League campaign against Moldova at the Stadionul Zimbru on Saturday evening.",
        "The Malta team has failed to reach this objective in both editions held in 2020 and 2022, as on each occasion the team had to settle for second place in the group behind first the Faroe Islands and then Estonia.",
        "Goalkeeper Henry Bonello said that the absence of his Ħamrun Spartans team-mate Steve Borg was a major miss, but the team still has a lot of quality to try and fill the void of those players who didn’t make it for this match."
