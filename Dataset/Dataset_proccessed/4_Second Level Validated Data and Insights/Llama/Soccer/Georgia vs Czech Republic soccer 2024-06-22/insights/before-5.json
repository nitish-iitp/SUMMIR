        "Saturday’s clash will mark the first-ever coming together of these two nations.",
        "Czechia’s defeat to Portugal was only their second time tasting defeat in their last 15 matches.",
        "Georgia is more familiar with the taste of defeat (six in the last 15), but half of these have been against strong opposition, namely Spain (twice) and Morocco."

    "Others": [
        "The game will be accessible via 1TV (aka First Channel) in Georgia, while in Czechia, viewers can watch live via Česká Televize (CT) Sport.",
        "In the UK, BBC One is the channel you need.",
        "Prediction: It was hard not to be impressed by a plucky Georgian side in their Group F opener with Turkiye. The Jvarosnebi played without fear and with a similar mindset; they should find the back of the net against a Czechia side struggling for clean sheets."
