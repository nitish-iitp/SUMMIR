How Georgia could line up against Czech Republic

Aiming to get some points on the board in Group F, Georgia tackle the Czech Republic on Saturday evening, when defeat could see them make an early exit from Euro 2024.

Willy Sagnol's side head towards a crucial clash in Hamburg with a full squad available, as Otar Kiteishvili should be fit to feature after overcoming an injury.

The Sturm Graz midfielder was consigned to a place on the bench against Turkey - to whom Georgia suffered a 3-1 defeat - but he is now back in contention.

Following some positive signs on Tuesday, Sagnol is set to name a similar starting XI this weekend, with Georges Mikautadze aiming to build on scoring his nation's first goal at a major tournament.

A mainstay of Georgia's front line, Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia - renowned for his direct dribbling style and set-piece delivery - will partner the Metz striker once again.

Giorgi Kochorashvili should continue in the Georgian engine room, having impressed against Turkey, capping off an all-action display with an assist for Mikautadze's history-making goal.

In defence, captain Guram Kashia will win his 115th cap, most likely featuring at the heart of a back three.

Georgia possible starting lineup: Mamardashvili; Dvali, Kashia, Kverkvelia; Kakabadze, Kochorashvili, Mekvabishvili, Chakvetadze, Tsitaishvili; Kvaratskhelia, Mikautadze
