        "Seb Stafford-Bloor: Spain. They have a bit of everything: pace, skill, flair — and it’s all supported by dependable world-class players. Anyone who beats them will probably win the tournament.",
        "Jacob Whitehead: Spain — their strength in depth was shown against Albania, and in Nico Williams, they have the player of the tournament so far.",
        "Carl Anka: Germany. The hosts have the most tactically-adept coach, a fluid front four and great options off the bench.",
        "Oliver Kay: I’m sticking with France, even though they’ve been poor so far and they are on the tougher side of the draw. Why? Quality and know-how.",
        "James Horncastle: Seb’s gone for Spain so… Austria were my dark horse before the tournament. They’ve exceeded expectations, and shouldn’t fear England and Italy in their half of the draw.",
        "Matt Slater: It’s coming home… if football was invented in Spain. No, that’s too obvious. It’s coming home."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Stafford-Bloor: Probably the atmosphere in Munich’s Marienplatz on the opening day (hosts Germany beat Scotland 5-1 in Munich that night). It was one of those ‘Welcome to the tournament’ moments that set a tone which has lasted throughout.",
        "Whitehead: Mattia Zaccagni’s late equaliser for Italy against Croatia — an Alessandro Del Piero-esque finish that knocked out the great Luka Modric from what was probably his final major tournament.",
        "Anka: Georgia fans singing their national anthem before facing the Czech Republic. Players and fanbase beaming with pride. They partied hard in Hamburg all night afterwards, too.",
        "Kay: That run of dramatic, late, winning goals, some of them spectacular, and the noise that greeted them. A welcome reminder of how much international football means, particularly to smaller countries.",
        "Horncastle: Honestly, it’s my colleague Pol Ballus telling me, in the car back from Gelsenkirchen, that Lamine Yamal’s father, Mounir Nasraoui, is 34 years old. Check out his Instagram. Incredible content.",
        "Slater: The flash of lightning that seemed to hit the Frankfurt Arena during the Romania-Slovakia game, which was plenty loud enough already."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Stafford-Bloor: England. The standard of performance was bad enough, but the noise they have inspired has been — as it always, always is — deeply tedious.",
        "Whitehead: All of Group C. It would have been Serbia, but at least they scored a last-minute equaliser, so England get a special mention.",
        "Anka: Poland have struggled in the entertainment stakes since beating Switzerland in the round of 16 at the Euros eight years ago. Robert Lewandowski or bust has finally run its course.",
        "Kay: The easy answer is England, but at least they’ve tried to keep the ball and tried to attack. Scotland, having done so well to qualify, left their ambitions in the overhead locker when they flew here.",
        "Horncastle: I want to know at which point the England fan who woke up in the early hours in Gelsenkirchen’s Arena AufSchalke fell asleep. I’m guessing it was half an hour after England kicked off.",
        "Slater: England, by miles. The Denmark game was so bad it conned me into thinking the Slovenia game that followed was OK. But Scotland’s insipid display against Hungary warrants a mention."
