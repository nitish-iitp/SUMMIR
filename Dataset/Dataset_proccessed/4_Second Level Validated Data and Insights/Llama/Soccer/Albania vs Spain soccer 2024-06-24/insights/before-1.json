        "Spain manager Luis de la Fuente is set to make an abundance of changes to his starting XI for Monday's Euro 2024 Group B clash with Albania in Dusseldorf.",
        "Rodri will serve a one-game ban on account of picking up two yellow cards in two matches, while Nacho (muscle) and Ayoze Perez (hamstring) should be spared as well.",
        "Nacho's injury means that there may be no respite for Aymeric Laporte, but he is the only man who should start a third game in a row for La Roja, likely alongside Dani Vivian in defence as Robin Le Normand is a booking away from a ban.",
        "The pair may very well be protecting Brentford's Arsenal loanee David Raya as Unai Simon enjoys a rest, while Alejandro Grimaldo and 38-year-old Jesus Navas should be deployed in the full-back areas.",
        "Martin Zubimendi is in line to step in for Rodri, while his Real Sociedad teammate Mikel Merino and Villarreal's Alex Baena could complete a three-man engine room behind a new-look attack.",
        "Ferran Torres and Mikel Oyarzabal are set to be deployed on the wings; the latter has found success in a central role recently, but he may be pushed out to the left to allow Joselu entry into the XI."
