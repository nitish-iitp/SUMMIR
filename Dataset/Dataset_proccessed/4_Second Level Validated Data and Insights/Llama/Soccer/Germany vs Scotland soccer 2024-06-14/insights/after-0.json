        "Steve Clarke was understandably subdued after the game",

        "Julian Nagelsmann was keen to stress the value of his team, rather than individuals like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The new UEFA initiative made it a bookable offence for players to approach referees to prevent them from being “mobbed”, with any player showing any sign of disrespect or dissent being shown a yellow card",
        "The game was marked by a welcome calmness from the players when a contentious decision did arise"
