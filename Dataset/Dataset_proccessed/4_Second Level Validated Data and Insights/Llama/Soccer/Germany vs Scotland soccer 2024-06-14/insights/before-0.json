We're proud we've been able to do back-to-back tournaments and hopefully by the end of this we'll be even more proud at having done something a bit more special.'",

I think the Tartan Army will be very excited, they're travelling in their numbers and I hope we can put in a performance they can be proud of and celebrate as well.'"
