Latvia vs Faroe Islands Betting Odds, Tips, Predictions, Preview 10th September 2024

Latvia take on Faroe Islands at Skonto Stadium, where an exciting match should be on the cards on Tuesday. It is one of the many matches in round two of the group stages of the UEFA Nations League this season. The last time these two teams faced off against each other, Latvia came away as 1-0 winners. No doubt they are planning a similar outcome on Tuesday.

Latvia sit at number 137 in the FIFA world ranking, while Faroe Islands enter their match on Tuesday as number 138.

After the opening round of the group matches Latvia are number four on zero, while Faroe Islands have one as number three. Imagine coming into the UEFA Nations League hoping to cause some trouble and then getting totally hammered in the opening round. Latvia were left bleeding and question is whether they've licked their wounds.

Latvia go into their next UEFA Nations League match, scoring a humble average of one per game in their last one matches. They scored a mundane one times, while conceding four. That amounts to an average of four per game, where they kept their opponents from scoring zero times.

It was a nice and quiet opening to the UEFA Nations League group stages Faroe Islands delivered. A 1-1 draw at home is perhaps slightly under par but still enough to try to build on.

Faroe Islands managed a bearable eight goals from their past seven games, creating an average of 1.1 goals per game. They conceded 11 goals in total, and while claiming zero clean sheets, they conceded 1.4 goals an average per game.

Latvia vs Faroe Islands Prediction
Latvia Form

In the previous three games, Latvia drew 1-1 with Cyprus, lost 1-1 against Liechtenstein and 4-1 against Armenia. Latvia just have a single win to show from their efforts in the past six internationals. They also drew two and lost three of these six encounters, in which they scored four and conceded ten goals.

Faroe Islands Form

Faroe Islands achieved a win, a loss and a draw in their previous three matches, starting off beating Liechtenstein 4-0. A 2-0 defeat against Denmark followed, before drawing with North Macedonia in a match resulting 1-1. Faroe Islands managed to win just once in their past six internationals. They also drew two and lost three, while scoring eight time and letting in six.

We've thought long and hard which bet offers the best price at the bookies, as the match against Faroe Islands could turn out a bit slippery for Latvia. Considering form and strength in squad, we nevertheless ended up siding with the latter on Tuesday.

Latvia vs Faroe Islands Betting Tips

Looking at the market for a goalscorer, it seems a good idea to side with Andrejs Ciganiks, who is performing well for Latvia.

The visitors will be looking up to Paetur Petersen to find the net once again, after managing two goals for Faroe Islands in his last six matches.
