        "Super Eagles will go head-to-head with the Beninoise coached by the same man Nigeria fired from the senior national team job after leading the country to a third place finish at the AFCON 2019 in Egypt and a first round exit at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.",
        "The draw against South Africa last Friday in Uyo means that Lesotho, who defeated Zimbabwe 2-0 earlier same day, remain top of their Group C standings"

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "We’re very much aware of why we are here (in Abidjan) and what we have to do. The players want to go to the World Cup and they have resolved to give their all in every game going forward.",
        "We have resolved not to look too far ahead in this race. The essence is to take it one match at a time. Benin Republic is in our front now, and we must deal with that squarely,"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Super Eagles have fared badly unable to win a single match out of three. It is the first time such is happening to the team since 1960!",
        "Eagles will not be strangers to the turf of the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Abidjan. It was at that venue they chalked up all three matches they played there during AFCON early in the year."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Coach Finidi George and his Super Eagles have no choice but get a win today against the Cheetahs if they want to remain in contention for the top prize.",
        "Should Finidi repeat his strange template of playing Bright Osayi-Samuel in unfamiliar left back and moving Benjamin Tanimu to inappropriate right side of the defence and also moving Kelechi Iheanacho to right wing, it will not be surprise for the Cheetahs to have Eagles for supper."
