England stunned by Iceland in Euro 2024 sendoff
ByESPN News Services

England were booed off by some of their own fans after losing 1-0 to Iceland at Wembley on Friday in their last friendly before Euro 2024.

Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson left defender John Stones standing as he scored for Iceland in the 16th minute to bring back memories of one of England's lowest points of recent years, their 2-1 elimination by Iceland at Euro 2016.

The hosts spurned several opportunities to equalise, with Anthony Gordon slicing his shot well over the bar when in a similar position to Thorsteinsson two minutes after the goal.

England captain Harry Kane missed a golden chance in the 28th minute when he shinned Cole Palmer's cross over from six yards out.

But Iceland, who did not qualify for the Euros having been beaten by Ukraine in their playoff final in March, finished the stronger side and were good value for the win.

 They should have doubled their lead in the 63rd minute but Thorsteinsson sliced horribly wide, with Ramsdale also forced to save a Sverrir Ingason header and Kolbeinn Finnsson's audacious volley from the edge of the box.

England pressed for a late equaliser but created few real chances and looked flat in their final game before the Euros in Germany, where they face Serbia in their opening Group C match in Gelsenkirchen next Sunday.

England will also have concerns over the fitness of centre-back Stones, who was replaced at half-time after appearing to roll his ankle in the first minute, though manager Gareth Southgate later played down the severity of the injury.

"We think he's probably OK but we didn't want to take a chance with that given what's coming up," Southgate told Channel 4.

Information from Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
