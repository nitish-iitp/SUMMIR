        "Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson scored the only goal of the game, cutting in off the left and firing a shot through John Stones' legs, beyond the unsighted Aaron Ramsdale and inside the near post."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Gareth Southgate's starting lineup for the opening group game against Serbia seems written in stone, fitness permitting, except for one position — the third midfield spot."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Gareth Southgate said, 'We learned a lot. We know the performance wasn’t good enough. Equally, so many of the players needed the game. A lot of players… we’re managing their minutes.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "England have set a lot of records under Southgate, but this is one to which they would not want to lay claim: going 1-0 down in three consecutive Wembley games for the first time since November 1954."

    "Others": [
        "Kobbie Mainoo combined well with Declan Rice tonight and there seemed to be decent communication between the two. He even encouraged Rice, by far the more experienced player, to throw off his defensive shackles at one stage in the first half."
