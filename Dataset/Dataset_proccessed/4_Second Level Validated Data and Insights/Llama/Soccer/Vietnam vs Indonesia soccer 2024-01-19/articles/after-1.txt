The Indonesia - Vietnam game saw matching levels to a large extent, but the Indonesian team succeeded in transforming penalty kick that was awarded to them after a mistake by the Vietnamese defense against the player Rafael Struijk.

At the beginning of the second half, Vietnam put strong pressure in an attempt to come back in the match, and the player, Bui Hoang Viet Anh, almost scored a goal from a cross ball that he headed towards the Indonesian goal, but it passed next to the right post.

In the second Half, Vietnam defender, Le Pham Thanh Long received a second yellow card followed by a red card.

With only 10 players on the field, Vietnam pushed hard in the last minutes, trying to equalize, but Indonesia's goalkeeper, Hernando Arri, excelled defending his goal, ending up named Player of the Match.
