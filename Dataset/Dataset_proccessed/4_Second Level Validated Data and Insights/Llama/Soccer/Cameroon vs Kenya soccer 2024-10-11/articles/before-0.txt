Harambee Stars head coach, Engin Firat, has announced his final 24-man squad for the two upcoming 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Cameroon. These matches, scheduled for October 11 and 14, are crucial as Kenya aims to secure a spot in the prestigious continental tournament.

Kenya will first face the Indomitable Lions at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Omnisports Stadium in Yaoundé on Friday, October 11, 2024, before hosting the return leg at Uganda’s Mandela National Stadium three days later. The Harambee Stars are forced to play their home matches in Kampala due to a lack of FIFA and CAF-approved stadiums in Kenya that meet international standards.

Both teams are tied at the top of their qualifying group with four points each, making this a high-stakes battle for AFCON qualification. Zimbabwe follows closely with two points, while Namibia has yet to secure a point. The top two teams from the group will earn a place in the tournament, set to be held in Morocco from December 2025 to January 2026.

Speaking during a press conference at Police Sacco Stadium in Nairobi, Firat expressed confidence in his squad's ability to compete with Cameroon. "I don’t believe it will be easy for Cameroon, even if they have all their players available. This time, I’m happy that we only have a few players missing,” Firat said, adding, “We are ready, and I expect the team to give a good account of themselves."

Despite some notable absentees, including Gor Mahia's Austine Odhiambo, Ulinzi Stars’ Boniface Muchiri, and AFC Leopards’ Sydney Lokale, Firat has brought back key players like Alfred Scriven, who returns to the national team after a long absence. The squad also features Adam Wilson, who earned his first call-up earlier this year. The core of the team remains unchanged, with many of the players who were instrumental in the 2-1 victory over Namibia and the 0-0 draw against Zimbabwe retaining their places.

Kenya's strong start in the qualifiers has boosted hopes of returning to the AFCON after missing out on the 2023 edition. However, history paints a daunting picture for the Harambee Stars. Cameroon has never lost to Kenya in their eight previous meetings, winning four and drawing the other four. Their last encounter was in 2010 when Cameroon triumphed 3-1 in a friendly match. Kenya has managed just one draw in their last three AFCON qualifiers against the Indomitable Lions.

Cameroon, a five-time AFCON champion, boasts a talented squad but has been inconsistent in recent performances, with just two wins in their last five matches. Their AFCON 2023 campaign ended in the Round of 16 after a 2-0 defeat to Nigeria. Since then, Cameroon has recorded mixed results, including a 4-1 win over Cape Verde, a 1-1 draw with Angola, and a narrow 1-0 victory against Namibia.

The Harambee Stars departed Nairobi on Thursday morning and are set to hold a training session at the Omnisports Stadium in Yaoundé in preparation for the crucial clash. Firat remains optimistic about his team’s chances, but Kenya will have to defy both history and the form book to claim a positive result against the Indomitable Lions.

Goalkeepers: Ian Otieno, Patrick Matasi, Byrne Omondi

Defenders: Alphonce Omija, Daniel Anyembe, Amos Nondi, Sylvester Owino, Johnstone Omurwa, Collins Sichenje, Joseph Okumu, Geoffrey Ochieng, Eric Ouma
