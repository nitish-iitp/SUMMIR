Spain vs Germany: Euro 2024 Quarterfinal Prediction Match Details

On Friday, two heavy favorites, Spain and the host nation, Germany, are set to clash in the Euro 2024 quarterfinals at the MHPArena in Stuttgart. Both teams are vying for a spot in the semifinals.

Spain Preview & Form

Spain has arguably been the standout team since the start of the tournament, topping Group B with a perfect record of nine points. They are the only team to reach the round of 16 without conceding a goal. In the round of 16, La Roja came from behind to secure a 4-1 victory over Georgia and advance to the quarterfinals. It’s important to note that the trio of Lamine Yamal, Alvaro Morata, and Nico Williams has looked threatening in the tournament and will be crucial in breaking the German defense. The three-time champions have scored a total of nine goals since the start of the tournament.

Germany Preview & Form

Germany began Euro 2024 as one of the top favorites to win the tournament. However, they have slipped to being the fourth favorite, behind England, Spain, and France, according to bookies. Die Mannschaft finished at the top of Group A with seven points and continued their impressive run by defeating Denmark 2-0 in the round of 16, securing their place in the last eight. Notably, Germany has been exceptional in front of goal, having scored a total of ten goals in the tournament so far. Players like Jamal Musiala, Kai Havertz, and Florian Wirtz are in contention for the Golden Boot.
