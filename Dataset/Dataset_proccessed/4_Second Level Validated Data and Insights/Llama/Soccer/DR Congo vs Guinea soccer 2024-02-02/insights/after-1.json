        "DR Congo will play in their first quarter-final at the Africa Cup of Nations since 2017 (lost 2-1 to Ghana), while they last reached the first semi-finals in 2015 (won 4-2 vs Congo in the quarter-finals, lost 3-1 to Ivory Coast in the semi-finals).",
        "Three of DR Congo’s last four knockout games at the Africa Cup of Nations have been decided by penalties, with the Leopards winning two (against Egypt in the last round and against Equatorial Guinea in the third-place match in 2015) and losing one (against Madagascar in the last 16 in 2019).",
