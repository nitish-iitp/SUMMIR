The Democratic Republic of Congo’s bid for the first Africa Cup of Nations in 50 years was boosted on Monday morning when they defeated seven-time champion Egypt, who were without their star Mohamed Salah, in a dramatic penalty shootout following a 1-1 tightly contested round of 16 match in San Pedro.

The Leopards, who last won the AFCON in 1974, took the lead in the 37th minute when Meschak Elia capitalized on Yoane Wissa’s deflected cross.

However, the two-time African champions’ lead did not last long, as Egypt equalized in the first minute of additional time before the break following a VAR review, which resulted in a penalty being awarded to the Pharoas.

Congo’s Dylan Batubinsika was judged to have dangled his arm on Hegazy, and Mostafa Mohamed brilliantly converted the penalty to tie the game.

Both teams created a few chances in the second half but could not find the winner, forcing the match into extra time and, subsequently, a penalty shootout.

Mostafa Mohamed and Arthur Masuaku exchanged misses before both teams scored six consecutive penalty kicks.

Egypt’s keeper Gabaski then struck against the crossbar for the Pharaohs, resulting in Mpasi Nzau becoming a hero by sending his fellow shot-stopper the wrong way with a clinical finish to win it for Congo.

The North Africans, who were the runners-up in the previous edition in Cameroon, have been eliminated from the tournament at the round of 16 stage for the second time in three tournaments.

The Leopards are through to the quarterfinals and will face Guinea on February 2, 2024.
