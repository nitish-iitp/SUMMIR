Germany vs Hungary Prediction & Betting tips

On Saturday at 19:45, Germany and Hungary face each other in the first match of the UEFA Nations League in League A, Group 3, where the Netherlands and Bosnia & Herzegovina are also located. The two national teams were in the same group in the previous edition, 2022-2023, and then Hungary managed to finish unbeaten in the two games in which it recorded a 1-0 victory in the return leg and a result of tie, score 1-1 in the round match. However, the most recent direct confrontation took place this year at Euro 2024, where Germany won 2-0 and won group A, while Hungary was in 3rd place.

Germany:

Germany was the host of this summer’s final tournament, Euro 2024 and was among the national favorites to win the trophy, but it also had to admit that it was defeated by Spain in the quarter-finals, 2-1 after extra time, after at the end of the 90 minutes, the score was equal, 1-1. Germany has never won the UEFA Nations League trophy and had quite poor performances in this competition organized by UEFA to replace friendly matches. In the second edition, Germany was close to the semi-finals, but in the last match in the group it suffered one of the heaviest defeats, 6-0 away to Spain. It remains to be seen if this time, at the 4th edition, Germany will succeed in qualifying for the knockout stages.

Hungary:

Hungary plays for the second time in a row in League A of the UEFA Nations League, after being promoted consecutively from League C to League B and from League B to League A. In the previous edition, Hungary left a very good impression, managing to finish on 2nd place in a group with Italy, the winner of the group, Germany, occupying the 3rd place and England, the team in 4th place, which was relegated to the premiere in League B. Hungary registered a double victory with England, 1-0 at home and a surprise 4-0 away and a very surprising victory too, 1-0 away against Germany. This summer, Hungary also participated in Euro 2024, where it took 3rd place but failed to qualify for the round of 16 due to the very low goal difference.
