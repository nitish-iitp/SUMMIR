The Gibraltarians suffered a 2-1 loss to Jersey, but they did well to hold Slovakia to a goalless draw in their first official international match. Gibraltar participated in the 2016 World Cup qualifiers and they were drawn in Group D alongside Germany, Poland, Georgia, Republic of Ireland and Scotland."
