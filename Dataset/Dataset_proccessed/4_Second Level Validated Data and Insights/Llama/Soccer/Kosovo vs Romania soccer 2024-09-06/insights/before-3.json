    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Kosovo welcome Romania to Pristina on Friday in one of the standout fixtures in League C of the UEFA Nations League this week.",
        "This will be a first competitive fixture in charge for Kosovo boss Franco Foda, who signed up in February, and it will be against the toughest opponents in their section.",
        "Kosovo have the ability to succeed with so many players in Europe's top-five leagues, but inconsistency has held them back ever since becoming a UEFA member.",
        "Romania are unlikely to find it easy in Pristina though, as their 0-0 draw here during Euro 2024 qualifying was part of an ongoing run which has seen Kosovo lose just one of their last nine home games.",
        "Legendary manager Mircea Lucescu, known for revolutionising Shakhtar Donetsk in a 12-year spell, is back at the helm 43 years after first taking charge between 1981 and 1986, replacing Edward Iordanescu, who led the Tricolorii in Germany over the summer.",
        "Kosovo pair Mirlind Kryeziu and Bernard Berisha have both pulled out of the squad late with injury, while Elbasan Rashani is not fit enough for a call up having not yet featured for Elche after his summer switch from Clermont.",
        "Romania goalkeeper Horatiu Moldovan has pulled out of the squad, meaning 37-year-old Florin Nita is set to start between the sticks, as he did during the Euros.",
        "Mihai Lixandru was set to make his international bow, but an unfortunately-timed injury means the FCSB midfielder has had to withdraw.",
        "From the squad selected for the Euros, Alexandru Cicaldau, Ionut Nedelcearu and Bogdan Racovitan have all lost their places under new manager Lucescu for the time being.",
        "Defence was the strong point under Iordanescu, and Lucescu will hope that continues, so he will have been glad to see Radu Dragusin get some much-needed game time for Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, filling in for the absent Micky van de Ven.",
        "Kosovo possible starting lineup: Muric; Rrahmani, Aliti, Paqarada; Hadergjonaj, V Berisha, Rexhbecaj, Vojvoda; Zhegrova, Muriqi, Rashica",
        "Romania possible starting lineup: Nita; Ratiu, Dragusin, Burca, Bancu; R Marin, M Marin, Stanciu; Man, Dragus, Mihaila"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Kosovo boss Franco Foda will be hoping he can take Kosovo into League B for the first time, as previous draws have not been kind to the Balkan side.",
        "Legendary manager Mircea Lucescu, known for revolutionising Shakhtar Donetsk in a 12-year spell, is back at the helm 43 years after first taking charge between 1981 and 1986, replacing Edward Iordanescu, who led the Tricolorii in Germany over the summer.",

    "Others": [
        "We say: Kosovo 0-0 Romania",
        "With new eras for both nations under managers taking charge of their first competitive matches, this is a tough one to call, especially given Kosovo's strong home form.",
        "These two played out a goalless draw here last year, and another could be likely considering just one of Kosovo's last eight games, and only four of Romania's previous 13, have seen both teams score."
