Bulgaria vs Northern Ireland predictions

Bulgaria got their Nations League campaign off to a solid start by securing a 0-0 away draw (at a neutral venue) with Belarus.

Ranked at 88 in the world by FIFA, Bulgaria have bottomed out in recent years and are trying to slowly rebuild. 

In a third tier Nations League group that includes Belarus, Northern Ireland and Luxembourg, the Lions will see this as an opportunity to continue their rebuilding with promotion to the second tier. 

Tasked with getting Bulgaria into League B of the Nations League is head coach Ilian Iliev Snr. 

Iliev has overseen a run of seven matches without defeat since he took over from Mladen Krstajic, who was sacked in October 2023.

But despite being seven matches unbeaten, the Lions only have one win to point to.

That was in a friendly against Tanzania in March. The 1-0 win ended an eleven match winless run dating all the way back to November 2022. 

Furthermore, Bulgaria finished bottom of their Euro 2024 qualifying group with no wins from their eight fixtures. The Lions could only manage four draws and four defeats in a group that included Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro and Lithuania.

The job facing Ilian Iliev is huge. But he will believe his team can get their second win under his leadership when they face the Irish on Sunday.

Northern Ireland will also be looking at this fixture as a winnable one.

The Irish got their Nations League campaign off to a winning start with a 2-0 victory over Luxembourg at Windsor Park on Thursday.

Early goals from Paddy NcNair and Daniel Ballard sealed the victory which saw the Irish go top of League 3 Group C. 

Like Bulgaria, Northern Ireland is in a rebuilding process. But with Michael O’Neill re-appointed in December 2022, the Irish are ahead of their rivals as they plot a return to the second tier of the Nations League. 

Under O’Neill, Ireland has won six from 15. The emergence of youngsters like Liverpool right-back Conor Bradley has greatly helped O’Neill, with the 21-year-old bringing youth and positivity into what was an ageing squad that was on its last legs. 

The retirement of Jonny Evans from international duty, along with the loss of the experienced duo of Steven Davis and Stuart Dallas will have hurt Northern Ireland. But on a positive note, it has brought the average age of the squad down and added to the freshness.

And a fresh injection of youth is just what is needed. Northern Ireland is ranked 74th by FIFA. They have won just two games out of 17 in the Nations League, the second being against Luxembourg on Thursday. 

A significant improvement is needed. Beating Bulgaria on the road would be a great way to start. But it will be very difficult for Michael O’Neill’s team.

Bulgaria vs Northern Ireland betting tips

Both nations will see this as a winnable match. Home advantage could be the telling factor, and we feel that will be the difference between the two nations.

Bulgaria to win - 6/4 (SBK)

Both Bulgaria and Northern Ireland have struggled in recent times. 

The two teams might be more happy to not lose, especially Northern Ireland, given they have a young squad, and are also the team on the road. 

Bulgaria has five draws in their last six matches. 

Ireland has recorded three wins in their last four. Two were at home, with one on the road against Scotland.

The other result was a 5-1 loss away to Spain. We can forgive them for that result. 

Home advantage will be the key factor in this match. Bulgaria has been regrouping. They had the majority of the possession (59%) against Belarus on Thursday, while Northern Ireland had just 36% at home to Luxembourg.

That’s not a great stat for the Irish. And that lack of possession will hurt them in the long run if it continues. 

Bulgaria looks a good bet to win at 6/4.

Under 2.5 goals - 8/15 (SBK)

If both teams are playing cautious football with the onus on not losing, it stands to reason there is likely to be a shortage of goals.

There have been under 2.5 goals in Bulgaria’s last five matches. And there have been under 2.5 goals in four of Northern Ireland’s last five fixtures. 

Ireland are top of the group. They know that a point on the road is a good result, so despite their run of results, we can see them keeping things tight and settling for the point. 

Bulgaria are goal shy. We see them winning. But if they do, it will be a tight 1-0 or 2-0 victory. 

⚽ Back under 2.5 goals at 8/15 with SBK ⚽

Kiril Despodov to score any time - 21/10 (SBK)

The last time Bulgaria scored, it was a penalty scored by Kiril Despodov in their 1-1 draw away to Slovenia in June. 

The winger slotted home from the spot to give his nation the lead. Unfortunately for the Lions, they couldn’t hold onto the advantage and had to settle for a share of the spoils..

Against Northern Ireland things will be tight. Set pieces could be the difference. As could counter attacks on the transition, which could play into the hands of the PAOK winger who was also his nation’s scorer in the recent 1-0 win against Tanzania. 

⚽ Tip Kiril Despodov to score any time at 21/10 with SBK ⚽
