        "The responsibility lies with us. The opportunities to counter weren’t there, so we have to improvise.",
        "Tonight was a tough test, a difficult place to come and the second game in three days so as much as I’m disappointed to lose the game, there’s a lot to take from the game."

        "I haven’t seen the goal back in any detail but Bailey knows himself it was the wrong decision and ultimately that was the deciding factor in the game."
