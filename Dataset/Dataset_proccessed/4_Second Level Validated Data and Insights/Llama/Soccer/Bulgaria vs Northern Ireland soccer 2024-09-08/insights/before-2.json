        "Bulgaria to win - 6/4 (SBK)",
        "Under 2.5 goals - 8/15 (SBK)",
        "Kiril Despodov to score any time - 21/10 (SBK)",
        "Bulgaria has been regrouping. They had the majority of the possession (59%) against Belarus on Thursday, while Northern Ireland had just 36% at home to Luxembourg.",
        "Bulgaria looks a good bet to win at 6/4.",
        "If both teams are playing cautious football with the onus on not losing, it stands to reason there is likely to be a shortage of goals.",
        "Bulgaria are goal shy. We see them winning. But if they do, it will be a tight 1-0 or 2-0 victory.",
        "The last time Bulgaria scored, it was a penalty scored by Kiril Despodov in their 1-1 draw away to Slovenia in June.",
        "Set pieces could be the difference. As could counter attacks on the transition, which could play into the hands of the PAOK winger who was also his nation’s scorer in the recent 1-0 win against Tanzania."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Bulgaria vs Northern Ireland will see this as a winnable match. Home advantage could be the telling factor, and we feel that will be the difference between the two nations.",
        "Northern Ireland will also be looking at this fixture as a winnable one.",
        "Like Bulgaria, Northern Ireland is in a rebuilding process. But with Michael O’Neill re-appointed in December 2022, the Irish are ahead of their rivals as they plot a return to the second tier of the Nations League.",
        "A fresh injection of youth is just what is needed. Northern Ireland is ranked 74th by FIFA. They have won just two games out of 17 in the Nations League, the second being against Luxembourg on Thursday.",
        "Bulgaria finished bottom of their Euro 2024 qualifying group with no wins from their eight fixtures. The Lions could only manage four draws and four defeats in a group that included Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro and Lithuania.",
        "The job facing Ilian Iliev is huge. But he will believe his team can get their second win under his leadership when they face the Irish on Sunday.",
        "The Irish got their Nations League campaign off to a winning start with a 2-0 victory over Luxembourg at Windsor Park on Thursday.",
        "Early goals from Paddy NcNair and Daniel Ballard sealed the victory which saw the Irish go top of League 3 Group C.",
        "Under O’Neill, Ireland has won six from 15. The emergence of youngsters like Liverpool right-back Conor Bradley has greatly helped O’Neill, with the 21-year-old bringing youth and positivity into what was an ageing squad that was on its last legs.",
        "The retirement of Jonny Evans from international duty, along with the loss of the experienced duo of Steven Davis and Stuart Dallas will have hurt Northern Ireland. But on a positive note, it has brought the average age of the squad down and added to the freshness."
