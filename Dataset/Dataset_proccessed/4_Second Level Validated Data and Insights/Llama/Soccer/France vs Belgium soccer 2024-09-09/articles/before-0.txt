Belgium lineup vs. France: Predicted XI for UEFA Nations League fixture

Aiming for back-to-back wins from their opening double-header in the UEFA Nations League, Belgium will visit old foes France on Monday.

The Belgians claimed maximum points in their 'home' game against Israel - played in Hungary for security reasons - as head coach Domenico Tedesco named a side without two of the nation's biggest stars.

Not only is Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois still missing due to a longstanding rift with Tedesco, but record goalscorer Romelu Lukaku is also unavailable this month after a summer of transfer turmoil impacted his fitness.

Nonetheless, captain Kevin De Bruyne will be present in Lyon, having scored twice on Friday and then turned down the chance to complete his hat-trick with a penalty, which RB Leipzig's Lois Openda ultimately took and missed.

De Bruyne and Manchester City teammate Jeremy Doku will again support the central striker, while it seems to be a straight fight between Dodi Lukebakio and Johan Bakayoko to feature on the right flank; Arsenal's Leandro Trossard was not called up.

As Lukaku watches on from his new home in Naples - and Michy Batshuayi was not selected - Openda's place up front seems certain, and an all-Aston Villa midfield of Andre Onana and Youri Tielemans should be retained too.

Tedesco offered several youngsters a chance to shine in the Red Devils' opener, and Maxim De Cuyper could again start at left-back, with Arne Engels, Zeno Debast and talented teenager Julien Duranville all contenders to make another appearance from the bench.
