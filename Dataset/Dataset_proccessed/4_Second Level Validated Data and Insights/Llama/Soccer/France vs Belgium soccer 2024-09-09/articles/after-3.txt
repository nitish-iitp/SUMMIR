Belgium lose against France in the Nations League: harsh words from De Bruyne after the game

After their 3:1 win against Israel on Friday, Belgium’s national men’s football team the Red Devils failed to beat France in Lyon on Monday evening. Despite a good opening phase, Belgium lost 2-0. After the game, the national captain Kevin De Bruyne was unable to conceal his anger.

Belgium started strongly, but the French quickly rallied and put up quite a fight. The French played much better than Belgium, especially in the second half and their 2:0 victory with goals from Kolo Muani and Dembélé was a well-deserved.

After the game, the national team captain Kevin De Bruyne gave an interview to the commercial broadcaster VTM in which he was highly critical on the team’s performance. He pointed to a lack of commitment on the part of some of his team-mates. He went on to say that while he could not blame some of his team-mates for still having to gain experience at this level, without naming names, he found it regrettable that some Red Devils were not really committed to the team.

Amadou Onana agreed with De Bruyne “It can happen that you play a bad game, but motivation must never be lacking.”

So, is there a crisis within our national football team? Monday evening’s match showed that there is tension between some members of the squad. The question is whether Domenico Tedesco and his coaching staff will be able to resolve this before the Belgium’s next Nation’s League game against Italy in Rome on 10 October.
