        "Craig Goodwin is looking to continue his strong club form for the Socceroos as he prepares to don the Green and Gold in his beloved Adelaide under new boss Tony Popovic.",
        "Goodwin will be keen to impress Popovic in front of his friends, family and fans at Adelaide Oval, and is in a good position to do so after a strong start to his Saudi Pro League season for Al-Wehda, in which he has registered two goals and one assist in six appearances.",
        "The Socceroos will be looking to respond to the first two matches with a strong performance against China PR on Thursday night, with Goodwin resting importance on Australia remaining focused on their own game in what is shaping to be an enthralling encounter.",
        "I think it’ll be a different kind of game against China to the first two games we played against Bahrain and Indonesia,” he said. “I think China’s going to come out and try and play a little bit more, or be a little bit more aggressive in that way."
