Football Australia Media
Updated: 05:01am Oct 6, 2024
Subway Socceroos’ Head Coach, Tony Popovic has been forced to make two changes to his extended 26-man squad ahead of Australia’s AFC Asian Qualifiers™ – Road to 26 fixtures against China PR and Japan.
The referenced media source is missing and needs to be re-embedded.


Massimo Luongo (Ipswich Town FC) has been ruled out due to an ankle injury, while Connor Metcalfe (FC St Pauli) has sustained a leg injury.

The Subway Socceroos’ medical team were advised of Luongo and Metcalfe’s respective injuries following the official squad announcement on Friday, 4 October and will continue to work with Ipswich Town FC and FC St Pauli on rehabilitation plans and return to play timelines for both players following more detailed assessment.

Luke Brattan (Macarthur FC) and Patrick Yazbek (Nashville SC) have been called in to replace the injured Luongo and Metcalfe.

Yazbek earns a recall for the first time since making his international debut against Lebanon in March 2024, while Brattan joins the Subway Socceroos’ squad for the first time since 2018.

Australia will take on China PR at Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on Thursday, 10 October (kick-off 7:30pm local/8pm AEDT) and Japan at Saitama Stadium 2002, Tokyo on Tuesday, 15 October (7.35pm local/9.35pm AEDT).
