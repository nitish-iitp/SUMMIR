        "Ghana created a whole host of chances on a poor playing surface in Accra but a lack of cutting edge in front of goal meant they remained winless at the halfway point of the qualifying campaign.",
        "Alexander Djiku hit the crossbar with a header from Mohammed Kudus's cross on five minutes.",
        "Ernest Nuamah then lashed a shot just wide just of goal in the 11th minute following an exquisite pass from Kudus before Antoine Semenyo tested Mohamed Al Mustafa after bursting into the box on 17 minutes.",
        "Semenyo struggled to bring the ball under control from Alidu Seidu's cross on the right in the 56th minute, allowing the goalkeeper to clear his lines and Kudus drew a smart save from Al Mustafa moments later after latching onto a rebound.",
        "Sudan's best opportunity came on 72 minutes when they won a free-kick in a central position 30 yards out and Lawrence Ati-Zigi took no chances as he tipped a curling shot behind that might have been going over the bar, while Mustafa Karshoum sent a firm header narrowly wide of the right post from the resulting corner.",
        "Inaki Williams fired a shot across the face of goal from an acute angle on the right in the 85th minute after being released into the box and Kudus somehow failed to turn the ball home from a yard out on 88 minutes after Williams missed Seidu's cross.",
        "Williams squandered an even better chance in stoppage time after being picked out by Kudus inside the 18-yard area and Abdul Fatawu blazed over on the rebound following good work from the keeper."
