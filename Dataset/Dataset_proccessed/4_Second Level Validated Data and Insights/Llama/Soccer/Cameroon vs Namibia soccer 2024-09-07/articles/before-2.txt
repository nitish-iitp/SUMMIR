Boubou Traore and team has arrived in Garoua to officiate the upcoming match between Cameroon and Namibia on September 7, 2024
With a wealth of experience in CAF competitions, the 39-year-old and his fellow Malian counterparts are well-prepared to handle the high-stakes encounter

The Malian refereeing quartet tasked with officiating the highly anticipated match between Cameroon and Namibia has officially arrived in Garoua.

Led by central referee Boubou Traore, the team includes assistant referees Modibo Samake and Amadou Belly Guisse, as well as fourth official Sory Ibrahima. Their arrival on September 4, 2024, sets the stage for a thrilling encounter scheduled for September 7.

The referees are set to commence training on September 5, as they gear up to take charge of the game and familiarize themselves with the playing venue.

Traore’s wealth of experience in CAF competitions, including the Nigeria vs Algeria clash in 2023, makes him a seasoned pro on the field. With their proven track record in international fixtures, the refereeing team instills confidence in both teams as they prepare for this crucial clash.

Alongside the referees, a delegation from the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot) has also made the journey to Garoua to oversee match preparations.

Cameroon’s national team is expected to arrive in Garoua on Thursday, while Namibia is scheduled to land later that night.

The arrival of the Malian refereeing quartet and the accompanying FECAFOOT delegation underscores the significance of this match as both teams gear up for their first Group encounter. With the stakes high, the referees will play a pivotal role in ensuring a fair and well-managed game.
