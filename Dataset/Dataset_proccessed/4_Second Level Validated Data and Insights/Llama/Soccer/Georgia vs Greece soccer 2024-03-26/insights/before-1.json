        "Willy Sagnol's men booked their ticket to the showpiece with a 2-0 beating of 10-man Luxembourg in their semi-final showdown, while the Pirate Ship Crew hit Kazakhstan for five without reply.",
        "Georgia need only pick up one more victory to achieve that elusive feat and complete Euro 2024 Group F, where Portugal, Turkey and the Czech Republic will be waiting to welcome them.",
        "Georgia's visitors Greece need no lessons in attacking supremacy either, though, as Gus Poyet's men made light work of an ostensibly tricky semi-final with an in-form Kazakhstan side, thrashing their fellow Euro 2024 hopefuls 5-0 at the Agia Sophia Stadium.",
        "The head-to-head column makes for highly pleasant reading for the Greece faithful ahead of Tuesday's match, as the Pirate Ship Crew have avoided defeat in each of their first nine games with Georgia - winning seven of them - including a 2-0 success in Batumi during a 2022 World Cup qualifier.",
        "Georgia's return of a well-rested Kvaratskhelia represents potentially the biggest boost that Georgia could have wished for ahead of such a momentous occasion, where the formidable Tbilisi crowd should more than play their part in their team's endeavours.",
        "A clash between two prolific attacking units has the potential to be an incredible watch for the neutral, but given the manner of Greece's destructive performance against a hitherto impressive Kazakhstan outfit, Poyet's men have our vote to return to the biggest continental stage and extend Georgia's wait for a major tournament baptism."

        "Georgia's 3-1 defeat to La Roja in September represents the Crusaders' only reverse from their last five matches across all tournaments - a sequence which has also seen Sagnol's team find the back of the net at least twice in four of those fixtures - and not since June 2022 have they been shut out on familiar territory.",
        "Greece's four of those goals flew past the beleaguered Kazakhstan backline in the opening 40 minutes, where Anastasios Bakasetas, Dimitrios Pelkas, Fotis Ioannidis and Dimitrios Kourbelis killed the game off early doors before Erkin Tapalov's late own goal added insult to injury for the visitors.",
        "Greece's Poyet did not witness any of his troops sustain injuries or pick up milestone bookings in the thrashing of Kazakhstan, where centre-back Pantelis Hatzidiakos was taken off during the half-time interval."
