Ever since Gareth Bale quit football Wales have been looking for a hero and in Harry Wilson, they might just have found their man.

With his first-half penalty against Montenegro, Wilson became the first player since Bale at Euro 2016 to score in three consecutive games for Wales – but his display was about so much more than the goal.

Wilson was outstanding as boss Craig Bellamy extended his unbeaten run as Wales boss to four games. The Fulham man has barely played for his club this term yet here his technique and vision helped knit together a Wales side missing several key players. ‘When I watch him I’m thinking ‘Wow’ said Bellamy.

Bellamy already has an eye on next year’s World Cup qualifiers and developing a squad for those matches. ‘A squad really gives you a better chance of being able to qualify for a major tournament,’ he said. ‘It really suits the bigger nations with the bigger squads so we have to utilise our squad the best we can to reach a major tournament.’

Bellamy’s team wasted chances to improve their advantage and were nearly made to pay when Montenegro substitute Andrija Radulovic hit the woodwork. Yet without Brennan Johnson, Ethan Ampadu, Aaron Ramsey, Connor Roberts and Jordan James, this was a deserved victory, and means Wales will tackle their final two matches in their Nations League group with optimism.

The winger was brought down by Vladimir Jovovic and dusted himself off to slot home

They travel to group leaders Turkey and face Iceland at home next month. Bellamy will be thrilled that unlike in the previous two matches, Wales kept their defensive shape well and ran few risks.

MATCH FACTS

Wales (4-3-3): Darlow 6; Williams 7, Rodon 6, Cabango 6, B Davies 6.5; Wilson (Broadhead 69, 6), Sheehan 7, Cullen 7 (Cooper 89); Brooks 6.5 (Allen 59, 6), Harris 6 (Moore 89), Burns 5.5 (Thomas 69, 6)

Scorers: Wilson 36 (pen)

Manager: Craig Bellamy 7

Referee: Filip Glova 6

 

Despite making seven changes from the 2-2 draw in Iceland last Friday, Wales’ new-look team were fluent throughout the first half and could have led by more at the break.

Wes Burns headed Wilson’s cross wide from close range – a great shame as it would have concluded fine move that began with goalkeeper Karl Darlow.

Then Wilson’s rising effort was pushed away and a sliding Mark Harris narrowly failed to meet Neco Williams’ low cross.

Wilson was at the heart of every Wales attack. His lofted pass found Liam Cullen’s run from deep and though the Swansea man lifted the ball over Igor Nikic, his effort cleared the bar.

David Brooks’ strike from 30 yards was pushed wide yet from the corner, Wales won their spot-kick. Vladimir Jovovic misread Wilson’s turn and connected with him enough to persuade referee Filip Glova to point to the spot. After a long delay, Wilson sent Nikic the wrong way.

Wilson nearly had his second just before half-time, his strike from the edge of the box drifting just wide.

Montenegro boss Robert Prosinecki was so unhappy with his side’s first-half display that he made four substitutions and one of the new players nearly brought his side level 10 minutes after the break.

Andrija Radulovic saw a powerful effort crack off the woodwork with Karl Darlow helpless

Stevan Jovetic's poor free-kick, aimed at the top corner, was blazed high into the stand

Andrija Radulovic cut inside Ben Davies and unleashed a swerving 20-yard effort that beat Darlow but rebounded off the crossbar.

Wales might have made it two when Nikic found himself in a muddle and was robbed by Brooks, who chose to pass not shoot and Burns fired over on the angle.

That was Brooks’ last contribution and he was replaced by Joe Allen, who ended his international retirement to link up again with Wales for this double-header.

Moments later Burns outpaced Marko Vukcevic but could not pick out any of his three team-mates in the middle.
