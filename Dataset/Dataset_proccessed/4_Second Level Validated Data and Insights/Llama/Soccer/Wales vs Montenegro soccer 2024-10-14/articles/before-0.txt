Wales will be looking to complete the double over Montenegro in Monday's UEFA Nations League clash at the Cardiff City Stadium.

Craig Bellamy earned his first win as Dragons boss in last month's reverse fixture following a lightning start by his side.

Wales had failed to score in their previous four games, but raced into a two-goal lead within three minutes thanks to Kieffer Moore's strike and Harry Wilson's long-range screamer.

Bellamy's side were made to work for the three points in dreadful conditions as Montenegro's Driton Camaj hit a late consolation to set up a tense finale, but they held on and are in with a shot at promotion to League A at the halfway stage of this season's Nations League.

A second victory against Montenegro would boost Wales' hopes of topping Group B4, and Tottenham hotshot Brennan Johnson will be key if he can transfer his form at domestic level to the international scene.

RadioTimes.com has rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch Wales v Montenegro on TV and online.
