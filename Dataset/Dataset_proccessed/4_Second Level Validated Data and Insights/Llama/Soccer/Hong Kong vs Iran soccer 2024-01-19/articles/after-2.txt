How to watch the AFC Asian Cup match between Hong Kong and Iran, as well as kick-off time and team news.

AFC Asian Cup favourites Iran will be looking to build on their triumphant opening-day victory and book a place in the knockout stages when they take on Hong Kong at the Khalifa International Stadium on Friday.

Hong Kong entered into this tournament as one of the weakest teams and while they started their campaign on Sunday with a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Group C rivals the United Arab Emirates, they put plenty on show to suggest they aren't just there to make up the numbers in what was their first Asian Cup finals game since 1968.

They now face a much-superior Iranian side that entered into the competition as one of the major favourites to go the whole hog and they began their group stage campaign with an impressive 4-1 demolition job of Palestine last Sunday.

Here GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch, including TV channel, streaming details and more.
