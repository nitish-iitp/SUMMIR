        "Cape Verde are considered firm favourites for this one by the Opta supercomputer as they won 56.3% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations in 90 minutes. Mauritania were only victorious in 22.1% of those.",
        "That means 21.6% of the time this game went to extra time and potentially penalties; taking those possibilities into account, the supercomputer gives Cape Verde a 62.8% likelihood of getting through to the quarter-finals (at the time of writing),"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Mauritania will play their first ever AFCON knockout match in this game.",
        "Cape Verde topped a Group B that also contained record champions Egypt, Ghana and Mozambique. They didn’t lose once, rescuing a 2-2 draw in the ninth minute of stoppage time against the Pharaohs on Matchday 3 after beating the Black Stars 2-1 – also courtesy of a dramatic late goal – and the Mambas 3-0.",
        "Mauritania’s Aboubakary Koïta completed the most take-ons of any player in the group stage (11) and also attempted the most shots following a take-on (4).",
        "Mauritania’s route through the group stage was a little more fortunate than their next opponents’. Defeats to Angola and Burkina Faso in their first two games gave them the unenviable task of trying to get a result against a talented Algeria side; they managed it and those three points were just enough to take them through as one of the four best third-place teams."

    "Others": [
        "Both Cape Verde and Mauritania were given less than a 1.0% chance of winning the whole thing before the tournament started.",
        "Cape Verde have only featured in two Africa Cup of Nations knockout matches – they lost both games 2-0, to Ghana in the 2013 quarter-final and Senegal in the 2021 last 16.",
        "Mauritania have reached the knockouts despite losing their first two group games, winning on MD 3 against Algeria and qualifying as one of the best third-placed ranked teams. They are only the third team to reach the knockouts despite losing their first two group games, along with DR Congo in 2019 and Comoros in 2021."
