The Gunners centre-back took his club form onto the international stage as the sloppy visitors recovered to climb the World Cup qualification table

Brazil defeated Chile 2-1 on Thursday as an 89th-minute winner sealed all three points and moved the Selecao up to fourth in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying table, leapfrogging both Ecuador and Bolivia in the process.

The three points will come as a welcome relief to head coach Dorival Junior but it was a poor showing from Brazil, who began the match flat-footed and conceded after just two minutes - a sensational headed effort from veteran attacker Eduardo Vargas looping over Ederson and into the net.

However, just before the half-time break, Selecao striker Igor Jesus headed home to draw the visitors level, with a pinpoint cross from Manchester City winger Savinho putting the ball on a plate for the Botafogo forward.

Brazil then made it 2-1 after 89 minutes with what was only their second big chance of the evening, as another Botafogo player, Luiz Henrique, drilled a low-driven effort into the bottom-left corner.

It was a disappointing showing from Dorival Junior's men, who failed to hit top form without star man Vinicius Junior, and the pressure on the manager is now only likely to increase after such a disjointed performance.

GOAL rates Brazil's players from Estadio Nacional Julio Martinez Pradanos...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Ederson (6/10):

Hard to blame him for the opener. Solid and reliable throughout.

Abner (6/10):

An unfamiliar face in the Selecao backline. He didn't put a foot wrong but didn't stand out either.

Gabriel (8/10):

Their best player on the night. Ran the show defensively and was calm playing out from the back. Constantly the one they relied on to get the ball moving forward.

Marquinhos (6/10):

Reliable as ever. Solid performance at the back.

Danilo (6/10):

Defensively sound but could've done more to get forward and support attacks.

Midfield

Lucas Paqueta (4/10):

Subbed off at half-time after being deployed as a deep-lying midfielder. The experiment did not work, at all.

Andre (5/10):

Removed at half-time. His pivot with Paqueta was woeful, and Dorival saw change was needed immediately.

AFP
Attack

Savinho (7/10):

Brilliant assist for Jesus' strike and showed some neat footwork as well. A great performance.

Igor Jesus (8/10):

Took his opportunity and scored a top header. Didn't threaten too much, but made use of space nicely.

Rodrygo (6/10):

Struggled in a striker role once again. Hard to blame him when Dorival insists he plays there for the national team.

Raphinha (6/10):

Struggled to integrate himself into the match. Did not look comfortable alongside Jesus and Savinho.

AFP
Subs & Manager

Bruno Guimaraes (6/10):

Brought on at half-time. A sense of composure and calmness arrived in the centre of the park as a result of his introduction.

Gerson (5/10):

Didn't do an awful lot to make his mark but didn't look out of place, either.

Luiz Henrique (8/10):

Brought on for Savinho with 22 minutes to spare and scored the winner. He likely should not have had as much time to get the shot off, but he'll take it. Top finish.

Endrick (N/A):

Introduced in the 78th minute, which was 20-30 minutes too late.

Gabriel Martinelli (N/A):

Brought on with five minutes to spare

Dorival Junior (3/10):

Disastrous tactics. His midfield pairing were removed at half-time amid their struggles to keep possession. Even with the three points, Dorival is on thin ice; and it's already started cracking.
