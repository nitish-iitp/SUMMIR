        "Igor Jesus will start up-front against Chile on his first call-up for the national team, leaving Real Madrid teenager Endrick on the bench.",
        "What I see is that Igor's moment is very interesting, Endrick is still getting to know his new club, he's arriving at the biggest club in world football with a lot of competition.",
        "I think that Igor's own experience and the moment he's living is a little different. Maybe it's important to have players with this profile for a game of this magnitude and at this time.",
        "Sometimes we can't replicate on the pitch everything that we do in training, but on Tuesday we had another training session that filled us with great expectation. Maybe this is the moment to find the balance we want."
