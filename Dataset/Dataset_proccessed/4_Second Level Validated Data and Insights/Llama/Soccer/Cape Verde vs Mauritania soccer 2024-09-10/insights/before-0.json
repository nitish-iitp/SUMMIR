    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Cape Verde are seeking their first points in this campaign, while the visitors aim to build on their opening-round victory.",
        "The Blue Sharks had kept five clean sheets in their last six matches across all competitions prior to the clash against the Pharaohs, but their defence fell like a pack of cards as they allowed eight shots on target with three going into the net.",
        "Mauritania finally ended a run of five matches without a win when Sidi Bouna Amar came off the bench to score a stunner in the 84th minute, helping them secure a 1-0 victory over Botswana in their opening AFCON qualifying match.",
        "The Lions of Chinguetti have endured a poor 2024 and the win would be a sigh of relief for Amir Abdou who saw his side lose six matches and draw two of the previous nine prior to last Saturday.",
        "Cape Verde's quest for a fifth AFCON appearance got off to a poor start, as they were thrashed 3-0 at the Cairo International Stadium last Friday.",
        "The Blue Sharks are unbeaten in their last four matches on home soil, winning three and drawing one, and anything short of victory on Tuesday could make qualification more difficult.",
        "Mauritania will head into Tuesday's clash with a chance of scoring and winning in back-to-back matches for the first time since they did so between September and October 2023.",
        "However, the last time the visitors won on the road was against Central African Republic in June 2023, and since then, they have lost to Congo DR and drawn with South Sudan away from home."
