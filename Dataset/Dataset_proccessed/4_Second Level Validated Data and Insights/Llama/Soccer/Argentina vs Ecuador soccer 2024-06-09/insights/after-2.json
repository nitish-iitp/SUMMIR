    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "MarioKempes: It was an overall naive performance. The first half was good with Di Maria scoring a brilliant one and Lautaro missing an easy one. The overall defensive setup was good.",
        "MarioKempes: We need to be sharper upfront. Nico needs to be unselfish and more aware of how his colleagues are moving.",
        "MarioKempes: Thankfully none got converted to a good chance for Ecuador.",
        "MarioKempes: However refereeing was poor today. He let Ecuador play a rough game.",
        "Rattlehead: Nico blew two clear chances. He didnt even notice his teammates completely in open space.",
        "Rattlehead: Julian and Lautaro for whatever reason hasnt been good for a long while.",
        "Rattlehead: Apart from Nico incompetence, I’d blame for the tactical setup at the final third.",
        "Rattlehead: Scaloni loves to have everyone act like a midfielders which is why Julian always instructed to stay deep and help to press, the same with Nico whenever he plays.",
        "Rattlehead: As a result Lautaro is always a lonely figure at the top and would only get 1-2 chances per game.",
        "Rattlehead: I cant believe Scaloni still using someone like Nico when he has Garnacho at his disposal.",
        "Rattlehead: Di Maria sure doesnt looks like someone who’s about to retire from international football within a month.",
        "Rattlehead: He’s playing better than most footballer in their prime.",
        "SulaV: Excellent display by our team, considering it was our first match after two and half months.",
        "SulaV: We were in total control of the match against a dirty opposition and we fought with a similar approach.",
        "SulaV: Lautaro could have scored a goal but the Ecuadorian keeper made a good save but he missed a open header again like in the final against France.",
        "SulaV: Julian wasn’t anywhere close to the goal and didn’t get any chance at all.",
        "SulaV: Messi is Messi but he also needs to adjust his game as he won’t get the same space and time he is used to in MLS.",
        "SulaV: Dimaria was again our no1 player, terrorized the Ecuadorian half.",
        "SulaV: Our midfield was missing both MacAllister and Enzo but were still in total control of the match.",
        "SulaV: Couldn’t create much but kept the possession and maintained the pressing.",
        "SulaV: Nico again is frustrating us with his poor finishing but Garnacho isn’t better finisher either.",
        "SulaV: Both are Scaloni kind of player constantly pressing up and down but both need to work on improving their finishing.",
        "SulaV: Defense has always been Scaloni team’s strength, never concede first has always been the strategy.",
        "SulaV: Emi didn’t have to anything toda.",
        "SulaV: Licha and Cuti’s partnership was mouth watering, they have a great chemistry and specially Licha’s passing accuracy and timing is sublime.",
        "SulaV: My only concern is our fullbacks, they aren’t creating much up front and every time put under pressure have leaked goals.",
        "Cowbhai: Nico is no longer an option unfortunately.",
        "Cowbhai: Lautaro confirmed he is not comfortable as a lone striker and needs someone to create space.",
        "Cowbhai: Alvarez dropping was not helpful for lautaro.",
        "Cowbhai: LoCelso did not have a good game.",
        "Cowbhai: Licha and cuti combo is promising.",
        "Cowbhai: Depaul Parades and Dimaria were good.",
        "Cowbhai: Time to get the youngsters a start against ElSalvador and Messi can super-sub again.",
        "Dfox1942: Ecuador played their game of chop and drop and the REF. figured he would eject third of their team if he really wanted to call the game properly and decided to let it go.",
        "Godin11: Scrapy match the only positive I took was cuti and licha partnership they played very good, lo celso was disappointed",
        "Cleanball: We get a glimpse how N/t will perform at Copa, not much change althought Scaloni did try a new formation with the same winning playerrs but not working soothly.",
        "Cleanball: Lautaro need his confidence back so do Alvarez need his confirm position; he loss it his club now at N/T.",
        "Cleanball: Nico is not so bad expect his chip did not passed the goalie.",
        "Cleanball: Otherwise, we will appreciate his effort and contribution.",
        "Cleanball: Licha and Cuti is rock solid.",
        "Cleanball: Di Maria is wine, age is just a number; he is the man of the match",
        "karl: We won the last World Cup without Nico and Lo Celso for a reason… These two idiots are the worst players in our squad.",
        "karl: Montiel has no offensive contribution at all.",
        "karl: Lautaro + Julian = failed experiment.",
        "karl: Time to give Garnacho more playing time!",
        "ualbert: This was a very boring game.",
        "ualbert: I find it frustrating that when we finally have good defense and mid-field we now have an offense that barely scores any goals.",
        "ualbert: I don’t know if our forwards are not scoring much due to how Scaloni has set up the team or if the offensive players aren’t just performing.",
        "MarioKempes: It was a brilliant save. I am not considering the header from Torro as unlucky. He really messed it like he did against France. I am worried about his fading form with our NT.",
        "MarioKempes: I think it could easily have been 3-0 if Di Maria got his freekick right by an inch and if Torro’s shot were not saved by the Ecuador goalkeeper."
