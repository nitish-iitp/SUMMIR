England v Bosnia LIVE: Result and reaction from Euro 2024 warm-up as Kane and Alexander-Arnold add late goals
Karl Matchett And Chris Wilson
Mon, Jun 3, 2024·43 min read

Trent Alexander-Arnold capped an impressive individual display with a tremendous volley as England beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 3-0 in their latest Euro 2024 warm-up friendly.

Preparations for this summer’s shot at silverware stepped up at St James’ Park as players got a chance to stake their claim for a place on the plane, or even a starting role against Serbia.

Cole Palmer’s spot-kick was followed by an excellent Alexander-Arnold effort and late Harry Kane goal on a night that provided manager Gareth Southgate with plenty of food for thought ahead of Friday’s final squad submission.

Eberechi Eze and Palmer produced positive displays on their first England starts, with the latter opening his international account after Ezri Konsa, another impressive performer, was fouled in the box. Alexander-Arnold did well on his latest audition in midfield but had reverted to a more familiar right-back role when he scored a superb late volley that substitute Kane added to.

Relive all the action from England versus Bosnia below:

Cole Palmer takes his biggest step yet but England’s other fringe players fail to fire

22:05 , Chris Wilson

Gareth Southgate picked a team of Euro 2024 hopefuls but few impressed enough to book a seat on the plane in a scrappy performance.

Go back less than a year and Cole Palmer seemed destined for a loan. Instead, he is now heading for Euro 2024, perhaps the breakout star of the club season with a first international goal to his name as well. Chelsea’s player of the season, a man Manchester City may rue selling, has 28 goals, in the shirts of two clubs and now his country.

He has scored in the Premier League, the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup, the Community Shield, the European Super Cup and now for England. If the caveat that his maiden strike in his country’s colours was from the penalty spot, plenty of his goals are, but whatever the stage, they seem taken with nonchalant confidence.

A friendly win over Bosnia and Herzegovina may cement Palmer’s place in Gareth Southgate’s final 26-man squad; not merely for his penalty-taking prowess – though that could prove handy in Germany – but a performance where he had come to look England’s likeliest source of a goal even before he scored one. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Harry Kaneadded more as Bosnia and Herzegovina were beaten; the Liverpool vice-captain with a classy volley, the England captain with a predatory finish. An illustration of Alexander-Arnold’s quality may be timely, a reminder of Kane’s ability to pilfer goals needless.

But Palmer took a bigger step forward than either.

Key England dates

22:45 , Chris Wilson

A reminder of the key dates for England ahead of a busy summer. They will play one more warm-up game before the official squad announcement and the beginning of Euro 2024.

7 June - final warm-up match against Iceland at Wembley, 7.45pm BST.

8 June - announcement of final 26-man squad.

16 June - opening game of Euro 2024, against Serbia at 8pm BST.

20 June - second group game of Euro 2024, against Denmark at 5pm BST.

25 June - final game of Euro 2024 group stage, against Slovenia at 8pm BST.

The round of 16, if England were to qualify, would begin from 29 June, with England playing on 30 June in Gelsenkirchen at 5pm BST if they manage to top the group.

22:30 , Chris Wilson

England managed to secure a win in one of their two warm-up matchesbefore departing for Germany and Euro 2024 as they downed Bosnia and Herzegovina 3-0.

However, it was far from a complete performance and Gareth Southgatetook the opportunity to try out some of the members of his squad he might not have seen a lot of.

Cole Palmer broke the deadlock from the penalty spot before Trent Alexander-Arnold doubled the home side’s advantage with a well-timed volley. Late in the match, Harry Kane, who started on the bench, was in the right place to tap home England’s third of the night.

Selected ratings:

Marc Guehi, 5

Looked a bit nervous and was shown a yellow card in a friendly for a sub-par challenge, and otherwise did not have a busy game.

Trent Alexander-Arnold, 8

Wearing an uncharacteristic number eight on the back of his shirt, he played some clever passes through the middle and won England a couple of corners. He provided a great cross-field pass to dangerously free Grealish down the left late on. Then hit a well-timed volley for England’s second goal.

Eberechi Eze, 7

Eze was one of the main bright sparks in the match. He made a strong powerful run between the lines and caused problems for defenders with his movement, pace and dribbling before he was substituted on the hour mark for Jack Grealish.

Below are the ratings for each player.

FT: England 3-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

22:20 , Chris Wilson

Nothing concrete will be known until 8 June, but a betting man would wager that Cole Palmer and Trent Alexander-Arnold have played their way on the plane tonight.

Eze was bright, and some would say man of the match, and if he plays like that on Friday it will be hard to deny him a place on the plane.

Adam Wharton was extremely composed throughout his debut and would make an interesting midfield alternative, whether or not Kobbie Mainoo is on the plane.

Konsa, Gallagher, Bowen and Watkins were all solid if unspectacular, with Marc Guehi struggling on one or two occasions (though he possesses the talent to be in the squad).

On tonight’s evidence, Lewis Dunk and Jarell Quansah will be the centre-backs who drop out of the squad, with Branthwaite showing an accomplished performance.

Not a good night for Curtis Jones or James Trafford, who weren’t given the chance to prove themselves.

FT: England 3-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

22:02 , Chris Wilson

Gareth Southgate is next to speak to the media. He agrees that he got “what he needed” from the performance.

“[There was] good tempo to the game, we just had to be patient. In the end the scoreline reflected the performance.

He adds that he thought both Palmer and Eze were “very good”, and “both played with freedom”.

He praises Eze’s movement and ability to take players on, while lamenting that Palmer could’ve had more opportunities but was “trying to be too precise”.

On Harry Kane, he says that the captain has “trained all week no problem, so he looks in good shape”.

He finishes by saying that the performance has given him some extra headaches, “but that’s a good thing”.

“[There were] lots of individual things I was really pleased with.”

FT: England 3-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:52 , Chris Wilson

Harry Kane and Cole Palmer are first in front of the Channel 4 cameras.

Kane calls it “a really good game for us”, adding that “it’s been a really good camp”.

“[It’s] good preparation, and overall a good night for us.”

Cole Palmer says it’s “a dream feeling” to score his first goal for England. When asked whether he thinks he’s done enough to be on the plane to Germany, he shrugs and says: “Not sure, hope so. It’s been a long season, I’m just trying to find my feet, but hopefully I’ll be going to Germany”.

Kane praises Palmer’s “unbelievable season”, before adding that he’s “feeling good” and “should be ready to go for the group stage”.

“A lot of the end of season [and him missing games] was precaution. In the end it was a good chance to get a good break after a tough season.”

21:38 , Chris Wilson

94 mins: FULL-TIME! Maddison has one last chance to find Grealish on the overlap but he’s dispossessed and the whsitle blows!

A decent second half from the Three Lions, with two debutants and a couple of players who’ll have played their way into the mind of Gareth Southgate.

21:33 , Chris Wilson

88mins: GOAL! Scrappy, but Kane won’t care!

Grealish has the ball in the box and he plays a lovely disguised pass to the overlapping Maddison. He cuts it back to Bowen, whose shot is blocked on the line by Konsa!

Nevertheless, it bounces back out to Kane, who manages to turn it in.

England 2-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:31 , Chris Wilson

87 mins: Lovely from Gallagher, who finds himself in space and beats two men before unleashing a shot that is saved behind fora corner.

GOAL! England 2-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:29 , Chris Wilson

85 mins: GOAL! That is superb.

England put in a series of crosses that come to nothing, before Wharton spreads it to Grealish. He takes his time before hooking in a cross towards Alexander-Arnold, and the Liverpool man hits a sublime volley that goes across the ‘keeper and creeps in at the far post.

England 1-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:26 , Chris Wilson

82 mins: Two more changes for Bosnia. Gigovic and Ahmedhodzic come off for Burnic and Muharemovic.

England 1-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:24 , Chris Wilson

81 mins: A lot more narrow from England now, with Grealish providing a little less width than Eze.

Alexander-Arnold does well to pick out Grealish with the diagonal. The City winger drives into the box and cuts on the outside before playing a pass to Maddison, but the Spurs man mistimes his touch and can only get a scuffed shot away.

England 1-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:21 , Chris Wilson

78 mins: Alexander-Arnold almost releases Kane down the middle, but it’s a poor touch from the captain.

GOAL! England 1-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:03 , Chris Wilson

60 mins: GOAL! Cole Palmer steps up on his first England start, and he rifles the penalty across his penalty and into the bottom right corner.

PENALTY! England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:02 , Chris Wilson

58 mins: The referee is going to the screen and it looks like England will be awarded a penalty!

It looks like there are two hands on Konsa’s shirt as he runs in. Pretty damning on the replay.

And it’s given! Tahirovic is booked too.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

21:00 , Chris Wilson

57 mins: Another corner for England ends with Bowen fizzling the ball across the box on the volley, but no one is there to reach it.

There’s a penalty check for a shirt pull on Konsa.

20:59 , Chris Wilson

55 mins: Bosnia break with Saric, but he’s forced to play it backwards. The away side keep possession though, before Katic loses it trying to go long.

England counter quickly, and it falls to Bowen on the right. He squares it to Palmer on the edge of the box, and he sells his marker with the dummy, but he tries one more dummy and the chance is gone.

Soon after, Gallagher wins a corner after his cross is turned behind.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:56 , Chris Wilson

53 mins: Lovely again from Palmer, who is on the wing and squares it to Trent. He plays a brilliant disguised pass inside to the overlapping Palmer, whose shot is deflected for a corner.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:55 , Chris Wilson

51 mins: Bowen’s shot bounces out to Alexander-Arnold, and he plays it wide to Konsa before receiving the cross. He tries to divert it goalward, but it comes off the defender and rolls to the ‘keeper.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:52 , Chris Wilson

48 mins: A decent counter from Bosnia is cut out by Konsa, and he sends Bowen through on the counter, but he’s brought down.

Alexander-Arnold shows his value as he picks up the ball in the centre circle, turns and clips a ball on to the onrushing Watkins, but he can’t get a foot to direct it past Vasilj.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:49 , Chris Wilson

46 mins: Lovely idea from Palmer as he tries the clever touch to take it around his marker, and it almost pays off as Bowen collects and the two combine.

It’s out for a corner though, which Alexander-Arnold swings in and Watkins meets, but the Villa man can’t get clean contact and it goes over.

HT: England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:35 , Chris Wilson

This game has been the same as many of England similar friendlies over the years. Tedious at best in many phases.

Eze and Palmer have certainly stood out, with Alexander-Arnold also showing why he’s a useful tool to have (but perhaps not a starting XI one).

All three have strengthened their claim to be on the plane, though the latter two were probably going anyway.

England will need much more quality in attack if they’re going to win this.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:33 , Chris Wilson

45 mins: HALF-TIME! Bowen receives the ball on the outside of the box, takes a touch to direct him inside and unleashes a shot that is straight at Vasilj.

There was just one minute of added time, and we head into the break with the scores level.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:31 , Chris Wilson

44 mins: A lull in activity as the half draws to a close, though Palmer is inches away from pouncing on a loose ball that would’ve put him clean through.

Bowen finds the ball on the right and dribbles wide past the challenge before delivering an inviting ball in, but England can’t make anything of it despite Watkins regaining possession.

20:28 , Chris Wilson

41 mins: A decent chance for Bosnia as Guehi plays a loose pass that runs straight to a white shirt. Hajradinovic hits the shot, but it’s deflected behind after Dunk blocks, and Bosnia can’t make anything of the corner.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:26 , Chris Wilson

39 mins: Alexander-Arnold does well to keep possession in the middle and spread a pass to Konsa.

England build again and Palmer exchanges passes with Konsa, before clipping a ball in towards Watkins in the box, but it runs out of play again.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:23 , Chris Wilson

37 mins: A little bit laboured from England in the last few minutes. Plenty of passing sideways, and not a lot of penetration.

Only Eze and Palmer have strengthened their case to be on the plane so far.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:22 , Chris Wilson

35 mins: Watkins is fouled near halfway as he skipped through a challenge, and England have it in midfield. Alexandrer-Arnold tries the long diagonal to Trippier, but the full-back just fails to control it.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:21 , Chris Wilson

33 mins: Another couple of disjointed attacks for England, as Palmer tries to squeeze through the challenge and then sends a through ball out of play.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:20 , Chris Wilson

31 mins: England are having a few moments of confusion here, but they manage to weather a Bosnia attack easily enough.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:17 , Chris Wilson

29 mins: Guehi is booked for a poorly timed challenge. Not a good moment for the Palace man!

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:16 , Chris Wilson

27 mins: From the corner, the ball drops at the feet of Konsa , but he can only hit his shot straight at the goalkeeper!

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:14 , Chris Wilson

26 mins: Nothing comes from the corner, but England win possession back quickly. All but one member of the Bosnia side is behind the ball.

England work an opportunity and again it’s Eze at the centre of things, as he beats two challenges before driving towards the box. He plays it to Palmer, who tries to slip it through, but it’s out for a corner.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:11 , Chris Wilson

23 mins: Bosnia win a corner, but they’re wasteful and nothing comes of it as England end up winning a throw-in.

England counter, and Palmer collects the ball on the right before easily beating his man and clipping in a cross, which is headed behind for a corner.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:09 , Chris Wilson

21 mins: Guehi almost finds Watkins with a lovely clipped ball over the top, but it runs to Vasilj.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:08 , Chris Wilson

20 mins: A slow start from England in truth. Only Eze and Palmer have really looked like they can make something happen so far.

Bosnia go long on the ball over the top, but Konsa and Gallagher combine to win it back for England.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:05 , Chris Wilson

16 mins: Nothing of note to report since that Watkins chance. It’s been a tame start from both sides.

England go on the attack once more, and Eze beats his man before slipping it through to the overlapping Palmer. He can’t get his cross through though, and the home side work it back to Conor Gallagher before he fires a shot wide from outside the box.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

20:02 , Chris Wilson

13 mins: The full-back is fine to carry on and we resume with more relaxed England possession. Before long another Bosnia player is down, this time Bicakcic.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

19:58 , Chris Wilson

11 mins: Some controlled possession from England as they build from the back. Alexander-Arnold is seeing plenty of the ball in midfield.

Gazibegovic is down briefly after a collision with Jarrod Bowen.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

19:56 , Chris Wilson

9 mins: CLOSE! Lovely from Palmer, who receives the ball on the turn and slips it through to Watkins. He lets it run through his legs and shrugs off the challenge, but his shot is straight at the ‘keeper.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

19:54 , Chris Wilson

6 mins: Saric does well to start the counter from his own half, and he wins a foul halfway into the England half as he surges towards the box.

Hajradinovic swings it in and Dzeko gets a foot to it, but it rolls harmlessly to Pickford.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

19:52 , Chris Wilson

5 mins: Palmer delivers an inviting free-kick but it’s headed away. England collect it again, with Gallagher winning a free-kick in midfield.

England 0-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

BREAKING: Kylian Mbappe finally completes Real Madrid transfer

19:00 , Chris Wilson

The biggest football-related news of the day has landed, as Kylian Mbappe has finally signed for Real Madrid, bringing one of modern football’s longest transfer sagas to an end and adding even more talent to the champions of Europe.

Madrid announced Mbappe’s arrival on Monday, two days after the club sealed a record-extending 15th European Cup, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2-0 at Wembley in Saturday night’s Champions League final.

They confirmed the news in a short statement that read: “Real Madrid CF and Kylian Mbappe have reached an agreement whereby he will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons.”

The captain of France’s five-year contract reportedly includes a €150m signing-on fee to be paid in instalments over the deal.

Team news

18:55 , Chris Wilson

No first caps for a new England player yet then, with the uncapped quintet all on the bench to start with.

All five will be hoping to see some action tonight – there are no limits to the number of substitutions permitted – though it may be difficult for Trafford to get on considering neither of Ramsdale or Henderson are in the starting XI.

Expect at least one debutant later tonight though, with Branthwaite, Quansah, Wharton and Jones all battling for a place on the plane.

Team News

18:50 , Chris Wilson

Plenty of changes for England then, with Gareth Southgate making seven changes to the side that drew 2-2 to Belgium in the last international break.

Marc Guehi and Kieran Trippier come into defence in place of John Stones and Ben Chilwell, while Southgate opts for Alexander-Arnold and Gallagher in midfield in place of Declan Rice and Kobbie Mainoo.

Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham are replaced by Cole Palmer and Eberechi Eze in attack, with Watkins coming in for Ivan Toney up front.

England vs Bosnia-Herzegovina Match Stats

18:05 , Chris Wilson

Perhaps surprisingly, tonight’s meeting between these sides is the first time that the two have met.

This will be the first meeting between the two nations in any competition, though Bosnia and Herzegovina are unbeaten in their seven games against British nations this century (W4 D3). Their last loss on UK soil came against Scotland in 1999.

For England, this will be the first game at St. James’ Park since 2005, when the Three Lions beat Azerbaijan 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier.

England are unbeaten in their last eleven friendly matches against European nations (W8 D3) since losing 3-2 away at France in June 2017, but their last two matches – friendlies against Brazil and Belgium respectively – produced disappointing results.

Similarly, Bosnia and Herzegovina have lost their last four matches, conceding 13 goals across these games, including a 2-1 loss to Ukraine in their Euro 2024 qualifying play-off.

When does Euro 2024 start?

17:50 , Chris Wilson

The summer’s main football competition begins on 14 June in Munich, where hosts Germany will play Scotland in the opening game of Group A.

The games come thick and fast from 15 June onwards, with three matches per day on all but one day between 15 June and 23 June.

Selected fixtures from the opening round include:

GROUP B – Spain vs Croatia, 15 June 8pm BST

When is the England squad announced?

17:35 , Chris Wilson

Tonight’s game is the first of two warm-up friendlies that England are playing ahead of the final 26-man squad for the tournament being announced.

England will play Iceland at Wembley on 7 June, and the following day, Southgate will name his official squad for the European Championship in Germany.

Below is everything you need to know about the squad announcement.

When will England’s final Euro 2024 squad be announced?

England’s Euro 2024 squad: Who is almost on the plane?

17:20 , Chris Wilson

A handful of players have all but secured their places in the side, with factors including impressive Premier League performances or a lack of competition in the side helping their chances.

Aaron Ramsdale

The goalkeeper lost his battle for a starting place at Arsenal with David Raya, but even so, he is likely to go to the Euros as Pickford’s deputy.

Kieran Trippier

One of Southgate’s favourites, Trippier is likely to be part of the squad for his experience, versatility and his set-piece delivery. His form for Newcastle this season has not been to his typical high standards and he had battled injury over the past two months, but he can cover both right-back and left-back.

Conor Gallagher

Gallagher seems to have done enough to usurp more well-established internationals and regular starts for Chelsea this season have increased his chances of being selected for the Euros in a position where England lack depth.

Kobbie Mainoo

Mainoo has had an impressive breakthrough year at Manchester United after graduating from the club’s academy, and the teenager reproduced that form in his first senior start for England against Belgium. Given the lack of midfield options, Mainoo may well have played himself into the Euros squad – and perhaps even the starting XI.

James Maddison

The midfielder struggled with an injury at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which prevented him from making an appearance, but he’s done enough for Tottenham this season to earn another squad place at the Euros. Maddison will provide an alternative option as an attacking midfielder, though his minutes may be limited.

Cole Palmer

Chelsea’s talisman won the Premier League’s young player of the year award after scoring 26 goals and racking up 15 assists in all competitions. Palmer has two England caps, although a minor injury scuppered his chances of showing what he can do during March’s internationals.

Ollie Watkins

Watkins has been sensational since Unai Emery took over as Aston Villa manager last year, and the striker makes a strong case for the role of Kane’s deputy at the Euros after finishing the Premier League season with the most assists (13) and joint-fourth most goals (19).

Jude Bellingham

The 20-year-old has quickly elevated himself to be one of England’s essential players. He is consistently producing outstanding performances both for his country and his club, Real Madrid, racking up goals and assists after driving runs from midfield.

Declan Rice

Rice has been one of Arsenal’s outstanding players this season, and his importance at international level has grown immeasurably over the past few years to the point where he is crucial to how England play. After Kane, Rice is arguably England’s hardest player to replace.

Phil Foden

Foden enjoyed his best season yet in a Manchester City shirt, becoming a talisman for the club that delivers time and again. His velcro control is unique in the national squad and Southgate’s only conundrum is where to fit Foden’s attacking talents into a team containing Bellingham, Saka and more.

Bukayo Saka

Saka is fast becoming a senior England player despite being only 22, and is set for a key role at Euro 2024. He has produced another excellent season for Arsenal, with 20 goals and 14 assists from 47 games, and Saka will be first choice on England’s right wing in Germany.

Harry Kane

England’s captain remains their talisman on the pitch, both with his leadership and with his goals in a record-breaking debut season at Bayern Munich, even if it was also a trophyless one. The only concern is fitness after a back injury prevented Kane from playing in Bayern’s final game of the season.

England’s Euro 2024 squad: Who’s on the plane?

16:50 , Chris Wilson

While some players will still be worried about earning their place on the plane to Germany, there are several who are certain to be in the squad come 8 June.

So who is definitely on the plane?

Jordan Pickford

The Everton goalkeeper has been England’s No 1 for a long time and that position is safe, given the way his closest challenger, Aaron Ramsdale, was usurped by David Raya at Arsenal this season.

John Stones

The Manchester City defender has been a stalwart for Southgate over the years, integral to deep runs at the 2018 World Cup and the last Euros, and the lack of centre-back alternatives only strengthens his position in the squad.

Harry Maguire

The Manchester United defender is one of Southgate’s most trusted players and he remains the most likely partner for Stones at Euro 2024, in what will be their fourth tournament together. His calf injury is not expected to deny him a place on the plane.

Kyle Walker

Experience, recovery pace and an ability to play on the right of a back three all make the Manchester City captain an essential part of Southgate’s plans.

Trent Alexander-Arnold

Alexander-Arnold has struggled to get games for England at right-back, but a switch into midfield has seen him more involved for his country. The Liverpool vice-captain offers unique creativity as well as pinpoint set-piece delivery and could be an option alongside Rice as a deep-lying midfielder.

England’s Euro 2024 squad: Who’s on the plane and who will miss out?

England vs Bosnia-Herzegovina – who is fighting for a place on the plane?

16:35 , Chris Wilson

Several players are almost guaranteed a place on the plane to Germany, but will be fighting for a starting place before the tournament begins.

Among these is Chelsea starlet Cole Palmer, who capped an impressive Premier League campaign by winning the young player of the season award.

His league form would usually be deserving of a starting berth, but such is the form of Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham that the Chelsea man will likely not start (at least at first), whether on the wing or more centrally.

Kobbie Mainoo is fresh off the back of scoring the winner in the FA Cup final, but he is another player who will be fighting for both his place on the plane and potentially a starting position. With Rice and Bellingham almost guaranteed to start in midfield, there is one starting place up for grabs between Mainoo, Adam Wharton and Chelsea’s Conor Gallagher.

The last worries come in defence, where injuries to Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw have cast doubts over whether either will be fit to start the opening game against Serbia on 16 June.

This means there are gaps in the squad for adaptable defenders such as Ezri Konsa and Joe Gomez, who can play in a range of positions across the back.

Centre-backs Jarrad Branthwaite, Marc Guehi and Jarell Quansah have all had good seasons, but there will likely only space for two of them behind Kyle Walker, John Stones, Kieran Tripper and the aforementioned Manchester United men.

England may be set for some debutants in Newcastle

16:20 , Chris Wilson

Five of the players called up into the 33-man squad are uncapped so far.

Burnley ‘keeper James Trafford, who is the likeliest goalkeeper to be dropped from the squad, will hope to make his first appearance.

Defenders Jarrad Branthwaite and Jarell Quansah are both uncapped too, with the Everton man looking more likely to potentially gain a place in the tournament squad.

The final two uncapped players are Curtis Jones and Adam Wharton, who it seems like are competing for one spot in midfield. Liverpool midfielder Jones has featured heavily for England U21s in the past, with Wharton having taken great strides in his career since joining Crystal Palace from Blackburn in January.

Prediction & Odds

16:05 , Chris Wilson

Even a depleted or experimental England side should have enough to win the game, with the away side not taking part in this summer’s European championships. Expect wholesale changes as Southgate aims to make the final decisions on his squad for the tournament, but a straightforward England win nonetheless. England 3-1 Bosnia.

Odds

England win 1/10

Draw 6/1

Bosnia win 16/1

Predicted Line-ups

15:55 , Chris Wilson

ENG: Ramsdale, Walker, Guehi, Branthwaite; Trippier; Rice, Mainoo, Eze; Foden, Kane, Palmer.

BOS: Sehic; Ahmedhodzic; Hadzikadunic, Kolasinac; Dedic, Cimirot, Krunic, Gazibegovic; Hajradinovic; Dzeko, Demirovic.

Team News

15:45 , Chris Wilson

Southgate has confirmed that six players will miss the game, with Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham unavailable having won played in the Champions League final on 1 June. He’ll join the squad on 8 June.

Manchester United defenders Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw are still nursing injuries as they battle to be fit in time for the opening match of Euro 2024 (and indeed, to make the final squad). Manchester City’s John Stones is unavailable having joined the squad late.

Anthony Gordon is recovering from an injury, and Southgate has said that Saka will be also be rested.

15:30 , Chris Wilson

With Jordan Pickford an automatic choice in goal, the three behind him are not just vying for two plane tickets, but the right to be his go-to backup in-tournament. In defence, the alternatives at full-back must be decided, especially on the left given Luke Shaw’s ongoing injury issue, while four centre-backs in the squad tally just seven caps between them, with two as yet untested.

Further forward, Southgate must choose whether he wants to see Liverpool’s Alexander-Arnold in midfield dovetailing with Declan Rice before the tournament starts, or if it’s more important to give other fringe options a chance to succeed and earn a place in the squad, while the likes of Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze will be hoping for a go with Anthony Gordon currently out with an injury. Competition for places in the wide areas of attack are fierce - and then there’s the Harry Kane understudy to fully decide on.

Read below for The Independent’s thoughts on who might start tonight.

England have just two matches this week before Euro 2024 is upon them - with Gareth Southgate still needing to refine his squad and decide which seven he is going to cut from his preliminary group.

The first of those warm-up friendlies takes place on Monday night with the Three Lions in action against Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a host of absentees meaning spots are definitely up for grabs if players impress when handed the chance to start.

But who should get the nod?

Recent results haven’t been great for Southgate and Co - no wins in the last three.

Those latest games did come after a run of eight wins in nine, to be fair, which spanned most of qualifying. But of late it has been average at best: 1-1 away to North Macedonia, a 1-0 defeat to Brazil and a 2-2 draw with Belgium.

Only one goal in those three matches scored by an England player in open play, that being Jude Bellingham’s late equaliser in the last match.

Southgate will be hoping for a significantly better return in these two outings.

Gareth Southgate believes England’s Euros bid will benefit from cricket star Ben Stokes’ “brilliant session” on adapting a fearless mindset whilst embracing pressure and nerves.

The Euro 2020 finalists’ preparations to go one better this summer are under way, with the majority of the squad convening at their temporary County Durham base on Wednesday.

England welcomed a special guest to Rockliffe Hall over the weekend as they put in the groundwork for Germany, with Test captain Stokes imparting his wisdom to those going for Euro 2024 glory.

Bosnia and Herzegovina captain Edin Dzeko believes England can win Euro 2024.

England host Bosnia in a friendly fixture at St James’ Park on Monday and the visitors arrived in Newcastle earlier on Sunday.

It is the start of a new era for Bosnia after they appointed former forward Sergej Barbarez as head coach in April following a failure to qualify for this summer’s European Championship in Germany.

After Monday’s clash with England, Bosnia will travel to Italy for a friendly and Dzeko, who spent five years at Manchester City, feels both teams can win Euro 2024.

Luke Shaw has good chance of making England’s Euro 2024 squad

14:00 , Karl Matchett

Gareth Southgate says Luke Shaw has gone from a long shot to having a “good chance” of recovering from injury in time to make England’s Euro 2024 squad.

The 28-year-old has endured an injury-hit season with Manchester United and has been laid low with his latest muscle issue since mid-February.

Shaw was expected to return in early May only to suffer a setback, leaving the left-back in a race against time to make this summer’s European Championship squad.

Southgate included the Euro 2020 final goalscorer in his 33-man training group but admitted he was a “long shot” and somewhat of a “wild card”.

Shaw is set to miss both warm-up friendlies against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland, but the England boss has been enthused by his progress.

England skipper Harry Kane continued to work his way back towards full fitness as Gareth Southgate and his players stepped up their preparations for Euro 2024.

The 30-year-old Bayern Munich striker was among 26 players who trained at Middlesbrough’s Rockliffe Park headquarters on Sunday ahead of Monday night’s friendly clash with Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Kane missed the final two games of his club’s season with a back injury sustained in the Champions League semi-final second-leg defeat by Real Madrid.

Gareth Southgate has warned it will not just be a “procession to Berlin” for England amid their injury problems as he admitted that the troubled seasons of Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips have left him over-reliant on Declan Rice.

England will enter Euro 2024 as one of the favourites but Southgate is worried by injury problems in the midfield after omitting his vice-captain Henderson and dropping Phillips, a stalwart of his Euro 2020 squad, in March. The England manager revealed he has never had such a complicated build-up to a tournament with so many injuries, particularly in defence.

But in midfield, Southgate faces a question of who to partner with Rice – with the uncapped Adam Wharton and Curtis Jones named in his 33-man training squad and Trent Alexander-Arnold a midfield option – and believes he may have to change his tactics if Arsenal’s £105m signing is ruled out. He is reluctant to use Jude Bellingham in a deeper role in midfield but accepts he may have to.

England boss Gareth Southgate has been “pleased with the progress” Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw are making as the Manchester United duo look to prove their fitness for Euro 2024.

The pair missed the Red Devils’ victorious conclusion to a bumpy season through injury but were included in the 33-man training squad taking part in a 10-day pre-tournament camp.

Maguire and Shaw linked up with England early in a bid to prove their fitness as they recover from muscle injuries that have kept them out for a month and three months respectively.

They are set to miss Monday’s friendly at St James’ Park against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland’s visit to Wembley on Friday but are progressing well, along with Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon, who was also absent from training.

Kieran Trippier has confirmed he is fit and well to tackle England’s Euro 2024 finals campaign after finding himself at the centre of rumours he was out of the tournament.

The 33-year-old specialist right-back could once again line up at left-back for his country at a major tournament with Luke Shaw facing a race against time to work his way back from injury before the opening Group C fixture against Serbia on June 16.

Trippier joined up with the Three Lions squad himself on the comeback trail having not played 90 minutes since February because of a calf injury, and off the back of a gruelling post-season trip to Australia with the Magpies which sparked a major scare when he was substituted 37 minutes into a friendly clash with Tottenham in Melbourne.

England manager Gareth Southgate is still weighing up the attacking options for his Euro 2024 squad and said that while Jack Grealish has not played as much as he would have liked this season, he is still in the running to make the cut.

Marcus Rashford was left out of the provisional 33-man squad for Germany and there has been talk that Grealish could be the next big name axed with Southgate set to cut the squad to 26 players by June 7.

Grealish made just 20 Premier League appearances for Manchester City this season, scoring three goals, and was an unused substitute in their FA Cup final defeat by Manchester United last month.

Gareth Southgate’s England side will face Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first of two warm-up friendlies ahead of the start of Euro 2024.

The Three Lions travel to Newcastle on 3 June for the first step in their preparations ahead of the summer tournament, which begins in Germany on 14 June.

England’s first game takes place against Serbia on 16 June, but before that, Southgate needs to narrow down his 33-man provisional squad to just 26 players.

This game will likely help to decide who occupies those final spots on the plane to Germany, but some England stalwarts will be injured for the game, with players such as Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka unavailable, the former having won the Champions League just 48 hours beforehand.

So expect plenty of changes, with the England manager experimenting with different players as he tries to trim his squad, and certain players trying to grab their last chance at a spot on the plane.

Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the game.
