England vs Bosnia LIVE!

England brushed aside Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday night in the first of two final warm-up friendlies for Euro 2024. Eberechi Eze aside, a second-string Three Lions unit mostly flattered to deceive in a largely turgid first half at Newcastle’s St James’ Park, but turned up the tempo after the break to eventually win at a canter.

First Cole Palmer netted his first senior international goal from the penalty spot on his first England start after a foul on Ezri Konsa that was awarded after a VAR check. England then got impressive cameos off the bench from the likes of Harry Kane, James Maddison and Jack Grealish, the latter of whom teed up Trent Alexander-Arnold for a sweet volley five minutes from time.

There was still time for Kane to add further gloss to the scorline from close range, with Gareth Southgate’s team now moving on to face Iceland at Wembley on Friday night before the manager has to deliver his final 26-man Euros squad ahead of the Group C opener against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on June 16. Follow England vs Bosnia reaction live below, with expert analysis from Standard Sport’s Dan Kilpatrick and Malik Ouzia at St James’ Park!

Excellent Eze takes England chance

In a week in which Gareth Southgate faces twin objectives - namely sculpting his first-choice Euro 2024 team and trimming his provisional squad of 33 to 26 - this was an evening explicitly geared towards the latter, writes Standard Sport’s Malik Ouzia.

Of the XI picked to start this 3-0 friendly win over Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first of two warm-ups before England fly to Germany, only goalkeeper Jordan Pickford could be sure of a starting place for the opening group game against Serbia in just under a fortnight’s time, with plenty of the rest uncertain as to whether or not they might be on their summer holidays by then.

Southgate, though, had insisted that this was not a trial in itself, suggesting the makeup of his ideal squad is already fairly clear in his mind, injury not withstanding.

That may be just as well: having decided against giving debuts to any of the five uncapped players in his squad from the start, this did not have the feel of an evening on which any of the outsiders and hopefuls dramatically moved the dial.

England player ratings

Subs

Harry Kane (Watkins 62’) 8

Immediately offered England more of a focal point in attack and went close with a fierce long-range effort before a poacher’s finish in the box added to his goal tally.

James Maddison (Eze 62’) 7

Sharp and made the third goal with a cut-back. Still, Eze’s performance meant he may ultimately be one of the night’s losers.

Adam Wharton (Trippier 62’) 7

Composed on his debut, albeit in relatively low-pressure circumstances. Clearly comfortable receiving possession in tight areas.

Jarrad Branthwaite (Guehi 62’) 6

Comfortable on the ball but had no defending to do as England dominated the final half an hour. Booked.

Jack Grealish (Palmer 62’) 8

Made the second goal with a brilliant ball for Alexander-Arnold and also involved in the build-up to the third. A timely reminder of his quality.

Joe Gomez (Dunk 73’) 6

Solid in a late run out but feels behind Konsa in the race to be England’s utility man at the back.

Starters

Jordan Pickford 6

Did not have a serious save to make. If we’re nit-picking, he fluffed one kick and flapped at one corner.

Ezri Konsa 7

A threat at attacking set-pieces and won England’s penalty when he was dragged down by his shirt.

Earlier had an effort parried by goalkeeper Nikola Vasilj in an encouraging run out. Started at right-back, finished at centre-back – his versatility is an asset.

Marc Guehi 5

Lost possession with a loose pass leading to a Bosnian chance late in the first half in a slightly jittery showing. Booked.

Lewis Dunk 6

Occasionally a little clumsy but did his job on the rare occasions Bosnia threatened in the final third.

Kieran Trippier 6

Tidy in possession but offered little in the way of thrust down the left flank, frequently looking to cut back on his right foot.

Trent Alexander-Arnold 8

Outstanding after the interval, both in midfield and after switching to right-back for the final half an hour. Took his goal superbly.

Conor Gallagher 7

Will be encouraged to get 90 minutes to show what he can do in the engine room. Industrious and tenacious without the ball but a little wasteful with it.

Jarrod Bowen 7

More involved after the break and was a threat down the right, his energy and directness unsettling Bosnia’s defence.

Cole Palmer 7

Scored from the spot in his last action of the game. Not at his sharpest but made an early chance for Watkins and got into some promising positions.

Eberechi Eze 8

Comfortably England’s liveliest player in a pedestrian first half. Always looked to take on his man and his directness and control were eye-catching.

Ollie Watkins 6

Had a couple of efforts saved in a slow first half and occasionally threatened to get behind the Bosnia defence.

Southgate on England's performance

"We had an opponent that was dogged, determined, (there was a) good tempo to the game, so physically it was a good workout.

"We just had to be patient and we felt that in the end we'd create the chances.

“That's how it turned out, really.

“I thought in the end the scoreline reflected the performance."

Gareth Southgate on selection headaches

"A little bit - but that's a good thing.

"I'd rather we'd had good performances that caused you to think than poor performances.

“So there were lots of individual things that I was really pleased with."

Gareth Southgate reaction

"The great thing is we've got through the last few days with no big problems.

"We needed to get through these first few matches and the finals that have been played to have a clearer picture, and the guys that have been rehabbing have progressed well."

Harry Kane allays fitness fears

"I am feeling good. A lot of the end of season was precaution, of course there is a big summer coming up,” the England captain told Channel 4 after his impressive goal-scoring cameo at St James’ Park.

"We didn't want to take risks with it [back injury]. In the end it was a good chance to take a good break after a tough season.

"It has almost worked in my favour, missing the back end of the season. It gave me a chance to get a bit more rest than I was going to get.

"I'm not one who takes too long to get sharp and it was nice to get a goal there to get that feeling back again."

England 3-0 Bosnia

Full-time

Job done for the Three Lions after a much-improved second-half display.

On to Iceland at Wembley on Friday night and the small matter of Southgate cutting this squad from 33 to 26.

That Group C Euros opener against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen is less than two weeks away...

England 3-0 Bosnia

Standard Sport’s Dan Kilpatrick at St James’ Park

Alexander-Arnold has been excellent since the interval, both in midfield and since switching to right-back after the opening goal.

He deserves that moment, and it is a good one for Jack Grealish too, who gets the assist to remind everyone of his enduring quality.

3 JUNE 2024
GOAL! England 3-0 Bosnia | Harry Kane 89'

The floodgates have opened late at St James’ Park!

Grealish and Maddison combine before Konsa inadvertently denies Bowen his first England goal.

No matter, Kane is on hand to squirm the rebound beyond Vasilj.

3-0 feels very harsh on Bosnia, despite England’s obvious improvements in this second half.
