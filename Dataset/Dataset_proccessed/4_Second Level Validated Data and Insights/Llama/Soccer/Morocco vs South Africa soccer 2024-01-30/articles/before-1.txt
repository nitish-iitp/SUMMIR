“We know if we succeed (against Morocco) it will be a big step to what we all want. That is to play in the final and win it.” – Bafana coach Hugo Broos said as quoted by Citizen.

“Morocco were at the World Cup (they made the semifinals of Qatar 2022) but I think they (still) want to win the AFCON, maybe for the last time this will be a chance (for these players) to achieve the highest level.

They were not really very good in the group stages (Morocco drew with the DR Congo but also beat Tanzania and Zambia), but this is still a good team, and it will be a tough battle (on Tuesday).

“But this is a football match and what has happened here at the AFCON has been amazing, so let’s make another surprise. That Bafana can beat them, that is the most important thing we learned.”
