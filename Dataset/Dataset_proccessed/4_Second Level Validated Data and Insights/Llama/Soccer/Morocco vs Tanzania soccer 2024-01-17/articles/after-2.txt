MOROCCO 3-0 TANZANIA - AZZEDINE OUNAHI SCORES STUNNER AS MOROCCO OPEN ACCOUNT WITH COMFORTABLE WIN
BYCHARLIE WEBSTER

UPDATED 17/01/2024 AT 19:48 GMT

A fabulous goal from Marseille’s Azzedine Ounahi highlighted Morocco’s comfortable win over Tanzania in their opening group game of the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco, semi-finalists at the 2022 World Cup, came into the tournament as early favourites and were rarely troubled during their opening game. Tanzania’s tough task was compounded when Novatus Miroshi was sent off in the second-half.

In a tournament where minnows have shone so far Morocco brushed off any ideas of another upset with a commanding performance against a struggling Tanzanian side, running out 3-0 winners in their opening game.
On a hot and humid evening, the game started in a relatively timid fashion which will have pleased Tanzanian manager Adel Amrouche. However, refreshed after the first water break Morocco’s stars began to shine as a fierce Hakim Ziyech free kick fell to Romain Saiss who smashed home the rebound.

The Atlas Lions then only grew in confidence and began playing like a side who had reached the World-Cup semi-final just over a year ago. After Tanzania found themselves down to ten men following another reckless challenge from Novatus Miroshi the game became a no-contest.

Ziyech continued to show his quality as late goals from Azzedine Ounahi and Youssef En-Nesyri capped off a dominant performance by one of the tournament favourites, who will have no doubt caught the eyes of rivals with their display.
Tanzania on the other hand will be wondering what they can do to get anything from this group.
TALKING POINT – MOROCCO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL START
After becoming the first African side to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup this Moroccan side headed into the Africa Cup of Nations as one of the very favourites. Having, not won the tournament since 1976 the Atlas Lions don’t have history on their side and given the flurry of upsets in the opening games will have been wary of another.
However, they swept away any doubt with one of the best performances thus far. Looking in control, confident and with an attacking edge very few can match, Morocco will have made their tournament rivals sit up with their win this evening.
The only remaining question being how they will fare against the stronger DR Congo next time out.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH – HAKIM ZIYECH (MOROCCO)
Although he didn’t get on the scoresheet his performance deserved one. Right from the start he was Morocco’s best player and even during the slow early stages looked likely to break the deadlock. It was his free kick which set up the opener by Saiss and throughout the game he created multiple chances for his teammates. The trademark silky feet and deadly set-pieces caused numerous issues for Tanzania who simply couldn’t cope with this creativity.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
30’ GOAL! Morocco 1-0 Tanzania (Saiss): Ziyech rockets a free kick towards goal and the keeper can only parry. Romain Saiss finds himself unmarked and pounces on the rebound to give Morocco the lead.
70’ RED CARD! Tanzania (Miroshi): A reckless sliding challenge is correctly punished as Miroshi picks up his second yellow of the game reducing Tanzania to ten men.
77’ GOAL! Morocco 2-0 Tanzania (Ounahi): A great one-two on the edge of the box finds its way back to Ounahi who passes the ball into the bottom into the bottom left corner.
80’ GOAL! Morocco 3-0 Tanzania (En-Nesyri): After a lengthy VAR check in which three substitutes were made Morocco are given the goal and their striker is off the mark. A cute ball into the box gives En-Nesyri a simple one touch finish to put the icing on the cake.
