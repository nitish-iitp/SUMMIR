The anthems rang out into the night sky, relating that Wales would give until the last. Yma O Hyd — ‘Still Here’ — declared the one which seemed so fitting, given that when Gareth Bale walked away, the hopes of another tournament play-off like this seemed lost.

But it was not to be. It came down to penalties this time and in the final reckoning, Dan James, who missed the last of them, was left with the kind of agony that few professionals know. There will be no Wales bucket hats in the bars of Berlin and Munich this summer.

Welsh minds were willing, their defence absolutely resilient and the Red Wall indomitable to the last. There was even a rendition of Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau before the kicks ensued. 

But, really, it was the absence of a moment of genius before that penalty jeopardy which cost Wales. Not long before the end of extra time, a free-kick materialised in the kind of place where Bale would generally step up to despatch them on these occasions. Harry Wilson sent it into the wall.

It wasn’t the first time. For just one moment, a little after half-time, the Welsh nation collectively held its breath and watched a ball head towards goal which might have also sent the team to Germany.

Three good headed chances came and went for Moore. His angles were askew when the first presented itself in the first half. Szczesny’s save repelled the second. He headed the third into the turf. 

And he wasn’t the only one struggling to deliver against a white wall of tall Poles.

Kieffer Moore had risen to meet Neco Williams’ cross and propelled it towards the top-right corner of the net. Wojciech Szczesny twisted himself towards the ball and expertly gloved it away.

Moore had posed Page’s big selection conundrum, just as he has for so much of the manager’s four years at the helm. He opted for his aerial power over the pace and invention of David Brooks, whose selection against Finland had brought Wales a goal as they flooded the opposition back line with players. It did not pay off.

Brennan Johnson flattered to deceive, as he has done so often with Wales. He set off like a missile in the game’s early stages but went off the boil and was replaced by James. 

Wilson started well and was an intermittent threat, though he, too, failed to make the same imprint he had against Finland.

For Page, there are so many what-ifs, though the night of Friday, June 16 last year in this place will haunt him the most. It was when Armenia, ranked 97th in the world, arrived and inflicted the most humiliating defeat Wales have experienced this century.

Losing 4-2 — and dropping two points in Yerevan five months later — proved fateful, as things transpired.

The questions which then ensued about Page inspired his players to a win over Croatia, though many will now argue that a more effective manager would have seen them to Germany. Wales FA chief executive Noel Mooney indicated last October that Page’s future was dependent on qualification.

This was still some night, though, with electricity bolts shooting through this stadium even before a ball had been kicked. The substantial and noisy Polish contingent were bolshy, refusing stewards’ requests to take their seats, and when the game began, there was resistance from the players, too.

Buoyed by the early noise which almost blew the roof off this place, Wales drove at the Poles, pressed them hard, looking for an early breakthrough. 

But Williams, whose right flank was the prime attacking front in the first half, found full back Przemyslaw Frankowski a formidable opponent, suffocating his chance to run free and cause danger.

Moore and Ben Davies got in each other’s way when leaping for an aerial chance. And when the same players combined to get the ball into the net just before half-time, Davies had strayed offside by the length of a boot when nodding Moore’s header on into the net.

Chris Mepham saw red in the dying moments before Wales crashed out after a second yellow

Robert Lewandowski was becalmed. Chris Mepham — who saw red in the dying moments of extra time for his second yellow card — lost him from a second-half corner, though Wales escaped as he headed over. When Lewandowski finally ran flat at the Welsh rearguard, Davies coolly dispossessed him.

But as the game wore on, a Wales goal seemed less and less likely, leaving James with the enormity of that 10th kick. He was ashen-faced as he left the field and though Page looked to offer some solace, the manager is the one peering into uncertainty today as Wales work out where to go from here.
