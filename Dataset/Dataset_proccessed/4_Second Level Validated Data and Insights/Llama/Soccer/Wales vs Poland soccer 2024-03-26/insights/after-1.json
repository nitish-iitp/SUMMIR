        "Wales are now unbeaten in seven – only once have they recorded a longer streak without defeat under Rob Page (nine games between September 2021 and March 2022 – W4 D5).",
        "Robert Lewandowski has been directly involved in 24 goals in his last 27 appearances for Poland (16 goals, eight assists), although he’s not scored in any of his three games against Wales to date.",
        "Harry Wilson assisted one of the goals in that win, with that his sixth goal involvement in nine Euro 2024 qualifying appearances (three goals, three assists) – the most of any Welsh player in the qualifiers."

        "Wales and Poland are one match away from Euro 2024, with this European Championship play-off final deciding one of the last three slots available at the tournament this summer.",
        "Poland will need to improve their recent competitive away form if they are to progress to Euro 2024. Since the start of 2023, they have lost three of their four Euro qualifier matches played away from home (W1), suffering defeats to Czechia, Moldova and Albania in that time.",
        "Wales have only lost one of their last 15 Euro qualifiers played at the Cardiff City Stadium (W10 D4), so will be confident of making it again.",
        "Polish success could hinge on the performance of star striker Robert Lewandowski in this game."

    "Others": [
        "Wales reached this final after an impressive 4-1 semi-final win against Finland last Thursday. Goals from David Brooks, Neco Williams, Brennan Johnson and Daniel James helped them to victory in this winner-takes-all clash.",
        "Wales and Poland have faced each other on 10 previous occasions. The only victory for the Dragons came in their first meeting back in March 1973 (2-0) – they’ve gone winless across the nine clashes since then (D2 L7).",
        "Wales are looking to qualifying for a third consecutive UEFA European Championship tournament, having previously appeared in the 2016 and 2020 editions.",
        "The Opta supercomputer suggests this is likely to be a close encounter. It considers Wales to be favourites ahead of kick-off, but not overwhelmingly so."
