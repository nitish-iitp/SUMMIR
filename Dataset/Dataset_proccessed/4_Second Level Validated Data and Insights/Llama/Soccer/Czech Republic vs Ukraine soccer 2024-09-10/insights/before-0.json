        "Czech Republic's Ivan Hasek's troops were embarrassed 4-1 by Georgia in their opening assignment, while their visitors failed to cling onto a one-goal lead against Albania, losing 2-1.",
        "Ukraine's Sergiy Rebrov's men therefore only have a short journey to make for their next Nations League engagement, where they square up to a nation who experienced a similarly excruciating summer; Ukraine also suffered a Euros group-stage exit after being tipped as the dark horses by many."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Blue and Yellow's current third-placed standing would force them to fight for their League B status in the relegation playoffs, but there is ample time for Rebrov's men to turn the tide and contend for promotion to the top tier, which they briefly competed in during the 2020-21 edition.",
        "Czech Republic's -3 goal difference after one game leaves them in fourth place in their League B group."
