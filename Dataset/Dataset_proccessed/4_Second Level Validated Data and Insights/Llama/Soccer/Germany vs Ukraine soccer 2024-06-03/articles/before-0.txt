How Germany could line up against Ukraine

Germany will be missing the players involved in the 2024 Champions League final when they take to the field against Ukraine in a friendly on Monday night.

Antonio Rudiger and Toni Kroos helped Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund in the final of the European Cup on Saturday evening, so the pair will not be involved here.

The same can also be said for Dortmund pair Nico Schlotterbeck and Niclas Fullkrug, but all four are certainties to be named in Julian Nagelsmann's final squad for Euro 2024.

Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also not available for selection, so Manuel Neuer will start in goal.

There will be changes during Monday's friendly, but a strong XI is expected to take to the field for the first whistle, with Kai Havertz likely to operate through the middle.

Leroy Sane, Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz should also all start for Germany, while Ilkay Gundogan is likely to be joined in the middle of midfield by Robert Andrich.

Robin Koch could feature in the middle of the defence due to Rudiger's absence, while there is set to be just a third cap for Maximilian Mittelstadt at left-back.

Deniz Undav will be bidding to make just his second appearance for the national side, while there are four uncapped players currently in the squad, including Hoffenheim forward Maximilian Beier.

Germany possible starting lineup: Neuer; Kimmich, Tah, Koch, Mittelstadt; Gundogan, Andrich; Sane, Musiala, Wirtz; Havertz
