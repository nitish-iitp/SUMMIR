Both sides failed to win the opening match of Group B

Egypt narrowly avoided a shocking loss to Mozambique in their AFCON opener, salvaging a point with a late penalty goal from Mohamed Salah. Eager for their first win, they are expected to go all out against the Black Stars. Eintracht Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush eyes a start, and Al Ahly’s Mohamed Abdelmonem is a yellow card away from suspension.

Ghana faced defensive issues in a 2-1 loss to Cape Verde, prompting our bet on Salah and company. Ghana seems to be in mixed form with little effort to resolve the limited free flow of goals. It will cost them this time as the tournament is fired up and every big player in the continent is pushing for reaching the knockout stages.

When and where will Egypt vs Ghana take place?

The AFCON 2023 match between Egypt and Ghana will be on Thursday, 18th January 2024, 8:00 PM (GMT); Friday, 19th January 2024, 1:30 AM (IST) at Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium.
