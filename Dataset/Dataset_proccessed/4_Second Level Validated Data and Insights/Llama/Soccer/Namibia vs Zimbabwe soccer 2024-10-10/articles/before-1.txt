The Brave Warriors of Namibia are gearing up for a pivotal moment in their AFCON 2025 qualifying campaign, as they get set to take on the Warriors of Zimbabwe in back-to-back fixtures on Thursday 10 and Monday 14 October.

Head coach Collin Benjamin has unveiled his final squad for these crucial encounters, set to be held at the Orlando Stadium in South Africa.

The Brave Warriors will depart for South Africa tomorrow, carrying with them the hopes of a nation as they strive to secure a spot at the prestigious Africa Cup of Nations, to be held in Morocco from 21 December 2025 to 18 January 2026.

Coach Benjamin has made some interesting selections for these crucial fixtures, adding fresh faces to bolster his squad.

Vitapi Ngaruka makes his return to the national team, while Rivaldo Prins, Petrus Kamati and Mbakondja Tjahikika have also been included for their first call-ups in the qualifiers.

Reflecting on the squad, Benjamin emphasized the significance of these matches: "The games against Zimbabwe are make-or-break for us. We need to approach them with the same intensity and focus as we did in previous matches against Cameroon and Kenya. Every player will need to give their best as we aim to bring home positive results.”



Tough road ahead

Namibia’s qualification hopes have been thrown into uncertainty following their 2-1 “home” defeat against Kenya at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto, South Africa, earlier in September.

As it stands, the Brave Warriors still have to face Zimbabwe twice, before battling continental heavyweights Cameroon (at home) and Kenya (away) in their remaining fixtures.

With only two nations from each qualifying group securing a spot in the continental showpiece, Namibia will have to dig deep and muster all their strength and determination to turn their fortunes around.
