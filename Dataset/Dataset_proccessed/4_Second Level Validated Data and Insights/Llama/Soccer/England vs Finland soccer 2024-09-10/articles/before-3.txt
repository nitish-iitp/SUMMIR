England lineup vs. Finland: Predicted XI for UEFA Nations League clash

England captain Harry Kane is in line to win his 100th senior international cap in Tuesday's UEFA Nations League showdown with Finland at Wembley Stadium.

The Bayern Munich attacker made his 99th appearance for his country in Saturday's 2-0 victory over the Republic of Ireland, as Lee Carsley's interim reign got off to a flying start.

Kane was not at his creative and clinical best in Dublin, but the Three Lions skipper will almost certainly reach his landmark appearance from the first whistle, becoming just the 10th man in history to win 100 caps for England.

The former Tottenham Hotspur talisman may do so as part of an unchanged attacking quartet with Bukayo Saka, Anthony Gordon and Jack Grealish, the latter of whom struck England's second goal at his one-time home.

Grealish - a former Ireland youth international - had no qualms about celebrating in Dublin, but Declan Rice was far more reserved after returning to haunt the nation he made a handful of senior appearances for.

The Arsenal man - who also set up Grealish's strike at the Aviva Stadium - could link arms with Kobbie Mainoo in the midfield once more, unless Carsley decides that Conor Gallagher's fresh legs are needed.

The 50-year-old witnessed Trent Alexander-Arnold excel at right-back over the weekend after some mixed results in Gareth Southgate's midfield experiment, and the Liverpool star is poised to form Jordan Pickford's barrier alongside Marc Guehi, Harry Maguire and Levi Colwill once more.

England possible starting lineup:
Pickfrord; Alexander-Arnold, Guehi, Maguire, Colwill; Mainoo, Rice, Grealish; Saka, Kane, Gordon
