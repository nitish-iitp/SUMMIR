Greece will face Finland at the Georgios Karaiskakis on Saturday in the opening game of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign. The home side missed out on a spot in the European Championship after losing on penalties to Georgia in the playoffs final, prompting the exit of head coach Gus Poyet after two years at the helm.

They performed well in the Nations League back in 2022, picking up five wins from their six games and finishing atop their group as they secured promotion to League B. The home side will be looking to pick up where they left off in the tournament this week as they target a positive start to life under new boss Ivan Jovanovic.

Like their opponents, Finland participated in the European Championship playoffs but were knocked out in the semifinals by Wales. They then engaged in friendly action in their subsequent outings, most recently playing out a 2-2 draw against Scotland, with Benjamin Kallman and Oliver Antman netting second-half goals to secure a draw for Huuhkajat.
