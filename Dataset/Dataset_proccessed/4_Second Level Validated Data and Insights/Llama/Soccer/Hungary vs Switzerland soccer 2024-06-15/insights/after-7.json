    "Key Match Events": [
        "Hungary battled back after the break and halved the deficit through a Barnabas Varga header.",
        "Embolo punished Willi Orban for a misplaced header and lifted in a third on his first international appearance since the 2022 World Cup."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Yakin’s team were clever in not going toe-to-toe with Hungary’s physicality, knowing they would likely lose one-vs-one duels — instead they tempted Hungary’s defenders out of the line, Freuler and Xhaka manipulating them with their eyes like NFL quarterbacks.",
        "Switzerland’s attacking options are on the light side, to say the least, given that Breel Embolo is only just returning from a serious knee injury and Zeki Amdouni had a tricky season getting relegated from the Premier League with Burnley, albeit with moments of individual excellence."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Rossi said: ‘It’s hard to correct the kind of mistakes that we made today. Our players do not make mistakes like this every day (…) There aren’t many strategies to stop individual mistakes. It isn’t down to tactics, but we did struggle to communicate between us because of the way their forwards were playing. We fixed this at half-time, but by then we were 2-0 down.’",
        "Yakin said: ‘I liken football to chess, and today we got our tactics right. We used this formation for a reason. We focused on making the most of our strengths, and we made our opponents’ lives very hard in the first half. We thought they’d bring on (Bendeguz) Bolla to put us under pressure, and we did come under pressure, but we had fresh forwards to come on and hold the ball.’"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Switzerland’s first goal came after a 22-pass move, the third-longest build-up move in a European Championship since 1980.",
        "Embolo literally shedding the most obvious physical manifestation of his injury on his way to scoring is possibly about as good as you will get."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Switzerland got their Euro 2024 off to a winning start thanks to a hugely impressive first-half performance from Murat Yakin’s team — and a welcome late return from Breel Embolo."
