How Hungary could line up against Switzerland

Liverpool midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai is expected to start as captain for Hungary in their Euro 2024 Group A opener against Switzerland at the RheinEnergieStadion in Koln on Saturday afternoon.

The 23-year-old was forced off with a minor hamstring issue in Hungary's 3-0 friendly win over Israel last weekend, but his early withdrawal was merely for precautionary reasons and he is fit and raring to go to represent his country after missing Euro 2020 through injury.

Marco Rossi has no other injury concerns and is set to deploy a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Adam Lang, Willi Orban and Attila Szalai the most likely trio to start in a three-man defence protecting experienced goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi.

Spezia midfielder Adam Nagy, the most-capped player in Rossi's 26-man squad having made 81 international appearances, is set to link arms with Andras Schafer in the middle of the pitch as Loic Nego and Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez operate as wing-backs.

Szoboszlai recorded four goals and four assists in eight Euro 2024 qualifiers and is expected to take up an advanced midfield role alongside Roland Sallai, who is set to earn his 50th cap.

Barnabas Varga could be tasked with leading the line for Hungary; the 29-year-old scored 29 goals for Ferencvaros last season and most recently contributed to all three goals (two goals, one assist) in Hungary's aforementioned warm-up win over Israel.

Hungary possible starting lineup: Gulacsi; Lang, Orban, Szalai; Nego, A. Nagy, Schafer, Kerkez; Szoboszlai, Sallai; Vargas
