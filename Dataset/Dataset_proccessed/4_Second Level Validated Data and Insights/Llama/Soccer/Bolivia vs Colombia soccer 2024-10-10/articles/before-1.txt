Preview: Bolivia vs. Colombia - prediction, team news, lineups

Bolivia welcome Colombia to the aptly-named El Alto in their second game at their new home venue in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying on Thursday.

The hosts made the perfect start at their new home, which is even higher above sea level than the infamous Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, beating Venezuela 4-0 last month, while Colombia recorded a famous win over Argentina in Barranquilla.

While Bolivia will now prove an even tougher place to visit at the new venue, they also ended one of the longest competitive winless streaks last month to catapult them into qualification contention.

Their historic victory away in Chile was Bolivia's first on the road in qualifying in 67 matches, since a 7-1 win against Venezuela in 1993, the last time they were successful in reaching the World Cup finals.

Some may see that as a good omen, and considering how well they have recovered after losing their opening four qualifiers, they cannot be ruled out.

The appointment of Oscar Villegas was evidently an inspired one after he joined following their Copa America elimination in the summer, starting with two wins from two.

As is always the case, though, home form has to be near perfect if Bolivia have any chance of reaching the finals, with their next away outing coming against Argentina next week.

It would not be much of a surprise if Bolivia lost all of their remaining away games, so with 15 points still available on home soil, Villegas must hope his side can pick up close to maximum if they are to sneak into the top seven.

Seventh will be enough to reach the intercontinental playoffs, and Bolivia enter this window level on points with Paraguay, who currently occupy that position.

While home comforts are Bolivia's weapon, upcoming opponents Colombia will provide a massive test, given the run of form they are on under Nestor Lorenzo.

Los Cafeteros are still unbeaten inside 90 minutes under Lorenzo, who has now taken charge of 28 games, with the extra-time defeat in the Copa America final to Argentina the only blemish on his record.

Colombia avenged that defeat by beating the Albiceleste in their last outing, and it was timed perfectly, as they went into the game on the back of an underwhelming 1-1 draw with a Peru side that sit bottom of the standings.

That leaves Colombia just two points behind Argentina, and a very comfortable seven points clear in the automatic qualification places, so it looks likely they will return to the world stage after missing the 2022 finals in Qatar.

Maintaining a strong recent record against Bolivia will take them one step closer to achieving that, as Colombia are unbeaten in their last 13 meetings with their upcoming opponents - winning 10.

Like so many though, they do struggle in the altitude, having won on just two of their last eight visits, and a 4-0 loss in La Paz in 2003 was a particularly low point, but Lorenzo will hope their first trip to El Alto will go much better, especially considering Colombia did beat Bolivia away in 2011 and 2016.

Team News

Bolivia have one of the youngest and inexperienced squads in South America, made to look even more so by the fact that 37-year-old goalkeeper Carlos Lampe is currently out injured after going off in their win over Chile last month.

Henry Vaca is also on the sidelines for the hosts, but their fresh squad members are certainly finding their feet at this level, even though just one member of the squad has over 40 caps, and 12 of the 28 have two or less.

Colombian supporters will have been glad to see Luis Diaz kept in reserve by Liverpool at the weekend, but they were quickly left disappointed, as right-back Daniel Munoz broke down with a muscule issue just minutes into the same game for Crystal Palace, and has been forced to withdraw.

Diaz and Jhon Duran have been in spectacular form in the Premier League this season, and the latter is now fully expected to take over from Jhon Cordoba as the central striker for his national side.

Captain James Rodriguez is not getting many minutes at Rayo Vallecano, but that never seems to affect his levels for Los Cafeteros, as his man-of-the-match performance against Argentina showed.


Bolivia possible starting lineup:
Viscarra; Medina, Haquin, Suarez, Sagredo; Robson Matheus, E. Vaca, Villamil; Miguelito, Algaranaz, Fernandez

Colombia possible starting lineup:
Vargas; S. Arias, Mina, Lucumi, Mojica; Rios, Lerma, J. Arias; James, Duran, Diaz


We say: Bolivia 1-3 Colombia

If Colombia can get to grips with the altitude at El Alto, then they undoubtedly have the quality to see off this Bolivia side, and keep the pressure on Argentina at the top of the standings.

After a surprise three points on the road last month, Bolivia will be seeking a fourth win in five qualifiers, but Colombia are yet to lose in regular time under Lorenzo, and even with their significant home advantage, it looks an unlikely outcome.
