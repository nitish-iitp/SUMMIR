Mets rebound again with crucial rubber-game win over Diamondbacks

PHOENIX — Rounding the bases, his game-tying homer in the sixth punctuating an 11-pitch war at the plate, Francisco Lindor couldn’t hold it in.

“Hell yeah,” he screamed. “Hell yeah!”

In the season of “Oh My God,” Thursday was a “Hell yeah” kind of win for the Mets — a get-back-on-your-feet, get-back-on-the-horse, resilient rebuttal following Wednesday’s setback. Thanks to Lindor’s home run, thanks to David Peterson’s escapability, thanks to Jose Iglesias putting the ball in play and Edwin Díaz putting the past behind him, the Mets beat the Diamondbacks 3-2.

They won this three-game series against Arizona and have started this crucial 10-game road trip with a 4-3 mark. They finish the trip in Chicago against a White Sox team on a historically poor pace.

“Huge win, especially winning it the way we did,” manager Carlos Mendoza said. “Find a way — we’ve shown it before, and we continue to do it.”

Lindor’s home run was the first spark in the later innings. Ryne Nelson had won their first two encounters with strikeouts, Lindor unable to do more than foul the ball off. That’s what he kept doing the third time around as well, fouling back five two-strike pitches.

“I get paid to hit the ball forward, you know?” he said afterward.

So when he did, when he rocketed Nelson’s 11th pitch and fifth changeup of the confrontation to right field, Lindor immediately pumped his arms.

“That was pure emotion,” he said.

It was the same emotion Peterson showed in the bottom of the seventh. A Jeff McNeil error had helped Arizona put runners on the corners with one out. Peterson’s season has been defined by his ability to navigate such traffic. When catcher Luis Torrens visited him on the mound, he came with reassurance.

“We’re going to get a double play,” he said. “How do you want to do it?”

The answer was a sinker at the knees, rolled over to Iglesias at third and around the horn to end the inning. Peterson clapped his hand into his glove, another seven-inning gem in the books.

The Mets snagged the lead in the ninth off Arizona closer Justin Martinez and his 101 mph fastball. Jesse Winker doubled to left-center, and with pinch runner Tyrone Taylor on third and two outs, Iglesias did what he does best: He put the ball in play. It caromed off the glove of a diving Geraldo Perdomo at short and into center field to score Taylor.

Iglesias is 9-for-18 this season with two outs and a runner in scoring position.

“He wants to be in those spots,” Mendoza said.

That all set the stage for Díaz to secure the win. Not 18 hours earlier, he’d let a potentially energizing win slip away with a pair of walks and a Corbin Carroll grand slam. So Díaz had arrived early to the park on Thursday to meet with pitching coach Jeremy Hefner, to work on the mechanical flaw that had undone his past two outings. His motion had been listing toward third base at the start, Díaz said, causing his fastball to miss up and arm-side. He needed to be more direct to home plate.

Direct described Díaz’s approach on the mound as well. Following the lead of Francisco Alvarez, Díaz threw 17 fastballs in 18 pitches. He retired the heart of the Arizona lineup in order. He looked like Edwin Díaz.

“We saw Sugar tonight,” said Peterson.

“In order for us to get to where we want to get, we need him,” said Mendoza.

“We’re playing playoff games and this team needs me,” Díaz said. “I’ve got to do my job.”

These have indeed become playoff games for the Mets. A solid start to the road trip is a few outs away from being a remarkable one. Even so, there’s more opportunity ahead with a weekend against the league-worst White Sox. Chicago is 4-37 in its past 41 games.

“We are close,” Díaz said. “We’re really close.”
