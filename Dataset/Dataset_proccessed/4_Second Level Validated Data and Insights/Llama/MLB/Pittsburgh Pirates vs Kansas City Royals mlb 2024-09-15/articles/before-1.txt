Kansas City Royals vs Pittsburgh Pirates Prediction

I’ll try the Royals here. Singer is just 0-1 over his last three starts. That said he hasn’t been pitching too badly. In that time Singer has seven total earned runs in 16.2 innings. As for Jones, he’s given up five earned over his last two starts in 13.1 innings of work.

On Saturday the Royals had a couple of big offensive performances (specifically Bobby Witt’s three RBI) but a handful of bats were fairly quiet otherwise in the victory. Still, I like KC to finish off the sweep with a Sunday win.
