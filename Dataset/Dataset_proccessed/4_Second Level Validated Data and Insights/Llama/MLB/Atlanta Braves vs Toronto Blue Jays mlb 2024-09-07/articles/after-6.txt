13 SECONDS REMAINING

ATLANTA -- Blue Jays rookie Spencer Horwitz had a field day against another rookie who shares the same first name.

Horwitz tallied three RBIs on three extra-base hits -- two solo homers and an RBI double -- against Braves starting pitcher Spencer Schwellenbach in Toronto’s 9-5 win at Truist Park on Saturday night.

Horwitz added a ninth-inning single to finish the night 4-for-5. It was Horwitz’s first career four-hit game.

“I have to give credit to [assistant hitting coach] Matt Hague,” Horwitz said. “I’ve been working with him for two years and we have a great bag of tricks that we can lean on that we’ve built. We’re doing [drills] working on my tightness to make sure I can pull the ball the right way. It showed today.”

Horwitz gave Toronto the lead when he hit a Statcast-projected 420-foot homer over the center-field wall in the top of the second, before sending a 421-foot blast into the right-field bleachers in the top of the fourth.

Blue Jays manager John Schneider did not say whether he’ll start the left-handed-hitting Horwitz against NL Cy Young favorite (and left-hander) Chris Sale on Sunday.

“I plead the fifth on that one,” Schneider said. “Tonight, [there were] really good at-bats from [Horwitz]. Schwellenbach has good stuff. But up and down, [there were] good at-bats. Lefties handled [Schwellenbach] really well. We’ll see what [Sunday] brings. If [Horwitz] isn’t starting he’ll probably make an impact somehow.”

After the two homers, Horwitz continued his perfect night at the plate against Schwellenbach with an RBI double in the fifth, driving in Vladimir Guerrero Jr. from first. Guerrero, who went 1-for-5 with an RBI on Saturday, is hitting .408 since the All-Star break. Horwitz said he benefits from hitting behind Guerrero in the order.

“I have a really great teacher right in front of me in Vladdy,” Horwitz said. “I’m watching what he’s doing and kind of baiting pitchers to do certain things and the way he’ll take certain pitches. We’ve talked about it. I’m learning from the guys around me and having some experience.”

Schwellenbach allowed a career-worst 10 hits over five innings. He allowed six runs, but three of them were unearned as the Braves committed two errors, both of which led to runs.

“I knew he had a really good fastball,” Horwitz said of Schwellenbach. “He’s 95 to 98 and the metrics on it are a little different. It plays really hard because of his extension. … I was most geared up for his fastball at all times.”

Horwitz hit his first homer on a slider and his second on a 96.2 mph fastball.

“To hit multiple pitches out in your first two [at-bats] says a lot,” Schneider said. “[Horwitz] can cover the top of the zone, too.”

It was Horwitz’s second multi-homer game of his career -- his first was on June 23 in Cleveland -- and was the first time he’s had three extra-base hits in a game.

“It’s great and a byproduct of hard work,” Horwitz said. “I can’t give enough credit to Matt Hague again. I truly am so grateful for him and what he’s done for me. He means a lot to me.”

José Berríos, meanwhile, earned his 15th win of the season as he allowed one run on five hits over six innings. It was Berríos’ team-leading 19th quality start of the season.

“José is a machine,” Horwitz said. “He goes out there and gives us typically six to seven quality innings at least, and I know I wouldn’t want to face him because game-planning would be really difficult. He’s throwing four or five pitches at you. That’s what he does so well, is give batters so many different looks.”

Berríos’ 15 wins are tied for the third-most in the Majors, along with Seth Lugo of the Royals. Cy Young favorites Sale and Tarik Skubal of the Tigers lead the league with 16 apiece.

“Finally I got [to] 15 [wins],” Berríos said. “I have a goal for myself to try to [get] 20 one year. We’re keeping track of that. There is nothing better than winning. I don’t care what kind of [stats] they use for [wins]. No matter how, as a team, we have to win. When we win, it’s fun. Every win I’m [going to] celebrate.”
