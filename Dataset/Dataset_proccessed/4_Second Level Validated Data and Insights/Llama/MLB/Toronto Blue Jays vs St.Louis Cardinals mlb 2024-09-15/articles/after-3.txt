Sunday’s Game Report: Blue Jays 3, Cardinals 2

By Rob Rains

Mile Mikolas turned in a much better start for the Cardinals on Sunday than he had in his last several outings, but found out again that it’s hard for a pitcher to win when his team doesn’t hit.

Mikolas allowed a two-run homer in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals offense was shut down again as the Blue Jays completed a sweep of the three-game series in Toronto.

Mikolas had allowed at least three runs in seven of his previous eight starts. His last win came on July 21.

The Cardinals scored a total of seven runs in the three games in the series and had a combined total of two hits in 27 at-bats with a runner in scoring position.

The loss dropped the Cardinals back below .500 for the season at 74-75 with 13 games remaining.

Here is how Sunday’s game broke down:

At the plate: Jordan Walker had an RBI double and Lars Nootbaar homered to account for the Cardinals’ two runs … Walker was stranded on second in the fifth when Michael Siani lined back to the pitcher and Brendan Donovan struck out … Nootbaar’s 10th homer of the year tied the game in the seventh … The Cardinals threatened in the ninth when Luken Baker led off the inning with  single and with two outs Thomas Saggese beat out an infield hit but Walker popped out on the first pitch to end the game … They were hitless in five at-bats with a runner on second. The twp runners that scored were the only ones to touch third.

On the mound: Mikolas is 0-3 with six no-decisions in his last nine starts … He allowed just one hit through the first four innings, but hit a batter leading off the fifth in front of a two-run homer by Davis Schneider … Mikolas was lifted after the inning despite only throwing 72 pitches … Steven Matz worked two scoreless innings of relief but in the eighth, Andrew Kittredge allowed a one-out single before Nathan Lukes hit his second double of the game to drive in the go-ahead run. Kittredge had not allowed a run in his previous 11 appearances.

Key stat: Nolan Arenado had a single in four at-bats and in the series was 2-of-11 with both of the hits singles. He is 9-of-47 in 13 games this month with seven singles, one double and one home run, driving in three runs.

Worth noting: The Cardinals only scored four or more runs in three of their 13 games so far in September … Paul Goldschmidt and Masyn Winn got the day off although Goldschmidt hit into a double play as a pinch-hitter in the eighth and played first in the bottom of the inning … The Cardinals have been held without a hit with a runner in scoring position in five of their last nine games, going a combined 7-of-64 in those games.

Looking ahead: The Cardinals return to Busch Stadium on Monday night to begin the final homestand of the regular season with the first of four games against the Pirates. Andre Pallante is set to start against Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes in the opener.
