PHILADELPHIA - The Atlanta Braves clinched their sixth straight NL East title, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 on Wednesday night behind Spencer Strider’s major league-leading 17th win and Austin Riley’s two-run homer.

Kirby Yates struck out Brandon Marsh to end the game and the players danced in a mob near the mound as Phillies fans booed them off the field.

"Congratulations Atlanta Braves 2023 NL East Champions" flashed on the scoreboard.

Braves earn sixth-straight NL East title

With a 4-1 win in Philadelphia, the Atlanta Braves have won their sixth-straight National League East divisional crown.

Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. responded to booing fans by raising both arms and signaling with his hands to bring it on.

"We’ve checked one box," manager Brian Snitker said.

Atlanta (96-50) clinched in 146 games, their second-quickest clinch in the divisional era. The division title was the Braves’ record 26th, two more than the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees.

The magic number was two going into Wednesday night, but something else to watch was Matt Olson, fresh of his 51st homer Tuesday night, which tied Andruw Jones' single-season Braves record.

The Braves have seemingly made winning the East a rite of September since the 1990s and this year’s team looks loaded enough to win their third World Series since moving from Milwaukee to Atlanta in 1966. Over that span, Atlanta won 11 straight NL East titles from 1995-2005, and the World Series in 1995 and 2021.

Yates earned his fifth save.

Atlanta took special satisfaction in clinching on the same Citizens Bank Park field where the Phillies eliminated them last October in the NL Division Series. The Phillies won that series 3-1 -- just as Atlanta won this four-game set.

The Phillies lead the NL wild card and the teams could face each other in October.

For now, September belongs to the Braves.

Riley, one of many big boppers in the lineup, gave the Braves all the runs they needed when he connected off Cristopher Sánchez (2-4) in the first for his 35th homer. Sanchez struck out a career-best 10 in 7 1/3 innings.

Riley had a sacrifice fly in the third and Kevin Pillar added an RBI double in the fourth for a 4-1 lead.

Strider (17-5) took it from there and won for the fifth time in six starts, allowing one run and four hits in seven innings. Strider struck out nine to boost his MLB-best total to 259. He also gave the bullpen some needed rest after a rough first three games in Philly that included Raisel Iglesias surrendering tying homers in the ninth inning in two of them.

That the Braves had the mettle to rebound and win on the road from the crushing blows is just one more reason why they just might be the team to beat in the postseason.

The Braves super sluggers

Riley became the third Braves player to reach 35 homers, joining Matt Olson (51) and Acuña (37). The Braves are tied for most players with 35 homers in a season on one team in MLB history.

Phillies manager Rob Thomson said it would be a "pleasant surprise" if injured first baseman Rhys Hoskins was able to return in the postseason. Hoskins has tried to remain optimistic that he could play after he suffered a torn ACL in his left knee in spring training. Hoskins is playing on a $12 million, one-year contract and may have played his last game with Philadelphia.

Hoskins will continue to hit off a tee on the road trip in St. Louis. Hoskins hit 30 homers with 79 RBIs last season for the NL champions.

Braves put another feather in cap of amazing season

The Braves were met with sparkling wine and beer in the visitors' clubhouse of Citizens Bank Park after stepping off the field.

It was a typical celebration, but many players say it felt extra special after last season.

The Braves currently lead the MLB in wins. 

The Braves are on pace to finish with 106 wins, which would tie the 1998 braves for the most wins in the franchise’s nearly 150-year history. 

Atlanta won 28 of 33 games between May 31 to July 8 to build a 9 1/2-game lead and win Wednesday night by 17 games.

This time last year, it was a little stressful down the stretch with the Braves and Mets neck-and-neck, but for a guy like Sean Murphy who came to Atlanta this offseason, this one is pretty sweet, especially since it was this very field where the Braves were eliminated last year in the postseason.

The title clinch comes two days after the Braves were the first to clinch a spot in the postseason and a day after slugger Matt Olsen tied the franchise’s single-season home run record.

It puts another cap in the hat for the Braves who have seen such accomplishments as Ronald Acuña becoming the first 30/60 player in baseball history.

What's next for the Braves?

The Braves are off as they head to Florida for a three-game set with the Marlins. The Braves send RHP Bryce Elder (12-4, 3.38 ERA) to the mound. The Marlins have not named a starter.
