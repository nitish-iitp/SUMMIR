        "Nestor Cortes Jr. will throw for the first time since going on the injured list on Sept. 25 with a left elbow flexor strain.",
        "Cortes will make between 20 and 30 throws during the off day following the Yankees' win over the Kansas City Royals in Game 1 of the American League Division Series on Saturday and before Monday's Game 2.",
        "Cortes didn't rule himself out for a potential return in the AL Championship Series, which would begin Oct. 14, though it seems unlikely.",
        "Cortes will be a free agent after next season. He's making $3.9 million this year via salary arbitration.",
        "The Yankees had gone into late September seemingly leaning toward using Cortes out of the bullpen in the playoffs. He went 9-10 with a 3.77 ERA in 31 games (30 starts).",
        "Cortes has made 49 relief appearances in his career. The Yankees surely project him to be part of their starting rotation in 2025."
