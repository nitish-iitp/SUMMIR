BALTIMORE — On their way to losing for the 109th time this season en route to what likely will be the most defeats in MLB history, the White Sox seemingly have demonstrated a hundred ways to get beat.

They lost to the Orioles 9-0 on Tuesday at Camden Yards. They were shut out for the 16th time, and the game was decided early and in reckless, uncontrolled fashion.

Rookie right-hander Nick Nastrini walked six batters, needing 72 pitches to record five outs, and exited trailing 7-0 in the second inning. In his first start since allowing one run in six innings Thursday against the Rangers, Nastrini threw four pitches to the backstop — two of them in the dirt and two over catcher Korey Lee’s head.
