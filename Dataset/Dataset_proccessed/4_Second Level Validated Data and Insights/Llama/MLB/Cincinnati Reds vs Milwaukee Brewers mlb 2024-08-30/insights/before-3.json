        "Rhett Lowder, the Reds #4 prospect, is being called up to pitch on Friday night against the Milwaukee Brewers.",
        "Lowder has a good mix of a 4-seamer, 2-seamer, slider, and change up.",
        "He has good stuff across the board, but nothing is elite.",
        "His slider is probably his best pitch, working in the mid-80's with downward, biting action.",
        "His location is something to keep an eye on, as he has had good control all year but not always good command."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Reds are literally running out of starting pitching options both in the big leagues and in Triple-A.",
        "Lowder has been called up to help fill the gap in the rotation.",
        "The team is hoping to see a good performance from Lowder in his debut."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Lowder's ceiling is not as low as a #4 starter, and he could have a long, profitable career with an AS appearance or 2.",
        "The Reds could have signed Cueto instead of Bailey, but they chose not to.",
        "The team is considering going young and not signing a big free agent starter for 2025.",
        "Lowder will likely be the 27th man for Friday's doubleheader, but it's unclear if he'll stick in the rotation."
