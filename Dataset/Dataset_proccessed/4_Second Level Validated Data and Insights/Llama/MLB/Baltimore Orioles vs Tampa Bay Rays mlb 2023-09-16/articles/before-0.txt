Adam Jones officially retires, passes torch to Orioles’ new generation of players

BALTIMORE — Before there was Adley, Gunnar, Grayson and Heston there was Matt, Nick, Manny and Adam. Wieters, Markakis, Machado and Jones were names synonymous with Baltimore baseball for the better part of a decade, including a five-year stretch where the Orioles went from bottom dweller to the playoffs three times and won the American League East in 2014.

Wieters was like Rutschman, the highly-touted catcher whose debut was damn near a Baltimore holiday. Markakis was the quiet, hard-nosed player who set the tone for guys to play hard and play every day. Machado was the hotshot rookie, a talent brought up late in the season — not unlike Heston Kjerstad — to help the team’s first playoff push in years.

And Jones? He became the heartbeat, the outspoken leader who wasn’t drafted by the Orioles like the other three. He was traded from the Seattle Mariners in a 2008 deal for starter Erik Bedard that would later go down as an O’s coup.

Jones was the guy for 11 years who was by his locker after every tough loss, who spoke his mind and voiced his frustrations and watched Markakis and Wieters leave and saw the Orioles trade Machado. Even with the team dismantled, Jones still blocked a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies in 2018, his final season with the Orioles. (It was a decision that splintered relations with ownership.) He wanted to stay in Baltimore. Given a choice, Jones — who signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks the following season — always wanted to stay. He wasn’t a Diamondback or an Orix Buffalo, the Nippon Professional Baseball team in Japan where he finished out his career. Jones belonged in the black-and-orange, in a place that loved him, understood him and idolized him.

“He’s an adopted son in a lot of ways for the city,” said executive vice president of baseball operations Mike Elias, who signed Jones to a one-day contract on Friday so he could officially retire as an Oriole. “He chose to be here.”

Jones peppered jokes into his always poignant candor in speaking to the media on Friday: how he still doesn’t like Berger cookies and understands that Elias is a busy man who doesn’t have time to do things like, ahem, come on Jones’ podcast. (He also made it clear that his work for the commissioner’s office still leaves him contractually open to work for a team, if anyone should come calling.) Jones ran out from center field with his two sons August and Axel, stopping midway to catch his breath and a laugh amid thunderous applause from a soldout crowd on its feet.

But when it got serious, you could tell how much this moment mattered to Jones, who along with his wife, Audie, poured money into building Boys & Girls Clubs and YMCA’s. He was so integral to the city that Baltimore’s Mayor Brandon Scott officially declared Friday Adam Jones Day.

Jones’ legacy isn’t just baseball, but don’t think Jones doesn’t notice every fan who is wearing No. 10. His brother-in-law, who lives in the area, still texts him photos of Jones’ jersey around town.

“My final time putting on a jersey will be here,” Jones said. “I’m forever grateful for what Baltimore has taught me. And I’m just glad I will always be welcomed in this city. People here appreciated the way I carried myself, played the game and gave back.”

And not just with the fans. Jones’ ceremony brought a dozen former Orioles players and staff back to Camden Yards, including Markakis — who caught Jones’ first pitch — Chris Davis, Darren O’Day, Tommy Hunter, Wei-Yin Chen and Mychal Givens. Others — including Wieters, Trey Mancini, Ryan Flaherty and J.J. Hardy — offered congratulations in a video compilation that also featured Jones’ good friend CC Sabathia.

A five-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glover in Baltimore, Jones ranks first in Oriole Park history in games played, hits, home runs, doubles, at-bats, runs, total bases, RBIs and extra-base hits. He was named Most Valuable Oriole thrice and amassed a 32.6 WAR over 14 big-league seasons.

For many fans, Jones and the Orioles players who stood along the home dugout to honor him represented a return to prominence for a downtrodden franchise that hadn’t had a playoff berth since 1997. They played with grit and an us-against-the-world mentality, especially in 2012, when perhaps no one outside of Baltimore believed the Orioles were for real. Eleven years later, another gutsy team is turning heads in Baltimore, fighting to win the American League East when no one expected them to.

“It’s perfect,” Elias said of the timing of Jones’ retirement, amid a sellout first-place battle between the Orioles and Rays with a playoff-like atmosphere. “Somebody who had a tremendous career, someone who was the face of the last great era of Orioles baseball and I’m very confident in saying we are into another one, so to have him here for that is so important.”
