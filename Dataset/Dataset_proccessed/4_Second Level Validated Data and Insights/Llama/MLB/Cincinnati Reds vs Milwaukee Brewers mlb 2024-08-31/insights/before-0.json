        "Rhett Lowder made his major league debut, allowing just one run on a pair of hits with six strikeouts and four walks in four innings, as the Cincinnati Reds fell to the Milwaukee Brewers 14-0 in the second game of a doubleheader."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Rhett Lowder was surprisingly more confident than he thought he'd be before his debut, and he said he felt like he was making good pitches despite walking two batters in the first inning."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Reds manager David Bell said it was fun to watch Lowder compete exactly the way they want, and he was out there trying to get it done. He also said that Lowder's 77 pitches were not far from the max the team had planned for him."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Lowder used all four of his pitches, throwing 26 four-seam fastballs, 21 sinkers, 17 sliders, and 13 changeups. He got four whiffs on his slider and two on each of his other three pitches for 10 total to go along with 15 called strikes."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Lowder will likely get his next start against the Houston Astros before taking the road and getting his first taste of pitching in an opposing stadium."
