With their series against the Miami Marlins tied at 1-1, Shohei Ohtani stepped up on Thursday evening and delivered one of the greatest offensive displays in MLB history. Batting at the top of the Dodgers lineup, the Japanese slugger was matched up against Marlins' Edward Cabrera on the mound.

Ohtani started the night with a double towards right field and stole third base, his 50th stolen base of the season. He then scored on a Will Smith sacrifice fly, giving the Dodgers an early 1-0 lead in the first inning.

In his second and third at-bats in the following innings, Ohtani hit a RBI single and followed it up with a two-run double in the third inning. In the sixth inning, he was already 3-for-3 as he stepped up to face Geroge Soriano and took the Marlins pitcher to stands with a two-run home run. Having blasted his 49th homer of the season, Shohei Ohtani's fifth plate appearance came in the seventh inning and he delivered what everyone was waiting to see: his 50th home run of the campaign.

Ohtani's two-run blast in the seventh gave the Dodgers a 14-3 lead on the evening and pretty much took the game away from the Marlins. However, the slugger was not done yet. In the ninth inning, Ohtani stepped up for his sixth plate appearance.

Facing Marlins infielder Vidal Brujan, the two-time MVP blasted yet another home run, this time a three-run hit, to record his 51st home run of the season. Shohei Ohtani ended the night going 6-for-6, with three home runs, ten RBI and two stolen bases, many calling it the greatest offensive display ever seen in the majors.

Shohei Ohtani receives high praise from MLB Commissioner after historic feat

In a game that has been played for over 200 years, there have hardly been players like Shohei Ohtani. Having already established himself as a unique two-way player in his first six years in the MLB, he has made slugging history in a season where he is recovering from Tommy John surgery.

As the entire baseball world congratulated Ohtani on his achievement, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred also joined in, saying:

“On behalf of Major League Baseball, I congratulate Shohei on this remarkable achievement. We are proud that he continues to take our game to new heights.”

Los Angeles Dodgers' emphatic 20-4 win over the Miami Marlins also secured their place in the playoffs in just 91 games played. Having broken multiple records over the season, Ohtani will undoubtedly also be focused on the ultimate prize: lifting the World Series title.
