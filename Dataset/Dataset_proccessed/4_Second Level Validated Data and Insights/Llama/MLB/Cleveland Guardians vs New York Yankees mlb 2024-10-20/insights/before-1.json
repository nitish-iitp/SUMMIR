        "Guardians manager Stephen Vogt expressed his unwavering support for Emmanuel Clase, saying 'Emmanuel will be right back out there in the ninth tonight. Because he's our guy.'"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Vogt said, 'He responded the way I thought he would. This is the best closer on the planet. I'll stand by that.'",
        "Vogt also said, 'You want to take him back out there, but he had thrown 60 pitches over the last three days. Had we won tonight, we had two more games to go, and you can’t overextend these guys and have them throw 75 or 80 pitches in three days. That’s not right.'"
