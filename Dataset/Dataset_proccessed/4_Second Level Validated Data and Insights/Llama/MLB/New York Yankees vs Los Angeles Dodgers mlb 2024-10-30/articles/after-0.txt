The Los Angeles Dodgers beat the New York Yankees 7-6 in Game 5 on Wednesday to win the World Series four games to one.

The Dodgers were trailing 5-0 before they scored five runs in the fifth inning — all of which came in the wake of three fielding miscues by the Yankees. New York retook the lead in the sixth inning, but two sacrifice flies by Los Angeles in the top of the eighth put the visitors ahead for good.

“We just took advantage of every mistake that they made that inning,” Dodgers outfielder Teoscar Hernández said of the fifth. “We put some good at-bats together. We put the ball in play. A lot of people say ‘when you put the ball in play, things might happen.’ It happened to us in that inning, and we scored five runs.”

First baseman Freddie Freeman won World Series MVP, hitting four homers and driving in 12 runs across the five games. Freeman homered once each in the first four games of the series.

“Every spring training this is our goal,” Freeman said after the win. “For it to come true with this group of guys, I couldn’t ask for a better year. Holy cow.” 

The Dodgers have won two World Series in the last five years, having also won during the pandemic-shortened season in 2020. Los Angeles’ last title after a full season was in 1988.

The Dodgers were dominant both in the batter’s box and on the mound during their postseason run.

Los Angeles beat the New York Mets in six games in the National League championship series, outscoring the Mets by a combined 37-7 in the four wins.

Against the Yankees, the Dodgers’ pitching staff continued to stifle a high-powered lineup, as Los Angeles held New York — which finished third in MLB with 815 runs in the regular season — to only seven runs combined in the first three games of the series.

Several players on this year’s Dodgers team were also on the World Series team in 2020, including Mookie Betts, Max Muncy, Kiké Hernández and Walker Buehler. Freeman won a title with the Atlanta Braves in 2021.

It’s the third championship for manager Dave Roberts, who led Los Angeles in 2020 and also won once as a player in 2004 with the Boston Red Sox.

“This team has zero quit in it,” Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen said postgame. “If we don’t have the outcome that we want, there are always guys out there picking each other up and challenging ourselves to be better. That’s why we won tonight.”

Meanwhile, it’s the first World Series win for Los Angeles superstar Shohei Ohtani, the presumptive NL MVP, who signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers before the season. Ohtani had not appeared in the playoffs before this year. He deferred $680 million of his salary in part to help the franchise spend more around him.

The Yankees won 94 games during the regular season, best in the American League. Center fielder Aaron Judge, who hit 58 home runs and drove in 144 runs during the regular season, is expected to win AL MVP. But he struggled in the postseason, hitting only .184 with three homers in 14 games.

New York has not won a World Series since 2009.

What a comeback for Los Angeles in Game 5, which trailed 5-0 before a five-run fifth inning.

Apparently five is their lucky number.

Yankees threaten but don't score

After a disastrous top of the fifth, the Yankees managed a two-out rally that had the bases loaded but didn't lead to any runs.

It started with a single from the suddenly hot Anthony Volpe before Austin Wells got hit by a pitch and Alex Verdugo walked.

Gleyber Torres then sent one to right field but Mookie Betts caught it easily and Dodgers pitcher Alex Vesia worked out of trouble.

We're still tied at five.

While Yankees fans enjoyed the effort, they also held their breaths remembering last year when Judge ran through the right field fence at Dodger Stadium. That herculean effort injured his right foot and derailed the team's season.

What’s the record for home runs in a single World Series? Where Freddie Freeman ranks

NBC Los Angeles

The Los Angeles Dodgers star extended his historic World Series home run streak to six games last night, hitting a two-run shot off New York Yankees starter Luis Gil in the first inning of Game 4.

The eight-time All-Star, who homered in the final two games of the Atlanta Braves’ 2021 World Series win over the Houston Astros, is the first player to go yard in six consecutive games in the Fall Classic overall.

Freeman is now one home run away from tying the record for the most homers by a player in a single World Series. There have been three players who recorded five homers in a single World Series, with Reggie Jackson first doing so in the Yankees’ 1977 World Series triumph over the Dodgers.

Chase Utley matched Jackson’s mark in the Philadelphia Phillies‘ 2009 World Series loss to the Yankees before George Springer had a five-homer showing in the Astros’ 2017 World Series win against the Dodgers.

Freeman’s four homers against New York are tied for fourth with several players, including Barry Bonds and Babe Ruth.

World Series Game 3 averages 13.64 million, beats ‘Monday Night Football’

The Associated Press

The World Series beat “Monday Night Football” in the battle for television viewers.

The Los Angeles Dodgers’ 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the Fall Classic averaged 13.64 million viewers on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming according to early numbers by Nielsen. That beat the 13.4 million that tuned in for the Pittsburgh Steelers’ 26-18 win over the New York Giants on ABC, ESPN, ESPN Deportes, ESPN2 and streaming.

The audience for Yankees-Dodgers peaked at 14.25 million from 9-9:15 p.m. EDT. It was the most-watched Game 3 since 2018, when the Dodgers’ 18-inning victory over the Red Sox averaged 13.3 million.

It is Fox’s most-viewed prime-time telecast on a Monday since Game 5 of the 2013 Series between Boston and St. Louis (14.45 million).

“Last night two fans were ejected from Yankee Stadium for egregious and unacceptable physical contact with Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts,” the Yankees said in a statement Wednesday. “The safety and security of players, fans and Stadium staff is the foundational element of every event held at Yankee Stadium, and it cannot be compromised.”

Reporting from OSHU CITY, Japan

In Oshu, the small rural town where Shohei Ohtani grew up, baseball is as much a part of the landscape as the farmers’ fields and low-rise hills surrounding it. The area has long been known for its beef and ironwork. Now it’s famous for Ohtani.

Local officials have organized watch parties at community centers in the area where people are given inflatable sticks saying “Shohei Ohtani — The Pride of Oshu City” to wave when cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar as his team takes on the New York Yankees in Ohtani’s first World Series.

As they watched Game 4, which aired at 9 a.m. Wednesday morning in Japan, Yasuo Sakamoto, 74, and his wife Keiko, 70, wore the Dodgers jerseys and hats they got when they visited Los Angeles this summer to see Ohtani play.

“Even at my age, I’m really awed by him,” Yasuo Sakamoto said of Ohtani. “In Japan when there’s news about Ohtani, it’s bright news. If they win, it’s going to be even brighter.”
