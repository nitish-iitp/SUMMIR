Pittsburgh Pirates vs New York Yankees Prediction 

New York lost the first game in this series and lost two out of three against Baltimore before this series, but they have locked up the AL East and are playing for seeding now. The Yankees are 43-36 at home this year, while the Pirates are 36-43 on the road. Pittsburgh is starting Paul Skenes, who has been absolutely fantastic since being called up. New York will answer with Luis Gil, who has also had a very nice season. I don’t love going against Skenes, but Gil has been more than serviceable and I will back New York at home.
