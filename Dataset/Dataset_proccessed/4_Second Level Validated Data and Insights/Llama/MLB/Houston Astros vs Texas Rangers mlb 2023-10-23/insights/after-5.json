        "Catcher Jonah Heim said, “That’s baseball justice,” he said. “They’re booing him all game, and he puts the game on ice. I don’t know how you can boo someone for getting hit, but it is what it is, and he quieted them pretty quickly there.”",
        "Outfielder Travis Jankowski added, “The environment he played in tonight wasn’t the easiest one, but it’s one of those things. In any big situation, I’m picking him.”",
        "Third baseman Josh Jung was stunned to hear Garcia was the first to do it, saying, “Wow. That’s awesome.” But he also said, “It’s not fun getting booed all game. Then to silence the crowd in the ninth gives him confidence going into tomorrow, because it’s gonna be the same thing.”"
