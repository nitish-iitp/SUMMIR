Hunter Goodman homers twice, including late tiebreaking slam, and Rockies beat the Cubs 9-5

DENVER -- — Hunter Goodman hit two home runs, including a tiebreaking grand slam in the eighth inning, and the Colorado Rockies came back to beat the Chicago Cubs 9-5 on Friday night.

Goodman, a rookie catcher and outfielder who is part of the Rockies' ongoing youth movement, finished with three hits and a career-high seven RBI. It was the first seven-RBI game by a Rockies player since Elías Díaz also had seven on Sept. 9, 2022 against Arizona.

“They’re wanting to make a statement, letting us know that they’re major league players, and a night like this from Goodie helps his cause,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “He has power. Showed up in the minor leagues and he has 11 (homers) here and 150 or so at-bats. He’s doing his thing. So, you know, good for Hunter.”

Ezequiel Tovar hit his 23rd home run of the season and Brendan Rodgers added a run-scoring double for the Rockies, who snapped a six-game losing streak to the Cubs. With the loss, Chicago fell six games behind the Mets for the third NL wild card.

Michael Busch had three hits for the Cubs, including a three-run home run off Victor Vodnik (4-3) in the top of the eighth that pulled Chicago into a 5-5 tie. Isaac Paredes also had three hits.

Ryan McMahon singled off reliever Drew Smyly (3-7) to start the bottom of the eighth. Rodgers walked and Michael Toglia singled to load the bases. Nate Pearson relieved Smyly before Goodman connected for his second career multihomer game and first career slam.

“There was some frustration after that (top of the eighth) inning because they put some good swings on pitches and we ended up giving up the lead,” Goodman said. “But everybody rallied together. We had a great offensive night, not just from me. We had a lot of big hits from some of the other guys right there in order for me to hit the grand slam. It was just a great night overall.”

Austin Gomber, reinstated from a three-day stay on the paternity list after he and his wife Rachel welcomed the arrival of their third child, went six innings and allowed two runs on nine hits.

The Cubs got to Gomber for two first inning runs on Cody Bellinger’s one-out single that scored Ian Happ and Dansby Swanson.

But the Rockies came back to take the lead with a three-run second inning off Chicago starter Javier Assad that featured Rodgers’ RBI double and Goodman’s two-run drive that soared 430 feet into the left-field bleachers. Colorado added a run in the fourth on Goodman’s RBI single.

Tovar homered in the bottom of the seventh to put Colorado up 5-2.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Rockies: OF Kris Bryant’s recovery from a back strain has slowed to the point his return this season is unlikely, manager Bud Black said. Bryant was placed on the 10-day injured list Aug. 12 after a recurrence of back problems. He had two earlier stints on the injured list this season because of a low back strain and a left rib contusion. “He’s not real close” to returning, Black said. “It’s increasingly possible Kris’ season will be over.” Bryant has missed 104 of the Rockies’ 148 games this season due to injuries.

UP NEXT

Chicago RHP Jameson Taillon (10-8, 3.57 ERA) is scheduled to start Saturday night against Colorado LHP Kyle Freeland (5-7, 4.97 ERA).
