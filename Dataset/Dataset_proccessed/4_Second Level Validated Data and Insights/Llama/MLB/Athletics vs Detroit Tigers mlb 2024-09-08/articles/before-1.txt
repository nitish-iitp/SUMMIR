Detroit Tigers vs Oakland Athletics Prediction 

Detroit was able to pick up the win in game two of this series on Saturday, but they need to string together a bunch of wins to get back into the Wild Card discussion. The Tigers are 37-37 on the road, while the Athletics are 36-38 at home. Oakland does play their best baseball at home and they have played well over the last two months, but I love the Tigers bullpen and think that will be the difference here. Take the Tigers to get another win.
