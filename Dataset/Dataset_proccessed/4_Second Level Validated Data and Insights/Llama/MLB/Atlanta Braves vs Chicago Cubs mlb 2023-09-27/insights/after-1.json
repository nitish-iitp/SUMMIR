        "Seiya Suzuki lost track of a fly ball in the lights above Truist Park, allowing two runs to score and flipping the Cubs' one-run lead into a one-run deficit.",
        "The Cubs blew a six-run lead, wasting a start from their best pitcher and dragging to the finish line with a depleted bullpen."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "The Cubs couldn't have scripted the start of this closing stretch much better, getting the bounces that made it look like this might be a blowout game to ride Justin Steele and rest their bullpen."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Cubs manager David Ross said, 'We're not going to highlight one mistake. There are other areas. We could have scored more runs. We had guys at third with less than two outs. We could have made some pitches earlier in the game. But we didn’t. We got to pick our heads up.'",
        "Seiya Suzuki, through an interpreter, acknowledged the stadium lights were a factor but said he did not want to use that as an excuse."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "This was the Cubs' 148th season of National League baseball.",
        "The team has been operating with a sense of urgency for months.",
        "The Cubs have to hang onto a wild card for this season to truly be considered a success."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Seiya Suzuki’s mistake brought about flashbacks to Ron Santo’s ‘Oh no!’ exclamation to Brant Brown’s drop on Sept. 23, 1998, which led to an 8-7 walk-off loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium."
