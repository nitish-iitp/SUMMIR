        "Bowden Francis had a chance to throw a no-hitter but lost it in the ninth inning again, this time to Francisco Lindor's home run.",

    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Francis had the chance to become only the second Toronto Blue Jays pitcher to throw a no-hitter, but twice, in an eerily similar fashion, Francis' chances to write his name in the history books were thwarted by a leadoff home run."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Despite losing the no-hitter, Francis was a good sport and received a standing ovation after eight fantastic one-run innings with a strikeout, a walk and two hit batters.",
        "The Blue Jays' manager John Schneider said, 'I don't like to mess with a chance at history' so like last time, Francis had the ball until he gave up a hit."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Francis is ending the season on a historic run and positioning himself as a piece of the 2025 rotation.",
        "The two near-no-nos are more evidence in the growing case file that Francis is a legitimate big-league starter, despite a slow start to his season that saw him bumped from the Opening Day rotation after two starts and later briefly sent down to the minors."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Francis has gone 4-1 with a 1.26 ERA over his last six starts, and his 0.40 WHIP is the lowest mark over a six-start span in MLB history.",
        "Francis has won honours such as MLB Player of the Week and Player of the Month."
