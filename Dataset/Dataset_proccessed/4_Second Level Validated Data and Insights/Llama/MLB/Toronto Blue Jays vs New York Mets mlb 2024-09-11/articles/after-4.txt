Blue Jays’ Bowden Francis loses no-no again in ninth, but continues growth as starter

TORONTO — For the second time in four starts, Bowden Francis had the chance to become only the second Toronto Blue Jays pitcher to throw a no-hitter. But twice, in an eerily similar fashion, Francis’ chances to write his name in the history books were thwarted by a leadoff home run.

On Aug. 24, Francis fell three outs short of a no-hitter against the Los Angeles Angels after Taylor Ward homered to begin the ninth inning. Most pitchers never get that close to a no-no once, let alone twice, let alone twice in a month.

Yet on Wednesday against the New York Mets, Francis had a rare chance at a do-over.

Despite feeling fatigued and pitching without overpowering stuff, the 28-year-old right-hander was no-hitting the Mets through eight innings. A big difference between this outing and his one against the Angels, however, was strikeouts. Francis had a career-high 12 strikeouts against the Halos, but against the Mets, his average velocity was down about two miles per hour and he had struck out only one batter while throwing 108 pitches.

Still, Blue Jays manager John Schneider said, “I don’t like to mess with a chance at history” so like last time, Francis had the ball until he gave up a hit.

With the Blue Jays leading 1-0, Francis had to retire the top of the Mets order in the ninth if he wanted to complete the no-no on his second attempt.

Against Mets leadoff hitter Francisco Lindor, Francis got ahead 0-2. Francis said he planned to continue to attack with fastballs, but a third-pitch 92-mph fastball caught too much of the middle of the plate. Off the bat, Francis thought it might have been a pop-up, but the ball carried over the right-field wall for a game-tying solo home run, eliciting groans from the 29,399 Blue Jays fans in the stands.

When he saw the ball go over the wall, Francis thought to himself: “Again,” he said, with a chuckle.

“With that many pitches, I just felt like I had to empty the tank with heaters and let them put the ball in play like I was doing all day. It wasn’t one of those days where I felt like I was going to get a bunch of swing-and-miss, so I felt like I needed to attack the zone,” Francis said.

After Lindor tied the game, the Mets blew it wide open, adding five more runs off the Blue Jays bullpen in the ninth to win 6-2.

But post-game, the Blue Jays’ focus was on another outstanding performance from Francis, who is ending the season on a historic run and positioning himself as a piece of the 2025 rotation.

“I don’t know how many other guys lose a no-hitter in the ninth on a homer twice in one season, but he was outstanding,” said Schneider.

Lindor’s home run ensured Dave Stieb remains the only Blue Jays pitcher to throw a no-hitter, though Francis does join Stieb as the only other pitcher in franchise history to have multiple no-hit bids spoiled in the ninth.

Despite surely feeling disappointed, Francis was a good sport when Schneider went out to retrieve the ball from him. The starter smirked at his manager and said, “We did it again,” then walked off to a standing ovation after eight fantastic one-run innings with a strikeout, a walk and two hit batters.

“It’s pretty special and I always try to cherish that and never take it for granted,” Francis said of the crowd’s reaction.

Meanwhile, over in the visitors’ dugout, Mets starter Sean Manaea tipped his cap to Francis. “That was a crazy performance. I’ve got to give respect where respect is due,” the Mets left-hander said.

The two near-no-nos are more evidence in the growing case file that Francis is a legitimate big-league starter, despite a slow start to his season that saw him bumped from the Opening Day rotation after two starts and later briefly sent down to the minors.

Since Francis returned to the rotation on Aug. 7, he’s turned his season around and been one of the best starters in baseball. With tweaks to his pitch mix, including utilizing an improved splitter, Francis has gone 4-1 with a 1.26 ERA over his last six starts. His 0.40 WHIP is the lowest mark over a six-start span in MLB history and during this current run, Francis has won honours such as MLB Player of the Week and Player of the Month.

More importantly, however, he’s shown over an increasingly growing sample size that he can be a reliable big-league starter for the Blue Jays this year and beyond.

“(It’s) huge for him, and been really big for us,” the Blue Jays manager said. “You think back to the beginning of the year, and we’re talking about an opener and yanking him early, and what he’s done has been so rewarding for a lot of people — him most importantly. But I think at this point, you look and you say, OK, this is a guy who gets it, and this is a guy that is reliable. This is a guy that is continuing to evolve and continuing to want to get better. And that’s just everything you could ask for in a starting pitcher.”

Francis is quiet and meditative about his growth as a pitcher, often talking about learning more from hard times than successes. As such, Schneider said he believes the right-hander is uniquely equipped to process the emotions of losing out on a no-hitter twice in a month.

“He’s mature, he’s really, really wise beyond his years and I think he does a really good job of looking at the big picture of things,” Schneider said. “I think he will take a lot of positives out of this. And he’ll probably laugh a little bit at the fact that he’s lost two in the ninth inning on home runs. But I just can’t speak enough to how he’s evolved and how much he’s taken from this opportunity. It’s just been so cool to watch.”

Asked about what he’s learned after losing two no-hit bids in the ninth, Francis mused about potentially altering the way he approached the final three outs, should he have a third crack at the feat.

“I’ve gotten beat twice with fastball, so I feel like maybe from here on out, when I get this deep I got to, kind of, empty the tank on some of the off-speed stuff, or really mix it up,” Francis said. “But it’s something I don’t want to just like change just because it’s the ninth inning. I got to stick with my plan, but it’s also I got to learn that, I don’t know, I can’t keep getting beat right there in that situation, but it’s part of it.”

And for Francis, the two near-misses, along with his other starts, have all been a part of his experience of learning to be a big-league starter. It’s a job he always believed he could do, but now he is convincing everyone else.

“I can start in the big leagues,” he said. “I feel like I’ve always believed that, though I feel like a lot of people kind of lost hope early on in this year. I didn’t, but that’s how things go. Everyone says, ‘What have you done for me lately?’ … I feel like anyone can have two bad starts. I just feel like I’m getting my shot now and I’m trying to make the most of it.”
