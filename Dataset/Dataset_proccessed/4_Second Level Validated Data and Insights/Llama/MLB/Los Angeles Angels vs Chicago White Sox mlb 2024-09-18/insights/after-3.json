    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Interim manager Grady Sizemore said, 'We had some opportunities, just didn't capitalize. I think a couple mistakes, too, that could have gone a different way and helped us out.'",
        "Andrew Vaughn said, 'That was a tough game out there. Back and forth in extras. We'd score, they'd score. We just didn't put them away right there.'",
        "Sizemore said, 'We get the same question every day. We’re focused on just one series at a time, one game at a time. Everything else is irrelevant right now. We're just trying to get better and win games.'"

        "The White Sox must win at least seven of their final nine games to avoid tying the modern Major League record of 120 losses in a season set by the 1962 New York Mets."
