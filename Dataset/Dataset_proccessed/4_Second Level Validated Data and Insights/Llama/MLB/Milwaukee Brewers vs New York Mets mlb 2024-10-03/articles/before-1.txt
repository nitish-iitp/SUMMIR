New York Mets vs Milwaukee Brewers Prediction 

Both of these teams have won one game in this series and they will look to advance to the next round with a win here. Milwaukee should have plenty of momentum in this game after their comeback on Wednesday night, but the Mets have also hit the ball very well over the last four days. Both of these pitchers have been pretty good recently, but I give the advantage to Quintana, who has been fantastic in his last six starts. Take the Mets here.
