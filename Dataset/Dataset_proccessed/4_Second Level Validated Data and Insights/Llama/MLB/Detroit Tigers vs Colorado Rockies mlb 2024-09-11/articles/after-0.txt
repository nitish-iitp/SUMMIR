DETROIT -- The Detroit Tigers won their fourth game in a row on Wednesday night, but they didn’t gain any ground in their chase for the final American League wild-card spot.

After the Tigers (75-71) beat the Colorado Rockies, the Minnesota Twins (78-68) held on to be the Los Angeles Angels; the Boston Red Sox (74-72) rallied to beat the Baltimore Orioles; and the Seattle Mariners (74-72) notched a late-night win over the San Diego Padres.
