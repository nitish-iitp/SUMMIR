Jared Jones labors as rookie season inches to a close; Reds, Elly De La Cruz top Pirates

CINCINNATI — For as swimmingly as Jared Jones’ rookie season started, it’s been the inverse from Independence Day onward.

The right-hander missed nearly two months due to a Grade 2 right lat strain suffered on July 3 and hasn’t been as dominant since. On Saturday afternoon at Great American Ball Park, Jones yielded six earned runs across five innings, as the Pirates fell to the Reds 7-1 to drop the series with Sunday’s finale awaiting.

"Terrible,” Jones said of his performance. “Everything was terrible today.”

Including Saturday’s start, Jones’ ERA in the second half has ballooned to 6.15, and his seasonlong figure has climbed north of 4.00 for the first time since April 11. Manager Derek Shelton said the quality of Jones’ offerings remains solid but not at all times.

"Early in the year, he was really consistent with all of his weapons, and I think what we've seen is a little bit of inconsistency,” Shelton said. “Some of that is [his] first major league season and we're in September.

“Some of that is he came off an injury and maybe trying to do a little too much at times.”

The 23-year-old appeared to be in store for a strong start when he struck out two of the first three hitters he faced. But the third inning was the first of a couple of troubling ones for Jones, who struggled to record the final out of each frame.

Tyler Stephenson drove home the game’s first run by singling on a slider and scored when Ty France turned on a hanging curveball for a two-run shot. Jones encountered further difficulties in the fourth inning via the long ball.

Again with two outs, Jones hung a breaking ball and felt the consequences. Elly De La Cruz got a slider that caught too much of the plate and yanked it down the right-field line for a no-doubt, three-run homer that traveled an estimated 423 feet, per Statcast.

"He threw the slider to Elly that didn't slide,” Shelton said. “Just a lack of execution, lack of solid execution in some crucial moments."

Jones responded from the two forgettable frames with a 1-2-3 fifth that was briefly interrupted by a mound visit. Both assistant athletic trainer Tony Leo and Shelton attended to Jones after his fifth and final strikeout of the afternoon because he threw a slower-than-usual fastball to France. Jones explained what the reasoning was behind the suddenly diminished velocity.

"I didn't think we had enough time to shake to a new pitch,” Jones said, “so I panicked and lobbed the baseball in there."

Jones added he was “fine” and didn’t have any injuries to report. The Pirates wanted to make sure Jones was alright on a sweltering Cincinnati September day with temperatures in the high 80s.

“Long inning, hot day. The first fastball he threw, didn't really like the [velocity],” Shelton said. “The execution of the slider was still good, so I just went out to check on him. But he was fine."

Though Jones’ afternoon didn’t go as he or the Pirates intended, the right-hander at the very least set a new career high for innings in a professional season. Including his trio of rehab starts for Triple-A Indianapolis, Jones has thrown a combined 128⅓ innings this year, which is two more than all of the 2023 campaign.

"Very important,” Shelton said of that benchmark. “I think in terms of what we've talked about with all of our pitchers, just making sure that we continue to try to finish strong."

There’s a caveat with that development, though, in that Jones hasn’t looked nearly as sharp in the second half of the season as before the All-Star break. With only seven games remaining in the Pirates’ campaign, there’s room for Jones to make one more start.

It remains to be seen how the Pirates will handle one of their most prized hurlers, who would surely benefit from going into the offseason with some more recent success to build upon.

On the mound

David Bednar responded from a challenging last outing against the Cardinals in which he gave up three runs (two earned) across ⅓ of an inning. The former Pirates closer tossed a scoreless seventh inning, though he did issue a two-out walk.

Left-hander Ryan Borucki, whose season has been derailed due to injury, also blanked the Reds in the eighth. Such couldn’t be said for fellow southpaw Jalen Beeks, though, as he gave up the Reds’ seventh and final run in the sixth.

At the plate

Less than 24 hours removed from struggling mightily against Reds starter Nick Martinez, who tied a career high with nine strikeouts, the Pirates again labored at the plate.

Cincinnati right-hander Rhett Lowder had his way across five scoreless innings, only running into trouble in the fifth when the Pirates loaded the bases. That threat proved fruitless when Bryan De La Cruz flew out to right field to strand a trio.

The Pirates squandered their other run-scoring opportunities and only avoided a shutout thanks to Billy Cook’s solo home run — the second of his MLB career — in the top of the ninth.

"I think we just need to swing at better pitches,” Shelton said. “It looked like we chased out of the zone in those situations. A couple times, maybe it was a pitch that was strike to ball that ended up out of the zone.

“In those situations, we've got to make him come on the plate."

They said it

“If there was any thought there was any injury,” Shelton said of Jones, “we would have made sure we got him out of there."
