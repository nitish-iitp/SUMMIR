Kansas City Royals vs Houston Astros Prediction

I’m leaning toward Houston. At least some of that is due to Lugo’s spotty numbers recently. He did well against the Angels on August 19 with 7.0 innings, two earned, four hits and three walks in a victory. In the other two of his last three starts however, Lugo is 0-2 with 9.1 innings and 12 earned runs.

On Thursday Houston came back from a 3-2 deficit in the eighth and kept KC off the board outside of the three-run seventh. The Astros’ hitting was a little sporadic, but the pitching staff made up for it. I like Houston to keep it up Friday.
