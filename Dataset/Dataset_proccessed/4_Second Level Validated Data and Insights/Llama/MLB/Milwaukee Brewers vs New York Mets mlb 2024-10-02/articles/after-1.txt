MILWAUKEE — The Mets could smell the champagne, they were so close.

Six outs away from punching their ticket to the NL Division Series, Brewers rookie Jackson Chourio struck, blasting a game-tying 398-foot home run off Mets reliever Phil Maton into the right field seats. The score was 3-3, and it only got worse from there.

Four batters later in the eighth inning, Brewers designated hitter Garrett Mitchell, who was pinch-hitting, smacked another home run off Maton. This one was a two-run shot, giving Milwaukee its first lead in its eventual 5-3 win in Game 2 of the NL Wild Card Series on Wednesday.

Before the Brewers took the lead at American Family Field, the Mets had been getting by with guile, scrapping together singles, drawing walks, and being aggressive on the basepaths. It allowed them to stay ahead of Milwaukee through seven innings while scoring just three runs, on eight singles.

In their two Wild Card games against Milwaukee, the Mets have 15 hits, only two for extra bases, and nine walks. They’ve even stolen more bases than the Brewers; Starling Marte’s in the fourth is the only one for either team all series.

The Mets jumped on Brewers starter — and Yankees bust — Frankie Montas in the top of the first inning. Brandon Nimmo singled home the run, giving the Mets baserunners on first and third. But Milwaukee caught a break when Pete Alonso tripped over his bat after grounding to shortstop. Instead of J.D. Martinez at bat with Alonso at first, Alonso grounded into an inning-ending double play.

After Chourio tied the game with a lead-off home run, the Mets threatened to break the game wide open in the second inning.

It started when Marte reached on an error. Similar to Brewers reliever Joel Payamps, who missed first base on Jose Iglesias’s game-changing infield single in the fifth inning in Game 1, Montas dropped a throw by the first baseman, allowing Marte to get on.

Two singles — one an RBI from Francisco Alvarez — and a Francisco Lindor sacrifice fly later, the Mets retook the lead 3-1.

They continued to threaten with Iglesias singling to right field and then advancing to second on a throw to third base, putting two runners in scoring position. But Mark Vientos flied out to right field.

The Mets didn’t score the rest of the way, though they had their opportunities. They stranded Marte and Nimmo on second base in the fourth and fifth innings, respectively, and left the bases loaded in the sixth. Altogether, they left nine runners on base and went 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position.

Mets starter Sean Manaea was able to contain the Brewers after allowing six earned runs in 3 2/3 innings against the Brewers last Friday. On Wednesday, Manaea held Milwaukee to just two earned runs in five innings. He struck out four and allowed six hits.

The first came off Chourio, who smacked Manaea’s third pitch of the game 376 feet into the right field seats. Manaea settled in after that, not allowing a run over the next three innings. In the fifth, he gave up a lead-off single to Brice Turang and the Brewers second baseman scored on a one-out sacrifice fly, bringing the game to 3-2.

Mets relievers took over the rest of the way, throwing two scoreless before Maton took the ball in the eighth inning.

New York now faces a winner-take-all Game 3 in Milwaukee on Thursday at 7:08 p.m. ET.
