        "The Mets went 75-87 in 2023 and were 22-33 near the end of May, but they came on strong the rest of the way under new manager Carlos Mendoza to earn the NL's final wild-card spot.",

        "Peralta (11-9, 3.68 ERA) will start Game 1, but Murphy isn't saying how the Brewers will set up their pitching beyond that."
