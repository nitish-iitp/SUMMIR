        "The Royals stressed focus on'small details' as their offensive funk continues.",
        "Second baseman Michael Massey said, “We’re just not swinging it well. We’ve done this before and come out of it. It’s obviously not the time we want to do it, but we’ve got plenty of time to get it right.”",
        "General manager J.J. Picollo said, “With Michael, we just need him to take competitive at-bats like he’s done all year. He doesn’t need to do anything different. And that goes for everybody in the lineup.”"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Massey said, “There are certain times of the year when, for whatever reason, things just don’t go your way. And you got to find a way in those stretches, when you’re not getting the big three-run homer, when you’re not getting the big hit with runners in scoring position, to get guys on base.”",
        "Massey said, “When you’re struggling as a hitter, get on time for the heater. Once you get on time for the heater, you hit a line drive in the gap, you start feeling it again. Now you can go back to all the other stuff. But you have to go back to the basics to get it right.”",
        "Wacha said, “We could maybe pay attention a little bit more to the small details. Just continue to compete the way we know how, keep continuing to prepare the way we know how. We know we’ve got the guys in this clubhouse to get the job done.”"
