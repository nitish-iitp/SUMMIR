        "Cody Bellinger blasted the first pitch he saw from Walker Buehler in the first inning, driving it 430 feet out to right field for a two-run homer that set the tone in a 10-4 victory."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "The Cubs have scored zero runs in 15 games so far this year, which almost doubles the number of times they were shut out last season (8), and nearly matches the historically bad 2024 Chicago White Sox in that category (16 shutouts)."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Bellinger hasn't performed at an MVP level or carried the team the way he did last season. He remains an above-average left-handed hitter with 16 homers, 63 RBIs and a.754 OPS at a time when offense across the game is down."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Wrigley Field sells itself. Win or lose, the Cubs have a highly successful and durable business model that consistently draws around 3 million fans per season."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Bellinger could return to the Cubs on a $30 million salary next year, will wait until the offseason before reconsidering his future and making the opt-in or opt-out decision."
