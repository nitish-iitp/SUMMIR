New York Mets Betting Preview

The Mets were able to eke into the playoffs with a Wild Card bid this year, posting an 89-73 overall record. New York moved on with victories 8-4 Tuesday and 4-2 Thursday over the Milwaukee Brewers in that Wild Card set. In Saturday’s Division Round opener versus Philly, the Mets posted five runs in the eighth inning on the way to a 6-2 victory. David Peterson did most of the pitching with 3.0 clean frames, one hit and three walks.

In the starter slot for Sunday will be New York’s Luis Severino. This year Severino went 11-7 with a 3.91 ERA in 31 starts. In his postseason career Severino is 2-4 with a 5.07 ERA in 12 games (11 starts).

Over on the Philadelphia side, they won the National League East this year with a 95-67 overall record, earning a bye into the Division Series. On Saturday Philly could only muster five team hits, two of which came from Kyle Schwarber (solo homer). Starter Zack Wheeler finished with 7.0 innings, one hit, four walks and nine Ks in a great outing.

As starting pitcher for game two the Phillies will go with Christopher Sanchez. This season Sanchez logged a 3.32 ERA with an 11-9 record in 31 starts. Sanchez has just one postseason start to his credit, posting 2.1 innings and one K.

New York Mets vs Philadelphia Phillies Prediction

I’m going to stick with the Mets. Severino had a decent start in his first postseason appearance this year, notching 6.0 innings with three earned on eight hits and two walks. New York would go on to win that game, 8-4 over the Brewers on October 1. Prior to that however, Severino was just okay with 10 earned over a span of 16.0 innings heading into the playoffs. He’ll need a quality outing here to get New York started on the right foot.

In Saturday’s opener, the Mets were relatively quiet aside from one huge inning and it did the job. Brandon Nimmo had two of the team’s six RBI, and the pitching staff did the rest. Five different pitchers got work in Game 1, so it’d be nice to see Severino get a lengthy outing Sunday.
