        "Guardians' persistence in the fourth inning hinted at what was to come.",
        "Cole loaded the bases again in the fifth after giving up singles to Steven Kwan and Rocchio, who, with a single in the third inning, extended his hitting streak to seven games for the longest streak by a Cleveland player to start a postseason career.",
        "Cole finished after 4 1/3 innings pitched, allowing two earned runs on six hits and an uncharacteristic four walks while fanning four batters.",

        "The Guardians fell 6-3 on Tuesday in Game 2 as the Yankees took a 2-0 lead in the American League Championship Series.",
        "If the Guardians want to claw their way back from a 2-0 hole, they’ll need to play smart, aggressive baseball — specifically, by exposing any cracks in the Yankees’ bullpen and improving their situational hitting with runners in scoring position. Cleveland will need to play to its strengths by taking advantage of the Yankees’ bullpen and improving with runners in scoring position.",
        "The three biggest hitters for the Yankees have homered in the first two games. Aaron Judge hit his first homer of the postseason in Game 2, joining Giancarlo Stanton and Soto.",
        "Game 3 is set for Thursday at Progressive Field with the Guardians two games away from elimination and the Yankees two games away from the World Series."

        "When these three hitters for the Yankees get going, it can be difficult to slow them down.",
        "Ramírez is beginning to find his rhythm for the Guardians, belting a homer in the final frame before the series shifts back to Cleveland.",
        "The Guardians can’t afford to rely solely on Ramírez."
