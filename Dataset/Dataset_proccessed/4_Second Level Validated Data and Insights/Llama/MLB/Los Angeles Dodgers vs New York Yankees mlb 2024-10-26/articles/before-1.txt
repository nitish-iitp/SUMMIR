Postgame

Game 1 is a classic, a walk off repeat of the 1988 World Series Game 1, albeit with a grand slam twist, and a repeat of Jeffrey Maier fan interference call that we saw in the 1996 ALCS – and this time it was reversed. In between, great pitching performances from Cole and Flaherty, another key home run from Stanton, great defense and base running from Jazz Chisholm, a dramatic choice of Nestor Cortes to enter into the game in a huge spot and so ,uch more. The Yankees did almost everything to win this game, and then lost in absolutely bone crushing fashion. And tomorrow they face Yamamoto needing to win and avoid heading to the Bronx in a 2-0 hole.

It left me breathless, that’s what drama filled, high stakes sports can do. Thank you Game 1!

And that’s it from us! Wherever you are, thanks for following along! Good morning, good afternoon and goodnight!

Hearing a hero

“That’s the stuff when your five years old in the back yard, that’s a dream come true.” – Freddie Freeman talking to FOX television in the US after hitting a walk off grand slam to win Game 1 of the World Series! And we didn’t even know if he could play tonight!

GRAND SLAM HOME RUN! Yankees 3-6 Dodgers, FINAL

Freeman takes the first pitch and sends it into the right field stands! He knew it right away, lifting his bat in celebration! It’s a game-winning 10th inning home run for Freeman, doing his best Kirk Gibson impression, winning a World Series game on one foot!

Wow!

Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, bottom 10th

Ohtani fouls it off to the left side, Verdugo is running hard towards the wall. Does he have room? Yes! He makes the catch and falls into the stands, Jeter style, sort of.

The runners move up because Verdugo fell into the stands but what a catch! Amazing!

So now Betts is intentionally walked, that loads the bases. Freddie Freeman will be tasked with getting a single that can score two Dodgers and win this game for LA!

Cortes v Ohtani, with the tying run at second base and the winning run at first. One out. Here we go!

Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, bottom 10th

Cousins is ahead 0-1 after an atrocious call by the home plate umpire on a ball clearly outside. Then a pitch in the inside of the plate is ruled a strike. That was borderline, but probably correct. Now Edman slaps a ball to the right side that Cabreara, who leans over to try and make the stab, but he can’t handle it! Everyone is safe, two one and one out for Shohei Ohtani!

This game keeps giving!

And how about this: Yankees starter, now reliever, Nestor Cortes, who was deemed out for the season, probably, and hasn’t pitched in a month, is coming in to face the baseball god from Oshu with it all on the line! Wow, this is good!

Chris Taylor is in to pinch run for Lux who is at second base.

Cousins walks Lux. Walks are never, ever good. They don’t usually end well. How about now?

Edman is heading to the plate to try and move Lux around.

Wells, an automatic out, is automatically out on a strikeout. Inning over, but the Yankees take the lead after Chisholm steals two bases in an electric Yankees 10th!

Can the Dodgers answer?

RUN! Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, top 10th

With the infield in, a sharp hit grounder to short – Edman, who is playing in, making the play that much tougher, rushes because he wants to end the inning with a double play, but he bobbles it! Chisholm comes home to score, Rizzo is out at second base! Volpe is on at first! And then he steals second base!

So action everywhere and a Yankees lead!

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 10th

Volpe v Treinen. It’s 0-1 and Treinen has a look at Chisholm at second.

Next pitch, Chisholm takes off for third – no throw!

So the go ahead run is at third, a sac fly away!

26 Oct 2024
23.19 EDT

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 10th

Chisholm steals second, so now he’s in scoring position for Rizzo with one out! And Rizzo is ahead in the count, 3-0. Now they’ll walk him to set up an inning ending double play and multiple force plays

LA pitching coach Mark Prior is out for a chat with Treinen.

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 10th

Stanton hit his 17th career postseason homer earlier this game. Now he faces Treinen to start the inning, and waves at a breaking pitch away! Strike three!

Now Chisholm steps to the plate and promptly slaps a single to right field! Betts makes a great run to keep the ball from going to the wall, hoding Jazz to a single.

Rizzo is next.

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, bottom 9th

Hernandez hits a ball to shallow left! Verdug runs in, slides and makes a fantastic catch! That ends the inning with a defensive exclamation point for the Yankees!

We have extra innings in Game 1 of the World Series! And there’s no ghost runners in the post-season.

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, bottom 9th

Well, if you were looking for crisp, tight, well played baseball, with some late, wild antics, you’ve found it!

Muncy is ahead 3-1 on Weaver, but then he skies a change up to second base for the second out.

So it’s up to Hernandez, who does have a flair for the dramatic.

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, bottom 9th

So here’s Teoscar Hernandez to face Weaver. Oswaldo Hernandez is in to play second base for New York after Jasson Dominguez pinch ran for Torres last inning.

Hernandez pokes a ball to right fielder for the out. Here’s Max Muncy, and he’s had three home runs off Weaver. Gulp!

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 9th

Judge swipes at a high fastball and pops it up to short! Easy for Edman, inning over! and what an inning it was!

Hernandez, Muncy and Hernandez due up for LA’s bottom of the ninth as they try to escape Game 1 with a victory!

23.02 EDT

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 9th

They walk Soto to face Judge, righty on righty. It seems crazy and also makes perfect sense.

First and second, two outs, tie game, 1-2 to Judge. How will it end?

Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 9th

With Soto on deck and Judge in the hole, Torres gets ahead in the count 2-1.

Then he hits a deep drive and that’s a home run!!! But wait! A fan has reached over and caught the ball!

That’s fan interference! Except unlike the 1996 ALCS, when Jeffrey Maier slapped a Derek Jeter fly ball into the stands at Yankee Stadium for a home run against the Baltimore Orioles, we have instant replay to fix this nonsense. So that means Torres is placed at second base, and Soto comes to the plate.

Roberts is coming to get Kopech, Blake Treinen is coming in to try and keep this game tied!

Wild!

OK, Ohtani is on third, and the Yankees infield is in. Weaver faces Betts who is behind in the count 1-2 in the biggest of spots here.

Ohtani nearly had his first World Series home run, but he’s still on third base.

Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom eighth

Ohtani hits a line drive that just falls short of a game tying homer! He’s into second base. But Volpe can’t handle a bounced throw from the right fielder, Soto, so Ohtani heads over to third base!

So now Ohtani is 90 feet away from tying this game, and Boone is out to get Khanle! The Yankees closer, Luke Weaver is heading in to face Mookie Betts with one out!

26 Oct 2024
22.42 EDT

Edman is behind 0-2 to Kahnle, who remains in the game, for now. He gets Edman to bounce out to short. One down, here’s Ohtani looking to tie this game with a single swing!

Chisholm is blown away for the first out. Here’s Rizzo.

22.31 EDT

The line on Cole

What can you say, the man delivered tonight.

6IP 6H 1R 1ER 0BB 4K 0HR

No free passes, that’s the key. You can’t give a lineup like this anything for free, and he didn’t.

Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh

Lux grounds to second base, Torres shifts to his right, has the ball, throws it to first and the inning is over! The Yankees survive two on and nobody out to hold onto a one-run lead!

22.26 EDT

Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh

Hernandez bunts! And successfully! the runners advance as Wells pops out to make the play and get Hernandez at first.

But now Smith pops a sinker to shortstop for an easy second out! Can the Yankees escape this threat?

Boone is coming out to get Holmes! A new pitcher is coming in to face Gavin Lux, who will try to save this inning! that’s Tommy Kahnle.

Share
26 Oct 2024
22.23 EDT

Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh

One on and nobody out for Muncy. Holmes nearly hits Muncy as the ball goes to the backstop. Hernandez advances, and now they say Muncy was hit!

That means two on and no outs – the Dodgers are threatening, and Hernandez, Mr Dodgers clutch, steps into the batters box to face Holmes!

Share
26 Oct 2024
22.21 EDT

Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh

Holmes, the one-time closer before being demoted in favor of new closer Luke Weaver has been a bit better in this role of middle man. Now he faces Smith is a big spot against max Muncy.

Share
26 Oct 2024
22.20 EDT

Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh

That’s it for Cole! Wow! I thought he was good enough to try one more batter, but Boone thought otherwise. So the Yankees ace is done, and their bullpen will take over.

Clay Holmes enters for the Yankees.

22.18 EDT

Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh

Cole has thrown just 82 pitches and is back out to pitch the seventh inning for New York. His first assignment is the dangerous Hernandez, and the count is even at 2-2.

Cole has been in big spots before with the Yankees and hasn’t always been at his best, but that’s not the case so far tonight. He’s been absolutely fantastic.

Now the count is full: here’s the payoff pitch and it’s lined to center for a lead off base hit for LA! Muncy is next and Boone is out to talk to Cole. is that it for the Yankees ace?
