 Dodgers 6, Yankees 3

The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees, 6–3, taking Game One in the World Series Friday night at Dodger Stadium. The boys in blue got the job done at home, and look to bounce to take a 2–0 series lead on Saturday. The Yankees, with Gerrit Cole on the mound, pitched their way into brilliance, but two sacrifice flies led the game to extras. After a tenth-inning strike, it all came down to one swing.

The Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman became the MVP with one swing, sending the fans into a frenzy, and the Dodgers to a 1–0 series lead.

Dodgers – Yankees Game Summary

Game One started out with Gerrit Cole and Jack Flaherty dealing on the bump. Cole got into some trouble after Freddie Freeman tripled, but he escaped the jam with a line out to Jazz Chisholm Jr. The first run came from Will Smith, who hit a sacrifice fly to Juan Soto which scored Enrique Hernandez. In the sixth, however, Giancarlo Stanton showed he is postseason ready. A low slider inside he mashed, a moonshot to left field which scored Soto and gave the Yankees a 2–1 lead. In the eighth, after a Ohtani double and throwing error, Mookie Betts hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game.

In the tenth, Chisholm stole second and third base, which set up a Anthony Volpe fielder’s choice to score Chisholm. The bottom of the frame, after Gavin Lux walked, Tommy Edman hit an infield single to set up Ohtani. Nestor Cortes came in to pitch for the lefty matchup. On the first pitch, Ohtani flew out to Alex Verdugo. The runners moved up to second and third after Verdugo caught the ball and crashed into foul territory. The Yankees intentionally walked Betts. Freeman came up, and smashed a first pitch fastball to the stands.

What Went Right for the Yankees
Gerrit Cole

The Game One starter saw it through, picking it up to where he wants his stuff to be. He pitched six innings, four hits and one earned run. A great day for the ace but he wish he saw the team win after his performance.

Giancarlo Stanton

The impressive play from the home run machine continues. His sixth inning home run changed the game upside down, and gave the Yankees what they needed.

What Went Wrong for the Yankees
Nestor Cortes/Aaron Boone

Aaron Boone’s performance in the ALCS with his matchups gave the Yankees a great advantage. Cortes did great against Ohtani, but Mookie Betts is 0-for-5 in his career against Cortes. Boone declined the lefty on lefty matchup, and Freeman got what he wanted.

Aaron Judge

Aaron Judge’s postseason struggles continue, with a 1-for-5 day, but three strikeouts and missing big opportunities for the Yankees could be a big highlight to their loss.

What Went Right for the Dodgers
Freddie Freeman

The sprained ankle seemed to be no problem for the veteran first baseman. A triple in the first inning and a grand slam walk-off for the first time in World Series history. Not a bad way to kick off your second World Series.

Jack Flaherty

It was one mistake from Flaherty on the inside slider to Stanton. Other than that, a great performance for a pitcher that is having an up and down postseason.

What Went Wrong for the Dodgers
Create More Offense

Only two sacrifice flies to send the game into extra innings did enough for the Dodgers, but they look to add more offense.

Quick Hits

Freddie Freeman ended Game One with the first ever walk-off grand slam in the World Series. Overall, it was the 63rd walk-off win in World Series history and the 63rd Fall Classic game that went to extra-innings. It was the fifth time ever that the Dodgers won a World Series game in walk-off fashion, joining 2018 Game Three (Max Muncy solo homer in 18th inning); 1988 Game One (Kirk Gibson two-run homer in 9th inning); 1956 Game Six (Jackie Robinson single in 10th inning); and 1947 Game Four (Cookie Lavagetto two-run double in ninth inning).

The Dodgers (98–64) and Yankees (94–68) each held the best records in their respective leagues this season. It is the first time that the top teams in each league are facing off in the Fall Classic since the Dodgers bested the Rays in the 2020 World Series and the first time in a full season since 2013 when the Red Sox topped the Cardinals

Looking Ahead

Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Carlos Rodon will go toe-to-toe in Game Two of the World Series. A pivotal game for both teams. First pitch is scheduled for 5 pm Pacific at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.
