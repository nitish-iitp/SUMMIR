        "Shohei Ohtani became the fastest player in major league history — and sixth ever — with 40 home runs and 40 stolen bases in the same season — and he achieved the feat in the same game."

    "Key Match Events": [
        "Shohei Ohtani homered leading off the game on his second bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium shortly after the Japanese superstar and his dog, Decoy, handled ceremonial first pitch duties."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Fans, many of them Japanese, waited patiently under a hot sun in a line that stretched well away from the main gate, before it opened. The first Ohtani bobblehead giveaway in May — featuring him in his batting stance — attracted a sellout crowd of 53,527 — the largest in the majors this season and the most at Dodger Stadium since Sept. 20, 2019."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Manager Dave Roberts said he is still surprised by the mania that surrounds Ohtani. 'When you’re in it day to day, he’s a baseball player that just wants to play,' the manager said, 'but when you see him impact and move the needle like he does and has, I’ve just never seen anything like this. It is incredible.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The second Ohtani bobblehead giveaway proved just as popular as the first. Only the first 40,000 fans received the bobblehead, which depicts a smiling Ohtani holding Decoy (its Japanese name is Dekopin). Some gold versions were randomly mixed in."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Ohtani carried Decoy to the mound for ceremonial first pitch duties. He placed the ball on the rubber and took up a catching position behind home plate. After Ohtani gave a signal, the Dutch Kooikerhondje — wearing his own uniform — picked up the ball in his mouth and carried it to Ohtani."
