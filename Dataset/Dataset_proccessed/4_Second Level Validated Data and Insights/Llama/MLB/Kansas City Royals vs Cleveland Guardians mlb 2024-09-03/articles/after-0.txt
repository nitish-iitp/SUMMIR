Max Rieper has been the managing editor of Royals Review since 2014.

The Royals know they are in a funk, writes Anne Rogers.

“There are certain times of the year when, for whatever reason, things just don’t go your way,” Massey said. “And you got to find a way in those stretches, when you’re not getting the big three-run homer, when you’re not getting the big hit with runners in scoring position, to get guys on base. Grind out a walk. Even something as simple as not chasing a guy out of the zone.

“When you’re struggling as a hitter, get on time for the heater. Once you get on time for the heater, you hit a line drive in the gap, you start feeling it again. Now you can go back to all the other stuff. But you have to go back to the basics to get it right.”

Jaylon Thompson writes the Royals are not panicking.

“It’s frustrating, you know, this time of the year to go on a streak like this,” Royals second baseman Michael Massey said. “... We’ve got the guys in this clubhouse to turn around and do it. So, there is no panic.”

Vinnie Pasquantino addressed the media as he expects to have thumb surgery today.

He is yet to play a complete season with the organization and that has weighed on him.

“I don’t want to think about it too much because I want to be a guy the Royals can count on to be here and I haven’t been that,” Pasquantino said. “That’s the part that’s so upsetting to me. You know, when I close my eyes and envision what my career can look like in Kansas City, I want it to be a long one and healthy one. And, thus far, something has happened.”

Yuli Gurriel injured his hamstring in Monday’s loss.

Acting manager Paul Hoover called Gurriel’s injury a “super mild strain” and said the team wanted to be cautious at that time to get him out of the game and avoid further injury. It was unclear whether Gurriel will miss any time as he was getting treatment postgame, but it might be a day-to-day situation.

David Lesky reacts to the newest pickups, including Tommy Pham.

The metrics indicate that he was underperforming. His expected average was .277. His expected slugging percentage was .422. He hits the ball pretty hard and hits it in the air. It’s a good offensive profile, especially when you add in that his chase rate is elite. There are only two players who have even seen a minute on the Royals active roster this season to have a chase rate lower than his 19 percent. One of them is Tyler Gentry, who was sent down to make room for the Royals pickups. The other is Robbie Grossman, who was claimed along with Pham on Saturday afternoon. It’s a skillset the Royals don’t have much of. He will hold his own with righties, but hits lefties well enough to be in there most days but all games against lefties.
