Gavin Williams allowed one run in seven innings and Lane Thomas and Josh Naylor both hit two-run homers to lead the Guardians to a 4-2 win over the Royals, extending their division lead to 4.5 games over Kansas City and 3.5 over Minnesota.

Thomas and Naylor each had two hits as both have emerged from freezing cold stretches, Bo Naylor had a hit and a walk and the Guardians bullpen was good as usual, with Cade Smith allowing a double that scored. Tommy Pham tried to injure Josh Naylor and shows himself to be a jerk over and over. Steven Kwan is still lost at the plate and is the last key offensive piece who needs to fall into place for a strong run to and through the playoffs.

Finding a way to win this series would be huge in the effort to put an end to the Royals' playoff hopes, and Tanner Bibee goes tonight.

Matan K. had some great notes on how special Gimenez is as a defender:

Around MLB;

The Twins won.
