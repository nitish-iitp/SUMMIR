        "Pete Crow-Armstrong bunted with Nico Hoerner on first and probably would have beaten out a good throw. But third baseman José Tena threw wildly past first base, allowing the runner to come all the way around to score.",
        "Paredes made a diving stab on a Keibert Ruiz grounder with the bases loaded and fired from his knees to second base to begin a 5-4-3 double play.",
        "Cody Bellinger had a two-RBI hit through a drawn-in infield that second baseman Luis Garcia Jr. probably should have fielded.",
        "Paredes eventually singled him home and Chicago was ahead 7-1 in the 7th.",
        "Hoerner plated two with a hit and Miguel Amaya doubled home a pair in the 14-1 victory."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Chicago certainly did what they had to do on this nine-game road swing against bad teams, going 8-1. They are starting to at least make themselves noticeable in the playoff race even if the odds still aren’t great.",
        "It might get very interesting if they can keep this going, but the road will get a bit tougher after they play the Pirates at Wrigley with the Yankees and Dodgers looming."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Fourteen of the Cubs’ 18 hits were singles.",
        "Wicks got almost no whiffs but he was very efficient, especially in his final three innings: 5 IP, 1 R, 4 H, 0 K, and 0 BB.",
        "PCA is becoming a chaos monster on the bases and had three more hits Sunday.",
        "Hitting second seems to agree with Dansby Swanson, who had four base hits including a double."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The Cubs offense continued to put up huge numbers as the calendar turned to September, hitting double digits yet again in Washington.",
        "The sloppy Nationals defense opened the door early and Chicago kicked it down, eventually scoring 14 times to complete their second consecutive sweep and sixth win in a row.",
        "On Deck, The aforementioned series against Pittsburgh begins Labor Day evening at 6:40pm CT. Jameson Taillon takes on Jared Jones in a contest broadcast on Marquee and 670 The Score."
