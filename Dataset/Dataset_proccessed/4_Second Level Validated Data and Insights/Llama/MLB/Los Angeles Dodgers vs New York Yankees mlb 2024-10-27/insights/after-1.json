    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Rizzo was part of the 2016 champion Cubs who rebounded from down three-games-to-one in the World Series to win it all. So he knows there is a road back, saying, \"a win Monday changes the narrative.\""

    "Others": [
        "The Yankees wanted Flaherty and Tommy Edman at the trade deadline and the Dodgers acquired both — Edman’s lefty mashing continued with one of the three homers off Rodon.",
        "The ability to go homer for homer and star for star and long lineup for long lineup with the Dodgers? Not quite."
