    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Mets manager Carlos Mendoza preached trust all year, but now it’s time for urgency.",
        "The Mets knew entering the game that the Dodgers represented a nightmare matchup for Jose Quintana, but Mendoza stuck with him as the exact dynamic he feared played out in the early innings."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Pete Alonso said, “We’ve had to answer the bell all year. It’s no different now. We need to be better. We have to apply the lessons (from the first four games) moving forward.”",
        "Francisco Alvarez said, “That is why we are here in the playoffs. He gives confidence to every player.”",
        "Mendoza acknowledged that the right-hander had slipped down the bullpen hierarchy; when he came into the game Thursday, he’d allowed five runs in his last three outings."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The series is not over, and the belief that Mendoza has instilled all season still reverberates in a Mets clubhouse that has beaten long odds before.",
        "The Dodgers’ Dave Roberts has deployed his best relief arms this postseason, using them against the top of the opposing order.",
        "Of the Dodgers’ 30 runs this series, 14 have come against a starter the third time through or a long man out of the bullpen."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The Mets have been outscored 30-9 in this series, and even Bobby Valentine on his best day doesn’t think he could overcome that kind of deficit on his own.",
        "Had the Mets started Kodai Senga in Game 2, they not only would have given the right-hander his customary extra day of rest between outings, they would have given Peterson a clearer shot to pitch in Game 4, behind their most tenuous starter in Quintana."
