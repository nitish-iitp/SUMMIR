        "The Baltimore Orioles were eliminated by the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday, continuing a string of frustrating postseason defeats.",
        "The Orioles offense failed to show up in this series, being beaten 1-0 and 2-1 in the two games, failing to generate baserunners and/or get the big hit."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Baltimore Orioles have now dropped 10 consecutive playoff games, moving them up an unfortunate group in baseball history.",
        "Only the 2004-2020 Minnesota Twins (18), the 1986-1995 Orioles (13), the 1915-1976 Phillies (11), the 1958-1991 Braves and 1980-1985 Royals (10) have lost 10 consecutive playoff games or more."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The Orioles do have the benefit of an outstanding young core though that should keep them in contention regardless. Jackson Holliday, Colton Cowser, Gunner Henderson and Jordan Westburg are all excellent players on pre-arbitration deals."
