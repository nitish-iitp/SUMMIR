Freddie Freeman was once again the hero for L.A., blasting a two-run home run in the first inning as the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees 4-2 in Game 3 of the World Series on Monday night.

The Dodgers also received five scoreless innings from starter Walker Buehler, and the L.A. bullpen once again kept the Yankees in check until Alex Verdugo's two-run homer with two outs in the ninth.

Now, the Dodgers hold a commanding 3-0 series lead and can clinch the franchise's eighth world championship with a win in Game 4 on Tuesday.

Here are the highlights from Game 3!

Ninth inning

TOP 9

Aside from Shohei Ohtani advancing to first when he caught an errant pitch from Luke Weaver off the tip of his shoe, the Dodgers went quietly in their half. Mookie Betts hit into an easy double play to end L.A.'s turn at bat, setting the Yankees up for one last chance.

BOTTOM 9

Rowan Kavner: For 26 outs, the Yankees were held without a run. By the time Alex Verdugo launched a two-run homer in the ninth inning, most of the first deck of Yankee Stadium had already cleared out. It was too little, too late. The Dodgers are one win away from winning the World Series, with four chances to do it.

Oct 28, 2024 - 11:22a ET
Eighth inning

TOP 8

Clayton Holmes and Tommy Kahnle did their jobs, combining for a perfect eighth to give the Yankees hitters another chance to close the gap. But with only six outs to go at this point, New York was running out of time.

BOTTOM 8

Ryan Brasier replaced Anthony Banda and faced the heart of the Yankees lineup. After retiring Juan Soto (fly ball to right), he walked Aaron Judge, but then struck out Giancarlo Stanton and Jazz Chisholm. Suddenly, the Dodgers were three outs away from a 3-0 series lead.

Oct 28, 2024 - 11:12a ET
Seventh inning

TOP 7

Freddie Freeman fouled a ball off his right ankle, the same ankle that forced him to miss some time earlier in the postseason. Yet he still legged out a fielder's choice, then managed to get to third on a two-out single by Teoscar Hernandez. Clayton Holmes got out of the jam, however, striking out Max Muncy.

BOTTOM 7

Deesha Thosar: The Yankees can't find a clutch hit to save their lives. For a second consecutive inning, New York took better at-bats against Dodgers relievers and found ways to at least get in scoring position. And each time, the Yankees lineup has done the opposite of what the Dodgers lineup has been excellent at achieving: passing the baton. Instead, the Yankees are just hitting speed bump after speed bump. In the latest example, with two outs and runners on first and second, Gleyber Torres struck out looking on what should've been the third ball of his at-bat. Yankees manager Aaron Boone, known for his fiery arguments with umpires over the strike zone, just calmly shook his head from his position in the dugout. Jazz Chisholm, who threw both of his hands up, was more exasperated by the missed call than his skipper. Top to bottom, the Yankees are being drained of their energy.

Oct 28, 2024 - 10:34a ET
Sixth inning

TOP 6

The Dodgers added some insurance. With one out, Gavin Lux was hit by a pitch. He then stole second base, and sprinted home on a single by Kiké Hernández. Unlike his last close play at the plate, this time Lux was safe, and L.A. held a 4-0 lead.

BOTTOM 6

Rowan Kavner: After the Padres' six-run second inning in Game 3 of the NLDS, Buehler finished the outing with three important scoreless innings that helped save the bullpen. Then, in Game 3 of the NLCS, he tossed four scoreless innings. In Game 3 of the World Series, he fired five. That’s now 12 straight scoreless frames from the Dodgers starter, who has started to look like his old self again, especially in the biggest moments. Dave Roberts turned to their bullpen with the Yankees’ lineup turning over a third time in the sixth. They threatened against Brusdar Graterol, but Alex Vesia extinguished the threat. Despite Giancarlo Stanton’s best efforts, the Yankees are starved for offense right now.

Fifth inning

TOP 5

Three up, three down for the Dodgers, and Nestor Cortes was doing his best to keep the Yankees in this one. Through 1.2 innings, the left-hander allowed no base runners, striking out one.

BOTTOM 5

Annnd three up, three down for the Yankees. Walker Buehler's night was done, and what a night it was — two hits, two walks and zero runs allowed.

Oct 28, 2024 - 9:52a ET
Fourth inning

TOP 4

With runners on first and third and nobody out, Tommy Edman dropped down a squeeze bunt. Gavin Lux sprinted home and tried to sneak his hand in there under the tag/knee of Yankees catcher Jose Trevino. He was called out, however, and the Dodgers' replay review request was also denied. 

It remained 3-0, but Yankees manager Aaron Boone dipped into his pen again, bringing in Nestor Cortes. Cortes retired Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts, helping the Yankees avoid further damage.

BOTTOM 4

Buehler surrendered his first hit, a one-out double by Giancarlo Stanton. One out later, Anthony Volpe singled to left, and Stanton lumbered for home to try to put the Yankees on the board. But just as Lux was denied in the top of the inning, Stanton was also denied in the bottom, gunned down by a nice throw from Teoscar Hernandez.

Deesha Thosar: The Dodgers are beginning to feel inevitable. The Yankees, after barely being challenged in the ALDS and ALCS, have been unable to overwhelm L.A. on either side of the ball through two games and four innings in this World Series. Just when Nestor Cortes escaped a bases-loaded jam that could've been a turning point for the Yankees, the offense couldn't come through. After a rare Anthony Volpe single, Giancarlo Stanton and his sloth-like speed were thrown out at the plate for the final out of the fourth. For the second straight game, New York is making a three-run deficit feel like a 10-run Dodgers' lead.

Oct 28, 2024 - 9:37a ET
Third inning

TOP 3

Rowan Kavner: We have reached danger territory in the Bronx. Mookie Betts worked a nine-pitch at-bat before poking an RBI single to right field to increase the lead to 3-0. The Dodgers are threatening for more in the third, arms are already getting warm in the Yankees' bullpen, and you can feel the tension in the crowd.

Deesha Thosar: Clarke Schmidt lasting just 2.2 innings before leaving his outing with the bases loaded was not how the Yankees envisioned Game 3 going. Monday night was Schmidt's shortest start since August 14, 2023, when the Braves tagged him for eight runs in 2.1 innings. Outside of Gerrit Cole, Schmidt entered the World Series as one of New York's most reliable starters, but his early exit is a testament to the depth and excellent plate approach the Dodgers' lineup has.

BOTTOM 3

Are the Yankees bats going to wake up? Not if Walker Buehler has anything to say about it. He struck out two more in a scoreless third. The right-hander has struck out five and walked two in three innings, and he has yet to allow a hit. If there is a silver lining for New York, Walker is already at 53 pitches. 

Rowan Kavner: The Yankees' starting pitching was, seemingly, one of their biggest advantages entering this series. Through three innings of Game 3, Buehler has yet to allow a run while Schmidt is already out of the game. Yankees starters, to this point, have a 6.00 ERA this series (despite Gerrit Cole allowing one run in six innings in Game 1). The maligned Dodgers' starters, meanwhile, currently have a 1.84 ERA.

Second inning

TOP 2

Yankees starter Clark Schmidt had a much easier time of it in the second, striking out two. After Schmidt fanned Gavin Lux on a nasty breaking ball that dipped down-and-in outside the zone, John Smoltz said: "That's the pitch Freddie Freeman is going to see next time up."

BOTTOM 2

Rowan Kavner: Walker Buehler struggled to miss bats as he grinded through the regular season, but he got more swings and misses his last time out in the NLCS than he had in any game since 2021. He has picked up where he left off early on tonight. His fastball in particular seems to have some extra life to it, inducing five swings-and-misses through two innings. Opponents hit .342 against the pitch during the regular season.

While this was happening, Yankees fans were passing the hat for soon-to-be free agent Juan Soto.

Oct 28, 2024 - 8:52a ET
First inning

TOP 1

Rowan Kavner: Four pitches, four balls to Shohei Ohtani to start the night. I'm sure the Dodgers are just fine with him reaching without having to swing once. Interesting to note, he's still holding his left arm against his chest even while leading off at first base. He certainly doesn't look as comfortable as the Dodgers made it seem. Well, easy jog around the bases for Ohtani, too. Freddie Freeman has done it again. His two-run shot, this one on a two-strike pitch, is his third straight game with a homer to start the 2024 World Series. It's also his fifth straight World Series game with a home run, going back to the Braves' 2021 title run.

Freddie Freeman MASHES a two-run homer to give Dodgers early lead

BOTTOM 1

Deesha Thosar: The crowd was already a little nervous and on edge before the first pitch, what with the Yankees being down 0-2 and needing a fast start in Game 3. Freeman's two-run shot off a Clarke Schmidt cutter all but took the crowd out of it in the first inning. The Yankees jumbotron is imploring the crowd to "make some noise," but it's the Yankees bats that have to get loud.

Deesha Thosar: In a show of support from the home crowd, Aaron Judge received a standing ovation and MVP chants ahead of his first at-bat of the night. If it lifted his spirits, that didn't translate onto the field. When the Yankees absolutely had to respond to Freeman's early shot, and Gleyber Torres led off the inning with a walk, Judge struck out for the seventh time in 10 at-bats in this World Series. The Yankees' Big 3 all came up empty against Walker Buehler in the bottom of the first. There's still a lot of game left, but New York has put itself in the position where it has to win every at-bat. They have a lot of work to do.

Pregame scene

Rowan Kavner: The last Yankees' home game was nearly two weeks ago, in Game 2 of the ALCS. Their fans have been waiting for this, and they're out in full force for their first home game of the World Series. There were a decent number of Yankees fans in L.A., and the Dodgers tend to travel well, too, but right now it looks like a sea of midnight navy and white jerseys in the crowd.

Deesha Thosar: Shohei Ohtani ran out for player introductions with his left arm being supported by some sort of black harness, two days after partially dislocating his shoulder. He was the only player in the Dodgers' starting lineup wearing a blue jacket over his uniform, presumably in an attempt to hide the harness, which could suggest his injury is more severe than the Dodgers are letting on. It will be interesting how effective he'll be at the plate.

WHO WILL WIN TONIGHT?

Going by the pregame picks, it looks like it will be an easy one for the Yankees.

ROLL CALL, BUT NOT FOR PAPI

During the pregame show, Yankees fans chanted the names of FOX broadcasters — and former Yankees champions — Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez.

But then when it came around to David Ortiz, who rose to fame as a star for New York's rival Boston Red Sox, the greeting was vastly different.

Starting lineups include Shohei Ohtani

Shohei Ohtani, who injured his left shoulder late in the Dodgers' Game 2 victory over the Yankees, is in the lineup for Game 3, leading off and DHing. 

Both teams announced their starting lineups on Monday afternoon. Here they are, with only some minor changes. Click here for more on Game 3.

"If you keep the best player in the game in the lineup, that’s usually good for your team," Dodgers infielder Max Muncy said, according to The Associated Press. "Having him in there, obviously it’s a big guy to have in there. It helps a lot. He’s had some big moments for us, and we’re obviously expecting a couple more big moments out of him."

Muncy said Ohtani informed teammates late Saturday night he would be available this week in New York.

"He texted the whole team as we were on our way to the airport and said he was going to be fine, and that’s it. He said he was going to play, so we all put it to the side at that moment," Muncy said. "We said, all right, he’s got us. We’ll be ready for him to be in the lineup."

Ohtani was hurt sliding into second base when he was caught stealing to end the seventh inning of Saturday night's 4-2 victory in Game 2 at Los Angeles.

He clutched his left forearm after being tagged by shortstop Anthony Volpe on a feetfirst slide. Ohtani laid near the bag for a couple of minutes before being tended to by athletic trainers and leaving the field.

"Obviously, it was very tough in the moment to see him in pain like that," Muncy said. "We were two innings away from winning that ballgame. We knew we had to refocus. Obviously, it sucks seeing Sho in that kind of pain, but we still had a job to do in the moment.

"After the game we all checked on him to see how he was doing. It was like a buffet line going in there to see how he’s doing. Yeah, it was tough in the moment, but we refocused to win the game."
