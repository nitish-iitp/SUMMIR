    "New Records": [
        "Corey Seager became the first purely left-handed-hitting shortstop in Major League history to hit 200 home runs and the 15th shortstop overall to do so."
    ],
    "Key Match Events": [
        "Seager crushed his 200th career home run, a Statcast-projected 406-foot blast to right, in the fourth inning of the Rangers' 2-1 win over the White Sox that completed the three-game sweep at Guaranteed Rate Field."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Manager Bruce Bochy said earlier this week when asked of Seager's looming milestone, 'We're talking about one of the best hitters in the game. We're talking about a very gifted player who can do some amazing things with the bat, especially on the slugging side, even the hitting side.... He's got a lot more in there, too. Trust me.'"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Marcus Semien said, 'We knew coming into free agency we had a chance to collectively hit a lot of home runs. You just want to help the team win. Obviously, one swing of the bat today was the difference. I think he's going to do a lot more damage in years in the future, too.'"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Seager's milestone accounts for those who played shortstop in at least 50 percent of their career games. He joined the Mets' Francisco Lindor (243 career homers) and Rangers teammate Marcus Semien (233) as the only active players on the list."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Seager has hit at least 30 home runs in each of his three seasons with the Rangers, including a career-high 33 in both 2022 and '23."
