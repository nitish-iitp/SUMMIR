        "The Braves have been in a pseudo-do-or-die mode for a while now, but on Wednesday night, they will face their second elimination game in three contests. After last night's 4-0 loss in San Diego, the Braves now need to win two in a row to advance... or they'll be sent packing with another first round exit.",
        "The Braves are running out a zombified lineup that has to perpetually deal with the fact that there are a bunch of blah bats in it, and all the ball-in-play shenanigans even when balls are struck well, and while they do generally score enough to make good on the excellent pitching they get nearly every day, there's no more time for 'generally' at this point. Either they overcome the zombies and/or the increased drag, or they don't and that's it for 2024."

        "Max Fried is starting for the Braves, and Joe Musgrove is starting for the Padres. Fried has a 3.4 fWAR in 29 starts this season, and Musgrove has a 1.4 fWAR in 19 starts spanning 99 2/3 innings. Musgrove's line is a pretty good 98/98/92, albeit with an elevated xERA that suggests that he too can give up and subsequently strand some hard-hit doubles or whatever."
