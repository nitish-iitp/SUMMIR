    "Others": [
        "Ryan O'Hearn has shown flashes of potential this season, particularly in clutch moments",
        "His batting average stands at.241 with 15 home runs, and he has a respectable.305 on-base percentage",
        "O'Hearn's ability to hit left-handed pitching has been a significant part of his game, which could play a role against Burnes",
        "In recent games, O'Hearn has been consistent, averaging over 1.5 hits per game in his last five outings",
        "The Orioles' pitching presence has been strong, with a sixth-ranked team ERA in the AL at 3.94",
        "Corbin Burnes has been a standout pitcher for the Orioles, leading the team with 150 strikeouts",
        "Burnes's approach to attacking hitters with his slider makes him a tough matchup, but O'Hearn's recent form suggests he could find success against him",
        "The odds for over 1.5 hits at +185 are enticing, especially given O'Hearn's recent consistency at the plate",
        "The over for total bases at -105 also looks promising, as he has been known to capitalize on pitches left over the middle of the plate",
        "The White Sox's starting pitcher, Chris Flexen, has had a challenging season, recording a 2-13 record with a 5.29 ERA",
        "Flexen's inability to go deep into games has taxed the White Sox bullpen, which has struggled this season",
        "The Orioles' bullpen has been a strength, with a 3.94 ERA, and they have consistently delivered in high-leverage situations"
