        "“It’s great to put runs on the board,” Peña said. “That’s what we try to do. I feel like whenever we’ve got a lead our pitching staff does a great job of completing the game, so that’s what we try to do — get some runs on the board and let our pitching staff do their thing.”",
        "“I got hit around a little bit today,” Kikuchi said through a translator. “But I didn’t give up a walk and kept the team in the game, so I’m happy about that.”",
        "“That was the swing of the game,” Astros manager Joe Espada said. “Driving that ball the opposite way, which is not easy in this ballpark, to go oppo like that, but I thought overall our approach was really, really good today offensively.”",
        "“We didn’t execute in some critical times on the mound,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. “We made some mistakes defensively. There’s just a couple of things we can pinpoint that will show up, as it did today, with big crooked numbers and a big score against a team like this when you don’t play it to the level you’re capable of playing.”"
