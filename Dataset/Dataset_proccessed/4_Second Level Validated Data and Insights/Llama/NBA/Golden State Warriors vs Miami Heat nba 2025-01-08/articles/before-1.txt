The Miami Heat earned a crucial bounce-back 114-98 win Tuesday night against the Golden State Warriors on the second night of a back-to-back.

The Heat entered Tuesday night off a double-overtime loss to the Sacramento Kings after blowing a 17-point fourth-quarter lead. Miami owned a 14-point second-half lead with 6:38 left in the third quarter. A handful of Warrior triples plus Stephen Curry’s three-point play with 9:54 left cut their deficit to one. But two straight Nikola Jovic corner 3s followed by Alec Burks’ above-the-break triple made it a 10-point Heat advantage with over eight minutes left.

Miami didn’t let the lead dip below seven points the rest of the game, shooting 55.0 percent (11-20) and 5-of-11 from 3-point range in the period.

Nikola Jovic led the team with 20 points on 8-of-17 shooting, adding six rebounds, four assists and one steal in 34 minutes. Bam Adebayo had a terrific all-around bounce-back performance after an offensive clunker Monday night, tallying 19 points and nine rebounds on 9-of-14 shooting. Terry Rozier hilariously prevented Bam from securing another double-double, however.

Jaime Jaquez continued being aggressive and decisive, adding 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting with five rebounds; Duncan Robinson had 12 points on 4-of-5 from deep, though he dished out a team-most eight dimes, consistently making the right reads off movement (DHOs) all night.

Even though the Heat finished a minus-four on the glass, they turned the ball over less while having 32 assists on 43 made baskets. The rock was consistently finding the open man–especially down the stretch in the second half–putting the defense in rotation and spreading the wealth.

Miami’s win on Tuesday snaps their three-game losing streak, moving them to 18-17. They will now try to enact revenge on the Utah Jazz, who beat them by 36 last week inside Kaseya Center, on Thursday.

Phoenix Suns Offer Jimmy Butler $121M! Kevin Durant DEMANDS Trade Happens NOW!

Hey, I have a solution that should make everyone happy.

Bradley Beal doesn’t want to give up his no trade clause
Miami doesn’t want Beal or his contract even if he does agree to a trade
Jimmy Butler wants to go only to Phoenix
Phoenix is willing to give Jimmy the two year extension he wants
Kevin Durant has agreed to sign an extension if Jimmy is traded to Phoenix

The solution is very simple. Instead of Beal, Phoenix should agree to trade Devin Booker to Miami for Jimmy Butler. The money works. Their salaries are only $407,000 apart.

(Follow me for more trade solutions)

Beal is the Old Maid card. Right now, Phoenix is stuck with him. Let their problem remain their problem. We have our own. Plus, he wants to stay in Phoenix and won’t wave his no trade clause. Look somewhere else cuz “that dog won’t hunt.”

Beal ain’t better then Ingram, only thing Beal does better is shooting. Ingram plays better D, better rebounder, playmaking is about the same for both. Also Ingram has way better length for his position, and younger.

Why the Miami Heat won’t rush into a Jimmy Butler trade
﻿
“With Butler’s actions on and off the court seen by Heat officials as increasingly problematic, team sources say they opted to sit him for the entirety of this trip so that the issues could be addressed in earnest when the team returns home rather than on the road.”
﻿
“In the wake of Butler’s trade request and subsequent suspension, team officials told Heat players that the prospect of the 35-year-old, six-time All-Star returning to the court with them after the suspension was the most likely next step.”

State of the right know:

-Herro is less effective as he was, maybe there is a bit of the slump or defences started to focus on him.
-Bam is very inconsistent, from really bad to great.
-Rosier doesn’t play well this year.
-JJJ show the glimpse of the promise in past two games.
-Jovic is played very good past 5 games.
-Ware is a rookie, and it shows.
-Dunc is very inconsistent.
-HH is not playing well for longer period.

Love, Pelle doesn’t play much.

The team is hovering around 50 %, but there is softer schedule ahead. With a bit more consistency maybe there is a chance for a run.

With Miami, Beal could immediately plug into its starting five, attempting to fill the scoring void that Butler’s departure would create. While it is fair to argue that one would take Butler over Beal, the latter would be the best player the Heat could realistically acquire in a Butler trade.
Beal and Tyler Herro would serve as a lethal scoring duo for the Heat,

Brandon Ingram is on an expiring contract. There are several other players possibly available, e.g., Julius Randle. Miles Turner, Fred VanVleet, John Collins, etc. Maybe a 3-way trade where Miami can get someone better than Beal. Hopefully, Riley figures it out sooner than later.

Since 2019-2020…

Ingram has played in 305 games. 60.1 games per season.Butler has played in 313 games. 62.6 games per season.Butler played 2.5 games more per season, but how many games was he “doggin it?”
Ingram career stats: 19.5ppg, 5.2 ppg/ 4.3 apgButler career stats: 18.3 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 4.3 apg
Ingram stats this year 22 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 5.2 apgButler stats this year: 17.6 ppg, 5,5 rpg, 4.7 apg
Looks like Ingram’s stats are similar to Butler’s (except for the “doggin” part.

Yes, I suspect they will. But they could also use them together and in tandem. One could go to the bench after 5 or so minutes and relieve the other at the 8-9 minute mark. But an adequate backup will be needed unless they use Jovic briefly or go small ball for short periods.

This is a “What have you done for me lately” world. You don’t pay someone tomorrow for what he did yesterday. Jimmy is not a max contract player! Dude misses 25% of the games and dogs it another 10. He should consider himself lucky to get what he’s getting. Nobody wants a quitter either. “Playoff Jimmy” will quickly become a fading memory, to be replaced by “Quitter Jimmy.”

If Jimmy doesn’t agree to a trade, I hope Riley brings him back and Spo sits his ass at the end of the bench, doesn’t play him and tells him to STFU or he’ll get another/longer suspension. Wanna play hardball Jimmy? Here you go!

GO HEAT!!!

Things are heating up in Phoenix between Bradley Beal and management/coaching staff after he was demoted to the second unit. The fans are realists and don’t expect Beal to waive his no-trade clause or Riley to be stupid enough to trade Butler to his preferred destination for a player with declining production and an enormous contract. The following comment on Bright Side of The Sun kind of summarizes the sentiment.

Cyborglives
In reply to EaglesFanOverSeas

“When he’s healthy. Huge caveat. He’s old, wants the geriatric superstar extension this off-season, and has been injured for a dozen or so games this season already. He’s basically like Beal in that regard.

The biggest red flag for me is that he wants another two years at close to $60m season which is why he is unhappy in Miami (Riley rightfully baulked at the demand).
Like I said in other posts, Riley is going to let Jimmy walk before he takes on Beal’s contract, and there isn’t another gm dumb enough to take on Beal’s contract even if he were to waive it.

But I wouldn’t put it past JJ giving him that ridiculous contract next off-season if he could. He’d throw Dunn and Oso away to make it happen if it were possible.
Thankfully the second apron makes it virtually impossible for him to do even more damage to this franchise like that. Of course I say that, and then he’ll find a way to do it.”

In the card game Old Maid, the objective is for players to pair cards up until there is only one card left, the Old Maid. If you’re the one left holding the Old Maid, you lose.

Phoenix has been stuck with the Old Maid, Bradley Beal and his bloated, no-trade contract. While his production has gone down over the years, his salary has gone up. He is due to make over $160M between this season and 2026-2027. Furthermore, he is one of only two NBA players with a no-trade clause. The other is Lebron James. Beal’s contract is one of the worst in the NBA.

Beal’s agent has indicated Beal wants to stay in Phoenix and will not waive his no-trade clause. If he were to temporarily waive the clause to allow Phoenix to trade him for Butler, the Heat would not only receive an inferior player (Beal’s defense sucks) but they would also be stuck with his three year, no-trade contract (the Old Maid).

By refusing to accept trades to teams such as Memphis and Milwaukee, Butler is trying to force Riley to trade him for Beal and his Old Maid contract. That isn’t going to happen. Meanwhile, teams (other than Phoenix) are having second thoughts about making trade offers for a player who has demonstrated no loyalty to his team or fans and has indicated he will opt out at the end of the 2024-2025 season. Which contending team will want to give up assets for a half season rental? None that I know of.

If Butler persists in making trade demands that benefit him at the expense of the Heat, while being disruptive and performing at less than 100%, he will lose all credibility. Like Beal, anyone trading for him will risk getting stuck with another Old Maid.

The ball is now in Butler’s court and it isn’t only his contract that is on the table. It is his reputation and his legacy.

Have to agree. Jimmy wants the max contract they are offering., It changes the equation, hard to feel empathy for Jimmy as no one wants that Beal contract.

Once again, Butler’s ego is getting in the way of his common sense. Oh well, it’s his legacy that he is in the process of destroying. In the end, he’ll have no one to blame but himself. I agree 100% with the following analysis* of the current situation appearing in a FANSIDED article this morning entitled: NBA Rumors: Jimmy Butler completely misplayed his hand if recent rumors are true.
﻿
“Depending on what the Grizzlies would have to give up, which probably wouldn’t be much, there’s a scenario in which Jimmy would be joining a top 3 team in the Western Conference led by Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, and Jaren Jackson Jr. If it is about winning, this could end up being a huge mistake by Jimmy.

Maybe it isn’t about winning. Maybe this is all about getting HIS way after how he’s been treated by Miami’s front office. That’s what it feels an awful lot like right now.

I understand the lure to Phoenix as Jimmy wants to close out his career by playing alongside Kevin Durant. However, for as flashy of a move that would’ve been, it’s the Grizzlies that may have given Jimmy the best shot to finish his career with an NBA Championship.

Jimmy has been effective in pressuring the Heat into this situation but he may have completely overplayed his hand with this most recent decision.”

P.S. Memphis also has emerging rookie center Zach Edey who is averaging 10.6 ppg, 7.7 rpg, on 59.4 FG%/ 39.1 3-PT% and 1.2 blocks in 24.1 mpg.

True. However, I write this comment to you and others here as I have a colleague who, I believe, is in need of an intervention. I can’t say his name, but we can call him hfl for this purpose. During the game thread, we went back and forth about him feeling we should get Bradley Beal for Butler since it would be better than nothing. I think he still perceives Beal as the Washington player who excelled in the John Wall period. So let us join together, hold hands, and sing kumbaya in the hope of bringing this poor soul back from the abyss.

It was actually SunMan that referenced his defense first. He’s not that Washington player any longer. As you can read above, he’s worse than Butler and makes more money. It would be a bad deal and the team would be worse off. And, as I said before, the deal has nothing to do with the penalties associated with the contracts.

I guess we will have to get used to some unpredictable results with this younger version of our team for the rest of the season (or until the trade at least). It is a good W, even if the Warriors seem to currently have their own share of problems, too.

Great games from both Juan wick and niko driver. I never doubted there abilities, and now we see there flourishing with no Jimmy around. Those extra Jimmy minutes are very helpful to Jaquez game in particular. I look forward to seeing the youth movement, with more of a faster pace, and better transition offense.

Excellent win after a heartbreaking loss. I thought they were going to take 2 L’s in a row after that Kings game and it being a B2B. Nope. They scored 114 and Tyler had 14, so the rest of the team really came through. Jovic is believing big time. JJJ is finally healthy. Figure out a way to get a contributor in the Jimmy trade and we might have a really fun squad come April.

I’m ready for the Heat’s next chapter. The players looked like they were having fun and are ready to move past all the drama too. Get a good player for Butler and move on.
The young guys will have their ups and downs but the only way to find out how good they can be is to play them.

The Heat need another big to rotate with Bam and Ware, so the team can have two bigs on the floor at all times. Too bad Jimmy said he didn’t want to play for Memphis or Milwaukee. Middleton and Portis for Butler would have been great.

On to Utah Wednesday. Time for a little payback!

I thought this was quite an impressive win. Jovic started playing better about five games ago and now Jaime has for the last two. Because of that, there is a little more hopefulness going forward. Maybe the team is starting to find a new identity in a post Jimmy era. Perhaps at some point Ware will start to improve similarly to JJJ and Nico, but it may not be till next year. Still, he already helps some.
Nice to know this team is still a middle of the pack team without Jimmy. And shocked that Golden State is in as much trouble as they are, apparently losing a splash brother really hurt them.
The Butler situation took a turn yesterday when it was reported that Jimmy told the Bucks and Griz to not trade for him. That changes the equation for me as Butler should want to go to either of those teams if he wants to find his joy. I guess there is no good guy in this situation. Still, every day I hope for a trade now, hope to get something that makes the Heat better now and for the future. There is no going back.
At least the Heat will stay competitive against all but the best teams. And who knows, maybe we can bounce back into contention sooner than expected if we make a smart trade.
Good job by Jaime and Nico and the Heat last night.

They were mediocre with Butler. At least without Butler, the young guys get a chance to play more, develop faster and develop confidence and chemistry for the future. They have to find a way to win without Jimmy. That won’t happen overnight. The sooner they get on with that process…the better.

Quality win with Spo doing his magic with zone defence.

There is a opportunity to collect another win or two on this road trip.

I haven’t watched every game this season. But I’ve seen some good wins. That was the best I’ve seen Bam play all season. Also the best game I’ve seen from Duncan or Jovic this season.

I’m not saying this team is better without Jimmy Butler. And I don’t know if Jimmy “found joy” by flaming the franchise. But the rest of the players seem to have found joy on the basketball court now that Jimmy is gone. It’s definitely the most fun I’ve had watching this team all season.

Trade Jimmy asap. Thanks for the memories, this team is better off without him.
