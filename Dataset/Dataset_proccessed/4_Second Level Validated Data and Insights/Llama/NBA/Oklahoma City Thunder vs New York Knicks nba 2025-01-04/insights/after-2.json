        "The Knicks dealt OKC a knockout punch in the game's second quarter, outscoring the Thunder 36-21 on the strength of swarming defense, breathtaking ball movement, astounding rebounding, and grit and hustle.",
        "The Thunder bench outscored the Knicks' second unit 44-5, including Aaron Wiggins's jolt of 19 points, which was the difference in the fourth quarter.",
        "The Bulls took control—clearly inspired by the tremendous halftime tribute for Derrick Rose—outscoring New York 41-17 in the third quarter.",
        "Chicago nailed 7-of-8 threes as a team, whereby leading Bulls scorer Coby White (33 points on the strength of nine threes) deftly became too much for the Knicks to handle.",
        "Karl-Anthony Towns went on a fourth quarter tear, willing himself to a spectacular 44-point, 16-rebound finish, with many of his points coming with Brunson and Anunoby on the bench."

        "Despite the loss, Karl-Anthony Towns's refusal to yield to defeat was an encouraging, if not telling, sign.",
        "That said, Towns hobbled to the locker room when being taken off the floor with over 90 seconds left in the game.",
        "The hope is that grimacing and histrionics are hardly a sign of Towns missing extended time."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Knicks return home Monday night for the start of a five-game homestand, welcoming a severely hobbled Orlando Magic team that is now down another star.",
        "Jalen Suggs, who suffered a non-contact back injury against the Raptors on Friday night, has since become the latest Magic casualty, and thus, collateral damage New York should exploit to compensate for the first failed test of the New Year."

    "Others": [
        "The Knicks put together a nine-game winning streak, eclipsed only by the Thunder's own 13-game streak.",
        "The Knicks' second quarter outburst was merely a glancing blow, as OKC would outscore New York 63-41 in the game's second half en route to a 117-107 victory.",
        "The Knicks' superstar Jalen Brunson fell into the same patterns that befell him on Friday: trying to do too much on his own while otherwise neglecting the capable teammates around him."
