Jonathan Kuminga scored 21 points and Stephen Curry had 12 points and six turnovers for Golden State, which lost for the first time in six road games this season. Draymond Green had six points, six assists and four fouls.

Young then drove to the basket before dishing the ball to Onyeka Okongwu, but Cunningham blocked his shot as time expired.

Young had 35 points and 13 assists. Jalen Johnson scored 20 for Atlanta.

DENVER — Nikola Jokic had 30 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds for his third straight triple-double to lead Denver past Miami.

The triple-double was Jokic’s NBA-best fifth of the season.

After missing the past three games in concussion protocol, Jamal Murray had 28 points and became the first player in Nuggets franchise history with 1,000 career 3-pointers.

The Heat played most of the game without Jimmy Butler, who turned his ankle on a drive against Murray seven minutes into the game and did not return.

Denver raced out to a 17-6 lead in the opening 4:10 as part of a 40-point first quarter in which it made 14 of its 20 shots. Though it fought back to get within seven in the final five minutes of the game, Miami never led and trailed by as many as 26 in the second half.

Tyler Herro had a team-high 24 points and 11 assists for the Heat.

LAKERS 116, 76ERS 106

Paul George scored nine points for the Sixers, who dropped to 1-7 while playing without two of their top three players. Rookie Jared McCain had 18 points for Philadelphia, which has lost five straight.

Former league MVP Joel Embiid served the second game of his three-game suspension for shoving a reporter, while All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey missed his first game with the hamstring injury that will sideline him for at least two weeks.

Bronny James played the final 1:28.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Norman Powell posted his first career double-double with 31 points and 12 rebounds, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat Sacramento for their third straight win.
