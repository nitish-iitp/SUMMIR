It wasn’t a buzzer-beater, but it was the same opponent and same fantastic finish for the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Darius Garland sank a 3-pointer with 45 seconds left and set up Jarrett Allen for a layup with 12.2 seconds remaining for the clincher as the Cleveland Cavaliers downed the visiting Milwaukee Bucks 116-114 on Monday.

Garland finished with a game-high 39 points.

The Cavaliers equaled a franchise record set in 1976-77 with their eighth straight win to start the season. Cleveland beat the Bucks 114-113 on Saturday when Donovan Mitchell sank a shot with 0.3 seconds left.

Milwaukee, which played without star Giannis Antetokounmpo (adductor), lost its sixth game in a row since a season-opening win. Damian Lillard scored 36 points and AJ Green had 21 off the bench for the Bucks. Green made a 52-footer at the final buzzer, his seventh 3-pointer of the game.

For the better part of the first three quarters, it looked like a Cleveland rout, but Milwaukee got hot at the end of the third, rallying from 73-60 down at halftime. A Brook Lopez 3-pointer tied the score at 86 with 3:43 left in the third period, and then the teams traded treys before going almost three minutes without another basket.

Milwaukee went up 106-98 on a 3-pointer by Green with 6:06 left in the fourth but didn’t score again for four minutes as the Cavaliers went on a 10-0 run highlighted by seven points from Garland — a trey and two baskets in the lane.

Cleveland appeared to take control in the first quarter, racing out to a 22-10 advantage after Garland converted a pair of free throws with 5:14 remaining. Milwaukee came back, taking a 31-30 edge on a 3-pointer by Andre Jackson Jr. with 31.3 seconds left. Garland answered with a trey and Cleveland owned a 35-31 lead after one. Mitchell had 13 points and Garland 12 in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Cleveland took a 69-50 lead on three by Garland with 2:30 left. That was the Cavaliers’ biggest lead of the contest.

Cleveland played without reserves Caris LeVert (knee) and Dean Wade (illness).

Kings 111, Heat 110

Domantas Sabonis swished a short put-back in the lane with 0.7 seconds left as the Sacramento Kings defeated the host Miami Heat 111-110 on Monday night.

After Sabonis’ rebound and basket off a De’Aaron Fox miss, Miami called timeout. On the other end, Terry Rozier missed a hurried 30-foot shot.

Fox led Sacramento with 28 points and DeMar DeRozan added 26. Sabonis had 16 points and game highs in rebounds (16) and assists (seven). Keegan Murray logged 14 points, and Malik Monk had 12.

Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro each scored 27 points for Miami while Bam Adebayo contributed 16 points and nine boards. Butler put up 15 points in the fourth quarter.

Miami’s Pelle Larsson, a rookie second-round pick, scored a career-high 13 points, and Rozier added 10.

Kevin Huerter, a Kings starter, missed his second straight game due to an illness.

Both teams were coming off games outside the U.S. on Saturday — the Kings lost in overtime at Toronto, while the Heat beat the Washington Wizards in Mexico City.

In the first quarter, Herro made 4 of 5 3-point attempt, putting up 13 points as the Heat took a 25-22 lead. There were six ties and four lead changes in that period, during which Sacramento shot just 1-for-5 from beyond the arc.

Larsson scored 12 points in the second quarter on perfect shooting: 4-for-4 from the floor, 3-for-3 on 3-point attempts and 1-for-1 at the free-throw line.

That shooting helped the Heat stretch their lead to 61-48 at halftime. DeRozan led the Kings with 11 second-quarter points, giving him 15 in the half.

Sacramento outscored Miami 37-17 in the third quarter, finishing the period on a 17-4 run. Fox had 16 points in the period — one fewer than the entire Heat squad.

Then came the fourth-quarter drama.

With 1:11 left, DeRozan made a four-point play — Herro fouled him on a made 3-pointer — to cut Miami’s lead to 108-107.

Then after Herro missed a short jumper and DeRozan grabbed the rebound. DeRozan tried for a mid-range jumper at the other end, but Herro stripped him with 37.8 seconds left.

Herro followed by sinking two free throws, but a Monk dunk with 32.2 seconds cut Miami’s lead to 110-109.

On the following possession, Butler missed a contested turnaround jumper, and Sacramento got the ball and called timeout with 9.1 seconds left. That set it up for Fox’s miss and the rebound and swish by Sabonis.

Suns 118, 76ers 116

Kevin Durant scored 15 of his game-high 35 points in the fourth quarter, including the decisive driving basket with 24 seconds left, as Phoenix rallied for a victory over visiting Philadelphia.

Former Clippers star Paul George made his 76ers debut and scored 15 points on 4-of-14 shooting. George, who missed a tying 23-foot attempt with 3.4 seconds left, sat out the 76ers’ first five games due to a left knee injury.

Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander didn’t attempt a shot until nearly nine minutes into the game but still made an early impact with seven first-quarter assists, a career high for a quarter. He finished with 21 points. Franz Wagner paced the Magic with 22 points.
