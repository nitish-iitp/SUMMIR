        "“There was a lot going on in the game plan tonight, maybe too much at times,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We might have to simplify some things early, here. But I didn’t see a lot of resistance. Even when we had an opportunity to contain, we didn’t do a good job of that early on.”",
        "“Obviously, we had a ton of turnovers,” Finch said. “Those turnovers were mostly a result of trying to do everything 1 on 5.”",
        "“We’ve got to find another level of urgency,” Finch said. “The season started, and we didn’t answer the bell.”"
