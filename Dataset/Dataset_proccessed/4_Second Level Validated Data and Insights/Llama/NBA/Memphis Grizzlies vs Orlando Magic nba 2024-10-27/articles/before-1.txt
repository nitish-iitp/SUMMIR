Ja Morant Stats Tonight (Image Source: IMAGN)

Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies faced the Orlando Magic on Saturday. The Grizzlies looked to get back in the win column after losing their second game. Saturday's matchup marked the official return of Jaren Jackson Jr. to Memphis' lineup.

The Magic lost to the Grizzlies despite looking like the better offensive team. Orlando had four players in double-scoring figures, two of which scored 20 points and above. Franz Wagner was the Magic’s top scorer after putting up 23, while Jalen Suggs scored 21 points.

The Grizzlies managed to defend the homecourt nonetheless. Santi Aldama had a solid 22-point outing. Another role player who had a remarkable performance was Jay Huff, who scored 18 points matched with 60% shooting from long-distance and 77.8% overall.

Breaking down Ja Morant's performance

Ja Morant was also quite off but managed to come up with a double-double outing. Morant had 16 points and 10 assists. The Memphis Grizzlies will take on the Chicago Bulls on Monday. Hopefully, Morant and Jackson could find their rhythm by then.

Looking at Morant's performance, he had a cold start in the first quarter. He scored only three points and clearly struggled with his shot, sinking one out of four attempts. His opening scoring numbers were still decent enough for him to replicate his 24-point outing against the Houston Rockets on Friday.

Ja Morant had a much better second-quarter performance, adding seven points to his total score. But what helped the Grizzlies a 26-point lead was Morant and the team's playmaking. Their unselfish style of play in the second period created many shot opportunities for the entire team. Morant alone had five assists before the end of the first half.

In the third quarter, Ja Morant barely did anything on offense. He struggled to shoot the ball and went scoreless. Most of his contributions in the third came from his playmaking after notching three more assists.

Morant’s struggle, the Memphis Grizzlies managed to keep their lead alive with a 90-78 third-quarter finish. Ultimately, the Grizzlies came up with a 124-111 victory over the Magic.
