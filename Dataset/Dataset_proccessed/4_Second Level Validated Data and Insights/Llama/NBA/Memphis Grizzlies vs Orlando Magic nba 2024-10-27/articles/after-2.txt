Yuki Kawamura sees action against Magic, but he's still seeking his first NBA points

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- With the Grizzlies comfortably ahead of the Orlando Magic, the calls for Japanese reserve Yuki Kawamura grew louder and louder.

"We want Yuki. We want Yuki," the Memphis faithful screamed.

With just over two minutes left, and the Grizzlies comfortably on their way to a 124-111 victory Saturday night, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins sent Kawamura to the scorer's table as the crowd and his teammates yelled with delight.

"It was a special moment," Kawamura said with a big smile after the game. "I love it."

The Grizzlies signed Kawamura to two-way deal earlier this month after the preseason finale. Kawamura earned the deal after playing in all five preseason games coming off the bench and averaging 3.4 points and 4.2 assists per game. He played the past five seasons in the Japanese B.League and was the 2022-23 Most Valuable Player with the Yokohama B-Corsairs.

His 5-foot-8 stature and electric smile have made him an immediate crowd favorite. In his two minutes against the Magic, he missed both 3-point attempts -- with a lot of encouragement from just about everyone in the arena -- and had a turnover. He has appeared in two games, but still hasn't scored his first points in the NBA.

"I told him, he got to score his points," Memphis guard Ja Morant said. "You know, he's a tremendous passer, but man, he got to get his name in the paper. So my message today was: 'If you get it, shoot it.'"

Kawamura is the second Japanese player in Grizzlies' history, joining Yuta Watanabe who played 38 games for the Grizzlies during his initial stint between 2018-19 to 2019-20. Watanabe returned to Memphis and played five games during the 2023-24 season.

"It was so amazing," Kawamura said. "Great team win, but I could have done more. I keep working hard every day."
