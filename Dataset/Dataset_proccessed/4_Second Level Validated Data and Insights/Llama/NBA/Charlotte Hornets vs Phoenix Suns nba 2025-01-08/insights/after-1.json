        "The Phoenix Suns have now lost 8 of their last 10 games.",
        "Phoenix started off the first quarter strong, but a 26-6 run to close the first half by Charlotte gave the Hornets all the momentum they needed the rest of the night.",
        "The Suns now sit at 16-19 on the season, which makes them 12th in the Western Conference, and have lost eight of their last 10 matchups.",
        "Phoenix has not won consecutive games since Dec. 3.",
        "The Suns have seemingly had no answers for teams built on youth who are athletic and like to run.",
        "Charlotte dominated the fastbreak points 26-4, which is by far the largest margin the Suns have lost this category in a single game this season.",
        "The Hornets also grabbed 20 offensive rebounds and outrebounded the Suns 59-42 in total.",
        "They won the second chance points 19-9, as the Suns only recorded eight offensive rebounds."

    "Others": [
        "The loss came one day after Phoenix snapped a four-game losing skid with a big win over the Philadelphia 76ers and made a drastic lineup change, moving Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkic to the bench and replacing them with Ryan Dunn and Mason Plumlee.",
        "Phoenix simply needs to find lineup combinations that work and stick with them moving forward.",
        "Booker and Durant need more help both when they are playing well and when they are having a down night, and the loss to Charlotte proved exactly that."
