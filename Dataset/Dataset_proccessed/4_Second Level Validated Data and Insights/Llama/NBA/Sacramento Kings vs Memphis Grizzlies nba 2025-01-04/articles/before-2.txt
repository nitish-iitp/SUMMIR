But the Kings went on a 20-10 run to regain the lead capped with a 3-pointer by Monk with 4:21 remaining.

Zach Edey returned from a two-game absence due to a concussion and had nine points and seven rebounds off the bench.

Ja Morant (right AC joint strain) and Marcus Smart (right index finger) did not play. Keegan Murray missed his second straight game for the Kings (left ankle soreness).

Kings guard Devin Carter, the son of Grizzlies assistant coach Anthony Carter, made his debut with the team in the first quarter. The No. 13 overall selection in the 2024 draft out of Providence underwent left shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum last July.
