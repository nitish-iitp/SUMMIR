        "The Raptors did as they’ve done too often lately, looking overmatched enough to rub the veil of rebuilding threadbare.",
        "Blake Murphy noted the difference between competitive losses with positive developmental signs versus getting run off the floor and looking disinterested; Wednesday we got a look at both, half-to-half."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Immanuel Quickley looked solid, scoring 22 points on 7-of-12 shooting.",
        "The Raptors’ inattention to detail showed, like doubling off Brunson to help on OG Anunoby in an unthreatening elbow post-up position.",
        "Eugene Omoruyi is joining the Raptors on a 10-day contract, the team announced during the fourth quarter.",
        "Omoruyi has been the standout player on Raptors 905 since joining the team a few weeks into the season."

        "Scottie Barnes’ first six shots of the game came in the 10-to-19 foot range, where he’s really been trying to establish himself since Quickley’s return."
