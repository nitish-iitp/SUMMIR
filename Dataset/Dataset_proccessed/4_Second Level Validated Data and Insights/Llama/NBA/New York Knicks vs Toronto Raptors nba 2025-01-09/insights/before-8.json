        "Chris Boucher went on an all-time 'get-me-out-of-bench-purgatory' three-minute, 10-point, plus-11 run",
        "Immanuel Quickley went on a personal 6-0 run, getting to the free-throw line twice, knocking down a pull-up transition three, coming up with a steal, and blocking a Landry Shamet corner three"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "The Raptors did as they’ve done too often lately, looking overmatched enough to rub the veil of rebuilding threadbare",
        "Some of these mistakes are acceptable if they’re accompanied by 48 minutes of effort and intensity. That wasn’t the case here, with a healthy and decently rested Raptors team playing hard for a half and then losing the rope once again"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Scottie Barnes’ first six shots of the game came in the 10-to-19 foot range, where he’s really been trying to establish himself since Quickley’s return",
        "Ochai Agbaji left the game in the second quarter after suffering a lower back contusion in a rebounding collision with Josh Hart",
        "Eugene Omoruyi is joining the Raptors on a 10-day contract, the team announced during the fourth quarter"

    "Others": [
        "The Raptors are back in action on Thursday in Cleveland (7 p.m. ET / 4 p.m. PT, Sportsnet One, Sportsnet+), against a Cavaliers team that beat the Thunder on Wednesday"
