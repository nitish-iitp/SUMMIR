The Utah Jazz invade the Kia Center to do battle with the Orlando Magic on Sunday night. Here’s an Orlando Magic vs Utah Jazz Prediction. This article will include an Orlando Magic vs Utah Jazz Pick.
Utah Jazz
The Utah Jazz have been in a real funk as they’ve lost eight of their last 11 games overall, but they will be feeling much better after arresting a five-game losing streak with a 136-100 road win over the Heat last night. Brice Sensabaugh led the team with 34 points on 12 of 18 shooting off the bench, John Collins added 24 points with nine rebounds and three blocks while Collin Sexton chipped in with 17 points, five rebounds, and eight assists.
As a team, the Jazz shot a healthy 52 percent from the field and 19 of 46 from the 3-point line. The Jazz caught fire early and poured in 40 points in the second quarter to take a 21-point lead into halftime that only grew in the second half, where the Jazz exploded for 74 points. The Jazz will play the Hawks, Heat, Suns, Nets, and Hornets next.
Orlando Magic
Meanwhile, the Orlando Magic have been doing it tough lately as they’ve lost six of their last 10 games overall, but they will be hoping to build some momentum after sneaking past the struggling Raptors in a 106-97 road win on Friday. Tristan da Silva led the team with 25 points on nine of 13 shooting, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 15 points while Goga Bitadze chipped in with 11 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists.
As a team, the Magic shot 46 percent from the field and 19 of 44 from the 3-point line. The Magic stormed out of the gates with 37 points in the first quarter to build a 22-point lead which was more than enough to hold off a late rally from the Raptors despite scoring just 18 points in the fourth quarter. The Magic will play the Knicks, Timberwolves, Bucks, 76ers, and Celtics next.
Why the Orlando Magic will win
The Magic have won each of their last 28 home games against teams that held a losing record.
The Jazz have lost 17 of their last 18 games against opponents who are on the first leg of a back-to-back.
The Magic have covered the spread in nine of their last 10 home games following a win.
The Jazz have failed to cover the spread in five of their last six games against opponents who are on the first leg of a back-to-back.
Why the Utah Jazz will win
The Magic have lost three of their last four games as favorites against Western Conference opponents following a win.
The Jazz have won each of their last five games against the Magic following a road win.
The Magic have failed to cover the spread in each of their last five games on the first leg of a back-to-back against Western Conference opponents.
The Jazz have covered the spread in each of their last five games against the Magic following a road win.
Total Points Facts
Each of the Jazz’s last seven games on the second leg of a back-to-back has gone UNDER the total points line.
Seven of the Magic’s last eight home games against Western Conference opponents have gone UNDER the total points line.
Orlando Magic vs Utah Jazz Prediction
The Jazz are still missing Jordan Clarkson, while the Magic have been hit hard by injuries with players like Paolo Banchero, Gary Harris, Moritz Wagner, and Franz Wagner all out again. The Jazz have been one of the coldest teams in the league lately. The Jazz looked like a completely different team in last night’s big upset win over the Heat, while the Magic were going through some major struggles before they took down the lowly Raptors on Friday. Earlier in the season, I would be all over the Magic to take care of business at home. However, given that they are missing three of their best players, I am leaning towards the Jazz to take advantage and push the depleted Magic in a close contest.
