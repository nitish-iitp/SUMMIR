Dallas

The Mavericks lost Luka Doncic to injury on a Christmas Day game against Minnesota (99:105) and then went on a road trip where they beat Phoenix (98:89), but then lost three games in a row. Dallas also failed against Portland (122:126), Sacramento (100:110) and Houston (99:110).

The Mavericks have had a bit of a rough start, but they're still holding strong in fifth place in the Western Conference, right on the edge of the playoff zone. But, as we all know, without Doncic, the Texas team hasn't been doing too well and they're likely to fall out of the top 6 in the West pretty soon.

Cleveland

The Cavaliers, on the other hand, are still leading the Eastern Conference since the start of the championship, and they're not planning on giving up that spot any time soon. In fact, Kenny Atkinson's team is only increasing the gap from their pursuers. Cleveland is now 5.0 wins ahead of second Boston, and the Cavs themselves have only failed 4 games out of 33 this season. Just ahead of the meeting with Dallas, Cleveland has a streak of eight straight wins. Now, to repeat, the club from Ohio State has a tour of the West, already securing three victories. First, the Cavs beat Denver (149:135) in a very efficient meeting, and then they defeated Golden State (113:95) and the Los Angeles Lakers (122:110) by double-digit score differences.

Expert Betting Tips

Dallas is missing Luka Doncic and is not being considered as strong contenders against the likes of Cleveland. They've also lost four previous head-to-head meetings with the Cavaliers. We predict that the Eastern Conference leaders will win the upcoming game, which will be their ninth consecutive victory. We're also betting on a total of points. Firstly, the rivals have rarely reached the total set for the upcoming game in recent years in head-to-head meetings. Secondly, Dallas has problems, primarily in attack due to Doncic's absence .Also, we're betting on Cleveland's handicap on fouls.
