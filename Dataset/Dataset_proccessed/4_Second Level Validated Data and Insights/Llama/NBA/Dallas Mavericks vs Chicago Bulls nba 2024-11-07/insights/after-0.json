        "The Mavericks played faster and the ball was whizzing around the court, which meant fewer half-court sets that gave defenders time to gear up for a stand.",
        "The Mavericks were up 56-45 at halftime, and one of the reasons the Bulls were still in the game is that they had a plus-10 rebounding advantage late in the first half.",

    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Mavericks were missing three rotation players (one of them starter P.J. Washington) but were able to mix and match to get the job done.",
        "Marshall's versatility was lauded by Coach Kidd, and he was plus-18 during his 21 minutes on the floor.",
        "The Mavericks' roster is deep enough to withstand injuries."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The depth on the front line is going to be tested for however long Lively, Washington, and Kleber are out.",
        "The Mavericks won't be able to rack up 30-ish assists every game, simply because some teams will play a slower pace or game-plan to force one-on-one play."
