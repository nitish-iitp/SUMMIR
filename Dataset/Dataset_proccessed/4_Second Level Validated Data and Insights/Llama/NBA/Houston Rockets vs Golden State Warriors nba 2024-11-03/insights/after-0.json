        "Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski flashed star scoring chops when the Warriors needed them most against the Rockets.",
        "The Rockets didn't give Golden State much of a chance to squander a lead in overtime, missing their first five shots while falling behind multiple possessions.",
        "Draymond Green airmailed an inbounds pass to Andrew Wiggins, then inexplicably fouled Eason on a drive—not just automatically sending Houston's live-wire forward to the free throw line to tie the game, but automatically sending himself to the bench for good with a disqualifying sixth foul."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "I was so proud of the guys for the way they responded to what was an onslaught from Houston that second half, and especially fourth quarter,” Steve Kerr said on the postgame podium.",
        "Great experience. To win after Draymond fouls out, to win without Steph, to win on a night when a game just completely flipped.",
        "It's great to have that game on tape, it's great to feel it,” he continued, “because we're gonna have to get better when we face that kind of defense."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Warriors were up 28 points at halftime and then went on to win the game 127-121.",
        "The Rockets were overwhelmed early by the Dubs' all-around pace and continuity of movement in both the halfcourt and transition.",
        "Curry's absence only made that decision easier for Udoka. What Houston couldn't have counted on, though, is Podziemski making hay in those forced one-on-one opportunities when Golden State needed points most."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Jonathan Kuminga tapped into his own singular identity as a scorer after the final buzzer of regulation.",
        "Brandin Podziemski said of his scoring binge after the game, 'I'm slow myself, so I never try to get sped up. But the one thing my people back home have just been stressing to me is when they speed up you slow down, and when they try to slow you down you speed up.'"
