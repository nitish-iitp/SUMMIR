Sharjah 24 – AFP: The San Antonio Spurs secured a narrow 113-110 victory over the Denver Nuggets in a tense matchup in the American Basketball League. With just 4 seconds remaining, Victor Wembanyama intercepted a crucial pass from Nikola Jokic, helping the Spurs hold onto their slim lead and clinch the win.

Wembanyama was the standout performer, finishing with 35 points and 18 rebounds, leading his team to victory. Despite the loss, Nuggets star Jokic delivered an exceptional performance, scoring 41 points, grabbing 18 rebounds, and providing 9 assists.

Key moments in the final seconds

With just 17 seconds left on the clock, San Antonio led by a single point, giving Denver a chance to steal the game. Jokic attempted to pass the ball to a teammate, but Wembanyama made a crucial steal and quickly passed it to Devin Vassell. Vassell then scored a layup that sealed the victory for the Spurs.

In a dramatic finish, Michael Porter Jr. of Denver missed a 34-foot three-pointer in the dying moments, which would have forced overtime. Porter finished the game with 22 points, and the Nuggets' three-game winning streak was snapped.
