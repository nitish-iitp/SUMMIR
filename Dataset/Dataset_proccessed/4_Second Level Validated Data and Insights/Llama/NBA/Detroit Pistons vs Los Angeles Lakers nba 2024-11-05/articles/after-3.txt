"We're all disappointed": JJ Redick describes mood in Lakers locker room after grim loss to Pistons

JJ Redick was a picture of disappointment after the LA Lakers blew the game 115-103 to the Detroit Pistons on Monday (Nov. 4). The Lakers were thoroughly outplayed by the hosts at the Little Ceasar's Area as the likes of Jaden Ivey and Tim Hardaway Jr. put the screws on LA to hand them a 12-point defeat. Redick didn't hold back on the mistakes the side made and also added that the side was disappointed with the outcome.

Speaking to the media after the game, Redick rued the lack of defense displayed by LA to start the game. They trailed 67-53 heading into halftime, and the closest they got to was a seven-point deficit.

The Lakers appeared to be no match as Detroit started strong and held on to its lead right from the start. Barring Anthony Davis' 37 points and LeBron James' 20-point game coupled with 11 assists, the Lakers offense and defense sputtered. JJ Redick has been vocal about the team's potential on the defensive end, but the same issues have persisted to see them go 1-3 on the road trip so far.

"Need more pride defensively": JJ Redick calls for Lakers to shore up efforts on defense

The Lakers defense has taken a hit this season. They have the fourth-worst defensive rating in the league this season at 117.8 and JJ Redick minced no words when he called for LA to make more efforts on that end of the floor. Per ESPN's Dave McMenamin, Redick asked pride from his players when approaching defense.

"We need to start the game with a little more pride defensively."

JJ Redick's schemes have surely resulted in the Lakers being a better offensive unit than they were last season. They were helmed by two defense-first coaches Frank Vogel and Darvin Ham before. With 75 games left in the season, LA will need to work on plans that will help them reduce the damage and the lapses on the defensive end.

With Jarred Vanderbilt still working his way to recovery, the Lakers will depend on the likes of Cam Reddish, Max Christie, and their backup big, Jaxson Hayes to add more teeth on defense. Up next, the Lakers head West to take on the Memphis Grizzlies to end their five-game road trip that's been quite the disappointment so far. They play three games at home soon after.
