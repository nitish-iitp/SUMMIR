To start a home back-to-back, the Golden State Warriors were shorthanded with Steph Curry, Brandin Podziemski and Gary Payton II all sidelined against the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night at Chase Center. Things didn't get any easier for the Warriors when Jonathan Kuminga exited the game with an ankle injury late in the second quarter.

Despite missing multiple key pieces, the Warriors still were able to surge to an impressive shorthanded victory over the Grizzlies, 121-113. Six different members of the Warriors tallied 11 or more points against the Grizzlies, including leading scorer Andrew Wiggins.

After only scoring two points in the first half, Wiggins exploded in the third quarter. Wiggins tallied 18 points in the third quarter on 8-of-7 shooting from the field with three made 3-pointers. Wiggins finished with 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting from the field with three assists and two rebounds in 36 minutes.

Via @warriors on Twitter:

Dennis Schroder notched his highest-scoring performance as a Warrior, scoring 17 points on 6-of-15 shooting from the field to go along with nine assists and three rebounds in 36 minutes.

Riding a two-game winning streak to start 2025, the Warriors will welcome the Sacramento Kings to San Francisco on Sunday evening for the second leg of a back-to-back.
