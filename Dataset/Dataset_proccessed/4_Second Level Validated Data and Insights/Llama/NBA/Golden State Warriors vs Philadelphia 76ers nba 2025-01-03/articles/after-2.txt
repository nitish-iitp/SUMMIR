Steph Curry on Steve Kerr’s trimmed Warriors rotation: ‘Narrowing … (it) helps everybody’
By Anthony Slater

SAN FRANCISCO — With Joel Embiid cleared to play for the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night, it profiled as an obvious game for Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr to adjust to a larger opponent and give Kevon Looney, his trusted veteran big, at least a small stint each half defending Embiid. Kerr said pregame it was an option.

But Looney didn’t enter until mop-up time of the Warriors’ 139-105 blowout win. Had it been more competitive, Looney wouldn’t have played for a third consecutive game, joining Kyle Anderson on the outside of a tightening rotation. Anderson hasn’t seen the floor in five of the Warriors’ past nine games.

This isn’t a performance-based choice from Kerr. Looney has looked rejuvenated this season and been the Warriors’ best big a handful of nights. Anderson has been perfectly capable during his opportunities and gets a spot start every time Draymond Green is unavailable. But the frontcourt picture is packed, and Kerr — after 30-plus games of ever-shuffling, unpredictable, overcrowded groupings — has decided it must be more consistently trimmed.

Looney and Anderson are the odd men out, sacrificing for the better of struggling teammates in need of a better rhythm.

“Narrowing the roles and the rotation helps everybody,” Stephen Curry said. “You start to build a little chemistry.”

Kerr credited the two veterans for their acceptance without rattling the cage. This is Anderson’s first time getting plucked from Kerr’s rotation. This is somewhere around Looney’s 100th time in 10 seasons.

“We’re lucky to have them on our team,” Kerr said. “They’re the most professional guys you could ask for. The only way it works in the NBA is if the guys who aren’t playing are supportive of the other guys and aware of what’s happening and accepting of it.”

There’s no question this shorter, simplified rotation has most helped Jonathan Kuminga. He has never agitated for a guaranteed starting spot but has long desired a more regular featured role, giving him a runway to grow his game and a trust that Kerr and his staff believe in him.

Here are Kuminga’s minute totals off the bench in the past six games: 30, 28, 37, 34, 32, 25. He enters around the six-minute mark of the first and third quarters and basically plays the rest of the half, only resting for brief stretches and almost always closing.

Kuminga has backed up his recent back-to-back 34-point games with a solid 18-point, 10-rebound game against a tough Cleveland Cavaliers frontline and an in-control 20-point, five-assist, five-rebound stat line in the blowout of the Sixers. He made eight of his 11 shots, never forced it and zipped around some of the sharper passes of his career.

“It’s his fifth-straight great game,” Kerr said. “I just think Jonathan is continuing to break through and understand what his role is and what we need from him.”

This comes in the aftermath of Kerr’s most critical assessment of Kuminga’s game. After planting him on the bench in a smaller role, Kuminga floated through a pair of road games in Memphis and Minnesota, didn’t attack the rim much and settled for early clock midrangers. Kerr stung him for his shot selection. His shot diet has been significantly better since, and he’s powering to the line, having shot 14, 12 and 14 free throws in a recent three-game stretch.

“You can just tell he’s getting comfortable,” Green said. “He knows now, ‘Oh, I’m going to get the ball, I’m going to have my opportunities to score. So I don’t have to show you I can score.’ If he passes the ball four possessions in a row, what he’s starting to understand is the fifth possession, ‘I’m still getting the ball back. The ball is coming to me.’ With that, it’s building a sense of purpose for him… It’s raised his comfort level.”

Green reiterated that he thinks Kuminga is “special” and specifically mentioned a playmaking situation against the Sixers where he drew extra attention because of his scoring ability and made a simple read and pass for a Buddy Hield corner 3. Hield is in a deep slump, but this delivered him a wide open corner 3, which he made.

“That’s the type of stuff, when you become a superstar in this league — which I have zero doubts he’s going to become — those are the type of (plays) that’ll make guys want to run through a wall for you,” Green said. “He’s learning that. He’s picking it up. It’s coming together.”

Thursday night was also Dennis Schröder’s best with the Warriors. He made three 3s early, all as part of the Warriors’ 22 makes as a team — a breakout night which included an 8-of-8 performance from Curry.

Schröder has been excellent as an on-ball defensive pest for the Warriors, filling half of De’Anthony Melton’s vacant role, but he’d been in a deep shooting slump as he adjusted to a new environment. Schröder has been in various offensive environments in his career, but the Curry ecosystem requires something different for off-guards next to him.

“Hitting the post, then do split action,” Schröder said. “Slipping out and then the second guy comes off screens. We want to shoot a lot of 3s. This year, I’ve been shooting a lot of 3s. But in my career, I always try to go to the basket. That’s probably the biggest adjustment. Playing fast, too, getting it out the net.”

Schröder was almost always taking the ball up for the Brooklyn Nets to open the season and did it all summer for the German national team. He’d become used to it. On this Warriors team, he’s occasionally bringing it up, but it’s a group effort. The Warriors are telling him not to run back to the basketball. If he doesn’t get the rebound, sprint down the court.

“Draymond pushing it or Kuminga or Steph,” Schröder said. “Running without the ball, running with the ball.”

Green said this tightened rotation is “helping” but warned that it is only one win. The Warriors are 17-16 and still in search of some traction as they get ready to face the Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings and Miami Heat to close out this six-game homestand.

“It’s still tricky,” Kerr said. “We got (Brandin Podziemski) and Gary (Payton II) coming back. We have a really deep roster, a lot of guys who can play. We also talked about our shooting. We need to get more shooting on the floor. Great to see Moses (Moody) knocking down shots.”

When Podziemski returns, he’s expected to step back into a rotation role. That could trim the minutes for Moody or Lindy Waters III. When Payton gets back, it could also have an impact, though he could be used as more of a break-in-case-of-emergency defensive ace because Schröder has emerged into their primary perimeter option on guards.

“I’d love to stick with one rotation,” Kerr said. “But as soon as we’re down 10 in the third quarter and we need somebody, I’m going to put that guy in.”
