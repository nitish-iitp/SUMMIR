Jrue Holiday's Fiery Start Launches Celtics Past Rockets

Since returning from a three-game injury absence last week, Jrue Holiday has been on a tear. The 34-year-old guard seems rejuvenated with a fresh set of legs and has been making an impact all over the floor during Boston’s three-game winning streak.

Such was the case Friday night when he launched out of the gates in Houston, scoring 12 points in the first quarter on 5-of-6 shooting. On the second night of a back-to-back, nonetheless.

Holiday’s hot start on the offensive end and consistent intensity on the defensive end set the tone for a 109-86 win at Toyota Center.

Going up against one of the most aggressive defensive teams in the league, Holiday matched the Rockets’ intensity from the jump.

“They’re physical, they’re aggressive, so you have to respond to that,” Mazzulla said of Houston. “Jrue’s aggressiveness was great. And in order for us to be dynamic, Jrue has to be dynamic and aggressive on the offensive end. So I loved that he came out the way that he did.”

The numbers back up Mazzulla’s words; Boston is 17-2 this season when Holiday scores in double digits and is 46-2 all-time when he scores at least 14 points.

In the last three games since his return, Holiday has scored a total of 39 points while shooting 53.8 percent from the field, 52.9 percent from 3-point range, and 100 percent from the free-throw line. He’s also dished out 15 assists while committing just two turnovers. He’s grabbed eight rebounds to go along with a team-high six steals, and the Celtics have outscored their opponents by 42 points during his 92 minutes of action.

Holiday only needed to play 28 minutes Friday night, due to the blowout nature of the game, but those minutes were packed with hustle plays. 

Mazzulla pointed out how much effort Holiday was giving, running back on defense, and it was one of the main reasons why the Celtics were able to hold Houston’s offense to just 36.4 percent shooting from the floor, including 27.8 percent from deep. Holiday also did his part in disrupting the passing lanes, limiting Houston to just nine assists – the fewest by any NBA team in a game in nearly three years.

Houston was the second Celtics opponent in the last three games to be limited to 86 points or fewer. Boston’s defense had only accomplished that feat once in its previous 223 regular-season matchups dating back to the 2021-22 season.

It also helped on Friday night to get Kristaps Porzingis back in the lineup after missing the previous four-plus games with an ankle injury.

KP finished with 11 points, five rebounds, two assists, and two blocks and did an excellent job clogging the paint during Houston’s 30-point second half. Porzingis’ interior presence played a major role in limiting the Rockets to just 30 points in the paint for the game, which was 21.9 points below their season average.

“I thought his defense in the second half was tremendous,” Mazzulla said. “For his first game back, I thought he was great. He really helped us, especially defensively.”

With Holiday and Porzingis back in the lineup, the only one left to return is Jaylen Brown, who has missed the last two games with a shoulder injury.

The hope is that Boston will be fully healthy by Sunday afternoon when they face their toughest challenge of the season: a road game against the 29-5 Oklahoma City Thunder, winners of 14 straight.
