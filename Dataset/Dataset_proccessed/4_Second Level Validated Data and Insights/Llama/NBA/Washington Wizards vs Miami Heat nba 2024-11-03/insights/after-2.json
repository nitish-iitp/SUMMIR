        "Bam Adebayo went right at No. 2 pick Alex Sarr and didn't slow down from there, scoring 20 points in the first half.",
        "Miami led by as much as 17, the game relatively calm and breezy as their threes fell.",
        "Adebayo just about put Sarr through the rim with a forceful driving dunk.",
        "Miami finished this one out 118-98 to take their record to 3-2."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "It would have been foolish to think Adebayo was ever at risk for going an entire season with a sub-20 percent usage rate, but it was fair to wonder where and when his touches would come due to the sheer number of shot creators on Miami’s roster."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "The follow up to Erik Spoelstra's statement that he was taking responsibility for Adebayo not getting enough offensive touches through the HEAT’s first four games was 13 shots and 20 points all in the first half."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Wizards were shooting zero for the three-point line and showing off all the signs of youth.",
        "Adebayo hit his first three of the season, and his second and third, all wide-open looks against a turned-around defense.",
        "Jimmy Butler’s mid-range jumper has looked good so far, converting all three of his attempts in this one."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Miami’s roster has a sheer number of shot creators, making it fair to wonder where Adebayo’s touches would come from.",
        "Adebayo spent the entire game welcoming Alex Sarr to the league."
