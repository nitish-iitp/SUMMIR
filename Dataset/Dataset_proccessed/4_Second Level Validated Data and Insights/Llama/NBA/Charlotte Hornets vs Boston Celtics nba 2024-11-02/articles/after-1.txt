The Celtics won their second straight game against the Hornets on Saturday night with a comfortable 113-103 win at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte.

Boston led by as many as 21 points in the victory and led by 18 points at halftime after a hot shooting half from Payton Pritchard (22 points off the bench). The Hornets trimmed that Boston lead to three points with a 18-3 run to start the second half but the Celtics regained control down the stretch. The hosts didn’t seriously threaten again, failing to get any closer than six points in the fourth quarter.

Jayson Tatum led the way for Boston with 29 points and 7 rebounds, doing most of his advantage at the free throw line where he went 14-of-17 from the stripe. Pritchard added six 3s off the bench while Luke Kornet (19 points, 6/6 FG), added a big boost in second straight spot start in place of an injured Jaylen Brown (sore hip). LaMelo Ball had a game-high 37 points for the Hornets in the loss.

The Celtics improved to 6-1 with the victory and are now 2-1 on their four-game road trip. They conclude the road swing in Atlanta on Monday night. Charlotte fell to 2-4 under Charles Lee after being swept in the weekend series.

Here are four Celtics takeaways from the win on Saturday night:

Payton Pritchard keeps looking like a 6th man candidate: The reserve point guard gave Boston’s offense another spark with a sidelined Brown, posting 22 points on 50 percent shooting from the field. It was the fifth double-digit scoring game for Pritchard in seven games this year and he’s now averaging 15.7 points per game while knocking down more than four 3s in every game. His 29 total 3s are the second highest total on the Celtics roster.

Luke Kornet posts a perfect shooting line in spot start: Joe Mazzulla opted to go with double bigs in the front court despite Al Horford returning to the lineup in the tail end of the back-to-back. Horford shifted to power forward, opening the door for Kornet to stay at center and feast down low against a undermanned Hornets frontcourt that started Grant Williams at center. Kornet maximized his chances against mismatches all night long with a season-high 19 points on 6-of-6 shooting from the field. He also made a season-high seven free throws and filled the box score with four rebounds, three assists and two blocks in 30 minutes. The consistent production inside was needed on a subpar shooting night for Boston from the perimeter (30 percent).

No more Grant Williams fireworks: The rematch one game after Williams hit Jayson Tatum with a flagrant foul 2 opened the door for a chippy affair. However, there wasn’t much added tension for much of the night in terms of extra physicality. Tatum did manage to make contact with Williams as he hung on the rim following a fourth quarter dunk but nothing came of the interaction. Outside of a mini-tussle between Williams and Derrick White following an inbounds play with under a minute left, cooler heads prevailed. However, Tatum and most other Celtics declined to greet Williams after the victory.

Neemias Queta gets crunch time call: While Kornet delivered a strong performance in his 30 minutes, Mazzulla turned to his reserve center in the final five minutes of the win to help seal the victory over Kornet and Pritchard. Queta played alongside Horford in the closing five and held his own defensively, grabbing a couple tough rebounds and finishing an alley-oop dunk from Jayson Tatum. For now, it appears Queta is the favored option at center ahead of Xavier Tillman (three minutes) in Joe Mazzulla’s depth chart and he has put together an impressive three-game stretch on this road trip.
