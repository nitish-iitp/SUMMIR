The Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic reportedly had a heated argument showing that he was clearly upset in the high-octane thriller against The Phoenix Sun.

It was not the best time for the 25-year-old, after setting up a crafty lob for Gafford to tie the game, Doncic briefly grabbed his right ankle and he was seen limping before heading to the bench during the timeout. It seemed that Suns’ Jusuf Nurkic had accidentally clipped his ankle while trying to block the pass.


In the game, The Suns built an early 36-26 lead in the first quarter, sinking eight three-pointers, including two from center Jusuf Nurkic. Tyus Jones led all scorers with eight points in the opening minutes. Phoenix kept their lead steady as they went into halftime with 63-50 after shooting 53.5% from the field. Doncic scored a game-high 16 by halftime.

Dallas came back in the third, tying the game at 65-65 at one point. However, the Suns rose in the game with an 87-83 score going into the fourth round. The Mavericks pulled ahead by six points before the Suns regained a slim 98-97 lead.
Later, Nurkic tied it at 111 when there was just a minute left. Durant missed a three-pointer but Nurkic's rebound and slam put Phoenix up by two with 30 seconds remaining.
The final moment of the game was quite intense as a Dallas alley-oop tied the game, however, a foul on Nurkic in the last seconds sent him to the line. He made the second throw after missing the first free throw which secured a one-point win for Phoenix as Doncic's last-second shot fell short.
As for Doncic’s argument, there have not been any official reactions or any response from the 25-year-old as of writing the piece.
