PHILADELPHIA 76ERS
Paul George Says He's 'Bored' Playing Small-Ball Center for 76ers amid Embiid Injury

Philadelphia 76ers star Paul George suggested Friday that he isn't a fan of being utilized as a center as part of a small-ball lineup.

Speaking to reporters after the Sixers' 123-115 home loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, George said, "To be honest, I'm bored," when asked about his feelings on playing the five:

There's no way Paul George actually said "I'm bored" during a press conference 😭😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/q74YV3heH9">pic.twitter.com/q74YV3heH9</a>

Superstar center Joel Embiid has missed the past three games with a foot injury and 23 games overall this season, forcing head coach Nick Nurse to get creative with his lineup.

Regarding his current role, George added: "It's different. I'm used to scrapping and running around and chasing and fighting through screens. ... But being mindful of my ability to clog the middle and kind of help and cut off passing lanes and driving lanes and kind of battle with the bigs is what Nick sees in that style."

George also said guarding centers "don't do enough for me," noting that he "enjoys" matchups with wing players.

The 34-year-old George has been a wing player for the vast majority of his 15-year career, and he has thrived in that role, earning nine All-Star nods and four NBA All-Defensive Team selections.

However, George is also a versatile player, and with Embiid and backup center Andre Drummond both missing the past three games, Nurse has called upon George to showcase that versatility.

After spending five seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers, George signed with the Sixers this past offseason in hopes of forming a Big 3 with Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.

Things have not gone according to plan, though, as all three stars have missed time due to injury.

George, who has sat out 11 games this season, is also having a down year statistically with 16.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 2.3 three-pointers made and 1.8 steals per contest, while shooting just 41.7 percent from the field and 34.1 percent from deep.

It marks George's lowest scoring average in a season since 2011-12 when taking out the 2014-15 campaign in which he only appeared in six games.

George has also been far less efficient this season compared to last season when he shot a career-best 47.1 percent from the floor and 41.3 percent from long range.

It has been a struggle of a season for the Sixers as a whole, as their 15-21 record has them 11th in the Eastern Conference.

The 76ers were widely expected to be among the top teams in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, but that simply hasn't been the case.

Philly may be able to work its way back to respectability if Embiid can get healthy and perform at his usual elite level, but there has been no indication that it will happen.

Embiid's injury woes have severely limited what the Sixers are able to do, and George's comments suggest that he isn't particularly comfortable with having to fill-in for Embiid during his absence.

Despite that, the 76ers will attempt to get back on track Sunday when they go on the road to face the Orlando Magic.
