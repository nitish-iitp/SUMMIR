Wednesday was a heartbreaking, tragic day for the city of New Orleans after a terrorist attack occurred in the French Quarter, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 people. The Pelicans and Saints released a statement on the tragedy.

The Pelicans were in Miami on Wednesday to open 2025 with a road game against the Heat. The hosts registered a 119-108 victory.

Watch postgame video reaction from Willie Green and Trey Murphy (34 points). Murphy scored 25 of his team's 51 first-half points in Miami.

Check out action photos from Pels-Heat.

New Orleans (5-29) will play its next two games vs. Washington, beginning with a Friday home game at 7 p.m. Tickets are available here.
