Matas Buzelis Stats Tonight: How did Bulls rookie fare in matchup against Anthony Edwards and Co.? (Nov. 7)

Matas Buzelis was yet to be among the points when the Chicago Bulls hosted the Minnesota Timberwolves at the United Center on Thursday (Nov. 7). At the time of writing, the Bulls rookie came off the bench and had played 6:24 minutes as Chicago held a slender 45-39 lead over the T-Wolves.

The No. 11 pick of the 2024 NBA draft recorded no rebounds or assists but recorded one steal and one block. He shot 0-1 from the field and 0-1 from beyond the arc. Nikola Vucevic and Coby White led the side with nine points each.
