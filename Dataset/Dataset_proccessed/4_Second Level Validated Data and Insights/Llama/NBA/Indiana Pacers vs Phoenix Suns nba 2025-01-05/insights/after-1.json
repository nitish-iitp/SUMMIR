        "The Suns are currently 15-18 on the season, a concerning start to the season. They are set to play several lower-tier Eastern Conference squads over the next three weeks, which could be an opportunity for them to turn their season around."

        "The Suns' fortunes in 2023-24 improved vastly as the season progressed, ultimately finishing 49-33 and securing the number 6 seed in the West. They would need to go 34-15 the rest of the way to match that win total."
