CHICAGO, IL - JANUARY 10: Zach LaVine #8 of the Chicago Bulls shoots a 3-point basket over Bilal ... [+]

ICON SPORTSWIRE VIA GETTY IMAGES

Over the past 15 or so months, the NBA world has been busy rejecting Zach LaVine as a genuine asset, often labeling his contract as being a net negative, and his game unreliable.

While his contract ($43 million this year, and roughly $95 million left on his deal following this season), can argued as being rich, it's difficult to find merit in his game being unreliable.

Elite efficiency

Outside of last season, when LaVine was limited to 25 games played, and was injured in most of them, the now 29-year-old has been a pillar of consistency and efficiency.

Since breaking out as an All-Star in the 2020/2021 season, LaVine has had a true-shooting percentage of 61.5%, including a career-high 64.4% this season. That's an elite number for a player who is predominantly perimeter-oriented.

PROMOTED

LaVine also differs from other players in that he isn't just a spot-up three-point shooter, who gets his efficiency going from behind the arc. He's always been a pure scorer, as evident by his 24.1 points per game as a Bull over the past eight seasons.

Getting the volume back

Over LaVine's past seven games, he's returned to All-Star form.

30.9 points, 5.0 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and he's connected on 57.6% of all of his shots, including 47.8% from downtown. He's scored 30+ points in six of those seven games.

The Bulls may not be good enough to justify a slot for him for All-Star festivities, but that shouldn't diminish his accomplishments.

If anything, LaVine has been almost too modest for Chicago this season, often taking a step back to allow others, such as Nikola Vučević and Coby White, to get up shots.

Ignoring last season, due to the aforementioned injury issues, LaVine's 16.6 shot attempts per night this season ranks as the second-lowest output for him during his Bulls career.

As such, one of the most crucial numbers for LaVine's past six games might be his shot volume, which sits at 20.6 attempts per night, which is the type of volume the Bulls need.

Future unclear

LaVine has been in trade rumors for years now, and despite the fact that his contract might be a little steep, now is the time for a contender to latch on, and make a play for him.

He's in his prime, he's never been more efficient, and he's fully capable of moving without the ball. His 44.4% accuracy from downtown on the season marks a career-high,

That number becomes even more impressive when you look at the breakdown of his three-point shots.

Entering the game against Washington on Friday, LaVine was drilling a ridiculously efficient 45.2% of his pull-up three-pointers, which accounts for 4.2 of his nightly attempts. He's flanking that with 43.6% as a spot-up shooter, accounting for 2.9 attempts.

Those are not just elite percentage breakdowns. Those are within Stephen Curry territory.

The Bulls, who have historically been awful trade negotiators, aren't likely to ask for a lot for LaVine, making a trade attempt by, for example, the Denver Nuggets, fairly realistic if they wish to go in that direction.

Whether LaVine stays or goes, his play this season has - once again - proved that he's one of the most reliable, and dynamic, offensive weapons in the NBA.
