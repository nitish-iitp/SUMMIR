        "Zach LaVine has been almost too modest for Chicago this season, often taking a step back to allow others, such as Nikola Vučević and Coby White, to get up shots."

    "Others": [
        "LaVine has been in trade rumors for years now, and despite the fact that his contract might be a little steep, now is the time for a contender to latch on, and make a play for him.",
        "The Bulls, who have historically been awful trade negotiators, aren't likely to ask for a lot for LaVine, making a trade attempt by, for example, the Denver Nuggets, fairly realistic if they wish to go in that direction."
