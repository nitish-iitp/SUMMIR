Golden State Warriors vs Portland Trail Blazers game recap

The Trail Blazers were off to a hot start before the Warriors caught up after a flurry of buckets from Steph Curry, Buddy Hield and Gary Payton II saw them end the first quarter 21-21. The Blazers had center Deandre Ayton and Anfernee Simons pushing up the scores even as they kept up with Golden State's pace and matched them shot-to-shot in the first half.

The second quarter saw the Golden State Warriors hit their stride to lead the Blazers 44-37 with four minutes left in the half. Curry finished his quarter with eight points, while Hield had 14 points. Ayton and Grant led the way for the hosts with 10 and eight points respectively. The teams went into halftime with Golden State leading 62-50 leading by 12 points.

The second half was all Golden State as their offense churned with their new acquisitions getting into their groove early on. Hield ended his evening with xx points and Wiggins, after missing a major chunk of the preseason games with an illness returned to the lineup to drop 20 points.

For the Blazers, Henderson had 22 points off the bench coupled with four rebounds and as many assists. Simmons and Avdija propped up 15 points each, and Grant ended with 16 points. Center Ayton had a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds.

The lack of floor balance and communication played a key role in Portland's loss. The visitors though will be pleased to have nailed most of their game plans early on in the season.
