Andrew Wiggins Scores 29 Points in Warriors' Home Opening Loss to Clippers

Andrew Wiggins scored a game-high 29 points and made a game-best five 3-pointers in the Warriors' 112-104 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers at Chase Center on Sunday. The Warriors lost Stephen Curry to an ankle injury in the fourth quarter but, led by Wiggins, cut the deficit to as few as one point before they were ultimately defeated. The Clippers had a 20-point advantage in paint points (58-38).

WIGGINS' EFFICIENT NIGHT
Wiggins scored at least nine points in three different quarters, including shooting a perfect 4-for-4 in the third quarter and his highest-scoring 11-point fourth quarter on 4-for-5 shooting. His 29 points and five 3-pointers were an early season high, as he shot 11-for-15 from the field and 5-for-8 from three. Wiggins was also tasked with being the primary defender on the Clippers' go-to offensive player, James Harden. Harden shot just 6-for-19 from the field but recorded a double-double with 23 points and 11 assists.

BUDDY'S FOUR-POINT PLAY
The Clippers went on an 11-0 run in the second quarter before the Warriors' newfound offensive ignitor, Buddy Hield, helped them battle back. Hield hit a baseline jumper for his first home basket at Chase Center. Then, from the other side of the court, he sank a deep three despite being fouled and falling into the front row of Dub Nation fans. After converting the 4-point play, Hield used his dribble penetration to find Trayce Jackson-Davis for an alley-oop slam, capping an 8-0 Warriors run to cut the deficit to just one point (43-42).

LOONEY'S DOUBLE-DOUBLE
Kevon Looney recorded a double-double off the bench with 10 points and 11 rebounds in 20 minutes. Looney was active around the rim on both ends of the floor, with five of his boards coming on the offensive glass. Looney was rewarded for his impactful play, finishing the game in the closing lineup. 

CURRY ANKLE INJURY
Stephen Curry hurt his left ankle late in the third quarter of Sunday's contest and re-injured the same ankle early in the fourth quarter, forcing him to be sidelined for the remainder of the game.
