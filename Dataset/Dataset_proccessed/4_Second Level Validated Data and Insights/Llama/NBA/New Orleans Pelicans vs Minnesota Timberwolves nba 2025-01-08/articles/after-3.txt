5 things to know about the Pelicans on Jan. 8, 2025

Zion Williamson did not look like a player who had been sidelined for two months Tuesday, especially when he threw down a 360-degree windmill dunk. Williamson scored 22 points in 28 minutes against Minnesota. Watch highlights from the two-time All-Star.

The Timberwolves held on late for a 104-97 victory over the Pelicans in the first game of a home back-to-back for New Orleans (7-30).

Watch postgame video reaction from Williamson, Dejounte Murray (team-best 29 points) and Willie Green.

The Pelicans are back on the Smoothie King Center floor Wednesday, hosting Portland (12-23) at 7 p.m. Tickets are available here. Based on NBA rules, New Orleans will submit their injury report by 1 p.m. this afternoon, which will finalize the status of Williamson for the second game of a back-to-back. Green did not indicate last night whether Williamson would be available to play vs. the Trail Blazers.

On Western Conference Wednesday, the team to watch over the next seven days is Utah (9-26), the team just ahead of New Orleans in the standings. The Jazz have upcoming home games vs. Miami and Brooklyn, with a road trip to Phoenix in between (they also visit New Orleans for two games later in January). Stock up: Sacramento, winners of five straight games under interim head coach Doug Christie, and now only a half-game out of a play-in spot. Stock down: Golden State, which started the season 12-3 but has gone just 6-15 since, hanging on to that No. 10 spot a sliver ahead of the Kings.
