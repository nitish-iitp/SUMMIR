LOS ANGELES (AP) — Anthony Davis scored 35 points, Austin Reaves added 26 and the Los Angeles Lakers rallied to beat the Phoenix Suns 123-116 on Friday night for their first 2-0 start since 2010-11.

LeBron James had 17 of his 21 points in the second half for the Lakers, who trailed by 22 points in the second quarter.

Kevin Durant led Phoenix (1-1) with 30 points. Devin Booker had 23.

The Lakers were down 61-52 at halftime, then outscored Phoenix 35-24 in the third quarter to take the lead as Davis and James each scored 11 in the period.

Los Angeles led by 12 points in the fourth quarter.

Takeaways

Suns: Made 21 of their first 30 shots, including nine straight 3-pointers, before going 21 of 52 the rest of the game. Phoenix was 24 of 39 from the field in the first half, but 9 of 27 in the third quarter. The Suns led 38-23 after the first quarter.

Lakers: JJ Reddick is the first Los Angeles coach to win his first two games since Phil Jackson in 1999.

Key moment

The Lakers trailed 81-74 with three minutes left in the third quarter before scoring nine straight points to grab the lead. That was part of a 20-6 run during a nearly five-minute span from late in the third to early in the fourth.

Key stat

The Lakers were 14 of 27 on 3-pointers. Reaves was 5 of 7 from beyond the arc while James, Dalton Knecht and Rui Hachimura made two apiece.
