Lillard also dished out seven assists while Antetokounmpo hauled in a game-high 16 rebounds for Milwaukee, which snapped a six-game skid. Bobby Portis netted 19 points in a reserve role for the Bucks.

Milwaukee settled for a 31-29 lead at the end of the first quarter after Clarkson scored six points in the final 33.6 seconds of the frame.

Clarkson then fed Collins for a dunk early in the second quarter, with Collins getting fouled on the play and sinking the ensuing free throw. That ignited an 11-0 run, putting the Jazz up 45-35 with 8:06 to go in the first half.

Back-to-back triples from AJ Green later helped the Bucks build a three-point cushion, but Utah ultimately went into the break ahead 61-57.
