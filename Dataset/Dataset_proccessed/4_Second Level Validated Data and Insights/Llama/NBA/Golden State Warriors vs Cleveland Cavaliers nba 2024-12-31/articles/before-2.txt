Sorry ya'll, massive card today. Seeing a lot of value on the board and a nice slate. I'm a little surprised we are getting this low of a line. The Cavs continue to be disrespected as the holder of the best record in the league. They have been good on both sides of the court this season. Firstly, this team beat this GS team 136 to 117 in their last meeting.

Golden State is built on defense. They are only scoring the 16th most points per game, but are allowing the 10th fewest. Meanwhile, the Cavs are allowing the 12th fewest points per game, but scoring the 2nd most per game (122.7). However, GS has been cold of late, dropping 7 of their last 10 games (shooting 42.7%), while CLE continues to roll, winning 9 of their last 10 (shooting 49.7%).

This Cavs team can score in a multitude of ways - on the midrange and outside with Mitchell and Garland, and provide a great offensive and defensive presence on the inside with Mobley and Allen. This Cavs team is fully healthy and I think they get the job done against a struggling GS team.
