        "The Cavs remain the only undefeated team in the league after the Nuggets have beaten OKC Thunder a couple of nights ago.",
        "GSW have also been great, losing just one game so far.",
        "The Cavs have a much better starting lineup and that usually makes a difference, so with them also playing at home, the Cavs to win by five or more points is my first Cavs vs Warriors prediction.",
        "The Warriors are deep and their bench has been great, contributing as many points as their starting five so far.",
        "The Cavs and the Warriors are two of the three best offensive teams, at least if we look at points per game.",
        "Cleveland are at the top with 123.2 points per game, while the Warriors are averaging 121.1 points per game."

        "This season so far tells a different story since the Cavs and the Warriors are two of the three best offensive teams, at least if we look at points per game.",
        "Jarret Allen has been in great form this season, averaging 15.1 points per game and 11.9 rebounds per game.",
        "Allen failed to notch 26 points + rebounds in just two of the nine games he played in so far.",
        "Against the Warriors, who often play small-ball without an imposing presence under the basket, Allen should have a good opportunity to do this once again."
