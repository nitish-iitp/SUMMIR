The Minnesota Timberwolves and the LA Lakers opened their preseason campaigns against each other at the Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert, CA. Superstars like LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle were unavailable, but a packed venue greeted the teams. After the long offseason, basketball fans were excited to see the NBA return.

The Timberwolves' size advantage and better execution on both ends of the floor pushed them to a 124-107 win. Chris Finch's veterans, particularly in the first three quarters, carried the team. Finch also got superb contributions from rookies Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr.

The much-awaited debut of Bronny James happened in the second quarter. He had a so-so performance but competed during his six-minute stint in the said period. Dalton Knecht showed why he was a first-round pick in this year's draft.

Minnesota Timberwolves vs LA Lakers: Game Summary

Minnesota had a fast start behind Mike Conley, but careless turnovers slowed the Timberwolves down. Chris Finch kept his starters in for almost the entire first quarter, giving Donte DiVincenzo an extended run with his old reliables.

The former New York Knicks guard responded with 11 points on 4-for-4 shooting, including 3-for-3 from deep. Conley and Naz Reid combined for 10 points, three rebounds and two assists to help Minnesota take a 36-23 lead after the first quarter.

Meanwhile, new Lakers coach JJ Redick used the bench before the halfway point of the first period. Max Christie had a strong start, leading the team with seven points before he was substituted. Austin Reaves went 0-for-5, but hit two free throws.

LA Lakers fans finally got what they wanted when Redick started Bronny James in the second quarter. He promptly recorded a block but also airballed a shot. LA's other rookie Dalton Knecht had six points on 3-for-5 shooting, but missed both his 3-point attempts.

Minnesota's second-stringers, composed mainly of veterans, kept the Lakers in check. Rookie Rob Dillingham also showed up, scattering seven points to help the Timberwolves take a 58-49 lead.
