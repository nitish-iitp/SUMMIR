Timberwolves: Minnesota led from the middle of the first quarter and by 24 at one point. They broke a seven-game losing streak against Eastern Conference opponents.

Magic: The lack of scoring punch continues to be a problem for the Magic, which shot 38% and is now the lowest-scoring team in the NBA at 104.8 points per game. It may have been the last of 34 games without Paolo Banchero. The 22-year-old power forward, out since October with a torn right oblique, is expected to return Friday night.

Key moment

Edwards launched himself over the Magic's Anthony Black for a dunk, then came down with a glare at the crowd to give the Wolves a 10-point lead with 3:19 left in the third quarter. They led by double figures for the rest of the game.
