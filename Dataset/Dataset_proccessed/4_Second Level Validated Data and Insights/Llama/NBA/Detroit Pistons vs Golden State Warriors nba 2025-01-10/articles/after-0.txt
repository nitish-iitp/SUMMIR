The Golden State Warriors got back to winning ways with a 107-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, Jan. 9. Four of Steve Kerr's starting five finished the game with double-digit scoring performances, including an impressive 14-point, 10-rebound double-double from sophomore big man Trayce Jackson-Davis.

However, it was the performance of Gui Santos that caught the eye. The Warriors 22-year-old came off the bench to lead the second unit in scoring with 13 points. The sophomore also pulled down five rebounds, dished out three assists and recorded two steals. Santos hit four of his six shot attempts, with all of them coming from 3-point range. He went 1-of-2 from the free-throw line.

Shortly after the Warriors win, their social media team released a highlights package of Santos' performance on their YouTube channel. Santos is rarely featured within Kerr's rotation, so the boost he provided from the bench was undoubtedly a welcome one.

You can watch the full highlights by clicking on the embedded video above.
