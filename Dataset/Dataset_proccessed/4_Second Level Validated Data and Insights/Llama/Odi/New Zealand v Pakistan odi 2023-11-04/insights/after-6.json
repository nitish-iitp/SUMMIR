    "Post-Match Reflections": [

        "Pakistan were found to be three overs short at the cut-off time and, as a result, they had to have one less fielder outside the inner ring for the last three overs of the innings that went for 35, the rain interrupted play, reducing the game to 25.3 overs per side, Pakistan were comfortably ahead of the rate they needed to be when the rain arrived"
