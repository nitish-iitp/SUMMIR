        "England and the Netherlands have defied pre-ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 expectations with them, albeit in drastically different manners.",
        "England, reigning world champions, have sunk lower than any could have imagined, given their status in world cricket and the combined talent in their squad; the Three Lions have won one of their seven games, losing six, and are dead last in the table with two games to go.",
        "Netherlands, on the other hand, have risen above the paltry presumptions experts and perhaps even their own fans levied on them. The Dutch have won two games, including one against the mighty South Africa, and are a place above England in the table, still with a chance to make it to the knockouts."
