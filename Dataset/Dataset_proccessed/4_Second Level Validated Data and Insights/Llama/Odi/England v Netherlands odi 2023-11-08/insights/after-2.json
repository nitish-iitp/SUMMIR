    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The pitch was a goodun, he reckons, and just back of a length the bounce was tennis-ball – helpful for leg-side swats – and he used the scoreboard as his friend, looking up at it if ever he felt under pressure to remind himself that there were more balls remaining than he though.",
        "Ben Stokes praises Woakes’ all-round ability and recent record then, asked if he thought about going home, responds as you expect: “Never leave anyone hanging”."

    "Others": [
        "The required rate is now 9.50.",
        "It feels like we know what’s going to happen here: Netherlands will find a few decent hits, but will also keep losing wickets before any partnership can seriously threaten even the prospect of a prospect of victory."
