The long wait is finally over as cricket’s biggest carnival is here as defending champions England lock horns with their newest rivals and the runners-up from the last edition, New Zealand in the opening fixture of the 13th edition of the World Cup. The mouth-watering encounter is all set to kick off this mega and ultimate tournament on Thursday, October 5, 2023, at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium, in Ahmedabad. 

The memories of the 2019 WC final are still alive among cricketing fans across the globe with England defeating the BlackCaps on boundary count after both the original match and the Super Over ended up with a tie. The unfortunate Kiwis lost the summit clash at the home of cricket, Lord’s, by the barest of margins as Martin Guptill failed to complete the required second run against seamer Jofra Archer in the Super Over.

Notably, the New Zealanders lost their second straight final after also finishing as runners-up in the 2015 edition under the stewardship of Brendon McCullum. They have suffered two heartbreaks in the last two campaigns as they now look to finally cross the final hurdle and end their trophy drought. The Kiwis will be without their regular skipper Kane Williamson for the tournament opener with Tom Latham donning the captaincy hat. For England, Ben Stokes, the hero of the last WC final, is a doubt as he is suffering from a niggle. Both sides are all set to start the competition with a bang with a total of 48 matches, including the two semi-finals and the final are scheduled to be staged across ten different venues in India. The summit clash of the showpiece event will be played on Sunday, November 19, in Ahmedabad. The exciting fans are all in readiness for cricket’s biggest party for the next one and a half months.
