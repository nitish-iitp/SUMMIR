Weather Report for August 2




Pitch Report




Analysis

India starts the ODI series as a heavy favourite with a star-studded squad against Sri Lanka. The Indian batting boasts some world-class players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubhman Gill and others who have been in incredible form in the 50-over format. On the bowling front, Mohammed Siraj will spearhead the attack alongside Kuldeep Yadav, who could dominate in the Lankan spin-friendly conditions.

Talking about the hosts, Sri Lanka had a dismal performance in the T20I series with their batting failing to hold its own in each fixture. Coming into the ODIs, the Lankan batting will be in for a tough challenge and the likes of Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama and Charith Asalanka will be crucial for the team’s chances. Looking at the Lankan bowling, Maheesh Theekshana and Matheesha Pathirana will be the biggest threats for India while Dunith Wellalage will look to repeat his heroics from the Asia Cup 2023 against the Men in Blue.
