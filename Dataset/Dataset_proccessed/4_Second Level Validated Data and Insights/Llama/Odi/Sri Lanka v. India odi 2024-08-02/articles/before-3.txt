SLvIND preview: The ODIs are here, and so is our Mumbaicha Raja, Rohit Sharma!
By Mumbai Indians | 01 AUG, 2024

T20I series under Captain SKY - clean-swept 3-0. It’s over to Captain RO..

Fasten your seatbelts! Rohit Sharma is back to entertain us once again with his big sixes and classy fours as the action shifts to R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the venue for the three ODIs starting on Friday, August 2.

After lighting up millions of faces all over the world with the T20 World Cup win in Barbados, the Hitman will be at the helm of the Indian team to thrill the fans again. Virat Kohli is also back as the RO-KO pair is ready to weave their magic.

Returning to the ODI fold after leading India to the final of an excellent ODI World Cup campaign in 2023, the Hitman will look to continue with his audacious stroke play and no-holds-barred approach with the bat. Come Friday, it will be box office!

Dilshan Madushanka, the Mumbai Indians’ pacer who missed IPL 2024 with an injury, will look to continue his purple patch from the ODI World Cup where he picked up 21 wickets from nine matches. Interesting fact! His best figures of 5/80 in the event came against India.

What: Sri Lanka vs India ODI series

When: Friday, August 2 to Wednesday, August 7, 2024

Where: R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo

What to look forward to: The HITMAN joins hands with Gautam Gambhir for the first time as the duo hits the drawing board to build a team for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025. The team is a perfect mix of youth and experience, and we cannot wait to see the Men in Blue bring home another piece of silverware!
