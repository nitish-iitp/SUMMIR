Weather Report

A temperature of around 32°C and humid afternoon and night is forecast.

IND vs AUS Dream11 Prediction: Probable Playing XIs

India: Rohit Sharma (c), Ishan Kishan, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj.

Australia: David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Alex Carey (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Adam Zampa.

IND vs AUS Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

Rohit Sharma: Rohit Sharma has a terrific record against Australia, and his record in the World Cup is even better. The Indian skipper has also been in good touch lately. Hence, he can be a fine captaincy choice for this encounter.

Hardik Pandya: Hardik Pandya also performs well against Australia, and his record, with both bat and ball, is pretty good in Chennai as well. Pandya will contribute to all the departments, making him a top captaincy pick.

Glenn Maxwell: Glenn Maxwell’s value will increase significantly on the slow track in Chennai. Maxwell is a fine player of spin, and he can also be a more than handy bowler on sluggish tracks. Maxwell’s World Cup record is also top-notch.

IND vs AUS Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Ravichandran Ashwin: Ravichandran Ashwin has surprisingly been picked up by less than 14% of users as of now, making him a good differential pick. Ashwin knows this ground inside out, and the pitch will also assist his craft. Hence, Ashwin can be a game-changer in the fantasy teams.

Josh Hazlewood: Josh Hazlewood has been selected by less than 14% of people as of now. Hazlewood has a good record against Virat Kohli, and if the pitch is on the slower side, he can use his cutters into the pitch to agitate the Indian batters.

IND vs AUS Dream11 Prediction: Players to Avoid

Pat Cummins: Pat Cummins has blown hot and cold in this format and can be avoided for this game.

IND vs AUS Dream11 Prediction: Mega League Base Team

If IND bat first:

Complete the team with three among Ishan Kishan, Marnus Labuschagne, Jasprit Bumrah and Mitchell Starc.

If AUS bat first:

Complete the team with three among Alex Carey, David Warner, Ravichandran Ashwin and Josh Hazlewood.

IND vs AUS Dream11 Prediction: Small League Base Team

If IND bat first:

Complete the team with three among Ishan Kishan, Marnus Labuschagne, Ravindra Jadeja and Mitchell Starc.

If AUS bat first:

Complete the team with three among Mitchell Marsh, Shreyas Iyer, Kuldeep Yadav and Adam Zampa.

IND vs AUS Dream11 Prediction

Both teams have a good squad. However, India have better players of spin and might win the game.
