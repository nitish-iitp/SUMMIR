Venue Details
Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Kandy
It's a dry pitch. There are cracks visible and there hardly a blade of grass. But, I don't think it will crumble to be honest. For the batters, it will be about milking the spinners. There should be slow turn up front. Don't think that it's a bad toss to lose either!
