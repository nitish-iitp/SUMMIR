    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "England need to make a noise, but Bangladesh can be loud too",
        "The Dharamsala outfield has dominated talk in the build-up, but the teams have to get past it once they get down to business",
        "England's chastened cricketers head for the tournament's highest peak in Dharamsala, they do so with clear reason to doubt their readiness to scale the heights",
        "Bangladesh can hardly claim the foothills of the Himalayas as 'home' conditions, but their perfunctory dispatching of Afghanistan at this same venue on Saturday was a satisfactory means of establishing their own credentials",
        "England's batting has failed to fulfil its side of the bargain, and ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball data showed that the most attacking line-up in ODI history had attacked a mere 17% of its deliveries across their flatlining innings"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Jos Buttler exhorts his men to be 'braver' in their play against the ever-dangerous Bangladesh",
        "England's World Cup memories from Chittagong in 2011 and, famously, Adelaide in 2015 - two previous occasions when Bangladesh bested their confused campaigners - ought to have put their game-brains on red alert",
        "Moeen Ali, Joe Root and Chris Woakes complete the role of veterans, all of whom will doubtless have their own takeaways from a deeply ignominious occasion"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The combination of tight dimensions and high altitude should invite England's heavy artillery to unleash their full might",
        "However, as Shakib and Mehidy Hasan Miraz showed in sharing six wickets between them against Afghanistan, Bangladesh's spinners have already made themselves at home on this ground",
        "The sand-based outfield that drew such a scathing critique from Jonathan Trott, Afghanistan's head coach, offers a further potential impediment to England's hopes of all-out aggression"
