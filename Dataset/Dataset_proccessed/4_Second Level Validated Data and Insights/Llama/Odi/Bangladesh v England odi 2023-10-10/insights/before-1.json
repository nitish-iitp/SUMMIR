        "England require a win against Bangladesh to get their World Cup campaign up-and-running after suffering a surprise opening round thrashing at the hands of New Zealand.",
        "It's not quite must-win for England. But it's close. Their nine-wicket loss to the Black Caps was as convincing a defeat as they have suffered in recent memory and has turned the match against Bangladesh from one that should have been a routine win, into an out-and-out banana skin.",
        "Bangladesh started their campaign with a tidy win over Afghanistan and will by no means be a pushover, but the match being held in the stunning Dharmasala, where spin plays much less of a role, will favour England's arsenal of quick bowlers.",
        "For that reason, England may leave out the spin of Moeen Ali and pick one of Gus Atkinson, David Willey or Reece Topley as an extra seamer."
