    "Pre-Game Insights": [

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Jos Buttler’s verdict: It was a really good performance to bounce back from a disappointing first game.",
        "The Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan speaks: It was a good toss to win and there was some help for the bowlers. We didn’t start well enough and if you give them a sniff, they will always come hard at you. They never looked back. We came back strongly in their last 10 overs but it was too late. And when you lose three early wickets, you’re not going to chase 365.",
        "Dawid Malan: It’s been a long journey to get to this stage, so to get here is fantastic and to help win a game is great as well. I don’t know what it’s down to, maybe experience, but I hope it can continue."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The match ends in unusual style, with Taskin bowled twice in as many balls by Sam Curran.",
        "Sri Lanka finished on 344 for nine v Pakistan. Kusal Mendis’s barnstorming 122 from 77 balls was followed by an 89-ball 108 from Sadeera Samarawickrama.",
        "England’s run-rate is back to black, +0.55.",
        "Mark Wood ends a fine evening’s work, in which the only deliveries below 90mph were deliberate slower balls, with splendid figures of 10-1-29-1."
