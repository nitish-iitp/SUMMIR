    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Kusal Mendis: We have three injuries. We have to do well in both batting and bowling, hope we do in today’s game. We have positive things in the previous matches, we have batted really well. And the bowling unit has to bowl in partnerships. I am enjoying my own game, enjoying the captaincy.",
        "Scott Edwards: We are going to have a bat first. The pitch looks pretty good, hopefully put a score on and look to defend it. We played reasonably well the other night, still have some improvements to make. Every team that is here would be saying the same thing, you have to probably win 5 games and that’s what we are here to do. We have got some quality spinners and quicks as well, we just come into the game, make some plans and go from there."
