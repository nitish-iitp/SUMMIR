        "Netherlands are catching up with Sri Lanka after a lopsided history",
        "Sri Lanka's bowling unit hasn't had much to crow about lately, but in Dilshan Madushanka they have a genuine star on their hands",
        "Netherlands are a side that pride themselves on overcoming any talent or experience deficits through a laser-eyed focus on the aspects of the game within their control",
        "While Sri Lanka will still head into this game as nominal favourites - due to all the usual factors such as player ceilings and big-game experience - the margins between these sides are now arguably as fine as they have ever been"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Lucknow surface in the matches played there so far this tournament has shown a propensity for some uneven bounce, rewarding bowlers that stick to a good length or just short of one",
        "Spinners too have found some assistance. But this one is expected to have a touch more grass on it and will perhaps offer a little more to the seamers",
        "Sri Lanka haven't lost the opening three games of a World Cup since 1987, when they lost all six of their matches"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Bas de Leede has seven wickets in the competition so far. Four more will see him equal the most for Netherlands in a World Cup, a record currently held by his father, Tim de Leede"
