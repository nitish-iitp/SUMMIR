    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Rohit Sharma: Since we started the tournament it was all about one game at a time. We never wanted to look too far ahead. It is a long tournament, eleven games in all if we go all the way.",
        "Netherlands captain, Scott Edwards: It’s a little bit of a tricky one at the moment when it comes to where we want to be. We are pretty confident with the style we play, the tournament was always going to be tough… India are as good a side going around."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Shreyas Iyer: I’m very happy. The scores I got in the last few days helped me. The wicket was playing tacky, a bit two paced. I wanted to capitalise on the start… I was trying to hit straight, and keep my head down.",
        "Rohit Sharma gives himself a bowl with a wide grin spreading across his chops. He trundles in and is hammered away over midwicket by Nidamanaru, that brings up his fifty off just 38 balls."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "India's formidable tournament continues with nine wins from nine as they head into a home World Cup semi final against New Zealand on Wednesday.",
        "Netherlands need investment of course, resources, fixtures and the rest, but they have plenty of talent and are a young side in terms of age."
