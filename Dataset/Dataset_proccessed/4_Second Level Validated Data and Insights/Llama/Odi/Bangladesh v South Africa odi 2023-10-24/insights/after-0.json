        "South Africa have written up another script with the same alphabet and it's called 'carnage'. The way they are hammering centuries, breaching the 300 and 350-mark in ODIs, demolishing bowling attacks of all kinds across conditions says something about this team and today it was Bangladesh at the receiving end.",
        "They were 238 for 3 after 40 overs and the way they have belligerently smacked the bowlers around in the last 10 for the second time in a row says a lot more. It was 143 in the last 10 against England and today it's another 144! If you combine the two? As many as 287 runs in the last 20 overs combined of their last two games."

As a precautionary measure, he is also ruled out of today’s match against Bangladesh. Aiden Markram will captain the side.

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Kolkata pitch is such that it could favour the Netherlands quicks, like it happened in Dharamsala.",
        "Four losses in a row for Bangladesh, the worst NRR of the tournament right now, and lots of things to improve upon – their batting fireworks, bowling in the death, fielding standards, big-tournament mentality and maybe a lot more.",
        "South Africa, at the bottom of the table, now move closer to home, to Kolkata, for two games, the first of which is against Netherlands.",
        "Bangladesh, at the bottom of the table, now move closer to home, to Kolkata, for two games, the first of which is against Netherlands.",
        "South Africa are now second on the points table with just the one loss from five games, they’ve squeezed themselves between India and New Zealand, and their NRR is the best of the lot: 2.370!"

    "Others": [
        "The AQI in Colaba (barely a 10-minute drive from Wankhede) reads around 239 (which is 'poor') and this one South African just had a look at the pitch but he's wearing a Bangladesh jersey! Oh, it's Allan Donald.",
        "It’s match 23 out of the 45 league games of this World Cup, so we’re right around the halfway mark and what a game it was last night to throw open this tournament!",
        "We’re back to Wankhede for today’s game between Bangladesh and South Africa, the same venue where SA had hammered defending champions England on Saturday after smashing another massive total.",
        "Bangladesh, meanwhile, have just the one win from their four games – quite the opposite of SA – and will be itching to get another W under their belt, taking inspiration from both Afghanistan and Netherlands.",
        "There’s lots to look forward to today:",
        "Are Shakib and Bavuma going to be fit today?",
        "Do Bangladesh have the firepower to match SA's batting might?",
        "Are SA the same force while chasing in ODIs these days?"
