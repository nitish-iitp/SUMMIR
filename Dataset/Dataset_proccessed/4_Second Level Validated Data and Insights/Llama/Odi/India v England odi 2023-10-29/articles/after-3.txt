That's just about your lot for today.

"Unlike their previous defeats, England played well for more than half of this game, but those losses have sapped all of the confidence of a once great batting line-up..." is the verdict of Matthew Henry in Lucknow.

You can read his report from England's latest day of World Cup woe here...

England's response with the bat was once again pitiful as they were rolled for 129. A mixture of fine bowling from India, and some iffy shots.

A quick recap of what happened today then...

England made a decent start with the ball after they inserted India, including the wicket of star batter Virat Kohli.

But India skipper Rohit Sharma's 87 proved crucial in helping the hosts post 229 while Suryakumar Yadav chipped in with 49.

Matthew Mott has just got a little spiky in the press conference following two questions about Eoin Morgan's comments where the former England captain suggested "something must be going on" in the dressing room for England to have performed so badly.

I think now, it has got to the stage where it feels silly to keep repeating ourselves. When you sit here and get a broad picture of it. Having been sat in that situation in a dire tournament, you feel it in the dressing room.

At 229, you are walking in at the halfway stage, everyone takes a breath of fresh air today and know we've got it. It saps the confidence. It makes you feel 10 foot tall, then dropping to one foot tall. The speed of that dip is the concern for England.

'Answers on a postcard...'

More from Jos Buttler on why England have performed so badly: "Answers on a postcard. There's some top players in there and we were a long way short of their best.

"We were excellent in the field. Made a great start in the powerplay. Players found some movement, bit of indfferent bounce and the ground fielding has been as good as its been. So it felt like today was the day it turned around. But the way we batted didn't back that up."

No one really grabbed the chase by the scruff of the neck. Rohit Sharma did that for India, make sure he put a score on the board.

We saw one of the best players in the world, Virat Kohli, do something similarly brainless to Ben Stokes. Not everyone is infallible. Rohit Sharma referenced he had to have a Test mentality against Australia, soaked up the pressure and at that stage, that is what England needed.

England's last four innings have ended in scores of 215, 170, 156 and 129. Against Sri Lanka, they went from 45-0to 156 all out. Today, it is 30-0 to 129.

It is the first time they have lost five matches in a World Cup.

Not sure why everyone is so surprised? When our Test team is good our one-day team suffers and vice-versa. We need to find a way to be good at both like all the top international teams.

There was carnage around Rohit Sharma's but he withstood it all and has played a very measured innings. He still has it in him to pick up the pace and score quickly.

Rohit recognised the situation, he and KL Rahul played beautifully for their partnership that really got India back into the game after being 40-3.

'We showed our character...'

India captain Rohit Sharma: "This was a game that showed a lot of character in our squad. When times were tough, our experienced players stood up at the right time and fought for us.

"Looking at how the tournament has gone for us, we have batted second a lot and we were challenged up front with the new ball batting first. But we got to a total that we knew we could defend on a pitch like that.

"We didn't bat great today, losing three wickets early isn't ideal. But when you are in those situations all you want to do is build a long partnership which we did. A couple of guys including myself threw it at the end but I wanted to be positive. That is how you put pressure back on the bowlers but overall, we were 20 or 30 runs short.

"Defending 230 is not something you see every day. You know you have got to take early wickets and put pressure on. With the experience that our seamers have, I can always rely on them to come good.

"We have got a good balance in our attack. Good spinners and experienced seamers. If I look at my options as a captain, there is plenty for me to work with. It is important that our batters put scores on the board so that they can work their magic!"

It’s hard to see how any of this England line-up will survive after this World Cup. Most of them are old and none of them are performing.

Luke in Wrexham

Matthew Mott out, Eoin Morgan in. And do it quickly please.

Darren, Tamworth

England's shambolic performance goes back to the ridiculous decision to drop Jason Roy due to fitness whilst picking Ben Stokes who is neither fit nor in any form.

The dew came down at what seemed like the perfect time for England. Getting to 30-0 and the crowd was completely silent. And India looked like they were trying too hard to take wickets so from that position, they are on the ropes and you have got to capitalise on that.

Jasprit Bumrah is a brilliant bowler and he got Joe Root with a very good piece of bowling and Mohammed Shami turned it around for them. India look like a juggernaut that is going to be very difficult to stop.

England captain Jos Buttler: "Very disappointing. At the halfway stage chasing 230 we fancied ourselves. But it's the same old story."

"Was dew a factor in bowling first? Not really. I wasn't sure if the dew comes out or not. The gut feeling was that we wanted to chase. It is as good as we have been with the ball throughout the tournament. We took some good wickets. So very disappointed.

"Whatever way you want to approach the game it is about being committed to that. For me it was soaking up pressure, building up partnerships and killing pressure. It is about executing your skill, chasing 230 there wasn't scoreboard pressure but we are just falling short. Whatever way we are going for it at the minute."

What is it with English sporting teams that it always requires a disastrous tournament to prompt a ‘reset’? Great teams develop and change: they don’t need this constant rollercoaster to prompt action.

Jos Buttler's returns with the bat in this tournament are 43, 29, 9, 15, 8 and 10.

He got a beauty from Kuldeep Yadav today.

That trot cannot have helped his confidence to skipper on the field, either.

As a lover of cricket, it is a sad sight. A world champion team, capitulating after putting in a great start and bowling the way they did.

Where did it all go wrong for England? That is something for them to decide.

He looks tired and frazzled. Hard to stay upbeat with the way this World Cup has panned out.

'Used my experience to help the team...'

Player of the match Rohit Sharma: "Looking at where we were after the first 10 overs of our batting, it was important to put on a partnership like myself and KL Rahul did. It was a challenging pitch to start with but it got easier the longer you spent in the middle. We are very happy with the performance.

"I know I have got the experience to bat situations, not just going out there and playing my shots all the time. It was about using that experience to help the team and it was my job there to take the game as deep as possible. I still felt we were about 20 runs short even after that.

"The new ball was moving around and as the game went on the ball got softer and it was hard to rotate strike. It was just about digging in, that's what KL and I kept saying to each other.

"But it was a great performance and we would take that win any day."
