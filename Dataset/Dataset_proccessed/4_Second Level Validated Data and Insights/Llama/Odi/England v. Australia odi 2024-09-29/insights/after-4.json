    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "There's no paywall here",
        "Australia win the toss and bowl",
        "Teams in brief: no Jofra, no Carey",
        "Forecast for this evening is abysmal",
        "The latest forecast is for the rain to begin in 40 minutes",
        "Both teams could if they wanted, yeah, but I don’t think they will. It might be different if it was a World Cup final."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Mother Nature has beaten Mother Cricket, and Australia have beaten England to win the ODI series",
        "It was an odd game, played with half an eye on the weather, but in the end Australia were emphatic winners",
        "The rain has arrived, five balls too late for England, and that will probably be it for the day",
        "England’s attempt to waste time was shabby but at least they didn’t stoop too low"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Rain stops play",
        "Rain arrived five balls too late for England",
        "England have lacked concentration and intensity in the field",
        "England’s spinners squeezed the life out of England",
        "Travis Head took four wickets, then got Australia off to a flyer alongside Matthew Short",
        "England slipped from 202 for 2 in the 25th over to 260 for 8 and then 309 all out",
        "Mother Cricket v Mother Nature",
        "The forecast is for rain in about an hour, but if it holds off for around 90 minutes we should get a game"
