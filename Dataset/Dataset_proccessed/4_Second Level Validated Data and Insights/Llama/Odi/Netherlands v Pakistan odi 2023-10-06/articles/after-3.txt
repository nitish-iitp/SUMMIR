It started a bit jittery for Pakistan but they proactively dug their way out to a good score with the bat and turned things around with the ball as well, to deny Netherlands on capitalising another good start. The quality of cricket was compelling and let's hope that continues to be the case as the tournament progresses. Danyal Rasool's match report will be out soon, check that out and take care.

bezz: "Disappointed with the practice of giving potm to a player from the winning team. de Leede was the POTM, period. " Understandable, but Shakeel's innings was just hugely significant considering the circumstances.

Babar Azam, Pakistan captain: The way Hyderabad has supported us, we've been happy and have enjoyed the hospitality. I am satisfied with the result. Credit to the bowlers, we started well and took wickets in the middle. We lost three wickets while batting, the way Rizwan and Shakeel started took it away. The way Saud built his innings shows his improvement in building an innings. Our bowlers bowled well in the first ten. They stuck to the plan.

Scott Edwards, Netherlands captain: It's a bit disappointing. Firstly, we bowled and fielded well. We thought they were par. We thought we had a good chance at 2 for 120. Probably a bit of instinct. So many of our bats bowl spin. De Leede is a quality cricket in all three departments. His innings was awesome, just needed someone to be with him. Not spoken to van Beek, need to see where he's at. This is a game that got away. We know they have quality bowlers but they took wickets which held us back.

Saud Shakeel, POTM: Very pleased. Tried to follow my basics and be positive to score for my team. Nerves was there as we'd lost three wickets. I was lucky to get early boundaries. We discussed that the pressure would transfer if we scored, which did happen. The last 2-3 months, I've been working hard. I knew I'd be batting No. 5, I tried to improve my shots, attacking options and be brave. Coaching staff has given me confidence. Says he prefers either pace or spin as long as it brings boundaries. He thanks his coach as he goes

Ahmed: "Netherlands lost last 8 wickets for 85 runs. Pity, after such a promising start. "

9:15pm Huge boxes ticked with the ball for Pakistan. It wasn't always rosy in the chase. But Shadab being able to find his lengths and some spin, and get a big wicket in the middle overs was big. Hasan took out an opener as well, with the new ball even. Vikramjit and de Leede scored fifties for Netherlands. The former seeing off the new ball was crucial. He slowed down later through. Shadab prising him out helped. De Leede had as amazing a game as one can have but couldn't finish on the winning side. Netherlands had a decent chance till Vikramjit was in. But a double-wicket 27th over derailed the chase. All bowlers for Pakistan chipped in as they completed an 81-run win.
