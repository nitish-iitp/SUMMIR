That was a pounding. Hard for it to be better in any way for South Africa. They're campaign is back on the highway. England will have a lot of soul-searching to do and avoid losses at all costs. Some big developments are like to follow. Keep an eye out for them here on ESPNcricinfo. Also, India are playing New Zealand tomorrow. That'll be big, see you then.

Priyank: "First part of Super Saffaday goes comprehensively to those in green. Over to the Springboks! "

Aiden Markram, South Africa captain: Fantastic all-round performance. Couldn't have asked for a bigger effort and skills to top it off was fantastic to see. Slightly surprised with England's decision at the toss. We know they like chasing, we'd have batted first. Happy it worked out the way it did. Was good that our big quicks weren't cooking in the heat. (On Hendricks) Really great knock, especially without warm-up. He's been around a long time, that experience helps. He's really working on his game each and every day and has reaped those rewards. (On Klaasen) Him at 5 and Miller at 6 is a destructive pair at the back end. He's come a long way. We've played together for a while, great to see him to see him showcase his abilities that we knew he always had, on a big stage. (On Jansen) He's having a great comp. Takes a lot of pride with his batting and prepares to deal with the worst-case scenario. Lot of ability with the bat, his confidence will rise. Great stand with Klaasy. Incredibly pleased for him. Great way to bounce back after the Netherlands loss, it hurt us. Markram tries to wish the Springboks all the best against England in the rugby and Michael Atherton cuts him off with a laugh

Jos Buttler, England captain: Incredibly disappointing. Come in with hopes of playing well but we were short of that and were well beaten. Changes weren't as big an issue. Throughout the first innings, lots of things didn't go to plan. Topley got injured, we were unsure whether he'd come back or not and get a few overs in, that kind of stuff. It was a tough 50 overs. Thought if we'd restricted them in 340-350 on this pitch, it'd have been a good chase but they got away. Bowling first is potentially a mistake. You always look back on the decisions you make. Incredibly tough conditions with heat, etc, you saw that with the boys in the field. Potentially should've batted due to the heat. Conditions were extremely tough. The humidity, cramps and all other challenges were tough. We needed to get off to a good start with bat chasing a score like that. Ball did a bit, batters got down the leg side. When that kind of thing starts happening, you start thinking the writing is on the wall. The loss leaves with no room for error. We have to probably win every game here on in.

Heinrich Klaasen, POTM: It's up there with my best ever. The conditions were brutal. It's just proper heat, sapped out all the energy. Was told to not run my runs too hard, save energy cos the heat out is extreme. It was a two overs too early. England also looked under the pump. (Chat with Markram) But a couple of quick wickets brought them back in. The chat with Marco was the same and that's what happened. Jansen was next level, he kept me going and should get this award. His runs are so vital. Netherlands was a tough loss. One bad performance doesn't make us a bad team. We had some hard chats, boys bounced back with training sessions. Fantastic performance today.

Aakash : "For the first time points table looks to have correct top 4" For confirmation, it's NZ, India, South Africa, and Australia, in that order.

Renn: "Thanks to Wood and Atkinson, Eng very narrowly escape going bottom of the table due to NRR, -1.248 vs. Afg's -1.250."

8:32pm Utter demolition. South Africa complete a mauling. This wasn't a chase, it was a lot of squirming and whimpering from a batting line-up that crumbled under the weight of a gargantuan target. Lungi Ngidi got the better of Bairstow, who went hard in a bid to make hay during the powerplay. Jansen then came into the picture taking out Root and Malan. At 24 for 3, the game was effectively over in under six overs. Rabada stomped on the possibility of a Stokes miracle with a sharp yet soft caught and bowled. Coetzee's cross seamer nicked off Buttler and pinned Brook lbw. Wood and Atkinson chanced their arm, got some luck along the way, and played some sumptuous shots in their 70-run stand off just 32 balls. In the end, all that did was ensure South Africa won by 229 and not 60-70 more.

Maharaj to Atkinson, OUT

Maharaj finally hits middle. South Africa win by 229 runs as England won't Topley with bat. It was a flat dart on a length. Atkinson made room and went for the cut, got beaten all ends up.

Maharaj to Wood, 1 run

Wood charges, Maharaj floats it wide. Wood reaches out and has a bash. Doesn't get all of it. VDD at long-off jumps up and takes the catch with his right hand. He fell back and tossed the ball back in. It landed close to the cushions but not on it. Saves five!

Crowd cheer as Atkinson somehow slaps it wide of mid-off. He made a bit too much room, Rabada went for the slow short one outside off. Atkinson reached out and forehanded it with one hand coming off

Rabada to Atkinson, no run

Length just outside off, plinked to midwicket. Went hard at it again

Rabada to Atkinson, 2 runs

Dropped by Andile this time! He ran to his diagonal left from deep point. The skier came low, he almost overran it, lost sight and reached out with one of his hands. Hit on the back of the wrist - drumstick - and falls out. Was a shortish ball that was lumped.
