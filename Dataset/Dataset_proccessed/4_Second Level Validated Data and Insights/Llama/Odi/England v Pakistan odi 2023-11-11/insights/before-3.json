        "Pakistan will face England in their last game on Saturday at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, and if they are looking to qualify for the semis, they need to win this game by a record margin of at least 275 runs."

        "The pitch in Kolkata is on the slower side, but the ball moves around under light. Batting will not be easy, as seen in the IND-SA game. Spinners will come into play, and it will be a low-scoring thriller."

    "Others": [
        "England have struggled in this tournament but are coming off a big win in the last game, and that is the same with Pakistan. So it will be a tight contest. But Pakistan will be under pressure to win it by big margin, and England will play freely. So we back England to win."
