        "The pitch at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow is a balanced pitch. The average 1st innings score at this venue in the last 13 matches is 170 runs. Chasing a target should be the preferred option at the venue since the team batting first has only won 38% of its matches."
