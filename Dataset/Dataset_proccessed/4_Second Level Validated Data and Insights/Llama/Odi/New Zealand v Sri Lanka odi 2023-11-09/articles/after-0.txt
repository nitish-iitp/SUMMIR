The New Zealand pacer, who returned to the ODI fold just before the World Cup 2023 was far from his best in the powerplays, having picked up 3 wickets in the 8 group stage matches in the tournament. Boult saved his best for the last and dominated the Sri Lankan side at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.

Boult's first wicket came in the fifth over of the game with Kusal Mendis trying to flick him over square leg. Mendis had closed the bat early and the ball took a thick edge and flew straight to third man. Young Rachin Ravindra, stationed at the position took a safe catch to grant Boult his first wickets on the day.

Boult did not take long to pick up his second as he struck once again in the same over, removing in form Sadeera Samarawickrama. An inswinger once again caught the batter's outside edge and Daryl Mitchell stationed at wide slip was in the perfect position to take the catch.

The third wicket from Boult came in the ninth over of the match by dismissing Charith Asalanka. Boult struck the pads while Asalanka was trying to defend. The umpires denied the shout but DRS overturned the decision. With Asalanka's dismissal Sri Lanka lost their 5th wicket in the powerplay while Kusal Perera was continuing with his rampaging innings.

Perera brought up his half century in just 22 balls, but was dismissed by Lockie Ferguson in the 10th over of the match. The Sri Lankan batter once again failed to show patience and put the team in a precarious position in Bengaluru, losing 5 wickets inside the first 10 overs.
