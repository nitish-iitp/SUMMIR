NEW DELHI: Mushfiqur Rahim played a splendid innings, scoring a half-century to guide Bangladesh to a total of 245-9 against New Zealand in their World Cup encounter on Friday.
Meanwhile, veteran New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult achieved a significant milestone, claiming his 200th one-day international wicket.
Mushfiqur's contribution of 66 runs off 75 balls, including six fours and two sixes, marked his 48th half-century in the format.
Just three days ago, he had also reached the fifty-run mark against England.
This remarkable 36-year-old, participating in his 259th ODI, played a pivotal role in resuscitating the Bangladeshi innings after they found themselves struggling at 56-4. Mushfiqur formed a crucial 96-run partnership for the fourth wicket with captain Shakib Al Hasan, who contributed 40 runs.

Mushfiqur's innings eventually came to an end when he was clean-bowled by Matt Henry. He was trying to accelerate the scoring rate after Shakib's departure. Shakib had been caught by wicketkeeper Tom Latham, falling victim to Lockie Ferguson's delivery while attempting a pull shot.
Shakib ended his innings suffering from cramps in the sweltering heat and batting without a helmet or cap against the spinners.
Mushfiqur's brother-in-law Mahmudullah, batting at number eight, added a valuable undefeated 41.

Boult, meanwhile, became the sixth New Zealand player to take 200 ODI wickets.
The 34-year-old reached the personal landmark when he dismissed Towhid Hridoy, caught at extra cover by Mitchell Santner for 13, in the 38th over.
Playing in his 107th ODI, Boult also dismissed opener Liton Das off the first ball of the match.
Liton was celebrating his 29th birthday but any hopes of a big score to mark the occasion were shattered when he shuffled down the wicket to confront Boult only to sky the ball to a grateful Henry who pocketed the chance at fine leg.
Captain Kane Williamson returned to action after missing New Zealand's first two wins over defending champions England and the Netherlands as he recovered from a knee injury.
Bangladesh opened their World Cup campaign with victory over Afghanistan before losing to England.
