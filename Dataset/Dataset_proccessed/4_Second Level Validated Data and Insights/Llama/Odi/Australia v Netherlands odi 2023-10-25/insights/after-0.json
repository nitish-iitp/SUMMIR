    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It was just about the complete game, I couldn’t be happier. Maxwell’s innings was crazy… I thought we both contributed equally in that 100-run partnership…",
        "We are starting to play to our potential and play in the style we talk about. We’ve bowled quite well but without a lot of luck even though Zampa took another four-for.",
        "We’re prepped as good as we can be. They are a good side and they’ve played in Dharamsala before. Its a big game, its a World Cup.”",
        "Australia have got world-class bowlers but we should’ve been better today. (On Bowling to Maxwell) If you miss your length by a fraction then you’re going out of the park. Full credit to their batting line-up, we almost got in there with ten overs to go but we couldn’t stop him (Maxwell)",
        "It’s a pretty nice wicket (At Delhi) and the ball really travels, the margins are small.",
        "We just want to click for the last four games, we’ll look at a few things but otherwise move on (from this game) quite quickly.”",
        "It was nice to get in rhythm, to make good decisions and give myself a little bit of time, a bit of confidence and a platform. It is a huge confidence booster knowing I’ve got that in my locker, doubts can creep in when you are not scoring consistently.",
        "It was close to the perfect game - if you score 400 and bowl the opposition out for under 100. A lot of our guys got to have a hit and we’ve had three really good wins in a row.”",
