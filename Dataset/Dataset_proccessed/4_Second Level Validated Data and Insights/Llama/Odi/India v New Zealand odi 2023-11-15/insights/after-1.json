    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'I have played a lot of cricket here so I know with any score on this ground you cannot relax. Get the job done as quickly as possible and stay at. We knew there would be pressure on us at some stage, a partnership. We just had to stay collected. That's what we did. We were very calm even though we were sloppy in the field. That can happen.', 'We have had nine perfect games on the field in terms of fielding so these things were bound to happen. I am glad we got the job done in the end. Would 20 or 30 runs fewer have made a difference? It's hard to say that because they wouldn't take as many risks. When the scoring rate is about nine all the time you have to take you chances. Sometimes it comes off, sometimes it doesn't.', 'We gave them chances they didn't taken them. But credit to them with the batting. Daryl Mitchell and Kane Wiliamson batted brilliantly. For us it was important to stay calm. At one point the crowd went silent but that's the nature of the game. We knew we had to pull something from up our sleeves. A bit of magic. A run out, a catch or a magic delivery. We tried everything and Mohammed Shami was brilliant."
