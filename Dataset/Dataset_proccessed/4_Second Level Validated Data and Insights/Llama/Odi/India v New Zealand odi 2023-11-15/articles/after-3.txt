India batter Virat Kohli made cricket history before fast bowler Mohammed Shami took seven wickets, crushing New Zealand's dreams of World Cup success and helping the host nation advance to the final.

India's 70-run victory at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium meant more One Day International (ODI) World Cup heartbreak for the Black Caps, their semifinal exit coming on the back of runner-up performances in 2015 in Australia and New Zealand and 2019 in England.

For India the win means they are undefeated at this World Cup, entering their first final at the tournament since they won the title in 2011, also at home.

And while the night belonged to the cricketing mad nation it more specifically belonged to Kohli, as he once again etched his name into the sport's record books.

His record-breaking 50th ODI century led India to a total of 4-397 in their innings.

Question marks over India pitch change as Kohli breaks Tendulkar records

Five quick hits: Pitch leaves a sour taste in the mouth as King Kohli reigns supreme

Kohli surpassed fellow India legend Sachin Tendulkar with a flicked two to square leg off the bowling of Lockie Ferguson and punched the air as he ran past the bowling crease before falling to the ground and hailing the adoring home crowd.

Tendulkar, who was in the crowd, raised his arms above his head and clapped for his former teammate.

The pair later embraced, and Kohli said it was a special moment.

"The great man [Tendulkar] just congratulated me … all of this feels like a dream, it feels surreal," he said.

"I never thought I would be here in my career.

"I am just glad that everything came together so nicely and we put a great total on the board as well."

The pair are well ahead of India captain Rohit Sharma on 31 centuries and Australian great Ricky Ponting (30).

Kohli had earlier battled some hamstring tightness but with his century made he looked to up the run rate before being caught in the deep by Devon Conway off the bowling of Tim Southee for 117.

Kohli's century, along with another from Shreyas Iyer set New Zealand the impossible task of not only their highest ever ODI run chase but the highest in the history of the tournament.

Even when Kohli was dismissed India were not deterred as Iyer reached his century (105) off just 67 deliveries as he and KL Rahul often cleared the rope to take the host nation to their mammoth total.

Iyer eventually mistimed a slog off the bowling of Trent Boult (1-86) to be caught in the deep. Boult like fellow paceman Southee (3-100) copped a hammering.

But even with a mammoth task in front of them there was a time when New Zealand looked like they may do the impossible.

After openers Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra struggled early with India quicks Shami and Jasprit Bumrah hooping the new ball around and both fell to Shami caught behind for 13, it fell to the Black Caps' talismanic captain Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell to rescue them.

And despite coming together at 2-39 it looked they might.

Both were scratchy early but found their form as Mitchell raced to his 50, with Williamson not far behind.

And in fact when they both made it past their half-centuries the pair looked in control and then India made what can so often be a fatal mistake.

When Williamson was on 52 he hit Bumrah straight to Shami at mid-wicket only for an absolute sitter to be dropped.

Mitchell was striking at a rate and brought up his 100 from 85 deliveries but on the very next delivery Williamson flicked Shami off his pads, only to be caught on the boundary by Suryakumar Yadav.

Shami got Trent Latham a few balls later and India appeared to cruise before Glenn Phillips came in to give some last ditch assistance to Mitchell who eventually became Shami's fifth victim when he departed for 134.

Shami would then clean up the tail to finish with 7-57 in a brilliant performance.

"Credit to the guys, it was a proud effort to stay in the fight," Williamson said.

"At the half-way stage of the innings, we gave ourselves some hope there and a bit of a chance.

"But it's disappointing to go out in the knockout stage."

Williamson, as gracious as ever, looked at the positives and was full of praise for his opponents, who were beaten by New Zealand in the World Cup semi-finals in 2019.

"They've played outstandingly well throughout this competition and perhaps played their best game to date in this one," Williamson said of India.

"They are a top side at the top of their game. At the halfway stage with about 400 on the board, it was naturally going to be tough.

"India are a top-class side with, clearly, some world-class batters and they came out, played beautifully well and they didn't give us a sniff really. They thoroughly deserve where they are."

India now await a showdown with either Australia or South Africa in the final.
