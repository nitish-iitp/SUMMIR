    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It’s in a bit chaos at the moment! The guys are enjoying it, I think some of them have been picking up Shamsi. It was a nail-biting finish, if you are a South African fan you are a little bit happier.",
        "I’m ecstatic for him. He came in in favourable conditions and exploited them and then with the bat at the end - I think you’ve seen Shamsi on social media gloating about his batting! We needed that today and fortunately for us he came through.”",
        "It’s very disappointing - we fought back well but were ten or fifteen runs short. I think the fast bowlers bowled well but unfortunately the result was not on our side.",
        "It’s part of the game… it’s disappointing for everyone (the Pakistan fans) we had the opportunity to win this match and stay in the tournament but we missed it. We will try our best in our next three matches and give it our best effort, let’s see where we stand then.”"

        "Pakistan Captain Babar Azam looks completely crestfallen: It’s very disappointing - we fought back well but were ten or fifteen runs short.",
        "After three and a half weeks the 2023 Cricket World Cup finally got a thriller.",
        "South Africa sit pretty at the top of the table and have shaken off their near 25 year white ball hoodoo against Pakistan on the biggest stage."
