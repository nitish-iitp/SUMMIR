    "Key Match Events": [
        "Jamie Smith put on a careful 55 with Jacob Bethell, but when Bethell was caught for 25, Smith was becalmed batting with the enterprising Brydon Carse",
        "Ben Duckett was flummoxed by a slower ball from Aaron Hardie, and Liam Livingstone was caught by a diving Alex Carey with a legside flick first ball",
        "England were 65 for five in the tenth over",

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "England had looked in with a good shot at the halfway stage after they dismissed Australia within 45 overs",
        "Phil Salt’s short but eventful innings included three flamed fours, a survived review off Hazlewood, a drop at slip by a lunging Matt Short, before coming to a close as he kissed an edge off Hazlewood to Carey",
        "Harry Brook was off the mark through midwicket with a typically sharp clip to the rope from Starc, to roared appreciation for the local lad"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Brook was phlegmatic afterwards, “We’re an inexperienced team playing against one of the best sides in the world – it’s about patience, we’re only two games in”",
        "Obviously we lost early wickets in the powerplay and that killed us. We took some positive options to put the pressure on but it didn’t come off”",
        "Carey said afterwards. “Not much has to change for everything to change” Carey said afterwards. “They [England] are still a highly skilled bunch of players, but that’s one-day cricket, your momentum is key, at the moment we’ve got the momentum”"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "England will have that ringing in their ears at Chester-le-Street on Tuesday",
        "The game was a high stakes affair for England, and they were unable to recover from losing early wickets in the powerplay",
        "The crowd was enthusiastic, but eventually emptied as the game was lost"
