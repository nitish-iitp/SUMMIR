        "Rohit Sharma on the Wankhede pitch: \"I think this is a ground where things can be quite unpredictable at times, like there's so much in it for the bowlers as well. So you can see probably a top spell coming from the bowlers, rattling the opposition, that can happen. It's a high-scoring ground, but at the same time, if the bowlers put the ball in the right area, it can be slightly difficult.\"",
        "Head coach Chris Silverwood on the few things that are going right for Sri Lanka's batting order: \"Thankfully we do have a few people who are in form. I mean Kusal [Mendis] has played some super knocks here, Sadeera has been Mr. Consistent, as has Pathum [Nissanka] at the top of the order.\""
