SL 55 all out; India into the semis

Sri Lanka have gone past their lowest ODI total but not by much. Ravindra Jadeja finishes it off with Madushanka's wicket. Madushanka went for a slog by mistimed it down the ground. Shreyas Iyer ran to his left and completed the catch comfortably.

A 302-run win, the fourth-largest ever, makes it seven out of seven for India. They are back at the top of the points table, and have become the first team to qualify for the semi-finals. Sri Lanka's campaign, meanwhile, is now hanging by a thread.

Shami is the Player of the Match as well, his eventual figures of 5 for 18 are his personal best in ODIs. And we will leave you with this corker of a stat, which Sanjay Manjrekar just mentioned.

Shami's record five-for

Rajitha pokes at one, gets an outside edge and Gill takes a good catch, reverse cups, at second slip. And Shami has a five-for. He has now four five-fors in ODIs, the most by an Indian. Three of them have come in the World Cups, the joint-most with Mitchell Starc.

Shami is now also the leading wicket-taker for India in World Cups, going past Zaheer Khan and Javagal Srinath's tally of 44 each. It took Zaheer Khan 23 matches and Srinath 34; Shami has broken their record in just 14 games.

Sri Lanka 49 for 9, still one run short of their lowest ODI total.

Sri Lanka avoid ignominy

They have crossed 35, the lowest all-out total in ODIs. In fact, they are moving towards 50 now. Their lowest ODI total is 50, which came against India in the Asia Cup final this year. Can they go past that as well?

29 for 8

Angelo Mathews has a great record both against India and in India. But today is not his day. Shami pitches one full, not yorker-length full but pretty full. And it swings in. Mathews looks to drive with little footwork and the ball snakes through the gap between bat and pad.

Shami's figures at the moment: 2.1-1-1-4. Reminds me of Courtney Walsh's 5 for 1 in the 1986 Champions Trophy, coincidentally also against Sri Lanka.

Shami has another but this is as much KL Rahul's wicket as is Shami's. It was a short ball down the leg side. Chameera fended at it but seemed to have missed. There was a quarter of an appeal from Shami, the one where you put your hand up but don't really appeal. The umpire gave it a wide, Shami had started walking back to his run-up, but KL Rahul knew there was some bat or glove involved. No one else thought much about it but he convinced Rohit to take the review. And lo, the UltraEdge showed a spike as the ball went past the glove.

KL Rahul, the spectacularly unmemorable bro who deserves the limelight, as Andrew Fidel Fernando put it.

The lowest all-out total in ODIs is 35, by Zimbabwe (vs SL) and USA (vs Nepal). Sri Lanka 22/7 after 12.

Mohammed Shami is clearly not as good as Bumrah and Siraj. Bumrah and Siraj picked up a wicket each with their first balls. Shami took three. Meh!

Well, while I was typing that, Shami has made his case stronger. He now has two in two. Charith Asalanka was the first to go. And it wasn't a great ball, to be honest. Short and wide but Asalanka smashed it straight to Jadeja at backward point.

Dushan Hemantha lasted just one ball. That was a good-length ball in the channel and Hemanth just poked at it. KL Rahul did the rest.

Chameera survives the hat-trick ball.

Mendis b Siraj 1; Sri Lanka 3/4

There have been so many excellent deliveries even though we are only into the fourth over but this one from Siraj has to be the best so far. Bowling wide of the crease, he angled one into the batter. Mendis had to play, and he tried to do that, only for the ball to hold its line to beat the outside edge and hit the top of off. In fact, the impact has broken the off bail and we have a slight delay here.

IND

(6.1/50 ov, T:51) 51/0

India won by 10 wickets (with 263 balls remaining)

On Wednesday, Sri Lanka head coach Chris Silverwood said the defeat in the Asia Cup final would give his side some motivation "to come out and fight, show plenty of spirit and get stuck into the Indian side".

"They're a very good side, we know that," he said, "we've seen them play some superb cricket this tournament so far. But I think it's a good opportunity for our boys to show what they're made of as well. So hopefully, the defeat in the Asia Cup will give motivation to the boys."

But it has gone the opposite way. They seem to have been haunted by that final.

Siraj removes Karunaratne, Samarawickrama

Just like his new-ball partner, Mohammed Siraj too strikes first ball. On the fuller side of the good length, pitching around middle and leg. Dimuth Karunaratne looked to flick it away but his pad was in the way, and his head outside the line of the ball. And the ball thudded into the pad. He too reviewed the on-field call, and this time, Sri Lanka lose the review as well.

Sadeera Samarawickrama walks in at No. 3 and almost walks at the bowler. It was a full delivery that he tried to dig out in the end. An appeal for caught behind and the umpire, after a bit of hesitation, raised his finger. Samarawickrama, though, reviewed it straightaway and replays showed there was no bat involved.

Sira, though, didn't have to wait much. Four balls later, Samarawickrama poked at one well outside off and Iyer gobbled up the outside edge at third slip, stationed especially for Samarawickrama.

This is the first time both opening bowlers have taken wickets off their first legal ball in ODIs (where data is available), adds Shiva Jayaraman.

Bumrah strikes first ball
AFP/Getty Images

And Pathum Nissanka, Sri Lanka's most consistent batter in this World Cup, falls for a duck. It was a length ball around off that just straightened. Nissanka was playing for the angle and got beaten on the outside edge. The ball hit on the back leg so Nissanka opted for the review but the ball-tracking should it would have just hit the top of the middle stump. Umpire's call there, so it stays out.

Kusal Mendis walks in at No. 3 and Bumrah switches to the inswinger but he ends up bowling two leg-side wides in the process. For the fourth legal ball of the over, he switches back to the outswinger. Mendis pushes at it and nearly ends up offering a return catch. Bumrah jumps but it's too high.

Iyer falls for 82, Madushanka picks up five
AFP/Getty Images

There will be no hundreds for India today but Iyer's 82 off just 56 balls has put them on the track to 350. At the start of the 48th over, he smashed Madushanka for back-to-back sixes, first over deep midwicket and then down the ground. Both hits forced the bowler to change his angle. Eventually, Iyer ended up skying a wide one from over the stumps to extra cover.

Sampath points out that it's only the third time in ODIs that an innings had three individual scores in the 80s and 90s. The last time was also by India against Sri Lanka, in 2005.

Meanwhile, Madushanka has his maiden five-wicket haul in ODIs but it's an expensive one as he ended up giving away 80 from his eight overs. Only England's Adil Rashid went for more while taking five wickets.

The short ball has done the trick. Angled in from around the wicket and Suryakumar Yadav was looking to play one of his fine pulls. The ball just brushed his gloves on its way to the keeper. The umpire was unmoved but Kusal Mendis knew straightaway. He opted for the review and got the decision overturned.

That was the 17th wicket for Madushanka this World Cup - he sits alone at the top now.

... with an innocuous-looking length ball. But it seemed to have come slower off the surface, just a touch. And that was enough to force a mistake - Rahul ended up pushing it straight to short extra cover, where Hemantha took a good catch at head height.

Suryakumar is the new batter and he is away immediately, smashing two fours down the ground off his first four balls.

Spotlight on Iyer
Associated Press

Shreyas Iyer came into this World Cup as India's first-choice No. 4, and in six innings before this game, he scored 134 runs at an average of 33.50. These were not bad numbers but such is the competition in this Indian side that they didn't offer any guarantee either. In the previous two games, he fell to the short ball - an old weakness - and that further fuelled the talks if India should leave him out once Hardik is available. Effectively, replacing him with Suryakumar Yadav.

Today, the first ball he faced from a fast bowler was a short ball. He pulled that comfortably for one. He was on 4 off 10 balls when he decided to go big and launched a slower ball from Kasun Rajitha for a six down the ground.

In the next over, he bludgeoned Hemantha over his head for a second six before getting latched into Rajitha again. This time it was a monster hit: 106 metres down the ground, the longest six in this World Cup, going past Glenn Maxwell's 104-metre hit against New Zealand.

Kohli falls for 88

No hundred for Virat Kohli today. And it's Madushanka and his slower ball that has struck once more.

Around the wicket, a length ball outside off. Delivered at 113.5kph by rolling his fingers over. Kohli played early, then tried to check his shot, but couldn't keep it down. The extra cover fielder slid in to pouch it comfortably.

India 199/3 after 32, with two new batters, Iyer and KL Rahul, in the middle.

Gill departs for 92
Dilshan Madushanka struck once again for Sri Lanka•ICC/Getty Images

Madushanka has once again struck for Sri Lanka. Gill looked all set for a hundred when he tried to uppercut the seamer and ended up guiding it into the wicketkeeper's gloves. There were two factors involved here: Madushanka was bowling around the stumps and angling the ball towards the batter, which meant Gill didn't have much room. Secondly, Madushanka rolled his fingers over the ball, this was a proper slower ball, bowled at 122kph. And that meant Gill didn't have much pace to work with.

Another thing that TV commentators just mentioned: Earlier in the over, Gill had smashed a short ball to the vacant deep midwicket boundary. Sri Lanka plugged that gap, forcing Gill to change his shot for the wicket ball.

The ground was silenced before standing on its feet to applaud an excellent knock.

India 193/2 30 overs. Kohli 87*. Shreyas Iyer has just come to the crease.

How Kohli and Gill deal with short ball
Associated Press

Shiva Jayaraman: "Virat Kohli and the man believed by many to be his heir apparent in Indian cricket are a study in contrast in how they play the short ball. Shubman Gill is a prolific player of the cut shot and has a unique way of playing it - his bent elbow of the bottom hand allows him to cut balls that are even too close to play the shot. Kohli, in contrast, rarely cuts, preferring to dab or pull when he reckons the length is not full enough to drive on the up.

"According to ESPNcricinfo’s ball-by-ball data, since 2021 no batter has scored more runs than Gill in ODIs employing the cut shot against pacers. On the other hand, Kohli ranks 51st in terms of percentage runs from the cut among 60 batters with at least 500 runs against them.

"Both are good pullers of the ball when the line is right, but Kohli’s preferred response to short or short-of-length balls outside off is to either pull them (33% runs) or dab to deep third (22.5%). Gill’s preferred response is to cut, with the shot fetching him 45.6% of his runs off those line and lengths."

Meanwhile, 150 is up for India. They are 151 for 1 after 25 overs. Kohli 73 off 74, Gill 65 off 75.

... But if you are an Indian fan, you would say halfway there.

He was dropped on 10, he was beaten more than once, but as the ball has got older, Kohli has batted with more and more authority. The latest in that was the imperious straight drive off Madushanka for four.

In the same Madushanka over, Gill danced down the ground and smashed a short ball through covers with absolute disdain. That left even Kohli in awe. The two have now added 102 in 101 runs. Ominous signs for Sri Lanka.

India 106/1 after 17

No, it's not the record everyone has been talking about. Still, it's a significant record: when Kohli reached 34, he completed 1000 runs in ODIs this year. It's the eighth time he has done so, going past Tendulkar's record of seven.

In 2023, he is the fourth batter to score 1000 ODI runs. The other three also playing this match: Shubman Gill, Pathum Nissanka and Rohit Sharma.

Out of 26 runs Kohli have scored, 24 have comes in boundaries

So just a three-over spell each for Madushanka and Chameera. Kasun Rajitha is the first-change bowler and he ends up missing both his line and length. Down the leg side and Kohli glanced it for four. Too full and Kohli drove it down the ground.

They say when the pitch doing enough, you should stick to a tight line and length instead of trying too hard. Especially on a pitch like this where there's very little margin for error. But the Sri Lanka bowlers have lacked that discipline as almost every over had a couple of boundary balls. In the first eight overs, India have picked up ten boundaries; six of those came from Kohli's bat who has moved to 26 off 25 balls.

SL drop Gill, Kohli

India are lucky that they are just one down when they could have been three down.

First, it was Charith Asalanka putting down Shubman Gill at cover off Madushanka. Having struck back-to-back fours earlier in the over, the first via a half-pull and the second via a half-cut, Gill threw his bat at a wide delivery. Asalanka threw himself to his left, just above the head height, but failed to time his jump, and the ball went through his fingers.

In the next over, Chameera had an opportunity to send back Kohli. He got the ball to move away, induced a leading edge, got his left hand to the return chance, had multiple goes at it, but couldn't grab it in the end. Worse, he has hurt his right shoulder in the process. The physio is out to have a look, and he seems okay to continue for now.

Amid all those, Kohli did manage to play an exquisite cover drive and an on-drive to pick up two fours.

Rohit Sharma did mention at the toss that there will be some help for the seamers early on, and Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera are making the best use of it.

In his first over, Chameera got one to jag back in sharply to cut Shubman Gill in half. In his next over, a maiden, he troubled Kohli with his inswing. The fourth ball of the over took Kohli's inside edge but the batter was lucky on two accounts: the ball, after brushing the pads, didn't deflect onto to stumps nor did it carry to the keeper.

Madushanka stuns Wankhede
AFP/Getty Images

Dilshan Madushanka has been Sri Lanka's best bowler at this World Cup. His strength is to swing the new ball: only Mitchell Starc has got more swing than him in the first ten overs. And he came here with a plan.

Given he swings the ball into the right-hand batters, he started with a leg gully in place for Rohit Sharma. And the first ball did shape back in, and Rohit did play it towards that fielder, but to his left and picked up a boundary.

For the next ball, Madushanka rolled his fingers over it; the speed gun, though, showed 136.2kph. It was a length ball pitching around middle. Rohit expected it to shape back in once again and left the off stump unguarded. To his horror, the ball went on with the angle and uprooted the off stump.

Virat Kohli walked out earlier than he would have expected. Madushanka kept the leg gully for him as well, and Kohli nearly flicked the first ball to the fielder.

With the last ball of the over, Madushanka tried the same trick once again: an inswinging delivery on the pads. This time, however, Kohli flicked it between the keeper and the leg gully to open his account with a boundary.

SL players to wear black armbands
1:43

Rohit: Uncle Percy was the first superfan

The Sri Lanka players will wear black armbands today to pay tribute to Percy Abeysekera, the legendary cheerleader who died earlier this week.

"Abeysekera was an integral part of the game of cricket in Sri Lanka and did play a pivotal role from beyond the boundary line to support and motivate the players," SLC tweeted. "His towering legacy spans across Sri Lanka’s pre- and post-test eras, and his name will remain etched forever among cricket lovers."

Rohit visited Uncle Percy during the Asia Cup. Here's what he said on Wednesday:

"I was lucky to get an opportunity to meet him in Sri Lanka during the Asia Cup. He has been such a great fan of cricket. Of course, Sri Lankan team but he's probably the first ever fan that I met who was so genuine and the support from his side towards his team, toward the players was fantastic to see.

"When I first went to Sri Lanka in 2006 for the Under-19 World Cup, he was there, but I was a little boy, and I had no idea about how things worked outside the cricket field. So I was not too much into that. But when I went with the Indian team for the first time in 2008, I saw him for the first time then, and I saw how passionate he was. I got lucky as well to meet his family, his son, his grandson, their family is very sweet. I went with a few of my team members as well.

"It's a sad loss, you know, sad loss to the cricketing fraternity because in my eyes, he was the No. 1 supporter of cricket at that point in time. Obviously, there have been so many fans now, but the first ever fan, cricket fan I saw was him. So yeah, it's a sad moment for all of us."

Sri Lanka's stand-in captain Kusal Mendis calls Heads and it's Heads. Sri Lanka will bowl first. "I think the pitch will be better for batting in the second innings," Mendis says. "Only one change: Dhananjaya de Silva misses out, Dushan Hemantha comes in."

India wanted to bat first, anyway. "It's a good pitch," says Rohit. "There will be some assistance for bowlers at the start and then at night, it will be nice for our seamers to bowl. A good moment for me to captain the side where I grew up playing. It's important for us to not get carried away by the performance we have put so far. We are playing the same team as the last time."

India have one of the most lethal bowling attack at this World Cup, spearheaded by their fast bowlers. Jasprit Bumrah has been exceptional in the powerplay, and Mohammed Shami as a first-change bowler is the envy of any team. But what makes them so effective? Steve Harmison explains.

Pitch report
Rahul Dravid takes a look at the pitch on the eve of the match•ICC/Getty Images

It's the same pitch where South Africa smashed 399 for 7 against England earlier in the tournament. Ricky Ponting and Michael Atherton mentioned in their pitch report that the margin for error is very small here for bowlers.

The square boundaries are 64 metres and 69 metres. Down the ground it's 76 metres.

Given it's Rohit Sharma's home ground, he too knows a thing or two about the surface here. This is what he said yesterday:

"I think this is a ground where things can be quite unpredictable at times, like there's so much in it for the bowlers as well. So you can see probably a top spell coming from the bowlers, rattling the opposition, that can happen. It's a high-scoring ground, but at the same time, if the bowlers put the ball in the right area, it can be slightly difficult."

"It was here, almost exactly a decade ago, that Sachin Tendulkar called time on arguably the most storied career in this sport. In the years since, the master has had a stand at the stadium named after him. Now, in the year he turned 50, the only man with a hundred hundreds in international cricket has a statue of his own at his home turf."

The shot was chosen by Tendulkar himself. And here's more from him:

The last time those four things came together, it was the 2011 World Cup final. Twelve years on, things are different. While India are eyeing a semi-final spot, Sri Lanka are struggling to stay alive in the tournament. For Sri Lanka, this game has significance beyond this World Cup as well: the 2025 Champions Trophy qualification is also at stake.

The eyes will also be on Virat Kohli, who is one short of equalling Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI hundreds.

I am Hemant Brar and will bring you all the news, views, stats, colour and updates from this game. While we wait for the toss, do take a look at our preview.
