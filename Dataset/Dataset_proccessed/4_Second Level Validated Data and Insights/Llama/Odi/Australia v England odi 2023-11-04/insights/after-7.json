    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It hurts a lot” says captain Jos Buttler, as an inspired Adam Zampa helps knock England out of the World Cup.",
        "Jos, dump that guilt. We all fail – but most of us without the huge success first.",
        "Obviously very disappointed, we just haven’t been good enough in this tournament, a lack of confidence in the side. A little better today. We tried so much, and as players tried to be really aggressive but we just couldn’t do it and lost wickets in clumps.",
        "I think the clarity in the players, the messaging, has generally been the same but …. maybe we haven’t been talking to each other in the same way. Lack of runs, lack of wickets, you can feel embarrassed and internalise it a bit. In the past we’ve stuck our chest out but this time we haven’t done that.",
        "We knew at the start of the tournament we weren’t at our best, we’ve seen a marked improvement. Adam Zampa is a match-winner, and we’re lucky to have a few of them. We feel like we have a whole squad ready to play."
