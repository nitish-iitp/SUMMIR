Kolkata is Orange!

From losing by 309 runs (the biggest defeat in WC history) against Australia few nights ago, the Netherlands team have flown to Kolkata and come up trumps against a side that was supposed to feel at home here at the Eden Gardens.

Paul van Meekeren makes it a day to remember for himself by finishing the game and taking his fourth. He finishes with 4 for 23. He is also the Player of the Match. "To bounce back from Australia was a huge effort. We were confident at the halfway mark. We thought we had a chance with 230-240, and be relentless with line and length."

For Bangladesh, this is as disappointing as it gets. A top score of 35 from Miraz, and four of the top six had single-digit scores. Another collapse... this has become a habit at the World Cup. Don't forget that they failed to close out the Dutch batting innings too, and the partnership between Edwards and Engelbrecht hurt them a lot.

The Dutch bowlers had to rely on wickets to keep this target away, and the fast bowlers used the extra bounce that is synonymous with this venue and the spinners extracted more turn than usual. This is now their second win in six games - the first time they've won multiple World Cup games. Massive for a team still deemed as "Associates" playing in the big boys club.

There is a very convoluted way that Bangladesh could make the semis, but that's like hoping the coin lands on head 99 times out of 100. Netherlands have better chances, but still relatively slim.

That's all from our coverage. Thank you.

90 runs, 10 overs, 2 wickets

Its the final stretch of this game and Bangladesh's ninth wicket pair is hanging on. The partnership is nearing thirty with Mustafizur more aggressive than Taskin in this pairing. Only a miracle could help Bangladesh come out of this hole.

Fist pumps in the Dutch camp

de Leede can't help himself being involved with wickets. This time he gets Mahmudullah, Bangladesh's last hope, pulling to midwicket, and a stunning catch from Dutt leaves Bangladesh at 113/8.

If Bangladesh lose by a big enough margin, they'll drop to tenth, England will be ninth while Netherlands could be above both of them!

Direct hit!

Slow off the blocks, and Mahedi Hasan pays the price for that. Run out at the bowler's end trying to pinch a single after the ball dribbled away to short third.

Bas de Leede's rock throw gained momentum after hitting the pitch, and Mahedi was a few feet short, bringing the curtains down on the 38-run partnership that was carefully crafted for 71 balls.

All eyes firmly on Mahmudullah as Bangladesh find themselves at 108/7 in 29.4 overs. The Dutch have returned to spin through the middle overs with plenty of turn here depending on how brave you are to toss the ball up.

Dinner options in Calcutta?

That's what Bangladesh fans must be thinking. A few of them have already left the stadium, and more are no their way out. It doesn't need to be a terribly bad day for them if Bangladesh lose: they could finish their evening with Ala Kiev or Cello Kebab on Park Street, or walk down to Hogg Street for some mughlai cuisine.

For those who still haven't given up hope, Mahmudullah and Mahedi are hanging on, even though the runs are coming slowly. This pair will know that Netherlands recovered from similar situations in the first innings, so why can't Bangladesh too? The support boosts their morale but also adds to the pressure.

From Uber driver to conqueror of Calcutta!

In October 2020, Paul Van Meekeren was delivering Uber Eats at home as the T20WC in India got postponed. Now, he's taken a third wicket in his first spell at the Eden, leaving Bangladesh reeling at 70/6 chasing 230!

After Netherlands win against South Africa, PvM told ESPNcricinfo's Nagraj Gollapudi "In the future, Netherlands can win four or five World Cup games without it being surprising." Looks like win number two is loading tonight!

Here's the inspiring chat.

No Miraz Magic tonight

A loose shot driving Bas de Leede and Mehidy Hasan Miraz becomes the fifth man gone as Bangladesh lose their second wicket in seven deliveries.

Another one for the keeper Edwards to gobble and Bangladesh are 69/5 in 17 overs. ESPNcricinfo's forecaster still gives Bangladesh a 40% chance of winning from here, but for that, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah (brother in laws by relation) must do a miracle.

They know each other's temperaments well and have been in such situations many times before. Together they've played 488 ODIs for Bangladesh. All those years of experience...time to bring that out.

Shakib suffers Tanzid's fate

Extra bounce again from a somewhat-short length. And Shakib has cut Paul van Meekeren straight to the wicketkeeper. Terribly disappointing stuff for the visiting Bangladesh fans but the neutrals are enjoying the Dutch giving a fight. The Dutch have basically fought all afternoon today with the bat, and looks like they've brought out the same attitude with the ball.

Bangladesh 63/4 in 16 overs and that begs us to ask the question:

Bangladesh's dot-ball trouble

By Mohammad Isam

Bangladesh’s 45 dot balls in the first powerplay against Netherlands was slightly higher than their 40 average dot balls in the World Cup. It was quite visible when Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Najmul Hossain Shanto played ten and eight balls respectively before opening their account. They were trying to mitigate the loss of openers Tanzid Hasan and Litton Das in the first 5.2 overs. Bangladesh’s dot balls in the first powerplay doesn’t necessarily affect them in a big way, as much as the early wickets have hurt them. But a build-up of dot balls in the first two powerplays has become a topic of interest among Bangladesh circles. It is also quite a visible problem as they end up going for big shot options after a phase of playing dot balls.

Netherlands cannot keep calm...

...because Shanto is gone! He was looking in the mood to play some shots but Paul van Meekeren's wide yorker is glanced to second slip.

Miraz now has to build another partnership for the fourth wicket. Good thing he's got the experienced Shakib Al Hasan joining at No. 5. Also a chance for us to see what he may have learnt with his batting mentor in Dhaka!

20 dots in a row...

You read that right. A proper squeeze for Miraz and Shanto as they search long and hard for a run but fail to find one. Eventually, Shanto breaks free with four and Miraz falls suit with 6, 4, 4 off Dutt.

Bangladesh 37/2 in 9 overs with Dutt and van Beek still bowling. Looks like this pair has just found the formula to break the shackles.

Tanzid trumped by bounce

if Dutt can, so can Logan van Beek. Bends his back to get some extra bounce, and Tanzid is out playing a loose pull. Bangladesh now have two batters with both on scores of 0.

Not the start they wanted, and Netherlands themselves are keeping it tidy in the field, further squeezing the Asian tigers.

Bangladesh 19/2 in 6 overs as van Beek makes it two wicket maidens in a row for the Dutch.

Litton disappoints

The reverse sweep against Dutt is a risky option. And it has taken the bat's toe and popped up to the keeper to swallow. Litton Das goes playing a shot that was unnecessary while chasing 230. With a score of 3 in 11 balls, he thought that would be the release shot. Unfortunately for him, dismissed in his 12th delivery.

Netherlands start with Dutt's offspin from one end and pace bowling from the other. Tanzid and Litton are finding their footing under the floodlights. For now, conditions good for batting. Bangladesh 7/0 in 2.4 overs

Both set batters gone again

Edwards finally falls for 68 and goes back to the dugout with his family watching from the stands. Next over, Engelbrecht is LBW, and Netherlands lose both set batters after a 105-ball stand of 78.

Their partnership took Netherlands from a worrying position of 107/5 to a score closer to 200.

Quiet progress for Netherlands

Bas de Leede and Scott Edwards are quietly adding to the total with minimal risk through the middle overs. The partnership of 31 is coming at a run-rate of only 3.2, but Netherlands will be OK with that, given the four jolts they received early on.

Edwards gets two lives

Mustafizur is finding the Dutch captain's edge with ease, especially with the line that angles away from the right-hander. Litton Das drops an edge at second slip diving to his right. Mushfiqur also drops diving to his right with the glove. Bangladesh fans groan twice in one over. But Mustafizur draws an applause as he ends the over with a maiden. He's now 1-5 in three overs and Bangladesh are 63/4 in 16 overs

Fizz returns the favour

Shakib took the catch to get the Mustafizur dismissal in the 14th over. And now Mustafizur gets underneath a catch at short fine leg to give Shakib his first wicket. Ackermann also gone after getting his feel of the wicket for 33 deliveries. Out for 15 and Netherlands are crumbling at 63/4

Fizz with the slowie

Barresi was looking well set for a fifty on return but Mustafizur rolls his fingers over this ball, takes pace off significantly, and Barresi balloons a catch. Out for a run-a-ball 41 and all three Bangladesh seamers have a wicket. Netherlands 63/3 in the 14th over with Ackermann joined by the captain Edwards.

Mustafizur has looked top of his game with 2 overs only going for five.

Barresi counterattacks

Shoriful and Taskin were getting the ball to snake around but No. 3 Barresi has responded beautifully after the two early blows with his wide array of strokes, in particular square of the wicket.

Ackermann hasn't started as fluently but the Dutch wouldn't mind that at the moment. The recovery is important after losing the openers within 15 minutes of the game.

Again failure for Dutch openers

Singh is gone second over. O'Dowd joins him in the dug out in the third over. The moving ball played tricks and they both succumbed.

Singh was undone by Taskin Ahmed when a flick off an inswinger was scooped to mid-off instead. Shoriful got a length ball to angle across O'Dowd, and he poked to first slip.

Time for the experienced pair of Barresi and Ackermann to get set in.

Netherlands 8/2 in 3 overs.

A tribute to one of the Dutch greats

Not many of you would remember Roland Lefebvre. Martin Williamson called him "the best cricketer Holland has produced." The allrounder was a long-time captain of Netherlands up to the 2003 World Cup where he retired after the team's memorable win over Namibia.

Today, the 60-year-old is invited to ring the bell to signal the start of the game at Eden. Hopefully that's some inspiration for the Dutch openers who have been brilliant in the lead-up to the World Cup, but have failed to have impact in India.

Bangladesh fans settling in...

You take the bus, train or a flight... you can get to Kolkata from Bangladesh rather easily. A perfect destination for the sports fan in Bangladesh to enjoy the ODI World Cup, so expect a ton of support for them. They also play Pakistan on Tuesday.

Netherlands, though, will have ample fans among the neutral. A splatter of orange in the crowd means they're decently represented.

Changes all around

Netherlands choose to bat first and want to make an impression in their weaker department. They've added Wesley Barresi, the 39 year old, to bolster their top order and out goes Teja Nidamanaru. Also sitting out is Roelof van der Merwe, and in comes spinner Shariz Ahmed. Barresi, btw, was the opener in Netherlands' last ODI WC game in Kolkata against Ireland in 2011.

Bangladesh will have Taskin Ahmed returning after a niggle in place of Hasan Mahmud. Mahedi Hasan, the offspinner, will replace left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed.

Pitch suggests its a belter, runs wise. Bit cloudy.

Classic Shakib...

Shakib and headlines go hand in hand. Bangladesh can't have enough of the great allrounder, and his short trip home to work on batting with his trusted mentor has divided opinions. Facts are, Bangladesh had a long break and Dhaka to Kolkata is a 40 minute flight. Taskin said yesterday that it does not bother the team, but where do you stand on this?

Welcome... to the Eden Gardens

Kolkata. The site of some classic World Cup matches from the past is finally ready to make its 2023 World Cup entry. The city is currently hungover from the end of the Durga Puja season - also a reason for the delayed start for the city - and the cricket carnival is here to make them feel alive again. Five games, including a semi-final, but today, it is Bangladesh v Netherlands.

I had dropped by the Eden few weeks ago - it was still undergoing renovation. Time now for it to be unveiled in all its glory with a gentle curtain raiser before some really big fixtures are played here. Expect runs and expect energy. Plenty of Bangladesh fans expected this week!
