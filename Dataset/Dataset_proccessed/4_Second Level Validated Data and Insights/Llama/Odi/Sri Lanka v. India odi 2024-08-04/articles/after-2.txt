Jeffrey Vandersay produced a match-winning performance to lead Sri Lanka to a thrilling 32-run victory over India in the second ODI of the three-match series at the R. Premadasa Stadium.

Called up as a replacement for the injured Wanindu Hasaranga, Vandersay delivered a stunning performance, claiming six wickets for just 33 runs. His devastating spell dismantled the Indian batting lineup, with Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Shivam Dube, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul all falling victim to his accuracy.

Vandersay’s figures are the seventh-best for a Sri Lankan bowler in ODIs, and his match-winning heroics have propelled Sri Lanka to a 1-0 lead in the series.

In the post-match presentation, the leg-spinner credited his teammates for laying the foundation for his success, but also acknowledged the pressure of replacing a key player like Hasaranga.

“There was a lot of pressure coming into the side. I was coming off a lay-off. I had to do something. It’s easy to take the credit but I want to give the credit to the batters for playing the way they did and taking us to that total. It allowed me to bowl in that way. No doubt, Wanindu Hasaranga is the number one spinner. I got to understand of the selection and the team balancing and all that. I had to keep motivating myself. If that is required to play for the nation, I will do that,” Vandersay said.

The 24-year-old also mentioned that he focused on sticking to the basics and maintaining a good line and length. “I tried to do the basics right. I had to bowl in the good lines and lengths. When I got the first wicket, it built my confidence.”

He admitted that dismissing the well-set Indian captain and opener, Rohit Sharma, boosted his confidence early on.

“Once I took the first wicket [Rohit Sharma], my confidence grew. I continued to bowl in the right areas and, with a bit of luck, managed to secure six wickets,” the right-arm spinner added after receiving the Player of the Match award.

The series will now reach a climax with the deciding third ODI on Wednesday (August 7) at the same venue. While Sri Lanka will be keen to secure the 50-overs leg, India must battle to level the series.
