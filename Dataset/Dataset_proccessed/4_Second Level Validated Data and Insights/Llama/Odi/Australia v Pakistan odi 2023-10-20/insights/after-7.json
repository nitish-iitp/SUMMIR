        "Pakistan were in the hunt deep into the chase. But losing their last five wickets for 33, well, that’s the story in a nutshell. Everything must go right to chase 368.",
        "Australia move from 10th to 4th. That’s a pretty good few days, wins against Sri Lanka and Pakistan getting their World Cup campaign on track at last.",
        "The game-within-a-game is Australia being at least three overs behind their required over rate, which means they need this to be completely iced by over 47 – something like that."
