    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "New Zealand win the toss and... bowl",
        "New Zealand’s Tom Latham, “Not our best performance, at the half way mark it was a big score but a decent surface. We weren’t able to build partnerships, disappointing.”",
        "South Africa’s Temba Bavuma, “I think Quinnie and I tried to assess the wicket, I was able to get a couple away, Quinnie tried to get a couple away, but hung in there and cashed in at the end….in terms of the bowlers, look to be clinical, dominate the power play, the middle order, we knew they would come at us and be ready for opportunities. I think it is important we acknowledge that we have made the semi-finals* and move on.”"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "The player of the match is Rassie van der Dussen.",
        "Rassie van der Dussen, “If you hold a good length there is something in it for the bowlers, he says, “and we communicated that back to our bowlers. They did well to keep a lid on us for much of the innings but we knew if we could keep it deep we could keep momentum on our side. Miller and guys at the back did brilliantly, it wasn’t easy.”"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The once sitting pretty New Zealand have now lost three in three, which leaves them in unexpected deep water with two games to go.",
        "South Africa were superb, with bat and ball, and swoop top of the table.",
        "New Zealand drop to fourth, two points above Pakistan, and Afghanistan (who have played a game fewer), and are now in the danger zone."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The crowd roar in appreciation as Henry survives the last two balls.",
        "New Zealand, as well as about to lose today, as well as about to lose three games on the trot – now have injury worries to Henry, Southee, Williamson, Chapman and Ferguson",
        "South Africa need only one more wicket."
