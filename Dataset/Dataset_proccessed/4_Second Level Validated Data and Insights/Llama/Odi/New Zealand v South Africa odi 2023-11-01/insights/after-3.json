    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Official attendance: 31, 914",
        "South Africa finish on 357/4 and you have to wonder, why did NZ invite them to bat first after winning the toss?",
        "The decision looked even worse when Henry broke down with a hamstring issue",
        "Neesham was called on to complete some overs and his 5.3 overs leaked 69 runs at an economy of 12.54",
        "Phillips and Ravindra were expensive too, as was Southee who was hit for 77 in 10 overs",
        "Boult was the pick of the NZ bowlers with 1-49, but he was poor in the field, which added to NZ's misery",
        "de Kock talks to the broadcasters and says the pitch was tough early on, made even tougher by NZ bowling well with the new ball",
        "He hopes 357 will be enough because he also concedes that the wicket got better to bat as the sun set",
        "Tom Latham and Mitchell Santner have a chat at the end of the innings",
        "South Africa's 50 dot balls in the first 13.1 overs - de Kock will have to change gears at some point, the question is, when?",
        "Southee and Santner are now operating, with Rachin Ravindra to follow soon according to the NZ template",
        "de Kock could go after the spinners because of his wonderful average of 122 and SR of 118 against non-offspin bowlers in ODIs since 2021",
        "The surface, though, is assisting Santner's slow spin so its a cat-and-mouse game over there",
        "South Africa 60/1 in 14.3 overs",
        "Bavuma is gone, and it's Boult's terrific delivery angling across + Latham's belief in keeping a slip fielder that's earned a wicket",
