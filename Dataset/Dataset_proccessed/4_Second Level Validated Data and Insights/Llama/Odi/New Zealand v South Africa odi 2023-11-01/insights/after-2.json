    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "New Zealand captain Tom Latham: 'Obviously not our best performance. We were put under pressure from that massive partnership from Rassie and Quinton up top. I even thought at the halfway mark it was a big score but a decent surface from a batting point of view. You need to build partnerships, and to be three or four down early, we weren't able to build them. It was disappointing how it played out.'",
        "Rassie van der Dussen: 'Quinny and I thought they bowled pretty well up front. Run rate was hovering at about four runs per over, we had to work hard, when Quinny got to 50 he said it was a hardworking 50. He played brilliantly, he guided me through my options, we batted together quite nicely.'"

        "Michael Vaughan: 'South Africa have just been so much better than New Zealand, who've made some bad decisions but have just come up against this absolute train. When South Africa bat first they make hay.'"
