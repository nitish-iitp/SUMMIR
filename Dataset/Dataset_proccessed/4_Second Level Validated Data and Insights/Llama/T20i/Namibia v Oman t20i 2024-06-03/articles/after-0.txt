For Namibia they have picked JJ Smit as the key batter and Gerhard Erasmus at the key bowler.

Right-hander Smit has had a terrific couple of years, scoring his runs for Namibia at a strike-rate of 151 and a mammoth average of 66.

He has been particularly destructive against pace bowling at the back end of the innings, where his strike-rate and average rise to 164 and 84.

Leg-spinner Erasmus has had a whirlwind two years, taking nearly 30 wickets at an average of 12 in this World Cup cycle. He also concedes fewer than a run-a-ball.

He had his first foray into franchise T20 cricket in the ILT20 with the Gulf Giants.

Only T20 regular David Wiese has more T20 wickets in the Namibia squad this cycle.

For Oman captain Aqib Ilyas is the key batter and Bilal Khan is the key bowler.

Ilyas is Oman’s leading run-scorer in the past 18 months and is the newly appointed captain for the World Cup.

The right-hander has been one of Oman’s most consistent performers with the bat, scoring six half-centuries since the last T20 World Cup.

A consistent and healthy strike-rate of 161 through the middle overs helps consolidate Oman’s innings, allowing powerplay and death-over specialists to bat around him.

Khan is Oman’s left-arm yorker specialist. He has taken 106 wickets for Oman in his T20 career. No other bowler has taken more than 50.

Used at the start and end of the innings, Khan boasts an impressive record in both phases.

In the past 18 months he has taken 10 powerplay wickets at an economy of 4.96, and backed that up with death-over figures of 13 wickets and an economy rate of 8.9.
