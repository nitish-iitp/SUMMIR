        "The Indian batting lineup found it tough in the tricky conditions at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, but they had a few batters standing up for them, including the captain Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, Suryakumar Yadav, and Shivam Dube.",
        "The fast bowlers for India were exceptional with the ball with the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Mohammed Siraj sharing the bulk of the wickets amongst themselves.",
        "On the other side, the Canadian batting lineup hasn’t been quite at their best except for Aaron Johnson, Nicholas Kirton, and Shreyas Movva, which is why they find themselves in a difficult spot in the T20 World Cup 2024.",
        "Dillon Heyliger and Jeremy Gordon have been the pick of the bowlers for Canada, but they need the experienced bowlers including the captain Saad Bin Zafar and Kaleem Sana to deliver improved performances with the ball in the final group stage match of the tournament."
