Canada v India: T20 Cricket World Cup – as it didn’t happen

A wet outfield was deemed unsafe for play and so the game had to be abandoned without a ball bowled

Match abandoned

They just couldn’t get the outfield to dry and so, without a ball being bowled, this one’s done.

In their build-up the match, on their official site, the BCCI described Florida as a place “where the sun and clouds engage in a celestial dance”. No sun this time. Only rain and wet.

Little changes in Group A. India progress to the Super 8 as table toppers with the USA joining them in second place.

With that, I’ll sign off. Such a shame but that’s cricket, eh? Anyone who has played this daft sport at any level knows the anguish of watching wet grass remain wet no matter how much you wish it would dry.

That’s the end of Canada’s tournament but India go marching on.

Paul Dreyer is our man on the ground:

Daniel,

I’m slightly melting in the stands waiting for water on the pitch to evaporate into an atmosphere that is (checks weather) 80% water at the moment.

Just down the road is the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop that is basically the car boot sale of the damned. It also just happens to have a museum of the luxury car collection of the former owner. $3 parking unless you mention you’re there for the cricket at which point it magically jumps to $20. In case there’s no cricket to be had and people need something to pass the time, now you know!

I’m a little salty the ICC called the ground near my hometown unfit for purpose. Sunny and 29C today. Off to shop!

Happy shopping Paul.

Who’s to blame? That’s what Brendan Large wants to know (sort of):

“Hi Daniel. Just tuned in to find another match looking like being rained off. Could I ask, is this weather completely out of the ordinary for this time of year in the region? Or was this an unwise choice of destination? Also are there any measures in place if this happens later in the tournament...or is there a risk we could see the final decided by a single super-over/a coin toss?”

I can’t answer the question about Florida rain in June or the wisdom in scheduling matches there, but I can answer the second bit about potentially rained off games down the road.

Only the first semi-final and the final have reserve days. Coincidentally, the first semi will likely involve India. Weird that…

Joe Pearson provides some intel:

“Hi Daniel! Not surprised the umpires are unimpressed with the conditions. To be fair, Broward County has seen almost TWO FEET of rain over the last few days.”

That explains it…

We’re about three minutes from another inspection and word is nothing much has changed.

I’m starting to think we won’t have any cricket from Florida after all.

And they say that the US’s influence on the world stage is diminishing…

The other big winner today at the T20 World Cup besides USA is Canada (and/or Bermuda). Instead of USA & Canada fighting for the lone Americas regional qualifying berth in 2026, USA clinching a Super 8 spot means there will be an extra Americas Associate representative in 2026.

Ali Martin has been in great touch. I loved how he described England’s hefty win over Oman had “massaged their net run-rate like it was a prized Wagyu cow.”

Here’s another quality piece with an equally wonderful opener.

More delays

Bad news I’m afraid. The umpires Richard Kettleborough and Sharfuddoula aren’t happy with what they’re seeing so we’ll have another inspection at 11:30am local time, 4:30pm BST.

How about a positive Scotland story in the meantime. They could do with a picke-me-up after last night’s shellacking in the footy.

Nepal were inches away from adding another staggering upset to this World Cup’s growing catalogue.

After reducing South Africa to a stodgy 115/7 last night, the so-called Rhinos representing the small mountainous nation with the oddly shaped flag reached 114/6 with a ball to spare. Ottneil Baartman landed a lifting back of a length ball. Gulsan Jha swiped, missed and then set off for a quick bye that would have forced a super over.

Quinton de Kock behind the stumps threw the ball which deflected off one of the batters before Heinrich Klaasen gathered and threw at the non-striker’s end himself.

Jha inexplicably slowed down halfway down the track and by the time the bails were dislodged, he was short of his crease.

How about a bit of engineering with your cricket?

I really enjoyed this piece from Emine Sinmaz on some engineers from Cambridge who created an ancient Australian bowling machine.

Sky has just switched on their live feed and the outfield looks in good nick. There are several contraptions dotted around the place. They look like monstrous hairdryers. Seems to be working. Certain we’ll get some cricket.

Speaking of rain, take a gander at Tom Dart’s explainer on the USA’s part-timers who have stormed their way to the Super 8.

The rain has stopped.

Still looks a bit grim, but some positive signs.

The covers are on I’m sorry to say. Strap in folks. We may be waiting a while.

In the meantime, why not read Andy Bull’s take on what sort of legacy this World Cup will leave behind.

They couldn’t. Could they?

Canada have already claimed a shock victory by beating Ireland, and the USA’s triumph over Pakistan is one of the greatest upset in cricket’s history. But an Indian defeat here today would shift the game off its axis.

I’m not saying it’s going to happen. India have been faultless so far and it’s almost impossible to imagine how their galaxy of stars could muck this up.

But it’s been a strange World Cup. And even though we’ll likely get our predicted winner, the Canucks will be eager to prove they belong at this top table by signing off with a scrap.

My name’s Dan. Ping me a mail if you fancy. I’m looking forward to this. Should be a goodun.

Toss and teams to follow. First ball at 3:30 BST from Central Broward Regional Park in Florida.
