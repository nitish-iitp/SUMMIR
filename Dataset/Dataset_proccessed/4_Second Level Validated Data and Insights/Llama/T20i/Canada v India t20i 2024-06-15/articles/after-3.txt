21:12  India-Canada match abandoned
Disappointment struck the T20 World Cup as the match between India and Canada was called off due to unplayable ground conditions. 


Umpires meticulously inspected the pitch, consulted with the groundsman, and then relayed the news to the match referee and subsequently both teams. 


While rain wasn't the culprit this time, unforeseen damage forced the abandonment of the game.


20:18  Wet pitch, next inspection at 9 PM


Umpires are out for an inspection. The pitch and square are still covered. They've spoken with the groundstaff. Large dryers are working on wet patches. 


Umpires are testing the outfield. The covers remain on the pitch, and skies are overcast.


The next update will be at 11.30am local time (9pm IST).
19:44  Ind vs Canada toss delayed in Florida


Rohit Sharma, Rahul Dravid, Vikram Rathour, and Paras Mhambrey are deep in conversation. 


Warm-ups are on hold as the ground staff work diligently with super soppers to dry the remaining damp patches on the field.
19:21  India vs Canada toss delayed in Florida


India's T20 World Cup campaign rolls on to Florida for their final group stage match, the last before the Super 8s in the Caribbean.


With Florida's weather permitting, the batters are eager for a proper hit-out to sharpen their skills for the upcoming knockout stages.


Unfortunately, rain showers disrupted Saturday's schedule in Florida. Hopefully, skies will clear and grant Canada a final chance to perform on the grand stage


The outfield remains saturated with soggy patches, requiring a significant effort from the groundstaff. While the forecast isn't promising, any improvement is welcome.


A scheduled inspection at 10:30 AM confirms a delay for the originally planned 10:00 AM toss. 


The wait continues to see if the weather relents and allows for this much-anticipated encounter.
