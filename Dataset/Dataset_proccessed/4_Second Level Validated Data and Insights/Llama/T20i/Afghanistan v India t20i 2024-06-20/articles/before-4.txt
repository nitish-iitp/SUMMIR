The Men in Blue will start their Super 8 journey with a match-up against Afghanistan. India played the Rashid Khan-led side in January 2024.

Ever since the whitewash earlier this year, the Afghans have turned the tide in their favour. Heading in as dark horses, they finished in the top two of Group C at the T20 World Cup 2024. 

The Sporting News looks at the T20 record between India and Afghanistan ahead of their Super 8 clash.

Have Afghanistan ever beaten India in T20Is?

Afghanistan have failed to win a single match against India in T20 cricket. Rashid Khan & Co. have been winless in eight attempts, losing seven times (including a super over). One match was adjudged as 'No Result'. 

The Afghan players would be under massive pressure, going into the Super 8 clash of the T20 World Cup. They would script a historic win, should they beat India in the West Indies. 

India played Afghanistan in a three-match bilateral series in January 2024. The Asian Games 2024 clash involving the two countries ended as 'No Result'. The Men in Blue also played Afghans at the Asia Cup 2022, and T20 World Cup 2021.
