        "Rashid Khan has a wild throw of the bat, touch of the helicopter, and is caught in the deep",
        "Nabi throws the bat aiming for a second consecutive six off Kuldeep, but into the wind and Jadeja is waiting with gentle hands.",
        "Bumrah comes back and immediately strikes, of course he does. Arshdeep wrings his left hand after taking a stinger."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The situation changed as Yadav and Pandya (32 from 24 balls) came together before Axar Patel’s quick 12 further bolstered the total.",
        "India had made a sluggish start with Rashid Khan (three for 26) instrumental as they slipped to 90 for four.",
        "The run rate has already crept up to nearly 11.",
        "Gurbardin powers Axar over deep midwicket for six.",
        "Omarzai slams him, with a carefree shrug, into the stands.",
        "Bumrah smiles happily.",
        "Arshdeep starts with a wide, and Gurbaz – third in the runs table this World Cup - pancakes the next straight down the ground for four.",
        "Arshdeep, struggling with his width, sends down another wide but a beauty has Gurbaz groping.",
        "A natty start."
