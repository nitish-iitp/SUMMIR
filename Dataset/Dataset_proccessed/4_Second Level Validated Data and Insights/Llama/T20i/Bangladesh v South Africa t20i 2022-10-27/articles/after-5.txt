South Africa's hard-hitting batter Rilee Rossouw smashed the first hundred of this year's T20 World Cup as he put the Bangladesh bowlers to the sword on Thursday.

Rossouw scored his hundred in just 52 balls and his innings consisted of seven fours and seven sixes. South Africa won the toss on Thursday and elected to bat first in Sydney.

The Proteas, however, suffered an early setback as skipper Temba Bavuma was dismissed in the first over for just two runs. Rossouw came into the crease and took the attack to the Bangladesh bowlers and smashed them to all parts of the ground.

Rossouw received a lot of support from Quinton de Kock and the duo put on 163 runs, which is the highest partnership in the history of the T20 World Cup. De Kock was finally dismissed by Afif Hossain for 63 runs from 38 balls.

Rossouw would then carry on with his innings and scored his second T20I hundred in a row. The 33-year-old's earlier ton came during the third T20I against India at Indore earlier this month. With the knock against Bangladesh, Rossouw also became the second player to score back-to-back hundreds in T20Is.

The first was Gustav McKeon of France earlier this year.

Rossouw's innings finally came to an end at 109 runs from 56 balls with his knock being peppered with seven boundaries and eight sixes. The South African innings lost a bit of steam at the end and they ended up scoring 205 runs in their allotted 20 overs for the loss of five wickets.

De Kock, who witnessed the carnage from Rossouw from the other end, said that it was a treat to watch the 33-year-old's knock and expressed his happiness at seeing him back in the Proteas lineup.

"It was good to watch, knowing Rilee (Rossouw), he has done it for quite a while now. It is good to have him back in our side. He walked in and gave us some impetus, it was a treat to watch," de Kock told the broadcaster at the innings break.
