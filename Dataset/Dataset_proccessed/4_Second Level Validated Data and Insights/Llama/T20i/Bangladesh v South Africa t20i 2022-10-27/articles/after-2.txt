So South Africa not only win big, but also will be table toppers at least for a short while. They hold a huge net run rate at the moment - remember they couldn't make the semi-final last year just due to the NRR? - and might well have made up for the washout against Zimbabwe. Action shifts to India vs Netherlands, as we bid you goodbye from here! Take care.

Rillee Rossouw is the Player of the Match for his 109

S Sinha: "Bavuma did exactly the right thing in giving enough play to the spinners as well in this sort of a game to find the necessary rhythm under the conditions and get cracking for the matches ahead."

Niamatullah: "Rilee Rossouw beat Bangladesh by 8 runs."

5.38pm Bangladesh were never in the chase except for the first two overs, at which stage they were 26 without loss. The slide began in the next over, and Anrich Nortje completed what he had started, ending with 4 for 10. Shamsi too capitalised on the mountain of a score - courtesy Rossouw's career-best 109 - to get a confidence-boosting 3 for 20, as South Africa rolled Bangladesh over for less that half of what they had scored.

16.3
W
Nortje to Taskin, OUT

The leg stump is disturbed! Once again he backed away early, and Nortje went on a back of a length. And once again, the ball shaped back into the left-hander. Taskin tried to slam that across the line, but was beaten, as South Africa clinch a massive win by 104 runs

Nortje to Taskin, no run

And again. This went past the leg stump, as the batter made room, and Nortje went on a hard length to angle it in

He runs in, but backs out... To be reloaded

16.1
•
Nortje to Taskin, no run

Back of a length, and going on with the arm. Ends over the stumps and on leg side, as he swung and missed

15.4

Shamsi to Mustafizur, SIX runs

Woah, six over wide long-on! Fizz saw one full and loopy outside off, and went hoicking at that even as it hinted to turn away

15.4

Shamsi to Mustafizur, 1 wide

Full and outside leg, and wide called. He tried to sweep but missed

Nortje to Mustafizur, 2 runs

Goes for the yorker, but ends up bowling a low full toss. Sliced wide of deep third

Fizz is the last man in, but at the non-striker's end

14.5
W
Nortje to Taskin, OUT

Direct hit at the keeper's end from Rabada! Mahmud easily short of the crease, almost as if he had given up. Yes, it was a risky run which they attempted, as Taskin got a hard length ball on off, which he pushed to cover and set off. But he ran back late there with Rabada placed close in, and the latter had all three stumps to aim at

Nortje to Taskin, FOUR runs

Swung over mid-on! Back of a length from Nortje again, and on off. Taskin went flinging at that, and sent that dribbling for four

14.3

Nortje to Taskin, no run

Bouncer at 145kph. Bangs it in short on middle and off, as the ball rises above the batter's shoulders, while he tries to sway away

14.2
•
Nortje to Taskin, no run

And again. This rushes on to the batter at 147kph off a hard length, and angles across to end on off. Tapped down

14.1
•
Nortje to Taskin, no run

Back of a length on off. He rocks back to dab that down

Nortje back, hunting a possible five-for

13.4
W
Shamsi to Litton Das, OUT

Good low catch by Stubbs at deep square leg! He had to dive forward with the sun beating down, and did well to keep his eyes on the ball. Litton went hard and flat at a slog sweep to this full ball on middle and off, but couldn't time that well
