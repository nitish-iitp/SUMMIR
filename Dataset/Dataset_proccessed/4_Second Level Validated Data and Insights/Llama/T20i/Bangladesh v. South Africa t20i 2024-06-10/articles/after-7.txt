South Africa top-order continues to struggle in T20 World Cup
South Africa lose 4 wickets for just 23 runs
This is the third time that South Africa top-order has failed

South Africa top-order continued to crash and burn in the T20 World Cup 2024. Playing the third match of the tournament, against Bangladesh, the South African side lost their top 4 batters inside the powerplay for just 23 runs. This was the third time that SA top-order collapsed in the tournament. After registering 12/4 va the Netherlands, 58/4 vs Sri Lanka, South Africa batters once again failed against Bangladesh.

After choosing to bat in a tricky New York surface, South Africa failed to counter the fast bowling battery of Bangladesh. Tanzim Sakib was all over the team in his initial 3-over spell, picking up 3 wickets for just 13 runs.

South Africa were reduced to 23/4 in just 4.2 overs, losing Rezza Hendricks, Quinton de Kock, Aiden Markram and Tristan Stubbs. Despite coming into the T20 World Cup in decent form, none of these batters have managed to do well in the tournament so far.

"We'll bat first. Reason being it is a used wicket. If it does change, we can set the pace and it is tough to chase. We back ourselves for setting a good total. As a whole, the tournament has leaned towards teams batting first. It is about the last 10 overs in each innings, and chasing might be tougher," South Africa captain Aiden Markram had said at the toss.

"100% need to find some form, myself included. The head space is right, hopefully a matter of time. Credit to Miller and Stubbs for getting us through in the last game," Markram had further added.

The New York pitch has felt considerably difficult for the opening batters. In the wicket, players have majorly looked to survive the first 8-10 overs, and then looked to post a decent total.

South Africa played in the same pitch as the one in India vs Pakistan. In that game, India were bowled out for 119 runs, which later Pakistan failed to chase down in the second innings.
