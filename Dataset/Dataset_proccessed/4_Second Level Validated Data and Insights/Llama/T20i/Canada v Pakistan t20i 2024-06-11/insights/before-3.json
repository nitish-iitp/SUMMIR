        "Pakistan are a funny side, and they have played some brainless cricket throughout. However, they are known to come hard when they have nothing to lose. Canada have played good cricket in this tournament, but Pakistan should open their account."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The average first-innings score in New York has been 106, with pacers snaring 84.62% of wickets here. Expect another pace-friendly track, with a low-scoring affair. The team winning the toss might elect to field first, with a total of around 135 being a fighting one."

        "Junaid Siddiqui might not be as effective and can be avoided for this game.",
        "Babar Azam is a popular captaincy option for this game. Babar will open the innings and can score big. He is known to play long innings.",
        "Mohammad Rizwan is another popular captaincy option for this game. Rizwan will open the innings and has been in decent form. His wicketkeeping will also fetch a few points.",
        "Shaheen Afridi can be too dangerous to play for inexperienced Canadian players. Afridi has been bowling well this tournament and will get ample help from the deck. He can snare a few wickets.",
        "Usman Khan has been selected by less than 11% of users as of now. Usman will bat in the top order and can score big against inexperienced Canadian bowlers. He is a big hitter.",
        "Saad Bin Zafar will contribute with both bat and ball. He can fetch ample points."
