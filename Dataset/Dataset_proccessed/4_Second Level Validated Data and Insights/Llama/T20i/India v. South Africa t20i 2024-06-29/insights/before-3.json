    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "South Africa have the weight of history to deal with, India's brightest stars have resolutely reinvented their games because they really wanted to be here.",
        "For 40 overs - give or take a Super Over - nothing will matter as much as the ball and bat they will be holding in their hands.",
        "India arrive in the final with seven wins from eight games (one rained out) and in almost all of them, they've been dominant.",
        "South Africa arrive in the final with eight wins from eight and they've gone through the ringer.",
        "It's unlikely that either team will be making any changes (unless South Africa decide the conditions warrant an extra seamer)."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "But after that, whether they win or lose, both India and South Africa should be reminded that they are excellent teams and exceptional people. They should both be able to share their love with family. Toast their time with colleagues. Chase after their children. Enjoy the compassion of their fans.",
        "If any of that is contingent on the colour of the medal around their necks, we're doing something really wrong."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Outside of New York, Kensington Oval has offered the most wickets to fast bowlers in the T20 World Cup: 59 at an average of 20.22 and economy rate of 7.88.",
        "There is a threat of rain over this final but it does have a reserve day.",
        "This is only the seventh T20 World Cup match between India and South Africa.",
        "Never has this tournament yielded a champion who has remained unbeaten. That's about to change."
