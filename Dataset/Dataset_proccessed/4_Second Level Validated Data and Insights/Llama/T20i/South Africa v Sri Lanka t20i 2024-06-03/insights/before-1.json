        "South Africa look formidable in every department. Their batting has so much power. Further, the bowling unit also has more bite than Sri Lanka’s. Expect them to win the contest."

        "It will be the first-ever international game at this venue. The warm-up fixture between India and Bangladesh was a slightly tricky deck, for the start was not as fluent for the batters. Further, the outfield was slow at times. Expect a similar track, with a first-innings score of 165 being a fighting one.",
        "A temperature of around 23°C, with no threat of rain, is forecast."

        "Aiden Markram will also contribute with both bat and ball. Markram will bat in the top order and also bowl a few overs. His bowling value will increase in New York.",
        "Heinrich Klaasen is another popular captaincy option for this game. Klaasen will bat in the middle order and is among the finest players in T20 cricket. His recent form has been top-notch.",
        "Charith Asalanka has been selected by less than 19% of users as of now. Asalanka will bat in the middle order and can score useful runs. He can fetch match-winning points.",
