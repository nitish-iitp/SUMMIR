        "South Africa have a lot of firepower in their batting line-up. The likes of Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Tristan Stubbs have that ability to single-handedly win the game on their given day.",
        "When it comes to their bowling, Proteas have many experienced campaigners like Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje while the likes of Marco Jansen, Gerald Coetzee and Ottniel Baartman bring that excitement and killer instinct.",
        "Their spinners Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj also play a lot of franchise cricket and they will be able to adapt to conditions well in the USA and West Indies.",
        "The Proteas side doesn't have a genuine all-rounder in their line-up, which is very vital in T20 cricket. Marco Jansen has proven to be handy with the bat but primarily serves as their opening bowler.",
        "The slow pitches of West Indies could make life tough for the batters. Apart from Klaasen and Stubbs, most of the South African batters struggle against quality spin.",
        "South Africa have a great chance to put their history behind and win their first ever T20 World Cup trophy. Their only ICC trophy came during the 1998 Champions Trophy.",
        "South Africa have often crumbled under the pressure in knockout matches of ICC tournaments over years. In fact, during their last ICC event - ODI World Cup 2023 - they lost to Australia in the semi-finals."
