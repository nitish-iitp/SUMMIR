        "Bangladesh technical consultant Sridharan Sriram, when asked how his side will stop Zimbabwe said: 'I don't think I need to tell you but we definitely have a plan. I think we respect Zimbabwe, they had an amazing performance against Pakistan. I watched every ball of it. The way they pulled it off against Pakistan was unbelievable.
