        "Only Australia in 2019 and South Africa in 2015 have beaten India in India.",
        "Mitchell Santner has stressed this point in press conferences; that apart from the learnings New Zealand can take about conditions they will face during the ODI World Cup in October, there is still the chance to go down in history as a team that beat India in India.",
        "Hardik Pandya, meanwhile, has been an upfront and honest presence, even in front of the camera, which has been great (though not for everybody).",
        "Watch live in the UK",
        "You can watch the third T20I between India and New Zealand live on ESPN Player in the UK and on ESPN+ in the USA.",

        "Ferguson: 'Hardik's body language as captain has been fantastic'",
        "Ahmedabad may not want to do what Lucknow did - its already been in the eye of a storm before - in which case India might be tempted to bring back Umran Malik in place of Yuzvendra Chahal.",
        "India (probable): 1 Shubman Gill, 2 Ishan Kishan (wk), 3 Rahul Tripathi, 4 Suryakumar Yadav, 5 Hardik Pandya (capt), 6 Deepak Hooda, 7 Washington Sundar, 8 Shivam Mavi, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Umran Malik, 11 Arshdeep Singh",

        "The weather is set fair.",
        "Apart from a T20I series in 2012, which ended up being a one-match affair, New Zealand have never won a bilateral series in any format in India.",
        "Kishan's 19 off 38 in the last game is the third-slowest innings of 30 or more balls by an opener from a Full Member country in T20Is.",
