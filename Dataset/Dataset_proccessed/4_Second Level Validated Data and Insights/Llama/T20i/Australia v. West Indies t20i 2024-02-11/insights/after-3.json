        "It's nice to cash in and spend most of the time out there,When it (the ball) is not doing too much, you're thinking … that you have actually got to make the most of this opportunity,You don't get too many in T20 cricket when you have got a couple of short square boundaries and the wicket is just really nice and true and you have given yourself a good platform,So I was just trying to stick it out there for as long as I could,I have always relied on my hand speed to get me out of trouble if my footwork is a little bit slow,So I was just trying to give myself the best chance to use my hands to guide into a gap or get it over the in-field and it really seemed to work for me."
