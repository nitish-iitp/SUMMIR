Pakistan will face Ireland in the second T20I of the ongoing three-match series on Sunday (May 12). The must-win match for the Men in Green is scheduled to take place at Clontarf Cricket Club Ground in Dublin. Pakistan went down by 5 wickets in the first T20I played at the same venue on Friday and can’t afford to lose the second match against the Paul Stirling-led side on Sunday.
After missing the first T20I due to a delayed arrival, star pacer Mohammad Amir is likely to play for Pakistan in the second fixture, and wicketkeeper-batter Usman Khan is also expected to get preference over Azam Khan, who failed to open his account in the series opener. The visitors will also want Shadab Khan to live up to his reputation and deliver with both bat and ball. In the series opener, the former T20I vice captain scored a golden duck and then conceded 54 runs in his quota of four overs.
On the other hand, after securing their first-ever T20I win over Pakistan in the series opener, Ireland would like to get the better of Babar Azam & Co. once again and script history. Former skipper Andrew Balbirnie will be a key player for the Irish team, along with captain Paul Stirling and the middle-order trio of Harry Tector, George Dockrell, and Lorcan Tucker.
