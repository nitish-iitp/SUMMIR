        "England are defending a global title, but unlike their ODI World Cup performance, Jos Buttler's T20 outfit looks fit and firing.",
        "England have never yet beaten a European nation at the T20 World Cup, having lost to Netherlands in 2009 and 2014, and having the worst of two rain-affected clashes against Ireland in 2010 and 2022.",
        "Jos Buttler became England's most-capped player and first man to score 3000 runs in T20Is during the series against Pakistan.",

        "England's recent experience of the Caribbean came in a six-laden showdown with the hosts in December, and anything that knocks their hard-hitting batters off their stride can only be a bonus for the underdogs.",
        "Scotland's left-arm seamer Mark Watt has the pedigree to perform a similarly constrictive role as Gudakesh Motie in the series decider in Tarouba last year.",
        "England are trying not to play the game before the game has been played and would be ready to adapt to conditions.",
        "It feels like a real World Cup, lots of teams involved. There are never any easy games. Every game we have to be right on it and match the intensity required for the game. All we are focused on is that Scotland match. That is the biggest and most important thing right now."
