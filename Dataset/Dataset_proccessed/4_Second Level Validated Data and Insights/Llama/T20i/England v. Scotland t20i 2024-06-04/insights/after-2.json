        "Scotland posted 90/0 courtesy of openers George Munsey (41*) and Michael Jones (45*) going unbeaten.",
        "England were put in to field first by Scotland after skipper Richie Berrington won the toss ahead of their T20 World Cup opener at Bridgetown, Barbados on Tuesday.",
        "Rain, AGAIN! It's started to 'pour' again.",
        "Archer continues from the other end. He's taken the pace off after being dispatched for an early boundary, and it seems to be the wiser thing to do with the Scottish openers having found a decent tempo early in this powerplay.",
        "Munsey makes room outside the off stump and sweeps the offie down the fine leg fence for a second boundary - third for Scotland in three overs so far.",
        "Mark Wood to left-hander Munsey - over the wicket - bangs in a yorker with a little bit of movement on offer. Blocked to avoid a catastrophe."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Richie Berrington, Scotland: We are going to bat first, wicket looks dry. The wickets can change. It's going to be important to adapt and need to put a good score. It's an early game, could be different. Need to quickly adapt. Really excited to get this opportunity. Looking forward to this tournament. Focus is on today's game, as a team we are looking forward to the challenge.",
        "Jos Buttler, England: Would have bowled first. It's a great ground, everyone is excited. Delighted to have Archer back, he has been bowling well. We have high hopes from him. We are going for Wood and Jordan today, we have gone in with the extra pacer."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "The inevitable has finally come true. The two captains shake hands after a discussion with the match officials and the game has been called off."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Netherlands and Nepal have kickstarted their campaign against each other. 21-year-old Tim Pringle has struck twice off his two overs and Nepal are 41/3 after eight overs.",
        "The Ireland game has the guise of a feeler, a glorified warm-up fixture, an uneven contest, in scale and stature, to excite the neutral cricket tragic.",
        "The ball bounced and seamed. It also stopped and skidded. Neither Sri Lankan nor South African batsmen came to terms with the drop-in surface, but the Proteas eventually got past the 78-run target in the 17th over."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The T20 format routinely subverts stereotypes that followers of this sport have historically lumped upon national teams. The game and the teams need a fresh look as the T20 World Cup moves out of conventional cricketing boundaries. With the USA playing and hosting cricket, not baseball, change is in the air.",
        "Jofra Archer spent time in Barbados during his search for form after three stress fractures and two surgeries. His mentor Roddy Estwick on how returning to his roots helped pave the way for an international comeback."
