Team Analysis:


Sri Lanka:


Players like Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis showed lot of capabilities in the first half of the tournament and side heavily relies on their knock, but they failed in their last couple of outings. Kusal Mendis can be added in the fantasy squad considering his most recent performances in the tournament. 

Dhananjaya de Silva is another prolific middle-order batter who can earn valuable points. Bhanuka Rajapaksha, skipper Dasun Shanaka and Wanindu Hasaranga must be picked from the squad as this trio possess immense potential to outplay any quality side in the world. From the bowling department, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha and Chamika Karunaratne are three quality bowlers who should be considered while forming a fantasy squad.


Probable playing XI:


Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Dhananjaya de Silva, Charith Asalanka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka (c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Pramod Madushan, Lahiru Kumara, Kasun Rajitha


England:


England skipper Jos Buttler makes direct entry in the fantasy squad as he has been batting brilliantly in the competition. Alex Hales also played a superb knock of 50 runs in 40 deliveries and should be added in the fantasy squad. Moeen Ali, Harry Brooks and Liam Livingstone add a lot of balance to the middle-order, but Stokes has been struggling with the bat.  

Harry Brooks and Moeen can be added in the fantasy squad as they looked in good touch against Ireland. Mark Wood, Chris Woakes, and Sam Curran makes England a good bowling side and these players should make a mandatory entry in the fantasy squad.


Probable playing XI:


Jos Buttler (c & wk), Alex Hales, Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood
