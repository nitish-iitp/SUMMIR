    "New Records": [
        "India scored 196 runs without any of their top five scoring fifties, a feat they had only achieved once before in their entire T20 history, against NZ in Feb 2019"
    ],
    "Key Match Events": [
        "Hardik Pandya scored a fifty, Kuldeep Yadav took crucial wickets with his legspin, Tanzid Hasan dismissed Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav in three balls, Rishad Hossain's legspin was impressive, Jasprit Bumrah's numbers were flipped in this World Cup, Rishabh Pant played a cover drive to Mustafizur that was basically a voice-goes-low-BGM-goes-high-anti-hero-catchphrase"
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Najmul Hossain Shanto said having played in Antigua before will help them, he made a mention of the wind and said 150-160 would be a good score on the pitch, Rohit wanted to bat first so he's happy, he's expecting the pitch to slow up as the sun beats down"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Hardik's all-round show, India won this game on the back of their batting, Kuldeep gamechanger, India might not even be able to play the XI they're playing today without Hardik, Pant makes his move, Kohli and SKY fall, India won by 50 runs"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The crosswinds are such a key element of T20 cricket here and working out how to use them quickly - both when batting and bowling - is a massive factor in who comes out on top, India's sixes record, The importance of Hardik, Bangladesh's opening partnership has been malfunctioning in this World Cup, The gamble they're playing is that Rohit and Kohli are orthodox batters"
