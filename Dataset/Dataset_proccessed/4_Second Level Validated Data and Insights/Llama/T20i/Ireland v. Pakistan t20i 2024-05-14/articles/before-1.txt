Ireland won the series opener with five wickets and one ball to spare thanks to Andrew Balbirnie's 55-ball 77 and a crucial cameo from Curtis Campher in the end. In the second match, Pakistan successfully chased down a 194-run target set by Ireland. Fakhar Zaman and Mohammad Rizwan's impressive fifties took the game away from the Irish team.

Azam Khan also played a powerful cameo of 10-ball 30 not out in the second T20I to help Pakistan win the second match with 19 balls to spare. Shaheen Shah Afridi took three wickets in the match.

Mohammad Amir had joined the team before the second match and also participated in the game claiming one wicket in his four-over quota conceding 44 runs. Captain Babar Azam's knock with a low strike rate was criticised in their first-match-loss. He was dismissed for a duck in the second match.
