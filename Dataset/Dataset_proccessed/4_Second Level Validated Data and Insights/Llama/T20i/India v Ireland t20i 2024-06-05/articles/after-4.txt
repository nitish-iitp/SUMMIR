Cricket in America? You bet.

BBC Sport's Graeme Langford and his team have produced this brilliant video that'll teach you all you need to know about the history of cricket in the States.

Something for you to enjoy before we're back tomorrow with more World Cup action - just the four games taking place.

Papua New Guinea take on Uganda at 00:30 BST, followed by Australia v Oman an hour later. Co-hosts United States then take on Pakistan at 16:30 BST and Namibia v Scotland is last at 20:00 BST.

As ever, the BBC Sport website and app is your place to be for live text commentary and digital clips, with radio commentary also on BBC Sounds.

Bye for now!

Ireland would have settled for a good display in defeat but that poor batting display will do little for their confidence going into the rest of the tournament.

However, getting anything out of this game would have been an unlikely bonus with India firm favourites to take top spot in the group.

It's that second spot, and with it a place in the Super 8s, which Ireland are targeting and the next three games will decide their destiny.

They've just two days to lick their wounds before returning to the same venue to take on Canada.

It's then on to Florida to face co-hosts USA and they finish with what could be a winner-takes-all showdown against Pakistan to go through to the next stage.

'You've got to stick to your basics'

India captain Rohit Sharma: "I said at the toss, we're unsure of what to expect from the pitch. It was all about getting used to the conditions, that's why we wanted to bowl first and see how the pitch played. I don't the pitch settled down in the second innings.

"When there's enough in the pitch, you've got to stick to your basics. All these guys have played Test cricket, Arshdeep is the only one that hasn't and he took two early wickets.

"I don't think we could play four spinners here. When we picked the team we wanted to have the balance heading into the later part of the tournament, that's when the spin will come into the picture. We still played two spinners, that gave us good balance.

"I don't know what to expect against Pakistan, we will prepare like the conditions are going to be like that. This is is going to be the kind of game where everyone comes together and contributes. Hopefully we can come out again and play a similar brand of cricket.

"I was scratchy, but it was good to spend some time in the middle."

Ireland had the worst of the conditions, the pitch was an absolute heap for a while. But India got the best out of the wicket, and Ireland didn't. Josh Little was disappointing.

'We'll put things right on Friday'

Ireland captain Paul Stirling: "A tough one. The toss played a really important part in overcast conditions and then the pitch offered all sorts.

"We weren't quite up to that challenge and India bowled really well to put us under pressure.

"We wanted to put a bit of pressure back on the India bowlers, that's our approach, but unfortunately we kept losing quick wickets and that stalled our momentum.

"They are a quality bowling attack, they never seem to miss. We've got a couple of big games coming up now and learning about the pitch has been valuable for us, getting a run out there. We'll be looking to put all that right on Friday."

India will be hoping that Rohit Sharma's shoulder injury isn't too serious. He was hit sharply during his vital 52 before having to retire hurt.

But his form, after a lean IPL, will be very pleasing for India.

'You have to be proactive'

18:31 BST 5 June 2024

Player of the match Jasprit Bumrah: "Coming from India, you see the ball seaming around, I would never complain when there's help for the bowlers.

"In this format you have to be proactive, you can't always pre-empt things, these are the conditions and you have to adapt as quickly as possible. We thought the new ball would do a lot.

"You want to cover all bases, once the seam goes down it does settle a bit. We're very happy with the outcome today."

Andrew Leonard
Irish cricket commentator

I think Ireland play a lovely brand of cricket nowadays under Paul Stirling. They haven't really had a chance to display that in this match, perhaps architects of their own downfall.

They have to write today off - but they're back at this game in two days time. And Canada will be a handful. The toss is going to be big factor - the last thing you'd want is to be 0 from 2.

A walk in the park for India, in the end.

They won an important toss and Rohit Sharma didn't hesitate in bowling first.

They made the most of it, too, helped by the pitch and some poor Irish batting. Ireland were bundled out for 96 with three wickets for Hardik Pandya, and two apiece for Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh.

Bumrah is named player of the match, and we'll hear from him shortly.

INDIA WIN BY EIGHT WICKETS

Of course he does!

Rishabh Pant reverse-paddle-scoops one over the slips for six to win it! (Yes, that's a real shot, OK?)

India start their T20 World Cup campaign with a comfortable victory.

Shivam Dube is the new batter, and faces two dot balls to start his innings.

That leaves Rishabh Pant on strike for the next over and few would bet against him trying to win this with one shot.

In both matches at this ground we've seen batters get elevation but not distance. That points to struggles with timing on this pitch.

Looking to slog sweep, doesn't quite get hold of it. He was just trying to finish the game off. Too little too late for Ireland.

Not the only one, Prakash!

Suryakumar Yadav tries to get it done in one shot but doesn't get hold of it. The ball flies high, high into the air and George Dockrell has an age to wait underneath it at deep mid-wicket.

He eventually takes a smart catch and Suryakumar trudges off with only six runs needed to win.

Ben White's spin is introduced for the first time, and Rishabh Pant fancies a bit of this.

Rishabh Pant is actually still in some discomfort, whirling his arm around to loosen up his shoulder, but is happy to carry on for now.

He'd love to lead India over the line, I'm sure.

It was in the slot, there to be hit and Pant wasn't going to miss out on that. He's missed out on the last couple of deliveries, but that's easy pickings for someone of Pant's skill.
