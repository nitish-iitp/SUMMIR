        "No fast bowler at the T20 World Cup has played for as long, no bowler has taken as many T20I wickets as Tim Southee, so how is it that the ageing fast bowler manages to stay a step ahead of what he himself believes is a young person's game?"

        "It's their opponents tonight, Pakistan, who've had quite a turnaround and a bit of luck. They lost to India, or Kohli's manic knock, in their tournament opener and then to Zimbabwe by the barest of margins. From there on, every game was a knockout and they won every and now hoping for some luck. South Africa choked at the last step, giving them a backdoor entry and they grabbed it, beating Bangladesh to seal their semis spot. And at a time when their famed opening pair isn't exactly clicking every game, their middle-order has put its hand up extraordinarily well. Such a team is always a threat - as their mentor Matthew Hayden pointed out yesterday. So, tonight is Pakistan's passion vs New Zealand's canniness. Here's the preview by Telford Vice."
