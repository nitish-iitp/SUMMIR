Pakistan lost their match against Zimbabwe in the final ball of the over
Babar Azam’s team failed to score runs against a disciplined Zimbabwe bowling attack
Wasim Akram reacted to the loss and put out a tweet

Pakistan great Wasim Akram has been left gutted with the result of Pakistan vs Zimbabwe at the T20 World Cup. Babar Azam’s men fell to yet another final ball loss in the Super-12 stages of the game as they lost to Zimbabwe, who sprung a massive upset against last year’s semi-finalists.

Zimbabwe held their nerves and defended 11 runs in the final over of the play, securing a nerve-wracking win against Babar Azam and his men. Pakistan had earlier lost another game in the final ball - against India in their tournament opener.

Massive criticism came across the Pakistan side who were called average by fans and pundits alike for failing to finish games from winning positions. The same team had raced to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup after raking up stunning performances in the 2021 edition of the tournament in the United Arab Emirates.

Staunch criticism came from Shoaib Akhtar, who called the team and its management average and said that he had warned about the same two months back when Pakistan had lost the Asia Cup to Sri Lanka.

"Very very embarrassing. Really embarrassing. Keep selecting average people, average players, average team management and an average PCB and this will be the outcome. I am super disappointed and you are losing against Zimbabwe now?" Akhtar said in a video uploaded on Twitter.

Pakistan's loss would mean that it will be very difficult for the side to reach the semi-finals of this edition. As it stands, South Africa and India have been the best of the group so far and are in prime position to qualify through to the semi-finals.
