    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The MCG poses a very different challenge for the teams compared to their semi-final venues, Sydney and Adelaide",
        "The vast outfield at the MCG doesn't necessarily lend itself to huge totals, but it's hard to picture Pakistan winning without adding at least 80 runs in the second half of their innings",
        "Chris Woakes has bowled each of the first three overs from the Shane Warne Stand End and has bowled a number of slower balls",
        "The thinking might be that this is a two-paced pitch, but the plan hasn't worked: his 8 slowies have cost 15 runs, while the 10 pace-on balls cost only 11",
        "Pace off is usually key at the 'G when there's no grass but not when there's this much coverage,"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Shiva Jayaraman: How good was that over from Adil Rashid? A maiden and the wicket of the best batter in the opposition to play the conditions on offer at the MCG",
        "Alex Malcolm, our resident MCG expert, has a simple message for England's seamers: pace on, stand the seam up",
        "Alex Malcolm is one of ESPNcricinfo's men at the 'G and reports that Dawid Malan - who missed England's semi-final win against India with a groin strain - netted alongside Phil Salt very briefly before walking out to allow Alex Hales in",
        "There's good news from Melbourne: it's been dry so far on Sunday and the prospects of play are looking significantly better than they did 24 hours ago"
