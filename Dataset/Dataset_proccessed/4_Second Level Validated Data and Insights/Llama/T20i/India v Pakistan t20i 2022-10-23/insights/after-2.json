        "Virat Kohli said amidst a cacophony of noise in the post-match presentation, 'I honestly have no words, I have no idea how that happened.'",
        "Hardik Pandya kept telling Kohli 'believe, believe we can do it, stay til the end'.",

I got 82 off 52 and today I got 82 off 53. They are exactly the same innings but I think today I will count this one higher because of the magnitude of the game and what the situation was. It seemed impossible.'"
