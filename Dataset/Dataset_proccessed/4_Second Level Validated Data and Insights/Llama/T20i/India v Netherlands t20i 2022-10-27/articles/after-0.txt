After winning the highly anticipated clash against Pakistan, India will take on Netherlands in their second match of the T20 World Cup Super 12 in Sydney on Thursday (October 27).

Rohit Sharma's men were tested in the closely-contested match against the arch-rivals, with Arshdeep Singh's heroics and vintage Virat Kohli's masterclass helped India to secure a four-wicket win. After starting their T20 World Cup campaign on a positive note, India would aim to build on the momentum with an eye on the semi-final race.

There were chances of rain during the India versus Pakistan clash, but the rain gods decided to stay away as there was no interruption at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. However, days after the blockbuster match, rain gods smiled on Ireland as they stunned England with a five-run win (DLS) and the match between New Zealand and Afghanistan was abandoned without a ball being bowled.

In Sydney, the weather forecast is better with no prediction of rain interruption. The weather is likely to stay clear throughout the match proceedings.

India had an optional training session on Tuesday in the lead-up to the match against Netherlands. The India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, in a press conference, confirmed that no player would be rested for the match. He also stated that all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who suffered from cramps towards the end of Pakistan match, is "alright and fit to play".

"We are not going to rest anyone. I think we have a momentum going in the tournament, you need individuals to be in the form as well," Mhambrey said. "Hardik wants to play all matches. We are not looking at whom to rest. He is an important player for us, he is bowling as well as batting for us."
