India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: IND beat ZIM by 10 wickets and seal the series 3-1 in Harare

That's it is Jaiswal who scores a boundary and ends up on 93 to finish the game of. Shubman Gill supported the lef-hander nicely with a valuable half-century brilliant win for India who chased 157 without losing a wicket and 28 balls to spare. With the win, India also have won the series. 

19:18 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 14.2 overs IND 143/0

India has slowed down a bit in the last few overs which might be due to the ball getting soft and both the batsmen are also nearing their landmarks. It ahs been a comprehensive run-chase from India at no point have they flickered in the chase. Bennett comes into the attack.

19:14 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 13.1 overs IND 130/0

Akram who has come in pace of Hamilton Masakadza looked average. He did not succeed in picking wicket and neither did he contain the batters in the middle overs. A change that did not work for Zimbabwe as per plan execution. 

19:10 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 12.1 overs IND 119/0

Good comeback over from Muzarambani. Irrespective of how the series panned out and disappointing performances from batting Muzarabani has outshone everyone. He is tall and bowls a brisk pace and can hit hard lenghs consistently a valuable prospect.

19:05 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 11 overs IND 115/0

While Gill is looking to still time the ball and play orthodox cricket Jaiswal is giving a wild swing at everything. The opening partnership has complemented here nicely indicating that they are a duo that can occupy the position for a long time in white-ball format. 

19:00 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 10.1 overs IND 113/0

The body language of Zimbabwe is down here and understandably so as India has given nothing away. They have been onto the bowling right from ball one and their intentions were also seen in running between the wickets. It is hard to see this game go past 16th over.

18:55 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 9.2 overs IND 92/0

Another expensive over from Raza the runs are flowing since he has brought himself on. At the half-way mark, the total looked like Zimbabwe would compete however both the Indian openers are making a mockery of this chase. 

18:52 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 8.3 overs IND 79/0

Raza has now used all his five bowling options and the have not been able to get a wicket. Given Jaiswal is a left-hander he might consider bringing in Bennett for a couple of overs. India is getting to the target quickly and faster and the Zimbabwe skipper needs to be on his toes with captaincy. 

18:48 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 7.2 overs IND 72/0

Yashasvi Jaiswal has reached his half-century here. One common thing about Jasiwal's innings construction has been his willingness to take on the new bowler on the first over of his spell and push him onto the back foot and one those initial plans are distorted he has been milking the singles away.

18:45 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 6 overs IND 61/0

This is a good partnership opening from both openers while Jaiswal has been going after the bowling Shubman Gill has taken a back seat and is letting Jaiswal do his thing. The Powerplay with the ball has gone terribly for Zimbabwe here. 

18:40 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 5.1 overs IND 58/0

Good comeback over from Ngavara he stuck to his lines and lengths and Jaiswal too now seems to have gone into the zone where he now wants to make a big score after pushing the bowlers onto the backfoot. A Jos Buttler-like approach in the T20 opening.

18:36 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 4.1 overs IND 54/0

Sikandar Raza has brought in the fourth bowler in four overs however, Jaiswal is on his merry way. While Zimbabwe openers have started well the Indian openers are making a mockery of this chase early in the piece. They pushed Zimbabwe on the back in the Powerplay.

18:32 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 3.1 overs IND 44/0

Jaiswal is climbing onto Zimbabwe pacers here. He is going on the back foot and coming down the track as well from time to time to smack the bowlers for boundaries at the moment they do not have answers for Jaiswal's assault.

18:27 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 2.1 overs IND 35/0

Muzarambani has taken the second over for Zimbabwe and it has been a poor over from him. He has bowled brilliantly throughout the series but today he has not got the right length for the surface. India is underway here with a quick start.

18:22 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 1 overs IND 15/0

Ngavara has taken the new ball for Zimbabwe upfront and Yashasvi Jaiswal got the measure of line and length and smacked him for boundaries. The batter stayed on the back-foot and punched the ball nicely on either side of the wicket. 

18:17 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Welcome back!

We are back with the chase the stadium is filled and Ngavara has taken the new ball for Zimbabwe. The approach of the Indian players will be fascinating in this run chase. It is Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill to open for India.

18:06 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: ZIM 152/7 (20 overs) vs IND in Harare

Madande hit the ball through the mid-wicket and was caught by Rinku Singh in the final delivery. Just five runs have come off that over a good comeback from Khaleel. This is a decent total by ZImbabwe it is going to be an interesting chase from India.

18:00 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 19.1 overs ZIM 147/6

Deshpande picked up Raza which is the wicket India needs. Raza's wicket would cut down at least 10-15 runs unless Madande comes in and players a blistering cameo. Khaleel is set to bowl the final over. As we update Khaleel picks Myers.

17:54 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 18.1 overs ZIM 139/4

Bishnoi comes and closes out his spell it is another day without a wicket for a leg-spinner. He looked threatening at times but Zimbabwe batters have got better at picking him as the series went on. Zimbabwe has reached a decent total here already. 

17:50 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 17.1 overs ZIM 130/4

Khaleel came back into the attack and bowled an 18-run over. He was bowling slower ones to which Zimbabwe batters were setting themselves up and waiting. Excellent batting this from Sikandar Raza he is playing a match-changing innings here. 

17:43 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 16 overs ZIM 111/4

Sundar is done for the day. Not the greatest spell from him given how his tournament went so far. The pitch also has been better for batting and new bowlers could not pick wickets so not too many things going for spinners today. 

17:40 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 15.2 overs ZIM 101/4

Campbell is the last one who is dismissed Raza tried to push one ball and tried to steal a single however, the ball only reached as far as Bisnoi and non-strike Cambell was halfway down the pitch and Bishnoi hit the bull's eye as Campbell was looking to get back after Raza denied no single half-way through.

17:34 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 14.2 overs ZIM 95/3

Bennett was struggling with his timing throughout that innings and was eventually put out of his misery by Sundar. The batter hit one straight to cover the fielder. Campbell has walked into the middle for Zimbabwe. Despite the wicket Zimbabwe is in a solid position here. 

17:29 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 13.1 overs ZIM 90/2

A single down the ground has taken Sikandar Raza to 2000 international runs what a player he has emerged into for Zimbabwe in recent times he has been their best player and also has been leading them from front on the field. 

17:27 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 12.3 overs ZIM 82/2

Shivam Dube delivered a loosner down the leg-side of the first ball which Raza placed it for a boundary through fine-leg with perfection. Nevertheless, whenever the bowler has pulled his length back and bowled a touch short the ball seems to slow down a bit.

17:22 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 11.1 overs ZIM 75/2

Ruturaj's fielding at mid-off spilled a simple chance. Abhishek Sharma tossed one up and Bennett tried to loft it through mid-wicket however beaten in flight the ball went up in the air and Gaikwad spilled it. India's fielding today has been poor, to say the least.

17:19 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 10.2 overs ZIM 68/2

Shivam Dube digs one into the surface which Madhevere danced down the track and pulls and gets caught yet again by Rinku Singh on the boundary. Both Zimbabwe openers have departed Sikandar Raza has walked into the middle now. 

17:14 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 9.1 overs ZIM 64/1

Abhishek Sharma gets the breakthrough it was a short one which Mumaramani pulled out into the longer side and was caught by  Rinku Singh at mid-wicket boundary. Shubman Gill is now getting the quota of his fifth bowlers done here.

17:09 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 8.1 overs ZIM 59/0

This partnership is now turning ominous for India. Both openers not only are piling on runs but they also have not looked in any discomfort so far. There has been controlled aggression from the players and testing times for Shubman Gill the captain.

17:06 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 7.1 overs ZIM 54/0

The ball hit Marumani's pads and the on-field umpire gave it out however, when reviewed it showed the ball of Ravi Bishnoi was pitching outside leg-stump. As we update both Zimbabwe openers have now put on a 50-run opening partnership here. 

17:00 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 6.2 overs ZIM 39/0

This is by far the best Powerplay for Zimbabwe in this series. They have not only played their shots but also rotated the strike nicely. Seems like they have a tactic to attack seamers and be cautious gainst spinners early on

16:56 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 5.1 overs ZIM 39/0

Spin has been introduced by India early here. Usually whenever Khaleel has played Shubman Gill gave him three overs in a bounce and today given the situation Gill seems like he is changing the tactics and adapting to the situation. 

16:51 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 4 overs ZIM 35/0

This is a solid start for Zimbabwe both openers have looked solid here first up. Madhevere is batting beautifully here is timing the ball sweetly and getting some lovely boundaries away. This is concerning for India now. 

16:46 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 3.1 overs ZIM 25/0

Sloppy fielding from India. First they gave away a boundary through overthrows and then Madhevere danced down the track to hit Khaleel back over his head but got toe end which went up in the air and Dube at mid-on dropped.

16:40 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 2.1 overs ZIM 15/0

Tushar Deshpande starts with an expensive over first up. He tried to hit a good length and bowl stump to stump however, once he pitched the ball on leg-stump which was flicked for a boundary and the other time he was too short. 

16:36 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: After 1.1 overs ZIM 4/0

Khaleel started the over well by taking the ball away from the batter however, in the middle of the over he decided to target the pads of batters to get LBW which he overpitched and bowled almost on leg-stump which made it easy for batters. 

16:28 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Tino Mawoyo and Abhinav Mukund

Western side of the ground. 60m and 80m square boundaries. First look on the surface, not too much grass. It's very hard. The challenge for the Zimbabwe batters has been picking the Indian spinners. The last game, they picked Bishnoi better. Rotate the strike a bit more, find gaps. It's about management more than the surface. Best surface we've had for this series.

16:27 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Tushar Deshpande ahead of game

Very happy to be here. It all goes back to my childhood days when I dreamt of playing for my country. Being here wearing the blue feels very proud. Means a lot to me. The atmosphere is really great here. Playing for CSK in the IPL helped me. That experience will surely help me in the internationals. I started as a batsman, so that comes naturally to me, looking to refine it and I have been working on it. Overall the atmosphere in the team is chill.

16:21 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: No chance for finishers in 3rd T20I

India’s top-heavy line-up meant Sanju Samson and Rinku Singh only managed 8 deliveries between them. But are sure-shot inclusions going forward, and it won’t make India sweat about their form as India still managed a decent score.

16:12 (IST)

13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Sikandar Raza at toss

We wanted to bat first. The wicket tends to get slower and slower. We've got a vision for 2026, the only way to get better is quality game time. Hopefully our top-three can click. Our idea is for all three departments to perform. The boys are hungry. Wellington Masakadaza misses out. Faraz Akram comes in.

16:09 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Shubman Gill at toss

We'll bowl first. Looks like a fresh wicket. Hopefully there's going to be something in it for the fast bowlers. The death bowling is where we can improve. We got a little complacent (in the previous match). Tushar Deshpande makes his debut in place of Avesh Khan.

India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: If more of us get to play cricket in franchises, the game would draw more young talent to it: Zimbabwe’s Clive Madande part 2

Amidst the chaos, they somehow spun an odd upset or two, like beating Australia in an ODI in Townsville, in Queensland, or upending Pakistan in the 2022 edition of the World Cup. But the golden generation of the Flower brothers, Neil Johnson, Murray Goodwin and Heath Streak has become a distant memory. Many left the country, Streak passed away last year, but some, like the first Test captain Dave Houghton, have stayed back to help the new generation come through. “Guys like Houghton, Tatenda Taibu, I speak to them regularly, for advice, motivation and tips. Whenever I feel like struggling I go back to them,” he says.

Houghton’s men nearly pulled an upset over India in their inaugural Test, after his men had beaten England in a 1992 World Cup game. But from lively giant-killers they became forgotten minnows, hitting the headlines only for wrong reasons. Suspension of the board, or a former player hiding a bookie’s approach. Matches, inevitably, dried up. In the last six years, they played only 10 Tests and are not part of the World Test Championship cycle; the last time they played a top-10 ODI nation was in 2022, the subsequent years spent labouring in the World Cup qualifiers. They couldn’t qualify for the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies, the only full member who was not part of the series.

13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: If more of us get to play cricket in franchises, the game would draw more young talent to it: Zimbabwe’s Clive Madande part 1

Clive Madande remembers the day cricket became a part of his life. He was just a 12-year-old schoolboy when his father dragged him to the Harare Sports Club for a Test match between Pakistan and Zimbabwe in 2014. “It was one of the greatest days in Zimbabwean cricket. We beat Pakistan by 24 runs, and I thought well I should play this game,” the wicket-keeper batsman says. A decade later, he is one of the key figures in resuscitating the country’s lost cricketing heritage.

The defeat was perceived as a precursor of better days. Even though the victory was achieved against a side reputed to shower generosity on lower-rung teams, the country’s cricketing circle celebrated. Instead, in the next decade Zimbabwe slipped into the vortex of familiar demons. Administrative chaos, lack of infrastructure, suspension of the board due to undue interference of government, salary cuts and delayed payments, besides a general dearth in talent stalled their progress.

India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Washington Sundar after getting Player Of The Match

Feels amazing and every time I play for the country, it feels amazing. It was definitely a better wicket, in the first two games there was more for the bowlers compared to this game, our batters batted well. (On the partnership between Myers & Madande) It did put a lot of pressure on us and we wanted to execute our plans the best we can to restrict them. Hopefully, we get to see a lot of places in Zimbabwe and explore more, hopefully we can seal the series on Saturday.

15:40 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Sikandar Raza after India's win

I think it's the fielding again, we are proud of our fielding but the wheels came off today, we gave away 20 extra runs and we lost by 23 runs. We still have problems at the top but I have utmost faith in them that they will come good some time. We have tried 15 different partners (openers) in the last year and a half or so. There is a lot of cricket going on in the country and club cricket has revived. It's time that our players including myself take up the responsibility. The youngsters making mistakes is acceptable but the senior players need to step up. You cannot fix a problem by creating another problem, we have picked 3 openers for a reason. The openers that have been picked up should be given a run. (On Muzarabani) He he has been outstanding, sometimes the rewards don't come but in the long run the rewards do come.

15:35 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Shubman Gill after India's win

Definitely it feels very good, it was a crucial game for us, the way we started with the bat and ball was good. The wicket was a bit double-paced, the odd ball was gripping and it was not easy to hit the length balls, that's what we discussed with our bowlers. We know that if there is something in the wicket, it will be more with the new ball, and as the ball gets old it's a bit easier to score. Everyone is contributing and that's a good sign.

15:29 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Washington special part 2

Among those on the fringes, this tour is crucial for Washington. A spinner who bowls in the Powerplay, his batting too is under-utilised. Another top-order batsman, he is vying for a slot in the lower- middle-order and though he hasn’t had the opportunity to bat, the off-spinner got a chance to show his worth with the ball. With Ravi Bishnoi – who took a stunner at cover – being the only other spinner in the squad, Washington will have a run of matches to show what he has to offer.

With big boundaries in play, he slowed down his pace and bowled outside the off-stump, and it fetched him the wickets of Sikandar Raza, Jonathan Campbell and Clive Madande before Dion Myres (65 off 49) and Wellington Masakadza provided something for the locals to cheer.

15:24 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Washington special

The total proved way beyond Zimbabwe’s reach. By the time Avesh Khan and Khaleel Ahmed had combined to leave the hosts struggling at 19/3 in 3.1 overs, the chase was more or less over. From there on, it was an opportunity for Washington to send a reminder.

During the last IPL, when he played just two matches for Sunrisers Hyderabad, he bowled only 5 overs, which played a role in him not getting a spot in the T20 World Cup squad.

15:19 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: No chance for finishers

India’s top-heavy line-up meant Sanju Samson and Rinku Singh only managed 8 deliveries between them. But are sure-shot inclusions going forward, and it won’t make India sweat about their form as India still managed a decent score.

15:14 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Coming to the party part 2

Between Jaiswal and Abhishek, it is evident who is higher in the pecking order despite modest returns in IPL 2024. Jaiswal may not be as explosive and natural fit in T20s like Abhishek, but few can hit the ball as long and hard as he does. And unlike Abhishek, Jaiswal also has the game to bat deep into the innings without having to change his game. It is this trait that is making India look at him as an all-format player. It hasn’t come off for him in T20Is as yet, as he got out after making 36 in his first match since the IPL.

For Gill, it was an innings that showed him the mirror in terms of where he stood in T20Is. The high-risk, intent-full batting doesn’t seem to come naturally to him. Like Virat Kohli did in the IPL, he is showing a willingness to change his approach, showing aggressive intent. But there are plenty of yards for him to gain as despite departing only on the last ball off the 18th over, he only had 66 runs to show from 49 deliveries.

15:10 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Coming to the party

But on Wednesday, he didn’t have any choice but to hit top gear straight away as Gill was striking only at 120.68 at the half-way stage.

Zimbabwe’s fielding helped him on his way to an impressive 49 off just 28 deliveries. After an unbeaten 77 at No.3, another creditable performance at No.4 means he will most likely vie for a slot alongside Gill for the right-handed opener’s role going forward. For the left-hander’s role, it seems a battle between Jaiswal and Abhishek.

15:05 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Jaiswal-Gill's opening combination

With Jaiswal and Gill putting together a 67-run stand, Abhishek came in only in the ninth over, well past the Powerplay. In what were the most batter-friendly conditions they have witnessed so far on this tour, he struggled for fluency and fell for just 10.

Gaikwad reached the middle in the 11th over off the innings. Right through the IPL, he played as an opener who accelerated gradually. Batting in the middle overs, where teams mostly rely on explosive batsmen, he had an unfamiliar role to don.

15:00 (IST)
13 JUL 2024
India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Jaiswal's introduction in last game

With Jaiswal joining the team ahead of Wednesday’s match, all eyes were on how India were going to shape their batting order. With a top-heavy squad at their disposal, it was a given that at least one of their four openers on tour would have to bat out of position, what Ruturaj Gaikwad did in the first two matches. But India went a step further, slotting Jaiswal as Gill’s partner at the top.

It meant Abhishek, who made it to the team on the back of his electrifying performances in the IPL and scored a century off 46 deliveries as an opener in the last game, was pushed down to No.3 and Gaikwad went further down. Warming the bench on Wednesday were Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel and Jitesh Sharma.

India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad lead from the top before Washington Sundar seals 23-run win in 3rd T20I

The Zimbabwe tour is turning out to be an audition for India’s top order going forward, now that Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have retired from T20Is. After Abhishek Sharma’s century in the previous match, it was the turn of Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal to show what they can offer as India posted another comprehensive win in Harare on Wednesday. After the batting unit powered them to 182/4, Washington Sundar’s Player-of-the-Match spell of 3/15 gave India a 23-run win.

India lead the series 2-1 with the last two T20Is set to be played over the weekend.

India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Tushar Desphande to debut?

Playing only two frontline seamers in Avesh Khan and Khaleel Ahmed, India were kept afloat by spinner Washington Sundar who nabbed three wickets for only 15 runs in four overs. As has been the norm in previous matches, India may continue to rotate their seamers, probably handing a debut to Tushar Deshpande or bringing left-arm seamer Khaleel Ahmed back into the XI.

India could also bring back all-rounder Riyan Parag, resting one of the four opening options in the XI. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe are unlikely to change their combinations even if results have not gone their way.

India vs Zimbabwe 4th T20I Live Score: Mini preview

Team India will aim to seal yet another series win when Shubman Gill’s side faces Sikandar Raza’s Zimbabwe in the fourth T20I at the Harare Sports Club in Harare on Saturday.

Coming back from a 13-run defeat, India inflicted heavy losses for the visitors in the second and third T20Is as the batters regained their touch. Following a 100-run win in the second game, India pipped the hosts by 23 runs in the third game where skipper Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad shone with the bat.

Abhishek Sharma has 50 sixes already in 2024; can he cross the 100-mark by year-end?

Abhishek Sharma has had quite an entertaining first week in India colours in Harare. Stepping up to fill in the void left by giants Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, the dashing left-hander, just one T20I old, whipped up a 46-ball century in his second game in as many days.

The 23-year-old failed to sparkle in the other two knocks. However, Abhishek has not let go of the obsession to target the deep mid-wicket fence for sixes.

The Punjab and SRH batsman attempted a six on debut in that region but holed out for a duck. He went straightaway for another maximum and connected it in the first over in the second T20I. Batting with Travis Head in the IPL this year, Abhishek had not experienced a block in slam-bang batting, finishing with a strike rate above 200 throughout the season. READ MORE
