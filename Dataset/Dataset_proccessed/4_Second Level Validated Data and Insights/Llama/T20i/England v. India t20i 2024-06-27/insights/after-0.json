    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "We would have batted first, the weather looks good, whatever had to happen, it has already happened. We wanted to put runs on the board. The pitch tends to get slower as the game goes on. We understand the challenge of playing a tournament like this, a lot of travel and logistics. It's a chance to play some good cricket. We don't want to think too far ahead, stay in the moment and let your game do the talking. Same team for us,",
        "We'll bowl first. Looks like a good surface, the bounce will be low, with the rain around, we thought it'll be a bit of an advantage to bowl first. We're up against a great team, but we're peaking nicely and we are playing the same team today. Looking forward to a great challenge against a top side. Excited to be in a semi-final, but some of us have been here before,"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India certainly outplayed us. We let them get 20-25 runs too many. It was a challenging surface, they played well on. They fully deserved this win. Very different conditions (than 2022), credit to India. They played a very good game of cricket. With the rain around, didn't expect the conditions to change too much. Don't think it really did. They outbowled us. They had an above-par score. Don;t think toss was necessarily the difference between the teams. They've got some fantastic spinners. In hindsight, should have bowled Moeen in that innings with the way spin was bowling. We are really proud of everyone's effort. We stuck together, came up short when it mattered the most,"
