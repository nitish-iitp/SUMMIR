    "New Records": [
        "West Indies set a new unwanted record of 51 dot balls - the most any team has registered in a T20 World Cup when posting a score of at least 180"
    ],
    "Key Match Events": [
        "Phil Salt scored 87 not out, supplemented by an unbeaten 48 from Jonny Bairstow, saw England thrash West Indies by eight wickets",
        "Adil Rashid delivered the big wicket of Andre Russell",
        "Jofra Archer hammered a tight line across the left-hander, taking the edge through to Jos Buttler, Pooran presenting the face of the bat in defeat rather than defiance"
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Jos Buttler opted to chase at the toss",
        "Things looked precarious after eight overs, with West Indies getting 72 on the board for the loss of just Brandon King"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Phil Salt explained that once Jos got out, he had to be the better to bat through, and that Jonny Bairstow took the pressure off him by taking calculated risks",
        "Salt deserved the Player-of-the-Match award, but without Bairstow's help, he - and maybe even England - might not have had something to celebrate"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "West Indies were second-best when making use of this ground's lop-sided dimensions, failing to rotate the strike as much as they could, and running just nine twos across their 120 deliveries",
        "England ran three more in 15 fewer deliveries, and even managed a three in the fourth over when Buttler could not quite time a cut to the cover point sponge"
