        "England fast bowler Reece Topley believes the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground will turn into a “cauldron” when the two most successful Twenty20 (T20) sides meet in their Super Eight game on Wednesday.",
        "West Indies captain Rovman Powell believes there will be a sense of familiarity when both sides meet, given the frequency of their T20 clashes and, as happens in a bout, whichever team gets on top will look to “stay on top for as long as possible”.",
        "Powell was full of praise for his spinner Akael Hosein, who has picked up nine wickets in the tournament so far.",
        "You can see from the innings that Nicholas Pooran played, when good batters get set on a good wicket, it becomes difficult to come up with plans to stop them,” Powell said.",
        "Topley insists that England will be up for the challenge and want to show them their own brand of “good cricket”.",
        "Powell said that both teams know a lot about each other, and whoever gets on top will look to stay on top for as long as possible.",
        "Powell praised Akael Hosein's performance and hoped he can continue to do well.",
        "West Indies have been blessed with the power-hitting form of batter Nicholas Pooran, who is second on the tournament’s run-scoring chart and hit 53-ball-98 in the match against Afghanistan."

        "Wind will have a role to play in the game and both sides will look to use it to their advantage while bowling and batting.",
        "West Indies have been one of the strongest teams so far and are unlikely to change the side that beat Afghanistan in their last game.",
        "England are likely to field the same XI that brought them two important wins in their last two group games.",
