        "West Indies are fit, focused and firing on all cylinders. They come into this contest on an eight-match unbeaten run.",
        "England have floated down to St Lucia on a wave of exhalation. Whatever happens in their T20 World Cup defence from hereon in, their avoidance of a humiliating first-round exit might yet prove to be as much of a fillip as four rousing wins from four.",
        "England and West Indies are each competing for an unprecedented third T20 World Cup title, and the events at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground in Beausejour could go some way towards confirming the readiness, or otherwise, of these two very real contenders for the crown."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "This will be another outing for the belter of a surface on which West Indies racked up 218 for 5 against Afghanistan on Monday, so a high-scoring contest is in prospect.",
        "England and West Indies duked it out in an entertaining T20I series in December, with West Indies winning 3-2 thanks to a four-wicket win in the decider in Trinidad."
