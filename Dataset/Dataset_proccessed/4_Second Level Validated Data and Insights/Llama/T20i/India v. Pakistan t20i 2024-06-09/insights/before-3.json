        "The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York has produced quite a few low-scoring matches in the early stages of the T20 World Cup 2024, providing help to the fast bowlers and spinners alike.",

        "Pakistan batting lineup struggled massively against the USA bowling attack in their opening match of the T20 World Cup 2024, with only Shadab Khan managing to score an innings of substance at a decent strike-rate.",

    "Others": [

        "In the bowling side of things, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, and Hardik Pandya were the pick of the bowlers for India against the Irish, utilising the help in the pitch to their advantage.",
