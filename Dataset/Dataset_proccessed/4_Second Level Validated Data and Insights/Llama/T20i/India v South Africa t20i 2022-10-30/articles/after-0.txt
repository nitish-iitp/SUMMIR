India vs South Africa highlights, T20 World Cup 2022: Miller saw South Africa over the line

India vs South Africa highlights, T20 World Cup 2022: David Miller finished unbeaten on 59 off 46 as he saw South Africa over the line in their chase of a target of 134. Lungi Ngidi's searing four-wicket haul and the efforts of the rest of the South African pacers meant that India were off to a disastrous start batting first. However, Suryakumar Yadav's 68 off 40 balls almost single-handedly got India to 133/9. India then came out swinging with Arshdeep Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami keeping South Africa pinned. However, Aiden Markram and Miller stemmed the flow of wickets after the powerplay. The pair shifted gears after the first 10 overs and Markram eventually fell for 52 off 41. Miller finally saw South Africa over the line with two balls to spare.

T20 World Cup live score: Repercussions of this result

Well there are endless permutations one can take from here but what seems to be sure is that India have to beat Bangladesh by a fairly big margin in their last match so as to keep their net run rate above the rest of the chasing pack. That match is going to be played on Wednesday. We will see you then, good night!

India vs South Africa Live Score: Temba Bavuma speaks

"[On the discussion at the ten-over mark] It was try and up the intent. When you do that, opportunities come your way. Fortunately we got the momentum we needed. Our batting line-up is in good form, barring myself. It is a unit that has been together for sometime. [On their bowling] We were watching the games that were played here. Obviously it was risky but the variable bounce assisted us. We kept mid-off and mid-on up, which made us predictable but we backed ourselves. We came into the tournament as non-favourites and we will keep flying under the radar. We will keep improving and that's what we are doing."

IND vs SA T20 World Cup live score: Here is Rohit Sharma

"We expected the pitch to have something in it, with the weather around. We knew there will be help for the seamers. Which is why you saw that 130 was not an easy chase. I thought we fought well till the end but South Africa played well in the end. The pitch is such that the wicket can come any time for the seamers. It was a match-winning partnership from Miller and Markram. But we were not good enough on the field. We have played in such conditions so conditions are not an excuse. We want to be consistent in that department. We could not hold on to our chances, we misses a few run-outs including myself. [On that Ashwin over] I have seen what happened at the last with the spinners. So I wanted to finish with Ashwin before the last over. I wanted to see that the seamers bowl the right overs. Given the new batter came in, it was the perfect time for Ashwin to bowl."

T20 World Cup live score: Lungi Ngidi wins player of the match

He dismantled the Indian batting lineup and that is really the main reason why South Africa won this game. "It was very nerve-wracking. When games get so close, you cannot do much as a bowler but just sit. It is one of my biggest wins - to win an award at the World Cup. It comes down to watching a lot of games being played here. We have also played here earlier. We saw Pakistan bowl and it helped. Just after the ten-over break, Markram moved the game forward and Miller followed him."

T20 World Cup live score: South Africa need 6 to win off the last over!

Bhuvneshwar Kumar has come in to bowl the last over. He has not had a great time in this period of matches in the recent past and now, he needs to ensure that Parnell and Miller don't take six runs in six balls. Uphill struggle to say the least, you can cut the tension with a knife here. What a match this has turned out to be in chilly Perth.
