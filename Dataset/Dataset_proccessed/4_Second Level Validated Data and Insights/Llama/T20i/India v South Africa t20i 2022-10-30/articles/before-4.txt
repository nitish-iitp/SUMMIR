Titans Collide At Perth As India And South Africa Eye Pole Position In Group 2
29 Oct, 2022 By Editor

After a couple of successful conquests early in the T20 World Cup, Team India will be meeting the formidable Proteas who have been a phenomenal batting unit in the ongoing edition of the fray. In what you can call a clash of the titans, going by the context of the group, South Africa and India will be going claws and fangs at each other’s throat, hoping to secure the group ace.

India started the competition with a thrilling win against their arch-rivals Pakistan and backed it up with a clinical all-round display that laid waste to Netherlands in an askew contest. It was Virat Kohli pulling the strings of destruction again at Sydney alongside an on-song Suryakumar Yadav who left the opposition in flames.

Despite a couple of false starts, the Indian batting has seemed in fine shape, thanks to their top gun mavericks who have led by example, showcasing the mentality of true warriors. However, more than their batters, their bowlers who were heavily under fire before the tournament started have proved time and time again that they can be the game-changer as Bhuvneshwar Kumar leads the show.

South Africa have been a formidable batting unit as their scoring rate in the tournament ranges at a staggering 11 plus which makes this a perfect match between the willow men of the Rainbow Nation and the clinical Indian pacers who have made life difficult so far for the batters. Their bowling unit boasts of tantamount brilliance, featuring the prized quartet of Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Wayne Parnell, an earth-shattering menace on the pace-friendly surfaces of Australia.

Expect some unprecedented pyrotechnics as two of the finest teams in Group 2 take the yard, hoping to present you all with a crackerjack of a contest featuring an intense bout of pace and drift while the batters make it a point to bring out their class.

Venue Watch:

The Optus Stadium hasn’t played host to many T20Is so far and the average score batting first ranges at a modest 142 while the team chasing has so far averaged 141, thereby making this a uniform pervasion of torment for the batters. The highest score registered batting first at Optus is 208 by England while the highest score chased down so far has been 158.

Key Player Battles:

Virat Kohli vs Wayne Parnell: Virat has been poetic so far as his brilliance has gunned down the Falcon with extreme prejudice in the tournament opener while taking on the inexperienced Netherlands bowlers without much fuss. The last time these two sides met in a T20 World Cup, it was Virat Kohli, the chase master who silenced a prime Dale Steyn. After a gap of 8 long years, you may be in for another episode of the King’s reign. Wayne Parnell’s comeback to the national team has been the stuff of folklore and ever since his return, he has been quite a menace for the batters. He has some sharp drift in his arsenal and with the pitch being slightly inclined towards the bowlers, he would be trying to target that corridor of uncertainty on the off-stump, angling away the cherry from Virat.

Suryakumar Yadav vs Kagiso Rabada: Another incredible battle to witness in the upcoming contest will be India’s in-form SKY whose 360-degree approach has left the bowlers scratching their heads while Kagiso Rabada’s lethal use of those chin-rattling bumpers can be a perfect match for Surya’s constant shuffle inside the crease. Rabada also has a menacing yorker while Surya is exceptionally good at producing the flick or the scoop whenever someone has attempted to target that block. Only time will tell, who shall prevail in this interesting contest of wit and speed.

Quinton de Kock vs Bhuvneshwar Kumar: This would be the bloodiest exchange of haymakers as roaring QDK who is South Africa’s highest run scorer in the ongoing tournament with 110 runs will be taking on Bhuvi Kumar who has already been India’s trump card in the powerplay. Drifting the ball by the proverbial mile in both directions, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has challenged the authority of the batters who have tried to make some early inroads for themselves. QDK has brought out his big guns, targeting the field restrictions in the powerplay. Even though South Africa is yet to meet a major opposition, seeing this duel of the Protean wicket-keeper and the Indian fast-bowling ace will be a treat for sore eyes.
