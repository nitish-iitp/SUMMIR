Australia vs Afghanistan, T20 World Cup, Super 12 Highlights: Afghanistan put up a spirited display but they went down by four runs against Australia in the T20 World Cup Super 12 match at the Adelaide Oval. Rashid Khan played an unbeaten knock of 48 off 23 balls, but it was not enough to take Afghanistan over the line. Earlier, Glenn Maxwell played a knock of 54 as he guided Australia to 168/8 in 20 overs. Mitchell Marsh was going well, but his innings was cut short and he departed after scoring 45. Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis seem to be putting a good partnership in the middle before the latter was removed by Rashid Khan. Earlier, Cameron Green, David Warner and Steve Smith lost their wickets inside the powerplay after Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi won the toss and opted to bowl first. (SCORECARD)

Right then, Group 1 has taken shape with New Zealand becoming the first team to qualify for the semi-finals. They will be joined by either England or Australia with all eyes on the game between Sri Lanka and England as we move to Sydney for the action. A win for England sends them to the knockout stages but if they lose, Australia will find themselves alive in the competition. That game will start at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT) on Saturday 5th of November. As you all know, you can join us early for the build-up. Till then, it's goodbye and cheers!

!

Matthew Wade the skipper of Australia says that he had planned to finish the quota of other bowlers first and give Marcus Stoinis the final over. Shares that it was nerve-wracking and had seen Rashid Khan win such games 3-4 times in the Indian T20 league. Says that they will be staying in Adelaide for one extra night and will hope for an upset tomorrow night. Adds that the tournament hasn't gone their way and they were slow to get off the blocks. Ends by informing that they are hopeful for the return of Aaron Finch and Tim David in the next game if they progress further.

!

Mohammad Nabi the captain of Afghanistan says that it was a good game. Adds that they started off well and played really well. Credits Naveen-ul-Haq for bowling well and restricting the Australians to a chaseable total. Further says that it wasn't a huge total on this pitch but they threw their wickets away quickly in the middle order and they came under pressure. Ends by saying that they are improving and it was a fantastic game of cricket.

!

Glenn Maxwell is the Player of the Match for his knock of 54(32). He says that Afghanistan played really well and struck the ball cleanly. Adds that Afghanistan put them under pressure in the Powerplay and gave them a scare toward the end. Mentions that it is nice to have an impact with the run out. Shares that it skidded on during the second innings. Also shares that the wicket was slow during the day and it was during the 12th over that they decided to get a move on. Credits Afghanistan for the way they bowled in the last four overs. Ends by saying that he will be following tomorrow's game between Sri Lanka and England and hopes that Sri Lanka can do the job for them.

Time for the presentation...

!

Earlier, Australia kept up with their aggressive approach scoring runs briskly from the word go. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals, which probably resulted in them scoring 10-15 runs lesser than what they would have liked. Glenn Maxwell scored a fine half-century and was supported by Mitchell Marsh who fell five runs short of his fifty. The pace bowlers for Afghanistan were good with Naveen-ul-Haq picking three wickets and Fazalhaq Farooqi chipping in with two of his own. Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman contributed with one wicket each but their batting collapse in the middle overs made it all for nothing.

!

Australia struck early courtesy of Josh Hazlewood but they could not restrict their opponents from scoring freely. Kane Richardson dismissed Rahmanullah Gurbaz after a catch was dropped off his own bowling to get Australia firmly on top of the game. They were unable to get a breakthrough after that for a  period of time and with the Afghan batters starting to score freely, there was an anticipation of an upset on the cards. Glenn Maxwell ensured that it would not be the case with an outstanding direct hit from the deep to break the partnership and initiated a steady flow of wickets. They will be slightly disappointed that they were unable to wrap up the inning early, allowing their opponents to almost overcome the target but they have sealed a crucial win. Adam Zampa and Josh Hazlewood took two wickets each and Kane Richardson contributed claiming one.

!

Afghanistan were looking to get off to a positive start but lost Usman Ghani early.  Rahmanullah Gurbaz continued his onslaught from the other end scoring a quickfire 30 and keeping his team in the hunt. He was dismissed in the Powerplay though after which Ibrahim Zadran and Gulbadin Naib started building a partnership to steady the ship. They put on a 59-run partnership and were just getting a move on when a brilliant piece of fielding caused the dismissal of Gulbadin Naib. Ibrahim Zadran departed on the very next ball causing the batting order to crumble. They lost 4 wickets for 4 runs and suddenly found themselves really far behind in the game. They did go past the 106-run mark which meant that Australia could not go ahead of England’s net-run rate. Rashid Khan played a fighting cameo towards the end scoring 48 in just 23 balls to get his team agonizingly close to the target.

!

Rashid Khan and the Afghans have put on quite a fight here but have sadly fallen just short of the finish line! The Australians did have quite a scare but their quality eventually came through and they sealed a 4-run win to go second in the Group 1 standings. They are still behind England in terms of net run rate but the equation for them is simple. They need Sri Lanka to beat England and if that happens, they are through to the semi-finals of the 2022 ICC Men’s World Cup.
