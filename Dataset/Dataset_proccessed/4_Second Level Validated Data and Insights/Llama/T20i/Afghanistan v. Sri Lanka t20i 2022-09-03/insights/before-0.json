        "Chris Silverwood's focus is on bringing back Sri Lanka to their refreshing approach to white-ball cricket that revolutionised the ODI game in the 1990s",
        "Afghanistan have proved they're giant killers no more. UAE conditions are as good as home conditions. Most players are residents here, and train and play all year round on pitches such as these, and in weather far more oppressive",
        "Afghanistan have the edge but having just about stopped the door from shutting them out of their own party, they will now want to barge it open"

        "The surface in Sharjah will be the same as the Pakistan v Hong Kong game. There is likely to be some rough patches and dry spots that could aid the spinners",

    "Others": [
        "Sri Lanka can breathe easy. Or can they?",
        "Does the current line-up have the confidence to take on bowling straightaway?",
        "Can Fazalhaq Farooqi repeat his Group B performance?",
        "Rahmanullah Gurbaz was given out on zero in the Asia Cup opener but overturned the lbw call on review and went on to take Sri Lanka's attack to the cleaners by making an 18-ball 40 in a low-key chase",
        "Hazratullah Zazai and Gurbaz are the second-most prolific pair for Afghanistan in T20Is. They have eight fifty-run stands in just 21 innings together, including a 37-ball 83 against Sri Lanka last week",
        "In 13 T20Is this year, Sri Lanka have conceded runs at 8.21 during the powerplay at an average of 42.73"
