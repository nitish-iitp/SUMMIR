Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. We have two more games coming up in less than 12 hours at the T20 World Cup. The first game will see England taking on Scotland in Barbados on Tuesday, 4th June at 8.00 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT). The second contest of the day will have Nepal facing on Netherlands in Dallas. That game will start at 9.00 pm IST (3.30 pm GMT). But you can join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care and cheers!

!

Rashid Khan, the captain of Afghanistan says that this is the kind of start they wanted as a team and it is all about the mindset and applauds the openers and then praises the bowling as well. On captaincy, he says that it was a proud moment and reckons that it is about keeping things simple and giving his hundred percent. Adds that they have multiple options in different phases of play and if someone isn't having a good day, he can turn to others and even the batters and all-rounders, who make a lot of difference in T20 cricket. Mentions that the ODI World Cup last year has given them the belief to beat any team and it is all about what they are doing and ends by saying that against New Zealand it is a big game and want to keep things simple and give it their best as a team.

!

Brian Masaba, the skipper of Uganda says that it was pretty special to see their flag and the national anthem at the World Cup. Shares that they had a lot of nerves going into the first game and will be better prepared for their next challenge. Mentions that Afghanistan got a pretty good start but credits his team on how they came back. Launds Afghanistan on their bowling and adds that they are a quality side. Ends by sharing that the team is hoping to bounce back in their next game against PNG.

!

Fazalhaq Farooqi is the Player of the Match for his stellar five-wicket haul. He starts by thanking the Almighty and says that he has missed the hat trick a few times and will try to get it in the future. Adds that he tried to bowl a few balls into the wicket but then he tried to get used to the swing and later on tried to bowl the slower ones. Mentions that playing franchise cricket helps your overall game and you don't feel much pressure on the big stage.

Presentation Time....

!

Earlier in the game, Afghanistan were sent into bat first and they made 183 for 5 on the back of attacking 70s from Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz. The middle order could not keep the momentum once the openers were gone and they finished 20-30 runs short of the expected score. Cosmos Kyewuta and skipper Brian Masaba were the pick of the Ugandan bowlers as they snapped two wickets each and bowled economically. Uganda came back brilliantly with the ball but were not in the contest at all with the bat. They will hope to take the positives from this game and more forward in the competition.

!

A comprehensive win for Afghanistan as they trump Uganda by 125 runs and start their campaign with a big win. Chasing 184 for the win, Uganda were in all sorts of trouble from the start as they were reduced to 18 for 5 inside the first five overs. Riazat Ali Shan and Robinson Obuya hung around for a while but once they were dismissed, the lower order fell like a pack of cards and Uganda were bundled out for just 58. For Afghanistan, Fazalhaq Farooqi was the star of the show with 5 wickets for 9 runs in his spell. He broke the back of Ugandan batting and bowled splendidly. Rashid Khan and Naveen-ul-Haq chipped in with a couple while Mujeeb-Ur-Rahman took a solitary wicket. Afghanistan will be mightly pleased with this win and it gives a massive boost to their net run rate.

RASHID KHAN TO HENRY SSENYONDO

OUT! TIMBER! Rashid Khan wraps up proceedings with a double whammy and Uganda are bundled out for just 58 runs here. Quicker through the air, floated up a bit fuller and around off stump. It is another googly from Rashid and the ball turns back in sharply. Henry Ssenyondo looks to defend off the front foot but the ball goes between bat and pad to castle into the stumps and Afghanistan beat Uganda by a massive 125 runs.

!

Henry Ssenyondo is the last man in for Uganda.

RASHID KHAN TO BILAL HASSAN

OUT! LBW! Bilal Hassan is hit on the pads for the upteenth time and the finger goes up for LBW. Rashid Khan just drags the length back, bowling it flatter around off and gets the googly to turn back in. Bilal goes for the reverse swep but misses and gets hit flush on the pads. Bilal does review it but there;s nothing on UltraEdge and Ball Tracking shows three reds. Finally, Rashid is able to see the back of Bilal here.

RASHID KHAN TO BILAL HASSAN

Excellent review! Looks dead straight but it has been reviewed immediately by Bilal Hassan. Quick and full from Rashid Khan and this is bowled on off stump. Bilal looks to block tentatively and gets hit on the pads. A huge appeal and the finger goes up. UltraEdge though shows that there was an outside edge and the onfield call is reversed.

FAZALHAQ FAROOQI TO BILAL HASSAN

Oh, dear! How has that missed the stumps? Takes pace off and bowls it on a fullish length on middle and leg. It is the cutter that stays low and goes an inch or so over the leg stump as Bilal Hassan misses the heave on the leg side once again.

Goes full again but aims this one right at the stumps and gets it in the blockhole, Bilal Hassan does well to jam it back to the bowler.
