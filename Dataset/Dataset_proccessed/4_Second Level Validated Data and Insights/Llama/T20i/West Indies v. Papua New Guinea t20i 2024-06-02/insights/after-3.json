        "Rovman Powell, the victorious skipper of West Indies is up for a chat. He starts by appreciating PNG for the way they played.

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Papua New Guinea, on the other hand, should be extremely pleased with their bowling effort as they pushed the Windies to their limits. Alei Nao was brilliant with the new ball and bowled a wicket-maiden first and should have had Nicholas Pooran as well."
