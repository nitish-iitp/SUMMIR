        "West Indies are well covered in all departments with several all-rounders and big-hitters, capable of swinging games, adding to their x-factor.",
        "The surprise inclusion in their squad for the tournament was Shamar Joseph, uncapped in T20Is until featuring against South Africa recently, but clearly a supreme talent in the making.",
        "New Zealand made very little change from the 2022 edition to this one with their squad selection, highlighting the consistency in selection on the one hand, and also how well-rounded the Blackcaps unit is.",
        "The team are also well prepared for the event with 36 T20Is under their belt since the end of the last T20 World Cup, the most among full-member teams."

        "West Indies also get a fairly easier start to the tournament with games against the lower-ranked teams in the group, PNG and Uganda. If they start well, the co-hosts will be favourites to top the group."
