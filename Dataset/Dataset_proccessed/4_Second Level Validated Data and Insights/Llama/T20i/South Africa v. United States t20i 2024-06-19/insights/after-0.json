        "Aiden Markram said he would have bowled first too but also wasn't sure exactly what to do",
        "South Africa have gone in with two spinners which means Ottneil Baartman, who was talked up less than 15 minutes ago on this blog, has been left out",

        "South Africa's previous highest PP score at the tournament was 38 against Nepal",
        "They've done far better than that this time and it was largely thanks to this 28-run over from Jessy Singh that included a no-ball six!"
