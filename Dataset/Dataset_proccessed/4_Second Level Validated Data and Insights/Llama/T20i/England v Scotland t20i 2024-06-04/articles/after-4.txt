Rain denies Scotland and England as Group B grudge match abandoned
Neighbours Scotland and England saw their first-ever Men’s T20I abandoned after just ten overs of play, with the two teams. sharing the points from their Group B meeting at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in a damp Bridgetown.

England v Scotland, Match Scorecard

Scotland made 90/0 in a rain-shortened 10-over innings, but the game in Barbados was abandoned after further rain.

It was Scotland who won the toss, with captain Richie Berrington opting to bat first in Barbados against an England line-up packed with pace options.

A brief rain shower delayed the start of play by 30 minutes before England's bowlers got the game underway at an overcast Kensington Oval. But a second and heavier rain delay brought the match to a halt with Scotland 51/0 after 6.2 overs, forcing the game to be reduced to ten overs per side.

And a third rain delay, after Scotland had reached 90/0 from their ten overs, meant that the match was called off with no result possible.

Scotland openers let loose

The fans at the Kensington Oval were at least treated to one shortened innings, and England thought they had an early breakthrough when George Munsey was hurried by a Mark Wood delivery and top-edged a high catch to a back-tracking Jos Buttler. But the sound of the siren indicated a no-ball and offered Munsey a reprieve.

Mark Wood had George Munsey caught only for the delivery to be called a no-ball in the Group clash of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.

And Michael Jones continued to swing momentum in Scotland’s favour before the second rain delay, launching a huge six into the roof of the Kensington Oval to help take Chris Jordan’s first over for 15 runs.

Scotland's Michael Jones whacked a huge six onto the roof of the Kensington Oval in the clash against England.

The game had been reduced to a 10-over contest upon its resumption, with Jofra Archer and Wood bowled out, and Jordan having just one over remaining when England's attack resumed at a damp Bridgetown.

But, one expensive Adil Rashid over aside, England did well to keep a tricky mini-session under control as Scotland finished on 90/0 after ten overs, with Jones hitting 45(30) and Munsey ending on 41(31).

The adjusted target left England’s batters requiring 109 to win, only for the rain to return before Buttler's side could even begin their chase.

Scotland's George Munsey unfurled a remarkable reverse hit off Adil Rashid to send the ball into the stands in the rain-shortened game against England.

Buttler’s England are defending champions and have the boost of including a fit-again Jofra Archer in their squad for the tournament, with their next game coming on Saturday against Australia at the same venue.

England have never beaten a European side at a Men’s T20 World Cup, and the rain ensured that record continued in Barbados. But Scotland will be rueing a missed opportunity to defend their decent total, and will hope to get a win on the board when they face Namibia on Thursday.
