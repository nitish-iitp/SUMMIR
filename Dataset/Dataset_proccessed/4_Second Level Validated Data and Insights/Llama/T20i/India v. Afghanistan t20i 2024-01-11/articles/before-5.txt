Rashid Khan last played in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India.

India and Afghanistan are all set to clash in the first of the three-match T20I series which will be played in Mohali on January 11, 2024. Ahead of the opening encounter, Afghanistan captain Ibrahim Zadran announced that ace spinner Rashid Khan will not be participating in any of the three matches.

Rashid Khan underwent lower back surgery after the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. He has since missed the BBL 2023-24 and will miss the upcoming SA20 as well. Rashid Khan hasn’t played a competitive game since the ODI World Cup in October-November, and he missed Afghanistan’s most recent match, a 2-1 T20I series victory over the UAE at the turn of the year.

The 25-year-old traveled to Chandigarh with the team and even rolled his arm during training sessions during the last couple of days. 

However, on the eve of the series opener, Afghanistan skipper Ibrahim Zadran said that the great spinner is healing and will take some time to be available for selection.  

“He is not totally fit but is traveling with the team. We hope that he gets fit as soon as we expect him to. He’s doing his rehab with the doctor, and we will miss him in the series,” Zadran was quoted as saying by PTI.

“Without Rashid Khan, we will struggle”- Ibrahim Zadran

The captain, however, believed that even without Rashid, there was enough firepower in his team.

In Rashid Khan’s absence, Afghanistan’s spin workload in India will be shared between Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Mohammad Nabi, Noor Ahmad, Qais Ahmad, and Sharafuddin Ashraf. Qais, who has taken on Afghanistan’s leg spin role in Rashid’s absence, took the most wickets in the UAE series, with six at an average of 11.16 and an economy rate of 6.70.

“Without Rashid, there are a few players that we have trust in. I can say, they will play good cricket. Others have also played a lot of cricket and I am sure they will perform well. Without Rashid, we will struggle because his experience is crucial to all of us, but this is cricket and you need to be ready for any kind of situation.

Nabi is the most senior guy in our team and he should play. He has lots of experience,” Zadran added.

The three-match T20I series will begin on Thursday in Mohali. Indore and Bangalore will host the second and third T20Is on January 14 and 17.
