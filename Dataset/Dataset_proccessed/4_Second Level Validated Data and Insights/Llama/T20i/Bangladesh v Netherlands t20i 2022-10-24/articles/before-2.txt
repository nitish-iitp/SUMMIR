BAN vs NED Dream11 Prediction Team & Fantasy Tips

The 17th game of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 will have Bangladesh (BAN) taking on the Netherlands (NED) at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Monday, October 24. Ahead of the match, here's everything you need to know about the BAN vs NED 2022 Dream11 prediction.

Bangladesh begin their ICC T20 World Cup campaign against the Netherlands, who have to take the longer route to the Super 12. Netherlands impressed against Namibia and UAE, holding their nerve in crunch moments.

While they will fancy their chances of a win, the Netherlands will be wary of what Bangladesh is capable of in this format. Led by Shakib al Hasan, Bangladesh have a well-balanced squad with a good mixture of youth and experience. All in all, a cracking game of cricket beckons in Hobart with two valuable points up for grabs.
