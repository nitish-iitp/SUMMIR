India's batsmen, Hardik, Rahul, and Suryakumar did their utmost to push the team to a large score, but the bowlers fell short during the powerplay and in the dying stages. Bhuvneshwar Kumar conceded 52 runs, while Harshal leaked 49.

India became the first team to fail to defend 200-plus totals in T20Is at home more than once in a calendar year. They are also only the second team after South Africa in 2016 among full members of the ICC to end up on losing side despite posting 200 or more on the board.

"I don't think we bowled well. 200 is a good score to defend, and we didn't take our chances on the field. It was a great effort from our batters, but the bowlers were not quite there. There are things we need to look at, but it was a great game for us to understand what went wrong. We know this is a high-scoring ground. You can't relax even if you get 200. We took wickets to an extent, but they played really well," Rohit said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Rohit further praised Hardik for his super 71-run knock while adding that Indian team management will need to look at the bowling woes before the second T20I.

"They played some extraordinary shots. If I was in that changing room, I would expect to chase that total. You can back yourself to get 60 runs in the final 4 overs. We were not able to take that extra wicket. That was the turning point. If we had taken another wicket, things would have been different. You can't score 200 every day, you need to bat well. Hardik batted really well to get us there. We need to look at our bowling before the next game," Rohit added.
