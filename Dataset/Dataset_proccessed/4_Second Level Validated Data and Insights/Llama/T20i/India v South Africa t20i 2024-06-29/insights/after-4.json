    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Rohit Sharma: 'Hard to sum up what we've been through in last three-four years. A lot behind the scenes, not what we did today, it's what we did before. A lot of high-pressure games, and we've been on the wrong side of it. Guys understand when the pressure is on what needs to be done, today was perfect example, stuck together with backs to the wall. We wanted this really bad, a lot of mind needs to come together, very proud of the bunch of boys and the management, giving us the liberty to play and that trust.'",
        "Aiden Markram: 'Gutted for the time being, it'll take some time to reflect on a really good campaign, hurts quite a bit but incredibly proud. We bowled well, not a lot to work with, it was a chaseable total, batted well, came down to the wire, gutted not to get over the line. It's not over til the last ball is over, we never got comfortable, things happen quickly at the back end, but got into a great position to prove we were worthy finalists. South Africans are competitive, respectful and will go down with a fight. It's still a proud moment for us.'"
