But it was also a 17 runs victory built on a match winning spell of left arm spin from Akeal Hosein who took 4-24 and ripped the guts from England’s reply as they tried to chase down the hosts’ 179-4 under lights.

Holder’s last over heroics – becoming the fourth man to achieve the feat in a T20 international – secured a famous victory and sent Kensington Oval into a frenzy.

Victory proved beyond an England side light on experience and unable to replicate some astonishing six hitting from Kieron Pollard’s side.

Since losing to India at home in 2018, England had lost one in 11 bilateral T20 series, in India in 2020-21.

And while this has been a largely developmental England side missing many of its brightest stars, it had enough, winning two matches but missing out when it mattered.

Defeat has exposed some areas which need attention just nine months out from the T20 World Cup, not least their death bowling.

This series decider was played on the same pitch on which Rovman Powell had run riot on Wednesday.

And with chasing having proved beyond both sides since the low-scoring opener – pitches taking more spin under lights – it was no surprise Kieron Pollard chose to bat.

The West Indies innings was two paced starting brightly, grinding to a half when Moeen Ali turned to spin, then accelerated with a late burst when the seamers came back on.

It followed the pattern of the series with West Indies not trusting themselves against slow bowling – last night they were 4-54 against spin.

In contrast when there is pace on they are brutal with just five wickets going to seamers and at a significant cost of 503 runs in total.

The 10 overs from the end of the powerplay to the 16th over produced just three boundaries.

West Indies did hit 66 off their last 24 balls, Powell doing most of the damage again with 35 in 17 balls and four sixes.

England’s reply got off to a bad start with Jason Roy caught off his boot in front of the wicket by wicketkeeper Nicholas Pooran and Tom Banton miscuing Odean Smith to midwicket.

The miss turned out to be no bad thing with the England captain unable to replicate his form from Saturday, posting a stodgy 14 off 19 balls before picking out Holder again.

James Vince kept them in touch but departed for 55 with England needing 68 from 39 balls, an equation that became 20 off the last over.

Holder held his nerve in style to join Lasith Malinga, Rashid Khan and Ireland’s Curtis Campher as only the fourth man with four in four, killing off England’s hopes in a hail of wickets.
