        "The defending champions Australia were humbled by the Kiwis in the opening game but they came back strongly against Lankans.",
        "David Warner has not yet found his groove while Aaron Finch continues to struggle with his timing and fluency.",
        "The rollicking duo of Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell has also not been able to kick on so far and the Aussies will need their top 4 to fire against a strong unit like England.",
        "On the bowling front, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc have bowled well but the form of Pat Cummins in T20Is has been a concern for some time now.",
        "Their opponents England are coming into this game on the back of a heartbreak against Ireland.",
        "The bowling has been pretty good from the English though and especially the presence of the extreme pace of Mark Wood provides them with the edge over their opponents.",
        "Jos Buttler also mentioned before the World Cup that he would like to give Ben Stokes as much responsibility as possible and that can be seen by the way he is been given a new ball in both games."

        "The rain delayed the toss of England vs Australia Group 1 match and eventually forced the game to be called off.",
        "England and Australia thus shared a point each.",
        "England and Australia both have three points each to their credit now but a better net run rate sees England take the second spot in Group 1 and Australia the number four."

    "Others": [
        "The pitch in Melbourne has been quite spicy in this World Cup so far and with these two teams fighting it out in the middle, the action is bound to get spicier.",
        "The form of Marcus Stoinis though would be pleasing for the team management but it is high time that the batting department fire as a unit.",
        "Aussie fans would hope to see Adam Zampa back in the XI even though Ashton Agar did a pretty good job in his absence.",
        "The race for those semifinal spots in this T20 World Cup Down Under is surely heating up and we are now ready for the game whose result will potentially go a long way in nailing down the top 2 spots in Group 1."
