Sri Lanka vs West Indies 2nd T20I LIVE:

Hello and welcome to our coverage of the 2nd T20I between Sri Lanka and the West Indies from the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla on Tuesday.

The two-time T20 World Champions were in fine form as they crushed the Lankan Lions in the series opener on Sunday with a win by five wickets.

The host’s bowling unit could do much better by delivering some key wickets in the powerplay, which ended up being their downfall on the previous game.

Expect the conditions in Dambulla to be nice and cool with very low chances of rain. Temperatures will be at around 26 degrees Celsius but at around 90 per cent humidity.

Squads:

West Indies Squad: Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Shai Hope(w), Roston Chase, Rovman Powell(c), Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd, Shamar Springer, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Shamar Joseph, Terrance Hinds, Andre Fletcher, Alick Athanaze, Fabian Allen

Sri Lanka Squad: Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis(w), Kusal Perera, Kamindu Mendis, Charith Asalanka(c), Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamindu Wickramasinghe, Maheesh Theekshana, Matheesha Pathirana, Asitha Fernando, Dinesh Chandimal, Binura Fernando, Jeffrey Vandersay, Avishka Fernando, Dunith Wellalage, Nuwan Thushara

Charith Asalanka says it’s an important win for them. The toss was very important and he’s happy he won the toss. Adds 160 would have been a par score and the openers set the tone for them. Credits the way Dunith Wellalage played. Ends by saying he wants to win the series.

Rovman Powell says they did well to keep them down to 160. Adds the wicket wasn’t at its best and Sri Lanka used it to their advantage. Mentions they have an opportunity to reflect on their mistakes and do well in the next game. Ends by saying he’s looking forward to the decider.

Pathum Nissanka, MAN OF THE MATCH, he says he had a special plan when he played the spin bowlers. Adds he had a target in mind.

Earlier in day, after winning the toss and elected to bat, Lanka were off to a good start courtesy their openers. Pathum Nissanka was the star with a half ton. However, Lanka didn’t have the finish they would have liked and finished with a score just above 160 but that proved to be enough by some margin.

For West Indies, they just couldn’t cope up with the turn and bounce the Sri Lankan batters were getting. They just never got off the blocks. Just the one batter touched the 20-run mark and that speaks volumes about their struggles with the bat in this game. They were bowled out for their 4th lowest total in T20Is.

A thumping win then for Lanka to level the series! Their spinners have spun a web around the West Indian batters. It was Dunith Wellalage who began things as he got King and after that, wickets just kept falling. Theekshana too joined the party and so did Asalanka and Hasaranga. Matheesha Pathirana also got a wicket to his name at the end. Overall, it was an outstanding performance from the hosts.
