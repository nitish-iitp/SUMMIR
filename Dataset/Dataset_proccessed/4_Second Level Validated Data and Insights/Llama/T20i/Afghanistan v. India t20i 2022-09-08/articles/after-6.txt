India rested captain Rohit Sharma for their final Super 4 match against Afghanistan at Asia Cup 2022 in Dubai on Thursday, September 8. India made as many as 3 changes for the dead rubber in Dubai after having been knocked out of the race to the final of the continental tournament.

KL Rahul walked out for the toss as stand-in captain but India's poor luck continued as Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi won the toss and opted to field. Teams chasing have won the majority of the matches in Dubai and India's losses against Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the Super 4 stage.

KL Rahul confirmed at the toss that Rohit Sharma wanted to take a rest, considering the tough conditions in the UAE and the busy schedule in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup wherein India will play 3 T20Is against Australia and 3 T20Is against South Africa from September 20 to October 4.

"Rohit just wants to take a break considering the tough conditions here, and the World Cup ahead. We're trying to finalise the roles that each individual will play in the World Cup," Rahul told the broadcasters after losing the toss.

India also rested leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and all-rounder Hardik Pandya and brought in Axar Patel and fast bowler Deepak Chahar, who was added to the squad after Avesh Khan was ruled out due to illness.

Wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik, who was not picked for the Super 4 matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, returned to the XI. He will be in the XI along with Rishabh Pant for the second time in the continental tournament.
