Righto, time for me to knock this one on the head. Andy Bull’s report from the Nassau stadium will be along shortly. Thanks for all your comments and fine company – lovely to hear from plenty of new OBOers scattered around the globe. We’ll be back soon to bring you more action, til then – goodbye!

Rohit Sharma has the air of a man who knows his side got away with a big one there:

We didn’t bat well enough. I thought halfway through that we were in a good position, you expect guys to stitch partnerships together. We were 15-20 runs short, and every run matters. Nevertheless the bowlers did the job. It was a good wicket compared to the one we played on here (against Ireland).

There’s a never-say-die attitude in the team. We wanted to make early inroads but we didn’t. At the halfway stage we got together and said if things can happen to us, they can happen to them too.

The little contributions from everyone make the difference. Whoever has the ball wants to make the difference. Bumrah is going from strength to strength. I’m not going to talk too much about him, we want him to be in that kind of mindset till the end of this World Cup, he’s a genius with the ball.

The crowd was superb, they never disappoint, wherever we play in the world, they come out in huge numbers and support us. They’ll be going home with a big smile on their face as well. It’s just the start of the tournament, we have a long way to go.”

Meanwhile – ICYMI – Scotland have breezed past Oman and really set English nerves on edge. A great win for them against a tricky Oman side – Brandon McMullen playing a blinder to score 61* off just 31 balls to see the Scots home by 41 runs.

That does their run rate the world of good and piles plenty of misery and pressure on England. It feels like another disastrous World Cup Campaign in the offing for Messrs Buttler and Mott. That sound? An array of knives being sharpened.

Scotland beat Oman emphatically by seven wickets in 13.1 overs 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

Babar Azam speaks: He’ll rue that one in years to come. His side will feel they slipped up massively on the biggest stage.

I think they bowled well after ten overs. We were chasing 120 and we were a run a ball for the first 10 overs but back to back wickets and we left too much to do in the end.

Our tactics were simple, play normally, rotate strike, score five or six an over. We had too many dot balls, the pressure was on us, and we lost three quick wickets. We have not capitalised properly, the pitch looked decent and the ball was coming on nicely. It was a little bit slow and some balls are bouncing a bit more, but you expect that with a drop-in pitch.”

Bumrah is Player of the Match: He took 3-14 and snuffed out Pakistan’s hopes.

It feels really good! We felt we were a little under par (with the bat), and when the sun came out, the wicket got a little better, so we had to be really disciplined. I tried to keep it simple, tried to hit the seam as much as I can, focus on my execution.

On the crowd:

It felt like we were in India, and the cheering is really appreciated, we were really happy with the support we got, it gave us a lot of energy. We’re focused on the now. We’ve played two games and played very good cricket. We’ll stick to our processes, and come out and try our best.”

It’s been a very exciting World Cup so far, it feels like there are plenty more stories to come too…

For those focussed on New York, Scotland have just chased 151 against Oman in 13.1 overs. They have five points, the maximum England can reach, and have given their net run rate a big boost too. It's now probable that neither of the 2022 finalists makes it through the group stage

— Ben Gardner (@Ben_Wisden) June 9, 2024

We're about three pretty plausible results away from one of the US or Scotland reaching the semis of this World Cup.

India win by six runs!

India pull it off! What a bowling performance from them. Fantastic game, Pakistan will rue their batting approach massively – they left themselves with too much to do at the end, a braver approach might have seen them get the win before the game went down to the wire.

Naseem Shah is in tears as he walks off, he got his side close there at the end but simply had too much to do. The Rizwan and Zaman wickets felt like the turning point in Pakistan’s innings. Hardik Pandya bowled very well in the middle overs and Jasprit Bumrah was nearly impossible to get away on a sticky wicket. His penultimate over was a killer, going for just three runs.

Pakistan were 57-0 after ten overs but fell away in the second ten. Losing wickets steadily and failing to find the run a ball needed. 120 is the smallest total that India have defended in T20I and also the lowest target that Pakistan have failed to chase. It was there for Pakistan but their campaign now lies in tatters.

19.5 overs: 12 needed off two balls… Naseem splices away for a four, too little too late unless there is a no-ball. Pakistan need 8 from 1 ball.

WICKET! Imad Wasim c †Pant b Arshdeep Singh 15 (102-7)

Imad is caught behind off the first ball of the last over. I’ll ball-by-ball this from here. Why not. I feel alive!

21.35 CEST

19th over: Pakistan 102-6 (Imad 15) What an over from Bumrah – a wicket and just three runs off it.

Pakistan need 18 from six balls. A big big big ask.

Shaheen Shah Afridi comes out the to the middle with his long handle.

WICKET! Iftikhar Ahmed c Arshdeep Singh b Bumrah 5 (Pakistan 102-6)

Nearly a collision in the field but Arshdeep holds on to a swirling catch safely and the Indian crowd are in raptures.

21.31 CEST

Bumrah bowls his cutter and a slower bouncer. Both end in dots. Hssssss goes the pressure cooker. Swing and a miss from Iftikhar! Dots are deadly for Pakistan. A knee-roll high full bunger is miss-hit into the leg side and brings a single.

21.28 CEST

Here comes Jasprit Bumrah with the penultimate over. Great atmosphere, fantastic spectacle. Time for a hero.

21.27 CEST

18th over: Pakistan 99-5 (Imad 13, Iftikhar 5) Siraj to bowl the eighteenth. I reckon Bumrah will have the next. A single to Imad Wasim. Siraj then bowls a dot but over steps! FREE HIT. Pakistan get two runs off the freebie, bit of a cardinal sin their from Siraj in the circumstances. Iftikhar Ahmed is the new batter, he chops to backward point for a single. Siraj sends down a wide down the leg side, signs of nerves from him too in this over. Every bonus run is succour for Pakistan here.

Nine off the over in total – 21 needed from 12 balls for Pakistan.

21.21 CEST

17th over: Pakistan 90-5 (Imad 10, Iftikhar 1) Pakistan are slipping under. Just five runs off Pandya’s over and the wicket. 30 needed from 18 balls. Jasprit Bumrah will bowl six of them – it’s just a case of when.

21.18 CEST
WICKET! Shadab Khan c Pant b Pandya 4 (Pakistan 88-5)

Another one goes! Shadab goes down the leg side and is followed by Pandya -the batter takes the short ball on but gets only a top edge, Pant scooching round to take the catch. Pandya has his second wicket, he’s come up with the goods today once more. We’re going down to the wire aren’t we? Way down in the hole.

9 Jun 2024
21.15 CEST

16th over: Pakistan 85-4 Imad 7, Shadab 1) Pakistan starting to stare into the pressure cooker. Just a couple of singles off Axar Patel.

35 needed from 24 balls. Bumrah is being kept on ice for the time being, Hardik will bowl the next. Maybe a bit of calculated risk taking from Pakistan needed off this over? They can’t leave themselves too much to do.

9 Jun 2024
21.12 CEST

15th over: Pakistan 73-3 Imad 7, Shadab 1) Shadab Khan is the new man and he steps out into the recently created cauldron on Long Island. Excellent over from Bumrah, just three runs and the massive wicket of Rizwan off it. Every ball is now cheered at maximum volume. Great to have a close game for this spectacle.

Pakistan need 37 from 30. Bumrah still has one over to bowl.

WICKET! Rizwan b Bumrah 31 (Pakistan 80-4)

BUMRAH BOWLS RIZWAN! Epic scenes inside the Nassau stadium as a sea of blue comes to life when they realise that Bumrah has skittled the key man. This game is on.

21.05 CEST

14th over: Pakistan 73-3 (Rizwan 31, Imad 5) Bonus runs for Pakistan as Imad gets a genuine edge off Arshdeep and it flies along the baize for four. Just two more singles off the over to keep things on the simmer.

40 needed from 36 balls. Here comes Jasprit Bumrah!

20.59 CEST

13th over: Pakistan 73-3 (Rizwan 30, Imad 0) Left-handed Imad Wasim joins Rizwan in the middle. The tension ratcheting up a notch after the wicket and a couple of dots. The Indian fans are significantly more vocal than they were just a couple of minutes ago. Hardik foxes Imad with a slower ball, and gets out of the over for just a single and the wicket. Game on… and all eyes on Rizwan.

WICKET! Fakhar Zaman c Pant b Pandya 13 (Pakistan 73-3)

Hardik Pandya to bowl his third over. Gone! Fakhar comes down to try and smear a short of a length ball but gets a top edge through to Pant. The keeper seemed to lose the ball momentarily as it looped over his helmet but he clung on. Could be a BIG wicket.

20.52 CEST

12th over: Pakistan 72-2 (Rizwan 29, Zaman 13) Arshdeep strays onto the pads with a half volley and is whipped away fine for by Fakhar. The green sections of the crowd are just daring to believe… Decent comeback from Singh who restricts it to just six off the over after the first ball boundary.

48 from 48. You do the math(s).

20.49 CEST

11th over: Pakistan 66-2 (Rizwan 28, Zaman 8) Fakhar Zaman is the new man. He can hit a loooong ball and enjoys a big stage. Stand by your beds. A couple of singles, the game bubbling away. SIX! Have some of that – what nerves? Fakhar Zaman trots down and launches a big one into the crowd. I think that is the best approach for Pakistan – get this target down, don’t let it go to a nervy finish at the end. (Imploring for a friend…)

WICKET! Usman Khan lbw b Patel 13 (Pakistan 57-2)

India strike with the first ball after drinks. Axar slides one onto Usman Khan and pins him in front. The umpire somewhat inexplicably doesn’t give it on the field but Rohit reviews and India take their second wicket.

20.41 CEST

10th over: Pakistan 57-1 (Rizwan 27, Khan 13) Just two singles off Jadeja’s first five balls. Something’s gonna give… sure enough Rizwan shimmy’s down and lifts him over extra cover for four.

Time for a drink – where’s your money? How are your nerves?

Pakistan need 63 runs from 60 balls. Simple – non?

20.38 CEST

9th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Rizwan 22, Khan 12) Very nearly a run out! Usman Khan set off for a single that didn’t exist and was sent back by Rizwan – a direct hit and it was curtains by a long way, but the throw missed. A legitimate single follows. Shot! Khan swivels a pull away off Pandya for four. A clip for two and another well judged (ahem) single make it nine off the over and brings 50 up for Pakistan.

20.34 CEST

8th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Rizwan 20, Khan 5) Blink and you miss it, Jadeja gets in and out for four singles.

9 Jun 2024
20.33 CEST

7th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Rizwan 18, Khan 3) Siraj smashes another into Rizwan’s gloves. That hurt too. It’s a top over from the seamer – beating the edge, mixing up his pace and conceding just three runs. Here comes Jadeja and his karate bandana. He’s an OBO scribes’ nightmare with his warp speed overs. Don’t distract me will you!

Share
9 Jun 2024
20.27 CEST

6th over: Pakistan 35-1 (Rizwan 17, Khan 1) I wonder if Pakistan could’ve been a bit more aggressive in the poweplay and risked a couple of wickets in order to take more of a chunk out of the total? Things will get a whole lot harder in the middle overs with the field set back. Hardik Pandya is going to bowl the last over of the powerplay. Rizwan dances down and smears him over the offside for SIX. That’s What Ahm Talkin’ About.

A short ball is gloved into the off side and seems to have hurt Rizwan. He gives it a shake. It’ll take more than that to stop him, remember when he did a stint in the ICU with a chest infection before a clutch match in the T20 World Cup a few years ago?

Anyway, nine runs off the over. A decent one for Pakistan. Bumrah is going to bowl his third, get through this unscathed and dare to dream? Yes, yes – hypocrite warning.

20.20 CEST

5th over: Pakistan 26-1 (Rizwan 10, Khan 0) Usman Khan is the new batter and he’s beaten by Bumrah first ball. The tension creeps up a notch. And again! Nervy poke from Khan at a lifting delivery outside off. India sense this is their time to pounce.
