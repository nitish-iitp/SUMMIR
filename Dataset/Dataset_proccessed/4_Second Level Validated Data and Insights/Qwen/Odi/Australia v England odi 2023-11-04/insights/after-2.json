        "Jos Buttler: 'Disappointment. Feel like we're having the same chat after every game. Some improvements again today but still short. It's a low point. To be stood in this position when you arrive in India with high hopes it incredibly tough, incredibly disappointing. It hurts a lot. We certainly haven't done ourselves justice. Fancied ourselves to have a real go at it. Incredibly tough to reach those highs [winning in 2019] and everyone knows the work that goes into that. Feel like we've let people down. You wear that on your own shoulders. [Happy chasing 287] Yeah, thought so, could have been better - frustrating partnership between Zampa and Starc, could have finished it quicker. Having come up 30 runs short, there's certainly areas we can find those 30 runs. [Dismissal] I think it was the right shot to play, execution was off. Felt that was the time to throw something back at the opp. My own form has been the biggest concern. I came in in a great place, but my own form has really hurt us. [Netherlands next] Only way you can get back into form is keep going. The longer it goes on, the closer you are to coming out of it.'",
        "Australia's Pat Cummins: 'Its been great. Boys played brilliantly. Off to a tough start, but every game found a way to win. Every game's improved. Still don't think we've played the complete game, but different match-winners and feels like it's all coming together. We have a lot of pride in [our fielding], seen a marked improvement, everyone's diving around and all the boys want to be in the hot spots. [Zampa] Been bowling beautifully. Got 30-odd and took a hanger out there. He's a matchwinner, was at his best tonight. Got Maxi and Mitchy who will be in at some stage, so we feel like we've got a whole squad who can go out and perform. Will be tough to pick an XI. [Wet ball] Wasn't too bad, we dried it plenty.'"
