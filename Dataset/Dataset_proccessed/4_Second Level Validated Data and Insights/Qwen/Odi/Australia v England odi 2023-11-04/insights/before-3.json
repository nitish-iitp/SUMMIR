    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Jos Buttler - Disappointment, we were having the same chat after the match. Improvements today, more with the bat, but we were still well short, no complaints if you lose by 30 runs. A low point as a captain, you stand in this position, you came to India with high hopes and expectations, we haven't done ourselves any justice, everyone knows how much hard work we've put, these losses weigh high on our shoulders. We did well (with the ball), but we could have done better, we let them put up frustrating little partnerships. With the dew around, we backed ourselves and we fell 30 runs short. It was the right shot to play (on his dismissals), the execution wasn't great, I was trying to take it back to them. I haven't played as well as I can, in such a pivotal position, I think I let myself and my team down. Only way to come back is to put in the hard yards at the nets and come back better in the next game",
        "Pat Cummins [Winning Skipper] - It's been great, the boys played brilliantly, we're getting better with each match. We've improved with each game, still not playing the perfect game. It's something we pride ourselves on, we didn't start well, but the boys have put their hands up, ever since the first 2 games. He has been bowling beautifully in the last 3 games (on Zampa), made 29 and took a banger (of a catch). We thought it was a good wicket and would probably break up to his strength. Maxi and Mitchy will be back, they have had a great tournament and for the others to come in and put in a performance was nice. It wasn't too bad tonight (on the dew), sometimes we do see players getting wet as they slide on, but it wasn't that bad today"

        "Adam Zampa has had a helluva a day. Probably didn’t get it right the other night against NZ. Got a proper training session. Sometimes my take-off into the delivery stride forced me to jump into it. The one to Joe Root swung a little late. I certainly heard it. Marnus heard it but he has a poor strike rate when it comes to reviews, gets it right once in 50 (laughs)"
