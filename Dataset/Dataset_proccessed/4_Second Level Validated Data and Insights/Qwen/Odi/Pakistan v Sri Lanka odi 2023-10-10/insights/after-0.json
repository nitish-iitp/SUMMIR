        "Rizwan said, 'It’s always a proud memory when you perform for your country. It was difficult because when you chase like that it’s always special. When we went to the dressing room every player believed we were going to chase that. This is a team game and we decided to go with a deep partnership.'",
        "Sri Lanka’s captain, Dasun Shanaka, tried to remain positive about the performance – especially by his two centurions. He said, 'I’m really happy about the way both of the guys played, but we should have finished a bit stronger than this. We have to look at the areas we bowled and the number of extras. The only way is to encourage [them]. We had our chances in the field but missed a lot today.'"
