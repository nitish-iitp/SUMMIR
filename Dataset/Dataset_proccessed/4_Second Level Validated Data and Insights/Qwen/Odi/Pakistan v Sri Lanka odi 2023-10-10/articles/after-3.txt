SL vs Pak | Shafique, Rizwan’s tons trump Mendis and Samarawickrama’s
Pakistan records the highest successful chase in the history of the quadrennial event; Hasan’s four-wicket haul brings Babar’s men back into the game towards the end of the innings after Lanka looked poised for more than the 344 it scored

Opener Abdullah Shafique (113, 103b, 10x4, 3x6) became the first Pakistani batter to score a century on World Cup debut in what was his fifth ODI match and a spirited Mohammad Rizwan (131 n.o., 121b, 8x4, 3x6), who battled repeated cramps, guided Pakistan to its second win in two games when it defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in the World Cup at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Tuesday.

For Sri Lanka, it was a second loss in two games. It was a pity that two brilliant centuries earlier by Kusal Mendis (122, 77b, 14x4, 6x6) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (108, 89b, 11x4, 2x6) went in vain.
