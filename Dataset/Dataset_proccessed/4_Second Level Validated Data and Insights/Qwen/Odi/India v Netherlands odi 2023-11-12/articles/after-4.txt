The Netherlands team do a lap of the Bengaluru stadium. Their tournament is done, but they can surely exit with their heads held high. India will next face New Zealand in the semi-final and that is expected to be a cracker of a game. That will be it from us tonight. Thanks for tuning in. Until next time, this is me Ashish Pant, signing off on behalf of Alan, Thilak and Raghav. Ciao!

Alwin21: "@Ashish Pant. So if in case a sixth bowler is needed who would India use?" A certain wrong-footed inswinging menace.

India captain Rohit Sharma: Since we started the tournament, it was all about one game at a time. We never wanted to look too far ahead. It is a long tournament, 11 games in all if we go all the way. It was important to break it down and focus on it. We focused on one game. We are playing in different venues and play accordingly and that's what we did. Very pleased at how we've played in these nine games. Very clinical from game one to today . Different individuals have stepped up and put their hand up and done the job. Everyone wanted to take the responsibility. Playing in different venues, it was a challenge. We adapted really well. We started the tournament four games in a row chasing, and then we had to bat first and the pacers did the job along with the spinners. The result do matter to keep the dressing room lively. We are playing in India, there will be expectation. We wanted to do the job at hand. It's one thing to talk about it but for everyone to buy into it is very important. We enjoy each other's company. We wanted to play with enjoyment on the field. We try to keep the atmosphere outside lively. [Sixth bowler] It is something that is always in our mind. We want to create those options in the team, today we had nine options. This was the game we could have tried certain things. The seamers bowling those wide yorkers which was not needed but they did.

Netherlands captain, Scott Edwards: It's a little bit of a tricky one at the moment where we want to be. We are pretty confident with the style we play. The tournament was always going to be tough. They [India] are as good a side going around. We will have to be a lot better going into theT20 World Cup next year. They showed pure class with the bat. Playing to learn with that. They soaked up the pressure. When you are three down with ten overs left, you are going to score some runs. We are a very young side. Lots of young sides in the setup. We have some training camps coming. Fixtures wide, I am not sure about that.

Shreyas Iyer is the Player of the Match: I kind of had a deja vu. This had happened against Australia as well, and I threw my wicket and I came but this time I wanted to come not out. Wanted to pills I took for the cramps to kick in. Today it came and I am very happy. The scores I got in the last few days helped me. The wicket was playing tacky, a bit two paced. I wanted to capitalise on the start. [Straight hit] I have worked a lot of those shorts, especially in the nets. I was trying to hit straight, and keep my head down. Get into a good position, and after that, it is a followthrough of the bat that ends behind my shoulder.

9.30pm Vande Mataram rings all around the M Chinnaswamy Stadium as the players shake hands. India have ended the league stage the way they started - with utter dominance. India make it nine out of nine and will now face New Zealand in the semi-final in Mumbai on Wednesday. It was always going to go one way after India posted 410 for 4 thanks to hundreds by Iyer and Rahul. But, Netherlands put up a decent fight. They lost Wesley Barresi in the second over, but Max O'Dowd and Colin Ackermann put up a strong show adding 61 for the second wicket in quick time. Kuldeep and Jadeja got into the act before Virat Kohli picked up the wicket of Scott Edwards down leg. Teja Nidamanuru hacked his way to a 39-ball 55 and was the last wicket to fall off Rohit Sharma. India used nine bowlers in all, only the third time that nine bowlers have been used in a men's ODI World Cup innings.

Rohit Sharma to Nidamanuru, OUT

ROHIT GETS A WICKET! And that's that. India have claimed their ninth successive win in World Cup matches, a first for them. Was tossed up outside off, Nidamanuru drags it straight down long-on's throat. India win by 160 runs and end the group stage undefeated.

Bumrah to Dutt, OUT

Does Dutt with a slower ball! He did not have much of a clue, did he. Slower length ball that grips on the surface and spins back in. Dutt eyes a wild slog across the line. Misses and sees his bails flying.

Kartik: "It's one thing to have all the repertoires in your armoury but it takes a very intelligent cricketing brain to know when to use them. What a thinking cricketer? That's Bumrah for you"
