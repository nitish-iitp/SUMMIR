Head blasts huge century in Australia’s ODI win over England

By Andrew Slevison

Travis Head blasted an unbeaten century as Australia overcome some earlier struggles to eventually haul in England in the opening ODI at Trent Bridge.

The Aussies managed to chase down England’s target of 315 by making 3/317 in 44 overs courtesy of a thunderous display with the willow from Head.

He piled on 20 fours and struck five sixes to finish not out on 154 from 129 deliveries, carrying his bat after opening the innings alongside captain Mitch Marsh.

It was Head’s sixth ODI ton.

Head was supported by Marnus Labuschagne who made 77 not out (61 balls) while Steve Smith (32 off 28) and Cam Green (32 off 32) also contributed with the bat.

In England’s innings, it was another left-handed opener in Ben Duckett who took to the Aussie bowlers in making 95 off 91 balls. Will Jacks struck 62 (56 balls) and Harry Brook, on debut as skipper, made 39 (31 balls) as the hosts forced their way to 315.

It could have been a bigger total if not for the intervention of star spinner Adam Zampa who finished with figures of 3/49, while Labuschagne (3/39 off 6 overs) and Head (2/34 off 4.4 overs) were also handy with the ball.

The Australians will now take their 1-0 lead to Leeds on Saturday for Game 2 of the five-game series.
