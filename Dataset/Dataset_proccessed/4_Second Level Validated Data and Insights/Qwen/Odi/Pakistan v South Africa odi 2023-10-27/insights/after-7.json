    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It’s in a bit chaos at the moment! The guys are enjoying it, I think some of them have been picking up Shamsi. It was a nail-biting finish, if you are a South African fan you are a little bit happier. We haven’t done well in chasing but it will be easier to have those conversations now.",
        "I think obviously we have a blueprint which is batting first… we obviously want a more clinical display with the bat when we chase.",
        "I’m ecstatic for him. He came in in favourable conditions and exploited them and then with the bat at the end - I think you’ve seen Shamsi on social media gloating about his batting! We needed that today and fortunately for us he came through.",
        "Phew. There is truth in the saying - be careful in what you wish for – I have no nails left. Kudos to South Africa. Let me lie down."

    "Others": [
        "Rain interrupted play, reducing the game to 20 overs per side",
        "Pakistan dearly needed that. In comes Marco Jansen, if they get him quickly (remember he smoked 75 against England) then it is into the tail we go.",
        "Iftikhar is back into the attack after his brief stint at the start of the innings – ouch – Markram lifts him nonchalantly back over his head for a maximum. Hmmmm.",
        "Not defending 282 against Afghanistan and then defending 270 against South Africa would be the most Pakistan this Pakistan team has ever Pakistaned #PAKvsSA"
