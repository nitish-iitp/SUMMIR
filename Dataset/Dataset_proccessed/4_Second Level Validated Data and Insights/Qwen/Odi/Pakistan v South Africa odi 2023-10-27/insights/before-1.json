        "South Africa's last win in ODI World Cups against Pakistan came in 1999, but they come into this game strong favourites.",
        "The ferocious brilliance of South Africa has combined with clinical effectiveness, lending that side a steel and ruthlessness they have often been accused of lacking.",
        "Pakistan have slightly greater worries than complaints that they only beat the defending champions by 229 rather than the 300 runs that they wanted.",

        "South Africa have a 3-2 lead against Pakistan in ODI World Cups, but their last win came in 1999.",
