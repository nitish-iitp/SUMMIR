        "Ireland’s focus has been on the shorter forms of the game, and while they have six T20 wins from 14 games, three of those were against non-Test playing countries.",
        "Paul Stirling and Harry Tector have struggled with form, with Stirling managing just one half-century and Tector going 11 innings without reaching 20.",
