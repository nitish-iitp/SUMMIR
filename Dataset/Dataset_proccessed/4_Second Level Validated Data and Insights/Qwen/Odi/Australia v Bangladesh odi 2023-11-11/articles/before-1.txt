And that is that!
Associated Press

On a day when Bangladesh posted their highest total, Australia made it look easy completing their biggest chase in World Cups. Australia will now shift their focus to South Africa and the Eden Gardens. They may even switch on the TV and watch England and Pakistan scrap it out in Kolkata as they wind down to get a feel of the conditions. For Bangladesh, the defeat marks the end of a dour campaign, but at least they have ensured they get to the Champions Trophy.

Australia lost their first two games, and could have gone maybe the England way, but instead, they bounced back to win seven on the trot to seal a spot in the semi-finals. And with their batting order firing all cylinders, they could not be better placed right now.

That should wrap up our coverage of this game today. But do hop over to follow what happens between England and Pakistan.

Mitch Marsh's day out

Mitchell Marsh finishes unbeaten on 177 off 132 balls. He gave away 50 runs in his four overs with the ball, but Australia will be more than happy with how he made up for it. He hit 17 fours and nine sixes as he smashed the bowlers all over the park, except behind square on the off side. Even cramps could not slow him down as he continued at a brisk pace right till the end. This is not just his highest ODI score, but also the second-highest in the World Cup.

Australia's chase of 291 against Afghanistan in their last game was their biggest in World Cups and today they made short work of the 307-run target set by Bangladesh. Taskin Ahmed had Travis Head early but after that Mitchell Marsh put on two massive stands with David Warner and Steven Smith to take Australia home.

Just for the second time in this World Cup, Steven Smith brings up a half-century. He has come close on a couple of occasion, but fallen just short. No falling short today, though as he gets there off 55 balls. Australia will be happy that he has done well here at No. 4 and Australia will be happy to have him in rhythm heading into the semi-finals.

Mitchell Marsh has cramped up a couple of times now while batting and is not looking at his most comfortable, even as he goes past is previous highest score in the format. Of course, we know a batter who cramped up in a chase for Australia in recent memory, and we all know how that turned out! Anyway Marsh hits Nasum Ahmed for two back-to-back boundaries, before Steven Smith also drives him through the covers as the runs keep coming thick and fast for Australia.

Mitchell Marsh tons up
Associated Press

Mitchell Marsh has raced to his third ODI century, and second of this World Cup campaign. Looking dangerous right from the start of his knock, he gets to the milestone in 87 balls with 11 fours and four sixes. He faces four dots in a row off Mahedi Hasan's over, batting on 99, but he gets to his century with a single off the first ball he faces the next over, bowled by Nasum Ahmed.

A full ball from Mustafizur Rahman and Warner picks out Najmul Hossain Shanto, who grabs it with ease, but does lose control of the ball as he tries to throw it up to celebrate, with the ball falling in front after his hand hits his thigh while trying to throw the ball up. It brings back flashbacks of that Herschelle Gibbbs moment, but Shanto had held on for long enough before trying to celebrate and Warner walks off. He finishes the league stage of the World Cup with 499 runs. His average against Bangladesh in ODIs remains very high at 129.5 though.

A 33rd ODI fifty for David Warner, and he is three runs away from becoming the fourth batter to reach the 500-run mark in the World Cup. Six fours off his bat today, as he has sat back and let Mitchell Marsh be the aggressor, while rotating strike expertly. If he can convert this into a ton, he will draw level with Rohit Sharma for most World Cup centuries.

Mitchell Marsh too just 37 balls to bring up his third fifty-plus score of this World Cup. He has been aggressive from the get go, and not slowed down against spin. Mahedi Hasan, Nasum Ahmed and Mehidy Hasan Miraz have all faced the brunt of his aggression, with Mehidy being greeted into the attack with a four and six off his first two balls of the game. He has hit six fours and three sixes so far.

Mitchell Marsh shimmies down the track to hit Nasum Ahmed for his second six of the game. With that, he has reached 30, which is his average at No. 3 in this World Cup. While Marsh has been devastating as an opener, his returns at No. 3 haven't quite been similar and he will want to play a big knock today. In the World Cup, he avergaes 37.8 as an opener and 30 as No. 3. He even strikes much quicker at the top, while at No. 3 his strike rate drops to 81 as compared to 125 as an opener. Of course, today, he has had the advantage of coming in early, which has helped him exploit the powerplay. How will he go now, with the fielding restrictions lifted?

Mahmudullah's last stand?
Associated Press

By Mohammad Isam

Mahmudullah met a premature, heartbreaking end to his World Cup campaign when he was run out for 32. But is this the end of his ODI career too? There have been murmurs that he might announce his retirement at the end of this game, but there has been no suggestion of the same from Mahmudullah or his camp. We have to wait for the end of this game, but if it indeed is the end of his ODI career, it ended on a high. He finished as the team's highest run-getter in his fourth World Cup, more notable because of how he was sidelined for about 6 months prior to the tournament on grounds of "rest" even though it was abundantly clear that the new head coach didn't want him in the system.

Bangladesh 306 for 8 (Hridoy 74, Shanto 45, Zampa 2-32) vs Australia

A collective batting effort sees Bangladesh post their highest total in this World Cup in their last game. It has, as a result, all but ensured that they won't slip behind Sri Lanka on net run rate in their bid to qualify for the Champions Trophy.

Litton Das and Tanzid Hasan got Bangladesh off to a strong start with a 76-run stand. After the two of them fell in quick succession, it was Towhid Hridoy and Najmul Hossain Shanto who put on 66 for the third wicket before Labuschagne accounted for Shanto with a brilliant bit of fielding.

Hridoy then took a back seat and let Mahmudullah take on the bowlers before he was run out thanks to a Labuschagne direct hit.

Hridoy went on to hit 74, batting into the last five overs, as he also got some support from Mushfiqur Rahim. Mehidy Hasan Miraz provided the push at the death to give Bangladesh their first 300-plus total of the tournament, finishing on 29 off 20.

Bangladesh's top seven all crossed the 20-run mark.

Adam Zampa picked two wickets to move to the top of the charts in this World Cup, while Sean Abbott also chipped in with two wickets in his first game in the competition.

Stay tuned for the chase, which will begin after a short break.

Only one half-centurion, but plenty of other significant contributions from the rest as well. How much will they end with? One over to go.

Towhid Hridoy departs after a finely crafted 74 off 79. He attacked when he came in and dug deep when Bangladesh lost wickets at the other end. He wanted to stay deep to make the most of the death overs, and gets out trying to clear the ropes off a full toss but picks out Marnus Labuschagne in the deep, who can do no wrong in the field today. Hridoy has really helped Bangladesh on their way to a competitive total today, but will be kicking himself for the soft dismissal and for not batting on till the end.

Shanto misses out on a fifty
Associated Press

Good starts going to waste seems to be the theme with the Bangladesh batters today. It's Najmul Hossain Shanto now who falls five short of a third half-century in the tournament. It's a dismissal that could have been avoided as Shanto pushes for a second run that wasn't quite there after hacking a short ball away through the square leg region. Marnus Labuschagne was accurate with his throw and despite his dive, Shanto was well short of the crease when Josh Inglis took the bails off.

Zampa, meanwhile, now shares the second position with compatriot Brad Hogg, who took 21 wickets in Australia's successful 2007 campaign, and Shahid Afridi, who picked 21 scalps in 2011 for Pakistan.

Litton's underwhelming World Cup show

By Mohammad Isam

Litton Das has finished his World Cup campaign by scoring the most runs for a Bangladesh opener in a single World Cup. But how much of his 284 runs have come to Bangladesh's use is up for debate. He averaged 31.55 with two fifties, but his major feature has been to throw away his wicket after a start. It happened against Australia too, as he got out to a soft dismissal. His softest exit so far came against Pakistan when he literally stopped his shot in its tracks, to give short midwicket a dolly. It never helps the team, neither is it helping LKD.

It's a soft dismissal for Litton Das as he tries to go for a big shot. Litton tries to go downtown as Zampa tosses it up on the stumps. He can't clear long-on and that's both openers gone, with neither making a half-century despite getting good starts. Zampa claims his 21st wicket of the tournament, making him the joint-highest wicket-taker along with Sri Lanka's Dilshan Madushanka. He is the only spinner in the top five wicket-takers in this World Cup.

Just the twice. Litton Das and Tanzid Hasan have given Bangladesh just two good starts in the World Cup. This has been the root of Bangladesh's problems in their batting in this campaign. When they lose one opener early, plus the batting reshuffle, it has always troubled the rest of the batters. They have admitted that they should have taken responsibility, but many of them didn't, and chief among them is Litton. He has made two fifties, but none of them ultimately worked for Bangladesh. He has also left for home twice during the campaign, which has prompted many in the BCB to say that he lacks focus. This could be the innings that tells them that Litton is well focused.

After sussing out the conditions, the two Bangladesh openers are starting to pick up the pace. First, Litton Das pulled a Josh Hazlewood behind square for the first boundary of the game.

Pat Cummins had bowled 12 overs in the first powerplay in this World Cup, coming into this game, and is yet to pick up a wicket in the phase. Today, he has already conceded 13 runs in his first two overs, seven of which have come through wides down the leg side.

He did get a beauty of a delivery to zip past Litton Das' outside edge though, and will be hoping he can get a nick soon. He is also getting the ball to swing a fair bit, especially into the right-hander.

Australia bowl; Smith replaces Maxwell

Pat Cummins wins the toss and opts to bowl. Bangladesh's stand-in captain Najmul Hossain Shanto says he would have batted first too.

Steven Smith is back, but it's for Glenn Maxwell, while Sean Abbott comes in for Mitchell Starc. Cummins says he wanted both players to be at their best physically for when the semis come around. Remember, Maxwell was batting through severe cramps for his epic 201*.

Shakib Al Hasan is out with injury, while Bangladesh have made two other changes, with Nasum Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman coming into the team.

Australia XI: David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (wk), Marcus Stoinis, Sean Abbott, Pat Cummins (c), Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

In fact, in all ODIs, Australia have won 19 of the 21 matches they have played against Bangladesh. Bangladesh have just the one win against Australia, while there was one game rained out. Can Bangladesh improve that record today?
