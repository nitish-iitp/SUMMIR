        "England won by 93 runs",
        "Several of this England squad may not wear an ODI shirt again - certainly not in a World Cup",
        "This brand of England has sizzled more against Pakistan than any other side, winning 14 of their 18 completed ODIs since the 2015 World Cup, including a then-World record total of 444 at Trent Bridge",
        "Pakistan lost four consecutive matches to leave them facing the exit",
        "To get past New Zealand now requires a miracle, and a sustained commitment to progressive cricket that Babar has frankly been unable to inspire his side to in all his years at the helm of Pakistan cricket",
        "England turned in something resembling a complete performance against Netherlands, despite a middle-order wobble that threatened to destabilise",
        "England's bowling took a battering against New Zealand, but they are expected to field an unchanged side to the one that pulled off that near-miraculous DLS win chasing 402",
        "There's some grass on what looks like a dry pitch. It's also off-centre, which will result in a short boundary one side. It's expected to be hot and quite humid, with rain not in the offing"
