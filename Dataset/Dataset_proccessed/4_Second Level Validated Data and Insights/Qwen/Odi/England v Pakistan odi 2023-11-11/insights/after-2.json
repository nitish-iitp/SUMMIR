        "The tournament hasn’t quite gone to plan as a whole, which is a big disappointment.",
        "To be able to perform and enjoy my last few games, and get to 100 wickets as well, is a nice treat for me.",
        "It would have been nice to have that [100 ODI wickets] and make the final as well, but it wasn’t meant to be. When you look around the dressing room, we have a number of good players and we definitely underperformed here [in India]."
