And on that note, we sign off from this game. Thanks all for joining us, and please continue to do so throughout this World Cup!

Jos Buttler: "Nice to put in a good performance and finish this way. Lots to reflect on and ultimately disappointing but good to win today. We showed the true version of ourselves. We haven't shown enough what we're capable of. Lots of us haven't performed to our level. To not have him available for a few games was a challenge but we're a good enough team to have been able to deal with it.

"The World Cup as a whole is a disappointment. We spoke together about how if this is the last game for a lot of players, then let's make some good memories at the very least. David Willey's been fantastic. Ever since he came in in 2015. he always finds a way, a proper competitor, a real team man, and to be Player of the Match in his last match speaks volumes.

"I don't think there'll be a drastic change of plan like we had in 2015. There are a few things we need to change and build something new. Doesn't mean there'll be a huge clearout but we have work to do to become a top team again."

Babar Azam: "We conceded a few too many runs. We bowled a few loose deliveries towards the end. And out spinners' aren't taking wickets, which doesn't help. That has a big effect because you need to take wickets in the middle overs. The pitch is very true and the margin of error is very low for fast bowlers, which explains the big scores we have conceded. We will sit together and take stock. We'll take positives from this and discuss mistakes. I'm keen to lead the rebuild."

David Willey is the man of the match in his final international match.

"The tournament hasn't gone to plan for us as a whole which is disappointing. For me to be able to perform and get to 100 wickets in my last game has been a nice way to finish. You only have to look around the dressing room; we've got massive talent. There's no doubt we've underperformed here which is disappointing.

"People might have frowned at the timing of my retirement but nit many players get to walk out on their own terms. Rob Keys said to me hope you prove me wrong and I hope I've done that. Proud every time I've pulled on this shirt.

That T20 World Cup win in Australia last year was pretty special. I didn't actually play in the competition itself but that moment was very special."

W
Woakes to Haris Rauf, OUT

This one's higher than it is long, and this entertaining partnership comes to an end. Stokes takes a comfortable catch as the curtain comes down on both England and Pakistan's World Cup campaigns. On the day, England were much too good as Pakistan turned out an indifferent performance with both ball and bat

Woakes to Haris Rauf, no run

Slightly wide of off stump and Haris watches it go by. Not a wide, though

Woakes to Haris Rauf, no run

Nudged to backward point

Rounak: "6 of us friends are watching this from our dorm in Kolkata and regretting not going to the stadium to watch this live:( Rooting for Rauf's 50 here, and who knows, even a hundred!!!" Pakistan need 94 in 42 now

Willey to Mohammad Wasim, no run

Tried to lob it over Buttler but he collects, and that is Willey done in international cricket

42.5
4
Willey to Mohammad Wasim, FOUR runs

This one's carved over extra cover, and it sails away for another four. This was a shot of some talent. Opened his body up and guided this over cover. They bring up their 50-run stand. What fun

Rhys: "If it goes the distance, Buttler has made a mess of his overs and he'll need at least one from Root now." Think he'll be fine, to be honest

42.4
1
Willey to Haris Rauf, 1 run

Shovelled to Stokes at long-on this time

42.3
4
Willey to Haris Rauf, FOUR runs

This time it's the outside edge that gets him four. Frustration for Willey and England. He's just throwing the kitchen sink at everything and it's working out for him

42.2
•
Willey to Haris Rauf, no run

Swing and a miss this time

42.1
4
Willey to Haris Rauf, FOUR runs

Streaky but it goes Rauf's way. Sits back and tries to muscle into the onside. Gets an inside edge that runs away for four more

41.5

Atkinson to Haris Rauf, no run

Bang on that wide line, but according to the umpire just the right side of it

41.4

Atkinson to Mohammad Wasim, 1 leg bye

Raps him high on the thigh and Haris eventually persuades him to take a run

41.3

Atkinson to Mohammad Wasim, no run

Yorker that Wasim digs out

Zubair Islam : "These two would have been better off opening rather than Abdullah n Fakhar "

41.2
1
Atkinson to Haris Rauf, 1 run

Flies up in the air, and though it's gone so high, Atkinson could never get underneath it. In the end doesn't even attempt the catch and it plugs

41.1
6
Atkinson to Haris Rauf, SIX runs

Slower bouncer that Rauf saw coming a mile away. It's pummelled over midwicket disdainfully for a flat six

Willey to Mohammad Wasim, SIX runs

Possibly the shot of the night. Gorgeous drive back over the bowler's head. Wasim held the pose after timing it so beautifully. Flew into the night sky and sailed over Stokes' head at long-on

40.5
1
Willey to Haris Rauf, 1 run

Pokes it down to third man

40.4

Willey to Mohammad Wasim, 1 run

Squeezed into the offside towards deep cover for a single

40.3
•
Willey to Mohammad Wasim, no run

Tried to scoop it over the keeper's head and it crashes into his pads. England will review this but it's landed outside leg stump and that'll be the end of that

40.2
4
Willey to Mohammad Wasim, FOUR runs

Whacked over wide long-on for four more. He anticipated the short ball and put it away with applomb
