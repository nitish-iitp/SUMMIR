    "Key Match Events": [
        "Mitchell Starc pinned Harry Brook lbw with a brilliant delivery",
        "Aaron Hardie claimed two wickets in two balls, including a brilliant caught-and-bowled to remove Ben Duckett",
        "Jamie Smith and Jacob Bethell stopped the bleeding with a stand of 55",
        "Bethell somehow managed to skew a short, wide long hop from Glenn Maxwell to backward point",
        "Smith clipped Josh Hazlewood to midwicket for a neat 49"
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Australia went 2-0 up in the series with a convincing 68-run victory at Headingley",
        "With the visitors having welcomed back Hazlewood and Starc from illness, it still felt as though it would be a considerable test of an England side still trying to reestablish their one-day credentials"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Alex Carey pulls during his fighting half-century",
        "England's lower order showed there were few demons in the surface",
        "There had been movement for England's new-ball attack, particularly Stone who was impressive after being recalled for the rested Jofra Archer",
        "Adil Rashid claimed his 200th ODI wicket when he removed Glenn Maxwell"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Starc, playing his first game since the T20 World Cup in June, then produced a classy over against Brook",
        "In his second spell, Potts nipped the ball both ways: movement away found Short's edge then a peach of a delivery zipped back to take Smith's off stump",
        "Labuschagne spliced a pull against Bethell to mid-on and Marsh missed a sweep to give the left-armer his second",
        "Carse's day took a turn for the better. Recalled to the attack, he removed Hardie first ball with a pull spliced to midwicket and next delivery had Starc flicking into the leg side"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "In the first half of the game, Australia were not as dominant with the bat as they had been at Trent Bridge",
        "There had to be a mini-collapse following a stand of 55 between Carey and Hardie",
        "When Adam Zampa carved Rashid to point it appeared the innings was on the brink of a very early finish but the final-wicket stand, coupled with Australia's start with the ball, put a very different complexion on the game"
