        "India won by 243 runs",
        "The match will present the sternest test so far for India's five-bowler strategy",
        "South Africa could play both Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi, but the final decision will be made after seeing the pitch",
        "Shamsi, though, doesn't have a great record against India: five wickets in six ODIs, at an economy of 6.48",
        "Marco Jansen has picked up 12 wickets in the powerplay in this World Cup - the most by any bowler in that phase",
        "South Africa's 82 sixes in the tournament are the most by any team in a single edition of the World Cup"
