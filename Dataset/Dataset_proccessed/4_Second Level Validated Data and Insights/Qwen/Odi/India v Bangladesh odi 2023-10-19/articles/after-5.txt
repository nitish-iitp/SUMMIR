As does the Indian captain Rohit Sharma

Yeah it was a good win. We didn’t start well but we pulled it back in the middle and at the end. Our fielding has been superb and we continued that today. It’s something that’s within your control. We’ve got a fielding medal to give out after each game, it’s something nice within the group. Whoever ends up with the most, there’s something special for them.

The effort was great in the field and the bowlers are smart enough to know what lengths and lines to bowl. [Ravindra Jadeja] was brilliant with the ball, and he took a great catch as well. But I guess a hundred is a hundred, you can’t beat that.

[On Hardik Pandya] He pulled up a bit sore. There’s no major damage but with an injury like that you have to assess it day by day. We hope he pulls up okay tomorrow.

The Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto speaks

India are always a very good side and they played better cricket today. We didn’t play our best game. Tanzid batted really well but we didn’t finish well enough with the bat. [On Shakib] We hope he’ll be fit for the South Africa match. I hope the batting group takes responsibility in that game.

The player of the match is Virat Kohli

[You stole the award off Ravindra Jadeja] Sorry for stealing it from Jaddu! I wanted to make a big contribution. I’ve had a few fifties in World Cups and I haven’t really converted them, so I wanted to finish the game off this time round.

[On the two free hits at the start of his innings] I was telling Shubman, if you dream about a situation like that, you’ll just go back to sleep, you won’t think it’s real. It calms you down and gets you into the innings. The pitch was pretty good. It allowed to play my game: hit the gaps, run hard and get the boundaries when needed.

There’s a great atmosphere in the changing-room. We’re loving each other’s company, and it’s translating on the field. We understand it’s a long tournament and you need to create some momentum. It’s a special feeling playing at home. We just want to make the most of it.

INDIA WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS WITH 51 BALLS REMAINING

41.3 overs: India 261-3 (Kohli 103, Rahul 34) Nasum bowls a leg-side wide – except the umpire doesn’t call it. What’s going on here? Was it because Kohli offered no shot?

It wouldn’t matter if it had been called wide: Kohli finishes the match, and brings up his hundred, by lifting a full toss into the crowd at midwicket! It’s his 48th ODI ton – but his first in a successful World Cup runchase. He didn’t look interested for most of the innings, but then suddenly he went from first gear to fifth and hit the last 29 runs off the bat.

I’ve never seen a finish quite like that. It was a beautiful moment for one of the all-time greats, though I’m still not sure about the merits of managing a hundred in that way. It’s fair to say the crowd in Pune don’t share those reservations.

40th over: India 255-3 (Kohli 97, Rahul 34) Kohli, who was on 74 with 26 needed to win , turns down another single. The crowd are loving this. Mother Cricket’s thoughts are as yet unavailable.

A slower ball bouncer from Hasan is called wide, which leads to boos from the supporters. This is hilarious, exhilarating - but also indulgent and arguably a bit disrespectful. I suppose he’s earned the right.

Kohli steals a two to the leg side, then inside edges a hack just past leg stump. Five to win, six for Kohli’s hundred. He steals another two on the leg side, and now he’s four runs away with three needed.

Weirdly, Kohli turns down a single off the fifth ball, as if KL Rahul doesn’t know how to play a defensive stroke. But it doesn’t matter, because he is able to push the last delivery to long on and keep the strike. Two to win, three for Kohli’s hundred.

17.46 CEST

40th over: India 248-3 (Kohli 92, Rahul 34) It’s fair to say Virat Kohli doesn’t struggle with finishlineitis. He sweeps Nasum fiercely for four, which takes him to 85 with 15 needed for victory. Anyone got a calculator?

Rahul turns down a single, which makes it abundantly clear what is about to happen. Kohli sets the crowd alight by slog sweeping for six before driving the last ball down the ground for a single. Kohli has 92, India need eight to win.

19 Oct 2023
17.44 CEST

39th over: India 238-3 (Kohli 81, Rahul 34) Hasan Mahmud returns to the attack. Kohli, who has dealt exclusively in singles since the 29th over, suddenly decides to launch a full delivery over long on for six. And why not. Hasan’s figures are pretty ugly (7-0-59-1), but they don’t tell the story of an impressive spell to Rohit Sharma.

India’s next game could be a good one – they play New Zealand, the only other unbeaten team, in Dharamsala on Sunday. Bangladesh meet South Africa in a must-win game in Mumbai on Tuesday.

38th over: India 229-3 (Kohli 73, Rahul 33) Six singles off Mehidy, who ends a good spell of bowling with figures of 10-0-47-2.

“This game,” says Mark Beadle, “really could do with Rishabh Pant.”

Any game, in any sport, could do with Rishabh Pant.

37th over: India 223-3 (Kohli 70, Rahul 30) What’s especially encouraging for India is the form of their spine: Rohit, Kohli, Jadeja, Bumrah and Kuldeep. All five have been close to their best, which has allowed the younger players to ease into their first World Cup.

I should probably add KL Rahul to that list. He doesn’t have an average yet, so well is he batting, and he has just hooked successive deliveries from Shoriful for six and four.

17.32 CEST

36th over: India 209-3 (Kohli 68, Rahul 18) Tanzid saves a run or two with a fine diving stop at midwicket. Three from the over. I feel like I’ve typed that a lot in the last hour.

Share
19 Oct 2023
17.28 CEST

35th over: India 206-3 (Kohli 66, Rahul 17) Shoriful returns to the attack. Kohli, who doesn’t seem bothered about going for a hundred, rotates strike so that Rahul can swish a pull for four.

“The most interesting thing about this match is the camera (I am assured by someone who knows) picking out S Tendulkar watching Shubman Gill,” says Gary Naylor. “But not Sachin, his daughter, Sara. Bit of condemnation of a lacklustre World Cup to date really.”

At least we’re spared the premature Best Eva pieces that usually crop up after four days of the football World Cup.

34th over: India 201-3 (Kohli 65, Rahul 13) Yet another single brings up the 200. And that’s drinks.

17.17 CEST

33rd over: India 198-3 (Kohli 63, Rahul 12) Mahmudullah comes on to bowl some occasional offspin. He’s had a good day: runs, catches – and almost a wicket when Rahul clatters his third ball not far short of deep midwicket. Instead it goes for a single, as do the other five balls. True story.

17.13 CEST

32nd over: India 192-3 (Kohli 60, Rahul 9) Four singles from Mehidy’s seventh over. For much of this innings Bangladesh have bowled with accuracy and purpose. It feels like a 350 pitch, though, so they had no chance.

31st over: India 188-3 (Kohli 59, Rahul 7) This isn’t a run-chase for Virat Kohli, it’s a run-stroll. He’s just tapping singles on both sides of the wicket and smacking the odd bad ball for four. India need 69 from 114 balls.

“Results and statistics and records steal from the real performers their deserved spot in the limelight,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “If number of centuries or the total runs scored is going to be your yardstick you will never know the supreme elegance of a G R Viswanath.”

Quite. See also Victor Trumper, Kim Hughes, Learie Constantine, etc. That would be a fun XI to pick – brilliant and/or elegant players with a Test batting average below 40 and/or a bowling average above 30. I might do mine before the next OBO.

17.07 CEST

30th over: India 184-3 (Kohli 57, Rahul 5) KL Rahul skids back to cut Mehidy off middle stump for four. Imagine having the confidence and ability to play a shot like that when you’re on nought.

“But have India, and New Zealand for that matter, peaked too early?” says Simon McMahon. “And are England, or indeed Australia, about to time their run just right?”

I literally haven’t a clue. I don’t think New Zealand are nailed on for the semis by the way, impressive though they have been. It could become quite a dogfight. At the risk of sticking my neck out, my hunch is that the semi-finalists will be India plus three others.

WICKET! India 178-3 (Iyer c Mahmudullah b Mehidy 19)

Shreyas Iyer holes out to cow corner. It was nicely bowled by Mehidy, who did him in the flight, but Iyer looks annoyed to have left 30-odd runs out there. He goes for 19 from 25 balls.

29th over: India 178-2 (Kohli 56, Iyer 19) Mustafizur returns to the attack. He bowls five consecutive dot balls to Kohli, who still has the final word with a gorgeous push drive through extra cover for four. He’s batting with an intimidating certainty, and those three years without a century feel a long time ago.

“I think George Dobell has it right about this England team,” says Digvijay Yadav. “They have been superb (one World Cup in each format within a four-year period) and that needs to be acknowledged if the wheels do come off. Unfortunately, as he also said, England’s golden eras are shorter than Australia’s and often come to calamitous ends.”

Yes, though this golden era lasted longer than most, in any sport. Usually with English teams it’s a golden month rather than an era. I completely agree with George. Even if this World Cup is one long 1996-2015 tribute act, they’ll still be one of the best white-ball teams of all time. It’s not just about the success; they’ve changed forever the way cricket is played in England.

28th over: India 174-2 (Kohli 52, Iyer 19) Nasum returns to the attack and is milked – we need some synonyms for that – for three more. The match is over, we’re just doing admin now.

“Actually, yeah, I undercooked that a bit,” says Mark Beadle of his prediction in the 21st over. “Got distracted making choco cookies with my daughter.”

Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparklemotion.

27th over: India 171-2 (Kohli 50, Iyer 18) Kohli pulls Hasan impatiently through midwicket for four to move to 49, and a quick single takes him to the most predictable half-century of the day. He made a flying start, aided by a couple of free hits, and then settled down for the longer haul: 34 from the first 25 balls, 16 from the next 23.

26th over: India 164-2 (Kohli 44, Iyer 17) “Pandya’s injury will probably bring Ashwin back,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “A top-class bowler and even has five Test centuries to his name if I recall.”

Yep I think that’s what will happen, perhaps with Shami replacing Thakur in certain games. Every captain wants a decent sixth bowler and the top five are in such form that India don’t really need a lower order. So far in this tournament, Nos 6-11 have faced a grand total of eight balls in four games.

25th over: India 161-2 (Kohli 42, Iyer 16) Shreyas Iyer is fine, and he proves the point by muscling a pull for four. India’s requirement is into double figures: 96 from 150 balls.

19 Oct 2023
16.44 CEST

24.3 overs: India 156-2 (Kohli 41, Iyer 12) The impressive Hasan Mahmud returns to the attack, though it feels a bit late. Shreyas Iyer takes a dodgy single to mid-on and is well short when the throw misses the the stumps. It then bounces up to hit Iyer on the leg, so there’s a break in play while he receives treatment.

19 Oct 2023
16.41 CEST

24th over: India 154-2 (Kohli 40, Iyer 11) The alternative for India is to play specialists: bring in Suryakumar Yadav and Mohamed Shami for Pandya and Shardul Thakur, then hope none of the five bowlers suffer an injury. Their flying start to the tournament gives them a bit of a safety net for the rest of the league stage, and if Pandya is still unfit come the semi-final they could call up a replacement allrounder.

Share
19 Oct 2023
16.38 CEST

23rd over: India 150-2 (Kohli 38, Iyer 9) Shoriful is thumped to deep extra for two by Shreyas Iyer. Even Iyer, the least celebrated of the Indian batters, has an ODI average of 47 with a strike rate of 97.

The commentators are talking about what India might do if Pandya misses the next few games with his ankle injury. It would be a risk to play six batters because none of them are reliable sixth bowlers, so they may decide to pack the lower middle order with Jadeja, Ashwin and Thakur from Nos 6-8.

19 Oct 2023
16.36 CEST

22nd over: India 146-2 (Kohli 37, Iyer 6) “I got a bit wistful there at your mention of Gary Anderson,” says Simon McMahon. “ I mean, I know he’s still around, but watching him these days induces the same feeling in me that I get when watching Andy Murray play tennis. He’s just not what he once was. Do you think the same is true of the current England 50-over side, or have reports of their death been greatly exaggerated?”

I’d say they’re definitely past their best, but they were past their best a year ago and they won the World T20. They looked pretty ragged at the start of that tournament too. While there are a few worrying signs, I’d be loath to write them off. They probably need to change the balance and mindset of the team though. One of the ex-England skippers in the media need to take a hit and publicly call Jonny Bairstow a waste of space. That would get him going, and he sets the tone in the absence of Jason Roy.

16.31 CEST

21st over: India 143-2 (Kohli 35, Iyer 5) Nobody has scored more runs in successful ODI chases than Virat Kohli: 5588, with a startling 22 hundreds. Only two other players are in double figures, Sachin Tendulkar (14) and Rohit Sharma (12).

Shoriful appeals for a leg-side catch when Shreys misses an attempted hook. The umpire isn’t interested and Bangladesh decide agaist a review. I’d like to see UltraEdge though.

Update: we’ve seen UltraEdge and it was nowhere near the bat or glove.

“So,” says Mark Beadle, “which over do we have in the sweepstake for when India wrap this up? 32?”

I’ll go for the 39th, and 38.4 if you want to be really precise.

16.27 CEST

20th over: India 142-2 (Kohli 34, Iyer 5) Hardik Pandya will only bat in an emergency because of his ankle injury, so Bangladesh will be right back in this game if they can take six quick wickets.

The wicket of Kohli would be a big start. He looks in serious touch and spanks a wide delivery from Mehidy for four. A single down the ground takes him to 34 from only 25 balls.

Shreyas Iyer edges the last delivery past Mushfiqur through the vacant slip cordon for four. Surely Bangladesh need to attack the new batter. In fact Mushfiqur got a touch on it, so it counts as a dropped catch, though it was very tough.

WICKET! India 132-2 (Gill c Mahmudullah b Miraz 53)

A fine catch from Mahmudullah at cow corner. Gill charged Miraz and dragged the ball over midwicket and towards the boundary. Mahmudullah danced round the boundary, showing great awareness to stay just inside the sponge while also taking a two-handed catch. His footwork was really deft.

19th over: India 130-1 (Gill 51, Kohli 29) Shoriful Islam returns to the attack. Gill tips and runs to reach a stylish half-century from 52 balls. It’s his 16th 50+ score in just 38 ODI innings, which is obscene. Nobody from a Test-playing nation gets close to his ODI average of 66.

“You talked earlier about this WC so far being nothing but mismatches,” says Ewan Glenton, “and also said that India could be a match for a World XI right now; combining the two references, presumably if Graham Gooch were commentating on the tournament he’d say that every game it’s like there’s a World XI in one dressing room and Ilford 2nds in the other.”

Goochie doesn’t get enough credit for his earthy lyricism. “A fart competing with thunder” was another cracker.

18th over: India 125-1 (Gill 49, Kohli 26) The offspinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz comes on after the drinks break. With the required rate barely four an over, India are very happy to milk singles. Three in that over.
