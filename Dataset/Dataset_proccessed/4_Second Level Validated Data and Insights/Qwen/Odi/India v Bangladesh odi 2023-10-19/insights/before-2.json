        "Shakib Al Hasan is expected to be fit to play against India.",
        "India are set to face Bangladesh in their next World Cup match, and the numbers are telling. In ODIs since 2022, Indian batters have conceded 42 wickets to left-arm spinners, as opposed to 21 and 24 wickets to leg-spinners and off-spinners, respectively.",
        "Shakib has 10 wickets in four games at an average of 18 and strike rate of 24 against India since 2022.",
        "The Indian team have stated that they have no special strategy to counter Shakib, and whether or not he plays is inconsequential to them.",
        "Bangladesh have won three of their last four ODIs against India, with their victories occurring in bilateral matches and the recent Asia Cup fixture, which was a less significant occasion."
