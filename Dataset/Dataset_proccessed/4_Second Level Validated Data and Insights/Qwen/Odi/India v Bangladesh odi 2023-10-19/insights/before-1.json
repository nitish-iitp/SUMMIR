        "India could turn up 80% and still be good enough to win",
        "Bangladesh may have a favourable 3-1 ODI record against India in the last 12 months but beating India in India is easier said than done",
        "India's outstanding bowling attack, led by Jasprit Bumrah, has taken 28 out of a possible 30 wickets so far",
        "Rohit Sharma's ultra-aggressive approach has been the highlight of their batting performances and he's got another batting-friendly surface waiting for him in Pune",
        "Bangladesh's only win against India in the ODI World Cup was 16 years ago - in Trinidad in 2007",
        "Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim were just starting their careers then, and they have played India three times on the biggest stage since, losing quite convincingly on each occasion",
        "This Bangladesh squad has enough experience and young talent in their ranks to stretch India, but their current form isn't promising",
        "Shakib suffered a quadriceps injury last week but could play - as per their coach, Bangladesh are awaiting results of a scan done on match eve before taking the final decision",
        "Whether Bangladesh runs India close or not could come down to how their fast bowlers fare",
        "India are unlikely to change their winning combination. The small ground dimensions and flat pitch could mean that Shardul Thakur is likely to keep his spot ahead of R Ashwin",
        "If Bangladesh can play Shakib, they will. They could be tempted to promote Mehidy Hasan Miraz to open with Litton and Mushfiqur could also bat higher in the order. The question is whether Bangladesh will look to strengthen their bowling by sacrificing some batting depth"

        "This is Bangladesh's first ODI against India in India in 25 years",
