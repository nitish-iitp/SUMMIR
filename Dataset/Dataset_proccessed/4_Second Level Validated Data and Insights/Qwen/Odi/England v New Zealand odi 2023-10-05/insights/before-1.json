    "Key Match Events": [
        "Rachin Ravindra became NZ's youngest World Cup centurion.",
        "Devon Conway's 83-ball century was the fastest for New Zealand at the men's ODI World Cup.",
        "Mitchell Santner produced a rare 10-over spell of bowling - England couldn't hit him for a single boundary, and that hasn't happened in ODIs since 2018.",
        "Matt Henry produced perhaps the ball of the game in conditions designed to negate him and even a batter of the quality of Jos Buttler couldn't keep it out."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Experts predicted New Zealand as the favorites given their home advantage.",
        "Tim Southee still can't feel the tip of his broken thumb.",
        "Lockie Ferguson has a back problem, although he spent a little time as a sub fielder out there, so it shouldn't be too bad."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Mitchell Santner has variations. He has a knuckle ball that he calls the claw because of how he ends up gripping it. He can, if he wants to, try a lot of things.",
        "Rachin Ravindra is scoring at a rate of 152 and the partnership is coming at a rate of 7.75 per over",
        "England finished on 282 for 9. They were 252 for 9 in the 46th over but with a guy with 10 first-class centuries - Adil Rashid - still out there, they went through to 50 overs and the score isn't all that bad."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "With three huge players missing, New Zealand have utterly swatted England aside.",
        "With Buttler and Livingstone still available, New Zealand will be able to go at 8s and 10s in the last 20 overs if need be.",
        "England sent their left-hander out to counter NZ's left-arm spinners. So NZ turned to their part-time offspinner and he's struck second ball.",
        "England four down in the 22nd over and it's time for their captain to take centre stage."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Rain interrupted play, reducing the game to 20 overs per side.",
        "Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson are injured, limiting New Zealand's options."
