    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Avishka Fernando's 96 took Sri Lanka to 248, paving the way for their first bilateral ODI series win against India in 27 years",
        "India's batting (except Rohit's) against spin a sign of concern",
        "Sri Lanka's spinners ended India's 27-year streak",
        "Dunith Wellalage was chief destroyer this time out with figures of 5 for 27",
        "Avishka Fernando was part of Sri Lanka's most profitable partnerships - 89 and 82 for the first and second wickets respectively",
        "Pathum Nissanka (45) and Kusal Mendis (59) made important contributions",
        "From 171 for 1 they spluttered to 199 for 6. From midway through the 36th over when they lost Avishka, up until midway through the 48th - 72 deliveries to be precise - not a single boundary was scored, scrounging just 49 runs in the period",
        "Kusal Mendis was able to strike some powerful blows to help push the total towards 240"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Sri Lanka won by 110 runs",
        "India's struggles placed an even higher premium on Avishka's 96 off 102 earlier in the day",
        "Avishka was responsible for 36 of the 78 runs conceded to him, at a strike rate of 200",
        "Siraj was also guilty of bowling too straight to Avishka; of the 36 runs he conceded to Avishka, 32 were square or behind square on the onside",
        "Dunith Wellalage got the key wicket of Avishka, and also trapped Charith Asalanka on the crease",
        "Dunith Wellalage's best delivery was reserved for danger man Wellalage, who was done in by one that dipped and turned, pitching middle and spinning past the outside edge to knock back off stump"
