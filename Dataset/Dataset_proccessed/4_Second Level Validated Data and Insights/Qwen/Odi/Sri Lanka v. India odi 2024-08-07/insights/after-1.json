    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Rohit Sharma at toss: 'Plenty to play for, we've been challenged in the last two matches. It's clear as to what we need to do with the bat and ball. We've addressed it - what we need to do as a group. You got to give credit to the opposition, they played well and understood the position well. Another opportunity for us to correct.'",
        "Charith Asalanka at toss: 'We are going to bat first. It looks same like the previous two ODIs. Theekshana comes in for Akila Dananjaya. Guys are doing very well, we are in a good position. I would like to see someone score a hundred on this pitch.'"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Rohit Sharma after loss in second ODI: 'When you lose a game, everything hurts. It's not just about those 10 overs. You have to play consistent cricket and we failed to do that today. Little disappointed but these things happen. You got to adapt what's in front of you. With left-right, we felt it'll be easier to rotate strike. Credit to Jeffrey, he got six wickets. The reason I got 65 is because of the way I batted. When I am batting like that, there's a lot of risks taken. If you don't cross the line, you always feel disappointed. I don't want to compromise on my intent. We understand nature of this surface, it gets really tough in the middle overs. You have to try to get as many as possible in the powerplay. We weren't good enough. Don't want to look too much into how we played. But there'll be talks about our batting in the middle overs.'"

        "The atmosphere is buzzing yet again here in Colombo despite being the week day. The sun too is shining looks like another fabulous day for cricket.",
        "Pitch report by Russell Arnold: Dry pitch once again. We will have a similar game. Fresh pitch though. The groundsman has used the scissors to take out any grass. More cracks visible. Along with the turn, it can spit at you. It can be little more challenging for the batsmen. You got to be boring to get the runs here."
