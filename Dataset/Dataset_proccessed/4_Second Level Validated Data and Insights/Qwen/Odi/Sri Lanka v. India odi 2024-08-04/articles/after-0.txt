India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: Rohit Sharma speaks

Live Cricket Score, IND vs SL 2nd ODI: "When you lose a game, everything hurts. It's not just about those 10 overs. You have to play consistent cricket and we failed to do that today. Little disappointed but these things happen. You got to adapt what's in front of you. With left-right, we felt it'll be easier to rotate strike. Credit to Jeffrey, he got six wickets. The reason I got 65 is because of the way I batted. When I am batting like that, there's a lot of risks taken. If you don't cross the line, you always feel disappointed. I don't want to compromise on my intent. We understand nature of this surface, it gets really tough in the middle overs. You have to try to get as many as possible in the powerplay. We weren't good enough. Don't want to look too much into how we played. But there'll be talks about our batting in the middle overs."

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: Jeffrey Vandersay speaks

Live Cricket Score, IND vs SL 2nd ODI: "There was a lot of pressure coming into the side. I am coming out of a layoff. I had to something and it is easier to take credit. I want to give credit to the batters as well. They put on 240 runs and that helped me to bowl in good areas. Hasaranga is out No. 1 spinner. I got to understand the atmosphere of the team and team balance. I have to keep pushing myself. There was assistance in the wicket, I was trying to hit the good areas. Once I got my first wicket, that built up my confidence. Fortunately, I was able to take six wickets."

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: Washington Sundar during innings break

Live Cricket Score, IND vs SL 2nd ODI: Coming to Sri Lanka, there's always bounce. The last game and today, there was purchase off the wicket. Feel it's slower today. We have done a decent job to restrict them. 240 is good to chase. We have bowled well. From 150/6, it would have been better if we had given 20 run lesser. Looking forward to it (batting) and contribute to the team's success.

18:19 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: SL 240/9 (50 overs) vs IND in Colombo

Sri Lanka got 10 runs more than what they managed on Friday. Will it be enough we have to wait and see in the second innings. However, despite the fighting effort from the lower order it has been the same old same old from Sri Lanka. All the top-order batters got themselves in and threw their wickets without taking the responsibility to bat which was the primary reason for their predicament. As per India, spinners did well however, given the way Arshdeep's spell panned India might feel he could have bowled a lot more  better. Depending on the result of this game we might see a change in place for the third ODI on Wednesday. As of now we will take a short break and be right back. 

18:06 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 49 overs SL 233/7

Sri Lanka has breached the 230 mark. It has once again inspired lower-order batting performance from them. It is a competitive total however, the hosts need to pick the wickets when the ball is new. Once it gets softer seems like batting is getting a touch easier.

17:58 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 47.2 overs SL 216/7

Kuldeep Yadav comes back in and picks the wicket of Wellalage. The batter tried to reverse sweep the spinner and got the top edge and the ball was carried to the third-man inside the ring Shivam Dube who dropped a catch earlier of Kamindu Mendis. However, the batter did his damage late in the innings and so did Kuldeep with his spell. Not as convincing as Sundar but Kuldeep will take his 2-33 on this turning wicket. Sri Lanka still has three overs left and if they can manage to get around the 230-mark they will believe they can win this game today. 

17:48 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 45.2 overs SL 199/6

This is turning into another cracking cameo from Wellalage under the circumstances. Rohit took the gamble of bringing in Axar against two left-handers and Wellalage looked to take the spinner on and ended up hitting the first six of the innings and seems like that six not only lifted the crowd in the stadium but also injected some momentum in the Sri Lankan innings. This is a test for Rohit Sharma the captain here given the way the wicket has played 200 is a decent total and gives Sri Lanka a fighting chance anything around 230 the hosts will be right in it with five tweakers in their bowling arsenal. 

17:39 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 43.1 overs SL 177/6

Mohammed Siraj has been brought into the attack and this will be a different challenge for the Sri Lankan batters. If there is any reverse swing on over there are not many prospects in Indian cricket who can extract it as lethaly as him. However, for that,, he needs to bowl a touch fuller which might make him susceptible to be driven a few times but also presents the opportunities to pick wickets. However, the Sri Lankans don't seem to be too keen on playing big shots but just bat through the overs and get as many runs as possible in the end.

17:28 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 41 overs SL 166/6

Rohit has rolled his arm over with two left-handers in the middle. It was a gentle loosening over from the Indian skipper with not much of a turn for him. He is back to bowl another one here and would be interesting to see if he can get a lot more this time around. He did look rusty did the Indian skipper in his first over as expected as last he bowled was in 2023 World Cup against Netherlands. Meanwhile,, both Kamindu Mendis and Welalage are building a handy partnership here. Batting seems to be getting a touch easier once the ball is getting softer as the wicket doesn't seem to have the quickness and bounce to support the turn getting extracted by the spinners once the ball is getting older.

17:18 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 38 overs SL 147/6

Washington Sundar is done for the day and he did have an excellent outing today. He did look a little rusty in the opening game but today he has been spot on. The onus now is on other spinners to step up. Kuldeep still has four overs left and India are into the Sri Lankan lower order. Given Kuldeep is a left-arm wrist spinner the Sri Lankan lower-order might not have seen someone like him so it is an opportunity to close out the Sri Lankan innings early. Also, It might not be a bad ploy from Rohit Sharma to bring back Mohammed Siraj for a couple of overs and test the techniques of Wellalage and Kamindu Mendis.

17:09 (IST)
04 AUG 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 35.1 overs SL 137/6

Liyanage broke under the pressure the batter tried to push the ball forward chip it in the air and ended up giving a simple return catch to Kuldeep. It was a nicely tossed-up delivery from the Indian wrist spinner. Once again a set better got himself in and lost his wicket and as we update once again another set batter gets out. It is Charit Asalanka who tried to dab the ball through the third man region however Sundar managed to get an extra bounce which hit the splice of the bat and carried to the third-man inside the ring. Now India is into the lower-order for Sri Lanka.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 33 overs SL 136/4

Another partnership nicely brewing for Sri Lanka. They have been able to get starts and threw their wickets away which is criminal on this surface. Given the way this pitch has played today, it is hard for the new batters to come in and get adjusted to the pace of the surface. It will take about 20-25 deliveries to get used to the turn and bounce and that is where Sri Lanka has been poor. They have faced those number of deliveries themselves and instead of trying to increase the pace of the innings organically they tried to change the gears impulsively with high-risk shots and lost their wickets.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 31.4 overs SL 132/4

Washington Sundar has been brought back into the attack. It might be a small break that Rohit decided to give Sundar rather than a tactical move to bring in Axar after six overs in a trot from the off-spinner. Of all the bowlers bowled today,, Sundar has been the one who has found the right pace and lengths for this surface. Additionally,, he also has been slipping in variations for the right-handers which has caused them lot of trouble. He did not overdo it he just found the right balance. This is a top comeback for Sundar to the Indian colours having been away for a long time.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 29.1 overs SL 122/4

Rohit turns back to Arshdeep Singh at this stage of the innings. The idea might probably to see if there is any reverse swing on offer. This is a tricky period for Sri Lanka. They have a seamer and spinner operating in tandem. Given the way how difficult it has been to get after the spinners will they choose to take that extra chance against Arshdeep or will they be cautious and bat the way they are doing and take this game as deep as possible. If 250 is what they are looking to get on this surface they are on track for it but they have lost one two many wickets at this stage of the game which they need to keep an eye on.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 26.5 overs SL 111/4

Change of ends for Axar Patel who bowled his first six overs of the spell from the opposite end. At this end, there is a slight rough patch out-side right-hander off-stump nothing that will make the ball spit out of the surface but something that will be in batter's mind. However, irrespective of whether their is a rough patch or not whenever the ball has been bowled slightly slower through the air the ball did turn. As we update Samarwickrama who looked impatient through the knock went down the track and looked to hit the ball on the leg-side got the leading edge and Kohli at cover in the ring took a simple catch.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 24.5 overs SL 101/3

Kuldeep is getting a lot of turn here. However, it has been too much and the ball is missing the edges of the bat as a result Kuldeep has not looked threatening so far letting the batters get away. However, Sundar from the other end is bowling closer to the stumps as a result the batters are forced to play at the ball and need to be wary of one coming in sharply or turning away pitched at the off-stump. The struggles against Sundar have been pretty visible from the Sri Lankan batters especially Samarawickrama who is trying various things to upset the rhythm of the bowler.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd ODI: After 22 overs SL 89/3

We have reached that passage of play in ODI cricket not much seems to happen. The batters are trying to look for ones and twos and the bowlers too are happy to just give away runs and not go for boundaries. This is where the ODI cricket tends to get a bit slow and difficult to watch and needs either the batting team or bowling team to do something different to push the game forward. However, given the way this wicket has played neither side might look to take that extra chance. They would like to do the basics right and surface take care of the rest of it.

IND vs SL 1st ODI: On a throwback wicket, Indian batsmen find the going tough

The slow pitch at the Premadasa was a throwback to the 90s. The seamers found movement with the new ball, but quick runs were in the offering too. Once the spinners came on, batsmen were in for a grind, where they had to indulge in ones and twos. The conditions dictated batsmen to play a different brand of cricket, from the 90s, which posed a challenge for both sets of batsmen from Sri Lanka and India. After a seven-and-a-half hour slugfest, there was nothing to separate largely ordinary batting from both teams as the first ODI ended in a tie.

With 231 to chase on a pitch that was only going to slow further down under lights, if not for Rohit Sharma’s aggressive approach at the top where he mixed aggression with caution, India would have fallen way short of the target. At 71/0 at the end of 10 overs, India appeared to be cruising. But the Premadasa pitch comes to life under lights. It is a scene Indians have witnessed in the 90s as once the ball got soft, Sri Lanka’s spinners made a match out of this. Every time India surged ahead, the hosts hit back, a theme that repeated throughout the evening. When Shivam Dube smashed a boundary off Charith Asalanka over with 5 needed off 16 deliveries and two wickets in hand, it appeared over. But Asalanka dismissed Dube and Arshdeep Singh off successive deliveries to tie the match.

Playing the first ODI in over six months, the rustiness of Indian batsmen was evident. After Rohit gave them a head start in the chase, making a 47-ball 58 which included seven boundaries and three sixes, the required run-rate remained under control until the end. All that India needed was one big partnership if not two vital ones. But barring the 57-run stand between KL Rahul and Axar Patel for the sixth wicket, the India’s batting line-up lost the way as Sri Lanka’s spinners took 9 of the 10 wickets to fall. After Rohit’s 57, only Axar and Rahul managed to cross 30s as Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and Dube all squandered starts. (READ MORE)
