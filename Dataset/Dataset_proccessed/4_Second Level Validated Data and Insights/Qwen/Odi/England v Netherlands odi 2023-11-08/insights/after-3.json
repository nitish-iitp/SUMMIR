        "England captain Jos Buttler: 'We were desperate for the win. We got off to a great start, had a bit of a speed bump in the middle. We needed someone to stand up and take charge. There was some very smart cricket between Stokes and Woakes to get us to that score.'",
        "Ben Stokes: 'I'm more pleased for us to get a victory over the line, it's been a tough World Cup and nice to get back to winning ways today.'",
