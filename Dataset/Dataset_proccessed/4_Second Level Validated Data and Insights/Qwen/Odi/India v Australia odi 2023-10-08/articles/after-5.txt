IND v AUS, Cricket World Cup Updates

It was also the first time both the Indian openers were dismissed for a duck since 1983 in a World Cup match. Sunil Gavaskar and Kris Srikkanth were the openers who were dismissed for 0 against Zimbabwe in the match where Kapil Dev hit the famous 175.

This marks the first instance in ODIs where India has seen three batters out of their top four dismissed without scoring.

The first to go was Ishan Kishan as he chased a wide delivery from left-arm Mitchell Starc. Ishan, in his World Cup debut, got a thick outside edge that flew to Cameron Green at first slip. Next to go was Rohit Sharma who was pinned in front by Josh Hazlewood for 0 in the 2nd over. Rohit took a review but the decision stayed umpire's call and he had to walk back.

Shreyas Iyer was also out for 0 as he hit one straight into the hands of the cover fielder after a harmless delivery from Hazlewood.

Virat Kohli and KL Rahul joined hands to redeem India's innings after the huge early jolts.

Rohit Sharma also joined an unwanted list as he became the third India captain to get out for 0 in a World Cup match.

Earlier in the day, Ravindra Jadeja shone with the ball, picking up 3 wickets as India bowled Australia out for 199. Kuldeep Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah picked up 2 wickets each while R Ashwin and Mohammed Siraj chipped in with a wicket each on a pitch where spinners dominated proceedings in the first innings.
