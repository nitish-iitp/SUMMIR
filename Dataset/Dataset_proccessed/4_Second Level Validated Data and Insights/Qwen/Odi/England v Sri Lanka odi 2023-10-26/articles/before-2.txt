ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Venue and Pitch Report

The average first innings score in Bengaluru has been 235, but the pitch will play better than this. Expect a high-scoring game since the track has always been a belter with short boundaries. The teams batting first will look to post 300+.

Weather Report

A temperature of around 29°C, with no possibility of rain, is forecast.

ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Probable Playing XIs

England: Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (c & wk), Harry Brook, Sam Curran, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Gus Atkinson, Mark Wood.

Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis (c & wk), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushan Hemantha, Maheesh Theekshana, Dilshan Madushanka, Kasun Rajitha.

ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

Jonny Bairstow: Jonny Bairstow hasn’t done anything significant so far, but he is a quality batter. Bairstow might enjoy batting on a flat Bengaluru track and can wreak havoc against Sri Lanka. Expect Bairstow to make an impact in the game.

Joe Root: Joe Root has a tremendous record against Sri Lanka, and he will look to change his ODI numbers. His form might not have been as good, but Root is a good batter. Hence, Root can score big in the game.

Kusal Mendis: Kusal Mendis has been a consistent performer for Sri Lanka for a while now. Mendis can again score big on a fine batting track. Expect Mendis to play a good knock.

ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Gus Atkinson: Gus Atkinson has surprisingly been picked up by less than 30% of users as of now, making him a good differential pick. He has the pace to trouble the Sri Lanka batters and can snare a few wickets. Bowling in the slog overs will increase his probability of dismissing batters.

Dhananjaya de Silva: Dhananjaya de Silva has a decent batting record against England in ODIs. He can also snare a few wickets. Hence, Dhananjaya can be a good differential pick.

ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Players to Avoid

Dushan Hemantha: Dushan Hemantha might not be as effective in Bengaluru and can be avoided for this match.

ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Mega League Base Team

If ENG bat first:

Complete the team with three among Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Charith Asalanka and Harry Brook.

If SL bat first:

Complete the team with three among Sadeera Samarawickrama, Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Mark Wood.

ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction: Small League Base Team

If ENG bat first:

Complete the team with Charith Asalanka, Harry Brook and Kasun Rajitha.

If SL bat first:

Complete the team with Sadeera Samarawickrama, Ben Stokes and Dhananjaya de Silva.

ENG vs SL Dream11 Prediction

England might enjoy batting in Bengaluru and win the game.
