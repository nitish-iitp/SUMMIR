        "While England are currently at the bottom of the points table, Sri Lanka are just above them with a comparatively better NRR.",
        "England have won two tosses, while Sri Lanka did it three times.",
        "It is more likely that the Lankans will win the battle of the toss against the Three Lions at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on October 26.",
        "England look a better team on paper with some experienced players in their side. Ben Stokes’ return is also a plus-point for the side, meanwhile Sri Lanka are struggling with several injuries with Matheesha Pathirana also doubtful for the remainder of the tournament.",
        "We feel that England will come out on top in this fixture."
