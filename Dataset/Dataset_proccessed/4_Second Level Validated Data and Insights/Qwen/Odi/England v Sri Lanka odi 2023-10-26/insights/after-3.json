        "England suffered a 229-run defeat against South Africa at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.",
        "England chose to bat after winning the toss but collapsed to 85-5 and then from 122-5 to 156 all out, the lowest ODI all-out team total in Bengaluru.",
        "Ben Stokes was the only batter to cross 40 as he tried to hold one end up.",
        "With the fall of Ben Stokes' wicket in the 31st over, England’s hopes of putting up a competitive total vanished as they were bowled out two overs later.",
        "This performance by England has brought out lots of extreme reactions from the English cricket community."
