IND vs NZ Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

Shubman Gill: Shubman Gill can be an excellent captain in the fantasy teams. Gill has always done quite well against New Zealand, and his technique will be crucial in countering the early movement. Gill can play a mammoth innings if he gets through the early troubles.

Virat Kohli: Virat Kohli is among the popular captaincy choices for this game. He has a terrific record against New Zealand, and his recent form has also been good. Expect Kohli to play another fine innings against the Kiwis.

Devon Conway: Devon Conway is another popular captaincy option for this game. Conway has done exceptionally well this World Cup, and his expertise against the spinners will be vital to counter the in-form spin duo of the Indian team.

IND vs NZ Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Shreyas Iyer: Shreyas Iyer has surprisingly been picked up by less than 15% of users as of now, making him a good differential pick. Iyer has a decent record against New Zealand and is known to play long innings. If a few early wickets fall, Iyer can weave a fine knock.

Tom Latham: Tom Latham has been selected by less than 27% of people as of now. Latham has a sensational record against India and plays spin adeptly. Hence, Latham can play a match-winning innings.

IND vs NZ Dream11 Prediction: Players to Avoid

Mark Chapman: Mark Chapman will bat in the lower order and won’t bowl much, either. Hence, he can be avoided for this encounter.

IND vs NZ Dream11 Prediction: Mega League Base Team

If IND bat first:

Complete the team with Shreyas Iyer, Mitchell Santner and Mohammed Siraj.

If NZ bat first:

Complete the team with KL Rahul, Kuldeep Yadav and Matt Henry.

IND vs NZ Dream11 Prediction: Small League Base Team

If IND bat first:

Complete the team with Tom Latham, Shreyas Iyer and Mohammed Siraj.

Complete the team with three among KL Rahul, Daryl Mitchell, Rachin Ravindra and Matt Henry.
