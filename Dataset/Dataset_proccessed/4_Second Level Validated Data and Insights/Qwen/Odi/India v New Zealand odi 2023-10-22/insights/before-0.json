        "You can make the case that New Zealand’s tournament starts now. Four wins from four, with a fantastic win against England to kick things off, but from that point onwards they’ve won matches they’d have expected to – overcoming the Netherlands, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.",

        "The top three of Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli is the envy of the world, and it’ll require a remarkable performance from New Zealand to stop them in their tracks.",
        "Tom Latham (New Zealand) will be vital in combating India’s left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja. New Zealand have played safe but effective cricket so far in this competition. However, against an almighty India side, they’ll need to up the ante if they’re after a result."
