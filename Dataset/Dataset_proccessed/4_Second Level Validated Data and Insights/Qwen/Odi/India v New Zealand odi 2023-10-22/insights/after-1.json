        "Mohammed Shami took five wickets and Virat Kohli made a masterful 95 as India won the battle of the unbeaten teams",
        "India won by four wickets with 12 balls to spare",
        "Virat Kohli fell short of a century but steered India to victory over New Zealand",
        "Rohit Sharma’s verdict: It’s a good start to the tournament. We know the job is only half done. It’s important for us to stay balanced but to enjoy the moment as well.",
        "Tom Latham’s verdict: I thought we played reasonably well. We didn’t capitalise with the bat in the last 10 overs, but full credit to the way India bowled. With the ball we weren’t able to get a double breakthrough, which was a bit disappointing, but I don’t think we were far away. We did a lot of good things out there."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Virat Kohli takes two on the leg side, then turns down a single. Not everyone will love this – he is basically manipulating the game to get a century, as he did against Bangladesh – but it has made for the most extraordinary noise.",
        "Kohli tries to finish the match with a century-sealing six, as he did against Bangladesh, but holes out to Mother Cricket Glenn Phillips at cow corner. No 49th century for Kohli, at least until next Sunday, but that was a masterclass in how to conduct a runchase."
