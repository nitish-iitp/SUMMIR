        "England's last four innings have ended in scores of 215, 170, 156 and 129. Against Sri Lanka, they went from 45-0 to 156 all out. Today, it is 30-0 to 129.",
        "It is the first time they have lost five matches in a World Cup.",
        "England captain Jos Buttler: 'Very disappointing. At the halfway stage chasing 230 we fancied ourselves. But it's the same old story.'",
        "Rohit Sharma: 'Looking at where we were after the first 10 overs of our batting, it was important to put on a partnership like myself and KL Rahul did.'",
        "Matthew Henry: 'Unlike their previous defeats, England played well for more than half of this game, but those losses have sapped all of the confidence of a once great batting line-up...'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "England's response with the bat was once again pitiful as they were rolled for 129. A mixture of fine bowling from India, and some iffy shots.",
        "England captain Jos Buttler looked tired and frazzled. Hard to stay upbeat with the way this World Cup has panned out."
