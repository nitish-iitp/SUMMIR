        "Both teams are in the top three at this stage, and the winners of this game will feel very secure about their future",
        "New Zealand endured back-to-back losses to India and Australia as their smooth sail of a campaign hit a rough patch amid a growing list of niggles",
        "South Africa have been gung-ho, proving their only loss - to Netherlands - was an aberration, their batting depth looking increasingly menacing and bowling effective enough, as they were expected to be",
        "Their one-wicket win over Pakistan in Chennai the other night saved them from that dreaded word that had begun doing the rounds even as their lower order collapsed, before Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi saw them home",
        "A favourable result in Pune will further underpin their status as one of the dominant teams at this World Cup",
        "South Africa's seven 300-plus totals in a row batting first in ODIs - including four this World Cup - is the longest streak in the game",
        "South Africa's pace pack has taken 44 wickets at an average and a strike rate of 23.3 and 23.5, respectively. Their wickets tally and their bowling strike rate are the best for a team in this World Cup"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The pitch in Pune has been slightly skiddy. Also, the dew factor has played a role in the matches hosted by the MCA Stadium. The captain winning the toss may elect to field in today's match at this venue",
        "The sky will be mostly sunny and clear, with periodic clouds during the match hours in Pune. Rain isn't expected to play any role in this game, and the temperature will loom around 28° C",
        "Pune is unusually hot and dry for this time of the year, but the surfaces have been good for batting, with even bounce and excellent carry",
        "In the two games so far, dew hasn't had too big an effect, but it should be humid. The toss might not be too big a factor if the dew stays away"

    "Others": [
        "Men's World Cup matches involving the countries' cricket teams have been spiced with drama - the 2011 quarterfinal and 2015 semifinal, for instance - but this rivalry isn't as keen as it is in rugby",
        "The South Africans will believe they are capable of pulling one back this time. They are among the biggest batting teams at the tournament, and in Chennai on Friday they offered evidence that they have found a way to play under pressure by hanging tough to beat Pakistan by one wicket in the first close match of this World Cup",
        "The New Zealanders are themselves not averse to piling on the runs. And, of course, Friday's match was not a knockout game - which have tended to prompt meltdowns in the team now led by Temba Bavuma",
        "The South Africans missed Kagiso Rabada due to lower back spasms but he should be good to go on Wednesday",
        "The Kiwis are still awaiting news on Lockie Ferguson's Achilles and Mark Chapman's calf. Tom Latham was particularly non-committal about them at his press conference on Tuesday",
        "Tom Latham says his team can feel the love despite the nation's obsession with the rugby World Cup",
        "Rob Walter on South Africa's relationship with tight contests: 'The result could have been different, and then we'd be having a different conversation. But the important and heartening thing was to see how some of the guys played under pressure, and that we managed to find a way to get over the line. If we do it again and again, we'll start to accept that we're getting better at winning key moments in pressure games'"
