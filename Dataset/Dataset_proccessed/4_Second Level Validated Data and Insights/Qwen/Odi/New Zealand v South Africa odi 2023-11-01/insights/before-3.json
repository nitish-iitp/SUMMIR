        "Without certainty on Lockie Ferguson's Achilles and Mark Chapman's calf, it's difficult to see which way New Zealand will lean to pick their XI.",

        "Runs are not the issue for South Africa, and they showed against Pakistan that they can chase.",
        "Two of the three centuries in World Cup games between the teams - Herschelle Gibbs' 143 and Stephen Fleming's 134 not out - were scored in the same match, at the Wanderers in 2003."
