12th over: New Zealand 57-3 (Mitchell 6, Latham 1) A precious, skilful, maiden from Rabada . On the rope we see Coetzee dry himself with a burgundy towel straight from the guest room, I’m afraid I can’t tell you why he doesn’t have an official green and gold one.

An email wings in from Cressida Evans. Hello!

“Typing to you from sunny Salvador, pretending to work and following both the match (yay) and the Covid inquiry (boo). Have just seen this unexpected crossover:

“In her evidence to the inquiry Helen MacNamara said that at one point Matt Hancock, the health secretary, posed as a batsman while discussing Covid. “They bowl them at me, I knock them away,” Hancock said. [insert ‘eyes rolling out my head’ emoji here]

“Just wondering if the OBO hive mind could let me know exactly where they think Mr Hancock would fit into England’s current WC team?”

11th over: New Zealand 57-3 (Mitchell 6, Latham 1)Tricky. tricky: New Zealand must rebuild alongside the pulsing rhythm of a creeping run-rate. Young falls, the ball after pulling Coetzee to the rope with vigour.

WICKET! Young c de Kock b Coetzee 33 (New Zealand 56-3)

Young squeezes his eyes tightly shut in disappointment, after edging a sweet ball from Coetzee into the gloves.

10th over: New Zealand 51-2 (Young 28, Mitchell 4), Mitchell 4) A bowling change, with Rabada replacing Ngidi. Mitchell gives himself one ball to get his eye in before playing an exquisite straight drive, head immaculately in position, down past Rabada for four.

9th over: New Zealand 45-2 (Young 28) RR on his toes, meerkat like, through the covers with a smile – his first boundary. But that, my friends, is that for young pretender. Jansen the power play destroyer.

“Hi Tanya,” Alistair Connor, in Lyon, hello!

“I note that NZ’s two defeats have been quite close. I expect them to get within a long shot again this time.

“My ambition is to see them get through to the final again -- as in the rugby (a clear moral victory, as the All Blacks scored the only try), and as in 2019.

I’m a big fan of moral victories. It’s like when the other guy gets the girl, but you know you’re the better person. “

Fully on board with this.

WICKET! Ravindra c Coetzee b Jansen 9 (New Zealand 45 -2)

Jansen’s extra bounce does it again. Ravindra goes for gold, pulling, the top edge soars, but drops, into the hands of Coetzee on the rope.

8th over: New Zealand 38-1 (Young 27, Ravindra 4) Young flicks four off his legs to Ngidi’s first ball, four more off the next, a pie, which is dispatched high and away over slip. Win predictor currently gives New Zealand just a 14 per cent chance of victory. Some interesting commentary on the radio, that Rassie VDD isn’t on the field – something a few South African batters have done during the tournament.

7th over: New Zealand 28-1 (Young 17, Ravindara 4) No easy runs for New Zealand as Jansen continues to probe and poke.

‘Afternoon,” Hello, John Starbuck! “For the first time, I feel that this match is the most crucial so far. The end is, however distant, just in sight, so we can begin a countdown.” I know what you mean, I can’t believe this tournament has been playing so long for only Bangladesh to be eliminated. It would feel wrong for either of these teams not to make the semis – but the jeopardy starts here.

14.25 CET

6th over: New Zealand 25-1 (Young 15, Ravindara 3) Young wriggles what looks a certain four through midwicket, brilliant fielding on the rope from Hendricks saves a run. I should have mentioned the crowd’s enthusiasm for Ravindra when he came in – a real star in the making.

5th over: New Zealand 20-1 (Young 12, Ravindara 2) New Zealand say thanks very much for the four byes that jackknife Ravindra and whizz past de Kock.

14.21 CET

4th over: New Zealand 14-0 (Young 11, Ravindara 1) More parsimonious bowling from Ngidi – though Young does pick up four through the loose fingers of Maharaj at cover.

“I thoroughly enjoyed yesterday’s limited overs game between Dominic Cummings and Hugo Keith at the Baroness Hallett Stadium. Hugo was serving up bouncers and doosrahs and yorkers and beamers. Dom was fending them off with all parts of his body and his full repertoire of reverse sweeps and ramps and top edged hooks. And the sledging, oh the sledging, top ****ing class.” Yes, obvious seriousness of the matter aside, the Covid inquiry is an incredible breeding ground for big dick swinging bristling machismo.

14.13 CET

3rd over: New Zealand 8-1 (Young 6, Ravindara 0) A work of art from Jansen first ball which leaves Conway foolishly bat dangling as it squeezes as close as possible without edging. But he’s picked up his man by the end of the over with another pearler. Very difficult work for the Kiwis to face Ngidi and Jansen first thing, with a run rate of more than seven ticking away in their heads.

WICKET! Conway c Markram b Jansen 2 (New Zealand 8-1)

Glorious! Jansen swings the ball away, with vigourous bounce, and Conway is stuck for room, edging the ball to a flying Jansen at slip.

2nd over: New Zealand 6-0 (Conway 1, Young 5) Ngidi starts with a cracking maiden, no freebies left from the trick or treat box.

14.01 CET

1st over: New Zealand 6-0 (Conway 1, Young 5) Jansen floats in, Conway drives uppishly, recklessly, and the ball top edges down to the fielder on the rope. Young plays and misses at the second but picks up a boundary next , turning the ball off his boots and down to the fine leg boundary.

My email, btw, is tanya.aldred.freelance@guardian.co.uk – will try and fix it above too.

Pitch report: Simon Doull peers at the surface. He says it looks the same as when the game started apart from the bowlers’ footmarks. He ponders the now mystical dew, says it starts to form around 25 overs so South Africa will try to use Maharaj before then.

Thanks Rob! What an innings, those South Africans just can’t put a foot wrong at the minute – drawing a small net curtain over the aberration against the Dutch. Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen were superb, David Miller’s 53 off 30 deserves a hat tip and to Aiden Markram faced one ball and hit it for six. The Kiwis must chase an intimidating 358, at more than seven an over – though they made 383 in the near miss against Australia. Brazenly hoping for a win for my 11 year old nephew who retreated to his room after the All Blacks lost last weekend. Not sure he’s come out yet.

“Thank heavens one Lance Klusener isn’t in this team,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “This SA team with LK in it would get 400+ every time.”

That’s a scarily good point. I was looking at his record at the death in the 1999 World Cup recently and it was astonishing – something like an average of 230 and a strike rate of 140.

13.30 CET

Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen made superb centuries, with van der Dussen accelerating spectacularly at the death. But never mind all that because de Kock is speaking to Harsha Bhogle.

They bowled really well up front, especially Boulty, and I felt quite scratchy. I felt like I couldn’t find my rhythm. I got a couple of messages from the guys on the bench to just bat through. I’m trying not to give it away; I just wanna keep batting. My career’s coming to a finish so I want to bat as much as I can.

I hope 357 will be good enough. If the wicket stays the same I think it will be, but looking at the previous games the wicket does get better under lights. We’re playing against a really good side so let’s see what happens.

Neesham’s last over cost 19, which means his figures are a grisly 5.3-0-69-1. South Africa did it again at the death, smacking 119 from the last 10 overs and 163 from the last 15. All that after Tom Latham became the fourth captain at this World Cup to put them into bat.

New Zealand need 358 to win!

50th over: South Africa 357-4 (Klaasen 15, Markram 6) Aiden Markram ends the innings in style, just like Viv Richards in 1979, except this was the first ball he faced. He picked a slower short ball and hooked it over fine leg for six!

WICKET! South Africa 351-4 (Miller c Mitchell b Neesham 53)

Daryl Mitchell takes a terrific boundary catch to dismiss David Miller, who was looking for his second successive six. He took the catch, threw the ball up before he stepped over the boundary sponge, then jumped back into play to take the catch for real.

Miller goes for a savage 30-ball 53, which included 40 off the last 16. One ball remaining.

Godspeed Jimmy Neesham, for you shall bowl the last over.

49th over: South Africa 339-3 (Miller 46, Klaasen 10) This is fascinatingly poised, which is another way of saying nobody really knows who is on top.

Boult misses his yorker by a couple of inches, if that, and is blootered to wide long-off for four by Miller. It’s still a terrific over from Boult – until Klaasen cleaves his last delivery over mid-off for six. Boult ends an extremely good spell with slightly unjust figures of 10-1-49-1.

South Africa have scored 144 from the last 14 overs.

48th over: South Africa 325-3 (Miller 40, Klaasen 2) David Miller came in at the end of the 40th over. Yet he still had the nerve to play himself in: 13 from the first 14 balls, then 28 from the next 10 – including a huge six over midwicket off Southee a moment ago.

“Did England really hit ‘only’ 76 sixes in 2019?” weeps Matt Dony. “I realise that’s a big ol’ number, but it felt like Morgan hit that on his own. I’m genuinely surprised.”

Yup. I’d have to double check to be sure but it was something like Morgan 22, Roy 12, Bairstow and Stokes 11, Buttler 8, Moeen 5, Woakes 3, Root 2, Plunkett and Rashid 1.

WICKET! South Africa 316-3 (van der Dussen b Southee 133)

Lovely bowling from Tim Southee, who bowls Rassie van der Dussen with a slower off-cutter. Van der Dussen heaved across the line, missed and was bowled via the pad. He goes for a punishing 133 from 118 balls, including 65 from the last 35 deliveries.
