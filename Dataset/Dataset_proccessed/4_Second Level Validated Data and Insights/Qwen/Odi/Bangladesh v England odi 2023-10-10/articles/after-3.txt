That’s all for today’s OBO. It’s been a good day for England and particularly Dawid Malan and Reece Topley. I’ll leave you with Simon Burnton’s report from Dharamsala – bye.

Jos Buttler’s verdict

It was a really good performance to bounce back from a disappointing first game. We stuck to our guns and played the way we want to play. There are always areas you can improve as well. We’d like to have got a few more at the back end of the innings, although I thought it was a fantastic score on that pitch. For Dawid Malan to get a big hundred is just what you need, somebody to stand up after the first game.

One of the challenges of the tournament will be reading the pitch and the conditions [and deciding which bowlers to play]. We’ve got great options so we can go with a different balance of spin and seam. Reece Topley’s early wickets were fantastic when you’ve got a score like that on the board.

The Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan speaks

It was a good toss to win and there was some help for the bowlers. We didn’t start well enough and if you give them a sniff, they will always come hard at you. They never looked back. We came back strongly in their last 10 overs but it was too late. And when you lose three early wickets, you’re not going to chase 365.

I say this with the utmost love for both: have England ever had a chippier opening partnership than Jonny Bairstow and Dawid Malan? I think there’s a filter for that on Statsguru.

If we all chip in and slag them off incessantly for the next six weeks, England will romp this tournament.

The player of the match is Dawid Malan

It’s been a long journey to get to this stage, so to get here is fantastic and to help win a game is great as well. I don’t know what it’s down to, maybe experience, but I hope it can continue.

[You seem to have improved against spin] Mmnah, I think sometimes people create a narrative that isn’t there, to justify their own writing or views. [The ability to play spin] has always been there. Sometimes I play good shots, sometimes I play bad shots; that’s cricket.

Having Joe Root at No3, who is so consistent, allows us all to play with freedom and how we see fit on the day. We don’t have to second-guess ourselves.

Once I get in, I don’t like to give it away. Maybe it’s down to hunger. I’m desperate to do well in this format and win games of cricket; to prove people wrong and prove my point.

England win by 137 runs

It’s their biggest World Cup victory overseas (by runs), and a good comeback from that miserable day/night in Ahmedabad. The stars were two left-handers: Dawid Malan, who transferred his bilateral form to the biggest stage with a career-best 140, and Reece Topley, who took four for 49 on his World Cup debut. That included an innings-busting new-ball spell of three for 18.

England’s run-rate is back to black, +0.55. In short, it’s been a good day’s work.

WICKET! Bangladesh 227 all out (Taskin b Curran 15)

The match ends in unusual style, with Taskin bowled twice in as many balls by Sam Curran. The first didn’t dislodge the bails, despite thumping the leg stump, but the second cleaned him up to complete an emphatic victory for England.

48th over: Bangladesh 227-9 (Taskin 15, Mustafizur 3) Mark Wood ends a fine evening’s work, in which the only deliveries below 90mph were deliberate slower balls, with splendid figures of 10-1-29-1. That’s an impressive comeback from 5-0-55-0 against New Zealand.

46th over: Bangladesh 221-9 (Taskin 13, Mustafizur 0) There’s a case for resting Wood against Afghanistan on Sunday, though it will depend on the pitch and how he pulls up after the flight to Delhi. He’s been very good today – not just the fastest the bowler but also by far the most economical, with figures of 9-0-27-1.

WICKET! Bangladesh 221-9 (Shoriful b Wood 12)

Mark Wood is tasked with ending this defiant lower-order partnership. He needs precisely four balls: Shoriful misses, Wood hits with a 91mph stump-sizzler.

45th over: Bangladesh 220-8 (Taskin 13, Shoriful 12) Apologies, a few technical problems there. You missed Shoriful slogging the new bowler Curran for a couple of boundaries. Rashid hared after the first and thought about diving before remembering where he was and how irreplaceable he is.

14.38 CEST

44th over: Bangladesh 209-8 (Taskin 12, Shoriful 3) Taskin is nothing if not a brawler, and he slog-sweeps Livingstone over square leg with feeling for six. Even in one-sided matches, and there have been a few so far, every team has net run-rate in mind. This isn’t 1999 you know.

“Interesting, while attending a dull school meeting and listening to a never-ending monologue by my head, to get a furtive glance at the cunning variations being proffered by Rashid and Livingstone, and follow the OBO,” says Colum Fordham. “Rashid’s wonderful googlies and orthodox legspin vs Livingstone’s eclectic mix of leggies and offspin. Both effective and promising for England’s prospects further on into the tournament.”

Don’t worry, my head does never-ending monologues too.

43rd over: Bangladesh 201-8 (Taskin 5, Shoriful 2) Rashid finishes with figures of 10-0-42-1. England probably can’t win this World Cup without him being near his best, and there were plenty of good signs tonight. His googly came out particularly well.

Sri Lanka finished on 344 for nine v Pakistan. Kusal Mendis’s barnstorming 122 from 77 balls was followed by an 89-ball 108 from Sadeera Samarawickrama. All the Pakistan bowlers took some tap, though Hasan Ali did at least pick up four wickets.

WICKET! Bangladesh 195-8 (Mahedi b Rashid 14)

An overdue first wicket of the tournament for Rashid. Mahedi pushed optimistically at a googly that ripped through the gate to hit the stumps.

40th over: Bangladesh 191-7 (Mahedi 10, Taskin 1) Livingstone switches to off-breaks for the new batter, the left-hander Taskin Ahmed, and turns the first two balls past his outside edge. That’s a cracking first over from Livingstone, who will be feeling better about life.

WICKET! Bangladesh 189-7 (Hridoy c Buttler b Livingstone 39)

Liam Livingstone completes an ODI version of the king pair: he was out first ball when England batted and now he has struck with his first ball. It was a perfectly pitched legspinner to Hridoy, who fiddled outside off and got a thin tickle through to Buttler. There was bounce as well as turn.

39th over: Bangladesh 189-6 (Hridoy 39, Mahedi 9) Rashid is again unlucky not to pick up his first wicket of the tournament. Mahedi is beaten, trying to slap the googly, and then cloths a straight drive just over Topley at mid-on. Figures of 8-0-35-0 don’t tell the story of a mischievous, menacing spell from Rashid.

“After not playing in the NZ shellacking, it’s great to see Reece Topley having some well-deserved success,” says Brian Withington. “I am also rather impressed with Mark Wood’s rhythm, accuracy and sustained pace. England are in danger of having a well-balanced and threatening bowling attack, an in-form upper order and Ben Stokes waiting in the wings. What can possibly go wrong?”

14.18 CEST

38th over: Bangladesh 186-6 (Hridoy 38, Mahedi 7) Wood continues, the ruddy-faced marvel. He looks spent, yet his pace is still consistently above 90mph. Hridoy drives sweetly for four, the first intentional boundary off Wood in his eight overs.

“Livingstone, I presume, will get a bowl at some point,” says Stephen Cottrell. “Wood is doing a great job but these thunderbolts will be needed in the next few weeks and LL has hardly had a spell. He needs to bowl, especially if Mo isn’t playing every week.”

Jos Buttler might try to massage his confidence by bringing him on when they get down to the bowlers. There’s an argument Nos 6 and 7 are England’s weakest link, so every run and wicket will help.

37th over: Bangladesh 180-6 (Hridoy 33, Mahedi 7) Rashid replaces Topley, with Bairstow moving to slip. Mahedi slugs a flighted delivery to mid-on, where Topley drops a relatively straightforward two-handed catch.

Rashid is also seeking his first wicket of the tournament, though as with Wood his rhythm looks fine. This has been a good day for England – not just because the result but also the performances of several key players who struggled against New Zealand.

14.11 CEST

36th over: Bangladesh 176-6 (Hridoy 32, Mahedi 4) Wood is starting to look hot and bothered, so this might be his last over. He’d love his first wicket of the tournament but it doesn’t feel as important as it did for Woakes earlier in the day.

Hridoy jumps inside a sharp short ball, which leads to an unsuccessful appeal for caught behind, and there are just two from the over.

14.06 CEST

35th over: Bangladesh 174-6 (Hridoy 31, Mahedi 3) No five-for for Topley, but he finishes an outstanding World Cup debut with figures of 10-1-43-4. His new-ball spell of three for 18 in five overs, including a peach to bowl Shakib Al Hasan, scuppered Bangladesh’s run-chase before it had started.

34th over: Bangladesh 169-6 (Hridoy 27, Mahedi 2) Wood – whose average speed today is a frightening 92mph – rams a bouncer past Mahedi’s nose. There’s no slip, which doesn’t impress the commentator Shaun Pollock, although Bangladesh have generally looked solid enough when Wood has pitched it up. Their problem has been the small matter of scoring runs. Wood has terrific figures of 6-0-18-0, and four of those came off the edge.

13.59 CEST

33rd over: Bangladesh 168-6 (Hridoy 26, Mahedi 2) Topley is one wicket away from joining an exclusive club: only Vic Marks, Tim Bresnan and Steven Finn have taken five-fors at a men’s World Cup for England. Of those, only Vic ended on the winning side.

No fifth wicket for Topley in that over, but he does tighten England’s grip on this game by conceding only a couple of rums.

Bangladesh’s next game is against New Zealand in Chennai on Friday. England fly to Delhi to meet Afghanistan two days later, then they have almost a week off before a big game against South Africa.

32nd over: Bangladesh 166-6 (Hridoy 25, Mahedi 1) Wood returns with a remit to blow away the tail. I’m not sure Mahedi counts as a tailender, mind: he has a highest first-class score of 177.

Mind you, even Australia’s finest didn’t enjoy facing Wood this summer, and Bangladesh can only manage two singles. They’ve barely played an attacking stroke against Wood, presumably deeming it too great a risk even when the required rate is 11 an over.

WICKET! Bangladesh 164-6 (Mushfiqur c Rashid b Topley 51)

Mushfiqur tries to start the Bangladesh charge towards the finish line and falls flat on his face. After a series of low-risk singles, he suddenly slashed a short ball from Topley straight to third man, where Rashid took a comfortable catch. Mushfiqur goes for a decent 51 and Topley has four wickets on his World Cup debut. After all his injury problems, it’s a very nice moment.

30th over: Bangladesh 160-5 (Mushfiqur 50, Hridoy 21) Mushfiqur drives Rashid down the ground to reach a sensible half-century from 61 balls. He has at least ensured that, if Bangladesh lose, their net run-rate shouldn’t be beyond salvation.

13.40 CEST

29th over: Bangladesh 155-5 (Mushfiqur 48, Hridoy 18) Hridoy clips a loose delivery from Topley for four. There’s no swing now so this is a very different game. With every run, those new-ball wickets look more vital; that may become a theme of the tournament, although the jury is out for now after India’s win on Sunday.

27th over: Bangladesh 148-5 (Mushfiqur 46, Hridoy 13) Rashid is bowling nicely now, using all his variations. I know it’s easier to settle into a rhythm when batters aren’t unsheating the long handle, but this is still an encouraging performance. This is only game two and Rashid tends to improve as a tournament progresses. Okay, maybe not in 2021 when he took four for two in the first game.

27th over: Bangladesh 144-5 (Mushfiqur 45, Hridoy 10) Reece Topley returns in place of Woakes and goes round the wicket to the right-handers. Mushfiqur gets a much-needed boundary off his last ball, pinging a lovely drive through extra cover.

25th over: Bangladesh 135-5 (Mushfiqur 38, Hridoy 8) The pitch is getting more awkward as the balls get older, and Woakes is taking the pace off quite a few deliveries. This is a good spell from him, 3-0-12-1 now.

Sri Lanka are now 255 for four from 36 overs against Pakistan in Hyderabad. Sadeera Samawickrama is going well; he’s 62 not out from 53 balls. If it wasn’t for Hasan Ali, who took three wickets including the rampant Kusal Mendis, Pakistan would be in even bigger bother.

24th over: Bangladesh 133-5 (Mushfiqur 38, Hridoy 6) That six from Litton Das aside, Rashid has bowled economically on a pitch that is offering little turn. Two runs from his third over give him figures of 3-0-17-0.

23rd over: Bangladesh 131-5 (Mushfiqur 37, Hridoy 5) Hridoy inside-edges Woakes wide of leg stump for a single. Wickets do wonders for a bowler’s rhythm, and Woakes is looking more like himself. Bangladesh need 234 from 162 balls. As asks go, it’s pretty big.

13.14 CEST

22nd over: Bangladesh 126-5 (Mushfiqur 35, Hridoy 2) Rashid continues and is milked for five singles. A good bit of analysis on Sky Sports shows that Buttler took a couple of steps forward before that slower ball from Woakes, without which the ball would not have carried, so he must have had a signal.

WICKET! Bangladesh 121-5 (Das c Buttler b Woakes 76)

A double bowling change, with Woakes back on in place of Curran. I thought we might see Topley, who has been a much greater wicket-taking threat, and that’s why I’m not England captain: Woakes has made the crucial breakthrough!

Litton Das thin-edged a slower ball through to Buttler and stood, head down, before dragging himself off the field. He batted masterfully to make 76 from 66 balls, but his wicket leaves Bangladesh in big trouble.

20th over: Bangladesh 116-4 (Das 74, Mushfiqur 29) Adil Rashid, another bowler who had a bad night against New Zealand and yes I know they all did, replaces Wood. After four singles from the first five balls, Das clumps a slog-sweep to wide long on for six. This is becoming a dangerous partnership; Bangladesh are essentially where Ireland were when Kevin O’Brien started to go berserk in 2011.

19th over: Bangladesh 106-4 (Das 66, Mushfiqur 27) When Mushfiqur first played at a World Cup, in the West Indies in 2007, Sam Curran was eight years old. Mushfiqur asserts his seniority with a couple of boundaries, a crashing drive through the covers and a very thick edge between point and backward point.

18th over: Bangladesh 96-4 (Das 65, Mushfiqur 18) Wood continues to bowl with eye-widening pace. Das and Mushfiqur are surviving comfortably enough, but anything more than that has been a struggle. Wood’s figures are 4-0-15-0, and the only boundary he has condeded came off the edge.

“Exactly who is granting recurrent Ashes experiences for souls these days?” wonders John Starbuck. “Has the ECB or ICC been developing a new money-raising strategy with an Elysian time loop?”

Look, they’ve got to compete with Major League Cricket somehow.

There’s another World Cup game today, and Sri Lanka are pumping Pakistan all round Hyderabad. Kusal Mendis, fresh from a futile 42-ball 76 against South Africa, has just fallen for a pulsating 122 from 77 balls. Sri Lanka are 229 for three after 30 overs.

17th over: Bangladesh 93-4 (Das 64, Mushfiqur 16) Turns out Sam Curran averages almost 150 between overs 11-20 of List A games, and he’s not looking very threatening here. He’s not bowling badly; he’s just more dangerous when the ball swings and/or when batters unsheath the long handle.

That’s not the case just now, with Bangladesh are pretty much taking a single off every ball. Hence Curran’s figures of 4-0-24-0.

16th over: Bangladesh 87-4 (Das 60, Mushfiqur 14) Wood’s first ball after drinks is edged short and wide of slip for four by Mushfiqur. I’ve got nothing else for you, apart from maybe a couple of singles.

Meanwhile, here’s an important public-service announcement from our colleague Jim Wallace.

That’s drinks. It does feel like England are cruising to victory, but then we said the same in 2011 when Ireland were five down and needed 215 from the last 25 overs.

14th over: Bangladesh 74-4 (Das 56, Mushfiqur 6) Das ducks under a sizzling, 94mph bouncer from Wood, whose rhythm looks as good as it is did during the Ashes. I’d cheerily sell what’s left of my soul to relive those seven weeks again.

Mushfiqur also ducks a bumper, then Das gets an inside edge just wide of leg stump. This is some hot hot heat from Mark Wood.
