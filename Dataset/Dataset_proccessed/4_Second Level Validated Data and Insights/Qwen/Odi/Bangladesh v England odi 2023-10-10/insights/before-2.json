        "Bangladesh can be loud too, and their perfunctory dispatching of Afghanistan at the same venue on Saturday was a satisfactory means of establishing their own credentials.",
        "Mahmudullah's brilliant hundred set the team on their way, in league with Mushfiqur Rahim's 89 from 77, while Taskin Ahmed's priceless extraction of Buttler all but sealed the deal.",

        "Bangladesh possess a wealth of players with the skill and experience to seize any given day, including Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who anchored an unruffled chase with 57 from 73 balls.",
        "Bangladesh have won five of the past nine ODIs between the two sides, and Dharamsala has hosted five completed ODIs in the past ten years, with four of those being won by the team batting second."
