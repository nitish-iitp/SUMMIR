India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Gautam Gambhir on Rohit - Virat's future

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: In a press conference prior to the Sri Lanka series, Gambhir said, "I can't say how much cricket is left in them. Ultimately it's up to them as well. It's up to the players how much can they contribute to the team's success because ultimately it's the team that is important. But looking at what Virat and Rohit can deliver, I think they still have a lot of cricket and they're still world-class players and obviously any team would want to have both of them for as long as possible."

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Charith Asalanka is one of our best players, says coach Sanath Jayasuriya

 

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: "I'm interim coach and I've only got these two series, but that's not how I think. When I was playing, and even now, I hate to lose. The players who are around now know that too. When I talk to them, I tell them that fans in this country love the game, and a lot of us, including me, have brought cricket into this country to a certain place," Jayasuriya was quoted by ICC as saying

"I've spoken about that a lot individually with players and as a team. In terms of facilities and practice, I've tried to do as much as I can. What I want is to create a good environment so they can be mentally in the right place and can play with confidence," the former Sri Lanka batter added

"Charith Asalanka is one of our best players in this (ODI) format, and we need to remember that. But when you get the captaincy, there is some pressure. I've been there too. You have got to give them a little time in that position. There are ten more players in the side and 16 in the squad. We all have to get together and give him the confidence too. At any moment, the captain could click. Charith Asalanka is someone who works really hard. He's very professional and communicates well," Jayasuriya concluded

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Gautam Gambhir knows what he wants from the team, says Rohit

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: "Gautam Gambhir has played a lot of cricket and he has been involved with franchise cricket also before. Obviously, it is going to be different from the previous support staff. Ravi Shastri was there before Rahul Dravid joined the team, every individual works differently. I know Gambhir for a very long time and we have played a little bit of cricket together. He has a very clear mind and knows what he wants from the team." Rohit Sharma said at a press conference

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Rohit Sharma's special message ahead of start of ODI series

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: "Wow! What a month it was. Mazaa hi aa gaya, flooded with memories, etched in history, aisa moment jo zindagi bhar humaare saath rahega. So much so that it still feels that I can put my pads on anytime for the shortest format, (chuckles), nahi yaar chhodo bhai, I had my time, I enjoyed it, it's time to move on."

Looking forward to the ODI series against Sri Lanka, the Indian captain says, "Time aa gaya hai for us to get back on the field, ek naye daur ke saath, ek nayi shuruyaat, ek naye coach ke saath. A partnership that is going to hold Indian cricket as paramount. It's time to hit the reset button aur ab time aa gaya hai for us to get back on the field. Wahi energy, wahi jazbe ke saath, Team India utregi phir ek baar maidan par, kuch naye aur kuch jaane-pehchaane chehron ke saath. This is Team India and this is your captain Rohit Sharma speaking. Let's go!"

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Ravi Shastri compares Rohit Sharma with MS Dhoni

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: "I think a giant in the white-ball game. One of the all-time greats. One of the best who have ever played. Will walk into any white-ball team they pick, irrespective of the era. Just because of the dynamic ability he has at the top," Shastri told ICC Review.

"The thing with Rohit Sharma is he plays the big shots, he scores quickly, but they're all cricketing shots. What amazes me, there's not an element of sloppiness. I mean, it just shows how much time he has on his hands to play the best and the power - people forget that this man is explosive. He's got power," the former India coach added

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Predicted XI for today

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: With Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul back in the setup for ODI series, the playing XI is likely to remain relatively settled. Perhaps the only confusion here is if coach Gambhir would likely to keep trusting his instincts with Riyan Parag even in the ODI setup or bring Shivam Dube back for the ODI setup.

Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (wk), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube/Riyan Parag, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Harshit Rana.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Rohit Sharma on expectations from Sri Lanka series

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Speaking at a press conference, Rohit said, "You get asked a lot whether this series is a preparation for the World Cup, or is this a preparation for the Champions Trophy. It's not a practice ground - it's still an international game. We will keep in our minds what we want to achieve, but this is by no means preparation or practice or anything like that. We want to come here and play good cricket and get something out of the series," 

"Of course, we want to try everything possible, but when you're representing the nation the quality of cricket should remain the way it is, and how we've played over the last few years. That is more important, rather than thinking about it as a preparation and saying let's go out and chill in Colombo. We don't think like that," he added
