        "Rohit Sharma said, 'The score was gettable, you had to bat well to get there. We batted well in patches. No consistent momentum. We had the upper hand, we lost a couple of wickets. With the KL-Axar partnership, we came back. Little disappointing at the end. Sri Lanka played well. In the end, it was a fair result.'",
        "India captain Rohit Sharma added, 'These things happened. Sri Lanka played well. In the end, it was a fair result. It (pitch) remained the same. It's not where you can come and play your shots. You have to dig in. The game shifted towards both teams at different times.'"
