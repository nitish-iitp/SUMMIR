AUS vs SL Score Highlights: Marcus Stoinis smashed the winning SIX as Australia secured its first victory in the ICC World Cup 2023. Sri Lanka bowlers fought hard but there was not much to defend. Australia won by 5 wickets
AUS vs SL Live Score Updates: Sri Lankan players congratulates Australia's Glenn Maxwell after Australia won by five wickets during ICC Men's Cricket World Cup in Lucknow (AP)

AUS vs SL Score Highlights: Mitchell Marsh and Josh Inglis led Australia towards their first victory in the ICC Men's World Cup 2023. Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 5 wickets as Marcus Stoinis slammed the winning SIX. Sri Lankan bowlers led by Dilshan Madushanka clinched some wickets to keep the chase tight, but didn't had much to defend. 

Dunith Wellalage dismissed Josh Inglis while Dilshan Madushanka clinched his 3rd wicket to depart Marnus Labuschagne. Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis are on crease taking the Australian innings to some final runs. 

Marnus Labuschagne and Josh Inglis are playing in a responsible partnership to take Australia towards the run chase. Josh Inglis smashed 50 and looked wonderful today under pressure. Sri Lankan bowlers are still attempting to get back in the game, but it seems too late now. 

Sri Lanka's quick fielding ensured that Mitchell Marsh is run-out and Australian low run chase is again in jeopardy. Josh Inglis has joined the chase now and Sri Lankan bowlers will continue to increase the pressure.

Sri Lanka's final score was low, but its pacer Dilshan Madushanka made that fightable as he dismissed David Warner and Steve Smith early to bring back Sri Lanka in the game. Mitchell Marsh is still looking dangerous and smashing boundaries, but Australia needs a good partnership from here. 

Australian openers David Warner and Mitchell Marsh began their innings on an explosive note. The batters are looking in an attacking mode and Sri Lanka is looking to grab some early wickets as Australia is chasing a low score. David Warner smashed a BIG six in the first over to start his batting well. 

Sri Lanka were all out for 209 in 43.3 overs against Australia in their ICC World Cup match here on Monday.

Opting to bat, Sri Lanka were off a great start with openers Pathum Nissanka (61) and Kusal Perera (78) adding 125 runs in 22 overs.

However, their dismissals, in the span of five overs, triggered a collapse from which the Islanders struggled to recover.

The Australian bowlers did well to stage a fine comeback with leg-spinner Adam Zampa showing the way with four wickets in the innings that was briefly interrupted by rain.

There were two wickets apiece for Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc.

The pitch at Ekana stadium is likely to offer more support to the bowlers under lights while short-of-a-length deliveries could be the key to getting batters out.

The Pat Cummins-led side currently sit at the bottom of the World Cup points table, with both Sri Lanka and the Netherlands ahead of them due to their superior run rate.

AUS vs SL Live: Naseer Hussain offers pitch report

AUS vs SL Live: Former English captain Naseer Hussain while delivering pitch report today said, "It is a pitch with a little bit of moisture in it at the moment. It's a little bit damp, because they've had these seen mats on it. So it's just holding it together because of that red soil, they don't want it to dry out too early. So there's a bit of grass on it, but you're right. It did a bit for the spinners it spun. It did a bit for the seamers later on, but it played nicely, Quinton(de Kock) and got a magnificent 100 on here. What the South African seamers did really well was a bowl the back of a length, Australia were a little bit full, but under light I think this pitch did a little bit more"

"Not only against us but even top-quality attacks have been taken apart and conceded 300 or 350 plus on these pitches. We cannot expect many changes instantly but as the captain, my duty will be to understand what they do at training and try to get them to do their best." Mendis added.

“I think in the last year, they're kind of the two teams that we've had the most trouble against. So, you know, the opportunity now is we've got some teams we haven't played for a while that we've had a lot of success against and be really confident when we go out there," he added.

Australia vs South Africa Live: Cummins says ‘every game like final now’

Australian skipper Pat Cummins says that every game now becomes like a final for his side after back to back losses against India and South Africa. He said, "Hopefully. I mean, we're obviously 0-2, so we've got to start winning and start winning quickly. Every game now becomes almost like a final. You've got to win just about all of them… Yeah, it's not ideal at all. Yeah, I think everyone's, well, after the last game was a little bit flat, but the last couple of days have been really good. Everyone's kind of rolled up their sleeves and want to try and get to work and make amends,"
