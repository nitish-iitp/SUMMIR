        "David Warner has had a below-par start to what could be his final ODI World Cup appearance.",
        "Scores of 41 and 13 for the southpaw has added to the Aussies' problems up the order.",
        "With form not on his side, Warner will look to start afresh against Sri Lanka.",
        "However, waiting in his wake would be Dunith Wellalage, who knows a thing or two about spinning the ball.",
        "Another Aussie star who hasn't hit the ground running in this edition is Adam Zampa.",
        "The spinner has leaked runs in his two games with no wickets to his name.",
        "However, it is too early to write off Zampa and the spinner knows, that one good spell could reignite his and his side's ambitions in this World Cup.",
        "Zampa, however, could face the wrath of an in-form Kusal Mendis, who has struck one fifty and one century in his two games.",
        "Mendis will look to continue his ominous form in the World Cup.",
        "The wicketkeeper-batter will also lead out the troops in place of Dasun Shanaka, who has returned home due to a thigh injury.",
