South Africa crushed Australia by 134 runs to cruise to their second victory at the World Cup, as Quinton de Kock struck his second hundred in as many matches and Aiden Markram made a half-century before the bowlers ripped through the five-time champions on Thursday.

Needing 312 to win, Australia made a shocking start losing their first five wickets for 65 runs and had no answer against Kagiso Rabada (three for 33), Marco Jansen (two for 54) and Keshav Maharaj (two for 30) as they folded for 177 in 40.5 overs with Marnus Labuschagne, who made 46, their only top-order batsman to fire.

South Africa’s win was built by De Kock, who made 109 while Markram hit 56 to help the Proteas post 311 for seven in 50 overs. Asked to bat first after the Australia captain, Pat Cummins, won the toss, South Africa made a watchful start and rode their luck before De Kock picked up where he left off in the defeat of Sri Lanka with eight fours and five sixes in his 106-ball knock.

The South Africa captain, Temba Bavuma, was reprieved twice while scoring 35 as Australia failed to hold on to difficult chances before Glenn Maxwell (two for 34) snared him, but the Proteas marched on as De Kock twice hit Josh Hazlewood into the stands in the 23rd over.

Leg-spinner Adam Zampa removed the dangerous Rassie van der Dussen for 26 but De Kock continued to plunder runs and brought up his 19th ODI century by pulling Cummins for a huge six shortly after the pace bowler had dropped Markram when he had scored only one run.

Maxwell bowled De Kock with one that crept through after hitting the left-hander’s bat as he attempted a reverse-pull and Markram fell to Cummins after a breezy knock, as the Australian bowlers put the brakes on South Africa’s scoring.

Cummins could have had two more wickets but Marcus Stoinis and Mitchell Starc put down chances on a sloppy day in the field but a double strike by Starc (two for 53) in the final over kept South Africa from swelling the score. In the event, 311 proved more than enough.

After Australia’s second defeat of the tournament, Cummins told Sky Sports: “I thought Quinton in particular batted really well, we couldn’t get a breakthrough, but from where they were, we were pretty happy (with 311). On that wicket we felt it was chaseable. It looked like hard work out there at night. Their bowlers bowled really well. It looked like it zipped around perhaps more than during the day but [we were] well off the mark. If we want to be challenging for this tournament you’ve got to try to find a way in all conditions. I think not much needs to be said tonight, everyone’s hurting. We’ve got a few days, the next game’s here as well, so we’ll regroup and try and make amends.”
