        "South Africa captain Aiden Markram: 'It was another good day. Tough to grind it out at the end, but we thought sticking to what we believe in would take 10 wickets. Sometimes you can rush it. But all in all a great day.'",
        "Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan: 'Yes, I thought we bowled well for the first 25 overs, got three wickets and they were going at five-an-over. Then they kicked on, I thought Quinton de Kock batted really well and the way Heinrich Klaasen finished it off, we didn't have any answers to it.'",
        "Markram: 'What Quinton did was superb and then Klaasen smashes it like we know he can. The top six/seven are different in their approach but it gels quite nicely. We will keep striving to put in big performances each game.'",
        "Al Hasan: 'There has been a lot of talk about whether Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah should bat up the order. They're doing their roles well but our top four or five are not scoring runs, need to score more runs so we can get more out of them.'"
