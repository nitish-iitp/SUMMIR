        "South Africa's mighty batting line-up has smashed a lot of runs batting first in 2023, but has struggled while chasing.",
        "Their last successful chase came against Netherlands in March this year, but the target was a modest 190, and the one before that was also in March, against West Indies, who failed to qualify for the World Cup.",
        "Chasing a target may not be the only challenge for South Africa on Tuesday. South Africa went down 2-1 in their last ODI series against Bangladesh, at home in March 2022, and their two losses to Bangladesh in World Cups - in 2007 and 2019 - also came while batting second."

        "Eight 300-plus scores this year. Six totals of over 300 in their last seven games, and two of them over 400. Three 300-plus scores this World Cup already, including a 229-run thrashing of the defending champions England.",
        "South Africa found out early in this tournament - by losing their second consecutive World Cup game across formats to Netherlands - what an upset feels like.",
        "If they are thrown the challenge of chasing a stiff one on Tuesday, they would want to prove that their batters can shine under pressure too."
