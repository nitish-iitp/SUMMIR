    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Temba Bavuma, SA Captain: We’re going to bat. It’s a good wicket, with nice grass covering on it. Want to make use of the good batting conditions. It might do a bit under the lights. We’re not used to this (heat) back home. The next couple of days is our focus. For now, we want to put our best foot forward. Quite a lot of cricket before the Champions Trophy. Some changes from the Afghanistan series. We have a debutant in Ottniel Baartman.",
        "Paul Stirling, IRE Captain: Very proud moment (to play 400 games), back to business though, we’ve got a game to win. It was a difficult decision at the toss, happy to have a bowl. With the dew coming in, it might get a bit difficult later, we’ll take it over by over. Gavin Hoey makes his debut today."
