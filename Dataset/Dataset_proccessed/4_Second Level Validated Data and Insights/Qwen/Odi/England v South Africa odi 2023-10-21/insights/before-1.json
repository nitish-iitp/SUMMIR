        "England fear another knockouts blow as South Africa look to put Netherlands defeat to one side",
        "South Africa posted a brace of World Cup records against Sri Lanka - the highest total of 428 for 5, and the fastest century, an exquisite 49-ball filleting from Aiden Markram",
        "England are capable of matching such feats - two days prior to Klaasen's onslaught, the returning Ben Stokes belted an England-record 182 at The Oval",
        "Chris Woakes and Sam Curran have been particularly underwhelming, which has had knock-on effects for the impact that Mark Wood and Adil Rashid have been able to make in the middle overs",
        "Reece Topley was immense in the victory over Bangladesh, the loss of Jofra Archer and the failure to find an adequate replacement for Liam Plunkett leaves England significantly short of the threat they carried in the 2019 campaign",
        "Ben Stokes, the team's'spiritual leader', will creak his way back into the fray to shore up a team that's running out of wriggle room",
        "Quinton de Kock already has two hundreds in this World Cup, and he had a temporary blip against the Netherlands, but his team-mates were hanging on his every word in the team talk",
        "England's only real selection call is Tabraiz Shamsi versus Gerald Coetzee, but the extra seamer in Coetzee seems the likelier route",
        "It's been historically close-fought in World Cup clashes, with England this time winning the head-to-head 4-3, including victories in each of their last two meetings, in 2019 and in 2011"

        "Runs in prospect: Mumbai's had to wait two weeks to get into the World Cup spirit, but the first track of the tournament will surely offer runs in abundance",
        "It's 25 years since England and South Africa last played international cricket and rugby on the same day. On day three at Old Trafford in 1998, England's cricketers were fighting their way towards what proved to be a series-turning draw. Their rugby team weren't so lucky, losing 18-0 in Cape Town"
