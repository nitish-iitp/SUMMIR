    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It’s incredibly disappointing. We came in with hopes of playing well but were well beaten. Lots of things didn’t go to plan for us during the first innnings – Reece Topley got injured and it was a tough 50 overs.",
        "Everyone put in a great shift - the humidity, cramps and all other challenges… the loss leaves with no room for error."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Proteas set England a huge target of 400 and the defending champions got nowhere near, falling 229 runs short in Mumbai",
        "England concede their biggest ever ODI total, fall to their biggest ever defeat and sit on three defeats from four in their World Cup defence"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The higher you rise, the harder you fall and England’s double world champions have fallen brutally hard. Despite being brought low by two defeats in their first three World Cup games they promised they could yet scale new heights; against South Africa they plumbed fresh depths: the most runs they have conceded and their biggest losing margin."
