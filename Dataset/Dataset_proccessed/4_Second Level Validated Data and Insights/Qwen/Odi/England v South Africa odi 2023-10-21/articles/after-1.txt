Righto, time for me to bid farewell. England’s capitulation has left me with an unexpected bonus of an hour or so’s daylight and the opportunity to take a hyperactive toddler for a squelch and a splosh in the local park and maybe even a restorative shandy by a fireside.

Well played South Africa, a well earned Castle lager or two awaits for Aidan Markram’s side after a swaggering performance in a crucial game. Commiserations to England, it’ll be ice baths and a lorra lorra Loperamide for a few of them before they head back to the drawing board ahead of taking on Sri Lanka in Bangalore on Thursday.

We’ll be back to cover the top of the table clash between India and New Zealand tomorrow, that should be a good’un. Thanks to Tanya for taking the early shift and to you for your company and comments. Right, ‘to the Regiment!’ Ta-ra.

Simon has sent in his match report – hot off the Wankhede wires:

They say the higher you rise, the harder you fall and England’s double world champions have fallen brutally hard. Despite being brought low by two defeats in their first three World Cup games they promised they could yet scale new heights; against South Africa they plumbed fresh depths: the most runs they have conceded and their biggest losing margin.

With a brilliant batting display, South Africa exposed all the frailties of their opponents, physical, mental and technical. England have not yet been definitively eliminated, but after this 229-run defeat it is only a matter of time. The grizzly picture is already clear: their old-timers thought this could be one last hurrah, instead it has been a bridge too far.

All things must pass eh? That was a brutal loss for England in the Mumbai heat, they were out performed comprehensively by South Africa in every department. Buttler’s side now need to win all of their remaining matches and even then they aren’t guaranteed a space in the semi-finals. To say they are up against it would be a wild understatement.

How do you even come back after a loss like that? In truth, England’s entire campaign has been flat and muddled from the get go, taking it right back to the non selection/selection of Harry Brook at the end of September through to their three selection changes today and failure to read conditions/ seize the initiative at the toss. I fear that it could be a chastening few weeks coming up for them.

England concede their biggest ever ODI total, fall to their biggest ever defeat and sit on three defeats from four in their World Cup defence.

Feels like end of days stuff for this side but...they were great days.

“Greetings James from an extremely windy Cape Town”

Back atcha from an exceedingly soggy Blighty, Trevor Tutu. Oh, wait a minute…

“I was sending ominous threats to my godson’s father, who lives in Richmond and supports England - seeing as how he is English - but they (the threats) were all about the rugby. I just wish that I had said some blood curdling stuff about the cricket.

I can, however, attest that the Springboks are using the services of the same witchdoctor as the Proteas have hired and that there will be no let up to the agony when the code changes from cricket to rugby for England’s sports fans.”

Victorious captain Aiden Markram speaks:

It was a fantastic all-round performance, I couldn’t have asked for a bigger effort. We were slightly surprised at the toss - we’d have batted first and so we were happy it worked out that way. It was good that our big quicks weren’t cooking in the heat… It was a great way to bounce back after the Netherlands loss.”

Matthew Mott has just done an interesting interview to Ian Ward and Nasser Hussain on Sky. First of all he says poor Reece Topley has got a suspected broken finger, heartbreaking news for Topley after all the injuries he has suffered, one of which saw him miss out on the T20 world cup last year.

Mott goes on to say that Jofra Archer won’t be coming in to replace the beleaguered Toppers:

Admission from head coach Matthew Mott that England were suckered into bowling first (in an oven) by the ground stats. Also confirms Jofra Archer solely in India for rehab, won’t be selected if Reece Topley broken finger confirmed

The head coach seems to admit they made a big mistake in choosing to field first at the Wankhede today.

JOS BUTTLER SPEAKS:

Here comes a particularly sad eyed England captain:

It’s incredibly disappointing. We came in with hopes of playing well but were well beaten. Lots of things didn’t go to plan for us during the first innnings – Reece Topley got injured and it was a tough 50 overs.”

I thought if we restricted them in 340-350 then we’d be in the game, bowling first is potentially a mistake in incredibly tough conditions. Everyone put in a great shift - the humidity, cramps and all other challenges… the loss leaves with no room for error.”

Apologies to OBO followers and, I guess, to Mark Wood - in the haze of boundaries and wickets I mistakenly put that Wood was the last man out when it was in fact Gus Atkinson that was skittled at the last.

Crikey. That was an absolute demolition by South Africa. After their loss to Netherlands they bounce back to trounce the holders, they look like genuine contenders for the trophy. Wood and Atkinson blitzed 70 runs off 32 balls for that final wicket but even that won’t spare England’s blushes. Give me two tics to wade into the mailbag and the post mortem/match analysis.

South Africa win by 229 runs!

A hail of boundaries… but then it is all over! Wood marmalised Maharaj for a four and two huge sixes before taking a single to bring Atkinson back on strike. GONE! All over now as Atkinson misses a skidder and sees his stumps splayed. A bit of fun at the end can’t mask the result, that was a hammering for England. Their World Cup hopes lie in tatters.

21st over: England 153-8 (Atkinson 35, Wood 26) Gus Atkinson! Eighteen runs blitzed off the over! England are going down in flames and a flurry of boundaries.

“It looks as though this England team is worn out and burnt out” emails Diana. Spirited stuff from Wood and Atkinson but this does feel like a loss to end an era.

That was special from South Africa. Hendricks is easy on the eye. But Klassen proved again he is a superstar. Marco Jansen as an allrounder is “growing” ☺️ into an outstanding all rounder.

20th over: England 135-8 (Atkinson 17, Wood 26) Ten runs off Maharaj’s over, Mark Wood is nearly pouched in the outfield once more but the balls lands a yard out of reach of David Miller in the deep. SIX! Wood gets down on his haunches and sweeps for a maximum.

19th over: England 125-8 (Atkinson 17, Wood 16) Good heart shown from Gus Atkinson who carts Ngidi away for four. A top edge is then nearly grabbed by Quinton de Kock behind the stumps but the ball lands just out of reach. The only blot on South Africa’s copybook that I can think of is a dropped catch by Hendricks off Wood in the last over. It was a goober, other than that it has been nearly perfik from the Proteas.

18th over: England 118-8 (Atkinson 11, Wood 16) Mark Wood deploys the long handle and smashes 17 runs off Jansen. England only need 282 more runs to win! Pah!

Simon McMahon is in elegiac mood:

“It’s hard to see how England recover from this, James, and not just in this tournament either. End of the road in ODI’s for a fair few in this team I’d say, most of whom will be in their late 30’s in four years time. Certainly the end of an era. What an era, though.”

As Nelly Furtado once trilled Simon: “Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?”

17th over: England 101-8 (Atkinson 10, Wood 0) Mark Wood arrives at the crease and it looks like this could be England’s final pairing with the bat as the camera pans to Reece Topley in the changing room sans pads. The big man injured his fingers earlier and England must not want to risk damaging his digits further on this now futile game.

Diving at full stretch to take the catch. Ian Bishop purrs over the fast bowler’s fielding on the tv comms. South Africa have been flawless today. England? Well…

Big snick from a wild hack and Rashid is caught at slip by Hendricks. The Proteas have been truly excellent in this game, doing everything right and with high skill. That was a sharp catch, the ball screeching to slip off the cue end of Rashid’s bat.

“Hi James – Netflix has just notified me of the immediate availability of Bodies - still warm presumably, given the temperature in Mumbai.”

Buddumchhhh Brian Withington.

Gus Atkinson arrives at the crease and shows that their are absolutely no demons in this pitch by clipping two fours off Coetzee.

WICKET! Brook lbw b Coetzee 17 (England 68-6)

This is NOT A DRILL. Coetzee has his second scalp of the over and Harry Brook is the man to go, a cross-seam delivery skidded on and scuttled into Brook low on the pad, that was stone cold dead. Brook reviewed but he knew he was cooked. In comes a poorly Adil Rashid, this is purely damage limitation for England now but with the scale of this defeat their World Cup hopes could well be done. By my ropey maths they need to reach 179 to avoid this being their BIGGEST EVER LOSS in a men’s ODI. It is a mauling in Mumbai.

10th over: England 67-4 (Brook 17, Buttler 15) England hit back by pulverising 17 runs off the over! Jos Buttler looks in fine fettle – clipping off his pads for four, bunting powerfully through mid-off and then lofting for six in the same area! Gerald Coetzee is the burned bowler, he replaces Jansen who took 2-18 off his four over opening spell.

9th over: England 50-4 (Brook 16, Buttler 1 ) Buttler joins Brook in the middle with England’s final hopes resting on this pair doing something remarkable over the next couple of hours. Brook scorches a cut past backward point for four and then climbs into a free-hit, clubbing a Rabada full bunger into the stands for six. He won’t die wondering I shouldn’t think.

8th over: England 38-3 ( Stokes 6, Brook 5) Stokes gets off the mark with a pull for four! He was hurried up by Jansen but got enough on the ball to see it to the fence. A push for one will see England’s talisman keep strike.

“Given that England look pretty well on the ropes now, an early trip home becomes ever more likely” opines John Starbuck. “In which case, Buttler might well decide to resign and other changes will be in hand too. Predictions?”

Hmm – I’m not sure Buttler will resign if they crash out, there will be some inquiry though, especially if this match turns into the full mauling it looks like it could be. Will not be pretty.

“PS Hope the M1 journey went OK, it’s murder around Sheffield because of the interminable roadworks.”

Thanks John – made it safely from South London to just down the road from Sheffield - to my parents house in the Peak District, lots of flood water around, England are sinking in Mumbai…

Brook picks a single and England eke out four off the over, scampering leg-byes, feeding off plankton. Stokes is yet to get off the mark and looks decidedly like a man who hasn’t batted for a month.

6th over: England 29-3 ( Stokes 0, Brook 5) Close! Jansen spears the hat-trick ball into Harry Brook’s pad but the batter just manages to jam the bat down in time, that was cleaning up the stumps good and proper. And breathe. Brook flays away in the air for four! Uppish from Brook but England will take whatever scraps they can at this stage. A nurdle to leg off the final ball sees the junior partner keep the strike.

This is turning into an absolutely brutal night for England. Defeat won't mathematically eliminate them from the World Cup but it's hard to see a way back given the manner of this one

England need him to get his Enrique Iglesias/Bonnie Tyler on here. In truth he looks a bit rusty, wafting at a few wide deliveries and failing to connect. Ngidi keeps him honest with a maiden, just a leg bye off the over.

WICKET! Bairstow c Van der Dussen b Ngidi 10 (England 18-1)

Bairstow clips Ngidi for four to the shorter leg-side boundary BUT he perishes next ball trying to repeat the shot! Huge wicket for South Africa, they are leaping with glee. Bairstow looked dangerous but he’s on his way - a full ball was there for the hitting but he mis-timed it and it went up and up into the inky Mumbai sky before falling into the hands of Van der Dussen on the boundary edge. Big blow for England.

Joe Root arrives at the crease, he was really struggling with cramp earlier, he clips for a single to get the legs pumping once more.

2nd over: England 14-0 (Bairstow 6, Malan 6) The lissom limbed and Jonathan Rhys Meyers cheekboned Marco Jansen is going to share the new nut. Can he wreak havoc with the ball as well as the blade? He gets some swing, a full ball hits the pad and the batters scamper a single. Malan then gets underway with a nice clip for four behind square. A push for two into the covers by Malan, the ball racing across the Wankhede baize. Close! Malan swishes at a length ball and it hits his knee-roll – The SA players umm and ahh about a review and eventually send it upstairs – NOT OUT – the ball was sliding down leg.

Ayeeechi! Bairstow lines up a huge moose into the leg side but the ball beats bat and stumps by a gnats eyebrow. BOSH! Bairstow connects with that one! A leg side half volley is pumped away over square leg for SIX. A leg bye sees Jonny keep strike.

“Good afternoon James, I’m putting my head above the parapet and my neck on the block. If Johnny Bairstow gets his eye in I can see him belting 200+ on this pitch, which will mean an England win with several overs to spare.” I admire your confidence Kim Thonger! Still on for this at the moment…

“Hi James”

Hello to you Nina!

"How’s Buttler’s captaincy looking under an hot and humid examination? Has he got a touch of the late Joe Root era indecisive/let games slip air around him? I’m watching the chase from behind the sofa, and it’s not even Halloween yet!”

Hmm – I think there are questions to be answered about choosing to chase - but hey - England have the batting line up to pull this off so I’m holding my tongue… for the time being at least. The pitch is flat and the boundaries are short. Here come the players!

I just don’t understand bowling first given the circumstances today.

Searing heat, massive pressure, famously flat pitch, opponents who’ve recently wilted in a run chase…

Why give them the freedom to put a score on?

Thanks Tanya and hello everyone. That was pretty brutal for England towards the end, 143 runs smited by South Africa in the last ten overs and a whopping 84 in the last five, Marco Jansen and Heinrich Klaasen pummelling the stands, Buttler’s boys looked well and truly cooked as they left the field, physically spent. They need a record run chase here with their World Cup hopes dangling by a thread.

A torrent of emails in my inbox towards the end, apologies that I haven’t been able to read/use them all. I think they can be best summed up by Paul Newcomb: “Oh dear,” he writes, “Looks like England are in the brown stuff.”

An England win is surely pie in the sky from here, even with their batting firepower, especially in such brutal conditions. The heat and humidity will drop – not sure about the pollution – but England have already spent 50 overs in the field. South Africa were astonishing – and, best of all, their bowlers have just spent the last three hours in air-conditioned comfort.

I’m going to pass you over now to James Wallace, who is refreshed and ready for Act 2 after spending the morning trailing up the M1. Bye!

England need 400 to win!

50th over: South Africa 399-7 (Maharaj 1, Jansen 75) Very nicely done by the inexperienced Atkinson, two wickets in the final over – just a shame about the run river that floweth beforehand. England conceded 143 in the last ten as South Africa let fly in torrid conditions. Klaasen was magnificent, Jansen made sure England would pay for every tiny mistake.

WICKET! Klaasen b Atkinson 109 (South Africa 394-6)

Klaasen shuffles across and loses his leg stump. An astonishing innings and the ground rises to him.

49th over: South Africa 394-5 (Klaasen 109, Jansen 74) Um. Let’s just say it was cruel of the director to show shots of Topley Snr in the crowd. 26 from the over. A flick for four from Klaasen off a low full toss to get things started. Then three scatter-gun sixes from the elegant Jansen, plus a drop from Curran running in from midwicket – on for god knows whom. Partnership of 151 in the blink of an eye.

Fifty for Jansen!

48th over: South Africa 368-5 (Klaasen 105, Jansen 54): Jansen’s turn. Shin high full toss yelled for six, wide yorker shimmied through the offside for four, short ball pulled for six to reach fifty. Poor Atkinson. This is already the highest total of the World Cup. Relief for the last three balls which just go for four.

“I am less concerned about impact of humidity and more about the particle pollution,” writes Sujit A “In last couple of years Mumbai has become one of the most polluted cities in the world largely due to the heavy construction (and not vehicle smoke). The construction particle matter is even more dangerous than smoke.”

“ Even the pristine Wankhede is not immune. While the local populace and the local politicians clearly don’t seem to mind it much, surely the ICC must mandate masks for players to protect their health and wellbeing!”

I’m afraid I don’t know if masks are the answer (too difficult too breathe and exercise?), but they should set safe levels and not play if they are breached.

A hundred for Klassen!

47th over: South Africa 348-5 (Klaasen 104, Jansen 35) Klaasen is felled by a Wood bouncer, flat on the floor for a couple of minutes. But, somehow, he is back: reaches his hundred by flaying a low full toss for six and pulling a wide one from Wood for four. Hundred off 61 balls – an amazing battle against the elements. He went from 50 to 100 in 21 balls. Flicks four more from the last to make it 15 off Wood’s over, who currently has bowled seven for 76.

“Greetings from Austin, TX,” Hi Anu!

”Regarding conditions, they are unsuited rather than unsuitable for the visiting teams. Just stroll over to nearby Shivaji Park to watch aspiring lads playing all day every day.”

46th over: South Africa 333-5 (Klaasen 90, Jansen 34) A waist high full toss from Willey is called no ball and slammed for six by Klaasen. A wide doesn’t help matters, Jansen flambes a short ball for six more. Not sure that dot ball to finish will blot out the rest of the over. Four to go
