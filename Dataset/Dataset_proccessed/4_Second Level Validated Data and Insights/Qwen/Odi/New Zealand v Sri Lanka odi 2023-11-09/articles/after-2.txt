CRICKET WORLD CUP 2023: NEW ZEALAND BOOST SEMI-FINAL HOPES WITH THUMPING VICTORY OVER SRI LANKA
BYANDREW WRIGHT

UPDATED 09/11/2023 AT 15:24 GMT

New Zealand ended their four-match losing run in style with a comprehensive five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the Cricket World Cup. The Black Caps did the damage with the ball before easily chasing down the 172-run target in less than 24 overs. The result means New Zealand have all but secured their place in the semi-finals with India, South Africa and Australia.

New Zealand took a big step towards the semi-finals of the Cricket World Cup with a dominant five-wicket win over Sri Lanka in Bangalore.
The damage was done by the Black Caps with the ball, bowling their opponents out for just 171 before needing less than 24 overs to reach the target set.

For Sri Lanka, the defeat was the seventh from their nine matches, bringing a disappointing campaign to an end and leaving them in jeopardy of missing out on qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy.

Sri Lanka were put in to bat first and got off to the worst possible start, losing Pathum Nissanka in the second over to slip to 3-1.
Fellow opener Kusal Perera was the one bright spark as he scored 51 from 28 balls but he was powerless to stop the innings quickly getting away from the Sri Lankans, as partners came and went.
Kusal Mendes was removed for six, Sadeera Samarawickrama scored just one, and Charith Asalanka fell for eight.
When Perera was caught by Mitchell Santner from a Lockie Ferguson delivery, the writing was on the wall for Sri Lanka at 70-5 within 10 overs.
The second half of the order, led by Maheesh Theekshana (38 not out), offered a little resistance, but Rachin Ravindra finally took the final wicket to bowl Sri Lanka all out for 171.
In response, Devon Conway and Ravindra combined for 86, half of the required total, before the pair were dismissed within eight balls of each other.

Angelo Mathews got back among the wickets when he got rid of Kane Williamson on 14, but the Kiwis continued to edge towards the winning line.
Confusion in the 21st over cost Mark Chapman, who was run out after Daryl Mitchell ignored his orders to remain at his crease as New Zealand fell to 145-4.
Mitchell’s aggressive knock of 43 came to an end when a mishit was caught brilliantly on the stretch by Asalanka, but needing just 10, New Zealand wouldn't be denied.
Glenn Phillips sealed the deal in style with a fizzing four to end a run of four consecutive defeats.
Only Pakistan, who play England next, and Afghanistan, who take on South Africa, can deny New Zealand a place in the last four.
