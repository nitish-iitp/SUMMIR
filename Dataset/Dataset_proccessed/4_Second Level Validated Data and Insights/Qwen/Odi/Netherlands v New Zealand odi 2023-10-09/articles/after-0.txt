New Zealand vs Netherlands Cricket World Cup 2023 Highlights: Mitchell Santner clinched 5 wickets including opener Max O'Dowd, dangerous Colin Ackermann and skipper Scott Edwards and led New Zealand to 99-run victory against Netherlands 
New Zealand vs Netherlands Live Score, Cricket World Cup 2023 Updates: New Zealand's Mitch Santner, third left without cap, celebrates the wicket of Netherlands' Roelof Van Der Merwe during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup (AP)

New Zealand vs Netherlands, Cricket World Cup 2023 Highlights: Mitchell Santner crushed Netherlands batting as he took crucial 5 wickets including opener Max O'Dowd, dangerous Colin Ackermann and skipper Scott Edwards. The Kiwis defeated Netherlands by 99 runs to register their second consecutive win and remain table toppers. 

Rachin Ravindra grabbed a big wicket as he departed in-form Bas de Leede and now Netherlands is in desperate need of a partnership. The New Zealand bowlers have complete control over the game and they are taking consistent wickets to increase the pressure.

Netherlands openers- Vikramjit Singh and Max O'Down started steady but Matt Henry displayed the magic of his pace soon as he bowled out Vikramjit Singh. Colin Ackermann is the new batter on ground. 

Will Young, Rachin Ravindra and Tom Latham powered New Zealand to 322/7 after 50 overs. Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren, Roelof van der Merwe bowled good spells but remained a little expensive against mighty New Zealand.

The strong New Zealand batting is not looking that effective against Netherlands. Paul van Meekeren bowled a beautiful deliver to dismiss Daryl Mitchell while Bas de Leede departed Glenn Phillips. 

Roelof van der Merwe and Paul van Meekeren took one wicket each and Devon Conway is sitting in the dugout with Will Young. Currently, Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell are on crease trying to take New Zealand innings forward. 

New Zealand openers Devon Conway and Will Young started slow but slowly gained momentum in the match. The batters are smashing boundaries in almost every offer now and the Netherlands is changing bowlers rapidly to slow the run rate.
