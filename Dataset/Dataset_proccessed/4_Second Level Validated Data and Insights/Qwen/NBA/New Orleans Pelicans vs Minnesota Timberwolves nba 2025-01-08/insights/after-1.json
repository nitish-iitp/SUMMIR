        "Randle had 16 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2 steals, going +21 during his 35 minutes.",
        "Finch noted that he has a lot of respect for how Randle has handled the different things the Wolves have asked him to do this season.",
        "Randle's fit with Rudy Gobert and Jaden McDaniels in the starting lineup has been questionable at best.",
        "There have been plenty of games this season where the Wolves have looked noticeably better and more fluid with Naz Reid on the floor instead of Randle."
