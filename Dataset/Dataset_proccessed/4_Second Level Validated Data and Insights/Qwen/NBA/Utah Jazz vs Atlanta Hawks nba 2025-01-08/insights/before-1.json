        "The loss effectively takes the Jazz to a 9-26 record and sticks them at 14th place in the Western Conference.",
        "The result stings in the heat of the moment. Yet, it keeps Utah on track for their ultimate goal of maximizing their chances of lucking out in this summer's lottery, and hopefully netting their first top-five pick in over ten seasons."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Young's shot followed shortly after a great make from the Jazz's own Collin Sexton, who cashed in a three-pointer to tie up the game 121-121.",
        "Lauri Markkanen, who showed up with a game-high 35 points on 11-21 shooting from the field and 8-15 from three."
