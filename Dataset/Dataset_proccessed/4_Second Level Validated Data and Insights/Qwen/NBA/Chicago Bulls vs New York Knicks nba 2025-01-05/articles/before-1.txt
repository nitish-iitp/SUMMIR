Chicago
Box Score & Player Grades: Bulls 139, Knicks 126 — January 4, 2025

By Elias Schuster,

7 days ago

Jalen Brunson – a Chicagoland native – was extra locked in to start Derrick Rose’s big night. The New York Knicks star was carving up the Bulls’ perimeter defense in an all-too-familiar fashion. He used his elite combination of craftiness and strength to score 26 points in the first half. Karl-Anthony Towns also played a key part in making Chicago’s defense look like its early-season self, adding 17 points over his first two quarters.

Especially as turnovers stacked up and rebounds bounced in the wrong direction, this felt like a game the Knicks would control. Then, Zach LaVine and Coby White must have channeled their inner Rose. White nailed a buzzer-beater at the end of the first quarter to cap off a double-digit opening frame. By the time halftime rolled around, he and LaVine had combined for 35 of the team’s 63 points.

This dynamic duo looked eager to make the man of the hour proud. They carried this momentum through a 25-minute-long halftime ceremony into the second half. Chicago would proceed to dominate in a way we haven’t really seen all season. They shot 17-25 in the quarter and went 10-16 in the paint. Anything they wanted on the floor, they were getting. And it led to a ridiculous 41-17 advantage in the quarter.

Indeed, the Bulls were playing like a team that wasn’t going to spoil a franchise legend’s night. They remained in control during the fourth quarter and walked away with a crowd-pleasing 139-126 victory. Yes, I know we’ve talked plenty about the adverse effects of adding wins to the board this season. But this was a game that felt right to win.

Is there more to this season-high-scoring performance? Of course. But I’m writing this from my car in the United Center parking lot, and I’d be lying if I said my hands aren’t cold and my eyes aren’t fried. I spent the better part of the evening updating our live blog on my phone and documenting the full experience over social media. My brain is mad at me for all the screen time.

If you missed any of that and want to catch up on the Derrick Rose fun, check out the feed here ! You can also see his tear-jerking intro during the halftime ceremony in the post shared below …

Derrick Rose’s Entrance and Ovation Was As Incredible As You Expected (Watch It Here)

Player Grades

Once again, the brain is working at half-speed, so I’m going to keep these pretty short tonight!

Coby White & Zach LaVine – A+
Stats: 66 PTS, 24-38 FG, 12-19 3PT

Coby White was largely responsible for the long-range success tonight, as his nine makes were a new career-high. As for LaVine, he was in full attack mode downhill, making the Knicks pay for not having a sizable rim protector.

Nikola Vucevic – A
Stats: 22 PTS, 12 REB, 3 AST

Speaking of not having a rim protector, Nikola Vucevic carried his weight and finished 10-19 from the field.

Josh Giddey – B+
Stats: 15 PTS, 10 REB, 8 AST

Another well-rounded night from the young guard, who also made a key difference on the glass against a team that holds the fifth-highest REB% in the NBA.

Julian Phillips – B
Stats: 7 PTS, 1 AST, 1 STL

I know the stat line may not look all that impressive, but Julian Phillips helped give this team a spark during their dominant third-quarter run. His athleticism in the open floor was a difference-maker tonight.

Deadline Day, Injury Impacts Market, Signings, Hoffman, Pereda, and Other Cubs Bullets

The Wife’s car died last night in her work parking lot, so that was a mini-adventure. Got pretty lucky overall, but it made for some collllllld waiting. Today is the arbitration exchange deadline , so you can expect a whole lot of deals today, and maybe a few extensions around the game. The remaining arbitration-eligible players on the Cubs’ 40-man roster who’ve not yet signed a deal for 2025: Justin Steele, Kyle Tucker, and Nate Pearson. (Obligatory re-mention of the possibility of the Cubs extending Justin Steele, which is unlikely but desirable .) Marlins lefty Braxton Garrett is going...

This Might Be My Favorite Matas Buzelis Quote Yet

Matas Buzelis gets it. The former G League Ignite standout has expressed a rare sense of self from well before draft night. When standing in front of a mic, he dances the line between arrogant and confident like he is Suni Lee on the balance beam. Buzelis might call out the No. 1 overall pick in one sentence before stressing how much he still has to prove in the next. And that’s why his response when asked about the always-daunting “rookie wall” is the least surprising thing ever. K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Sports Network shared the following exchange...

LOL: LiAngelo Ball’s New Song Is Absolutely Everywhere!

I have to be honest, I didn’t have LiAngelo becoming the most popular of the Ball Brothers in 2025 on my bingo card. But, early on in the new year, that seems to be the case! If you haven’t heard yet, LiAngelo Ball is blowing up on the internet after getting his rap career started. His new song “Tweaker” is absolutely taking off, and several sports-related accounts are having their fun with it. For reference to how big Tweaker has gotten, the official audio premiered on YouTube on January 3 , and it has over 6.4 MILLION views as...

The Roki Sasaki Vibes Ain’t Great, Babe

To be clear, the vibes on the Chicago Cubs landing Roki Sasaki should never have been particularly high to begin with, and I’ve done my best to keep folks’ hopes in check from the jump . The rumors on the Dodgers – and then, at least lightly, the Padres – were just so strong from early on that it felt inevitable that the Cubs would be among the teams missing out. That said, if the vibes were low yesterday, they’ve gotta be a click lower now: On ESPN1000, @JesseRogersESPN says Roki Sasaki stuff is heating up, but he's not...

Are the Raiders a Ben Johnson Fit After Firing GM Tom Telesco?

While the Chicago Bears run it back with GM Ryan Poles, a pair of general managers elsewhere in the NFL were shown the door this week. The Tennessee Titans parted ways with Ran Carthon after two seasons, which may open the door for Bears Assistant GM Ian Cunningham to interview his way into a promotion. And after just one season in Las Vegas, the Raiders parted ways with Tom Telesco. The move happened just one day after the team dismissed Antonio Pierce as its head coach. Unlike the send-off Pierce got from the team in a statement, the announcement...

Cubs Acquire Reliever Matt Festa, Designate Miles Mastrobuoni for Assignment

While sorting out their arbitration situation today, the Cubs made a separate move, picking up reliever Matt Festa from the Texas Rangers in a trade for cash. Festa, a 31-year-old righty, had been DFA’d a couple days ago, so the Cubs must’ve paid a little more than the waiver price to get him. To make room on the 40-man, the Cubs designated Miles Mastrobuoni for assignment. The utility man hasn’t quite hit in the big leagues, even as he’s shown the ability to play solid defense all over. With the Cubs loading up on similar players this offseason (and...

Caleb Williams Gets Pranked, Robert Quinn’s Troubles, One Impressive Ohio State Lineman, and Other Bears Bullets

Day 6 of the Chicago Bears offseason is here and I am debating whether to make soup today and a cheesecake tomorrow or if I am better served doing it the other way around. It’s early enough in my day that I have options. Maybe I’ll figure it out after I get Bullets out the door. ICYMI: A new contender vying for the services of Ben Johnson has emerged. The Las Vegas Raiders are reportedly enamored with Johnson , who could be lured by minority owner Tom Brady and the opportunity to possibly choose his general manager. This is...

We’re Starting to See the Blackhawks’ Youth Movement (and that Excites Connor Bedard)

The Blackhawks beating the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday night felt significant. Not because the team with the worst record in the league beat one of the more talented, hotter teams in the NHL. But it was how they won the game — and who impacted the game. Connor Bedard got the headlines, and for good reason. He was flying all over the ice. His tenacious forecheck created the loose puck that turned into the first goal of the night. He crashed the net and appeared to score a go-ahead goal (that was taken off the board because he kicked...

Opinion: No ‘dumping’ by Denver of Venezuelan migrants in Aurora

Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman has reason to be upset with Denver Mayor Mike Johnston. Coffman said last week during a press conference that Johnston “dumped” migrants in Aurora who became targets for violent crime. But did Johnston really “dump” them there?

Blackhawks at Red Wings — Lineups, Broadcast Info, Game Thread

If you look at the standings, you’ll find the Detroit Red Wings sitting above only the Buffalo Sabres in the Atlantic Division. They’re 10-10-2 on home ice and have a minus-18 goal differential for the season. But then you look a little closer and realize they’ve won their last five in a row, are only four points out of a wild card spot and have games in-hand on teams above them in the playoff race. And it’s another Patrick Kane Revenge Game opportunity for 88. The Blackhawks, meanwhile, had a stellar performance on home ice and on national television...

More Bedard History, Kurashev’s Chance, Colorado Compliment, a Florida Classic, and Other Blackhawks Bullets

After a nice win against the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday night, the Blackhawks will now look to do something that’s been elusive over the past couple years: repeat the performance. After the game, Frank Nazar noted that the Blackhawks have some wins against really good teams this year. But stringing together strong performances has been an issue. Phil Thompson at the Chicago Tribune had an interesting quote from Avs head coach Jared Bednar in his mid-season report on Thursday: “I think the Blackhawks are in a really good spot now, because they’ve got a lot of these really good,...
