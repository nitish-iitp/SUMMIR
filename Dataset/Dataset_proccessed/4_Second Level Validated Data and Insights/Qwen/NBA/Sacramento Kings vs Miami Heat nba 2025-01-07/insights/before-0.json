        "Miami Heat got a 19-4 run and an eight-point lead as the Kings continued to struggle for decent looks against the HEAT’s secondary coverage.",
        "Haywood Highsmith tossed in a falling-away offensive board, the lead grew to as much as 10.",
        "Consecutive scores from Jovic got things off on the right foot as Sacramento, on their own back-to-back, just couldn’t find daylight inside.",
        "Miami was up by 17 that felt more like 27 given the grind-it-out nature of the evening.",
        "Herro halted an 11-0 run with a deep three at the shot-clock buzzer just as soon as the Kings closed within six.",
        "Miami fell behind five early in the second extra period, their shots falling short.",
        "A Highsmith three gave them life as they returned to a tie soon after.",
        "DeRozan pulled out a sidestep jumper, foot on the arc upon review, to go up three, and later another Sabonis offensive rebound led to a second DeRozan jumper, flat-footed with no dribble, to make it five."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "DeMar DeRozan missed a jumper in his wheelhouse with a chance to take the lead, then it was Miami's chance with 13 seconds left. Herro missed his pullup chance, well defended.",
        "DeRozan found the two biggest shots of an evening when he and Monk scored just 53 on 51 shots.",
        "For a time it looked like this would be another one you could chalk up to Miami's zone, such were Sacramento's struggles against the coverage.",
        "But one of the weaknesses of the zone is that defending an area makes it more difficult to box out a man, and with opponents tending to take more threes – which lead to longer rebounds – against zone it can create some high-variance rebounding situations.",
        "Miami has been an elite defensive rebounding team with Adebayo on the floor this season, as they often have – much less so with Adebayo on the bench – but the zone is the wrinkle that can change those numbers up, and 18 offensive boards leading to 23 second-chance points (only 1.00 points-per on putbacks, so relatively inefficient on all those opportunities) is how the Kings made their comeback and ultimately won despite and 82.4 first-shot Offensive Rating on halfcourt possessions."
