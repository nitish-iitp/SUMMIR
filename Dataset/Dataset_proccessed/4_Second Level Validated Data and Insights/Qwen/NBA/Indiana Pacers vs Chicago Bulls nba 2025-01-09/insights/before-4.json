        "The Pacers have won three in a row since the calendar flipped to 2025 and hold a winning record for the first time since winning the season opener.",
        "Indiana earned a 113-99 road victory over the Brooklyn Nets thanks to a balanced scoring effort. Tyrese Haliburton’s 23 points followed by Bennedict Mathurin’s 20 and Pascal Siakam’s 19 helped guide the Pacers to their third straight double-digit win.",
        "Mathurin, whose 16.7 points per game match a career-best, has recorded double-figure scoring in eight straight games.",
        "The Pacers broke out of their lull following last season’s Eastern Conference Finals run.",
        "The Bulls have won four of their last five games, including Monday’s comeback home win over the San Antonio Spurs.",
        "Zach LaVine had 35 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in the win, but it was Coby White who put the Bulls in position down the stretch to steal the game with a layup and a dunk over 7-foot-3 reigning All-Defensive first-teamer Victor Wembanyama."
