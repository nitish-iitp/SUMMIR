        "Chief among them, of course is that this was a matchup of two 1-6 clubs",
        "It's not yet clear if this was a permanent sea change or just a temporary reprieve from a doomed season start",
        "Rivers finally listened to his eyes and demoted Trent, who played just 7:52 in a blowout, and may become the team's tenth man (whenever Khris Middleton returns)",
        "Lillard and Antetokounmpo also pushed Milwaukee into double-figure lead terrain midway through the third quarter",
        "By 3:25, Rivers was subbing out his stars for good and calling it a night"
