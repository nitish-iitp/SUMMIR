N.Powell o20.5 Pts-127
1.27u
Powell's run of 10 straight games with 20+ points came to an end this week in a 2-game set against Houston. The Rockets limited him to 13 points and 8 points in a strong all-around defensive performance. Houston can do this to top scorers. They're holding opponents to the 3rd-lowest field goal percentage this season. They were 5th in 2023-24.

Tonight's matchup is much more forgiving. Utah has the 2nd-worst defensive rating. They're allowing the 5th-most points per game. The Jazz are allowing the 5th-highest shooting percentage. More importantly for Powell, Utah gets torched from beyond the arc. They allow the 4th-most made 3-pointers on the 5th-most attempts. They've allowed the 5th-highest 3-point percentage. The Jazz gave up the most 3-pointers per game and the highest 3-point percentage last season. Powell is taking a career-high 7.8 3-pointers per game. Nearly half of his points are coming from 3-pointers.

Kris Dunn entered LA's starting lineup the past couple of games. He gives the Clippers another ball handler who can get the rock to Powell. With Dunn on the floor, Powell has seen a 4.9% usage rate boost and an extra 3.4 shots per 36 minutes. Powell is already posting a career high in field goal attempts, and the addition of Dunn should further boost his volume.
