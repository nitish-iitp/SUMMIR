Buddy Hield continued his torrid start with a game-high 27 points, Stephen Curry went for 20 and the Golden State Warriors romped past the Utah Jazz 127-86 on Friday in Salt Lake City.

Andrew Wiggins snatched a game-high 13 rebounds and scored 10 points and Trayce Jackson-Davis contributed 12 points and nine boards, helping the Warriors go 2-0 on the their season-opening road trip. Golden State routed the Portland Trail Blazers 140-104 on Wednesday.

Brandin Podziemski scored 15 points, Moses Moody had 12 and Kevon Looney chipped in with nine points and 10 rebounds off the Golden State bench.

John Collins put up 14 points, Lauri Markkanen had 13, Keyonte George and Collin Sexton logged 12 apiece, and Jordan Clarkson managed 11 for the Jazz, who completed a winless two-game homestand that began with a 126-124 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.

The Warriors had only four points to show for the first 4:45 of the game and trailed by nine before Hield led a mostly reserve unit that quickly turned the game in Golden State’s favor.

Hield buried a pair of 3-pointers among eight points while Curry and Moody added long-range shots of their own, propelling the visitors to a 28-11, quarter-ending run that opened an eight-point advantage.

Acquired from Philadelphia as part of an offseason trade that saw Klay Thompson wind up in Dallas, Hield added 16 points in the second quarter, finishing the half with 24 points on 9-for-11 shooting overall and 6-for-7 on 3-pointers.

Golden State led 56-42 by the break, then coasted through a second half that saw all 14 of its rostered players see action for the second straight game.

Hield, who connected on five 3-pointers and totaled 22 points in his Warriors debut, was even better in his encore performance, going 7-for-9 from beyond the arc and 10-for-14 overall.

The veteran also found time for a game-high six assists as Golden State finished the night with 35 on 51 hoops.

Golden State finished 20-for-50 from outside the arc.

Curry connected just four times in 13 tries from deep, but Wiggins, Moody and Lindy Waters III backed him and Hield with two 3-pointers each.

Utah countered with just 9-for-42 success (21.4 percent) from beyond the arc. George made three of his eight attempts and Brice Sensabaugh two of his seven.

Walker Kessler was Utah’s leading rebounder with nine to go with just two points. Collins had seven rebounds and a team-high four assists along with his team-high point total.
