Victor Wembanyama continued his otherworldly play by scoring a career-high 50 points and setting a pair of records while leading the San Antonio Spurs to a 139-130 win over the visiting Washington Wizards in the NBA on Wednesday.

The game was tied at halftime and was still even five minutes into the third period until the Spurs finished the quarter with a 23-6 run that gave them a 108-91 lead heading into the final stanza.
