MANILA, Philippines -- The Cleveland Cavaliers are welcoming the new year triumphant, weathering a 35-point explosion by Austin Reaves to beat the Los Angeles Lakers, 122-110, Wednesday morning (Manila time) at the Crypto.com Arena in California.

Cleveland showcased why it is the top team in the NBA, leading by as much as 16 points against the home team.

Jarrett Allen posted a double-double of 27 points and 14 rebounds to go with three blocks, an assist and a steal. Donovan Mitchell added 26 markers on 8-of-20 shooting, including 6-of-13 from the 3-pointer.

Cleveland started the game waxing hot, going up by double digits, 29-14, in the first quarter after a pair of free throws by Darius Garland.

But the Lakers stormed back and cut the lead to three, 30-33, after a floater by LeBron James.

The two teams were kept in a close match through the next two quarters before Cleveland turned a 77-75 advantage with 3:44 left in the third to an 87-78 lead heading into the final frame after a 3-pointer by Caris LeVert.

The Cavaliers maintained separation as they started the fourth with a 9-2 run to push the lead to 16, 96-80, after a triple by Georges Niang.

The Lakers slashed the lead to five, 107-112, with 2:50 left after a trey by James, but back-to-back-to-back shots by Allen kept Los Angeles at bay, 118-107, with 1:28 remaining, closing the door on the comeback.

Evan Mobley added 20 points and six rebounds for Cleveland, while Max Strus and Darius Garland had 15 and 14, respectively.

Reaves had a near triple-double of 35 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. Anthony Davis chipped in 28 markers and 13 boards, while James scored 23.

The Cavs have won their eight straight game and rose to 29-4, while the Lakers dropped to 18-14 for the season.
