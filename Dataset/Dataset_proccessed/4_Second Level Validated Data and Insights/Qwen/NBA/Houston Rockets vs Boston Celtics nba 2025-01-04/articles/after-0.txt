Derrick White and Jayson Tatum combined for 43 points and the visiting Boston Celtics rode a brilliant offensive first half to a 109-86 win over the injury-depleted Houston Rockets in the NBA on Friday.

White scored 23 points and drilled six 3-pointers while Tatum scored 10 of his 20 points down the stretch of the first half to help the Celtics — who played without Jaylen Brown (shoulder) — cruise to victory.

Payton Pritchard and Jrue Holiday totaled six 3-pointers and chipped in 20 and 14 points, respectively, as Boston made 19 of 39 3-point attempts and overwhelmed the Rockets with offensive precision.

Houston could not keep pace while falling to 1-3 on its five-game homestand. Jalen Green led the Rockets with 27 points while Alperen Sengun added 14 points and seven rebounds. But Houston could not overcome the absences of Amen Thompson (suspension), Tari Eason (leg), and Jabari Smith Jr., who broke his left (non-shooting) hand during shootaround earlier Friday.

Both teams were scorching early, shooting a combined 11 for 16 while Houston pushed to a 15-12 lead by the 7:29 mark of the first quarter. But the Celtics seized control with a 10-0 run out of a timeout, with Holiday nailing two 3-pointers and Luke Kornet adding a pair of dunks.

Boston led 65-56 at the break. Pritchard, Tatum, White and Holiday combined for 51 points on 20-for-34 shooting including 11 of 20 from behind the arc. Boston committed one turnover in the first half. When Pitcher sank a 3-pointer with 8:43 remaining in the game, the Celtics led 93-72. Boston led by as many as 28 points in the final period. –Field Level Media
