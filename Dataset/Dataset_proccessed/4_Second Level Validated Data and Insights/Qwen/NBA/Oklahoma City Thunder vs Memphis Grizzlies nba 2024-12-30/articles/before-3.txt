Grizzlies vs Thunder Pick Analysis

The Oklahoma City Thunder will be completing a back-to-back of when hosting Memphis on Sunday but that should not have a big effect on how they play. Oklahoma City has covered the number in eight of its last 10 and will likely face a Memphis team that will be without star point guard Ja Morant, who injured his shoulder on Friday.
