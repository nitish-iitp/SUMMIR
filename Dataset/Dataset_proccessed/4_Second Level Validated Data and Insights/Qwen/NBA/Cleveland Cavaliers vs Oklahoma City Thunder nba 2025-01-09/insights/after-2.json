        "The game swung on the fact that Max Strus, Dean Wade and Caris LeVert made their 3s (10 for 15 combined) while Oklahoma City's role players didn't.",
        "Oklahoma City once again dictated the terms of engagement on Wednesday. Donovan Mitchell spent the entire game in the Dorture Chamber, scoring just 11 points on 3-of-16 shooting.",
        "Cleveland's role players made their corner 3s, and the rest is history.",
        "The lights certainly weren’t too bright on Wednesday. Allen outplayed Hartenstein.",
        "Mobley and Allen had 13 combined assists in this game, often passing to one another.",
        "The Thunder and Cavaliers play again in a week. Holmgren won't be ready to return by then, so we won’t see how he factors into this matchup ahead of time if this is indeed who we get in the Finals.",
        "The Thunder offense is by no means bad. It ranks eighth in the NBA. It’s just not quite as versatile as Oklahoma City would likely prefer."
