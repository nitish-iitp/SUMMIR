        "Raptors' starting lineup on Wednesday entered the game having played 19 minutes as a group in over a year on the roster together; the New York Knicks' starting lineup had played 19 minutes as a group, per game, over 33 games this season.",
        "Immanuel Quickley looked solid, scoring 22 points on 7-of-12 shooting, and was active enough to finish a bad loss with a plus-7.",
        "Late in that same quarter, the Raptors also forced a pair of shot-clock violations, showing that they can, in fact, defend when they lock in.",
        "Scottie Barnes finished with 18 points, five rebounds, five assists, and four blocks in this one, shooting 7-of-15 from the floor.",
        "Ochai Agbaji left the game in the second quarter after suffering a lower back contusion in a rebounding collision with Josh Hart.",
        "Eugene Omoruyi is joining the Raptors on a 10-day contract."

        "The Raptors' inattention to detail showed, too, like doubling off Brunson to help on OG Anunoby in an unthreatening elbow post-up position.",
        "There were more bench minutes to be had overall because Gradey Dick played just 20 minutes.",
        "Darko Rajakovic used his challenge at the end of the second quarter to try to save Jakob Poeltl from a third foul.",
        "The Raptors are back in action on Thursday in Cleveland (7 p.m. ET / 4 p.m. PT, Sportsnet One, Sportsnet+), against a Cavaliers team that beat the Thunder on Wednesday."
