Predictions

Predictions

Considering the recent form and statistical insights:

Mavericks’ Offense vs. Magic’s Defense: The Mavericks have shown they can score heavily, averaging well over 100 points in their recent matchups. Given the Orlando Magic’s struggles on the road, especially defensively, the Mavericks are likely to capitalize on this advantage.
