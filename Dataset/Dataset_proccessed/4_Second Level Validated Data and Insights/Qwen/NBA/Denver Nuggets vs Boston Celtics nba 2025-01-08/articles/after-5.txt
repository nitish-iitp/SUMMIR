Jayson Tatum and the Celtics closed a tough road trip with a 118-106 victory over the Nuggets (sans Nikola Jokic) on Tuesday, pulling away in the fourth quarter for a double-digit win.

Here are the takeaways.

Jayson Tatum took over late.

Tatum sat the first four minutes of the final period, but when he returned, he took over on both ends, scoring seven of his 29 points in the final seven minutes to go with a pair of assists, a steal and a block.

On a night when the Celtics weren’t particularly efficient and weren’t particularly impressive from deep, they rode Tatum for lengthy stretches, even though Tatum himself was off from 3-point range.
