Zaccharie Risacher Stats Tonight: No. 1 pick dominates Knicks in career night (Nov. 6) (Image Source: Imagn)

Zaccharie Risacher had himself a game against the New York Knicks on Wednesday. The Atlanta Hawks' No.1 pick endured a slow start after scoring six points in the first 10 minutes. He picked up his production from the second quarter easily, scoring 16 points in that span.

Risacher, who earned his seventh career start, was yet to record his first 20-point night, so doing it in one half was a special effort from the rookie. He was one of the key reasons the Hawks had a legitimate chance to win this game. Risacher shot 8 of 11 from the floor, including 5 of 7 from 3-point range.

In the third quarter, the Frenchman cooled off a bit, but he still scored five points on 2 of 4 shots, including a 3-pointer. Risacher stepped up in the fourth quarter, tallying seven points. He iced the game, making the final two free throws, giving Atlanta a 121-116 win.

Zaccharie Risacher reveals coach Quin Snyder's NSFW message

Zaccharie Risacher put up an impeccable performance against the Knicks in the Hawks' upset win. It wouldn't have happened without the Hawks staff and veterans instilling confidence in their top rookie after a shaky start to his NBA career. Risacher revealed after the game about how coach Quin Snyder motivates him with an NSFW (not safe for work) message, saying:

"He basically tells me to 'Shoot the f**ing ball.'"

Risacher took up his coach's advice well on Wednesday and delivered exactly as asked. He shot lights out, especially from deep, going 6 of 10. The 19-year-old also shattered a franchise record, becoming the youngest player in Hawks history to score 30 points.

Many were skeptical about Zaccharie Ricacher's ceiling, questioning whether he deserved to be the No. 1 pick. However, his latest exploits should not only change that narrative but also give him the confidence to put up impactful numbers nightly. He's meshing well with the rest of the team, especially Trae Young, so that's a great sign for the Hawks, who hope to turn their fortunes around after three consecutive mediocre seasons.
