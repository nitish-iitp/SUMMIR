        "The Washington Wizards couldn't come out on top in their 110-98 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night at home.",
        "The Wizards fell behind early after a sizzling start from the Pelicans, who picked up right where they left off from Friday night's game in New Orleans.",
        "Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma felt that the team came out a little flat and were a little tense at the beginning of the game.",
        "The Wizards find themselves doing that only a fraction of the time. It hurts especially when they don't start out strong, like they did against the Pelicans on Sunday night."
