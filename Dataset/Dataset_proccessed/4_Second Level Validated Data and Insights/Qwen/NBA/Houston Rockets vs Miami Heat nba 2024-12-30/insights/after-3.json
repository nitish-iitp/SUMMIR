        "Houston Rockets guard Amen Thompson threw Miami Heat star Tyler Herro to the ground during an intense altercation with just over 30 seconds left in the Heat's 104-100 road win over the Rockets.",
        "The scuffle resulted in four ejections for Houston -- Thompson, Jalen Green, and even coach Ime Udoka and assistant Ben Sullivan were thrown out -- and Herro and Terry Rozier were given the boot for the Heat."
