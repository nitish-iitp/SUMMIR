        "Antetokounmpo found a sliver of space and got to the rim for a potential winning layup, but missed it.",
        "Ziaire Williams made two free throws, giving the Bucks a chance to tie the score and force overtime, but Lillard missed a 3-pointer on a creative sideline out-of-bounds play by Antetokounmpo."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "The Nets are in the middle of what is supposed to be a tanking effort.",
        "The Bucks knew the Nets were going to try to be physical on the ball defensively and try to force them into turnovers and poor execution.",
        "Head coach Doc Rivers said, 'You gotta show up and be ready to play as a group.'"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Antetokounmpo said, 'I wish the layup went in. It’s all a rhythm thing. I missed like three or four right-hand layups, but OK, I don’t make excuse. I missed them. I hope I make them next time.'",
        "Rivers said, 'I thought we were going to win the game once we got it down. And I wanted to win it, but I wouldn’t have felt any better about it, only that you get to go home and watch a win where you didn’t play well.'",
        "Antetokounmpo said, 'When you go down 20, that’s when the clock starts for us. That’s when we start to compete. We can’t do that. We cannot put ourselves in the hole and then we just gotta dig out of the hole. It takes too much out of everybody.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
