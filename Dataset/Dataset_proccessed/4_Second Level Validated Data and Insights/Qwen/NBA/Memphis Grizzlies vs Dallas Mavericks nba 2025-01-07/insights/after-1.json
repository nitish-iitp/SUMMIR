        "Absurd Free-Throw Differential: The Grizzlies shot 27/35 from the free-throw line, while Dallas was 11/15. There were maybe a couple of iffy calls, but otherwise, Memphis was just much better at getting to the basket and drawing fouls, something they needed to do while being down so many star players. And in a game the Mavericks lost by 15, losing the free-throw battle by 16 was the key difference.",
        "An Unlikely Game-Changing Player: Jay Huff, who completely changed the game for Memphis. His floor-spacing ability, evidenced by a 3/6 performance from three-point range, opened things up for Jaren Jackson Jr., who had a monster game.",
        "No Go-To Scorers: Dallas' biggest issue without Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving is they have no one who can consistently get a bucket. Ideally, when Dallas has those two in the lineup, this isn't something they'd have to worry about. But when they're out, it's a noticeable lack of playmaking and shot creation."
