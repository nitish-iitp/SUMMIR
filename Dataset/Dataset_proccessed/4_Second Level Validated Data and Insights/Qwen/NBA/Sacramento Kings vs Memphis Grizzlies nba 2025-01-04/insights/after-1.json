        "Proud of the fight to take a lead after being down 14, after being down 15 at one point",
        "Disappointed",
        "We've got to set a different tone, especially on the road in the first quarter. We can't be bleeding points like this. You give up 138 points and score 133 and be okay with the offensive but defensively that is not our identity."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "After a flawless first three quarters, the officials whistled ‘Trip' for six personal fouls in the final frame.",
        "Next up is a quick trip west to the California coast. Jackson Jr.'s Grizzlies versus Stephen Curry's Golden State Warriors have a history, even if the game might be missing some star power."
