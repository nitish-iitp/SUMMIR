Despite Murray’s absence, Denver stormed to a 25-3 run to grab a 112-102 lead with 4:17 remaining. The run included a highlight-reel play by Braun, who leaped for a dunk over Gobert, the Timberwolves’ 7-foot-1 center.

After the play, Braun screamed in celebration and drove his shoulder into Gobert. The Timberwolves’ big man took offense, grabbing Braun and shoving him away.

Both players received a technical foul after officials reviewed the play.
