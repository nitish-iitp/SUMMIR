        "Scottie Barnes: 'Well, we got beat by 30, so not very well'",
        "RJ Barrett: 'I think we just didn’t play hard enough, top to bottom. We have to figure it out. Just playing hard, just being that team that we were at the beginning, fighting, we didn’t have our fight tonight, so that’s disappointing.'",
        "Darko Rajakovic: 'Our closeouts were not good. Every time we were supposed to rotate and close out to the three-point line to break the rhythm and to take away threes, we did not do a good enough job of that.... That's something that we're working on, and we're going to continue pounding the rock with that.'"
