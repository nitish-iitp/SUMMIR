LOS ANGELES LAKERS
Anthony Davis: Lakers Refused to Let LeBron James Sit vs. Kings amid Scoring Surge

Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis didn't want to see LeBron James come off the floor when the 20-time All-Star had the hot hand in Saturday's 131-127 win over the Sacramento Kings.

"Just when you think he's slowing down, man, he continues to show the world why he's the greatest," Davis said in the locker room. "To go on that stretch, he actually looked to the bench and was trying to come out the game. We told him, 'You're not coming out.' He comes out and hits another 3. He never ceases to amaze any of us because we just know what he's capable of and what he's able to do."

The Lakers outscored the Kings 44-33 in the fourth quarter and James was the engine behind the offensive outburst. He shot 6-of-6 from the field and had 16 points in the final frame.

LeBron finished with 32 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists to earn his first triple-double of the 2024-25 NBA season.

The Lakers are off to a 3-0 start and sit fifth in offensive rating (120.1), per NBA.com. All five of L.A.'s starters scored at least 16 points against the Kings, and the team went 14-of-34 from beyond the arc.

The early returns on first-year head coach JJ Redick are certainly encouraging.

JJ Redick is the real deal. Lakers offense is playing with so much motion. So many different layers to their actions. And AD has been unlocked. Similar roster, new process. Redick is the difference.

And Saturday was a reminder that James continues to perform at an incredibly high level for a 39-year-old into his 22nd season in the league.

The preseason expectations for the Lakers were probably about as low as they've ever been since LeBron first signed in 2018. Bleacher Report's Andy Bailey had them 13th in his Oct. 4 power rankings.

It's still really early into the new campaign, but Los Angeles could be a serious threat in the Western Conference.
