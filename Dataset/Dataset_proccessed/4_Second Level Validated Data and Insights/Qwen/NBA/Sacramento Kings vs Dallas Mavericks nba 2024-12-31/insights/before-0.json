        "The Kings clawed back in the second quarter, closing the gap and trailing 60-56 at the half.",
        "The Kings allowed a Mavericks run in the third, with Dallas pushing their lead to 9 at one point, but from the halfway mark of the 3rd, it was like a whole different Kings team.",
        "With a minute and a half left and a 14 point lead, Doug Christie got to send in the third string to close out his first win as head coach, and the Kings won 110-100."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "The Kings started the game looking like the same old Kangz. The execution was sloppy, the shooting was bad, and the Kings trailed an injury-and-illness-depleted Dallas Mavericks team by as many as 18 points in the first half.",
        "The Kings finished the first quarter trailing 37-23, a score made better by a falling-sideways three pointer by Keon Ellis to beat the buzzer.",
        "I’d seen this too many times before this season. A terrible first quarter, with a huge deficit, and then the Kings claw back to make it close at halftime, only to get blown out in the third quarter, come back again, and lose in the end. But not this game."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "The Coaching: I want to give Doug Christie his props. The rotations seemed a lot better tonight. Mike Brown was methodical with his substitution patterns, regardless of the flow of the game.",
        "Keegan Murray had another bad offensive outing. He played really good defense throughout the game, and had 6 rebounds, 1 assist, and 2 steals, but he managed just 4 points on 8 shots, and went 0-for-3 from deep. It’s just not enough output in 36 minutes of playing time, especially for a player we know is capable of so much more.",
        "The Kings had to play hard, come back from a deficit, and really dig deep to beat this Mavericks team. Dallas has built a respectably deep roster, but not deep enough for Dallas to push the Kings as hard as they did.",
        "The Kings were out shot from everywhere on the floor and gave up 29 free throws IMO, the only thing they can hang their hat on is that they rebounded well and got the win."
