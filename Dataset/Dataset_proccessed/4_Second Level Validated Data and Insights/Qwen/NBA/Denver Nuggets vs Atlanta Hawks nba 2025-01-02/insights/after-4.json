        "The Denver Nuggets are 3-1 in the last four games with Russell Westbrook in the starting lineup.",
        "The Nuggets have scored 132 or more points in the four games since Westbrook rejoined the starting lineup with the only loss coming against the league’s best record, the 29-4 Cleveland Cavaliers.",
        "Westbrook is averaging 12.8 points and nine assists in that stretch while sharing the playmaking responsibilities with Nikola Jokic.",
        "Jokic and Westbrook have quickly developed chemistry in their first season as teammates.",
        "Westbrook’s impact extends beyond the box score. On a team that hasn’t always had a consistent vocal leader, Westbrook quickly established the tone in his first season with the Nuggets."
