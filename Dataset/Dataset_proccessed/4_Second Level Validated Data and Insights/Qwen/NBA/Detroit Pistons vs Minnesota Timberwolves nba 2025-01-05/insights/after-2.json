        "Ausar breaks down the defense and Harris knocks down the open corner C&S 3P (BIG ANSWER!)",
        "Get another stop followed by a Duren finish",
        "THIS IS THE EXACT TYPE OF RUN THEY NEED IN THESE SITUATIONS!!!!",
        "They have answered every single Timberwolves attempt at a run with a bucket of their own to keep the lead extended here in the 3rd quarter",
        "Even that bucket from Sasser to end the quarter after back to back 3PM from NAW and Reid",
        "I like the game plan because they have not done a great job navigating screen this year, Duren seems to be more active doing this than drop AND you take the ball out of ANT’s hands",
        "LOVE this defensive possession from Detroit",
        "Cade going to get defended my a big time perimeter defender in McDaniels who has a lot of length AND has the rim protector in Gobert behind him",
        "Beasley has now made back to back C&S off PnP and Ghost Screens",
        "Gobert changes the trajectory of so many shot attempts",
        "NAW is a really good player, not having a great game so far in this one",
        "REID does some nice things off the bounce along with knocking down 3P"
