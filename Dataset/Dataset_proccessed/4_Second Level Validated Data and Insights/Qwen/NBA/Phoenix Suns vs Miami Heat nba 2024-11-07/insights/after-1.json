        "Jimmy Butler passed the ball in to Terry Rozier, who was immediately double-teamed by Royce O'Neale and Devin Booker, forcing Rozier's pass back to Butler to sail inside the three-point line, meaning he was forced to retreat dribble.",
        "Time ran out once Herro caught the ball, leaving them without a game-tying shot."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Herro has never shied away from open looks, or, in other words, aggression was not the problem. The former Sixth Man of the Year tallied more than 20 points on efficient shooting splits in four of the Heat's last six games. He concluded with 28 points, six assists, and three rebounds on 9 of 15 shooting against the Suns.",
        "For Butler, it's been a handful of games with totals ranging in the teens (15, 18, etc.) while Adebayo recorded more than 20 points just once this season. For the Heat to truly be competitive in the Eastern Conference, Butler and Adebayo must each average more than 20 points."

        "Haywood Highsmith shined in an increased opportunity, recording 19 points, seven rebounds, and two steals on 7 of 8 shooting.",
        "In a night where forward Nikola Jovic oddly played just five minutes, the lockdown wing was given a chance to thrive."
