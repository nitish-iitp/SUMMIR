SALT LAKE CITY – The Utah Jazz dropped the first game of 2024-25, falling at Delta Center to the Memphis Grizzlies 126-124.

The Jazz enter the season with a new look after finishing 12th in the Western Conference last season with a 31-51 record. Despite inking Lauri Markkanen to a long-term max extension, few expect Utah to make a push for the playoffs in a loaded West.

Jordan Clarkson, John Collins, and Collin Sexton return as veteran contributors from last season, but Will Hardy’s crew also has seven players in their third NBA season or less.

Center Walker Kessler and guard Johnny Juzang look to make a leap in their third year. Point guard Keyonte George hopes to take the next step after wearing down late in his rookie season. At the same time, fellow second-year players Taylor Hendricks and Brice Sensabaugh will try to show they belong in Hardy’s regular rotation.

Behind them is a trio of rookies and a smattering of veterans vying for playing time this season. CEO of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge brought in sixth-year veterans Svi Mykhailiuk and Drew Eubanks along with 15-year pro Patty Mills for some veteran leadership on and off the court.
