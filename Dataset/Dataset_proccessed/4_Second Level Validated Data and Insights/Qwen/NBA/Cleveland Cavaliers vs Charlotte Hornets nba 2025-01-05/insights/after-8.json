    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "I thought that we started a little slow, and when you're coming on the road and playing a good team like that, they definitely make you pay for every mistake you make... But we're fighting, we're competing, we're trying to find ways of having better offensive possessions so that it doesn't continue to put as much pressure on our defense",
        "He took full advantage of his opportunity to play today. It's just a testament to Nick continuing to put in the work with our Greensboro staff. He got some real, high-quality games there. They worked on the things that he needed to work on, and today he came out, hooped and balled and gave us the lift that we needed"
