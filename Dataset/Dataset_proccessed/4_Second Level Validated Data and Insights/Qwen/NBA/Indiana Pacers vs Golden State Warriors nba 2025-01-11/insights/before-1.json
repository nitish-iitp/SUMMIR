        "The Pacers started slowly from 3-point range, but Haliburton and Bennedict Mathurin turned the game with back-to-back 3s in the middle of that big spurt that put Indiana in control.",
        "Indiana took control with a 17-2 second quarter run that turned a 30-29 deficit into a 46-31 lead. Golden State never led again but cut the halftime deficit to five and closed within three early in the third quarter."

        "The momentum continues to build for Indiana, which looks like it's finally found its rhythm. Indiana has won all five games by 10 or more points, Haliburton has rediscovered his All-Star level, and with the Pacers getting healthy, their depth is helping, too."
