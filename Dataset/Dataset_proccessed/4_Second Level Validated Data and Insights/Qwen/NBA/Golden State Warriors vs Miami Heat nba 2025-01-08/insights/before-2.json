        "Steph Curry tied his season high with his eighth three right as the quarter began.",
        "Consecutive missed threes led to consecutive corner threes for Jovic, the second of which came with a foul.",
        "Alec Burks sank a triple with Miami up 18."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It’s a bit reductive to boil it down like this, but it always feels like a bit of a variance play from Erik Spoelstra – particularly on nights where the team is either shorthanded or on a rest disadvantage – when the team sits back in zone for most of the night.",
        "You still have to make your own shots, though, as having a center dropped all the way back in the paint gave him plenty of airspace – insofar as the airspace he requires is half that of anyone else – to knock down 8-of-17 from deep."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Jaime Jaquez Jr. did much of his damage early, punishing the Warriors' smaller lineups on one hand but also showing zero fear of a generational defender in Draymond Green on the other.",
        "Jovic hit those two corner threes, yes, but what continues to impress is the way he’s using his size with the ball in his hands.",
        "There’s some nice chemistry with Kel’el Ware, too, as Jovic twice passed the rookie open, essentially directing Ware’s movement by leading him with a look over the top when a defender turned his back."
