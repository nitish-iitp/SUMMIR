Bruce's Analysis:

The Pels made a belated rally on Saturday vs. Houston, but it still wasn't enough to get inside of the spread, and it was a ninth consecutive loss for 'Nawlins. It has been a tough go this season in the Big Easy, and with Zion and Brandon Ingram still out, there is simply no good news for a team that has lost 27 of 32, and 1-5 the last six vs. the spread. Tonight also the shortest price in a Pels game since facing a depleted Phoenix back on December 5, and the Clips enter having no new injury worries. LA in a good stretch, having won and covered four of five, with wins over the Mavs, Griz, and Warriors that span. Play Clippers

Mike's Analysis:

The Pelicans have lost nine straight games. Seven of those losses have come by at least five points. The Clippers haven’t played since Friday and enter this matchup mostly healthy. They have also played well on the road, where they are 9-5 ATS this season. Don’t expect the Pelicans to be able to keep this close.

Prop's Analysis:

DraftKings. This is the high-end of where we’ve bet Norman Powell’s points line, but I’m still seeing value in a very plus matchup. The Pelicans are a bottom 5 team against transition and spot-up points (Powell scores half his points via those playtypes). And with Herb Jones defending James Harden, Powell will have a much better individual matchup than his perimeter counterpart. Overall, Powell has cleared this line in each of his last five games.

Jason's Analysis:

The Pels continue to spiral - especially against decent teams 0 and the Clippers have been largely in good form lately. Clip have covered in 4 of their last 5 overall and continue to play stingy D. They also have cleaned up against bottom 12 teams in the Association - 7-2 ATS. NO is 4-13 ATS against top 12 NBA teams and 1-6 vs them ATS this month, failing to cover 4 of those spots by multiple possessions. Maybe they get a little bored here or take the game for granted, but getting rest to travel and coming off a stout performance vs the Warriors, I like them to tamp down the Pels, 21st on O rating at home. NO is -6 at home (24th).
