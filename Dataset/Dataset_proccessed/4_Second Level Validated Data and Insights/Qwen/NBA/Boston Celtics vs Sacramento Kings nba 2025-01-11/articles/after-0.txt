The Sacramento Kings are off and running under interim head coach Doug Christie, with Friday’s stunning 114-97 win over the reigning champion Boston Celtics setting a new mark for victory of the season.

Under Christie, the Kings (19-19) have rebounded from a six-game losing streak with a six-game winning streak, which has firmly planted Sacramento back in the thick of the Western Conference playoff race.

Several players have benefited from Christie’s new direction, but All-NBA center Domantas Sabonis has elevated his game to another level as the Kings continue to gain momentum —even with star guard De’Aaron Fox (glute contusion) having missed the past three games.

Sabonis put on a show during Friday’s win in Boston, scoring 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting and three-of-four from three-point range, but that wasn’t the most impressive aspect of the three-time All-Star’s performance.

Rebounding the basketball has been Sabonis’ calling card during his time in Sacramento, and a matchup against the Celtics would provide him with an opportunity to etch his name into the franchise record books.

Sabonis finished the night with a career-high 28 rebounds, establishing a new Kings record for most rebounds in a single game during the Sacramento era (1985-present).

The 28-board performance exceeded the previous high of 26 rebounds–a feat that was accomplished by Sabonis himself last January and Hall of Fame forward Chris Webber in 2001.

After leading the league in rebounds per game during the past two seasons, Sabonis (14.2 rebounds per game) has jumped back in front of New York Knicks center Karl Anthony-Towns for the NBA lead. The Kings’ big man also leads all players in double-doubles (33) and is fourth in triple-doubles (five).

In seven games under Christie, Sabonis holds averages of 18.7 points, 16.9 rebounds, and 6.9 assists per game on 56 percent shooting from the field and 66 percent from three-point range.

Sacramento has turned the corner, and with plenty of season to go, we are beginning to see this team showcase its true potential behind the dominant play from Sabonis and company.

The 2025 Sacramento Kings, everyone.

More Kings coverage from Sactown Sports

Riding a five-game win streak and 5-1 record since naming Doug Christie interim head coach, the Sacramento Kings looked to continue streaking as they began a three-game road trip in TD Garden against the Boston Celtics.

They did just that, holding the high-powered Celtics offense to double-digits en route to their 114-97 victory.

Without De’Aaron Fox for the third straight night, the Kings got notable contributions from across the board.

Domantas Sabonis led the way with an absurd statline, recording 23 points, 28 rebounds, and three assists on 10/15 shooting, including 3/4 from three.

DeMar DeRozan scored half of his 24 points in the fourth quarter. Malik Monk added 22 of his own while Keegan Murray (19) and Devin Carter (11) helped from the perimeter.

16 offensive rebounds, winning the turnover battle, and holding a Boston team that averages a league-high 49.8 three-point attempts per game to 11/41 from distance made all the difference.
