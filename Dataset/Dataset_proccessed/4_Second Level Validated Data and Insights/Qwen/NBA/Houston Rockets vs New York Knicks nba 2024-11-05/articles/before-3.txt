NFT: Knicks @ Rockets 8:45 Tip
Jon In NYC : 11/4/2024 11:51 am
Excited for the KAT-Sengun matchup. Despite giving Sengun the bag he has been playing poorly, shooting under 40% from the field, and only saw 21 minutes in their last game.

Also keep an eye out for Tari Eason, who has great per minute stats but they keep benching for Dillion Brooks for whatever reason.

Matchups should be interesting. I'd put Mikal on Green and Hart on FVV, hiding Brunson on Brooks, but really a number of possibilities.

Lets go Knicks

also doubtful, so we probably will be looking at some meaningful Kolek minutes.

Tyler the Creator breakout incoming
I hate these late starts....  
AROCK1000 : 11/4/2024 11:57 am : link
Boy the Knicks have a very difficult beginning of the season schedule....many of our games so far,and in the near future are against playoff caliber teams...
Even this Rockets team wont be an easy win...certainly not in their building
Its going to be interesting to see how Houston mstches up  
nygiants16 : 11/4/2024 11:59 am : link
looking at it, Houston almodt has to put FVV on Bridges and that is a matchup Bridges can dominate because he has that post fade..
Id play them straight up  
nygiants16 : 11/4/2024 12:03 pm : link
Brunson on FVV, Bridges on Green, Hart on Brooks, OG on Smith and KAT on Sengun..

Also going to be interesting to see how the Rockets handle KAT, Sengun straight up? or do they double and risk the Knciks getting wide open 3s
Tough stretch ahead  
larryflower37 : 11/4/2024 12:10 pm : link
4 of the next 5 on the road and they play every other night. Ton of travel.
I got tickets for me and the family for Knicks @ Pacers Sunday afternoon it should be a battle after the ass kicking we gave them at the garden.

Its nice to finally have a team that can actually make 3s at a decent clip...so the other guys have to honor it and play man to man down low...
Really liked Tari Eason

Thought he would be a perfect Thibs guy.
Couple of crazy stats through 5 games  
larryflower37 : 11/4/2024 12:16 pm : link
Knicks are
#2 in FG percentage @ 50.3%
#1 in 3 pt % @ 41.7 %
2nd in true shooting % 60.9%
2nd in Effective Field goal % 58.2%
2nd in offensive rating. 123.2
3rd in turnovers. 11.2 @ game.

Defense is 18th currently imagine when Thibs gets that going.
Stay healthy and this team is going to be tough to beat
Should be a fun one.

Last year’s Houston trip featured that bogus foul on Brunson.

The crazy thing about the offensive numbers is they havnt even gelled yet
As expected…

Matt Ryan has agreed to sign with Knicks but the specific structure of the deal is still to be determined. Ryan can be added on a two-way after Ariel Hukporti’s contract becomes official. Or he can sign a standard deal. If Ryan signs a nonguaranteed standard deal, it would give Knicks the minimum number of players required by NBA roster rules (14). It would also give them flexibility to re-sign Landy Shamet when he’s healthy and bring Ryan back on a two-way deal.

The first game blowout by Boston has to skew the defensive stats, so I’m reality they are probably much better than 18th on D

Smart roster management. I thought they'd sign Ryan to a non-guaranteed deal and then cut him on January 7th. I didn't know that they'd be able to re-sign Ryan to a two-way deal though after that.
I admittedly know very little about this Rockets team  
Mike from SI : 11/4/2024 2:56 pm : link
but was a little surprised that Vegas sees this as a very close game. So in my ignorance, I'm betting on our guys haha. (If I get extra crabby tn, now you know why lol.)
Here's the Knicks' schedule for the season:  
Optimus-NY : 11/4/2024 4:15 pm : link
New York Knicks Schedule 2024-25 - ESPN.com

The first ten games are below:


Quote:
Tue, Oct 22 @ Boston
Fri, Oct 25 vs Indiana
Mon, Oct 28 vs Cleveland
Wed, Oct 30 @ Miami
Fri, Nov 1 @ Detroit
Mon, Nov 4 @ Houston
Wed, Nov 6 @ Atlanta
Fri, Nov 8 vs Milwaukee
Sun, Nov 10 @ Indiana
Tue, Nov 12 @ Philadelphia


-The Knicks are 3-2 so far.
-If they come out of these first 10 games with a record of 6-4, then that'd be great considering the Knicks' injury situation and the strength of schedule.

The Rockets are a good team who is less than the sum of its parts. Jabari Smith never took off, but he starts. Dillion Brooks who I just think is bad, starts. Sengun is phenomenal but you basically need to build an offense around him and they didn't do that. Instead they let VanVleet and Green basically chuck and sort of take turns on offense but neither is an efficient shooter.

And then arguably their three best prospects come off the bench in Amen, Tari and Sheppard but they don't play enough to really impact the game.

They need a consolidation trade badly.

Until then, Knicks by 12
Is it me or did Stephen A cook KD?  
nygiants16 : 11/4/2024 6:46 pm : link
This was in response to KD calling Stephen A a clown..

Interesting he says on the clip that KD himself told the Knicks he was coming and then changed his mind at the 11th hour..

Not a great game last night. Good D by the Rockets. The Knicks resorted to Brunson playing hero-ball at the end, and it didn't go well.
This would’ve been a lively game thread.  
bceagle05 : 11/5/2024 10:47 am : link
Minutes police, horrific officiating, three points from the bench, terrible games from Bridges and Deuce, bad game from Brunson, Sims doing Sims things. And yet it was a close game in crunch time.
Brunson still not himself. Missing everything in the paint and  
LW_Giants : 11/5/2024 10:55 am : link
isn't hitting the clutch shots he was last season. I think he's frustrated with the physicality, which at times has gotten ridiculous, but he needs to find a way to play through.

Deuce gave them absolutely nothing and Sims is like playing four on five.
Knicks having trouble with teams who switch everything  
nygiants16 : 11/5/2024 10:55 am : link
to much mismatch hunting and 1 on 1 stuff making it easier on the defense..

When teams play drop and zonish type of schemes the Knicks are cruising..

Precious back soon and with the signing of Matt Ryan hopefully the bench gets a little better, Sims is atrocious

You cant say someone os missing everything in the paint when they are shooting 49%..

Jericho  
Jon In NYC : 11/5/2024 11:08 am : link
being +14 despite having 0 points and 4 fouls and a turnover in 16 minutes is early contender for funniest data point of the year.
Deuce was horrendous offensively  
Anakim : 11/5/2024 11:09 am : link
He couldn't hit a fucking layup.


But my main gripe is about Jericho Sims. Look, when we took him in the Draft in the second round, I was excited. He legit may be the most athletic big man in the NBA and he was a worthwhile gamble to develop. But it hasn't worked out. He's not even close to being the sum of his parts and IDK if he ever will be. He has a very low basketball IQ and aside from jumping really high and using his elite athleticism to occasionally overcome his shortcomings everywhere else, he has no real pluses. He should be traded/waived.


Play Hawk Tuah. He can't be any worse.
Can we also

They definitely need to utilize the pick and pop more, they are relying to much on mismatches but that is also part of gelling..

When they are going good the ball is flowing and moving when they struggle they revert to the one on one

All credit to the Knicks' FO and I don't think they are meddlers, generally. But I have to think Sims is getting the burn so they can create some kind of trade value for him, not because Thibs loves him. Huk, as raw as he is, is more a Thibs kind of player.

He's also not what the Knicks need, positionally.

As for the officials  
nygiants16 : 11/5/2024 11:35 am : link
its one thing to allow physical play, its naother to allow a team to grab and pull and shove when they get beat to keep a guy in front of them..

If we are going to allow that just bring back hand checking, its ridiculous, allowing Sengun who is a horrible defender continue to grab and push people out of the way defensively then let him post up and pound but you hit him back its a foul...

You're right, I should say "missing shots he normally makes in the paint in crunch time."

Deuce was just super off, won't happen most nights.

As many have said, Sims is just bad. He has the mind of an 11 year old in Dwight Howard's body.

I think they just decided to live with it for a few games, which also allows the starters to play a lot with each other and hopefully gel as soon as possible. But I think the super-thinness (if that's a term) is ending soon. They signed Ryan who's a 6'6" forward who can shoot, and converted Huk so he's not likely going to the G League. When Precious and Cam are back, which seems like it's going to be fairly soon, barring further injuries they should be OK. Still not the best bench in the league but should be serviceable, subject to the mystery of why Sims is getting the backup 5 minutes. I know Huk is raw, but I think he's already shown better defensive and rebounding instincts than Sims.

SFGFNCGiantsFan : 11/5/2024 6:34 pm : link
Del, agreed. For one, I think this team might struggle @ times in the regular season, but strikes me as one that is built for the spring when the real bullets are flying.
