Brooklyn Nets vs Philadelphia 76ers Prediction

The Philadelphia 76ers should be favored and should win, but that’s been the case for them all season. Yet here are the 76ers, six games below a .500 record, and they’re 13-19 ATS on the season. The 76ers allowed a massive comeback against the Kings and then got rocked defensively against the Warriors. You’re never sure what’s going to happen with the 76ers from game to game. The Brooklyn Nets aren’t good and aren’t trying to win roster-wise, but they compete and are 19-14-1 ATS on the season. The Nets just beat the Bucks in a massive upset. You can make money with the Nets and the points. Give me the free buckets, even if it’s more of a fade of the 76ers than anything.
