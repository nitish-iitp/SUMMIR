        "I think we were very prepared tonight. Like I said, we executed the game plan to a T.",
        "For a team that averaged 120 [points per game] last year and holding them to 103, our defensive game plan. We executed and were just trying to figure out ways to manipulate the game. [We] made it tough for Ant. He made some good looks. But for the most part, I think we just made it tough for him, making him shoot contested twos and threes. I think that our effort and energy coming out was really phenomenal and we just kind of sustained that for 48 minutes.",
        "Our guys really did a phenomenal job of executing our game plan. We installed a lot in the last three days and it was a little bit opponent-specific. But it was also just, we had 21 days of preseason to get all of our installs in. So we kind of delayed installing some stuff and we practiced it, we walked through it, we did some more today. That’s really encouraging as a coach and for our coaching staff that our guys can pick stuff up and then go execute it, not on the fly, but after having just a few reps."

        "Rui Hachimura said, 'I think defense. It was defense. We were more locked in on the defense, especially Anthony Edwards.'"
