        "Denmark advanced to the knockout phase of Euro 2024 thanks to a 0-0 draw with Serbia.",
        "Kasper Hjulmand's side have played three and drawn three in Germany, and they continue to fail to get the most out of some of the talent in that squad, particularly Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund, who was subbed off midway through the second half.",
        "When he was substituted after 58 minutes, it was entirely the right decision, and yet that felt like a result of the failure to create the right conditions for him to have an impact, rather than any technical or tactical failing on his part."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Denmark will now face tournament hosts Germany in the round of 16 in Dortmund on Saturday night.",
        "England, meanwhile, will play one of the third-placed teams from Group D, E or F the following afternoon.",

        "Novak Djokovic was at Munich’s Allianz Arena to support his countrymen against Denmark.",
        "Dragan Stojkovic has made multiple half-time changes in the three matches, but Serbia has lacked any real fluency and has underperformed.",
        "Do teams in the last 16 have anything to fear from Denmark? The answer is yes, especially with their center-backs being among the best group at the tournament."
