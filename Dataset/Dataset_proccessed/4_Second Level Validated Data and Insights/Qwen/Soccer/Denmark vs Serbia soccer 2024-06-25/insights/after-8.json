        "Serbia might have crashed out of the competition, but they have Predrag Rajkovic to thank for not finishing with a defeat. The goalkeeper pulled off three saves to keep his team in the game and, up until the final minute, in with a chance of going through to the next round.",
        "His team may have been chasing the game for much of the 90 minutes, but Aleksandar Mitrovic had more attempts on goal than anyone else and failed to hit the target with any of them. Had he managed to sneak one over the line, his team would have been through."
