        "Kasper Hjulmand's side have drawn both of their games so far 1-1; Dragan Stojković's team have just the one point, their 1-0 loss to England followed by a 1-1 draw with Slovenia, earned by a late Luka Jović goal.",
        "The Denmark machine went like clockwork against England, and the only thing missing was the three points.",
        "It is 'to be or not to be' time for the Eagles, who kept their fate in their own hands with a last-gasp equaliser against Slovenia.",
        "Denmark are a really strong side. They have excellent players. They're a very tough side.",
        "They haven't won but also haven't lost in two games. That means they're an organised team who sacrifice a lot on the pitch."

        "The permutations are complicated, and who finishes third in Group C will also depend on what happens when England meet Slovenia",
        "The countries' previous ten meetings have ended with five wins apiece, but the momentum is very much with the Danes, who have won their four most recent encounters."
