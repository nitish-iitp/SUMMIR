        "What's at stake today? Unlike other confederations, the Confederation of African Football is not playing qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, but is instead playing its qualifiers for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Morocco.",
        "History Benin vs Libya: In total they have met on a total of five occasions in which they have never drawn. That's two wins for Benin and three for Libya. The last clash was in November 2013 for an international friendly with Libya winning 1-0.",
        "Libya, a story far from home: War and conflict in African countries is unfortunately present in everyday life. Libya has not been exempt from it and that is why it had to play its matches outside its country for almost 7 years. On March 25, 2021, its population returned to see Liu's national team play a soccer match. That day they faced the Tunisian national team and were defeated 2-5. However, the important thing that night was not the match, it was that a part of the population could return to the stadium without fear."
