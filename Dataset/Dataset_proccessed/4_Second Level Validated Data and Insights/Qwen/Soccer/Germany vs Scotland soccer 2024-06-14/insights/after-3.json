        "Germany captain Ílkay Gündogan said, 'We played with a lot of intensity and played the right spaces, took some risks, and that is why we scored. We played an outstanding first half and we were up 3-0.'",
        "Scotland captain Andy Robertson said, 'First half, we just got it all wrong really, didn't show up, weren't aggressive enough, and we let good players get on the ball. Second half, we're down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it's a quick turnaround now.'"
