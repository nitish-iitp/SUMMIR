Meret Müldür in Euro 2024 Fantasy Football
MERET MÜLDÜR IN EURO 2024 FANTASY FOOTBALL

Mert Müldür might have just made enough of an impression on you to make you forget about picking solely established stars for Euro 2024 fantasy football.

While it is true that we are judging him on a limited number of minutes played, today I am looking at some of the reasons why you may want to keep an eye on the Turkish right-back.

MERT MÜLDÜR IN EURO 2024 FANTASY FOOTBALL

Mert Müldür Is Set to Start Against the Czech Republic

Mert Müldür scored the first goal for Turkey against Georgia, the one that lit up the Turkish fans’ hope for Euro 2024. He followed it up by having a strong, consistent game playing at right back.

However, Müldür was out of the game against Portugal. This was lost 3-0. The result will likely influence manager Vincenzo Montella’s selection for the decisive game against The Czech Republic.

Tomorrow, it looks like Mert Müldür will be in, and the more famous Zeki Çelik will make room. Çelik struggled against Portuguese’s forwards and didn’t provide much support in attack either.

Against The Czech Republic, the Turks need to avoid defeat to be sure of their qualification in the knockout rounds. Making the Round of 16 would be a nice boost following relatively disappointing recent years for the national team.

Mert Müldür’s Stats

Mert Müldür should be on your radar, especially if you are looking for an inexpensive option for your Euro 2024 fantasy football team. The right-back is 2* in FootballCoin and, thus, free to be picked on a season-long lease.

Against Georgia, Müldür put in some impressive numbers. He took a total of 3 shots and scored once. He also made two successful tackles. His passing wasn’t bad, with an 81% success rate.

Back in the Turkish Super Lig, Müldür earned a reputation as a serious-minded, attacking right-back defender. His performances, for Fenerbahce, last season oscilated between very good and average.

Still, manager Vincenzo Montella saw enough potential there to call him up for the national team for Euro 2024, and tomorrow, you could consider a similar move.
