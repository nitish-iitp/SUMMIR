        "Argentina didn’t need to look far back in its history to remember that. Two years ago en route to the World Cup triumph, Argentina fell in its tournament opener to Saudi Arabia.",
        "Canada’s midblock forced Argentina to swing the ball laterally. Spaces opened up, but when they switched to Di Maria on the right, or to Marcos Acuña on the left, Argentina rarely took that chance.",
        "Three minutes into the second half, Paredes sent a long diagonal ball to Di Maria, forcing Davies to backpedal. Shortly thereafter, Argentina scored the opener through Alvarez, after pushing Canada deep into their own half.",
        "In the 30th and 32nd minutes, they broke through down the left side through Davies. On one, the ball found Tajon Buchanan at the far post and his desperate spinning toe-poke did little to danger Argentina, but Jonathan David was arriving on a late run and, had the ball been dropped back, would’ve had a good chance to test the goal.",
        "In the 43rd minute when Buchanan shook his defender and crossed into the box. Stephen Eustaquio rose for an open header, but his attempt from close range was stopped by Dibu Martinez.",
        "Between overcoming any hesitation that can come with returning from a broken leg or the frustration that could come with not getting his chance, Crepeau deserves praise for giving his Canadian teammates a chance in the game.",
        "The temporary playing surface at Mercedes-Benz Stadium was unsuitable for these type of players according to Lionel Scaloni."
