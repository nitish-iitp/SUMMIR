Germany could only draw 0-0 with Ukraine in the first of two Euro 2024 warm-up friendlies, but Maximilian Beier's debut is a reason to get excited.

TELL ME MORE

It was a game that was characteristic of two teams trying to find their way into form after a long club season and ahead of a major tournament. Germany passed the ball around effortlessly but it wasn't until the second half when Beier appeared that they genuinely looked like scoring, with several of those chances falling to the energetic youngster himself. Fellow substitute Chris Fuhrich also went close to getting the breakthrough, while an 89th minute Manuel Neuer gaffe losing the ball near the centre circle went unpunished thanks to an offside flag.

DID YOU KNOW?

Julian Nagelsmann doesn't yet have his full squad available on account of several players called up for the Euros being involved in Saturday's Champions League final. That meant no Toni Kroos, Niclas Fullkrug, Nico Schlotterbeck or Antonio Rudiger here. They will report for duty in the coming days.

THE MVP

Considering it was his senior international debut, Beier showed absolutely no fear when he came off the bench an hour in and made Germany look a completely different prospect. The 21-year-old's strike against the inside of the post was literally his very first touch, while he had other great chances that could have easily have resulted in a hat-trick on another day. He's given Nagelsmann a nice kind of selection headache and probably vindicates the coach leaving the more experienced Timo Werner and Serge Gnabry out of the squad this summer.

THE BIG LOSER

Kai Havertz started as the central striker. But, despite having impressed in that role for Arsenal in the second half of the Premier League season, he was incredibly well marshalled by Ukraine's backline and was very quickly outshone by Beier after being withdrawn. With the more explosive Fullkrug, who has 11 goals in 15 Germany appearances, also still to come into the fold, it is questionable whether Havertz will be considered a starter by the time Euro 2024 rolls around in just 11 days.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Germany will follow up with a second warmup friendly on June 7 when Greece are the visitors in Monchengladbach. After that, there is exactly one week until Julian Nagelsmann's side open Euro 2024 as hosts against Scotland in Munich. Positive momentum will be absolutely vital given the expectation on the squad, and the fact that Germany have underwhelmed at major international tournaments for the best part of a decade.
