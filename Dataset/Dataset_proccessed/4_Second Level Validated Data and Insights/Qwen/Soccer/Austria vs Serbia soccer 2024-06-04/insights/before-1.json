        "Ralf Rangnick has masterminded an exhilarating run of form at the Austria helm, culminating in Das Team's third-straight Euros finals qualification.",
        "Serbia's overall record does not spark optimism of a deep run in Germany, as despite edging out Cyprus 1-0 in March's friendly, that triumph was just a third victory from nine games for Stojkovic's side.",
        "Austria have won six of their last seven matches, while Serbia have won just one of their last four.",
        "Three of the Eagles' previous four showdowns against Austria have ended in victory, although the one outlier is their most recent meeting in a 2018 World Cup qualifier, where Das Team left it late to prevail 3-2 thanks to an 89th-minute Louis Schaub effort."
