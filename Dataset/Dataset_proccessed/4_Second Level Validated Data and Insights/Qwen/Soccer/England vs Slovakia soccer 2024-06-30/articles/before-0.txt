Slovakia captain Milan Skriniar has expressed confidence in his team’s strategy as they prepare to face England in the Euro 2024 round of 16 clash.

The PSG defender believes that Slovakia’s cohesive teamwork can counter England’s reliance on individual brilliance.

“They [England] rely on individual quality and they know that they have players who can decide matches for them,” Skriniar stated. “That is why I think we can handle them through teamwork.”

Skriniar, 29, also noted that the pressure is more on Gareth Southgate’s side, given their status and expectations. “Even in their first match [against Serbia], they went in with the fact that they are England, and they have to manage things in terms of results,” he said. “The media and fans have been critical after their matches, so they will be under much more pressure than us. It can work in our favour.”

Slovakia advanced to the knockout stage by finishing third in Group E, where all four teams ended with the same points—a first in Euros history. Slovakia’s previous campaigns saw them reach the last 16 in 2016, only to be eliminated by Germany, and they failed to progress from the group stage in Euro 2020.
