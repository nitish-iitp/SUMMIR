Euro 2024: Anthony Gordon reveals why he should start for England against Slovakia

Anthony Gordon has staked his claim to start for England in Sunday's Euro 2024 last-16 clash with Slovakia, stating that he is a 'nightmare for anyone he plays against'.

The 23-year-old was handed his senior international debut in March this year and his form at Newcastle United was rewarded with a call-up to Gareth Southgate's final 26-man squad for this summer's tournament in Germany.

Gordon was named Newcastle's Player of the Season for 2023-24 after scoring 12 goals and registering 11 assists in 48 appearances across all competitions.

The winger has since had to bide his time at Euro 2024, and after watching on as an unused substitute in England's first two Group C matches, he came on in the 89th minute for his first outing of the tournament in a drab 0-0 draw with Slovenia on Tuesday.

There have been calls from many supporters and pundits for Gordon to be handed a start on the left side of England's attack against Slovakia, potentially replacing Phil Foden who has just returned to the first-team camp after attending the birth of his third child in the UK.

Gordon hopes to give Southgate selection headache

Gordon believes that he would add a "different element" to an England attack that has scored just two goals in three group games.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Gordon said: "My main strengths are I'm direct, I'm quick, so I know I'm a nightmare for anyone I play against. Every time I get the ball, I try and make something happen.

"I'm not a very safe player, I'm always going for it and trying to put people on the back foot. With the players we've got like H [Harry Kane] who like to drop deep, I think I add a different element to the team."

Asked if he expects to start against Slovakia, Gordon added: "It's out of my control. I can only control what I can control. And that's giving my best every day and causing as problems for him [England manager Gareth Southgate] in terms of selections as I possibly can. When or if I'm needed, I'll be more than ready.

"I will always be ready. I will control what I do, that's what I can do every day. And I try and push the lads who are playing as best as I can when I train. When I come on, I'm trying to stay on and not come off. I'm playing to play the next game, that's my mindset.

"It [my direct style] brings a sense of unpredictability, I win a lot of fouls and it can put teams on the back foot. That's just the way I play football.

"That works for me, that's how I feel best [when] playing. I know how hard I am to play against, I can feel it, I know that people don't like playing against me. It's worked for me and I will carry on doing it."

Gordon comments on freak bike accident

Gordon has been training with his teammates throughout this week, but he gave Three Lions fans a fright when he suffered a heavy fall following a high-speed electric bike accident.

Seen with grazes on his chin, arms and hands, Gordon said: "I was going down the hill and tried to take a picture for my family and before I knew it I was face first into the floor. It's only few cuts, it's not anything painful.

"The front brake is on the left-hand side and I tried to press the right one to slow down - and it didn't slow down, it came to a full stop. I've gone 10 feet in the air, chin first.

"I just carried on and finished the bike ride. When I got back to camp, I had to put stuff on it, which absolutely stung. To be fair, no-one saw me thankfully."

Gordon is fit to feature on Saturday, but it remains to be seen whether left-back Luke Shaw - who has not played since February due to a muscle injury - will be ready to be involved against Slovakia, with Southgate expected to deliver an update at a press conference on Saturday.
