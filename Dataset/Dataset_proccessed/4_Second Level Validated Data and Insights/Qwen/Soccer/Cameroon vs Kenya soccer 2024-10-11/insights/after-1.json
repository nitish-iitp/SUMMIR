        "The boys passed the ball blindly and had no coordination at all and after I watched the game (against Cameroon), I concluded that we lacked the confidence, creativity and teamwork to trouble the African giants.",
        "Very poor display of football from the first minute to the last. All the players looked scared and tired.",
        "The entire team was down on agility, concentration was poor, passes not reaching the target, confidence was poor, the entire team was overrun by Cameroon.",
        "If we are to qualify for the AFCON (maybe through miracles), we shall meet tougher opponents than Cameroon and it could be a huge shame for Kenya to go and participate with that kind of a display.",
        "First, coach Firat must put his house in order, close all the loopholes, avoid penalty-causing mistakes, use aerial balls and speed, and score more goals early, to avoid the scenario of what happened in the 4-1 thrashing.",
        "Firat should, by all means, avoid playing Cameroon style of game, make sure the defence is watertight, he should make sure the players he left on the bench get to start and if possible keep Matasi on the bench, he should also try as much as possible to use the wingers, as this will provide scoring opportunities for Olunga and company."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Former Kenyan international Elijah Onsika has blamed Harambee Stars' humiliating 4-1 defeat against Cameroon in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers on a lack of creativity and confidence within the playing unit.",
        "Kenya coach Firat introduced Okumu for Amos Nondi at the start of the second half in a bid to stop Cameroon from adding to their advantage but they could not deny Bassong to inscribe his name in the scoresheet after he finished off a cross from Hongla in the 55th minute.",
        "Meanwhile, Cameroon coach Marc Brys fielded a star-studded squad with striker Manchester United custodian Andre Onana leading from the back while Christian Bassogog, Frank Anguissa, Martin Hongla, Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo and Vincent Aboubakar were the other notable big names."
