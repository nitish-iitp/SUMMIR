        "Guyana has conceded ten goals in its last five matches, the visiting team needs to avoid conceding more.",
        "Kevin Appin is the player Guyana needs to pay special attention to. The player comes in with a goal to his credit and will be looking to give a great duel and add more goals in this match.",
        "These teams will meet for the second time in their history, in the first game, played in 2017, in that match everything ended goalless, besides being friendly."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Jamaal Shabazz spoke ahead of this match: “I felt like we were always in the game. When we made the two substitutions in the middle, we had the chance with the go-ahead goal. At this level of the game, when you don’t take your chances to go ahead and you give them away, you’re going to be punished; and I think we learned that lesson today.”",
        "When you have two (or) three days to prepare, you have to rely on the skill of the players and the work they do at the clubs to become clinical finishers. That’s not something the national team can work on with an international player in two days; it’s something we just have to keep improving on. They had their chances, our goalkeeper was brilliant at times, but we could have finished a lot better today.",
        "I thought we created our chances playing like that, and then we changed things up playing in the second half."
