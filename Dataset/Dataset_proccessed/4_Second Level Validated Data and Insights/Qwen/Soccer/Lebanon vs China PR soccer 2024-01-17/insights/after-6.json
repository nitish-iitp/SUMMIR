        "We played against a tough team. We don't win the game, but we showed a good mentality, excellent attitude and put up a big fight. The road is still long. One more game to play, and target is the same to go through knockout stage,We can see from the matches that Asian football has been improving. We played not badly today, we just need to score,Despite our playing against the host team who is the defending champion with World Cup experience, we still depend on ourselves, and as a coach I always to be in this situation,We missed chances, and that's football. Sometimes you do everything to score, but you don't score,We did better controlling the better, to be brave, and we made some improvements to deal with stress. Today I have nothing to blame."
