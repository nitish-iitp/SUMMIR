        "After ex-Tottenham Hotspur defender Maksim Paskotsi received his marching orders in the 27th minute, Poland made full use of their extra man in the second 45, as Piotr Zielinski, Jakub Piotrowski and Sebastian Szymanski all found the mark alongside a Karol Mets own goal."

    "Others": [
        "Wales' only beating from their last 16 home matches in Euros qualifying is a 4-2 loss to Armenia just nine months ago.",
        "Poland's triumph over Estonia did not come without its sacrifices, as Frankowski was taken off at half time for Aston Villa's Matty Cash, who lasted just 10 minutes himself before succumbing to a suspected hamstring issue."
