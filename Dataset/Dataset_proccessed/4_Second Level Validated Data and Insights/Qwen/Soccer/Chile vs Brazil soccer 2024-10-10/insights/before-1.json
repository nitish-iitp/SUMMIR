        "One of the most-played fixtures in South American international football, Brazil and Chile are more than well-accustomed to each other, with both having 100 years of footballing history behind them.",
        "Chile may not match the level of prestige Brazil have on the global stage with the Selecao having won five World Cups, but La Roja have enjoyed recent continental success with back-to-back Copa America wins in 2015 and 2016.",
        "Brazil blow Chile out of the water in that regard too though, having won the Copa on nine occasions, and their record in head-to-head meetings is also very favourable.",
        "The most notable meeting was the semi-final in 1962, which was hosted by Chile, but ultimately ended in heartbreak for the home side, as Garrincha and Vava both netted twice in a 4-2 Brazil victory.",
        "In more recent times, the last 16 stage has been a common battleground for the two nations to face off in at the World Cup, doing so three times in the past three decades."
