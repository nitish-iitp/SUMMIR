        "Captain Harry Kane missed the previous match with a knock sustained while on duty for Bayern Munich.",
        "Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was brought off early in the second half with a leg issue, possibly a hamstring problem.",
        "All of Jude Bellingham, Anthony Gordon, and Cole Palmer could hold their places in attack due to Saka's absence.",
        "England's attacking situation is further complicated by Jack Grealish's fitness problem.",
        "Carsley will likely bring in either Ollie Watkins or Dominic Solanke if Kane is not fit enough to start.",
        "Conor Gallagher in midfield would not go amiss, as he offers a stable presence alongside Declan Rice.",
        "Levi Colwill, Rico Lewis, and Jordan Pickford should all continue in defence.",
        "John Stones may cede his place to Marc Guehi, while Kyle Walker could also be a straight swap for Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right."
