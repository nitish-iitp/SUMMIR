        "James Rodriguez floated a cross to the far post, and Yerson Mosquera nodded home after La Albiceleste fell asleep.",
        "Nico Gonzalez darted beyond the Colombia defence before finishing through the keeper's legs to level proceedings.",
        "Daniel Munoz was adjudged to have been fouled by Enzo Fernandez in the box - a decision given after a lengthy VAR check. James, excellent on the night, smashed home the resulting penalty, despite the usual gamesmanship from Emi Martinez."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Lionel Scaloni's side were ineffective without their main man in a disappointing loss in World Cup qualifying",
        "Messi, still absent with the high ankle sprain he suffered in the Copa America final the last time these two sides met, might have made the difference here."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Scaloni could only watch as his team were convincingly beaten.",
        "Argentina are more effective with Mac Allister in his role."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Emi Martinez (5/10): Helpless to stop the opener. His usual sh*thousery didn't work on James' penalty, either.",
        "Gonzalo Montiel (5/10): Removed at half-time after a poor first half in which he picked up a silly yellow and didn't do much else.",
        "Cristian Romero (5/10): Not the most comfortable showing for the Tottenham man. Spent a lot of time struggling to contain first Luis Diaz, then Duran."
