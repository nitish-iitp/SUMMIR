        "Argentina will be without Lionel Messi once again when they make the trip to Barranquilla to face Colombia.",
        "Even without Messi, Argentina still turned on the style, beating Chile 3-0 last week, with Paulo Dybala being handed the legendary number 10 shirt, and scoring off the bench.",
        "Dybala may have to watch on from the sidelines from the start again here though, with Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez set to start in attack for Lionel Scaloni's side in Messi's absence.",
        "Scaloni attempted a change in shape for the clash with Chile, starting in a 3-5-2 formation with Nicolas Gonzalez starting as a makeshift left wing-back, but shortly after the interval, Lisandro Martinez was moved out wide to left-back as they reverted to a four-at-the-back system.",
        "That saw Giovani Lo Celso come on for Gonzalez, and Argentina looked more impressive following the switch, so Scaloni could opt to go with that from the outset here.",
        "Elsewhere on the injury front, Bayer Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios is currently out and has been joined on the sidelines by defensive duo Leonardo Balerdi and Nicolas Tagliafico.",
        "Not getting regular minutes in Serie A for Fiorentina has seen Lucas Martinez Quarta lose his place in the squad for the time being, with Scaloni handing first call ups to a number of individuals this week."
