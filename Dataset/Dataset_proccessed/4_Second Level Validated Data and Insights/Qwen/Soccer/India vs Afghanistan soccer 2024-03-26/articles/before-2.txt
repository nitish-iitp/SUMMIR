After putting up a dismal performance against the Afghans in the away leg of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier at the Damac Stadium in Abha, Igor Stimac's side would hope they put on their scoring shoes when the two sides meet again at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Assam on Tuesday, March 26, 2024.

India currently sit second in Group A that also consists Qatar and Kuwait. The Blue Tigers have played three and won one and lost one with one draw game.

In their match against Afghanistan, Sunil Chhetri-led side missed the chance to take top spot in the group with a tame draw. Such was the quality of Indian attack that it was Subhasish Bose’s header in the 79th minute that saw India coming ever so close to scoring in the second half.
