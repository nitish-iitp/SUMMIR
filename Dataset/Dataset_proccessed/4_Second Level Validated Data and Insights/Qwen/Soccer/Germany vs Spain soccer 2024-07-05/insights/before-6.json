        "Spain boss Luis de la Fuente is expected to name an unchanged starting lineup for Friday's Euro 2024 quarter-final showdown with Germany.",
        "Lamine Yamal is expected to retain his spot on the right side of a front three next to captain and striker Alvaro Morata, and in-form winger Nico Williams.",
        "Fabian Ruiz and Rodri were also on the scoresheet and are set to link arms with Pedri in centre-midfield, although Dani Olmo - another goalscorer against Georgia - Mikel Merino and Fermin Lopez will be among those hoping to force their way into the first XI.",
        "Nacho Fernandez has recovered from a minor foot injury to make himself available for selection, but the ex-Real Madrid man is unlikely to displace either of Aymeric Laporte or Robin Le Normand in central defence, while Dani Carvajal and Marc Cucurella should continue as full-backs."
