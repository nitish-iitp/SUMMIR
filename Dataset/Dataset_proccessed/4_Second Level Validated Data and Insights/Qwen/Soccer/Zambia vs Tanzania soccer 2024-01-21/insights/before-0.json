        "Zambia were making a comeback after missing the last three editions of the AFCON and sought their first win at the tournament since their surprising triumph in 2012.",
        "Chipolopolo had major difficulty creating goal-scoring opportunities in their first match of the competition, registering only three shots against Congo DR.",
        "Avram Grant's team went ahead in the first half of that match as Kings Kangwa cleverly scored from 25 yards, taking advantage of Lionel Mpasi being off his line after attempting to tackle Patson Daka.",
        "While their opening fixture may not have ended in victory, Chipolopolo will know that this is their opportunity to take all three points against an opponent that they have not lost to in their last four meetings, winning on two occasions and drawing the other two.",
        "Zambia's defensive solidity was commendable in their first match, and they will likely prioritize keeping a clean sheet in this match against a Tanzania attack that lacks genuine firepower.",
        "Tanzania managed only two touches in Morocco's box on the day, marking their lowest tally in an Africa Cup of Nations match, and it was also the lowest among all teams in the first round of matches."
