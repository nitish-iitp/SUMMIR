        "There is a case to be made that England had the best player in Spain (Jude Bellingham), Germany (Harry Kane) and England (Phil Foden) last season.",
        "John Stones was a revelation in that role when City won the treble in 2022-23 because, aside from the passing options in his own half and the late runs from deep in the final third, he helps City manage possession in the middle of the pitch, allowing the likes of Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne and Foden to stay higher.",
        "England’s build-up play has been shocking compared to City’s, most notably against Serbia on Sunday when Jordan Pickford spent the second half ignoring all of the options in front of him so he could boot the ball directly to Harry Kane.",
        "Declan Rice started as a No 8 in the Community Shield against Manchester City, to help Arsenal’s press become more aggressive, which was a recurring theme against top teams.",
        "Trent Alexander-Arnold’s role changed so he became an inverted full-back. It allowed him the freedom to drift into central areas during build-up play and influence the game from central areas before dropping back into right-back when possession was lost.",
        "Southgate isn’t interested in Alexander-Arnold inverting from right-back for two main reasons. He wants Kyle Walker as part of his defensive line and he decided the 25-year-old is one of his midfield options.",
        "Trippier is not just Newcastle’s right-back, he is critical to their attacking game plan. Eddie Howe’s offensive setup is essentially built around the 33-year-old.",
        "A natural right-footer, Trippier is being used as a left-back behind Foden, who is nominally operating as a left-sided attacker but is often drifting inside.",
        "How long have you got? It was only in the last couple of months of the season that he began to start in the middle (rather than drifting in there from wide) and over the years he has fulfilled all sorts of roles.",
        "Bellingham’s role for England, especially so far at these Euros, looks much less defined. In the opener against Serbia, he covered a lot of ground, as he also does for Madrid, but for England he seemed to want to control what was happening a lot more.",
        "Southgate also wants Gallagher to provide energy, particularly in pressing, for an England team that has looked lacklustre at Euro 2024.",
        "Eze’s first notable involvement for England at Euro 2024 came 10 minutes after his introduction as a second-half substitute against Denmark. Receiving a pass from Crystal Palace team-mate Marc Guehi, he turned into space and quickly threaded a clever through ball for Ollie Watkins to chase."
