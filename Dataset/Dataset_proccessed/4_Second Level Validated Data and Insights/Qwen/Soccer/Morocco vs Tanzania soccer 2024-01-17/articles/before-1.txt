Day five of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations sees title favourites Morocco take on Tanzania in a Group F encounter at the Laurent Pokou Stadium.




Date: Wednesday, 17 January 2024


Kick-off: 19h00 CAT




Head-to-head: This will be the first-ever meeting between the two teams at the continental showpiece, although they did square off during the 2012 AFCON qualifying campaign as Morocco triumphed both home (3-1) and away (1-0). Overall the Atlas Lions lead 4-1 in their encounters and  faced the Taifa Stars as recently as 21 November 2023 in a 2026 World Cup qualifier, winning 2-0 in Dar-es-Salaam.




Morocco’s last three results: Walid Regragui’s side concluded their AFCON qualifying campaign with a 3-0 victory over Liberia on October 17 and beat Tanzania one month later before wrapping up their preparations for the tournament in Ivory Coast by beating Sierra Leone 3-1 on January 11.




Tanzania’s last three results: The East Africans kicked off their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign with a 1-0 win against Niger on November 18 before losing to Morocco three days later and they warmed up for the continental showpiece by going down 2-0 to Egypt on January 7.




Team news: Noussair Mazraoui faces a late fitness test for Morocco on a thigh injury he sustained in Bayern Munich’s UEFA Champions League clash with Manchester United on December 12. Tanzania have reported no injuries and will be at full strength for the Group F opener in San-Pedro.




Key player – Morocco: Hakim Ziyech featured just once for the Atlas Lions during the qualifiers and he got on the scoresheet in a 2-1 defeat to South Africa on 17 June 2023. The 30-year-old winger struggled with injury in the second half of 2023, although he scored in the last meeting with the Taifa Stars two months ago.




Key player – Tanzania: Mbwana Samatta will lead the line against Morocco and he’ll be hoping to get back amongst the goals after failing to score in his last 11 appearances since netting in the 3-1 win over Central African Republic on 23 March 2022.
