        "Eswatini come into this game on the back of a 1-0 defeat away to Guinea-Bissau in their first AFCON qualifier.",
        "Eswatini are yet to qualify for the World Cup or AFCON finals in their history, and they will need to be at their best against Mali if they are to have any hope of picking up their first points in these upcoming qualifiers.",
        "Mali on the other hand head into Sunday's match after a 1-1 draw at home against Mozambique, with Yves Bissouma salvaging a point after his side had fallen behind to a Geny Catamo strike.",
        "Les Aigles have only lost two of their last 17 games in a run that stretches back to June 2023, and they should be considered favourites to top Group I for the AFCON qualifiers."

        "Eswatini last tasted victory back in March",
        "Mali come into Sunday's encounter with just one defeat from their last five outings",
        "Eswatini are bottom of Group D with four defeats on the spin, and only four nations in Africa sit below their FIFA ranking of 158th",
        "Mali sit fourth in the table; beneath Comoros, Ghana and Madagascar after four games played"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Mali are still without a host of players for Sunday's game, with Bundesliga duo Amadou Haidara and Moussa Sylla missing out",
        "They join Kevin Zohi, Hamari Traore, Massadio Haidara and Lassine Sinayoko in being unavailable for selection",
        "Eswatini possible starting lineup: Gama; Manana, Silenge, Gamedze, Thwala; Dlamini, Masangane, Matse, Matsebula; Ndzinisa; Mkhonto",
        "Mali possible starting lineup: Diarra; Diakite, Diaby, Fofana, Doucoure; Coulibaly, Dieng; Koita, Bissouma, Djenepo; Doumbia",
        "We say: Eswatini 0-1 Mali",
        "Given that Mali also drew their opening game against Mozambique, they will know that anything other than a win here would be a huge disappointment, even with the number of players Mali have unavailable on Sunday."
