Brazil will resume their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign when they welcome Ecuador to Estadio Major Antonio Couto Pereira on Friday.

The Selecao are sitting in sixth spot with seven points to their name, while the visitors are one point better off in fifth position.

Brazil boss Dorival Junior experienced disappointment in his first tournament in charge of the national team after he saw his side eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Copa America in the USA.

The Selecao won just one of their three group matches (D2), meaning that they had to settle for second place and a tough quarter-final tie against Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay, who kept their cool from the penalty spot to eliminate Brazil on penalties.

Despite overseeing an underwhelming tournament, Dorival can still take some comfort from the fact that he has not lost in regulation time in any of his eight matches in charge, giving him something to build upon in his first two qualifiers as Brazil coach.

The five-time World Cup winners may view qualification as a formality, but they have work to do after winning two, drawing one and losing three of their first six qualifiers.

They began their qualifying campaign with back-to-back wins and a draw against Venezuela, before they were stopped in their tracks by three defeats against Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.

Brazil will be confident of taking something from Friday's contest against Ecuador, having avoided defeat in each of their last 12 head-to-head matches.

Like Brazil, Ecuador also experienced penalty-shootout disappointment in the quarter-finals of the 2024 Copa America.

After finishing second in their group, La Tri went on to play out a 1-1 draw with Argentina before suffering a 4-2 defeat in the subsequent shootout.

Having had a couple of months to reflect on a second straight quarter-final exit, Ecuador will now turn their focus back to World Cup qualifying as they look to reach back-to-back finals.

Felix Sanchez left his post following Ecuador's Copa America exit and was subsequently replaced by former Elche boss Sebastian Beccacece.

Beccacece takes over a side that have put together a five-game unbeaten run in World Cup qualifying and are sitting one place above Brazil despite being hit with a three-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player in the previous qualifying cycle.

La Tri have not beaten Brazil since November 2004, but they may be able to take confidence from the fact that they have avoided defeat in their last two meetings with Selecao.

Brazil are without the services of Al-Hilal forward Neymar, who is still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that he sustained in October 2023.

Borussia Dortmund's Yan Couto and Manchester City's Savinho, who were teammates at Girona last season, have both been forced to withdraw from Dorival's squad due to injury.

Real Madrid defender Eder Militao has also been ruled out for the next two fixtures after he sustained a thigh injury in Wednesday's training session.

Dorival has handed a call-up to 17-year-old Palmeiras attacker Estevao Willian, who will swap the Brazilian top flight for the Premier League when he officially joins Chelsea next summer.

With Raphinha suspended, Dorival could decide to select an all-Real Madrid forward line of Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior and Endrick.

As for Ecuador, they are unable to call upon defender Christian Ramirez, who was forced to withdraw from the squad after he sustained an ankle injury in Ferencvaros' Europa League qualifying clash with Borac.

Brighton & Hove Albion's Pervis Estupinan has not played for his country since March 2023 due to injury, but he has returned to the fold for the current international period and is expected to start against Brazil.

Ecuador's all-time leading scorer Enner Valencia will spearhead the attack, and he will be looking to add to the 41 goals that he has scored for his country.


Brazil possible starting lineup:
Alisson; Danilo, Marquinhos, Gabriel, Arana; Andre, Guimaraes, Paqueta; Rodrygo, Vinicius, Endrick

Ecuador possible starting lineup:
Galindez; Preciado, Hincapie, Pacho, Estupinan; Caicedo, Franco, Gruezo; Paez, Sarmiento, Valencia



We say: Brazil 2-1 Ecuador

Brazil will be motivated to produce a positive response after a disappointing Copa America campaign, and we think that they will make full use of home advantage to claim maximum points and extend their unbeaten run in head-to-head matches to 13 games.
