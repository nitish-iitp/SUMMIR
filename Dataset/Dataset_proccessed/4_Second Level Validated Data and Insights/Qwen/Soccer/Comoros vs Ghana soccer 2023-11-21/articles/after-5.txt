The Black Stars of Ghana’s injury worries continue to grow as West Ham playmaker Mohammed Kudus joins the list of injured players with a back injury days after Daniel Amartey’s injury was reported.

Kudus is expected to undergo a late fitness test to determine his chances of playing against the Comoros on Tuesday, November 21, 2023.

Mo Kudus featured in the Black Stars match against Madagascar, which saw him play out the full 90 minutes. With the possibility of being sidelined for the big game on Tuesday, November 21, 2023, the big question is: who takes his place?

After seeing Mali and the Central African Republic play out a draw, the Black Stars will be hoping to make another affirmative statement when they face Comoros at the Stade de Moroni on Tuesday, November 21, 2023, to ensure they top Group I.
