        "Georgia competed at a major tournament as an independent nation for the first time in their history over the summer and, as the lowest-ranked side at Euro 2024, surprised many by reaching the knockout rounds.",
        "Willy Sagnol's men picked up four points from three group-stage games, including all three in a vital 2-0 victory over Portugal, and edged themselves into the last 16 as one of the best third-placed teams.",
        "Georgia's fairytale journey was eventually ended by champions Spain, losing 4-1, but the Crusaders exited the tournament in Germany with their heads held high, and Sagnol is now targeting a successful campaign in the Nations League.",
        "Currently ranked 70th in the world by FIFA, Georgia secured promotion from League C of the Nations League in 2022-23 after winning five and drawing one of their six matches to comfortably finish top of their group ahead of Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Gibraltar.",
        "Georgia have only lost three of their last 11 internations in all competitions, including two against Spain, while their home record also bodes well ahead of Saturday's clash with Czech Republic, as they have lost just one of their last 13 matches in front of their own fans since November 2021.",
        "Three years after reaching the quarter-finals at the European Championship, Czech Republic crashed out in the group stage of Euro 2024, finishing rock bottom with only one point.",
        "That solitary point was collected from a 1-1 draw with none other than Georgia - Patrik Schick's second-half goal cancelled out a first-half penalty from Georges Mikautadze - while they also lost to both Portugal and Turkey by 2-1 scorelines.",
        "Ivan Hasek, who was appointed head coach in January, won each of his first four games in charge of Czech Republic prior to Euro 2024 and is now tasked with reigniting the spark that they had earlier in the year as they endeavour to kick-start their Nations League campaign in positive fashion.",
        "Ranked 47th in the world by FIFA after falling 13 places since the conclusion of Euro 2024, Czechia were relegated from League A of the 2022-23 Nations League after losing four of their six group matches, finishing behind Spain, Portugal and Switzerland.",
        "Hasek's side will be hoping to improve their away form, as they enter Saturday's clash against Georgia having won just three of their last 13 internationals on the road, excluding Euro 2024 matches - they did beat Norway 2-1 in their most recent away game in March, though."
