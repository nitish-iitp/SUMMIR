Bahrain and Indonesia square off on Thursday in what is a crucial fixture in their efforts to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.

Sitting in third and fourth respectively in Group B in the third round of AFC qualifying, one of these nations can take a step closer to guaranteeing a minimum of a fourth-round spot with victory in Riffa.

With the World Cup in 2026 being extended to 48 teams, nations such as Bahrain and Indonesia have been left to dream putting themselves in contention for a spot on the biggest stage.

Both of these teams have been presented with a far tougher task than they may have been with Japan, Saudi Arabia and Australia in their group.

Nevertheless, Bahrain causing shockwaves on the Gold Coast with a 1-0 victory in Australia has shaken this six-nation group up, Australia now without success in two games.

Bahrain subsequently lost 5-0 at home to Japan in their following contest, yet sitting in third spot after two games with home matches against Indonesia and China to come in their next three outings is arguably a dream scenario.

Should Dragan Talajic's side collect at least three points from that double-header, they will remain very much in the hunt for a top-four spot, which would guarantee progression to the next round.

In their last nine matches in all competitions, Bahrain have suffered just the two defeats, both of which have come at the hands of Japan.

Opponents Indonesia are also in excellent form having only experienced one defeat in their most recent encounters in all competitions.

That came to Iraq in June, yet they have since responded with draws against the likes Saudi Arabia and Australia in this group.

Keeping a clean sheet in the latter would have made their rivals in the group take note that Shin Tae-yong's side are capable of extending their participation in this qualifying campaign.

Shin must decide whether to tinker with his Bahrain XI, it not necessarily being a simple decision to change players who started a 5-0 defeat.

Indonesia were not helped through Ali Madan and Ali Haram having to be withdrawn before the start of the second half, four of the goals that they conceded coming after those two substitutions.

With the same 11 players that started the Japan game available for this fixture, Shin may go with an unaltered lineup.

As for Indonesia, the absence of Justin Hubner may lead to Wahyu Prasetyo being brought into the team, providing that Talajic sticks with a back five.

However, FC Twente defender Mees Hilgers could be drafted into the defence for his debut given his experience in the Eredivisie.


Bahrain possible starting lineup:
Lutfalla; Emmanuel, Baqer, Benadi, Al-Khulasi; Madan, Al-Asfoor, Haram, Marhoon; Al-Aswad, Abduljabbar

Indonesia possible starting lineup:
Paes; Walsh, Ridho, Idzes, Prasetyo, Verdonk; Ferdinan, Tjoe-A-On, Jenner, Oratmangoen; Struick



We say: Bahrain 2-1 Indonesia

Although Bahrain lost heavily last time out, we cannot ignore that they managed to defeat Australia in their first game on away territory. With that in mind, we are backing a narrow home victory in Riffa, which would keep them in the top three as a bare minimum.
