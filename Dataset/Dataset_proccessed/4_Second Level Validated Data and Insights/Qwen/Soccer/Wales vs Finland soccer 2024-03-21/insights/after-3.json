        "Southampton forward Brooks was decisive for the Welsh as he grabbed the important early opener to give his team a boost and rattle their opponents. He then helped ensure they restored a comfortable lead when he found Johnson in space to smash home their third.",
        "Finland winger Daniel Hakans did not have the best of matches for the away side. He saw one wayward effort miss the target in the first half and then slipped as he challenged Ethan Ampadu for the header and ended up playing Johnson onside, letting Wales kill the game off."
