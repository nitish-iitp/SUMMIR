        "Elation in the playoffs is nothing new for this week's hosts, who memorably downed Austria and Ukraine in 2022 en route to qualifying for their first World Cup in 64 years, and such feats must now be replicated if they are to take their place among the European elite.",
        "Despite suffering relegation from League A of the Nations League, just competing in the top tier earned them a shot at redemption in the playoffs.",
        "Wales are now potentially just 180 minutes away from making three successive finals and are unbeaten in their last six matches under Rob Page across all competitions.",
        "The Dragons have only been beaten in one of their last 15 European Championship qualifying matches on home turf - although it came as recently as June 2023, a 4-2 loss to Armenia - and have only failed to find the back of the net twice in that sequence.",
        "Finland have three wins to show from their last four Euros qualifying away matches, and not since 2015 have they played out a draw in the preliminary continental rounds.",
        "Since doing the double over Wales in their World Cup 2010 qualifying group, though, Finland have failed to win any of their last four matches against the Dragons, losing both of their 2020-21 Nations League battles before a dull goalless draw in Helsinki in September 2021."
