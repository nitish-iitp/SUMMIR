Algeria pulled off a sensational comeback to beat Togo 5-1 at the 19 May 1956 Stadium in Annaba. The hosts fell behind early following a lapse in concentration but made sure to recover in immense style.

The match started off with the Desert Foxes dominating the game and possession, with Houssem Aouar posing a huge threat on the wing. Within 10 minutes, Algeria had three good chances on goal but failed to capitalise.

Thibault Kludge would spoil the early party when he opened the scoring for Togo in the 11th minute, causing tension in the stands as fans began to anticipate an upset.

As the match progressed, Algeria took their time and eventually grabbed the equaliser through Said Behrahma in the 29th minute, making matters all square at the end of the first half.

The Foxes came into the second half with renewed vigour, and it would pay off when Benhrahma completed his brace by netting a penalty in the 55th minute putting the hosts ahead.

From there, it would be one-way traffic as the goals kept coming for the hosts. Goals from Aouar, Amine Gouiri and Mohamed Amoura as the half progressed made sure that all three points were for the taking.

The win for Algeria keeps them at the top of Group E in the qualifiers, recording their third win on the spin on their road to the next Afcon.

Algeria (1) 5 (Benrahma 29’ 55’, Aouar 68’, Gouiri 86’, Amoura 90+5)
