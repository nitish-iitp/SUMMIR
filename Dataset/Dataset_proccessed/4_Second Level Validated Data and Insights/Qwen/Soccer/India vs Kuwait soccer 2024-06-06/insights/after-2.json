        "Emotional reactions from players or coaches (e.g., 'Erik ten Hag praised his team’s resilience after coming back from 2-0 down'). Sunil Chhetri walked off the pitch in Kolkata after a short felicitation ceremony, and a shorter speech. He thanked everyone who supported him over 19 years of his career.",
        "Reflections on team journeys or tournament outcomes (e.g., 'Chelsea’s manager described the win as a crucial step toward securing a top-four finish'). Chhetri's last match for the Blue Tigers ended with India going further away from the goal of qualifying for the next round."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Weather or pitch conditions affecting the game (e.g., 'Heavy rain delayed the match by 30 minutes'). The overcast sky over Salt Lake Stadium reflected the sullen mood in the Indian camp as their talismanic striker Sunil Chhetri laced up his boots for one final time in the World Cup qualifier against Kuwait – a match that ultimately ended in 0-0.",
        "Historical comparisons or records beyond match performance (e.g., 'This marked Arsenal’s 100th El Clásico victory over Real Madrid'). India has been absent from the world football stage for the last six decades. From having been a powerhouse of Asian football, we have been overtaken by those we defeated to get that acclaim — Japan, Korea, Iran. These countries are not just qualifying regularly for FIFA World Cups but excelling on the global stage."

        "Notable head-to-head statistics or unique cultural aspects (e.g., 'This was Barcelona’s 100th El Clásico victory over Real Madrid'). India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier: Sunil Chhetri's final appearance ends in goalless draw against Kuwait."
