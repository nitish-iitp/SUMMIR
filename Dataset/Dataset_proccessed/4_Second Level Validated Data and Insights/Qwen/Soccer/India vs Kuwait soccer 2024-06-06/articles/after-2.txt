India vs Kuwait Live Score World Cup Qualifier: Sunil Chhetri's Farewell Match, FIFA World Cup Qualifying

 India vs Kuwait Live Score, Sunil Chhetri Farewell Match Live Score: A near two-decade international football career came to a close on a disappointing not in Kolkata on Thursday as Sunil Chhetri played his final match in India colours. In a crucial FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Kuwait, where a win was essential for India to advance to the next stage, they played out a 0-0 draw where they huffed and puffed but couldn’t break the door down.

The 39-year-old Chhetri had confirmed a couple of weeks back that he will hang his (international) boots at the end of this match. More than any personal finishing touch, Chhetri would have liked to ensure that the team enters the final stage of the World Cup qualifiers for the first time. But it wasn’t to be for him and the Indian side who struggled for most of the night. The draw severely dents India’s chance of moving to the next phase as they finish this round against Qatar, while Afghanistan and Kuwait play each other.

What Chhetri had to say before the match

“I am trying really hard to not think about this game like this. It’s not about me and my last game. It’s about us and Kuwait. Inside, I am fighting this small battle. Please don’t make it worse by asking me again and again how I am feeling. I don’t want to address it. We really need to win this game. This is not going to be easy, but we are ready. We will have tremendous support here in Kolkata,” Chhetri said a day ahead of his highly-anticipated farewell. Read more about the pre-match buzz by Sayak Dutta here.

Repor by Sayak Dutta: Sunil Chhetri's Indian farewell ends in dull 0-0 draw against Kuwait

An overcast sky over Salt Lake Stadium reflected the sullen mood in the Indian camp as their talismanic striker Sunil Chhetri laced up his boots for one final time in the World Cup qualifier against Kuwait – a match that ultimately ended in 0-0, with India’s dream of qualifying for the next round getting even harder to realise.

As Dinesh Karthik had said in a recent video after his retirement after Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s elimination from this year’s Indian Premier League, “In sport, there are no fairytale endings,” Chhetri’s last match for the Blue Tigers ended with India going further away from the goal of qualifying for the next round.

The emotions that he kept from bubbling over all these days, came out in the form of tears as the Indian players gave him a guard of honour as Chhetri took the final walk from the field into the locker room. The curtains fell for one of the best strikers of the country who rode off into the sunset with 94 goals in 151 matches.

So, looking forward, Qatar vs Afghanistan is currently 0-0 around the 40th minute. India will be hoping Qatar do them a favour there and beat Afghanistan. Then the standings will be India (5 pts), Afghanistan (4 pts), Kuwait (4 pts). 

Final round: India take on Qatar and assuming they somehow manage to fight out for a draw, they can progress if Kuwait and Afghanistan also ends up as a draw. (India 6, Afghanistan 5, Kuwait 5). Kuwait have a better goal difference than India.

India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: Sunil Chhetri farewell ceremony, India 0-0 Kuwait

Some sobering thoughts from Tanay Apte's pre-match OpEd piece:

India has been absent from the world football stage for the last six decades. From having been a powerhouse of Asian football, we have been overtaken by those we defeated to get that acclaim — Japan, Korea, Iran. These countries are not just qualifying regularly for FIFA World Cups but excelling on the global stage. In recent times, Japan has defeated Germany, Korea has reached the World Cup semifinals and Iran has drawn with Portugal. If India wins this crucial fixture against Kuwait at the Salt Lake stadium in Kolkata, we will regain our place among these big guns — for the time being.

The downfall of the Indian men’s national team can be put down to an amalgamation of shortcomings in governance, a non-existent grassroots structure, a small player pool, quality of coaching, bad infrastructure, and the concentration of football culture in certain pockets of the country. The Indian Super League (ISL) promised us a new dawn upon its establishment in 2014 but a decade on, it has lost its title sponsor, failed to become sustainable and created a hyper-inflated player market dictated by intermediaries which has directly led to the creation of a comfort zone for players who have no incentive to test themselves in a tougher league with a lower pay package.

A word from the former hockey captain, to now the former football captain.




Having said all the nice things about Chhetri, Im really worried about Indian football. That was a painful 90 mins to watch. We were slow, uninspiring, barely a shot on the Kuwait goal. Struggling to string 4 passes together. Plenty of introspection needed for a game we all love.

Mihir Vasavda, an Indian football tragic, with a sobering thought: Chhetri throughout his career ensured Indian football floated over mediocrity. And Indian football's farewell gift to its captain was a performance mired in mediocrity. Not the end he deserved for all he's done for the sport in the country. Indian football has gotten so defensive that even in front of opposition goal, it's almost like players are going for a desperate clearance, momentarily forgetting they got to score. And sadly, they can't defend their own goal.

AA penny for thoughts in these moments for Chhetri. If we had to guess, it'd be perhaps one of disappointment that India didn't win, overriding almost anything else. He really wanted India to take that step forward but now there are more questions than answers.

Perhaps the most emotional moment of the night. Sunil Chhetri had a guard of honour waiting for him, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it. Stood there crying for a while, walks through eventually, then goes down the stairs. Over and out. pic.twitter.com/PW6sLGq0V8

Igor Stimac: It's been tight against Kuwait in recent times. We didn't open the game enough today, we were not aggressive enough in the middle. It's been happening for too long, not being clinical in front of goal. Today, thank god, Gurpreet was brilliant. When it matters most he's there. But other players were not there enough today. Rahim Ali, great runs he makes, but goals need to come. He could have scored from the chance he said. We have options like Manvir and Liston, need patience. 

What makes Chhetri, Chhetri: Goals, leadership... he started scoring goals and never stopped. Doing everything for the coach, doing half of the job, these are the things you can't repeat. 

21:14 (IST)
06 JUN 2024

A crushing blow to India's hopes of qualifying to the next phase, but for now, plenty of emotions as Chhetri takes a lap around the Salt Lake. Finally, the emotions get the better of him. Tears being shed as he thanks the fans who have turned up in numbers.

And it's disappointment writ large on Chhetri's face... it ends goalless. He looks down, then looks up in frustration. Perfect endings in sport are not that frequent, it wasn't tonight for Chhetri.

06 JUN 2024
India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 90+ mins

CHAOS. Edmund and Sami Al Sanea get into a tiff and they need to be separated quickly. Lots of wrestling going on but just yellow cards to both players in the end. 

20:58 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 90+ mins

Seven minutes of added time. And India with some possession in Kuwaiti box. Chhetri holds the ball well but there is too little space and too many cooks to spoil them move. Chhangte with a cross from the left flank and Manvir is unable to glance it. The ball nearly fell to Rahim earlier but the pass into the box had to be better. 

20:55 (IST)

Manvir twists and turns down the left flank, trying to make his move into the box but Meshari Al Enezi does his job at left back.

Draw is not a bad result for Kuwait and they will happily hold on here as they'd still fancy their chance against Afghanistan to get something out of this group. India though have to face Qatar and it's hard to see them get anything from that. This is their dream slipping away at the moment. 

20:52 (IST)
06 JUN 2024

Play resumes and Suresh has to concede a corner. It's been a tame last few minutes but can Kuwait snatch it late? They try a flick from the near post but India defend it alright. Crowd getting restless. 

20:50 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
1India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 85 mins

Change for India as Edmund comes on for Jay Gupta in a swap of debutants. The commentators mention that Edmund becomes the first player in 5 years to play for India from the I-League. He plays for Inter Kashi. A Iull in the game as Kuwait makes a change too and there are some treatments going on. Could be a big chunk of added time. 

20:49 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
1India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 83 mins

Anwar Ali with a calm clearance as Ali Khalaf ran through on goal. Then a shot on goal from distance is saved by Gurpreet. Down the left flank, India should have done better but Rahim's pass is not good to Chhangte. 

20:47 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 80 mins

India with some head tennis down the left flank and the ball eventually trickles out of play harmlessly. Kuwait have made a 2nd change. Sultan Al Enezi comes on. 

20:43 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 77 mins

It's getting sloppy in the middle from both teams. Tired legs. Tired minds. Chhangte seems to have switched to the left, his cross to Manvir is too deep. India lose possession after a poor cross from Brandon. 

20:41 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 74 mins

NO PENALTY: And it's a big moment right after the break. Long ball over India's defence, Anwar Ali nearly gets into a tangle as the last man, Yousef Al Sulaiman with brilliant touch. Did Anwar get a touch on the ball? Not clear from the replays but Robin Singh reckons on air that the Indian defender is a lucky man. 

20:39 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
India vs Kuwait, FIFA World Cup Qualifier LIVE: IND 0-0 KUW after 72 mins

It's a water break. There seems to be a hush in the stadium. Not quite the bang (yet) that Chhetri would have hoped for. He'd not care one bit if someone else scores, but India need a goal desperately from somewhere. 

20:37 (IST)

Brandon is making an impact too, that's a lovely through ball down the right channel and Chhangte runs behind the defence but the Kuwaiti defender deals with it. Corner for India, Brandon delivers, Chhetri in the mix but cleared away.

Shashank Nair: Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has had to make a couple of really good stops this game. He's going to have to continue to do it for another half for this to work for India. Because as things stand, Kuwait have shown they can penetrate the Indian backline with ease.

After another looped ball behind Kuwait's defence, Rahim is through on goal again but his shot is once again weak. But at least he is creating these chances, has made an impact. Chhetri is playing deeper in Sahal's role now.

Shashank Nair: Rahim Ali has missed the easiest chance of his life.  One on one against the Kuwait keeper with simply no reason to not score. He instead mistimes the ball, keeps it on the ground and straight at the keeper. A horrible miss in a game that desperately needed a goal. What will life after Chhetri look like indeed.

Two changes for India, there we go, Stimac rolling his dice early. Rahim Ali and Brandon Fernandes come in, for Sahal and Thapa. India's attacks have been lopsided, largely down the right flank led by Chhangte. They'd need more down the left flank.

Shashank Nair: Halftime and it's been a tough watch. This Kolkata humidity has sapped the energy out of both teams -- and that's good for India because they've managed to keep a lot more control of the midfield than they would have. But Kuwait have been easily able to penetrate India's defensive line when they've wanted to and all that remains is that finishing touch that's been missing from their ranks.

19:54 (IST)

HALF TIME: Once the early euphoria was set aside, this has been a rather ordinary half of football. Kuwait the better team but just about perhaps. They should have taken the early lead but Gurpreet came up with a big save. India had a couple of half chances from cutbacks, Anwar came the closest from a corner but the passing from both teams has been disjoint. Work to do for both coaches. 

19:52 (IST)

Sahal with a really poor pass in midfield, it's 3v2 in favour of Kuwait, and they play a ridiculously poor pass too. Both coaches will really need to get their act together for their teams work with the ball at half time. 

19:51 (IST)

Oh dear. Chhangte does so well to win a corner but everything after that is poor. The ball is cleared out then Nikhil plays a ridiculous pass from midfield to lose the ball, then Gurpreet hits a first-time ball from halfway line all the way over to the corner flag.

Apropos the previous update, once the dust has settled on the Chhetri retirement sentiment, questions have to be asked once again about India's identity as a footballing nation. It's all been so disjointed.

Tanay Apte had written this in a recent OpEd on The Indian Express: As the debate of style vs results continues to rage, the recent FIFA World Cup qualifier performances and results against Afghanistan in March earlier this year have brought the spotlight back onto Stimac. What should have been two wins and six points ended in a draw away and a defeat at home with just one point gained. The coach was accused of being tactically outwitted and the players of not being worthy of the national team jersey. They all have a chance to make amends on June 6 and usher in a new era and if they succeed, there will be at least 10 matches to play against Asia’s best. Everyone will have to raise their game — including the All India Football Federation (AIFF) — on and off the field. The prospect of hosting high-profile teams should bring in the required upgrades with respect to infrastructure and planning. The fans will get to see world-class players in action and the players will get a chance to compete against them.

Chhetri has a point. India must not risk getting overwhelmed by emotions in a match where they have to be cold-blooded to eke out a favourable result. (AIFF)

Everyone is talking about Sunil Chhetri. But Chhetri wants the focus to be on just India vs Kuwait

Everyone is talking about Sunil Chhetri.

Lallianzuala Chhangte, the speedy winger, ‘hopes and believes it would be me assisting Chhetri bhai’. Sahal Abdul Samad, the stylish midfielder, vowed to ‘fight for Sunil bhai.’ Defender Subhashish Bose wants the team to win, which would be ‘a farewell gift for Sunil bhai.’

Coach Igor Stimac couldn’t hide his emotions, saying how ‘sad’ he was that his – rather, Indian football’s Man Friday – will retire from international football after the 2026 World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup qualifier against Kuwait here on Thursday. (READ MORE)
