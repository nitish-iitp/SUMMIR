        "Paolo Nicolato's team were thumped 4-1 by Armenia in their inaugural match of the 2024-25 edition, while their visitors held North Macedonia to a 1-1 draw in a tale of two penalties.",
        "Latvia's only success during the Nicolato era so far coincidentally came against none other than the Faroe Islands, whom they overcame 1-0 in the Baltic Cup third-placed playoff to avoid a first-ever fourth-placed finish at the biennial competition.",
        "The Faroe Islands only lost their advantage on Saturday due to a cheap penalty, they were under the cosh for large periods and could have easily been put to the sword on another day.",
        "The Faroe Islands are enjoying their second straight campaign of third-tier football, having comfortably retained their League C status in 2022-23 with eight points from their six fixtures.",
        "Failure to cling onto their advantage at the weekend means that it is just one win from 17 for the National Team, though, and even that was against little Liechtenstein."

        "Latvia almost came through their heavy loss to Armenia unscathed on the physical front, but playmaker Janis Ikaunieks - the highest active scorer in the 11 Wolves ranks with 12 goals to his name - was forcibly withdrawn in the 82nd minute.",
        "A young team should be captained by 23-year-old defender Kristers Tobers, while Dubra was hooked for Daniels Balodis after his own goal at the weekend and could now make way for his fellow centre-back, even at the risk of severely knocking his confidence.",
        "The Faroe Islands were not forced into any premature changes in their draw with North Macedonia; centre-back Samuel Chukwudi only lasted until half time, but that was seemingly a tactical change from Ericson.",
        "Hordur Askham - who replaced Chukwudi for the second half of that fixture - could now come in from the first whistle for the visitors, whose line will be led by a man who coincidentally plays his club football in North Macedonia in Joan Simun Edmundsson."
