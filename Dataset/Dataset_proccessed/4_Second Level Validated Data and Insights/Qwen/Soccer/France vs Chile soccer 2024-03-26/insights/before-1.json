        "France will look to recover from Saturday's defeat to Germany when they welcome Chile to the Stade Velodrome on Tuesday.",
        "That was a first home defeat in almost two years for the French, while Chile will look to spring another surprise after a fine result of their own over the weekend.",
        "Les Bleus never really reacted to that early blow, with Kai Havertz netting again in the second half as Germany beat France for the second time in six months.",
        "It was the first time they have failed to win a home game since a UEFA Nations League defeat to Croatia in 2022, so getting back on track here will be the main objective.",
        "Didier Deschamps's men remain favourites for Euro 2024, and for good reason, but Saturday's outing shows that nothing is a given in international football.",
        "After cruising to qualification with 22 points from a possible 24, an improvement on their quarter-final elimination at Euro 2020 is an absolute must, but anything but a win here may see some become a little more reserved about France's prospects."
