        "I’m frustrated with the result but I’m not frustrated with the performance",
        "We were very dominant in the first half, we created excellent chances with some very good passages of play and our transition through the pitch was excellent",
        "It’s a positive certainly, not something to be too negative about",
        "When you see how the game played out, we’re disappointed not to take three points but we’ve got a home game now against Bulgaria and if we win that it will put us in a strong position",
        "The key in any group is to come away from home and not be beaten, so we’ll take the positive of not being beaten tonight"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Northern Ireland peppered Fedor Lapoukhov’s goal with shots in the opening 45 minutes",
        "Northern Ireland had 12 attempts at goal in the first half, forcing Lapoukhov into seven saves",
        "Belarus did a better job of shutting down space in the second half",
        "Some of our senior players like Paddy (McNair) and Jamal (Lewis) have played very little football, so it’s hard for them to maintain that level",
        "This was arguably to most awkward of Northern Ireland’s away fixtures in this Nations League campaign, not so much in terms of the opposition – Belarus are, despite recent improvement, the lowest ranked team in the group – but because of the neutral venue and the game being behind closed doors"
