        "Germany, led by Julian Nagelsmann, are sitting comfortably at the top of League A Group 3, having bagged four points from their opening two games.",
        "After demolishing Hungary 5-0, they followed it up with a 2-2 draw against the Netherlands.",
        "Bosnia are languishing in third, having only one point to their name. The Dragons have yet to make any serious mark in the competition and will be desperate to change their fortunes.",
        "The big question heading into this encounter is whether Bosnia can capitalise on Germany’s somewhat weakened line-up, given the absence of key players like Kai Havertz, Jamal Musiala, and Leroy Sané.",
        "Despite having Edin Dzeko upfront, the Dragons have not found the back of the net consistently enough to suggest they can cause problems for Germany.",
        "With players like Antonio Rudiger and Jonathan Tah marshalling Germany’s backline, Dzeko’s efforts might not be enough."
