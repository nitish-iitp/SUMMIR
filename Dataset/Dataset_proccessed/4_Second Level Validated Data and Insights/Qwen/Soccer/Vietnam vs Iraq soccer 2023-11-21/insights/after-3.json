        "We will make every effort to get good results against Iraq. Each opponent has a different playing style and my goal is to adjust accordingly to make things difficult for them.",
        "I know Iraq and their position. It can be considered that Iraq is currently in the top 5 or 6 in Asia. Therefore, in theory, Iraq is rated higher than the Vietnam team.",
        "But my players will go into the game with the mindset of having nothing to lose, and the desire to prove everyone wrong.",
        "Iraq are a strong opponent. They just beat Indonesia 5-1. The advantage for us is that we play at home and have the support of our fans."
