Ivory Coast vs Nigeria Prediction: Africa Cup of Nations Match on 18.01.2024
KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Equatorial Guinea will be riding high after they held fancied Nigeria to a 1-1 draw in their opening match. They will look for three points to bolster their chances of making it out of Group A into the knockout stages.

Heading into the tournament, Equatorial Guinea was in good form, winning twice and drawing twice in their four matches ahead of the tournament. They will hope to retain their unbeaten run into the clash against Guinea-Bissau on Thursday.

Guinea Bissau started poorly in Group A, losing 2-0 against the hosts and favorites Ivory Coast. However, they were on a poor run of form ahead of the opener, winning once, drawing once, and losing twice in the lead-up to the tournament. 

BET HERE

Guinea Bissau’s inability to keep clean sheets will especially come into play when they play Equatorial Guinea as they look to solidify their chances in Group A.

INJURY REPORT

Neither side has reported injury worries after Group A’s first round of fixtures and leading up to the clash on Thursday.

PREDICTION

A draw is the football pick in this clash. Football predictions on 22bet highlight a close contest between the two sides, with Equatorial Guinea holding a slight odds edge.

Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau will fight to a draw and share the points.
