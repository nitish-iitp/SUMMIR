        "Equatorial Guinea (39.4%) edging the pre-match simulations ahead of Guinea-Bissau (33.8%).",
        "This will be the first encounter between Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations.",
        "Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau last met in March 2022, in Portugal. The friendly ended 3-0 to Guinea-Bissau.",
        "Following their 1-1 draw against Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea could go unbeaten in their opening two games of an Africa Cup of Nations for the third time out of four participations (W2 in 2012 and D2 in 2015), only failing to do so in 2022 (W1 L1).",
        "Equatorial Guinea have scored in each of their last two games at the Africa Cup of Nations and are looking to do so in three consecutive matches in the competition for the very first time.",
        "After their 2-0 defeat to Ivory Coast in the opening game, Guinea-Bissau could lose both of their opening two matches of an Africa Cup of Nations tournament for the first time.",
        "Guinea-Bissau remain winless in 10 AFCON games (D3 L7). Indeed, they have failed to score at all in their last eight games since a 2-1 defeat to Cameroon in 2017.",
        "Equatorial Guinea are unbeaten in their last three group stage games at the Africa Cup of Nations (W2 D1). They’ve never gone four such matches in a row without defeat in the competition.",

        "Against Nigeria, Iban Salvador became the first Equatorial Guinea player to either score or assist in three different Africa Cup of Nations editions (two goals, one assist). Indeed, since his debut in the competition in 2015, no player has had more shots (19) or more goal involvements (3) for the National Thunder.",
        "As well as creating a game-high four chances, no Guinea-Bissau player completed more passes ending in the final third (7), won more duels (6), or was fouled (3) more than Alfa Semedo against Ivory Coast in the opening game of this year’s AFCON."
