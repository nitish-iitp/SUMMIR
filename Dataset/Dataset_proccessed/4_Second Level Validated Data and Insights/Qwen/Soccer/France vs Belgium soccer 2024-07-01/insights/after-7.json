        "Didier Deschamps won’t care. All that matters, the French coach would strenuously argue, is that they got there.",
        "It felt like everyone was going to wait for a goal here. Instead, France got their third of the tournament, but not one has been a clean effort into the net from open play.",
        "They are going to be very hard to beat. They just make actually winning very hard work, too.",
        "More pressure should be on. Maybe it illustrates the limits of this approach."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The best you could say was the goal was at least preceded by a clever angled pass from Antoine Griezmann.",
        "Mike Maignan was strong.",
        "Belgium’s best moments came when De Bruyne suddenly broke, once to elegantly link a counterattack, next with a typically forceful long shot from distance."
