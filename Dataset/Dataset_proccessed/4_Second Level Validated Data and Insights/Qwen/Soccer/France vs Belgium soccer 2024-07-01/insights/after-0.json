    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "France have sleepwalked into the quarters. If they don’t wake up soon, their luck will surely run out eventually.",
        "France have won all five of their meetings with Belgium at major international tournaments (Euros/World Cup), the joint-best 100% win rate one European nation has against another across the two competitions combined (Italy also winning all five of their encounters with Austria)",
        "France have reached the quarter-finals at the UEFA European Championship for a sixth time, with no side reaching the final eight on more occasions than Les Bleus (level with Spain and Portugal, before their last-16 encounter with Slovenia this evening)",
        "Belgium have now failed to score in five of their last six games at major international tournaments (Euros/World Cup), despite having a combined 59 attempts on goal and posting an xG of 6.85 across those five goalless matches",
        "France have scored three goals at Euro 2024, with two of those being own goals (Austria’s Max Wöber and Belgium’s Jan Vertonghen) and the other coming from the penalty spot (Kylian Mbappé v Poland)",
        "Aged 37 years and 68 days, Belgium’s Jan Vertonghen became the oldest ever player to score an own goal at the UEFA European Championship",
        "France midfielder N’Golo Kante has now played the outright most matches in European Championship history without ever ending on the losing side (P12 W7 D5)",
        "Aurélien Tchouaméni made 21-line-breaking passes in this match, with 15 of those occurring in the final third; both the most by a French player in a match at Euro 2024 so far",
        "Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco became the 11th different Italian to take charge of a knockout stage game at the UEFA European Championship; the most different managers of any nation, moving ahead of German coaches (10)"
