How Hungary could line up against Germany

Hungary head coach Marco Rossi is still sweating over a pair of fitness doubts ahead of Wednesday's Euro 2024 Group A clash with Germany in Stuttgart.

The Magyars are at risk of seeing their top-two dreams evaporate early thanks to a 3-1 loss to Switzerland at the weekend, where neither right-back Loic Nego nor midfielder Callum Styles were fit to feature.

The pair are closing in on comebacks, though, being put through their paces in training with the ball at their feet, but Rossi is not expected to throw either of them into the starting lineup just yet.

The Hungarians are in good shape otherwise and should line up in their recognisable 3-4-2-1 shape from the first whistle, starting with Peter Gulacsi in goal as ever and RB Leipzig teammate Willi Orban protecting him.

Adam Lang was a half-time withdrawal against Switzerland but should also reprise his role at the back, as will Attila Szalai, who will incur a one-game suspension if he picks up a yellow card on Wednesday.

However, the man who replaced Lang - Bendeguz Bolla - could be a straight swap for 34-year-old Attila Fiola on the right-hand side, but Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez is safe on the opposite flank.

Styles's knock means that Andras Schafer and Adam Nagy are set to link arms as the midfield duo, just behind 50-cap Roland Sallai and 23-year-old Dominik Szoboszlai, now the youngest captain in the history of the men's Euros.

After missing one gilt-edged header against Switzerland, Barnabas Varga got one right just a few minutes later to briefly spark a Hungary revival - which was ultimately short-lived - and the Ferencvaros striker will operate as his nation's focal point once more.

Hungary possible starting lineup:
Gulacsi; Orban, Lang, Szalai; Bolla, Nagy, Schafer, Kerkez; Sallai, Szoboszlai; Varga
