Prediction: 2-1

	

Serbia

Denmark will look to build on a 2-0 win over Switzerland when they take on Serbia in a highly-anticipated UEFA Nations League game. The Danes kicked off their Nations League campaign in style and they are seen as favourites to win Sunday’s clash as well. Lecce defender Patrick Dorgu is pushing for a rare start after scoring the opener against the Rossocrociati, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team.

The Serbs, on the other hand, did remarkably well to hold star-studded Spain to a goalless draw in their opener despite the fact that the likes of Dusan Tadic, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Aleksandar Mitrovic, and Dusan Vlahovic are out of contention. Dragan Stojkovic’s men, though, are not regarded as good travellers and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Denmark’s party at Parken Stadium. Stojkovic is unlikely to make changes to the team that faced the European champions in Belgrade.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (PREDRAG RAJKOVIC):

Predrag Rajkovic is a professional footballer who plays for Stade Reims and the Serbian National team. Born on the 31st of October, 1995, the Serbian goalkeeper spent his youth career with Hajduk Velijko and Jagodina before signing a professional contract, his first, with the latter in 2012.

His first professional appearance came on the 9th of March, 2013, in a Serbian Superliga match against Partizan. A two-year stint at Red Star Belgrade succeeded Rajkovic's time at Jagodina, after which he moved to Israel to join Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2015. At Aviv, the six-foot-tall established himself as a first-team regular, and in his four-year spell at the club, he made 192 appearances, kept 90 clean sheets and won the Toto Cup.

The 24-year old now plays in Ligue one with Stade Reims and is on a contract that expires in 2023. At the International level, Rajkovic is a former youth international and has capped at every youth level for Serbia. He made his senior team debut meanwhile on the 14th of August, 2013, in a friendly match against Colombia.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (DENMARK):

The Denmark national team participated at the World Cup finals on four occasions and they recorded their best result at the 1998 tournament. The Danes made it to the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup in France, but Brazil proved to be a big catch for the Nordic side. De Rod-Hvide did remarkably well to win the 1992 European Championship, but they were more than fortunate to qualify for the Euro 1992 finals.

Denmark finished their qualifying campaign in second place in the group, but thanks to Yugoslavia’s exclusion from the competition, the team booked their place at the Euro 1992 finals. Denmark impressed at the tournament in Sweden, with the team outplaying Germany in the title game (2-0).

Brothers Michael and Bryan Laudrup and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel are regarded as Denmark’s most notable players. It has to be noted that Morten Olsen was in charge of the Danish national team from 2000 to 2015. The Danes play their home games at Telia Parken and the capacity of the venue is 38,065 (all-seater).
