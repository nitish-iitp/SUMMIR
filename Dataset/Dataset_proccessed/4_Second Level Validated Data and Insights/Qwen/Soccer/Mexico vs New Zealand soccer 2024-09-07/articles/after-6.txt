Javier Aguirre’s third stint in charge of the Mexico Men’s National Team began with a statement 3-0 win over New Zealand on Saturday.

It was one-way traffic inside a sparse Rose Bowl as Mexico, under new management, hit the ground running against a struggling New Zealand side.

Without Guillermo Ochoa, Edson Álvarez, Raúl Jiménez or Hirving “Chucky” Lozano on the roster, a new group of talent put their best foot forward in the new Aguirre era.

It took less than five minutes for the Oceanic side to concede after failing to clear the ball in the box. A lurking Orbelin Pineda then volleyed home Mexico’s first goal from their last three games.

Despite El Tri dominating the match with 13 shots to two, New Zealand’s defence managed to keep them tame. Santiago Gimenez had another night to forget for the national side as his goal drought continued.

A substitution was key to doubling the lead early in the second half. After only about 60 seconds on the pitch, a right-footed shot from Cesar Huerta had El Tri up by two.

And with that second goal, the floodgates opened. Pineda was this time the creator as Luis Romo’s shot from outside the box found the bottom right corner for Mexico’s third of the game.

New Zealand had to wait until the 70th minute to register their first effort on target via Matthew Garbett in what will be a night to forget.
