        "Belgium asserted their credentials at Euro 2024 with a 2-0 victory over Romania.",
        "After the shock of a defeat to Slovakia in their opening match, it looked like they might meekly depart the international stage at an early juncture once more. In Cologne they fired back with a vibrant performance in one of the most entertaining matches of the tournament.",

        "Jan Vertonghen slotted into defence effortlessly, while De Bruyne turned in the kind of performance we see on a regular basis for Manchester City.",

        "All three teams in Group E are now on three points ahead of the final fixtures.",

        "Romania's Dennis Man had Romania's best chance in the second half, which was smothered by Koen Casteels."
