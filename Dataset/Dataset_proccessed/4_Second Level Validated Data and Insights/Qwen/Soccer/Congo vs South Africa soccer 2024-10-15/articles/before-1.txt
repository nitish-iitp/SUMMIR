Preview: Congo vs. South Africa - prediction, team news, lineups

Three important points are up for grabs at Stade Alphonse Massemba-Debat on Tuesday as Congo entertain the challenge of South Africa in round four of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.
 
The hosts need a win to get their AFCON pursuit back on track before the final set of matches in November, while the visitors set out in search of a win that would confirm their place in Morocco.

Seeking to continue their recent resurgence, South Africa turned on the style in front of goal as they ran out emphatic 5-0 winners against Congo in Friday's encounter at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.
 
A first-half double from Teboho Mokoena set Hugo Broos's men on their way to all three points after which Bathusi Aubaas, Lyle Foster and Iqraam Rayners all got in on the act either side of the interval.
 
It is now 11 matches since the Bafana Bafana were last beaten, and that recent resurgence has propelled them to second place in their AFCON qualifying group, trailing Uganda only on goal difference.
 
Defeating Congo DR via a penalty shootout, South Africa picked up the bronze medal from the most recent AFCON tournament in Ivory Coast earlier this year and will be keen to go one better in next year's continental event.
 
Currently with the joint-most goals midway through the qualifiers (10), Tuesday's visitors will fancy their chances of putting on another attacking masterclass to secure their AFCON berth in grand style away from home.

Targeting a return to the continental scene for the first time in 10 years, Congo kicked off their qualifying journey with a narrow 1-0 victory over South Sudan on September 5, but things have not gone as planned since then.
 
Isaac Ngata's men suffered a 2-0 defeat to Uganda in their subsequent outing four days later before being on the receiving end of a comprehensive 5-0 thrashing against South Africa last time out.
 
That was in keeping with a torrid 2024 so far for the Red Devils, who have managed just one win from six matches in all competitions this year, losing four of the other five.
 
Interim manager Ngata has endured a rough spell since taking over from Paul Put on a temporary basis back in 2023, and it is highly unlikely the 59-year-old's appointment is made permanent.
 
Sitting third in Group K at the moment, Tuesday's hosts are behind both South Africa and Uganda by four points, and a win for both teams in the next round of matches would spell the end of Congo's AFCON ambitions.

Off the back of his double against Congo, Teboho Mokoena has now scored eight times for South Africa—more than any other active player with the exception of Percy Tau and Themba Zwane.
 
Having netted in each of his last five games for club and country, forward Iqraam Rayners continues to knock on the door for a first international start since June.
 
With Lyle Foster coming off with an injury scare midway through the second half last time out, Rayners could earn a recall to the visitors' lineup to lead the line.
 
Christopher Ibayi was handed his full debut for Congo in the defeat to South Africa, but the 29-year-old failed to impress and could drop to the bench here.
 
Christoffer Mafoumbi recently racked up his 38th cap to move level with fellow goalkeeper Brice Samba into 10th place on the hosts' all-time appearances chart.


Congo possible starting lineup:
Mafoumbi; Poaty, Bidounga, Makosso, Andzouana; Ndockyt, Otanga, Makouta; Mboungou, Ibayi, Ganvoula

South Africa possible starting lineup:
Williams; Modiba, Dortley, Kekana, Mudau; Mokoena, Aubaas; Appollis, Mokwana; Foster, Zwane



We say: Congo 1-3 South Africa

Still buoyed by their commanding victory last time out, South Africa will head into this one on a high, and it is hard to bet against them completing a double over Congo.
 
We fully expect Broos's men to claim a routine win over the hosts and secure safe passage into the AFCON group phase.
