That’s it from me, I hope you enjoyed following along as Australia staggered to a 2-0 victory in Bangladesh. It puts them in a strong position to overtake South Korea in the Fifa world rankings and be placed in the more favourable “pot one” for the next qualifying round.

We’ll be back again on Tuesday when the Socceroos host Palestine in Perth, but for now catch up on Joey Lynch’s report and some pointed feedback from coach Graham Arnold:

Socceroos overcome Bangladesh and ‘dangerous’ pitch to earn World Cup qualifying win

Graham Arnold said that he’s happy with the performance and called out the humid conditions as being a factor that might not be obvious to those at home in Australia. The Socceroos coach also added a very brief review of Irankunda’s debut while speaking to Paramount Plus:

“Nestor was very good. He’s obviously got a lot to learn and a long way to go but it was great to see him on the pitch.”

The young man of the moment, Nestory Irankunda, is speaking to Paramount Plus about his debut Socceroos appearance that included an assist as well as two shots.

“I could have done better with my performance but I’m really proud to obviously cap for the nation, it’s a dream come true for me,” Irankunda said. “We did well for the conditions, I don’t know how hot it is but it’s as humid as hell. I guess we struggled with the heat but we still got the result, clean sheet as well.

Full-time: Bangladesh 0-2 Australia

Australia have done what they needed to do to keep their perfect record intact in the 2026 World Cup qualifying second round. But they didn’t have it all their own way as Bangladesh limited their chances and the Socceroos mostly failed to make the most of those that they had.

Ajdin Hrustic was a key to the opener, which was later called an own goal for what was a critical deflection off the midfielder’s long-range strike. Jordy Bos found Kusini Yengi with a cross into the six-yard box for the second.

Another clean sheet – making it five from five in this qualification round – will of course please coach Arnold, but goalkeeper Gauci and the Socceroos defence were never really tested and will have stiffer challenges to come.

Irankunda had a few nice moments, mostly in the second half, while the revitalised Arzani was lively when called on to replace the 18-year-old debutant.

Bos once again impressed in green and gold, this time while starting from left-back although he spent much of the match in the attacking half. The versatile 21-year-old was the most likely of the Socceroos to drive into the box or to find his teammates with a cross including one for an assist.

90 mins: The referee is more than willing to put the players out of their misery now, with only three minutes of added time signalled despite stoppages that called for much more than that.

Share
6 Jun 2024
08.34 EDT

86 mins: Both sides seem somewhat content with the scoreline now, but there is likely to be a decent stretch of stoppage time as the Bangladesh players in particular are taking as much time as possible to get to their feet.

Daniel Arzani adds a spark from nowhere with a cheeky nutmeg that opens up the right side, but the ball drifts the wrong side of the sideline just as he darts into the box. Arnold would be very happy to see more of that from the one-time wunderkind though.

08.30 EDT

83 mins: A first yellow card in a game that has seen a handful of tough challenges but mostly been played in the right spirit. Rimon Hossain receives the caution, while Bangladesh make another change as Rahmat replaces Isa Faysal.

Share
6 Jun 2024
08.27 EDT

81 mins: The game has slowed to a crawl as fatigue seems to have set in for both sides.

That has allowed time for Mark Watchorn to get in touch, and sounds like his loyalties might be divided more than he is letting on: “Shout out please to me and Dan from the British High Commission, who are in the stands supporting the Socceroos. Last game I was at was the FA Cup Final!”

08.25 EDT

76 mins: Substitutions for both sides and they take a hard-earned drinks break.

Aziz Behich and Cameron Devlin enter the fray for Australia, as Jackson Irvine Conor Metcalfe make way.

Bangladesh have brought on Shakil Hossain, Rimon Hossain and Chandon Roy, with Tariq Kazi, Saad Uddin and Sohel Rana stepping out.

69 mins: After a break in play while multiple players take time out to call for attention, or more likely just fluids in the hot conditions, Taggart almost makes an immediate impact with a shot from just behind the penalty spot. The ball flies agonisingly wide and the Perth Glory striker looks horrified with the missed opportunity.

64 mins: Yengi has given the Socceroos the breathing space they craved and Graham Arnold pulls the goalscorer from the field with his job done for the day.

Daniel Arzani comes on for his first international match since 2018 as Nestory Irankunda makes way, while Adam Taggart replaces Yengi up front alongside Duke.

GOAL! Bangladesh 0-2 Australia (Yengi, 62)

Jordy Bos bends a well-placed cross from the left onto the head of Kusini Yengi at the far post, the striker nodding it into the far corner to make it goals in back-to-back matches for the Socceroos.

Kusini Yengi's last contribution before being substituted? Score. 🥶@yengikusini ⚽

08.04 EDT

57 mins: Irankunda shows glimpses of the talents we’re used to seeing, taking a crossfield pass around the defender with a deft touch and surging into the box. He finds an opening for a shot but loses his footing a little just as he swings his left boot through the shot. The 18-year-old has looked more comfortable in the second half and was perhaps only undone by the increasingly slippery surface.

53 mins: Jackson Irvine is the next Socceroo to take to the turf after a physical challenge. Once again the attempts at a peace offering are waved away, but Australia can have few complaints as they have given as well as they’ve received so far.

07.57 EDT

50 mins: Graham Arnold makes his first substitution but not for the reasons he would have hoped for just a few minutes ago during the break. Hrustic has made way for Josh Nisbet, with what seems to have been as a precaution rather than through any great concern, but will still leave a slight worry given the Socceroos creator’s injury history.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.54 EDT

47 mins: Hrustic is down on hands and knees after copping two blows in quick succession that left him more than displeased. Rakib Hossain made the first challenge as the Socceroos’ midfielder turned to protect the ball, while Sohel Rana came flying in moments later and appeared to leave an impression on the back of his ankle. Hrustic brushes away Rana’s attempts to shake it out.

Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has flagged his intention to use his full squad across these two World Cup qualifiers, but could now be looking to swing changes as much out of necessity as simply opportunity.

Australia might have dominated possession and territory but have, once again lacked a cutting edge, as revealed by having eight shots with only two on target against a brave Bangladesh side that are happy to sit back and defend. The 22 crosses that have been sent into the box have hardly threatened, though that is in part due to their targets failing to make something of the half-chances.

It might be 1-0 to Australia but, especially in the stifling conditions, they would like to put this to bed when play resumes.

Half-time: Bangladesh 0-1 Australia

A much-improved performance from Bangladesh compared to their visit to Melbourne in November, when they trailed 4-0 at the break, has frustrated Australia and limited their opportunities.

45 mins: Bangladesh give away a soft free kick that is at least well outside the box. ​​After a long discussion, Hrustic overruns the ball and Strain sends it into the box only for Souttar to head high and wide. Australia really need to find their range with headers if they are going to continue with the aerial attacks.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.33 EDT

43 mins: Duke fails to make the most of another opportunity as the ball glances off Yengi’s head and soars towards the veteran striker at the back post. He is too slow to respond as a diving attempt falls short.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.30 EDT

39 mins: Australia move the ball from right to left at speed, starting with Irankunda, passing through the centre-backs then ending with the increasingly impressive Bos. The left-back takes the initiative to surge forward, finds Irvine at the top of the box then receives it back to continue his run into the box. Three Bangladesh defenders swarm and Bos runs out of room then tumbles to ground, leaping up with a claim for a penalty.

It looked a close call and might have gone Australia’s way if Bos had controlled the ball a touch better under pressure.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.25 EDT

35 mins: The Socceroos will get around Irankunda for his part in the opener but the starlet is yet to truly make his mark on debut. Most of Australia’s better moments have come down the left side, especially when Bos gets involved, but it strangely hasn’t been the visitor’s preferred avenue to attack.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.22 EDT

32 mins: Bangladesh have their first opportunity near goal but Rakib Hossain snatches at the shot and it sails high and wide. Australia have taken their foot off the pedal a little since the restart, perhaps part of the plan in the conditions with sweat dripping off the locals as much as the visitors.

GOAL! Bangladesh 0-1 Australia (Mehedi og, 29)

It takes a slice of fortune but Australia find a breakthrough. Nestory Irankunda passes backwards to Ajdin Hrustic to take a speculative left-footed shot from well outside the box. It was unlikely to test the keeper but a stretched-out leg from Mehedi Hasan deflects the ball into the far corner.

07.15 EDT

26 mins: Bangladesh started with a defensive line-up and it has surely all gone to plan so far, with Australia creating few genuine chances of note. Jordy Bos sends a pinpoint cross towards Mitch Duke who arrives late into the box and should have made better contact flying over the penalty spot as the ball skims off his head. Signs of frustration now for the visitors.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.12 EDT

22 mins: Australia are suddenly the side looking a little shaky, with a few mis-placed passes and ill-timed tackles. Ryan Strain gets forward down the right but punts his first cross straight into the player standing in front of him and follows up by sending the next one well over the goal.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.08 EDT

19 mins: Irvine crosses from the left of the penalty box and picks out Yengi at the back post, but the striker can’t get enough power behind his header to threaten the goal. Bangladesh doing as much as can be expected now, and a pair of fouls from Australia give the home side time to take a breather.

07.05 EDT

17 mins: Irankunda takes his first real shot as a Socceroo bringing the ball inside and striking from just outside the penalty box with a move that would be familiar to A-League fans. But this time the 18-year-old is on his weaker left foot and he scuffs the shot to release the pressure for Bangladesh.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.03 EDT

15 mins: The ball is stuck in the one half again as Bangladesh struggle to hold onto it long enough to control it past half way. A ricochet near the middle of the pitch gives the Socceroos a scare until Joe Gauci comes storming out of his box to start another attack with his feet.

Share
6 Jun 2024
07.01 EDT

12 mins: Australia are knocking the ball around now, probing for an opening that refuses to reveal itself. A corner very nearly results in the opener, as Souttar gets his head to the ball and it slices towards Irvine at the back post. The Socceroos skippers tries to get his body behind the ball from 1m out, but it bounces off his thigh into the air and Bangladesh eventually clear.

06.58 EDT

9 mins: Bangladesh have settled better now, and a long clearance calls the Australia defence into action for the first time tonight. Kye Rowles clears the danger before it risks turning into anything of concern.

6 Jun 2024
06.56 EDT

7 mins: Jordy Bos makes a scything run to bypass three Bangladesh defenders and surge into the box but slips at the crucial moment and the ball is cleared. The wing-back stays down for longer than coach Arnold would like but eventually gets onto his feet and brushes away thick mud from his arm.

Share
6 Jun 2024
06.53 EDT

5 mins: Irankunda has started on the right but is drifting more centrally with Bangladesh already setting up a low block at the top of their box. The debutant almost - almost - gathers a through ball that would have had him in on goal, but it rolls just out of reach.

3 mins: First corner for Australia and cracks in the Bangladesh defence are already starting to appear. The corner is headed away but the home side are already on the ropes.

1 min: Australia straight into attack with a free kick 30m away from goal sent sharply into the penalty box. Irvine has time to receive the ball and turn, but loses control under little pressure from the defenders and it dribbles out for a goal kick.

It is little more than six months ago that Jamie Maclaren scored a hat-trick as the Socceroos crushed Bangladesh 7-0 at AAMI Park.

That clash continued the trend in matches between the two sides, where Australia load up on goals at one end while shutting up shop at the other – their two other meetings, both in 2015, finished 4-0 and 5-0.

While much of the spotlight will be on Irankunda, a player that was once in the enviable role of much-hyped prodigy is back in the Socceroos squad for the first time in six years.

Daniel Arzani last played for Australia in 2018 before injury and ill-timed moves among overseas clubs stalled his career, but he is back as a substitute tonight.

The now 25-year-old returned to some of his best form since moving to Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2023/24 season. He scored four goals and added six assists, and was arguably the best player on the pitch in the grand final until substituted before Central Coast Mariners surged home.

Arnold spoke about why he called Arzani back into the fold when announcing the squad for these two World Cup qualifiers:

Jackson Irvine will wear the captain’s armband with Socceroos skipper Mat Ryan rested, while Joe Gauci takes the gloves.

Portsmouth forward Kusini Yengi gets another opportunity up front alongside Mitch Duke as Arnold again goes with a two-pronged attack.

The midfield is also stacked with forward-thinkers, with Ajdin Hrustic and Connor Metcalfe joining Irvine in the centre of the park.

Jordan Bos is likely to spend as much time getting forward as defending, which leaves Irankunda to simply “Go out there and play to your strengths and your skills,” as Arnold insisted in the lead-up.

Martin Pegan

Hello and welcome to live coverage of the 2026 World Cup qualifier between Bangladesh and Australia. Kick-off at Bashundhara Kings Arena in Dhaka is 4:45pm local time / 8:45pm AEST.

The Socceroos resume their World Cup qualifying campaign with a place in the next stage already assured, after a near-flawless four matches that have netted 15 goals without conceding so far in the second round.

Their commanding place at the top of Group I hands Socceroos head coach Graham Arnold an opportunity to tinker with his team and finally unleash a player who looms as a generational talent in Nestory Irankunda.

The Bayern Munich-bound 18-year-old has been included in the starting XI and will earn his first senior international cap for Australia.

This could well be the ideal scenario for Irankunda to make his debut, especially after he was held back from international duties while given time to mature as a player and person with his A-League club Adelaide United.

The Socceroos are widely expected to cruise through the clash with a Bangladesh outfit that is ranked 184th in the world and offered little resistance in a 7-0 thumping in Melbourne last November.

But while Arnold might be able to experiment and even introduce fresh blood tonight, Australia have much to play for against Bangladesh and again on Tuesday when they host Palestine at HBF Park in Perth.

The Socceroos are currently ranked 24th in the Fifa world rankings but could leap over South Korea in 23rd (and only 0.06 ranking points ahead) to ensure a spot in pot one that should, in theory, earn an easier draw for the next round of World Cup qualifiers that begin in September and will feature three groups of six teams.

Even before Irankunda takes the field, we’ll have another first international cap handed out tonight, as I make my football live blog debut – if you want to get in touch, please email martin.pegan@theguardian.com or @ me on X / Twitter @martinpegan.

Our @FIFAWorldCup 2026 Qualifying campaign resumes tonight! 👊
