Game summary

In a first half in which Moldova completely dominated, the score was reflected in the 10th minute in a play in which Vadim Ra탵캒캒 went alone in front of goal and scored the 1-0. That's how they went to the break. In the second half, San Marino made several changes to turn the situation around, but failed to create dangerous chances and Moldova failed to take advantage of the spaces to increase their lead.

Selection of San Marino

San Marino's first match in a FIFA-recognized competition was on November 14, 1990, against Switzerland in a Euro 1992 qualifier, which ended in a 4-0 defeat. In the remainder of the qualifying campaign, San Marino lost all their matches, scored only one goal and conceded 33 goals. In the qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup, San Marino conceded a 0:10 defeat to Norway, but got their first positive result with a 0:0 draw against Turkey on March 10, 1993 in Serravalle. In their last match, against England at the Renato Dall'Ara Stadium in Bologna, San Marino's Davide Gualtieri scored the fastest goal in the history of the qualifying rounds at the time, eight seconds after the start, but the team ended up losing 7-1. San Marino finished bottom of the group with one point and 50 goals conceded in 27 matches.

In the years that followed, San Marino did not win a single match. In Euro 1996 qualifying, the team finished bottom with 2 goals scored and 36 conceded, scoring its first away goal in a 4-1 loss to Finland. In qualifying for the 1998 UEFA World Cup, the San Marino side lost all their matches by three goals or more without scoring a goal.
