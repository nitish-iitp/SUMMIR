Moroccan National Team topped Group F with seven points, and got qualified to the Knockouts of the competition (round of 16) on Wednesday, after defeating Zambia 1-0 as part of Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON 2023) held in Cote d’Ivoire.

Morocco will be facing next South Africa, which tied with Tunisia 0-0.

Hakim Ziyech scored Morocco’s only goal in this encounter at minute 38, just before the halftime whistle.

Morocco’s win allowed Cote d’Ivoire, the host country, to qualify for the next stage too.

The Atlas Lions won their first game against Tanzania 3-0, and tied 1-1 against the Democratic Republic of Congo.
