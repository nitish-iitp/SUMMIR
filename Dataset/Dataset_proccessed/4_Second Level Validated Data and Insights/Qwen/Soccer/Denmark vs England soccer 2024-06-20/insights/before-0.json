        "Southgate must make several changes to the side that narrowly defeated Serbia, including starting Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back and dropping Phil Foden for Anthony Gordon.",
        "Trent Alexander-Arnold has proven at club level that he is one of the world's best right-backs, but has only played 112 minutes for England during World Cups.",
        "Phil Foden is not particularly comfortable on the left, and to compensate for this Southgate allowed him to drift into central zones against Serbia.",
        "England could benefit from having a wide creator in the backline as it would give them the platform to spring direct and dangerous counter-attacks when they win possession."

        "England's lacklustre Serbia display saw them go top of Group C, but many fans were disappointed with England's display, particularly as the team increasingly ceded territory and possession to their opponents as time ticked on.",
        "Southgate will find it difficult to lead his side to victory in Euro 2024 without making difficult choices in regard to his team selection."
