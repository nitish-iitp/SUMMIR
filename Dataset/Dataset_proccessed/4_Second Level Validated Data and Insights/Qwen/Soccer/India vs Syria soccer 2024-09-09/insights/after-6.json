        "I am angry with the first half. I don't like teams who are scared. We were completely scared in the first minutes. Their goal was an action we could avoid. I'm satisfied with the second half. I think 3-0 is not what happened in the game. I think we at least deserved to score. It was a very similar game to Syria vs Mauritius. They have very good players in counter-attack, and they killed us. We need to keep going. I repeat, in the second half, not only the attitude, the positioning, we were brave,"
