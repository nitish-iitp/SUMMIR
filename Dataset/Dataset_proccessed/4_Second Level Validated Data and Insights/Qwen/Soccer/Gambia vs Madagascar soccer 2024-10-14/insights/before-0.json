        "Gambia went into last week's match as the marginal favourites and dominated the game from the first whistle, but despite managing 22 shots at goal, it took virtually the final kick of the game for them to find the back of the net.",
        "The man responsible for sparing the Scorpions' blushes was Brighton & Hove Albion's Yankuba Minteh, who netted in the seventh minute of added time beyond the 90, to cancel out Clement Couturier's opener in the second minute of stoppage time at the end of the first period.",
        "Johnny McKinstry's side is forced to play their 'home' games at a neutral venue, in this case, Morocco, due to the stadiums in Gambia failing to meet FIFA standards.",
        "Madagascar have proven that while they may not be the most attacking team around, they are certainly a tough side to beat. Their major issue has been their tendency to drop points from solid positions, having now done so in all three matches in this competition."
