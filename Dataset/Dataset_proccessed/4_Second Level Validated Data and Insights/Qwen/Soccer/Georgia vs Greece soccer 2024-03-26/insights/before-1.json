        "Georgia's Willy Sagnol's men booked their ticket to the showpiece with a 2-0 beating of 10-man Luxembourg in their semi-final showdown, while the Pirate Ship Crew hit Kazakhstan for five without reply.",
        "As Napoli wing wizard Khvicha Kvaratskhelia took his place on the naughty step for Georgia's semi-final with Luxembourg, which he was unavailable for due to suspension, the Crusaders' visitors may have arrived in Tbilisi with quiet optimism of leaving the home crowd crestfallen.",
        "However, Karlsruher SC striker Budu Zivzivadze made himself the hero in Kvaratskhelia's absence on Thursday, netting either side of the half-time whistle to sink the 10 men of Luxembourg, whose hopes of a second-half turnaround evaporated when Maxime Chanot was given his marching orders.",
        "Georgia's visitors Greece need no lessons in attacking supremacy either, as Gus Poyet's men made light work of an ostensibly tricky semi-final with an in-form Kazakhstan side, thrashing their fellow Euro 2024 hopefuls 5-0 at the Agia Sophia Stadium.",
        "Four of those goals flew past the beleaguered Kazakhstan backline in the opening 40 minutes, where Anastasios Bakasetas, Dimitrios Pelkas, Fotis Ioannidis and Dimitrios Kourbelis killed the game off early doors before Erkin Tapalov's late own goal added insult to injury for the visitors.",
        "The head-to-head column makes for highly pleasant reading for the Greece faithful ahead of Tuesday's match, as the Pirate Ship Crew have avoided defeat in each of their first nine games with Georgia - winning seven of them - including a 2-0 success in Batumi during a 2022 World Cup qualifier."
