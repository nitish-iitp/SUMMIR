        "Lithuania are favoured by the bookmakers for the win, but it could get tight on Friday.",
        "Lithuania scored six times in the last ten outings for an average of 0.6 goals a game. They conceded 17 and managed two clean sheets.",
        "Cyprus travel to their next UEFA Nations League match, averaging a lowly 0.8 goals per game in their last ten matches. They scored a disappointing total of eight goals, while also conceding 17 goals. That amounts to an average of 1.7 per game, in which they kept their opponents from scoring four times."
