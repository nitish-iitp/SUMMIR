        "Silva’s careless wayward pass just inside his own half went straight to Mikautadze, who weighted his through ball for Kvaratskhelia perfectly, and the Napoli star swept home left-footed into the bottom-right corner with just 92 seconds played.",
        "With Luka Lochoshvili winning a penalty following a clumsy – albeit soft – challenge from the somewhat unlucky Silva early in the second half, Mikautadze’s spot-kick couldn’t have been placed better as he slotted it just out of Diogo Costa’s reach in the bottom-right corner."

        "Georgia have qualified for the knockout stages of a major international tournament for the very first time, picking up four points in Group F (W1 D1 L1). They are the first European nation to qualify from the group stage in their first major tournament (World Cup/Euros) since Iceland at Euro 2016.",
        "Cristiano Ronaldo has failed to score in the group stage of a major international tournament for the first time in his career.",
        "This was Portugal’s first competitive defeat since December 2022 (0-1 v Morocco, FIFA World Cup 2022) and manager Roberto Martínez’s first competitive defeat in charge of Portugal, with them winning all of their 12 previous such matches under him."
