Preview: Cyprus vs. Kosovo - prediction, team news, lineups

Cyprus welcome Kosovo to Larnaca in League C Group 2 of the UEFA Nations League on Monday on the back of an impressive win on matchday one.

Another win for the hosts will see them beat their points tally from the last UNL after just two games, while Kosovo need to respond after a humbling defeat in Pristina against Romania.

With plenty of pressure placed on manager Temuri Ketsbaia heading into this window of fixtures, the Cyprus boss silenced his critics with a fine win away in Lithuania on Friday evening.

Many had called for the former striker's head after a woeful Euro 2024 qualifying campaign saw Cyprus lose all eight matches with a goal difference of minus-25, but after facing Spain, Norway, Scotland and Georgia in that section, this Nations League group will provide a clearer picture of where the side is at.

That win in Kaunas was the nation's first on the road since 2019, having lost 14 of their 17 away matches since then, so it could be a real catalyst for better things going forward.

The Cypriots only took five points from their six UNL games in 2022, avoiding the relegation playoff despite finishing bottom of their group, but they are already 60% of the way to matching that tally after just one game this time around.

It is likely to get tougher though with Kosovo up next and Romania to come in October as Cyprus have been handed a very difficult section considering it is a third-tier group.

Form on home soil has been largely positive for Cyprus in this competition, as they have lost only one of their previous five here, but that one defeat came against upcoming opponents Kosovo in 2022.

The two meetings in that year's competition saw Kosovo come out on top on both occasions by a combined score of 7-1, largely thanks to a thumping win in Pristina.

Kosovo have already had their promotion hopes dashed by a bruising 3-0 defeat at home to Romania on matchday one, though, as that group opener had the feel of a decisive match despite coming so early in the section.

It was a poor first competitive fixture for Franco Foda, who arrived earlier this year and an instant response is required if Kosovo want any chance of avoiding a fourth straight appearance in League C.

Friday's defeat was their fourth in five matches, all of which have seen them fail to score, which is peculiar for a side who has more than enough individual quality in attacking areas.

The visitors will come into this clash as favourites, but as a draw against Andorra and two defeats to Belarus in Euro 2024 qualifying showed, Kosovo can be extremely complacent against weaker sides, and that must be avoided here if they want to keep Romania in their sights.

Cyprus are likely to remain unchanged after an excellent away win on matchday one, where they were strong in both attack and defence.

Ioannis Pittas carried his fine club form from AIK in Sweden over to the international stage by scoring the only goal in Kaunas on Friday and is set to start as the main focal point here.

Goalkeeper Joel Mall was one of the standout performers when Servette beat Chelsea in the Conference League two weeks ago, and he played an important role at keeping Lithuania at bay too, and will retain his place between the sticks.

Mergim Vojvoda's late red card in Kosovo's defeat on Friday will see the right-back serve a suspension here, with Florent Hadergjonaj set to deputise for the Torino man.

After a poor performance in attack, Foda could turn to Albion Rrahmani to partner Vedat Muriqi in attack, after the 24-year-old made a big-money move to Sparta Prague late in the summer window.

On the injury front, Mirlind Kryeziu and Bernard Berisha have both had to pull out due to injury, while Elbasan Rashani has been lacking match fitness and was allowed to stay at Elche to settle in after his recent transfer.

Cyprus possible starting lineup:
Mall; Karo, Gogic, Kyprianou; Panagiotou Filiotis, Kastanos, Spoljaric, Artymatas, Ioannou; Tzionis, Pittas

Kosovo possible starting lineup:
Muric; Hadergjonaj, Am. Rrahmani, Aliti, Paqarada; Zhegrova, V. Berisha, Rexhbecaj, Rashica; Muriqi, Al. Rrahmani



We say: Cyprus 1-1 Kosovo

Kosovo have had great difficulty in recent years at performing when being the favourites to win, especially in Euro 2024 qualifying, and they could be in for a frustrating evening against a rejuvenated Cyprus side.

The hosts ended a five-year wait for an away win on Friday, and they have been strong at home in previous editions of the Nations League, so cannot be underestimated here.
