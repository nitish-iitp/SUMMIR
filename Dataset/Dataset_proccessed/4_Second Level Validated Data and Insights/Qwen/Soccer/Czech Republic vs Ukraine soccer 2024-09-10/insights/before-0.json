        "Ivan Hasek's troops were embarrassed 4-1 by Georgia in their opening assignment, while their visitors failed to cling onto a one-goal lead against Albania, losing 2-1.",
        "The neutral crowd can always expect an entertaining affair when the Czechs are involved, though; Tuesday's hosts have both scored and conceded in all eight games under Hasek's wing and are on an 11-match scoring sequence since being shut out by Albania in November 2023.",
        "Ukraine coincidentally rose to League A thanks to a pair of victories over the Czech Republic in the inaugural 2018-19 Nations League, but the spoils were shared when they last locked horns in a 2021 friendly, where Matej Vydra popped up with a 90th-minute equaliser for Tuesday's hosts."

        "The contest took place at Stadion Letna in Prague as war continues to rage in the Ukrainians' homeland.",
        "The Blue and Yellow's current third-placed standing would force them to fight for their League B status in the relegation playoffs, but there is ample time for Rebrov's men to turn the tide and contend for promotion to the top tier, which they briefly competed in during the 2020-21 edition."
