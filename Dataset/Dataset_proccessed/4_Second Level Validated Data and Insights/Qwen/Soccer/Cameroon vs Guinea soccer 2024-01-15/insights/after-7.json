        "Cameroon, meanwhile, should still qualify, but to do anything in this competition, they’ll not only have to play better than that, they’ll have to play different to that.",
        "Like Nigeria, Cameroon will do well to remember that it’s rare the best side in the groups is the side dancing about after the final, but they’ve been absolute nonsense and look like a side that either doesn’t have a plan or has a plan but it’s rubbish."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Midfielder Mohamed Bayo beats Ondoa to give Guinea the lead",
        "Cameroon win a free-kick down the left, the position similar to the one from which N’Koudou just crossed for the goal, but this time it’s cleared easily enough.",
        "There’s a little more purpose about Cameroon now, Magri marauding down the right and crossing, but Sylla slides in to block behind."
