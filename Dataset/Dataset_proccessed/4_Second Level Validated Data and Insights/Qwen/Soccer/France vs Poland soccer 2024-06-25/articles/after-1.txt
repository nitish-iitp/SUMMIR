VAR has its uses

It is easy to bemoan the introduction of VAR but there are times it unequivocally helps reach a correct decision in a relatively short space of time.

Robert Lewandowski was certain his original penalty had been saved as a result of Mike Maignan coming off his line and so it proved. Justice was done and the Poland great tucked the penalty away at the second time of asking.

One only needs to think back to the 2005 Champions League final and realise how lax officials have been over the years about enforcing that particular rule but VAR leaves little room for doubt when it comes to goalkeepers facing penalties.

If only it could be as reliable with regards to everything else.

Dembele must be more consistent

Ousmane Dembele was the man who won the penalty and helped France finally make the breakthrough against Poland.

He deserves credit for that and generally being a nuisance on that right-hand side yet he still lacks the consistency to be one of the game’s true greats.

At times he seems unsure whether to pass or shoot and his decision-making needs to improve. At the age of 27, the winger should be in his prime but there remains the sense that he is not quite the finished article.

He was unplayable at times today and he just needs to ensure he can produce that kind of performance game in, game out for the full 90 minutes.

More urgency needed from France

It is an admirable quality from players and manager not to panic when things aren’t going well.

For almost an hour France played pretty poorly but they continued to pass the ball around and seemed as though they felt sure the breakthrough would come.

Deschamps didn’t rant or rave but rather looked like a man who believed in his side and the football they were playing. The goal almost felt inevitable and France could feel as though they would top the group without reaching anything like top gear.

Unfortunately, one cannot rely on just staying calm and they got what they deserved in the closing stages when Poland drew level. The question now is whether France can raise their game for the sterner tests to come.

Full time between Austria and Netherlands too

It's also full-time in the other Group D match between Austria and the Netherlands.

Austria ended up winning 3-2. That means they top the group, France finish second, and Netherlands have finished third.

Poland were already out.

Poland fans applaud the performance

Poland fans warmly applauding that effort from their side.

Players congratulating each other too.

At least they had something to cheer, and from the greatest player in their nation's history.

French fans aren't happy

Fans aren’t happy, the realisation that they’re going to finish second in the group has seeped through to them.

FULL TIME: France 1-1 Poland

That's it!

A tale of two penalties.

France will finish second in the group and face a tougher knockout draw.

Now France went a penalty!

90+6' France 1-1 Poland

Wow! In the final seconds, Kylian Mbappe goes down in the penalty area, and Didier Deschamps is on the pitch screaming for the decision!

Determined defending

90+5' France 1-1 Poland

So dogged from Poland.

They've been really good today, even though they've had 'nothing to play for' except pride today, after being eliminated following their second game.

The return of Robert Lewandowski has been really crucial to them.

Seconds left only...

Mbappe shot deflected

Getty Images

90+2' France 1-1 Poland

Zielinski kicks a French player from behind, advantage played, Mbappe's shot is deflected straight into Skorupski's grateful arms. Zielinski escapes a yellow.

Haha, then another clear and cynical foul as Swiderski rugby tackles the overlapping Hernandez on the left flank. Free-kick, Griezmann over it... the ball hits Upamecano and goes out.

Poland will take their time.

Five minutes added on

90+1' France 1-1 Poland

We are into the first of five minutes of time added on for stoppages.

France corner, Mbappe runs over to take.

They will not want to finish second in their group.

Dawidowicz booked

89' France 1-1 Poland

A late booking for Poland's Dawidowicz, after he swings an arm at Olivier Giroud.

Time for a late winner?

Mbappe cries out in pain

88' France 1-1 Poland

That looked a sore one.

Kylian Mbappe, still wearing a face mask after his broken nose against Austria, takes a whack in the mush from Lewandowski. Accidental, one assumes.

But it must have jarred his nose. Ow.

Another Skorupski save

Getty Images

87' France 1-1 Poland

Frankowski needlessly gives away a corner, Griezmann flicks it on, it's nudged back to him, he has lots of space and aims to get onto it... but Skorupski sprints out and palms it away in the nick of time.

This game is rocking

87' France 1-1 Poland

It's really heating up out there now.

At one end, Lewandowski nods it narrowly over.

At the other, Bednarek slides in brilliantly to block Giroud's goal-bound effort.

Late subs for France

86' France 1-1 Poland

By the way, Youssouf Fofana is on in midfield for France, replacing Tchouameni.

Randal Kolo Muani replaces Ousmane Dembele, too.

Goal-shy France

85' France 1-1 Poland

Reminder: France have only scored two goals at the tournament so far, an own goal and a penalty. Yeesh.

Brilliant noise from Poland

The Poland fans, who seem to be taking up about two-thirds of the ground, have made an absolutely sensational noise since the penalty was given.

They're going home after this, but maybe that's why: there wasn't much to get giddy about in their previous two games, so make the most of it now.
