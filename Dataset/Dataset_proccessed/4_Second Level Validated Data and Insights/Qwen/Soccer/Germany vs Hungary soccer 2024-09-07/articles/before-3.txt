Germany lineup vs. Hungary: Predicted XI for UEFA Nations League contest

After missing out on home glory at Euro 2024, Germany get their new UEFA Nations League campaign under way on Saturday evening, when they welcome Hungary to Dusseldorf.

Their opening League A Group 3 contest will feature some fresh faces, as several established stars have retired from international duty following Die Nationalelf's quarter-final exit to Spain - including World Cup winners from 2014.

All-time great goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will be succeeded by his deputy Marc-Andre ter Stegen this weekend, while Ilkay Gundogan and Toni Kroos must be replaced in midfield.

With new captain Joshua Kimmich set to play at right-back, according to head coach Julian Nagelsmann, uncapped Angelo Stiller is one of five contenders to feature in a new-look engine room: Aleksandar Pavlovic, Robert Andrich, Pascal Gross and Emre Can being the others.

As Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger has been rested, Nico Schlotterbeck and Jonathan Tah could be partnered in central defence, with Maximilian Mittelstadt joining Kimmich in filling the full-back roles.

Leroy Sane is still troubled by a groin injury so missed out on selection, and in the absence of Thomas Muller - another long-serving squad member that stepped down this summer - Germany's creative burden will fall upon Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala.

Both impressed at the Euros, and they should start in support of Arsenal forward Kai Havertz up front; the latter's fellow London-based striker, Niclas Fullkrug of West Ham United, is likely to make a second-half cameo from the bench.

Germany possible starting lineup: Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Schlotterbeck, Tah, Mittelstadt; Gross, Pavlovic; Musiala, Wirtz, Fuhrich; Havertz
