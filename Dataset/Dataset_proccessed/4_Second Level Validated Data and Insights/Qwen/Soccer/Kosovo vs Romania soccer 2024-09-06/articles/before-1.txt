Romania

Sparkles will be flying when Kosovo and Romania square off against each other at Stadiumi Fadil Vokrri on Friday evening. The two teams faced each other in some very tensed clashes in the past and yet another exciting encounter is on the cards. The likes of Edon Zhegrova (Lille), Milot Rashica (Besiktas), and Vedat Muriqi (Mallorca) are the most notable players in the home team.

The Romanians, on the other hand, were producing fine performances at the EURO 2024, with the team making it to the last 16 of the showpiece tournament in Germany. However, Kosovo are a real force to be reckoned with at home and we predict that they are going to prove their worth on the field. The good news for the away team is that defender Vasile Mogos has overcome the injury he suffered in the EURO 2024 clash with Netherlands.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (ROMANIA):

Romania were one of just four European sides to take part at the first ever World Cup in 1930, and the team have since achieved respectable results on the international stage, albeit failing to challenge for major trophies.

Led by arguably their best ever footballer Gheorghe Hagi, the Tricolorii narrowly missed out on the semi-finals at the 1994 World Cup in the United States, losing to Sweden on penalties. Romania made a total of seven appearances at the World Cup finals, while qualifying for five European Championship tournaments. The Tricolorii went the farthest in 2000, when they were eliminated by Italy in the quarter-finals.

Tied at the top of the goalscoring charts, Gheorghe Hagi and Adrian Mutu are the only two Romanian footballers to have gained worldwide recognition, but Dorinel Munteanu, Dan Petrescu, Gheorghe Popescu and Viorel Moldovan are also worth mention. Romania play their home games at the Arena National in Bucarest.
