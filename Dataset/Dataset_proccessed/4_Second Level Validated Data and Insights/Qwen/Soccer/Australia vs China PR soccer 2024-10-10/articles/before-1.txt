The Subway Socceroos come up against China PR in their third FIFA World Cup 2026 round three qualifying match on Thursday 10 October at Adelaide Oval, a venue where we've enjoyed plenty of success in the past.


As Australia return to the city for the first time since 2017, we take a trip down memory lane and look at our last three fixtures at Adelaide Oval ahead of Thursday night's showdown.

2011: 3-0 win vs New Zealand - International Friendly

A 2011 fixture against New Zealand saw the Socceroos prevail 3-0 in a strong showing at Adelaide Oval. Australia opened the scoring 10 minutes in with Josh Kennedy capitalising on a goalkeeping mistake in what was a dominant first half from the Socceroos. In the 59th minute, Kennedy earned both his and Australia’s second goal of the match, rising highest against the New Zealand defence to header the ball home from a corner. And in stoppage time, the Socceroos made it three, with hometown boy James Troisi converting a penalty won by Robbie Kruse to add his name to the scoresheet in front of a crowd of 21,281.


2016: 7-0 win vs Tajikistan - FIFA World Cup Qualification

The South Australian crowd were given a treat in 2016, as the Socceroos sauntered to a 7-0 win over Tajikistan on the way to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Australia opened the scoring with a clinical strike from Massimo Luongo from outside the box, before captain Mile Jedinak netted a 12th-minute penalty to double the Socceroos’ lead. Mark Milligan then made it three with a second-half penalty of his own, with Nathan Burns then netting shortly after. Tom Rogic bagged a quickfire brace within five minutes of coming on, making it six for the Socceroos, before Burns scored once more to round off a memorable victory for the Green and Gold, delighting the 35,439 fans at Adelaide Oval.  


2017: 3-2 win vs Saudi Arabia - FIFA World Cup Qualification

A thrilling 3-2 win against Saudi Arabia secured an important victory for the Socceroos in our most recent fixture at Adelaide Oval. Tomi Juric opened the scoring in the seventh minute after capitalising on an error from Saudi Arabia’s goalkeeper before Saudi Arabia drew level with a 23rd-minute goal from Salem Aldawsari. Juric then found the net with a clinical header, but Saudi again canceled out the go-ahead goal, with an equaliser from Mohammad Al-Sahlawi just before halftime. But in the 64th minute, Tom Rogic stole the show with a stunner from just outside the box, and this time, Saudi Arabia had no reply, as the Socceroos picked up three crucial points in front of nearly 30,000 fans in the run to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
