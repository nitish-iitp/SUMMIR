        "It was a big night for me … obviously really proud to reach 100 caps … you know what I’m like, I want to score goals and help the team so it was great to be able to do that today … whenever you are doubted it makes you more hungry to prove people wrong … I always back myself to score goals … I am excited for the future … a great performance [by Trent Alexander-Arnold] … he backed up another great performance against Ireland … we know what he can do when he gets into those pockets … 2-0 is a really good performance and we’re not going to complain but we spoke about being ruthless … you have to keep knocking on the door and you’ll get your rewards, and that’s what happened tonight"

        "It’s 68 goals and counting for Harry Kane in an England shirt.",
        "Finland look like they’ve been regressing lately. While it’s partly explained by personnel changes, these days the Eagle-Owls seem lost when attacking. Keskinen might’ve been the most obvious culprit, but at least he was enterprising. The other Finnish attackers seemed to wait for others to make runs that didn’t happen"
