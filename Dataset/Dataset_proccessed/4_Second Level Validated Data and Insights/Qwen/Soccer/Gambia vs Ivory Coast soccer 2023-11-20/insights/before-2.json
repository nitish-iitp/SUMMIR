        "Ivory Coast were simply too strong in their opening match against Seychelles, with Karim Konate and Hamed Traore scoring two goals each, while Sebastian Haller, Jean-Philippe Krasso, Seko Fofana, Ibrahim Sangare and Simon Adingra each contributed one goal in the 9-0 onslaught.",
        "The Elephants are now unbeaten in their last four matches in all competitions, including two wins and two draws, and are strongly fancied not just to win this match but to go on to top the group.",
