        "Canada already look to have taken in more of Marsch’s ideas from just a few more training sessions — plus, the coach himself has demonstrated an ability to identify and correct issues.",
        "There remains plenty of work to do in the 10 days before they take on Argentina to open Copa América (and Marsch did say the players have a couple of days off before they reconvene), but Sunday was a perfect reminder of how high a level this Canada side is capable of reaching."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Maxime Crépeau was switched on all game, maxing four excellent saves on chances that seemed destined for the goal, demonstrating his shot-stopping ability against some of the very best players on the planet.",
        "Stephen Eustáquio was good distributing the ball into dangerous areas with two key passes, while Ismaël Koné was perhaps even better.",
        "The Portland Timbers goalkeeper was outstanding for Canada, likely securing the number one job for the Copa América after this performance."
