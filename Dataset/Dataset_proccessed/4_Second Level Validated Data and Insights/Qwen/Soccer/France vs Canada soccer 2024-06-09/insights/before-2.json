        "Canada’s men’s team have played France just once before: in the group stage of the 1986 World Cup, where Jean-Pierre Papin scored the only goal in a fairly impressive 1-0 loss.",
        "This will be a star-studded match, as not only is it Canada’s final tune-up before Copa América, but it’s also France coach Didier Deschamps’ final chance to evaluate his own team before they play at Euro 2024.",
        "Not least of which is Kylian Mbappé, whose much-anticipated move from Paris Saint-Germain to Real Madrid was finally announced this week.",
        "All but one of France’s players currently play for a team in Europe’s top five leagues, including 10 that just won a title in those leagues — with Real Madrid, PSG or Inter Milan."
