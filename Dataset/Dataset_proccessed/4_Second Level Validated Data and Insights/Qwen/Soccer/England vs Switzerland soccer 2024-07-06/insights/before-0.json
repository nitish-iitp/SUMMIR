        "England faces Switzerland in the quarter-finals of Euro 2024.",
        "Questions from children about England's Euro 2024 campaign include why England can't work together, what players eat at halftime, why Harry Kane keeps trying to be a midfielder, which player has the largest feet, who can do the most keepy-uppies, what will happen if they lose, and how many players have dogs.",
        "If England loses to Switzerland, it will end their campaign in the Euros and possibly the tenure of Gareth Southgate as manager.",
        "Several players in the England squad own dogs, including Conor Gallagher, Jordan Pickford, Eberechi Eze, Harry Kane, Lewis Dunk, Aaron Ramsdale, and Dean Henderson."
