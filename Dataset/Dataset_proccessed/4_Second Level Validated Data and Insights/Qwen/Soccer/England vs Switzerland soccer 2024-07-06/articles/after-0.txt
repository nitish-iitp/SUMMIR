England advances

FINAL: England 1 (5), Switzerland 1 (4)

England is heading back to the semifinals for the second straight UEFA European championship. It took Switzerland in penalty kicks, 5-4, in order to clinch the third ticket into the semifinals at Euro 2024.

Much like its Round of 16 win over Slovenia, England needed to score late in order to keep its hopes alive. After Switzerland went up, 1-0, in the 75th minute, Bukayo Saka scored the equalizer on a strike from outside the box in the 80th minute to help send the match to extra time.

After a scoreless 30 minutes of extra time, the match went to a penalty kick shootout. Jordan Pickford made a stop in the opening round, which was all the Three Lions needed in order to advance.

England will take on the winner of Saturday's Netherlands-Turkey match on Wednesday as it seeks to make the final of the tournament for the second straight time.

Heading to penalty kicks

120': England 1, Switzerland 1

Neither squad was able to break through in extra time, although Switzerland had a pair of close chances to take a 2-1 lead in the final 15 minutes.

But neither went through, so the match went to penalty kicks.

England unable to breakthrough in first half of extra time

105': England 1, Switzerland 1

England had better opportunities in the first half of extra time, but it wasn't able to convert on its good looks.

Declan Rice fired a strike from outside the box in the 95th minute, but Yann Sommer made a diving stop to his left. 

Seven minutes later, Jude Bellingham got a pair of shots off. His first attempt was blocked. As he got the rebound, Bellingham's second shot was grabbed by Somer.

Heading to extra time

90': England 1, Switzerland 1

Following England's equalizer in the 80th minute, both teams remained off the board for the remainder of regulation, sending the match to extra time. This marks the second straight match that England will play in extra time, getting a goal a few minutes into the bonus 30 minutes in its Round of 16 win over Slovenia.

England gets another late equalizer

80': England 1, Switzerland 1

England seemed to wake up right after Switzerland took a 1-0 lead in the 75th minute. After the Swiss controlled the match for much of the second half, England went on the attack after giving up a goal before Bukayo Saka's left-footed strike from the edge of the box bounced into the net.

Switzerland goes up 1-0 in 75th minute

75': Switzerland 1, England 0

There was finally a breakthrough in Saturday's match in the 75th minute. Switzerland was precise with its passing on the attack, allowing Dan Ndoye to get the ball on the side of the box. Ndoye sent a cross that rolled from one side of the net to the other, finding Breel Embolo, who put in the match's first goal.

So close for the Swiss

57': England 0, Switzerland 0

Breel Embolo was active in the early part of the second half. After getting the match's first shot on goal, he received a good cross from Ricardo Rodríguez. Embolo got his head on the ball, but England's defense was able to swarm together and block the attempt.

Switzerland gets first shot on net

51': England 0, Switzerland 0

It took 51 minutes of play, but there was finally a shot on goal in the early minutes of the second half of Saturday's match. It didn't result in a goal though as Breel Embolo didn't get too much lift on his shot. The ball rolled right to England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, allowing him to make the easy save and keep the match scoreless.

No score at half

HALFTIME: England 0, Switzerland 0

Like most of England's other matches in Euro 2024, the first half of its quarterfinal match against Switzerland was also a quiet 45 minutes that featured very few scoring opportunities. Both teams went into the locker room without a goal and a shot on net at halftime.

England appeared to have more opportunities, getting five shot attempts to Switzerland's two. But its struggles to finish in the final third have continued in Saturday's match as it's scored just four goals through 4.5 matches in the tournament. 

Jude Bellingham had a cool highlight though in the 36th minute when he spun around Switzerland's defense.

Other than that, the first 45 minutes didn't feature much excitement.

Another no handball call

34': England 0, Switzerland 0

Another suspicious no handball call at Euro 2024 took place in the first half of Saturday's England-Switzerland match. Kieran Trippier attempted to send a cross into the box for an England opportunity, but Switzerland's Remo Freuler appeared to hit the ball with his right hand on the contest. No handball was assessed though.

No penalty given despite Kane's plea

17': England 0, Switzerland 0

As England tried to set up an opportunity from the edge of the box in the 16th minute, Harry Kane fell over when trying to get a ball that floated in the air. He believed that he was fouled, which would've given England a penalty kick. However, the ref insisted that it was incidental contact that wasn't worthy of being called a foul.

Jul 06, 2024 - 12:18p ET
A quiet opening 15 minutes

15': England 0, Switzerland 0

There weren't many opportunities in the opening 15 minutes of Saturday's match. Neither side recorded a shot on goal. England had the only shot attempt as well, a strike from Declan Rice outside the box that was blocked. Kobbie Mainoo also had a strike from outside the box in the 16th minute that was also blocked by a Switzerland player.

Southgate not happy with narratives surrounding England

Entering the knockout stage, many believed that England drew an easier path to the final than the other favorites at Euro 2024. However, England manager Gareth Southgate disagreed with that sentiment.

"I'd say that's a classic example of entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents," Southgate told reporters ahead of Saturday's match. "We're playing a really strong football nation, who has played exceptionally well, well prepared and have enormous pride."
