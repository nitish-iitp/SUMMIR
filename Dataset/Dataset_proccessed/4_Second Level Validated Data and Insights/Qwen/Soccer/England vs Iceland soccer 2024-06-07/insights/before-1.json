        "Bukayo Saka and John Stones should be fine after precautionary rests, while Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker and Kobbie Mainoo are back from their Champions League and FA Cup final commitments.",
        "With Southgate surely wanting to test out his favoured Euros XI, Stones and Walker should both start in the backline with Jordan Pickford and Kieran Trippier, still operating as a makeshift left-back.",
        "Marc Guehi should once again benefit from Maguire's absence, especially as Lewis Dunk has also picked up an injury and Jarrad Branthwaite has failed to make the Euros selection.",
        "As Trent Alexander-Arnold excelled in his midfield slot against Bosnia, the Liverpool man is in no position to be dropped, so Conor Gallagher should be sacrificed as Declan Rice returns to the engine room.",
        "While Cole Palmer and Eberechi Eze both enjoyed successful Euro 2024 auditions at St James' Park, Foden and Bellingham's returns should see them cut from the ranks for Friday's game, where Saka and Harry Kane - who scored as a substitute on Monday after a back issue - should also form a first-choice offensive quartet."
