    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Southgate’s starting lineup for that opening group game against Serbia seems written in stone, fitness permitting, except for one position — the third midfield spot.",
        "England’s defence was under question before this game even kicked off.",
        "There were worries over balance and experience.",
        "Attack may be their best form of defence, but if they are too gung-ho, their soft underbelly could be exposed, as it was here by Iceland."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "We learned a lot. We know the performance wasn’t good enough.",
        "But, actually, I think it’s a really good focus for us ahead of the tournament.",
        "Tonight hasn’t gone as well as we hoped, but we have to stay very calm."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "England have set a lot of records under Southgate, but this is one to which they would not want to lay claim: going 1-0 down in three consecutive Wembley games for the first time since November 1954.",
        "Kobbie Mainoo combined well with Rice tonight and there seemed to be decent communication between the two.",
        "Marc Guehi was solid, but England were not.",
        "Stones was hurt here when Thorsteinsson fell on his right ankle early on and was visibly discomforted in the moments that followed."
