        "Colombia will look to recover from a shock defeat last week when they host bottom-placed Chile in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying on Tuesday.",
        "Colombia remain in second, though, as Uruguay also lost last week, and the gap to Argentina at the top is only three points.",
        "The gap to the playoff place has shortened to five points, but Colombia will still be heavily fancied to progress after surprisingly missing out on the 2022 finals.",
        "Playing at home has often yielded much better results for the hosts, as Colombia have taken 10 points from a possible 12 in Barranquilla in this campaign.",
        "Chile are a much different team now though, as yet another defeat on Thursday saw them fall into last position in the CONMEBOL standings.",
        "Gareca did oversee one of Chile's worst results in recent memory last month though, becoming the first side to lose an away qualifier against Bolivia in 31 years."
