After the culmination of the 2023 IPL, in the months of July and August, the Indian team will take part in their first away series. Similar to last year, India will tour the West Indies. It will be a long tour, with India playing 2 Test matches, 3 ODIs and 3 T20Is against the Caribbeans. A second string Indian cricket team is most likely to take part in the tour, with the main players resting and preparing for the upcoming Asia cup. BCCI is yet to announce the itinerary for India’s Tour of the West Indies.

Asia Cup ( September, 2023)

In the following month of September, India will be taking part in the 2023 Asia Cup. India, in their first match, will face their arch-rivals, Pakistan. Most likely to be hosted by Pakistan, the Asia Cup will be held in the 50-over format. The tournament will lead to each team playing two matches in the group stages before the qualifying teams move on to the Super Four, where all the four teams will play each other. The ODI matches will act as a brilliant form of preparation for the Asian teams before the ICC Cricket World Cup.

India vs Australia ( September- December, 2023)

Similar to last year, Australia will be touring India just before the World Cup. It will act as great practice for the upcoming 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup which is to be held in India. Both the teams will play 3 ODI matches, a few days before the quadrennial tournament. After the end of the tournament, the Australian team will remain in the Indian shores and continue their tour. India will play five T20I matches against Australia in December and then move on to the next series.

ICC Cricket World Cup ( October- November, 2023)

From 26 October to 26 November, the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup will occur in the subcontinent. A total of ten teams, 7 qualified through the 2020-23 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, 2 from the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and India already qualified due to them being the host nation, will participate in the tournament. The tournament will occur in a round-robin format, with all the teams playing against each other in the group stage. India will go into the World Cup as the favorites with them having the advantage of playing in home conditions. They will try to repeat history and gain the glory they achieved in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.

(December- January, 2023)

At the end of the year, India will tour South Africa for 2 Test, 3 ODI and 3 T20I matches. Beginning in December, the tour will further extend to the first month of 2024.
