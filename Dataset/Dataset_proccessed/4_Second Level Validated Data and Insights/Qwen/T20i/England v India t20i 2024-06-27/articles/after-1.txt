So, England won't have the chance to defend their T20 World Cup title on Saturday.

Instead, it'll be India and South Africa - in their first ever men's final - lining up in Barbados. Two teams unbeaten, it's set to be a cracker.

As usual, we'll have live text coverage, clips and radio commentary for you here on the BBC Sport website from 15:00 BST so make sure you join us.

For now, here's Matthew Henry's report on today's proceedings - and India's winning moment.

Bye for now!

England managed to scratch their way to the semi-finals, then it all came tumbling down. I can only give them a four or five out of 10 for this World Cup.

India captain Rohit Sharma: "It's very satisfying to win this game. We worked really hard as a unit. To win like that was a great effort from everybody.

"I thought we adapted to the conditions. They were really challenging. If we play according to the conditions, things fall into place.

"At one stage we felt 140 or 150 would be competitive. Then we said 25 runs more. I can set a target in my mind, but I don't want to let anyone know, because all of our batters are instinctive players and I want them to play freely.

"I thought 170 was a very good score and the bowlers were fantastic.

"Virat is a quality player. Any player can through that. We understand his class. When you have played for 15 years, form is never a problem. He's probably saving it for the final.

"We've been very calm. We understand the occasion of the final. It's important we stay composed, because that helps you make good decisions. We have been very steady, calm, and that has been the key for us.

"We'll try our best. All I can hope is to put in another good show come the final."

India skipper Rohit Sharma played a huge part in India's win, and has done throughout the campaign.

He was the only player to pass 50 today.

England captain Jos Buttler: "India outplayed us, certainly. We let them maybe get 20/25 too many on a challenging surface that they played well on. They fully deserved to win.

"Two years on, different conditions, it looks very different. India played the game very well.

"With the rain around, we didn't think the conditions would change and they didn't - they just outplayed us and got a very good score. I don't think the toss was the difference between us.

"They've got some fantastic spinners. Our two bowled well but in hindsight, yeah, probably should've bowled Moeen in our innings with the way spin was playing. But with a good score and their brilliant bowling attack it was always going to be a tough chase.

"With everything that's happened in the tournament I'm really proud of the group's efforts. We can only play who's in front of us. We've had a lot of adversity but we have stuck together really well, we played good cricket in patches but unfortunately came up short when we needed it most."

On that pitch it would have been a tricky chase in a Test, let alone a T20.

England went into it with the right attitude. On evidence, you'd question if it was the right decision to win the toss and bowl. England like chasing. It's very difficult to say the game was lost at the toss. India wanting to bat first was a sign they saw something different. It's just how England like to go about their games. We have to give a lot of credit to India.

Player of the match Axar Patel: "I knew that the wicket was stopping and had something for the bowlers. I just tried to bowl in good areas.

"I tried to bowl a little slower and it worked.

"Our batters told us the pitch wasn't easy to hit the ball. We felt it was a good total."

Axar Patel is named player of the match for his 3-23. We'll hear from him shortly.

They were three big wickets, too - Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow.

It was as complete a performance as you can get from India.

They were the favourites in these conditions, it looked very difficult when England were batting, but their spinners were pretty much unplayable.

Three wickets for Kuldeep Yadav, three for Axar Patel, two for the masterful Jasprit Bumrah. Ultimately, England had no answers.

They were bowled out for 103 in pursuit of a challenging 172.

It's a disappointing way for England to leave the tournament, but you can take being beaten by a team as complete as India.

Jofra Archer tries to sweep Jasprit Bumrah, which probably isn't recommended.

He's hit on the back foot and given out. Let's see.

Surely this match would have been incomplete without a comedy of errors. Now all the boxes have been ticked.

Oh, and Jasprit Bumrah still has two overs left.

Reece Topley digs out a yorker and wisely gets off strike from the first ball.
