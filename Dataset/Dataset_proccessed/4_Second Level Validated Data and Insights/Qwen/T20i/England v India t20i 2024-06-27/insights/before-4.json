        "India would hope to turn the tables on defending champions England when they clash in a blockbusting second semi-final of the T20 World Cup in Guyana on Thursday, June 27, 2024.",
        "In the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in 2022, England had thrashed India by 10 wickets at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before going on to win their second T20 World title.",
        "India have struggled in the big knockout games in ICC events in the last decade. Ever since winning the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013, India have time and again faltered in mega-events, very often falling in semis and finals.",
        "Shivam Dube made 28 from 22 balls but he is also yet to justify his place ahead of players like Sanju Samson and Yashasvi Jaiswal, having scored 106 runs in six games at a strike rate of 107.",
        "Among the bowlers, Ravindra Jadeja's form with the ball is a big worry. He has picked up just one wicket so far and hasn't done much with the bat too.",
        "Kuldeep Yadav has been the standout spinner for India in the Super 8s, taking seven wickets in three games at an economy rate of 6.25 and has been crucial in making breakthroughs in the middle overs.",
        "Jasprit Bumrah (11 wickets) and Arshdeep Singh (15 wickets) will need to once again make early inroads against a powerful England batting lineup, filled with a lot of big hitters.",
        "England's openers Jos Buttler and Philip Salt are capable of destroying any bowling attack in the Powerplay. How India's bowlers fare against the dangerous England duo in the early overs could go a long way in deciding the outcome of the contest.",
        "Buttler has slammed 191 in seven matches in this T20 World Cup at a strike rate of 159, while Salt has hit 183 runs at a strike rate of 166.",
        "The Indian spin trio of Kuldeep, Jadeja, and Axar Patel will have their task cut against the trio of Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, and Harry Brook, who like to bat aggressively against spin in the middle overs.",
        "England's most dangerous batter in the death overs is Liam Livingstone, who boasts of a strike rate of 151 in T20 Internationals. If he gets going he could make a big difference in the last few overs, while all-rounder Sam Curran at No. 7 is also quite handy with the bat.",
        "A fit-again Jofra Archer will be a big threat with the ball, he has been in good form in this World Cup with nine wickets at an economy rate of just over seven. Experienced leg-spinner Adil Rashid has kept things tight in the middle with nine wickets at 6.7, while Chris Jordan has bagged seven wickets."
