    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "England win the toss and will bowl!",
        "West Indies revert to their strongest side from the first round",
        "Rovman Powell: 'I think we left 15-20 runs out there as a batting group but we could give a better display as a bowling group too. Yea we're normally very good in the last final overs but credit to the England team, it is just for us to revealuate.'",
        "Jos Buttler: 'I thought it was a really good performance from us, we executed really well with the bat and ball. I thought we bowled really well to restrict such a powerful batting line up, and I thought we were very smart with the bat, Jonny came in with great intent and Salt tucked in behind him for a bit and then … went big. [Something positive I didn’t catch about Archer]…Adil Rashid, we keep saying he’s our most important players, so much variation in taking wickets and restricting runs. I thought today was a really mature senior player innings by Bairstow.'"
