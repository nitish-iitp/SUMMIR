        "India captain Shubman Gill was not impressed with his team's performance on the field and with the bat.",
        "We bowled pretty well, we let ourselves down in the field. We were not up to standard and everyone looked a bit rusty",
        "We spoke about taking time and enjoying our batting but it didn't pan out that way. Halfway through we had lost 5 wickets, would've been best for us if I stayed there till the end, very disappointed with the way I got out and the rest of the match panned out",
        "There was a bit of hope for us but when you're chasing 115 and your no.10 batter is out there, you know something is wrong",
        "India's first defeat in T20Is this year and it came after their WC-winning campaign. Zimbabwe have surely put an end to India's WC party"
