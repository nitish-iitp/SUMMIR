        "Halfway through (the match) we had lost five wickets, and it would've been best for us if I stayed there till the end. I am very disappointed with the way I got out and the rest of the match panned out.",
        "There was a bit of hope for us. But while chasing 115 and your No.10 batter is out there, you know something is wrong.",
        "We spoke about taking time and enjoying our batting but it didn't pan out that way."
