Balbirnie b Shaheen Afridi 0(3)

Lorcan Tucker is the new man in for Ireland. He gets off the mark with a double through an inside edge. Shaheen to Tucker, OUT! Wow, this is some start from Pakistan. Shaheen kept it on the testing line as Tucker edged this one behind the keeper Rizwan. 

Tucker c Rizwan b Shaheen Afridi 2(2)

Harry Tector is at number four. Shaheen to Tector, HUGE APPEAL FOR LBW! The ball swung in late to hit Tector on his back foot. The on-field decision goes to Pakistan which takes a review. The impact was fine but the ball was missing stumps. Finally the first over ended with so much action.
