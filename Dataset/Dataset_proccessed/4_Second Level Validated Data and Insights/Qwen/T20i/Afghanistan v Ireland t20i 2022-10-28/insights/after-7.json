        "Sam: 'Alex confirms we started losing overs at approximately 3.35pm. He adds that the cut-off time is approximately 5.45pm.'",
        "Andy: 'For all those saying play in stadiums with a roof, or not in rainy season. This time of year in most of Australia is relatively dry, however the current weather patterns have led to Sydney thus far this year having twice its average annual rainfall and an all time record amount of rain with 2 months still to come. Most of eastern Australia is like this currently.'",
        "Andy Balbirnie, Ireland Captain: 'Very disappointing. We'd played good cricket and were looking forward to this. Can't do much about the weather. We struggled with the West Indies facing Sri Lanka. We tried to back up the win, unlike before, after the England game and turn up today but couldn't.'",
        "Mohammad Nabi, Afghanistan Captain: 'Most of the players are disappointed, not having played on such a fantastic ground. Rashid and I have played but others haven't but weather is not in our control. So we have to accept it. We look forward to the future games and hope to win. The preparation, coming in, was good. We looked to rectify our mistakes and were looking forward to today but it didn't happen. We made a plan to put runs on the board to allow our spinners to defend it. In the first game, we saw our mistakes and wanted to learn it. We watched Zimbabwe - Pakistan, they played well and fought till the last ball. All teams are trying their best. From last five years, Rashid and I have played Big Bash. We've talked to team-mates about how to play in Australia.'"

        "Abhilash: 'I was ready to prepare popcorn'",
        "Marshal: 'ICC Could have scheduled swimming contest for all the team.. Just a thought...'",
        "Ron Saywack: 'Unfortunately, this match is a washout. Let's hope we can get the second one in, or some part of it.'",
        "Jed Fenwick: 'I feel like a sort of retractable fabric (waterproof) roof is something that stadiums should seriously invest in. This way, if it begins raining, there would be a minimal stop in play before the game could resume, with the roof up. Your thoughts?'",
        "Stephen: 'Is there any permutation where England get knocked out on a boundary countback? (From a black caps fan - still not over it.)'",
        "Kartik: 'Only if we had superheroes that could make rain stop?? Marvel u listening?'"
