        "The Ireland national team sensationally defeated England after the expected defeat by Sri Lanka and retained a real chance of getting into the playoffs.",
        "Afghanistan managed to hold only one confrontation during the current T20 World Cup: Afghanistan lost to England with a handicap of five wickets.",
        "Today, Trott’s guys will have to face far from the easiest opponent – Ireland will be up against the Afghan squad, which, after defeating England, can catch the courage and give out another fantastic duel.",
        "Afghanistan is a higher-level national team, and Nabi and the company certainly have no less motivation than the Irish.",
        "Ireland, of course, surprised with a victory over England, but that’s probably enough surprises: the victory of Afghanistan for 1.68."
