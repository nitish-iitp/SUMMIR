        "The Windies directly qualified for the World Cup as one of the hosts while PNG went unbeaten in qualifying for the event.",
        "The PNG batting will be led by Tony Ura, who has been the backbone of their squad.",
        "Charles Amini, the leg-spinner will be crucial as the main spinner in a side which has generally been very pace-heavy.",
        "Amini could certainly be effective against the Windies with the spin-friendly conditions at the Providence Stadium in Guyana."
