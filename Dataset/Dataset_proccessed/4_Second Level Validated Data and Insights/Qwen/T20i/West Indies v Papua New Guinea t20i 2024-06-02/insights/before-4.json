        "West Indies and New Zealand are the top-ranked teams in Group C, but will face strong resistance from Afghanistan, Uganda and Papua New Guinea.",
        "The surprise inclusion in their squad for the tournament was Shamar Joseph, uncapped in T20Is until featuring against South Africa recently, but clearly a supreme talent in the making as he showed in Australia during the Test series at the start of the year.",
        "West Indies also get a fairly easier start to the tournament with games against the lower-ranked teams in the group, PNG and Uganda."
