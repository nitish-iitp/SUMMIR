        "West Indies captain Rovman Powell: 'Credit to PNG, their plans were simple and they played good cricket. It's important to start well and that's what we did.'",
        "Papua New Guinea captain Assad Vala: 'It was a competitive score but we believe we missed a trick at the end, another 10 or 15 runs would've been nice. From the wickets we lost early on, I was really happy with 136.'",
        "Roland Butcher: 'The lack of preparation has a huge effect. If West Indies were playing a stronger team they'd have lost that game. They've got superstar players but they are not a team, they are just a group of good players.'",
        "Simon Mann: 'Papua New Guinea have had a good day out. They've pushed the hosts and one of the tournament favourites hard.'",
        "Geraint Jones: 'Papua New Guinea can be proud. They should be really happy with that start and they can take a lot of confidence into other games.'"
