Papua New Guinea captain Assad Vala: "It was a competitive score but we believe we missed a trick at the end, another 10 or 15 runs would've been nice. From the wickets we lost early on, I was really happy with 136.

"We are really happy with the way we fought. We got wickets in key moments and I'm really happy with the effort from the bowlers.

"It's an opportunity and a challenge we look forward to. We try to play the best cricket against the best players. The effort was really good and we need to take that effort and energy into the game against Sri Lanka."

On former West Indies player and Papua New Guinea coach Phil Simmons: "He's really calm and he's really helpful with the way he speaks to us in camp."

'We were 60% there'

West Indies captain Rovman Powell: "Credit to PNG, their plans were simple and they played good cricket. It's important to start well and that's what we did.

"We gave them 10-15 runs too much and we will look to tighten up when bowling. They showed intent and played smartly.

"Our team since I became captain we have played together as a group and we have enjoyed it, hopefully we can show that. Roston Chase bowled well and then came in with the innings that we needed.

"We can be better in all three departments. We weren't quite at our best, we were 60% there."

'Always good to start with a win'

West Indies batter Roston Chase: "I'm very pleased. It is always good to start the tournament with a win and I'm glad I was able to do that for the team.

"I knew from the bowling innings it was always hard for new batters. I just gave myself the best chance and backed my skills that once I got in I could get the ball away.

"I have been putting in a lot of hard work so I just backed that. I have the confidence to bring it out in games and it is working out for me.

"PNG are not an A-list team but they deserve to be here and we're not underestimating anyone. We treated them like an India or Australia but we probably lacked a bit of intensity at the start."

'West Indies not a team'

Roland Butcher
Former England batter on BBC Sounds

The lack of preparation has a huge effect. If West Indies were playing a stronger team they'd have lost that game.

They've got superstar players but they are not a team, they are just a group of good players.

Jason: Credit to PNG: stayed in the game, but Windies bat deep. But it's been a competitive game, and that's what we want when the top teams play the associates, as it shows the game is growing.

Papua New Guinea can be proud. They should be really happy with that start and they can take a lot of confidence into other games.

Great shot! Roston Chase gets outside the line and flicks a lovely sort of sweep from middle stump over fine leg. And another four!
