England team had a tough time this summer in the shortest format of the game. They lost two T20 series back to back in July, one against India by 2-1 and the other against South Africa by a similar 2-1 lead. Meanwhile, Pakistan had a phenomenal outing at Asia Cup 2022 recently and ended up as runner-up in the continental championship beating India and Afghanistan in the super four round. Though the recent performance of the two teams could be otherwise, however, England is still counted as dominant over Pakistan if we look at the head-to-head stats. The two teams have faced each other in 15 T20Is and England with 11 victories are leading. Pakistan with only four T20 wins against England in past will look forward to make up for a loss this time.
