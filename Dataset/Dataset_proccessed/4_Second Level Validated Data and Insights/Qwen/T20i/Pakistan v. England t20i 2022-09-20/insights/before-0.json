        "Seventeen long years ago, in the cold of a misty December night, England's cricketers made their way off the field at Rawalpindi after a consolation victory in the fifth and final ODI.",
        "For many years - particularly after the events outside the Gaddafi Stadium in March 2009 - a return to actual cricket on Pakistani soil seemed inconceivable.",
        "England arrive in Pakistan with a debt of gratitude to pay, not to mention an apology hanging in the air. Pakistan's own willingness to travel to England in the Covid-stricken summer of 2020, and to tolerate the huge impositions of that bio-secure summer, effectively kept the ECB solvent during an unprecedented crisis for the sport, and so when last year's goodwill return visit was cancelled with no plausible excuse, the outrage was palpable and justified.",
        "The hosts may still be smarting from their defeat in the recent Asia Cup final against Sri Lanka, but with nine wins in their previous 11 games until the final stages of that competition, Pakistan remain one of the pre-eminent teams in the format.",
        "England's new captain, Jos Buttler, and new coach, Matthew Mott, will be keen to make a statement with the return of Alex Hales, the designated cautionary tale of the Morgan era, a man whose banishment for crimes against team etiquette served to reinforce exactly where the boundaries of that etiquette lay.",
        "About 2000 remaining tickets were selling rapidly as of Monday morning, which means that sell-outs are anticipated for all seven matches."
