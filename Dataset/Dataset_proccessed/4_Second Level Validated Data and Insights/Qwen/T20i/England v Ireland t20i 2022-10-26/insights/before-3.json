        "England wobbled in their opening match against Afghanistan, where they were 65 for 3 in the 11th over chasing just 113 before winning by five wickets, a victory built largely on Sam Curran's brilliant death bowling as he claimed 5 for 10 in 3.4 overs.",
        "Ireland, who successfully navigated the first round for just the second time in their history by knocking West Indies out with a convincing nine-wicket victory, dropped their first Super 12s match by the same margin when they were outplayed by Sri Lanka.",

        "Seamers Mark Wood and Chris Woakes made continued good progress along their respective injury comeback trails to bolster Curran's diamond run.",
        "Ireland opener Paul Stirling looks in decent touch with an unbeaten 66 against West Indies and 34 from 25 balls as his team's second-highest scorer behind Harry Tector's 45 against Sri Lanka, but both will need more against England.",
