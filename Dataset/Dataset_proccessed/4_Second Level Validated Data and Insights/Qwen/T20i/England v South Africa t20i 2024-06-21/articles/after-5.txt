England fall short in T20 World Cup run chase as South Africa hold their nerve

Daniel Gallan

What a brilliant game of cricket. I absolutely loved that. Both teams had it in the bag. Both teams made a mess of it. Both teams dropped sitters in the deep and both teams held on to some of the best catches seen in the tournament.

South Africa remain unbeaten and have one foot in the semi-finals. England can still get there if they beat USA and the West Indies beat South Africa. Net run rate will be a factor of course. And after today’s show, let’s not right anything off.

With that I’ll sign off and thank you all for sticking with me. Thank you to everyone who wrote in. I’m sorry I couldn’t get to them all. If only the game was more pedestrian, but who wants that?

Look out for Ali Martin’s report that should be landing any minute.

Totsiens and hamba kahle.

Now Aiden Markram:

Once again, we’ve had a few of those in this comp. Especially today. You got to the last three overs and it looked like the odds would be heavily against you. But for the bowlers to hang in there and execute against really good players, that shows a lot of skill but that comes from somewhere deeper. That shows a lot of heart and spirit.

The message was [that the pitch was slow]. I thought it was decent to bat in the powerplay. Quinny showed that. But it defintiely got slower. I wanted another 20 runs if I was being greedy. So we knew we had to squeeze in the field. We’re getting closer to that perfect game of cricket. We’re not quite there yet but we’re getting closer.

It was always going to be a challenge. But you just need one or two to have a good day. We have trust that each guy on their day can put in a performance.

[What was going on with those full tosses?] It’s always a tricky one. You want to see the bowler’s best skills. That might be a yorker, you want to give them the freedom to bowl his best ball. It was nerve wracking. The plan was good, execution was the issue. Which happens. YOu have to give Brooky and Liam credit as well.

[And that match winning catch? One of your best?] I’ll take it! I’m grateful that it stuck. Your mind races as a captain and you can drift a bit. I think it made a big difference.

Here’s Jos Buttler:

I’d say [it was lost] in the powerplay. De Kock took it on and we couldn’t match them. We were 20 runs behind. We were happy chasing 160 but they bowled well in the powerplay.

It was still a good wicket. We were happy chasing 160. I thought Brook and Livingstone had a fantastic partnership to take us close and looking like favourites.

[On Livingstone] sometimes you don’t face loads of balls. he’s made peace with that. Once he got over that he’s been hitting the ball sweatly in the nets.

We’re still very much in the competition. We played well but couldn’t quite get over the line.

That’s right. If they batter the USA they could sneak through.

I started this blog asking if there we’d been served too much cricket.

What a fool I was!

Here’s Thomas Walker again:

Another reason this World Cup should be considered a success - so many thrilling matches with close finishes and outstanding individual and team performances, especially from the Associate nations. I’ll always love Test cricket above all else but any cricket is good cricket! Keep it coming!

Amen.

20.07 CEST

Quinton de Kock has been named player of the match. Here’s what he has to say:

We’ve played a couple of games here in certain leagues, and it doesn’t play as nice in the day as it does at night. Night games and day games can be two different surfaces on the same wicket.

My plan was to bat as long as I can and make as many runs as I can [simple, eh?]

I don’t carry confidence [from previous knocks]. I just go game by game. That is what I focus on.

I thought we bowled really well, especially in the powerplay. Otherwise we were pretty solid. To defend [163] on a decent wicket was pretty good.

Share
21 Jun 2024
20.05 CEST

Where was that won? De Kock’s knock for sure – that 65 from the top of the innings was pivotal – but Maharaj’s 2-25, accounting for Bairstow and Buttler, also deserves a mention. Then of course there was Markram’s catch to remove Brook.

21 Jun 2024
20.02 CEST

What a game of cricket! I lost track of the number of times I declared one side a winner before changing my mind and handing victory to the other.

Two outstanding innings from de Kock and Brook, with handy cameos from Miller and Livingstone, cut through shoddy looking scorecards.

It was a game defined by stunning grabs, most notably Markram’s diving, backwards-running catch to dismiss Brook and swing the pendulum for the final time in the final over.

South Africa win by seven runs.

Dot ball! A low full toss and Curran biffs it towards deep midwicket. But he declines the single.

9 off 2. This has to go for Curran. A dot ball will win it for South Africa.

WICKET! Brook c Markram b Nortje 52 (England 150-5)

THAT IS A CAPTAIN’S CATCH! Nortje bowls it full and Brook is early on it. It spoons up and over Markram at mid-off who runs back and dives just as the ball drops over his shoulder and he holds on as he falls to the ground. A sensational catch. Possibly a game winning catch. Archer will be on strike. England need 14 off 5.

Share
21 Jun 2024
19.53 CEST

19th over: England 150-5 (Brook 52, Curran 5) Good running brings Brook on strike for the final over. That was a great set from Jansen who bowled into the sticky surface and conceded just seven runs. That leaves 14 needed off the final over.

Share
21 Jun 2024
19.52 CEST

Oh! The breeze saves Brook. Again, into the surface and Brook tries to hoik a cut for six. Doesn’t catch it. It almost reaches Stubbs on the sweep. 16 off 7.

21 Jun 2024
19.51 CEST

Jansen into the surface, Curran is content to bunt it off the back foot to deep square for a single.

17 off 8.

21 Jun 2024
19.50 CEST

Brook makes room to scoop a boundary over fine leg, but can’t get hold of it. Instead it thuds into his pads. Still, they scamper a single.

18 off 9.

21 Jun 2024
19.49 CEST

Brook gets to 50 by nudging Jansen for a couple wide of long on. That’s off 34.

19 needed off 10.

12 balls left. 21 runs needed. I’m going ball by ball.

Jansen to Brook. Into the surface. Dot ball.

21 Jun 2024
19.48 CEST

18th over: England 143-5 (Brook, 48, Curran 2) Rabada gets a wicket from a full toss but recognises he was lucky to do so. So he smartly brings his length back and as a result only concedes four singles. That should be the strategy. At least, it should have been the strategy. I fear South Africa have blown this.

Apologies. It was Livingstone who just went out, not Brook.

WICKET! Livingstone c Stubbs b Rabada 33 (England 139-4)

Rabada roars in Livingstone’s face! Has that put the game back in South Africa’s hands? It’s another full toss – the Saffas have failed to find their yorker length. BroLivingstoneok flicks his wrists at it and times it well, but not well enough. Stubbs holds on to a tough grab at fine leg. Is that too little too late for the Proteas?

17th over: England 139-4 (Brook 47, Livingstone 33) 4-4-6-2. That’s the sequence from four consecutive full tosses from the usually accurate Baartman. Livingstone has belted his team back on top and now it’s England’s match to lose. Brook also spanks a full toss – the fifth of the over – off the final ball for four. That’s 52 runs from the last three overs. South Africa are making a mess of this. 25 needed off 18.

Share
21 Jun 2024
19.37 CEST

16th over: England 118-4 (Brook 43, Livingstone 16) That’s back to back successful overs from England. This Nortje set costs 13 runs – above the asking rate – and suddenly momentum is swinging towards the bat. It helps when you start the over with consecutive boundaries, which is what Brook did by first charging and bunting the fast bowler down the ground and then powering a drive through the covers.

Share
21 Jun 2024
19.32 CEST

15th over: England 105-4 (Brook 33, Livingston 14) That’s more like it from England. 18 off that Rabada over that started with a crunching pull for six off Livingstone’s bat. Then Brook scythed a cut for four and dinked a paddle to the boundary. Pace on the ball is what these batters want. Run rate is still north of 11 but this brings the teams closer.

14th over: 87-4 (Brook 22, Livingston 7) Jansen back into the attack and he’s looking to cramp Brook. One ball with width is spanked for four behind square on the off side, but elswewhere there are just two singles and three dots. Brook tries to manufacture something with an attempted paddle but can’t make contact.

Share
21 Jun 2024
19.23 CEST

13th over: England 81-4 (Brook 17, Livingstone 6) Maharaj closes out with 2-25 from his four overs, bowling nine dot balls in the process. This over was worth nine runs thanks to a firm sweep for four behind square from Brook. A reverse sweep attempt catches the top edge of Brook’s bat, but it falls safely behind the wicket. The required run rate is up to 12.

John Starbuck has spotted a typo concerning Maharaj, but I’m tempted to leave it as is:

Dan,

Congratulations on coining the word of this contest: maginificient, a combination of magnificent and magic. You’d go far to better that one.

12th over: England 72-4 (Brook 8, Livingstone 6) A boundary – the first since the 5th over – as Livingstone mows a short ball to fine leg, splitting the boundary fielders. Nortje is hammering a good to full length otherwise which restricts the English batters to five singles. One was scampered, as they say, and only a dive from Livingstone prevented him running himself out.

Share
21 Jun 2024
19.17 CEST

There’s a direct hit at the non-striker’s end. Livingstone has set off for a quick single. He’s put the dive in. They review, but he’s safe.

19.15 CEST

11th over: England 63-4 (Brook 5, Livingston 0) Excellent from Baartman who is so hard to get away. I can’t quite figure out why. No great speed. No great variation. Just a tricky area consistently found. One leg-bye, two singles and the wicket of the dangerous Ali. Outstanding. Can England dig themselves out of this?

They say you shouldn’t make any judgements until both teams have batted.

WICKET! Ali c Maharaj b Baartman 9 (England 61-4)

South Africa are doing the business! Shows what I, the commentators and everyone online knows. Not a whole lot it turns out. Maybe this is a tricky wicket after all. Ali goes after Baartman who hits a tempting length, but it holds up in the surface and Ali can only give Maharaj catching practice in the deep.

10th over: England 60-3 (Ali 9, Brook 3) Markram brings himself on and it’s a tidy start. Zippier and flatter than Maharaj but just as effective. Four singles is all that over is worth. Brook not quite set yet and Ali is only going at a run a ball. That require rate is now over 10. 104 needed from 60 balls. There’s batting to come, but it’s a longish tale with Archer at 8.

Phila is right. I don’t think enough people recognise Maharaj’s value.

Kesh Maharaj is head and shoulders the best spinner we’ve seen in SA colours. Smart bowler in a middle of a gunn spell in St Lucia.

9th over: England 56-3 (Ali 7, Brook 1) Maharaj is putting his team in the driver’s seat. The bowl finger spin with flight requires bravery against these England batters but he’s tossing it up and inviting the big shots. Buttler went after it but couldn’t find the middle of his blade. Four singles and a two off the over means it’s just six from the over in a chase that now requires close to 10.

WICKET! Buttler c Klaasen b Maharaj 17 (England 54-3)

Huge wicket! My word, what a moment in this match! Klaasen makes up for his howler earlier and Maharaj has bagged another. Just reward for the spinner. He’s been maginificent. Slower through the air and Buttler goes low to clobber it with the wind on his side. But he catches it high on the bat. Maybe that got big on him. Either way it lifts high and Klaasen catches it with his hands above his head. South Africa beginning to boss it.

21 Jun 2024
18.59 CEST

8th over: England 50-2 (Buttler 16, Ali 3) Oooh, almost a wicket as Ali spoons Nortje over the infield from an odd looking stroke. He’s standing deep in his crease and fetches this away from his wickets. Lucky there. Nortje doesn’t have much variation so he’s looking to bowl full and fast. So far so good. There’s just seven off that over. The required run-rate is starting to creep towards 10 an over.

Everytime Beau Dure has added to an email thread titled ‘Looking ahead for US’ the pendulum swings.

This is their latest offering:

Watching England’s batters this afternoon, I wonder if the USA’s bowlers are contemplating whether to let their fielders take some lawn chairs and get a well-earned rest while England are at bat against them.

18.55 CEST

7th over: England 43-2 (Buttler 12, Ali 0) South Africa are in this. Maharaj coughs up just two singles and bags the wicket of Bairstow. His change in flight, pace and area is a thing to behold. That wicket was procured by luring Bairstow wide and inviting him to generate pace on the cut shot. An underrated master finger spinner at work.

18.53 CEST
WICKET! Bairstow c Nortje b Maharaj 16 (England 43-2)

And another great grab! There might have been two clangers in the deep, but these fellas, on both sides, have pulled off some stunning catches. The latest is from Nortje who dived full stretch at backward point and held on with both hands. Bairstow looked to cut Maharaj but misread the pace and sliced it up. No timing. Brilliant by Maharaj who was camped inside Bairstow’s mind, dragging him wide.

It’s the oldest cliche in the game, Colum Fordham, but it’s there for a reason.

Hi Daniel,

Tuned in a bit late and missed what must have been a stunner by Buttler but caught up with the quite extraordinary catches in Archer’s final over by Harry Brook and Sam Curran and now another pearler from Riza Hendriks. The athleticism on both sides is something to behold.
And catches, so they say, win matches. Will Salt’s early dismissal put the brakes on England’s pursuit? Think not but due caution is needed. Maybe inappropriate advice for the slapdash nature of T20.
Great OBO.

Cheers

6th over: England 41-1 (Buttler 11, Bairstow 15) Baartman, back in the side, bowls like he never left. He is South Africa’s block-hole-finding master and offers nothing for the England batters. Just five off that over including a leg-bye, both batters struggled for timing. Bairstow gets one over the infield but only just and it trickles away for two. That’s England’s lowest powerplay of the year. Dare I say we might have a game on here.

21 Jun 2024
18.45 CEST

5th over: England 36-1 (Buttler 11, Bairstow 11) This is brave from Markram who introduces Maharaj early. Buttler lifts him for four from a swift reverse sweep, but otherwise it’s tidy from the finger spinner, who isn’t afraid to give it a little air. That’s the first time he’s been used in the powerplay this World Cup.

4th over: England 28-1 (Buttler 10, Bairstow 4) England should be two down. Rabada should have his second wicket and Bairstow should be throwing his gloves in the dressing room because Klassen put down a sitter. A lifter to deep third required Klaasen to come off the rope and slide into the catch, but having got both hands to the ball it shouldn’t have spilled out. Otherwise that was a drem over from Rabada who is so good to watch. Just two singles from it.

KLAASEN DROPS A SITTER! My word, that is a howler from a man who doubles up as a keeper. That’s Bairstow and that’s a huge moment down in the deep.

3rd over: England 26-1 (Buttler 3, Bairstow 9) Another good over for England. 10 from it. There’s a no-ball from Jansen’s size 14s which doesn’t help as well as a four from Bairstow’s blade, edging an ugly looking shot from a full toss down to the fine leg boundary.

To be fair to Dean Kinsella, he sent this before the wicket of Salt:

Hey Dan. Nah, I’m not buying it from Miller either. It was less the pitch getting slower and more that England’s bowlers were sending down more slower balls as was required. England defo in the driving seat.

I’d love to see Buttler cap his excellent performances with the gloves and the captaincy with one of his supercharged innings with the bat.

I was a little disappointed by the Sky commentators bigging up of Archer’s bowling and Buttler’s catch which dismissed de Koch and hardly commented on what was a tremendous innings from de Koch. Not many can give Archer that kind of treatment

Share
21 Jun 2024
18.34 CEST

2nd over: England 16-1 (Buttler 2, Bairstow 1) It’s say it’s all square in the chase. Salt biffed Rabada down the ground for four and the Saffa seamer gifted two wides. But a sensational grab from Hendricks at cover – only 20 metres away – to a firmly struck drive has wiped off a key member of Buttler’s team.

18.31 CEST
WICKET! Salt c Hendricks b Rabada 11 (England 15-1)

A blinder in the covers! Hendricks might have been a dud with the bat but that is a screamer. Salt on the drive couldn’t keep it down and Hendricks hurled himself to his left and got both hands to it. Rabada had just bowled two leg-side wides so that will make him feel a lot better about things.

Damian Claker provides a dose of realism, and some classic English caution:

I don’t want to be too grim, but let’s not get too confident. We do have the odd form in this kind of thing.

1st over: England 8-0 (Salt 7, Buttler 1) The innings kicks off with a truly spectacular catch at leg gully by Rabada, but it was off Salt’s thigh pad. No doubt that the third ball met his bat as he clobbered a six from a thunderous pull shot that screamed off his blade. A single apiece means that England’s run chase requiring eight an over is off to the ideal start.
