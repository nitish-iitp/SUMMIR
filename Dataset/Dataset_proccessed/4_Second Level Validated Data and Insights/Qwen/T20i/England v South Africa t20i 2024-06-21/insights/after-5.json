    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "South Africa remain unbeaten and have one foot in the semi-finals.",
        "England can still get there if they beat USA and the West Indies beat South Africa. Net run rate will be a factor of course.",
        "Look out for Ali Martin’s report that should be landing any minute.",
        "Both teams had it in the bag. Both teams made a mess of it. Both teams dropped sitters in the deep and both teams held on to some of the best catches seen in the tournament.",
        "You got to the last three overs and it looked like the odds would be heavily against you. But for the bowlers to hang in there and execute against really good players, that shows a lot of skill but that comes from somewhere deeper. That shows a lot of heart and spirit.",
        "De Kock took it on and we couldn't match them. We were 20 runs behind. We were happy chasing 160 but they bowled well in the powerplay.",
        "We’re still very much in the competition. We played well but couldn’t quite get over the line.",
        "That 65 from the top of the innings was pivotal – but Maharaj’s 2-25, accounting for Bairstow and Buttler, also deserves a mention. Then of course there was Markram’s catch to remove Brook."
