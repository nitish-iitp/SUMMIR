    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Props have to go to Quinton de Kock, who set them up so well, and to Keshav Maharaj, for controlling the mid-section of the innings, to Anrich Nortje for bowling a good final over and to Aiden Markram for a second clutch catch in this tournament",
        "England by no means out of things. They came close and their NRR remains positive. They play USA and a win there should see them through to the semis."
