        "Both teams will be hurting from their early exit in the tournament, with little but pride and game time to be accrued on Thursday",
        "Shashank Kishore",
        "07-Sep-2022",
        "Rohit Sharma and India need a win on Thursday to avoid finishing last in the Super 4s",
        "Surely neither side would've thought this game would decide who finishes last in the Super 4s",
        "The clash will be particularly tough for Afghanistan for obvious reasons. Physically, the heat and humidity would've taken its toll on the players because they will have to turn up fresh less than 18 hours after their potboiler against Pakistan in Sharjah. That isn't all. There's also a matter of trying to lift themselves mentally and emotionally after Wednesday's heartbreak",
        "It shouldn't be lost on anyone that victory by no means is a formality for India. They will still have to turn up and fight for every run, every wicket",
        "Against a world-class spin attack that can challenge the best in the world, this will be another big test",
        "Mujeeb Ur Rahman seemed to have lost a bit of his sting and X-factor due to form and injury concerns, leading to his T20 stocks taking a dip. But solid performances so far in the Asia Cup have helped him return as one of Afghanistan's premier spinners alongside Rashid Khan in their first XI",
        "They could also bring in Dinesh Karthik and Axar Patel for Rishabh Pant Deepak Hooda"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Surfaces are slowly losing sheen, and it's becoming more helpful for the bowlers, especially if they're prepared to dig it in",
        "Only two of the 19 games have been won by the team batting first since January 2020 here. That's quite a damming statistic for the team losing the toss, because captains invariably choose to bowl first",
        "From early 40s, we're down to the late 30s (Celsius) at night"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Bhuvneshwar Kumar has had two poor outings, especially in the death overs. He's been tasked with the tough penultimate overs, both against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. They've costed 19 and 14 respectively. This meant young Arshdeep Singh had six to defend off the final over in both games. Bhuvneshwar will be hoping this slight dip is momentary, for India have the returning Jasprit Bumrah, Harshal Patel, and possibly Deepak Chahar, waiting to have a crack at opponents in Australia. Among them, it's Bhuvneshwar's tussle with Chahar that is like-for-like, given they're both swing bowlers. Bhuvneshwar has the backing of Rohit Sharma and the team management, but there's nothing like a good performance under your belt to make the world better again",
        "In the last 10 T20Is where India batted first, they have won on each of the six occasions where they've made 185 or more. They've failed to defend in three of the four games where they've fallen short of this score",
        "Indian pacers have picked up only three wickets in the powerplay overs in this Asia Cup, averaging 58.66 at an economy rate of 8.06",
