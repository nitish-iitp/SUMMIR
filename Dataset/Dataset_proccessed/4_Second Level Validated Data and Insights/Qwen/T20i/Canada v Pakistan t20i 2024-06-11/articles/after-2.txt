Pakistan captain Babar Azam reacts to Canada win

“It’s good for us – we needed this win,” Babar told the post-match ceremony.

“We started well with the bowling. The first six overs need to be up to the mark, and if you take wickets it’s very difficult to get a big total.

“In the back of the mind we had a thought of a chase of 13 or 14 overs [to significantly improve the net run rate], but on these pitches, the ball is sometimes coming low or at a different pace.

“We are going to change our mindset [against Ireland]. We will try to take our best cricket there [to Lauderhill, Florida]. The conditions are much better there.”

Canada captain Saad Bin Zafar admits disappointment

“It was a bit disappointing we wanted to play a positive brand of cricket,” he told the post-match ceremony.

“The wicket was not very helpful and was tricky early on. The Pakistan bowlers bowled well and we were never able to pick up the pace.

“We needed to pick up some early wickets through to the Pakistan middle order and I think that’s where we lost the game.

“We don’t get to play high calibre teams very often, so that is a positive for us.”

Pakistan’s Mohammad Amir is Player of the Match

“As a bowler you have to adapt to conditions and I hit the right areas and that’s why I got the wickets,” the left-arm seamer told the post-match ceremony after claiming three wickets.

“As a professional you have to be ready for any conditions. My role is very clear at the top and and the end.

“That was a pleasing win and you never know, one more win and who knows.”
