Goodbye from our live coverage of the T20 World Cup 2024!

After almost four weeks of power-packed action, drama and plenty of twists, the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 ends with India crowned world champions.

After reaching the precipice on so many occasions in the last few years, the men in blue finally got the monkey of their back in a thrilling match against first-time finalists South Africa.

The Proteas provided many moments of brilliance, but ultimately they succumbed to the pressure.

Kohli crowns a glittering T20I career with a trophy that has eluded him throughout his career.

Rohit, who won the inaugural 2007 World Cup in South Africa, adds another special chapter in his illustrious career.

Do make sure to tune into our Germany vs Denmark coverage we have up and running.

We hope you enjoyed our coverage of the T20 World Cup 2024, and till the next time, this is Rohan Sharma signing off on behalf of Kevin Hand and Hafsa Adil.

The wait of 17 years comes to an end 🇮🇳
