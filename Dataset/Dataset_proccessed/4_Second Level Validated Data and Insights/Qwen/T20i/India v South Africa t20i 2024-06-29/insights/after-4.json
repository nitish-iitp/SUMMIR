        "Virat Kohli is Player of the Match: 'This was my last t20 World Cup, and this is what we wanted to achieve. One day you feel you can't get a run, then things happen. God is great, and I got the job done for the team on the day it mattered.'",

        "Rohit Sharma: 'Hard to sum up what we've been through in last three-four years. A lot behind the scenes, not what we did today, it's what we did before. A lot of high-pressure games, and we've been on the wrong side of it. Guys understand when the pressure is on what needs to be done, today was perfect example, stuck together with backs to the wall. We wanted this really bad, a lot of mind needs to come together, very proud of the bunch of boys and the management, giving us the liberty to play and that trust. Starts from management, coach, captain, and the players.'",
        "Hardik: 'It's very emotional, something was not clicking, but this was something the whole nation wanted. Special for me after my six months, I haven't spoken a word, things have been unfair, but I knew there'd be a time I could shine. An opportunity like this makes it all the more special. We always believed, stayed calm, let the pressure come to them. Last over, I knew I had to execute my plans. All of a sudden my run-up speed increases. I have been in this situation, I enjoy the pressure situation.'",
        "Axar Patel: 'I'm not thinking this is the final, I just play on the merit. Rohit is an amazing man, led India well... gave everything, and we enjoyed it and did our best. I didn't think about my batting and that works for me.'"
