        "India's coach Rahul Dravid said, 'I don't really believe in this 'Do it for somebody'. I love that quote about somebody asking somebody else, 'Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?' and he says 'I want to climb Mount Everest because it's there'. I want to win this World Cup because it's there. It's not for anyone, it's not for anybody, it's just there to win.'",
        "South Africa captain Aiden Markram said, 'It's a game of cricket. Someone has to win, and someone has to lose ultimately. That's the name of the game. You take it in your stride. You do get belief, though, from winning close games and potentially winning games that you thought you weren't going to win. It does a lot for your changing room and the vibe in the changing room.'",
        "There are no fairytales in life, obviously, but sport does a great deal to make up for it, to the extent that it offers gifts like this Saturday, when, at the end of 40 overs - give or take a Super Over - 11 men will realise the difference between fantasy and reality is that fantasy was never quite as good as this.",
        "For 40 overs - give or take a Super Over - nothing will matter as much as the ball and bat they will be holding in their hands. But after that, whether they win or lose, both India and South Africa should be reminded that they are excellent teams and exceptional people.",
        "Jasprit Bumrah gets to bowl four overs in a T20 game. Depending on allegiance, that is either too much or too few. For a sport that is built around pure spectacle, there can be no better ambassador than a man who detonates the wickets, leaves impact craters on the bat, the pad and even the mind of opposition batters, and does it all with a smile on his face.",
        "Heinrich Klaasen is on similarly good terms with the forces that make simple human beings extraordinary. He shows the ball new places to go to and it takes flight all too willingly."

        "The final will be played on pitch No. 4, which was used for the games between Namibia and Oman, and Scotland and England. It's the fourth pitch of eight on the square, so neither boundary should be significantly longer than the other.",
        "There is a threat of rain over this final but it does have a reserve day."

        "There are those in India who might have felt similarly after November 19, 2023. Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid, for example. Their days are already numbered. The coach is set to depart and the captain may not have a lot of time on his hands as well. But, together, they are responsible for harassing a great team out of its comfort zone and into a place where anything seems possible. All of this - the acceptance that what they were doing in T20 cricket wasn't working and the commitment to keep on this new path despite considerable personal lows - has been in search of silverware."
