ICC Men’s T20 World Cup action will be played between Canada and Ireland on Friday. Watch it live for free on Fubo.

The 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is underway, co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. This is the ninth time this event has been staged. On Friday, Canada takes on Ireland in cricket action. In 2022, Australia hosted this event, with England defeating Pakistan to win the tournament. We’re currently in the group stage of the tournament. Scotland most recently lost to Afghanistan by 55 runs in a warmup for this event. Namibia, on the other hand, most recently defeated Papua New Guinea after previously falling to Australia. This match will be hosted in Kensington Oval Barbados in Bridgetown, Barbados, and should be a fun matchup.

The average first-innings score at this venue in the last 20 matches is 148 runs. The pitch at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium is a balanced one with decent assistance for both batters and bowlers on offer. The team winning the toss may decide to bat or bowl depending on the ground condition.

On Thursday, the U.S. made enormous history by beating Pakistan, a huge favorite and international power in cricket, so be sure tune into the ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup for the rest of the tournament, available to stream live on Fubo.
