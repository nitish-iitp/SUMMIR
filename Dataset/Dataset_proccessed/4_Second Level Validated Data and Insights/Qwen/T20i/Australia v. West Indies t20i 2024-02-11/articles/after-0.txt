Right then, that is it from this absolute run-fest where the Aussies seal the series with a good win while the Windies hope to save some pride by winning the last game. The 3rd and final T20I will be played on 13th February, Tuesday at 1.30 pm (8 am GMT), but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up to the match. Until then, cheers and goodbye!

!

Mitchell Marsh, the victorious skipper of Australia talks about this being a good game of cricket. He says that 220 did not seem enough the previous time and he was glad when they scored 241. Talks about Maxwell being a class apart and someone who has always done for the team. Finishes by saying that they have been playing some really good T20 cricket for the last 6 months.

!

Rovman Powell, the captain of West Indies says that the boys showed good courage and started aggressively, but losing wickets at regular intervals and not getting partnerships in the middle overs cost them. Credits Australia for bowling well and says losing early wickets in a big chase makes it difficult and they will need to discuss about it. Mentions that it is very difficult to bowl to Glenn Maxwell as he has great skills. Tells that they failed to stick to their plans and gave away 20-25 extra runs. Ends by saying that a 2-1 is better than 3-0, and the team is confident of getting the win in the next game.

!

Glenn Maxwell is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his stunning century. He says that at the start he was struggling a bit but then he timed a few well and got back into the game after that. He adds that he is very confident and comfortable in the T20 format and it’s something he enjoys doing the most. Talks about his number 4 position and says that it's a tough position to bat on and he is still figuring it out.

Presentation Time...

!

Spencer Johnson, the local boy is up for a chat. He says that it is nice playing in front of friends and family and in your own backyard as he used to come here with his brothers when he was young. Adds that it is good to take his form from the BBL and although international cricket is different, he enjoys it as it is competitive. Mentions that the extra bounce helped him there and says that Nicholas Pooran is an exceptional batter. Credits Glenn Maxwell for his amazing knock and says that he told everyone before the game that he would get a hundred. Ends by saying that the T20 World Cup is on everyone's mind but his focus now is to do well in the Indian T20 League.

!

Earlier in the game, it was the Glenn Maxwell show. It was his swash-buckling unbeaten hundred that helped Australia to post the highest-ever T20I total at the Adelaide Oval. Jason Holder got a couple of wickets for the West Indies while Alzarri Joseph and Romario Shepherd chipped in with one each. While chasing, the Windies gave it a good go with the skipped leading the charge, but ultimately went down.

!

Australia, on the other hand, had a lot of runs in their bank to defend. Josh Hazlewood and Spencer Johnson gave them the perfect start with a couple of early wickets, but it was Marcus Stoinis who broke the backbone of the Windies with two big wickets in his first over. They kept chipping in with the wickets that kept them ahead in the game at all times. Stoinis ended up with three wickets Hazlewood and Johnson picked up a couple each. Adam Zampa and Jason Behrendorff chipped in with one each to cap off a solid performance.

!

Chasing over 200 is never easy in T20Is, and when you lose four wickets inside the Powerplay, it becomes even more difficult. The Windies batters took the approach of 'Go Big or Go Home' and it resulted in a few nice little cameos from the likes of Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran while Dre Russ smashed 37 off just 16 balls to keep them in the chase. However, they kept losing wickets at regular intervals which did not allow them to take all the momentum. The skipper, Rovman Powell held one end nicely, and once set, he started to take on the bowlers as well. He smashed 63 off just 36 balls, but he was fighting a lone battle as no other batters could support him. Towards the end, there were some bizarre scenes as there was a run-out but it did not count due to no appeal. However, it did not affect the result as the Windies fell short by 34 runs.

!

AUSTRALIA GO 2-0 UP IN THE SERIES! In doing so, they take an unassailable lead, and this was another clinical performance from the Aussies. They were much better in all three departments and in the end, they got over the line quite comfortably. West Indies did give it a good go but it turned out to be a few too many for them. This win was set up by that exceptional hundred by Glenn Maxwell while every Aussie bowlers contributed well to seal the win.
