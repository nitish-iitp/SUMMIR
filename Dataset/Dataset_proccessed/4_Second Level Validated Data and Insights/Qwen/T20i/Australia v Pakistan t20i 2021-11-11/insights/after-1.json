        "It probably hasn't sunk in yet but I'm just happy I could contribute because I was out of the team a couple of years ago and I'm just glad I got an opportunity and repaid the faith",
        "There wasn't a lot of chat before I went out but I'd batted with Marcus in the first game and we got us over the line. Marcus was really confident we'd get them but I was less sure because the rate was getting up there but he reassured me he'd find the boundary enough to take it deep and then I could chip in at the end"
