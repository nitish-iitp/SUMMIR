Right then, it's nearly time for us depart, mainly so the rest of the country can get back to work. Before we go, here are the best bits of the action from England's glorious semi-final victory.

Martin Tooth: That is a sensational performance by England. To hit 170 with 4 overs to spare and no wickets down, against India. Wow. Peaking at the right time again, a la 2019?

Pakistan have really frustrated me in the tournament. They showed what they were capable of yesterday. They showed they could go hard in the powerplay and chase totals down but they've patted their way through the powerplay so far in this tournament.

Their strength is their pace attack and they've got some decent spinners as well. If England lose early wickets that is when Pakistan have to climb in.

But if both sides play like they have in the last two days it should be a belter.

I've just had an email telling me I won £30 on the lottery last night. This really is turning into one of the great days.

There is a reserve day for the final, but that might mean the early hours of Monday morning in the UK.

It would be worrying for the Pakistan bowlers to see that England performance today but they will back themselves.

I love working with a large contingent of Indian colleagues on days like these. Makes conference calls both extremely brief and also entertaining.

England were fantastic. They are setting the bar and the trend for T20 cricket.

They come out and play their shots, not just in international cricket but in domestic cricket too. They are trying to get 60-70 off the first six overs, not just 45.

Australia women are the best sporting team in the world. When you come up against them you think "oh no". England, under Matthew Mott, are working towards that.
