        "Mitchell Marsh on his side's performance: 'Experienced guys really stood up when I needed them' 👊",
        "Adam Zampa: 'We knew the dimensions. There was a massive breeze so it was about getting England hitting to the long boundary where it is more difficult to hit sixes and fours.'",
        "Jos Buttler: 'They came out with a lot of intent and put us under a lot of pressure straightaway. We fought well, but they took wickets at crucial times and played really well.'",
        "Jos Buttler: 'Hindsight gives you lots of decisions you could have changed, it was quite extreme conditions with the short side and the wind.'",
        "Jos Buttler: 'Jofra bowled really well and looked like he hasn’t been away at all, such variety and skill, it’s great to have him back.'"

    "Others": [
        "Will Jacks for the second over of the match will attract scrutiny.",
        "England were looking for a statement performance. Unfortunately not one like this",
        "England paid the price for conceding too many runs (70 in five overs) before they got a read on the pitch.",
        "Lots to ponder for Mott and Buttler. They head to Antigua to play Oman and Namibia and can't afford any slip ups... or for any weather.",
        "Scotland and Australia go into their final group game knowing that a Scotland defeat within a certain margin would see both go through and knock England out. Could be fun"
