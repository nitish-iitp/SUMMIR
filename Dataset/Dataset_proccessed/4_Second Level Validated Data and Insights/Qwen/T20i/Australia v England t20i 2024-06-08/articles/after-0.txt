Righto, that is me done. England’s white ball goose is rotating on the spit. A big week coming up for Messrs Buttler and Mott. All that’s to come. Ali Martin’s report from the Kensington Oval should be drifting along the wires any moment.

I’ll be back to bring you Pakistan v India in NYC tomorrow, should be a belter. Thanks for tuning in and goodbye for now.

Plenty of strong reaction flying about. Buttler and Mott don’t have a great deal of credit in the bank.

Hard to recall a lamer second 10 overs in a big game by an England T20 side. Serious questions now for the management. (In truth, there were serious questions before, but today's game provides a sharper focus.)

— Lawrence Booth (@BoothCricket) June 8, 2024

England under a little bit of pressure now. The decision to bowl Will Jacks for the second over of the match will attract scrutiny. T20 is obsessed with matchups. It’s over-thinking it. Why not bowl Jofra at the start??

— Paul Newman (@Paul_Newman66) June 8, 2024

England were looking for a statement performance. Unfortunately not one like this

Mitch Marsh is, as ever, very chirpy. With good reason after that performance. Australia are quite good in big tournaments. You didn’t hear it here first.

Adam Zampa is player of the match, deservedly so.

We play England a lot and we know their players. We’ve also trained here and know the dimensions. There was a massive breeze so it was about getting England hitting to the long boundary where it is more difficult to hit sixes and fours.

It’s hard to play cross-bat shots against me. Some of the wickets in the Windies you need to sum up on the spot, looking at how Rash (Adil Rashid) bowled as well helped. We have great depth with our bowling attack, playing all different roles.”

Jos Buttler:

"They came out with a lot of intent and put us under a lot of pressure straightaway. We fought well, but they took wickets at crucial times and played really well.

Hindsight gives you lots of decisions you could have changed, it was quite extreme conditions with the short side and the wind. Jofra bowled really well and looked like he hasn’t been away at all, such variety and skill, it’s great to have him back.

Outside the powerplay was always going to be the challenge, credit to Australia - their seamers were very consistent - making us hit to the long side. We came second today, but it’s all laid out for us, what we need to do.”

Butter speaks to Mel Jones at the post match presentation.

He’s actually quite perky and fluent, not the slightly bristling Buttler that greeted the media this week or the sad eyed Jos-y of the low scores seen far too often in last year’s fifty over World Cup.

I’ll rattle off the key quotes in two tics.

Fair to say the OBO mailbag is groaning under quite a few gloomy reactions to that performance.

“Mildly better than tooth extraction without anaesthetic” writes Stephen Cottrell like a man who knows.

“Sam Curran - player of the tournament 18 months ago. Not picked. Bowling a part time spinner against the lefties in the power play. Having Bairstow in the side at the expense of half a dozen better batters. Holding Livingstine back till it’s too late. Dreadful decision making all round…”

Don’t hold back Stephen, tell us how you really feel.

Australia win by 36 runs

A clinical masterclass from Australia, with both bat and ball. England paid the price for conceding too many runs (70 in five overs) before they got a read on the pitch. Even then Australia had enough nous and muscle to keep finding the fence. Buttler and Salt started well in response but the innings fell away in the middle and ended with something of a squib.

Lots to ponder for Mott and Buttler. They head to Antigua to play Oman and Namibia and can’t afford any slip ups… or for any weather.

Very plausible that Scotland and Australia go into their final group game knowing that a Scotland defeat within a certain margin would see both go through and knock England out. Could be fun

19th over: England 152-6 (Brook 10, Jordan 0) England need 50 runs off the final six balls. Which ain’t gonna happen.

Matthew Mott became very angry in India when he was asked to talk about why England’s champion team had played poorly. The reply was that it was nobody back home’s business. I wonder if he’s had any media training since

WICKET! Livingstone c Starc b Cummins 15 (England 152-6)

Cummins gets Livingstone with another slower ball cutter, a slog to the fence is well held by Starc. Australia learnt from England’s errors and have been absolutely clinical.

22.30 CEST

18th over: England 148-5 (Brook 8, Livingstone 13) Zampa to bowl his last. He’s been excellent today and delivered when the game was tightly poised. Just three singles off the first three balls. Livingstone then slams a six over the fence but it is too little too late. Two more follow into the leg side and a single to finish sees Livingstone keep strike.

Zampa finishes with 2-28 off his four overs and gets a few back slaps and bum pats for his efforts.

WICKET! Ali c Warner b Cummins 25 (England 128-5)

Cummins picks up Moeen, a slice out to the off side fence where David Warner takes a good catch straight out of the sun.

The big bright thing in the sky is setting on England in this match unless new man Liam Livingstone and Harry Brook can combine to do something pretty remarkable.

15th over: England 126-4 (Ali 24, Brook 1) Brilliant over from Josh Hazlewood – the wicket of Bairstow and just two runs off it. Harry Brook guilty of trying to hit the ball too hard, dots stitched together and tension ramping. Slipping away for England unless they can find a couple of 20+ overs sharpish.

14th over: England 124-3 (Bairstow 7, Ali 23) Moeen makes up for his dots in the last over with consecutive sixes off Maxwell first two balls. Pressure on the bowler, he manages to respond with just two singles. Last ball incoming – SIX! Moeen sweeps away over the leg-side for a big one. 2o runs off the over, England’s best of the match, they still need to go at 13 an over to the close.

78 needed from 36 balls.

13th over: England 104-3 (Bairstow 6, Ali 4) Australia putting the squeeze on magnificently. Moeen can only find a single off the first three and then Bairstow tries to moose the next two out of the ground but misses with both. Dot to finish. Zampa wins the battle and gets out of the over for the cost of three. England wilting here, 11 runs off the last three overs, five off the last two.

12th over: England 101-3 (Bairstow 4, Ali 3) The left handed Moeen is promoted ahead of the right handed Harry Brook on the batting card, that’s a tactical change with the short boundary in mind. Glenn Maxwell is onto bowl trying to defend the short boundary, he darts them in and only two singles off it. 101 needed from 48 balls. England need a big one, pronto.

Stoinis after a quick drink. Three singles and the pressure starting to build… Jacks goes aerial down the ground but Mitch Starc pulls off a fine catch diving forward! hssssss goes the pressure cooker. Top granb from the athletic Starc.

10th over: England 93-2 (Jacks 9, Bairstow 1) Here’s Jonny. Bairstow bristles out to the middle and narrowly avoids being caught first ball! A mis-timed drive goes in the air through extra-cover but evades the fielder somehow. Ten overs done – England need 109 from 60 balls.

WICKET! Jos Buttler c Cummins b Zampa 42 (England 92-2)

Plenty of chirp out there, Matt Wade behind the stumps the main culprit. Buttler breaks his wrists on a full ball from Zampa and it sails down the ground for SIX. Gone now though! Buttler can’t believe it – he tried a lofted reverse-sweep but didn’t get enough elevation. Pat Cummins taking a simple catch at backward point. Ebb, meet flow.

Adam Zampa to bowl his first – his spell will be crucial to the result in this match… and he’s GOT A WICKET FIRST BALL! Salt goes back and tries to cut but the it spins on and skids through and he’s bowled. Salt looks disbelieving but he’s got to go.

7th over: England 73-0 (Salt 37, Buttler 32) A big moment as Travis Head steps on the boundary sponge a la Trent Boult in that 2019 final. Could’ve/should’ve been the end of Salt but he actually ends up with six more runs to his name. A single sees Buttler come on strike. SIX! He bunts the Starc slower ball over the short boundary and follows up with a booming drive down the ground for four. Nineteen off the over for England.

6th over: England 54-0 (Salt 29, Buttler 21) Buttler clears the infield and finds the fence against the muscular Stoinis. Only a couple more runs off the over though and that’s the powerplay done with. England are up with the rate but can’t afford to have a bad over. Australia had twenty more runs at this stage.

21.27 CEST

5th over: England 48-0 (Salt 28, Buttler 16) England get eight runs off Cummins’ first over, Salt has started more fluently than Buttler and steers away for a well timed boundary. One more over of the power play left for them to get some big runs before things get a bit trickier. All ten wickets in hand still though.

4th over: England 40-0 (Salt 20, Buttler 16) Salt pings Hazlewood for two boundaries off the over, both through point with a flat bat. Big over incoming – Pat Cummins is coming on to bowl.

3rd over: England 31-0 (Salt 16, Buttler 12) That’ll do Phil. Salt hits a mighty 106 metre six onto the roff of the Hall and Griffith Stand. A serious blow that. Held the position as he whipped off the pads impressively. Starc goes to his yorker, a clip off the heel brings a single and a lost radar gifts a wide. Four to Buttler! A whack off the pads into the leg side from Jos and a one bounce four. 13 runs off the over.

Stephen Holiday is tuned in from Oh Canada.

“Sitting in a park in Toronto with my kids. Thanks for all the hard work*. Was thinking back just a few short years and this total wouldn’t have seemed daunting at all. Perhaps even looking at getting to the total with no loss. Now? I’ll let it all play out but I know what I’m thinking…”

Yep the game moves at a frightening pace sometimes and a maddeningly slow one at others.

*And thanks but it is a pleasure. I’m “hardly down t’pit” as my old man might say.

2nd over: England 18-0 (Salt 6, Buttler 11) Good over for England. Buttler skips down and spanks a length ball for four through cover and follows up with a pull for four more. A clip off the pads brings a couple more and two singles make it 12 off the over. Australia hit a lot of sixes, England need to not only find the boundary but clear it too.

21.09 CEST

1st over: England 6-0 (Salt 5, Buttler 0) Mitchell Starc steaming in with the new ball. Here we go. Eeeesht! A searing yorker first up nearly cleans Salt up but he somehow manages to jam the bat down on it in time. What’s more – it squirts away for four runs! A tidy first over from Starc, just a single and a wide off it to make it six off the first over. Josh Hazlewood is going to bowl the next. England need to take one of him or Starc down to give themselves a chance in this game. Easier said than…

They’ve got a steep hill to run up. Ahem.

“Evening from chilly Howarth (yep it’s Wuthering)“

Evening to you Heathcliffe Ian Chadwick.

“Watching from afar this England team don’t look like they gel, don’t look like they get on and don’t really look fit. They appear positively grumpy…”

I’m not sure I agree with any of this but they certainly looked a bit rattled whilst the Aussie’s were peppering the boundaries with gleeful abandon. I think Buttler is feeling the pressure after a poor world cup and some of that is certainly starting to show. Maybe the other players can pick up on it too. A win here might solve it all and they’ll be away. A thumping loss, or a loss of any kind however and they’ll be the ones feeling like they are in the middle of a wuthering of sorts…

England will have to have an excellent power play (like Australia did) to keep themselves in this. Here comes Phil Salt and a no doubt butterfly-stomached Jos Buttler.

Can’t help but think that, again, Reece Topley’s height and variations would have been a handful on this

Australia set England 202 runs to win!

Wade scampers a single off the last ball and is very nearly run out but Jordan broke the stumps with his hand allowing the batter to just ground his foot in time. Not out after plentiful views by the third umpire. England’s first and last overs were good – the 18 in the middle were the problem. They’ll have to go some to haul down this target. Pressure on Buttler’s boys!

England have been penalised for a slow over rate and have to have another fielder inside the ring for the last over. Stoinis picks up four down to long on – Harry Brook again sprawling on the turf but he can’t quite reach the ball in time. 200 will be a big psychological blow for Australia to strike against England. All the pressure will be on them in the run chase. Jordan is nudged for a single and then sends down a leg side wide that does see the 200 up for the Aussies. They’ve been excellent with the bat.
