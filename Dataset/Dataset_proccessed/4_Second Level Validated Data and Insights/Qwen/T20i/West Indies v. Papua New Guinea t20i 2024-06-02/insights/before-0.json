        "The surprise inclusion in their squad for the tournament was Shamar Joseph, uncapped in T20Is until featuring against South Africa recently, but clearly a supreme talent in the making as he showed in Australia during the Test series at the start of the year.",
        "West Indies also get a fairly easier start to the tournament with games against the lower-ranked teams in the group, PNG and Uganda. If they start well, the co-hosts will be favourites to top the group.",
        "Despite their lacklustre performance in the 2022 edition, the Rovman Powell-led side pose a major threat this time around.",
        "West Indies and New Zealand are the top-ranked teams in Group C, but will face strong resistance from Afghanistan, Uganda and Papua New Guinea as they aim to make it through to the second round."
