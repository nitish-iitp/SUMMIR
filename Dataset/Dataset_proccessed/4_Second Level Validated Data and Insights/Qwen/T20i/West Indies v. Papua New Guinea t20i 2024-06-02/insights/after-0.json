        "‘Man of the Match’ Chase, who conceded 26 runs from four overs of off-spin and also held a brilliant catch at backward point to remove PNG captain Assad Vala.",
        "PNG captain Assad Vala in reflecting on the narrow loss: 'We are happy with the fight we showed in trying to defend that total. This is an opportunity for us and we look forward to the challenge to play our best cricket in tournaments and against teams like this.'",
        "West Indies captain Rovman Powell: 'Credit to PNG because they played good cricket and their plans were simple, but at the end it was important for us to get the two points. We need to be better though in all three departments of the game (batting, bowling and fielding). We weren’t quite up to the standard today that we expect of ourselves and we need to improve for the coming matches.'"
