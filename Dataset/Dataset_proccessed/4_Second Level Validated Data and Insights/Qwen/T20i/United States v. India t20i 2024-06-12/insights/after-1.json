        "Indian captain Rohit Sharma won the crucial toss at the New York stadium and chose to bowl first",
        "The outfield is slow. Some shots get a lot of bounce on the field, and some others do not roll on the field. So running between the wickets is important.",
        "Rohit Sharma on New York's pitch: 'The problem with Virat Kohli is that there has been a lot of talk about his strike rate over the last two years, and he completely changed that during this IPL season. His strike rate had reached 150, although others had almost 200, but that is a different topic. He probably must have come to the T20 World Cup with that same mindset, but given the pitches, the old Virat Kohli would have been much better.'",
        "USA captain Aaron Jones said: 'We are going to come hard at India. We want to play every game hard, play fearless cricket and come out on top. We have been training hard and playing good as a team over last couple of weeks. We are looking to do the same tomorrow'",
