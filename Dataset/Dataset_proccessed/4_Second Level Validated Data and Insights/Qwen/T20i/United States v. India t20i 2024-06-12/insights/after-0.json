    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Aaron Jones: “I would say we were 10-15 runs short, if we got 125, 130 it would be a tough total. I think the boys were pretty disciplined, it was really pleasing to me to take the boys so close.”",
        "Rohit Sharma: “We knew it was going to be a tough task, we lost some wickets early. Lot of these guys [USA team] we played cricket together and I’m very happy to see their progress in cricket, they’re going from strength to strength and I wish nothing but the best for them. We know that the bowlers have to take the lead but they all did the job, particularly Arsheep. It is a big relief to be into the Super Eights, playing cricket here wasn’t easy, could have been anyone’s game – luckily for us we managed to pull through in all three games.”"
