India vs United States Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: Suryakumar Yadav’s gritty half century and his partnership with Shivam Dube guided India to a hard-fought 7-wicket win against the USA as stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma flopped again, scoring 0 and 3 respectively. USA got penalized 5 runs due to slow over rate which made things a little easier for India who waltzed to the Super 8s wit this win.

Meanwhile, Kohli departed for a golden duck as Saurabh Netravalkar struck early with India going one down in just the first over. Netravalkar would strike again in his second over, this time sending back skipper Rohit as India were left reeling at 10/2. Rishabh Pant would compound India’s worries when he also got cleaned up by Ali Khan.

Arshdeep Singh starred with 4 wickets as India restricted Canada to 110/8 in their T20 World Cup encounter. Nitish Kumar top-scored for the USA with 27 while Hardik Pandya chipped in with 2 scalps. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl first against Aaron Jones’ United States in T20 World Cup 2024 at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on Wednesday.

Indian skipper Rohit Sharma speaks

Knew it would be tough. Credit to us for the way we held our nerve and got that partnership. Credit to Surya and Dube for showing the maturity and taking us through. (On the Indian American cricketers) Lot of these guys have played cricket together, very happy to see their progress. Saw them last year in MLC as well, they are all hard-working guys. (On the bowlers) We knew bowlers had to take the lead, run scoring was difficult. All the bowlers did the job, particularly Arshdeep. You want options and we should be able to use them as and when we can. Today, the pitch favoured the seamers so wanted to use him. It is a big relief, playing cricket here wasn't easy. We had to stick through till the end in all 3 games. Will take a lot of confidence from these wins. He showed he has a different game to him, that's what you expect from experienced players. Credit to the way he stuck through today to take the game deep and win it for us.

Aaron Jones, USA skipper, speaks

10-15 runs short. If we got 130 then it would have been a tough total, that's how it goes sometimes. The boys were very discplined, really proud of the bowling unit. Feels good, this is what we wanted for USA cricket, enjoying it. We will recaliberate now, have a few meetings and come back strong. The wicket was a bit tricky, more suited for seam bowling. That's why no spin. Mostly he should be fit for the last game, just got a slight niggle.

23:49 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Arshdeep Singh speaks

Very very happy with the performance. In the last two games, I gave away little more runs, wasn't happy with that. The team always shows belief in me and keep backing me, I had to deliver for them. The wicket is very conducive to fast bowlers and it's helping us get some seam movement. The plan was simple, pitch it in the wicket and let the ball do the talking. Don't give easy balls to score, our batsmen are also facing difficulties to score runs. The plan was to hit the hard lengths. In conditions like this, you can use the wicket more. When you are playing international cricket, you need to have some routines and the way you take care of your body counts. All the bowlers have done extremely well, looking forward to do the same in the next leg as well.

12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: A familiar folly

Vinayakk Mohanarangan: In the minutes before Virat Kohli took strike for the first time, Ricky Ponting was running an analysis piece on air. He spoke about how Kohli gets into a great position to balls that are aligned with middle and leg stumps, has superb balance with his feet, then brings his wrist into play. He then pointed out the struggles typically come with deliveries outside offstump, pointing out his dismissals against Ireland and Pakistan. As Ponting often tends to during commentary, he saw a dismissal coming before it happened. Saurabh Netravalkar angled one across Kohli, the Indian star just left his bat dangling and the outside edge was safely pouched by the wicketkeeper. Just like that, Kohli's start to the tournament went from bad to worse. Out for 1 against Ireland, 4 against Pakistan and a first-ball duck against USA. There was a school of thought that these bowling-friendly, low-scoring pitches might make Kohli even more valuable for India but it hasn't quite panned out for him that way. He, maybe more than anyone in this Indian lineup, might be the most eager for the change of venues.

22:07 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: India 10/2 after 2.2 overs

Netravalkar continues and Rohit pushes the first ball towards the fielder in the circle but takes no run. nd he's gone the next ball!!! Chips it up in the aiiirrr and it's taken by Harmeet Singh. Dear god!! What's going on!!

20:52 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Test-class bowling

Tushar Bhaduri: It seemed more like the first morning of a Lord's Test. Arshdeep Singh had got India off to a dream start, but the quality of the bowling to follow too was something to savour. Jasprit Bumrah did his usual stuff, having the ball on a string while Mohammed Siraj got the ball past the outside edge and the almost shaving off-stump. The Nassau County pitch has been a landmine for batsmen, but the trouble the USA batsmen found themselves in on Wednesday had a lot to with the level of bowling they were facing. The scoring rate was a dawdle and it didn't matter whether it was a Powerplay or not. The Indian attack has not allowed any opposition to get out of hand so far, and this was no different. The peach that Bumrah propelled at left-hander Aaron Jones from round the wicket, which angled in at pace and straigtened just enough to best the outside edge, gathering pace and bounce as it went along, wasn't anything these plucky but part-time cricketers have been used to facing.

20:50 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10 overs United States 42/3

Spin introduced for the first time in this match as Axar comes in. Yields just a single from the first two deliveries. Umpires are replacing the bails now so there's a pause in play. Just 5 runs from the over, all singles.

20:46 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 9 overs United States 37/3

Shivam Dube introduced in the attack for the first time this tournament and Nitish Kumar gets an edge but no slips there as the ball races to the boundary. Steven Taylor now picks him up for a six after trying to get off the mark for a while. 11 runs from this one.

20:38 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7.2 overs United States 25/3

Hardik Pandya continues and he strikes!! His wicket-taking purple patch continues in this World Cup. Aaron Jones tries to go after the short ball, gets completely cramped and Siraj takes an easy catch!!

Aaron Jones c Siraj b Hardik Pandya 11(22)

20:35 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7 overs United States 25/2

Bumrah in to bowl the next and Steven Taylor almost chopped the second delivry on to his stumps but survives. Takes a quick single next as India miss a chance for a run out. Huge bounce next as the ball sails over Rishabh Pant to get 5 wides!! 7 from this over

20:31 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 6 overs United States 18/2

On to the last over inside the powerplay and Hardik will bowl this one. Yields just 1 from the first 3 balls as USA stuggle to really let the shackles loose. Ends the over with a short ball. Just 1 from it. 

20:27 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 5.2 overs United States 17/2

Jasprit Bumrah has come into attack and it has been business as usual for the Indian star bowler. He has hit hard lengths and made USA batters uncomfortable. Also, it is a bit surprising for Rohit to not use Arshdeep for the third over despite getting a swing early on in the innings. 

20:22 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Left-arm magic

Sandip G: Left-arm seamer. Over the wicket. Tailing the ball back into the right-hander. Late, really late. It’s the favourite tale that connects the finest left-handed exponents of the cricket ball. Wasim Akram; Zaheer Khan; Chaminda Vaas; Trent Boult; Shaheen Afridi; Mitchell Starc. Add to the list Arshdeep Singh too. His first-ball wicket of Shayan Jahangir was designed in the left-arm seamer’s heaven. It swirled away in the air, luring Jahangir’s eyes into a false trajectory, then changed its direction mid-air, landed on off and middle to ping his statuesque front-pad. From the moment it hit the pad, as adjacent as it could be, Arshdeep knew the umpire wouldn’t hesitate twice before lifting his index finger skyward. He barely turned back, but ran towards the already celebrating teammates. He turned his gaze backwards for a fleeting second. Just in case. The umpire was waiting for that, and he immediately raised his finger. At that moment, Arshdeep drew an imaginary line connecting him and the left-arm seaming-bowling royalty. A glorious inheritance.

20:18 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 3.1 overs United States 8/2

This is a good start for India. Arshdeep has been not only getting seam moment off the surface he is also getting swing in the air which is making things doubly difficult for the batters. This might be his role in the tournament come in with the new ball look for swing and get the early breakthrough. 

20:13 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 2 overs United States 7/2

Mohammed Siraj has taken the second over for India and he has hit hard lengths first up which has made it difficult for batters to time as expected on this wicket. Jones and Taylor who are in the middle need to absorb the pressure in the Powerplay against quality seam attack.

20:09 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 1.1 overs United States 4/2

Arshdeep Singh took the opening over for India and there was a seam moment on offer. First up it was Jahangir who came in as a replacement for Monank Patel failed to read the incoming delivery and was given LBW then Gous tried to pull the ball and got high on the bat for Suryakumar at mid-off to take a simple catch.

19:59 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Let's go!

National anthems are done. It is a bright and beautiful day in New York there are some cracks on the pitch that are not completely open but are visible with an early start except for some moisture. American openers have a job in their hand.

19:49 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Pitch report

Another glorious day with hardly any cloud in the sky. We're playing on the same wicket as yesterday, the square boundaries are at 70m and 66m while the straight hit is at 72m. Pretty similar. bowlers will have to hit the hard lengths, batters can't really play the cross-batted shots. The bowlers will look to get the natural variation off a hard length and a back of the length. Chasing is the best way to go, reckon Ebony-Rainford Brent and Steve Smith

IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Aaron Jones at toss

We would have bowled first as well, there's some help for the bowlers early. He's having a niggle and should be back quickly. It should be a good game and we're looking to play well. The camp is very positive, just looking to play some good cricket. Shayan Jahangir replaces Monank and Shadley is in for Nosthush.

19:36 (IST)

IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma at toss

We will bowl first. It has played better in the last two games, but you need to assess the conditions quickly and then let the game take over. It's all about constantly getting better and keeping the momentum going. It's important to do the right things. That was a great game to play, we didn't have enough runs on the board, but the bowlers came to the party and won the game for us. We're playing the same team

IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: USA to maintain guard

With a morale-boosting Super Over win over Pakistan, Monank Patel’s side is unlikely to tinker the XI too much for the upcoming contest.

19:15 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Jadeja under the scaner

Ravindra Jadeja’s depleting presence with the bat in limited-overs was exemplified further on Sunday when he fell for a duck. Jadeja has not borne the same strength with the ball either. It is then when Rohit turned to Axar Patel to bowl a vital 16th over against Pakistan. The two left-arm spinners have kept an in-form Kuldeep Yadav out with their batting abilities. However, with Jadeja misfiring in both departments, India will be tempted to bring in Kuldeep and take a call on the composition once the caravan moves to the Caribbean.

19:10 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: The Dube question

Shivam Dube’s T20 World Cup campaign has gone from bad to worse in just two outings. Ever since his T20 World Cup berth was confirmed, Dube’s big-hitting prowess waned in the IPL and three outings including the warm-up in New York. Skipper Rohit Sharma has also not turned to Dube with the ball and the tall Mumbaikar also dropped crucial catch against Pakistan on Sunday. With his presence in the side being almost negligible on bouncy tracks, India could bring in Sanju Samson as Dube’s replacement for the USA fixture.

19:04 (IST)
12 JUN 2024
IND vs USA Live Score, T20 World Cup: Batting depth issue

The main concern about getting Kuldeep for Jadeja is that India would be a bit short on the batting depth. But of late, though not equal to Jadeja, Kuldeep has been showing his capabilities as a batsman as well. But the main point is this: with the conditions expected to get slower in the Caribbean where the Super 8s will take place, India need a way to accommodate Kuldeep as dropping one of the three pacers comes with its own risk, particularly if one has an off day. And if it’s Bumrah who has that rare off day, without Kuldeep, India won’t have a proper strike bowler who can create something out of nothing.

India vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Axar's flexibility

Axar, has picked 34 wickets in the powerplay at an economy of 7.44. And just like his batting, Axar is flexible with the ball as well. Right through his IPL career and international as well, Jadeja mostly bowls in the middle-overs (7-16), which means unless Rohit has limited options to shuffle his bowlers in this phase. In conditions where defending scores seem to be the key, every over will count, especially when Rohit’s love for match-ups.

India vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Mike Hussey on Jadeja

CSK’s batting coach Mike Hussey had spoken about Jadeja during the IPL. “One of his strengths is being able to work the balls into the gaps, use his pace running between the wickets and picking the right times and the right bowlers to attack. In the last few years he’s come in very late, batting with MS [Dhoni] towards the back end. And this year we’ve asked him a few times to come in at the No. 4 position. It’s a very different role and sometimes according to the situation, you need to just be free and go quite quickly. But other times you’ve lost a couple of wickets in the powerplay, you need to take a little bit of time to build the next partnership,” Hussey had said.

India vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Where does India exactly stand?

But India will have to peer ahead into the tournament now and find their best XI. Going by the conditions they have faced so far in New York, it is hard to make out where India stand exactly. They have had two wins out of two and a victory against the US on Wednesday will confirm their berth in the Super 8s. Kuldeep would be the best bet to seal that much-needed win against US, whose batsmen wouldn’t have faced the likes of the chinaman of this quality.

In a team that is already short on firepower and has made compromises to fit Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli at the top, the middle and lower-order are India’s lifelines with the bat. And here is where Jadeja’s limitations as a T20 batsman loads things against him. Apart from having a limited range, Jadeja isn’t the power-hitter that a team would slot in the lower-order. He is more of a pace-hitter, but in these conditions where the fast bowlers take the pace off to make full use of the two-paced nature of pitches, Jadeja has shown signs of struggle in the past.

India vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Are India prepared to drop Ravindra Jadeja and play Kuldeep Yadav?

If India wish to play their best spinner in the squad in Kuldeep Yadav at some stage in the T20 world cup, they will have to make a difficult choice of dropping Ravindra Jadeja. Axar Patel’s stocks are flying high, as evidenced by his promotion to No.4 against Pakistan and his bowling figures are better than Jadeja’s in T20. There is no doubt that Kuldeep is the better strike bowler than Jadeja.

The difficulty quotient rises as neither India nor Chennai Super Kings have ever benched Jadeja when he was in the T20 squad. He has been that valuable to them. But if India need more wicket-taking options once the caravan shifts to West Indies later, then they will have to blood Kuldeep – and the tricky game against the hosts USA, who beat Pakistan earlier, gives them a chance to try out Kuldeep. But such has been his spirited efforts whenever his spot has been under pressure in the past that if he is given a chance against the US, Jadeja might well sparkle and cackle at the critics.

How the ‘problem-solver’ Jasprit Bumrah thought out Babar Azam and took out Rizwan

India's Jasprit Bumrah celebrates the dismissal of Pakistan's captain Babar Azam during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in Westbury, New York, Sunday, June 9, 2024. (AP/PTI)

Five years ago while watching Jasprit Bumrah wreak havoc in the Caribbean, the West Indian pace legend Curtly Ambrose was moved enough to purr on the most admirable facet of the Indian’s craft. “The way he out-thinks the batsmen, outclasses them,” before adding, “he could have been one of us, he’s so complete a bowler that he could have played in any era.”

Five years later, after thrusting the knife into the Pakistanis and turning a T20 World game in a New York minute, Bumrah would echo that singular bowling character trait of his: “I try to solve the problem that is there in front of me. I know its cliched answer but I was trying to focus on what is the best options over here on a wicket like this … I am not looking at whether I am bowling at the best of my ability.” (Read more from Sriram Veera)
