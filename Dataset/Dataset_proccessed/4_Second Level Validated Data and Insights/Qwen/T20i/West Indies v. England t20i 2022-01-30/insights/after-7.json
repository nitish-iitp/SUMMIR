        "FOUR IN FOUR! It just gets better for the Bajans in the house... Neither Holder nor his team-mates realised initially, as Mahmood got a thick inside edge that seemed to have gone for an inconsequential four. But Pooran spotted the leg bail had been dislodged, the ball clipping leg stump on its way, and West Indies have sealed the spoils in style",
        "Hat-trick for Holder! Heaved into the Bridgetown skies and taken again at deep square leg! England just keep on swinging, but they are out on their feet. First T20I hat-trick for West Indies, and it's Jason Holder in front of his home crowd to close out the game and the series",
        "Holes out to deep midwicket, and that is surely the game and the series! Wide line, 125kph, not quite a yorker but Billings had to try and fetch it. Got a decent chunk but not enough, and Walsh Jnr settled underneath the ball again"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It's wonderful. Every single one in that dressing room, we rallied together. Every time we won a game there was something against us but we came out and rallied. [Criticism?] Empty vessels make the most noise. The guys have worked tirelessly after coming from Jamaica, and we've bounced back pretty well. We understand what we want to do as a team, and we saw the results tonight. [Slowdown in middle overs] This was virtually a final, when you bat first and put runs on the board, you get 10-15 runs, too, because of the pressure as well. We know in the last four overs we can capitalise. Powell came in and gave us that impetus. Akeal [Hosein] getting that early wicket... Brandon [King] had a great series at the top of the order, Jason Holder getting wickets, Odean Smith coming in after everything that has been said. I thought it was a total team effort.",
        "Quatrick for Holder!",
        "There is something about 4 in 4 to win tournaments for WI against Eng. 4 sixes, now 4 wickets.",
        "Now that was a collapse of English proportions ",
        "Glorious scenes at Kensington Oval, West Indies parading around the boundary for their fans. They clinched the game by a 17-run margin, taking the series 3-2 - and with Jason Holder's four-in-four icing both England and the cake. Only the fourth time in men's T20Is that a bowler has taken four in four balls, a fine way for Holder to finish a series in which he was the leading wicket-taker by a street. He started with a career-best on his home ground, and ends it with another. West Indies came in with storm clouds hovering, following their ODI defeat to Ireland, but seem to have plenty of talent to work with ahead of this year's T20 World Cup. England, well, they talked about squad development in the build-up, and will have got plenty out of the experience - albeit that they might feel this was a winnable match that snuck away from them"

        "8pm: Rally! We've seen some cracking stuff over the last nine days, which served up the most sixes in a bilateral T20I series. West Indies have hit the ground running with their reboot, while England have things to ponder on the road to the World Cup in Australia later this year. Miller's report is in, and we'll be back for more with the Test series in March. Thanks for tuning in, ta ra for now. Bye!"
