    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Captain Kieron Pollard said, 'I thought we were in with a chance and even the way we started with the bat, I thought we had a very, very good chance. We sort of slowed up in the middle, not losing wickets, but we were a bit slow but these things happen. We were actually looking to eye up a 160, 170, a total that would’ve been chaseable, but they getting to 190-odd just put that extra 20 runs out of our reach.'"
