Though his knock of 30 runs went in vain and his team lost the Asia Cup match against India on August 31, 2022, it was a memorable evening for Hong Kong batter Kinchit Shah.

Kinchit Shah, who usually handles the family diamond business, sparkled in a losing cause against India, studding an innings of 30 with two fours and a six in the T20 Asia Cup.
