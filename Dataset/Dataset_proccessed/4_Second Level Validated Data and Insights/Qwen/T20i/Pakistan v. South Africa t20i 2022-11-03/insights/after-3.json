        "The first two matches were close losses, but we've given 100 per cent in the last two matches and you never know, Babar Azam, Pakistan’s captain",
        "I’m very happy the way the team performed",
        "There are a lot of questions we need to ask ourselves, then find the solutions going forward.",
        "It was disappointing with our batting and fielding, getting them five down then allowing them to get to that formidable score",

        "Rain delayed the game after that over, with the Proteas far behind the Duckworth Lewis Stern par score",
        "South Africa, who were missing David Miller because of a back injury, still have their fate in their own hands, with their final match coming against last-placed Netherlands",
        "It remains to be seen whether they turned up to the competition two matches too late",
        "If they are to make it through, they will need South Africa to slip up against the Netherlands, or India to do similar against Zimbabwe, then keep up their own end of the bargain by beating Bangladesh on Sunday"
