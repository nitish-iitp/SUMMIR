Defending champions Australia have been comprehensively beaten by New Zealand at the SCG in their opening game of the T20 World Cup.

New Zealand had not beaten Australia in Australia in any format of the game since 2011, but were always ahead in this contest and were well worth their 89-run victory.

Finn Allen set the tone by smashing his second and third balls off Mitch Starc for four and six on his way to a 16-ball 42 in a masterful display of fearless batting.

Devon Conway was the star of the New Zealand innings though, carrying his bat for a 58-ball-92  as the Black Caps made 3-200 after being sent in by Aaron Finch.

Australia never got going in their chase, with just Glenn Maxwell (28) and Pat Cummins (21) passing 20 as the hosts were bowled out for 111 in the 18th over.

It was New Zealand's biggest ever T20 victory over Australia.

"They played brilliantly," Maxwell told ABC Sport after the match.

"They got too many runs and we weren't able to get partnerships, all the way through the innings we kept losing wickets.

"It was basically how not to play a T20."

Allen's ambitious strokeplay put Australia on the back foot from the outset, as the pace trio of Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Cummins were blasted around the SCG in a frantic first three overs.

But even once Allen fell, bowled by Hazlewood, and Conway was joined by the more circumspect Kane Williamson, runs continued to tick over at an alarmingly comfortable pace. The Australians were unable to dry up singles or protect boundaries as Conway passed 50.

Williamson was eventually trapped LBW by Adam Zampa, before a brief Glenn Phillips cameo was ended by Hazlewood.

That brought Jimmy Neesham to the crease for one final onslaught, as he and Conway took the total to 200 with a six from the final ball of the innings.

The Aussies' chase never got started. David Warner was bowled after a delivery deflected off his glove, thigh and bat before miraculously deflecting onto the stumps in an ominous omen of what was to come.

Finch and Mitch Marsh both smacked boundaries but fell shortly after, before Phillips provided the highlight of the evening with his stunning outfield catch to dismiss Marcus Stoinis.

From there, the die was cast and despite some creative hitting from Maxwell and late-order swinging from Cummins, the Australians never threatened a competitive game.

Tim Southee finished with figures of 3-6 and Mitch Santner 3-31 from four overs as the Black Caps romped to victory.

"There's been obviously worse nights," Santner told ABC Sport.

"It's obviously a tough place to win, we've found that over the years so, it was nice to fire some shots early tonight.

"It's obviously a long tournament, any team in this pool can upset anyone."

Australia next face Sri Lanka in Perth on Tuesday, needing a near-perfect run from here on out to stand any chance of qualifying for the semi-finals.

That's it from the SCG!

A night to remember for New Zealand, who won't be getting ahead of themselves and will have much loftier ambitions at this tournament.

As for Australia? Back to square one. They are back in action on Tuesday against Sri Lanka, which gives them only a couple of days (and a long trek to Perth) to sort some things out.

We'll see you on Tuesday, but for now it's goodnight and thanks for your company.

Captain Aaron Finch speaks about that loss

By Dean Bilton

(Getty Images: Mark Metcalfe)

Like all the Aussies, he seems a little shellshocked:

"They got the jump on us with the bat and we never really recovered. When you're chasing a big total it can come undone like that, and we were totally outplayed in all three facets.

"[Net run rate] took a hammering, didn't it? You've got to plan to win the next four games and get some luck on the way. But we have belief in our team to do that."

Devon Conway is the player of the match

By Dean Bilton

Bit of a no-brainer, though credit should go to Finn Allen, Tim Southee and Mitch Santner. But that was just about a perfect T20 innings from Conway - free-scoring and assertive with hardly a risk taken. He played to all corners of the SCG, and the Aussies quickly found they were powerless to stop him.

That's it! New Zealand wins by 89 runs

By Dean Bilton

(Getty Images: Stephen Markham)

It's Australia's heaviest defeat ever at a T20 World Cup, but it feels even more significant than the heavy margin. This is the sort of demoralising loss that teams can struggle to come back from - New Zealand completely outplayed Australia in every facet from the first ball to the last tonight.

Australia's bowlers were inconsistent and couldn't find a way to stem the scoring of Devon Conway and co. Their fielding was uncharacteristically sloppy. And the batting was just dismal, the run chase never coming close to getting off the ground.

This is New Zealand's first win in any format in Australia since 2011, and they've done it in some style. A statement from the Black Caps, cause for serious concern for Australia.

OUT! Cummins skies one and is caught by Conway!

By Dean Bilton

That makes figures of 3-6 for Tim Southee, and completes a pretty frightful drubbing for Australia. The Black Caps have played them off the SCG tonight.

22 Oct 2022, 10:23am
18th over - Tim Southee into the attack

By Dean Bilton

He's got Cummins on strike.

22 Oct 2022, 10:20am
17th over - Boult has three to come

By Dean Bilton

Josh Hazlewood is the last man to stride to the middle. Still 21 balls left in this innings, but only one wicket left for Australia to protect.

Hazlewood gets off the mark with a little tickle out to deep square leg. Just a single.

Punch down the ground from Cummins for a single, and that's the end of Boult's night. 2-24 from his four overs, pretty handy.

22 Oct 2022, 10:19am
BOWLED HIM! Zampa knocked over by Boult now!

By Dean Bilton

So much for trying to see out the overs. Zampa is deceived by the knuckle ball and loses his leg stump. Nine down now.

22 Oct 2022, 10:18am
17th over - Boult has five to come

By Dean Bilton

Adam Zampa is in, and he's tried to ramp his first ball over the keeper. You can probably guess how that went down.

22 Oct 2022, 10:17am
BOWLED HIM! Starc is skittled by Boult

By Dean Bilton

Full, straight, swing, miss. Starc departs. Another step closer for New Zealand.

22 Oct 2022, 10:16am
17th over - Boult to bowl his final over

By Dean Bilton

Starc on strike.

16th over - Ferguson steaming in again

By Dean Bilton

He's got Cummins on strike.

FOUR! Pretty well played by Cummins in the end. A back-foot chip over cover that finds its way to the boundary.

SIX! Shot, Patty! Just a punch over long on and into the Ladies' Stand. Very nice cricket shot indeed from Cummins.

Nicely timed down the ground from Cummins, but the sweeper keeps it to one.

One more to Starc to end the Ferguson over. Four to come.

22 Oct 2022, 10:08am
15th over - Trent Boult back into the attack

By Dean Bilton

Swing a miss from Cummins, who certainly looks like he's still trying to score.

In the air from Cummins, but just short of Neesham at cow corner. A single.

Dealing in singles and the odd extra at the moment as we seemingly cross off the balls before a Black Caps win.

Six off that Boult over. Five more to bowl.

22 Oct 2022, 10:06am
14th over - Sodhi has three to come

By Dean Bilton

Had just been thinking that Australia would be best served simply seeing out the 20 overs to protect the net run rate, but that shot from Maxwell kinda flies in the face of that.

Mitch Starc is out there now, and off the mark with a single to long on.

One more for Cummins, and that's the over. Sodhi finishes his four overs with figures of 1-29. Lovely stuff.

22 Oct 2022, 10:05am
BOWLED HIM! Maxwell misses the reverse and is on his way!

By Dean Bilton

Just rewards for Ish Sodhi, who has deserved a wicket tonight. Maxwell was throwing everything at the reverse/switch hits, but was beaten in flight by that one. He goes for 28.

22 Oct 2022, 10:03am
14th over - Sodhi to complete his spell

By Dean Bilton

Four straight from the spinner. He and Santner have both been excellent in making sure Australia haven't ever been able to find any momentum.

22 Oct 2022, 10:00am
13th over - Ferguson steaming in now

By Dean Bilton

Pat Cummins comes to the crease needing a miracle.

SHOT! Cummins throws some wood at it and connects well enough. Clipped behind sqaure on the on side for four.

One more for Cummins, making just the five from Ferguson's set. It's a Black Caps masterclass out there tonight.

22 Oct 2022, 9:58am
OUT! Wade nicks off for 2, Ferguson strikes

By Dean Bilton

Pretty simple stuff! Wade looked to drive a ball that wasn't full enough for the shot, got a little nick on it and delivered a simple catch to Conway behind the stumps.

Call me crazy, but I think New Zealand are going to win this.

22 Oct 2022, 9:57am
13th over - Lockie Ferguson back into the attack

By Dean Bilton

Pure pace for Wade and Maxwell to deal with now.
