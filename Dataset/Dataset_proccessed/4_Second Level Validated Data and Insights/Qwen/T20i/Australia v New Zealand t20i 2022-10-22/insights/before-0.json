        "Finn Allen b Southee 21 (18b 2x4 1x6 27m)",
        "Devon Conway b Southee 92* (58b 11x4 2x6)",
        "Glenn Phillips made a catch that will become the image of this very one-sided match",
        "Tim Southee took 124 wickets, the most in all of T20I cricket",
        "David Warner got out playing the reverse sweep to Zampa",
        "Australia won by 8 wickets with 7 balls remaining"
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "New Zealand last beat Australia in Australia in December 2011. They've finally followed it up, 15 matches later, with a performance that maybe makes it all worth it.",
        "Trent Boult is New Zealand's gun bowler. They have brought him here even though he is no longer on their retainer.",
        "Australia will need to score more runs than anybody has ever done to win a T20I on these shores.",
        "The abiding image of Kane Williamson's batting is how late he plays the ball. But close on the heels of that is his high elbow. The same elbow that's been so dodgy lately.",
        "Kane Williamson got out playing the sweep to Adam Zampa."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Kane Williamson got out playing the sweep to Adam Zampa. Shiva Jayaraman tells me his average playing the sweep (of various kinds) against spinners since 2021 is 8.0, SR - 148, 4 dismissals in 22 balls. He was actively forced to take a poor option because of what happened before."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Jimmy Neesham does the Andre Russell role. The Dinesh Karthik role. The Tim David role. Perhaps not as well, or to as much acclaim as the others, but he is still mighty effective.",
        "New Zealand are playing blind here. There is rain expected. This game will shrink. Australia will have 10 full wickets to gun down a reduced target in reduced overs."
