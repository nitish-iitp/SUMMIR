        "The first T20I saw Australia come out on top against the hosts in a game characterized by swings and shifts.",
        "England lost a couple of wickets than the Aussies in their powerplay and scored only 46 runs in the powerplay.",
        "England would not be reading too much into the performance, especially because the English are short of T20I experience as compared to the Aussies.",
        "They would be keen on bettering their performance this time around."

        "The Sophia Gardens is a venue not commonly used as far as international cricket is concerned. Out of the nine T20Is played here, six have been won by the team chasing.",
        "More of the same is expected as the team winning the toss is more than likely to have a bowl first."
