        "Bangladesh and Pakistan face off in Adelaide on Sunday with their fate in their own hands, though only to a certain extent - Pakistan are more likely semi-finalists than Bangladesh.",
        "Neither of them might eventually make it, but a win will go some distance for two teams that have been inconsistent so far.",
        "Bangladesh might be still smarting from their five-run defeat to India, which was followed by fake-fielding accusations against Virat Kohli.",
        "Pakistan will be aware of these gaps in Bangladesh's make-up. They recently met in Christchurch in a tri-series designed as a build-up for the World Cup; Pakistan beat Bangladesh both times, although they had to fight for the wins on either occasion.",
        "For Pakistan, there are worries, especially because of the low returns from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan: across four games in this World Cup, their opening stands have given Pakistan 1, 13, 16 and 4. Babar has been dismissed for single-digit scores each time.",
        "Shadab Khan's maiden T20I fifty couldn't have come at a more opportune time for Pakistan. His knock of 52 from just 22 balls against South Africa took them from a difficult position to one of safety. Later, his two wickets in one over turned the game around for Pakistan.",
        "It has not been a great World Cup so far for Nurul Hasan. He has made only 41 runs in four innings despite coming out to bat with 9 and 9.4 overs remaining in two of those. He has looked like he has pulled the trigger too early in his innings, or premeditating his shots.",
        "Bangladesh, too, are likely to retain the same side from the India game for this one.",
        "Three out of four matches at the Adelaide Oval have been won by the side defending a total, with the average score batting first in those matches being 179. Teams have been helped by the short square boundaries too."
