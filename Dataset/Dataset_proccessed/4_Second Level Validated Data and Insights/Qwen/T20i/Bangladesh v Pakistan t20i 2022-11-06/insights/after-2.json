        "Pakistan makes it to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup winning against Bangladesh",
        "Bangladesh could not capitalize on the good start by Najmul Hossain Shanto and that total was never going to be enough for the Pakistani batting lineup.",
        "In the bowling department, Bangladesh looked sloppy in the field, and could not capitalize on the chances provided by the Pakistani Batters.",
        "Shakib Al Hasan could not make a mark through his captaincy or bowling getting 1 wicket for 35 runs and becoming the costliest bowler for Bangladesh.",
        "Nasum Ahmed stood out for Bangladesh in the bowling department, keeping Bangladesh in the match till he was bowling.",
        "After his spell was over Pakistani batters made sure they were at pace with required run rate, a bit of wickets in the middle did cause some hurdles but flourish from Shan Masood in the end did the job for Pakistan."
