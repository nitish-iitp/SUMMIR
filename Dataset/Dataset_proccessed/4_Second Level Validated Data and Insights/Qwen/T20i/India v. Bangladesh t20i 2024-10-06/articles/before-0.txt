KEY HIGHLIGHTS
India are set to take on Bangladesh in a three-match T20I series.
Many fringe players in the Team India setup have been included in the squad.
A 22-year-old sensation is expected to make his debut in the series.
India are all set to take on Bangladesh in a three-match T20I series starting on October 6, 2024 (Sunday). The squad for the series has been unveiled, and several players who will be playing in the upcoming Test Series against New Zealand have been rested for this series. This allows India to test their bench strength and try out fringe players, with the T20 World Cup 2026 still close to two years away.
Now reportedly, a young sensation who created waves during IPL 2024 is set to make his Team India debut in the series.
Mayank Yadav Certain to Make Debut In Series Vs Bangladesh
According to a report by PTI, 22-year-old pacer Mayank Yadav is certain to make his debut for Team India at some point of time in the series against Bangladesh, in the absence of regular names like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Yadav impressed for Lucknow Super Giants in just four games in the IPL. He became the second-fastest Indian bowler ever as he clocked a speed of 156.7 kmph.
He also picked up 7 wickets with his express pace.
However, he was sidelined after that match with a side strain. BCCI, recognizing his special talent, had fast-tracked him and given him treatment at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). He has now made his way into the squad vs Bangladesh in the T20I format.
The PTI report states that pacer Harshit Rana and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy are also set to get their debut caps for India in this series. Both were part of the initial squad for the T20I series vs Zimbabwe. While Reddy was ruled out ahead of the series with an injury, Rana did not get a single game.
India Squad For T20I Series Vs Bangladesh:
Suryakumar Yadav (C), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Riyan Parag, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Mayank Yadav
