Commentary
22:23 (IST) Oct 06

Right then, that is it from this game where India takes a 1-0 lead and will be looking to wrap up the series in the next game while Bangladesh will be hoping to level it. The 2nd T20I will be played on 9th October, Wednesday in New Delhi at the iconic Arun Jaitley Stadium. It will start at 1.30 pm GMT, but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up to the match. Until then, cheers and goodbye!

22:20 (IST) Oct 06

Arshdeep Singh is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliant bowling spell. He says that there was a breeze going around from the end he was bowling. Adds that he did not get his first wicket the way he wanted but was happy with it anyway. Mentions that he makes minor changes like with his wrists or fingers to bring in the variations. Says that the young bowlers have done well especially Mayank Yadav who had a good debut. Ends by saying that, this format is all about adapting to situations, conditions, and ground dimensions.

22:18 (IST) Oct 06

Suryakumar Yadav, the victorious skipper of India says they just tried to back their skills and tried to walk the talk. Mentions it was great how the guys showed character and selflessness. On being asked about the two debutants, Mayank and Nitish, he appreciates them and says they are interesting players and is looking forward to watching them do well in future games. On being asked about so many players to choose from, he jokingly says it is a good headache to have many options at your disposal when you are on the field. Concludes by saying there's always room to learn and improve in every game.

22:17 (IST) Oct 06

Najmul Hossain Shanto, the captain of Bangladesh says that they did not start well. Adds that in T20s it is important to play well in the Powerplay but they didn't. Mentions that the plan was to bat positively but they also need to adjust according to the situation. Tells that they need to focus on strike rotation and not only on hitting boundaries. Says that they scored 95-odd runs in 14 overs but lost too many wickets. Ends by saying that it is difficult for the bowlers to defend such a low score on a wicket like this, but still Rishad Hossain bowled well and Fizz delivered a couple of decent overs.

22:11 (IST) Oct 06

Presentation Time...

22:10 (IST) Oct 06

Varun Chakaravarthy is up for a quick chat. He says it feels like a rebirth for him to be back in the blues after 3 long years.  Adds he just wanted to stick to the process, and that's what he tried to do in the Indian T20 League earlier this year. Adds he doesn't want to think and express too much. Mentions he played a few leagues and got to learn a lot in the TNPL alongside Ravichandran Ashwin, and it was a good preparation for him for this series. Says once you're not in the Indian team, people write you off and you just need to keep doing the job sincerely.

22:09 (IST) Oct 06

Earlier in the game, Bangladesh posted a below-par total with only Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mehidy Hasan crossing the 20-run mark. Arshdeep Singh and Varun Chakaravarthy were the pick of the bowlers for India with three wickets each while debutant, Mayank Yadav also performed well and got one. Hardik Pandya and Washington Sundar also chipped in with one each as well. It was a real all-round performance from the World T20 champions and the batters also made the chase look like a cakewalk.

22:07 (IST) Oct 06

Not much to talk about the bowling of Bangladesh and it was not helped by the fact that their batters did not show up for this game. They were put under pressure early on from the Indian openers and never seemed to recover from that. Mehidy Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman were the ones with a wicket to their name while the other one was a run out. However, there were a few positives, mainly the spinners. Rishad Hossain did not get a wicket but bowled really well and Shoriful Islam was also economical in his two overs and this is something they can build on in the upcoming games.

22:03 (IST) Oct 06

The target for India was not a big one, but the way they executed the chase was excellent. The positive intent was visible right from the start when the two openers took on the attack. Abhishek Sharma fell to an unfortunate run out but not before playing a fiery cameo. It was actually selfless batting from all the players and no one was going for personal milestone. Sanju Samson failed to convert his start again but showed his class in his knock of 29 off 19. SKY was exceptional and displayed a show of brilliant whips and flicks which also ultimately proved to be his downfall. With not much required to chase, Hardik Pandya and Nitish Kumar Reddy joined hands and made sure to finish the job. Reddy was the second fiddle while Pandya stayed unbeaten on 39 off just 16 balls finishing things off with little more than 8 overs to spare.

21:55 (IST) Oct 06

DOMINANCE FROM INDIA! The first T20I in this new stadium in Gwalior and the Men in Blue were simply brilliant with both bat and bowl providing an incredible experience for the packed crowd. The hosts take the early lead in the series with Bangladesh having their task cut out now.

Taskin Ahmed to Hardik Pandya, Six!SIX! HARDIK PANDYA FINISHES OFF IN STYLE FOR INDIA! Banged in short and on the top of the stumps, Hardik Pandya stands tall, backs away, swings hard, and slaps the pull rows behind the deep mid-wicket fence for a huge six. Hardik kills the game with 49 balls remaining and 7 wickets in hand.

However, he connects it off the middle and the ball goes racing away to the deep backward point fence for a boundary while the bat flies to the square leg region. It's all happening here!

21:42 (IST) Oct 06

Drinks! There seemed to be some issue with Hardik Pandya and the umpires have decided to call for drinks. India are absolutely cruising along in the chase and the question is how quickly can they get the job done. The intent have been clear from every batter and it is to attack no matter what.

On a length and on middle, Sanju Samson pats it down in front of short mid-wicket and seeing Samson gearing up with a couple of steps ahead, Abhishek Sharma sets off for the run.

Towhid Hridoy picks up and scores a direct hit at the bowler's end with Sharma nowhere near the crease. There was never a run there. Abhishek Sharma walks back after a quick-fire 16 off 7!

Welcome back for the second innings! The umpires are punctual and so are the players of Bangladesh who spread out to the field. Out walk the two openers for India. It's a brand-new opening pair of Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma. With the former taking the strike. Shoriful Islam with a slip in place is all in readiness to get the proceedings underway with the new ball. And, here we go...

20:50 (IST) Oct 06

... THE RUN CHASE ...

20:48 (IST) Oct 06

Well then, the first inning has flown by in this series opener. India has a target within reach to chase and will aim to mirror their bowling performance with the bat as well. Bangladesh on the other hand, will be required to bring their A-game with the ball. They do pose a threatening pace attack and would like them to contribute effectively. An exciting run chase up next in just a few minutes. Stay tuned.

20:47 (IST) Oct 06

Since the ball did some mischief too, Varun Chakravarthy came in handy and chipped in with a three-wicket haul to his name as well. India didn't let the opposition off the hook in the mid-overs, with identical bowling in the death as well, conceding only 16 runs and taking 3 wickets in the last 4. In the end, Hardik and Arshdeep did the cleaning of the tail effectively, eventually bowling them out in 19.5 overs.

20:46 (IST) Oct 06

India, on the other hand, began right on the money with Arshdeep setting the foundation in the very first over with a wicket. The new ball moved and got a bit of a variable bounce which helped the seamers to tie the batters up. It was Mayank Yadav though, who created impact straightaway in his debut match. First, delivered a maiden and then snagged his first T20I wicket, adding more trouble to the opposition.

20:46 (IST) Oct 06

Throughout, Bangladesh looked in a bit of hurry from the word go to accelerate and put the hosts under pressure, but it proved to be a two-faced sword for them. They needed a strong partnership after that initial collapse. But in contrast, they kept losing wickets and slipped down to 111/7 at the end of the 16th over. With an aim to ascend in the death overs, and Mehidy Hasan settled in well by then, he too, was left stranded at one end. As a result, Bangladesh, under steeping pressure, couldn't get the required momentum. Mehidy Hasan though, played well for his unbeaten 35.

20:44 (IST) Oct 06

Bangladesh started in a bit of a rusty fashion and lost their openers inside the restrictions. The batters tried to adapt to the pitch and tried to take the attack on right away. Hence, they could only mount 39/2 on the board in the Powerplay. In a desperate need to construct partnerships, Najmul Hossain Shanto attempted to launch a counter-offensive. He was the only one who looked settled but searched for partners at the other end.

20:43 (IST) Oct 06

A comprehensive bowling display by the Men in Blue through and through! They have reduced Bangladesh to just above a run-a-ball in this first T20I. To be fair, the tourists just couldn't get going in the innings and only Najmul Hossain Shanto along with Mehidy Hasan could cross the 20-run mark.
