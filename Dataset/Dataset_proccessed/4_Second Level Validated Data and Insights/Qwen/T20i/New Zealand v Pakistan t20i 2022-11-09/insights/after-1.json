    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Pakistan produced a superb all-round performance. The bowlers allowed New Zealand only 12 boundaries (ten fours, two sixes), with Shaheen Shah Afridi again proving to be the leader of the pack with 2-24. The other bowlers took only one wicket between them but they all kept it tight, with nobody going for more than 8.25 an over.",
        "The fielding was sharper than usual."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Babar Azam pays tribute to the crowd. “We are feeling like we’re playing at home!” he says. “Everyone is coming and cheering for Pakistan team.” He gives the rest of the credit to his bowlers: “We had a good start with the ball, we have good spinners with Shadab and Nawaz bowling very well, and the fast bowlers finished very well.” Modesty forbids him to dwell on his own return to form, which came at just the right time.",
        "Kane Williamson, as ever, is generous in defeat. “We were outplayed,” he says. “Pakistan bowled really nicely, we managed to wrestle back a little bit of momentum, at half-way we felt that was a competitive total. Very disappointing to not make Pakistan work a lot harder… They certainly deserve their win.”"

        "The pitch: not looking its best",
        "Teams: both unchanged",

    "Others": [
        "So Pakistan are in the final, which takes place in Melbourne on Sunday (7pm local time, 8am in the UK). If they end up lifting the trophy, they may have to dedicate it to the cricketers of the Netherlands, without whose shock victory over South Africa Pakistan would not have reached this semi-final.",
        "So New Zealand, the team of the first fortnight of the tournament, are heading home.",
        "When Pakistan’s openers found their form, the Kiwis had no plan B.",
        "It’s especially cruel for Daryl Mitchell, whose record in T20 World Cup semi-finals is unbelievable: 72 not out against England last year, 53 not out today.",
        "The crowd are roaring, and so are the cornered tigers.",
        "With two needed, Haris goes for glory and top-edges to short fine leg, but he has done his job. Pakistan need two off six balls.",
        "With the pitch (low and slow) making them feel at home. Shaheed Shah Afridi was superb, taking 2-24 off his four overs."
