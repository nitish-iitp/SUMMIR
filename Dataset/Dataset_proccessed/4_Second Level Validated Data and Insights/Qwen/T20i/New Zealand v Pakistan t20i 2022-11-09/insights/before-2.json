    "Key Match Events": [
        "Babar gets to 50 off 38 balls",
        "Rizwan gets a waist-high full toss from Boult, that he can only belt into the hands of Glenn Phillips",
        "Pakistan allowed only 54 runs off the last six overs of the innings",
        "Mitchell gets to fifty off 32 balls",
        "Shaheen gets Kane"
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "New Zealand have eight frontline spin overs, through Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner",
        "Shadab Khan is Pakistan's only frontline option, though Mohammad Nawaz is there as well",
        "Teams in a second. But meanwhile, get over to our show, where we are previewing this game.",
        "While the teams walk out for the anthems, our number crunchers have worked out that spinners have a substantially better economy rate at this venue this World Cup, than seamers",
        "New Zealand have arguably been the team of the tournament so far"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Pakistan won by 7 wickets (with 5 balls remaining)",
        "Pakistan were outstanding in the last six overs, allowing just 53 runs off those 36 deliveries",
        "Babar and Rizwan raced through the powerplay, crashing 55 runs in those six overs",
        "Pakistan dominated with the bat, putting on 105 for the first wicket bringing the required chase down to a little over a run a ball",
        "Pakistan were better with the bat, better with the ball, and incredibly, given the opposition, substantially better in the field as well"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Rain delays led to the game being postponed until the next day",
        "Haris gets out with two to get, but Pakistan are in the World Cup final!",
        "New Zealand made sure to run extremely hard between the wickets though, and perhaps by doing so, have given their own outstanding attack a chance to defend this",
        "Babar wishes he had those kinds of numbers. So far in the tournament, he has a top-score of 25. He's not only not scoring fast enough, he's just plain not scoring"
