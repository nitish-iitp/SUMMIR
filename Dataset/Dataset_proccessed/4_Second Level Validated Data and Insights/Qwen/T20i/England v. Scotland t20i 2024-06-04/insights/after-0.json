        "A small but lively crowd had pitched up for this 10.30am start, with children from Jofra Archer’s old school, Christ Church Foundation, among them.",
        "Sir Garfield Sobers was looking on from a wicker chair at the top of the Worrell, Weekes and Walcott Stand, while, in contrast to his regal air, visiting fans larked about in the swimming pool on the boundary’s edge.",
        "When the match eventually resumed at 2.10pm local time after more than two hours of waiting, its structure had been reconfigured to 10 overs per side and a revised target for England."

    "Others": [
        "The first abandonment of this T20 World Cup came between two countries not unfamiliar with the wet stuff.",
        "England will need to be far sharper against Australia on Saturday than was witnessed here.",
        "After a delayed start – in part because of water had leaked through the covers and on to the pitch – a couple of misfields in the ring and a wicket off a no-ball from Mark Wood enabled Scotland to reach 51 for no loss from the initial 6.2 overs.",
        "This time it was Munsey who put his foot down, the left-hander who had earlier profited from Wood’s overstep helping to cart Adil Rashid for 18 runs in the eighth over."
