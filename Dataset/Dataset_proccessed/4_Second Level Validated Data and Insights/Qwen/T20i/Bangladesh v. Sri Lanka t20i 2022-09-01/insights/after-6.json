        "Shakib Al Hasan said, 'We wanted to field first, but that's not in our control. We didn't bat well against Afghanistan, but today is a different day. We have three changes in our team, we have made quite a few changes. Hopefully that will work for us today. We want to play some good cricket today, we are not concerned about what is being talked in the media.'",
        "Dasun Shanaka said, 'We are going to bowl first. It's a used wicket, so chasing will be important. We had a good preparation coming into this game. We are concentrate on our batting.'"
