        "Johannesburg is expected to have clear and sunny weather during the match. The temperature will be around 27 degrees during the game.",
        "The pitch at the Wanderers is expected to be a batting beauty. The track is generally quite hard and the ball comes onto the bat easily. Pace bowlers will struggle after the initial phase and spinners will have to be careful with their lines on this flat surface. The average first innings score in the last five T20I matches played here has been 179 runs."
