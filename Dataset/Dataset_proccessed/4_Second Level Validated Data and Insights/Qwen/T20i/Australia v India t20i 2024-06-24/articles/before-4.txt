MUMBAI: BCCI secretary Jay Shah has invited all the representatives of the state associations under it for a get-together at the board's headquarters in Mumbai and to “exchange ideas to improve cricket in India” and watch the India versus Australia T20 World Cup match on June 24.
In a communication to the state associations on June 14, Shah has written: “It is my pleasure to extend an invitation to you to come to Mumbai to have a session to meet, exchange ideas and watch together the India vs Australia World Cup match on June 24, 2024," Shah has stated in his communication.
"Friends, it has been sometime since we have met in person and had discussions on important topics. I feel (that) it is imperative that we meet from time to time and have regular informal discussion on the issues concerning cricket and how to further improve cricket in India. It is with these things in mind that I hereby invite you to an evening of exchanging ideas and discussion at Mumbai along with a live stream of the exciting match between India and Australia in the ongoing T20 World Cup.”
