        "South Africa's equation was the simplest: beat Netherlands, play the semi-final.",
        "Kagiso Rabada found himself carved through the offside first-ball by Stephan Myburgh, and spent the entire over, guessing and second-guessing a man who simply backed himself against one of the fastest bowlers in the world.",
        "De Kock averages just 11.4 in T20I cricket against left-arm pace this year, and he ended up pushing that average down further when he managed just six off eight balls - out of 13 off 13 - and lost his wicket to Fred Klaassen.",
