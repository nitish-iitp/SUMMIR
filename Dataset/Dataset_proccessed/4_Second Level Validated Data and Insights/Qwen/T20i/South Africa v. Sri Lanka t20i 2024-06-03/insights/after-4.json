    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Aiden Markram said, 'We actually would've bowled. Not sure how the wicket is going to play. Team has been together now for few years - majority of the squad. Did well at the ODI World Cup, ideally would've liked to go a few steps further.'"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Wanindu Hasaranga said, 'Our batters tried for 160-170. To be honest this was a 120 wicket especially with our bowlers. We went with our strength - our bowling, that's why we batted first. We wanted to put a score and then defend. This is early in the tournament and we have three more games, we want to do much better, especially with our batting talent. If our batting does well, we can finish well.'",
        "Aiden Markram said, 'Happy with the win. The batting was little up and down, probably speaks to quite a tough wicket and luckily we found ways to score on this. It was a tough one from a batting point of view, we try as much as we can to take the pitch out of it, we can take some learnings from it and we are experienced. Lots of different conditions as we move around, fortunately we have our next two here so we know what's coming but it's important to adapt as we go ahead.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Snipers have been deployed in and around the ground due to tightened security measures.",
        "Sri Lanka lost Pathum Nissanka early to Oliver Baartman but Kusal Mendis and Kamindu Mendis have been steady and will look to counter-attack to ramp up the scoring rate."
