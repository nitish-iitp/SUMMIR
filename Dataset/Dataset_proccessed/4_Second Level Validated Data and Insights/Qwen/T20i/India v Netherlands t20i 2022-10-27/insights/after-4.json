        "India captain Rohit Sharma: 'When you're expected to win, the pressure is a lot more. This was a near-perfect game for us. Won't say we were in a spot of bother at the start, wicket was on the slower side and we couldn't play our shots right at the start. With the ball, we were clinical.'",
        "Netherlands captain Scott Edwards: 'Definitely the noisiest crowd I've played in front of. It was an awesome experience. It was always going to be tricky chasing 180. Thought we bowled reasonably well, if you don't get wickets, with the batting order they've got, would've been tough to restrict. Looking forward now to our game against Pakistan.'",
        "Suryakumar Yadav: 'Just wanted to express myself. Message was loud and clear when I went in to bat. Wanted to go at 8-10 an over. Enjoying batting with Kohli.'"
