    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Heavy rain in Florida all week and the outfield in Lauderhill was extremely wet on Friday morning.",
        "USA had begun their campaign with a victory against Canada in Dallas, and then they upset Pakistan in a Super Over to become strong contenders to qualify for the Super Eight.",
        "Though they were then beaten by India, USA came to Florida needing only one point from the match against Ireland to qualify.",
        "The result also ensured that USA would be among the automatic qualifiers for the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.",
        "Friday's washout eliminated Pakistan, Canada and Ireland from Group A, and all three teams are scheduled to play in Florida over the weekend, weather permitting."
