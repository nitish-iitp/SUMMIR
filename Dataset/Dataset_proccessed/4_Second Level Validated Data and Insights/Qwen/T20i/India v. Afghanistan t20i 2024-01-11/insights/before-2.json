        "Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are back in the T20I squad for the first time since India's semi-final loss to England at the 2022 T20 World Cup.",
        "Kohli, though, will miss Thursday's game because of personal reasons.",
        "Rohit's return also forces a change at the top. Head coach Rahul Dravid confirmed that Rohit and Yashasvi Jaiswal are India's first-choice openers in T20Is.",
        "Jaiswal's ability to attack from the first ball also makes him a better prospect than Shubman Gill, who is the third opener in the squad.",
        "While Gill has improved his six-hitting ability, his powerplay strike rate in all T20s since the start of 2023 is only 138.44 while Jaiswal's is 163.69.",
        "Afghanistan will be keen to build on their gains from the 2023 ODI World Cup. They will play nine T20Is between now and the T20 World Cup.",
        "Rohit Sharma gave India blazing starts at the ODI World Cup, scoring at a strike rate of 135.01 in the powerplay.",

        "Samson or Jitesh could be picked as wicketkeeper in the absence of Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya.",
        "India have now lost 11 tosses in a row. The probability of that happening is 0.0005.",
        "Rohit needs 147 runs to become the second batter after Kohli to reach 4000 T20I runs.",
        "Mohammad Nabi needs 123 runs and eight wickets to complete the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets in T20Is.",
