        "Suryakumar hit a six over extra cover and a trademark flick off back-to-back deliveries to kill the chase.",
        "Dube dug out a yorker-length delivery to long-off to complete a brace and seal India’s victory."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "India awarded five penalty runs with India needing 35 off 30 due to USA failing to start a new over within a minute three times.",
        "Saurabh Netravalkar put down a tough chance at short third man.",
        "Aaron Jones was switching fields every ball, running up to have a bowler between deliveries, all of it playing into the hands of the batters.",
        "Jones happy to operate with seamers Corey Anderson and Jasdeep Singh. Perhaps he's mindful of the match-up and the left-handed presence of Dube, because of which Harmeet Singh, the left-arm spinner, is being held back."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Suryakumar reprieved from a difficult situation, with a dropped chance by Saurabh Netravalkar potentially turning the game.",
        "Aaron Jones' dismissal could be a turning point in the match."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Shivam Dube, who bowled all of one over in IPL 2024, was given the ball and USA went after him immediately.",
        "The pitch to be used for this match is No. 3, which was used for yesterday's Canada v Pakistan game too. All of these pitches have had appreciable seam movement, so a no-brainer to bowl first if you win the toss."
