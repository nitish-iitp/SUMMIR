        "England will be staring elimination in the face once again, unless they can overcome one of the tournament's two unbeaten sides at the Gabba.",
        "This is a must-win for England.",
        "Two wins should be enough for England to reach the semi-final.",
        "Ireland's Lorcan Tucker's unbeaten 71 closed the margin of defeat significantly for Australia.",
        "Trent Boult and Tim Southee, New Zealand's opening bowlers across formats for most of the last decade, have been lethal with the new ball since arriving in Australia.",
        "Jos Buttler has been very successful against Boult in T20s: but can he take his Rajasthan Royals team-mate down in Brisbane when it matters most?",
        "England's seamers were excellent with the new ball against Afghanistan but were wayward against Ireland; they conceded 59 runs in the first six overs, with Chris Woakes coming in for particularly brutal treatment.",
        "Finn Allen is the key wicket: New Zealand blitzed 65 for 1 against Australia when he raced out of the blocks but stumbled to 25 for 3 against Sri Lanka after he fell early on.",
        "Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone could be shuffled up after limited opportunities so far this tournament.",
        "Mitchell Santner bowled a solitary over in last year's semi-final, with Kane Williamson reluctant to use him against Dawid Malan and Moeen. England have added an extra left-hander to their middle order this year in Ben Stokes, which could block Santner's use again; as a result, New Zealand might consider bringing Michael Bracewell, the offspinning allrounder, into their side.",
        "Buttler will become the second player to reach 100 men's T20Is for England after Eoin Morgan, and will overtake his predecessor as their all-time leading run-scorer in the format if he can makes at least 64.",
        "Malan has dominated Sodhi during their previous meetings in T20Is, hitting 105 runs off the 58 balls. It is one of only five head-to-head match-ups in T20I history where a batter has scored more than 100 runs off a single bowler, where ball-by-ball data is available.",
        "Allen has the highest strike rate in T20 history among batters with at least 1000 runs.",
        "New Zealand have never played a T20I at the Gabba, and have a poor historic record there across formats. They have not won a game in Brisbane in the last 20 years, their most recent victory coming in an ODI against South Africa in January 2002."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "David Hussey describes the Gabba as 'probably the best batting pitch in Australia for white-ball cricket', and the average scoring rate there in men's T20Is is 7.94 per over, the second-highest of any Australian ground.",
        "Bad weather has followed England around over the last week, and the forecast for the match is not the best either, with rain due to fall throughout Tuesday morning. However, the weather is expected to clear up later in the day, and the Gabba's renowned underground drainage system could ensure the teams get on to the pitch."
