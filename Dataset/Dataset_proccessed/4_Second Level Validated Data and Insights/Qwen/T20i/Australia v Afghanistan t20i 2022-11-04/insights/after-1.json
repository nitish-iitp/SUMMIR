    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Glenn Maxwell: 'Certainly did, Afghanistan played well, struck the ball cleanly. Started well in the powerplay and we were able to haul it back, but there was some pretty clean hitting at the end.'",
        "Matthew Wade: 'Never really felt safe. [Eng-SL game] We'll stay here and watch that game, hoping for a bit of an upset. We put ourselves in that situation, been trying to chase a bit of run rate but it hasn’t gone our way. [Finch, David fitness?] Yeah, hopeful they’ll be right to go if we make the semis.'",
        "Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi: 'Really good game of cricket. They started really well but at the end Naveen and Farooqi bowled well and it wasn't a big total on that pitch. We started well in the powerplay and the middle, but threw away four wickets back to back and that put us under pressure. [Two washouts] Tough when you play first game and then don't play for 10 days. We didn't get that momentum but improved every game from there.'"
