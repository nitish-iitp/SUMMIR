        "Kane Richardson dismissed Rahmanullah Gurbaz after a catch was dropped off his own bowling to get Australia firmly on top of the game.",
        "They will be slightly disappointed that they were unable to wrap up the inning early, allowing their opponents to almost overcome the target but they have sealed a crucial win."
