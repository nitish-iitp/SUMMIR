        "India adapted well and got 180, which was a great effort from the batters. We had class bowlers who defended it perfectly. Everyone came in and did their job, that’s critical and we dwell on it.",
        "SKY [Suryakumar] and Hardik’s partnership was critical at that point, we needed someone to bat deep, which they did. We know Bumrah’s class and what he can do. Important for us to use him smartly regardless of conditions. He’s willing to take responsibility and he’s been doing it for years."
