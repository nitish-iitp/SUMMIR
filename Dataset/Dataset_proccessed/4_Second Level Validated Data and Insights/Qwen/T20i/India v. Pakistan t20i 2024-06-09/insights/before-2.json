        "The ICC is hoping to make a big push for cricket in the USA with the India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup match.",
        "Growing up in Calcutta in the 1980s, I clearly remember deserted streets, shops pulling down their shutters early, and people returning from their places of work with an added spring of anticipation in their steps whenever there was an India vs Pakistan cricket match.",
        "Over the decades, as cricket as a game changed, the players and teams changed, the jerseys changed, the administrations changed, popularity of the players soared, social media took over our lives and more and more money came into the sport, the one thing that remained constant was the charm of an India vs Pakistan cricket match, regardless of format.",
        "The two teams incredibly didn’t play each other in the first four ODI World Cups (from 1975 to 1987). Both teams lost in the semi-finals of the 1987 edition and their first World Cup face-off was in 1992. And from then on, if you look at the winner’s column, it almost always reads India.",
        "The pitch in New York is an underprepared drop-in pitch brought in from Australia and prepared in Florida since last December using proprietary techniques honed for over a decade at the Adelaide Oval.",
        "The New York stadium can accommodate only about 34,000 people, compared to say the Ahmedabad stadium which has a capacity of 1,32,000 and was packed to the rafters for the 2023 ODI World Cup clash between the arch rivals."

        "The pitch in New York is underprepared and hardly any cricket has been played on them.",
        "The ICC and USA Cricket have also not made it easy for fans to keep the vigour of an India vs Pakistan World Cup match alive in this edition.",
        "The ICC wants to popularise the sport in America but the ticket prices are very, very expensive, ranging from $300 (just over Rs 25,000) for general admission tickets to $2500 and $10,000 for hospitality tickets."
