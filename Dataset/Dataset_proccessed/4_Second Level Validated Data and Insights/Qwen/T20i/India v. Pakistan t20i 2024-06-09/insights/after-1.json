    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Rohit Sharma: We didn’t bat well enough. I thought halfway through that we were in a good position, you expect guys to stitch partnerships together. We were 15-20 runs short, and every run matters. Nevertheless the bowlers did the job. It was a good wicket compared to the one we played on here (against Ireland).",
        "Rohit Sharma: There’s a never-say-die attitude in the team. We wanted to make early inroads but we didn’t. At the halfway stage we got together and said if things can happen to us, they can happen to them too.",
        "Rohit Sharma: The little contributions from everyone make the difference. Whoever has the ball wants to make the difference. Bumrah is going from strength to strength. I’m not going to talk too much about him, we want him to be in that kind of mindset till the end of this World Cup, he’s a genius with the ball.",
        "Rohit Sharma: The crowd was superb, they never disappoint, wherever we play in the world, they come out in huge numbers and support us. They’ll be going home with a big smile on their face as well. It’s just the start of the tournament, we have a long way to go.",
        "Babar Azam: I think they bowled well after ten overs. We were chasing 120 and we were a run a ball for the first 10 overs but back to back wickets and we left too much to do in the end.",
        "Babar Azam: Our tactics were simple, play normally, rotate strike, score five or six an over. We had too many dot balls, the pressure was on us, and we lost three quick wickets. We have not capitalised properly, the pitch looked decent and the ball was coming on nicely. It was a little bit slow and some balls are bouncing a bit more, but you expect that with a drop-in pitch."
