    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "No we would have bowled first. There will be dew later on, humidity is too much and the ball does not grip towards the end, that's why we are bowling first. But we will try and put a big score on the board. It is always a tough game against Pakistan.",
        "We are going to bowl first. The pitch looks like nice and the second thing is dew factor, that's why we are bowling first. Hopefully we pick early wickets and restrict them. The mood is cool and calm, and we will try to continue that momentum. A win always gives you confidence. We have the same team."
