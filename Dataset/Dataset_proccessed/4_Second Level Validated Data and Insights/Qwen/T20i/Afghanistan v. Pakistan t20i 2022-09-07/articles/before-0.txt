PAK vs AFG Match Preview:

Pakistan started their Super 4 journey in Asia Cup 2022 with a win against India by 5 wickets, pushing their NRR to +0.126 in the points table. A win against Afghanistan would be highly beneficial for the Pakistan team in reaching the finals of the Asia Cup. Mohammad Rizwan is currently the top scorer in the ongoing Asia Cup with 192 runs to his name in 3 matches, averaging 96 while striking at 128.00. Babar Azam's form has been a concern for the team but the promotion of Mohammad Nawaz at #4 proved game-changing and the batting order looks stable with the likes of Fakhar Zaman, Khushdil Shah & Iftikhar Ahmed. 

In the bowling department, Mohammad Nawaz has been the top wicket-taker with 7 wickets while vice-captain Shadab Khan has registered 6 wickets to his name in the tournament. Naseem Shah, a young revelation in Pakistan pace bowling, has picked up 5 wickets in the tournament. 

Afghanistan on the other hand started their Super 4 stage with a loss against Sri Lanka after remaining unbeaten in the group stage. In this scenario, Afghanistan would have to win this match or their qualification chances for the finals would be all but finished. Opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz has been the top scorer for the Afghanistan team in Asia Cup 2022 with 135 runs to his name in 3 matches, averaging 45.00 while striking at a magnificent 166.67. Ibrahim Zadran and Hazratullah Zazai are also in the top 10 run-getters and the Afghan team would be eager to win against Pakistan. 

Spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman has been the top wicket-taker in the tournament with 7 wickets to his name. Master Spinner Rashid Khan has picked up 4 wickets while captain Mohammad Nabi has registered three wickets to his name.
