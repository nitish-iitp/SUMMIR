        "USA muzzled an experienced Pakistan top order, brought their hitters to heel, then produced a measured batting performance that tied the scores at 159-all.",
        "This forced the game into a Super Over, and here is when USA really seemed like the veteran team on the circuit while Pakistan went into high-pressure-meltdown mode.",
        "Mohammad Amir, Pakistan's most experienced bowler, bowled three wides in his Super Over, the US batters stealing another run every time, and Mohammad Rizwan conceded another extra run on an overthrow off the last of these wides.",
        "Thanks to the extras and other acts of fielding indiscipline from Pakistan, USA made 18 off their Super Over",
        "Saurabh Netravalkar had Rizwan caught at slip - fairly spectacularly by Steven Taylor - to begin with, second over. Then, in the third, left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige had Usman Khan holing out to long-off, bringing Pakistan's score to 14 for 2."
