        "South Africa captain Aiden Markram: 'Hopefully we can tidy up a few things and the win looks a little bit more comprehensive. You are always going to feel like you should score more. It was a nice start but the wicket definitely changes up. It got slower and more stoppy. If you marry those things together it makes sense why you don't feel like you a bang. We'd rather finish like that than blow out for 160-170. It is big for us that the top order got some runs. It is big for Quinny [Quinton de Kock] to get his flow.'",
        "USA captain Aaron Jones: 'I don't want to say disappointed, but yeah it's hard to take the defeat after getting so close. I thought we could have been more disciplined bowling-wise. I think we have a really good unit, a lot of talent in the USA. When we play good cricket we can beat any team in the world. On their next match against West Indies in Bridgetown: Happy to going home for me personally, I know the conditions there. The majority of the guys enjoy playing in the Caribbean and hopefully we can play hard cricket.'",
        "Man of the match, Quinton de Kock: 'It is nice getting out on an easier wicket finally. We've had some tricky wickets coming up to this game so it was nice to get some time out in the middle. The boys played nicely and so did Team USA. They put us under pressure, particularly towards the end. It was a great game. I just focused on trying to score the runs with the wind and shorter boundary. The rest took control of itself. I don't think this game affects the rest of the Super 8s too much. We've got two big teams to play. We've got a different venue and surface next up so you never know what you're going to get out there.'"
