The Super 8 stage of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is upon with, as eight teams are divided into two groups and battle through more round-robin action to reach the semifinals.

DStv is the ultimate destination for Cricket fans, with an unparalleled selection of action from around the world. DStv Stream also allows viewers to watch their favourite cricket players and teams live anywhere, any time.

Group 1 is made up of India, Australia, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. It gets underway on the afternoon of Thursday 20 June with a clash between Afghanistan and India in Bridgetown Barbados, where the former team’s captain, Rashid Khan, will need to produce a special performance if they are to overcome the might of Rohit Sharma and his charges.

“As a bowler, if you keep thinking about the pitch more and the boundary [size] more, that's when you will concede runs,” explained Khan.

“Because you, the bowler, have already accepted that you're nothing. If I'm bowling a good yorker, no one is going to hit it. But if I'm bowling a bad ball and I don't have enough practice at bowling good balls again and again, that's where I'm going to get hit.”

Group 2 features the United States, South Africa, West Indies and England. The first match arrives on the afternoon of Wednesday 19 June, when the USA takes on SA at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound.

America has been one of the surprise packages of the tournament thus far and will be looking to further enhance their burgeoning reputation against a Proteas team which has won all of their games but not been particularly convincing.

“We’ve worked for the last five years and are getting the rewards right now on this big stage, and people are recognizing us. That's so satisfying to see that finally we are getting this kind of reward for something which we have done for the past five years,” said United States captain Monank Patel.

South African skipper Aidan Markram, meanwhile, is looking forward to the “business end” of the tournament: “It is the dream [to lift the trophy], 100%. You take it game by game and you compete as hard and as best as you can. And you ultimately see where it gets you.

“But I’m looking forward to that phase now of the competition. Really grateful that we are in the Super 8s and hoping that we can put a more complete game of cricket together now that we move forward to the business end of the competition.”
