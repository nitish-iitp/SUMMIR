        "USA will want to take down another Full Member nation in what is likely to be their last game at the World Cup",
        "If USA loses, they could still squeak into the semi-finals, but the odds are very much against them",
        "This will be their first cricketing encounter of the modern age",
        "England have endured a choppy campaign so far, winning three and losing two to go with a no result in their opening match at Kensington Oval",
        "A convincing performance will go a long way to ensuring their title defence continues into the knockouts",
        "Victory will put them on four points, and a margin of more than ten runs (batting first) will ensure their net run-rate goes above that of South Africa",
        "England have rarely been at their best over the last three weeks in the Caribbean but there have been signs that their game is coming together at the right time",
        "Aaron Jones' six over midwicket to seal a rousing opening-night win over Canada was the shot that was heard around the World Cup",
        "An innings of 33 off 17 balls in a losing cause might not sound much, but could it turn out to be the spark Liam Livingstone needed",
        "USA have been without Monank since their group-stage win over Pakistan, but head coach Stuart Law suggested he was close to returning from a shoulder injury",
        "England may be unchanged for the third match running, having apparently settled on Jonny Bairstow at No. 3 and Sam Curran as the extra bowling/left-hand batter option",
        "Sam Curran needs one more wicket to reach 50 in T20Is"
