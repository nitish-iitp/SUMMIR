        "Heinrich Klaasen’s superb 81 off 46 balls laced with seven fours and five sixes made it a walk in the park for the Proteas as they knocked off the runs in 18.2 overs despite Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s fantastic figures of 4 for 13."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Captains corner!",
        "Rishabh Pant: We would have bowled first as well. The track is really nice. We would want to have a big score on this. There weren't many things we did wrong in the last game, just a bit of execution was off and we will do better today. We are playing the same team.",
        "Temba Bavuma: We will have a bowl first. We don't know how the wicket will play. It was easier to bat second in the last game. You can chase anything with smaller boundaries. You need to stay in the fight as batters. We have two forced changes; QDK has a hand injury and Stubbs misses out, Klaasen and Hendricks come in."
