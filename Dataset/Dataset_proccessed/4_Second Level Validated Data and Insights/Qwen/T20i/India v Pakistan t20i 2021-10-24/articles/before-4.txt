Can Babar Azam Put Down The Indian Super Challenge?

The T20 world cup has just begun. Amongst the series of matches that will be played in this tournament, the one between India and Pakistan, is the most awaited. The contest between the two archrivals draws so many emotions from both sides of the border, and sometimes it seems more than just cricket, say observers.

Will you manage your emotions today? Read Daily Horoscope Predictions.

Well, as per the reports, the Pakistan cricket team’s captain, Babar Azam is receiving phone calls wherein he is being pressured to win the match against India ‘at all costs’. The India-Pakistan match will be played on Oct 24, 2021, at Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Azam was born on Oct 15, 1994, in Lahore, Pakistan. His solar chart shows that Venus and Saturn are in their own respective signs. This is strengthening his destiny. Saturn propels him to work hard and Venus renders him with fame. At the same time, there is Chandal dosh in his solar chart. In the coming future, his personal performance will be quite good. Presently, Jupiter is transiting positively over his natal Moon and Saturn, which bodes well for Azam.

Know your future in 2023.
