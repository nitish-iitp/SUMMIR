        "Zimbabwe needs 4 runs in 1 ball. No Ball and Free hit.",
        "ZIM 111/5 after 17 overs: Zimbabwe has managed to drag the game deep with Williams nearing a half-century and they now required 40 off 18 balls. It’s not an impossible task but Williams needs to attack and get the most in the coming couple of overs to give his team a chance to go for the target in the final over.",
        "ZIM 95/5 after 15 overs: Ryan Burl and Sean Williams have resisted the Bangladesh attack and have forged a partnership but Bangladesh bowlers have kept a lid on the scoring. The required rate is almost 12 while the current rate is at 6.33 and someone has to a play a blinder of a knock to get Zimbabwe home. Zimbabwe needs 54 in 30 balls.",
        "ZIM 69/5 after 12 overs: The move to bring back Taskin Ahmed has worked and the fast bowler packs off Chakabva to leave Zimbabwe five down. Good length delivery just outside off and Chakabva gets an under edge as Narul Hasan makes no mistake behind the stumps.",
        "ZIM 64/4 after 10 overs: Sean Williams and Regis Chakabva are doing the rebuilding work but Bangladesh is very much in control of the proceedings. In the last five overs, 33 runs are scored for the loss of two wickets and the key for Zimbabwe is to the take the game deep and keep this partnership going.",
        "ZIM 36/4 after 6 overs: Bangladesh is firmly on top and has taken the match under its control as Sikandar Raza falls for a duck, handing Mustafizur his second wicket. Shakib lifted his side with an excellent catch at mid-off and then the lanky pacer had Raza to put Bangladesh in the driver’s seat. It will take a mammoth effort from the rest of the Zimbabwe batsmen to overhaul the target, or even come close to it. Bangladesh bossing at the moment.",
        "BAN 24/2 after 4 overs: Taskin strikes again and this time the Zimbabwe skipper throws his wicket away by chasing a wide one. A full delivery, pitching well outside the off, Ervine chases and gets an outside edge. Zimbabwe two down and that’s a bit of struggle. Bangladesh doing exactly what their bowling coach ordered - pick wickets.",
        "ZIM 12/1 after 2 overs: Taskin Ahmed strikes early ad he removes Madhevere who throws away his wicket. The batsman played a gorgeous shot through the covers to get the run chase underway but then chases a wide delivery only to get a top edge as Mustafizur takes an easy catch at third man. Milton Shumba joins Craig Ervine and Zimbabwe needs to string a partnership.",
        "BAN 150/7 in 20 overs: Bangladesh scored 87 runs in the last 10 overs but the last five overs saw them lose four wickets as Zimbabwe pulled back things. Najmul Shanto was the star of the Bangladesh batting with a solid 55-ball 71, scoring his first international half-century to propel his team to a fighting total. Zimbabwe was poor with their fielding and will look to improve in that area immensely after dropping sitters. But right now, it’s over to their batsmen who will look to overhaul the target.",
        "BAN 127/4 after 17 overs: Sikandar Raza comes back into the attack and removes the dangerous Shanto who falls after smashing a brilliant 55-ball 71 but that’s a timely strike from Zimbabwe’s point of view. The batsman went after a slower delivery only to be caught at the extra cover region. The last five overs, 41 runs have been scored and two wickets have fallen. Zimbabwe pulling things at the death.",
        "BAN 95/3 after 14 overs: When was the last time you saw a left-arm orthodox spinner bowling to a left-hander and dismiss him! Well, Sean Williams has done that and has provided Zimbabwe with an important breakthrough with the wicket of Shakib Al Hasan. Slower through the air, Shakib goes for a booming slog-sweep but gets a top edge as Muzarabani gets underneath the ball and takes an excellent catch. Meanwhile, Najmul Shanto has scored his first international half-century.",
        "BAN 85/2 after 12 overs: The boundaries are coming freely with both Najmul Shanto pressing on the accelerator with Shakib in company at the other end. The last five overs have yielded 46 runs without a wicket and the fifty-run partnership is up between the duo. Zimbabwe needs to apply brakes as the current run rate is over seven per over and it will only swell as Bangladesh with wickets in hand will eye for a flourish at the death. Crucial passage of play.",
        "BAN 59/2 after 9 overs: Spin from both ends with Sikandar Raza and Wesley Madhevere in operation. Shakib is looking a bit rusty and he was almost a goner in the very first ball he faced as his feet were firmly planted at the crease with the bat chasing a delivery close to the off stump. The Bangladesh skipper has managed to get a boundary and is slowly stitching a partnership with Najmul Shanto who seems to have dropped anchor. A wicket here will spice up things.",
        "BAN 32/2 after 6 overs: Blessing Muzarabani has picked his second wicket and that’s a poor shot from Litton Das. A premeditated shot that went completely wrong as Litton tried to play the lap shot against the fast bowler but ended up with a top edge and Chatara takes an excellent catch at the short third man by running to his left. Huge wicket and that brings skipper Shakib Al Hasan to the crease. Zimbabwe will be happy with the two wickets in PowerPlay.",
        "BAN 24/1 after 4 overs: Najmul Shanto has found some rhythm going and is riding on the bounce and pace on offer. The batsman is not going hard at the ball but rather relying on punches down the ground. Litton Das is off the blocks with an excellent drive through the covers as Bangladesh is up and running. Shanto received some medical attention after he suffered a hamstring strain.",
        "BAN 14/1 after 2 overs: Blessing Muzarabani has made an early breakthrough and has got the big wicket of Soumya Sarkar. Muzarabani gets the ball to move away from the batsman and it was a poor shot from Sarkar as he opened the face of the bat and tried to run it down but gets an outside edge as Chakabva takes a simple catch behind the stumps. Litton Das joins Najmul Shanto."
