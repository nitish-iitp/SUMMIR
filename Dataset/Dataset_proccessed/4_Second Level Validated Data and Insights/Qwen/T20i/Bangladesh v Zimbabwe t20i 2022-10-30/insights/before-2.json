        "Zimbabwe have grown to be a fighting side in the last few years, culminating in their ODI and T20I series wins over Bangladesh in July 2022.",
        "Zimbabwe are now one of the most talked-about teams, having just defeated pre-tournament favourites Pakistan by one run.",
        "Zimbabwe's form is as good as their fighting spirit, and the way they defended the 130 against Pakistan was proof.",
        "Bangladesh, meanwhile, are back in trouble in T20Is. After they beat Netherlands in their first game, there was hope that the fast-bowling unit could keep them afloat if the batting can come in support. But neither clicked against South Africa.",
        "Shakib Al Hasan's bowling form is a concern",
        "Zimbabwe are unlikely to tinker with their playing XI.",
        "Bangladesh may want to bring back Yasir Ali as batting insurance but then they'll have to get creative with their fifth-bowling option"
