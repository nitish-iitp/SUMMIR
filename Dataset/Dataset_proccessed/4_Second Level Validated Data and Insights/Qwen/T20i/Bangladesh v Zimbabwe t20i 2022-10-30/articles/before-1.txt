Bangladesh will be up against Zimbabwe on Sunday, October 30th at The Gabba, Brisbane after being thrashed by South Africa by 104 runs.

Bangladesh is in the fourth position in Group 2 with one win and one loss. The batsmen have disappointed in the tournament.

Apart from Taskin, Mosaddek Hossain, Afif Hossain, and Mehndi Hasan Miraj have also scored runs with an economy of more than 10.

Zimbabwe is going to take the field against Bangladesh after registering a blistering win over Pakistan by one run. 

Sikandar Raza has been the show-down man for the team and has performed remarkably well with both bat and ball. Raza has scored 145 runs in 5 matches. 

On the other hand, Wesley Madhevere has added 101 runs, and Craig Ervine has scored 88 runs in 4 matches. The rest of the batters have given mixed performances.

Sikandar Raza has taken 8 wickets in the tournament and is the leading wicket-taker for Zimbabwe. He took 3 wickets against Pakistan in the last match.

Blessing Mujarbani has taken 7 wickets, and Tendai Chatara and Richard Nagarwa took 4 wickets each.
