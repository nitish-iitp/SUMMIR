Not too much sink-in time as Netherlands vs Pakistan takes off in Perth. But this was a thought experiment of a game that gave imagination a run for its money. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we did, bringing it to you.

Taskin Ahmed, POTM: (He's heaving in big breaths with a mix of excitement and exhaustion) We all were nervous. It was a very good match, it wasn't very easy for us. It was the first time I saw something like that (no ball) Focusing on my process, and this was the result of that. The pitches back home are slow, here we are getting early movement and help. So everything is going well. We have a good fast-bowling bunch and are working on improving. Allan Donald and other support staff are helping us. Hopefully we'll improve further.

Azhar: "Wasn't the last ball a free hit?? Whats the rule exactly?" It was a no ball and indeed a free hit, that's the rule.

Rahul Pai : "So those 6 extra runs scored by Afif after the drop were crucial in the end and might have proven to be the difference between the two sides "

4:38pm: Cheers, Shashank. An(other) unimaginably close game, Zimbabwe will be dejected but the fact that they came back and not be flattened in the powerplay. For Bangladesh, the glory comes with (many) a sigh of relief. Taskin was brilliant, Mustafizur Rahman made immediate impact. Zimbabwe were 35 for 4 off 5.2 overs. Sean Williams superglued the innings and took off, got support from Regis Chakabva and Ryan Burl. Bangladesh's bowling was good but couldn't break through. Shakib looked to force the issue by bowling out The Fizz and Taskin early. The spinners were left with 40 off three overs. Williams got away but his run out was massive, Ngarava hit a six then got out, Muzarabani missed out the first ball, got away with a no-ball because the keeper's gloves were in front of the stumps. What?! He couldn't connect on the second. Mosaddek, the last-over hero, mixed up his pace and lengths, reacted to trigger movements, kept non-striker in check, and eventually won it for Bangladesh.

Mosaddek to Muzarabani, no run

He's missed it. Oh, yes. Bangladesh can celebrate now. Muzarabani had a big swing at that as Mosaddek fired this full and across. Disappointment and dejection in the Zimbabwe camp, ecstasy in the Bangladesh camp. Not for the first time, did they start celebrating early, but here they came out and ensured the job was down again. Oh, well, what a finish, what a game. Relief for Bangladesh. Imagine if this went to the boundary, imagine the nightmares Nurul may have had if this had turned against them because of that one error? The Bangladesh flags can flutter. What a game we've had. Outstanding stuff, terrific scenes. The Tigers in the crowd have lost their voice, the traveling Castle Corner can't contain their tears. Zimbabwe will look back at this one as the one that got away.

See all photos

Zimbabwe need 4 to win, 3 to force a super over. Muzarabani who may have yanked his gloves out has to put it back on and come out. Where does he target? Acres of open space at the Gabba, so a 3 can't one ruled out

All the players have gone out. Bangladesh were celebrating, but were obviously unaware of what they'd just done. Zimbabwe have another lease of life. Oh, gosh. What excitement, what drama! Unbelievable scenes here at The Gabba.

Mosaddek to Muzarabani, (no ball)

Swings and misses. Bangladesh squeeze a crucial, crucial win.Heartbreak for Zimbabwe. Mosaddek the hero as Bangladesh defend 15. Massive, massive celebrations in the Bangladesh camp even as the third umpire has a look to check if Nurul collected the ball in front of the stumps. If he has, this will be a no-ball and we will need to replay the delivery. But Bangladesh seem so confident that they're walking off in jubilation. NOT OUT, PUT THE STUMPS BACK ON! ZIMBABWE HAVE A FREE HIT.

Six needed for a win. Four to force a super over. Muzarabani has a chance to be a hero for Zimbabwe. Can he do it?

Mosaddek to Ngarava, OUT

Got him! Nurul smashes the stumps down and roars in jubilation. Ngarava charges down the pitch but doesn't get to the pitch, goes through and misses it completely. Simplest of stumping for the keeper.

Mosaddek to Ngarava, SIX runs

Oh my word! He has just hammered that over the ropes at deep fine leg. This was short and sliding down, almost a free swing for Ngarava and he gets enough wood on that as this sails over. What a hit, unbelieveable stuff!

4lb
Mosaddek to Ngarava, 4 leg byes

Runs away for four! Leg byes, how lucky is that? Extra bounce as Mosaddek bowls this into the pitch, Ngavara swings and misses, the ball hits his shoulder and deflects away

W
Mosaddek to Evans, OUT

Muscled, absolutely muscled. It may have been six in Harare or Bulawayo, maybe even in Mirpur. But hey this is The Gabba. Biiiiiiiiig square boundary and although Evans absolutely muscled this off the middle of the bat, he found deep midwicket. Soumya Sarkar with the catch, ice-cool under pressure. It was that much tougher because the ball was hit into the shadows, it can be tricky but he made it look easy. Surely Bangladesh's game now?

Brad Evans c Afif Hossain b Mosaddek Hossain 2 (2b 0x4 0x6 5m) SR: 100

Mosaddek aborts in his delivery stride and flares at the non-striker, possibly because he thought he was leaving the crease early.

15 off 5

19.1
1lb
Mosaddek to Burl, 1 leg bye

Fired into the pads, Burl looks to heave this into the leg side but misses, they'll scamper a leg bye as the ball deflects to short third.

16 off six. Mosaddek to try and defend these runs.

Shakib to Williams, OUT

Shakib hits bulls eye! There's the twist. What athleticism! Pushed into the off side in the hope of scampering a single but Shakib is alert to the possibility and hares across, slides, turns around in a jiffy and nails a direct hit at the bowler's end. Outstanding work. Shakib was off balance as he threw but boy did he nail it or what?

Sean Williams run out (Shakib Al Hasan) 64 (42b 8x4 0x6 75m) SR: 152.38

Shakib to Williams, FOUR runs

Carved away for four! Backs away, Shakib follows him but Williams still manages to open up the off side and powers that hit into the gap at extra cover. Deep point thought he had a chance as he tried to run around the ropes, but he was a mere spectator despite the dive.

18.2
2
Shakib to Williams, 2 runs

Rocks back and pulls him into the gap at deep square, two more. He was shaping to slog sweep but because it was tossed up, he held his shape and decided to pull

Slaps this down to long-off

Hasan Mahmud to Williams, FOUR runs

Hammered for four! Backs away, Hasan follows him by banging on in, Williams is ready for it as he muscles this tennis shot wide of mid-on! Ah, we talk of that Virat Kohli six off Haris Rauf. This wasn't quite that level but trust me, it was equally difficult because the ball got big on him and Williams had committed himself to the pull, and had to quickly adjust. Clubbed that away in the end. The match is alive and how!

Hasan Mahmud to Williams, FOUR runs

What a hit! Backs away and scythes this Yorker-length delivery between cover and mid-off. This is superb improvisation

17.4

Hasan Mahmud to Burl, 1 run

Yorker-length on the pads, squeezed to midwicket off an inside edge

17.3

Hasan Mahmud to Williams, 1 run

Lucky to get away with that high full toss, swung away to deep midwicket. Williams gets his fifty off 37 balls, but there's plenty to do still.

17.2
2
Hasan Mahmud to Williams, 2 runs

Slashed away wide of cover, two is the call and two it will be. Williams got that off the toe-end, no timing but two more into the kitty. That's what matters. But they need a boundary soon, maybe two.

17.2
1w
Hasan Mahmud to Williams, 1 wide

Fired down leg as Williams steps out to flick, the keeper intercepts the ball with a full-length dive to his right, well done Sohan

17.1
1
Hasan Mahmud to Burl, 1 run

Right into the blockhole, Burl was way outside leg looking to flick but this was honing in to his toes, he can only get a thin inside edge onto the boot, they'll scamper a run.
