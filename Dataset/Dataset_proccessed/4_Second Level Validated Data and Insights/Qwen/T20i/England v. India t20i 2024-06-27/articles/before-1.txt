Semi-Final Preview: India eye revenge against defending champions England 
India versus England in a Men’s T20 World Cup semi-final – this is a game where more cricket history will be written.

The last time these two nations faced off in a Men’s T20 World Cup semi-final was just 19 months ago in Adelaide, when a remarkable opening partnership between Jos Buttler and Alex Hales saw England cruise to victory in the sort of manner that forced a complete rethink in India’s T20 strategy.

This time around, though, India have more batting firepower, more options through the middle overs, and more variation in their attack, but the defending champions will take some beating, especially with Buttler and his new opening partner Phil Salt both in blistering form.

England are two games away from becoming the first men’s team to retain a T20 World Cup.

India have not won this tournament since its inception back in 2007, and are searching for their first World Cup win in any format since 2011.

The Match Details

Match Centre and Scorecard

India v England, Thursday June 27 (10:30am local), Guyana National Stadium, Guyana

The Venue

The Guyana National Stadium is a 20,000-seater venue on the outskirts of Georgetown, situated just off the banks of the Demerara River and a few kilometres from the coast.

This is the sixth and final game to be held at the venue during the tournament, with the previous five all coming in Group C during the first-round stage. Spinners have been quite effective on the ground, but there’s also been a bit in the surface for the quicks, with the highest score across the five games being Afghanistan’s 183/5 against Uganda.

How They Got Here

India have won every game they’ve been able to compete in, with the only dropped points coming from the abandoned fixture against Canada at a rain-soaked Lauderhill.

Impressive wins over Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Australia secured their spot in the knockout stages as the winners of Group 1 in the Super Eight.

England, by contrast, have got here the hard way. A rained-off match against Scotland was followed by a loss to Australia right at the start of their campaign, leaving them needing huge wins and favours from elsewhere to reach the Super Eights. But they managed just that, qualifying ahead of Scotland on Net Run Rate.

And in the Super Eight, a loss to South Africa meant England were sweating somewhat, despite already having comfortably beaten hosts West Indies. That win, and the nature of it, proved important, giving them a significant Net Run Rate advantage that they boosted further with a hammering of the USA to effectively qualify with a game to spare. South Africa’s victory over West Indies consigned them to second spot in the group, sending them to this semi-final rather than being the top seed in semi-final 1.

Ruthless England booked a semi-final spot with a clinical performance against USA.

The Squads

India squad: Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd. Siraj.

England squad: Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonathan Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, Mark Wood

Team Selections

India named a settled side throughout their Super Eight campaign, having added Kuldeep Yadav in place of Mohammed Siraj from the team who dominated the Group Stage.

It is quite likely they will continue with that exact balance, given it offers six frontline bowling options, with three pacers and three spinners.

The only possible change, given the expected nature of the Guyana surface, is that Yuzvendra Chahal could be added for another spinning threat.

England moved away from the batting-heavy balance that they started the tournament with, leaving out Will Jacks and playing four front-line pace bowlers, with Sam Curran and Chris Jordan slotting in at seven and eight to avoid an excessively lengthy tail, and Mark Wood missing out.

There could be the option of bringing Jacks back as a part-time spin option, or even handing a debut to Tom Hartley who is in the squad as an additional main spinner.

But England do have Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone in their top six, both of whom have bowled well when called upon, so may opt to stick with the formula that got them through the Super Eight.
