        "The last time these two nations faced off in a Men’s T20 World Cup semi-final was just 19 months ago in Adelaide, when a remarkable opening partnership between Jos Buttler and Alex Hales saw England cruise to victory.",
        "India have more batting firepower, more options through the middle overs, and more variation in their attack.",
        "England are two games away from becoming the first men’s team to retain a T20 World Cup.",
        "India have not won this tournament since its inception back in 2007, and are searching for their first World Cup win in any format since 2011.",
        "England, by contrast, have got here the hard way. A rained-off match against Scotland was followed by a loss to Australia right at the start of their campaign, leaving them needing huge wins and favours from elsewhere to reach the Super Eights.",
        "India named a settled side throughout their Super Eight campaign, having added Kuldeep Yadav in place of Mohammed Siraj from the team who dominated the Group Stage.",
        "England moved away from the batting-heavy balance that they started the tournament with, leaving out Will Jacks and playing four front-line pace bowlers."

        "The Guyana National Stadium is a 20,000-seater venue on the outskirts of Georgetown, situated just off the banks of the Demerara River and a few kilometres from the coast.",
        "Spinners have been quite effective on the ground, but there’s also been a bit in the surface for the quicks, with the highest score across the five games being Afghanistan’s 183/5 against Uganda."
