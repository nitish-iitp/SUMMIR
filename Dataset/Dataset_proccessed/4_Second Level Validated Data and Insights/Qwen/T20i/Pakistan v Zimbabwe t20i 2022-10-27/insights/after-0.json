        "Brad Evans had 11 runs to defend of the last over and he conceded nine. His first delivery went for three, his second went for four and his third for one.",
        "Mohammad Nawaz tried to hit Evans over mid-off and found Craig Ervine. The Zimbabwean captain held on.",
        "Pakistan needed three of the last ball, Shaheen Shah Afridi tapped and ran, the fielder was in to prevent the second and did. Regis Chakabva ran Shaheen out as he tried to complete the run that would force the Super Over."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Zimbabwe won the toss and chose to bat.",
        "Zimbabwe's second-highest opening stand at a T20WC is 74 against England in 2007.",
        "Zimbabwe have made one change to the XI that took a point off South Africa but it's not the one you think. Richard Ngarava, who slipped and fell on the Hobart pitch, is fit. Tendai Chatara is out and Brad Evans gets a game."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Zimbabwe won by 1 run."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Sean Williams and Ryan Burl are keeping things quiet on the boundary front",
        "Wasim is playing his first match of the tournament and what a statement he's made. Fabulous changes of pace and he has picked up a career-best haul."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Pakistan started off a little too full, perhaps as a response to playing on the pitch with the most bounce in Australia (and perhaps even the world). But just looked what happened when they bowled a good length.",
        "Zimbabwe are falling apart. They've lost four wickets in the last six balls."
