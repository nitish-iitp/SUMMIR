        "Zimbabwe upset with having had to carry on in the conditions they did against South Africa, but no doubt relieved to have come away with a point.",
        "Pakistan, meanwhile, anguished at seeing two points slip away in that wild last over at the MCG against India.",
        "They may rue not picking a fourth pacer at the MCG, but Mohammad Nawaz was not far from winning it: a little luck with the deflection off the stumps on the free-hit, a little fortune with that no-ball call, and they're sitting pretty now.",
        "Zimbabwe will look at all this, however, and recognise a side that they have had the better of twice in white-ball cricket in the last two years.",
        "Under coach Dave Houghton, Zimbabwe have also started taking a more attacking approach. That has crystallised most vividly in the form of Sikandar Raza, arguably the player of the tournament so far.",
        "Zimbabwe's pace attack has served them well in the tournament so far, though none more than Blessing Muzarabani.",
        "Pakistan (probable): 1 Babar Azam (capt), 2 Mohammad Rizwan (wk), 3 Shan Masood, 4 Iftikhar Ahmed, 5 Haider Ali, 6 Shadab Khan, 7 Asif Ali, 8 Mohammad Nawaz, 9 Haris Rauf, 10 Shaheen Shah Afridi, 11 Naseem Shah",
        "Zimbabwe (probable): 1 Craig Ervine (capt), 2 Regis Chakabva (wk), 3 Sean Williams, 4 Sikandar Raza, 5 Wessly Madhevere, 6 Milton Shumba, 7 Ryan Burl, 8 Luke Jongwe, 9 Richard Ngarava/Brad Evans, 10 Tendai Chatara, 11 Blessing Muzarabani"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The forecast in Perth is for partly cloudy conditions but no rain.",
        "The pitch has a green tinge and the new ball has swung.",
        "While there's pace and bounce for the fast bowlers, runs can also be scored quickly, especially straight.",
        "Spinners often suffer if they bowl too full, but can tie it up in the middle overs by bowling a back of a length and forcing batters to hit to the vast square boundaries with the ground similar to the dimensions of the MCG."
