20:24 IST:
That's it from this game! A low-scoring thriller! The World Cup keeps on giving surprises. On 28th October, Afghanistan will take on Ireland at 9.30 am IST (4 am GMT) and later, England will face Australia at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT). Do join us for the build up. Cheers!
20:23 IST:
Craig Ervine, the skipper of Zimbabwe says it is a special win. They worked hard to get in this round. Says they felt 20-25 runs short at the start but they bowled brilliantly and applauds the performance of Raza. Ends by appreciating the support they are getting. 
20:23 IST:
Babar Azam, the captain of Pakistan says they should had definitely chased this down but are disappointed as they are not upto the mark with the bat. Adds he and Rizwan have responsibility but they got out. Reckons they need to use the new ball well. Shares that they are looking forward to the next match. 
20:19 IST:
Sikandar Raza is the Player of the Match. He says he is lost for words and is proud of these players. Adds it is unbelievable but they kept believing until the end. Ends by saying that he recieved a clip of Ricky Ponting in the morning and that gave him extra motivation. He would like to thank Ricky Ponting for that.

...Presentation coming up...
20:16 IST:
Earlier in the day, after being asked to field, courtesy Wasim, Rauf and Shadab, Pakistan kept Zimbabwe to a very low score. However, what we thought was an under par score proved to be enough as Zimbabwe fought till the very last ball and won the game by the slightest of margins.
20:15 IST:
What can be said about Pakistan batting! When you have names like Babar, Rizwan and Masood you have to chase 131 down but yet again they just invited pressure on themselves. They took a cautious approach and went about things slowly. They lost wickets in the process and that always kept Zimbabwe in the hunt. Masood played brilliantly, he held one end up but he fell at the wrong time. Nawaz down the order played really well but when it mattered, he could not provide the goods. Twice in a row, he has turned as a villain. This is really heart breaking loss for them.
20:13 IST:
What a bowling effort this was from them. Right from the word go, their bowlers made it extremely tough for their batters. Evans, Blessing Muzarabani and Richard Ngarava were brilliant with the new ball. Raza was exceptional in the middle overs. Whenever, the game seemed to be slipping away, they managed to grab a wicket. Despite all of it, this was still Pakistan's game to win but it is Zimbabwe who kept their nerve and have emerged victorious.
20:13 IST:
3 in 3 is what they needed! Forget that, 131 is what they needed to chase and they have failed to do so. Zimbabwe are on cloud 9, they are elated. What a massive win this is, one that will go down jn history. Zimbabwe are celebrating it with the fans. Absolutely wonderful.
20:08 IST:
What a win! What a win this is! Pakistan, what have you done? Twice in a row, they have lost games they should have won and this loss may have just seen their chances of getting ahead into the tournament dented big time.

...THE CHASE...
18:15 IST:
Right then! Not a big score and this should be an easy one for the Pakistani batters. Zimbabwe bowlers need to be sharp from the start. Stay tuned for the chase.
18:12 IST:
Shadab Khan is up for a chat. He says the catch was brilliant by Babar Azam, he has not been at his best in the field but he took a stunner. States he was varying the speed and the slower he bowled, it spun. Reckons they have a top bowling unit and they needed to restrict them to a low score.
18:10 IST:
For Zimbabwe, after the initial few overs, it was a struggle for all their batters. The problem for them was they kept losing wickets at regular intervals and at one time, they lost 4 for no runs at all. That killed all the hopes of them getting to a competitive total. At one stage even 120 looked far away but Evans and Burl have taken them above that and have given their bowlers something to bowl at.
18:10 IST:
That is a really good performance with the ball by Pakistan! Zimbabwe on the other hand will be very disappointed with the score they have on the board. Let me remind you, their openers were going at around 10 per over at the start. Once the first wicket fell, they kept losing wickets at regular intervals and the scoring rate also got down. Rauf was absolutely brilliant along with Shadab in the middle overs. Wasim was also very impressive in his return to the side. Naseem Shah had a day off. Shaheen on the other hand, continues to try to get back to his best.
