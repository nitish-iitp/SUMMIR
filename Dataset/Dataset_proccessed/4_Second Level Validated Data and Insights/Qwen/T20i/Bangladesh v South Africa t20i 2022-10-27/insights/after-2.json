        "A 163-run stand between Rossouw and de Kock set South Africa up for a big first-innings total",
        "Anrich Nortje completed what he had started, ending with 4 for 10",
        "Shamsi too capitalised on the mountain of a score - courtesy Rossouw's career-best 109 - to get a confidence-boosting 3 for 20",

        "Bavuma did exactly the right thing in giving enough play to the spinners as well in this sort of a game to find the necessary rhythm under the conditions and get cracking for the matches ahead"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "So South Africa not only win big, but also will be table toppers at least for a short while. They hold a huge net run rate at the moment - remember they couldn't make the semi-final last year just due to the NRR? - and might well have made up for the washout against Zimbabwe",
        "Rilee Rossouw is the Player of the Match for his 109"

        "Rain delays led to the game being postponed until the next day"
