Pakistan stay alive!

Pakistan have kept their semi-final hopes alive with victory in a rain-reduced, much-win match over their favourite opponents: South Africa. They’ve met four times at T20 World Cups and Pakistan have won all four encounters. Pakistan have also emerged victorious from six of their last nine World Cup meetings against South Africa - including two fifty-over World Cup wins.

On a chilly Sydney evening, against the express pace of Anrich Nortje and the craftiness of Lungi Ngidi’s slower ball, Pakistan recovered from 95 for 5 to post their fifth-highest score against South Africa, and highest at World Cups. While their top-order failed to fire once again, Iftikhar Ahmed and then Shadab Khan scored half-centuries apiece to get Pakistan to a competitive score. They were helped by a sloppy South African fielding performance. They dropped five catches - more than they have in the other three matches in the tournament combined - and there were several fumbles on a slippery outfield.

Pakistan were set up with the bat, but won the match with the ball. Shaheen Shah Afridi dismissed Quinton de Kock and Rilee Rossouw cheaply but Temba Bavuma had his best innings of 2022 and the chase was going well until the start of the eighth over. South Africa were 65 for 2, ahead of the DLS par of 58 at the time, when Shadab Khan found Bavuma’s edge. At the fall of the wicket, the DLS par went up to 66 and it had increased to 77 two balls later, when Aiden Markam was dismissed. By the time play was interrupted after nine overs, South Africa needed to be on 85 to win, but were 69 for four.

An hour’s interruption cut six overs off the chase and when play resumed South Africa needed 75 runs off the remaining five overs. Tristan Stubbs and Heinrich Klaasen biffed it around a bit but the ask was always going to be too tall. South Africa remain second on the points’ table and need to beat Netherlands on Sunday to keep their fate in their own hands.

We'll catch up then! Enjoy tomorrow and Saturday's Group 1 finales.

Pakistan closing in on the win

Oh, it's very nearly time to fly this. Naseem Shah has delivered a fantastic death over laced with slower balls. He has got rid of the last batter in the line-up, Tristan Stubbs, and opened up the tail. Pakistan are almost home.

Wasim v Wayne

South Africa's last recognised middle-order hitter (sorry KG) has been dismissed. Wayne Parnell tried to get cute with the paddle but missed and was hit on the pads by Mohammad Wasim. He reviewed, probably more in hope than anything else, and Pakistan might, might, might start thinking that this is just about done. This is what's left:

Afridi gets Klaasen

Heinrich Klaasen went leg side against Shaheen Shah, flicking him for four, and then off-side. But he wanted too much and tried to flick Afridi over fine leg, top-edged high into the Sydney sky and Mohammad Wasim has completed the catch. The Klaasen-Stubbs partnership was worth 28 runs off 20 balls and oozed confidence, which will now swing to Pakistan. And Afridi is truly back. He finishes with 3 for 14.

10.40pm restart, 14 overs

South Africa have lost six overs in a rain delay of just about an hour. They will face five more, for a total of 14. And if its a 14-over game, our stats whizzes tell me South Africa will need 142 to win.

So that means they need: 73 runs in the last five overs.

Heinrich Klaasen is playing his first match in the tournament. Tristan Stubbs has not come good yet. This is going to be interesting.

At 10.12 local time

The players went off at 9.42pm in Sydney. We're more than half-an-hour from that and that's when we start losing overs. But it's looking like we could be on fairly soon. The covers are off, the umpires are lurking and the rope is going around the outfield.

Hello spin, South Africa's old-friend

Mohammad Nawzaz has been brought on to bowl to South Africa's right-handers and he has delivered an over that cost just two runs. This is excellent from Babar to keep South Africa quiet at a crucial time, as the rain falls harder and it looks like DLS will come into play. And they are indeed off now.

The DLS par is 84. South Africa are 69 for 4.

Shadab strikes

We put the mockers on Bavuma!

Nevermind if Shadab can hold the ball in the rain, all he had to do was deliver a decent legbreak and Bavuma has edged behind. He opened the face to guide the ball to third but there's turn and bounce on offer and all Bavuma could manage was a nick.

And he has removed Aiden Markram too. In just three balls, Shadab has made an impact and bowled Markram with a topspinner. There's a massive amount of work for Heinrich Klaasen to do now.

And yes, you've read that right. Bavuma has his highest score of the tournament so far. He has played some sublime shots including a pull and an uppercut off Rauf and taken a run so risky he should have been run-out at the non-striker's end.

All or nothing - Rossouw

His last six T20I innings. A milestone or 0. But wait... Rossouw's pattern has changed. Afridi has got another! Rossouw got off the mark with a six - which might have meant Pakistan were in trouble - but then he top-edged a short, wide, hit-me ball to deep third. Rossouw was dismissed for 7. And that's also Afridi's 50th T20I wicket.

Afridi strikes!

Quinton de Kock has been dismissed for a duck and now, it's all eyes on Temba Bavuma. De Kock never really looked comfortable and was eyeing the area over mid-wicket throughout the opening over. He eventually toe-ended the ball to Mohammad Haris on the ring, who took a good catch to cap off an impressive debut.

The average first innings score here is 188 so this is just about on-par.

Pakistan smashed 90 runs off the last seven overs and the lost four wickets for nine runs at the end. They'll be pretty happy with that.

Team hat-trick

South Africa have been sloppy in the field tonight but they've come good. Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma and Rilee Rossouw have held on catches for three balls in a row. Shadab Khan was dropped by Aiden Markram at long-on but then Stubbs got under a skier at deep mid-wicket as Shadab decided the aerial route was the only option. Then, Mohammad Wasim top-edged Anrich Nortje, and Temba Bavuma zooted in from the ring. And in the next over, Iftikhar decided to take on Rabada against at the end hit him to long-on where Rilee Rossouw took a superb catch.

Shamsi's spell

You'll remember that Keshav Maharaj was swapped out for this match with Shamsi as the sole spinner today. He may not be entirely pleased with that. He conceded at nine runs to the over and Shadab Khan really got hold of his final over. It went for 15.

50 partnership but Nawaz goes - should he have?

Pakistan found some stability through Iftikhar Ahmed and Mohammad Nawaz, who put on 52 in 38 balls, before Nawaz was dismissed against the run of play. He had just found the leg-side boundary he'd been looking for with a slog sweep for six, and wanted to try the shot again but missed and was struck on the front pad. Nawaz was given out, and didn't review. Replays showed he got a bottom-edge. But Nawaz may have thought he was run-out because while the decision was being made, he'd set off for a single and Lungi Ngidi hit the stumps. Of course, as soon as the umpire's finger went up the ball was dead. So Nawaz would likely have survived the review.

Law 20.1.1.3 confirms that the ball is dead when: "a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the dismissal."

Rabada in T20Is

Here's some numbers on Kagiso Rabada, who we've just been discussing isn't quite having the impact he might have hoped he would. Since 2020, Rabada's economy rate in T20I is the 10th worst. And of the nine bowlers above him, only two take wickets less often than he does.

Ruthless against Rabada

First it was Haris, and now Iftikhar Ahmed has got hold of Kagiso Rabada, who isn't having his best day with the ball. He lines and lengths are letting him down and he offered a wide delivery for Igtikhar to cut and then overpitched to invite the drive over mid-off. Rabada's three overs have cost 36 runs so far, and remember, he only has one wicket in the tournament.

Pakistan's Powerplay?

It's Pakistan's highest-score in the Powerplay in the tournament so far, but difficult to say if they'll be happy with it. Their top three have been nipped out and South Africa's attack are using a combination of slower balls (Ngidi) and firepower (Nortje) to get on top of things.

Haris' hit out

It was fun while it lasted but the Haris shuffle has cost him. He moved across again, and missed a zippy Anrich Nortje delivery on fourth stump. He hoped his movement would save him but Haris was hit in line with offstump and ball-tracking showed it was going on to hit.

How slow can you go?

After Pakistan's speedy start, Lungi Ngidi has literally slowed them down with his change-ups. His regular deliveries are around the upper 130s/early 140s and here's how slow he can go:

Hello Haris!

He has only just become part of Pakistan's squad, after replacing Fakhar Zaman, and had to bat in the first over but hello, where has Haris been? He tucked into Kagiso Rabada and ensured South Africa had their most expensive over of the tournament and it looked like this:

Trouble at the top

16, 13, 1 and 4.

That's Pakistan's opening stands this tournament.

Wayne Parnell has got the breakthrough in the opening over. Pakistan struggle against the hard lengths and Parnell cramped Rizwan for room, so as he tried to open the face and guide the ball to third man, he chopped it on to his stumps.

Pakistan chose to bat

Temba Bavuma has called incorrectly again and Babar Azam decides to bat. "The pitch looks decent," he says. And Mohammad Haris is a straight swap for Fakhar Zaman in the XI.

Bavuma also wanted to bat first, on what he says looks like a dry surface. "We'll have to restrict them to a good total and try and chase it down." Bavuma is also not running away from his own struggles. "The form is not there," he says. "I have got a great bunch of guys so in terms of support, the confidence is there. I still believe good things are coming."

South Africa have two changes to their XI. David Miller has been ruled out of the match as a precautionary measure due to lower back muscle spasm so Heinrich Klaasen plays, while Tabraiz Shamsi has been preferred over Keshav Maharaj.

South Africa: : 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Temba Bavuma, 3 Rilee Rossouw, 4 Aiden Markram, 5 Heinrich Klaasen, 6 Tristan Stubbs 7 Wayne Parnell, 8 Anrich Nortje 9 Tabraiz Shamsi, 10 Lungi Ngidi, 11 Kagiso Rabada

Pakistan: 1 Mohammad Rizwan (wk), 2 Babar Azam, 3 Shan Masood, 4 Mohammad Haris, 5 Iftikhar Ahmed, 6 Shadab Khan, 7 Mohammed Nawaz, 8 Mohammed Wasim, 9 Shaheen Shah Afridi, 10 Haris Rauf, 11 Naseem Shah

Battle of the pacers

We're expecting this to be a battle of the quick bowlers, with both sides boasting a powerful pace pack. Andrew McGlashan is our man on the ground and he has this update:

"Ngidi has the paint brush out marking his run which suggests he plays. He missed out here against Bangladesh when South Africa played Shamsi as the second spinner."

South Africa one step away

Hello, hello. How's this World Cup? What a game yesterday between Bangladesh and India, and it was very nearly Bangladesh who topped the group. South Africa have that opportunity now as they take on a desperate Pakistan, who must-win to keep their semi-final hopes alive. Their advantage? They've beaten South Africa in their last FIVE major tournament meetings, including all three T20 World Cup clashes. And they have the bulk of the local fan base.

The big news is that Fakhar Zaman has been ruled out of the match with a recurrence of the knee injury he carried into the tournament and replaced by Mohammad Haris, which means there will be a change to Pakistan's line-up. But will they separate Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan at the top? The pair need to score a little quicker, much like South Africa's captain Temba Bavuma (to be fair, he just needs to score some runs for a start) so there's a lot of context to this clash.

While we wait for the toss, have a read of the preview.
