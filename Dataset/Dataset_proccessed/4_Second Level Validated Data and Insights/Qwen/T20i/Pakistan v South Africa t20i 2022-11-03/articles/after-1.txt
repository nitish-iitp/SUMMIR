In Short
South Africa were 16 runs behind the DLS par score at the end of the 9th over
South Africa's chase of 186 was interrupted by rain in Sydney
Shadab Khan hit a 22-ball 52 and picked up 2 wickets

Much like Wednesday in Adelaide when rain interrupted a thrilling match between India and Bangladesh, drizzle in Sydney halted South Africa's chase of 186 against Pakistan in their T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 match. The Duckworth Lewis Stern calculations once again came into the spotlight as the players from both sides and the fans at a packed Sydney Cricket Ground were waiting for the match to resume.

Notably, rain fell even during the closing stages of the Pakistan innings but the umpires decided to carry on and complete the 20 overs as its intensity was not high. However, there was a steady shower when rain returned during South Africa's chase.

South Africa were 69 for 4 at the end of 9 overs, 16 runs behind the DLS par score of 85 at that stage of the match. The Proteas were in danger of facing their first defeat of T20 World Cup 2022 as Shaheen Afridi and Shadab Khan dented their chase with 2 wickets each.

Eventually, the rain relented and South Africa needed 142 runs in 14 overs in the curtailed match.

Pakistan vs South Africa, T20 World Cup match: Updates

Pakistan posted 185 on the board in 20 overs on a slippery day in Sydney even after losing captain Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan early.

South Africa lost opener Quinton de Kock (0) and Rilee Rossouw (7) after a wonderful new-ball spell from Shaheen Afridi. However, Temba Bavuma showed signs of return to form with a stunning 36 from 19 balls, taking the attack to Pakistan's key pacer Haris Rauf. He got good support from Aiden Markram (20 off 14) but Shadab Khan turned things around in the 8th over with two wickets of the two set batters.

Shadab was having a dream day as he had hit the second-fastest fifty by a Pakistan batter in T20I cricket -- 50 off just 20 balls before picking up the crucial wickets of Bavuma and Markram in the same over.

The Super 12 match will see a reduction in overs if the rain doesn't relent 30 minutes after the break in play.

DLS TARGET CALCULATIONS: PAKISTAN VS SOUTH AFRICA

173 in 18 overs

151 in 15 overs

142 in 14 overs

132 in 13 overs

98 in 10 overs

South Africa have already been impacted by rain in the tournament as wet weather robbed them of 2 points in their Super 12 match against Zimbabwe in Hobart on October 24. South Africa were going great guns in their chase of 64 in a 5-overs-per-side match, reaching 51 in just 3 overs but rain forced abandonment as the two teams shared the points.

South Africa are at the 2nd spot in the Group 2 Super 12 points table while Pakistan, who are at the 4th spot, need nothing less than a win on Thursday to keep their outside chances of reaching the semi-finals alive.
