        "A brief rain shower delayed the start of play by 30 minutes",
        "A second and heavier rain delay brought the match to a halt with Scotland 51/0 after 6.2 overs",
        "A third rain delay, after Scotland had reached 90/0 from their ten overs, meant that the match was called off with no result possible",
        "The game had been reduced to a 10-over contest upon its resumption",
        "One expensive Adil Rashid over aside, England did well to keep a tricky mini-session under control as Scotland finished on 90/0 after ten overs"
