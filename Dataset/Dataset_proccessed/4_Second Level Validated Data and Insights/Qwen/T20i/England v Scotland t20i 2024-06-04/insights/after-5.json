        "Scotland captain Richie Berrington: 'Everyone's frustrated, but some positives to take at least. The guys in the middle did a really good job and we can take things from that. We gave ourselves a chance there. It would have been interesting to see how the weather affected the pitch because it did look like uneven bounce. If we had bowled and fielded well, we had an opportunity there. The openers are a really good combination up the top. George Munsey has slightly different skills and it was good to see him bring them out today.'",
        "England captain Jos Buttler: 'We expected a tough challenge, there are no easy games, but we were confident coming into the game. It's disappointment for everyone. There were a couple of balls here and there we'd want to tighten up on, but we scrapped hard and we were confident of chasing that score down. No-ball wickets are always disappointing, but these things happen. We just wanted to have a full game, but that's the situation we find ourselves in. Hopefully we get a dry day and we can get into the tournament.'",
        "Nikhil Uttamchandani: 'This group is now wide open. Teams will be on the notice that there are no easy games in this World Cup. If Australia beat England, there's a great opportunity for Scotland to finish in second place.'"
