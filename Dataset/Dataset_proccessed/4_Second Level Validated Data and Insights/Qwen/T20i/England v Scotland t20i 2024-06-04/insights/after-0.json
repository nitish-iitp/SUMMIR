        "Michael Jones swung Chris Jordan for an 87-metre six which smashed a solar panel on the roof of the stand beyond deep midwicket.",
        "Jones and Munsey added just two more runs, however, before more rain arrived and halted play for the best part of two hours.",
        "Munsey thrashed the second ball of his next over the fence at backward square for six.",
        "Jones pulled the last ball through midwicket for four to take his side to 90 without loss."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "It wasn't a chanceless innings after the restart with Munsey surviving an England review for caught behind off a googly in Rashid's first over and Jones making his ground despite his bat sticking in the pitch as he ran over the crease to beat a direct hit when the Scotland duo took a second run off Jordan's last ball."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "An untimely rain squall, followed by a damp spot on the pitch, delayed the start by 55 minutes after Scotland had won the toss and opted to bat.",
        "A much heavier storm arrived to halt proceedings again just two balls after the powerplay.",
        "By the time the skies cleared and the ground was mopped up sufficiently, the match had been reduced to 10 overs per side."
