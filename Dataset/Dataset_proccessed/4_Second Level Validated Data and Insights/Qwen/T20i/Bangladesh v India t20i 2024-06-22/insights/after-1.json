        "‘We know what is expected of us and what we need to do and how we need to play,’ the India captain said at the post-match ceremony.",
        "‘We adapted to the conditions – there is a small factor here in that -and then be smart.’",
        "‘All batters need to play their role. We saw only one guy got fifty and we still got 195. How you put pressure on the opposition is what matters. All the batters did that from the word go.’",
        "‘We have to understand conditions as well, but there is a lot of experience in that squad and we back them to make those decisions on the field.’",
        "‘The way Hardik batted was excellent but the way we batted to put us in a very good state to set the platform to finish that game was brilliant.’",
        "‘We played really good cricket. More than anything we stuck together and executed our plans.’",
        "‘For me, I’ve always been very fortunate to play for the country. It was a freak injury in the [2023] Cricket World Cup, I did try to come back but I’ve been putting in the hard work to get the opportunities for luck to come my way.’",
        "‘Luck comes to people who work hard. It doesn’t come to people who sit at home.’"
