        "Zimbabwe have some claim to being noisy neighbours, determined to cause an upset, even if their last decade has been quiet.",
        "Cricket South Africa have previously been banned by their sports minister from bidding for or hosting major events as punishment for the slow pace of transformation and had a board directive to collectively take a knee imposed on them at last year's tournament.",
        "The T20 World Cup presents an opportunity for both teams to demonstrate a turning of the page, so to speak. For South Africa, it's their last event under coach Mark Boucher, who will leave to take charge of Mumbai Indians, and therefore a culmination of his work with the squad. Anything less than advancement to the knockouts will not be received well at home.",
        "For Zimbabwe, it's their first major tournament under coach Dave Houghton, who has brought back the element of fun and given the players freedom to play without fearing the consequences of making mistakes. He has tasked them with 'doing some damage,' in the Super 12s, while being realistic of their chances of progression to the knockouts.",
        "There's no one under more scrutiny in the South Africa XI than their captain Temba Bavuma, who has scored just 11 runs in four international innings since returning from an elbow injury that sidelined him for three months.",
        "Sikandar Raza has emerged as a superstar and now he has an opportunity to do it against some of the best teams in the world. This year, Raza has scored 652 T20I runs at an average of 40.75, including five fifties, and taken 20 wickets at 17.35.",
        "Regis Chakabva's form (scores of 0, 13 and 4 from the opening round) could be a concern for Zimbabwe, but his experience is likely to see him keep his place in the Super 12s opener."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "It doesn't have quite the same hype as the Trans-Tasman or subcontinent derbies, but the meeting of two southern African neighbours has all the makings of a classic match-up.",
        "There's something for the seamers and spinners, and scores of around 160 are fairly competitive at this venue.",
        "But that's only if a full 20 overs are possible. It's cold and rainy in Hobart for most of this week, which does not bode well for the late match on Monday. The rain forecast of 20% through most of the day increases to 70% by 5pm and 80% by 8pm and the chances of a reduced match are in the offing."
