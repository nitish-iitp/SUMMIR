        "There's also no room for Reeza Hendricks, with Bavuma resuming at the top of the order",
        "Tristan Stubbs has been preferred over Heinrich Klaasen and Wayne Parnell is the left-arm allround option ahead of Marco Jansen",
        "Quinton de Kock blasted an 18-ball 47, with eight fours and a six and hoghed strike but it was not enough to get them over the line"

    "Others": [
        "This is a severely reduced match but at least there's some cricket",
        "The first round teams spoke about Test match lengths as being the key to success on this surface and just look at Lungi Ngidi's first over",
        "A nine-over innings can only be approached in one way: swing. And that's what Zimbabwe did. Or at least tried to do",
        "Regis Chakabva is still searching for his touch after scores of 0, 13 and 4 in the opening round and was tentative against Kagiso Rabada",
        "Zimbabwe sent in Sikandar Raza early but he could not continue his stunning run",
        "South Africa have some history with rain-affected games, but in case you needed reminding of the times when they've been washed out of World Cups, here we go",
        "The start of this match has already been delayed by more than an hour",
        "The ICC's playing conditions have allocated 1 hour and 25 minutes per innings and a total match time of 190 minutes (two innings of 85 minutes each plus a 20-minute interval)"
