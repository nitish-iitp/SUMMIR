        "Glenn Phillips said, 'I think it's probably going to be at the top. I do have one other 100, and that was pretty special as well, but to be able to do it on a World Cup stage just adds a little bit more juice to it, which is kind of cool.'"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Phillips reached the boundary 14 times in the knock, with ten fours and a quartet of maximums.",
        "40 of his runs came running between the wickets, far in excess of the average in the format.",
        "Phillips commented and talked through much of his knock in occasionally hilarious fashion, with intentional use of the stump mic.",
        "Phillips said, 'At the end of the day, it is an entertainment product. I do know there's stump mics there. At the end of the day, for me it's about having as much fun as possible and showing the sort of emotion that I'm feeling at the time.'"
