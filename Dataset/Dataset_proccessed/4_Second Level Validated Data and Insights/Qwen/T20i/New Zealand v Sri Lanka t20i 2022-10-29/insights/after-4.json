        "There’s a lot of cricket left so for us it's about focusing on the next game. As we have seen it doesn’t matter who you play, anyone can beat anyone.",
        "There is a way to chase down big totals and in the first couple of overs we have to give ourselves a chance. We never gone settled, we failed. Wickets fell at regular intervals.",
        "If we can finish with a couple of wins then we have a chance of qualifying so we're looking forward to those games."
