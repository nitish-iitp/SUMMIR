        "Namibia Captain - Gerhard Erasmus: Difficult to get momentum through the innings, we tried by getting the singles and doubles but every now and then we needed those boundaries which were difficult to execute. On a pitch like that, you need to take responsibility after batting 15-20 balls, and you shouldn't allow new batters to face.",
        "Oman Captain- Aqib Ilyas: Would have enjoyed the game if we would have won, but this is part of cricket. Credit goes to Namibia. (On first innings) Credit goes to Trumpelmann for the way he executed, and then our batters adjusted well. However, when we were set we should have gone for more runs. We knew the wicket was on the turning side, and we could have put more pressure with some more runs on the board.",
        "David Wiese - Player of the Match: Lost a couple of years tonight, don't know how many I have left in me now. Just been that kind of an emotionally draining game. (On his Super Over bowling) I had a feel for the wicket and knew what I had to execute in the Super Over. The pitch was difficult, was a bit two-paced and different to what we expected. I think we adapted well and it was surely a pitch where you had to spend some time out there. I think if we were chasing 180, we would have had to attack without thinking too much about the pitch, so tough to say what would have been a par total on this wicket."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Namibia Captain, Gerhard Erasmus: We gonna have a bowl, looks a good wicket and there's some rain around later maybe. We gotta go out there and show what we are about. We need to execute our skills in the middle.",
        "Oman Captain, Aqib Ilyas: It's good to bat on a fresh wicket and the ball will come on nicely in the night. Really good to play, lots of plans but this is the time to execute it. Everyone is fit."

On a pitch like that, you need to take responsibillity after batting 15-20 balls, and you shouldn't allow new batters to face. In the Super Over we proved that there are runs to be had if you just assess the pitch well and take responsibility.",
