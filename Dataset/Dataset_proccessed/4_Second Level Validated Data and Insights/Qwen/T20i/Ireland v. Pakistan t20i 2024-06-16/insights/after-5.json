        "Babar Azam guided Pakistan through a nervy chase as they ended their T20 World Cup campaign with a three-wicket win over Ireland on Sunday in the last Group A match, a dead rubber after both teams were already eliminated.",
        "Paul Stirling: “We played well in patches. They blew our top order away but I’m proud of the fight that we’ve shown. We’ll go back and regroup and get better in the months and years to come.”",
        "Babar: “ We have some close games but we didn’t’ finish well. We have some good indivduals but we didn’t play well as a team.”"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Shaheen Shah Afridi hits a six as he helped Pakistan over the finish line in Florida.",
        "Shaheen Shah Afridi: “As usual I’m trying to strike early on, I followed my plan. We did a good job as bowling unit.”",
        "Shaheen Shah Afridi takes the catch to get Ireland's Mark Adair out after colliding with teammate Usman Khan, behind."

    "Others": [
        "Pakistan win the toss and bowl!",
        "Weather watch",
        "Pakistan need 5.35 an over to win – I’ll be back as soon as the kettle has boiled to take you through their chase.",
        "Azam and Afridi help Pakistan end on a high",
        "Pakistan finish with two wins, but below USA and India who continue into the Super 8s. “We haven’t played the kind of cricket our country demands,” says SSA, “we have a few areas to improve on. The crowd always come in and support us, they’ve done so throughout the World Cup. It’s tough but thanks to the fans.”",
        "Ireland also to lick their wounds.",
        "There's no paywall here",
        "Another flawed but thrilling game, with Pakistan this time hauling themselves to victory thanks to a couple of strong-arm blows by player of the match Shaheen Shah Afridi. A super effort by Ireland, first by recovering from 32-6, then by keeping Pakistan in check right until the penultimate over. Ireland, however, finish bottom, only taking one point from the tournament after three losses and that no result against Canada."
