        "A clash of cricketing giants, and a clash of cricketing philosophies",
        "India need to adapt to conditions but can't be conservative",
        "On one side is a formidable batting unit with holes all over its bowling thanks to the absence of one key superstar; on the other a conservative top order that set its sights on par totals, confident in the ability of its high-quality, high-pace attack to defend them",
        "A World Cup setting, perhaps. And maybe a neutral venue that puts these philosophies to their stiffest test",
        "Both games were seesawing tactical battles that went down to the wire, with India winning the first with two balls remaining and Pakistan the second with one ball to spare",
        "Where better than Australia for the paciest attack in the T20I world to come up against some of the best players of fast bowling?",
        "India will have to make two big calls regarding the composition of their bowling attack. One is picking three out of their four specialist pace options. Then there is the issue of spin",
        "Pakistan have five terrific fast-bowling options, but they can probably pick only three of them",
        "There's one argument for India picking Ashwin despite the right-hand-heavy nature of Pakistan's top six",
        "Dinesh Karthik is set to feature in a T20 World Cup match for the first time in more than 12 years",
        "Karthik and Rohit Sharma were part of India's squad at the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, in which no member of Pakistan's current squad had featured"

        "It may rain on Sunday, though there's a bit of encouraging news on that front",
        "The last three India-Pakistan T20Is have all been played in Dubai, a venue where the toss influences results disproportionately, and have all been won by the chasing side",
        "Chasing teams have won each of the last five completed T20Is at the MCG as well, but that could simply be a quirk of probability",
        "This suggests the toss may not be quite so crucial, though you would probably still expect the team winning it to chase",
        "Also expect a lot of hard-length bowling, with bowlers encouraging batters to hit towards the long square boundaries and keeping them away from the relatively short straight boundaries"
