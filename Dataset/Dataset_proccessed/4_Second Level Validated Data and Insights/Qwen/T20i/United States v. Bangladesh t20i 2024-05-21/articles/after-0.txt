Shakib Al Hasan

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the first T20I between Bangladesh and USA from Houston.

00:24 IST:
A surprising start to the series and it just makes the series more exciting. USA will be confident now as they'll look to win the series while the visitors will hope for a much better performance. Join us on the 23rd of this month at 8.30 pm IST (3 pm GMT) for the second match. Join us earlier for the build up. Cheers!
00:23 IST:
Monank Patel, the USA skipper, says that he is happy with the way they played. Adds that the spinners were tidy with the ball and gave them a chance to chase today. Mentions that they wickets came at crucial times. Shares that they were going well till the 8th over with the bat but played a few dots balls post that. Credits Harmeet Singh and Corey Anderson for their performance. Ends by sharing that he hopes to continue in the same way going into the next two games
00:22 IST:
Harmeet Singh, the Player of the Match, says that it’s a great feeling and taking the 1-0 lead is a great advantage. Adds that they stuck till the end and did not allow Bangladesh to take them lightly. States that chasing 12 runs an over is easy for them and with Bangladesh a bowler short, he backed himself. Shares that Corey Anderson brings a lot of experience and a lot of calm to the dressing room as he has been in such situation. Ends by saying that the team looks upon him.
00:20 IST:
Najmul Hossain Shanto says they didn't bat well and feels extra 20 runs could have made the difference. Shares the batters are struggling on this kind of wicket, it was seen in the last series against Zimbabwe but hopes they'll do better in the next match. Tells the spinners bowled well but the seamers didn't execute the plans.
00:16 IST:
...Presentation...
00:12 IST:
Did Bangladesh took it lightly? They were definitely low on the score. The openers didn't show a lot of intent, both Das and Sarkar struggled to get going. However, it not for Towhid Hridoy and Mahmudullah's late flourish, Bangladesh would have ended way below 150. USA bowled well in patches, they gave away too many extras but were in the game with a par score on the board. For both teams, the spinners came out on top but we expect a side like Bangladesh to put on a much better performance than this one. Nothing to take away from USA though who have announced themselves just before the big event kicks off. 
00:16 IST:
An upset to the odds! What a cracking start to the series. An impressive display from USA from both bat and ball. At one stage it felt like they have left a touch too many for the lower order to hit the winning runs. When Nitish Kumar was dismissed, USA almost saw a dark tunnel ahead as the dot balls were piling up but with Corey Anderson still out there anything was possible. The focus was on Anderson but Harmeet Singh came out of nowhere to hit Mustafizur Rahman for consecutive sixes which started the big chase. He was the one who started the damage when Anderson was struggling but USA scored 15 off the penultimate over and that tilted the stakes on the home team. With less than 10 runs to score in the final over, USA were not going away without a win from that position. 
00:08 IST:
19.3: Mahmudullah to Harmeet Singh, FOUR! A huge roar from Singh as he hits the winning runs. Full and outside off. Singh lofts it over covers for a boundary. USA WIN BY 5 WICKETS.

... The Run Chase ...
22:18 IST:
The bowling from USA was good in patches. The side struggled a bit in the field and with the extras but they did well not to let Bangladesh run away with the game in the first inning itself. Steven Taylor was the pick of the bowlers as he picked up a couple and gave away just 9 runs off his three overs. Jessy Singh, Ali Khan and Saurabh Netravalkar took one each as well. The wicket is two-paced and the outfield too is not the quickest. Can USA create history and chase this down? We shall find out with the chase in a while. 
22:17 IST:
After being asked to bat first the Bangladesh innings got off to a steady start but lost in the later half of the powerplay. The side managed to score just 37 in the first six overs and lost a couple on its way. Wickets kept tumbling as Bangladesh were four down at just 68 runs after 11.2 overs and the side needed a spark from somewhere to motor along. Towhid Hridoy along with Mahmudullah knitted a much-needed partnership of 67 from 47 and helped the side post a formidable total. Towhid Hridoy was the pick of the batters for his half-century while Mahmudullah too played a good hand of 31 runs. Litton Das and Soumya Sarkar started well but failed to capitalize. Jaker Ali came in late and scored quickly as well. 
22:20 IST:
A solid 5th wicket stand between Towhid Hridoy and Mahmudullah helps Bangladesh post 153 on board after the completion of 20 overs.
