    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Rahmanullah Gurbaz: 'Of course disappointed with the result, but that's cricket. We were short 25 runs or so, cos the wicket wasn't that difficult. I just tried to do my best, but I think the way we finished in the final overs wasn't good. Playing franchise cricket has helped a lot, because of how we train to compete in those big competitions. We hope to take the form from here to the World Cup as well.'",
        "Dasun Shanaka: 'It's the belief of the dressing room, we believe we can chase anything in these kinds of wickets. We can always analyse the wicket better when chasing. There was a plan coming into this game, we know they have good batters, but the boys executed the plans really well. As I mentioned in the toss, partnerships was the key to winning the game. We had spoken about that, and now we now how to approach matches and win games.'",
        "Najibullah Zadran: 'We were about 20-25 runs short, and also we didn't field well or bowl in the right areas. It's a better pitch today than the one we played on against Bangladesh, which is why I said we were a few runs short. We didn't bowl brilliantly, but we bowled really well. We dropped some catches, which if we took the game would have been different.'"

    "Others": [
        "Afghanistan lost the game when they failed to review Danushka Gunathilaka's LBW the last ball of 11th over",
        "Sri Lanka should only make 1 change to this team. Play Rajapaksha at No.3 and Aslanka at no.5",
        "Many are talking about Afghanistan's missed chances cost them the match. Then what about that reprieve of Gurbaz at he was 5. It's SL's death bowling that won them the match. Not merely the luck."
