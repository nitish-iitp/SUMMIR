        "Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bowl against Afghanistan in the opening match of the Super Fours at Sharjah. On a turning track, Shanaka has now opted to take the risk to bat last on this pitch which is surely not going to be easy."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [

        "Rashid Has the Last Laugh: WICKET! Clean bowled. Rashid has the last laugh over Gunathilaka who had a run in with the bowler. But, in the end it is the bowler who had the last laugh as he had him clean bowled for 33 runs off 20 balls.",
        "SIX! Wow…what a shot. Unbelievable shot from Bhanuka the southpaw. Drove through the offside and the fielder was just a spectator. FOUR runs."
