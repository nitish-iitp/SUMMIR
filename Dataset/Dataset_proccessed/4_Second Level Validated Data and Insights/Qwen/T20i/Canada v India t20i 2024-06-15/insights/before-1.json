        "Canada are facing their toughest test of the T20 World Cup as India aim to go into the Super 8 stage with a clean sheet, but the fixture is at the mercy of the weather in Florida.",
        "India could test out their bench strength. They have played the same XI in their first three group games, but with qualification secure and no points advantage carried forward to the Super Eight, they could give the likes of Kuldeep Yadav or Sanju Samson some game time.",
        "India's final group game is also Virat Kohli's last chance to find form before the more competitive Super Eight stage.",
        "Despite making his T20I debut only in November 2022, Aaron Johnson is already Canada's second highest run-scorer. He had a tremendous start to his international career, scoring four fifties and one century in his first seven T20I innings, and has sustained his form. No other Canada batter has more runs than Johnson's 400 in 12 innings since the start of 2023.",
        "Hardik Pandya has not had much to do with the bat, but has been an asset with the ball. He is India's joint highest wicket-taker so far in the competition, with seven wickets in three games, and has stifled batters in the middle overs.",
        "Canada's move to bring in Ravinderpal Singh for Dilpreet Bajwa did not work, with Ravinderpal out for a second-ball duck. They might go back to Bajwa against India.",
        "India could rest one of their fast bowlers and bring in Kuldeep, whose wristspin might be required in the Super Eight stage in the West Indies."
