        "Stormy weather in Florida claimed a second match. A day after the game between USA and Ireland was washed off, Saturday's game between India and Canada has been abandoned before the toss could take place.",
        "There was no rain but the damage done to the field could not be reversed.",
        "The outfield is looking quite horrible, dark green footmarks all over the place and new ones being formed wherever anyone walks. Tire marks being left by the blowers as well. The ground looks as soggy as it gets."
