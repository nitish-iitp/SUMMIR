        "India won by 7 runs",
        "India's days are already numbered. The coach is set to depart and the captain may not have a lot of time on his hands as well.",
        "South Africa has gone through the ringer but has coped each time with the game on the line and the pressure at a peak",
        "Jasprit Bumrah gets to bowl four overs in a T20 game, which is either too much or too few depending on allegiance",
        "Heinrich Klaasen is on similarly good terms with the forces that make simple human beings extraordinary",
        "India arrives in the final with seven wins from eight games (one rained out) and in almost all of them, they've been dominant",
        "South Africa arrives in the final with eight wins from eight and they've gone through the ringer",
        "India's coach Rahul Dravid said, 'I don't really believe in this 'Do it for somebody'. I love that quote about somebody asking somebody else, 'Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?' and he says 'I want to climb Mount Everest because it's there'. I want to win this World Cup because it's there.'",
        "South Africa captain Aiden Markram said, 'It's a game of cricket. Someone has to win, and someone has to lose ultimately. That's the name of the game. You take it in your stride. You do get belief, though, from winning close games and potentially winning games that you thought you weren't going to win. It does a lot for your changing room and the vibe in the changing room.'"
