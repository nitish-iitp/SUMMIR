    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Putting just the jersey back on gave him goosebumps. Imagine how it would feel when Rishabh Pant walks out there to bat",
        "Harry Tector made his highest T20I score against India, an action-packed 64 off 33 balls",
        "The middle-order batter stands out for both his power and his temperament and this T20 World Cup might just be his time",
        "India's bowling contains plenty of variety but it is centered around Bumrah and Kuldeep, players with the kind of talent that can dominate whole tournaments",
        "Ireland's batting goes down to No. 8 and it has a reasonable split between power-hitters and shock absorbers",
        "Andy Balbirnie and Lorcan Tucker have the ability to do both of those roles",
        "Their bowling is seam-dominated but left-arm spinner George Dockrell could get an over or two against the more orthodox batters in the Indian line-up"

    "Others": [
        "The weather in New York is perfect for cricket. Not too hot, not too cold, no worry about dew",
        "The pitch and outfield, however, will be under the scanner again after the events from Monday, where 80 for 4 in 16.2 overs played 77 all out",
        "But things can only get better. India played a warm-up game here, on a different track, and they scored 180"
