        "Flower on New York pitch - 'Bordering on dangerous'",
        "Rohit Sharma retired hurt on 52 after being struck on the arm"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "India's selection was spot-on - they picked four fast bowlers including Hardik Pandya, and two spin-bowling allrounders to lengthen their batting",
        "By the end of the powerplay, Ireland were still only two down, but Harry Tector had already been hit on the glove and the thigh pad and was batting on 1 off 10",
        "By then they had also lost Lorcan Tucker, bowled trying to drive a nip-backer from Hardik",
        "At 50 for 8, Ireland were in danger of falling short of their lowest T20I total - 68 against West Indies during the 2010 edition of this tournament",
        "Rohit enjoyed two slices of early luck - Balbirnie put down a tough chance at second slip in the first over, off Adair, and an inside-edge in the second over, off Josh Little, ran away for four past the stumps",
        "Before that, he also went past 4000 runs in T20Is",
        "Pant looked more fluent than Rohit, indeed as fluent as anyone could have looked on this pitch, and hit three sixes and two fours while scoring an unbeaten 36 off 26",
        "He took a hit to the elbow and one to the shoulder, and his response to the latter blow summed him up as a cricketer and character: he finished the match off the next ball, reverse-scooping McCarthy for six over the wicketkeeper"
