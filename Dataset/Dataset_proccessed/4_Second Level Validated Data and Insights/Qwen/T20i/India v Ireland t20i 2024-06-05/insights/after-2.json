        "Rohit Sharma’s 50 leads India to an eight-wicket win, but his shoulder injury, which forced the Indian skipper to retire hurt, will be a concern.",
        "‘I don’t know what to expect from the pitch, to be honest. But we will prepare as if the conditions will be like [today],’ said India captain Rohit Sharma.",
        "‘When there is enough in the pitch you have to think about the basics. Bowl like in a Test match. It was important for these guys to bowl like that. Arshdeep was the only bowler that hasn’t bowled in a Test,’ said Rohit Sharma."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "India’s 8-wicket win comes with 7.4 overs to spare. That will be handy for the net run rate.",
