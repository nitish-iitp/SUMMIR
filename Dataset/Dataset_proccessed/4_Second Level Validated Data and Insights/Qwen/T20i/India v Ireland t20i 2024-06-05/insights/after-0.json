        "Teams are making the same sort of Victorian scores they were running up in 1844 when the batsmen managed a top score of 14 in the very first international match between Canada and the USA."

    "Others": [
        "The ball reared and kicked and jagged and spat and seamed and stopped; one would shoot through shin high, the next would soar over the batter’s head.",
        "Arshdeep Singh dismissed both openers in his second over, when Paul Stirling became the first of four batters caught off the top edge, and Andy Balbirnie was clean bowled trying to glance a ball that nipped away from him.",
        "India brought on Jasprit Bumrah, of all bowlers, and he had Tector caught with a short ball that ricocheted off his glove and helmet.",
        "That dismissal left Ireland 50 for eight in the 12th over.",
        "Hardik Pandya picked off three batters in nine balls, including Curtis Campher, who slapped 12 off eight balls.",
        "Barry McCarthy went the other way, and ground out a six-ball duck, which was sealed, in the end, by Axar Patel’s superb diving catch off his own bowling."
