        "The team chemistry is undeniable.",
        "They’re stacked with talent, and have both young players with plausible upside and veterans years away from steep decline.",
        "The Phillies could go up against the powerful Braves, take their best punch in Game 2, and then forget it in 10 minutes and sweep the series’ remaining games.",
        "A guy who bombed five home runs in three games could suddenly forget how to hit anything less than a week later, and a dude with a 1.163 OPS through 11 postseason games could go 0-for-12 in the next three and look as pathetic as possible in the process."

    "Others": [
        "The Phillies were facing an 84-win Arizona Diamondbacks team.",
        "They had the clear-cut on-paper advantage both in hitting and starting pitching.",
        "They had home-field advantage.",
        "They raced out to a 2-0 series lead.",
        "They led in both Games 3 and 4 — a three-run edge in the latter.",
        "They returned home — where they were previously unbeaten throughout the playoffs — up 3-2 in the series and somehow managed just three runs in 18 innings en route to a seven-game series loss."
