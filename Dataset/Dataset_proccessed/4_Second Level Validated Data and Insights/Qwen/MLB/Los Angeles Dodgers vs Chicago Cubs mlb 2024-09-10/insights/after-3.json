        "Bellinger blasted the first pitch he saw from Walker Buehler in the first inning, driving it 430 feet out to right field for a two-run homer that set the tone in a 10-4 victory."
    ],
    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Any free agent with the star power to transform their offense will presumably notice how unkind the Friendly Confines have been to hitters recently.",
        "Wrigley Field is unexplainable; it didn't rain, the crop didn't grow. Wrigley Field had the most unusual season. It has been an offensive drought.",
        "The Cubs have scored zero runs in 15 games so far this year, which almost doubles the number of times they were shut out last season (8), and nearly matches the historically bad 2024 Chicago White Sox in that category (16 shutouts).",
        "On the road, the Cubs have posted a.742 team OPS, 73 points higher than their output at home.",
        "Players appreciate the history, the neighborhood feel and the energy from the big crowds. A billion-dollar renovation didn’t fundamentally change the ballpark’s spectacular atmosphere.",
        "The Cubs, though, can’t ignore the offensive data while thinking about future rosters, or pretend it won’t come up when recruiting certain players.",
        "Bellinger’s well-rounded skills were on display in Monday’s ninth inning, when he added an RBI single and made a diving catch in right field."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "I just want to finish strong and end the season on a high note.",
        "At the end of the day, I want to help the team win. I hate just sitting on the bench."
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Bellinger remains an above-average left-handed hitter with 16 homers, 63 RBIs and a.754 OPS at a time when offense across the game is down.",
        "His sprint speed and arm strength are both in the 75th percentile or higher, according to Statcast, and he would likely be playing center field on most teams that don’t have a defender like Pete Crow-Armstrong."
