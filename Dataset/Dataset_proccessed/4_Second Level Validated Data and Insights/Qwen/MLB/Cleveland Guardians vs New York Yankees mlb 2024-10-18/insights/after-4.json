        "Manager Stephen Vogt said, 'That’s exactly who we are. We never quit. We get punched in the teeth pretty hard there in the eighth, and our guys stepped up huge for the guy [Clase] that carried us all year long.'",
        "Fry said, 'You just hand him the ball, and we don’t even watch the game, I feel like we are chatting up because we know the game is over. So we were obviously shook, but it was just like, you know what, it’s time we give him a break.'",
        "Noel said, 'Cannot deny it’s a very exciting moment, but at the same time, it’s kind of like — I’m not trying to be stubborn or arrogant — try to downplay it. The goal is to get to the World Series. When we get to that point, that’s when we’re going to be a little more celebratory mode.'"
