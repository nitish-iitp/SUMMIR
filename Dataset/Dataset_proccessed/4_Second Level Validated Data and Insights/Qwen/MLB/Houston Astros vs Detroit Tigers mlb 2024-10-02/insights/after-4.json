        "When we get to the playoffs, you're thinking long-term, you're thinking winning. We couldn't win a game against the Tigers. We're heartbroken right now. We've just got to move on.",
        "Obviously, you want to win the World Series. They're a pretty good ballclub. They grind. They pitch good. They didn't make a lot of mistakes. They were pretty good. It sucks that we had to end the season like this early, but that's part of baseball.",
        "I think we're going to be just fine. Joe gave a speech and said we'll be back in the postseason next year, and I totally agree with him. We've got a lot of good players in this clubhouse."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Tigers, led by former Astros manager A.J. Hinch, rallied for four runs in the eighth inning against Ryan Pressly and closer Josh Hader to halt Houston's run of consecutive trips to the AL Championship Series at seven.",
        "The Astros finally rallied in the seventh inning, when they loaded the bases, but they managed only two runs on a fielder’s choice by Jon Singleton and a sac fly by Altuve.",
        "Pressly bounced a wild pitch in the eighth inning, allowing Kerry Carpenter to score from third with the tying run.",
        "Hunter Brown was terrific in his first career postseason start, striking out nine batters and giving up two hits and one run — a leadoff homer by Parker Meadows in the sixth inning that clanked off the right-field foul pole.",
        "Brown was left with no margin for error, though, as the Astros struggled to get anything going against the Tigers for the second game in a row."
