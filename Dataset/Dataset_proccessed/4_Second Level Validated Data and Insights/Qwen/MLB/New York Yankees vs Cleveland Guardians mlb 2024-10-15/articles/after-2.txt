Heroes, zeros from Yankees’ win over Guardians: Joey Cantillo was disastrous

Heroes, zeros and the full blitz from the Yankees’ Game 1 win over the Guardians on Monday:

Hero

After falling apart in the fourth inning of his Game 2 start against the Royals in the ALDS, Carlos Rodon gave the Yankees just what they wanted with six strong innings. 

Zero

Cleveland left-hander Joey Cantillo unleashed two wild pitches that scored runs in the bottom of the third inning and added two more in the fourth, which helped create another run.

He also walked three of the four batters he faced.

Unsung hero

Luke Weaver kept up his convincing Mariano Rivera in October impression as he picked up his fourth save and got out of a mess in the eighth inning. 

Key stat

7 Walks by the Yankees — after 27 free passes in the ALDS against the Royals — in Game 1 of the ALCS, which should help wear down a taxed Cleveland staff.
