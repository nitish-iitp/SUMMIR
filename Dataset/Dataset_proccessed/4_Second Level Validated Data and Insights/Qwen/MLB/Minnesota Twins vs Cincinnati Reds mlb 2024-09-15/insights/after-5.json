    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Playing without their two best hitters in the lineup and needing a win to avoid a back-breaking sweep at home to a non-contending team, the Twins dug really deep and found the biggest game of Brooks Lee’s young career."
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Lee hopes it happens at an even better time in the playoffs and that he can do that there, too. It feels great. It’s just important to win. We avoided getting swept. The bats were on fire. We pitched well. Everything came together today."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Lee had a huge afternoon on both offense and defense, further highlighted by his first career triple",
        "Lee has continued to look the part at shortstop while his bat has woken up for nine RBIs in his last four games",
        "The Twins’ ability to come from behind and rally highlighted the mindset that veteran Kyle Farmer had hoped the Twins’ rookies would internalize as the times got tough in their first playoff push: ‘Don't play to give it up. Play to take it.’"
