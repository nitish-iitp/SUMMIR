        "Definitely not what you want",
        "We were one win away",
        "I think for us to be a success is winning the World Series",
        "I mean, we just didn’t play well enough at home",
        "I just told the guys I loved them and I appreciate their effort and appreciate how they go about their business and how professional that they are",
        "It was frustrating",
        "At the same time, I feel like as a team we accomplished a lot of stuff",
        "It wasn't easy all year. We had a lot of injuries, and I'm really proud of this group of guys. They never gave up, and just to be able to make it seven in a row I think is pretty special",
        "It's not easy to accept or say, but we got beat",
        "We have been spoiled around here as far as winning and winning and winning. And heck, I've been here four years, and we've been to two World Series and [four] Championship Series"

        "The Astros lost 22 of their final 29 games at home, including the playoffs",

        "Nathaniel Lowe’s homer in the sixth made it 10-2",
        "Corey Seager homered with one out, and the next four batters reached against Javier, with two of them scoring",
        "Adolis García had four hits and five RBIs, including two home runs, and was named ALCS Most Valuable Player",
        "The Rangers struck for three runs in the first inning against Astros starter Cristian Javier, a playoff hero from a year ago who recorded just one out in Game 7",
        "A battle of the bullpens appeared to be in favor of the Astros, but the Rangers rocked J.P. France for four runs in the fourth to take an 8-2 lead, including a two-run single by Adolis García"
