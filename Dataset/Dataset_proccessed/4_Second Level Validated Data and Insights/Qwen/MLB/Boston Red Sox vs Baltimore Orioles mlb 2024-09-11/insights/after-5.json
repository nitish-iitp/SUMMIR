    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "‘Definitely frustrating, you know?’ Akin said. ‘We’re at kind of a crucial point right now. Haven’t really been playing our best ball, but I think it’s coming, I do. You’re starting to see a little bit of it. Just got to kind of put it all together at one time, and I think we’ll go from there.’",
        "‘I wish that was my job to tell you, but that's not my job. My job is to go out there and pitch,’ right-hander Dean Kremer said.",
        "Orioles manager Brandon Hyde could have intentionally walked the right-handed-hitting O’Neill to load the bases. But the Sox likely would have then sent Rob Refsnyder to the plate in place of Masataka Yoshida."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Orioles haven’t been playing like a team capable of going on a deep postseason run. They’re 25-26 since the All-Star break, and they’ve lost five of their past seven.",
        "Emmanuel Rivera was nearly an unlikely hero for the O’s. The 28-year-old journeyman infielder hit a go-ahead RBI single in the top of the 10th to cap a 2-for-4 performance that also featured a third-inning home run."
