The White Sox refuse to give in to the -record nobody wants.

Fueled by a season-high seven-run inning and 6„ innings of pitching from beleaguered right-hander Chris Flexen, the Sox (39-120) defeated the Angels 7-0 on Thursday, remaining tied with the 1962 New York Mets for the most losses in one season. They’ll need to sweep the playoff-hunting Tigers this weekend to avoid owning the record by themselves, an improbable task. But off they go to Motown looking to play spoiler.

And to avoid history for at least another day.
