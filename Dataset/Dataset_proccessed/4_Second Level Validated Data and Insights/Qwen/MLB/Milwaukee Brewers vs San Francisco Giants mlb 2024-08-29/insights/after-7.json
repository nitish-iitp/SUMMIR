        "Rookie Hayden Birdsong lasted just 3 2/3 innings against the Brewers.",
        "Logan Webb, the lone pitcher to do so during the stretch, pitched into the sixth on Tuesday but failed to record an out.",
        "Birdsong gave up only four hits -- one of them a home run to Garrett Mitchell -- but walked four batters for the second consecutive start and threw 92 pitches (49 strikes).",
        "The Giants fell to Milwaukee 6-0.",
        "Birdsong said he was in the zone, especially the first inning, but then the Brewers scored runs and made him work more.",
        "Manager Bob Melvin mentioned the high pitch count led to Birdsong’s early exit.",
        "The Brewers scored one of their runs on a double steal in the third, with William Contreras scoring on a mishandled throw by Matt Chapman."
