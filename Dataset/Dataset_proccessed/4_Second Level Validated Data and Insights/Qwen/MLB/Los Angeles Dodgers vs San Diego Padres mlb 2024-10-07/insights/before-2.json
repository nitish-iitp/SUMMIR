        "Dodgers starters have allowed 22 runs on 26 hits over 13 innings in their past five postseason games.",

        "The rest of the way, the Dodgers are going to rely on Walker Buehler, who will start Game 3 on Tuesday night at Petco Park and, likely, rookie Landon Knack to handle the bulk of the innings in Wednesday night's Game 4, which could turn out to be a bullpen game."
