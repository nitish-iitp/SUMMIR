    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Well-rested Giants rookie pitcher Kyle Harrison was well on his way to providing a much-needed quality outing on Wednesday night against the Brewers.",
        "After having his last start skipped, Harrison was sharp early in his return to the mound in Milwaukee.",
        "Manager Bob Melvin said, ‘He pitched really well up to that point. He was getting strikeouts and swings and misses, throwing his breaking ball for a strike.’"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Harrison said, ‘I felt great today. Stuff was great,’ Harrison said. ‘I think I got a little out of rhythm, didn’t get some calls my way. But I’ve got to look past that and get to the next pitch. I didn’t make as good of pitches as I’d like.’",
        "Melvin said, ‘It’s frustrating. We want to come out with a win, especially going into the fifth with no runs [allowed],’ Harrison said. ‘Just got to be better. I trusted my stuff but I got away from my stuff in that last inning. I wanted to stick with certain pitches and I gave in a little bit. You learn from that.’"
