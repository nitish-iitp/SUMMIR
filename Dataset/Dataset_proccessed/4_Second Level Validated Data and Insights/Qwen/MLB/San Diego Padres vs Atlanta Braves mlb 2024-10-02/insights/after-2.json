        "The Braves have been in a pseudo-do-or-die mode for a while now, but on Wednesday night, they will face their second elimination game in three contests.",
        "Max Fried is starting tonight on regular rest. His season started in particularly gruesome fashion, but he finished with 3.4 fWAR in 29 starts (174 1⁄3 innings).",
        "Fried’s xFIP this season was 3.33, and his xFIP since becoming a full-time starter in 2020 has been 3.33.",
        "Fried nearly Madduxed the Royals in a previous game, finishing with a 9/2 K/BB ratio in 8 2⁄3 innings.",
        "The Padres are not quite as offensive as the Royals, Cubs, or Marlins, but they have a solid pitcher in Joe Musgrove, who posted 1.4 fWAR in 19 starts spanning 99 2⁄3 innings.",
        "Musgrove has a deep pitch mix and good command, making him tough to handle. He has a 98/98/92 line, although his xERA suggests he can give up hard-hit doubles.",
        "Musgrove hasn't faced the Braves since 2022, when the Padres beat Atlanta in both of his starts – one was dominant, and one was less so but featured a late Padres rally."
