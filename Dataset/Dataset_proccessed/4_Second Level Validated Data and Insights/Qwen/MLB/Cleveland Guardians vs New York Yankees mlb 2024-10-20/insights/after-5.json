        "They're just a better team",
        "It wasn’t enough",
        "Vogt, the journeyman catcher who was hired by Cleveland last December despite not having any managerial experience, told his players to keep their heads held high",
        "Remember this feeling you have right now because there’s more left on the table for this group"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Tanner Bibee couldn’t hold back his tears",
        "Several of his teammates sat nearby in a circle on the floor in a corner of a deathly silent clubhouse, almost afraid to move",
        "There were long hugs, heartfelt whispers",
        "The Guardians, who overachieved by winning 92 regular-season games and the AL Central title, fought their way past division rival Detroit in the ALDS — beating expected Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal in the decisive game — for a shot at the Yankees with their star-studded roster and $300 million-plus payroll",
        "The Guardians had their chances, so many chances. They put pressure on the Yankees in every game, but couldn’t come up with big hits in key spots",
        "The moments were there for them to seize and they let them slip by",
        "Cleveland left 47 runners on base, finishing 9 of 47 (.191) with runners in scoring position",
        "All season long, their aggressive style — ‘Guards Ball’ as it became known — under first-year manager Stephen Vogt rarely materialized against the Yankees, who used their bigger bats to outslug them",
        "New York hit two homers in Game 5 while Cleveland managed just a pair of RBI singles",
        "All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase nearly blew Game 3 but got bailed out and then collapsed in Game 4, giving up two runs in the ninth inning",
        "Clase regrouped in Game 5, but this time it was Hunter Gaddis, who allowed Juan Soto’s three-run homer in the 10th inning as the Yankees ended Cleveland’s season in the playoffs for the second time in three years"
