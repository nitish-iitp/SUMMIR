        "The Yankees won their first pennant in 15 years because of the Yankees taking advantage of the Guardians' worn-down bullpen and managing the series effectively."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt had a lightning quick hook during Games 1 through 4, pulling his starters after 2.2, 1.1, 5.0, and 2.1 innings in each respective game.",
        "Emmanuel Clase, Cade Smith, Hunter Gaddis, and Tim Herrin, Vogt’s relief horses, all had been worked hard and looked over by the Yankees, in some cases yielding some very loud hits.",
        "Gleyber Torres swung at a first-pitch cutter, a pitch he'd seen four times already, and looped it into left for a single.",
        "Juan Soto took a curveball down and a changeup inside. In a 3-2 count, Bibee went back to the slider and hung it, and Stanton deposited it 446 feet away in the Progressive Field bleachers.",
        "Alex Verdugo grounding into what should have been a 4-6 fielder’s choice that Rocchio dropped.",
        "Soto worked a masterpiece of an at-bat, hitting with confidence of a poker player who’d seen one of his opponent’s hole cards.",
        "Soto unleashed a mighty swing and barreled the pitch, and by the time the ball landed over the center-field wall, the Yankees had all but clinched their spot in the World Series."
