        "Teoscar Hernández chopped a pitch in front of the plate, rather than going for the sure out at first base, Francisco Alvarez threw to second, where Max Muncy reached safely, setting up the possibility of a big inning.",
        "Gavin Lux hit a potential double-play ball back to Severino, but he bobbled it and was only able to get the out at first as the runners advanced.",
        "Severino couldn't corral a Will Smith comebacker that had a 12 percent hit probability, rather than fielding it cleanly and holding the runner at third, the ball deflected off Severino's glove and Muncy scored."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "When you're giving a team like this extra outs, extra bases, they're going to make you pay",
        "It is a tough inning, but at the end of the day, it's part of the game. It's one of those where if we would have made the plays, things probably would have been a little different. But at the end of the day, it worked out the way it worked out. You've got to live with it, come back and be better tomorrow. It's part of the game. You've got to limit the mistakes. This time of the year, you've got to limit the mistakes to win ballgames. And today they played better than us."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Center fielder Tyrone Taylor raced to the warning track, where he not only made a sliding grab but narrowly avoided a disastrous collision with right fielder Starling Marte.",
        "Taylor’s arm hit Marte’s side before they bumped shins. Instead of a two-run extra-base hit, Edman settled for a sacrifice fly."
