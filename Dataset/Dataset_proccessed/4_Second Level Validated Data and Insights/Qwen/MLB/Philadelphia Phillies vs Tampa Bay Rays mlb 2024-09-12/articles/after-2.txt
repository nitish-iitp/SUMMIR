Tampa Bay Rays reliever Edwin Uceta might’ve added fuel to the first-place Philadelphia Phillies’ fire in Tuesday night’s ballgame.

Uceta entered in the bottom of the eighth inning with one out and two men on base in a 4-4 game. Cal Stevenson doubled to give the Phillies a 6-4 lead. After a Garrett Stubbs strikeout, Uceta allowed an RBI single to Buddy Kennedy. He then allowed a two-run home run to Trea Turner. Bryce Harper doubled in the next at-bat. Uceta hit Nick Castellanos, one of the most consistent hitters on the team, with a fastball right around his waistline on the very next pitch.

Castellanos took immediate offense to the hit-by-pitch. He had to be redirected by the catcher and umpire as he chirped at Uceta. Harper also didn’t like Uceta’s actions and started approaching the Rays’ pitcher from behind while yelling at him. Harper had to be held back by several Rays players as he made his way from second base toward the pitcher’s mound.

The benches cleared as both teams had some choice words for one another after the hit-by-pitch. The umpires decided to eject Uceta from the game, forcing the Rays to bring in a new pitcher to finish out the inning. The Phillies wound up winning the game 9-4.

Uceta received a three-game suspension from Major League Baseball for intentionally hitting Castellanos after blowing the game for the Rays. Manager Kevin Cash also received a one-game suspension for his player’s actions.

Igniting the Phillies’ Fire at the Right Time

Moments like what happened Tuesday night can bring a team closer together and generate momentum in the ensuing games. The Phillies hold an 8.0-game lead over the New York Mets in the NL East and own the best record in baseball. The Castellanos hit-by a pitch, and the support from his teammates could be a spark as the Phillies head into the final push of the regular season and the postseason.

The Phillies have 16 games left before the postseason begins. This team has great chemistry and camaraderie, which was on full display Tuesday night. A successful team not only has talent but also a good clubhouse and good relationships among the players. The Phillies believe they have the right talent and clubhouse to do something special in 2024.

The Phillies won the next game Wednesday night to sweep the Rays out of Philadelphia. Castellanos got his revenge in his first at-bat, hitting a two-run home run in the first inning after being hit by the pitch the night before.

It’s safe to say he and the Phillies had the last laugh.
