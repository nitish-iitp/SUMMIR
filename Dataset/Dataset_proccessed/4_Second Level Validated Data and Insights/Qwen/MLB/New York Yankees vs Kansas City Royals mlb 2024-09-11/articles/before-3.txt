Kansas City Royals (80-66) vs. New York Yankees (83-62)

 

The Kansas City Royals currently have an overwhelming record of 80-66. Most of them have been remarkably resilient and capable in their games lately. In their last five games, the Royals won four of them, some against the Yankees and even the Minnesota Twins, proving that the team has grown a set capable of taking on the best. Their claim to consistency was further justified by humbling the Yankees 5-0 recently. This proves that the team is prepared for what lies ahead in the playoffs.

On the contrary, the Yankees have been a different beast when they play at home, as evidenced recently by a crushing 10-4 win against the Royals, although they have dulled a bit against the Chicago Cubs. Their home games are promising, given how they will turn out from the hint of high-scoring games, a factor that the Royals’ pitchers will have to manage if they win this series. If the Yankees can capitalize on the shortcomings of the Royals, notably during home contests, it would go a long way in this matching.

Cole Ragans (11-9, 3.33 ERA) vs. Luis Gil (13-6, 3.24 ERA)

 

Cole Ragans has this season proven himself an important asset for the Royals. He boasts a record of more than 200 strikeouts, complemented by a low WHIP, which suggests that he performs well under duress. He should do well against the New York Yankees batting order as his pitching technique curbs opposition batting averages. Against a batting lineup that is both resilient and potent, Ragans’ ability to keep his cool and deliver on the task will be put to the test.

 

Luis Gil’s season for the Yankees is outstanding, with impressive wins and losses and an ERA that is not worse than Ragans. Gil has been extremely effective at controlling and striking batters out. He has, however, some weaknesses in walk rates that teams with aggressive approaches, such as the Royals, might take advantage of. This contest should shift on how well Gil performs against the Royals’ batters, given that he has that clutch factor of finishing innings when they are most needed.

 

MLB Odds/Point Spread: New York Yankees -154, Total Odds: 8

 

The current betting odds lean slightly towards the Yankees, likely due to their robust home game performance and historical dominance over the Royals. However, the game’s total being set at 8 reflects the expected tight pitching duel between Ragans and Gil.

 

Kansas City Royals Betting Trends

 

Despite their struggles against the Yankees in past encounters, the Royals have shown a pattern of bouncing back strongly after losses, as seen in their recent win following a heavy defeat. Their resilience and ability to keep games low-scoring could play into their favor, aligning with the trend where the total has gone UNDER in 5 of their last 6 games.

 

New York Yankees Betting Trends

 

The Yankees’ betting trends highlight their strength in rebounding at home and their ability to handle pressure in critical series. Their consistent performance against AL Central teams, coupled with their home game scoring trends, suggests that they might push the total OVER, contrary to the overall game trend.

 

Kansas City Royals vs. New York Yankees 9/11/24 Betting Picks

 

Based on the assessment and the trends in betting, the Yankees are the stronger team due to their excellent home performance which gives them another edge. The reverse might happen though with the Royals managing to cover the spread in an away game with back-and-forth scoring.

 

In this sense, those looking for handicapper best tips may be well advised to bet on the Yankees winning, but more often than not, the Royals with the spread may be more rewarding. The Bet on total runs under is a good one as there is going to be effective pitching. Also, prop bets on the pitcher strikeouts may be quite fruitful.
