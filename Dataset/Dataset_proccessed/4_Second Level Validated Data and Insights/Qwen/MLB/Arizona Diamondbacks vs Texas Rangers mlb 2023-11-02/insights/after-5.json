        "You want to be the last team standing. You want to be in the middle of a pile and have everybody pile on top of you. That’s the best feeling in the world, Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.",
        "Arizona managed to overcome its lack of depth in its rotation through the first three rounds of the playoffs, but it cost them in the World Series.",
        "Gallen did, but it wasn’t enough as some of Arizona’s biggest bats during the regular season went quiet in the Fall Classic.",
        "Second baseman Ketel Marte had a huge playoff run. He had at least one hit in the first 16 games, giving him a record 20-game postseason hit streak to begin his career.",
        "Christian Walker, Arizona’s regular-season home run leader with 33, had a difficult postseason at the plate, hitting.217 with one homer and seven RBIs."

        "Arizona had five hits and went 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position in Game 5.",
        "Walker mishandled a ball that led to a five-run third inning in Game 4 and center fielder Alek Thomas overran a ball in the ninth in Game 5, allowing a run to score in the four-run inning."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Two years removed from losing 110 games, the Diamondbacks shook off a midseason swoon to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2017.",
        "The NL pennant is certainly something the Diamondbacks can build upon.",
        "Arizona’s bullpen, a strength down the stretch of the regular season, also faltered in a Game 1 loss, giving up Corey Seager’s two-run homer in the ninth inning and Adolis García’s walk-off homer in the 11th."
