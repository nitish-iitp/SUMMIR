        "The end of the line in Kansas City was painful. For the last four decades, the Royals have been defined by glorious highs and long playoff droughts. This was, amazingly, the first time since 1984 that a Kansas City playoff appearance had ended before the World Series.",
        "Witt, the Royals' 24-year-old star, was watching the Yankees celebrate their series victory. He wanted to take it all in.",
        "The Royals got a taste this year. They won 86 games — an improvement of 30 victories from last year. They brought back playoff baseball to Kauffman Stadium for the first time since 2015, when they won the franchise’s second World Series. They put a scare into the Yankees, the top seed in the American League, losing three games by a combined four runs."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Royals had a chance to steal Game 1 against Cole in New York, losing 6-5. They had Lugo, an All-Star this season, going in Game 3. They lost that by one run, too.",
        "Their pitchers walked too many hitters. Witt and first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino combined for three hits in the series."

    "Others": [
        "For 197 days, the 2024 Royals had lived by a simple coda: Today.",
        "On Thursday, that day was the final one."
