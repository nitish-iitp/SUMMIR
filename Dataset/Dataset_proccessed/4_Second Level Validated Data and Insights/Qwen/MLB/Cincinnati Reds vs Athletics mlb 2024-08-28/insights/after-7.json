        "That inning there, we haven't had anything like that very much this season. And to show the fight to answer back in that fashion, it's just showing the character of the group right now. They've got confidence. The offense has confidence and really that in itself, is how you win baseball games really, and it's great to see that from this group right now."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Seth Brown victimized Reds reliever Emilio Pagán (3-4), who gave up a single to JJ Bleday and a ground-rule double to Shea Langeliers before the go-ahead homer.",
        "Brown got two fastballs to hit over the middle of the plate Wednesday and didn’t miss either one.",
        "Mason Miller recorded the save for the second straight night, giving him 23 saves in 25 chances and matching Huston Street’s mark in 2005 for second-most saves by a rookie Oakland reliever. Andrew Bailey (2009) holds the record with 26."
