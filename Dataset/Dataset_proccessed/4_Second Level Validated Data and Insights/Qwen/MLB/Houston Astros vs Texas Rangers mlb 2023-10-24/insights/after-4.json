        "Houston manager Dusty Baker said, 'We have been spoiled around here as far as winning and winning and winning. And heck, I've been here four years, and we've been to two World Series and two Championship Series. We have nothing to be ashamed of or nothing to hold our head down about. We're down, but we're not out. And every team in baseball would trade to have had the last four years that we've had.'",
        "Third baseman Alex Bregman said, 'We didn't execute as well as we have in years past. … It comes down to execution, and we didn't do a good enough job of that, and they did.'"
