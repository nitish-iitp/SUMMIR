        "The Houston Astros lost a devastating Game 7 against their Texas Rangers in the ALCS.",
        "After winning all three road games, it felt almost like a sure thing that the Astros would get one at home to put away the Texas Rangers.",
        "Their home struggles continued and they had to watch the Rangers' celebrate winning the AL Pennant on their own field.",
        "It was a strange year overall when looking back on Houston's season.",
        "They got off to a slow start, were bad at home, dominated on the road and their pitching was a shell of itself.",
        "For as dominant as Houston has been in recent years, they've also lost big games.",
        "That's what happens in baseball. Only one team wins at the end of the year.",
        "When the Astros lost the ALCS in 2018, they won it the next year. When they lost the ALCS in 2020, they won it in 2021.",
        "When they lost the World Series in 2021, they became champions in 2022."
