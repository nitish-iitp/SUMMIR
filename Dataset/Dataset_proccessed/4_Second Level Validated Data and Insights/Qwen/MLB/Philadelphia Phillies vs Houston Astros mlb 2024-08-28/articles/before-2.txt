Settles at $3.4 million
The Astros and McCormick avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $3.4 million contract Thursday, Matt Kawahara of the Houston Chronicle reports.
Impact McCormick was arbitration-eligible for a second time this winter. The outfielder cratered to a .576 OPS in 94 regular-season games in 2024 following an .842 OPS in 2023. McCormick currently appears in line for regular playing time in 2025, although the Astros might not be done making roster additions.

On Houston's wild-card roster
The Astros activated McCormick (hand) from the 10-day injured list Tuesday, Brian McTaggart of MLB.com reports.
Impact McCormick has been sidelined since mid-September with a small fracture in his right hand, but he's progressed enough to be included on the team's wild-card roster. While an option to get some reps versus lefties, McCormick is not in the Game 1 lineup against southpaw Tarik Skubal.

Expected to be on wild-card roster
Astros manager Joe Espada said Monday that McCormick (hand) should be "ready to go" for the wild-card series against the Tigers, Matt Kawahara of the Houston Chronicle reports.
Impact McCormick has been shelved since mid-September with a small fracture in his right hand, but he's been working out for the past week and it appears he will be part of the Astros' wild-card roster. The switch-hitting outfielder has put up just a .577 OPS over 267 plate appearances in 2024.

Won't return this week
McCormick (hand) will not accompany the Astros on their road trip to Cleveland this weekend, Chandler Rome of The Athletic reports.
Impact McCormick has been ramping back up his activities and will continue to work out back in Houston, but he will not return before the end of the regular season. The 29-year-old should still have a good shot to be ready in time for the ALDS. McCormick has put up a disappointing .577 OPS over 267 plate appearances in 2024, but he had gone 10-for-24 at the plate over his last eight games before fracturing his right hand in mid-September.

Impact McCormick has produced a poor .577 OPS over 267 plate appearances with Houston in 2024, but he had enjoyed his best stretch of the season over his most recent eight games (10-for-24 with a home run and 1:2 BB:K) before landing on the IL on Sept. 12 with a small fracture in his right hand. The 29-year-old is ready to begin ramping up again following a brief shutdown period, and if he's able to swing the bat at full velocity and without discomfort, he looks like he could return to the Astros' active roster before the regular season comes to a close.

Officially lands on 10-day IL
The Astros placed McCormick on the 10-day injured list Thursday with a fractured right hand, Chandler Rome of The Athletic reports.
Impact McCormick suffered the injury during Tuesday's game versus the Athletics when he crashed into the outfield wall. The fracture is considered small and he will be eligible to return during the final weekend of the regular season, but it's unclear whether he has a shot to make it back by that time.

Headed for IL
Manager Joe Espada said Wednesday that McCormick has a fracture in his right hand and will need to spend time on the injured list, Chandler Rome of The Athletic reports.
Impact McCormick crashed into the outfield wall during Tuesday's contest and had to make an early exit from the game, and it now appears the 29-year-old will need to sit out for a while longer. There's no telling if he'll be able to return before the end of the regular season.

Absent from Houston lineup
McCormick (wrist) is not in the lineup for Wednesday's game against the Astros, Brian McTaggart of MLB.com reports.
Impact McCormick had to exit Tuesday's contest after he injured his right wrist when he collided with the outfield wall. He had made seven straight starts but will miss at least one game while he tends to the injury. Mauricio Dubon, Jake Meyers and Ben Gamel will form the Astros' outfield trio Wednesday.

Battling wrist injury
McCormick was removed from Tuesday's game against the Athletics due to right wrist discomfort, Chandler Rome of The Athletic reports.
Impact McCormick likely hurt his wrist while crashing into the outfield wall, though the severity of his injury remains unknown. Should he need to miss any games, Jake Meyers would presumably receive an uptick in playing time.

Getting sixth straight start
McCormick will start in center field and bat ninth in Sunday's game against the Diamondbacks.
Impact McCormick wasn't expected to be in store for a major role after being called up from Triple-A Sugar Land on Monday, but he'll draw a sixth consecutive start Sunday after going 6-for-18 with a double, a walk, three RBI and three runs. However, with Jake Meyers back from the paternity list and with Kyle Tucker likely to resume playing the outfield soon after being limited to designated-hitter duties in his first two starts since being activated from the injured list Friday, McCormick's playing time should soon fall by the wayside.

Promotion official
The Astros recalled McCormick from Triple-A Sugar Land on Monday.
Impact Less than a week after being optioned to Sugar Land, McCormick will be eligible to rejoin the Astros since Houston is placing Jake Meyers (personal) on the paternity list in a corresponding move. McCormick is expected to head back to Sugar Land once Meyers is activated, likely ahead of the Astros' weekend series with the Diamondbacks in Houston.

Call-up imminent
Manager Joe Espada said that McCormick will be recalled from Triple-A Sugar Land prior to Monday's game in Cincinnati, Matt Kawahara of the Houston Chronicle reports.
Impact McCormick will likely stick around with the Astros for at least the entirety of the three-game series versus the Reds while fellow outfielder Jake Meyers is away from the team on paternity leave. Before he was demoted to Triple-A last week, McCormick had struggled to a .192/.256/.292 slash line with a 28.8 percent strikeout rate over 243 plate appearances with Houston.

Optioned to Triple-A
The Astros optioned McCormick to Triple-A Sugar Land on Wednesday, Chandler Rome of The Athletic reports.
Impact Although he hit a two-run home run in Wednesday's win over the Phillies, McCormick will head back to the minors in an effort to break him out of his slump at the plate. The 29-year-old entered Wednesday's contest with a .211 OPS in 44 plate appearances during the month of August and was beginning to see his playing time diminish. Now that he's been dispatched to Triple-A, more playing time in the outfield will likely be given to Mauricio Dubon and Ben Gamel.

Impact Though he hit a two-run home run in Wednesday's win over the Phillies, McCormick will head back to the minors as he looks to break out of an extended funk at the plate. The 29-year-old entered Wednesday's contest with a .211 OPS in 44 plate appearances during the month of August and was beginning to see his playing time diminish. Now that he's been dispatched to Triple-A, more playing time in the outfield will likely be given to Mauricio Dubon, Ben Gamel and Jason Heyward.

Playing time vs. righties drying up
McCormick is out of the lineup for Monday's game against the Phillies, Brian McTaggart of MLB.com reports.
Impact McCormick will hit the bench for the third time in the Astros' last four matchups with right-handed pitching. Slashing just .150/.224/.200 since the All-Star break, McCormick looks like he'll have to settle for a part-time role with Houston until his bat begins to come around.
