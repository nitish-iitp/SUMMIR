        "The Mets were on the good side in Game 5, notching a 12-6 victory on Friday in New York",
        "Flaherty labored through three innings, but L.A. replaced him with mop-up man Brent Honeywell Jr.",

        "The Dodgers could have rested Flaherty for Game 6 but opted to use him tonight, which means it will likely be a bullpen game against Sean Manaea, who had a great start in Game 2"
