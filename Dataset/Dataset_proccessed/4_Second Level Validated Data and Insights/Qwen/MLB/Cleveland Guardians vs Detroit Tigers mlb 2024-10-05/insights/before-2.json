        "The Tigers are fresh off slaying an October behemoth in their sweep of the Houston Astros and will look to continue their improbable run.",
        "The Guardians and their imposing bullpen are well-rested with what will be nearly a week between games.",
        "Tarik Skubal, who’ll win the AL Cy Young this year, was brilliant in his Game 1 start against the Astros, delivering six innings of four-hit, shutout ball.",
        "José Ramírez is a superstar who’s often underappreciated because of the market he plays in. The third baseman clubbed 39 homers, recorded 41 steals and posted 6.5 wins above replacement this season.",
        "Cleveland’s bullpen was by far the best in baseball with a 2.57 ERA. For context, the next best in the AL was the Tigers’ pen, which posted an ERA that was almost a full run higher (3.55).",
        "The Guardians give off late 90’s Yankees vibes — if they’ve got a lead by the seventh inning, it’s pretty much game over."
