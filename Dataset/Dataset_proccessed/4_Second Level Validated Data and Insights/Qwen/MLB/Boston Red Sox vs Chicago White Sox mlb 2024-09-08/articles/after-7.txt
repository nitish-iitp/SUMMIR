BOSTON — White Sox right-hander Chris Flexen can’t win, even when he’s good.

Flexen’s streak of winless starts reached 21 on Sunday, even though he allowed only two runs in six innings against the Red Sox. But the Sox’ streak of 20 losses in games Flexen starts came to a halt, thanks to a five-run ninth that gave them a 7-2 victory and enabled them to avoid a series sweep.

Dominic Fletcher made a diving catch in right field and threw out Jarren Duran at home before driving in the go-ahead run with a double in the ninth, which also featured a two-run single by Zach DeLoach.
