        "Altuve’s teammates mobbed him after Houston’s sixth walk-off hit of the season",
        "Espada said, ‘He’s got all sorts of pitches, he changes his cadence, he throws a lot of strikes to balls. When we’re aggressive, we’re swinging, and it’s starting down the middle, but it’s a changeup or a curveball. He changes velocity a lot. He’s got a lot of movement. He’s been around awhile. He’s been a pretty good pitcher.’",
        "Espada said, ‘Sometimes you’re just going to be human. He’s been outstanding.’"
