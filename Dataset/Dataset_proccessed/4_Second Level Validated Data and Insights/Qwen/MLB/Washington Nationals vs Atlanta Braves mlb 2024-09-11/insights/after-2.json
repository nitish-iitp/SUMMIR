        "Irvin faced the playoff-contending Braves four times in his first full Major League season. The result? A 2-0 record and a 1.16 ERA, punctuated by holding Atlanta hitless for 5 2/3 innings on Wednesday at Nationals Park.",
        "His 1.16 ERA against Atlanta is the lowest mark by a pitcher in Nationals history (2005-present) with at least three starts vs. the Braves in a single season.",
        "Irvin went six innings, allowing two hits, one run and one walk while striking out five on 84 pitches.",
        "In tandem with catcher Keibert Ruiz, Irvin delivered a pitch mix of 48 four-seam fastballs, 25 sinkers, 10 curveballs and one cutter.",
        "Irvin's fastball reached 96.6 mph and averaged 94.",
        "Braves starter Max Fried said, 'Irvin was throwing a really good game. He had a really good pace, really quick innings in and out, didn't allow things to snowball and kept it close enough for his guys to scratch together some runs and come out on top.'"
