        "The Washington Nationals had already clinched the season series with the Atlanta Braves by winning 7-games.",
        "Poor defense started the mess followed by some bad pitches.",
        "Jose Tena has an.869 fielding percentage this season at the MLB level, and has become a major defensive liability.",
        "The Nats need to go 8-10 or better to beat the 2023 win total.",
        "All but four remaining games are against teams with postseason aspirations — and that will make it difficult.",
        "Nats’ manager Dave Martinez went to Ildemaro Vargas to pitch the 9th inning and save some of his bullpen.",
        "The rest of the bullpen gave up at least one run each.",
        "This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward, and the plan is to get Trevor Williams back into the rotation and finish the final week-and-a-half of the season with a 6-man rotation."
