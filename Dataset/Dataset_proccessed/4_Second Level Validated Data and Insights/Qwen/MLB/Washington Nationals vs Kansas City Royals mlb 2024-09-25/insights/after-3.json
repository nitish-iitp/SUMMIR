        "Daniel Lynch IV worked 2 2/3 scoreless frames in relief of Lorenzen.",
        "Lynch has not allowed a run in 10 relief appearances since he was recalled from Triple-A Omaha on Aug. 26.",
        "Angel Zerpa, John Schreiber and Sam Long bridged the gap to Lucas Erceg, who completed his 13th save.",
        "That effort extended the Kansas City bullpen's scoreless streak to 15 2/3 innings over four games, and the pitching staff's overall scoreless run to a franchise record 26 innings."
