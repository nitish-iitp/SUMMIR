Heroes, zeros and the inside pitch from the Yankees’ 4-2 World Series Game 2 loss to the Dodgers on Saturday night in Los Angeles:  

Hero

Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched like an ace and allowed just a solo homer to Juan Soto over 6 ¹/₃ innings.

Zero

Carlos Rodon allowed four runs — and three homers — in just 3 ¹/₃ innings as the Yankees’ supposed rotation advantage has turned on its head through two games.
