        "Billy Cook lined a single to left to start the fifth and scored from first on a hit and run when Kiner-Falefa shot one to center past a diving Bobby Witt Jr. at short to put the Pirates ahead 3-2.",
        "Carmen Mlodzinski pitched a perfect fifth inning in relief of Pirates starter Jared Jones, who allowed two runs and six hits in the first four.",
        "Aroldis Chapman struck out one in a perfect ninth for his ninth save.",
        "The Royals, four games back of first-place Cleveland in the AL Central, had the bases loaded with two outs in the sixth. Colin Holderman walked Witt Jr. to bring in a run but Dennis Santana entered to get Salvador Perez to fly out and limit the damage."

        "Isiah Kiner-Falefa had three hits, including a go-ahead single in the fifth inning, as the Pittsburgh Pirates avoided a three-game sweep with a 4-3 win over the Kansas City Royals on Sunday.",
        "Billy Cook never hesitates. He never breaks stride, Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. We get a run on a groundball to center field just because of the fact of his awareness. Outstanding.",
        "In the fifth, (Singer) just kind of lost command a little bit there, Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. Unlike him. But overall, I thought his stuff was fine, just his command was a little bit off.",
        "We needed to capitalize more, we put a lot of pressure on them, we drove up the pitch count early, we had baserunners in several innings and just couldn't come up with the big hit to really take the lead or break it open, Quatraro said."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Bryan Reynolds gave the Pirates an initial lead on a double into the left-field corner after Kiner-Falefa led off the first with a base hit.",
        "Yuli Gurriel tied it 1-1 on a sacrifice fly in the second after Kansas City started the inning with a Paul DeJong single between two walks.",
        "Tommy Pham opened the third with a triple off the top of the Clemente Wall in right.",
        "Witt Jr. then flew out to Cook, whose throw home from right field beat Pham to preserve the tie. It came from near the line to the right of a No. 21 etched into the outfield grass on Roberto Clemente Day, observed across the majors."
