        "Since MLB introduced the 'ghost runner' rule in 2020, the Houston Astros have had a losing record in extra-innings games in four of five seasons.",
        "They were 2-7 in 2020, 9-8 in 2021, 5-6 in 2022, 1-8 last year, and 5-10 this season.",
        "That's a combined record of 21-33, which translates to a horrendous.388 winning percentage.",
        "In all other games during that span, Houston is 397-293 -- a.575 winning percentage.",
        "Since the beginning of last year, the Astros are just 6-18 in extras following their latest debacle against the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday."
