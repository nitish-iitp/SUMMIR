        "Lowe led off the third inning with a triple but advanced no further, as Junior Caminero, Josh Lowe and Dylan Carlson struck out in order.",
        "Jonathan Aranda laced a leadoff double to right and moved to third on Jose Siri’s swinging bunt out. With a contact play on, Ben Rortvedt hit a grounder to second and Aranda broke for the plate, only to be thrown out."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Getting swept for the sixth time this season was frustrating enough for the Rays. Feeling like they were in every game made it sting even more.",
        "The Rays scored twice against Wheeler on Walls’ second-inning RBI single and Aranda’s sixth-inning home run. But they finished 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position on the night, dropping their season average with RISP to an MLB-worst.214."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Shane Baz gave up a two-run homer to Nick Castellanos in the first inning, but found his rhythm in the second on his way to retiring each of the final 12 hitters he faced.",
        "Despite throwing only 78 pitches over 5 1/3 innings, Baz was lifted in favor of reliever Drew Rasmussen rather than facing Bryce Harper and Castellanos for a third time.",
        "Wilson hit a ball right in front of the plate. The Rays initially wondered if it hit off Wilson’s foot, but he said it didn’t. It bounced and rolled to the left of the mound. Rasmussen ran after it but pulled back his arm when he realized he didn’t have a play, and the ball scooted by Caminero as Castellanos dashed home to score what proved to be the winning run."
