Jose Quintana becomes Mets hero again in start of his life
By Mark Sanchez

Jose Quintana has pitched 11 innings in two clinching games this postseason and allowed zero earned runs.

The Mets could not possibly ask for more from a to-be free agent who is pitching as if he does not want this season to end — and ensuring just that.

Quintana was nails again, holding the Phillies to one unearned run in five innings of the Game 4, 4-1 win at Citi Field that sent the Mets into the NLCS for the first time since 2015.

Jose Quintana pitched another gem for the Mets in the NLDS.

Adam Amin might have gotten caught up in the moment when he declared the sixth-inning grand slam by Francisco Lindor the “biggest swing of the season” for the Mets. 

Lindor’s longball lifted the Mets to a 4-1 lead in the bottom of the sixth and Amin, on the play-by-play call for FS1, seemed to jump the gun with his description.

“Lindor toward right-center field, this one is back!” Amin exclaimed. “This one is gone! Grand slam! Lindor puts the Mets on top! The biggest swing of the season for New York!”
