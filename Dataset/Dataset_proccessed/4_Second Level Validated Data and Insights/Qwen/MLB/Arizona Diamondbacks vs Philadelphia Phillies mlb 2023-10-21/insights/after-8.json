        "The Diamondbacks, who already have advanced three rounds beyond their preseason expectation, victimized the Phillies' two best relievers late, overcoming a three-run deficit to win 6-5 and even the NLCS as two games apiece.",
        "Alek Thomas smashed a two-run home run in the eighth inning off Cooperstown candidate Craig Kimbrel and Gabriel Moreno lashed a run-scoring, game-winning double off Jose Alvarado, the Phillies’ best reliever.",
        "The story just keeps getting better by the day.",
        "The Phillies stand with the fourth-highest payroll and a collection of stars, both position players and rotation stalwarts, making them an obvious and overwhelming favorite in this series even before it began.",
        "The Diamondbacks, picked by almost everyone to finish fourth in the NL West (below the Padres and Giants as well as their forever nemesis Dodgers), do the little things. Which is great because they don’t do a lot of big things."
