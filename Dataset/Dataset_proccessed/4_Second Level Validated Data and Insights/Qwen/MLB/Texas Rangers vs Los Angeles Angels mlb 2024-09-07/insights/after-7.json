        "Brock Burke was DFA'd by the Texas Rangers less than a month ago.",
        "He rejoined the Los Angeles Angels and has shown improved performance since joining.",
        "Burke changed his positioning on the rubber from the third-base side to closer to the first-base side, which has helped him locate his pitches more effectively.",
        "He faced his former team on Friday night and allowed an infield hit but struck out Wyatt Langford and got Josh Jung to ground into a double play."
