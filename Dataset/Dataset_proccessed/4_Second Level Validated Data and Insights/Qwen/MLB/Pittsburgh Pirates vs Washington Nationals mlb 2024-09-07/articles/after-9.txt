14 SECONDS REMAINING

PITTSBURGH -- The shortest distance from PNC Park’s home plate to the Allegheny River, according to the Pirates' media guide, is 456 feet -- straight down the right-field line. That proximity to the water has created a tantalizing target for left-handed power hitters over the years, no different than the “splash hits” into San Francisco’s McCovey Cove or the blasts onto Eutaw Street in Baltimore.

For more than 20 years, hitters have taken big batting practice swings with their sights set on the river beyond the right-field wall at PNC Park. Many have tried, but only some have succeeded when it counts.

Here’s everything you need to know about the baseballs that have landed in the Allegheny River and the hitters who sent them there. Special thanks to the Pirates for their diligent record-keeping on this topic.

How many home runs have reached the river? 80, with the two most recent coming off the bat of the Pirates' Rowdy Tellez. He launched a baseball into the Allegheny on Aug. 24, 2024, against the Reds and on Sept. 7, 2024, against the Nationals.

How many different players have homered into the river? 50

How many of those home runs landed in the river on the fly? Only six, and Josh Bell (May 8 and 22, 2019) is responsible for two of them. The others were hit by Daryle Ward (July 6, 2002), Garrett Jones (June 2, 2013, making him the first Pirates player to accomplish this feat), Pedro Álvarez (May 19, 2015) and Cruz (June 22, 2024).

Have any of those ever hit or landed in a boat? Why, yes. Álvarez launched a home run between the fourth tower and the right-field foul pole that landed in a boat docked along the North Shore riverwalk on May 19, 2015.

How many home runs have the Pirates hit into the river? 44

How many Pirates players have homered into the river? 20: Rob Mackowiak, Matt Stairs, Matt Lawton, Ryan Doumit, Ward, Nate McLouth, Adam LaRoche, Jones, Travis Snider, Álvarez, Neil Walker, Gregory Polanco, Bell, Max Moroff, Colin Moran, Bryan Reynolds, Oneil Cruz, Carlos Santana, Joshua Palacios and Tellez.

January 8th, 2025

How many home runs have Pirates opponents hit into the river? 36.

How many opposing players have reached the river? 33: Lance Berkman, Todd Helton, J.D. Drew, Stairs, Jim Edmonds, Ward, Ken Griffey Jr., Mo Vaughn, Jeromy Burnitz, Prince Fielder, Jim Thome, Carlos Guillen, Cliff Floyd, Colby Rasmus, Tyler Colvin, Matt Carpenter, Matt Adams, Travis Shaw, Curtis Granderson, David Peralta, Derek Dietrich, Joey Gallo, Paul Goldschmidt, Christian Yelich, Josh VanMeter, Jesse Winker, Tellez, Juan Soto, Jake Fraley, Matt Olson, Daulton Varsho, Ryan McMahon and Joc Pederson.

So three players have homered into the river for and against the Pirates? That’s right. Stairs did so for the Cubs on Sept. 24, 2001, and then twice for the Pirates in ’03. Ward homered into the Allegheny River for Houston on July 6, 2002, and then for Pittsburgh on Sept. 7, 2005. Tellez hit his first on Aug. 14, 2021 for the Brewers and added three more in 2024 as a member of the Pirates.

And have any visiting players homered into the river twice? Yes, there have been three players to hit more than one homer into the Allegheny River as a visiting player at PNC Park. Olson homered once in 2022 and again in 2024 for the Braves, with both home runs traveling exactly 420 feet. Shaw homered twice with the Brewers, once in 2017 and once in 2018. And then Reds’ Dietrich bounced a pair of balls into the river in one game on April 7, 2019.

Who has reached the river the most overall? Previously in a four-way tie between Jones, Álvarez and Bell with four home runs, Cruz took full possession with his fifth home run on July 6, 2024.
