        "Devon Conway, Player of the Match: Special performance from the boys. Credit has to go to Finn [Allen], he gave the momentum for us. It's pretty special and I've seen him do time and time again. He's a young guy and he's fearless. The way Finn plays complements my game and it was a good surface to bat on. I felt timing the ball would give me the best chance for success. Victory over Australia on any occasion is a big up for us."
