Virat Kohli continued his golden run with the bat in the T20 World Cup 2022 as the Indian star hit his third fifty in the Super 12 during his team's crucial match against Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday.

Kohli smacked 64 off 44 balls, remaining unbeaten to guide India to 184/6 after 20 overs with KL Rahul 50 (32) and Suryakumar Yadav 30 (21) giving him helping hands against Bangladesh in Adelaide. Coming to the crease at 11/1, Kohli had gone on to 24 not out after 10 overs and India had reached 84-2 largely on the back of KL Rahul's 32-ball fifty.

Kohli also became the highest run-scorer in T20 World Cup history when he reached 16 against Bangladesh in Adelaide. The Indian batter went past Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene's total of 1,016 runs in his 23rd innings in the T20 World Cup. Jayawardene set his mark of 31 innings.

This World Cup has so far seen Kohli deliver three magnificent knocks in India's wins, with the first one coming against Pakistan where he got the team home. The other was a fifty against The Netherlands, which helped India set up a winning total.

Kohli, 33, recently said he was "paranoid about his privacy" after a stranger appeared to have filmed inside his hotel room in Perth. He also recently overcame a long batting slump to be in electric form in this T20 World Cup, leading India to victory over Pakistan with an unbeaten 82 and scoring another fifty in the next game against the Netherlands.
