        "India have dominated Bangladesh in T20Is, having lost just one match against them. However, the last meeting between these two teams at the T20 World Cup was a classic. The players don't forget such matches either.",
        "India ran into some problems against South Africa in their last match, with Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Hardik Pandya getting out trying to pull the ball, while KL Rahul and Deepak Hooda were loose outside the offstump. Only Suryakumar Yadav stood tall, finding little support at the other end as he tried to revive the innings.",
        "Bangladesh, though, wouldn't like to talk about Bangalore 2016, while India would like to believe that they have evolved into a stronger outfit these days. Still, Wednesday's clash has all the makings of a memorable contest given the stakes involved, and how the teams are coming to Adelaide after playing three matches each."
