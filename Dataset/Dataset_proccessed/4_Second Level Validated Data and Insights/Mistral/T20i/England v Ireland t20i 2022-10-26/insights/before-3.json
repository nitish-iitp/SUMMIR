        "England wobbled in their opening match against Afghanistan, where they were 65 for 3 in the 11th over chasing just 113 before winning by five wickets, a victory built largely on Sam Curran's brilliant death bowling as he claimed 5 for 10 in 3.4 overs.",
        "Ireland, who successfully navigated the first round for just the second time in their history by knocking West Indies out with a convincing nine-wicket victory, dropped their first Super 12s match by the same margin when they were outplayed by Sri Lanka."

        "This T20 World Cup has already produced some notable twists and turns, from Logan van Beek's snake-hipped celebrations as Netherland qualified for the Super 12s to India's thrilling victory over Pakistan at a fever-pitched MCG, an early exit for two-time winners West Indies and New Zealand's dismantling of defending champions Australia."

    "Others": [
        "England will want to address a misfire after their top four all failed to reach 20 against Afghanistan and the team managed just seven boundaries in all off the bat, including three in five balls to No. 5 Liam Livingstone.",
        "Ireland opener Paul Stirling looks in decent touch with an unbeaten 66 against West Indies and 34 from 25 balls as his team's second-highest scorer behind Harry Tector's 45 against Sri Lanka, but both will need more against England.",
        "These sides have only faced off once in T20Is, when their match at the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in Guyana was washed out in the fourth over of Ireland's run-chase with eventual champions England attempting to defend a meagre 120 for 8 and avoid bowing out in the first round.",
        "Ireland have beaten them twice in ODIs, however, including at the 2011 World Cup in India but, in winning 4-3 in Pakistan and beating Australia 2-0 (their final game was rained off) immediately before this tournament, England remain favourites.",
        "Form guide: England WWWWW (last five completed T20Is, most recent first); Ireland LWWLW",
        "Andy Balbirnie and Paul Stirling will be key for Ireland",
        "Alex Hales has a prime opportunity to rediscover the form on Australian soil that was key to his recall for England after three years on the outer.",
        "With rain forecast for the afternoon and evening in Melbourne, swing could play a part too, making England the happier side.",
        "Ireland are yet to win a match batting first in T20 World Cup history. They have lost six in seven games with one no result.",
        "England have hit a six once every 17 balls in T20Is since 2021, a record bettered only by India. Will this approach work against the big boundaries of the 'G?'",
        "Stirling averages just 24.64 from 17 innings at a strike rate of 120.62 in all World Cups.",
        "Jos Buttler on going with the flow: 'Watching the game here between India and Pakistan, there was certainly some quality bowlers on show but they certainly got some assistance... it's about seeing what's in front of us on that day. If the ball is swinging, can we use that to our advantage? If it's not, can we recognise that quickly and change plans if we have to?'",
        "Heinrich Malan, the Ireland coach, on using memories of Bengaluru 2011, or not: 'It's making sure that we understand the situation, the conditions, the opposition, use that as a competitive advantage that we know that they know that we know.'"
