        "The timing of the rain was unfortunate – one more ball and a Moeen six would have taken his side ahead of the score required",
        "England, though, can have few complaints. Their performance was below-par with both bat and ball",
        "Ireland have done this before, famously they beat England in Bangalore in the 50-over World Cup of 2011, but they are the second-lowest ranked team left in this competition"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "England’s tactics with the bat were curious",
        "With the required rate up around 10 runs per over, they looked to take on the long MCG boundaries, with Harry Brook caught off the spin of George Dockrell on the mid-wicket fence",
        "After slipping to 86-5, the rain came just as Moeen Ali had begun to wrestle some momentum back for England by striking 12 in three balls",
        "Ireland face Afghanistan on the same day at the same venue",
        "Friday’s encounter against Australia, who lost to New Zealand in their opener before beating Sri Lanka, is effectively a knockout game"
