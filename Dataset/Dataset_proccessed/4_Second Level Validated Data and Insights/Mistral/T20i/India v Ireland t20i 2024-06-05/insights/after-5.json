    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "India win the toss and bowl",
        "India captain Rohit Sharma’s reaction: 'We didn’t know what it would be like. It was all about getting used to the conditions which is why we wanted to bowl first. I don’t think the wicket settled down when we batted. There was enough there for the bowlers.'",
        "Ireland captain Paul Stirling’s reaction: 'It was tough. The toss played a pretty crucial part, with overcast conditions at the start, and the pitch offered a lot of movement. India bowled terrific lengths and we weren’t quite up to that challenge.'"
    ],
    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India captain Rohit Sharma’s reaction: 'I’m okay, just a little sore. When there’s enough in the pitch you have to stick to your basics, think about bowling in Test match cricket and try to hit those lengths consistently.'",
        "Ireland captain Paul Stirling’s reaction: 'We needed to put a bit of pressure back on the Indian bowlers but we kept losing wickets – everything we tried went up in the air. And they were outstanding.'"
