        "The poor drainage and lack of covers at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Florida has not led to good viewing as three games -- Sri Lanka vs Nepal on June 11, USA vs Ireland on June 15 and India vs Canada on June 15 have been washed out."

        "India ended their campaign with 7 points from 4 matches. India defeated Ireland, Pakistan and the USA before their final Group A game was washed out. In fact, Rohit Sharma’s men were the first team to qualify for the Super 8s from the group. USA stunned Pakistan to finish ahead of the former champions and sneak through to the next round in their maiden appearance in the tournament."
