        "Sydney Cricket Ground provides great edge to the batters and close to 180 can be expected score from the team batting first. The surface also provides true pace and bounce, and bowlers will need to ready themselves well to make a mark in the game.",
        "Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis were crucial at the top-order as both the batters played instrumental knocks in first two games. Dhananjaya de Silva also played vital knocks in both the games and team will rely heavily on him in the game vs New Zealand. Charith Asalanka's 38 off 25 deliveries was also key contribution from the side against Australia, but Bhanuka Rajapaksa, and Dasun Shanaka needs to step up as the going gets tough.",
        "Devon Conway-propelled New Zealand to 200/3 in the first innings with his brilliant 92 off 58 deliveries. Finn Allen delivered another noteworthy performance against Australia as he smashed 42 off 16 deliveries. New Zealand's middle-order stepped up against Australia and will be looking strong against Sri Lanka.",
        "James Neesham (26 off 13) also played superb knock vs Australia. Mitchell Santner and Tim Southee picked three wickets in the opening game and the team will hope similar performance from the squad against Sri Lanka."
