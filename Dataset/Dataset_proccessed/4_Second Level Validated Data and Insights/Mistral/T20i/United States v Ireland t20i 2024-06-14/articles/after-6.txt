Well, best of luck for the future. But your hopes were really dashed when you were bowled out for 96 against India and then beaten by Canada.

Contrary to popular belief, Pakistan didn't get knocked out because USA v IRE got rained off. They got knocked out because Pakistan lost to USA :) #USAvIRE #T20WorldCup

Ridiculous Super 8s seedings are pre determined, NO advantage finishing 1st or 2nd! Super 8s groups are:

Group 1
●India
●Australia
●Afghanistan
●Bangladesh

Group 2
●West Indies
●South Africa
●USA
●England/Scotland

Not many would have predicted them🏏🏆 #T20WorldCup

Group A fixture between the USA and Ireland has been called off due to a wet outfield.

Our hopes of reaching the Super 8s are dashed by the weather in Florida, as the game is abandoned without a ball being bowled.

Gutted, but we go again for a final time on Sunday.#BackingGreen ☘️🏏 #USAvIRE #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/47MhwnfNAJ
