        "USA look firm favourites over a beleaguered Ireland, languishing at the bottom of the table after a thrashing by India and a shock loss against Canada."

        "The track in Fort Lauderdale has been a batsman's paradise in its short international history. However, it will be under covers for more than 72 hours leading up to the game. Expect a soft and damp surface for the game in addition to overcast conditions, in what is rapidly turning out to be a bowlers' world cup."

        "The sunshine state hasn't seen much sun lately as the greater Miami area finds itself swamped with as much as 10-12 inches of rain in certain neighbourhoods. Several visuals of waterlogged houses and submerged cars on the streets of south Florida did the rounds on social media. While those visuals may foster US fans to morbidly hope for the game to wash out, it leaves Pakistan on a precipice. The equation is quite clear, a USA win or a wash out takes USA to the super 8 stage. Whereas a loss would leave USA at the mercy of the outcome of the Pakistan and Ireland game."
