IND vs ENG, Guyana Rain Prediction, T20 World Cup Semi-Final: India and England face off on the morning (local time) of June 27 in Providence, Guyana – 8:00 PM IST (10:30 local time) – for a place in the final.

Following a rain scare, the players are back on the field to get their warm-ups in as the showers come to a halt with the sun coming out in all its glory in Guyana.

The groundsmen have done a fantastic job to ensure that the marquee clash gets underway and the incredible drainage system has performed its task to perfection as the next inspection of the field is slated to be around 8:45 PM IST.

IND vs ENG Guyana Rain Forecast

In fact, the weather forecast in Guyana for the next couple of days is as bad as it can get. On June 25 and June 26, the rain prediction in the area is also very high. As per the weather forecast on June 27 there is, “Rain showers in the morning with thunderstorms developing in the afternoon. High 86F. Winds ENE at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 70%.”

India vs England 2nd Semi-final

India made it to the final four by virtue of topping their Super 8 group after beating Australia in their final Super 8 group game, thus putting Australia on the verge of elimination. However, irrespective of where India would have finished in the group, they were to play the 2nd semi-final, as pre-decided by the ICC – keeping in mind the timings for the Indian audience. India have played all of their matches in the morning local time, which is evening time in India.

England, on the other hand, finished 2nd in their Super 8 group, while South Africa topped the group with three wins in three matches. England needed to win big against the USA in the final league game and they demolished the co-hosts, chasing down 115 in under 10 overs. England’s march to the semis has been an arduous joinery, enduring losses against Australia and South Africa, and a washout game against Scotland, yet they found a way to make the semi-final.

IND vs ENG Guyana Latest Weather Update: Lack of a reserve day!

One of the most puzzling issues is the lack of a reserve day for the second semifinal.
