        "The Guyana National Stadium is a 20,000-seater venue on the outskirts of Georgetown, situated just off the banks of the Demerara River and a few kilometres from the coast",
        "Spinners have been quite effective on the ground, but there’s also been a bit in the surface for the quicks, with the highest score across the five games being Afghanistan’s 183/5 against Uganda"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "India have won every game they’ve been able to compete in, with the only dropped points coming from the abandoned fixture against Canada at a rain-soaked Lauderhill",
        "England, by contrast, have got here the hard way. A rained-off match against Scotland was followed by a loss to Australia right at the start of their campaign, leaving them needing huge wins and favours from elsewhere to reach the Super Eights. But they managed just that, qualifying ahead of Scotland on Net Run Rate",
        "In the Super Eight, a loss to South Africa meant England were sweating somewhat, despite already having comfortably beaten hosts West Indies. That win, and the nature of it, proved important, giving them a significant Net Run Rate advantage that they boosted further with a hammering of the USA to effectively qualify with a game to spare. South Africa’s victory over West Indies consigned them to second spot in the group, sending them to this semi-final rather than being the top seed in semi-final 1"
