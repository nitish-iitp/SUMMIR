        "Jasprit Bumrah (11 wickets) and Arshdeep Singh (15 wickets) will need to once again make early inroads against a powerful England batting line-up, filled with a lot of big-hitters",
        "Bumrah hasn't played much T20 cricket against England, taking seven wickets in four games in the last seven years",
        "England's openers Jos Buttler and Philip Salt are capable of destroying any bowling attack in the Powerplay",
        "Buttler has slammed 191 in seven matches in this T20 World Cup at a strike rate of 159, while Salt has hit 183 runs at a strike rate of 166",
        "The Indian spin trio of Kuldeep, Jadeja and Axar Patel will have their task cut against the trio of Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali and Harry Brook, who like to bat aggressively against spin in the middle overs",
        "England's most dangerous batter in the death overs is Liam Livingstone, who boasts of a strike rate of 151 in T20 Internationals",
        "If he gets going he could make a big difference in the last few overs, while all-rounder Sam Curran at No. 7 is also quite handy with the bat",

        "Experienced leg-spinner Adil Rashid has kept things tight in the middle with nine wickets at 6.7, while Chris Jordan has bagged seven wickets",
