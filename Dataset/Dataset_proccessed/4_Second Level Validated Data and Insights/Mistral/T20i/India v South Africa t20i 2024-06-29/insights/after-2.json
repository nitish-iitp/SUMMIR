        "Rohit Sharma: “It’s very hard to sum up what we’ve been through for the last three years. We’ve worked very hard as individuals and as a team. Today is a result of what we’ve been doing the past three or four years. Guys do understand when the pressure is on what needs to be done, we had the perfect example of this today when the back is against the wall what is required. We wanted this really bad, thanks for the management for helping us.”",
        "Virat Kohli, all the years he has played and the others played around him. I’ve played alongside Bumrah for so many years, I know exactly what he brings to the table but how? It is just masterclass. He backs his skills. Jasprit Bumrah to put it in one phrase is a class act. I am very proud of the boys. The fans are fantastic, from New York to Barbados, I want to salute them and also back home millions are watching us, this is for them, they have been waiting for a long time. “",
        "The trophy is his at last Out come the fireworks and the glitter and the champagne.And at last Rahul Dravid gets his moment in the sun, stepping down with a trophy – not a bad way to go."
