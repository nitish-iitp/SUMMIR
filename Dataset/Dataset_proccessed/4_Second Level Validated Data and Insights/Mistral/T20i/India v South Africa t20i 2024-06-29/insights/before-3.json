        "This is only the seventh T20 World Cup match between India and South Africa",
        "There isn't a lot to separate India and South Africa on bowling metrics: 56 wickets at an average of 15.21 and economy rate of 6.42 vs 59 wickets at an average of 15.23 and economy rate of 5.95",
        "But the batting is a different story. India average 25.80 and strike at 132.13 with six fifty-plus scores. South Africa average 21.90 and strike at 106.14 with three fifty-plus scores"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The final will be played on pitch No. 4, which was used for the games between Namibia and Oman, and Scotland and England. It's the fourth pitch of eight on the square, so neither boundary should be significantly longer than the other.",
        "There is a threat of rain over this final but it does have a reserve day."
