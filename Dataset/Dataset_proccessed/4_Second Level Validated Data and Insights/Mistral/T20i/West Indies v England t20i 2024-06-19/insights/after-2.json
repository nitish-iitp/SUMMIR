        "England scored 58 from the powerplay, while West Indies were not exactly free-flowing with the bat either",
        "West Indies’ problems started when they were inserted to bat, though. They were 40 without loss when opener Brandon King was forced to retire hurt with a side strain in the fifth over",
        "At 54-0 at the end of the powerplay, Powell would have hoped to get to 200 runs again—as they did against Afghanistan at the same ground on Monday",
        "Johnson Charles, Nicholas Pooran and Powell failed to build on starts and all perished in their 30s, as the West Indies tallied 51 dot balls",
        "And West Indies were 143 for 4 at the start of the 18th over, with Sherfane Rutherford on 1 and Shepherd 0. The pair contributed a valuable 37-run partnership, with Rutherford getting 27 of those runs",
        "England, who scored 58 from the powerplay, were not exactly free-flowing with the bat either. But they managed the game well and benefitted from a 97-run partnership by Salt and Jonny Bairstow"
