'Important to assess conditions'
published at 19:03 British Summer Time 3 June 2024
19:03 BST 3 June 2024

South Africa captain Aiden Markram: "Happy with the win. Credit for what we did in the field but the batting was a bit up and down.

"It was quite a tough wicket but we'll have to find some ways to score on this."

On the pitch: "It's a tough one from a batting point of view. You try your best to take the pitch out of it if one misbehaves, it's just one of those things.

"Hopefully we can take some learnings out of it and find ways to put the bowlers under pressure."

On adapting to conditions: "Lots of different conditions as you move around the tournament.

"We're fortunate that we have our next two here and have a decent idea of how it's going to play but important to assess as you move around and come up with plans."

On Anrich Nortje: " A fantastic day for him just from a mental ease and confidence point of view. He's massively loved in the changing room so I'm sure the boys will be incredible pleased for him.

"Hopefully it kicks on for a massive World Cup for him."

I'm worried for the game of the tournament - India v Pakistan - if it's played on this surface.

80 playing 80 would be quite something but it's not what we want to see or what the fans have paid to see.

Now the talk will be, "not great wickets in New York".

Sri Lanka captain Wanindu Hasaranga: "We did want to bat first, we were hoping for 160-170 but now we know it was more of a 120-130 wicket, especially with our bowlers.

"We know our strength is in our bowling and that's why we chose to bat first because we back ourselves to defend.

"We still have three games to go in the group. Yes, we wanted a lot more from today and perform a lot better. But I was very pleased with how our bowlers performed after the batting, we just need our batting to come together and we will be feeling confident."

'Everyone bowled really well'
published at 18:54 British Summer Time 3 June 2024
18:54 BST 3 June 2024

Player of the match, South Africa bowler Anrich Nortje: "Just to get some momentum going, we've worked really hard and it's great to get a result."

On taking a career-best 4-7: "Very happy. I've been feeling good, it just hasn't paid off in the last few games. It's great to finally get a result, some balls went my way but I try not to look too deep into it.

"It's a great win for the team, everyone bowled really well. Kudos to the rest of the guys as well.

"It's been a while since I've had those figures. Just happy to have pulled it off for the team."

On the pitch: "We didn't know what to expect from it, we'd heard one or two rumours about up and down. We were trying to assess it as quickly as possible.

"I think the guys did really well at the start, they were on the money and I came in later, tried to hit the wicket hard.

"I don't know if all the games will be like that, we'll have to assess again."

On bowling fast: "I find it quite hard on these drop-in wickets because of where you land and where you jump. It's a bit of a tough one but you try and find momentum.

"It's just trying to adapt as quickly as possible and find a rhythm. The plans were simple so that helped me."

Having been bundled out for 77, Sri Lanka then put in a brave bowling performance and proved that the pitch and conditions did certainly play a part in their performance - although it was still a poor one.

South Africa's explosive batting line-up couldn't get anything out of the pitch either but had the benefit of knowing that it was tricky, and focused on rotating strike instead of trying to blast boundaries every ball.

I loved it. The first innings was quite thrilling in its own way and when Sri Lanka got a couple of quick wickets it was "ooh, this isn't as easy as I thought it'd be".

The wicket was a bit of a heap in the end so it wasn't as straightforward for South Africa as we thought.

The conditions were very bowler-friendly and we were treated to some exceptional seam bowling from both sides, although Sri Lanka just didn't have the runs on the board to make theirs count.

Anrich Nortje was the star for South Africa in a complete bowling effort, finishing with a stunning 4-7 and that earns him the player of the match award.

Spinner Keshav Maharaj took 2-22, Kagiso Rabada 2-21 and World Cup debutant Ottniel Baartman took 1-9 from four remarkably economical overs.

You never know what another 20 runs would have done or if that catch off Tristan Stubbs had been taken. These are the ifs and buts.

Now the pressure is on Sri Lanka because this is a tight group. They will want to make sure there are no more stumbles so they can get through to the Super 8s.

It's taken them 16.2 overs to do it but South Africa have won by six wickets against their main rival in the pool.

A comprehensive victory in the end but not as comprehensive as you might have expected when they bowled Sri Lanka out for 77.

BREAKING

Clubbed down the ground for four by David Miller and South Africa get there in the end!

After bowling Sri Lanka out for 77, it took them 16.2 overs to get there but they'll take plenty from that result.

And there is the Heinrich Klaasen we know.

He slams Hasaranga down the ground for six and that totally eases the pressure.

He is such a good player of spin.

Heinrich Klaasen has been ripping up the IPL with 500 or so runs and a strike-rate of 180.

He's five off 12 balls.
