        "Pakistan won the toss and decided to bowl first against Ireland in their farewell match of the T20 World Cup 2024",
        "Captain Babar Azam said the decision is based on the ground conditions in Florida where it has not rained today, but the pitch has been under covers for three days",
        "Earlier, during the pitch report, Ramiz Raja shared that even though there is no rain, the outfield is still quite wet. He was joined by Waqar Younis who said that the groundstaff have done well to prepare the pitch, which has a few green spots that will help the pacers",
        "They stated that the pitch is a bit damp and soft which will make things difficult for the batters, adding that whoever wins the toss should look to bowl first",
        "Irish skipper Paul Stirling maintained that he would have liked to bowl first as well and will now look to put up runs on the board",
        "He added, 'Ireland managed to beat Pakistan leading up to the World Cup and did not go on to win the series, but this is a World Cup game and the feeling is different'"
