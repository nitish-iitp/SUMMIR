That's all from our side for this game. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. See you soon.

Kishan: I got to learn a lot from the last few matches. My intent wasn't great but here I tried to keep it simple. I think pull is my favourite shot and I was actually waiting for the ball to play that shot. Bigger boundaries is good thing as we get lots of gaps. My plan was to middle the ball towards midwicket and it went my way.

Ishan Kishan is the Player of the Match.

Rohit Sharma: When you play a kind of support that we play, these things [dips in form] are bound to happen. I know the mindset and ability Ishan has and it was very very pleasing to watch him bat today. He constructed the innings after six overs, that was more pleasing. It was not about coming and hitting the ball, it was also about finding the gaps. [On Jadeja] Very happy with him. We want more from him, that's why we sent him up the order and you would see more of that in the upcoming games. He is in good form, especially Test cricket, and we want to use that in limited overs. We will see if we can promote him up the order going forward. I love playing in big grounds because that's where you are tested as a batter. In Kolkata you can just time the ball for a six. We are dropping a few catches, which is not expected at this level. I guess our fielding coach has some work to do. We want to be the best fielding side in Australia.

Dasun Shanaka: We were really poor in all three departments. They batted beautifully and read the conditions really well. We are without our main spinners, Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana and the new guys are not very experienced. Hopefully, Asalanka carries his form throughout the series.

Time for the presentation ceremony.

This is India's tenth successive T20I win. Afghanistan and Romania hold the record with 12 successive wins.

Pratik : "I'm very happy to see Bhuvi returning to form. Miser with runs and chipping wickets"

Abizar: "Harshal bhai going to Australia for world cup"

Vishnu: "How unlucky is Sanju. Batting pitch, good momentum and he doesnt get a go. Tomorrow, it could be a bowling / pitch or chasing under pressure and he might have to come out.."

Chetan: "Decent outing for India, all players except Samson were in action!"

Shreyas Iyer: My start was slow but it wasn't easy. But once my eye got in, and once I got a boundary, I thought I would keep going. Ishan too was losing patience, so I told him to take his time and then he again started timing well. It's a huge ground, especially after playing at Eden Gardens. We had planned to run a lot of twos and eventually our every plan came off. I was trying to stay in present. I thought 180 would be a good total. I just focused on watching the ball closely and tried to time it well. I tried to bribe Bumrah [who was leading the side when Rohit was off for a bit] to give me an over but it didn't work (laughs).

10.20pm India take 1-0 lead with a thumping 62-run. It's a convincing margin in its own but when you realise India didn't bowl out their main bowlers, it appears huge. Chasing 200, Sri Lanka lost a wicket off the first ball of their innings and were five down by the 12th over. After that, India didn't use their main bowlers for quiet some time and gave a few overs to Deepak Hooda and Venkatesh Iyer. They were not very effective but Sri Lanka had an almost impossible task in front of them.
