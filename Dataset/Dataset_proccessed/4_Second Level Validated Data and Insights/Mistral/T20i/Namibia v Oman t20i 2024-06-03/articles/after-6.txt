NEW DELHI: Namibia triumphed over Oman in a dramatic Super Over finish to commence their T20 World Cup campaign with a victory at the Kensington Oval.
The closely contested match saw both teams ending their innings at the identical score of 109, necessitating the one-over eliminator. This was the second Super Over in T20 World Cup history, following the first-ever between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Kandy in 2012.

Ruben Trumpelmann, Namibia's South Africa-born left-arm fast bowler, made history by becoming the first player in T20I history to take two wickets with the first two balls of a match.
Trumpelmann dismissed opener Kashyap Prajapati and Oman's captain Aqib Ilyas for golden ducks, setting the tone for Namibia's disciplined bowling performance.

AS IT HAPPENED: NAM vs OMA | T20 World Cup 2024
Trumpelmann finished with impressive figures of 4/21, while David Wiese also contributed significantly, claiming 3/28. Khalid Kail was the standout performer for Oman, top-scoring with 34 runs off 39 balls.


In reply, Namibia faced a challenging chase as Oman's bowlers fought back valiantly. Jan Frylinck anchored the innings with a steady 45 off 48 balls, but Mehran Khan's exceptional bowling (3/7) kept the pressure on Namibia. The match ended with Namibia matching Oman's total of 109/6 in 20 overs, pushing the game into a Super Over.
In what was T20 World Cup's first Super Over in the last 12 years, Namibia's Gerhard Erasmus and David Wiese took charge, smashing 21 runs to set a formidable target for Oman. With Wiese taking responsibility with the ball as well, Oman's response fell short as they managed only 10 runs, securing Namibia's thrilling victory.
Brief scores:
Oman: 109 all out in 19.4 overs (Khalid Kail 34; Ruben Trumpelmann 4/21, David Wiese 3/28).
Namibia: 109/6 in 20 overs (Jan Frylinck 45; Mehran Khan 3/7).
