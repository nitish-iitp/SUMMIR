        "The match could be won and lost in the two powerplays. Trent Boult and Tim Southee, New Zealand's opening bowlers, have been lethal with the new ball since arriving in Australia, while England's top order is yet to fire. Finn Allen is the key wicket for New Zealand, as he can set the tone for their innings."
