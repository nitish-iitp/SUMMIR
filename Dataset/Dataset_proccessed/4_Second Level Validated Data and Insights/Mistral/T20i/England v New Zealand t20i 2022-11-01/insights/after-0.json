    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "When England woke up this morning to persistent rain and leaden skies, there must have been fears of another washout, which would have been almost terminal for their chances of progression.",
        "The clouds spent themselves by mid-afternoon and the perfect playing conditions ended up drawing a healthy crowd of 22,547 fans to the Gabba, 4,000 more than Monday's match between Australia and Ireland."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "England has kept its T20 World Cup hopes alive with a tense, 20-run victory over New Zealand at the Gabba.",
        "Daryl Mitchell was the guilty party the second time around as Buttler gained a third life for the innings, shelling a simple catch on the mid-wicket boundary when he was on 40 off Ferguson.",
        "Liam Livingstone's 14-ball cameo ended when he was clean bowled by Ferguson for 20, and Harry Brook (7) came and went in just three balls before being caught by Finn Allen off Tim Southee.",
        "Buttler's innings saw him move past former skipper Eoin Morgan as England's leading run-scorer in T20I cricket, with 2,468 runs.",
        "Stokes fell LBW to Ferguson for 8 in the penultimate ball of the innings, before Dawid Malan ran three off a poor piece of fielding in the deep — making 179 on the same used strip that Australia scored the same total against Ireland the day prior.",
        "The dangerous Allen was next to fall, skying Sam Curran to Stokes at mid-wicket.",
        "Stokes briefly left the field with an injury to his left index finger — the same finger he had two surgeries on in 2021 — but he returned two overs later.",
        "England were marginally ahead after the powerplay overs (2-40 to 0-48) and held that lead through 10 (2-66 to 0-77) — but New Zealand caught a huge break in the 10th over when Ali dropped a sitter.",
        "Phillips was on 15 off 10 when Ali casually shelled a sitter at mid-wicket off the bowling of Adil Rashid.",
        "He looked to capitalise instantly, too, smashing a huge six to long-on off a 152 kilometre-per-hour Mark Wood yorker.",
        "To rub further salt into the wounds of Rashid, Phillips slogged two enormous sixes when the England leg spinner returned to the attack, reaching his 50 off 25 balls.",
        "Stokes helped halt the avalanche of runs when he had Williamson caught for a run-a-ball 40 by Rashid, with Jimmy Neesham (6) following shortly after when he was caught by Curran on the square leg boundary off the bowling of Wood",
        "Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka kept their narrow hopes alive with a six-wicket victory over Afghanistan at the same venue.",
        "Sri Lanka must beat England on Saturday and hope for other results to fall their way in order to progress, while Australia will be relying on a Sri Lanka victory should they beat Afghanistan on Friday.",
        "Afghanistan are out of the tournament, but should they rally for a victory, or even a narrow defeat, coupled with an England victory the following day would spell the end of Australia's campaign."
