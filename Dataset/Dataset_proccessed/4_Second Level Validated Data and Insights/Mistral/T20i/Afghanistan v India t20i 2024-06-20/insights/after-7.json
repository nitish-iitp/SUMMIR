    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "India captain Rohit Sharma on the win: 'We adapted well and got 180, which was a great effort from the batters. We had class bowlers who defended it perfectly. Everyone came in and did their job, that’s critical and we dwell on it.'",
        "Rashid Khan on Afghanistan’s performance: 'We knew we’d be chasing 160-170 given it was against a bigger team. We could’ve done it had we executed smarter.'",
        "Suryakumar Yadav: ‘Lots of routine’ behind my success: ‘A lot of hard work and practice has gone behind this. A lot of routine and process. I’m very clear about what to do when I go out. I don’t mind giving this award to a bowler as well. First for a batter, hopefully the first of many.’",
        "Suryakumar Yadav is voted man of the match: 'No surprises there. His 53 off 28 came under trying circumstances, with India’s top order back in the pavilion by the halfway stage of the innings. The manner in which he shifted the pressure back on the bowlers with his stroke play and sizzle makes him a worthy player of the match. Another key contribution from him, following his innings against USA. Much like India themselves, Suryakumar is peaking at the right time.'"
