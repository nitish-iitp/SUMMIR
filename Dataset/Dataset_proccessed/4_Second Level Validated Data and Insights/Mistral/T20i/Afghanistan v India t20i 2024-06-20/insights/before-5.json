        "This January, these two teams produced one of the greatest T20Is ever - one that needed two Super Overs to produce a result - and that was when they were playing less-than-full-strength teams after the series had been decided. The stakes are a lot higher now.",
        "Afghanistan possess a bowling attack capable of asking questions every over, which works out well because they have to find a way past the experience of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli early to level the playing field.",
        "With those two out of the picture, anything can happen. That'll be Fazalhaq Farooqi's job.",
        "It takes a genius to beat a genius, and India are lucky to have Suryakumar Yadav, who has dominated Rashid Khan in T20s, scoring 86 runs in 58 balls at a strike rate of 148 without being dismissed.",
        "Shivam Dube goes at a higher strike rate (155) over a smaller sample size (18 balls), but that brings into picture the other advantage that India have: left-hand batters."
