T20WC 2024 Super 8 | AUSvIND: Upbeat India, under-pressure Aussies & the semis ticket
By Mumbai Indians | 23 JUN, 2024

The ultimate Super 8 clash is here. It’s Australia vs India. A T20 World Cup 2024 semi-final berth is up for grabs, and the winner takes it all in St Lucia on Monday (June 24).

India, with two impressive wins in two games, are high on momentum and confidence. They are determined to secure their place in the semi-finals by topping Group 1. What fuels this confidence? A significant 19-11 lead over Australia in their T20I rivalry. This match also presents an opportunity for the Men in Blue to avenge their heartbreak from the 2023 ODI World Cup final.

However, the Aussies boast a winning mentality in ICC white-ball tournaments. Despite a surprise defeat to Afghanistan, AUS has a marginal advantage in AUSvIND matchups in ICC white-ball competitions (12-10) and will look to give Rohit Sharma and Co. a tough fight.

What: Australia vs India

When: Monday, June 24, 2024, 8 pm IST

Where: Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia

What to look forward to: A classic AUSvIND battle, Jasprit Bumrah tormenting the Aussie top-order, Hitman making merry of the Australian bowlers, a sold-out Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium and that much-needed W over Pat Cummins’ Aussie team.
