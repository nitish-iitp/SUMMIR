        "This episode of Australia-India was always going to be spicy, because, well, it's Australia-India, and because November 19 and all that.",
        "This isn't a must-win game for either team, but Australia will be on wafer-thin ice if they lose.",
        "Rain threat in St Lucia",
        "Australia-India, then, and the stakes are as high as they could possibly be."
    ],
    "Team news: Starc in or out?": [
        "Australia played the extra spinner against Afghanistan, bringing in Ashton Agar and leaving out Mitchell Starc.",
        "They could yet continue with that combination - Agar featured in their one previous game in St Lucia, against Scotland, particularly with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli not too fond of facing left-arm spin in the powerplay, but given the nature of this contest, will they continue to leave out one of their most tried-and-tested match-winners?"
    ],
    "India (probable)": [
        "1 Rohit Sharma (capt), 2 Virat Kohli, 3 Rishabh Pant (wk), 4 Suryakumar Yadav, 5 Shivam Dube, 6 Hardik Pandya, 7 Axar Patel, 8 Ravindra Jadeja, 9 Arshdeep Singh, 10 Kuldeep Yadav, 11 Jasprit Bumrah."

    "Pitch and conditions: Pace on, runs on": [
        "St Lucia has been the most batting-friendly venue of this T20 World Cup in terms of both scoring rate (8.92) and average (28.76). Fast bowlers have struggled to keep the runs down here, going at a worst-in-the-competition 9.42, but spinners have done relatively better, returning a better economy rate here (7.91) than in both Dallas and Antigua.",
        "There is a good chance of rain in St Lucia, though, with forecasts predicting showers through Monday morning with the weather clearing up roughly between 10am and 4pm."
    ],
    "Stats and trivia": [
        "India have a 3-2 edge over Australia in their T20 World Cup meetings so far.",
        "Virat Kohli (4103) and Rohit Sharma (4073) are separated by just 30 runs on top of India's run-scoring leaderboard in T20Is.",
        "If they both feature, Agar and Arshdeep will play their 50th T20Is. Agar made his T20I debut in March 2016, while Arshdeep made his in July 2022. New Zealand's Ish Sodhi (51) is the only player from a Full Member team to play more T20Is than Arshdeep since his debut.",
        "Australia could find a way to bowl spin to Kohli and Rohit in the powerplay even if they leave Agar out. Offspinners have bowled effectively to them in the powerplay so far at this World Cup, with Mohammad Nabi and Mahedi Hasan getting through quiet overs. Kohli has scored nine off 12 balls against offspin in the powerplay so far, and Rohit nine off eight."
