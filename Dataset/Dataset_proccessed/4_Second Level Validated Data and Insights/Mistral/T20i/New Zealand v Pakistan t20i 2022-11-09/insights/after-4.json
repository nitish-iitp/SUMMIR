        "Having won the toss and chosen to bat, New Zealand struggled on a slow, dry pitch, making 4-152 thanks in no small part to an inspired rearguard innings from Daryl Mitchell (53 not out off 35) and Kane Williamson (46 off 42)",
        "Finn Allen (4) endured an eventful opening three balls, smashing a four down the ground, getting given out LBW — which he managed to overturn on review thanks to a thick inside edge — before Shaheen Shah Afridi completed the job with a gorgeous inswinger next ball anyway",
        "Devon Conway (21) and Williamson rebuilt slightly before Conway was run out by Shadab Khan",
        "Glenn Phillips (6) came and went, caught off his own bowling by Mohammad Nawaz",
        "Williamson and Mitchell put on 68 for the fourth wicket before the New Zealand skipper was bowled by a brilliant Afridi slower ball",
        "Jimmy Neesham (16 not out) came in to help New Zealand limp to 4-152"
