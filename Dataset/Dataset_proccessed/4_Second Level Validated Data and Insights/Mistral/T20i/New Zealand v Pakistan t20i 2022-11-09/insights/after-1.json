        "Babar Azam pays tribute to the crowd. “We are feeling like we're playing at home!” he says. “Everyone is coming and cheering for Pakistan team.” He gives the rest of the credit to his bowlers: “We had a good start with the ball, we have good spinners with Shadab and Nawaz bowling very well, and the fast bowlers finished very well.” Modesty forbids him to dwell on his own return to form, which came at just the right time."
