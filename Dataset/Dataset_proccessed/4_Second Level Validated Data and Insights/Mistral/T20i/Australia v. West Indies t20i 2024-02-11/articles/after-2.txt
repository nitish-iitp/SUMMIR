Maxwell equals record for most T20I centuries as Australia beat West Indies

Glenn Maxwell equalled the record for the most T20 international centuries with his fifth hundred in Australia’s 34-run victory over West Indies.

Maxwell drew level with India’s Rohit Sharma after a blistering unbeaten 120 off 55 balls at the Adelaide Oval which featured eight sixes and 12 fours.

He helped Australia post 241-4, their highest Twenty20 total on home soil.

West Indies finished on 207-9 in response as Australia clinched the series 2-0 with one match to play.

Maxwell was fortunate not to be run out on 10, but it was an otherwise near-chanceless innings as the 35-year-old unfurled his range of 360-degree hitting on a true pitch, capitalising on the short boundaries square of the wicket.

He brought up his half-century off 25 balls and then symmetrically reached his ton off precisely 50, slapping Romario Shepherd through the covers to reach three figures.

Australia’s total, their fourth highest in T20s, was never really threatened by the Windies- co-hosts of the T20 World Cup with the USA later this year- as Marcus Stoinis finished the pick of the home side’s attack with 3-36.

West Indies skipper Rovman Powell plundered 63 off 36 balls, while experienced all-rounder Andre Russell hit 37 from 16, but the tourists fell well short.

There was also a bizarre incident in the third ball of the penultimate over of the game when last man Alzarri Joseph appeared to be run out by a throw from Tim David to the non-striker’s end.

Australia’s players celebrated when they saw Joseph well short of his ground on a replay shown on the big screen, but were incensed when on-field umpire Gerard Abood said here had been “no appeal” made for the run-out. Television replays appeared to back up his decision, and the game continued. (BBC Sport)Watch live sports online
