The ICC Men's T20 WC East Asia-Pacific Sub-regional Qualifier B 2024 will take place from September 28, 2024 to October 5, 2024. The upcoming tournament serves as part of the qualification process for the 2026 ICCn Men's T20 World Cup. The Yeonhui Cricket Ground in Incheon, South Korea, will host the event in September and October 2024.

The tournament's champions will move on to the regional final, where they'll compete alongside Nepal, Oman, and Papua New Guinea, who received a bye due to their participation in the previous T20 World Cup, as well as four other teams from the Asia qualifiers and the winners of the EAP Qualifier A.

The T20 tournament features four teams: Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, and South Korea.

Japan secured two victories in their pre-tournament matches ahead of the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup East Asia-Pacific Sub-regional Qualifier B. They won a close contest against Indonesia by four runs and followed it up with a convincing 47-run win over the Philippines. Kendel Kadowaki-Fleming played pivotal roles in both matches, contributing key runs for Japan.

Trending

The tournament will feature 12 matches among the four teams. The team that finishes at the top, either with the most wins or a superior net run rate in the event of tied points, will advance in the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup qualification process.
