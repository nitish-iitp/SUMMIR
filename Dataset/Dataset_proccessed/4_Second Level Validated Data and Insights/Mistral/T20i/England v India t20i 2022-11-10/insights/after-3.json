        "England captain Jos Buttler: ‘The character we have shown ever since [the loss to Ireland] has been [excellent] and we put in our best performance so far, against top-quality opposition as well. We came here very excited, there was a really good feel around the group, and I felt everyone from one to 11 stood up today.’",
        "India captain Rohit Sharma: ‘It’s disappointing how we turned up today. We batted pretty well at the backend but we were not good enough with the ball. It was definitely not a wicket where a team should chase that down in 16 overs. With the ball we did not turn up. Knockout stages are about keeping calm and handling pressure and the way we started with the ball was not ideal. It shows we were a little nervy but you have to give credit to England.’"
