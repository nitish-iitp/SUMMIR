    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "England’s Jos Buttler and Alex Hales took on the world’s best-supported and most lavishly resourced side and toyed with them like a cat might a ball of wool",
        "India for example would have hoped to use their spinners to control England’s run rate but twice, against Axar Patel and Ravichandran Ashwin, Hales disabused them of that idea by sending a slog-sweep into the crowd",
        "World domination eludes India again in World T20 despite abundant riches"

    "Others": [
        "England’s decision to favour Hales as opener has been disputed but this was a remarkably controlled innings",
        "India’s poor performance was summed up by England completing an all-run four, vanishingly rare in this format, after Mohammed Shami fielded and tried to toss the ball to a teammate but missed",
        "Once the finish line hove into view Buttler sprinted for it; after scoring 45 off his first 34 deliveries, he added 35 off his last 15, including the six that ended it",
        "Though Virat Kohli scored another half-century it was Hardik Pandya, with a 33-ball 63, who was most responsible for hauling India to what appeared a reasonable total with a string of boundaries towards the end of their innings",
        "England’s three previous run chases in the competition were all uncomfortable but this was a team transformed",
        "England’s decision to chase was a vindication of Buttler’s decision at the toss",
        "India’s innings was both by some excellent bowling – Adil Rashid was outstanding, going at five an over and taking the key wicket of Yadav, and Chris Jordan replaced the injured Mark Wood and took three wickets in his first game of the tournament",
        "England’s three previous run chases in the competition were all uncomfortable but this was a team transformed",
        "England on the other hand had been positively salivating over the state of the wicket for three days and thought there might be more runs in it. Turned out they were right."
