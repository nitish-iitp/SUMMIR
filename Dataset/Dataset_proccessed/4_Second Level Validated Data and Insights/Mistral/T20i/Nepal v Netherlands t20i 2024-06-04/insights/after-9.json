        "Nepal's skipper Rohit Kumar Paudel acknowledged the Dutch bowlers for capitalizing on the early conditions",
        "Rohit Kumar Paudel added, 'We also lacked partnerships in the middle, which was the turning point of the game. Our bowlers performed well today, but they weren't supported by the fielders. It could have been a different game entirely if I hadn't dropped that catch. As a batting unit, if we perform better, we can expect improved results in the upcoming matches.'",
        "Dutch skipper Edwards commented, 'The pitch posed challenges, and our bowlers executed their plans well to restrict Nepal. While we would have preferred to achieve the target earlier, the chase became tricky towards the end. To progress further, we need to maintain consistency in our performances.'"
