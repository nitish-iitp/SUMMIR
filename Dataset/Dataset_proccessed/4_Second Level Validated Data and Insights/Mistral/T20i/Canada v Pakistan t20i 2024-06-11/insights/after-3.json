        "Pakistan's captain Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan starred as Pakistan stayed alive at the T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket win over Canada on Tuesday.",
        "Knowing defeat would condemn them to a shock first-round exit, Rizwan and Babar put on a match-winning second-wicket partnership of 63 as Pakistan reached their target of 107 with 15 balls to spare.",
        "Earlier, Pakistan restricted Canada to 106-7 despite opener Aaron Johnson hitting his sixth international fifty.",
        "Pakistan, the 2009 champions and runners-up in 2022, lost both their first two Group A fixtures.",
        "A stunning super-over humiliation at the hands of the United States was followed by a six-run loss to bitter rivals India in a game where they failed to chase down a modest 120-run target.",
        "Even a win on Tuesday at the same Nassau County International Stadium where they came up short against India may not be enough to secure a place in the second round Super Eights."
