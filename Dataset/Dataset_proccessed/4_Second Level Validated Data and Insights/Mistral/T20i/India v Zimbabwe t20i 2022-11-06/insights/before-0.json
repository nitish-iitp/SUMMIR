        "India have done well in the ICC T20 World Cup, winning three out of their four matches. They have clicked as a unit with the likes of Virat Kohli and Arshdeep Singh standing out with the bat and ball, respectively. A win would assure India of a place in the semi-finals as the group toppers.",
        "Zimbabwe, meanwhile, have blown hot and cold in the tournament. While they have lost their last two games against the Netherlands and Bangladesh, Zimbabwe's only win in the Super 12 phase came against Pakistan. While they will start as underdogs, Zimbabwe will bank on their pace attack to pave the way for a surprise win."

        "The pitch at the MCG is a decent one to bat on with the average score being 160. Most of the scheduled matches at the venue have been impacted by rain but the pacers have enjoyed the conditions, picking up over 60 percent of the wickets. Wickets in hand will be key, with the dimensions of the ground also bound to come into play.",
        "The game is set to take place at 1:30 PM IST.",
