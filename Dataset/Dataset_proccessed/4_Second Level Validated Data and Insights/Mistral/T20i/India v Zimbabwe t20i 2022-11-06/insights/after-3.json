        "Rohit Sharma: 'A very good all-round performance, something we were looking for. We had qualified, but we wanted to come out and play the way we wanted to play, which we achieved. What SKY is doing for the team is remarkable, just coming out there, playing that way, taking the pressure off the others. We know his ability, and it allows the guy at the other end to take his time. The dugout can really be at ease when he bats, and he's shown a lot of composure when he's batted. We expected this from him, and he's gone from strength to strength. The key for us will be to adjust quickly to the conditions. We have played a game there, but we need to adjust quickly. England are a good team, and it will be a great contest. We should take pride in qualifying, firstly, and if we play that semi-final well, we have another big game as well. It's about understanding the lines and lengths - the square boundaries are shorter - and executing well. The fans have been brilliant all this while, almost everywhere we have gone we've got a full house, and we expect the same in the semi-finals as well. On behalf of the team I'd really like to thank them.'"
