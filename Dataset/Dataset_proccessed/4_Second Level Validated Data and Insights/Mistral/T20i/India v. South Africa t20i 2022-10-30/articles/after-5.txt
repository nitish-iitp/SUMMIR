India vs South Africa Highlights: South Africa defeated India by five wickets in their T20 World Cup match here on Sunday. Suryakumar Yadav lifted India to 133 for nine with a 40-ball 68 after a batting collapse.

In reply, South Africa completed the chase in 19.4 overs. Aiden Markram and David Miller made 52 and 56 runs respectively, the latter remaining not out. Opting to bat, skipper Rohit Sharma was the first batter to get dismissed, following which India kept losing wickets at regular intervals.

Returning to the team at the expense of Tabraiz Shamsi, pacer Lungi Ngidi was the wrecker-in-chief as he ran through the famed Indian top-order with four wickets during an incisive spell of fast bowling on a pacy track.

IND vs SA: Rohit on India's fielding

Rohit Sharma: "We were a little poor on the field, we gave so many chances in the field and we weren't clinical. We were just not good enough. The last two games, we were pretty good in the field. We couldn't hold our chances, we missed a few run-outs."

IND vs SA: David Miller the IPL hero turns a national hero

Sriram Veera: AT the start of the final over, with India needing to defend 6 runs, Rohit Sharma would have an animated chat with the bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar over the field. Bhuvneshwar would do a mock-run-up to warm-up. Rohit wanted one more chat. More arm-waving from him. All set. Off ran in Bhuvneshwar to Wayne Parnell, who tries to get the strike back to David Miller with a little on-side dab but the ball rolled off the pad to the off side. Parnell wanders for a run, Miller says don’t be suicidal’ get back.

Next ball, a dab to the off, gets Miller on strike, needing 5 from 4. In the crowd, there ere prayers, some sitting tensed. In the middle, more chat from Rohit. 

The short ball gamble arrived and Miller swivelled into a pull and it flew off the edge to fine-leg boundary. Rohit winced and held his head.

And Miller finishes off next ball with a slice past point, roars, and punches gloves and hugs with Parnell. David Miller, the IPL hero, and now South Africa’ world-cup hero, He has allowed the countrymen to dream of that elusive ICC medal.

20:06 (IST)

IND vs SA: South Africa win!

Two fours and that'll do it for South Africa. One came off the glove, the other from the bat, but who cares. A win by five wickets with two balls to spare and the Proteas go on top of the Group 2 table with five points in three games.

IND vs SA: 6 needed off 6!

Six runs off that Shami over. SA need six more off the last six balls. Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have the ball to close this for India. David Miller will be on the non-striker's end. Wayne Parnell takes guard.

19:57 (IST)
30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: Rohitâ€™s Ashwin Gamble

Sriram Veera: Would Rohit Sharma do a Babar Azam and have the spinner R Ashwin for the last over? Or would he bring him on for the third-last over? He went for the latter. No luck. David Miller swung two massive sixes to long-off boundary. After the first six, Pant would yell out, “Time leke daalna,” (take your time). He took time, changed from round the stumps to over. Miller didn’t take any time to deposit over long-off. Ashwin would take out the Stubbs with an off break. Stubbs took the DRS and it would come as umpire’s call and Stubbs had to walk back, leaving Rohit to continue hoping. 

When Parnell came out next, Pant had another suggestion about where to bowl. “It’s 12 off 15, knock it down, pick singles, I am old school,” Shaun Pollock would say on air.\

Ashwin bounces back with another dot ball as Parnell missed the cut. Ashwin would then pull out off the next ball at release but Miller hadn’t left the crease. Another dot ball and Ashwin ended that over with three dot balls in a row.  Game on!      

19:56 (IST)
30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: Killer Miller at play, Ashwin gets Stubbs

India brought in Ravichandran Ashwin to bowl his last over in the 18th and David Miller went after him from ball one. Back to back sixes and the equation is in favor of the Proteas. Good finish to the over from Ashwin after coping the biggies as Umpire's call favors India with the spinner getting Stubbs lbw. 12 needed off 14 balls now.

IND vs SA: SA still the favorites!

End of Arshdeep's spell for the evening, 7 off his last over. Miller (34 off 36) and Stubbs (6 off 5) in the middle as SA need 25 off the last three overs with six wickets in hand.

30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: Miller six that punctured Ashwin's confidenceÂ 

Nihal Koshie: Two overs for 14, plus Ravichandran Ashwin could have had a wicket (Aiden Markram's) too if Virat Kohli had held onto a catch at deep mid-wicket. But Ashwin's day was just going to go from bad to worse. David Miller and Aiden Markram had come out post the break with the intention of going for the kill. Hardik Pandya's over - the 11th - had gone for 17. Ashwin gave away 9 in the next but Mohammed Shami pulled it back by conceding just 3. But Ashwin would be taken to the cleaners in his third over. He conceded 17 in the 14th over of the innings and the shot which would have deflated his confidence would be the 100-metre-plus six over long-off by Miller. The hard-hitting South African freed his arms and smashed the first ball of the over into the stands. On the last delivery, Markram cleared his foot and deposited the ball over long-on. Rohit Sharma now was left wondering who to get one tidy over from.

19:46 (IST)
30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: Pant takes over DKâ€™s keeping job. Is it a sign for next games?Â 

Sriram Veera: Is it the passing of the baton moment? Will we see Rishabh Pant replace Dinesh Karthik in the playing XI too as he would do mid-match for taking over the wicket-keeping duties? With just five overs left in the chase, Karthik pulled up with a injury and was unable to continue. All along India’s batting, Pant was sitting at the dug out with a large white towel over him as a shield against the chilly Perth wind. Now he had to walk in cold into a cauldron. He would take off Karthik’s cap, perch it on his head, and walk in with a smile. 

“I want to say that since we have Rishabh Pant, now is the time India need him. It felt as if Dinesh Karthik would get the job done, but factoring in the wicketkeeping as well, I feel that if India have that left-hander option in the team, this team would look complete,” Kapil Dev on said on ABP News on match eve. He might just get his wish soon.

IND vs SA - Captain's dilemma: Rohit misses easy runoutÂ 

Sandeep Dwivedi: After Kohli's dropped-catch over, came Rohit's missed runout over. Mohammed Shami bowled a heavy ball, David Miller didn't have room to free his arms. He blocked the mean and sharp rising ball close to his pads. The call for the single was not clear, Aiden Markram wasn't sure and slow to take off. Soon he gave up, as he was sure he was not going to reach the other end. Rohit now had a dilemma. Should he run to the stumps and dislodge the bails or opt for the safe underarm throw to hit the target. Maybe, it's this dilemma that made him miss the opportunity. Had he just gone with the flow and thrown, he might have had a better chance. Rohit wanted to pull out his hair, and Kohli in the background was picture of disappointment. Kohli tapped Rohit on the back, they carried on.

IND vs SA - Close call: Teammates see it differentlyÂ 

Sandeep Dwivedi: Lip-reading before a DRS call is an interesting sideshow. Mohammed Shami beat left-hander David Miller with a round-the-wicket sharp in-cutter. It beat the bat and hits the pad, Miller plonked in front of the stumps. Shami said “out hai, out hai”. Rohit Sharma is convinced, and goes for the DRS. Hardik Pandya, Miller's team mate at Gujarat Titans, jogs towards the group. The all-rounder throws a quizzical look at Miller. “Bat hai,” says Hardik. The skipper isn't convinced. “Nahi, bat nahi hai”. The huddle stares at the giant screen. The replay isn't too conclusive. But the umpires conclude that there was a blip when the ball passed the bat. The mid-pitch group disperses.  

19:28 (IST)

IND vs SA: Miller goes BIG!

IND vs SA: Believe it or not, Kohli has butterfingersÂ ðŸ§ˆðŸ§ˆ

Sriram Veera: Out it popped from Virat Kohli’s palms. His weight going back, he had another lunge at it. It dropped into his palms again. But popped out again. And he fell to the ground in anguish. More of the same emotion was on the faces of Rohit Sharma and the bowler R Ashwin whose carrom ball had Aiden Markram swing towards deep midwicket. Ashwin couldn’t believe what he saw, throwing his arms as if to ask , ‘how did you drop that?’ Rohit would hunch and hold his head. And Kohli began to walk with a wry smile.

IND vs SA - Inside edge: Was it bat or not

Sriram Veera: “If not for bat, was it in line?” Rohit Sharma would ask Ravichandran Ashwin. Around them, the Indian players were split into two camps at the LBW appeal against David Miller that they had referred upstairs: Those like the bowler Mohammad Shami, Dinesh Karthik, Rohit, and KL Rahul who thought there was no bat and it was a plausible LBW. And those like Ashwin and Hardik Pandya, who seemed to suggest there was bat. Rohit would shake his head at their doubts and wait for the big-screen replay. The snickometer would flutter briefly when the ball passed the bat and the third umpire ruled it not out. Rohit didn’t seem too chuffed. Neither was Shami, who hurled a rapid bouncer flying past Miller’s head.

IND vs SA: Pandya keeps the run rate in check!



Hardik Pandya catches the hard lengths vibe in his second over of the night. That's how the SA pacers wreathed havoc. The all-rounder might be the quickest India have to offer to the Proteas batters and he registered close to that 140 kmph mark consistently in the 9th over. Just two off it. 35/3, South Africa.

19:01 (IST)

Two lbw shouts sandwiching that Mohammed Shami over. One DRS but no wicket as just one run comes off it. South Africa, 33/3 after eight overs.

IND vs SA: Bavuma trapped in a web ðŸ¦‹ðŸ•¸ï¸

Sriram Veera: Bhuvneshwar Kumar vs Temba Bavuma was a mini-battle to be savoured for how the bowler was trying to work over his prey. In the first over, came a volley of out-swingers, shaping away from a length, and Bavuma kept poking inside the line. We know the recent Bavuma context: hurt that no South African franchise picked him in the new domestic T20, struggling for runs to prove them wrong but only ending up justifying those private moneybags' decision right. Out came the likes of Aiden Markram and coach Mark Boucher in support when the pressure turned so much that fans back home had begun to call for his head. The runs wouldn’t come though. 
Now back to the contest. Suddenly in that first over, he walked right across to shovel the ball over midwicket. Hmm. Next over, more of the same from Bhuvneshwar; lot of out swingers with one ball (the fifth of the 3rd over) that came in, which was defended. Next over, he nearly had his man with an away-curler from the stumps but somehow Bavuma managed to poke it to the off despite being squared-up. On air Dale Steyn was not only enjoying the battle but was also waiting for the nip-backer. It came, but started from the stumps and would slide into the pads, and roll away to fine leg. Steyn would have a chuckle. Clearly, he was relishing Bhuvneshwar’s work. 
The end came in the next over off Mohammad Shami. The one positive move of Bavuma this evening was that walk towards off to try throw the bowlers off their lengths. And so he tried it again but could only inner-edge it to low to the left of Dinesh Karthik who lunged to take a very good catch. Bavuma tried hard but couldn’t break free. Again.

Bavuma departs in the last over of the powerplay, trying to play a ramp shot but unable to connect as Dinesh Karthik completes the grab behind the stumps. Shami gets the wicket. SA, 24/3 after six overs.

IND vs SA: Arshdeep, the sultan of swingÂ  ðŸ‘¥âŒðŸ‘¤ðŸŽ·

Sandeep Dwivedi: Young Indian pacers have a history of getting excited when coming across pitches with bounce. Can't blame them, at home they are so used to bowling on tracks where the balls barely reach knee-high. Arshdeep isn't one of them. Lungi and Rabada had made the Indian batters look like "Indian batters on bouncy tracks." The left-arm pacer too has a nasty short ball, he could have followed the footsteps of the South African quicks. Made the openers smell the lacquer on the new fresh, new ball. He didn't let those temptations rule his mind. He stuck to his strength. He bowled higher up, giving the ball the time to swing. He got two South African left-handers. Quinton de Kock was out, edging the one that went away late. Rilee Rossouw, expecting a similar ball, was surprised with the one that came in. One caught in the slips, other lbw. Arshdeep is no copy-cat, for that one over, he was sultan of swing.

18:43 (IST)
30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: Biggie comes

30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: Arshdeep croons it full, gets swing to sing ðŸŽ³ðŸŽ¹ðŸªƒ

Sriram Veera: No pacer had got the ball to swing. Not many pitched it up so full to try to check as well as all the devil seemed to be living on the hard length. Even Bhuvneshwar Kumar wouldn’t leave that length in his first over. Obviously, South Africans needn’t need to abandon their pre-game plan. It was left to Arshdeep Singh to see what happens if you release the ball full. Oh yes it swung all right. The first one to Quinton de Kock swung away appreciably to get the edge to the second slip. Then came the real beauty to Rilee Rossouw: it swerved out a touch as it left his hand, and started its inward drift. It kept coming in and unsurprisingly beat Rossouw now to trap him on the back thigh. The umpire turned down the appeal but Rohit Sharma, after a chat with Dinesh Karthik, referred it upstairs to get what Arshdeep deserved for his courage to test out the potential of swing at Perth.

IND vs SA: DK the finisher, doesn't get started ðŸŽï¸ðŸ›´ðŸ˜”

Abhishek Purohit: India value Dinesh Karthik so much as a specialist finisher that they have at times promoted Axar Patel to bat out the middle overs, and held the wicketkeeper-batsman back for the death. There was no Axar today, but did the thought of using the pretty competent Ravichandran Ashwin as a middle-overs shield cross their mind? It would have been a stiff ask nevertheless to send the off-spinner in to face some chin music from the South Africans. Instead, Karthik found himself in during the ninth over itself, with more than half the innings left. He is known to be stronger against pace than spin, and half the deliveries he faced were to be from Keshav Maharaj and Aiden Markram, of which he would manage to score just four singles. He chose the left-arm angle of Wayne Parnell to try and break free, but immediately holed out.

18:19 (IST)
30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: Sun rise arc: anywhere between fine leg and long off - anti-clockwise. ðŸ›ŸðŸ’«

Sandeep Dwivedi: Late in his innings, Suryakumar Yadav hit a "tennis down the line forehand" off Kagiso Rabada that crossed the long-off boundary. It was very tough to pull off shot, something Surya wasn't known to hit, back in the day. Gautam Gambhir has known Surya since the time he was one among the many batsmen that Mumbai produces annually. He was good, but not great. In 2014, Surya had joined KKR, the year Gambhir led them to the title. Manish Pandey was the flavour of that season. As for Surya he was a struggler. Before the game, Gambhir commented on the Surya of KKR days. Surya had a limited off-side play, he couldn't hit over mid-off or point, he said. And it was only after he "trained out of his skin", he became someone who can now hit anywhere between fine leg and long off - anti-clockwise. It was only in 2018, he realised that he needs to be smart in training and not go through the motions. Off-side play would become he would focus on. He would change his diet too. And with time, Surya became SKY, the batter with magical off-side strokes.

30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA - The Surya cut: width out of thin air âœ‚ï¸ðŸ”–

Abhishek Purohit: Suryakumar has wide-ranging set-ups for the cut shot. The open stance, an ability to remain motionless until the very last instance, and then explode with tremendous agility and whiplash bat-speed helps him cut even balls on middle and leg stump for four. He rarely gets across on the front foot, instead tapping it straight down the crease and rocking back to generate momentum, thus cutting down on the need for width from the bowler. Or he can whip the back leg across late to create space for the bat to come down upon tighter lines. To Keshav Maharaj, he remained dead-still till the ball arrived on middle and leg, and this time, he used his flexibility to arch back and slash it between the wicketkeeper and short third man for four.

18:09 (IST)
30 OCT 2022
IND vs SA: End of innings!

And that will be that. Early wickets put India on the backfoot and South Africa's pacers never gave them an opening to come back into this match. Barring that freak of an innings from Suryakumar Yadav (68 off 40), which really was against the run of play. 

End of the innings for India. 133/9, with Mohammed Shami being run out in the last over.

IND vs SA: Was Pant a better punt? ðŸ¤”ðŸ«¥

Sriram Veera: If counter-attacking was India’s plan, then why would they not have Rishabh Pant instead of Deepak Hooda? The variation of left-hander, the natural aggressive instincts; plus he doesn’t have to rev himself to counter-attack, for that’s his way. Did the bowling of Hooda, the off-spinner, push his case forward, which on this pitch does look a bit of a strange option. Hooda tried to counterattack and unsurprisingly fell, choosing the wrong shots for wrong balls. It’s not to say that Pant would have come off successful but he was a better punt. There he was sitting at the dug-out, with a white towel on his shoulder, and joking around with Kohli. On match eve, he had joked aloud at nets that he would bat for hours as he was not going to get a chance at the game.

IND vs SA - Rabada: catcher in the fly ðŸŽ ðŸš€

Sandip G: The Kagiso Rabada catch-counter would cruelly read thus: Caught 2; dropped one. The one he dropped was off his own bowling when Rohit Sharma check-drove him in the air and the ball deflected off his thumb. But he made quick amends, first with a well-judged catch of Virat Kohli, wherein he carefully maintained his balance when running alongside the boundary-line to complete the catch, side-on, which made his judgement of the flight all the more remarkable. The natural athleticism and cool head made it look simpler than it actually was. His athleticism and judgement shone more spectacularly when he charged and flung forward to pounce on a dipping catch from Hardik Pandya’s bat. Everything about the catch was smooth—from the take-off to the short sprint and the forward thrust.

IND vs SA: Kamikaze approach lets SA hold back spin ðŸŒªï¸ðŸŽ‹ðŸ‚

Abhishek Purohit: Five of India’s top seven have played Test cricket, the other two have solid first-class records. The way four of them went out in kamikaze manner, it seemed they just did not want to give their defensive techniques any chance to hang around a little longer on the spicy Perth pitch. Many times, sides aggressively push for a higher score than par on a difficult wicket and end up way below par, when a more circumspect approach with the bat, which Pakistan regularly employ, may have given them a par total and an even chance for their bowlers to try and defend it.

This Indian team under Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid has consciously taken more risks with the bat than before when setting a target – and that has indeed brought them appreciation if not the big results yet. But in these extreme conditions, sticking to that approach at all costs came out as little more than a futile statement of intent. It also allowed South Africa to hold the spinner back until India were down to the last specialist batting pair.

IND vs SA: St Lungi and his charming menace ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜¼

Sandip G: Lungi Ngidi gazed deeply into the Perth sky, like a philosopher searching for the deeper meanings of life. Here, though, he had bounced out the best of India’s batsmen and, in a sense, found profound meaning of the night. He then folded his hands, as a thanksgiving gesture, and smiled reluctantly before he was swarmed by his colleagues. On all four instances he picked up a wicket, his celebrations were muted. When he ejected Rohit Sharma, he just stopped in his follow through and mechanically threw the ball back to the umpire. He offered regular handshakes with his chums, as if nothing had happened. KL Rahul’s scalp was met with an apologetic smile. When he nailed Hardik Pandya with another short ball, he produced a sardonic smile. Of all the virtues that he demonstrated, level-headedness shone the brightest.

IND vs SA: Wicket number six!



Parnell strikes as Dinesh Karthik mistimes a pull off a short one. Just when it looked like these two could get India to 150, the partnership is broken. The run rate pressure piling up and India lose another batter. Ashwin comes in, 105/6 after 16 overs.

IND vs SA: Fifty for SKY

Fifty for Suryakumar Yafav. This has been such fine a crucial innings from him so far. Hundred up for India. 101/5 after 15 overs.

IND vs SA: Another good over for SA

Aiden Markaram comes into the attack and keeps the run rate in check. India still very much on the back foot in Perth. Anything short of a 150 doesn't seem to be enough against a batting lineup laden with big hitters. Only five off the over. India, 89/5 after 14 overs.

IND vs SA: The New Zulu: Ngidi from panic stricken to glorious attacker ðŸ¦¹ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸ðŸŒº

Sandeep Dwivedi: South African pacer Lungi Ngidi once had a very scary Indian experience. Back in 2015, he was in India for a Universities World Cup. The games were in Dehradun and that saw the teams taking the busy narrow hilly roads on most days. On one such trip, on the foothills of the Himalayas, the young “Gentle Giant” had a panic attack. With a lot of honking around on the sinuous, vertiginous route with traffic jams, Lungi, not used to such noise back home, would suffer a panic attack and thought he was going to die. Those on the tour say the young boy was screaming and going crazy as he lay on the floor of the bus as he couldn’t take it anymore. Since then the tables have turned. His Test debut was against India at Centurion. And now at this very important World T20, he had the Indians on the hop. Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli the Big Three had fallen to the tall boy who speaks Zulu at home. Someone by the same name almost won a World Cup for South Africa, will this Zulu finally take South Africa all the way? A proper Protea.

IND vs SA: How do you pronounce your name Nortje? Like Nokia-head-out ðŸ¥ŠðŸ§ ðŸ“±ðŸ—¯ï¸

Devendra Pandey: Around three Indian journalists separately went and asked South African pacer Anrich Nortje, how he pronounces this surname. Most of the world pronounces him as Nortje, however, when it came to pronunciation he said it's N-O-K-I-A. Remember the famous phone company. "Everywhere I go, especially in the sub-continent they pronounce it wrongly but I have given up. I have to leave it to people to pronounce it whatever they like," Nortje said with a big smile. Just say it quickly, like the South African pacer's fastest ball of all time recently.

IND vs SA: Best over for India so far

SKY comes down the track and dispatches one over Keshav Maharaj for a six. 11 off the over, most profitable for India so far. 84/5 after 13 overs.

IND vs SA: Nah, it ain't easy vs this pace attack

Rabada comes back into the attacks and this seems to be working out all too well for South Africa. Almost protecting the spinner's quota by sandwiching it between the pacers doing their thing. Only six off his third over. India, 73/5 with eight overs to go.

IND vs SA: In comes the sole spinner!

Suryakumar Yadav cuts the first ball of Keshav Maharaj's spell for a four. Good comeback from the bowler with just three conceded off the next five deliveries. With the pacers breathing fire, the men in blue's approach off Maharaj could be decisive here. India, 67/0 after 11 overs.

IND vs SA: Low-rev & Hardik: perils of mindless counter-attackÂ  ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¥ŠðŸªƒ

Sriram Veera: Counterattacking isn’t bad; especially when your top order is gone, the pitch looks pretty spicy, and you don’t feel it’s going to relent anytime either. It’s obviously something Indian team has spoken about presumably, going by some of the shots attempted. Four of the five batsmen have fallen, going for their shots. They perhaps thought it needed someone to throw a punch or two back to see what happens. Two already fell, trying to do that: Rohit and Kohli. But Deepak Hooda, brought in to replace Axar Patel, also tried the same tactic. 
It was the kicker from a length outside off stump. Hooda stayed beside the line, and threw his arms at it. He missed. Next ball, he succeeded in edging a similar delivery to the keeper. “The white ball is flying and it’s flying anywhere,” Ravi Shastri would boom shortly. 
And so did Hardik Pandya. It was the chest-high bouncer from Lungi Ngidi and Pandya went for the pull off his third ball. Much like all the batsmen before, he couldn’t control it. It flew off the top edge and he still might have got away but for that man Kagiso Rabada. Off he charged and then threw in a dive to take a beauty. Pandya would stand there and wince. He might well “blame” the fielder but his shot too didn’t have much legs to stand on.

IND vs SA: The SKY won't come down!

Suryakumar Yadav uses the pace off Anrich Nortje and whips it backward of square on the on-side for a six. A clear show of intent despite the wickets falling at the other end. India, 60/5 after 10 overs.

IND vs SA: Thunderbolt comes snarling inÂ  ðŸ’«ðŸ«£

Abhishek Purohit: This was similar to the way Virat Kohli had fallen in India’s warm-up game against Australia too – failing to control a hook and being taken at fine leg. It is almost always difficult to control the shot, but on smaller Indian grounds, batsmen can often get away as top-edges sail over the boundary. Not in Australia, and certainly not in Brisbane and Perth with the large square boundaries. Against Australia, Kohli had tried to fetch Mitchell Starc’s bouncer a bit away from the body. Against South Africa, Lungi Ngidi’s short ball came snarling into him instead.  He still went through with the shot, and fell to a sharp, running take by Kagiso Rabada on the edge of the fine-leg boundary.

IND vs SA: Learnt nothing from captain ðŸ‘¨ðŸ»â€âœˆï¸ðŸ§Ÿâ€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

Sriram Veera: Virat Kohli didn’t learn from Rohit Sharma’s dismissal. He had hit two fours in Lungi Ngidi’s over but they were more conventional shots. As in, the first was a delightful on-the-up punch against a ball that bounced just right for that. The follow-up delivery was a full one on the legs, easily whipped through the onside. But the fifth ball was the fast bouncer. Rohit had already fallen to it in the previous over. Kohli went for the pull, weight still on the front foot, but it had leapt too quickly at him for him to control it. Unsurprisingly, it flew off the top edge to fine-leg where Kagiso Rabada, one of the fluent movers among pacers in the world cricket, ran across to his right to pouch a lovely catch, making it pretty easy.

How to bat and bowl at the tennis-ball pacy bounce at Perth? Who is India’s matchwinner with the ball and bat?

As crazily tight as the game against Pakistan was, India’s first serious test of batting technique would come on Perth pitch against South Africans on October 30. It required a touch of genius from Virat Kohli to make the Pakistani pacers bleed (even Hardik Pandya was unable to get going against pacy bounce), but the pitch at MCG is still no match to the bounce we have seen at Perth. South Africa is also loaded with good pacers to exploit the steep tennis ball bounce. Indians did land up in Australia early and chose Perth as their training camp; we shall know soon if that comes in handy now against pace.

It’s been the theme of the tournament so far: Hard lengths from the pacers. Consider this stat: Out of the 389.3 overs bowled in the Super 12 thus far, there have been 157.1 overs of dot balls. 943 balls of either tuk-tuk or beaten or left alone. Sachin Tendulkar had warned against disregarding singles and being thwarted in the ambition of big hits. [Read Full Article]
