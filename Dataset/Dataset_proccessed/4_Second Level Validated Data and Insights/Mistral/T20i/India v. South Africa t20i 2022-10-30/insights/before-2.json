        "India will take on South Africa in a crunch Group 2 encounter at the Perth Stadium on Sunday. While an India win would more or less help India cement their position in the semifinal after wins over Pakistan and The Netherlands, a defeat would extend their wait for a guaranteed spot in the semis. South Africa, meanwhile, would feel that they were unlucky to miss out on a point when their game against Zimbabwe ended without a result due to rain but did put on a dominating show against Bangladesh in their second fixture."
