        "Suryakumar Yadav (68* off 26 balls) is the Player of the Match. Says that some of his shots are predetermined but most of the time, you have to bat in the present. Shares that the pitch was on the slower side and he wanted to express himself and up the tempo of the innings. Adds that you have to be flexible and ready to play at any position, and he has been doing it for some time now"
