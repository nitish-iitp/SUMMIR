A magnificent century from Ireland opener Ross Adair and an opening stand of 137 with captain Paul Stirling propelled Ireland to an impressive total of 195-6 and a first ever T20I victory, by 10-runs, against South Africa in the second and final T20 International at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Sunday evening.

Ireland’s all-round performance was magnificent but South Africa’s was dismal, the bowling erratic and the batting decision-making in the closing stages of the run-chase chaotic.

Reeza Hendricks and Matthew Breetzte both made 51 to set up a victory platform at 157-3 with four overs remaining but the ‘home’ side were sublimely skilled and wrecked the run-chase with a series of smart field settings and clever bowling plans.

Seamer Mark Adair was instrumental in the victory with 4-31 from his four overs although left arm spinner Matt Humphreys (1-31) and seamer Graeme Hume (3-25) were outstanding in their four overs.

Adair was given a costly life on 19 and made the most of his fortune with just the third T20I century for his country following in the footsteps of Kevin O’Brien and current captain Stirling who contributed a rasping 52 from just 31 balls with seven fours and a six.

Right hander Adair received a chest-high full toss from Wiaan Mulder on 93 which he heaved over square leg for six leaving him with 99 and the luxury of a free-hit to complete his century from 57 balls with the next delivery before heaving his 58th to Matthew Breetzke at deep square leg.

Rickelton’s quickfire 36 from 22 balls included a four and four sixes before he miscued a pull to square leg while Hendricks’ innings of 51 ended after 32 balls (6x4, 1x6) when a checked drive was caught by Stirling at short cover.

Captain Aiden Markram (8) missed a reverse sweep against left arm spinner Humphreys and was bowled to trigger an extraordinary collapse from 157-3 to 185-9. Mark Adair was the outstanding bowler with 4-31 from his four overs but Jo’burg born Graham Hume (4-0-25-3) was brilliant in delivering death over deliveries to thwart the off-side skills of Breetzke, in particular.

Dashing footwork and quick hands brought Adair five fours and nine sixes with all of the Proteas attack suffering apart from Lungi Ngidi (4-0-23-1) who was back to his parsimonious best.

Stirling departed when an attempted upper-cut against Patrick Kruger (1-31) landed in the gloves of ‘keeper Ryan Rickelton and Ireland were unable to capitalise on a foundation which promised a total well in excess of 200.

George Dockrell finished unbeaten on 20 from 13 balls with just a single boundary and nobody in the lower order was able to provide the finishing momentum required in the final overs.

Adair’s record-breaking innings should have ended on 19 when he top-edged a pull to square leg only to be reprieved by Lizaad Williams’ no-ball. Dockrell, too, was reprieved on seven when Bjorn Fortuin’s relaxed catch off Mulder at deep square was over-ruled by the third umpire when the ball appeared to have hit the grass as well as his fingers.

Williams (4-0-35-1) and Mulder (4-0-51-2) were far from their best while spinners Fortuin (2-0-24-0) and Nqaba Peter (2-0-29-0) suffered badly at the hands of the openers once the foundation had been laid.

South Africa comfortably won the first match at the same venue by eight-wickets chasing down Ireland’s 171-8 in just 17.4 overs with openers Rickelton (76) and Hendricks (51) adding 136 for the first wicket to all but secure the win and move to a 6-0 record against Ireland in all T20Is. That record is now 6-1.

IRELAND: Paul Stirling (captain), Ross Adair, Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, Neil Rock (wkt), George Dockrell, Mark Adair, Fionn Hand, Matthew Humphreys, Ben White, Graham Hume.

SOUTH AFRICA: Ryan Rickelton (wkt), Reeza Hendricks, Matthew Breetzke, Aiden Markram (captain), Tristan Stubbs, Wiaan Mulder, Patrick Kruger, Bjorn Fortuin, Nqaba Peter, Lizaad Williams, Lungi Ngidi.
