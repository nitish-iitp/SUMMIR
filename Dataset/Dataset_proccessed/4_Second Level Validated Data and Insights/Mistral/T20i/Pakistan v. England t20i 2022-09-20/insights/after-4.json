        "England debutant Luke Wood finished with 3 for 24",
        "In response, Hales was the glue that held England's chase together",
        "Three of his first seven balls went to the rope",
        "Hales only managed one boundary with the field out between the seventh and 14th overs",
        "Hales was dropped in the deep by Shan Masood looking to manufacture a slog-sweep off Qadir",
        "With 52 needed from 36, Brook and Hales suddenly clicked into gear",
        "Babar made 68 runs in six innings at the Asia Cup",
        "Rizwan was busy looking for singles and Babar stroked his first ball through the covers",
        "Moeen Ali was smoked over long-on as Rizwan went to a 32-ball fifty",
        "First Babar was unstitched by Adil Rashid's googly",
        "Haider Ali, playing his first T20I in nine months, struggled to get going before holing out off Sam Curran",
        "When Masood, on T20I debut at No. 4, top-edged a reverse-sweep to the edge of the ring for 7 off seven balls",
        "Once again, Pakistan's top three made more than two-thirds of the team's runs - in this case 69%",
        "Usually charged with the new ball in search of early swing, Wood was instead first change",
        "Wood brought a few mph extra pace to the equation - as well as the confidence of an impressive season in the Hundred, where he led the attack for eventual champions, Trent Rockets",
        "Wood was first change, conceded just 12 runs from his two overs in the powerplay",
        "When he returned later in the innings, he produced a beauty to clean up Mohammad Nawaz for his first international wicket",
        "Just four runs came off the 18th over and although he started the 20th with a full toss that sailed for six, a sequence of W-1-W-dot-1 meant England finished in confident mood"
