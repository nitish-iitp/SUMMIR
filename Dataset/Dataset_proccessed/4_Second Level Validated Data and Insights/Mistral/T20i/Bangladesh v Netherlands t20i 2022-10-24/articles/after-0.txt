Bangladesh vs Netherlands Highlights, T20 World Cup 2022

Bangladesh vs Netherlands Highlights, T20 World Cup 2022: Taskin Ahmed led Bangladesh's charge as they beat Netherlands by 9 runs in a low scoring Super 12 encounter of the T20 World Cup in Hobart on Monday. Ahmed finished the contest with four wickets in his quota, which saw him concede 25 runs. Shakib Al Hasan and Co. were invited to bat first but a clinical display by Netherlands saw Bangladesh manage a paltry 144/8 on the board in 20 overs. The opening pair of Najmul Hossain Shanto and Soumya Sarkar got Bangladesh off to a strong start, however, following their dismissal the Asian side failed to carry forward the momentum and lost wickets at regular intervals. A 12-ball 20 cameo by Mosaddek Hossain towards the end helped Bangladesh post a fighting total on the board. Bangladesh bowlers and fielders put a strong show as Netherlands were reduced to 15/4 inside four overs. However, Scott Edwards and Colin Ackermann showed some resistance, before Shakib packed Edwards for 16. Ackermann led a lone battle and went to smash 62 off 48 balls. Despite his knock, Netherlands could only manage 135/10, with the last wicket falling in the final ball of the 20th over. Catch the Highlights of BAN vs NED:
