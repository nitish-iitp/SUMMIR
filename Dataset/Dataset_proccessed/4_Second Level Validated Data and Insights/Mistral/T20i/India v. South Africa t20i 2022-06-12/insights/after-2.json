    "Others": [
        "India's batting never really took off",
        "South Africa's chase was facilitated by India's questionable bowling strategy",
        "Avesh Khan and Harshal Patel not finishing their quota of overs despite averaging an excellent 5.66",
        "Rishabh Pant did not bowl out Kumar early",
        "Kumar first made the ball nip back and induced opener Reeza Hendricks to play inside the line of the ball and be bowled",
        "In the third over, Dwaine Pretorius was caught off-guard by a slower ball",
        "Final over of the powerplay, Kumar set up Rassie van der Dussen with two straight deliveries before sneaking in an in-swinger that beat his bat",
        "Tightening the screws by conceding just seven runs in the next two overs",
        "From the ninth over till the 16th, South Africa hit at least one four or six every over as India released the pressure by persisting with Hardik Pandya, Chahal and Axar Patel despite ominous signs",
        "Patel got hit for 14 runs in three balls in the 12th over",
        "Pandya was clattered for a six and Chahal leaked two boundaries in the 13th over before he was carted for three sixes by Klaasen in the 16th over",
        "Needing 11 off 24 from there, South Africa ambled to the target after allowing Kumar his way in the 18th over",
        "It would have been easier for South Africa had Karthik not decided to let loose in the last over",
        "On 17 off 18 till that delivery, Karthik first slapped Dwaine Pretorius over mid-off before launching a straight six over his head",
        "Those two sixes capped a yield of 30 runs in the last two overs after India had looked down and out, having regularly lost wickets in an innings where the highest partnership was 47 runs",
        "Chief facilitator of that second-wicket stand with Shreyas Iyer",
        "Ishan Kishan looked in fine fettle, whipping sixes going across the line till he met his match in a bouncer from Anrich Nortje",
        "In rebuild mode, Iyer didn’t hit a boundary for 18 deliveries till Tabraiz Shamsi gave him the lengths to free his arms",
        "A six and a four off Shamsi followed by another six off Keshav Maharaj and Iyer quickly improved his strike rate, till Pretorius got him to edge a back of the length delivery in the 14th over",
        "From there till those two sixes by Karthik, India looked nowhere close to finishing on a high"
