        "The new jersey design is similar to the one that Team India sported during the inaugural edition of the T20 World Cup 2007. This is the third time that the jersey design has been tweaked since MPL Sports took over as Team India’s kit sponsor in 2020. Team India will be hosting Australia for a three-match T20I series before South Africa travel to India for a limited-overs bilateral series. India’s 2022 T20 World Cup campaign begins on October 23 against Pakistan."
