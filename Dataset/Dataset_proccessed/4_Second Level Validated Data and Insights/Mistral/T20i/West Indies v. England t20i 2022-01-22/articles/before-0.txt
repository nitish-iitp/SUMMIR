January 17, 2022

talkSPORT has won the exclusive rights to broadcast England’s tour of the West Indies, starting this month.

The tour includes three Test Matches and five T20s, with the first of England’s T20s being played on January 22. The network has also been exclusively broadcasting matches from the West Indies versus Ireland ODI series this month.

This will be talkSPORT’s fourth successive year with an England winter tour as part of its award-winning cricket coverage. The station has exclusively broadcast England’s tour of Sri Lanka in 2018, West Indies in 2019, South Africa in 2019/20 and India in 2021.

talkSPORT’s all-star line-up includes two-time England Ashes winner Steve Harmison, former England Women’s spinner Danielle Hazell, former England batsman Mark Butcher, former England fast bowler Alex Tudor, former England spinner Gareth Batty, talkSPORT Cricket Editor Jon Norman and leading cricket broadcasters Mark Nicholas, Barry Wilkinson, Jarrod Kimber, Andrew McKenna and Neil Manthorp, with more names to come. talkSPORT’s coverage is powered by CricViz and the network’s scorer is Garry Morgan.

Listeners can get extra content from the series from talkSPORT’s daily Following On podcast, as well as talkSPORT 2’s Cricket Collective show on talkSPORT 2 which airs every Tuesday.

Head of talkSPORT, Lee Clayton said: “talkSPORT covered England’s last tour of the West Indies in 2019 and since then we have continued to expand our award-winning international cricket coverage, to include other international series too such as New Zealand versus India and West Indies versus Ireland. England’s tour of the West Indies will be a big one for cricket fans and our top team will bring all the preview, analysis and live action for our listeners.”

Steve Harmison said: “The future of test cricket in England hangs in the balance and it will be fascinating to see what side is picked. Dare they risk playing youngsters with an eye to the future or will they go back to the tried and tested?”

To follow the action, download the talkSPORT app, re-tune your DAB radio, listen at talkSPORT.com or tell your smart speaker to ‘play talkSPORT 2’.
