        "Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad produced high-quality knocks",
        "Zimbabwe were never really in the run chase despite an entertaining effort from number four Dion Myers (65 not out 49)",
        "Sanju Samson came to bat at number five with four specialist openers Jaiswal, Gill, Abhishek Sharma (10 off 9) and Gaikwad occupying the top four positions respectively",
        "Jaiswal, who did not get a game in India's triumphant campaign in the T20 World Cup, was happy to be back in the middle and went for his shots from the get go",
        "The southpaw collected couple of fours and a six over deep-midwicket in the opening over bowled by off-spinner Brian Bennett to set the tone",
        "Gill began with a gorgeous on drive off left-arm pacer Richard Ngarava before pulling him for a six over fine-leg",
        "Zimbabwe were poor in the field to say the least, conceding extra runs and grassing regulation catches throughout the innings",
        "Pacer Blessing Muzarabani (2/25) once again got the extra bounce from length and was the pick of the bowlers"
