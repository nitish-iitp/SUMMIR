        "The stunning 70-run opening partnership between David Warner (39 off 16) and Travis Head (34 off 18) from just 30 balls set the mark for an imposing total",
        "Moeen Ali's first over went for just three runs, but the ill-advised choice to throw the ball to part-time offy Will Jacks did not pay off, as Head smashed his first two balls for six and Warner served up a third in a 22-run bludgeoning of his one and only over",
        "Mitch Marsh (35 off 25), Glenn Maxwell (28 off 25) and Marcus Stoinis (30 off 17) all continued the assault on England's bowlers, of whom only Jofra Archer (1-28) and Moeen Ali (1-18) looked a genuine threat"
