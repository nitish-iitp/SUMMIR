West Indies will be up against Papua New Guinea in match number two of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Sunday, June 2. The Group C match will begin at 8:00 PM IST and 10:30 AM local time.

The Caribbean side has won the T20 World Cup title twice, in 2012 and 2016. However, they have been extremely poor in the competition in recent times. In 2021, they won only one out of their five games. They faced a major embarrassment in the 2022 edition, failing to make the Super 12 following losses to Scotland and Ireland by significant margins.

West Indies, though, will be a lot more confident heading into the 2024 T20 World Cup. A number of their players like Andre Russell and Nicholas Pooran did exceptionally well in IPL 2024, while skipper Rovman Powell and Shimron Hetmyer had decent campaigns.

West Indies also beat Australia in their only warm-up match played at Port of Spain. They scored 257-4 batting first and then held Australia to 227-7. Pooran (72 off 25) and Powell (52 off 25) starred with the bat, while Gudakesh Motie and Alzarri Joseph claimed two wickets each.
