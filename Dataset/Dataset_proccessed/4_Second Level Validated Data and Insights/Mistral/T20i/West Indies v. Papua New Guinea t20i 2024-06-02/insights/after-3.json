        "Roston Chase played an ice-cool 42 off 27 deliveries to cap off his stunning first innings catch and rescue West Indies' topsy-turvy run-chase. The men in maroon won by 5 wickets against Papua New Guinea, in the opening Group C match of the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup."

        "Rovman Powell, the victorious skipper of West Indies, is up for a chat. He starts by appreciating PNG for the way they played. Mentions that it was important to start well and he is happy to get the two points. Feels that they gave away 10-15 runs too many and wants to improve on that aspect. Shares that they have enjoyed playing together as a unit since he has taken over the captaincy and hopes to enjoy this tournament as a team. Lauds Roston Chase for his bowling effort as well as for his batting under pressure. Reckons that they can be better in all three departments and go back and see what they did not do well in this game while preparing for the next game."
