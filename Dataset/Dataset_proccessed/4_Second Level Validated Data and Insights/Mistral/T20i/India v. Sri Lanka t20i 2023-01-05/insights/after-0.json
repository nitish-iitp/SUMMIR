        "Rahul Tripathi and Rahul Dravid during a practice session.",
        "Jitesh Sharma to join squad as Sanju's replacement.",
        "While Tripathi will be a slot-specific replacement, another local player vying for inclusion is top-order batter Ruturaj Gaikwad.",
        "Although he averages 16.87 in nine T20Is, Gaikwad's candidature is backed by six hundreds in domestic white-ball cricket recently.",
        "With Samson already out, Hardik Pandya and coach Rahul Dravid will not look to make further changes to their batting line-up, despite opener Shubman Gill having a forgettable debut at Wankhede.",
        "Gill, who scored seven in the last match, will try to make amends, and make the most of the opportunity that has come his way in the absence of KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma.",
        "If Gaikwad, and not Tripathi, gets to play on Thursday, the Pune batter will have to play at No. 3 or later.",
        "It appears business will be usual for the bowlers, especially for Shivam Mavi, another debutant at Wankhede, and J&K pacer Umran Malik.",
        "While Mavi will try to build onto his 4-22, Malik will have to practise caution with his pace at the traditional batting-friendly strip of Gahunje.",
        "India and Sri Lanka have both won one game each at this venue."
