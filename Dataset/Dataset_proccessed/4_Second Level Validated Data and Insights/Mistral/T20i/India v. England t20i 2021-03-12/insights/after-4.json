        "Jofra Archer took a second-ball wicket to remove Shreyas Iyer's opening partner, KL Rahul. India's top three managed a mere five runs together. Shreyas Iyer scored 67 off 48 balls, but India could only muster 124 for 7. Jason Roy and Jos Buttler stormed to 50 for 0 in their powerplay in the chase, with both the England openers repeatedly mowing India's depleted attack to the boundary. Both the England openers fell lbw to spin, but Dawid Malan and Johnny Bairstow took them home by batting at a similar high gear."

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "India captain Virat Kohli had promised a similar gung-ho approach from their top order on the eve of the series opener."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "England's fast men crank it up. While India had packed their attack with three spinners, England went the other way, recalling Mark Wood, at the expense of allrounder Tom Curran, and pairing him up with Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The second delivery that Shreyas Iyer faced summed up the challenge posed by the pitch: Jordan hit a hard length, but the ball stuck in the surface and forced him to spoon a checked drive in front of cover."
