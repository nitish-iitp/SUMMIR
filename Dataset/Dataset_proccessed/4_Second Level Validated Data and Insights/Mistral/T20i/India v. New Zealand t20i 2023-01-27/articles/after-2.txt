India's injury woes continue to mount, with rising batting star Ruturaj Gaikwad the latest casualty. Gaikwad was named in India's T20I squad for the New Zealand series, which begins on Friday in Ranchi, but will be forced to withdraw due to wrist pain.

Gaikwad filed a complaint with the BCCI following a Ranji Trophy match between Maharashtra and Hyderabad in which he scored 8 and 0. The 24-year-old has been sent to the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru for rehabilitation.

Gaikwad has played one ODI and nine T20s. He last played for India in October last year when he made his ODI debut against South Africa. With Ishan Kishan and Shubman Gill set to open in the first T20I on Friday, Gaikwad would have found it tough to make the playing eleven.

This isn't the first time that a youngster has complained of a wrist issue. He missed a T20I against Sri Lanka last year in February after pain in his right wrist joint.

India recently swept New Zealand 3-0 in a three-match One-Day International series. Shreyas Iyer was originally part of their ODI squad but was forced to withdraw due to a back injury and was later checked into the NCA.

Meanwhile, India allrounder Ravindra Jadeja has returned to competitive action following a lengthy injury layoff. According to reports, the BCCI will receive a fitness report from the NCA on February 1, after which a decision on his availability for the four-match Test series against Australia, which begins February 7 in Nagpur, will be made.

Jadeja had knee surgery last year and hasn't played for India since August, when he pulled out of the Asia Cup in the UAE.
