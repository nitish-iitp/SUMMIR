        "Pakistan registered two victories in their first two matches of the Super 4 stage, against India and then a nail-biter against Afghanistan. Babar Azam was yet again ineffective as he was dismissed for a duck against Afghanistan. Mohammad Rizwan, the highest run scorer in the tournament till now has been in good form, and together with Shadab Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah & Asif Ali, Pakistan are looking formidable enough to take on the Lankan side.",
        "The Lankan team has displayed what can be called a perfect team performance. While chasing a 170+ target against Afghanistan, none of the batters crossed the 40-run mark and yet all the 30s combined to take Sri Lanka to a win in their first Super 4 match, followed by a 6-wicket win against India."
