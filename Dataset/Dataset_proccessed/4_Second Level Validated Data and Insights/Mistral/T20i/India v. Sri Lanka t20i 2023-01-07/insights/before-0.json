        "India will be hopeful of getting their top-order firing after consecutive collapses",
        "Sri Lanka have had two entirely different games as their top-order returned to form in the second contest while their middle-order failed to fire in the second contest",
        "Dasun Shanaka’s shrewd captaincy has been a driving force for the Lankans"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "A total of 4 T20Is have so far been played here with 2 of them being secured batting first while the other 2 have been won chasing. The average first innings score is 179 while the average score while chasing slumps to 149. Going by the antiquity of the surface, it has some turn that could assist the bowlers. However, once dew sets in, it should ideally be tilted towards the batters",
        "Matches played: 28, India: 18, Sri Lanka: 9"

    "Others": [
        "The series finale awaits us at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium with both sides hoping to present an absolute crackerjack of a contest to light up a T20I series between the two neighbours like never before",
        "Both the sides will have to look deeper than what meets the eye, especially after incredulous incidents plaguing the first two games. Two cutthroat contests going down to the wire where the first one saw a batting collapse for both sides while the second T20I was a story of woe for the bowlers"
