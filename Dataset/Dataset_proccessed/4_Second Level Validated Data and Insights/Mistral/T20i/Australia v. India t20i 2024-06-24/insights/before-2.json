        "This episode of Australia-India was always going to be spicy, because, well, it's Australia-India, and because, November 19 and all that.",
        "This isn't a must-win game for either team, but Australia will be on wafer-thin ice if they lose.",

    "Team news: Starc in or out?": [
        "Australia played the extra spinner against Afghanistan, bringing in Ashton Agar and leaving out Mitchell Starc.",
        "They could yet continue with that combination - Agar featured in their one previous game in St Lucia, against Scotland - particularly with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli not too fond of facing left-arm spin in the powerplay, but given the nature of this contest, will they continue to leave out one of their most tried-and-tested match-winners?"

    "In the spotlight - Marsh and Arshdeep": [
        "This hasn't been the best of World Cups for Mitchell Marsh, with six innings bringing him just 88 runs at an average of 17.60 and a strike rate of 111.39.",
        "Arshdeep Singh is India's highest wicket-taker in this World Cup with 12 strikes at the rate of one every 10 balls, but he's also been their only regular bowler with an economy rate north of 7."

    "Pitch and conditions: Pace on, runs on": [
        "St Lucia has been the most batting-friendly venue of this T20 World Cup in terms of both scoring rate (8.92) and average (28.76).",
        "There is a good chance of rain in St Lucia, though, with forecasts predicting showers through Monday morning with the weather clearing up roughly between 10am and 4pm."
