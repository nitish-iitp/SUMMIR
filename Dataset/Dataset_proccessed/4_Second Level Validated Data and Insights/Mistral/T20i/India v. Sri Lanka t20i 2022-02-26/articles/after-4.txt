In Short
Sanju Samson hit a 26-ball 39 in his first innings for India in 7 months
Rohit lauded Samson for making the most of an opportunity
India hammered Sri Lanka by 7 wickets in the 2nd T20I

Captain Rohit Sharma had backed Sanju Samson ahead of the ongoing T20I series against Sri Lanka after the wicketkeeper-batter was handed a recall to the senior national side after a 7-month absence. And it seems the Kerala batter's performance with the bat in the 2nd T20I against Sri Lanka in Dharamsala on Saturday impressed his skipper.

While Shreyas Iyer stole the show with a 44-ball 74 in India's stunning chase of 184 in just 17.1 overs, Sanju Samson also made a mark with a quickfire 39 in just 26 balls. Samson swung the momentum in favor of India in the 13th over of the chase, taking apart Sri Lanka pacer Lahiru Kumara. Samson hammered 3 sixes -- all of them huge and well-timed before getting out in the same over.

Samson took his time to get going but he once he found his rhythm, his much-talked-about talent was evident as he stuck them cleanly into the stands in Dharamsala.

India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd T20I: Highlights

Samson and Iyer added an 84-run stand in just 47 balls as the duo helped India bounce back from early setbacks as they lost captain Rohit Sharma (1) and Ishan Kishan (16) inside the powerplay in what seemed a difficult chase.

Following Samson's dismissal, Ravindra Jadeja made sure India did not stutter as he hit a stunning 18-ball 45 not out to take India past the finish line in just 17.1 overs.

Speaking after India's 11th successive victory in the format, Rohit lauded the middle-order, saying it has consistently stepped up while making special mention about Samson.

"Yeah, it was something that was important, for the middle-order to come and string together a partnership was good to see. It's happened quite a few times over the past few games," Rohit said.

INDIA READY TO BACK GUYS WITH TALENT: ROHIT

India have a problem of plenty as Suryakumar Yadav, who missed the ongoing series due to an injury, was in fine form against the West Indies. India do not have Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant as the duo were rested for the series.

"We have a lot of talent in that batting unit, we will keep giving them the chances, it's up to them to make the most of it. I thought Sanju showed how well he could play with that knock, it's all about taking your opportunities.

'Lot of these guys are quite talented.

'They just need an opportunity to go out there and express themselves. There are a lot of guys waiting in the wings as well but their time will come as well. We've got to look after the guys who have been in and around the team for a while.

'We understand all these guys possess a lot of talent. So it's just about giving the opportunity and the backing from our side," Rohit added.

"Was an important knock from Shreyas, couldn't have asked anything more from him, Jaddu came up well with the bat," he added.

India took an unbeatable 2-0 lead after hammering Sri Lanka by 7 wickets on Saturday. The two teams meet in the final T20I on Sunday at the same venue and captain Rohit said the team would look at giving opportunities to the ones on the bench.

"We'll sit down tomorrow, see what we can do, we have used 27 players so far, there could be more. When you win the series, there are guys who haven't had the opportunities. Some of the guys will have to play Tests, we'll have to look after everyone. It's the sign of the times we're in," he added.
