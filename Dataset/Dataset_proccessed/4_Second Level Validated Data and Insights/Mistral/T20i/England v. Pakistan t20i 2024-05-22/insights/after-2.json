        "Jos Buttler, England's captain, has backed his players to put the disappointment of their 50-over World Cup defence to one side as they set out to retain the 20-over version they won in Australia two winters ago.",
        "England gained a valuable insight into the tournament's likely conditions when they faced the hosts West Indies in a hard-fought five-match T20I series before Christmas. West Indies won the decider to claim the series 3-2, but only after England had fought back from a 2-0 deficit.",
        "England's campaign gets underway against Scotland on June 4 in Bridgetown, the venue where they played the first of their five T20Is in December."
