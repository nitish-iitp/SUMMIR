        "Bangladesh fail to gain momentum after promising start",
        "After a promising start by Najmul Hossain Shanto at the start, Pakistani spinners pulled the match back from Bangladesh's grip. Bangladesh batters failed to take the momentum forward with the exception of Shanto, Soumya Sarkar and Afif Hossain no players could even make an impact in the game. Fifty from Shanto at the start and a bit of flourish from Afif at the end meant Bangladesh scoring 127 runs for the loss of eight wickets in their 20 overs"
