The T20 Cricket World Cup 2024 Super 8 stage sees a high-stakes clash between undefeated India and struggling Bangladesh. While India holds a dominant head-to-head record, Bangladesh's fighting spirit and past upsets should keep this encounter intriguing. 

India, seeking a title win, will aim for a strong performance following a professional win against Afghanistan by 47 runs. However, key batsmen like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma need to convert starts into significant scores. The underperforming Shivam Dube faces pressure, with Sanju Samson waiting in the wings. Hardik Pandya's cameo against Afghanistan offers a positive sign.

India's bowling attack, likely unchanged, will continue to rely on the trio of left-arm spinners, exploiting the helpful Caribbean wickets. Axar Patel's confidence in this combination bodes well for India.

Bangladesh, facing a must-win situation after a loss to Australia, has grappled with batting woes throughout the tournament. The lack of power-hitters and underperforming openers hurt their chances. Captain Najmul Shanto's call for a strong showing against India underscores their determination.

With both teams needing a victory to advance, the match promises a captivating contest.

India T20 Cricket World Cup Schedule

India began their T20 World Cup campaign with a comfortable victory over Ireland on June 5 at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. Four days later, they staged a thrilling comeback to beat arch-rivals Pakistan by six runs in a low-scoring match at the same venue.

On June 12, India faced co-hosts USA, securing a smooth 7-wicket win in New York. The Men in Blue were then scheduled to wrap up their group stage against Canada on June 15 at Central Broward Park, Lauderhill, Florida. However, the match was abandoned without a ball bowled due to a wet outfield caused by heavy rain.

Thereafter India moved to the Super 8 stage, where they faced Afghanistan on June 20 in Bridgetown, Barbados. The Men in Blues displayed a professional performance and defeated Afghanistan by 47 runs. Following this, India will play Bangladesh on June 22 in North Sound, Antigua. Their Super 8 campaign will conclude against ODI World Cup winners Australia on June 24 in Gros Islet, St. Lucia.
