India captain Rohit Sharma conceded that the Men in Blue were not up to the mark on the field in their tense thriller against South Africa on Sunday in Perth. India lost their first match of Super 12 in T20 World Cup 2022, failing to defend 133 on a difficult pitch that had plenty on offer for the fast bowlers from both sides.

After Suryakumar Yadav played a blinder of a knock -- 40-ball 68, scoring more than half of India's total, young Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Shami gave India a great start with the ball. Arshdeep Singh picked up the big wickets of Quinton de Kock and Rilee Rossuow in his first over. Shami nipped out South Africa's out-of-form captain Temba Bavuma to leave South Africa reeling at 24 for 3 in the final over of the powerplay.

However, David Miller joined hands with Aiden Markram to stitch a 74-run partnership that turned out to be a match-winning effort for the Proteas. The two batters took their time to get going as South Africa managed just 40 runs at the end of the 10-over mark. However, after the drinks break, the two batters took calculated risks and upped the ante.

India had opportunities to break the partnership as R Ashwin was left frustrated in the 12th over when he forced Aiden Markram to hit one straight into the hands of Virat Kohli at the deep mid-wicket region. However, the former captain put down an easy chance, handing Markram a reprieve on 35. In the following over, Rohit Sharma had an easy opportunity to run Markram out at the striker's end but the skipper missed a direct hit.

The missed chances proved costly as Markram went on to hit a match-winning 52 while Miller remained unbeaten on 56 as South Africa won by 5 wickets and with 2 deliveries to spare.

Both Miller and Markram put relentless pressure on the Indian fielders by running hard between the wickets as India lacked intensity on the field when defending only 133.

"We were a little poor in the field, we gave so many chances and we weren't clinical. We were just not good enough. The last two games, we were pretty good in the field. We couldn't hold our chances, we missed a few run-outs. We need to keep our heads high and take learning from this game," Rohit said after India's first defeat of T20 World Cup 2022.

ROHIT DEFENDS ASHWIN MOVE

Rohit Sharma was handling his resources well in the middle but his decision to give R Ashwin the 18th over when South Africa needed 25 runs off 18 balls proved detrimental as the off-spinner leaked two sixes against his favourable match-up - a left-hander in Miller.

Rohit defended the move, saying he wanted to do something different from what other captains have been doing so far in the tournament. Notably, Pakistan's Mohammad Nawaz, a left-arm spinner, was unable to defend 16 runs in their defeat to India in Melbourne on October 23.

"I have seen what happened at the last with the spinners. So I wanted to finish with Ashwin before the last over. I wanted to see that the seamers bowl the right overs. Given the new batter came in, it was the perfect time for Ashwin to bowl," Rohit added.

India will be hoping to bounce back when they take on Bangladesh in their penultimate Super 12 match in Adelaide on Wednesday.
