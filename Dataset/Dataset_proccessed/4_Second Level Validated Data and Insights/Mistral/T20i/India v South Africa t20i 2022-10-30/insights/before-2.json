        "The match will be played on a pacy pitch in Perth",
        "India have had the better of South Africa in previous tournaments and outplayed them in a series just before this one with pretty much the same team",

        "India will still want to win at least one more game to make sure their destiny is in their own hands",

    "Others": [
        "India have played the same XI in both their matches so far and may not have reason to change a winning combination",
        "South Africa are likely to leave out one of their specialist spinners to bring back a fourth fast bowler, and it could be Tabraiz Shamsi to miss out with Keshav Maharaj capable of doing the holding job in the middle overs",
        "Lungi Ngidi sat out in Sydney and could return but they may also toy with the idea of unleashing left-armer Marco Jansen, either instead of Ngidi or in place of fellow allrounder Wayne Parnell",
        "There are as many reasons to make the call to drop underperforming captain Temba Bavuma for the in-form Reeza Hendricks at the top of the order as there are not to, and South Africa may just give Bavuma another match to find his rhythm",
        "The average first innings score is 143 and 200 has only been breached at this venue once, when England played Australia three weeks ago",
        "There was rain around on the day before the match but don't push the panic button just yet",
        "Despite cloud cover on game day, the chances of rain are no more than 14% through the afternoon and dwindle to just 4% by the time the first ball is scheduled to be bowled"
