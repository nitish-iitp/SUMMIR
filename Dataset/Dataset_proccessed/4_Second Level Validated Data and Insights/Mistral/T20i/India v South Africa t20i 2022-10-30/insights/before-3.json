        "India will take on South Africa in a crunch Group 2 encounter at the Perth Stadium on Sunday. While an India win would more or less help India cement their position in the semifinal after wins over Pakistan and The Netherlands, a defeat would extend their wait for a guaranteed spot in the semis. South Africa, meanwhile, would feel that they were unlucky to miss out on a point when their game against Zimbabwe ended without a result due to rain but did put on a dominating show against Bangladesh in their second fixture."

        "It would be criminal to leave out Virat Kohli in this form from your Fantasy teams. He not only walks into the Fantasy team with 144 runs from 2 innings but does not have an average yet as he is yet to be dismissed in the competition which makes him a great contender to be a captain or a vice-captain. Suryakumar Yadav and Rohit Sharma look like the other sure-shot selections from among the India batters. From the Proteas, Rilee Rossouw and David Miller can be considered among the batters."
