ICC T20 World Cup 2024: Star Pakistan All-Rounder Imad Wasim Ruled Out Of First Match Against USA
By Pavan Suresh - June 5, 20240
ICC T20 World Cup 2024

Pakistan has been a major blow as Imad Wasim has been ruled out of the first match against the United States of America to be played in Dallas, Texas on 6th June 2024. Imad Wasim decided to reverse the decision of retirement and was included in the squad for the T20 World Cup 2024. He looked impressive with both bat and ball during the recently concluded PSL for Karachi Kings.

Pakistan captain Babar Azam spoke about Imad Wasim not being available for the opening match against the United States of America due to a side strain. It is a massive blow as they would look to start the T20 World Cup on a winning note against the United States of America. Babar expects Imad Wasim to be fit for the remaining matches against India, Ireland, and Canada or if they qualify for the next stages of the tournament.

Pakistan will be low on confidence as they suffered a 0-2 T20I series loss in a 4-match series against England before coming to this tournament.

“Imad Wasim is experiencing a side strain. It unfortunately means that he won’t be available for our opening match. While Imad will miss the first game, we are hopeful that he will join the team in the remaining fixtures,” Babar Azam said.

Massive Blow For Pakistan In Their Bowling Line-Up

Imad Wasim looked impressive in the 2nd T20I match against England at Edgbaston, Birmingham where he took 2 for 19 and scored a quickfire cameo. Pakistan needs to depend upon Haris Rauf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Abbas Afridi. He did not take part in the 4th T20I match due to an injury.

Shadab Khan’s poor form will be a major concern while Abrar Ahmed’s lack of experience in international cricket might hurt them big time. Iftikhar Ahmed will be part spin option who can bowl a few overs if the regular bowlers go for runs.

Pakistan will start their 2024 T20 tournament against the United States of America at Dallas, Texas on 6th June before they face arch-rivals India on 9th June in New York. Pakistan needs to be careful as the USA began the World Cup chasing down 195 against Canada in Dallas.
