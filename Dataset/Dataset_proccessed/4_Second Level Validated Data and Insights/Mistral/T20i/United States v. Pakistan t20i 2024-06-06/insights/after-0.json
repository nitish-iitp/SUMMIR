        "USA muzzled an experienced Pakistan top order, brought their hitters to heel, then produced a measured batting performance that tied the scores at 159-all.",
        "Saurabh Netravalkar bowled three wides in the Super Over, the US batters stealing another run every time, and Mohammad Rizwan conceded another extra run on an overthrow off the last of these wides.",
        "Thanks to the extras and other acts of fielding indiscipline from Pakistan, USA made 18 off their Super Over",
        "Saurabh Netravalkar made their job even more difficult. He had been outstanding for USA in regular play, taking 2 for 18 from his four overs. His Super Over was outstanding too, as he conceded just one boundary."

        "Saurabh Netravalkar picked up 2 for 18 in his four overs and came back to tie Pakistan down in the Super Over",
        "Left-arm seamer Netravalkar had Rizwan caught at slip - fairly spectacularly by Steven Taylor - to begin with, second over. Then, in the third, left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige had Usman Khan holing out to long-off, bringing Pakistan's score to 14 for 2."
