        "Moeen Ali: 'This is one of the best days of my career. We deserved it over along period of time, we've played some amazing cricket but fell short in the semis last year. Now we have done it against an amazing Pakistan side in front of all these fans.'",
        "Harry Brook: 'So good. A lot of people would not expect to win a World Cup at 23 but being in this squad I always thought we would win it. We showed the world how good we are.'",
        "Ben Stokes: 'The way the bowlers bowled meant we didn't feel under too much pressure with the run chase. It never felt out of our hands.'",
        "Sam Curran, who was named Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament: 'This is very special. I don't think I should be getting this (player of the match) the way Stokesy played, to get a 50 in the final. We are going to enjoy this occasion.'"

    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Ravi Bopara: 'England have always been a very good one-day team. They are now one of the smartest - in the past they were probably guilty of not being smart and not being willing to adapt to conditions and siutations, but the way players talk about the game and the way players develop in franchise tournaments. Those tournaments have really improved English players and cricket. They've learnt to be smarter and more adaptable because of playing in different conditions and playing against other streetwise cricketers.'"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "England coach Matthew Mott: 'It is very special for me. Any World Cup is a special event. We wanted to turn up today and put on a show and enjoy it, but you never like to compare any of them but they were all certainly great fun. We'll enjoy tonight with the boys because we've put in a lot of work to get to this point. The coaching staff have really set this up well so we're really excited.'",
        "On Jos Buttler: 'He has really taken control of his side and created his own legacy. He is an incredible guy who everyone follows. It should not be taken for granted how hard it is to make tactical decisions in this format, but 95% of his decisions he has got right. And we know what he is like with the bat. We are lucky to have him.'"
