The highly anticipated first T20I between India and Bangladesh is set to take place on October 6, 2024, at the New Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium in Gwalior. Both teams are coming off a Test series, where India secured a convincing 2-0 whitewash. However, the shorter format presents a different challenge as both sides look to make early statements in the T20 series.

India’s New-Look Squad

India will field a revamped squad for the T20Is, marking the beginning of a new era without senior players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja, who have retired from the format. The Indian team is led by the dynamic Suryakumar Yadav, with fresh faces joining the setup. Sanju Samson, returning after a notable domestic season, will take on wicketkeeping duties alongside Jitesh Sharma. Additionally, young talents like Riyan Parag and Mayank Yadav will be eager to leave their mark. Parag impressed during the series against Sri Lanka, while Yadav, making his international debut, is expected to provide raw pace after clocking 155 kph during the IPL​.

Varun Chakravarthy also returns to the squad, providing a mystery spin option, which could be crucial against Bangladesh’s aggressive middle order. With Washington Sundar and Shivam Dube offering all-round capabilities, India appears balanced but will rely on young shoulders to step up.

Bangladesh’s Challenge

Bangladesh, on the other hand, will be keen to bounce back after a disappointing Test series. The T20 format has often been where Bangladesh shines, especially with their spin-dominated bowling attack. While they face a young Indian team, their experienced players like Shakib Al Hasan, Litton Das, and Mehidy Hasan Miraz will be crucial in guiding their team through tough situations. Bangladesh’s success in past T20 encounters has often relied on building pressure through spin and disciplined batting. The first match offers them a chance to strike early and challenge an evolving Indian side​.

Key Battles to Watch
Suryakumar Yadav vs Bangladesh Spinners: As India’s captain and a proven T20 performer, Yadav will be a pivotal figure. His ability to counter spin could dictate India’s fortunes against Bangladesh’s spin-heavy attack.
Riyan Parag’s Role: All eyes will be on Parag, who has shown promise as a finisher and part-time spinner. His performances could be a deciding factor for India’s middle order.
Shakib Al Hasan’s Influence: As Bangladesh’s key all-rounder, Shakib’s experience in high-pressure matches will be crucial, both with the bat and ball.
Venue and Conditions

Gwalior, hosting its first T20I, is expected to offer a good batting surface with some assistance for spinners as the match progresses. Under lights, dew could play a role, making bowling difficult in the second innings, favoring teams chasing.

As both teams prepare for this exciting contest, the first T20I is poised to set the tone for the rest of the series. India will be looking to maintain momentum, while Bangladesh will aim for a strong start and prove their mettle in the shortest format.
