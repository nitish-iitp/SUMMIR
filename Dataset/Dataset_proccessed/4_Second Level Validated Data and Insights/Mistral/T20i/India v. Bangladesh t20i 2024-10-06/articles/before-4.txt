Ahead of the India-Bangladesh T20I series, which starts from October 6, 2024, India bowling Morne Morkel is reportedly not happy with the bowling effort Hardik Pandya is putting up in the nets. Pandya played a crucial role in India's T20 World Cup 2024 win back in June following a dismal Indian Premier League 2024 as captain of Mumbai Indians. He faced the wrath of the fans throughout the IPL season before he silenced his critics by winning the coveted trophy for his country.
After the world cup triumph, Pandya participated in the 3-match T20I series against Sri Lanka under new captain Suryakumar Yadav and the Men in Blue emerged victorious by 3-0. Hardik was also in reckoning for the T20I captaincy but his recent fitness was one of the calls supposedly taken by the BCCI for not appointing him as skipper. After that series, he is been hitting the gym and practicing a lot on his own before he returned to the national camp for the Bangladesh T20I series.
As per a report by The Indian Express, Pandya is working on his run-up under the guidance of Morkel. The South African is dissatisfied with the Mumbai Indians captain bowling too close to the stumps and had long discussions with the all-rounder in order to better the deliveries.
India wrapped up a 2-0 clean sweep against Bangladesh in the Test series, and now attention turns to the upcoming 3-match T20I series. Emerging talents like Harshit Rana and Mayank Yadav, who impressed with their performances in the IPL, will be eager to carry that momentum into the T20Is, having earned the confidence of the BCCI selection panel.
India's T20 squad: Suryakumar Yadav (capt), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Riyan Parag, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Mayank Yadav.
