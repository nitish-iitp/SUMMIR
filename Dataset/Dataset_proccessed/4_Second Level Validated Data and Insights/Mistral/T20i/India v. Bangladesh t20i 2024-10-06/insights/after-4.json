        "Arshdeep Singh said, 'There's breeze from the end I was bowling. I didn't get the wicket the way I wanted but the ball is coming good from the hand. It's minor changes in the run-up, in the wrist, I keep learning and exploring things. The experience is there, the more you play the better you get. Everyone bowled well, especially Mayank was very good. I guess the best thing in this format is how well you can adapt to the situation, to the wicket and to the ground dimensions as well. My motive is how well I can adapt and how quickly I can adapt.'"
