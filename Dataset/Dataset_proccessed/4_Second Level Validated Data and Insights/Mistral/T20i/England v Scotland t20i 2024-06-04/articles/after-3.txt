Match abandoned

Well, we will never know what might have been as word comes through that this match has been abandoned. Credit to Scotland's Michael Jones and George Munsey, who took their side to 90 without loss, scoring an unbeaten 45 and 41 respectively. England were set an adjusted target of 109 and it would have been intriguing to watch them have a go, but it wasn't to be.

Rain threatens match

Play has stopped again for another heavy rain shower and this match is now looking in serious peril, which is such a shame, given Scotland's best efforts and thoughts of what England are capable of.

For your entertainment

The rain has stopped in Bridgetown at least but, while we await news of next moves, it might be time to roll out Brad Currie's worldie from the Blast last year. Will we even see him in the field today?

Danger zone

There's reports of lightning around which can only delay proceedings further. We are very near the danger zone for losing overs.

Another rain delay

Play is halted by more rain, which arrived rather suddenly, sending the players from the field after 6.2 overs as the covers are put in place. Scotland are travelling nicely at 51 for 0.

Jones cuts loose

After a smashed solar panel on the roof of the stand and three consecutive boundaries for Michael Jones off Chris Jordan, Scotland finish the powerplay on 49 without loss.

Wood strikes... oh no!

Mark Wood thinks he's got George Munsey, skying one high towards deep third with Jos Buttler running back and taking the catch. But off goes the no-ball siren and Wood is shown to have over-stepped by some margin. That'll sting for England. Munsey survives on 16.

New start time

Ok, take two... we are now due to begin at 11.25am (4.25pm UK) with no overs lost. Incidentally, there's 90 minutes of extra time for morning matches so we still have some time up our sleeves before we start losing overs should, heaven forbid, we have any further delays. Meanwhile, looks like the bad weather might be catching...

Dear Liza...

In a slight glitch for our new planned start time, it seems there is a hole, not in the bucket but the cover, so to speak. The rain which delayed play has left a small but very damp spot on the pitch, right on a good length. We're now looking at an inspection at 11.15am local time (4.15pm UK), which is 45 minutes after the original scheduled start.

Skies clearing

Bad news first, we won't start on time, but the good news is that the skies are clearing over Kensington Oval and the sun is actually shining so we should return to regular scheduled programming soon. In fact, we're set to start at 11am local time (4pm UK) which is only half an hour late and no overs have been lost. Meanwhile, as the mop-up begins, speaking of Phil Salt's connection with Barbados, how cool is this?

Rain, rain, go away!

The covers are on as a rain squall sweeps over Kensington Oval. Here's hoping we can start on time... everyone's raring to go.

Scotland win toss, bat

Scotland win the toss and bat first. Jos Buttler, England's captain, reckons he would have bowled first anyhow. He's "delighted" to have Jofra Archer back in his arsenal from injury. He'll be joined by Mark Wood, adding extra pace after getting the nod ahead of Reece Topley.

England: 1 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 2 Phil Salt, 3 Will Jacks, 4 Jonny Bairstow, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Mark Wood, 11 Adil Rashid

Scotland: 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matt Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Brad Wheal, 10 Chris Sole, 11 Brad Currie

Scotland are here to play

Defending champions England will be firm favourites, but Scotland are here to play, having progressed undefeated through the Europe Region Qualifier. This is the first match between these sides in the T20I arena. The last time they met in an ODI, back in 2018, Scotland won by six runs.

Hello everyone. Welcome to our coverage of this opening game for England and Scotland at Kensington Oval, Barbados. There’s no shortage of familiarity with this place for England’s squad with Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan born hereand Phil Salt having lived here for some five years of his adolescence.
