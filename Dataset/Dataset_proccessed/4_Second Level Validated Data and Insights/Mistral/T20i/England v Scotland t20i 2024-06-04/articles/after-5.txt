Well, what a disappointment! But thanks for sticking with us - let's hope we can bring you more cricket tomorrow as the World Cup continues with Ireland taking on India.

We'll be live here from 15:00 BST so make sure you tune in.

From England's point of view, they'll be looking to bounce back against the old enemy, Australia, on Saturday while Scotland take on Namibia on Thursday.

Here's Matthew Henry's match report if you missed any of today's (limited) action, and we look forward to you joining us again tomorrow.

Scotland captain Richie Berrington: "Everyone's frustrated, but some positives to take at least.

"The guys in the middle did a really good job and we can take things from that. We gave ourselves a chance there.

"It would have been interesting to see how the weather affected the pitch because it did look like uneven bounce.

"If we had bowled and fielded well, we had an opportunity there. The openers are a really good combination up the top. George Munsey has slightly different skills and it was good to see him bring them out today."

England captain Jos Buttler: "We expected a tough challenge, there are no easy games, but we were confident coming into the game.

"It's disappointment for everyone. There were a couple of balls here and there we'd want to tighten up on, but we scrapped hard and we were confident of chasing that score down.

"No-ball wickets are always disappointing, but these things happen. We just wanted to have a full game, but that's the situation we find ourselves in.

"Hopefully we get a dry day and we can get into the tournament."

This group is now wide open.

Teams will be on the notice that there are no easy games in this World Cup.

If Australia beat England, there's a great opportunity for Scotland to finish in second place.

We've been frustrated in Barbados but there's still T20 World Cup action ongoing in the USA.

Netherlands vs Nepal is heading to a pretty tense conclusion in Dallas.

The Netherlands need 32 from 35 balls and you can follow our live text coverage of that game here.

Very proud and very frustrated. I fancied the Scottish boys to defend that.

I'm just gutted we don't get to see the chase.

Then, there was a lot of rain. And more rain, until we had a quick turnaround for a 10-over game, followed by Scotland coming out to face 22 balls and whacking 39 runs from them.

George Munsey whacked 45 not out and Michael Jones an unbeaten 41.

At least their form is one positive that Scotland can take into their next game, when they face Namibia on Thursday, also in Barbados.

Scotland would have loved a chance to defend their total after putting in such a good shift with the bat, so their overriding feeling will probably be one of frustration.

For England, I'm unsure. Perhaps a bit of relief? Although I'm sure they'd have backed themselves to chase that target.

They only managed to take one wicket in Scotland's 10 overs - and that was a no-ball.

And there we have it.

The rain wins and that's such a shame, as we are deprived of what could have been a cracking run chase.

You've got to admire the Scottish spirit! They're still out there in the rain going through some bowling and fielding drills.

They are itching to get out there. 109 in 10 overs is certainly doable for a batting line-up of England's quality but they know they've got a great opportunity.

It's very dark behind the stands now.

I don't even know who would want the rain less.

Scotland batted really, really well, especially considering the stop-start nature of the innings.

The covers are being brought on but I think it's just precautionary.

Scotland did brilliantly there, whacking 39 runs from their final 22 balls. Michael Jones finishes unbeaten on 45 from 30 balls and George Munsey with 41 from 31.

Let's hope the rain stays away. We could be in for a cracker - don't go anywhere.

Pinged for four to end the over!

That means England's target from 10 overs is 109.
