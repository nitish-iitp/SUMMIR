        "England and Scotland's sporting rivalry famously began at the Kennington Oval way back in 1870, with a series of unofficial football contests that gave rise - one year later - to the world's first rugby international, at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh, and then to the first (Association) football international, at Hamilton Crescent in Glasgow in 1872.",
        "It's taken a wee while longer for that neighbourly dispute to come to fruition in the third of Great Britain's Big Three team sports. England and Scotland did not get round to an official ODI until 2008 (fittingly, the contest was a dank washout), and now it has required a trek across the Atlantic - to the Kensington Oval in Barbados, no less - for the two teams to be unleashed in the sport's most zeitgeisty format."

        "England are defending a global title in the T20 World Cup 2024, but unlike the confused ciphers who endured a six-week humiliation at the ODI World Cup in October and November, Jos Buttler's T20 outfit looks fit and firing despite a frustrating experience during their warm-up series against Pakistan.",
