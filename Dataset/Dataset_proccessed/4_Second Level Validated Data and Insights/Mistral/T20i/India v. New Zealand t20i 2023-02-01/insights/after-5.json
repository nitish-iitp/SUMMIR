        "India clinched the three-match series 2-1 with their biggest ever win in terms of runs in the format. It was also the biggest margin of victory in a T20I match between two full member teams.",
        "Hardik Pandya produced an all-round show, giving India an early breakthrough by removing opener Finn Allen (3) in the first over, before pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled a double-wicket over, dismissing Devon Conway (1) and Mark Chapman (0). Hardik then came back to remove Glenn Phillips (2) to reduce the Kiwis to 7 for 4 in 2.4 overs.",
        "Shubman Gill scored his maiden century and mesmerised all with his strokeplays as the young batter raced to hundred in just 54 balls, before remaining unbeaten on 126 off 63 balls, the highest individual T20I score by an Indian."
