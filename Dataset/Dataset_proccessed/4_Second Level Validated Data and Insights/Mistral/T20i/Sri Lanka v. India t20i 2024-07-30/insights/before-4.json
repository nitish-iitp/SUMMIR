        "The captain of Sri Lanka, CHARITH ASALANKA, expresses disappointment with the way the middle order and the lower middle order batted. Feels that the shot selection let them down. On the thinking behind sending Hasaranga up the order, he replies that they promoted him because the spinners were bowling and gave him the licence to play the big shots. Opines that shot selection needs to be spot on such surfaces.",
