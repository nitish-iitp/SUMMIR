        "Bangladesh accused India's Virat Kohli of 'fake fielding' during the T20 World Cup match on November 2, 2022. The incident occurred in the seventh over of Bangladesh's chase at Adelaide Oval, when Litton Das played the ball towards the deep off-side field off Axar Patel. As Arshdeep Singh sent in the throw, Kohli - standing at point - feigned a shy as the ball was going past him. The on-field umpires, Marais Erasmus and Chris Brown, did not take action."

        "Nurul mentioned the incident while talking to reporters after the game. 'We all saw that it was a wet ground,' Nurul said. 'Eventually, when we talk about these things, there was also a fake throw. It could have been a five-run penalty. That also could have gone our way, but unfortunately, even that didn't materialise.' BCB cricket operations chairman Jalal Yunus said it had been brought to the umpires' attention. 'The fake throw was brought to the umpire's notice but he said he didn't see it,' Yunus said. 'That's why it wasn't taken to review. Shakib spoke extensively to Erasmus, during and after the match.'"
