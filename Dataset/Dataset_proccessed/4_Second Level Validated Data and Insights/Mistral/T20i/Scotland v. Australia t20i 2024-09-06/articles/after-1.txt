Scotland vs Australia 2nd T20I Highlights: Australia defeated Scotland by 70 runs to win the second T20I and take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series today. Chasing 197, Scotland were bowled out for 126 in 16.4 overs with Brandon McMullen hitting 59. Marcus Stoinis was the pick of the Australian bowlers, taking 4/23 from 3.4 overs. Scotland won the toss and opted to bowl first in Edinburgh. Josh Inglis scored a blistering century to propel Australia to 196/4 in 20 overs after Travis Head recorded a golden duck. For Scotland, Bradley Currie took 3/37.

In the series opener, Travis Head smashed 80 off 25 balls as Australia chased down Scotland’s 154. Opener Head blitzed five sixes and 12 fours as Australia set the highest-ever T20 international first powerplay score of 113/1 for the opening six overs.

The tourists had lost a wicket without a run on the board as Jake Fraser-McGurk fell to a three-ball duck. But Head and captain Mitchell Marsh bludgeoned the Scotland attack.

Marsh smashed 30 off one over from Jack Jarvis, while Head reached his half century from just 17 balls. Both fell to Mark Watt in the seventh over but by then the damage had already been done.

Wicketkeeper Josh Inglis was able to pick up the baton as his quick-fire unbeaten 27 helped earn Australia a seven-wicket victory with 62 balls to spare.

Scotland came close to shocking the Aussies in the T20 World Cup in June, but struggled to build on a positive start with the bat. George Munsey top scored for the hosts with 28, while Sean Abbott was the pick of the Australia bowlers with three for 39.

George Munsey departed immediately after being given a life while Brandon McMullen was the lone shining star amidst a sea of gloom for the home side with a fine 59. There was only that one decent partnership of 36, for the 5th wicket, between McMullen and Michael Leask and it was at that time when we felt that Scotland were pushing on. But McMullen’s wicket led to a massive collapse as the home side lost their last 6 wickets for just 20 runs, in the span of 26 balls.

When the required rate touches 10 before the start of a run chase, you need to get a good start and then consolidate that start. Scotland did a part of those two things correctly – got a bit of a start, with a 17-run opening over. But if fans felt that would be the start of something big, sadly, it was not. That 17-run opening over was one of just 4 double-digit overs for Scotland, as opposed to 12 double-digit overs for Australia in their innings. After that brisk opening over, no one ever got going really, with only two batters reaching double digits.

A pretty easy deal in the end for Australia. The series is in the bag, with a match still to go, which allows them to try out some other faces in the squad. Thanks to the big score on the board, the Aussie bowlers did not have to break much sweat and got the job done pretty clinically.

Wheal gets beaten on the inside edge as he tries to clip it away on the leg side and wears it on the pads. A sheepish look on the face of Green as he appeals for LBW. Clearly going down leg.
