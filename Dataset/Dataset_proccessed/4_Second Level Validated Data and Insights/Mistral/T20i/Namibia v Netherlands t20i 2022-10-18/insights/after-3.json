        "The match swung like a pendulum until the dying moments. Netherlands needlessly made life difficult for themselves, as Namibia sneaked into the contest.",
        "Sitting pretty at 92 for 1 in the 14th over, there was no way this game would have gone so deep; and in the end, it was a matter of a few runs or a few balls here and there.",
        "D Shah: 'This means SL have to win their last 2 matches convincingly keeping one eye on the NRR as there are chances both SL and Namibia are stuck on 4 points.',",
        "Ganesh: 'This is the start to the WC every game throwing up surprises and keeping us on the edge of the seats. Toss not giving undue advantage to one of the sides is the prime reason and of course the big boundaries help as well.'"
