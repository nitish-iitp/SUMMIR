        "Scott Edwards, the captain of the Netherlands says that they don't wanna be known as the team that leaves it late but is stoked with the win. Adds that they did well to get the runs at the top and they knew Namibia had strong death bowlers but they managed to get over the line and is happy with the opportunity they have given themselves to make the next round.",
        "The skipper of Namibia, Gerhard Erasmus says that they could not keep things tight in the field which made it easier for the opposition. He says that they lacked with the blade, and probably even Netherlands struggled with the same but they ran well."
