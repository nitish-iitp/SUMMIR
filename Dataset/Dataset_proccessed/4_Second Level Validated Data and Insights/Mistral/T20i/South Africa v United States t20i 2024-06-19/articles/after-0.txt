Goodbye for now

That’s it from our live coverage of USA against South Africa in the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup.

The Proteas make it five wins from five in the competition to this stage, but USA were in with a chance of another upset.

Our attention switches to holders England against the other co-hosts, West Indies, in a few hours’ time.

Do join us for that one if you can.

For now, though – from me, Kevin Hand – it’s goodbye!

South Africa captain Markram says win was bigger than margin suggests

“Gous played really well and pushed us close,” Markram said. “We were happy with the performance and could have tidied up for a more comprehensive result.

“We had a nice start but the wicket changes and you saw it with us ([batting]. The wicket got slower and with those two things together it may explain why we finished like that.

“It was nice from de Kock to get his flow and everyone else chip in. It was good for us moving forward in the competition.

“As a whole our plans were good and a couple of executions may have let us down but on a good wicket, I think, the bowlers did a good job.”

USA captain Jones felt it could have been closer

“It’s hard to take the defeat after getting so close but I don’t want to say disappointed,” Jones said at the post-match ceremony.

“I think we could have bowled better. We have a lot of talent and if we play well we can beat any time in the world.

“We need to be a lot more disciplined. If a few people were we would have got over the line.

“We are just going to play fearless and hard cricket every game and hope we come out on top.”

South Africa’s de Kock is Player of the Match

“It was nice getting runs on a decent wicket finally,” the Proteas opener told the ICC broadcast after his 74. “We’ve had some tricky wickets coming up to this game so it was to be out there.

Just trying to focus on scoring runs, rest will take care of itself.

“The boys played well but so did USA and it was a great game.

“We’ve still got a couple more games to win, especially the next couple of games – we have some big teams (England and West Indies) coming up.”

South Africa’s batter finally fire

The Proteas had huge concerns about the batting coming into this match after a poor performance in the group stage.

Had the batters not fired in this one, then there is no doubt USA would have produced another upset.

USA earn cricketing world’s respect again

That was a brilliant performance by USA against another of world cricket’s powerhouses.

An over or two, here or there, and that could have been very different at the end.
