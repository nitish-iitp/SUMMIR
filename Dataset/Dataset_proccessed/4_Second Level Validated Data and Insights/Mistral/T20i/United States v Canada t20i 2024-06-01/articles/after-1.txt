That's all from Grand Prairie and Game Number 1 of the T20 World Cup 2024. On behalf of Sudeep, Ekanth and everyone else, this is Sreshth saying bye bye. See you in a few hours for West Indies vs Papua New Guinea.

USA captain Monank Patel: The way we've been playing against Canada in previous series...I thought it was a whole team effort. Gous and Jones handled the pressure situation, took the game out of Canada. (USA's bowling effort) As soon as we bowled, the ball was coming well. We bowled well in patches but we gave 10-15 runs extra. (Ball helping Canada seamers early) I didn't expect that in the first six overs. Ball was two-paced too. (Jones innings) We've always known, he has the game. He played fearless cricket and backing his shots. It was clean hitting. (Texas crowd) Really happy to see the numbers. They were really energetic and hope they continue to support us. We want to continue the way we are playing. Don't want to change our fearless cricket whether we play Pakistan or India."

Canada captain Saad Bin Zafar: Felt score of 194 was a great total, and I was pretty happy. We started well, But Jones-Gous batted exceptionally. Our bowlers had no chance. The pitch had good bounce, but it got better for batting in the second innings with dew settling in. Our bowlers missed their lines and lengths, and we shouldn't have given away the no-balls and extras. We played an exceptional game overall. Nothing to be sad about, the effort from the boys was good. This is just the start and hope we can do well in the next game."

Aaron Jones is the Player of the Match: "(Put into words...) I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada come hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line. (Thoughts at halfway stage) With our batting line-up, knew anything under 200 is chase able. Outifeld and pitch were good and we knew that. (Big shots) I go through my processes and I like my power hitting. I know if I get it in the middle, it will go for sure. I like to come in when the team is under pressure, it brings out the best in me."

Stat alert: The partnership of 131 runs between Jones and Gous came at 14.29 runs per over, the highest run-rate for any century partnership at the T20 World Cup.

11pm What an innings from Aaron Jones, and the way the pendulum swung in this game was brilliant. USA were in a tricky position when Jones walked in. He then faced four dot ball to start. However, after that, the floodgates opened and Jones pumped home run after home run. Ten sixes. Stunning.

Don't forget Gous' half-century either, holding one end up when USA lost Taylor and Monank. He unlocked his own batting after seeing Jones get the big shots, and in the end, USA seal the win in the end.

As for Canada, a promising batting performance was followed by a strong bowling show in the powerplay. But it all unraveled after that. Dutta and Gordon erred too many times with their bowling plans and their executions, and Canada lose to USA for the fifth-straight time in T20Is.

Amit: "After first innings it was looking like a mammoth score and even after 8 overs it was almost Canada. USA has made it ridiculously easy after that. What a WIN. It looks like Group A would be phenomenal to watch."

Shubha: "Canada have let themselves down in the field. "

Rachel: "As good as Jones was, Canada bowlers were terrible."
