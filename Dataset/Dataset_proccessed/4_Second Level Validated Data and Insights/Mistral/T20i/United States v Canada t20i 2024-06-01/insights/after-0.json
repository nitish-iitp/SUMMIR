        "Winning USA captain Patel had this to say at the presentation: 'The way we have been playing against Canada [in the past], and today, was a complete effort. We talk about playing fearless cricket. The way Gous and Jones played, they took the game completely out of Canada’s hands.'",
        "Canada skipper Saad Bin Zafar thought his team put on a ‘great total’. 'I thought Dhaliwal and Kirton played well. We started well in the power-play and took early wickets but the way Jones and Gous batted, our bowlers had no answers for them,' he said at the post-match presentation."
