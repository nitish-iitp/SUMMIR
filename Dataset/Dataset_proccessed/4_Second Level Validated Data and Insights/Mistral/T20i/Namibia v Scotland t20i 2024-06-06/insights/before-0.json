        "And so it's back to Bridgetown we go for two teams that have been on a significant roll since the end of their respective campaigns at the last T20 World Cup in 2022"

        "Scotland will be confident after impressing against England",
        "If Scotland can grab the extra point that eluded them last time out, then maintain their 100% record in T20Is against Oman when they meet in Antigua in Sunday, then they will go into their final group game against Australia next week with qualification in their own hands",
        "Irrespective of whether Tuesday's washout was an opportunity won or lost for Scotland, the fact that Group B's top seeds fell short of their anticipated two points means the door is ajar for a notable upset, particularly if Australia can inflict further damage on England's standing in Saturday's heavyweight clash"
