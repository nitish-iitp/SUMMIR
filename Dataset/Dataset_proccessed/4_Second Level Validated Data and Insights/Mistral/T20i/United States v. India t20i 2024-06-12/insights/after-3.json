    "Others": [
        "The tournament co-hosts pulled off one of the great shocks in their previous match with a super-over victory against Pakistan.",
        "The U.S. made an unacceptable error that cost them five runs. They were punished in line with a new rule that states teams will be penalised five runs if they “fail three times in an innings to start the new over within a minute”.",
        "Despite this defeat, winning the first two matches stands the U.S. in great stead to make it to the Super Eights, the tournament’s eight-team second group phase. A rained-off game or a win in their final group match, against Ireland on Friday, would guarantee their passage.",
        "Either of those matches being rained off with no result would send the U.S. into the Super Eights.",
        "Newfound supporters of the U.S. cricket team will be pleased to hear there are just two days until they are back in action.",
        "They will make the 1,300-mile trip down the east coast to face Ireland at Central Broward Park & Broward County Stadium in Lauderhill, on the outskirts of Miami, on Friday.",
        "If it can go ahead, the match is scheduled to start at 10:30am ET/7:30am PT with the toss taking place half an hour before."
