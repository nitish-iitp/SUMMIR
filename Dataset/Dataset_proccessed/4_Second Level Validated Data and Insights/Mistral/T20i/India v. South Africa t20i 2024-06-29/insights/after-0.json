        "Cricket is the world's second-most popular sport but many Americans are unfamiliar. T20 is an abbreviated form of the game. In a T20 match, each team has 20 overs. In each over, a bowler (similar to a pitcher) from the opposing team throws six balls for the batsman (similar to batter) to hit. Batsmen make ‘runs,’ each time they hit a ball, which are counted as points for the team."

Ricardo Mazalan/AP; David Miller scored 21 runs for the South African team in 17 balls, but in the last over of the tournament, a stunning catch from India's Suryakumar Yadav took Miller out of the game, and South Africa’s remaining batsman could not score the remaining runs required to win. In the end, the South African team was just seven runs behind."
