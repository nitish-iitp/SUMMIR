        "India captain Rohit Sharma: I'm not entirely happy with the way I batted, wouldn't say it was a perfect knock. Just to get some runs under my belt was good. Have to get runs, good looking or ugly looking, doesn't matter. Important to keep that confidence ticking.",
        "Netherlands captain Scott Edwards: Definitely the noisiest crowd I've played in front of. It was an awesome experience. It was always going to be tricky chasing 180. Thought we bowled reasonably well, if you don't get wickets, with the batting order they've got, would've been tough to restrict. Looking forward now to our game against Pakistan."
