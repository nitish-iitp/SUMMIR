        "Rohit Sharma is gone. His PowerPlay woes continue. Since October 2020, he's fallen in the period 13 times in 20 innings against full member nations. He missed a flick off a ball from Paul van Meekeren that swung in and struck on the front pad. Rahul doesn't take a review and walks off for 9 off 12 balls."
