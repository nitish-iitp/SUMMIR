India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Surya speaks

That's what I have practised, I enjoy batting from (7-15 overs) that's the most difficult phase where the opposition bowlers look to control things. I like to take charge in that phase, I enjoy it. I started chewing my gum harder when he (Kohli) got out. I just backed my game and my instincts. I have played a lot of cricket with him (Rohit Sharma) and now under him, he understands my game. He knows my game, so he sits back and enjoys it. It's a good total, let's see what happens now.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Captains' corner

Rohit Sharma: We are going to bat first. Looks alright at this moment, looks a good track. No grass on the pitch, I guess it will get slower. It's better than New York. We have to adapt to the conditions quickly. We have been here for a couple of days, we have played a lot of cricket. It's about understanding what we need to do in conditions like these. It's an early start. Usually start in the evening elsewhere. We enjoy playing here. We have made one change, Kuldeep comes in for Siraj.

Rashid Khan: We would have liked to bat first. It's more about how you play the game in T20s. Happy with our preparations and how things have gone. We are facing good teams, need to control our emotions and play our natural game. It does help getting used to the conditions. We have to play good cricket. We have one change, Karim Janat is not playing, Zazai comes in.

"Lovely weather conditions. 58m, 67m square boundaries, 70m down the ground. It looks a really good pitch with a few cracks on it. The ball should come on to the bat nicely and the bowlers need to bowl in the right areas. Batters should prosper on this wicket. A bat first pitch," says Sunil Gavaskar

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Trust Rohit, he has a plan

That all-too-familiar chant has started ringing – the World T20 Cup is once again coming home, back to its spiritual abode, India. A couple of foreign experts, yet to unpack their luggage after their enriching IPL commentary trip to India, vouch that it will. Even money is being put where the mouth is – the English betting firms call India the favourite.

That old dream is being sold again and shopping carts are getting loaded. The packaging has those old visuals – Tarzan-like MS Dhoni with hair blowing in the wind. They are from the 2007 inaugural Cup in South Africa that India won. To avoid shattering of unreasonable expectations, the hidden fine print needs to be magnified.

Disclaimer: After 2007, Dhoni failed 5 times – 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016. Virat Kohli also returned empty handed and so did Rohit Sharma in the last edition at Australia. Since 2008, the year of the Indian Premier League, the Cup hasn’t come home. (READ MORE)

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Cricket in the land of baseball

The year before, the last squares of a baseball diamond were razed away at the local team ground in Dallas, Texas. The expanse that once overlooked the compound of the iconic aerospace firm, Vought, was home to Texas AirHogs that shut during the pandemic when debts mounted.

But from the ruins of a baseball stadium sprung a cricket venue, rechristened the Grand Prairie Stadium. In a year’s time, it became the home of Major League Franchise, Texas Super Kings, after a 20 million dollar redevelopment program. The baseball-to-cricket symbolism is complete when this Sunday it hosts the World Cup opener between the hosts and Canada, incidentally the oldest recorded international cricket game. A match between the two countries was played in 1844 at Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan, now submerged beneath the pillars of the fabled skyscrapers that pierce into the skyline. (READ MORE)

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Why Pant’s one-handed shots are a double-edged sword

In his first hit out in the national blues since November 2022, Rishabh Pant sparkled like he had never before in T20Is for India. Albeit a warm-up outing against a depleted Bangladesh attack, Pant looked in free-flowing touch, even unfurling a range of his ramps and scoops in sunny New York.

Feeding on T20 cricket’s unique skill sets and terminologies, the local baseball-loving Americans could soon come across the one-handed swat off Pant’s willow more often during India’s Group A fixtures in New York and Florida. While he nailed a one-handed six over long-on on Saturday, Pant’s trademark shot has seen wavering results since his comeback IPL 2024 season.

The chances are reasonably high for such an occurrence, for one in every 14 deliveries that Pant played during the IPL ended up as either a one-hander or the bat falling completely off his grasp. (READ MORE)

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: How much will the WC winners earn?

The International Cricket Council (ICC) have revealed the record-breaking prize money for the ongoing T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies.

In a statement on Monday, the world cricket governing body shared that the total prize fund for the marquee tournament is $11.25 million (93.5 Cr INR), out of which the winning side will receive $2.45 million (20.3 Cr INR).

This is a jump of close to $850,000 from the last T20 World Cup, in 2022 in Australia, where the winners, England, pocketed $1.6 million. The total prize money for the tournament has more than doubled: from $5.6 million in 2022 to $11.25 million dollars in this year’s 20-team tournament.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: IND's temptation to play spinners might see Siraj miss out

Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Karim Janat and Azmatullah Omarzai have a tendendy to go after the spinners and get dismissed. They have been sent back 13 times by them since 2022. So, India might be tempted to play 3 spinners and drop a pacer with Mohammed Siraj likely to be the one to miss out.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Toss might be a factor

With this being a day game, the dew factor is out of the window so the captain who wins the toss is likely to bat first and set a target due to he pitch being batter-friendly, unlike the USA surfaces.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: WI chief on schedule

As matches at the ongoing T20 World Cup — co-hosted by USA and West Indies — take place at different times of the day, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) CEO Johnny Grave, in an interview with The Indian Express, admitted that given a ‘majority of the revenue from ICC event comes from one market’, the schedule has been made keeping the Indian time zone in mind.

He also spoke about the multifold benefits for West Indies, as well as associate nations, of hosting major ICC events and the guarantees given to Windies players that no international cricket will be played during their major franchise tournament commitments – the IPL and CPL. (READ MORE)

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Is USA conducive for a showpiece ICC event?

Unusual protagonists have entered a T20 narrative; pitch, uneven bounce, seam, swing, fast bowlers, rib cage. It is as though India and Pakistan are resuming their Test ties in New York this Sunday, when they meet in the showpiece game of the World Cup. Only that the arch rivals are locked in peculiar circumstances, something the T20 world has seldom come across.

At the heart of the intrigue are the drop-in pitches that have been far from ideal for a T20 game or a tournament that is seen as cricket’s grand pitch to enter the US market. Largely untested because of the delay in laying them – thanks to the organisational ineptitude of the ICC and USA cricket board – they have been dangerously unpredictable so far. In the India vs Ireland game on Wednesday, at the same venue, India skipper Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant suffered blows on the body because of balls taking off from a good length. Earlier in the same game, a delivery from new-ball bowler Arshdeep Singh had skidded all along the surface.

After the win over Ireland, Rohit wasn’t sure about the kind of pitch they would get for the Pakistan game. “It’s a new ground, a new venue, with a drop-in pitch. We weren’t really aware of what it would be like to play on a pitch that’s just five months old. It was all about getting used to the conditions… I don’t think the wicket settled down even when we batted second.” (READ MORE)

What Virat Kohli’s five runs from nine balls tell about India’s batting

India's Virat Kohli reacts as he walks off the field after losing his wicket during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup cricket match between United States and India at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in Westbury, New York, Wednesday, June 12, 2024. (AP/PTI)

Three innings, nine balls, five runs. The numbers tell a sorry tale of Virat Kohli’s World Cup. But if there is a Kohli story that the cold, stone numbers don’t tell, it is how he has been at the heart of India’s brave new philosophy at this T20 World Cup. He has failed, so far, in translating the gung-ho approach into concrete runs, but that is only incidental in the larger scheme of how India is embracing modern ethos without dispensing entirely with the old-guard. Against Afghanistan in the Super Eight game in Barbados on Thursday, the bold punt taken by captain Rohit Sharma and coach Rahul Dravid would be tested. (READ MORE)
