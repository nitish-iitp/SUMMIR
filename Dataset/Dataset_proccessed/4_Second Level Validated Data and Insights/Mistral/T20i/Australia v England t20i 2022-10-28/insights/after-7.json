        "The match between England and Australia on Friday was abandoned due to rain at Melbourne Cricket Ground, the venue of the match. Earlier, rain had forced the toss to be delayed. Then wet outfield delayed the toss before the rain returned and the umpires decided to call the game off. England and Australia thus shared a point each."
