        "The washout and shared points against Afghanistan could yet go against New Zealand, but with the rest of the group taking points off each other it is still advantage Black Caps in the qualification race, said a report on the official website.",
        "The chances of a successful title defence have increased - firstly courtesy of the win over Sri Lanka in Perth on Tuesday, particularly thanks to Marcus Stoinis' late flurry of runs which saw them chase down the target with more than three overs remaining, cutting some of that NRR deficit in the process.",
        "It looks like the top two could be partly decided on run rate, where after New Zealand it is Sri Lanka and England who currently hold the edge over the rest of Group 1.",
        "The crushing nature of Australia's loss to New Zealand in the opening match of the group had put them in a perilous position, not only because of the result but also because of its impact on NRR.",
        "A Net Run Rate (NRR) of +4.450 is almost as good as an extra point, barring a crushing defeat of their own in the remaining matches.",
        "The makeup of Group 1 will be far clearer by the end of New Zealand's fixture against Sri Lanka on Saturday."
