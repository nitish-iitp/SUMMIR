Australia vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Incessant rains in Melbourne put paid to any hopes of the blockbuster match happening.
Australia vs England T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights

Australia vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: There was no cricket possible in Melbourne at all on Friday with relentless rain leading to the massive match between England and Australia being washed out. It was the same earlier in the day with Afghanistan and Ireland not being able to take the field due to the rains. Both England and Australia have been awarded one point each.

AUS vs ENG, T20 World Cup Live score: MATCH ABANDONED!

Rain is the winner today at the MCG, it has beaten Afghanistan, Ireland, England and Australia. The umpires have shaken hands with the captains, a number of players are going around clicking selfies with the fans who made their way to the stadium. Fair play to them for that. There was no rain for 90 odd minutes but it started pouring again and that ended any chances of any play happening. So now there are four teams in Group 1 on three points and two teams on two. England are in the top two on the basis of their net run rate, New Zealand remain on top, Ireland are third ahead of Australia on the basis of their NRR as well.

Australia vs England Live Score: Another inspection scheduled at 3.25pm IST

The umpires are still unsure about the many damp spots in the many pockets around the ground and so another inspection scheduled. Where is that Stairway to Heaven?

T20 World Cup Live score: Returning Zampa

Like Wade, Adam Zampa had also tested positive for Covid-19 before Australia's match against Sri Lanka. Unlike Wade though, Zampa had mild symptoms and so could not play. He returns for the Melbourne rain derby though.

AUS vs ENG, T20 World Cup Live score: What Glenn Maxwell had said 

Glenn Maxwell had spoken with the host broadcasters a while back. Here is what he said: (On Stoinis's knock) It was just incredible. We know he has that sort of power but for him to come out, conditions weren't great for batting, the way he started off with that intent was outstanding. That's what we've always talked about - the middle-order trying to have an impact on the game regardless of how many balls it is and he certainly did that. The fact the was able to see it through to the end and break the fastest fifty record for Australia was awesome to watch. (On his batting) I feel like I've peaked at the right time. Before the tournament started, we had 15 games in six weeks and the guys were pretty tired and cooked after a lot of travel around the world. To be able to come into the tournament, hit the ball really well in the practice game and then to start off quite nice in the first two games is exciting. (On tonight's game) We are all quite galvanised by the other night knowing that no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we've got guys that can play the role and win the game from any position. We probably weren't at our brilliant best in all our three facets but we feel like we're getting closer and closer to that perfect game. I noticed that no one else was doing any wicketkeeping practice, so I thought while I was at Kookaburra to grab a set of gloves. I'm pretty sure Wade will be fine tonight.

T20 World Cup Live score: Umpires talking to the captain

They are out in the middle and having a chat. Could be about the revised playing conditions, could be about possibly abandoning this match, could even be about what they all had for dinner last night. We will know in a few minutes.

AUS vs ENG, T20 World Cup Live score: Timely rains

Melbourne has had more rains this week than the entire monthly average for October, Nasser Hussain had said some time back in commentary. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

Australia vs England Live Score: Rain check

It seems that covers in the run up areas at both ends have been taken off, leading to a lot of cheers from the crowd. Rain has cleared up for a while.

T20 World Cup Live score: Australia's wicketkeeper situation

Somehow, Australia decided it's a good idea to come into this tournament without a backup wicketkeeper. Now, Matthew Wade is down with Covid and captain Aaron Finch, David Warner and Glenn Maxwell are the names being bandied about as potential replacements behind the wicket. 

Oct 28, 2022 1:20 PM IST
AUS vs ENG, T20 World Cup Live score: Cut off time

Well a five-over game has to start by 9.46 pm local time or else the match will be called off. Will be a real shame if it does for the 50,000-odd people who have bought tickets today.
