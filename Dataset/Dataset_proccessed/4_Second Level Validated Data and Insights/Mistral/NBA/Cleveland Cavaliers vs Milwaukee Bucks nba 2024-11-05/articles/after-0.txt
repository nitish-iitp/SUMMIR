Doc Rivers’ Milwaukee Bucks lost 116-114 on Monday to the Cleveland Cavaliers without Giannis Antetokounmpo, who sat out due to a right adductor strain. Missing the two-time MVP, the Bucks saw the Cavaliers rally late to stun them for the second time in three nights.

The Cavs closed out the game with an 18-8 run in the last six minutes, stealing the lead from the Bucks. Jarrett Allen’s layup off a screen, with the Bucks double-teaming Darius Garland, gave the hosts a 115-111 lead with 14.1 seconds remaining. A play later, Allen sealed the win by blocking Lillard at the rim.

After the game, Doc Rivers addressed the Bucks’ defense breakdown that allowed Allen to score deep in the paint:

“We were supposed to switch and we just didn’t. Those are the things that just kill you. You play so hard, man and then you make these little self-inflicted wounds. But we’re proud of our guys. … We had so many chances to win the game. Last two games, we’ve had chances to win the game.” (1:25 mark)

The Bucks looked ready to survive the game without Giannis Antetokounmpo, leading 106-98 halfway through the fourth quarter, but Darius Garland torched them for 12 of his 39 points in the final 6:06 in the game. Milwaukee’s defensive shortcomings ultimately cost them their sixth straight loss.

Rivers also gave props to Garland for making tough shots, saying that the Bucks played good defense but Garland stepped up when the Cavs needed him most. Doc added that the team would have to live with that performance.

Doc Rivers’ Bucks showed fight without Giannis Antetokounmpo

In the Milwaukee Bucks’ 114-113 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday, Giannis Antetokounmpo put an impressive performance, tallying 34 points, 16 rebounds, nine assists and one steal against Cleveland’s formidable Twin Towers, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. The Cavs were favorites to repeat on their home floor on Monday but the Bucks did not go down without a fight.

Doc Rivers nearly led his team to a road victory, despite missing their best player, Antetokounmpo. Damian Lillard stepped up with another stellar showing, finishing with 36 points on 11-for-22 shooting, including 5-for-9 from deep. He also added seven assists and two rebounds in 37 minutes.
