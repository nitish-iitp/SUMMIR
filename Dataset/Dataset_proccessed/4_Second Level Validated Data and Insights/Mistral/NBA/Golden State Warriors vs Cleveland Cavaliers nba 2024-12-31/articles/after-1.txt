Darius Garland finished with game highs of 25 points and eight assists as the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers cruised to their seventh straight win, a 113-95 decision over the Golden State Warriors in the NBA on Monday in San Francisco.

Dean Wade recorded 10 points and 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Donovan Mitchell finished with 23 points, and his 5-of-11 shooting from beyond the 3-point arc led Cleveland to an 18-of-47 night (38.3 percent) from long distance.

Mitchell’s third-quarter 3-point barrage keyed the decisive run. He opened the period by sinking treys on three straight Cleveland possessions for a 9-0 spurt. The quick burst was part of a pivotal 20-5 run that lasted the first four minutes of the period and was capped when Mitchell connected on his fourth 3-pointer of the stretch.

On the other end, the Cavaliers’ defense made it difficult for Golden State to score from outside or the interior. The Warriors shot just 33 of 99 from the floor, including 9 of 38 (23.7 percent) on 3-point attempts.
