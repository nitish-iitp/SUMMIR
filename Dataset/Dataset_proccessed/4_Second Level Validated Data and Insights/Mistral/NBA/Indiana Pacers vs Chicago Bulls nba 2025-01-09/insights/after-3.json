        "The Pacers beat the Chicago Bulls 129-113, giving them their fourth win in a row and their tenth win in their last 13 games. They are now up to sixth in the Eastern Conference standings. Thomas Bryant got the start instead of Myles Turner, who was out due to an illness. The Pacers are still waiting for Aaron Nesmith to return from his injury."
