        "LeBron James and his son, Bronny made NBA history when they played together for the first time during the Los Angeles Lakers’ preseason game against Phoenix.",
        "Bronny James entered the game as a substitute to begin the second quarter, joining his father on the court out of the timeout.",
        "LeBron and Bronny are the first father and son to play in any NBA game at the same time, let alone on the same team.",
        "Bronny James is expected to spend much of the upcoming season working on his game with the South Bay Lakers of the G League, but he will almost certainly get to play alongside his 6-foot-9 father in a real game early in the regular season.",
        "LeBron sat out of the Lakers’ preseason opener against Minnesota last Friday night, resting up after a full week of training camp following a busy summer.",
        "The Lakers have four more preseason games — all outside Los Angeles while their home arena is being renovated — before they begin the regular season at home against Minnesota on Oct. 22."
