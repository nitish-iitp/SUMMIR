        "The New Orleans Pelicans lost another close home game to the Los Angeles Clippers 116-113 on Monday night.",
        "Dejounte Murray had one of his best games in a New Orleans uniform since being acquired this summer in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks.",
        "Murray finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists, and 6 steals.",
        "Murray committed 4 turnovers and did a much better job protecting the basketball.",
        "Murray missed a month-and-a-half after fracturing his left hand during the Pelicans' regular-season opener against the Chicago Bulls.",
        "Murray addressed the media following Monday's loss to briefly discuss his health during the team's losing streak.",
        "Murray stated, 'No excuses', Murray told reporters postgame. 'A lot of things going on. Still trying to get healthy, dealing with little things, but at the end of the day I'm not that guy that's going to come to media when we lose, 'Oh I'm hurt and dealing with this or that'. That's the cop-out way.'",
        "The Pelicans are without Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, and Jose Alvarado, and guys like Murray, Trey Murphy III, and Herb Jones have already missed significant time this season.",
        "At 5-28, many think the season is already a lost cause.",
        "Williamson is close to a return to the court, but it may be too little and too late to salvage what's left of the year."
