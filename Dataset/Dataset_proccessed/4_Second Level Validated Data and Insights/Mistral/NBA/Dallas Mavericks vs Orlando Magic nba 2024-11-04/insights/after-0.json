        "The Dallas Mavericks scored 30 points in the first quarter, their most points in an opening quarter so far this season.",
        "The Mavericks finally showed some signs of life in the first 12 minutes of this game, as slow starts were a theme in the first five games.",
        "Despite leading by nearly 30, Dallas' offense wasn't crisp either, shooting just 10/32 (31.3%) from three and turning it over 18 times.",
        "Luka Doncic had 14 points and five rebounds on 5/9 shooting in the first quarter, and his 14 points then blossomed to 25 by halftime."
