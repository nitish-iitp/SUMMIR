9-0 Start: The Best Cleveland Cavaliers in History

Brutal the Ohio team that has been completely transformed by coach Kenny Atkinson

For the first time in its 55-year history, the Cleveland Cavaliers have kicked off an NBA season with an impressive 9-0 record. The achievement was celebrated in the locker room with a water shower on coach Kenny Atkinson, who also became the first coach in league history to achieve this record in his first year with a new team. The Cavs, led by their defense and efficient offense, defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 131-122 to reach this historic mark.

“It's a very long season, and it's very hard to win in this league, so when you have moments like this, you have to celebrate a little,” expressed Atkinson, who joined the Cavaliers after serving as an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors. The coach highlighted his team's consistency in all aspects of the game, acknowledging the contribution of each of his players: “When you win nine in a row, it's not about one or two guys, it's the whole team.”

The Cavaliers have showcased their strength with impressive shooting accuracy, leading the NBA in field goal percentage with 52.6% so far this season, and scoring 110 points or more in each of their first nine games, a feat previously accomplished only by the 1960-61 Warriors.

Donovan Mitchell and Collective Commitment

Donovan Mitchell, who scored 29 points in the game, emphasized teamwork and a focus on consistency: “We are playing good basketball. We've done it in different ways, with blowout wins, close games, and comebacks. The habits are what excite me the most about what we are doing. My main goal is to be consistent and stay as this team.”

Mitchell also praised Atkinson's leadership style, achieving synergy not only among the players but also between them and their coach: “The vibes are great, the energy is amazing. He has done a phenomenal job with us, and we have also done our part.”

The Next Test: the Golden State Warriors

Fueled by their historic start, the Cavaliers return home to face the Golden State Warriors, the team still holding the record for the best season start with 24 wins in 2015-16. Although there is still much ahead, the Cleveland team has shown to be in both physical and mental prime, as highlighted by Atkinson: “We are in a good place. Physically, we are fine, and mentally as well. What I think about is this team and the chemistry we are building.”
