GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS
Steph Curry: Warriors 'Haven't Done Anything Yet' Despite Win vs. Celtics, 7-1 Start

The vibes for the Golden State Warriors are as high as they have been since winning the 2022 NBA Finals after Wednesday's 118-112 victory over the Boston Celtics at TD Garden improved their record to 7-1, but Stephen Curry isn't ready to celebrate anything right now.

Speaking to reporters after the win, Curry explained the Warriors "haven't done anything yet" despite being tied for the best record in the Western Conference.

"A good team, or a relevant team, wins the games they are supposed to win, you steal a couple on the road against good teams, you protect your home court," Curry said. "We've done those things so far, but we got two more games on this road trip, two tough tests. "So I like where we're at, obviously. But [there's a] long way to go."

The Warriors became the first team to win in Boston in the regular season since the New York Knicks on April 11. They did it by shooting 14-of-34 from three-point range and holding the Celtics to 40 points in the first half.

Both offenses came to life in the second half, scoring a combined 139 points. Curry and Jayson Tatum, who had a total of 14 points in the first half, went for 45 after the intermission.

The Celtics battled back after trailing by as many as 14 points in the third quarter. Derrick White's three with 10:19 remaining in the fourth gave Boston an 85-84 lead. The reigning NBA champs eventually stretched the margin to seven at 95-88 and looked like it was going to overcome those early struggles.

Instead, the Warriors went on a 19-4 run over the next four minutes to go back on top by five. Buddy Hield's three with 47 seconds left gave Golden State a 111-104 advantage and sealed the win.

There was a lot of curiosity around the Warriors coming into the season after losing Klay Thompson. Their approach during the offseason seemed to focus on building depth around Curry and Draymond Green. Hield, Kyle Anderson and De'Anthony Melton were brought in to fill out the roster.

Head coach Steve Kerr is making a point of using everyone he can in games. They have 13 players averaging at least 12 minutes of playing time and no one is playing more than 28.1 minutes per game.

The strategy has paid off because everyone is playing well and fits into their role. Curry has looked great in two games since returning from an ankle injury. He scored a season-high 27 points and dished out nine assists against the Celtics.

Hield is on the best heater of his career with a 50.7 percent success rate from three-point range on 9.1 attempts per game. The Warriors are playing fantastic all-around basketball. They rank second in defensive rating, third in offensive rating and first in net rating.

After passing their first major test of the season, we are going to find out how good the Warriors can be over the next week. Their next three games are against the Cleveland Cavaliers (9-0), Oklahoma City Thunder (7-1) and Dallas Mavericks (5-3).
