        "Atlanta used a balanced attack with seven players scoring in double figures. Utah fell behind by 14 points in the first quarter and 16 in the second before battling back both times and making it a one-possession game by halftime. Key stat: Utah has won just twice in 15 home games. Up next: The Hawks finish a six-game road swing at Phoenix on Thursday. The Jazz host Miami on Thursday."
