Oklahoma City Thunder Shaken! Possible Serious Injury to Chet Holmgren After a Ugly Fall

The OKC star fell and had to retire from the game that his team lost against the Golden State Warriors

Chet Holmgren injured against the Warriors.

The star of the Oklahoma City Thunder, Chet Holmgren, suffered a right hip injury in Sunday's 127-116 defeat against the Golden State Warriors.

Holmgren was involved in a dangerous fall while trying to stop a drive by Andrew Wiggins in the middle of the first quarter. After a collision in the air, Holmgren landed forcefully on his right side.

The player remained on the floor visibly in pain for a moment before his teammates helped him off the court and towards the locker room. Upon leaving the game with 6:50 remaining in the first quarter, Holmgren couldn't put weight on his right leg.

Thunder coach Mark Daigneault stated after the game that he had no updates on Holmgren's injury or his potential recovery time.

Holmgren exited the game with four rebounds and zero points. In his first nine games, he had averaged 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks. With this loss, the Thunder now hold an 8-2 record.

Without Holmgren, who was the second overall pick in the 2022 draft, the Thunder were forced to use smaller lineups against the Warriors. Backup center Isaiah Hartenstein is also out of action at the start of the season due to a small non-displaced fracture in his left hand.

His teammates expressed concern for Holmgren's injury. "It's tough to see," commented Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. "Hopefully, he's okay."

Meanwhile, Jalen Williams pointed out that if Holmgren has to be absent for an extended period, the team will know how to adapt. "It's not the first time we've had to do it," Williams stated. "So, we're ready for the challenge."
