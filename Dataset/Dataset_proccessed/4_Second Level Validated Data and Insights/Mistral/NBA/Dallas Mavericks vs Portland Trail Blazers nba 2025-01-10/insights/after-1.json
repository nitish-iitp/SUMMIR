        "Jaden Hardy's recent offensive surge is just what the shorthanded Mavericks need",
        "Hardy missed nearly three weeks in December because of a right ankle injury. His newfound consistency since returning resulted in a season-high 25 points in Thursday’s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, tying for fourth-most points in a game in his career.",
        "Coach Jason Kidd said, ‘He’s starting to get into a groove. You see that on the offensive end. Defensively, he’s competing and giving it everything we’re asking him to do. … I think the more minutes he’s playing, he’s becoming more comfortable with what we’re asking him to do. We need that with everybody out.’",
        "Hardy is showing glimpses of why the Mavericks signed him to a three-year, $18 million extension days before the season began.",
        "Since he’s returned from injury, his numbers have increased to 14.6 points and 2.3 rebounds on 54% shooting from the field and 55% from 3."
