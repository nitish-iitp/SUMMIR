Quentin Grimes, Mavericks look to take down Trail Blazers

Life without star guard Luka Doncic likely would be a lot harder for the Dallas Mavericks if it weren’t for Quentin Grimes.

Grimes has stepped up over the past seven games with Doncic sidelined by a left calf strain. Grimes will look to continue making his presence felt on Thursday night when Dallas collides with the visiting Portland Trail Blazers.

The Mavericks are just 2-5 since Doncic went down, but Grimes has given Dallas hope during the five-time All-Star’s absence. He has averaged 15.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4 assists in the seven games that Doncic has missed, most recently recording team highs in points (23) and rebounds (nine) while dishing out six assists in a 118-97 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday.

Making the performance against Los Angeles all the more impressive was the fact that Grimes came off the bench. A 6-for-11 showing from beyond the arc led to 18 of his points, and the 24-year-old has made 18 of 46 3-point attempts (39.1 percent) over the past seven games.

“Luka’s going to be out for a little while, (Kyrie Irving)’s going to be out for a little while, so just holding it down as a team (is the goal),” Grimes said. “Having two superstars out, it definitely gives me more opportunity to be more aggressive with my shot and just making plays.

“It’s just more opportunities for everybody.”

Irving has missed three straight games and four of the past five due to a slew of issues, including shoulder and back injuries and an illness. He will not play on Thursday.

Doncic is expected to return late this month at the earliest.

Unlike the Mavericks, who have typically leaned on two stars in Doncic and Irving, Portland has relied on a balanced attack. That was the case Wednesday when the Trail Blazers had six scorers in double figures in a 119-100 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.

Deni Avdija paced Portland with 26 points, while Shaedon Sharpe finished with 21 and Anfernee Simons 17.

Although he didn’t stuff the stat sheet, reserve Robert Williams III still made an impact (four points, six rebounds, four blocks) in 16 minutes of action after not playing in six of the previous seven games. Ankle injuries were bothering the big man before Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups decided against playing him on some nights.

However, Billups could be planning on utilizing Williams more to take some pressure off Deandre Ayton and Donovan Clingan down low.

“He’s just a difference-maker,” Billups said of Williams. “He really is. His feel for the game, his instincts are at a high, high, high level. His IQ is at a high, high, high level.”

Clingan got the day off when Portland played New Orleans, but he is expected to be back for the meeting with Dallas.

Thursday will mark the fourth and final battle between the teams this season. The Mavericks beat the Trail Blazers twice before Portland bit back with a 126-122 victory on Dec. 28.
