Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers has been fined $25,000 for his criticism of the referees following the Bucks' loss to the Hornets.

Following the 115-114 loss where a foul was called on Giannis Antetokounmpo in the closing seconds, resulting in game-winning free throws by LaMelo Ball, officials admitted that the call was not the right one.

Despite the reversed call after the game that came to-little to-late, Rivers expressed his disappointment to reporters.

"LaMelo Ball fell," Rivers said, per the Associated Press. "He just fell down. Nobody was near him. He slipped on his own. We come up with the ball and the game is over. So back-to-back games now we have had a call made against us that is incorrect. We were lucky in Detroit the kid missed two free throws. Tonight LaMelo Ball made the free throws."

Without a challenge left, Milwaukee had nothing left to do but look on hopelessly as Ball sunk both free-throws to secure the win.

Controversial foul calls are nothing new to the Bucks, who faced a similarly contentious situation last Wednesday in their 127-120 overtime win against the Detroit Pistons.

Antetokounmpo was once again called for a foul with one second left in the fourth quarter, sending Ron Holland to the line. Fortunately for the Bucks, Holland missed both free throws.

The foul call was later noted in the NBA's last-two-minute report, which deemed the call incorrect.


The Bucks hope to avoid another game decided by incorrect foul calls as they prepare to face the Houston Rockets on Monday.
