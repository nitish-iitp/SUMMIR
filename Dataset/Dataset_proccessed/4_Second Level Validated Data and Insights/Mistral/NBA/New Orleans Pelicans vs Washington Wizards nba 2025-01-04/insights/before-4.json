        "Jordan Poole scored 24 points for the Wizards but was affected by a hard fall under the basket with 4:38 left in the third quarter. He scored just five more points after the fall, which sent him to the locker room briefly for treatment for lower back soreness. Rookie center Yves Missi had 12 point and 11 rebounds for New Orleans."
