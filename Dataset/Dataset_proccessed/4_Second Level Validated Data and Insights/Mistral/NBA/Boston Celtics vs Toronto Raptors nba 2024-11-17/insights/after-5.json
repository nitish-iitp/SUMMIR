        "Jayson Tatum finished with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Jaylen Brown added 27 points. Al Horford and Derrick White scored 18 points apiece. Toronto has lost seven straight games and failed to register its first road win of the season despite getting a career-high 35 points from Jakob Poeltl, who finished 16 of 19 from the field with 12 rebounds. RJ Barrett had his first triple-double — 25 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds, the first Raptors player ever with all that in the same game."
