        "The Dallas Mavericks played the Sacramento Kings on the road on Monday night, but the Mavs were down four starters. Luka Doncic remains out with a calf strain, Dereck Lively II missed his third straight game with a hip contusion, Kyrie Irving sat with shoulder soreness, and Klay Thompson sat with an 'illness'."

        "P.J. Washington scored his 28th points of the night to give him a season-high with a little over six minutes to go in the quarter and to give the Mavs a 9-point lead again, 73-64. Turnovers and defensive rebounding started to doom Dallas, and after a possession where the Kings got up five shots, they got the lead down to one, then took advantage of Gafford's fourth foul on a charge to re-take the lead, 76-75."
