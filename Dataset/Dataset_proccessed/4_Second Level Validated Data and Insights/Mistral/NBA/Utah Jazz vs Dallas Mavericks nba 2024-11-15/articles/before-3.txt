Klay Thompson stats tonight: How did the Mavericks superstar fare against the Utah Jazz? (Nov. 14)

Klay Thompson's 17 points weren't enough as the Utah Jazz edged past the Dallas Mavericks 115-113 to secure their first win at home. The veteran forward had a mixed outing on Thursday as the Mavericks, sans Kyrie Irving and PJ Washington, sputtered on offense.

Thompson's scoring picked up steam in the second quarter against the Utah Jazz at the Delta Center on Thursday. Coming off a close loss against the Golden State Warriors earlier this week, the four-time NBA champion was off the blocks slowly in the first quarter. However, he was propped up with buckets in the second as the Mavericks saw themselves catching up to the Jazz.

Thompson ended his half with 11 points in 16 minutes as the Mavericks led 64-61. Luka Doncic and Quentin Grimes were in double figures, and Dallas fielded a new-look lineup with Maxi Kleber and Grimes in the starting five. As for the F/G, he ended with 17 points, three rebounds, and two assists in just over 28 minutes.

Klay Thompson comes into the Jazz matchup averaging 14.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.5 steals, and 0.2 blocks from 11 games. He's shooting 41.7% from the field and 37.2% from beyond the arc.

Klay Thompson has looked effective for Mavericks in his maiden stint

The Dallas Mavericks inked Klay Thompson to a three-year deal with faith in his championship DNA and versatile two-way play that was instrumental in the Golden State Warriors' four championships with the player in their ranks. The forward has already shown that he is a massive upgrade for the franchise gunning for their second title after last winning it in 2011.

Thompson's scoring and his pesky defense have already made the difference despite the Mavericks 5-7 run so far. Injuries and inconsistency have played their part in the losses, but Thompson has cemented himself as the third scorer behind Doncic and Irving. He continues to be a bonafide threat from the three-point land with his catch-and-shoot pyrotechnics and clutch shot-making.

With more chemistry and continuity, expect the 14.5 points per game to see a sharp rise as the Mavs look to shed their early season struggles.

Up next, Klay Thompson and the Mavs host Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs at home, followed by a skirmish against the OKC Thunder. Dallas are on a three-game losing streak and snapping the skid will be a priority as they take on the Spurs with homecourt advantage.
