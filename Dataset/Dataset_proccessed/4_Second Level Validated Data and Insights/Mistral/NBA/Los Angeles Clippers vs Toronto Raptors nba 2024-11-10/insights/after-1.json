        "The LA Clippers defeated the Toronto Raptors at Intuit Dome, marking their fourth-straight win.",
        "The Clippers led by as many as 14 points, but saw their lead evaporate in the final minutes of the fourth quarter as Toronto went on a run.",
        "The officiating crew missed two big calls during the game, one being a kick ball violation on Clippers center Ivica Zubac that was incorrectly ruled.",
        "The other missed call was a lane violation on Jakob Poeltl’s intentionally missed free throw in the final seconds of the game.",
        "These missed calls were significant given the time and score, but did not impact the final outcome of the game."
