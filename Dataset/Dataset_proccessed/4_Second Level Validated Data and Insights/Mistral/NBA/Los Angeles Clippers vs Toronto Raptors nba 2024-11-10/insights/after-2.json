        "The Clippers — who improved to 6-4 with the win, while the Raptors fell to 2-8 — are an entertaining product too. They may not have the championship ceiling their trio of superstars was supposed to provide, but they’re a relatively deep team that competes hard. If Leonard can get healthy — he’s out indefinitely with inflammation in his surgically-repaired knee — they would be a tough out in the post-season."
