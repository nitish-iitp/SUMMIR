        "This was a classic “trap” game for Cleveland, coming off a stirring seven-point home win over Oklahoma City, the league’s only other 30 game winner so far. The team also rested scoring leader and top player Donovan Mitchell for a Raptors team it was favoured to beat by 15.5 points. Toronto wing Ochai Agbaji missed his first game of the season due to a hip pointer."
