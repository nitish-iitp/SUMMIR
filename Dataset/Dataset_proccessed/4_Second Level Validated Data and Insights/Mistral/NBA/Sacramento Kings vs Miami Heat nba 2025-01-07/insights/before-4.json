    "Others": [
        "Both teams had ample opportunities to win the game in regulation or the first overtime. Neither team scored in the final 50 seconds of regulation, with Herro missing two shots for the Heat and DeRozan missing one for the Kings.",
        "Up one, Miami seemed to have control late in the first overtime when Highsmith blocked a Monk jumper with 4.8 seconds left. The Kings were forced to foul Jaquez, who missed both ensuing free throws. Sacramento then caught a break when Ellis was fouled with nine-tenths of a second left, but he made only the second of two foul shots, once again sending the game to another five minutes."
