        "Hornets Head Coach Charles Lee: 'I’m extremely happy with the group that came to the floor in the second half. We won the second half by eight points. There are no consolation prizes or anything, but the competitive level we had to get back into the game… I thought in the first half, we actually had some pretty good looks. The Celtics did a good job just punishing us for a bad rotation or a bad execution on a pick-and-roll coverage. They capitalized on a lot of those opportunities. In the second half, we just did a better job of tightening the screws.'"
