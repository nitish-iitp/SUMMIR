        "The Knicks' three-point shooting failed them again on Monday against the Orlando Magic.",
        "The Knicks hit three of their first six to open the game but proceeded to miss their next 15.",
        "The visiting Magic (22-16) entered Monday's game with the worst three-point success rate in the league but several substitutes made up for the myriad of absences.",
        "The Knicks have hit only 31.6 percent of their triples from deep over the last nine games, the second-to-worst rate in the league ahead of only lowly Charlotte.",
        "The Knicks were one of six teams to have a.500 or better record when hitting 10 or fewer triples (5-5)."
