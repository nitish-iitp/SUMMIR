        "Cleveland Cavaliers' Donovan Mitchell tried to add a little perspective about the team’s 13-0 start to the NBA season. He said, 'We’re the hunted, but it’s also November. Let’s relax. You know, I’m saying it’s November and we’re not winning a championship right now. But these are good tests for us.'"
    ],
    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Cleveland became the first team since Golden State in 2015-16 to win 13 straight to start a season. That Warriors team holds the record for most wins to begin a season at 24 straight."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The Cavaliers are just the sixth team in NBA/BAA history to start 13-0. Four of the previous five teams went on to reach the championship round. It also tied Cleveland’s franchise record of 13 straight wins set three previous times — in 2009, 2010 and 2017 — all with LeBron James.",
        "Part of the Cavaliers’ success has been based on ball movement and scoring. Six Cleveland players — Mitchell, Garland, Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen, Caris LaVert and Ty Jerome- entered play on Wednesday night averaging double figures in scoring.",
        "Rookie first-round pick Jared McCain scored a career-high 34 points and had Philadelphia within three with just over three minutes to play.",
        "After a day off on Thursday, Cleveland will host Chicago on Friday and Charlotte on Sunday before its ultimate litmus test — a Tuesday night game at defending NBA champion Boston."
