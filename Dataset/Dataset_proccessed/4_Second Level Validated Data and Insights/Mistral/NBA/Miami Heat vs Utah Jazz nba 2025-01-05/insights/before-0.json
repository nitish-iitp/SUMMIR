        "The Miami Heat suffered a humiliating 36-point blowout loss to the Utah Jazz, 136-100.",
        "The Heat's performance was described as apocalyptic, with the team looking like a g-league roster against a tanking team.",
        "The Heat shot an abysmal 26% from 3-point range and 44% from the field.",
        "The Jazz had a 57-32 rebounding advantage.",
        "Nikola Jovic and Duncan Robinson added 17 and 16 points, respectively, but received disappointing showings from Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo.",
        "Herro added a quiet 15 points on shaky 4 of 12 shooting.",
        "Adebayo was even more concerning— putting together a disappearance act of 4 points and 8 rebounds.",
        "The Heat's roster is currently without direction after the Jimmy Butler fiasco."
