        "Anthony Davis sat out for only the second time this season to rest his sprained left ankle, which the star big man hurt on Christmas. Point guard Gabe Vincent also sat with a hip injury. Jaxson Hayes had four points while starting in Davis’ spot in his return from a 15-game injury absence. Dorian Finney-Smith scored three points and Shake Milton had four in the veterans' second game for the Lakers since arriving in a trade with Brooklyn."
