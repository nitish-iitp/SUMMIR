Murray was a key offseason acquisition for the Pelicans, who put together a substantial trade package to bring him in, parting with Dyson Daniels, E.J. Liddell, Larry Nance Jr., Cody Zeller (via sign-and-trade) and two future first-round picks.

In his Pelicans debut, the former Atlanta Hawks star delivered a solid double-double performance, playing a crucial role in the team's strong start to the season. Murray finished with 14 points on 4-of-15 shooting, including 0-of-3 from beyond the arc, while contributing eight rebounds, 10 assists and a steal.

Fans react to Dejounte Murray's injury

Social media erupted after news of Dejounte Murray’s left hand fracture broke. Fans quickly shared their candid reactions, expressing shock and concern as the Pelicans faced a significant setback early in the season.

"Russ recovered from a fractured hand in weeks. Hopefully Dejounte can too. Prayers," a fan said.
"Unfortunate opening game injury. Depending on if he needs surgery he’ll need 4-6 weeks for fracture to heal," commented a doctor.

"They traded multiple really good players away to get him instead of fixing any of their major problems. Now they’re cooked," said another.
"This is awful news for the Pelicans and Murray. Very unfortunate. I was looking forward to seeing what the Pelicans would be this season. Very intriguing team," another fan wrote.

It remains to be seen whether Murray will need surgery to recover from this latest injury. Meanwhile, the Pelicans are set to face the Portland Trail Blazers in their second game of the season on Friday.
