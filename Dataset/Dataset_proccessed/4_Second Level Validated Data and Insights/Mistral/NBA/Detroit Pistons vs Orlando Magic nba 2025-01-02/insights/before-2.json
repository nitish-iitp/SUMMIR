        "He was injured when Orlando’s Cole Anthony slipped and fell as he and Ivey went for the ball.",
        "Members of the training staff held up towels to block the crowd’s view of the injury and players from both teams formed a circle around him.",
        "After a lengthy delay, he was loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled out of the arena with a towel covering the injury."
