        "The Miami Heat defeated the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night by a final score of 119-108.",
        "This loss was New Orleans’ 11th-straight, as the NBA’s worst team is now just 5-29 on the season.",
        "For the Heat, this win improved their overall record to 17-14 which is good for sixth in the Eastern Conference standings.",
        "Jimmy Butler played just under 25 minutes in Wednesday’s win over the Pelicans and was benched for the entire fourth quarter.",
        "Erik Spoelstra noted the star forward’s 13 days off, and also said the group he closed with was playing well as the reason for benching Butler down the stretch."
