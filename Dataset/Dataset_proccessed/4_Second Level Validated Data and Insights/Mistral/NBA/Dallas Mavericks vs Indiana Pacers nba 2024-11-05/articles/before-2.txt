Klay Thompson and the Dallas Mavericks hosted the Indiana Pacers on Monday on the second night of a back-to-back set.

Thompson didn't seem to have his legs early, forcing Mavs coach Jason Kidd to take him out after the first five minutes. He had more impact in the second quarter. The four-time NBA champ's movement helped spread the Pacers' defense for Luka Doncic to take advantage of. After trailing by 13 points, the Mavericks tied the game at 47 apiece with 4:58 remaining in the second period.

Klay Thompson contributed seven points, two rebounds and one assist in 16 minutes. Thompson's last basket made it 61-59 before Tyrese Haliburton's layup pushed Indiana's lead to four points at halftime.

Thompson's best stretch against the Indiana Pacers came early in the third quarter. He scored back-to-back 3-pointers and dished an assist to Naji Marshall to tie the game at 67 apiece. The former Golden State Warriors star didn't score again and was relieved by Marshall with 6:49 remaining in the quarter.

Jason Kidd started Klay Thompson and kept him on the floor for the entire period. Despite missing two open shots, Kidd stayed with him. Thompson had a crucial pass that led to a Luka Doncic triple.

The Dallas Mavericks, though, couldn't defend home court, losing 134-127. They dropped to 4-3.
