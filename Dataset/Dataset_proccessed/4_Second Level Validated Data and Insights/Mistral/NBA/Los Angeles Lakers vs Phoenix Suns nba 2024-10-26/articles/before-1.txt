The LA Lakers survived a first-quarter burst from the Phoenix Suns and rallied from a 22-point deficit to win 123-116 on Friday.

The Suns opened the game with eight triples and 14 dimes, but couldn't sustain their fiery start. Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker combined for 67 points, 19 assists and eight rebounds. The starters had an impressive night but coach Mike Budenholzer hardly got anything from the bench.
