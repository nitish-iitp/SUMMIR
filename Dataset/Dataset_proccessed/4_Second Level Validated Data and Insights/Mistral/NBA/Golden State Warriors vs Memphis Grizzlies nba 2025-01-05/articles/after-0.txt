GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS

Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga might be out of the lineup for some time after suffering a right ankle sprain in Saturday's 121-113 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.

"It's a sprained ankle," head coach Steve Kerr told reporters after the game. "We'll have more tomorrow. It is not going to be a day-to-day thing. It was a significant sprain. So we'll just have a report tomorrow once we get a better feel for it."

The injury interrupts another solid season from the 22-year-old. Through 32 games, he's averaging 16.8 points and 5.0 rebounds while shooting 34.5 percent from beyond the arc.

Kuminga really seemed to be finding his footing over the last month as well. He put up 21.0 points and 6.3 boards per contest in 13 December games.

The injury is poorly timed in another respect.

One month remains until the NBA's Feb. 6 trade deadline. Having already acquired veteran guard Dennis Schröder, the Warriors could look to be active again since they're eighth in the Western Conference and only 2.5 games ahead of the Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns in 11th and 12th respectively.

The Athletic's Anthony Slater, Marcus Thompson II and Sam Amick reported Golden State isn't considered a realistic landing spot for disgruntled Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler right now, but there are plenty of other avenues general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. could pursue.

Now, Dunleavy and the front office could be left to make their final evaluations of the roster when it's missing a key piece in Kuminga.

Depth has been an asset for Golden State all year and this is a period when that will be more valuable than ever. Depending on how long he's out, Kuminga's injury could force Dunleavy's hand, though, and make it necessary to consolidate that depth into frontcourt reinforcements.
