        "Joel Embiid made his season debut for the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night, but the team lost to the New York Knicks 111-99.",
        "Embiid shot just 2-of-11 from the field and was 'extremely rusty' in his return.",
        "Embiid played 26 minutes and was unscathed, indicating he is healthy enough to play.",
        "Paul George had a strong game with 29 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, three steals, and one block.",
        "Embiid and George played together for the first time, and Embiid spoke about the partnership: 'It felt good. I thought tonight he had a nice rhythm, which we’re going to need him to keep doing and keep building on that. Like I said, my job is just trying to make the game easy for these guys, setting screens and just trying to make the game simple, especially as I’m getting back in and trying to feel more comfortable.'"
