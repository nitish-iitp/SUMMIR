        "Jalen Brunson's shooting struggles were evident in the game, but he still managed to lead all scorers in the final frame with 10 points.",
        "Karl-Anthony Towns' passing ability has been a pleasant surprise for the Knicks, with an over-the-back-of-his-head dime getting the most oohs and ahhs.",
        "The Knicks' defense was still the footing that was unsure, though holding the Sixers under 100 points on 37% from the field and 33% from deep offers at least a hint of traction.",
        "Joel Embiid was clearly rusty and not in game shape after missing the entire preseason and opening weeks of the season, his body winded, his shot off.",
        "Embiid, who hasn't played a minute since last year’s playoffs against New York, was rumored to be hot and heavy for the Knicks if he'd flirted with teams in free agency."
