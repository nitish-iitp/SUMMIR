The Denver Gazette's predictions for Broncos-Bills

The Denver Gazette sports staff predicts Sunday's AFC wild-c…

From fatherhood to foreign language and figuring out new teammates, Jamal Murray shows willingness to learn on fly for Denver Nuggets
In the last couple of years, Jamal Murray has become a father for the first time, started studying a foreign language and figured out how to play alongside different lineups. It all seems to be coming together for Denver's 27-year-old starter

The last couple of years have featured a lot of learning for Jamal Murray.

The subjects of study range from foreign language, how to make the most of partnerships with players not typically in the Nuggets’ starting lineup and, most importantly, fatherhood. Murray spent some time on the court with his young daughter prior to Wednesday’s 126-103 win over the Los Angeles Clippers at Ball Arena.

“It means everything. She’s getting big. (She’s) a year and a half now, so she’s starting to understand a lot of different things. It’s just cool to see the development and how time goes by,” Murray said.

“Soon, she’ll be out there and able to have the strength to get the ball to the hoop. Those will be fun times.”

While his daughter might not fully understand what dad does for work, he put on a performance she can one day be proud of, while partnering with a makeshift starting lineup. Russell Westbrook started an eighth consecutive game, as Aaron Gordon remained out with a right calf strain. Murray led the Nuggets with 21 points on 13 shots and nine assists against two turnovers, while Westbrook added 19 points on 16 shots with eight assists versus three turnovers. It’s the most extensive stretch of playing time the two have shared in their first season as teammates. The two guards are getting the hang of sharing the court together in their first season as teammates.

“Jamal is really good at catching and shooting and playing off the ball. I find ways to be able to try to make the game easier for him,” Westbrook said after Murray went 4 for 6 from 3-point range.

“He’s doing a great job of learning me a little more, playing with better pace. You can see he’s catching a good rhythm as the season goes along.”

The win over the Clippers marked the second straight game Nikola Jokic missed due to an illness, and DeAndre Jordan made his first start of the season in Jokic’s place. Jordan’s in his third season with the Nuggets, but Wednesday was just his 11th start with the Nuggets.

“It’s just a different look I’m looking for, a different read I’m looking for,” Murray said of operating in pick-and-rolls with Jordan as his phone pinged. “That was my Duolingo, sorry. … With Jok, it’s just more reading the coverage and what they’re going to do whereas with DJ, I’m looking to get in an area where they can’t guard everybody, can’t guard me or DJ or the single-side guy. I would say it’s a different mindset. I’m reading two different things when those two guys are on the court.”

Murray’s using the popular app in an attempt to learn Japanese. Jordan’s doing the same. Murray admitted Jordan’s a little more dedicated to the process.

“I’m on a 93-(day) streak with Japanese. We’ve been learning together,” Murray said.

“He’s actually taking like real classes.”

Whether it’s fatherhood, figuring out how to play with different teammates or understanding a foreign language, frustration is sure to be part of the process. Murray hasn’t shied away from admitting that’s been a big part of his season, but persistence is leading to progress, at least on the court.

“I just don’t remember the last time I hit two 3s in a row. It felt good to come down and just pull it,” Murray said.

“I’ve been frustrated, just missing some good looks. It felt good to hit a couple like that.”
