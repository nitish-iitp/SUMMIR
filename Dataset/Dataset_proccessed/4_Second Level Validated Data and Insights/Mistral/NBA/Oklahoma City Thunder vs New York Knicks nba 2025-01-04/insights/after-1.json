        "Josh Hart said, \"We know we’re a good team. We know we have to keep going. But in certain circumstances, it just wasn’t a good game for us.\"",
        "Tom Thibodeau said, \"We had an eight-point lead going into the fourth, and the intensity of the fourth quarter is different. So we got to be ready for that and we fell short tonight but our bench is more than capable, our starters are more than capable.\"",
        "Hart added, \"No positives. Just got to be better. We’ve got to execute a little better, especially in that fourth quarter. We know it. We’ve got to find it. You can’t rely on anything else. We’ve got to make sure we go out there and execute and play our game.\""
