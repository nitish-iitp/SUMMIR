MAVS-BULLS TAKEAWAYS: THEY LIKE TO MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT
NOV 7, 2024 EDDIE SEFKO

Sometimes in the NBA you can be so good at something that you forget that there can be more than one right answer when attacking an opponent.

Mavericks’ coach Jason Kidd has known this for years. But getting the point across to players is not always an easy sell.

To wit, the Mavericks passed out 33 assists on Wednesday in the 119-99 victory over Chicago at American Airlines Center. That season best followed a 29-assist game against Indiana, which was the highest total in the first eight games before Wednesday.Ball movement and some nice contributions from reserves (one of them who started) were big highlights from Mavericks’ blowout win over Chicago.

The Mavericks played faster and the ball was whizzing around the court – and up and down the court in transition, which meant fewer half-court sets that gave defenders time to gear up for a stand.

This all stems from Kyrie Irving and Luka Dončić, of course. They touch the ball more than anybody else for the Mavericks. But when they give it to teammates, it’s to the betterment of the greater good.

“We have two of the best iso (isolation) players in the world,” Kidd said of Dončić and Irving. “It’s easy to lean into that right off the bat. (Against Chicago) I thought the group made a conscious effort for Klay (Thompson) to touch the ball. We thought the group did a great job. The ball movement where multiple guys touched the ball, it’s tough to guard (that) in this league.”

Irving said the key to keeping this share-the-wealth strategy going is consistency. The Mavericks won’t be able to rack up 30-ish assists every game, simply because some teams will play a slower pace or game-plan to force one-on-one play.

But the ability to play both ways is crucial.

“It’s going to depend on who’s got it going early,” Irving said. “And how well we utilize the gravity of our skill sets. That’s what we’re in the process of figuring out.

“How do we get the best out of each other? Because a lot of teams are scheming for us and we have yet to find that perfect game for us where the ball’s hopping and we’re running and getting defensive stops.”

But a game like they had against the Bulls certainly gives them a blueprint to follow when the situation presents itself.

Here are our other takeaways from the blowout that got the Mavericks to 2-2 on their five-game home stand that ends Friday against Phoenix:

Mixing and matching: The Mavericks were missing three rotation players (one of them starter P.J. Washington). Next-man-up is an overused NBA-ism, but in this particular instance, it worked. Dwight Powell stepped in at backup center with Dereck Lively II out and provided solid minutes when the Mavericks were pulling away from the Bulls. O-Max Prosper was solid enough to give Naji Marshall and Klay Thompson some rest periods. Those two normally are deeper on the Mavericks’ bench, but they were needed against the Bulls. And they responded.

Marshall’s versatility lauded: The 6-7 forward has been a sixth man virtually all of his career, but he has started at least one game now in all five of his seasons (238 games, 37 starts). He’s proven he can do both with efficiency. “I thought he was great,” Kidd said. “I asked him how he liked starting, he said it was cool. To be able to have him be able to start – defensively he helps us and on offense, it gives us another guy who can push it.” Marshall had eight points, two steals and the Mavericks were plus-18 during his 21 minutes on the floor.

Cleaning the glass: The Mavericks were up 56-45 at halftime, and one of the reasons the Bulls were still in the game is that they had a plus-10 rebounding advantage late in the first half. The Mavericks corrected that in the second half, giving the Bulls just five second-chance points (the Mavs had 12 after getting zero in the first half.

Final thoughts: We don’t know for sure how long Lively, Washington and Kleber will be out, but for however long it is, the depth on the front line is going to be tested. Expect Powell and Prosper to continue getting meaningful minutes. And don’t be surprised if Markieff Morris joins them . . . Save for Dante Exum, who has been out after wrist surgery in training camp, the other 17 Mavericks now have all seen action in at least one game, including two-way players Kessler Edwards, Brandon Williams and Jazian Gortman.
