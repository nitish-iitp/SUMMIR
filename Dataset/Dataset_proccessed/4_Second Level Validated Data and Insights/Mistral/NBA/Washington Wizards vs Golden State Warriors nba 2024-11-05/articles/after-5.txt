Washington
Warriors Halftime Report vs. Wizards

By Lance Roberson,

2024-11-05

During Monday's contest, the Golden State Warriors lead the Washington Wizards 54-45 after the first two quarters. However, Trayce Jackson-Davis led the Warriors with 10 points against his former team. Despite an 11-5 run from the Wizards in the second quarter, the Warriors maintained a lead to end the first half.

Washington selected Jackson-Davis with the 57th overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft. However, the second-generation NBA player went from one of the worst teams in the NBA to a dynasty.

In a twisted way of thanking the Wizards for allowing him to take his talent to Golden State, Jackson-Ellis posted 10 points in the first half, rejecting a shot and grabbing a rebound.

Stephen Curry returned to action after missing the last three games with a peroneal strain. The two-time MVP scored eight points, including a buzzer-three-pointer to end the second quarter. However, the "Step Splash Brother" Buddy Hield led the newfound 3-point duo with 10 points on 2-4 shooting from such a range.

Ex-Warriors guard Jordan Poole finished the first half leading the Wizards with 14 points, two steals, and two blocks.

Although the Wizards have made the game somewhat close, once Curry gets going, expect a blowout victory for the 5-1 Warriors.

More than 1 in 4 Colorado youngsters have received a suggestive text, report says

More than one in four Colorado children have received a suggestive text, and more than one in five has sent one, according to a report by Manhattan Mental Health Counseling. The report uses data from the Cyberbullying Research Center and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to find the most dangerous states for children online, according to a statement from Manhattan Mental Health. “The study gathered data on five main factors across all 50 states. The data for each state was scaled, weighted, and totaled to produce the final ranking for this study. The impact of each factor was assessed, and a different numerical weight was assigned accordingly to determine what makes a state dangerous for kids online.”
