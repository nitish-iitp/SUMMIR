Heat’s sophomore first round draft pick is flourishing in Jimmy Butler’s absence

With Jimmy Butler’s absence from the team and post-suspension future still uncertain, somebody had to step up for the Miami Heat. The star had been starting in the frontcourt during each of his 22 games played this season. Butler was in the midst of another strong campaign, averaging 17.6 points, 5.5 rebounds and 4.7 assists on a career-high 55% from the field.

His two-way presence was also getting it done defensively, securing 1.2 steals in those games. It‘s undoubtedly some hard shoes to fill, and that missing all around efficiency needs to be taken as group. However, nobody individually has benefited and more taken advantage of Butler’s absence than Jaime Jaquez Jr.

The sophomore first round draft pick from 2013 is in the midst of an impressive run of late. A run that has looked very rookie year Jaquez-esque.

Over the last three games, Jaquez Jr. is averaging 18.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 2.3 steals on 56.3% shooting. The Heat have gone 2-1 in this stretch, including back-to-back wins after Thursday’s win over the Utah Jazz.

In that Jazz game, Jaime Jaquez Jr. posted an efficient near triple-double statline.

Miami outscored Utah by 4 points in his 36 minutes, good for the highest out of all the starters in what was as ugly win with limited offense. His assertiveness on the offensive end has provided a huge boost, and Jaquez is taking advantage of the opportunity with an increased role.

He spoke on the performance from him and his team postgame, stating:

“I really needed to make those free throws (down the stretch), make up for the last game. I’m really happy I got to seal it like that. Really proud of how the guys came out and played. We’ve been battling and working so hard. This was a win we deserved.”

The rim pressure and finishing while going downhill towards the basket has provided an impact to supplement the rest of the starters. He has the patience with the ball in his hands and crafty footwork, similar to Butler, on that low-post.

Jaquez has even been solid on the defensive end, getting active in all the passing lanes and holding his own on individual matchups.

It is encouraging to see these signs of life out of him, who has had a rough up-and-down 2024-25 season so far. This small three-game sample size has shown flashbacks of the player the fanbase watched for most of last season. He finished on the NBA’s All-Rookie first team, and even secured multiple rookie of the month honors just a year ago.

The biggest surprise during this stretch has been his ability to spread the floor. Jaquez went 3 of 5 from 3-point range in Utah, and even stepped up for some clutch ones in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.

One can only help that the young 24 year-old will continue to build on these efforts and keep developing. In what seemed deeper than just a “sophomore slump” weeks ago, Jaquez has finally turned a corner. And it is starting to bring a real impact back to the Heat’s rotation.

This team (or maybe any team) success strongly depends of how wings are playing. Butler wasnt very good this year, and JJJ or Dunc neither, Jovic and HH both inconsistent too.
Some stability at that position could do miracles.

But Jaquez has been outstanding the last few games.

Thats what I m saying. We didn’t have a wing playing consistently good all year, but when we have one (past 3 games) results are better.

I become a bit sloppy with my English lately.

If my memory is correct (and it might not be) Jamie had his best stretch last December when Jimmy Butler was also out. And if my memory is correct (and I’m almost certain it is) that was the best stetch of Heat basketball last season. This past week is my favorite stretch of Heat basketball this season. I think I’m sensing a pattern. Trade Jimmy!

Jaquez brings energy, toughness, playmaking, rebounding and a running game to the Heat. The more he plays, the better he gets. As Spo often says, it’s not always about the statistics (when referring to Highsmith and Jaquez) its about what they do that contributes to winning. I think the same will be said of Ware very soon.

Breaking news!! Grizzlies make a deal with the Heat!! However, the deal is they poached Zyon Pullin from our G League team and signed him to a 2 year 2 way contract. Pullin definitely has potential. Good luck to him.

Jimmy Butler Has Finally Met His Match In Pat Riley’s Heat

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kwH390_jSg

I was reading the comments below the video and thought this one hit the nail on the head.

Rewarding Jimmy for his past contributions would GUARANTEE that Miami will not win a title in his era. The man ALREADY got paid. So if they’re not going to win a title, why the hell would they hamstring the team for years to come? Jimmy makes almost $600,000 PER GAME. Let that sink in…The guy is one of only SIX players making $50 million. He is not even Top 25 in production anymore. As for Lillard, Riley did the right thing. He would have gutted the team for ANOTHER aging star that would NOT have made a difference.

Maybe the worst side of Jimmy has now emerged, the greedy person who puts his individual needs over team aspirations. It’s an ugly trait. And when you think back at how badly the Kyle Lowry trade went, which was done at Jimmy’s request, we wonder if that perspective extended to his friends too. I was amongst the biggest Jimmy backers, but he clearly has a down side, part of which is he will say anything to get what he wants, such as implying he is still at the height of his ability, and then he added, “to be brutally honest.” I still will never forget all the thrills he brought us, the amazing will to win, the tremendous beating his body took while playing in a style to get fouled as much as make a bucket. But, you start to see the side where he wore out his welcome elsewhere. And now I’m hoping he finishes his career elsewhere.

Yeah, if he says that he is in his prime, that means either he has slacked off terribly after the 2023 playoffs or he is just full of it. I think the latter is true.
It’s hard to have sympathy for a player who throws all his teammates and fans under the bus and quits on his team in the middle of the season. But apparently 30 million $ is more important to him than fans and legacy (this is the approx.extra amount he would earn if he signed a max 2 year deal vs his player option + a new contract in 2025).

Yeah, saying he is still in his prime is absurd. Now, if he said, I can still play at a high level, that would be a believable statement.

He was obviously upset about having missed those 2 free throws against the Kings and, rather than mope, just worked harder. The Heat were THISCLOSE to being 3-0 on this road trip. I am really focusing on the young players. As a certain someone here says – the glass is half full!

Juan wick with a full clip is some crazy good shiiii. Dawg be looking like a foul merchant slashing through the paint or Jaime buckets. His rebounding and playmaking has really impressed me, and defense is coming along nicely. Just wait until he gets a consistent 3pt shot…..and it’s game over.

At this point, Jaquez is just beginning to get his footing as a starter. I won’t compare him to Butler because he’s not there yet, he may never be. But he can be the best version of himself. He’s very good in the paint, a very good playmaker, a good rebounder and an above average defender. He needs to work on his free throws and 3 point shooting.

For comparison purposes, here’s Jimmy’s second year stats with Chicago vs Jaime’s second year stats with Miami.

MPG: Butler 26, Jaquez 23.2
PPG: Butler 8.6, Jaquez 9.5
RPG: Butler 4.0, Jaquez 4.8
APG: Butler 1.4, Jaquez 2.7
SPG: Butler 1.0, Jaquez 1.2

Here’s another article on Jimmy Butler’s feud with Riley. Note Jimmy’s comment about bosses and Riley’s comment about what it means to be under contract per collective bargaining agreement.
