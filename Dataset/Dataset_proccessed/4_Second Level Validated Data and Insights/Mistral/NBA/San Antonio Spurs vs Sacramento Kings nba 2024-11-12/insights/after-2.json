        "The Spurs built a five-point edge at the 6:22 mark of the first quarter on a Castle 3-pointer before Sacramento answered, leapfrogging to the front at 21-20 when Sabonis scored on a running layup with 2:57 remaining in the period. Sacramento stoked its advantage to nine points early in the second quarter, but the Spurs swung back, retaking the lead at 37-36 when Wembanyama canned a 3-pointer with 7:38 to play in the period. The lead switched hands three times over the remaining minutes of the half until San Antonio reeled off a 5-0 run to garner a 60-55 edge at the break."
