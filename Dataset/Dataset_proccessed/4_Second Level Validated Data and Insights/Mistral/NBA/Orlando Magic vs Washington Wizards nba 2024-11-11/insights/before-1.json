        "Notably, the Wizards have seen inconsistent performances from their young players. Bilal Coulibaly has shown promise, increasing his scoring average significantly this season. The team is also relying on new additions like Bub Carrington, who, as the 14th overall pick, has been making contributions on both ends of the floor. Alex Sarr, the second overall pick, continues to develop his game but shows potential with 2.6 blocks per game."
