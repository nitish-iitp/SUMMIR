        "The Hornets played some pretty offensive basketball in the first quarter. Brandon Miller and LaMelo Ball made a few smooth driving finger rolls while the 3-point shots weren’t falling. Tre Mann had a stretch where he went on a personal 8-0 run to force a Pacers timeout.",
        "The second quarter was very not pretty. The Hornets kept finding themselves in late shot clock situations that forced desperation shots that didn’t go in. Their defense forced the Pacers into a similar spot. The one real highlight of the quarter was LaMelo Ball swatting away a Myles Turner shot that led to a run out. He probably should have been given a flagrant foul for getting wrapped up by Jarace Walker, but he didn’t.",
        "LaMelo Ball made a floater on the first Hornets possession of the second half, but that was the only make in a span of 17 attempts that bridged the second and third quarters. A Pacers barrage built up a lead as large as 13 right around the midway point of the third quarter, but that seemed to trigger a Hornets run. They clamped down on the defensive end while Brandon Miller caught fire on offense and got a little help from Tre Mann and Cody Martin. Miller ended up with five 3-pointers and 17 points in the third quarter alone as a 23-22 Hornets run gave them an eight point lead heading into the fourth.",
        "Miller sat to start the fourth. It took a little bit for the Hornets to get the offense going again, but once LaMelo Ball saw a couple of free throws go in, he started his own outburst to put the game away. He scored every way possible—free throws, 3-pointers, and beating defenders one on one. He was the catalyst for a 21-4 Hornets run to end the game."
