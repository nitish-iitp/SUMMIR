CLEVELAND, Ohio. (KCTV) - For the second straight day, a Kansas City Royals starting pitcher exited a start early due to injury.

During the second inning of Tuesday night’s game between the Royals and the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians, right-handed pitcher Michael Lorenzen stretched awkwardly attempting to turn a double play at first base and suffered an injury.

Lorenzen, making his fifth start in a Royals uniform since being acquired late in July, remained in the game and got a strikeout before exiting a batter later.

The Royals said Lorenzen exited with a left hamstring strain. The injury came a day after left-handed pitcher Cole Ragans struggled with command and exited his start -- albeit having thrown 90-plus pitches and getting through four innings -- with tightness in his left hamstring and calf.

After the first game of the doubleheader Monday, Royals manager Matt Quatraro said Ragans would be fine health-wise. It remains to be seen if Lorenzen will require a stint on the injured list following his departure from Tuesday’s game.

Lorenzen had a 1.99 earned run average over his first four starts in a Royals uniform. He exited the game with Kansas City leading 2-0 in the bottom of the second inning as the Royals attempted to take the AL Central lead.
