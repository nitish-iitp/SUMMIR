        "The three wins didn’t come easy. Kansas City starters covered just 10 1/3 innings over those first three games, leaving relievers to pick up 16 2/3 innings. Monday’s doubleheader was one problem, but Michael Lorenzen leaving Tuesday’s start in the second inning was another, leaving the Royals with an extremely thin bullpen on Wednesday."
