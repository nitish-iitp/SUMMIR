Kansas City Royals vs New York Yankees Prediction

I might try the Royals here. Ragans took a loss to Houston on August 31 with five earned in 5.0 innings. In the other two of his last three starts, however, Ragans is 1-0 with one earned in 10.0 frames. As for Gil, he’s coming off 6.0 clean innings in a win over the Cubs but had seven earned in 7.0 innings prior to that.

On Tuesday the Royals got a pretty excellent effort on both sides. KC used only two arms out of the pen, and the 11 hits were spread out among the lineup pretty well. The Royals should have a nice shot at keeping it rolling Wednesday.
