TIGERS 2, RED SOX 1
Red Sox bats no match for Tarik Skubal as Tigers eke out victory

DETROIT — Red Sox manager Alex Cora laughed a bit when asked what made lefthander Tarik Skubal so good for the Detroit Tigers against his team on Saturday night.

“Fastball at 99, sinker, slider, changeup. On top of hitters,” Cora said. “He’s probably the best pitcher in the American League.”

There’s not much question about that. In a 2-1 victory for the Tigers, Skubal allowed one run on four hits over eight innings and struck out eight without a walk.

Skubal hit 99 miles per hour with his 98th and final pitch to strike out Ceddanne Rafaela. He averaged 97 with his four-seam fastball and his sinker and mixed in three effective offspeed pitches.

Beyond that, Skubal picked up his intensity those few times the Sox had runners on base.

Tigers pitching coach Juan Nieves, who had the same job for the Red Sox from 2013-15, said Skubal’s determination and toughness reminded him of three-time World Series winner Jon Lester. That’s high praise.

Lester never won a Cy Young Award but Skubal seems to have it locked up this season. He’s 16-4 with a 2.51 earned run average.

Yet the Sox had a chance to win this game, several in fact.

Tyler O’Neill’s 25th homer gave the Sox a quick lead in the first inning. He drove a slider 401 feet over the fence in left-center.

“That’s elite stuff,” O’Neill said. “I was definitely battling up there against him. I was just trying to get something over the plate I could handle. That was a good one but it was pretty shut down after that.”

Poor defense — an issue all season for the Sox — allowed the Tigers to take the lead against Nick Pivetta in the second inning.

Spencer Torkelson singled with one out and took third on a double down the right-field line by Zach McKinstry. Trey Sweeney followed with a deep fly ball to left field.

Rob Refsnyder followed the ball to the warning track and had ample room to make the play. But the ball went over his glove and Torkelson scored.

McKinstry, who was tagging at second, raced to third and was sent to the plate by third base coach Joey Cora.

Of all teams, the Red Sox should know that Alex Cora’s older brother likes to take chances. But Rafaela wasn’t paying attention and his throw to the plate was too late to get McKinstry.

“Just an aggressive send and it paid off for them,” Alex Cora said.

Refsnyder was not charged with an error but acknowledged he should have made the play and said he apologized to Pivetta.

“The wind took it a lot further than I thought,” Refsnyder said. “It’s all on me. I should have caught it.”

Tyler O'Neill went deep with a solo shot in the first inning, but the Red Sox were otherwise silent at the plate.DUANE BURLESON/GETTY

Pivetta (5-10) was otherwise strong over six innings. He allowed those two runs on six hits, walked one, and struck out six.

“I executed my pitches pretty well today,” he said. “I was able to keep [the Tigers] at bay.”

Skubal and Pivetta didn’t waste time, combining to throw 71 percent of their pitches for strikes. That allowed them to take advantage of the shadows that resulted from the 6:10 p.m. start time. The game finished in 2 hours and 1 minute.

After Greg Weissert and Rich Hill combined for two scoreless innings, the Sox had a chance against Tigers closer Tyler Holton in the ninth.

O’Neill worked a two-out walk to get Rafael Devers to the plate and the Sox were a swing away from having the lead. But Devers lined softly to shortstop.

Devers is 0 for 9 in two games after sitting out three games with sore shoulders.

With Minnesota losing, 15-0, at Toronto, the Sox remain 3½ games out in the race for a wild-card berth.

“We’ve got lots of baseball going forward,” O’Neill said.

But as the calendar flips to September, the Sox need a sustained run of success soon to have a chance.

“We stay the course,” Cora said. “We actually believe we can do more. … Now we go. We’ve got to play better baseball but it should be fun the rest of the way.”
