        "Tarik Skubal pitched an impressive game for the Detroit Tigers, allowing one run on four hits over eight innings and striking out eight without a walk.",
        "The Red Sox had a chance to win the game several times, but poor defense and a lack of offensive production ultimately led to their defeat.",
        "Tyler O'Neill hit a solo home run in the first inning for the Red Sox, but the team was otherwise held scoreless.",
        "The game finished in 2 hours and 1 minute, with both pitchers combining to throw 71 percent of their pitches for strikes."
