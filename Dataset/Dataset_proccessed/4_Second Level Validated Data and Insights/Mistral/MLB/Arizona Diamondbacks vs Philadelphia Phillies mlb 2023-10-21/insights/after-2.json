        "Zack Wheeler will take the mound for the visiting Philadelphia Phillies. In postseason play, he has pitched in 19 innings for a 2.37 ERA (0.63 WHIP). He’s struck out 26.",
        "Meanwhile, Zac Gallen will start for the D-backs, hoping for a better showing than he had in Philly. Currently, he has 4.96 ERA (1.53 WHIP) in 16.1 innings pitched with 12 Ks. He will hope to return to his Cy-Young-finalist form.",
