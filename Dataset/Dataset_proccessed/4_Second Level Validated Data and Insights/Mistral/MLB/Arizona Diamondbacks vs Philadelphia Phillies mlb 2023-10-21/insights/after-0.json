        "The game is being televised in the U.S. on TBS. All series are available in the U.S. on MLB.TV with authentication to a participating Pay TV provider. Games are available live internationally (except in Canada). Full game archives are available approximately 90 minutes after the game ends.",
        "The D-backs will have a fully loaded bullpen for Game 6, as none of their leverage relievers threw in Game 5. Expect Lovullo to be aggressive in going to the bullpen with the season on the line.",
        "If the Phillies have a lead in Game 6, don’t expect to see right-handers Craig Kimbrel or Orion Kerkering in high-leverage situations, unless absolutely necessary. Instead, those situations will fall to José Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Seranthony Domínguez and Matt Strahm."
