        "The Houston Astros are going to have little issues getting the offense going here, and that is going to be the difference here. The Astros are averaging 4.65 runs per game. Valdez is on the mound for the Astros and he sits with an ERA of 2.85. The Mariners' offense has been a major problem all season, and they are going to really struggle to get the offense going here. Back the Astros on the run line."
