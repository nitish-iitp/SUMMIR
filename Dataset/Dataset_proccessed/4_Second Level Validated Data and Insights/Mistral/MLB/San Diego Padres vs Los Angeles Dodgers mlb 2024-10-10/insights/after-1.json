        "Padres manager Mike Shildt refused to be ruffled by the Dodgers’ caginess regarding their starter for Friday’s winner-take-all Game 5 in the National League Division Series. He compared his team’s approach to an NFL Hall of Fame coach’s. The Padres named starter Yu Darvish.",
        "Yu Darvish is a veteran of playoff elimination games – he’s taken the mound four times in the contests, but he’s gone 0-4. That includes the Padres’ 2022 NL Championship Series loss to the Phillies and Game 7 of the 2017 World Series, when he made the start for L.A. at Dodger Stadium against the Houston Astros.",
        "Xander Bogaerts wants the offense to give Darvish a lift. 'I feel like if we can give him a little comfort early on, it would be nice.' the shortstop told MLB.com."

    "Others": [
        "The stakes may be high for both teams – they are aiming to face the New York Mets in the NLCS beginning Sunday.",
        "The Japanese contingent, Darvish and the Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, are eager to compete against each other."
