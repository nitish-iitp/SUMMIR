        "The Dodgers and Padres will play a winner-take-all Game 5 of their National League Division Series on Friday night at Dodger Stadium, with the winner hosting the Mets in the NLCS two days later.",
        "Through four games of the NLDS, the Dodgers and Padres have two wins apiece.",
        "Each team has reached base 46 times via hit, walk, or hit by pitch. Los Angeles has scored 22 runs, and the Padres 21.",
        "The road team has scored first and homered in the top of the first inning in all four games so far.",
        "Wednesday night’s win at Petco Park in San Diego was the Dodgers’ first road playoff victory since Game 5 of the 2021 NLDS in San Francisco, snapping a seven-game postseason skid while wearing the road grays.",
        "Kiké Hernández got the start at third base in Game 4, and was 2-for-4, giving him eight different postseasons with the Dodgers in which he started a game, along with 2015-20 and 2023. That matched Justin Turner (2015-22) for the most such years in Dodgers franchise history.",
        "With no more pitchers hitting, Dave Roberts doesn’t get to double-switch any more. Just give him this indulgence, okay?",
        "Chris Taylor also now has seven different years starting a postseason game with the Dodgers (2017-22, 2024), as he started in centerfield in Game 4.",
        "The 8-0 win in Game 4 was the Dodgers’ most lopsided shutout win in postseason history, one run better than Game 5 of the 1965 World Series against the Twins. The Dodgers have 22 shutout wins in their postseason history.",
        "The Dodgers are 10-6 in winner-take-all games in the postseason, including 5-3 during this current run of 12 playoff appearances in a row. They’ve won the last three such games — 2020 NLCS Game 7 over Atlanta, the 2021 wild card game over the Cardinals at home (Taylor, hello), and Game 5 of the 2021 NLDS in San Francisco."
