        "The Washington Nationals had already clinched the season series with the Atlanta Braves by winning 7-games.",
        "Losing to them last night by a final score of 12-0 was nothing to feel good about. Poor defense started the mess followed by some bad pitches.",
        "Jose Tena has an.869 fielding percentage this season at the MLB level, and has become a major defensive liability.",
        "The Nats need to go 8-10 or better to beat the 2023 win total.",
        "The Nats are big underdogs today, at +150 to win on the moneyline.",
        "Dave Martinez went to Ildemaro Vargas to pitch the 9th inning and save some of his bullpen.",
        "The rest of the bullpen gave up at least one run each.",
        "The Nats starting pitchers have a combined ERA of 4.49 and rank 22nd in MLB.",
        "The Nats schedule looks like going forward, and the plan is to get Trevor Williams back into the rotation and finish the final week-and-a-half of the season with a 6-man rotation."
