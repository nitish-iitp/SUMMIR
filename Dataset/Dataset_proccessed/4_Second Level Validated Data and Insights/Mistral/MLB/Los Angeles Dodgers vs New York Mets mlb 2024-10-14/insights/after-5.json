    "Detailed Analysis": "In Game 2 of the NLCS, the Dodgers' record-tying 33-inning postseason scoreless streak ended quickly and in calamitous fashion as they lost to the Mets. Landon Knack, the first pitcher to trot out of the bullpen, gave up a grand slam in the second inning. The Dodgers' decision to go with a bullpen game in the match made sense in theory, but they declined to deploy their highest-leverage relievers early in the game. The series is now tied at one game apiece, with the next three games to be staged at Citi Field."
