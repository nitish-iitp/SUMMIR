St. Louis Cardinals vs Milwaukee Brewers Prediction

I’ll stay with Milwaukee. Civale is doing pretty well over his last trio—aside from three earned in 4.0 innings on August 23 versus the A’s. In the other pair of those three Civale is 2-0 with 13.0 innings and zero earned. As for Gray, he’s coming off a win over the Padres with one earned in 6.0 frames.

On Monday the Brewers mustered a relatively tepid seven hits, but the eight walks more than made up for it. Milwaukee only needed a couple of good innings to dispatch the Cardinals. I like the Brewers to keep it up on Tuesday.
