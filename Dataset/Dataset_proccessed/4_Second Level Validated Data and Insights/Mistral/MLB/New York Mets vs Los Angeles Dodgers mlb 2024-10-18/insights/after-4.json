        "The game was not over after the third inning. While the Dodgers were austere with their bullpen, their vaunted offense still did enough damage against the Mets' middle relief to pull within a grand slam in the sixth inning",
        "The Mets decided to take no chances, using set-up man Ryne Stanek and closer Edwin Diaz for the final 12 outs of the game"
