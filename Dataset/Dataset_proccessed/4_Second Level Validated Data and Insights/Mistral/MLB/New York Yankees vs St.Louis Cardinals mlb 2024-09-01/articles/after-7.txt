Jake Devin is a lifelong Yankees fan and an editor for Pinstripe Alley, which has been his internet home since 2016.

A step forward, a step back appears to be the theme at the moment. The Yankees followed a scintillating Friday night win with a tough Saturday afternoon loss, falling just short of a thrilling comeback. Will Warren was hit hard again, leaving it to Nestor Cortes to try and take the series today.

It’ll be another busy morning on the site ahead of today’s matinee. Peter will post our latest GM poll, gauging the fan base’s approval rating of Brian Cashman. Peter will also recap last night’s AL action, while Kevin will wind the clock back 25 years for the 1999 Yankees diary. With the calendar turning over, we’ll start our looks around the league, with Nick Power checking in on the AL West and Matt reviewing the AL Central, and after the game, John will take his weekly spin around Yankees social media.

New York Yankees vs. St. Louis Cardinals
