        "The San Diego Padres missed an opportunity to pad their Wild Card lead as they lost to the San Francisco Giants 6-3 on September 7, 2024.",
        "Fernando Tatis Jr. and Jackson Merrill were absent from the lineup due to unspecified reasons, which potentially affected the Padres' performance.",
        "Luis Arraez had three hits and has not struck out in a whopping 110 plate appearances, setting a long single-season streak by any player since Juan Pierre reached 147 in 2004.",
        "Manny Machado did not homer but remains on a tear, with his next blast moving him past Nate Colbert into sole possession of the franchise’s home run lead with 164.",
        "Ha-Seong Kim, who injured his right shoulder diving back into first base last month, is still not throwing across the diamond at 100% and his status is a concern for the Padres.",
        "Mason McCoy has been solid defensively in Kim’s place at shortstop but is hitting just.208 with two extra-base hits in 17 games."
