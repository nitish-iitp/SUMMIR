        "The Red Sox fell behind, 1-0, in the second inning with Brayan Bello on the mound. But a Ceddanne Rafaela triple off New York starter Luis Severino that snuck under the glove of a diving, overly aggressive Brandon Nimmo in center, backed by a Jarren Duran RBI single, quickly tied the game in the third.",
        "In the bottom half, Francisco Lindor reached on a single and Nimmo laced a ball to Duran in center. Duran came in, but the ball sailed over his head. Lindor scored for a 2-1 lead.",
        "In the fourth, Connor Wong dropped a Jeff McNeil foul ball. Although Bello retired McNeil via strikeout and induced a Starling Marte ground out, the next batter, DJ Stewart, kept the frame alive with a two-out single.",
        "Luis Torrens then tagged a Bello offering to left. The ball landed down the line near Tyler O’Neill, who appeared as though he had a play, but coasted to the spot. O’Neill tried to backhand the ball on a hop, but it deflected off his glove. Stewart scored from first on the error.",
        "Lindor then delivered the final blow in that inning with an RBI single."
