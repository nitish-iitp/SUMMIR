Orioles Coming Off A Win 

The Orioles on Tuesday scored five runs and that was enough for the two-run victory. Cedric Mullins had a strong game finishing with two hits and driving in three RBIs. The Orioles are averaging 4.93 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.29 runs per game. The offense is ranked 4th in the league while the pitching is ranked 14th. 

Anthony Santander has hit 39 home runs and driven in 91 RBIs. Getting the start for the Orioles will be Dean Kremer who sits with a 7-9 record and an ERA of 4.27. In his last start against the Tampa Bay Rays, he went six innings giving up two hits and zero runs. 

Why the Orioles Will Beat the Red Sox
The Red Sox have lost seven of their last eight games at Fenway Park against teams that held a winning record.
The underdogs have won three of the Orioles' last four games.
The Orioles have covered the run line in each of their last 12 games as road underdogs against American League opponents following a road win.
The Red Sox have failed to cover the run line in seven of their last eight games at Fenway Park against teams that held a winning record.
Red Sox Need These Wins

The Red Sox are battling for the playoff spot and they can’t be losing these games. The offense scored two runs in the 7th inning but it wasn’t enough as they were knocked out. The Red Sox are averaging 4.73 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.77 runs per game. The offense is ranked 10th in the league while the pitching is ranked 25th. Rafael Devers has hit 28 home runs and driven in 81 RBIs. Getting the start for the Red Sox will be Nick Pivetta who sits with a 5-10 record and an ERA of 4.38. In his last start against the Chicago White Sox, he went six innings giving up five hits and one run.

Baltimore Orioles vs Boston Red Sox Prediction

Both starters are coming off good starts but both have been inconsistent to start the season. The Orioles had Dean Kremer give up zero runs in his last start and he’s going to dominate again here. The Red Sox bats are going to really struggle to get anything going here and it’s going to be the Orioles that are going to get the job done. Back the Orioles on the run line to cash here.
