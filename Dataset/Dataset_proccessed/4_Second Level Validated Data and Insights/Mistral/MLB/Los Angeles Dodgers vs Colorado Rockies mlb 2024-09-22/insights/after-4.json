        "The Dodgers are still determined to stay ahead of the San Diego Padres and clinch the National League West division title",
        "Much has been made out of Ohtani’s addition to the Dodgers’ already deep and dangerous lineup with hopes he can help them get over the hump this postseason",
        "If he continues his clutch hitting, Hernandez could end up being the lineup addition that breaks the annual curse of Dodger bats freezing up in October",
        "With so many rotation arms continuing to be on the shelf and the bullpen having to endure a high workload, Buehler’s growth in stretching himself out coming off Tommy John is encouraging",
        "If he can eat up innings and compete in October, that will do wonders for a Dodger rotation that desperately needs it",
        "The Dodgers found themselves down 5-1 early and still trailed 5-4 heading into the bottom of the ninth",
        "Back-to-back home runs to win a game is not something seen every day, but that’s exactly what the Dodgers will need in the postseason given the perennial target on their back: improbable exciting feats of stardom in desperate moments",
        "Luckily, they have a roster full of players who can provide just that"
