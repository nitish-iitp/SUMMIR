Javeri Assad has been solid as of late. He has a 2.84 ERA this month, and giving up three runs last time out, was the most runs he had given up this month. Herz has also been great this month. In five starts he has not given up more than two earned runs while having a 2.22 ERA this month. Still, the big difference in this game will be the Cubs offense. The Nationals have not been nearly as good at the plate. Take the Cubs in this one.
