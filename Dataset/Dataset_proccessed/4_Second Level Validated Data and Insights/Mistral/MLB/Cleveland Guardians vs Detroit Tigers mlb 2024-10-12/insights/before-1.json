    "Detroit Tigers vs Cleveland Guardians Prediction": [
        "Give me Skubal with the season on the line. The Tigers wouldn’t rather have it any other way. Skubal has been dominant so far this season, and he’s going to dominate again here. He hasn’t given up a run yet in the playoffs, and I don’t think he will either against the Guardians offense. The Tigers are only going to need a couple of runs to get the job done, and they will get the job done. Back the Tigers on the money line."
