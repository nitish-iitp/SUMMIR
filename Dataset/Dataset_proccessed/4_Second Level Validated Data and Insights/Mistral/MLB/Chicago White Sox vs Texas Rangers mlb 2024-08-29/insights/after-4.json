        "Nick Nastrini pitched well in a 2-1 loss to the Texas Rangers, allowing one run on three hits and one walk with three strikeouts over six innings.",
        "Nastrini's first two stints with the White Sox were not successful, with an 0-5 record and an 8.39 ERA over six starts.",
        "Nastrini's hard work and refined mechanics led to improved performance in his return from Triple-A Charlotte.",
        "The White Sox (31-104) provided little support against Nathan Eovaldi, who allowed just a Gavin Sheets single with 10 strikeouts and two walks over seven innings.",
        "Andrew Benintendi’s 15th home run, coming off closer Kirby Yates in the ninth, helped Chicago avoid a 15th shutout."
