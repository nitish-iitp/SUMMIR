    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "The game was too important -- and the Padres had come too far to get here -- for any of that to get in the way of their objective."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "“We always play for each other,” Profar said. “When stuff like that happens, we seem to get a fire.”"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The Padres might hold an edge. Under the current 2-2-1 format, when a Division Series has been tied after two games, the team heading home for Games 3-4 has gone on to win the series 29 of 44 times (66%)."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The Padres tied a single-game MLB postseason record by hitting six home runs, including two from Tatis. The 2023 Phillies and 2015 Cubs previously also belted six (both in an NLDS Game 3), but the Padres became the first team to do so in a road playoff game."
