        "The Philadelphia Phillies clinched a playoff berth on Friday night with their 12-2 victory over the New York Mets. The Phillies, in turn, joined the Milwaukee Brewers, New York Yankees, Cleveland Guardians, and Los Angeles Dodgers in the postseason bracket. The Phillies have merely clinched a postseason berth. As a result, they are assured of being no worse than the third wild-card team. Their magic number to clinch the NL East -- the combination of Phillies wins and/or Mets losses needed to clinch the division -- is now just two. The Phillies could well secure the East title by the end of the weekend."
