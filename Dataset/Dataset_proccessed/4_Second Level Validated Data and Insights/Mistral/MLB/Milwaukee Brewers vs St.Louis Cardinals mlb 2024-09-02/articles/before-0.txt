Cash this Sal Frelick Prop vs Cardinals 9/2

The Milwaukee Brewers face off against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 2, 2024, at 2:10 PM EDT. With Sal Frelick's recent performances, we delve into his player props for this exciting matchup.

Game Summary

The St. Louis Cardinals (69-68) visit the Milwaukee Brewers (80-57) at American Family Field in Milwaukee. The Brewers have dominated the season series, winning 7 out of 10 matchups so far. In their last outing, the Cardinals showcased a powerful offense, defeating the New York Yankees 14-7, with Jordan Walker's impressive five-hit game leading the charge.

Milwaukee has been solid at home (40-25) and possesses one of the league's best records in games where they hit multiple home runs (30-8). Meanwhile, the Cardinals have struggled on the road, sitting with a 33-36 record, but their offense ranks fifth in the National League with 668 runs scored this season.

Expect a competitive matchup, especially with both teams looking to secure a crucial victory for their playoff hopes. The pitching matchup features Andre Pallante (6-6, 3.80 ERA) for St. Louis against Freddy Peralta (9-7, 3.70 ERA) for Milwaukee, setting the stage for an intriguing contest.

Player Analysis

Sal Frelick has been a consistent performer for the Brewers this season. His batting average sits around .283, and he has collected 21 home runs and 72 RBIs, making him a crucial part of the Brewers' lineup. His ability to get on base and drive in runs will be pivotal against the Cardinals.

Frelick has shown a knack for getting hits in crucial moments, making the Over 0.5 hits prop an enticing option. Additionally, his recent form suggests he could easily cross the 1.5 total bases mark, especially considering the Cardinals' pitching struggles.



Opposing Analysis

The Cardinals have had a mixed bag with their pitching throughout the season. Andre Pallante's ERA of 3.80 indicates he can be hit, especially if Frelick and the Brewers can capitalize on his mistakes. The Cardinals' bullpen has also struggled recently, which could provide additional scoring opportunities for Frelick and the Brewers.

Frelick's speed on the bases could play a significant role in the matchup. If he gets on base, the potential for stolen bases against a Cardinals pitching staff that has shown vulnerability in that area could yield a profitable return on the Over 0.5 stolen bases prop.



Starting Pitching Summary - Cardinals

Andre Pallante (6-6, 3.80 ERA) has had a solid season for the Cardinals but has shown inconsistency at times, allowing hitters to find success against him. With a WHIP of 1.32 and 68 strikeouts over 92.1 innings pitched, he will need to limit the damage against a potent Brewers lineup.



Starting Pitching Summary - Brewers

Freddy Peralta (9-7, 3.70 ERA) comes into this game with strong performances, boasting a WHIP of 1.19 and an impressive 172 strikeouts across 148.1 innings. His ability to rack up strikeouts while allowing fewer hits makes him a formidable opponent for the Cardinals' batting order.



Bullpen Summary - Cardinals

The Cardinals' bullpen has been a concern this season, with a combined ERA that ranks them near the bottom of the league. Their depth could be tested if Pallante struggles, making the Brewers' bats even more dangerous late in the game.



Bullpen Summary - Brewers

The Brewers' bullpen has been a strength, ranking among the top in the league with a solid ERA and a penchant for closing out games effectively. The depth behind Peralta will be crucial, especially if the game remains close.



Team Previews

The Cardinals rank fifth in the NL with 668 runs, showcasing a powerful offense. However, their pitching staff, with a team ERA of 4.17, ranks ninth in the league. The Brewers, while struggling offensively with just 572 runs, have excelled in pitching, particularly at home.
