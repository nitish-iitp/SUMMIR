St. Louis Cardinals vs Milwaukee Brewers Prediction

I’m going to stay with Milwaukee. Peralta is on a tear lately. He’s 2-0 in his last three starts with just one earned run in 17.0 combined innings on nine hits and seven walks. As for Pallante, he hasn’t been too bad himself with five earned in 19.2 innings for a 2-0 record over his last three.

On Sunday Milwaukee couldn’t score after the fifth inning while logging three errors and a tepid six team hits. The bullpen was solid for 4.0 innings (two hits; no walks; no earned; two Ks) but the bats refused to budge. Milwaukee needs to get it going at the plate Monday.
