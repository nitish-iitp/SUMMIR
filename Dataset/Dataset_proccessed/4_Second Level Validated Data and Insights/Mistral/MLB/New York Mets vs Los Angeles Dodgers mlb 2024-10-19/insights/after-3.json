    "Bullpens Lineup": [
        "Mets: The Mets will certainly do their best to take advantage of Saturday’s off-day, but after using Ryne Stanek for seven outs and Edwin Díaz for six in Game 5, they’ll be shorthanded heading into Game 6",
        "Dodgers: With Honeywell taking down most of the innings behind Jack Flaherty in Game 5, the Dodgers should be in good shape, with all of their high-leverage relievers being available for multiple innings, if needed"
    ],
    "Injuries of Note": [
        "Mets: Although McNeil hasn’t seen much live pitching since he fractured his right wrist on Sept. 6, he did pick up 10 plate appearances in the Arizona Fall League and eight more so far in the NLCS. Mendoza said McNeil’s contact approach lends itself well to a successful return despite his lack of recent reps. In any case, McNeil is fully healthy and capable of contributing when the Mets call on him",

    "Who is Hot and Who is Not": [
        "Mets: Heading into Friday, Alonso qualified for the “not hot” section of this FAQ. He responded with a three-run homer in the first inning and reached base safely in each of his first three Game 5 plate appearances. In the postseason, that’s how quickly things can change",
        "Dodgers: Betts has homered in back-to-back games for the second time this postseason and now has four home runs in October. Muncy has also been one of the team’s best hitters despite going 0-for-3 in Game 4",
        "The Dodgers are still waiting for Teoscar Hernández and Smith to give them more production. The two All-Stars have struggled against the Mets, with Hernández still searching for his first hit of the series"

        "In Game 5, the Mets became the first team since the 2022 Angels to avoid striking out in a postseason game. It has happened 11 times in the playoffs"
