Reds calling up Rhett Lowder – what can we expect to see?
 Doug Gray  08/28/2024 49

The Cincinnati Reds are calling up 2023 1st round and 7th overall draft pick Rhett Lowder to pitch on Friday night against the Milwaukee Brewers. The two teams will be playing a day/night doubleheader, but it hasn’t yet been announced if he will start the game at 12:40pm or the game at 6:40pm. C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic had the report first, beating Mark Sheldon of Reds.com by a matter of seconds to hit the “send tweet” button.

Before getting into what we could see and what we should expect, we should look back at what Rhett Lowder, the Reds #4 prospect, has done this season. He began the year in High-A Dayton. That was a bit of a surprise to many as he was considered as advanced as any pitcher in the 2023 draft and an assignment in High-A felt like it was a bit lower down the totem pole than it should have been given his time in college. For the most part he breezed through the league and posted a 2.49 ERA in five starts and in early May moved up to Double-A Chattanooga.

In his first start with the Lookouts he was solid, but unspectacular, allowing three runs in five innings. But then things went south. Over his next two starts he allowed 12 earned runs in just 6.1 combined innings and gave up 14 hits. Things did get better by comparison after that, but he still battled some consistency issues over the next five weeks. In that time he made seven starts and allowed 40 hits in 32.0 innings with a 5.06 ERA. In that stretch he had an 11-strikeout game, but followed it up be having just one strikeout combined in the next two starts.

Then it was like a light switch was turned on. Beginning with his start on July 9th he went on to give up four entire runs over a 6-start stretch while throwing 34.0 innings and allowing just 20 hits. That’s a 1.06 ERA in a 5-week span for those who didn’t want to do the math (and who would blame you for that?).

While some of his early struggles didn’t allow him to fully recover his ERA with that dominant run, it was enough for the Reds to believe he was ready to move up to Triple-A. Last week he made his debut for Louisville and threw six shutout innings and allowed just three hits, walked no one, and he had seven strikeouts. You can see his career stats here.

Now with Cincinnati literally running out of starting pitching options both in the big leagues and in Triple-A, it’s time for Lowder to step up to another level once again. The front office probably wouldn’t make this call if there weren’t an entire rotation and a half on the injured list between Cincinnati and Louisville right now – but there is. And Rhett Lowder is not only healthy, but he’s been absolutely lights out for quite a while now. It’s a bit of a rush job in one sense because the circumstances have kind of dictated his call up, but he’s also done everything he can to show he might be ready to face big league hitters, too.

Here’s some video from his start with Louisville.

What can we expect to see?

While we only have one game’s worth of pitch tracking data for Rhett Lowder – all Triple-A games push this data to the public – that data seems to look similar to what the memory of watching all of his other starts showed. He will have a good mix of a 4-seamer, 2-seamer, slider, and change up.

He has good stuff across the board, but nothing is elite. There’s nothing wrong with that – having four quality big league pitches can take you a very long way in the game of baseball. It’s possible that his 4-seam fastball is his worst offering and it’s still grading out as an average to above-average pitch that works in the 93-95 MPH range and touches 97.

The slider is probably his best pitch. It works in the mid-80’s and has downward, biting action. His change up (works around 88 MPH) and 2-seamer  (works 92-95) can both be above-average offerings, too.

One thing to keep an eye on, though, is his location. Lowder has had good control all year. But his command has not always been good. When he was struggling this year he was simply catching way too much of the middle of the plate with his pitches and guys were making him pay for it. Big leaguers would likely to the same, and more. He’s been able to command his stuff better and the results have followed.

No one is going to confuse Rhett Lowder with a guy like Hunter Greene. Not many guys should be confused with Greene, who this season has come into his own and been one of the best pitchers in the league. Lowder doesn’t have that big swing-and-miss stuff. He’s got quality stuff that can keep guys off balance, get some swings-and-misses and weak contact – but his profile is more that of a pitcher who should pound the strikezone with multiple offerings, keep the walks low, get ground balls when he needs them, and has the kind of stuff that he could see a lineup a third time through and still be showing them something different.

I saw one national baseball writer say Lowder was likely a high floor, low ceiling guy and I’m not really sure I can agree with that. While I don’t think it’s likely that Lowder turns into an ace, a low ceiling guy to me is more like a 4th starter-ish kind of guy. And again, there’s nothing wrong with that kind of guy. But Lowder seems to me to have a higher ceiling than that.

Now, what we’ll see on Friday is a question without an answer. Sometimes guys just let the nerves get to them a bit and they aren’t quite themselves in their debut. You never really know how that’s going to play out until it actually plays out. But if he is something close to his normal self expect to see plenty of mixing and matching of pitches, good control (throwing strikes), and ground ball.

Any idea if he’s the 27th man for Friday, or is he going to stick (largely out of necessity).

Oldtimer 08/28/2024

Reds called up Homer Bailey at age 21 in 2007 for similar reasons. Again in 2008. He finally stuck in 2009 and had a 14 year MLB career. Not great but not bad. Two no hitters. Not many have done that.

JohnnySofa 08/28/2024

And then the Reds signed Bailey to a six-year, $105M contract that they regretted soon after. The deal cornered them into trading Cueto — a disastrous trade. Not exactly the good old times.

Doug Gray 08/28/2024

The Reds could have signed Cueto. They chose not to. They weren’t cornered into anything.

JohnnySofa 08/28/2024

There’s no way they were signing Cueto after the Bailey contract and $200M Votto contract.

Doug Gray 08/28/2024

They could have chose to sign Cueto instead of either one of those guys. They didn’t. It’s not Homer’s fault. It’s not Joey’s fault. It’s not Johnny’s fault. It’s the Reds ownership and or at the time their General Manager’s fault.

JayTheRed 08/28/2024

I never liked the Bailey deal even when it was first signed. I always felt he was an ok #3 pitcher, a decent #4 pitcher and a good #5 pitcher. They should have saved their money and spent it on Cueto.

JohnnySofa 08/28/2024

That’s my point above, which on a second and third reading seems pretty clear. Because they signed Bailey, even despite his inconsistency, they could not sign Cueto. I never said anything remotely close to it being Homer’s fault, Joey’s fault, or Johnny’s fault. It was a huge mistake by the front office, as usual.

DW 08/28/2024

Thank you for your responses here Doug.

Mauired 08/28/2024

Bailey contract was a farce. Had an injury history and was no surprise he spent most of the contract on the DL. He got 100 million for two amazing games.

I personally wanted Cueto instead but he only had a couple good years in San Francisco and was hurt as well. Giants paid him a lot of money to rehab.

Doug Gray 08/28/2024

Homer Bailey threw 417 innings of 3.58 ERA baseball the two years before he signed his deal. Two amazing games?

Mauired 08/29/2024

He was a 49-45 with a 4.25 career ERA when he received his undeserved 100 million dollar contract. He was a mediocre pitcher.

During the contract for the Reds he was worse than mediocre. 18-32 and 5.27 ERA.

Doug Gray 08/29/2024

The Reds and no one else should have cared one bit about what he had done in the distant past because that is not the guy they were signing, nor is it the guy that he was. For the two seasons directly prior to his signing he was one of the 25 best starting pitchers in Major League Baseball. And he was keeping that going until his arm blew up. He was never the same after the injury. But I’m not gonna stand idly by and let this stupid idea that the Reds were dumb for signing Homer Bailey in 2014 because in 2007 and 2008 he sucked in the big leagues. That dude was real good for three years, then his elbow exploded. Twice.

jmb 08/29/2024

I guess that we can’t say the Bailey contract was a head-scratcher, but I wasn’t pleased when I heard the news. I thought Cueto deserved such a contract more. But then, Cueto was only real good two season since he left the Reds: 2016 and 2022, and the latter would not have been included in a Reds contract, unless they decided to resign him after the big one ended, and that would not have happened if he was injured as much as he was with the Giants Bailey was only good the season he signed his contract: 2014. But he never had a bounce-back season.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Maloney came up in 1960. It took him until 1963 to really get settled into being an ace SP for Reds.

Homer Bailey had a decent career in MLB. Good at times, not as good other times.

I’ve only known one billionaire in my 73 years (the late Michel Fribourg who owned Continental Grain, which was $20B annual revenue in 1980). It is my experience that billionaires like Mr. Fribourg or the current Reds owner can afford most anything they want. Sometimes they don’t want.

LDS 08/28/2024

It will interesting to see the outcome. A good outcome and sticking for the rest of the year would be a good start on 2025’s rotation.

Eric the Red 08/28/2024

If he comes up as an extra guy for the doubleheader, is that somehow better from a years of control standpoint vs a regular call up? Does any of that even matter anymore, or have the service time rules changed?

Doug Gray 08/28/2024

One game doesn’t change anything (for now).

Eric the Red 08/28/2024

Thanks for clarifying. I’ve lost track of this stuff.

David 08/28/2024

This. Exactly this. He could get away with some bad location pitches in High A, just because he had good stuff. At AA level, he was getting kind of hammered for a while.
He learned something about location and locating IN the strike zone.

He will probably get lit up by the Brewers on Friday night. But I think with some experience, he will be pretty good. He has pretty good command of all his pitches, and seems like a fast learner.

RedAlert 08/28/2024

I bet he won’t get lit up either ….dude has a nasty arsenal and knows how to pitch . He might , but I’m betting against it .

Kevin H 08/28/2024

I saw Acuna was brought to triple A. Would he be a candidate to be called up as well. I know he was injured for awhile.

Doug Gray 08/28/2024

He’s not really stretched out at this point. But again – they are literally running out of arms. So anything is possible at this point. And I do mean that without hyperbole.

Kevin H 08/28/2024

Thanks Doug,

Frostgiant80 08/29/2024

“So anything is possible at this point. And I do mean that without hyperbole.” Is this a hint that Doug might be making an appearance out of the bullpen?

Melvin 08/29/2024

” Is this a hint that Doug might be making an appearance out of the bullpen?”

I think I’d pay extra to see that. 

jmb 08/29/2024

Acuna does not get the respect he deserves. Hector Rodriguez is the Reds’ #12 prospect and Acuna isn’t even in the top 30! But it may very well be that it’s Acuna who turns out to be the better of those two players who came over in the Naquin trade. Not sure if he’ll be a starter, though.

Stock 08/28/2024

I see no reason not to keep him up here the rest of the year. He is in no danger of losing rookie eligibility. This winter based upon this additional information they acquire by having him spend September in Cincinnati, they can decide if he should begin the year in Cincinnati or Louisville.

If he spends the entire 2025 season in Cincinnati, then the Reds have control through the 2030 season. It does not matter if he spends September in Cincinnati or Louisville.

If he spends September in Cincinnati and the Reds send him to Louisville in April, the Reds need to keep him in Louisville for 6 weeks during 2025 to obtain control through 2031. If he spends less than that they have control through 2030.

If the Reds send him back to Louisville after the game, the Reds need to keep him in Louisville for 2 weeks during 2025 to obtain control through 2031. If he spends less than that they have control through 2030.

There is precedent for sending a top 100 prospect back down to the minors after being called up in September. Last year Junior Caminero was called up for 20 days in September. This year Caminero was finally called back up in August.

If Lowder spends the entire season on the Roster, the Reds could gain a draft pick if he wins ROY. If he makes the opening day roster and he stinks the Reds can send him down as the Cardinals did with Jordan Walker. This could also gain the Reds another year of control.

Optimist 08/28/2024

Opportunity knocks loudly for the rest of this season. If any 2 of Aguiar, Spiers, and Lowder finish strong they’ll be set for the spring. Even getting Acuna up as a multi inning reliever to close out the season may show them something for the spring.

If Greene can continue to develop into the ace/#1 he’s has been for several months now, a team can go a long way with an ace and several #3-4 level starters. I’d echo Doug’s comment that Lowder’s ceiling isn’t as low as a #4 – if he can be a reliable enough 150 ip/year at 3.5-4 era he’ll have a long profitable career with an AS appearance or 2. Even lesser production would be valuable.

We shall see.

The Duke 08/29/2024

At this point, why not go young and not have to shell out 8 figures to a starter on a one year deal with an option for year two and a buyout? There will still be depth in the minor leagues and they can take whatever cash they have earmarked for free agency and try to find a bat for one of the corners that can be an anchor in the middle of the lineup.

Hunter Greene
Nick Lodolo
Rhett Lowder
Andrew Abbott
Julian Aguiar

Three righties, two lefties, and you tell the likes of Greene, Lodolo, and Abbott that it’s time for them to step up and be the veterans of the staff. Move Carson Spiers into the Nick Martinez swingman role, move a hopefully healthy Ashcraft into the bullpen, move Diaz out of a fixed closers role, and maybe add one quality bullpen arm in free agency. You have an 8 man bullpen, so that looks like (LI for Late Innings as opposed to a Setup (SU) or Closer (CL):

LR: Carson Spiers
MR: Emelio Pagan (He’s under contract, he’ll be here)
MR: Sam Moll
MR: Fernando Cruz
MR: FA RP or Tejay Antone or Yosver Zulueta or ???
LI: Alexis Diaz
LI: Graham Ashcraft
LI: Tony Santillan

Moll is the only left handed reliever there, so odds are pretty high they bring in at least one more lefty.

jon 08/30/2024

Reds need to go out and get a legit #1 or #2 starter in free agency.We know they won’t but here’s hoping.

jmb 08/29/2024

If Lowder, Spiers, and Aguiar are all in the rotation next season, then Lodolo should be traded–try to get some value when you can, and let some other team worry about his health. I’d trade him to the Angels for Detmers, who’s a year younger and is more durable, even though he’s going through a rough patch at present. Williamson, Ashcroft, and Junis are other guys who could compete for a rotation spot.

Old-school 08/28/2024

Mike leake?

Optimist 08/28/2024

Very good career. If Lowder matches that as the #4/5 starter they contend every year. As a #3 starter they’re over .500 every year.

Mike W 08/28/2024

Espinal is the real deal!
Don’t mess with that Reds.

jmb 08/29/2024

The Reds will trade him back to the Jays in a deal that brings Bichette over. There was some real love for Espinal in Toronto when the Reds were there. Maybe Candy could be part of the deal, just to even out the money a bit.

Mike W 08/28/2024

Question for whomever moderates this site:
An hour ago I wrote:
“Espinal is the real deal. Don’t mess with that Reds.”
Clearly meaning don’t trade him.
Please explain for all on this site, why that post was not allowed to be seen? I certainly don’t understand. Thank you!…..MW

Mike W 08/28/2024

Got it — thx Doug! You’re awesome.

I live 12 miles from the Niners stadium and am a 60 year Raiders fan, but fading with them moving to Vegas. How do the Bengals look this year for any Cincinnati residents?

Anthony 08/28/2024

Rhett Lowder appears to be a tremendous prospect but am worried bringing him up in the midst of this imploding season is not good in long run. As a Bengal fan too getting vibes of starting David Klingler year end in 92 with no support around him. Hope im wrong but it seems like waiting till 25 was the better plan at this point ?

Doug Gray 08/28/2024

I don’t think defensive linemen are going to kill Rhett Lowder, though. That’s the difference. By and large he controls the outcome of his pitches.

Frostgiant80 08/29/2024

Maybe he pitches a great game and gives up one run. Learns his offense can’t be trusted and loses 1-0. What is the over under on a red getting nailed at home on a contact play tonight?

Anthony 08/29/2024

Lowder looks like a keeper. But perhaps shouldn’t be pushed out there with these fires burning all around him offensively, defensively, medical-training-manager-pitching coach etc especially vs Milwaukee. Very worried that only the other injuries to everyone else has led to this move at this moment in time and waiting till theres a new mood in 2025 might not be best for him in long run? We’ll see but dont want another top pitching prospect injured or not prospering here under these conditions.

Simms11 08/29/2024

It’s one game. Give him a taste. It’s not like he hasn’t pitched in big situations before. The idea or “fear of injury” shouldn’t even be in the conversation. As far as “mood” goes, I’m not really understanding your point. These guys are paid to play…..we need to stop worrying about the fragility of players IMO.

lars 08/29/2024

If he is scheduled to pitch on Friday, when is he scheduled to go on the IL?

Do not post stuff like this. It’s not cute or funny.

Doug Gray 08/29/2024

This is just a warning for everyone – I’m absolutely not going to put up with garbage posting like this. I will revoke commenting privileges over stuff like this.

MK 08/29/2024

I would assume he is 27th man for Friday so a 40-man spot doesn’t need to be opened up.
I do think there is value for prospects to stop at each level of the minors as there are things to learn at each stop. I’ve seen a lot of highly thought of prospects who have skipped a step who did not make it.

jmb 08/29/2024

I don’t like the idea of him being rushed to the bigs. He does seem to have figured out AA after a rough start there, but he only has one start at AAA! They have other guys they could bring up. I hope they aren’t making a mistake here. With Greene and Lodolo so injury prone, hate to see another of their #1 pitching picks go that way.

Doug Gray 08/29/2024

I mean they are calling up those other guys, too. The fact is pretty simple: The club doesn’t really have much of a choice. They are literally out of starting pitchers.

Here’s the list of players currently in Louisville who have made two starts this season and haven’t been called up and are healthy:

Randy Wynne – a 31-year-old with 1 big league game who has a 4.27 ERA. Could have called him up.
Justus Sheffield – He has an ERA of 7.71.
Connor Phillips – He spent 2+ months out in Goodyear not pitching in games because he was so bad. He’s back in Louisville now for the last week and has a 9.57 ERA.

That’s it. That’s the list. Everyone else is hurt or has been called up. So the options were two guys who couldn’t get through three innings facing you every at bat, Randy Wynne, or Rhett Lowder.
