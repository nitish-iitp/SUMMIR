        "The Mets lost Game 3 of the NLCS to the Dodgers with a score of 8-0, putting them in a 2-1 hole in the series.",
        "The Mets' lineup remained the same as in Game 2, despite a lackluster performance in Game 3.",
        "Manager Carlos Mendoza expressed confidence in his players, stating that they got the team to this point and will continue to step up.",
        "Jeff McNeil, who was not fully healthy for the first seven games of the postseason, was not used as a pinch-hitter in Game 3.",
        "Anthony Banda was warming up in the bullpen for the Dodgers, leading to the decision to keep Jose Iglesias in the game instead of using McNeil.",
        "Iglesias grounded into an inning-ending double play in the sixth inning, which could have potentially changed the game's outcome.",
        "McNeil and Jesse Winker, who had been performing well, are likely to remain sidelined due to the opposing pitcher's reverse platoon splits."
