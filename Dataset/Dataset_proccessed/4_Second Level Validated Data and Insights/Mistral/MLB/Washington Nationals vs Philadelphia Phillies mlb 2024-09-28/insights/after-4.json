        "The Nats need to go 2-0 to surpass their 2023 win total and that is a big ask. Win one game and the Nats would tie the 71-win mark from 2023. The Nats are big underdogs today at +170 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $100 you would win $170. Bet $10.00 and you win $17.00. Dave Martinez had the big lead and that gave him the opportunity to rest his “A” bullpen."
