        "Kyle Hendricks, the longest-tenured member and last remaining player from the 2016 World Series team, gave a potential final masterclass performance in a 3-0 victory over the Reds.",

        "Hendricks is set to hit free agency, adding uncertainty to the next chapter of his career.",
        "Hendricks' debut season was also the year that the Cubs brought pitching coach Tommy Hottovy aboard as a run prevention coordinator.",

        "Hendricks started Game 7 of that Fall Classic in Cleveland and boasts a 3.12 ERA in 12 career playoff games."
