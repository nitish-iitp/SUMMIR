        "The Guardians and Tigers are AL Central rivals and thus possess plenty of institutional knowledge about each other.",
        "The Tigers are fresh off slaying an October behemoth in their sweep of the Houston Astros and will look to continue their improbable run.",
        "The Guardians and their imposing bullpen are well-rested with what will be nearly a week between games."

        "The Guardians won the season series, 7-6. (Total score of 50-60)."

    "Others": [
        "Tarik Skubal and ‘pitching chaos,’ to use a phrase coined by Tigers manager A.J. Hinch. Skubal, who’ll win the AL Cy Young this year, was brilliant in his Game 1 start against the Astros, delivering six innings of four-hit, shutout ball.",
        "José Ramírez is a superstar who’s often underappreciated because of the market he plays in. The third baseman clubbed 39 homers, recorded 41 steals and posted 6.5 wins above replacement this season and when you look at his spectacular career, it’s a wonder that more people don’t revere him.",
        "Closer Emmanuel Clase is enjoying a season for the ages while Canadian rookie Cade Smith has been a revelation at the back end.",
        "The Tigers depend on playing the matchup game and platoon advantages, but just like the Kansas City Royals, who’ll play the New York Yankees in the other division series, this club is power deficient.",
        "The Guardians offence can seem weak and has struggled to score runs for most of the season.",
        "It’ll all come down to the managers. Hinch versus Guardians’ first-year bench boss Stephen Vogt will be fun to watch and could essentially decide the series."
