MLB Playoffs Picks: Guardians vs. Tigers – Game 1 ALDS Prediction

The ALDS kicks off on October 5, 2024, with the Cleveland Guardians (92-69) hosting the Detroit Tigers (86-76) at Progressive Field. The Guardians, who finished the regular season strong at home with a 50-30 record, are looking to capitalize on their success against the Tigers, having won three previous meetings with Tanner Bibee on the mound this season. Meanwhile, Detroit comes into this matchup after beating Houston twice, but will face a tough challenge in Cleveland.

As the #1 MLB expert at KingPin Pro, I’ll break down this crucial Game 1 and provide my expert pick for the series opener. Check out my Phillies vs Mets Game 1 Prediction for more MLB postseason insights.

 

Team Overview
Cleveland Guardians Overview

The Guardians come into this game with a well-balanced lineup and one of the best home records in the AL. Offensively, José Ramírez has been the engine, hitting 39 home runs and driving in 118 runs. Outfielder Steven Kwan leads the team with a .292 average, and the Guardians have a solid overall team batting average of .238. They also boast a strong bullpen, and their team ERA matches Detroit at 3.61.

Pitching in Game 1 will be Tanner Bibee, who has performed well against Detroit in the regular season. Bibee has consistently kept the Tigers' lineup in check, contributing to three Cleveland victories in his starts against them.

Detroit Tigers Overview

The Tigers, who finished tied with Kansas City in the AL Central standings at 86-76, enter the postseason after winning two of their last three games against Houston. Their key offensive player, Riley Greene, has posted 24 home runs with a .262 average, leading the Tigers' lineup. However, Detroit's offense has been inconsistent, especially against quality pitching like Cleveland's.

Tyler Holton is set to start for the Tigers. He has been used sparingly this season but will need to step up against a strong Guardians lineup that has excelled at home. Detroit will need a standout performance to keep Cleveland's bats in check.

Odds Table
Team	Moneyline	Runline	Total
Detroit Tigers	+130	+1.5 (-175)	Over 6.5 (-145)
Cleveland Guardians	-155	-1.5 (+145)	Under 6.5 (+120)
Prediction

Tanner Bibee has been a key factor in Cleveland’s success against Detroit this season, and with home-field advantage, the Guardians have the upper hand going into this matchup. Cleveland’s offense, led by José Ramírez, should be able to take advantage of Tyler Holton's limited experience in starting high-pressure games. Given that the Guardians have beaten the Tigers in all three of Bibee’s starts this season, they are in a strong position to take Game 1.

Pick: Cleveland Guardians moneyline (-155)
