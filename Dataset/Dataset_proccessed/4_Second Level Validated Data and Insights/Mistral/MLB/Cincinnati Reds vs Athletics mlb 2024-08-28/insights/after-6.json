        "The Reds are running out of starting pitchers in both the big leagues and in Triple-A. That has led to back-to-back days where the team is utilizing a reliever as a starter. Today that reliever will be Fernando Cruz.",
        "The season for Bido began in Triple-A. He made a spot start in a doubleheader in early May, but outside of that he spent the first 12 weeks of the year in the minors. Oakland called him up in late June and he pitched out of the bullpen for the next month before moving into the rotation. He got knocked around on July 28th by the Angels, giving up seven runs in 3.2 innings. Since then he’s made four starts with a 1.17 ERA in 23.0 innings and hasn’t allowed a home run."
