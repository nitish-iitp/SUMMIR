Philadelphia Phillies vs Miami Marlins Prediction

I’m leaning toward Philly. You could make a great case for trying Miami on a value play, though. The line’s probably too thick to mess with anyway. Wheeler is a tepid 1-1 in his last three starts combined but he’s been pitching well. In that trio, Wheeler has 19.0 innings with just four earned on 16 hits and two walks. As for Cabrera, he’s 1-2 in his last three starts with seven earned in 16.2 frames combined.

On Thursday the Phillies had a pretty solid all-around game The bullpen was decent with three hits and an earned run from Max Lazar being the only real blemish. I like Philly to keep it going Friday.
