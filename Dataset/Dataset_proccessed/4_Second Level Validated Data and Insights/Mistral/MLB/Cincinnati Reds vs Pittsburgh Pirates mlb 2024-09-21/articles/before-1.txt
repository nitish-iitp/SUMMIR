Elly De La Cruz has a record setting night for the Reds
 Doug Gray  09/20/2024 23

Elly De La Cruz has seemingly re-written the record books over the last two years. Many times it’s been a record in the Cincinnati Reds books, but more than a few times it’s also been the Major League Baseball record book. Friday night saw him wind up with his name in a new column in both.

During Friday’s game against Pittsburgh we saw De La Cruz steal his 65th base of the season in the 4th inning. That also happened to be his 100th of his career. That steal made him the 3rd player in MLB history to have 100 stolen bases in their first two big league seasons. He joined Rickey Henderson and Vince Coleman on the list.

That stolen base also put him in the 100 steals/100 extra-base hits club in his first two seasons in the big leagues. He got there faster than anyone else has ever done. Juan Samuel previously held the record, but Elly De La Cruz got there two games quicker. Samuel was once a coach in the Cincinnati Reds farm system. He was with the club for one season. That year he happened to be the bench coach for the Dayton Dragons. The shortstop on that team in the first half? Elly De La Cruz.

With his 65 steals on the season, De La Cruz passed up the Atlanta Braves. They have 64 on the year. He’s also tied with the Minnesota Twins. Cincinnati’s shortstop is also just one behind the San Francisco Giants. That should be a fun race to track over the final week-and-a-half of the regular season.

On the flip side of things, De La Cruz also struck out twice in the game. The first time saw him tie the club record for strikeouts in a season. The second strikeout put him down as the leader, surpassing Drew Stubbs on the list with 206.

Notice how we grouse about his high K number at times … but he most certainly ain’t Drew Stubbs … 

I see him continuously improving. 2025 could be something special from this young man. Something REALLY special.

Thanks for this article, Doug.

Why bring Dunn and Rece Hinds up to the bigs and then start Will Benson (AKA strikeout King) and leave Hinds and Dunn languishing on the bench?

Mauired 09/20/2024

I believe if Elly gets another 5 steals, he will join Eric Davis as the only 25/70 player in MLB history in their first full season.

Just to show how dominant Eric the Red was though. In 1986 he had 27 homers and 80 steals in just 132 games. Also with a .901 OPS. He did slow down alot after. 50 steals in 1987. And never more than 35 for the rest of his career.

greenmtred 09/21/2024

What might have been. Minus the injuries, Eric the Red might very well have put up Willie Mays numbers.

Leaving the game yesterday afternoon, they were handing out packs of Topps cards of the Reds stars. I’m way too old to accumulate any more stuff in this house, but my young nephew will be over the moon when I give him an Elly card for his birthday on Sunday

It’s give and take with EDLC. Do you have his steal success rate, Doug? I saw Shohei’s stealing stats and it’s quite amazing: 55 attempts, 51 successful.

Mauired 09/20/2024

That is amazing. I think someone said he’s just 115th in sprint speed. Off the chart talent obviously. But his baseball IQ is an underrated part of the equation.

BK 09/20/2024

80.2%

CincyDo 09/20/2024

Thanks. EDLC is more of a stealing volume leader than a steal leader. In my view Shohei is the steal leader.

Dan 09/21/2024

Shohei’s 93% success rate is off-the-charts incredible, but 80% for Elly is still very good.

BK 09/21/2024

I’ll go a little further, while there certainly are other factors involved, Ohtani’s rate may be too high. In other words, he may not be aggressive enough to maximize his value WRT base stealing.

Votto4life 09/20/2024

It’s been a great season for Elly. He is worth the price of admission.

Have to wonder how long the Reds will hang on to Elly. To maximize the return, they will probably have to trade him in a couple of years. The problem is though, no matter how many prospects the Reds get in return, they will never get equal value. It’s a shame.

VegasRed 09/21/2024

The shame is if they don’t put a real team with a real manager around him the next couple years.

CI3J 09/21/2024

The same was always said about Joey Votto.

But at least Votto had a few seasons with Dusty in charge. For that brief, glorious time, the Reds were relevant again.

Hopefully Elly gets to experience something similar. He deserves more people watching him.

Votto4life 09/21/2024

Elly will end up with a big market team and will be surrounded by all stars. He will get all the money and attention he deserves.

I feel sorry for Reds fans who will be in the middle of yet another rebuild in a couple of years.

mac624 09/21/2024

He’s under team control until 2029. So at least 4 more years he will be a Red. But I agree, I expect they trade him instead of paying him especially if the current ownership group is still involved. Now if a young Gen X Billionaire comes along, I might change my thinking, but I’m not holding my breath. The Reds can’t get that lucky. I expect they will spend enough, and hope injuries don’t take away enough to try and battle for that wild card spot for the next few seasons. But they aren’t going to do any more than that.

MBS 09/21/2024

@Votto, “Have to wonder how long the Reds will hang on to Elly.”

I’ve wondered the same thing. There is the 1 or 2 year extension possibility, but as many have noted his agent advises against those, so maybe a tough sell. Then there is the mega contract. Since he is so young and controllable for so long, you have to think it’s going to need to be a Tatis like deal. Tatis signed 14Y for $340M in 2021, so 14Y for $380M? That’s $27M AAV, but I don’t know if he’ll even go for that.

He’d be our modern Votto if we go down that road, and the Reds have shown they were unwilling, or unable to build a team around Votto (Superstar), so why would we believe they would build a team around EDLC (Superstar potential)?

I would approach EDLC with extension talks at the end of the season. If he’s not open to them, the Reds need to sign a big FA or 2 to play alongside him for the next 5 years. Santander is the name that gets floated around and makes a lot of sense for the Reds. Even if we do sign EDLC to that extension, it will most likely be back ended, so we could sign Santander to big money today without EDLC’s contract effecting the club’s ability to afford it.

Votto4life 09/21/2024

I would be shocked if Elly signed an extension. Why would he? He is going to get a shocking payday when he becomes a free agent.

It would be equally foolish for the Reds to hold on to him for 3 1/2 more years and get a Chase Petty type of return for him.

The Reds will never get equal value for Elly, but they will trade him while they can get something of value for him.

I suspect they will make a trade similar to what the Nationals got for Soto. I mean the Reds still lose the deal, but they can’t afford to trade him in his walk season. That would be foolish.

Let’s hope they don’t follow the path the Angels took with Othani.

Pseudo GM 09/21/2024

Yeah, I see it like you. Barring a severe downturn, Elly is a franchise player. He is the cornerstone for building a club, and you know he’ll keep stadium seats filled. Trading your MVP for ‘prospects’ is akin to violating the old adage, “a bird in hand is with two in the bush.” Not smart baseball.

Old-school 09/21/2024

Nice season for the 22 year old superstar. Great to see. He now has scored 102 runs which is remarkable. Looking through the 100 runs scored category, he has a chance to score more than any Red in the 2000’s. Votto has multiple years at 106/107. Choo had one year, Phillips had one and Adam Dunn had many, including 108 one year. Elly could score more runs than any Red since Larkin and Davis who both had over 110.

Redsgettingbetter 09/21/2024

Rickey Henderson and Vince Coleman, wow!, what a fast players short club joined by Elly
I’m waiting for the 25th Elly’s blast and 5 more steals which should come sooner than later in these 7 games remaining so he rounds the 25-70 season.

greenmtred 09/21/2024

I hope he does it. Without data, it seems to me that he has significantly reduced his steal attempts recently.
