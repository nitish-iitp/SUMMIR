Tampa Bay Rays vs Detroit Tigers Prediction

I might try the Tigers here. Probably not touching it, though. Olson had a rough outing versus KC in his return on September 16, notching four earned on four hits and a walk in 2.1 frames. In his last outing versus the Orioles, however, Olson put up 3.0 innings with one earned on one hit and a walk.

On Wednesday the Tigers had a pretty nice offensive outing with almost everyone contributing to the action. Detroit used five arms out of the bullpen in a solid overall pitching effort. If Olson can get off to a good start here the Tigers will be set up nicely.
