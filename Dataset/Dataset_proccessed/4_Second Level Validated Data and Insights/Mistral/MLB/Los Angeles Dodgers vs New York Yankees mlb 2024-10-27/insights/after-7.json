        "The Dodgers offense has been a significant reason for their 2-0 series advantage, hitting.248/.340/.451 with an MLB-best 121 wRC+, 24 home runs, and 6.15 runs per game this postseason"
    ],
    "Others": [
        "The Dodgers kept both games close thanks in large part to very good starting pitching, with Jack Flaherty allowing just two runs in his 5⅓ innings in Game 1 and Yoshinobu Yamamoto even stingier with only a Juan Soto solo home run in his 6⅓ innings in Game 2",
        "The big difference has been from everyone else. The Dodgers got home runs from Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman in Game 2. The other guys in LA’s lineup through two games are hitting.225/.256/.500 with six extra-base hits, four RBI, and five runs scored",
        "Yankees outside of the big three are hitting just.174/.269/.196 with one extra-base hit (a Gleyber Torres double), one run scored (by Jazz Chisholm Jr.), and one RBI (by Anthony Volpe) through two games"
