    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "There were two outs and runners on the corners when Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm came to the plate. After getting ahead 2-0, Bohm swung away and hit a towering fly ball into shallow centerfield. That's where second baseman Jose Altuve, shortstop Jeremy Pena and centerfielder Jake Meyers converged on the ball as it fell safely to the ground. The ball appeared to hit both Pena and Meyers in the feet as they went down. As Altuve tried to avoid falling, left fielder Mauricio Dubon ran in to actually pick the ball up."
