        "The Dodgers won the NLDS against the Padres with a dominant bullpen performance, allowing only two runs in 25⅔ innings. The final time the Padres scored during the series was in the third inning of Game 3. Kiké Hernández had three hits in his two starts during the series, including a home run in Game 5 that provided half of the runs. The Dodgers improved their record in elimination games under Dave Roberts to 13-7 (.650)."
