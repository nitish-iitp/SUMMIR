        "Aaron Nola had a short start against the Marlins, going 4 2/3 innings with 5 runs (4 earned) on 9 hits (2 homers) and 2 walks while striking out 5.",
        "Nola's command was off, and he used his four-seam fastball and knuckle curve more than usual.",
        "Garrett Stubbs helped Nola navigate the Marlins’ less experienced lineup and bailed him out offensively with a four-hit game, including two bunts that resulted in a Little League triple and an RBI single."
