        "The North Siders woke up in a big way in the top of the 5th inning, erupting for four runs keyed by a sacrifice fly off the bat of Pete Crow-Armstrong.",
        "Nico Hoerner dashed home on a groundout to the pitcher by Ian Happ to put the Cubs ahead.",
        "Assad surrendered a run on a wild pitch in the bottom of the frame but finished strong, eventually going six innings to maintain the 4-3 lead.",
        "Hoerner singled and stole second base with one out and Bethancourt at bat. The bespectacled catcher hit a dribbler in front of the plate and was tagged out by backstop Drew Millas. The catcher then noticed Hoerner was caught in no man’s land between second and third but his throw to second was wild and rolled into center, allowing the run to score and make it a 5-3 game."
