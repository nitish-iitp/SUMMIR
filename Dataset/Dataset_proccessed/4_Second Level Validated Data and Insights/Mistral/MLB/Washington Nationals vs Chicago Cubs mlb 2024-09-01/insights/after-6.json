        "Jordan Wicks returned from a long stay on the injured list to make his first start since June 14 and got into a bases-loaded, nobody-out jam in the 2nd inning. The lefty was able to get a double play and a fly out to limit the damage to only a single run.",
        "In the 2nd inning, Paredes made a diving stab on a Keibert Ruiz grounder with the bases loaded and fired from his knees to second base to begin a 5-4-3 double play. Even though a run scored, the Nationals rally was short-circuited and Chicago gave up nothing else the rest of the afternoon."

        "Chicago certainly did what they had to do on this nine-game road swing against bad teams, going 8-1. They are starting to at least make themselves noticeable in the playoff race even if the odds still aren’t great."
