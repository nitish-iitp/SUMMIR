        "Jack Leiter pitched an impressive five innings vs. the Angels at Globe Life Field Saturday.",
        "Leiter allowed three runs on two hits and two walks in five innings.",
        "He did not pitch long enough to qualify for a quality start after he walked Los Angeles shortstop Zach Neto to begin the sixth inning and got pulled by Rangers manager Bruce Bochy.",
        "Leiter racked up a career-high six strikeouts on 20 swings-and-misses from Angels batters.",
        "Leiter’s whiff count was the fourth-most by any Texas starter this season and he garnered 12 on his fastball — which reached 98.5 mph and averaged 96.3 mph — alone.",
        "Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said, “It’s the stuff.” He made pitches when he had to. He was a little bit erratic at times, but he regrouped and that’s what’s important. He didn’t let it get away from him.”",
        "Leiter opened with an “auspicious start.” Los Angeles leadoff hitter Taylor Ward drilled a middle-middle slider into left field for a solo home run to begin the game, then Leiter lost control of a fastball and hit Neto in the next at-bat.",
        "Leiter then retired 15 of the next 17 batters he faced before Neto worked that leadoff walk in the sixth inning.",
        "Neto — who scored on an Anthony Rendon flyout in the first inning — crossed home plate in the sixth on an Andrew Chafin wild pitch.",
        "Leiter said, “The first pitch matters just as much as the last one.” It started off kind of, you know, the exact opposite of how you want to start off with a homer and a hit by pitch... Yeah, I think there’s a lot of takeaways. Execute from pitch one.”",
        "The 24-year-old former first-round has made three consecutive starts in Texas’ rotation after his first three in the season’s first half came on a spot basis.",
        "The Rangers have won two of them.",
        "Leiter’s shown palpable signs of progress in each.",
        "Rangers shortstop Josh Smith said, “Honestly, this win is kind of on him.” Keeping us in the game, giving us a chance. I thought Jack was really good tonight. I thought he was good in his last start too. He’s progressing pretty well.”"
