        "Kyle Hendricks of the Chicago Cubs pitches against the Colorado Rockies in the first inning on Sept. 15, 2024, in Denver. (Dustin Bradford/Getty Images)",
        "Hendricks became the first Cubs pitcher in history to toss at least six innings while allowing two or fewer hits and one or fewer runs in a start at Coors Field, which opened in 1995.",
        "The Cubs (76-73) return home as their chances of making the postseason remain bleak.",
        "It would require a historic comeback concurrent with an epic collapse by the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets for the final National League wild-card spot.",
        "If the Cubs go 10-3 the rest of the way, the Braves and Mets, which both hold the tiebreaker over the North Siders, each cannot win more than three games over the last two weeks."
