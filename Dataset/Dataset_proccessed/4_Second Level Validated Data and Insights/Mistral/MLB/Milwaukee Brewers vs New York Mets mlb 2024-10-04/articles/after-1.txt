Hero

Pete Alonso.

What could have been his final at-bat as a Met instead became his best, Alonso drilling a go-ahead, three-run homer in the ninth against Devin Williams.

Zero

Devin Williams.

The untouchable Brewers closer was touched, entering a game in which the Mets only had recorded two hits and letting up three more, including Alonso’s bomb.

Unsung hero

Jose Quintana, probably the fourth-most trusted Mets starter, dealt six scoreless innings to keep his team in the game.

Key stat: 1

Home run by Alonso in his past 12 games spanning the postseason and regular season, but that one will be remembered forever.

Quote of the day

“Pete wants to do so much. He wanted to be a part of this. And we kept telling him: you will. You will have your moment. You’ll get your chance.
