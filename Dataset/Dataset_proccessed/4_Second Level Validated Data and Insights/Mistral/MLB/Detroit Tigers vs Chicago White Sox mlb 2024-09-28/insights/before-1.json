        "The Detroit Tigers clinched their first playoff berth since 2014.",
        "Josh Tebeau, a Tigers superfan, was invited to join the team's on-field celebration.",
        "Tarik Skubal, a Tigers player, greeted Tebeau during the celebration.",
        "Tebeau held a sign that originally said, 'Don’t let the Tigers get hot.' but updated it to 'Don't let the Tigers stay hot.'",
        "Tebeau shared a story about a pumpkin seed that Tigers player Tarik Skubal tossed him in April, which he considered a 'premonition' since pumpkin seeds are associated with October, the month that hosts playoff baseball."
