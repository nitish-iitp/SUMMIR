        "The Mets and Brewers were not expected to make the playoffs this year.",
        "The Mets went 75-87 in 2023 and were 22-33 near the end of May, but they came on strong the rest of the way under new manager Carlos Mendoza to earn the NL's final wild-card spot.",
        "Milwaukee was an even bigger surprise in winning its second straight NL Central title despite losing manager Craig Counsell to the rival Chicago Cubs, two-time All-Star pitcher Brandon Woodruff missing the season following shoulder surgery, 2021 Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes being traded in January to Baltimore, pitchers Wade Miley and Robert Gasser undergoing Tommy John surgeries, and Christian Yelich getting injured and not playing after July 23."

        "The Brewers never flinched and took over the NL Central lead near the end of April and stayed there the rest of the way.",
        "The small-market Brewers are making their sixth postseason appearance in seven years, but they haven’t won a playoff series since reaching Game 7 of the 2018 NL Championship Series and have lost nine of their last 10 playoff games."

        "The Stearns series: David Stearns joined the Brewers as general manager in October 2015 and was promoted to president of baseball operations before the 2019 season. He stepped down after the 2022 season and took the same position with the Mets a year later.",
        "Who's on the mound?: Freddy Peralta (11-9, 3.68 ERA) will start Game 1, but the Brewers haven't announced their pitching plans beyond that.",
        "Frelick's status: Milwaukee outfielder Sal Frelick bruised his left hip while chasing a foul ball Friday, creating doubt for his availability this week.",
        "Frelick told reporters that he will be ’ready to go.’",
        "Frelick crashed into the right-field sidewall, and his left side made contact with the metal chain link inside a window in that wall with no protective padding. Along with the traditional bunting adorning the concourses and logos painted onto American Family Field for the postseason, the Brewers installed new padding to the section of wall that Frelick hit.",
        "Brewers on the basepaths: Much of Milwaukee's success against the Mets has come from its running game. The Brewers stole 17 bases in six games against New York without getting caught a single time, though they did have a runner picked off once.",
        "Matchup problems: Milwaukee’s Brice Turang went 9 of 19 and stole seven bases without getting caught in the Brewers’ six regular-season games with the Mets. Jackson Chourio was 9 for 25 at the plate against the Mets. Longtime Mets nemesis Rhys Hoskins batted just.222 but had two homers and eight RBIs in 18 at-bats.",
        "New York’s Francisco Alvarez went 7 for 15 with a homer, four RBIs and a 1.260 OPS against the Brewers this season. Starling Marte had a.389 on-base percentage and.600 slugging percentage. Jose Iglesias was 5 for 11."
