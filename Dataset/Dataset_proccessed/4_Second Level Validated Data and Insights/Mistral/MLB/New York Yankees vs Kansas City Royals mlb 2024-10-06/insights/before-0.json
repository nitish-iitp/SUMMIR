        "Nestor Cortes Jr. is hoping to return to the New York Yankees during the playoffs after being on the injured list with a left elbow flexor strain.",
        "Cortes will throw for the first time since going on the injured list on Sept. 25.",
        "He will make between 20 and 30 throws during the off day following the Yankees’ win over the Kansas City Royals in Game 1 of the American League Division Series on Saturday and before Monday’s Game 2.",
        "Cortes’ biggest hurdle is throwing baseballs and he’s not sure how he’ll feel.",
        "He didn’t rule himself out for a potential return in the AL Championship Series, though it seems unlikely.",
        "Cortes will be a free agent after next season.",
        "He was making $3.9 million this year via salary arbitration.",
        "The Yankees almost certainly wouldn’t be able to use Cortes as a starting pitcher in the playoffs, especially since they already have four starters on their playoff roster.",
        "His biggest test since his injury will come on Sunday."
