        "Aaron Judge is in the middle of another standout season, having hit more than 50 home runs for the third time in his career.",
        "Judge has faced and overcome slumps before. In April, questions surfaced when he homered just four times in his first 27 games, hitting.178 with a.674 OPS.",
        "During that hot streak, Judge hit.377 and maintained a remarkable 1.349 OPS, all but securing another AL MVP award.",
        "Optimism despite dip in form",
        "With 16 games remaining in the regular season, Judge's pursuit of his AL-record 62 home runs from two years ago appears to have stalled.",
        "More pressing for the Yankees is helping their captain break out of his current rut as they fight to secure their postseason position.",
        "Even with his recent struggles, Judge remains a leading candidate for the AL MVP award.",
        "Witt's strong play has tightened the MVP race, but Judge, who leads the majors in RBIs, OPS, and on-base percentage, seems unfazed.",
        "For Judge, the current drought is just part of the game.",
        "For the Yankees, however, breaking the captain's slump will be crucial in their push for the postseason."
