        "Caden Dana, the Angels’ top prospect, made his Major League debut against the Mariners in Sunday’s 3-2 win.",
        "Dana became the youngest Angels pitcher since Francisco Rodríguez in 2002 and the club’s youngest starting pitcher since Frank Tanana in 1973.",
        "He fired a quality start on Sunday, allowing two runs on two hits, four strikeouts and four walks.",
        "Dana set the tone in the first inning, retiring the side on 12 pitches, and recorded his first career strikeout against Cal Raleigh.",
        "Through the first six innings of his Major League career, Dana indicated he’s more than ready to take on the challenge."
