        "Joe Pohlad, the ownership family's official Twins czar as its Executive Chair, met with reporters before Sunday's game and didn't do a great job of convincing the team's emotional stake-holders that the Pohlad Family has their best interests in mind."

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Pohlad spoke as if he's the one pulling the levers. Of his time spent watching the last month and a half of the season, he said, 'it feels like I'm watching a trainwreck.'"
