        "The game is a resumption of a suspended game from June 26, with rosters that look substantially different.",
        "The Blue Jays and Red Sox will have to familiarize themselves with the rules governing in-game moves.",
        "The Blue Jays will need to pinch-hit for Danny Jansen, who was dealt from Toronto to Boston ahead of the trade deadline.",
        "The Red Sox have also turned over some of their roster, including Reese McGuire, who was catching at the time rain led to the stoppage in play.",
        "The new Blue Jays hitter will inherit Jansen’s 0-1 count, and will get credit or blame for whatever happens next.",
        "The Red Sox will make a pitching change, replacing Yariel Rodríguez with Ryan Burr.",
        "Later on, more oddities could ensure if Joey Loperfido, Will Wagner and Leo Jimenez enter the game.",
        "Since the suspended Monday afternoon game isn’t technically part of a doubleheader, the teams won’t get a 27th man until the second game of the day.",
        "The Blue Jays could add veteran right-hander Paolo Espino as pitching depth in what may be a bullpen game."
