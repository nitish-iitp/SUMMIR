IND vs BAN Live: Virat Kohli gives due respect to Bangladeshi bowlers

Virat Kohli has apparently refused to call it an “upset" if Bangladesh manage to beat India in the upcoming World Cup clash. According to him, the perception of “big teams" should be quashed.

"There are no big teams in the World Cup. Whenever you start focusing only on bigger teams, an upset happens," King Kohli told Star Sports.

"You have to play your best against all these bowlers, and if you aren't able to, these bowlers are able to create pressure and increase the chances of getting you out," he added while giving due respect to Bangladeshi bowlers.
