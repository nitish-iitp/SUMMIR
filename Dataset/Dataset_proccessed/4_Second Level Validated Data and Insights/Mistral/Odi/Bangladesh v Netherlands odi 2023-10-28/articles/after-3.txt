NED 107/5 in 27 overs

Netherlands is now five down after Taskin Ahmed induces an edge off Bas de Leede’s bat and caught by Mushfiqur. At first umpire wasn’t interested, and neither was the keeper but Shakib decided to take the review. There was a fine edge. Good review there.

PREVIEW

Pride will be the underlying theme when Bangladesh seeks to arrest its free fall and Netherlands eyes its best-ever performance in the ODI World Cup at the Eden Gardens here on Saturday.

With cricket fever taking over from Durga Puja celebrations, it will be an extended spell of enjoyment for ardent lovers of the game as their most-loved venue joins the extravaganza. For some, the joy will double to see The Tigers from across the border in action.

After suffering four successive losses, including the last one against South Africa, Bangladesh will feel comfortable being at ‘home away from home’ and may expect some support.
