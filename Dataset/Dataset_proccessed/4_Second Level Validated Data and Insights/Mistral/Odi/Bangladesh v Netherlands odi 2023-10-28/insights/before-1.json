    "Pre-Game Insights": [
        "Bangladesh come to Kolkata following a 149-run defeat against South Africa in Mumbai. Mahmudullah's hundred apart, there wasn't much to cheer about in that game. The bowling especially was all over the place during the final ten overs, when South Africa smashed 144 runs.",
        "Netherlands' inspiring performances issue a warning. Although they might be smarting from their 309-run defeat against Australia, Netherlands are not roadkill. They have punched well above their weight in the tournament by stunning South Africa, and running Sri Lanka close.",
        "Scott Edwards, leading from the front in this World Cup, captains a side which also fought their way into this World Cup with a superb showing in the Qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June-July. They had shown then too that the Full-Member tag was no deterrent for them. Bangladesh, beware."
    ],
    "Team news": [
        "Taskin Ahmed, who was sidelined by a shoulder niggle, bowled at full tilt two days before the match, so expect him to be back. Towhid Hridoy could also return to the side after Bangladesh's experiment of playing six bowlers didn't work out against South Africa."
    ],
    "Netherlands (probable)": [
        "1 Vikramjit Singh, 2 Max O'Dowd, 3 Colin Ackermann, 4 Sybrand Engelbrecht, 5 Bas de Leede, 6 Scott Edwards (capt & wk), 7 Teja Nidamanuru, 8 Logan van Beek, 9 Roelof van der Merwe, 10 Aryan Dutt, 11 Paul van Meekeren"

    "Pitch and conditions": [
        "Eden Gardens has hosted just a single ODI in the last six years. And though the pitches there historically tend to be batting-friendly, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 215 by India in that ODI this January. However, there have been high totals there at the IPL."
    ],
    "Stats and trivia": [
        "Bangladesh and Netherlands have met in an ODI only twice so far. The last of those meetings had come during the 2011 World Cup. From that game, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah and Wesley Barresi are still part of the respective teams' squads in 2023.",
        "All of Mahmudullah's ODI centuries have come in ICC tournaments: three in the World Cup, and one in the Champions Trophy.",
        "Bas de Leede's figures of 2 for 115 in ten overs against Australia is now the most expensive ten-over spell in ODIs, relieving Mick Lewis of this unwanted record after 17 years."
