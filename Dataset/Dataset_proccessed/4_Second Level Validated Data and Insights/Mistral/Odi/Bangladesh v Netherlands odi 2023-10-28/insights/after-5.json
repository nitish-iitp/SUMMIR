        "For Bangladesh, this is as disappointing as it gets. A top score of 35 from Miraz, and four of the top six had single-digit scores. Another collapse... this has become a habit at the World Cup"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "From losing by 309 runs (the biggest defeat in WC history) against Australia few nights ago, the Netherlands team have flown to Kolkata and come up trumps against a side that was supposed to feel at home here at the Eden Gardens"

    "Others": [
        "The Dutch bowlers had to rely on wickets to keep this target away, and the fast bowlers used the extra bounce that is synonymous with this venue and the spinners extracted more turn than usual. This is now their second win in six games - the first time they've won multiple World Cup games"
