'Going to be a special final...'

More from Australia skipper Pat Cummins: "Travis Head was crazy. He has a knack of finding a wicket when you need one. That was huge. I think it has been a feature of the whole tournament. There's been players who chip in with those middle-over wickets and Travis was the man today.

"Josh Inglis played beautifully. We had heaps of time and he looked in total control our there, particularly against two really good spinners on a tough wicket."

Australia's eighth final. What's the secret? "I don't know really. The good thing is a few guys have been there in a final before so we can draw on that. A couple of other guys have played in T20 World Cups as well. You have to embrace it. It's going to be packed, pretty one-sided I reckon, so you just have to embrace it.

"It's going to be a special final. I still talk of the 2015 as one of my career highlights and I wasn't even playing. So to be out there in a final, in India, world's biggest stadium...it's a very happy changing room at the moment."

'A nerve-wracking couple of hours'

Australia captain Pat Cummins: "I think it is easier out there than sitting in the dugout. A nerve-wracking couple of hours. Great effort, plenty of good performances. We're pretty pumped. We thought it was going to spin quite a bit but probably was not expecting to Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc to bowl so much so early.

"We thought chasing 200 could be tricky. We knew it would spin later on but it was gloomy and swinging around, the boys were bowling beautifully, so I wasn't upset at [the toss] at that stage.

"We talked a lot about our fielding. We weren't up to scratch at the start of the tournament, but there was effort shown by all. David Warner at 37 diving around was incredible. The big two up front were ridiculous today."

Australia haven't really put together a complete game. It's been on the fast bowlers later in the game to pull things back.

They got on top of South Africa early today with the ball for the first time. You'd rather go into a final with a ruthless up front performance which shows they could potentially get at India.

'Coetzee was a warrior'

More from Temba Bavuma: "We felt our total was competitive. We would have liked to start better, they had more than 70 in the first 10 overs. Our spinners really put them under pressure, but we needed a lot to go our way.

"We had tough chances that we put down. When the margins are like that you need things to go your way. That doesn't take away from the Australia display.

"Coetzee was a warrior. For him to be able to bowl with the intensity and aggression he did got us back into the game. He didn't want to let go of the ball. He will be a big asset for South African cricket.

"Quinton de Kock has had an outstanding tournament. We've enjoyed playing with him. He has dazzled us all. In South Africa he will go down as a legend of the game."

South Africa gave it everything in reply.

They had moments of brilliance from Rassie van der Dussen and Gerald Coetzee.

They had close calls from Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj, the spinners bowling beautifully together in tandem.

But it was agonisingly in vain. Australia had the luxury to just nudge the ball around in the final 10 overs without any scoreboard pressure, and it earned them a spot in the final.

'Australia were ruthless'

South Africa captain Temba Bavuma: "It's quite hard to put into words. Congratulations to Australia. They were outstanding for a large part of the day.

"Our character came through. We showed the resilience we talk about and a bit of dog fight. The way we started with the bat and ball was the turning point, we always had to play catch-up.

"The conditions combined with the quality of the Australia attack. They were ruthless and exploited every bit of advantage, and really put us under pressure. From 24-4, it was always going to be hard to get a competitive total."

We saw Daryl Mitchell's classy century in a losing cause yesterday, and David Miller's today.

He came to the middle at 24-4 and left with a 115-ball ton.

Without him, this game would have ended hours ago.

Player of the match Travis Head: "It's hard to unpack all of that. I didn't move for the past couple of hours. It was a tense finish and an amazing game.

"We knew how it was going to play and how we would adapt. You train, go to bed and think about it. I think the pitches have been unbelievable. We knew it would be a grind and a battle and that's what it was.

"After the broken hand I thought I wasn't going to be here. I just want to contribute for Australia and will have another chance in a couple of days."

On the Klaasen wicket: "I was under the pump and somehow that got through him. I'm always keen to have a bowl."

Australia opener Travis Head is named player of the match for his 62 from 48 balls that helped them get off to a flyer.

Their start of 60-o in six overs ensured that even when South Africa's spinners fought back, they were comfortably ahead of the game and the pressure wasn't quite as intense.

He also took two wickets in two balls to completely stall South Africa's counter-attack in the middle overs.

We'll hear from him shortly.

I can see Australia pushing India. They've got great togetherness and belief they can do anything in any circumstances. Australia have grown as the tournament has gone on.

Handshakes and hugs all round but South Africa look dejected.

Quinton de Kock bows out from international cricket after a fabulous personal tournament but there's no fairytale ending.

South Africa fought bravely with the ball, but they'll be thinking about those first 10 overs with the bat for quite some time.

To go from 24-4, they've done remarkably well to take it to the penultimate over.

I was tense up here. A fantastic game of cricket. It ebbed and flowed. You have to give South Africa credit for dragging themselves back into it, especially David Miller.

Australia have made their supporters sweat a bit and credit to South Africa's players who made them work for it. They were undone at the beginning of the game by some fine Australia bowling in helpful conditions.

AUSTRALIA WIN BY THREE WICKETS

BREAKING

Crashed through the covers for four and Australia make their way to another World Cup final!

After a tense and twitchy partnership, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins get Australia over the line.

It's semi-final heartbreak once again for South Africa.

Well, Starc takes a risk.

He swings wildly at Aiden Markram's last ball and again, the ball just misses off stump!

How on earth has this managed to go to the 48th over? It's taken about 20 overs to score the last 20 runs here.

A half-volley on leg stump and nicely put away by Mitchell Starc. A bizarre bowling change to use Marco Jansen, in my opinion.
