    "Team Analysis": [
        "Netherlands: The Scott Edwards-led Netherlands have certainly emerged as one of the biggest surprise teams in the tournament. The Dutch so far have played great cricket and finally won their first match with a big win over South Africa. The batting may be the Netherlands’ biggest concern with the top-order failing to score runs. While the bowling has looked good with the likes of, Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe and Aryan Dutt performing well.",
        "Sri Lanka: In contrast, the Sri Lankan team has had a forgettable tournament with three back-to-back losses. The Lankans have shown flashes of brilliance but their mistakes have weighed them down."

    "Match Prediction": [
        "Sri Lanka has a better chance to win this fixture and defeat the Netherlands to register their first win in the ICC ODI World Cup 2023."
