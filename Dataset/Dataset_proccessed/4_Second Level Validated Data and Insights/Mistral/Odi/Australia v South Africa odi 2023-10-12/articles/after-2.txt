LIVE AUS vs SA Score Updates:South Africa beat Australia by 134 runs in ICC World Cup. South Africa strikes early and Australia are in deep trouble as the Aussies lose four wickets in the chase of 312 runs. Australia have won the toss and decided to bat first in their second world game of ICC World Cup 2023. Pat Cummins has decided to make two changes in his lineup, Marcus Stoinis replaces Cameron Green while Josh Inglis takes Alex Carey's place. 

Despite a slow start, the Proteas managed to cross 300-runs mark, all thanks to the a powerful knock by Quinton de Kock, who scored his 19th ODI century and third against Australia. This is also his consecutive ODI century in the World Cup. 

After a good stable start, the Proteas did lose some wickets, but the Aiden Markram ensured his team crosses 300-runs mark as he paced up the run rate. He also scored a half century (56). 

After 50 overs, the Proteas gave a target of 312 runs for Kangaroos to chase. 

For Australia, Mitchell Starc and Glenn Maxwell took two wickets each, while, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa took one each. 

The five-time champions will be looking to make a strong comeback against the Proteas after their shock six-wicket defeat to India on 8 October. Coach Pat Cummins will be particularly concerned about the performance of his batsmen, who failed to break the 200-run mark as they were caught in a web of spin bowling spun by India's skilled bowlers.

Cummins will also be concerned about his team's ability to convert good starts, as the Kangaroos lost their first game by 6 wickets after dismissing the first three Indian batters for less than 3 runs.

South Africa, on the other hand, are coming off a confident 102-run win over Sri Lanka in their first game. In a high-scoring encounter, the Proteas set the Lankans a target of 429 runs on the back of three centuries from Rassie van der Dussen (108), Quinton de Kock (100) and Aiden Markram (106). Van der Dussen also became the fastest century at the Arun Jaitley International Stadium.

Key highlights so far: 

Australia innings:

1) Pat Cummins won the toss and decided to field first at the Ekana International Stadium on Thursday. 

2) Australia made two changes in their lineup, bringing in Marcus Stoinis for Cameron Green and Josh Inglis for Alex Carey. 

3) Shaun Pollock is the only bowler to have claimed a five-for in a World Cup match between South Africa and Australia

4) David Warner's 122 is the highest individual score in Australia and South Africa World Cup games

5) Australia have never played at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow. South Africa played here last year and beat India by 9 runs.

6) Proteas' Quinton de Kock hits his 31st half-century in just 51 balls.

7) 100 runs up for Proteas in 106 balls (Q de Kock 61, T Bavuma 33)

8) Maxwell break the opening partnership, sends Proteas' skipper Bavuma (35) to pavilion in the 20th over, as the latter goes for a big shot and get caught David Warner.

9) After losing skipper Bavuma, South Africa touched the 150-runs mark in 162 balls. 

10) Proteas lose 2nd Wicket: Adam Zampa gives a breakthorugh for Australia, as he picks up the wickets of Rassie van der Dussen in the 29th over.

11) Q de Kock: Century for de Kock in 91 balls. This is his 19th ODI century and third against Australia (100 off 90 balls – 8 x 4, 5 x 6)

12) Glen Maxwell dismisses Quinton de Kock in the 35th over as the batter limbs into the reverse-pull, the ball pops from a good length, deflects off the back of his bat and down into the stumps to end a mighty innings. He scored 109 in 106 balls. 

13) South Africa are 250-up in 43 overs all thanks to the powerful half century by Markram.

14) After scoring a half century, Aiden Markram loses his wicket to Pat Cummins in the 44th over. He scored 56 runs in just 44 balls.

15) After losing Markram in the previous over, Proteas lose another wicket as Heinrich Klaasen to Hazlewood. He scored 29 in 27 balls.

16) Finally the wait is over and 300-runs up for Proteas the 49th over. 

17) Wickets!!! Starc takes two wickets in final over of the game. He dismisses Jansen as it was a straight forward catch to David Warner. Apart from this, David Miller too went back to pavilion as he failed to defend a perfect YORKER.

17) After 50 overs, the Proteas could score 311/7 and gave a target of 312 runs for Kangaroos to chase.

18) For Australia, Mitchell Starc and Glenn Maxwell took two wickets each, while, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa took one each.

19) Australia slumped to 70-6 before giving up their pursuit of an unlikely victory, hoping to salvage their run-rate instead but were dismissed for 177 with 55 balls to spare.

20) Australia lost half their wickets for 65 runs and had no answer against Kagiso Rabada (3-33), Marco Jansen (2-54) and Keshav Maharaj (2-30) as they folded for 177 in 40.5 overs with Marnus Labuschagne (46) their only top-order batsman to fire.

Australia vs South Africa Live: Quinton de Kock speaks on his Player of the Match

Australia vs South Africa Live: “It was a great win for the boys, to be honest, we didn't know how the pitch would play, we assessed the conditions beautifully and then applied ourselves well with the bat. The guys who spent time on the wicket, got a hand on the conditions and then used their scoring options. 311 was an above par score, I have played here for the Lucknow team (in the IPL), it becomes harder to bat second. The wicket does change a bit. It was sweaty and humid, the bowlers were on top of their game, no real loose balls and they picked early wickets. I think we are keen to prove ourselves, we played well, but it's just 2 games, the World Cup is a long tournament and games come quickly around, we will take it on a match-by-match basis," says Quinton de Kock
