        "The pitch at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Kandy will allow for good stroke play and the batters will find it easy to bat on the surface. The surface will not allow a lot of assistance to the bowlers and wicket taking is not going to be easy. The average 1st innings score at this venue in the last 20 matches is 236 runs. The team batting first at this venue has won 40% of its matches, so the toss does not make much of a difference here.",
        "Temperature is expected to be around 27.15 °C with 70% humidity. 3.57 m/s winds are expected. There is light rain expected which may affect playing conditions.",
        "The venue is suited for both Pacers and Spinners alike."
