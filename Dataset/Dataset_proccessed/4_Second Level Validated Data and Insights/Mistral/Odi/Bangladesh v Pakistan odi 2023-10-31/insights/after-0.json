        "Babar Azam, Pakistan captain: All credit to the boys the way we played in all three departments. We know, if Fakhar Zaman bats for 20-30 overs, it’s a different ball game, he played his natural game. Good to see him. We are trying to win the next two matches, we’ll see where we stand. We started well, the way Shaheen started. After 15-20 overs, they built a partnership, our main bowlers picked wickets. We picked wickets in the middle overs. Thank you fans so much for the support."

        "Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh captain: We did not enough have runs, The wicket was really good, we lost early wickets again. There were some partnerships, but not big partnerships. Disappointing with the bat. Credit should go to Pakistan, the way they bowled and the way they batted in the first 10 overs. (On his batting position) We’ll have to think about that. We are not getting many runs from the top four batsmen. I was batting in the top four, I wasn’t scoring. My confidence was low too. Luckily I got some runs, felling better now. At this moment, changing too many things gets difficult. We have to keep moving forward. We need collective performance, which is not happening. Two more matches, hopefully we can bounce back. Everywhere we go, they (fans) keep supporting us. We have to give something back to them so they can smile."
