In Short
Sadeera Samarawickrama hit his maiden World Cup hundred
Samarawickrama reached his hundred off 82 balls vs Pakistan
Kusal Mendis also played a 122-run knock vs Pakistan

Sri Lanka batter Sadeera Samarawickrama notched up his maiden ODI hundred in his side's second group match of the ongoing ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 against Pakistan in Hyderabad on Tuesday. The middle-order batsman carved his name in history with a sublime knock that was a blend of caution and aggression.

Sadeera walked into bat after Sri Lanka lost their second wicket at 107 in the form of Nissanka and then aided Kusal Mendis, who began his counter-attack. The Sri Lankans had reached 200 before the 30-over mark. Sadeera shared a century stand with the other centurion, Kusal Mendis after SL lost openers Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka. After Mendis departed for 122, Sadeera shared a 50-plus stand with Dhananjaya de Silva.

Sadeera was patient, playing the good deliveries on their merit, and hammered the loose ones with the ruthlessness of a seasoned campaigner. His knock included 10 excruciatingly beautiful boundaries and two towering sixes. The Pakistani bowlers seemed bereft of ideas while bowling to Samarawickrama, who never let them settle into a rhythm.

PAK vs SL, World Cup 2023 Live Score and Updates

Samarawickrama’s hundred came in the 46th over when he took a single off Pakistan pacer Hasan Ali. With the Sri Lankan camp erupting in jubilation and the stands echoing with applause, the moment was nothing short of an epoch-making event for Samarawickrama. Earlier, Kusal Mendis scored Sri Lanka's fastest-ever hundred in men's World Cup history. Mendis blasted the Pakistani bowling unit to reach his milestone in just 65 deliveries and completed with a magnificent knock of 122 from 77 to beat the famous Kumar Sangakkara, who had previously held the esteemed mark for eight long years.

Mendis hammered Shaheen Afridi and the others for a stunning innings at No. 3. The right-hander smashed the Pakistani attack all over the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, hitting 14 fours and six sixes to nearly steal the game from the more-fancied opponent.
