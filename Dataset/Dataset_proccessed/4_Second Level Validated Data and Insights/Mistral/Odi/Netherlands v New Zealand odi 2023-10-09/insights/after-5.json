        "Scott Edwards: 'We will speak about that with the boys. There's definitely going to be some positives; we need to rectify our errors in the next seven games. For us, it's another game and we'll play our best game and try to win (on next game)'",
        "Tom Latham: 'I think we did a great job with the bat, built partnerships and put up a great score. Any time in the middle is valuable, partnership after partnership allowed us put good runs on the board. (fifth bowling option Ravindra) the guys have bowled beautifully, we made sure they don't bowl too many overs and I was proactive with the changes...spinners were outstanding and the big boys did a great job upfront and squeezed them...great to see him (Lockie Ferguson) back. It's about adapting as quickly as possible and acclimatize to the weather (in Chennai)'"
