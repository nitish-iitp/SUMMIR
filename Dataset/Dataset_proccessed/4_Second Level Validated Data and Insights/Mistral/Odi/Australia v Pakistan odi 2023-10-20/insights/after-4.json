        "The tournament will hit 20 games tomorrow.",
        "Shalabh: 'Historically ODIs have rarely been close contested. Maybe it is perpetual T20 hangover which forces to expect close contest every time.'",
        "Anjan: 'Australia- 19 and Pakistan - 6, the no. of sixes determined the outcome of the match.'",
        "Karthik: 'My theory about more one-sided or large defeats in this worldcup is due to removal of strike rotation when a wicket falls, this has allowed bowling teams to put pressure on new batsman straightaway.'",
        "Aqeel: 'Everytime a wicket falls, I keep checking if no-ball is being checked. What's the rule? How de we know if no-ball will be checked?' The third umpire checks it",
        "David Warner, POTM: 'The groin is okay. Just a bit sore, all cramps at the moment. Stand with Marsh with awesome. Once we got the pace of the wicket, we tried to set it up for the incoming batters. Committing and batting my skills was pleasing. Had a good hit yesterday. It helps when you hit it off the middle, and playing on this ground as well. Marsh and I tried to bat till 35 and we thought we could go big in the back half. We need to work on going big at the end though.'",
        "10:07pm Another game that's not close, although it threatened to be. Imam and Shafique gave Pakistan a great start, with that 134-run opening stand, but Stoinis came in to nip them out. Zampa ensured that the batters in the middle order getting set couldn't go big. In the end, that was the difference: Australia got two hundreds and Pakistan two fifties. Wickets-wise, Zampa getting Babar out on the pull by cramping him for room was striking, as was having Rizwan pinned in front after the batter went across for the sweep."
