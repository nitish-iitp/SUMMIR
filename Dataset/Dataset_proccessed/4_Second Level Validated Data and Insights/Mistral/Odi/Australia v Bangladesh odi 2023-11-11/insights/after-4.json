        "Mitch Marsh is player of the Match",
        "Pat Cummins speaks: It was a great win leading to the semis and good to chase a total like that. We were not at our sharpest in the first innings, It was a really good wicket. We brought it back towards the end to a total that we could chase."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto speaks: I think for me the two run outs were crucial, the way we started was good but after the two run outs, we lost momentum. If we score 340-350, it could have been different. We did not bowl well in the middle overs. The fast bowlers bowled well but we need to improve in the middle overs."
