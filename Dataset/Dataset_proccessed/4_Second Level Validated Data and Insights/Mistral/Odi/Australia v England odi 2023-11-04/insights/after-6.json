        "England left themselves too much to do. Part of that was their own doing, no doubt, but Australia's brilliance with the ball and in the field - all 10 wickets fell to catches - highlights the gulf in class between these two sides at this World Cup.",
        "After weeks of treading water, the defending champions are finally out of the reckoning, even after Pakistan's unlikely DLS success against New Zealand earlier today. Australia's fifth win moves them into third, two points above New Zealand, and another step towards confirming their spot in the semi-finals."
