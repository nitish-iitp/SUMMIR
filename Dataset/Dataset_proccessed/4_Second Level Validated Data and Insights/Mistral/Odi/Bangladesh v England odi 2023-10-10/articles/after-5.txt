NEW DELHI: England showcased their batting prowess by amassing a commanding total of 364/9 against Bangladesh on Tuesday in a thrilling World Cup league stage encounter. The standout performer for England was Dawid Malan, who delivered a sensational innings of 140, adorned with 16 boundaries and five massive sixes, all achieved in a mere 107 deliveries.
England's top-order batsmen exhibited exceptional form, with Jonny Bairstow contributing a crucial 55 and Joe Root playing a pivotal role with a well-constructed 82. The partnership between Malan and Root, which amassed a staggering 151 runs for the second wicket, laid the foundation for England's imposing total.
Scorecard: England vs Bangladesh
The opening pair of Malan and Bairstow had already established a strong platform by adding 115 runs to the scoreboard before their respective dismissals.

With the form they were in, England appeared poised to set a target close to the 400-run mark. Nevertheless, Bangladesh displayed commendable resilience in the final 10 overs of the innings, mounting a spirited comeback by picking up wickets at crucial junctures to rein in England's run-scoring spree.


Mahedi Hasan emerged as the standout bowler for Bangladesh, turning in a compelling performance with figures of 8-0-71-4. Furthermore, left-arm seamer
Shoriful Islam made significant contributions by claiming three crucial wickets.
As the match progressed, the momentum swung back and forth, creating an enthralling and closely contested battle between England and Bangladesh in the World Cup league stage.
Brief scores: England 364/9 in 50 overs (Jonny Bairstow 52, Dawid Malan 140, Joe Root 82; Shoriful Islam 3/75, Mahedi Hasan 4/71) vs Bangladesh.
