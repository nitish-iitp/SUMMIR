        "England may be the ICC Cricket World Cup defending champions, but they have a lot to think about as they head into their second match of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Dharamsala on Tuesday. In a virtual sequel of the epic 2019 World Cup final, New Zealand demolished England with a ruthless nine-wicket win. The Jos Buttler-led side will be smarting from the heavy defeat, and will look to set things right when they face Bangladesh in match 7 of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023."

        "The two teams have played each other 24 times in ODIs, and England have won 19 of those games, while the rest have seen Bangladesh emerging victors. In the last five encounters, England enjoy a 4-1 win record against the subcontinetal team. However, Bangaldesh's solitary win came in the most recent clash between the two sides, in March this year. Bangladesh had beaten England by a handsome 50 runs in that game in Chattogram."
