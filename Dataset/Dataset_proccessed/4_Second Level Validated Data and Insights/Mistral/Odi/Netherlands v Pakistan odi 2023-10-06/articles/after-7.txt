“I just try to follow the basics and try to score for the team. I think nerves were there because we lost three wickets. But I got lucky as I got early boundaries. I think in the last 2-3 months, I've been working hard on my game. I knew that this was the position in which I was going to bat for Pakistan and I developed my game,” said Shakeel.

He thanked the coaching staff and the crowd for supporting them at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad. Pakistan survived a scare for Netherlands to get their World Cup campaign off to a winning start for the first time in three editions.

“Thanks to the support staff as well for helping me out. Thanks to the crowd as well. I would like to thank my coach as well and I would like to dedicate this award to him,” Shakeel added.

Shakeel scored an under-pressure half-century to save Pakistan’s blushes in the second match of the 2023 World Cup. Shakeel walked in when Pakistan were reeling at 38 for 3, with Fakhar Zaman, skipper Babar Azam and Imam-ul-Haq back in the pavilion.

Shakeel was positive from the get-go and formed a crucial 120-run partnership with wicket-keeping batter Mohammad Rizwan. The two batters lifted Pakistan from a dangerous position to a comfortable one in the space of 20 overs.

Shakeel was preffered over Salman Ali Agha in Pakistan’s middle order for their opening match of the 2023 World Cup.

Following the win in Hyderabad, Pakistan will gear up to face Sri Lanka at the same venue on October 10.
