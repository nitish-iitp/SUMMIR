        "Harry Brook is set to captain England for the first time in the one-day international series against Australia after Jos Buttler was ruled out because of his persistent calf injury.",
        "Buttler has not played a competitive match since England lost the T20 World Cup semifinal against India in Guyana at the end of June.",
        "Brook, 25, has only 15 caps in ODI cricket but England views him as a future leader and had already primed the Yorkshireman to deputize for Buttler when the squad was announced.",
        "The first of five one-day internationals between England and Australia starts Thursday (September 19, 2024) at Trent Bridge.",
        "Brook's appointment also means England has had a new captain in each international format this summer."
