        "Both teams are in the top three at this stage, and the winners of this game will feel very secure about their future",
        "New Zealand endured back-to-back losses to India and Australia as their smooth sail of a campaign hit a rough patch amid a growing list of niggles. South Africa have been gung-ho, proving their only loss - to Netherlands - was an aberration, their batting depth looking increasingly menacing and bowling effective enough, as they were expected to be."

    "Team news": [
        "Kagiso Rabada missed the previous game because of a niggle, but is understood to be fit and is expected to return to the XI. That'll mean South Africa will be left with a tricky call on whom to leave out. Gerald Coetzee and Tabraiz Shamsi both had important roles to play in their win over Pakistan in Chennai, but one of them will probably have to make way, depending on the pitch.",
        "New Zealand have an injury list that's slowly growing. Lockie Ferguson bowled all of three overs before walking off with a heel injury against Australia. Mark Chapman is recovering from a minor calf strain. Tim Southee was on the mend for a broken finger, but might be ready to return. Williamson has resumed training, but he has been ruled out of the game against South Africa, while Ferguson will take a fitness test before the toss."

    "Pitch and conditions": [
        "Pune is unusually hot and dry for this time of the year, but the surfaces have been good for batting, with even bounce and excellent carry. In the two games so far, dew hasn't had too big an effect, but it should be humid. The toss might not be too big a factor if the dew stays away."

    "Stats and trivia": [
        "Conway has been dismissed twice in six games by left-arm spin at this World Cup. South Africa have Maharaj in the mix. In all, Conway has hit 17 runs off the 21 balls from bowlers of this variety. It's only a small sample size but worth looking out for nonetheless, especially given that he loves the sweep shot, and Pune has relatively bigger squares.",
        "Ravindra's tally of 406 runs is already the most by a New Zealander in his maiden World Cup. The standout aspect has been his game against spin - he has scored 210 against them at a strike rate of 109. His eight sixes are the most against spinners in the tournament so far.",
        "South Africa's seven 300-plus totals in a row batting first in ODIs - including four this World Cup - is the longest streak in the game. They have hit the most sixes and fours, and have the most hundreds (six) in the tournament.",
        "South Africa's pace pack has taken 44 wickets at an average and a strike rate of 23.3 and 23.5, respectively. Their wickets tally and their bowling strike rate are the best for a team in this World Cup."
