That's all for today, where South Africa have dominated New Zealand with both bat and ball to put themselves in touching distance of the last four of this World Cup.

The result has really opened up the door for Pakistan and potentially, even Afghanistan to battle for fourth spot alongside New Zealand, who suffered their second-heaviest defeat in World Cup history today in Pune.

You can read Sam Drury's report from today's convincing win for the Proteas here.

We'll be back nice and early tomorrow morning to do it all over again, with India hosting Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai at 08:30 GMT.

On Latham defending his decision to bowl: "We all looked at each other and said he's lying. He's got to be lying, when you reflect on a heavy defeat like that, you front up and say you got it wrong."

'You don't become a bad team overnight'

New Zealand captain Tom Latham: "Obviously not our best performance. We were put under pressure from that massive partnership from Rassie and Quinton up top. I even thought at the halfway mark it was a big score but a decent surface from a batting point of view. You need to build partnerships, and to be three or four down early, we weren't able to build them. It was disappointing how it played out."

Would he bat first if asked again: "I don't think so. You expect yourself to perform at your best, but credit to the way they played, those two played fantastically well, they absorbed a bit of pressure up top and that allowed them to put the pressure back on us when it counted. It was a decent surface, if we'd had those partnerships and got through those first ten overs we'd have had a chance, with those small boundaries and a good surface. I think 330 or 340 would have been chaseable.

"We're faced with a bit of adversity when it comes to injuries, we'll wait and see how they come out. We've got a pretty quick turnaround, we play on Saturday, it's important we reflect on this one quickly and go into the next game with a positive mind, you don't become a bad team overnight - reflect now and move onto Bengaluru."

'We were aiming for 300-320'

More from Rassie van der Dussen: "Quinny was brilliant in reminding me to keep my shape, really play the ball where it wants to be hit, don't go looking for it, be relentless when it's in your area but when it's not respect it, it was one of those wickets. It was tough to come in and hit through the line, Miller and the guys at the back did brilliantly - it wasn't an easy wicket and they made it look easy.

"We were speaking about 300-320 in the middle, but we've seen in the last 12-18 months what the guys coming in the middle can do, I'm grateful for them, the sky's the limit. We got to 360, we're pretty chuffed. We got over the line by a good margin, everyone contributed in the team, it was an out-and-out team performance today, that's what makes me really proud and the guys in the dressing room as well."

'De Kock played brilliantly'

16:00 GMT 1 November 2023

South Africa's opening batter and Player of the Match Rassie van der Dussen: "Quinny and I thought they bowled pretty well up front. Run rate was hovering at about four runs per over, we had to work hard, when Quinny got to 50 he said it was a hardworking 50. He played brilliantly, he guided me through my options, we batted together quite nicely. As it got later in the innings, it was going to get better, the ball was going to get softer, luckily for us it worked out perfectly.

"The wicket was one where if you hit at a good length there was something in it for the bowlers, we communicated that back to our bowlers when we came out to bowl. That Test match length was tough to manufacture something off, there was something there through the whole innings. They did well to keep a lid on us for large part of the innings, but we knew if Quinny and I could take it deep we knew that through hard work we could get momentum on our side."

Chasing what would have been a World Cup record of 358, if successful, New Zealand found themselves in the mire early on. Will Young showed some promise, making 33, but Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra were both caught without making double figures.

Once Van der Dussen reached three figures, he took the handbrake off and hit some big shots to help propel South Africa well over 300.

Helping his cause was David Miller, who hit a 29-ball half-century before being caught by some excellent fielding from Daryl Mitchell.

It was a slow start for South Africa, who did not rush to a quick score and lost the early wicket of captain Temba Bavuma. Glenn Phillips also came agonisingly close to taking a stunning catch to remove Quinton de Kock on 12.

That was New Zealand's second-heaviest defeat in World Cup matches and it could not come at a worse time time for them.

South Africa have just been so much better than New Zealand, who've made some bad decisions but have just come up against this absolute train. When South Africa bat first they make hay.

BREAKING

A perfect match for South Africa, who win by 190 runs.

South Africa are on the brink of a spot in the last four. Meanwhile, New Zealand's fate now hangs in the balance after three straight defeats.

Excellent batting from Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen set the tone, matched by some excellent bowling from Keshav Maharaj and Marco Jansen.

Phillips c Rabada b Coetzee 60 (SA 167) Target 358

Game over.

South Africa made a little bit of a meal of that at the end, but finally, they get the job done as Phillips is caught on 60 by Rabada.

He had a bit of fun towards the end, but it does very little to paper over the cracks of this substantial defeat for New Zealand.
