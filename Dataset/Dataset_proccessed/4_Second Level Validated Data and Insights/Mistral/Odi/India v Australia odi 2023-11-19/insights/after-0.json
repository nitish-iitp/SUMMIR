        "Excitement builds in Ahmedabad as unbeaten hosts get set to face Australia in the ICC Cricket World Cup final.",
        "Cricket fans perform rituals for the victory of the Indian team in Ahmedabad",
        "Rohit Sharma, the Indian captain, was well cognisant of the expectations.",
        "All through his press interaction, he stressed that he would like to keep it ‘nice and easy’, ‘nice and relaxed and calm’, ‘nice and balanced’.",
        "If Cummins expects ‘a very one-sided’ crowd, part of the reason is BCCI’s delays in releasing the itinerary – it was finalised a mere two months before the first game – and the subsequent ticket sagas.",
        "Two busloads of Australians were spotted making a guided tour of the city, visiting spots such as the Gandhi Ashram. There won’t be too many like them.",
        "By night, the crowd of India fans outside the stadium had only grown. They were watching the drone show rehearsal, one act in a closing ceremony that will resemble a somewhat nationalistic variety show as much as a sporting finale.",
        "A light-and-laser spectacle is slated for a drinks interval at night.",
        "In attendance will be Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles.",
        "The last time Modi attended a cricket match was also in Ahmedabad, and that too against Australia, in March.",
        "The toss then was delayed as he rode around the outfield with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in a motorised chariot to gushing television commentary, and was afterwards presented a portrait of himself in a stadium he got named after himself.",
        "He would probably settle for presenting the trophy to the Indian captain this time around. That is something even he cannot control.",
        "But Indian triumph, though not ordained, is widely being seen as a natural consequence of the team’s exquisite showing over the past two months.",
        "In times past Indian fans felt trepidation before a big final.",
        "‘For once, that sense of nervousness is not there’, said one fan. ‘This is a special team and we know that.’"
