        "Sharma, the India captain, said, ‘Honestly, since we started the tournament it was always about taking one game at a time and playing that game well. That’s what everyone did. We’re very pleased with how we played in these nine games. We’ve been clinical from game one. That’s because different individuals have stepped up at different points.’",
