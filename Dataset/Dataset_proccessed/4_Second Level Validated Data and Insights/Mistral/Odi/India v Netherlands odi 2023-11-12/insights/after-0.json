        "Here’s India’s bowler extraordinaire captain, Rohit Sharma: Since we started the tournament it was all about one game at a time. We never wanted to look too far ahead. It is a long tournament, eleven games in all if we go all the way. It was important to break it down and focus on each game. I’m very pleased at how we’ve played in these nine games, we’ve been very clinical from game one to today. “We are playing in India, there will be expectation. We wanted to do the job at hand. It’s one thing to talk about it but for everyone to buy into it is very important. We enjoy each other’s company. We wanted to play with enjoyment on the field.”",
        "Here’s the Netherlands captain, Scott Edwards: It’s a little bit of a tricky one at the moment when it comes to where we want to be. We are pretty confident with the style we play, the tournament was always going to be tough… India are as good a side going around. We will have to be a lot better going into theT20 World Cup next year. They showed pure class with the bat… when you are three down with ten overs left, you are going to score some runs.”"
