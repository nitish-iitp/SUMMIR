        "Kusal Mendis, who must want to run away screaming, fronts up to Mike Atherton. “I’m very disappointed with the performance and myself; l also thought the guys bowled really well at points,” he says. As for that questionable toss decision, Mendis adds: “I can’t say whether I’d have done it differently, I thought [the pitch] would play a little slow and be hard to play early on. Madusuhanka bowled really well in the first hour and middle overs but sometimes the game is difficult and you miss some chances – maybe [the game] is changed by these. They were hard chances. Their guys then bowled really well in the first six overs, give them credit today for their fast-bowling unit.” He insists he remains confident for what remains of an almost-certainly doomed campaign. “We have another two games – bangladesh and New Zealand – and we’ll come in strong for them.”",
        "A very happy Rohit Sharma follows him. “I’m very happy,” he chirps. “To know we’ve officially qualified now shows a good effort from the entire squad – this was the goal for us first of all in all how we approached these seven games. We’ve been quite clinical, everyone put in the effort, we wanted individuals to stand up and they have.Reflecting on the impressive showings today of players who hadn’t done much previously, he says: “Shreyas {Iyer] is a very strong lad strong in his mind and went out today and did what he’s known for – taking on the bowlers and the challenge in front of him. Siraj can swing the ball, he’s got a lot of skills when operating with the new ball. It shows the quality of the seamers to put in a performance against England and here like that. I hope they continue to do it that way.”"
