        "Jos Buttler: 'Nice to put in a good performance and finish this way. Lots to reflect on and ultimately disappointing but good to win today. We haven't shown enough what we're capable of. Lots of us haven't performed to our level. To not have him available for a few games was a challenge but we're a good enough team to have been able to deal with it.'",
        "Babar Azam: 'We conceded a few too many runs. We bowled a few loose deliveries towards the end. And out spinners' aren't taking wickets, which doesn't help. That has a big effect because you need to take wickets in the middle overs. The pitch is very true and the margin of error is very low for fast bowlers, which explains the big scores we have conceded. We will sit together and take stock. We'll take positives from this and discuss mistakes. I'm keen to lead the rebuild.'"
