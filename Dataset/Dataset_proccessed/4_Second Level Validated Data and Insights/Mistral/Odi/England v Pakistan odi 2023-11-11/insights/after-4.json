        "Steven Finn, former England bowler on BBC Test Match Special: 'England will be deeply disappointed. In the last two games they've played the way they wanted to for the rest of the tournament. Aggressive with the bat, imposing, and then looking to take wickets with the ball. They've executed that in the last couple of games and there will be an element of frustration when they're looking back at the entirely of this campaign that it took them so long to do that.'"
