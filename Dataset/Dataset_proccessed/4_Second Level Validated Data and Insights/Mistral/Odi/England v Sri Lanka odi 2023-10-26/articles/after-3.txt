England suffered a horrendous collapse against Sri Lanka at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru today (October 26), leading to lots of extreme reactions from the English cricket community.

To bet on the World Cup with our Match Centre Partners bet365 head here.

After suffering a 229-run defeat against South Africa at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, England desperately needed to put their best foot forward against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru if they were to stay afloat in the tournament.

Learning from their mistake in Mumbai, England chose to bat after winning the toss. However, what followed was another shambolic batting performance. From 45-0, England collapsed to 85-5, and then from 122-5 to 156 all out, the lowest ODI all-out team total in Bengaluru.

Ben Stokes was the only batter to cross 40 as he tried to hold one end up. With the fall of his wicket in the 31st over, England’s hopes of putting up a competitive total vanished as they were bowled out two overs later.

Having already lost three of their first four matches at the 2023 World Cup, this performance by England has brought out lots of extreme reactions from the English cricket community.

STAT 3: England’s 85-5 today is the lowest score at which they’ve lost their 5th wicket when batting first in a World Cup match since they were 35-5 v Australia in the 1975 semi-final. https://t.co/aE4CdJ0R65
