    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Matthew Mott, England’s Australian coach, finds himself losing to an English coach for the second time in this tournament. First it was Jonathan Trott with Afghanistan, now it’s Chris Silverwood with Sri Lanka. Mott, to his credit, comes out and faces the cameras. “We’ve unfortunately saved our worst form for this World Cup,” he says. “Everyone feels like they’ve let a lot of people down.”",
        "Asked if England have more than a mathematical chance, he demurs. “Realistically, we’re in a bit of trouble.”",
        "Simon McMahon. “And maybe the most depressing thing about it all,” he reckons, “is that it was the fairest of margins.”"

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "This has been the shortest match in the 2023 World Cup.",
        "Sri Lanka go up to fifth in the table, ahead of Pakistan. Both those sides have four points from five games, as do Afghanistan. England have two points from five – won one, lost four – and they are ninth. Their net run rate is awful too (-1.63), but luckily for them the Netherlands’ is even worse (-1.90). So Glenn Maxwell’s big hitting has at least kept England off rock bottom."
