        "Ben Stokes is set to return to the playing XI for England's World Cup 2023 fixture against South Africa on October 21.",
        "Stokes' return presents a dilemma for the English side as he won't be contributing with the ball during the tournament.",
        "England must make a tough decision to accommodate Stokes in the playing XI, either sacrificing depth in their bowling attack or persisting with a top-heavy batting lineup.",
        "England could sacrifice either Liam Livingstone, Chris Woakes, or Sam Curran to fit Stokes into the team.",
        "The decision to replace Curran with Stokes would allow Jos Buttler to return to the number six position, which he occupied during the 2019 World Cup."
