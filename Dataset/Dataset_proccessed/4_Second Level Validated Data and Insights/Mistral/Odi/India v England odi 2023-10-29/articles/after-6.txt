Time for me to clock off, with England’s World Cup defence a little more tattered, a little more torn. They fly to Ahmedabad to play a rejuvinated Australia on November 4. India entertain Sri Lanka on Thursday.

Here is Simon’s report from Lucknow, if you need a bit more despair with your cheese and biscuits.

The stadium is emptying behind the commentators. Apparently, India aren’t mathematically into the semi-finals. Nor are England mathematically out of the tournament. But the acrobatics that would have to happen to allow those situations to play out are practically impossible.

Eoin Morgan throws some dry fir cones onto the fire.

Eoin Morgan via Sky Sports on England: “I’ve never come across a sports team that has underperformed like this, given the level of expectation. There’s something within the team that is definitely unsettled. I think there’s something else going on – there has to be.”

— Chris Stocks (@StocksC_cricket) October 29, 2023

Farhan has done a bit of digging around, “England may still be in contention for a semifinal spot - as far mathematics is concerned. But they need to win every single game and they need to win big in each of those games and hope that Australia lose every other game and lose them badly. Each of these scenarios in unrealistic, especially the one where England win the rest of all their games in this tournament - let alone winning all of them big.”

Harsh but fair.

Dean in Cardiff has no mercy. “At least England’s problems are easily identifiable & clear - selection, motivation, form, batting, bowling, fielding & no travelling reserves...”

Eoin Morgan is nearly as harsh. “It hurts and it should hurt. Again, they’ve not competed for 100 overs of a game.”

Nasser is interesting. “It reminds me of what Duncan Fletcher said to me when he took over. You' aren’t the best side in the world, but you’re not the worst either.”

Sky flash up the World Cup table. Down in the basement sit England with one win from six games. India lounge across the top.

Chris Woakes has won the opposite of a golden ticket. “It is disappointing,” he tells Ian Ward. “At the half way stage we were in a pretty good place. The wicket wasn’t easy, and losing wickets in clumps, it is not easy to come back from that. I think if we could buy some confidence we’d spend a lot of money on it, when you haven’t got confidence you are likely to play some rash shots. I think Ben was probably trying to counteract Shami bowling well by playing some shots – obviously that didn’t go well. You need to make the decision in the moment. It’s top level sport, you have no right to win.”

“To put it into context,” writes Mark Beadle, “that was England’s second best performance of the tournament so far…” Just the seven bowled/lbws.

Jasprit Bumrah is chirpy: The game was a good challenge for India, they practise in the evening so the dew wasn’t a surprise. The guys get on, they’re enjoying the tournament, Shami is a gem, and they haven’t lost a game.

17.10 CET

I’m afraid it is poor Jos Buttler again with the microphone. But he’s a good guy, and he does miserable honestly well

“I’m very disappointed, I think at the half way stage, chasing 230 we fancied ourselves, but it was the same old story.

“Personally I felt like I wanted to soak pressure up, but it is about committing and executing the skill. There wasn’t scoreboard pressure, we’re just falling short, whichever way we’re doing it at the moment.”

How are do many good players losing form at the same time?

“Answers on a postcard I think. Some top players in there, long way off our best.

“Great start in the power play, the ground fielding as good as it has been, felt like today the day it is all turning round.

Atherton asks about Champions Trophy qualification:

“I’m aware of that, we’ve still go lots of play for.”

India have now won every game. England lost five of six.

29 Oct 2023
17.01 CET

After a cracking bowling and fielding performance, the wheels rapidly fell off England’s batting line-up, shortly followed by the doors, the windows, and that little tin of boiled sweets hidden in the glove compartment. Only Liam Livingstone made more than 16 – though he and Buttler and Moeen did attempt to knuckle down and rebuild after the clatter of early wickets.

The player of the match is Rohit Sharma, for his 87 on a tricky pitch, but it was a magnificent bowling performance from India too -especially from Bumrah (3-32) and Shami (4-22).

Blue handshakes. Kudos to Buttler who manages to squeeze out a polite smile. England’s last four innings totals have been: 215, 170, 156, 129.

WICKET! Wood b Bumrah 0 England 129 all out -India win by 100 runs

34.5 overs (Willey 16) Time for Willey to thrash a second six off Bumrah, before Wood is skittled by a perfect yorker.

WICKET! Rashid b Shami 13 (England 122-9)

34th over: England 122-9 (Willey 9, Wood 0) Shami fires one into the pitch which Rashid bats away from his nose awkwardly. Two wides bring some respite, Rohit, a man of limited patience, performs a double teapot. Not for long, as Rashid, the ball after driving Shami stylishly through the covers, loses both his stumps to once that creeps a bit low.

Share
29 Oct 2023
16.42 CET

33rd over: England 112-8 (Willey 9, Rashid 5) Willey, enthused by the spirit of lost causes, smacks the majestic Bumrah for six, an insulting number of rows back into the stands.

Share
29 Oct 2023
16.37 CET

32nd over: England 104-8 (Willey 2, Rashid 4) Yadav bounces through another over. Rashid and Willey busy themselves at different ends.

But for something completely different, over to Romeo:

“The Asia Qualifier for the T20 World Cup starts tomorrow in Kathmandu at 03.15 GMT, with Bahrain v UAE and Nepal v Singapore. At 07.45 GMT there’s Malaysia v Oman and Hong Kong v Kuwait. The top two, after a round robin and semi-finals, go to the World Cup and the whole thing takes just one week.”

16.32 CET

30th over: England 101-8 (Willey 1, Rashid 2) England have now lost 8-68 in a burnt Christmas dinner of a period of play. It was a nice innings by Livingstone though, uncharacteristically patient and careful. But the pressure told, and he went for the sweep to the wrong ball.

WICKET! Livingstone lbw Kuldeep Yadav 27 (England 98-8)

Livingstone is certain he’s not out. Holds his inelegant position, legs a-kimbo. But the umpire is adamant too, and so is ball tracker.

29th over: England 98-7 (Livingstone 27, Willey 0) A wicket maiden for Jadeja who squeezes the ball out on his shirt. A nice little start by Woakes, but he couldn’t wait for the pressure to ease. Virat, meets Rohit, meets Yadav – with fielders given multiple direction.

WICKET! Woakes st Rahul b Jadeja 10 (England 98-7)

Shucks. A victory for the pressure of the rising run-rate. From nowhere, Woakes charges Jadeja with intent, and is neatly sent on his way with a swish of the gloves.

28th over: England 98-6 (Livingstone 27, Woakes 10) Another Siraj misfield displeased Rohit Sharma. Four singles tapped off Yadav.


Hello Peter Rowntree: “Good to have a reason to speak to you outside of the normal CC. All this talk about Dave Willey not having a central contract. Personally, I don’t think it’s made a ha’porth of difference to his performances. I have followed Dave Willey throughout his career and he is a real one hundred percenter on the cricket field and make no mistake.

“It’s just such a shame that the limitations of his body have never enabled him to fulfil the immense potential he showed when he first came into the professional game. Don’t know what to make of England’s performances in this world cup, but when a side with so many talented players consistently plays badly it tends to point to motivation and leadership issues. And again this issue with motivation would not apply to Dave Willey - he is so totally self-motivated as a cricketer just wants to do well and take wickets every time he steps out on a cricket pitch.”

27th over: England 94-6 (Livingstone 25, Woakes 8) Three tickled from Jadeja.

Share
29 Oct 2023
16.12 CET

26th over: England 91-6 (Livingstone 23, Woakes 7) “Is it over-optimistic of me to hope that Woakes will play one of “those innings” where he rescues England and enables Liam Livingstone to free his arms and clobber the “over-rated” Indian attack to give England a much-needed victory?” ponders Colum Fordham. “ Let’s face it, India have been lucky thus far and England have just been pretending to be their pre-2015 selves.” Well he does hit the shot of the innings, classy loft over cover.

Share
29 Oct 2023
16.08 CET

25th over: England 84-6 (Livingstone 22, Woakes 1) If, if, England can survive Shami and Bumrah, the dew might yet help England. Jadeja continually drying the ball. Three from his over.

“Hi Tanya and greetings from Hanoi,” hello Phil Keegan!

“This is perhaps a bit cruel but I can’t help thinking that if this England batting line up were an animal it would be put down to avoid further suffering.”

Share
29 Oct 2023
16.02 CET

23rd over: England 81-6 (Livingstone 20, Woakes 0) Moeen’s 15 consisted of 15 careful singles, but he couldn’t add to the foundations. Woakes survives five balls of heavy-duty Shami – who pauses mid-over as something is removed from his eye – driving and missing dangerously to the last.

“Why don’t England just pretend it’s Day four of a Test match?” asks Gareth Creer.

22nd over: England 79-5 (Moeen 14, Livingstone 19) Livingstone crouching, sweeps Kuldeep round for four, past the sliding Siraj on the rope, who ends up sprawled on the ground like a tipped up wheelbarrow.

29 Oct 2023
15.47 CET

21st over: England 72-5 (Moeen 13, Livingstone 13) The dew has fallen, the television pictures show fat globules making themselves at home on the grass. Virat Kohli is in charge of drying.

29 Oct 2023
15.46 CET

20th over: England 68-5 (Moeen 11, Livingstone 11) Kuldeep rips one from outside Livingstone’s stretching space, back in towards his stumps. Somehow, he is still there.

15.41 CET

19th over: England 67-5 (Moeen 10, Livingstone 11) Time for Jadeja, thick black hairband holding back a head of full curly hair. England play him sensibly away.

15.39 CET

18th over: England 64-5 (Moeen 9, Livingstone 9) this and that for three.

Hello Teejash Shah! “Born in India, I now live in the States. With work travels, OBO is my only way to follow this World Cup. So first of all, thank you! Yous do an amazing job.” Very kind! Will tell the team.

”What the English selectors should have done
given contracts only to the non-playing 15 folks. That would have put a fire under the playing 15, just like it has under Willey!”

29 Oct 2023
15.37 CET

17th over: England 61-5 (Moeen 8, Livingstone 7) Livingstone could change this game in ten overs. If he can keep his head. He milks six from Siraj’s over, including a lesser-spotted boundary, whipped behind. Moeen continues to watch and wait.

Hello Tamsyn Lawrence. “Not sure why everyone’s so down on this performance. By my calculations at the current rate, we’ll have caught the asked for total by the 70th over for a mere 23 wickets.”

16th over: England 54-5 (Moeen 7, Livingstone 1) What a beauty of a bath bomb, full of fresh flowers and glitter, , screaming in from outside off stump to skittle the bails. Buttler a little rigid in the crease, has nowhere to go.

15.24 CET

15th over: England 52-4 (Buttler 10, Moeen 6) Siraj again – is Rohit trying to use him up while there is no pressure? Not as dangerous as Bumrah or Shami today – but he could let England off the hook. Buttler and Moeen, veterans of the IPL, continue the Clarks lace-ups and clean fingernails rebuild. Five from the over.

“I love Ben Stokes, really I do,” writes Roy Everitt, “but it looks like England have opted to go not just a bowler short, but a batsman as well.”

Share
29 Oct 2023
15.19 CET

14th over: England 47-4 (Buttler 6, Moeen 5) Time for wrist spin, with Kuldeep Yadav. Moeen’s got this – don’t worry.

Tom VDG has a theory: “In amongst this shambles, I would’ve been tempted to promote Willey with instructions to play an attacking pinch-hitting approach in the hope that India might be knocked off their lengths.... Let’s be honest, it couldn’t be any worse than what we’re witnessing.” Willey definitely has a point to prove, what with him being the only man in the squad not to be given a contract. In that situation, I don’t really understand why the ECB would announce the contracts while the World Cup was in play? Politically easier to do afterwards, and kinder. Unless I’m missing something.

13th over: England 45-4 (Buttler 5, Moeen 4) Siraj, shirt untucked, napkin in the back of his trousers. England continue in library mode, till Siraj’s last ball which Buttler thinks about pulling but misses.

15.07 CET

12th over: England 42-4 (Buttler 4, Moeen 3) Buttler and Moeen have reset the circuits. Gone are the big heaves, ignored are the wide balls. One from Shami’s over – Rohit claps appreciatively.

David Mooney has some good news, “England have avoided the follow on.”

29 Oct 2023
15.04 CET

11th over: England 41-4 (Buttler 4, Moeen 2) Buttler closes his pale blue eyes and tips his chin to the heavens. Siraj returns to bring some relief. One from the over. Ecstatic royal blue shirts as far as the eye can see.

“I’m sure everyone is racing to find the right statistics to put England’s performance at this World Cup in historical perspective, but it really has to be seen to be believed,” writes Beau Dure. “At no time since the first wicket fell has an English batter looked like he had the slightest idea of what he’s doing. It looks as though someone handed cricket bats to a bunch of golfers and polo players. “

It is so strange. They’re all good players. Some of them great players. Haplessness is catching.

29 Oct 2023
14.59 CET

10th over: England 40-4 (Buttler 4, Moeen 1) Moeen responds to the carnage with two immaculate forward defensives. Shami practically unplayable. The ground electric.

“Sorry everyone if I jinxed them with that Little & Large joke,” taps a sheepish Ewan Glenton, “but ‘Ok I’ll call back when one of them’s out for about 70 off 55 balls and England are halfway to their required target for the loss of just one wicket’ wouldn’t have sounded quite as effective, somehow… “

8th over: England 33-3 (Bairstow 13, Buttler 0) Suraj is replaced by the thundering Shami, who twice passes the outside edge of Stokes. Throw in stand, thrash and miss, and the ugly heave of a wicket is no surprise. A second consecutive maiden and delirium in Lucknow.

7th over: England 33-2 (Bairstow 13, Stokes 0) Bairstow checks and checks his guard, but survives Bumrah’s hat-trick ball. He somehow resists the noise ,which must be pumping around his body, urging attack, nd plays out a maiden.

Kim Thonger hello!

”I’m now wondering if England’s performance in the first few games has actually been part of a deliberate ploy by Baz et al to lull the ‘top tier’ nations into a false sense of overconfidence against the ‘minnows’, England being newly regarded by everyone as a tiny ODI fish. India certainly seem to have relaxed too much in their innings. It’s a brilliant piece of psychological wrong footing if so, worthy of that master of psychology Dr Mike Brearley.

”And to answer Brian Withington’s French New Wave cinema question, no sorry I can’t help, and is he sure he’s not getting mixed up and it was actually an episode of Mr Benn or Crystal Tipps & Alastair?”

4th over: England 26-0 (Malan 12, Bairstow 10) Siraj somewhat off his mojo here, as Bairstow leans into an extra cover drive and send the ball flying to the fence. We pause as he removes his boot, calls for a physio and clean socks. In the crowd a man in a native american headdress lifts his daughter high over his head as if offering her to the crowd. Please put the baby down. Now Siraj has hurt his hand too, stopping the ball in his follow through. He limps through the rest of the over.

3rd over: England 20-0 (Malan 12, Bairstow 4) To a cacophony of bugels, Bumrah resumes. He’s getting plenty of movement across the left hander and England are content to sit back and watch.

““I’m reminded of a Little & Large TV sketch from the 1980s,” writes Ewan Glenton, “when things were going disastrously badly for English cricket, not sure exactly when:
Picks up the phone…
‘Hello, can I speak to one of England’s opening batsmen, please?’
Pause…
‘What’s that, he’s just gone out to bat? Ok, I’ll hang on a moment…’

14.12 CET

2nd over: England 17-0 (Malan 10, Bairstow 4) Siraj starts with two wides in his first three balls. Eggs over easy six from Malan follows, lofted over midwicket. Followed immediately by a straight drive for four. Crowd suddenly quiet.

“ATAA. I said I was out after the last caper, but they drag you back in…” I know Mark Beadle, bastards. And there are so many DIY jobs you could be doing instead.
