    "Pitch Report": [
        "The Narendra Modi Stadium boasts a combination of six black soil pitches and five red soil pitches. While the red soil pitches are known to offer extra help to seam bowlers in comparison to the black ones, the black soil pitches still present favorable conditions for bowlers, including good bounce. Nevertheless, as the match unfolds, the pitch tends to lose its pace, becoming more spinner-friendly."
