        "If they maintain their winning streak, they will extend it to 13 games, surpassing the record set in the early 2000s. The last team to achieve a comparable streak was the “Golden Team” who won 15 of 18 games and drew three after losing the 1954 World Cup final. Their streak was halted in February 1956, when they were defeated, ominously, by the Turkish team scoring 3-1 in Istanbul."
