On Saturday, Georgia and Czech Republic face off in UEFA Nations League action. Watch the game live for free on Fubo.

Only a few months have passed since Georgia and the Czech Republic got acquainted for the first time at Euro 2024 before they were pitted against one another again in the UEFA Nations League. A fresh edition of the continental competition gets underway this week, and newly promoted Georgia is hoping to carry its momentum through in the hopes of a second straight Nations League promotion. The Czech Republic, on the other hand, has some weak points to resolve following its relegation from UEFA Nations League A and opens its bid hoping to claim a scalp in Tbilisi on Saturday.

The spoils were shared when these two teams collided in Hamburg at this summer’s European Championship, having both been assigned in Group F for their maiden matchup.

Georges Mikautadze opened the scoring for The Crusaders before Patrick Schick equalized in the second half, though that ended up securing the Czechs their only point of the competition.

That meant Georgia advanced as one of the best third-place group finishers at Euro 2024 while the Czech Republic bowed out at the first hurdle, with both teams in search of more this time around.

For host Georgia, the opportunity to land an early blow on the likely favorite to top the billing will be seen as too great to pass up.

But on the other hand, the Czech Republic came into Euro 2024 having lost just one of their previous 14 fixtures, blowing their momentum in sensational fashion when the time came.

That will put Willy Sagnol’s side on high alert, though the attacking duo of Mikautadze and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in particular will be looking to dish out damage for the home side.

Regional restrictions may apply.
