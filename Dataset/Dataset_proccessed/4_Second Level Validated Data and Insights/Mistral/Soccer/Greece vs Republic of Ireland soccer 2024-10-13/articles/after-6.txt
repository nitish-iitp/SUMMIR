FT: Greece 2 Republic of Ireland 0

So as Looney Tunes put it: That’s all folks!

Thanks for the company, just a pity about the result.

Ireland’s men have a bit of a break now, their next two fixtures coming in a month’s time (Finland at the Aviva on November 14th before a trip to Wembley to play on November 17th).

But not to worry. The Girls in Green are in action against Georgia in two weeks’ time attempting to earn a spot Euro 2025.

Until then, goodnight.

Gavin Cummiskey’s report from Athens is in.

“It is now beyond reasonable doubt that Greece are better at football than the Republic of Ireland,” he writes from the Karaiskakis Stadium.

“For 360 minutes, since June 2023, they have had their number across four competitive matches by an aggregate score of 8-1.”

Read his full report below.

Republic of Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrímsson has also been speaking to RTÉ.

Asked of Ireland’s improvement in the second half, he said: “It kinds of feels like once we concede the goal, the pressure is kind of gone so we start to have more belief in what we are doing. It was the same against Finland.”

Hallgrímsson said his players “defended heroically” in the opening half, but added: “We know we can do better. We saw that in the second half, we can do better.”

The win restores Greece’s three-point lead at the top of the League B Group 2 table.

They’re now on 12 points and England are second on nine points after their 3-1 win over Finland earlier this evening.

Ireland remain in third on three points, above the Finns on zero.

Ireland midfielder Josh Cullen has been speaking to RTÉ after the result.

“After them scoring so early in the second half, I thought from that point on we were the team that definitely looked more likely. I think we got more control in the game. I don’t think the first half was good enough from us but we tweaked a couple of things at half-time.

“It’s just disappointing to concede so soon after half-time, but I think the boys showed good courage and bravery to sort of come back and lift the performance again, but it wasn’t quite enough in the end.”

On conceding so soon after the break, Cullen added: “It’s a trend that we need to try and get rid of soon because we come out, every intention to start the second half on the front foot and maybe by doing that we sort of lose our shape a little bit and open some gaps for the opposition.

“It’s something we need to look at but it happens and I think the reaction was good. We just have to take the positives and move on.”

A disappointing result for Ireland.

A lacklustre first half from the visitors, with Caoimhín Kelleher’s heroics offering the only upside.

After the break, Ireland played with more composure to threaten the Greek goal but ultimately their finishing let them down.

The late goal was a sickener, especially given Kelleher’s superb effort over the 90 minutes.

It’s been all about the defence for Ireland in the opening 45 minutes.

Five minute warning!

So, what’s our record against Greece?

Our last four encounters went Greece’s way, the most recent being their 2-0 victory at the Aviva last month in the first leg of this fixture.

Ireland managed a nil-all draw in Athens back in 2002, and that’s the height of it.

Elsewhere in Group 2, Finland played host to England in the earlier kick-off. England taking a 3-1 win.

Jack Grealish and Declan Rice again both netted for Lee Carsley’s side, joined on the score sheet on this occasion by Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Arttu Hoskonen softened the blow with a goal for Finland in the 87th minute.

In table terms, England are now level with Greece on nine points. Ireland is third on three points, leaving Finland last with no point to their credit.

Anyone confused about what this game matters in the grander scheme of things? No worries, welcome to Nations League 101…

The Nations League is linked to qualification for the European Championship finals, so a spot at Euro 2028 is theoretically up for grabs.

However, to earn that spot at our own party – we’re joint hosts of Euro 2028 remember – via this route we need to win League B, which would first involve us having to get out of our group (that’s Group 2, with England, Finland and Greece).

From our three games thus far, Ireland have taken two losses and a win.

But it’s not all about the Euros. Where we place also determines which tier of the league we’ll play in next time around. In League B, a top-place group finish sees the team promoted to League A, and second goes on to play the third-ranked teams from League A for a chance at promotion too.

The third-placed team in League B goes to the playoffs against the second finishers from League C, in which an aggregate loss would see them relegated to the lower tier, while the fourth-place League B finisher gets relegated straight down to League C.

Good evening and welcome to The Irish Times’ live blog for Greece v the Republic of Ireland. Muireann Duffy here to take you through the action.

Gavin Cummiskey is our man on the ground in Athens, and he hasn’t let the feel-good factor of Ireland’s win over Finland cloud his judgment.

“Warning: recent history demands a cautious, calculated approach from the Republic of Ireland,” he writes, adding Thursday’s victory “could prove a false dawn as Greece in Athens brings bad memories for a mildly rejuvenated Irish team”.

Both sides are coming into the game on the back of away wins earlier this week.

Ireland’s victory came in Helsinki against Finland on Thursday, with a goal from Robbie Brady making it 2-1 for the visitor’s minutes from the final whistle, giving Heimir Hallgrímsson his first win as Republic of Ireland manager. Meanwhile at Wembley Stadium in London, the Greeks pulled off a huge upset to beat England, also ending 2-1.

Greece now sit top of the League B Group 2 table on nine points, while Ireland are back in third, behind England, on three points.
