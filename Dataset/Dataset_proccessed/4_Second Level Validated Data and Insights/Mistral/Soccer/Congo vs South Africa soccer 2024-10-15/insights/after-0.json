        "Bafana Bafana showed no mercy to the Congolese in a one-sided first leg affair at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Gqeberha on Friday, running out convincing 5-0 victors. With a win today, Bafana would move to 10 points from four games and open a seven-point gap to Congo Brazzaville, ultimately booking their ticket for next year's AFCON."
