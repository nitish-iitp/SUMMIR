Hungary vs Bosnia & Herzegovina Prediction 10 September 2024 18:30 09.09.24

Hungary take on the visitors Bosnia & Herzegovina in the round 2 match of UEFA Nations League group stage. The match will be played on Tuesday, September 10th at Puskás Aréna (Budapest).

Hungary have gradually improved in class and are now rightfully considered a strong team. They failed to qualify for the World Cup, losing crucial matches leading up to the 2022 tournament. However, Szoboszlai and company managed to secure a spot in Nations League Division A and not only remained there but almost won their elite-level group in the last cycle. They also confidently qualified for the Euros, winning their group with 18 points from 8 matches—4 points ahead of Serbia. But once at the tournament, the team started with two clear defeats: 1-3 against Switzerland and 0-2 against Germany. They managed to "go out with a bang," snatching a last-minute goal by Csobot to defeat Scotland. In the new cycle, they began against a familiar foe, Germany, and completely collapsed, conceding five unanswered goals.

Bosnia once again disappointed in the last cycle. The "Golden Lilies" have only qualified for one major tournament in their history. There were high hopes for the last cycle, especially after Džeko and his teammates won their Nations League Division B group. However, in the 2023 qualifiers, the team was a massive disappointment, earning just 9 points from 10 matches and finishing second-to-last. It's possible that Savo Milošević was initially banking on the March playoffs, but in the first match, his side, despite taking the lead, meekly lost at home to Ukraine, conceding twice in the dying moments. In the summer, Barbarez took over as head coach, but the losing streak continued. However, it was against strong opponents like England and Italy. Bosnia started the Nations League against the Netherlands away, where they suffered a defeat more fitting for a hockey game—2-5.

In 1999 and 2001, the teams played friendlies, both ending in draws. However, in the Euro 2008 qualifiers, the "Magyars" won both encounters. Both teams are looking for redemption after humiliations in the first round. But Hungary holds all the advantages—better players, experience, and home-field advantage. We expect a Hungarian victory.

Prediction for the match: Hungary to win.
