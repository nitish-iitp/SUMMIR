Honduras made an emphatic statement in their tournament debut, cruising to a dominant 4-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago. Many expected a tougher battle, but the Hondurans left no doubt, controlling the match from start to finish. Their strong start has set the tone, and now they’ll be looking to build momentum as they aim for another victory in their next matchup.

Up next for Honduras is a clash with Jamaica, who are seen as their primary competition for group supremacy. Jamaica stumbled in their opening match, settling for a disappointing draw against Cuba. Desperate for their first win of the tournament, they’ll be eager to bounce back and prove they can contend for the top spot.
