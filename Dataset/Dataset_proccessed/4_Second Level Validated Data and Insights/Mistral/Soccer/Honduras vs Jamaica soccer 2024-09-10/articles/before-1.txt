Over 17,000 spectators turned out at Jamaica’s National Stadium on Friday as the Reggae Boyz opened their 2024/2025 CONCACAF Nations League campaign against Cuba.

While not packed to capacity, the crowd marked the largest attendance for a home game since 2019, according to CONCACAF officials.

The turnout was the highest since the Reggae Boyz’s 2019 clash with Honduras.

Fans dressed in black, green, and gold brought energy and enthusiasm to the stadium, creating a lively atmosphere.

  

Jamaica earned a point in the match, which ended in a 0-0 draw.

The Reggae Boyz will  face Honduras today (September 10, 2024), before returning to the National Stadium for a home game against Honduras on Monday, October 14, 2024.
