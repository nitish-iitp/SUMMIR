Senegal, the 2021 AFCON champions, find themselves in an unexpectedly challenging position after a surprising 1-1 draw at home to Burkina Faso.

The Teranga Lions will be desperate to bounce back when they face Burundi, who currently top Group L after an impressive 3-2 away win against Malawi.Burundi, currently leading Group L, will be no pushovers, having shown resilience in their opening win.

Ghana, still reeling from a shock 1-0 defeat to Angola, face a must-win situation against Niger.

The Black Stars’ coach, Otto Addo, will be under pressure to deliver a result and revive Ghana’s qualification campaign.
