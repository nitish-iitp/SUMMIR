        "Germany hasn’t played a competitive match since the shocking group stage exit at the 2022 World Cup.",
        "Germany has six wins, three draws and six defeats in friendlies.",
        "Germany did beat France and the Netherlands in back-to-back matches in March.",
        "Germany is in need of a good result at a tournament, not only because of the host status but because Germany has not had good results in recent tournaments.",
        "Germany went out in the group stage in the last two World Cups and lost in the Round of 16 at the last Euros.",
        "That means Germany doesn’t have a win in a knockout match since 2016.",
        "That’s a big drop off from the run from 2002-2016, which saw the Germans make at least the semifinals in seven of eight major tournaments.",
        "Germany is even money to make the semifinals in this tournament.",
        "Plenty of eyes will be on Toni Kroos. The German midfielder is retiring after the tournament.",
        "He won everything possible in Germany and Spain during his club career and was on Germany’s 2014 World Cup-winning squad, but has never won the Euros.",
        "This trophy would round out his trophy set."
