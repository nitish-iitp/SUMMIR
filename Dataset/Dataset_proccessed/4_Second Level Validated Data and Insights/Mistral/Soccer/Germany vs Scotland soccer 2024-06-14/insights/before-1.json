        "Scotland's Billy Gilmour has modelled parts of his game on Toni Kroos's style",
        "Germany is being invaded by a Tartan Army tens of thousands strong",
        "Gilmour took to international football immediately. In only his third cap, aged 20, he was excellent in a Scottish midfield which held its own against Declan Rice, Mason Mount and Kalvin Phillips in a goalless draw with England at Wembley in Euro 2020."

    "Miscellaneous Highlights": [
        "The occasion is enormous. The spectacle will be vivid. The noise and the colour will be an assault on the senses. There will even be a tournament opening ceremony to enjoy or endure before Euro 2024 kicks off with Germany versus Scotland in Munich’s Allianz Arena on Friday evening."
    ],
    "Others": [
        "Gilmour is a talented central midfielder and one of Scotland’s key players at this tournament. If he appears in all the group fixtures he will reach 30 caps just days after turning 23 (he was given a cake and team-mates sang happy birthday to him as the squad hotel on Tuesday).",
        "Gilmour broke through at Euro 2020, earning plaudits for his performance against England at Wembley",
        "Gilmour may be only 5ft 7in and baby-faced, but Gilmour is unusually comfortable on the ball and willing and able to take possession under pressure.",
        "Gilmour took to indoor ice arena which has hosted figure skating, Scotland’s latest Euro 2024 media conference turned into a discussion on one of Germany’s coolest customers. One whose football could be set to music.",
        "Gilmour is a cool head Scotland will need when they swap a Garmish ice rink for the searing heat of Munich."
