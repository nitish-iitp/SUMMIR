Need to improve

Jamaal Shabazz spoke ahead of this match: “I felt like we were always in the game. When we made the two substitutions in the middle, we had the chance with the go-ahead goal. At this level of the game, when you don’t take your chances to go ahead and you give them away, you’re going to be punished; and I think we learned that lesson today.”

“When you have two (or) three days to prepare, you have to rely on the skill of the players and the work they do at the clubs to become clinical finishers. That’s not something the national team can work on with an international player in two days; it’s something we just have to keep improving on. They had their chances, our goalkeeper was brilliant at times, but we could have finished a lot better today.”

“I think we looked at the chemistry in the two sessions we had, and the fact that we had Isaiah Jones as a natural winger, Omari Glasgow (as) a natural winger, and we felt the opportunity to play with two wingers. Normally, he plays as a player who comes off the wing and into the midfield; we didn't need him at the start of that game.”

“I thought we created our chances playing like that, and then we changed things up playing in the second half.”
