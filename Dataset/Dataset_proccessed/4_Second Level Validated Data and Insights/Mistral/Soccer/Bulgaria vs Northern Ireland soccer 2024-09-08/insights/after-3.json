        "Bulgaria, who were unbeaten in seven matches heading into the game",
        "Backed by their vocal support, Bulgaria should have taken the lead in the fourth minute after a chaotic goalmouth scramble",
        "Despite half-chances for Isaac Price, Daniel Ballard and Conor Bradley, it was a sign of things to come",
        "Moments after firing wide from range, the impressive Despodov fired in a free-kick that rattled the post and bounced out of play",
        "PAOK midfielder Despodov was dictating play and his stunning through ball almost set up Kolev, but the forward's lobbed finish lacked the power to trouble Peacock-Farrell",
        "Northern Ireland were almost gifted the opener when Aleks Petkov misjudged Ballard's long ball, which allowed Isaac Price through on goal but he rushed his effort, which flew well wide",
        "Just like in the first half, Ballard had a header on goal deep into injury-time but it sailed wide as Northern Ireland's hopes of rescuing a point ended"
