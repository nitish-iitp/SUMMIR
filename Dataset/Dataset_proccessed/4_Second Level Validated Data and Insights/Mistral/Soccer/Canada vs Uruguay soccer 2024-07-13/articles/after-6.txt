CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA – Portland Timbers goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau and defender Kamal Miller were available for selection in Canada's third-place match against Uruguay at Copa América 2024.

A rollercoaster battle, Canada seemed poised to take the victory with an 80th minute goal, however a stoppage-time equalizer for Uruguay sent the two nations to a penalty shootout to decide the victor. Uruguay defeated Canada 4-3 from the spot to claim the prize.

Both Crépeau and Miller were available as subs, but did not make an appearance in the third-place matchup.
