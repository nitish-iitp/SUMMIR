The Indonesian vs Vietnam national team party is a crucial meeting for both teams because it could be a way to qualify for the round of 16.

Victory is the main requirement for both teams to keep their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages. You see, the Indonesian and Vietnamese national teams have not yet bagged a single point from the inaugural match.

The Garuda squad lost 1-3 to Iraq, while Vietnam was also defeated by Japan with a score of 2-4. The results of the inaugural matchday made Indonesia ranked fourth and Vietnam in third place in the Group D standings.

However, the performance of the Indonesian national team against the Mesopotamian Lion received appreciation. The Garuda squad showed an increase in performance.

"In terms of scores, the results are better than the previous meeting (in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers), where Indonesia lost with a score of 1-5," said Akmal Marhali in his statement contacted Thursday, January 18, 2024.

"In terms of game, the Indonesian national team has also been better than the previous meeting and in the previous three trial matches," he said.

From another point of view, Akmal Marhali said that despite the improvement shown, there are things that need to be improved to face Vietnam in order to achieve the three-point target.

"There are still many things that need to be addressed in the Indonesian national team's game."
