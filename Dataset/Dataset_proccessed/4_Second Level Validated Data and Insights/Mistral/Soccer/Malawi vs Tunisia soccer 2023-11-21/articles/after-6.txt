Malawi vs Tunisia: Part of the action
0Share

Malawi, popularly known as the Flames, faced a setback as they were defeated 1-0 by the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in a World Cup Qualifiers Game held at Bingu National Stadium in the capital, Lilongwe on Tuesday.

Despite holding Tunisia and appearing headed for a draw, which would have been a favorable outcome for the home team, a, 87th minute  late soft penalty was awarded to the visiting side. Tunisia capitalized on the opportunity, converting the penalty to secure a 1-0 victory. And despite 7 minutes of added time, the home team couldn’t still find an equalizer. This defeat marks the end of Coach Mabedi’s unbeaten streak since taking over the leadership of the Flames.
