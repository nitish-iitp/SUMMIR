LILONGWE, Malawi— Tunisia earned a dramatic 1-0 victory over Malawi's Flames in a tense World Cup qualifier Tuesday courtesy of an 87th-minute penalty kick, writes Romeo Umali.

The referee awarded Tunisia the decisive spot kick after Malawi defender Lawrence Chaziya received a yellow card for fouling an attacker in the box.

Youssef Msakni calmly converted the opportunity while goalkeeper Ernest Kakhobwe guessed incorrectly.

"We knew it was a challenging match, respecting the offensive Malawi Team. However, our tactical prowess and concentration prevailed," said Tunisia coach Jalal Qaderi, citing experience as a key factor.

His counterpart Patrick Mabedi said he was satisfied with Malawi's performance, calling it valuable experience for future endeavors.

Mabedi downplayed the absence of injured stars like Frank Mhango, dismissing notions it impacted the result.

"Football is a game of 11 players. The absence of one player is not an excuse," the coach remarked. "It's essential to groom replacements for the future."

Some observers questioned whether Malawi lacks attacking efficiency to truly compete in World Cup qualifying.

"The way we played today indicated a lack of a killer punch upfront. The current attackers have much to learn," commented journalist Edwin Mbewe.

In the qualifying standings, Tunisia leads the group with 6 points while Malawi sits third with 3 after four matches on the long road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.

The Flames next face Sao Tome and Principe on June 3, 2024, still seeking the nation's first-ever berth in the global showpiece event.
