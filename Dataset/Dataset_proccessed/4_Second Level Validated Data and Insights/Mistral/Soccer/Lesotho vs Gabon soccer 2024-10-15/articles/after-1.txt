We said: Lesotho 1-1 Gabon
Without Aubameyang leading the line, Gabon could struggle to finish many of their chances in front of goal, and it would not be surprising if the visitors failed to score more than once. If Lesotho are as defensively resilient as they were in their previous encounter with Gabon, it is plausible that they can earn their second point of their qualifying campaign. Read more.
