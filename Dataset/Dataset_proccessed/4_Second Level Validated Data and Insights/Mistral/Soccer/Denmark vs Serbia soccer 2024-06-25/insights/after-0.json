        "Denmark qualified for the knockout stages of Euro 2024 with a draw against Serbia, finishing second in Group C. Serbia, on the other hand, were eliminated from the tournament. The match was characterized by low-quality play and few opportunities at either end. Denmark's defense was crucial in their progress, with Kasper Schmeichel making few saves and Jannik Vestergaard and Joachim Andersen winning numerous aerial duels."
