        "Denmark advanced to the knockout phase of Euro 2024 thanks to a 0-0 draw with Serbia in Munich.",
        "Denmark will now face tournament hosts Germany in the round of 16 in Dortmund on Saturday night.",
        "England, meanwhile, will play one of the third-placed teams from Group D, E or F the following afternoon.",
        "Slovenia will advance to the knockout phase as one of the four best third-placed teams.",
        "Kasper Hjulmand’s side have played three and drawn three in Germany, and they continue to fail to get the most out of some of the talent in that squad.",
        "Rasmus Hojlund, who was subbed off midway through the second half, looked horribly isolated, starved of passes into space or beyond the defensive line that would have allowed his acceleration to become a factor.",
        "Denmark should play to Hojlund’s strengths by giving him more support and playing to his strengths as a dynamic attacking player.",
        "England have shouldered a fair bit of heat during this tournament for their slow football and underwhelming start.",
        "Welcome to the worst group at Euro 2024, with only one win and seven goals scored in the six games.",
        "Serbia, with Aleksandar Mitrovic, Dusan Vlahovic and Luka Jovic in attack, should have performed better and scored more goals.",
        "Dragan Stojkovic has tweaked his Serbia team for each match of this group phase, and did so again versus Denmark, opting for more midfielders.",
        "Stojkovic has made four half-time changes in the three matches, but that is four times more than the number of goals his team have scored."
