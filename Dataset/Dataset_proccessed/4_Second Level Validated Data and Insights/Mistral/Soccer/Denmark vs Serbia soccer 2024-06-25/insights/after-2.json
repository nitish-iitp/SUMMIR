Kasper Schmeichel said of the last-16 match in Dortmund on Saturday, \"If we don't believe in our chances, we might as well go home.\" Serbia defended stoutly for long periods, but could not provide opportunities for veteran striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, who appealed unsuccessfully for a penalty several times.
