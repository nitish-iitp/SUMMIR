        "Christian Eriksen won his 133rd cap, a record for a male Danish player.",
        "Serbia threatened to withdraw from the European Championship last week.",
        "Denmark and Eriksen have prolonged their stay in the tournament.",
        "Denmark's runner-up position in Group C was secured via a modern-day quirk.",
        "It was decided ultimately by their record in qualifying for the tournament.",
        "Serbia's game was of containment.",
        "A strange scene played out pre-match, where the giant flags of the competing nations were waved directly in front of the opposition’s support rather than their own.",
        "The first period was messy and lacking in cohesion.",
        "Serbia's play was especially ragged.",
        "A tame opening was punctured by an Eriksen snapshot from 19 yards which Predrag Rajkovic had to move smartly to turn behind.",
        "Denmark had the ball in the net from the second of two subsequent corners but Eriksen had bent the ball out of play before it reached Rasmus Højlund.",
        "Novak Djokovic, who had belted out the Serbian anthem, looked on.",
        "Aleksandar Mitrovic, the focal point for Serbia in attack, was peripheral to the point of anonymity.",
        "A slick move resulted in Joachim Andersen shanking the ball into his own net. The assistant referee flagged for an offside against Tadic in the build-up. A check confirmed the right call had been made on the field.",
        "Cue more flying beer cups and Tannoy messages for Serbian fans to desist.",
        "Euro 2024 will not miss this regular missile throwing.",
        "A defender should have sent Denmark into the lead, Jannik Vestergaard instead planting a free header right into the hands of Rajkovic.",
        "A pitch invader interrupted matters having managed to run 75 yards before being hauled to the ground.",
        "It had been that kind of wholly unsatisfactory evening.",
        "And, hopefully, one never to be spoken of again."
