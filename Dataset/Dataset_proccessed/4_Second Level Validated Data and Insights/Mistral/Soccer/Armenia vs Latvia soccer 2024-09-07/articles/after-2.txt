Game preview

The home team, ranked 97th in the FIFA ranking, is in a bad moment of form with only 1 win in their last 10 matches between official and friendly matches. What could definitely help them will be the home factor, as in their last 6 home matches they have managed to win or draw in 4 of them, including the 1-1 draw against Wales. 

On the away side, we find the 137th in the world also in a not too positive form but with the precedent of almost a year ago when they won at home the Armenian team by 2-0 in a duel that is remembered of a lot of action where the accuracy in front of goal was key. However, as visitors they will have a big problem, having lost 6 of their last 7 away games.

Republican Stadium Vazgen Sargsyan

The Republican Stadium Vazgen Sargsyan also called: Republican Stadium Hanrapetakan, is a multipurpose stadium in the city of Yerevan, capital of Armenia. The stadium was opened in 1938 and is usually used to host soccer matches, as the Armenian national team plays its home matches at the stadium. Since its opening, the stadium has undergone several renovations. The first renovations were made in 1995, but lack of financial resources delayed the process until 1999, when more than US$3 million was spent on infrastructure development. At the end of 2000, the stadium was completely renovated. In 2008, the stadium underwent a large-scale development in order to modernize the playing surface and create a high standard with VIP sections and other facilities that could comply with UEFA regulations.
