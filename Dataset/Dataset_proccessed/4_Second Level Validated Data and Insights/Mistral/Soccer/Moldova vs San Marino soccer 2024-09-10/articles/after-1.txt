Moldova have a 100% win record in the fixture

Moldova host San Marino at the Stadionul Zimbru in Chisinau on Tuesday for an international friendly. The Tricolours are coming off the back of a 2-0 win over Malta in the UEFA Nations League and looking to back it up with another victory.

Mihail Caimacov opened the scoring for them in the 32nd minute before Ian Nicolaescu doubled their advantage from the penalty spot in the added minutes of the first half.

With the Reds unable to find their way back in the second half, the Moldovans sealed all three points to begin their campaign on a winning note. As the side will resume their Nations League fixtures next month, they will be looking to build momentum by beating San Marino too.

Ranked the lowest at 210th according to FIFA, they are the weakest side in the world, but recently ended their long wait for a win as La Serenissima beat Liechtenstein in the Nations League. Nicko Sensoli netted in the 53rd minute to give the minnows their first win in 20 years.

La Serenissima have never scored in eight games against the Tricolours.
The sides are clashing for the first time since November 2018.

Moldova vs San Marino Prediction

Moldova have had a decent run this year compared to the last, and will feel confident of their chances here too, especially against a side that they have dominated historically.

San Marino will be buoyed by their last win, but we expect them to return to losing ways here, as consistency has never been their forte.

Prediction: Moldova 2-0 San Marino
