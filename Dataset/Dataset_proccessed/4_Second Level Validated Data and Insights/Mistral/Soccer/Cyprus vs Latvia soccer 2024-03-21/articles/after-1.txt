What do you need to know about the Euro 2024 qualifiers? / Thomas Lohnes/GettyImages

All eyes in Europe at the end of the 2023/24 season will turn to the European Championship in Germany.

24 teams will compete for continental glory at Euro 2024, with the eight-month long qualifying campaign deciding the 20 nations that will have the chance to etch their name into the history books.

A complicated format involving the Nations League will decide the other qualifiers as Italy look to defend the title they won at the expense of England at Wembley Stadium at the delayed Euro 2020.

Here's everything you need to know about Euro 2024 qualifying.

Euro 2024 qualifying format

Hosts Germany have qualified automatically as is tradition, which means 23 spots are there to play for. While Italy are the defending champions, they don't qualify automatically for Euro 2024.

53 nations have been divided into ten groups, with seven groups containing five teams and three containing six teams. Each team will play everybody in their group home and away, with the winners and runners-up of each group advancing to the Euro 2024 finals.

The remaining three spots will be decided via the play-offs. These will take place in March 2024 with 12 teams taking part. These teams will be selected based on their performance in the 2022/23 Nations League, and, obviously, they mustn't have already qualified for the finals.

Euro 2024 qualifying dates

Euro 2024 qualifying begins at the end of March 2023 before concluding in mid-November 2023. The shorter turnaround thanks to the winter World Cup means qualifying will be completed within eight months.

Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs

12 teams will compete in the Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs. Obviously, these teams will not have already qualified, and will be decided by their performance in the 2022/23 Nations League.

The teams will be selected from Leagues A to C, with all group winners automatically qualifying for the play-offs. If any winners have already qualified, they'll be replaced by the next-best ranked team from the same league. Teams from League D will be picked if fewer than four teams from a given league have failed to qualify.

The 12 teams will then be divided into three paths, with the winners of each making up the last three teams to qualify for Euro 2024. Each path contains a semi-final - played over two legs - and a final.
