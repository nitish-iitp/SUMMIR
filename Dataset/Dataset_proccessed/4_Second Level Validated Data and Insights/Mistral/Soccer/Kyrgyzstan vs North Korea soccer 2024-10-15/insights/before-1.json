        "Alimardon Shukurov is set to retain his spot in the engine room for Kyrgyzstan. Defender Tamirlan Kozubaev, who scored in the wrong goal against Qatar, should keep his place in the backline alongside Valeri Kichin and Eldiyar Zarypbekov. Struggling to pose a consistent threat against the 2022 World Cup hosts, the White Falcons could make some attacking alterations for this clash. Regardless of his crucial penalty miss versus the UAE, former Juventus and Cagliari forward Kwang-Song Han will hold onto his spot in the North Korea side. There is set to be some changes for Chollima in the attacking line, though, with 22-year-old Jo-Ruk Ri hooked off during the half-time break on Thursday night."
