Denmark 2-0 Serbia: Player ratings as Gronbaek and Poulsen scored apiece to sink the Eagles in Nations League clash
Denmark vs Serbia
UEFA Nations League

Denmark overcame Serbia 2-0 in their UEFA Nations League clash on Sunday. Albert Gronbaek and Yussuf Poulsen struck apiece to hand the Danes a vital win in their group. The Eagles were underwhelming here, failing to bring their A-game to the fore, and spending much of the clash on the backfoot. Here are the player ratings for Denmark and Serbia:

Goalkeeper

Kasper Schmeichel – 7.5/10: Saved both shots he faced and came away with a clean sheet too.

Defenders

Rasmus Kristensen – 8/10: Turned in a good shift, marked with three clearances, two interceptions and two tackles.

Jannik Vestergaard – 7/10: Strong in the air and had great vision.

Joachim Andersen – 6.5/10: Some vital interventions here and there but was eclipsed by better players around him.

Midfielders

Alexander Bah – 7.5/10: Won a game-high of 10 duels on the night, which showed how vital he was to win back possession.

Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg – 8.5/10: The only player on the night to complete passes in triple digits (100), making seven tackles as he ran the game for Denmark with his spatial intelligence, creativity and imperious ball control.

Christian Norgaard – 6/10: Failed to offer any resistance to Serbia’s advances.

Victor Kristiansen – 7.5/10: Set up Poulsen for their second goal.

Forwards

Albert Gronbaek – 8/10: Put the Danes in front with a clinical goal in the 36th minute.

Yussuf Poulsen – 9/10: Assisted the first and then scored the second.

Christian Eriksen – 7.5/10: Made eight crosses in the game and laid three key passes.

Substitutes

Morten Hjulmand – 6.5/10

Gustav Isaksen – 6/10

Goalkeeper

Predrag Rajkovic 5/10: Was helpless for both of Denmark’s goals and failed to make a single save in the game.

Defenders

Strahinja Erakovic – 7/10: Competed ferociously for the ball and demonstrated his keen eye for tackle too.

Nikola Milenkovic – 7/10: With eight clearances, he certainly showed excellent vision, while also blocking one shot and making two interceptions.

Strahinja Pavlovic – 7.5/10: Made four clearances, six tackles, and won seven ground duels, a testament to his monumental efforts on the night.

Midfielders

Kosta Nedeljkovic – 5/10: A non-factor for much of the game.

Ivan Ilic – 6.5/10: Circulated the ball around well but could’ve defended more when his side needed it.

Marko Grujic – 7/10: Was having a better game than most, but was somehow taken off at the break.

Sasa Lukic – 5/10: Failed to win most of his duels and misplaced a couple of passes too.

Veljko Birmancevic – 6.5/10: Far too sloppy in possession, having lost it 21 times, but was effective off the ball with his tackles and perfectly timed duels.

Forwards

Lazar Samardzic – 7.5/10: Serbia’s brightest player, integral to winning back possession and timed his tackles to perfection.

Luka Jovic – 5/10: Was devoid of proper and cut an isolated figure up top.

Substitutes

Andrija Zivkovic – 6.5/10

Stefan Mitrovic – 6.5/10

Petar Ratkov – 6/10

Kristijian Belic – 6.5/10

Dorde Jovanovic – N/A
