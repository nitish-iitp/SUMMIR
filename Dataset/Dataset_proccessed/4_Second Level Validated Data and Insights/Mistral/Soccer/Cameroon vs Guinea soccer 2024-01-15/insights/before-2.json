        "Cameroon have gone under the radar in the buildup to this showpiece event, with most onlookers expecting the likes of Morocco, Egypt, Senegal and the hosts Ivory Coast to feature in the latter stages of the tournament.",
        "All things considered, being just the eighth-favourite in the competition may suit the Indomitable Lions just fine, though, as they will not be burdened as much by the weight of expectancy, especially after a very average warm-up match, which saw them draw 1-1 to Zambia last week.",
        "Despite what the bookmakers may think, you simply cannot write off Cameroon in any competition, especially AFCON, as they are still one of only three countries to ever successfully defend the continental crown.",
        "In addition, the Indomitable Lions - who won their fifth AFCON title in Gabon in 2017 when they were unfancied as well - are the second-most successful nation in the history of this competition behind The Pharaohs (seven titles).",
        "Cameroon also have a habit of performing at their best in West Africa, as they are the only side to have won three AFCON titles in the West of the continent. Their first victory came here in the Ivory Coast back in 1984 before their back-to-back triumphs in 2000 and 2002 in Nigeria and Mali, respectively.",
        "Guinea, though, are definitely a team to keep an eye on in this competition and they raised a fair few eyebrows in the lead-up to the competition when they beat Nigeria in their sole warm-up match last week.",
        "The National Elephants have improved immensely over the last five to seven years and enter the tournament ranked 15th among African nations, according to the latest FIFA world rankings.",
        "Guinea reached the knockout stages of the last competition and have solid momentum heading into this edition, having only lost one of their last six matches while winning four and drawing one of the other five.",
        "Despite Cameroon's record in this competition, Kaba Diawara's side have been the more successful in the head-to-head battle in recent times, winning the last two encounters in 2021 and 2017."
