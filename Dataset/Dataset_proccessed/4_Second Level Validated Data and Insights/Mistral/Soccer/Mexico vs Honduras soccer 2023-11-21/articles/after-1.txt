CONCACAF Nations League

How to watch the Concacaf Nations League match between Mexico and Honduras, as well as kick-off time and team news.

Mexico host Honduras in the second leg of the CONCACAF Nations League quarter-final with the home side looking to turn around a 2-0 lead in their own backyard.

Mexico are on the verge of missing out on a semi-final spot for the first time since 2005 where they failed to reach the top 4 in the CONCACAF Gold Cup. El Tri were disastrous in the first leg especially in the goalscoring department having taken just eight shots with two going on target. Facing a resilient Honduras side, Mexico will have to bring their A game if they want to turn around the scoreline.

Anthony Lozano and Bryan Rochez scored on either side of the half to give a daunting lead as they visit the Estadio Azteca in hopes of making it through to the semi finals. Honduras have been solid defensively having conceded just once in six games and Mexico could have a massive challenge trying to break the visitors' defensive wall.

Here, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch, including TV channel, streaming details and more.
