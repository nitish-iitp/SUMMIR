Malaysia's starting eleven (top L to R) defender #21 Dion Cools, midfielder #14 Syamer Kutty Abba, defender #03 Shahrul Saad, defender #21 Dion Cools, goalkeeper #16 Syihan Hazmi, defender #02 Matthew Davies; (bottom L to R) defender #06 Dominic Tan, midfielder #08 Stuart Wilkin, midfielder #17 Paulo Josue, forward #07 Faisal Halim, and forward #12 Arif Aiman pose for the group picture before the start of the Qatar 2023 AFC Asian Cup Group E football match between Bahrain and Malaysia at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on January 20, 2024. AFP PIC

Malaysia were eliminated from the Asian Cup in Doha after losing their second Group E game, 1-0, to Bahrain.

AHMAD SYIHAN HAZMI (6/10):

The goalkeeper was up to the task in denying most of Bahrain's attempts. But if he had been a millisecond faster in his dive, he could have prevented Ali Madan's late winner.

DION COOLS (6/10):

Played solidly in defence and also looked dangerous when helping out in attack. Could have given Malaysia an early lead but couldn't hit the target.

SHAHRUL SAAD (6/10):

Returned to the starting line-up and proved to be an upgrade in defence. Worked hard to break Bahrain's attack.

DOMINIC TAN (6/10):

Was criticised earlier in the loss to Jordan but this time he didn't put a foot wrong. However, it couldn't prevent a loss.

MATTHEW DAVIES (6/10):

The team captain performed better in their second group match, and could have scored the winner but his volley was off target.

LA VERE CORBIN ONG (6/10):

The lanky player looked reliable on the left flank and his long throws were a menace though the end result was disappointing.

STUART WILKIN (7/10):

Continued his commendable form from the first match and was outstanding in providing a shield to the defence from midfield.

SYAMER KUTTY ABBA (6/10):

Put up a tigerish performance in the middle of the park but his yellow card in the 19th minute proved to be costly as coach Kim Pan Gon took him out in the second half.

ARIF AIMAN HANAPI (6/10):

The nippy flanker managed to trouble the Bahraini defence but could not make the chances count.

FAISAL HALIM (6/10):

Another Harimau who looked dangerous but could not deliver the killer blow.

PAULO JOSUE (6/10):

The makeshift target man brought the much-needed bite upfront with his hold-up play, and combined well with Faisal and Arif. After he was replaced by Romel Morales in the 75th minute, Malaysia's attack looked blunt.

SUBS & COACH

NATXO INSA (4/10):

There were high hopes of Natxo changing the course of the game when he replaced Syamer in the second half. But Natxo was a letdown and is clearly past his prime.

AKHYAR RASHID (5/10):

Came in for Arif Aiman with the aim of pressing the Bahraini defence for the winner. However, his impact was minimal as he was tightly guarded.

ROMEL MORALES (4/10):

Newly naturalised Colombian substituted Josue but obviously needs more time to blend with Harimau Malaya, and his performance in Doha showed.

MOHAMADOU SUMAREH (4/10):

Came in late into the match for Faisal but clearly was not as impactful as he had five years ago.

KIM PAN GON (6/10):

The South Korean coach's plans looked solid for most of the match but in the end Malaysia lost to the better team as his substitutes couldn't impact the match.
