        "Retrospect: China are unbeaten in their five international games against Lebanon (V4 E1), keeping a clean sheet in each of their last four games against them; however, this will be the first time these teams have met in the Cup",
        "Speak, Aleksandar Jankovic!: 'There are still two games to go, so there's no point in drawing conclusions about the chances of qualifying. After analyzing our previous game, we identified some weak points as well as positive trends, which we will study in more depth and use to the best of our ability. Our enthusiasm and motivation haven't waned since the first game and I think both teams are equally capable of winning. So our goal is very simple - just to score one more goal than Lebanon.'",
        "Speak, Miodrag Radulovic!: 'Playing the opening match of the Asian Cup was overwhelming for the team and made us make some silly mistakes and give the opposition opportunities, but that's history now and the competition starts for us with the second match. China are a very balanced team with a lot of experienced players and we have a lot of respect for them. Against a team like that, I want to ensure a balanced rhythm throughout the game, which may mean resting some players and mixing up the squad a bit. The competition in the group is still open and we'll be fighting for the six points that are still up for grabs. I'm very optimistic about the game, especially with the support we've received from the stands.'"
