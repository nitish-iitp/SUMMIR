Portugal manager Roberto Martinez has demanded action amid spectators attempting to get photos with superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.

A young fan made it onto the pitch during the Selecao's Euro 2024 win against Turkey on Saturday and took a selfie with Ronaldo. Several others then evaded the attention of stewards to enter the field of play, with five making it on in total.

Portugal are back in action on Wednesday, taking on Georgia in their final group game. Martinez will have the luxury of rotating his squad, with the weekend victory securing top spot in Group F, but Ronaldo could yet receive minutes as he looks for his first goal of the tournament.

Broadcaster Piers Morgan was among those to warn something serious could happen without better protection for players. And, speaking to reporters ahead of the Georgia game, Martinez voiced his own concerns.

"He’s a very experienced player, he’s been with the team for over 20 years," Martinez said of Ronaldo. "He knows the kind of support fans provide, but not just Portugal fans, football fans.

“I hope there won’t be any pitch invasions. This is dangerous and it’s not good for football, it’s not a part of the game that we want to see.”

When asked about rotation, meanwhile, he was clear in his reaction. “It’s important to maintain the integrity of the Euros," the Spaniard added. "It’s a very important game because this result will be crucial to determine who qualifies and who doesn’t.”

Georgia can still join Portugal in the rround of 16 if they beat their rivals in Gelsenkirchen. A defeat to Turkey and a draw against the Czech Republic has left them with a lot to do, but four points would see them progress - be that in second or third.

Portugal know their next game will be played on July 1 in Frankfurt, though their opponents are yet to be determined. They will play against one of the third-placed teams, though which team won't be confirmed until all the group games are finished.

Martinez's team have won two games from two, though they left it late against the Czech Republic in their opener. Lukas Provod fired the Czechs in front inside the final half-hour, but Robin Hranac's own goal brought Portugal level before substitute Francisco Conceicao scored a late, late winner.
