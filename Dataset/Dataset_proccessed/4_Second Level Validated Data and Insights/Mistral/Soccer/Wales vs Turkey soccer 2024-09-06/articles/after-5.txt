Craig Bellamy began his Wales reign with a hugely entertaining, but ultimately goalless, stalemate at home to ten-man Turkey in the opening game of the UEFA Nations League.

Aaron Ramsey and Joe Rodon both came close during a blistering first half from the hosts, while Sorba Thomas had a goal chalked off for offside just before the break.

Baris Yilmaz was sent off after the interval for a second bookable offence, but Wales were forced to make do with what will still be considered a well-earned point.

This was the first glimpse of a new era for Wales, who will look to build on what was a performance brimming with positives when they head to Montenegro on Monday.

Since taking the job in July, Bellamy's meticulous approach to the finer points of the game had been a key driver in some of the early expectations around his reign.

'Information' was the word that repeatedly surfaced when the squad were quizzed on the first impressions of the new man in the hot-seat.

Bellamy's attention to detail is perhaps only matched by the burning passion he clearly already has for this job.

Indeed, he admitted this week the emotions of stepping out as Wales boss for the first time would likely tug on the heart-strings, but also insisted he wouldn't be allowing himself to be getting too swept up in the emotions of it all.

That apparent steeliness and composure must have been sorely tested by a typically stirring rendition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau ahead of kick-off. An anthem that acted as a release for the intoxicating cocktail of expectancy, intrigue and, dare we say, outright excitement, that had previously crackled through the nation ahead of this highly-anticipated curtain-raiser.

But for all the talk of a new era, the protagonists in this opening episode were largely the same.

Bellamy made just two changes to the side that hosted Turkey here back in November, with Thomas handed his first start in over two years, while captain Ramsey, who this week responded to questions over his international future by claiming he had 'unfinished business' with Wales, also started from the off.

But there was a noticeable freshness about the way Wales handled themselves against a Turkey side stepping onto the international stage for the first time since their impressive run to the quarter-finals of Euro 2024.

The sight of Ramsey effectively starting up front perfectly demonstrated the organised chaos that unfolded during the opening half.

It was intense. It was frantic. It was slick. It was a hell of a lot of fun.

Some didn't really know what to make of it. Least of all Turkey, who struggled to get out of their own half against a ferocious and dogged Wales press.

Ramsey nearly handed his boss a dream start inside seven minutes, powering a header just over the bar following a pinpoint Connor Roberts cross.

Ethan Ampadu then sent an effort off-target from distance, before Rodon spurned another glorious chance by spooning effort over the bar from close range.

Turkey were rattled, and their frustrations threatened to boil over when Yilmaz took a tumble in the box after a coming together with Rodon just before half an hour. The Turkey number nine was incensed, as was his boss Vincenzo Montella. Both were booked for their trouble.

At this point, the only criticism you could level at Wales was that they couldn't find the net.

Thomas thought he'd changed that just before the break, latching on to Ramsey's ball over the top to lob goalkeeper Mert Gunok, only for his effort to be ruled out by the offside flag.

Thomas then drove a low effort just wide from distance shortly after the restart, as Wales looked to pick up where they left off, although the sight of Yilmaz landing a header onto the roof of the net was a gentle reminder that there was still plenty of life in this game.

Still the chances came for Wales. Brennan Johnson swept wide at the near post, before Harry Wilson bent an effort agonisingly off-target himself.

Once again, Turkey's composure began to fracture, and to the surprise of approximately no one, a moment of idiocy from Yilmaz saw the visitors reduced to 10 men. The striker this time guilty of a poor challenge on Neco Williams.

Turkey responded by sending on Balon d'or nominee Hakan Calhanoglu, but Wales remained the more likely to find a breakthrough, with Wilson sending another low drive just wide.

However, the hosts couldn't find the breakthrough their performance deserved.

That will perhaps be a cause of slight disappointment on the night, although Turkey might well have claimed a smash-and-grab win had Abdulkerim Bardakci not sent a header straight at Danny Ward.

If it wasn't already evident, the Craig Bellamy era promises to be anything but boring.

A warning

Yilmaz has just about calmed down from all his whinging in that first half, and has seemingly remembered he's a decent footballer.

Rises brilliantly to meet a cross from the left, but his header lands on the top of the net.

Davies then gets down to block an effort from Kokcu a few moments later.
