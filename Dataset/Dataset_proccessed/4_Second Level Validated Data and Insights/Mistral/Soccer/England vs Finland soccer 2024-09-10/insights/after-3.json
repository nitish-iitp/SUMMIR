        "England interim manager Lee Carsley speaking to BBC's chief Football correspondent John Murray about being interim manager at Wembley: 'I spoke about how proud I was to be the head coach in Dublin and again same position. The family will be there, cheering England on, fantastic achievement not only for myself but the staff. Ashley, Joleon, Tim, it's a brilliant achievement for them.'",
        "Henry Winter, Football writer on BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I think we'll see 4-2-3-1 again. I think we'll see Angel Gomes, who did so well for Lee Carsley in the Under-21s when they won the Euros last summer, will come in alongside Declan Rice in midfield.'",
        "Chris Sutton speaking on the Monday Night Club about whether Newcastle boss Eddie Howe is a 'clear and obvious candidate' to become England manager, instead of Lee Carlsey: 'I think so. I think he would come into the thinking if he became available in the coming weeks. Something isn't quite right at Newcastle, so if he became available, I think the FA would have a big decision to make.'"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "England interim manager Lee Carsley spoke to BBC's chief Football correspondent John Murray on his role. Here is what he had to say: 'I've said from day one, I really feel the support and trust and belief. It really helps when you feel that you're getting that support from your bosses. I think the role of a head coach/manager has changed, as have positions in football. I think we have to adjust to that. I think for whoever comes in, it's important that we support them and play to their strengths. I see my strength in coaching, developing players and hopefully developing teams. I'm going to need help with the other parts of the job, while I'm here on an interim basis, [I'm] definitely getting that. This is something I've quite enjoyed. It's been good.'"
