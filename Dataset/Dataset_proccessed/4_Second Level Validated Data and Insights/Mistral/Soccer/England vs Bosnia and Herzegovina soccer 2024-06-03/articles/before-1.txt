How England could line up against Bosnia-Herzegovina
By Ben Knapton, Senior Reporter

England manager Gareth Southgate should not risk captain Harry Kane for the Three Lions' Euro 2024 warm-up friendly with Bosnia-Herzegovina at St James' Park on Monday evening.

The Bayern Munich hotshot was hampered by a back injury towards the end of the 2023-24 season, and while his Euros participation is not in danger, it would be a surprise to see him turn out from the off here.

In addition, Manchester United duo Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire are on the recovery trail too alongside Anthony Gordon, while Jude Bellingham, Kobbie Mainoo, Phil Foden and Kyle Walker will link up with the team later next week after their recent club commitments.

With Kane encased in bubble wrap, Aston Villa talisman Ollie Watkins should hold off Ivan Toney to lead the line on Monday night, although Southgate is spoiled for choice when it comes to his supporting cast.

The England boss has also confirmed that Bukayo Saka will be rested ahead of Friday's tie with Iceland, so a start surely awaits Cole Palmer, most likely with Eberechi Eze on the other side.

In spite of Adam Wharton's brilliant exploits for Crystal Palace, Declan Rice and Conor Gallagher are way ahead of him in the England pecking order, while Trent Alexander-Arnold could also be tested in a midfield slot again.

As Maguire undergoes treatment and John Stones is also spared, Marc Guehi and Lewis Dunk expected to be the men to benefit in the backline, which should also comprise Jordan Pickford, Ezri Konsa and makeshift left-back Kieran Trippier.

England possible starting lineup:
Pickford; Konsa, Dunk, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold, Rice, Gallagher; Palmer, Watkins, Eze
