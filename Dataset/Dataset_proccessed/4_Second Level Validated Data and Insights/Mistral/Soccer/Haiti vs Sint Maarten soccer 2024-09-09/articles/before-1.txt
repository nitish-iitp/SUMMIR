The score was unchanged at half-time.

Back from the locker room, after judicious tactical changes by the French coach (bringing on Duckens Nazon and Deedson Louicius to energize the attack), our Grenadiers quickly restored the balance after a frustrating first half... In the first minutes, Danley Jean Jacques equalized in the 50th minute [1-1] before Frantzdy Pierrot gave Haiti the lead with a goal in the 59th minute [1-2].
