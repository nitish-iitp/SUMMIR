Morocco’s national team, the Atlas Lions, defeated Lesotho 1-0 in a hard-fought match on Monday evening at the Adrar Stadium in Agadir.

The Moroccan team, already qualified as the host country, advanced in its AFCON qualification campaign with today’s win after scoring one goal, by Brahim Diaz, in stoppage time in the 93rd minute.

Despite a strong overall performance under Regragui’s guidance, the players were unable to fully capitalize on many scoring opportunities.

Ayoub El Kaabi, who scored in Friday’s match against Gabon, nearly achieved a goal in the first half. On a corner kick, he successfully touched the ball but failed to score in the 39th minute.

Similarly, Abdessamad Ezzalzouli missed an open goal in the second half of the match (63rd minute).

For Walid Regragui, the match against Lesotho served as a warm-up before the tournament’s more challenging matches.

Following the victory against Gabon (4-0), the head coach opted for a comprehensive reshuffle of the starting lineup.
