        "Lee Carsley talks to ITV. “I think we were probably second best for a lot of tonight … it’s disappointing … it’s important we respond well against Finland … we tried something different … it’s a case of trying again … all of the goals came from mistakes … even at 1-1 we were quite fortunate at that point … when you’ve got someone of Harry Kane’s quality, it rules [the new system] out … in the future we’ve got to have that courage to try things … my remit is to do the three camps and nothing changes in that respect.”"
