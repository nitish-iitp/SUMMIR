September 6, 2024, at the Parc des Princes in Paris, France and Italy will be much awaited opponents in the UEFA Nations League. Set to start at 18:45, this game marks the League A, Round 1 start of the tournament. Sandro Scharer from Switzerland will be the referee for this game; he is scheduled to officiate what looks to be an exciting clash between two of Europe’s most historic footballing countries. With 48,229 stadium capacity, the Parc des Princes is expected to be packed with fervent supporters ready to see these teams carry on their age-old rivalry.

Both teams arrive for this game bearing something to prove. Having lost eventual winners Spain in the semi-finals of Euro 2024, France is hoping to recover in front of their native supporters. Italy, meantime, is keen to bounce back from a dismal Euro 2024 performance whereby Switzerland eliminated them in the Round of 16. For both sides, this opening game of the UEFA Nations League marks a fresh beginning and a path for atonement.

These two teams are expected to be fiercely competitive given their historical relevance in European football and their competitive character.

France Results

France enters this match with mixed results from their recent games. They have struggled to find consistency, and this is reflected in their results across different competitions.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
09.07.24	EUR	Spain vs France	2-1	L
05.07.24	EUR	Portugal vs France	0-1	W
01.07.24	EUR	France vs Belgium	1-0	W
25.06.24	EUR	France vs Poland	1-1	D
21.06.24	EUR	Netherlands vs France	0-0	D

France’s recent form shows a mixture of wins, draws, and losses. They managed to secure wins against Portugal and Belgium but were defeated by Spain in their most recent match, indicating some inconsistency. Draws against Poland and the Netherlands further underline their struggle to dominate games. Didier Deschamps will need to address these issues to ensure a positive start in the UEFA Nations League.

Italy Results

Italy, on the other hand, has also faced challenges in their recent matches. Their form suggests a team looking for stability and better performance outcomes.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
29.06.24	EUR	Switzerland vs Italy	2-0	L
24.06.24	EUR	Croatia vs Italy	1-1	D
20.06.24	EUR	Spain vs Italy	1-0	L
15.06.24	EUR	Italy vs Albania	2-1	W
09.06.24	FI	Italy vs Bosnia & Herzegovina	1-0	W

With just two victories in their last five games, Italy’s latest performances have been disappointing. Losses against Spain and Switzerland point to defensive weaknesses; a draw against Croatia reveals their trouble winning against a strong opponent. Though the team has to find more consistency, the wins against Bosnia & Herzegovina and Albania give some hope.

France vs Italy Head-to-Head

When it comes to head-to-head encounters, France and Italy have a rich history of competitive and friendly matches. Here is a look at their most recent five meetings:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
01.06.18	FI	France vs Italy	3-1
01.09.16	FI	Italy vs France	1-3
14.11.12	FI	Italy vs France	1-2
17.06.08	EUR	France vs Italy	0-2
08.09.07	EUR	Italy vs France	0-0

The historical data shows a slight edge for France in recent encounters, having won three out of the last five matches. Italy, however, won their last competitive fixture back in 2008. This suggests that while France might have an advantage based on recent form, Italy’s past success in key matches could influence the outcome.

France Probable Lineup

As France prepares to face Italy in the UEFA Nations League, Didier Deschamps is expected to field a strong and balanced lineup. The French team will likely rely on their defensive solidity, midfield strength, and attacking flair to gain an edge in this crucial encounter.

Maignan (GK), Kounde (RB), Saliba (CB), Konate (CB), T. Hernandez (LB), Kante (CM), Tchouameni (CM), Zaire-Emery (CAM), Dembele (RW), Thuram (ST), Mbappe (LW)

Italy Probable Lineup

Italy, under the guidance of Luciano Spalletti, is anticipated to adopt a more dynamic and flexible formation. The Azzurri will aim to leverage their strong defensive organization and creative midfield to challenge the French team effectively.

Donnarumma (GK), Di Lorenzo (RWB), Buongiorno (CB), Bastoni (CB), Cambiaso (CB), Fagioli (CM), Frattesi (CM), Dimarco (LWB), Pellegrini (RW), Zaccagni (LW), Retegui (ST)

INJURED AND QUESTIONABLE PLAYERS

Injuries, suspensions, or other circumstances will make several important players from both teams absent for this game. Understanding how each team might operate and what tactical changes might be required depends much on knowing which players are absent. The players below will not be attending the forthcoming game:

France – Will Not Play	Reason	Italy – Will Not Play	Reason
Wesley Fofana	Injury (Fitness)	Gianluca Scamacca	Injury (ACL)
Ferland Mendy	Injury	Nicolo Barella	Surgery (Sinus)
Adrien Rabiot	Free Agent (Unfit)	Gianluca Mancini	Not Selected
Benjamin Pavard	Not Selected	Jorginho	Not Selected

These absences will force both Didier Deschamps and Luciano Spalletti to make tactical adjustments and rely on other players to step up and fill the gaps. It adds another layer of complexity to the match, making the final outcome even harder to predict.

Injuries: Both teams have notable absentees due to injuries, including Italy’s Gianluca Scamacca and France’s Wesley Fofana;
Team Form: Recent results have been mixed for both sides, with neither team displaying dominant form;

Free Tips on France vs Italy

Examining the forthcoming game between France and Italy calls for a thorough review of many numbers and trends. Knowing how these two teams have lately combined with important statistics will help one forecast possible results. Based on statistics and data from past games and team meetings, these free pointers could help you have an advantage while betting.

Head-to-Head Performance: Historically, France has had the upper hand in their recent meetings with Italy, winning three of the last five encounters. This suggests that Les Bleus might have a psychological advantage going into this game, particularly with the support of their home crowd at Parc des Princes. Analyzing past head-to-head statistics can give you a better idea of which team tends to perform better in direct confrontations.
Home vs. Away Records: France tends to perform exceptionally well when playing at home, as evidenced by their recent competitive fixtures. Playing in familiar surroundings with a supportive crowd could give them the boost they need to outperform Italy. Conversely, Italy’s recent away form has been shaky, and they may struggle to adapt to the pressure of playing in Paris. This factor is crucial in understanding which team might have the upper hand in this matchup.
Player Fitness and Availability: Injuries and suspensions can significantly impact a team’s performance. For this match, Italy will be missing key players like Gianluca Scamacca and Nicolo Barella, which could weaken their lineup. On the other hand, France’s squad, although missing a few names like Wesley Fofana, still looks stronger on paper. Always check the latest team news before making a bet, as the absence of key players can alter the dynamics of the game.
Recent Form and Momentum: Both teams have shown inconsistent form in recent matches, with France winning only two of their last five games and Italy struggling similarly. However, momentum can shift quickly in football, especially in a high-stakes competition like the UEFA Nations League. It’s essential to consider the psychological state of both teams, especially as they look to bounce back from their respective disappointments in Euro 2024.
Managerial Tactics and Changes: Didier Deschamps and Luciano Spalletti are both experienced managers with distinct tactical approaches. France’s tendency under Deschamps has been to play more conservatively, while Spalletti’s Italy may experiment with a back three. Understanding these tactical nuances and how they align against each other’s style can provide insights into how the match may unfold.

By considering these factors, you can make more informed predictions on the outcome of the France vs Italy match. Stay updated with the latest team news, analyze previous performances, and consider the psychological and tactical elements at play to enhance your betting strategy.
