The world champions dominated Thursday's game, with the Atletico Madrid new boy showing just why the Rojiblancos paid so much for him

Argentina avoided a Copa America hangover in their first match since claiming the 2024 trophy, defeating Chile 3-0 in World Cup qualifying on Thursday. Goals from Alexis Mac Allister, Julian Alvarez and Paulo Dybala sealed all three points in an emphatic victory.

Ahead of the contest, La Albiceleste, all the fans in attendance and those around the world watched as Argentina paid tribute and goodbye to legend Angel Di Maria. The dynamic winger announced his international retirement after winning the Copa, and with his family by his side, he gave a emotional speech in front of a sold-out crowd, with flashlights from cell phones beaming from the stands and cheers echoing from around the ground.

After a dynamic and contentious first 45 minutes, the two sides went into half-time scoreless. However, Argentina came out of the break with intensity, and just three minutes into the second half, Mac Allister fired home to give them a 1-0 lead off an Alvarez assist.

The story of the final 45 wasn't the Liverpool midfielder, rather it was Alvarez, who energised the big stage in the absence of the injured Lionel Messi. The Atletico Madrid striker looked comfortable in a front-two, and his moment arrived in the 84th minute. He received the ball on the edge of the box, hit a lovely turn and fired in a rocket of an effort that bounced in off the crossbar.

A third goal came in stoppage-time, with Roma star Dybala coming off the bench and launching a a strike into the back of the net.

With the victory, Lionel Scaloni's side stayed atop the CONMEBOL standings in World Cup qualifying, with 18 points out of 21. They hold a five-point lead over second place Uruguay, with Colombia - Argentina's next opponents on Tuesday - in third.

GOAL rates Argentina's players from Estadio Mas Monumental.

Goalkeeper & Defence

Emiliano Martinez (8/10):

Made an outstanding save in the first half, and was a rock when called upon in the late stages. Another top display.

Lisandro Martinez (7/10):

Was a threat in attack from set-pieces, including one chance on target. A well-rounded performance from the Manchester United defender.

Cristian Romero (7/10):

Composed out of the back. A few dodgy moments, but he recovered well.

Nicolas Otamendi (8/10):

A passing clinic from the veteran of the defensive trio. Still brilliant at 36, completing 96 percent of his 84 total passes.

Midfield

Nahuel Molina (7/10):

Composed as a wing-back, operated down the right flank well.

Rodrigo De Paul (8/10):

Class as always in the middle of the park. Was composed on and off the ball and led as a veteran should with a youthful midfield around him.

Alexis Mac Allister (8/10):

Sensational in the middle of pitch, and scored the crucial opener. Linked with the striker tandem well.

Enzo Fernandez (7/10):

Not his most influential performance, but didn't put a foot wrong, either.

Nico Gonzalez (6/10):

Subbed off with an injury minutes into the second half. Employed as a wing-back, he kept Chile quiet when called upon, but didn't influence the attack much.

Attack

Lautaro Martinez (6/10):

Not his best evening. Struggled to find space, but did play a decent decoy to help Mac Allister bag his effort. No shots on the night.

Julian Alvarez (9/10):

A nice assist on Mac Allister's opener, but his moment came in the 84th minute, when he bagged his long-range stunner from 20 yards out. Brilliant showing.

AFP
Subs & Manager

Giovani Lo Celso (8/10):

Subbed on for an injured Gonzalez early in the second half and bagged an assist for Alvarez's stunner. Great cameo.

Marcos Acuna (6/10):

Subbed on with 11 minutes to spare. Helped close out match.

Paulo Dybala (8/10):

Subbed on in 79th minute and capitalised on the moment, scoring the third goal. Perfect performance off the bench.

Alejandro Garnacho (7/10):

Assisted on Dybala's third, was lively off the bench in his 11 minutes, plus stoppages.

Valentin Castellanos (N/A):

Subbed on in the 89th.

Lionel Scaloni (8/10):

A brilliant second half. Whatever he said at half-time inspired his players, and they turned up for the final 45 as a different team. The attack was blistering, and Alvarez looked the best he's been in a shirt for La Albiceleste. Should be thrilled.
