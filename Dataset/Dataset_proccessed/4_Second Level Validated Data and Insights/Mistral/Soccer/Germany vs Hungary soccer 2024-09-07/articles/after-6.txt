Niclas Fullkrug scored his first Germany goal since joining West Ham in the summer

Germany eased to victory over Hungary to start their Nations League campaign in style in Dusseldorf.

Niclas Fullkrug put Germany ahead from Jamal Musiala's ball to cap off a fine passing move.

Musiala doubled Germany's lead as they broke from a Hungary corner, running through one on one from his own half to slot home.

Florian Wirtz, who set up that goal, then got the ball from Musiala before drilling in from 16 yards.

Aleksandar Pavlovic scored their fourth with a low shot, his first Germany goal.

Kai Havertz, who hit the underside of the crossbar in each half, scored a penalty to complete Julian Nagelsmann's side's comfortable win.
