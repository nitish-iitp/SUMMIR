AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS: CAPE VERDE REACH LAST 16 WITH OVER MOZAMBIQUE, SENEGAL THROUGH, GUINEA BEAT GAMBIA
BYTHE EDITORIAL TEAM

UPDATED 19/01/2024 AT 22:16 GMT

Former Manchester United winger Bebe scored as his Cape Verde became the first team of the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations to reach the last 16 of the tournament. Cape Verde won 3-0 in Abidjna to go top of their group. Later on Friday, Senegal beat Cameroon 3-1 to earn qualification, and the evening kick-off saw Guinea defeat Gambia in the other Group C match.

Bebe scored as Cape Verde beat Mozambique 3-0 to reach the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations, and in Group C Senegal qualified with a win over Cameroon, and Guinea beat Gambia.
The Cape Verde winger is perhaps still best known for his surprise transfer to Manchester United in 2010 but after a peripatetic spell he has established himself at Rayo Vallecano in Spain.

The 33-year-old scored from the set piece on 32 minutes, but Mozambique 'keeper Ernan Siluane bears some blame for conceding from such a long-range effort.

There was another defensive error from Mozambique as Cape Verde’s captain Ryan Mendes scored on 51 minutes, after Edmilson Dove failed to control a ball on the edge of the box and lost possession.
Kevin Pina then grabbed a brilliant third for his side when he struck a fierce shot into the top corner from outside the area.
In a one-sided affair in Abidjan, Geny Catamo threatened most for the beaten side. He earned a penalty in the first half which was then overturned by a video review, and he also struck the woodwork with a free-kick.

The victory leaves Cape Verde on six points after two matches in Group B, with Egypt in second on four, and both Mozambique and Ghana with a single point each.
Cape Verde are the first team to qualify for the knockout round.
In the day's second match, Senegal beat Cameroon 3-1 in Group C, also earning a spot in the next round.
Goals from Ismaila Sarr, Habib Diallo and Sadio Mane took them through, with Cameroon scoring through Jean-Charles Castelletto.
Guinea put themselves in a strong position to also gain qualification from Group C with a 1-0 victory over Gambia in the last match of the day.
The win and three points moves them into second spot in the table, three clear of Cameroon on one point, while Gambia remain pointless having lost both their matches so far.
Guinea scored on 69 minutes through Aguibou Camara, as he turned in a low cross from the right-hand side of the box.
