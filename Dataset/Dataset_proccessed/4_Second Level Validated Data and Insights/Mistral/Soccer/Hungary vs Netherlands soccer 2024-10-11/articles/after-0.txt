UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
HUNGARY 1-1 NETHERLANDS - VIRGIL VAN DIJK SEES RED AS DENZEL DUMFRIES EARNS POINT FOR ORANJE IN NATIONS LEAGUE
BYMARCUS FOLEY

UPDATED 11/10/2024 AT 21:43 GMT

Ronald Koeman's Netherlands needed a late goal from Denzel Dumfries to secure a point on the road at Hungary in the UEFA Nations League. Roland Sallai gave Hungary the lead in the first half at the Puskas Arena and things looked good for the home side when Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off but Denzel Dumfries popped up with a leveller in the 83rd minute.

Virgil van Dijk was sent off as Denzel Dumfries rescued a point for Netherlands in the UEFA Nations League as they drew 1-1 with Hungary at the Puskas Arena on Friday.
In an even opening 20 minutes, Hungary came closest to breaking the deadlock when Roland Sallai struck a post from Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner, but it did not take much longer for the home side to draw first blood.

A threatening attack followed just after the half-hour mark, which saw Zsolt Nagy dink a wonderful cross from the left to the unmarked Sallai, who made no mistake as he poked a careful volley beyond Bart Verbruggen at the back post.

SZOBOSZLAI PANENKA EARNS HUNGARY LAST-GASP DRAW AGAINST GERMANY

19/11/2024 AT 22:36

The visitors had a great chance to level the scores when they were gifted an in-direct free-kick inside the penalty area after a mix-up between the Hungary goalkeeper and Szoboszlai, but Denes Dibusz made amends for his lapse in concentration when he saved Cody Gakpo’s effort and clung onto the ball in a busy six-yard area.
Netherlands pushed for an equaliser for much of the second half and came close through efforts from Stefan de Vrij and Tijjani Reijnders, but Hungary held firm as they looked to seal their first win over their Dutch opponents.
Liverpool’s Van Dijk received two yellow cards in as many minutes and was sent off as the visitors were reduced to 10 players, but just minutes later they found an equaliser as Dumfries headed home from a Gakpo cross.
TALKING POINT - VAN DIJK SEES LATE RED
In what is probably good news for Liverpool with big Premier League matches against Chelsea and Arsenal coming up, Van Dijk will play no further part in this week’s international break after his sending-off.
It was a silly red card to receive too. The first booking came in the 77th minute for venting his frustrations at the referee following a foul on Donyell Malen, and the second came two minutes later when he hauled down Kevin Csoboth who was driving down the wing.
In 77 international appearances, it is the first time the centre-back has been sent off and now he is set to miss their huge clash with Germany.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - DENZEL DUMFRIES (NETHERLANDS)
The Inter Milan full-back threatened the right flank and produced a solid defensive performance where he made the most tackles and won the most duels in the match.
But it was his contribution towards the other end of the match that made the real difference. He took the armband off Van Dijk following his fellow defender’s dismissal, and just four minutes later headed his side on level terms with a brilliant goal.
MATCH RATINGS
Hungary: Dibusz 7, Fiola 6, Orban 7, M.Dardai 6, Bolla 6, Nikitscher 7, Schafer 6, Z.Nagy 7, Szoboszlai 7, Sallai 8, Varga 6
Subs: Gera N/A, Botka 6, A.Nagy 6, Csoboth 5
Netherlands: Verbruggen 6, Dumfries 8, De Vrij 7, Van Dijk 6, Van de Ven 7, Gravenberch 7, Q.Timber 7, Simons 7, Reijnders 7, Gakpo 8, Zirkzee 6
Subs: Hato N/A, De Ligt N/A, Til 6, Brobbey 6, Malen 6
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
17’ - OFF THE POST! Hungary have a corner and Szoboszlai delivers a low effort to the edge of the box where Roland Sallai is waiting. The Galatasaray midfielder wraps his right boot around a first-time strike, but can only watch on as it crashes off the foot of a post and goes behind for a goal kick. It was a great effort and that's the closest we've come to an opener!
26’ - BIG SAVE TO DENY REIJNDERS! The midfielder surges towards goals and unleashes a low shot, but the Hungary shot-stopper gets down well to deny him. Netherlands win a corner which Dibusz punches clear, but only as far as Timber, who strikes from a long way out but the ball flashes wide of the post.
32’ - GOAL!!! - HUNGARY 1-0 NETHERLANDS (SALLAI): Hungary find the opener! Zsolt Nagy slips down the left and delivers a pinpoint, dinked delivery to Sallai who is totally unmarked and waiting in the box. He connects with a sweet volley which beats Brighton's Verbruggen at the back stick.
36’ - YOU DON'T SEE THIS EVERY DAY! Netherlands have an in-direct free-kick inside the penalty area after a mix-up at the back between the goalkeeper and Szoboszlai, where the latter takes a touch from the goal-kick instead of Dibusz. Reijnders, Simons, Gakpo and Zirkzee are standing over the ball which is about 10 yards from goal, with every Hungary player lined up on the goal line! What a chance this is.
39’ SAVED! Reijnders lays the ball off Gakpo who fires it straight at the goalkeeper, who does exceptionally well to hold on to the ball and Hungary's lead!
53’ - TOP SAVE FROM DIBUSZ! He looks unstoppable today! Gakpo delivers a free-kick from the wide left and Stefan de Vrij connects with the ball well, glancing an effort across goal which Dibusz palms away.
57’ - MASSIVE CHANCE FOR NETHERLANDS! Reijnders runs through on goal but takes an awful touch as he takes the ball away from the goalkeeper. He tries to keep the threat alive with a hopeful dink into the box, but Hungary clear the danger. What a waste, Koeman's side should be level.
79’ - VAN DIJK SENT OFF! Just minutes after receiving his first caution, the Liverpool defender fouls Kevin Csoboth as he makes a run down the left wing and is given his second booking! The Netherlands are now not only a goal down, but a player down as well!
83’ - GOAL!!! - HUNGARY 1-1 NETHERLANDS (DUMFRIES): The Netherlands find the equaliser! Dumfries takes over the armband from Van Dijk, and instantly pulls his side level as he heads home from another wonderful Gakpo delivery!
KEY STATS
In five matches, Hungary are still winless against the Netherlands (zero wins, one draw and four defeats)
Van Dijk received the first red card of his international career (77th appearance) in the draw against Hungary.
