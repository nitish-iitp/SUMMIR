Moldova will face Malta at the Stadionul Zimbru on Saturday in the opening game of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign. The home side performed fairly well in the previous edition of the Nations League, winning four of their six group games but ultimately missed out on promotion due to goal difference.

They were thrashed 4-0 by Ukraine in their most recent outing, conceding twice in either half as they fell to their heaviest defeat since 2022.

Malta have endured a poor run of form in recent games and will be desperate to turn a corner when they return to competitive action this weekend. They were beaten 2-0 by Greece in their last match, conceding both goals in the opening 15 minutes and failing to offer a response in an overall disappointing performance at the Untersberg-Arena in Austria.

The visitors had mixed results in the 2022 Nations League, winning their two games against San Marino and losing their two against Estonia to finish second in their group with six points from an obtainable 12.

Moldova vs Malta Prediction

Moldova's latest result ended a run of back-to-back victories and they will be looking to bounce back here. They have lost just one of their last six games on home soil and will be hopeful of a positive result this weekend.

Malta are on a run of consecutive defeats and are without a win in their last eight games across all competitions. They have lost their last five games on foreign grounds and could see defeat here as well.
