        "Julian Nagelsmann doesn't yet have his full squad available on account of several players called up for the Euros being involved in Saturday's Champions League final",
        "Considering it was his senior international debut, Beier showed absolutely no fear when he came off the bench an hour in and made Germany look a completely different prospect",
        "The 21-year-old's strike against the inside of the post was literally his very first touch",
        "Beier had other great chances that could have easily have resulted in a hat-trick on another day",

        "Julian Nagelsmann doesn't yet have his full squad available on account of several players called up for the Euros being involved in Saturday's Champions League final",
        "That meant no Toni Kroos, Niclas Fullkrug, Nico Schlotterbeck or Antonio Rudiger here",

        "Germany will follow up with a second warmup friendly on June 7 when Greece are the visitors in Monchengladbach",
        "After that, there is exactly one week until Julian Nagelsmann's side open Euro 2024 as hosts against Scotland in Munich",
