        "Burundi are participating in their 11th AFCON qualification campaign, but have only made it to the main draw of Africa’s biggest cup competition once, which was back in the 2019 edition when they were knocked out in the group stage without winning a game.",
        "Burkina Faso have been a regular feature at the Africa Cup of Nations over the past decade, having only failed to reach the main draw once (2019) in each of the last eight editions.",
        "Since taking up the head coaching role back in March, Brama Traore has now overseen five competitive matches and only lost one, which was his first against Egypt, meaning he is now unbeaten in the last four, including two draws and back-to-back wins ahead of this one.",
        "Burkina Faso have scored in every match since Traore's arrival and the eight goals they have netted in this competition to date is the second-most of any participating nation only behind Algeria."
