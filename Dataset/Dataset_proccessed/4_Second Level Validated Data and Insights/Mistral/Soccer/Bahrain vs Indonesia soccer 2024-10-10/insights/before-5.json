        "Maarten Paes joined the Indonesian national soccer team in Bahrain but it is not certain if he will play against Bahrain on October 10.",
        "Paes is the last player to arrive in Bahrain. He arrived yesterday. While other Indonesian players have been in Bahrain since October 6.",
        "Paes suffered an injury to his hand while still with his club, FC Dallas. The injury he sustained has shown positive progress. He was also seen not wearing a bandage on his injured hand.",
        "Yesterday, Paes was seen training with the Indonesian national team. However, coach Shin Tae-yong cannot guarantee that Paes will play against Bahrain on October 10.",
        "Shin Tae-yong said that Paes's chances of playing are 70%. However, his condition will be observed today and tomorrow.",
        "If Paes is unable to play, supporters of the Indonesian national team need not worry too much. There are still Ernando Ari Sutaryadi and Nadeo Argawinata who are ready to replace him.",
        "Even though the quality of the two is not as good as Paes, Ernando and Nadeo have also been the main goalkeepers for the Indonesian national team. With the presence of Mees Hilgers, the Indonesian national team's defense can be stronger.",
        "If Paes is unable to play, Shin Tae-yong will certainly have the best options. The possibility of Paes returning to defend the Indonesian national team against China on October 15 is high."
