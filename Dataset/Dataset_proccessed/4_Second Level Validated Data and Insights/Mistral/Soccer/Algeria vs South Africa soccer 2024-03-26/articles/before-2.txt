Algeria vs Bafana Prediction:

Bafana Bafana will test themselves against former African champions, Algeria in a FIFA Series match on Tuesday night. South Africa is still in high spirits after finishing third at the recent CAF African Cup of Nations tournament in Ivory Coast.

Under the management of Hugo Broos, Bafana will bank on their fine run and will look to cause an upset against the highly-rated Algerian side. Fresh from a 1-all draw against Andorra last week, Bafana will look to core goals at Nelson Mandela Stadium in Algiers.

On the part of the hosts, the Algerians will also target a win after their dismal Afcon campaign. The North Africans come into this game on the back of a come-from-behind 3-2 triumph over Bolivia last week, with goals from Amine Gouiri, Yassine Benzia, and Mandi giving new coach Vladimir Petkovic a winning start to his reign.

The Desert Foxes boasts top football stars such as Aissa Mandi, Nabil Bentaleb, Yacine Brahimi, and Said Benrahma among others. However, the hosts will be without Ismael Bennacer due to injury, while Ramy Bensebaini is doubtful for the clash while Riyad Mahrez was left out of the squad at his request.

Looking at the 1996 African champions, Bafana will be a different side on Tuesday when the likes of Themba Zwane, Ronwen Williams, and Siyanda Xulu are all set to return to the starting eleven. Coach Broos is wary of the Algerians but they are a beatable opponent.

Algeria vs Bafana Bafana Key Battles To Watch:

Themba Zwane: The Mamelodi Sundowns skipper and Bafana creative midfielder will be one of the players to watch in the tie. Zwane will be key for Bafana to ensure they rotate the ball and cause all sorts of problems for the hosts.

Yacine Brahimi: The industrious Al Gharafa midfielder will be tasked with opening up the defence of Bafana. With his silky touches and brilliant movement off the ball, Brahimi is one of the players to watch for the Foxes.

Algeria vs Bafana Bafana Head to Head:

Looking at head-to-head stats, Algeria and South Africa have met in four matches dating back as far as January 1996. Each team has claimed one win, while two games have been drawn. Their most recent meeting was in the group stage of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, with Algeria claiming a 3-1 win in Mongomo, Equatorial Guinea, thanks to an own goal from Thulani Hlatshwayo and strikes by Faouzi Ghoulam and Islam Slimani.

Hugo Broos:

The former AFCON winner with Cameroon boasts extensive knowledge of African football and will look to guide Bafana to a win. The Belgian will look to secure a win just before the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Nigeria and Zimbabwe.

Vladimir Petkovic:

The newly appointed coach will want to start his tenure on a high and bag a win over the South Africans. Petkovic was appointed after the AFCON tournament. Formerly in charge of Switzerland at the previous FIFA World Cup, the Bosnian mentor is aware of the demands and challenges of African football.

Algeria vs Bafana Fan Sentiments

With Bafana fresh from their impressive run at AFCON, there is no doubt that the fans will expect a win over their hosts. While many still doubt Bafana under Broos who is controversial in his team selections, some South Africans believe he has restored the nation’s hopes.
