        "Craig Goodwin is looking to continue his strong club form for the Socceroos as he prepares to don the Green and Gold in his beloved Adelaide under new boss Tony Popovic.",
        "Goodwin was quick to compliment his new coach, saying: ‘I think he’s had great success wherever he’s been. I’ve not worked with him yet, but coming up against his teams, they’re always well organized and very difficult to play against. And you can see he’s a winner. He’s a winner as a coach, his mentality, his answers in his interviews.'"

    "Post-Match Reflections": [
        "Speaking on the difficult start in the first two matches, Goodwin spoke about the importance of reflecting on performances and feeling the weight of wearing the Australia badge. ‘I think probably most of us would have thought about it individually and self-reflected to look at the way we performed as individuals,’ he continued. ‘Obviously, there are always things that you can look at tactically, but first and foremost, we have to look at ourselves. We know that the performances across the two games weren’t good enough and weren’t at the standard that we know we can provide and have provided over the last two, three years.’"
