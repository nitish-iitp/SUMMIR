HOME  DONCIC DOES NOT DEFLECT BLAME AFTER THE MAVERICKS' LAMENTABLE LOSS TO THE ROCKETS: "IT'S MY FAULT"
Doncic does not deflect blame after the Mavericks' lamentable loss to the Rockets: "It's my fault"

The Texans' star acknowledges his horrible start to the game that his teammates ended up paying for.

Luka Doncic, star of the Dallas Mavericks.

It's been a strange start to the season for Luka Doncic. He hasn't been in top form, and the Dallas Mavericks are feeling it. With Klay Thompson joining the starting lineup, they haven't maintained the defensive and offensive reliability they had at the end of last season.

Today, they suffered a defeat against the Houston Rockets in a game where the Slovenian started poorly, leading to an early deficit that the Mavs couldn't recover from: "That's on me. I started pretty badly, so I'll take the blame because I need to do better. I know I can. I just need to focus and play my game."

We'll see if the Slovenian can focus. He ended yesterday's game with 29 points but only 2 assists. As mentioned, there's a lack of fluidity, despite Kyrie Irving starting the season strongly (28 points yesterday). Another factor in the loss was Dereck Lively getting into foul trouble and only playing 15 minutes. Against serious opponents like these dynamic Rockets, they need him.

Rockets' Impressive Performance

The Rockets secured the Texas derby with a team effort, having up to 6 players scoring more than 10 points. Jalen Green once again led with 23 points and 12 rebounds. Alperen Sengun and Dillon Brooks each scored 17 points, and Tari Eason contributed 15 off the bench. A great start to the season for Ime Udoka's team.
