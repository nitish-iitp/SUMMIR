We show you how to unlock a free 3-month NBA League Pass subscription and $300 in bonus bets with FanDuel's exclusive promo code, just in time for the 2024-25 NBA season - but act quickly as it expires at the end of the weekend!

This FanDuel promo code unlocks an NBA League Pass discount code until Sunday, October 27th, 2024.

As of Friday, October 25th, 2024, just two days remain to claim this promo code for NBA League Pass, officially announced by FanDuel. The $74.97 NBA League Pass discount is set to expire on October 27th, 2024 at the conclusion of the weekend. This time-sensitive offer guarantees basketball fans a free three-month subscription to NBA League Pass, whether or not their first $5 bet wins. In addition, if that first $5 wager is successful, bettors will also unlock $300 in bonus bets.

With the deadline looming, many bettors have been strategically placing their $5 wagers on high-profile games, including potential playoff series preview of the Western Conference in the Phoenix Suns vs. Los Angeles Lakers game on Friday night, to ensure they can activate the promo in time for the NBA's opening week and unlock League Pass. This approach maximizes the value of FanDuel’s deal and ensures NBA League Pass access for the season’s start.

In this article, we’ll break down the FanDuel promo code, explain the benefits of NBA League Pass, and highlight why now is the perfect time to take advantage of this expiring offer.

What Does FanDuel Offer with the NBA League Pass Discount?

NBA League Pass is the ultimate service for basketball enthusiasts, offering complete access to live NBA games, in-depth content, and much more. Normally priced at $24.99 per month, the FanDuel promo code allows you to save $74.97 over three months, half of the entire season, providing access to:

Every out-of-market NBA game live and on-demand
Streaming on up to three devices at the same time
Commercial-free game viewing
Condensed game replays for quick highlights
Customizable game broadcasts with real-time stats and different camera angles
24/7 NBA TV access for continuous analysis and coverage

By using FanDuel’s promo code, you’ll not only receive this incredible streaming service, but you’ll also have a chance to claim $300 in bonus bets, making this offer perfect for NBA and sports betting fans alike.

How the FanDuel NBA League Pass Discount Code Unlocks Your Free Trial:

Here’s how to take advantage of the FanDuel NBA League Pass discount before it expires on October 27th, 2024:

Sign up for a new FanDuel account using this FanDuel NBA League Pass promo code.
Deposit at least $10 into your account.
Place a $5 bet on any sports event. Whether your bet wins or loses, you will still receive three free months of NBA League Pass. If your bet wins, you will also unlock $300 in bonus bets.

Tip: To maximize your chances of claiming the bonus bets, consider placing your $5 wager on any matchup in Friday's 8-game NBA schedule. You’ll activate your NBA League Pass promo in time for the rest of the week, while giving yourself a shot at securing the bonus funds.

Unlock the $74.97 NBA League Pass discount for 2024 by following these simple steps. 

Why This FanDuel Promo Code Is a Must-Grab for NBA Fans:

Without the free trial, NBA League Pass costs $24.99 per month, but this FanDuel offer saves you $74.97 by covering the first three months. That means you can stream every NBA game, enjoy exclusive content, and stay up to date on all the action without the added cost. Additionally, with the $300 bonus bets contingent on your $5 wager winning, this promo offers the best value for fans who enjoy betting on sports and watching basketball.

Key NBA Games to Watch with NBA League Pass:

With the 2024-25 NBA season officially here, here are some marquee games you can catch with your FanDuel NBA League Pass discount during the league's opening week:

Suns @ Lakers (October 25th, 2024): Two of the game's biggest stars, Kevin Durant and LeBron James, face off in a possible Western Conference postseason preview.
Mavericks @ Timberwolves (October 29th, 2024): Luka Dončić and the Dallas Mavericks take on the Minnesota Timberwolves in a Western Conference Finals clash of titans.
Warriors @ Celtics (November 6th, 2024): A much-anticipated Finals rematch form 2022 between the Golden State Warriors and the Boston Celtics.
Nuggets @ Timberwolves (November 1st, 2024): Two Western powerhouses clash as Nikola Jokić leads the Denver Nuggets against Minnesota.

With your NBA League Pass subscription, you’ll have front-row access to these and many other top matchups throughout the season.
