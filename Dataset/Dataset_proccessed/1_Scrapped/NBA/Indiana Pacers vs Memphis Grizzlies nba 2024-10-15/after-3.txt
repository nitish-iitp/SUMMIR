Zach Edey's game appears to be translating to the NBA level just fine.

Though it is still just the pre-season, the Canadian big man dominated in the Memphis Grizzlies' 120-116 win over the Indiana Pacers on Monday.

Edey, 22, finished with 23 points on an efficient 10-of-15 shooting in just 18 minutes of action off the bench. Toronto native also grabbed nine rebounds, one shy of a double-double.

The seven-foot-four centre was selected ninth overall by Memphis at the NBA Draft to serve as a replacement for Steven Adams, who was traded to the Houston Rockets ahead of the deadline last season.

The two-time College Player of the Year was a force at Purdue, averaging an absurd 25.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game last season en route to guiding his Boilermakers to their first national championship game since 1969. Purdue lost to back-to-back champs UConn in the final

Edey is currently one of the favourites to bring home the NBA's 2024-25 rookie of the year award.
