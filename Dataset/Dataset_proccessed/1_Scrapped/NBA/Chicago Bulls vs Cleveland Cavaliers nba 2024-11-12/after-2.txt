Dosunmu swished a pair of free throws with 4:26 remaining in the third quarter to stretch the Chicago advantage to 85-76, its largest lead of the night.

Cleveland responded with nine straight points over the next 1:33 to tie the game. Another pair of Dosunmu free throws gave the Bulls the upper hand again, but they never led after the 2:24 mark of the quarter as the Cavaliers closed the third on a 19-7 run.

LeVert contributed seven points during the surge.

Cleveland led 67-66 at halftime behind a 25-point effort from Mitchell, who went 9-for-15 from the field before the break. He twisted for a cutting, 360-degree layup as part of a 10-0 run early in the second quarter.

Five double-figure scorers helped keep Chicago afloat, with White (16) and LaVine (13) setting the pace.

Jalen Smith, who was coming off a 10-point night during Saturday’s win at Atlanta, missed the game for the Bulls due to illness.
