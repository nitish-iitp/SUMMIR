The Lakers-Warriors preseason matchup in Las Vegas last night drew an announced crowd of 16,907 inside T-Mobile Arena, and Lakers coach JJ Redick said the city “has proven to be an excellent sports town,” according to W.G. Ramirez of the AP. Redick: “Whether it’s been the hockey team, WNBA team, the NFL team, there’s a nice following.” Ramirez notes sitting courtside behind the Warriors bench were L.A. Sparks F Dearica Hamby with daughter Amaya and teammate G Rae Burrell, while undefeated super lightweight boxer Emiliano Vargas had a seat “directly behind” F LeBron James on the Lakers’ bench. Hamby during halftime said, “The city shows up when they get the opportunity to support basketball in Las Vegas.” Ramirez writes the “marriage” between the NBA and Las Vegas arguably started during the 1983-84 season, when the Jazz scheduled 11 “home” games at the then-newly built Thomas & Mack Center on UNLV’s campus. The Lakers then began playing preseason games in Las Vegas in 1988. The NBA Summer League has been a “staple” in Las Vegas since 2007, with games also played on UNLV’s campus. With the league’s "impending” expansion, which would make the NBA a “regular night out each season,” Warriors F Draymond Green “doesn’t see the allure of Las Vegas wearing off.” Green: “It’ll never wear off” (AP, 10/16).
