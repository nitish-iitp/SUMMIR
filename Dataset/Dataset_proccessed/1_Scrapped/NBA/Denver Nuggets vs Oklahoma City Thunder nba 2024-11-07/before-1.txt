Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best picks on Thursday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Nikola Jokić (DEN, C)	$24,720	68	2.8
Value	Daniel Gafford (DAL, C)	$8,270	34.7	4.2
Fade	Buddy Hield (GSW, SG/SF)	$14,350	22.4	1.6
Cheapie	Neemias Queta (BOS, C)	$6,000	21.6	3.6

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K

Conclusion

When building your NBA Thursday teams, consider starting with a value player like Daniel Gafford. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Nikola Jokić is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Neemias Queta.

On the other hand, according to our model, Buddy Hield is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building multiple line-ups.
