Memphis built an eight-point lead late in the first quarter, but the Nets closed the period on a 10-2 run for a 34-29 advantage.

The Grizzlies briefly reclaimed the lead (39-37) on a 3-pointer by Jackson early in the second quarter before Schroder followed with a 3-pointer of his own. The latter basket put the Nets on top, and they were up 67-62 at halftime.

Brooklyn scored the first eight points of the third quarter, extending the edge to 13 points and soon to 14. However, fueled by Clarke’s eight points in a three-minute span, the Grizzlies tied the game at 83-all with 2:39 remaining in the third.

The Nets pulled away in the final quarter behind Schroder, who hit 5 of 6 shots in the period en route to 11 points. He recorded his fourth straight game with 20-plus points and five-plus assists.
