Victor Wembanyama visibly frustrated in preseason game vs Heat after teammate overlooks wide-open lob opportunity - Image Source: Getty

San Antonio Spurs sophomore Victor Wembanyama showed a moment of frustration during the preseason game against the Miami Heat on Tuesday when a teammate missed an opportunity to pass to him in the paint.

Less than three minutes into the third quarter, Harrison Barnes brought the ball up in transition, while the 7-foot-4 Wembanyama outran the defense. Wembanyama spun and cut to the basket, losing his defender, but Barnes passed to Chris Paul, who was jogging toward the 3-point line instead of Wembanyama.

Wembanyama clapped his hands in frustration and was heard shouting in disappointment on the broadcast. Jimmy Butler anticipated the pass, and what could have been an easy lob to Wembanyama turned into a turnover, leading to an easy layup for the Heat star.

Paul and Barnes are two of the Spurs’ key veteran additions this offseason as the team aims to improve on last year’s 22-60 record.

The Spurs struggled with guard play last season, often relying on forward Jeremy Sochan as their primary point guard.

Can Chris Paul fix the Spurs’ point guard issues and unlock Victor Wembanyama?

Chris Paul has extensive experience playing alongside elite big men. During his time with the LA Clippers, he maximized the talents of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, helping the team earn its "Lob City" reputation with his exceptional playmaking.

Paul has thrived with every big man he's played with, including Clint Capela (Houston Rockets), Steven Adams (OKC Thunder), DeAndre Ayton (Phoenix Suns) and Kevon Looney (Golden State Warriors).

This offseason, Paul joined forces with another towering star in 7-foot-4 Victor Wembanyama, one of the two tallest active players in the NBA. Reflecting on their early games together and a highlight lob play in their first preseason game together, Wembanyama said:

"Felt very natural. Felt like it was the good play. And he’s making a lot of good plays. (per Fox San Antonio).”

Wembanyama also praised Paul’s impact on the Spurs, emphasizing the value of having an experienced veteran on the court.

“Being on the court with him certainly feels like he’s got things in control,” Wembanyama said. “It’s reassuring, a little bit. It’s one more teammate I can rely on in tough moments or doubt moments. It’s only positive.”

In his preseason debut, Paul recorded five points, three assists and two rebounds in 23 minutes, followed by a three-point, eight-assist performance. Both games resulted in Spurs victories.
