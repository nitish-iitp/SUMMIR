In addition to her confessional soundbites and werkroom fights, Muse’s status as a villain comes from association, as she belonged to the same drag house as another Drag Race villain, Aja. Muse is also known for a meme featuring her sitting alone in the VIP section of a club, which ended up being a key part of her verse on the Drag Race track “ConDragulations.”
