Jump to the 2023-24 Panini Black Basketball checklist and team set lists.

2023-24 Panini Black Basketball walks in darkness. The color is the running theme throughout the checklist, which is modest in size, particularly when you compare it to most modern products. It also happens to be an online exclusive available originally through Panini’s website.

Hobby boxes hold five cards, one of which is an autograph.

2023-24 Panini Black Basketball Checklist Overview

The small size of the checklist starts with the base set. Consisting of just 90 cards, it’s an all-stars affair for the first two-thirds. Rookies make up to final 30 cards.

Parallels, which combine to fall two per box, include:

Shine
Silver – /75
Copper – /35
Gold – /25
Amethyst – /15
Ruby FOTL – /15
Quartz – /8
Holo Gold – /5
Emerald FOTL – /3
Platinum – 1/1

Among the product’s signatures are two sets dedicated to NBA freshmen that also include memorabilia swatches, Rookie Memorabilia Autographs and Rookie Jumbo Memorabilia Autographs.

Smoke Show Signatures and new Dead of Night round out the autographs.

The 2023-24 Panini Black Basketball checklist has a pair of five-card insert sets as well, both of which are tough. Vanta returns and is joined by White Night.
