History
The Los Angeles Clippers secured victories against both the New Orleans Pelicans and the Golden State Warriors, showcasing strong performances despite missing star player Kawhi Leonard. Norman Powell's 35 points were crucial in the Clippers' narrow 116-113 win over the Pelicans, where James Harden's decisive free throws in the final minute sealed the game. Against a shorthanded Warriors team without Steph Curry and Draymond Green, the Clippers won 102-92, with Powell scoring 26 points and Ivica Zubac contributing 17 points and 11 rebounds. The Clippers have maintained a strong defensive stance and have been relying on key players like Harden and Powell during Leonard's absence. With these wins, the Clippers have improved their standing, continuing their successful streak even as Leonard prepares to return. The Warriors, on the other hand, are struggling, having lost six of their last seven games, and face challenges with key players sidelined.

Ivica Zubac emphasized the importance of team chemistry during Leonard's absence, stating, 'We want to win games, we want to win every game no matter who’s out there and we got it done.'
With the absence of key players, Jonathan Kuminga of the Warriors scored a career-high 34 points in the game against the Clippers, showcasing his potential despite the team's struggles.
The Clippers' win against the Warriors marked their third victory over Golden State this season, highlighting their dominance in the matchup even with Leonard sidelined.
Despite leading by as many as 19 points, the Clippers nearly surrendered their lead in the fourth quarter, being outscored 30-21 by the Warriors during that period.
James Harden's playmaking has been crucial for the Clippers, as he contributed significantly with 27 points against the Pelicans, including making key free throws in the closing moments.
