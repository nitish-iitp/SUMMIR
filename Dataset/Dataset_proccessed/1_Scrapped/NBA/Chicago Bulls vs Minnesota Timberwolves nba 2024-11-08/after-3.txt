What's On Tap in Chicago Bulls news? Welcome to the 38th edition of "Tasting Flight," a daily newsletter to keep fans updated on all the latest news in Bulls Nation.

Bulls' Perceived Trade Options Continue to Grow

Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reports that rival NBA teams believe Bulls executive Arturas Karnisovas may pivot to exploring trades for guards Ayo Dosunmu and Coby White if he can't find suitable trades for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, or Lonzo Ball.

Bulls Past and Present Land in Sports Analytics Ranking List

Former Bulls guard Alex Caruso and current roster pieces Matas Buzelis and Julian Phillips appeared on Bucknell Sports Analytics' PEST metric rankings list, which measures the most aggressive perimeter defenders in the NBA using the league's player-tracking data.

On the other end of the spectrum lies Nikola Vucevic. Despite his resurgent offensive output to start the season, Vucevic appears near the bottom of Bucknell Sports Analytics' PEST metric rankings (which isn't a surprise to Bulls fans).

For those curious about the PEST metric in detail, Bucknell Sports Analytics posted an X thread describing the methodology for calculating the PEST metric.

Former first-round pick makes case for NBA return with strong G…

Less than a year ago, Malachi Flynn etched his name into NBA history with a remarkable 50-point performance, tying him for the second-highest point total ever scored by a player coming off the bench. Fast forward to today, the 26-year-old guard finds himself out of the league entirely, battling to reignite his professional basketball career in the G League. Flynn, selected 29th overall in the 2020 NBA Draft by the Toronto Raptors, initially showed promise as a reliable contributor off the bench. Despite multiple G League assignments during his time in Toronto, he built a reputation as a capable backup guard. However, his career took a turn when he was traded to the New York Knicks in December 2023 as part of a blockbuster deal involving O.G. Anunoby and RJ Barrett. Flynn’s stint in New York was short-lived, as he was subsequently dealt to the Detroit Pistons a few months later. Following his release from Detroit, his NBA future became uncertain. This past offseason, Flynn signed a training camp deal with the San Antonio Spurs, hoping to secure a spot on their opening-day roster. Despite his efforts, he was waived before the season began and subsequently joined the Spurs' G League affiliate, the Austin Spurs. In Austin, he has been making the most of his opportunity. Through 13 games, the 6-foot-1 guard is averaging 21.2 points, 3.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.8 steals per game. Flynn kicked off the season with an explosive 35-point outing on Nov. 8, adding seven assists and four steals while connecting on six three-pointers. His 37 made threes during the G League’s Tip-Off Tournament ranked 25th in the league, highlighting his offensive capabilities. The former NBA guard's strong G League production positions him as a prime candidate for an NBA call-up. As the season progresses, teams outside of playoff contention often turn to 10-day contracts to evaluate talent for the future. Flynn’s G League contract allows him the flexibility to sign with any NBA team, not just the Spurs, increasing his chances of a return to the big stage. Throughout his career, Flynn has faced challenges with consistency and playing time. His historic 50-point game was followed by a dismal three-point performance on 0-for-12 shooting, epitomizing the fluctuations that have defined his journey. Combined with the instability caused by trades and roster moves, these inconsistencies have hindered his ability to solidify a role in the league. Yet, Flynn remains undeterred. With his sights set on returning to the NBA, he continues to sharpen his skills and prove his worth in the G League, determined to achieve the stability and impact he’s long sought in his professional career.

Vancouver Canucks goalie Thatcher Demko breaks silence on…

Vancouver Canucks goaltender Thatcher Demko returned as the backup after missing two games due to injury. But in conversation with Sportsnet's Ian McIntyre, Demko says after such a long process rehabbing the knee injury that kept him out until early December, dealing with the back spasms that pushed him out recently feels like nothing. Demko's season so far, even beyond injuries, has been up to the high standard he has set for himself, but the 29-year-old says he expected some rust. He says coming back from such a serious injury is new territory for him, but he's confident that he's going to find his A-game again. "This is something I haven't really done before. It's a new path, a new challenge, I think. In some ways it's difficult to kind of put into words... It feels like all the pieces are there. I'm ready to kind of get back to how I was last year. I don't have a doubt that I'll be able to do that." Demko is 2-1-3 with an .881 save percentage since returning from injury in December, last season he posted a .918 save percentage. Thatcher Demko downplays rift Speaking to McIntyre, Demko also addressed the noise around the Canucks and more specifically, Elias Pettersson and J.T Miller. Trade rumors continue to swirl, and five teams could make a move for Pettersson. Although, the price could be quite high. The goaltender said he wanted to "tread lightly" but that he considered the issues to be less about what is supposedly happening in the Canucks dressing room, and more about the fact that the team is underachieving. "People probably wouldn't be talking about all the — quote, unquote — issues in the room if we were winning. So really, it's a winning and losing issue, not an issue of what's going on in the room." If that's the case, Demko getting his game back to where it was last season would go a long way to quieting the chatter.

Canadiens Provide Clarification on the Real Reason for Patrik…

The Montreal Canadiens' forward Patrik Laine is currently missing from the lineup. Unfortunately, tomorrow he will have to miss a fourth consecutive game. Over the past few hours, numerous theories have circulated regarding the true reason for Laine's current absence, and some fans were particularly concerned about his knee. However, the Canadiens' organization has just provided clarification. The real reason for Patrik Laine's absence at the moment, and the real reason he is not accompanying the team to Washington, is that he is still not at 100%. A clarification regarding Patrik Laine See what the excellent journalist Eric Engels published. The Canadiens indicated that Patrik Laine skated alone, but he is not yet back to 100%. He has been absent since the end of last week due to 'flu-like symptoms.' - Eric Engels And the clarification in question: For those wondering, the Habs say there is no other issue preventing Laine from playing at the moment. - Eric Engels So the virus is the only reason for his absence. We wish him a quick return to 100%, and it's obviously good news to learn that everything else is fine for Patty. Let's remember, earlier today, the Canadiens announced that Patrik Laine will not travel with the team to Washington for tomorrow's game. Laine, 26 years old, 6 feet 4 inches, and 208 pounds, has 10 points in 13 games this season with the Canadiens, including 8 goals.

Utah head coach praises big trade by Kent Hughes and the…

Head coach of the Utah hockey team, André Tourigny, was recently interviewed by Martin Lemay on BPM Sports. He discussed the latest trade by Kent Hughes and the Montreal Canadiens, and in his opinion, there is no doubt. It's another big trade successfully executed by Kent Hughes and Jeff Gorton. Tourigny is unequivocal: A Solid Trade for Kent Hughes and the Montreal Canadiens with Alexandre Carrier When asked about this acquisition, Utah's head coach, André Tourigny, mentioned that he immediately knew it would be a massive addition for the Canadiens. 'When the Carrier trade happened, I thought it was a massive acquisition for the Canadiens.' André Tourigny, on BPM Sports And the Quebecois defenseman didn't take long to prove him right. The impact of Alexandre Carrier on the Canadiens' success has been immediate and impressive. The Canadiens' record with Laine and Carrier is worthy of a championship team. Alexandre Carrier, 28 years old, a right-handed defenseman standing 5 foot 11 and weighing 174 pounds, has accumulated five points in nine games this season with the Canadiens (with a +/- of 0). He is emerging as a potential long-term replacement for the highly reliable and useful David Savard, in case of a trade or departure via free agency this summer. Do you believe that with these recent additions, the Montreal Canadiens will actually be able to stay in the NHL playoff race until the end? Considering the team's recent success, it's hard not to believe.
