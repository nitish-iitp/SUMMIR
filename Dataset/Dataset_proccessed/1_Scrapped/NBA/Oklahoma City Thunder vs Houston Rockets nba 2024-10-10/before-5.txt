doesn't look like there were any 30-win teams before last year, but a lot of that is probably an increase in the number of games played

It's not often you get a basketball junkies dream finals, but here we are. I have no clue who's gonna win, how this is gonna go or what we're gonna see. If you told me either team sweeps I wouldn't be shocked and if you told me it goes 5 with every game coming down to the last minute I'd be like "yeah, that tracks".

Can't wait to see how this unfolds.


It's a perfect finals for a lot of reasons (2 best teams, great match-up, etc).

But I do think it's fitting that this board has some diehard Liberty and Lynx fans.

In this year when the WNBA exploded in growth. And every other forum and social media space turned into a toxic wasteland in regards to the W.

Best I can tell, this place said "hey, we're going to have a place discuss this growing league, and do everything we can to keep the conversation about the league with people that appreciate it". An incredibly novel idea, sadly.

From what I can tell, a lot of the people pushing to create this wonderful place are Liberty and Lynx fans.

So, it seems like good karma for this season to come out Liberty or Lynx.

Either way, this is going to be a wonderful series.

To me, Betnijah's health is the biggest x-factor for the Liberty. If she can play close to her normal level and minutes, I really like our chances. If she continues to be limited in effectiveness and minutes, I'm a lot less confident.

At full strength, she's a fourth star-level player. At less than full strength, the Liberty are less able to absorb foul trouble, which has been a problem for JJ and Fiebich, and don't have to rely as much on getting good games from Vandersloot or bench players like Thornton, Sabally, and Burke, rather than just decent hold-the-fort minutes.

Two clear cut best teams in the league playing for all the marbles starting tonight. Woot!

My inclination based on their regular season matchups is to pick the Lynx, however:

a) Not by a lot.
b) Stewie has another playoff gear.
c) Liberty have HCA.
d) Liberty have more rest

and:

e) Fiebich. Leonie's gradual emergence over the course of the season, and then her stellar starter work in the playoffs, are a good reason to fear that this Liberty team is just plain better now than they were earlier.

Unfortunately I think she might be on a minutes restriction. That knee is clearly still bothering her.

If Fiebich and Jonquel get into foul trouble consistently, we will lose. I can't sugar coat it.

People can't say the WNBA is growing when there hasn't been any talk about these games since Clark was eliminated.

These Nat'l debate shows haven't said one word about this finals matchup.

The only person growing is Clark. I have been following the WNBA this year and I can't even name you a single player off the Lynx roster.

Maybe if they talked about more players other than Clark we would follow the sport. This doesn't happen in other sports. All players get shine not just a single player.

Do better Nat'l media. And people wonder why the players hate on Clark. She's the only one that matters to the media.

So you follow the W, but you don't know who Napheesa Collier is? Nah man you are missing out on an all timer. We've been raving about her non stop. She's absolutely fantastic.

Honestly I don't care if they talk about the finals on the debate shows, because every time they do talk about the W they spread toxicity and division between the players. Stephen A and Shannon don't watch games but they sure do have strong opinions.

Also, it's fine either way. The league is growing. Viewership is up and these are non CC games. That means fans who joined in because of her are enjoying the overall product. The growth is happening regardless of ESPN and FOX.

Yeah they really don't add anything to the experience. The games are everything really, it's not like the NBA where drama and player intrigue dominate the national headlines.
