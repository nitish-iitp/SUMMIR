NBA Preseason Odds, Picks & Predictions

Check out our top NBA preseason picks and predictions for today’s games.

Pacers vs. Cavaliers

Cleveland will host the Pacers on Thursday with both teams playing their second game of the preseason. The theme in the first game for both teams was scoring. For Cleveland, both them and Chicago attempted over 108 field goals and 20 free throws. Even in a game where both teams shot 42.2% or worse from the field, they were able to easily go over on the 220.5 line in a 116-112 Cleveland loss. Atlanta and Indiana were in a bit slower paced game but the shooting was lights out. Indiana shot 54.7% from the field and attempted 32 free throws. This helped them light up the scoreboard in a 131-130 loss. Through Tuesday, the over had been 13-4 in the preseason. In this matchup, I don’t see things playing out any differently and will be backing the over.

Pick: Over 227 (-110)

-Ryan Rodeman

Hawks vs. Heat

Miami will host the Hawks in a Southeast Division matchup. Both of these teams got their preseasons started on Tuesday. Miami outshot Charlotte from the field and collected 15 steals, but they kept sending the Hornets to the free throw line who made 27 of their 35 attempts and pulled out a 111-108 win. Atlanta outlasted Indiana in an exciting 131-130 game where the Hawks shot 38.5% from deep and attempted 31 free throws of their own. That ability to can their deep shots and get to the free throw line could play well for them against this Miami team. Atlanta is currently an underdog in this matchup, but this could be a good matchup for the Hawks. It’s worth backing them on Thursday night in Miami.

Pick: Hawks +3 (-110)

-Ryan Rodeman

New Zealand Breakers vs. Thunder

The New Zealand Breakers have already lost two consecutive games against NBA preseason opponents. The Breakers fell to the Jazz, 116-87, but looked even worse against the 76ers, losing 139-84. The Breakers shot 36.1% from the field in that game and hit only 14.3% from downtown. Now they'll take on the Thunder, who are an NBA Championship contender, just like the 76ers. Oklahoma City has gone 1-1 in preseason play. The Thunder most recently lost to the Rockets, 122-113, in overtime. No starter played more than 19 minutes in the game, but Oklahoma City did show off some depth throughout the second half. Oklahoma City has enough talent to hold on to a 40-point lead late. Let's back the Thunder at -36.5 (-115).

Pick: Thunder -36.5 (-115)

-Jason Radowitz

Lakers vs. Bucks

LeBron and Bronny have yet to win a game while on the same team. The Lakers are 0-2 after losing to the Suns 118-114. They're also dealing with many injuries, including Jarred Vanderbilt, Christian Koloko, Jordan Goodwin, and Christian Wood. The Lakers' starting lineup is terrific. However, like last year, the bench still lacks. Dalton Knecht is expected to be a major contributor to the second unit, but he only scored seven points in 21 minutes against the Suns. Max Christie scored 12 points in 29 minutes but shot 3-for-14 last time out. Meanwhile, the Bucks lost their first preseason game to the Detroit Pistons, 120-87. Giannis Antetokunmpo and Khris Middleton didn't play, but a loss that bad is alarming, especially after Damian Lillard still played 17 minutes. Both teams lack depth. Give me the Under 221.5.

Pick: Under 221.5 (-110)

-Jason Radowitz

Jazz vs. Mavericks

It's still likely Luka Doncic will miss tonight's game against the Jazz. Doncic has a calf contusion that could keep him out of the preseason. Doncic also isn't the only injury on the Mavericks. Dante Exum, Kessler Edwards, Brandon Williams, and Maxi Kleber are all dealing with injuries heading into tonight's game. However, the Mavericks did a good job finding quality bench players this year. Against Memphis, Jazian Gortman scored 19 points, and former first-round prospect Oliver-Maxence Prosper scored 14. These guys helped Dallas stick around against Memphis despite no Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, P.J. Washington, and more. On the other hand, the Jazz are 2-0 in preseason, including wins against the New Zealand Breakers and Houston Rockets. Utah is playing its best players and allowing them to play a lot. Lauri Markkanen scored 17 points in 24 minutes, and Keyonte George scored 13 in 25 minutes. Both teams have a bunch of guys who can score at will. I'll back the Over 220.5.

Pick: Over 220.5 (-110)

-Jason Radowitz

Hornets vs. Grizzlies

Despite a 1-0 start, the Memphis Grizzlies are another team with many injury questions heading into tonight's game. Memphis already added a 121-116 win over the Mavericks earlier this preseason. The team’s starting lineup struggled from downtown, including Desmond Bane's 1-for-8 from three. However, the bench was electric from three and helped Memphis close out Dallas with 61 points in the second half. Conversely, Charlotte has played in back-to-back tight games against the Knicks and Heat. The Hornets have gone 1-1 in those two games but have to be excited about LaMelo Ball's return. He looks very healthy and just drained 6-for-12 from three to propel the Hornets past Miami. Don't sleep on Charlotte. With lots of injuries in Memphis, I'm taking the Hornets at +3.5 (-120).

Pick: Hornets +3.5 (-120)
