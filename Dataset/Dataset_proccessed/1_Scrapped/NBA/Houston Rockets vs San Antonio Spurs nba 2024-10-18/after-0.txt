Spurs 2024-25 Betting Preview: Prediction, Roster Projection

The San Antonio Spurs went 22-60 last year.
San Antonio’s win total is 35.5 in 2024-25.

The San Antonio Spurs hope to level up after going 22-60 in the first season with Victor Wembanyama.

NBA futures odds are available at the online sportsbook, including San Antonio Spurs odds for NBA champion, division winner, and player awards.

Spurs Futures Odds

Win Total: 35.5
Southwest Division: +2500
Western Conference: +8000
NBA Championship: +15000

While the Spurs are still an NBA odds long shot, there is more optimism about their overall outlook this year.

San Antonio’s win total is now 35.5 after being 28.5 or lower for four straight seasons. The Spurs finished under their win total of 28.5 last year by 6.5 victories.

Wembanyama is a -150 favorite in the latest Defensive Player of the Year odds.

Spurs Offseason Moves

The Spurs added a nice mix of rookies and veterans to continue their rebuild.

Cedi Osman	W

The Spurs added a veteran point guard when they brought Chris Paul from the Golden State Warriors. Paul, 39, signed a one-year, $10,460,000 contract. He averaged 9.2 points and 6.8 assists per game last year.

Stephon Castle could be San Antonio’s point guard of the future after the team drafted him with the No. 4 pick. He will get an opportunity to develop as the team attempts to build a contender around Wemby.

Harrison Barnes, 32, could also fit nicely after six seasons with the Sacramento Kings. Barnes hasn’t missed a game in two years, averaging 12.2 points per game on 47.4% shooting last season.

Spurs 2024 Betting Prediction

Prediction: Under 36.5 Wins (+100)

Note: This line has moved to 35.5.

The Spurs’ under was among my favorite NBA win total predictions.

And the market clearly agreed with me.

San Antonio’s win total has dropped from 36.5 to 35.5 since making that bet.

The Spurs have won 22 games in each of the last two seasons, and this win total is counting on them leaping into play-in tournament contention. I think that’s too tall of an ask, especially considering how loaded the Western Conference will be this year.

San Antonio might actually be better off having one more tanking season to land a top player in next year’s rookie class.
