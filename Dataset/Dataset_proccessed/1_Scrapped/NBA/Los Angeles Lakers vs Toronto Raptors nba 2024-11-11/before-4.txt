Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best picks on Monday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	LeBron James (LAL, PF/SF)	$19,200	59.4	3.1
Value	Rui Hachimura (LAL, PF/SF)	$9,530	30.3	3.2
Fade	Gradey Dick (TOR, SF/SG)	$12,090	25.2	2.1
Cheapie	Chris Boucher (TOR, C/PF)	$7,520	23.1	3.1

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Late Monday teams, consider starting with a value player like Rui Hachimura. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, LeBron James is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Chris Boucher.

On the other hand, according to our model, Gradey Dick is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building multiple line-ups.
