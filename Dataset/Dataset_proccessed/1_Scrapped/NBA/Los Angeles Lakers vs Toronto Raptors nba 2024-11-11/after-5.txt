Watch as Los Angeles Lakers' Anthony Davis is forced to leave the game after suffering an apparent left eye injury while blocking Toronto Raptors' Jakob Poeltl on Sunday
2 comments

The Los Angeles Lakers may soon be forced to play without their early-season MVP candidate.

Forward Anthony Davis left Sunday's game against the Toronto Raptors with an eye injury and was ruled out by the team in the fourth quarter.

Davis leapt to block a field-goal attempt from Raptors centre Jakob Poeltl in the third quarter, but was inadvertently struck in the face by Poeltl's left hand.

The Lakers big man, who suffered a corneal abrasion in the same eye last March, immediately crumpled to the court in pain.

After the Lakers' 123-103 win over the Raptors, head coach JJ Redick did not have an update on Davis but did share that he was "having trouble seeing."

Davis, 31, was off to a strong start in his sixth season with the Lakers and first under Redick.

He was averaging a league-leading 32.4 points while also collecting 11.3 rebounds per game ahead of Sunday's contest, putting him firmly in the early mix for MVP on a 5-4 Lakers squad.

Davis missed one game earlier this season with a foot injury.
