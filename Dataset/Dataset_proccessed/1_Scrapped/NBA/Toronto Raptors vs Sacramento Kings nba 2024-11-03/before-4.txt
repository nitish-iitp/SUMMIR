Buducnost Team News

In their previous game, Buducnost suffered a decisive defeat to Hapoel Tel Aviv, 92-82, in the sixth round of the EuroCup, putting them at a tough 2-4 record after a period of weaker performances. The top scorers in that loss were Rasheed Sulaimon and McKinley Wright with 13 points each, which helped them get in decent form ahead of their next match in the ABA League, where they hold a 5-1 record.

Buducnost continues to experience a season full of ups and downs, although initially, it seemed that Andrej Zakelj’s team was ready to make a step forward in the EuroCup. Their biggest test was the game against Crvena Zvezda on home court, when their opponent came in tired, yet Budućnost failed to capitalize, losing in a close finish, which later affected their results in European competition. They suffered decisive losses to Bahcesehir and Hapoel Tel Aviv, arguably two of the strongest teams in the group. Given that Buducnost is relatively weaker than those squads, the losses weren’t unexpected, but the manner of the defeats is certainly something that can’t satisfy the Montenegrin team. Against Hapoel Tel Aviv, they only put up a fight in the first quarter, where they had the upper hand, which merely seemed to motivate their opponent. Hapoel responded swiftly, winning the second quarter 29-16. They were equally dominant in the third quarter and then comfortably closed out the game. Buducnost had no answers for Johnathan Motley, who scored 30 points, raising the question once again of whether the ABA League team has centers good enough for this level, both offensively and defensively.

Buducnost’s key advantage is their toughness, and it’s expected that they can impose their rhythm in that way. They must stop Mega’s transition play and their points in the paint, which has been their upcoming opponent’s main strength in recent rounds. If they succeed, they’ll have a good chance at an easy win.

Mega Team News

Mega lost their previous game to Igokea, 73-64, on their home court, bringing their ABA League record to 4-2 and marking their second consecutive defeat. The top scorers for the Belgrade team in that game were Bogoljub Markovic with 16 points and Mihailo Petrovic with 14. Now, they will have to step up.

In the last game, Mega faced strong resistance from a very organized Igokea team, which looks excellent under the guidance of head coach Nenad Stefanovic. This time, Marko Barac’s team’s offense struggled and couldn’t handle the opponent, as shown by their low score of just 64 points. Mega had a poor three-point shooting performance, going only 5/21, which certainly contributed to their second consecutive loss. They also couldn’t capitalize on their rebounding advantage (41 to 30) due to an unacceptable number of turnovers—20 in total. Whenever Mega’s young team encounters a tough opponent, it seems like the same story unfolds: Barać’s team sometimes rushes too much, as was the case here, and it will surely serve as a valuable lesson for upcoming challenges and possibly even a playoff push if they get a bit of luck. Currently, Mega plays the fastest-paced basketball in the league, with 75.8 possessions per game, the highest in the league, and they hold the fourth-best offensive rating. These are all positive signs, and despite the loss to Igokea, Mega has a solid foundation for building confidence for the important games ahead.

Buducnost is the second-best defensive team in the ABA League by defensive rating, which means Mega should aim to disrupt their opponent offensively to make everything else easier. This will require good shooting percentages, which can sometimes be an issue for Mega, but this time, it’s almost a must.

Buducnost vs Mega Prediction

Buducnost is motivated to respond after their EuroCup loss by putting on a stronger offensive display against Mega. It’s no secret that the Podgorica team performs better on their home court, and they’re hosting a team that plays at a fast pace and is always ready to be highly efficient. For this reason, we believe the total points will exceed the proposed line.
