He’s in his feelings.

Drake called DeMar DeRozan a “p–y” after the NBA star’s team, the Sacramento Kings, lost to the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night.

According to a video shared online, the “Toosie Slide” rapper, 38, said, “F–k outta here, p–y,” as DeRozan, 35, walked by on the court.

It’s unclear if the basketball star heard Drake’s remark.

Drake’s rep declined to comment on the incident.

Page Six has also reached out to DeRozan’s reps but did not immediately hear back.

During the game, the five-time Grammy winner told reporters he would remove DeRozan’s banner from the rafters if Toronto ever retired his number.

“If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself,” he said, per a video shared online.

A video also surfaced of Drake and his longtime friend Chubbs apparently mean-mugging DeRozan as he played basketball.

After the game ended, reporters asked DeRozan about Drake’s banner comments, to which he replied: “He’s going to have a long way to climb to take it down. Tell him good luck.”

It’s unclear what Drake’s beef is with DeRozan but fans believe it is connected to the athlete’s close relationship with Kendrick Lamar.

When the “Humble” rapper, 37, dropped his No. 1 Drake diss song, “Not Like Us,” in May, he name-dropped DeRozan in a verse.

“I’m glad DeRoz’ came home, y’all didn’t deserve him neither,” he rapped, referring to DeRozan, who previously played for the Raptors.

The small forward also made a brief appearance in Lamar’s music video for “Not Like Us,” a song in which the Compton rapper accused Drake of liking underage girls.

Then in June, DeRozan was one of several athletes who took the stage with Lamar when he performed the hit five consecutive times during his star-studded Juneteenth concert.

What do you think? Post a comment.

The following month, DeRozan said he still considered the “Degrassi” alum a friend despite his minor role in the rap beef.

“Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed,” he told the Sacramento Bee.

“It’s so easy to get overlooked and look at it for what it looks like, but at the end of the day, it’s music, entertainment.”
