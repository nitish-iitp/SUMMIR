NBA fans reacted to Drake dissing DeMar DeRozan during the broadcast of the Toronto Raptors game against the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night. The rapper was not happy when it was insinuated that the Raptors are likely retiring DeRozan's jersey once he retires from the NBA.

Speaking during the fourth quarter of the Raptors' 131-128 overtime win over the Kings, Drake warned the franchise to not retire DeRozan's No. 10 jersey. He even claimed that he would personally take it down if it happened down the line.

"If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I'll go up there and pull it down myself," Drake said.

Drake and DeMar DeRozan were very tight since the latter was with the Toronto Raptors for nine seasons before he got traded to the San Antonio Spurs in 2018. DeRozan is among the greatest players in Raptors history, so he'll likely join Vince Carter in the Scotiabank Arena's rafters once he retires.

NBA fans thought that the Toronto-based rapper was being "salty" for making his comments about DeRozan. Their relationship seemingly suffered after "Deebo" appeared on Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" video. Drake arguably lost his beef with Kendrick due to the song's popularity.

"Drake is so salty," a fan wrote.
"Still salty about Kendrick lmaooo," one fan claimed.
"He's still insecure demar mess with Kendrick," another fan remarked.

Despite their friendship over the years, DeMar DeRozan stood his ground and went with his fellow Compton native. DeRozan also appeared on Kendrick Lamar's "The Pop Out: Ken & Friends" concert back in June, dancing with West Coast rappers, as well as fellow NBA player Russell Westbrook.

"That's some serious loyalty! Can't wait to see how this rivalry unfolds!" a fan responded.
"He's so pissed he sided with kendrick," one fan commented.
"Why is the NBA still associating with this guy?" another fan asked.

In addition to DeRozan, Drake also unfollowed LA Lakers superstar LeBron James on Instagram. James was at "The Pop Out: Ken & Friends" concert, though he didn't come on stage to dance with Kendrick Lamar.

Speaking to reporters after the game, DeMar DeRozan was asked about Drake's comments during the broadcast. DeRozan understood the assignment and had a witty reply to the Toronto Raptors ambassador.

"Well, he's going to have a long way to climb to take it down," DeRozan said. "Tell him good luck."

Saturday's contest was the first Raptors game Drake attended this season and his first since Kendrick Lamar dropped "Not Like Us." Other former Raptors players were in attendance to watch Vince Carter get his iconic No. 15 jersey retired.

Some names the franchise could honor next include Chris Bosh, Kawhi Leonard, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. Bosh has been retired since 2016, while the other three are still active in the NBA.
