The Chicago Bulls return home on Wednesday night to take on the Minnesota Timberwolves in NBA preseason action.

The Chicago Bulls host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night looking to snap a two-game losing streak. The Bulls won their first preseason game over the Cleveland Cavaliers, but have lost their last two against the Memphis Grizzlies and Milwaukee Bucks by a combined seven points. Monday night they led the Bucks by nine points at halftime, but scored just 15 points in the third quarter and were outscored by 17 points. It was too much for them to overcome and they fell to 1-2 in the preseason. The Bulls were balanced in the loss as six players scored in double figures and they were led by Adama Sanogo, who scored a team-high 16 points. Josh Giddey, who the Bulls got from a trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder, shot 3-for-4 from downtown and scored 12 points.

The Timberwolves will be playing their fourth game away from home, as they have played at the Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers and played the Philadelphia 76ers at a neutral site. They will finally play a home game on Thursday when they wrap up their preseason schedule with a game against the Denver Nuggets.
