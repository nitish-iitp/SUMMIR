The Denver Nuggets fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder in an NBA preseason game on Tuesday night. The loss dropped Denver to 0-4 on the preseason.

Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, and Russell Westbrook all missed the game for the Nuggets. Oklahoma City played their usual starters, and were led by All-NBA guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who finished with a game-high 19 points.

Gilgeous-Alexander has emerged into the next great Thunder star. The franchise has had some all-time great players, most notably the duo of Westbrook and Kevin Durant.

Westbrook is the greatest player in Thunder history, and has been supportive of Gilgeous-Alexander as he attempts to lead the franchise. The two guards shared a moment after Wednesday’s game.

Gilgeous-Alexander spoke highly of Westbrook when asked about him last season.

“He’s one of the best competitors to ever play the game," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "... A really good guy off the court. That’s a guy I’m cool with, we’re friends, he’s just a really good guy.”

I asked Shai Gilgeous-Alexander about Russell Westbrook.
