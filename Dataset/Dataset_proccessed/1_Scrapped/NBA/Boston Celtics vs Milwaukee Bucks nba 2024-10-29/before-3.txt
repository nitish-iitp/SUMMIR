Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best picks on Tuesday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Nikola Jokić (DEN, C)	$21,120	67.8	3.2
Value	Stephon Castle (SAS, PG)	$6,000	26.7	4.5
Fade	Ja Morant (MEM, PG)	$17,890	36.6	2
Cheapie	Toumani Camara (POR, PF/SF)	$6,000	26	4.3

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K

Conclusion

When building your NBA Tuesday teams, consider starting with a value player like Stephon Castle. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Nikola Jokić is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Toumani Camara.

On the other hand, according to our model, Ja Morant is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
