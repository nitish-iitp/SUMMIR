MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
NBA L2M: Julius Randle Traveled Before Game-Winning Shot for Wolves vs. Booker, Suns

Sunday's game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Phoenix Suns should have gone to overtime.

While Julius Randle won the game for the Timberwolves with a buzzer-beating three-pointer, the NBA announced in Monday's last-two minute report that he traveled before the shot. The Suns may take solace in knowing there was a mistake, but Minnesota still won the game 120-117 and avoided overtime because of the shot.

Step-back... falling away... GAME. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TissotBuzzerBeater?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TissotBuzzerBeater</a> <a href="https://t.co/djoEUmDll2">https://t.co/djoEUmDll2</a> <a href="https://t.co/Qr9FmDNMhc">pic.twitter.com/Qr9FmDNMhc</a>

In the moment, there was more focus on a potential offensive foul than a travel violation as Randle appeared to push off on Josh Okogie. However, the NBA said in the last-two minute report the officials made the correct decision to not blow their whistle.

"Randle (MIN) places his off-arm against Okogie (PHX) and releases from contact as he steps back into his shot attempt," it said. "Okogie is not dislodged from his defensive position as a result of illegal contact from Randle."

Monday's report does nothing to change the final result, and the Timberwolves have now won two in a row following a three-game losing streak.

Randle was excellent and finished with 35 points, seven assists and four rebounds behind 11-of-20 shooting from the field and 5-of-11 shooting from deep. The game-winner was his first headline moment for the Timberwolves after they acquired him from the New York Knicks in the trade that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to the Big Apple.

It was also his third straight game with at least 20 points, and he appears to be settling into his role with a new team.

That is welcome news for Minnesota, which needs him to be an offensive force when opposing defenses are focused on slowing down Anthony Edwards. If Randle can do that, the Timberwolves will be better suited to replicate Towns' lost production in the daunting Western Conference.

As for the Suns, they have now lost three in a row following a quick 9-2 start.

There was surely more frustration than usual following the controversial loss given the recent struggles, but they have the opportunity to quickly bounce back in Monday's home game against the Orlando Magic.
