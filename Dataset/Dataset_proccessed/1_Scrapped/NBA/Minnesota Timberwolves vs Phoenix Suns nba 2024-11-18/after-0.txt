A balsamic and praiseworthy triumph for Minnesota Timberwolves at home against the Phoenix Suns, in a memorable game featuring Devin Booker scoring 44 points, which was not enough for the Arizona team to secure the victory. Everything was decided by small details, and the hero turned out to be Julius Randle, not only due to his great performance with 35 points, 7 assists, and 4 rebounds but also because of the buzzer-beater shot that granted the win to his team.
