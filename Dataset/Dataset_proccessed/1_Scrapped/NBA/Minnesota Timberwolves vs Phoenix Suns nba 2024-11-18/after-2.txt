Duane Rankin: #NBA Last Two-Minute Report on Wolves forward Julius Randle’s 3 at buzzer to stun Phoenix Suns, 120-117, Sunday. Randle not getting called for traveling was “incorrect non-call.” Randle not getting called for offensive foul on Josh Okogie on winning 3 “correct non-call.” #Suns

No offensive foul, but T-Wolves’ Julius Randle traveled before hitting 3 to stun Phoenix Suns (w/videos) #Suns azcentral.com/story/sports/n… via @azcentral – 7:24 PM

Fun stuff on the NBA’s Last 2 Minutes report. Says Julius Randle’s push-off on Josh Okogie was a correct no-call, but also that there was a missed travel on the final play by Randle.
So the Suns still got screwed on the last possession pic.x.com/rvBd5Jm9zq – 5:15 PM

How Devin Booker’s response 44-piece wasn’t enough as Phoenix Suns fall to Minnesota Timberwolves on Julius Randle 3 at the buzzer. #Suns
azcentral.com/story/sports/n… – 8:58 PM
Gerald Bourguet @GeraldBourguet
End of 3Q: PHX 90, MIN 86
Booker: 37 Pts, 5 Ast, 12-21 FG, 5-10 3P
Allen: 9 Pts, 3-5 FG
Jones: 7 Pts, 8 Ast, 3 Stl, 3-8 FG
Randle: 28 Pts, 7 Ast, 9-16 FG, 4-9 3P
Suns executed well out of Booker doubles, but left a few wide-open 3s on the table. Ant heating up is less than ideal – 5:19 PM
Kellan Olson @KellanOlson
Suns have definitively been the better team so far but Randle and Edwards both got hot in the 3rd to make this a game. – 5:18 PM
Duane Rankin @DuaneRankin
Randle 3. Suns lead down to six. #Suns – 5:06 PM
Gerald Bourguet @GeraldBourguet
Halftime: PHX 64, MIN 54
Booker: 27 Pts, 5 Ast, 9-14 FG, 4-7 3P
Allen: 9 Pts, 3-5 FG
Ighodaro: 6 Pts, 3-4 FG
Randle: 18 Pts, 3 Ast, 6-9 FG
Incredible put-back dunk from Josh Okogie, but Julius Randle drills a 3 at the buzzer to make it a 10-point game. Rude shot. – 4:40 PM
Duane Rankin @DuaneRankin
Okogie one-handed follow dunk. Has six off the bench.
Randle running 3 at buzzer to end half.
Suns up 10. Booker 27 points on 9-of-14 shooting (4-of-7 on 3s) #Suns – 4:40 PM
Gerald Bourguet @GeraldBourguet
The Timberwolves’ former Knicks are killing the Suns so far. Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo have 25 of Minnesota’s 38 points and the Wolves are on a 16-4 run – 4:23 PM
Gerald Bourguet @GeraldBourguet
End of 1Q: PHX 31, MIN 22
Booker: 17 Pts, 3 Ast, 5-8 FG, 3-4 3P
Morris: 5 Pts, 2-2 FG
Ighodaro: 4 Pts, 2-2 FG
Randle: 9 Pts, 2 Ast, 3-6 FG – 4:10 PM
Kellan Olson @KellanOlson
Minnesota is all over the place with this. Trapped Jones to leave Booker open and Randle off the ball defending the second big is treating them like a traditional wing. – 3:55 PM
Duane Rankin @DuaneRankin
Booker screen, open 3 as McDaniels helped on trap.
Suns up 15-7.
Booker step back 3 in transition, Booker stayed on floor for minute grabbing at right ankle.
Play under review as he landed on Randle’s foot. Got up and walked to the bench. #Suns – 3:53 PM
Gerald Bourguet @GeraldBourguet
You’ve gotta be kidding. Devin Booker lands on Julius Randle’s foot on a pull-up 3 and is wincing getting up. He has 8 points in the first 5 minutes and will be heading to the FT line for 3 more. Hopefully he’s all right – 3:53 PM
More on this storyline

Jorge Sierra: Julius Randle passed Marc Gasol in scoring yesterday and is now No. 252 on the all-time list. Randle is only 29 and played just 14 minutes in his rookie season. He’s a walking bucket. -via Twitter @hoopshype / November 18, 2024
Julius Randle decided the NBA Sundays affair with a buzzer-beating three-pointer to highlight a 35-point display. “That’s amazing for him. He works really hard. We trust him in those moments,” said Gobert, “We know he is capable of making tough and clutch shots. He’s done it in his whole career. Just another weapon for us.” -via EuroHoops.net / November 18, 2024
Jon Krawczynski: Julius Randle says his 3-year-old boy hates coming to games because it’s too loud. But he was there tonight, and his dad made that building shake. Was cool to see Julius talk about how happy he was that both of his boys were there to see it. -via x.com / November 18, 2024
