Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best choices on Monday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Anthony Edwards (MIN, SG)	$18,600	46.3	2.5
Value	Jusuf Nurkić (PHX, C)	$11,360	35	3.1
Fade	Tyler Herro (MIA, SG)	$17,940	36.3	2
Cheapie	Nikola Jović (MIA, PF)	$6,980	20.7	3

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Early Monday teams, consider starting with a value player like Jusuf Nurkić. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Anthony Edwards is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Nikola Jović.

On the other hand, according to our model, Tyler Herro is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building multiple line-ups.
