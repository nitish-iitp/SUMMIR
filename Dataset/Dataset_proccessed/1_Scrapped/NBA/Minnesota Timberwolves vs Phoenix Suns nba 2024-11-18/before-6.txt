The Phoenix Suns will battle against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday in one of 10 NBA regular-season games scheduled for the day. The Suns enter the matchup on a two-game losing streak, most recently falling 99-83 to the OKC Thunder in an NBA Cup game on Friday.

Despite the recent setbacks, Mike Budenholzer’s team remains in a strong position, sitting fifth in the Western Conference standings with a 9-4 record. However, the Suns are dealing with several injury concerns heading into the game. Two key players have already been ruled out, while the availability of others remains uncertain.
