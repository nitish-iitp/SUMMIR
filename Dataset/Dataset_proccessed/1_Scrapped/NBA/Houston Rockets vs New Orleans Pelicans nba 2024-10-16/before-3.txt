ACC play continues Wednesday night for newcomers Stanford and SMU as the teams meet in women’s volleyball action.

On Wednesday night, No. 5 Stanford will hit the road for an away game against No. 12 SMU in a highly anticipated Top 25 matchup in Dallas. The Mustangs are coming off of a massive upset over No. 1 Pitt, putting a stop to the Panthers’ perfect season in five sets. The team is now 13-2 overall with an ACC record of 5-1 for a spot in second place in the standings along with Stanford and UNC. Naya Shime led the team with a season-high 20 kills and Maya Tabron added 11 kills to go along with a team-high 10 digs for her fifth double-double in the win. Brooke Frazier assisted on defense, adding a season-best nine digs to the stat sheet. SMU has now won against two top five ranked teams and notched its fourth ranked win of the season against the Panthers.
