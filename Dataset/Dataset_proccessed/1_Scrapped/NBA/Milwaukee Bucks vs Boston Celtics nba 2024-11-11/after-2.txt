BREAKING NEWS Massachusetts Macy’s store shutting down amid nationwide closures: ‘We are closing underproductive Macy’s stores’ January 9, 2025 at 7:15 pm

‘Giannis is a child’: Jaylen Brown calls out Bucks star for handshake taunt

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s middle-school handshake fake-out didn’t sit well with Jaylen Brown.

After dropping Brown with an elbow that drew an offensive foul during Sunday night’s Celtics-Bucks game, Antetokounmpo extended his hand toward Brown, only to pull it back when the Boston star went to shake it.

Antetokounmpo smiled. Brown did not.

“Giannis is a child,” Brown told reporters after the game, which the Celtics went on to win 113-107 at Fiserv Forum. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”

Later in the game, Brown was called for a Flagrant 1 foul when he shoved Antetokounmpo while the latter was driving to the basket.

Brown played 37 minutes after missing the previous four games with a hip flexor strain, finishing with 14 points on 4-of-13 shooting, five rebounds and four assists.

Antetokounmpo, who scored a game-high 43, also was part of another controversial play involving Jayson Tatum. He placed his foot underneath Tatum on a 3-point attempt, causing the Celtics star to land on it and turn his ankle. Tatum remained in the game, but he and Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla both were frustrated that no foul was called, which Mazzulla said was “ridiculous.”

The teams will have a chance to settle any lingering scores when the Bucks visit TD Garden for the second time this season on Dec. 6.
