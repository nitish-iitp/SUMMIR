Bronny James stats tonight: How did Lakers rookie fare vs Suns in LeBron James' absence? (Source: Imagn)

Bronny James continued to find time in the LA Lakers rotation during the preseason, playing in his fifth consecutive game on Thursday against the Phoenix Suns. It was an eventful night for LeBron James' son, who got to share the floor with Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal in the fourth quarter.

Bronny drew a foul against Durant on a dunk attempt, while he got called for one after nearly blocking Beal on a layup attempt from behind. The Lakers rookie also got called for his first NBA flagrant foul after contact with Suns rookie Jalen Bridges, who fell flat on his back after Bronny inadvertently body-checked him.

It was also the first overtime game Bronny was a part of after fellow rookie Dalton Knecht tied things up at 111-111 with four seconds left.

Bronny James had four points, two rebounds and two fouls, including one flagrant while shooting 2 of 4 from the field in 17 minutes. He played the entire fourth quarter and overtime and was a +17 for the Lakers. Bronny didn't attempt a 3-pointer in this game.

LeBron James coaches Bronny James

LeBron James took his day off as a chance to coach Bronny James on the sidelines. He didn't get a chance to do that the past few games, as he was in the lineup and active. James was frequently in Bronny's ear before the rookie stepped on the floor. He also gave him suggestions after Bronny struggled on offense on a few possessions.

It is one of the key benefits Bronny was always going to have after playing on the same team as his father. He certainly could use most of it amid this rough stretch in preseason, where he has struggled heavily to deliver.

In five games, Bronny James has managed only 1.6 points on 20.0% shooting. He's yet to make a 3. The 20-year-old hasn't looked like an NBA-ready prospect, but that was expected.

He was coming off a short freshman college season after suffering a cardiac arrest in August before his NCAA debut. That health scare has added many roadblocks in his progression since.

Nevertheless, Bronny has secured an NBA spot for the foreseeable future and will have to go through the developmental stages to prepare himself for a sustainable career.
