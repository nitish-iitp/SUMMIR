Golden State Warriors superstar Steph Curry had a candid reaction after Lindy Waters III hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to secure a thrilling 91-90 win over the LA Clippers in their preseason opener at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Saturday.

With just 1.6 seconds left on the clock, the Warriors trailed the Clippers 90-88, giving them just enough time to set up a catch-and-shoot opportunity. Coach Steve Kerr designed an excellent play, with the ball being inbound to Lindy Waters on the right wing.

Waters caught the ball, turned, and elevated in one fluid motion, getting off a clean shot. The former OKC Thunder guard made no mistake, sinking the shot with perfect precision. The game-winner ignited jubilant celebrations from the Warriors players.

The four-time NBA champion started alongside Jonathan Kuminga, Draymond Green, Trayce Jackson-Davis and De'Anthony Melton.

Curry played just under 14 minutes, scoring nine points, but it wasn’t one of his signature shooting performances. The two-time MVP struggled from the field, shooting 2-of-8, including 0-of-4 from beyond the arc. He also recorded two assists and had three turnovers.

Curry and the Warriors will return to action on Oct. 9, when they face the Sacramento Kings at the Golden 1 Center. The Warriors have five more preseason games lined up: two against the Kings, two against the Los Angeles Lakers, and one against the Detroit Pistons.
