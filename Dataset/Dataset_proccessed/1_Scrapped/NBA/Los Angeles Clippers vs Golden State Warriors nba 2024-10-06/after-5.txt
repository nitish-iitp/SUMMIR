Golden State Warriors vs LA Clippers: Game Summary

The Clippers came out firing behind Harden and Ivica Zubac before Curry and Jonathan Kuminga led the Warriors' response. It didn't take long for Steve Kerr, though, to take out his starters. After seven minutes, the bench mob was already in.

Clippers coach Ty Lue didn't relieve his entire starting unit, allowing Zubac, Harden and Norman Powell to stay. LA was better at executing the offense behind "The Beard" and the big Croatian. The Clippers led 26-23 after one quarter.

Lue's starting five to open the second quarter looked interesting. He had Kai Jones, a power forward, and four guards, Bones Hyland, Tre Mann, Kevin Porter Jr. and Kobe Brown. The quintet had six turnovers before the halfway point of the second period.

Steph Curry, Draymond Green, De'Anthony Melton and Jonathan Kuminga returned in the second quarter to lead the Warriors again. Kyle Anderson and Buddy Hield made their debuts for the Bay Area team.

The Golden State Warriors built a decent second-quarter lead before the LA Clippers bounced back. Curry and Co. headed into the halftime break with a 53-49 advantage.
