The rest of the starters combined for 36 points led by Nikola Jokic (14 points and eight rebounds) and Michael Porter Jr. (12 points on 1-3 shooting from three).

This was also the introduction of Russell Westbrook leading the bench unit. He finished the game with 12 points, eight assists and four rebounds while shooting 3-6 from three. Westbrook gives Denver a dimension that the team has not had in the Jokic era with his pace and playmaking.
