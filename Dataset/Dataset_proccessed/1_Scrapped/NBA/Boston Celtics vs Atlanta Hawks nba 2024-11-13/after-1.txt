#1 - Even in a loss, Celtics Basketball is still beautiful

Before diving into the reasons behind the Celtics’ loss to the Atlanta Hawks, let’s acknowledge the beauty of Celtics basketball, even in defeat on a green court. When the ball moves well and defense creates offense, Celtics basketball is at its best. Exhibit A: this fast break late in the first half.

Celtics basketball also shines through strategic play-calling and smart coaching. In one sideline out-of-bounds play, the Celtics baited the Hawks into thinking the ball would go straight to Jayson Tatum in the post. However, the Celtics set stagger screens for Holiday, who ran toward the ball and acted as the connector between Jaylen Brown on the sideline and Jayson Tatum at the post. Jayson anticipated this and cut into an empty paint.

Consider also this sequence: Jayson Tatum blocks Larry Nance Jr., igniting a fast break, then Jrue Holiday drives and delivers a no-look pass to the corner for Jaylen Brown. Defense leading to offense—that’s Celtics basketball.

To cap it off, let’s appreciate this ball movement and Jayson Tatum’s improvement as a passer.

#2 - The Celtics struggled to take care of the ball

So far this season, the Celtics have been excellent at protecting the ball. Only once (before last night) did they lose the ball on more than 15% of their possessions. That was the second night of a back-to-back against Charlotte, and they got a pass for it.

However, last night, the turnover rate climbed to 20%. One key disruptor was Dyson Daniels, whose activity and length gave the Celtics’ offense more trouble than we’ve seen in a while. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown combined for 11 turnovers.

Daniels wasn’t the only factor in the turnover issue. The length of Jalen Johnson, Zaccharie Risacher, and Onyeka Okongwu made the entire Celtics offense uncomfortable. Another problem for the Celtics was that they didn’t have a clear target to exploit, no seal to hunt.

#3 - No seal hunting

With Trae Young sidelined, many expected concerns about the Hawks’ offense. However, the Celtics’ offense also seemed to be impacted by his absence. Without Young in the game, the Celtics had no clear mismatch to exploit.

Keaton Wallace, a Hawks two-way player, took Young’s place at point guard, and his length and strength made him a tough matchup. The Hawks were able to switch everything, neutralizing much of the Celtics’ usual offense. While Jaylen and Jayson could still attack some Hawks players, it wasn’t as fruitful as usual.

#4 - Jaylen Brown’s scoring performance

The loss and his missed last shot may overshadow this, but make no mistake: Jaylen Brown’s scoring was stellar. He was one of the few Celtics able to get to the rim, scoring five baskets in the paint. Plus, his ability to draw fouls has improved since last season, making him more efficient and more dangerous.

As always, his tough shot-making makes him hard to guard, and he has also improved in the post. Last season, the Celtics increased their post-up volume around Tatum and Kristaps Porzingis. This season, Jaylen is following suit, contributing more to the Celtics’ offense through the post.

Overall, it was a great game from Jaylen Brown, who seems to be back in form after missing a couple of games.

#5 - Derrick White’s elite shooting night

Whenever Derrick White has a shooting night like this, it’s remarkable. I remember back in 2022 when his shooting struggles were part of the Celtics’ spacing issues against the Warriors in the Finals.

Last night, his shooting helped keep the Celtics in the game. With Tatum unable to drive to the rim as much as he wanted, White was always well-positioned to offer him a kick-out option.

So far this season, White has made 50% of his catch-and-shoot threes on over five attempts per game. That’s Steph Curry territory. His percentage will likely drop, but his growth from being ignored on the perimeter to one of the league’s best from three is amazing.

#6 - Celtics lost despite shooting 40% from deep

Often, when the Celtics lose, it’s said they couldn’t keep up with their usual three-point percentage. But that wasn’t the case last night.

Against the Hawks, the Celtics made 40% of their threes, with an eFG% of 63%, one of the highest across the NBA this season. They were efficient at the rim too, making 82% of their shots within four feet, and they drew a lot of free throws with a 27% FTRate, well above last season’s average.

These numbers suggest the Celtics should have dominated offensively, so why was the result so average? As noted, turnovers were a major problem. Another issue was rebounding.

#7 - The Celtics were outrebounded

Joe Mazzulla often talks about shot margin, aiming to ensure the Celtics have more shot opportunities than their opponents. Last night, that wasn’t the case. The Celtics were dominated on the boards, with the Hawks grabbing rebounds on 45% of their missed shots. To put it simply, the Hawks got second chances half the time they missed a shot.

This rebounding disparity created defensive issues and limited the Celtics’ transition opportunities. The Celtics played 88% of their possessions in the half-court, while the Hawks played only 75% in half-court sets, giving them more easy scoring chances. Fittingly, the Hawks’ game-winning basket came off an offensive rebound.

#8 - Hawks big men dominated

Beyond rebounding, the Hawks’ big men dominated overall. Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu, and Larry Nance Jr. combined for 22 field goals on 32 attempts, generating 52 points and grabbing 17 rebounds.

None of these three are known for offensive dominance. Capela is no longer the rim-runner he once was, while Okongwu and Nance operate more as short-roll and high-post connectors. But last night, they attacked smaller players and took advantage of Porzingis’s absence.

Larry Nance Jr., in particular, had an unexpected shooting performance reminiscent of Klay Thompson. The Hawks’ big men were effective due to great coaching and some good fortune.

#9 - Celtics’ defense couldn’t contain Dyson Daniels

Another surprise was Dyson Daniels. Traded from New Orleans this summer, the 21-year-old stepped up in a game where the Hawks’ offensive star was missing. Defensively, he made life hard for the Celtics’ stars.

His defensive prowess wasn’t a surprise, as he’s excelled in creating turnovers and fast breaks since joining Atlanta. But his offensive contribution was unexpected. Alongside Jalen Johnson, the two young players tallied 17 assists, helping generate the Hawks’ offense.

Daniels used his length and speed to drive against Al Horford and other defenders. This game could provide valuable insights into how aggressive, lengthy wings can challenge the Celtics’ defense.

#10 - Celtics’ new green court is still awful, especially at 6:00 AM

As I live in Europe, I wake up early to watch and write about the game before starting my day. Watching a game on a green court so early isn’t something I’d wish on anyone.
