Following Saturday's 16-13 win against the Wisconsin Badgers, quarterback Dillon Gabriel and fiancee Zo Caswell went to attend an Atlanta Hawks game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. They were early to arrive at Moda Center, catching Hawks players in pregame warmups.

They met the Hawks' star guard, Trae Young. In the video Caswell posted, Gabriel asked Young to make the shot while sitting on the sidelines. The Hawks guard missed the shot twice, eliciting a funny reaction from Caswell, who wrote:

"Lol."

The All-Star guard led his team with 29 points, five rebounds and eight assists. However, the Sheadon Sharpe-led Trail Blazers edged out the Hawks to win the game 114-110.
