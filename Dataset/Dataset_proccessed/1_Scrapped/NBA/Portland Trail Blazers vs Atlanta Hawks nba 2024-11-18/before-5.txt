Greetings from North and Southwest Portland. After recording the last podcast at one of the low points of the last few seasons, we got to bounce back with some fun Trail Blazers talk on the latest edition of The Blazers Balcony, presented by Spirit Mountain Casino, which you can listen/subscribe to below...

Topics on this, the 135th episode, include...

• The Trail Blazers rattling off three-straight wins after looking left for dead a little over a week ago

• Shaedon Sharpe scoring 30+ in consecutive games and his popularity amongst various fanbases

• Donovan Clingan's historic performance in the victory versus the Timberwolves

• The spectacular play of Robert Williams III, Deni Avdija, Dalano Banton, Kris Murray and Rayan Rupert off the bench

• Lamar Hurd barking at Toumani Camara

• Is this the real Dalano Banton

• The upcoming road trip with stops in Oklahoma City, Houston (x2), Memphis and Indiana

• Brooke cutting the line, the Brightside trading card kiosk, "DB Hooper" and fan-created merch, getting the kids back in the building, En Vogue playing at Spirit Mountain Casino in mid-December, old music videos, Mercer Island vs. Shadle Park and get us to Las Vegas for the NBA Cup
