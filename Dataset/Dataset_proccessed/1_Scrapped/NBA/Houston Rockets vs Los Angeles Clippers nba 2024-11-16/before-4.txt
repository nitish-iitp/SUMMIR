Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best picks on Saturday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Victor Wembanyama (SAS, C)	$22,120	62	2.8
Value	Corey Kispert (WAS, SG/SF)	$7,530	26.6	3.5
Fade	Jake LaRavia (MEM, PF)	$10,010	9.4	0.9
Cheapie	Steven Adams (HOU, C)	$6,050	19.4	3.2

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your NBA Saturday teams, consider starting with a value player like Corey Kispert. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Victor Wembanyama is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Steven Adams.

On the other hand, according to our model, Jake LaRavia is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if entering multiple line-ups.
