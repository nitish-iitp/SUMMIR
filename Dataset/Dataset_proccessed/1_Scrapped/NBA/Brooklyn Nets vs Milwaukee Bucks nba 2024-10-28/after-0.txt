Takeaways

Bucks: Milwaukee can’t be fully evaluated until Khris Middleton is back from ankle surgery. Coach Doc Rivers said the longtime starter is getting closer and could take another step with a good practice this week. But he won’t solve the perimeter defense problems for a team that gave up 35 points to Chicago’s Coby White on Friday before getting burned by Thomas and Schroder on Sunday.

Nets: Thomas has the green light and can get on hot streaks and Schroder is a feisty competitor, and even a team without a ton of talent in a rebuilding season can be tough when both have it going.
