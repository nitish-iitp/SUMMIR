10/28 Game Preview: Bucks at Celtics

The Boston Celtics will attempt to remain unbeaten when they meet the visiting Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night.

Strong starts have carried Boston to a 3-0 record this season.

The Celtics have scored 118 points in the first quarter of their three games, including 42 in a 124-118 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday. That number puts the team ahead of the 1991-92 Golden State Warriors (114 points) and 2013-14 Minnesota Timberwolves (112 points) for most points scored in the first quarter in the first three games of the NBA regular season.

Boston's 42-point first quarter almost wasn't enough against the Pistons, who erased a 23-point first-half deficit and used an 18-3 run to take an 88-86 late in the third quarter. The Celtics shot 35.9 percent from the floor in the second half, when they were held to 51 points.

Boston trailed by six points with 5:12 to play, but closed the game on an 18-6 run.

"I thought their physicality dictated the pace of the second half on both ends," Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said. "They were more physical on their offense, running their stuff harder, running it faster, putting us in difficult spots, creating separation. And I thought on the defensive end they took away our rhythm because of their physicality. So, credit to them."

Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 37 points in the victory.

"It's not always going to be a blowout," Boston guard Derrick White said. "Understand that there are going to be so many different ways we can win games, and so many different people are going to have to step up for us. Each game is different. Each game is a learning opportunity so we're going to learn from this game. I think it's good for us to be challenged. It's good for us to stick together in moments like that and just find ways to win."

Milwaukee is coming off a 115-102 loss at Brooklyn on Sunday. The Bucks were within five points through three quarters, but were outscored 32-24 in the fourth. The Bucks trailed 89-85 early in the fourth, but the Nets scored the next 10 points to take a 99-85 lead with 7:04 to play.

Milwaukee has lost two in a row since opening the season with a victory over Philadelphia.

"We have to do something to free guys up better offensively," Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. "We're forced into taking a lot of tough shots, the ball's not moving and we don't have enough space. Our execution was poor. That's all on me. I gotta figure it out.

"The last two games have been very disappointing. It's the third game still. You still gotta keep fighting, but these are games you should win."

Giannis Antetokounmpo was 7 of 11 from the field and led Milwaukee with 22 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. Antetokounmpo has made 30 of his 45 field goal attempts this season.

Damian Lillard added 21 points for Milwaukee, but was 1 of 7 from 3-point territory. Bobby Portis came off the bench to collect 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Bucks committed 18 turnovers in the loss.
