Jeff’s King of the Court Pick for Friday, November 1: Jayson Tatum

Jayson Tatum dominates the Hornets.

There is something about this matchup that unlocks a different level in his game. In six games over the last two seasons, Tatum has averaged a whopping 38.3 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.7 assists against Charlotte, and those numbers are diluted a bit due to one 25-point outing. In three of those last four meetings, Boston’s superstar has dropped at least 41 points.

Tatum entered the year with a much-improved jumper and an aggressive mindset, and it’s resulted in him averaging what would be a career-high 30.2 points through five games. That should carry over into tonight’s contest as he looks to pick up where he left off against the Hornets.
