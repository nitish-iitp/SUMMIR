With preseason in the rearview, the Sacramento Kings have begun trimming its training camp roster.

According to HoopsHype’s Michael Scotto, the Kings have waived rookie guard Boogie Ellis following Thursday’s preseason finale in Los Angeles.

In his 2023-24 season at USC, Boogie Ellis averaged 16.5 points, three assists, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.4 steals in 33.5 minutes per game over 29 games.

During Summer League action with the Kings in Las Vegas, Ellis averaged 11.2 points on 51.3 percent from the field and 54.5 percent from three in their limited sample size, averaging 17.3 minutes over five games.

It was a numbers game for Ellis, who was one of eight guards on the Kings’ training camp roster vying for one of the 15 regular season roster spots.

With Sacramento’s two-way spots all occupied, Ellis will likely latch on with another organization thanks to his impressive three-point shooting (38% in preseason) and potential as a volume scorer.

As for the Kings, they will continue trimming down the roster in the coming days ahead of next Thursday’s season-opener at Golden 1 Center.
