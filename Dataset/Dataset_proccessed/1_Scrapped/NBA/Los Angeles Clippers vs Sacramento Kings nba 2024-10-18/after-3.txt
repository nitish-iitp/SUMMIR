The Sacramento Kings have trimmed its roster ahead of next week’s regular-season-opener.

Following the news that rookie guard Boogie Ellis had been waived, FOX 40’s Sean Cunningham reports that forward Terry Taylor and guard Brodric Thomas have also been waived by Sacramento.

After waiving Ellis, Taylor, and Thomas, the Kings have one open roster spot heading into the regular season, giving general manager Monte McNair some flexibility if he makes another surprising move.

McNair and Sacramento already turned some heads this week by signing longtime sharpshooter Doug McDermott to a one-year deal.
