Hawks hurting on defense ahead of tilt with Kings

Two teams trending in different directions will square off in Atlanta on Friday, when the Hawks host the Sacramento Kings.

Atlanta won its first two games to start the year, but a slew of early-season injuries has decimated the Hawks, who have dropped three in a row.

A season ago, the team allowed 120.5 points per game, tied for second-most in the NBA. Similar defensive issues have reappeared five games into this season, as Atlanta has surrendered 123.6 points per contest, third to the Wizards and Raptors (124).

The injury bug certainly hasn’t helped the cause, as key defenders Dyson Daniels and De’Andre Hunter have combined to miss four games. Daniels, whom the Hawks received from New Orleans in a trade for Dejounte Murray in the offseason, is second in the NBA with 2.8 steals per game.

Although Hunter (knee) and Daniels (hip) aren’t expected to miss extended time, the news wasn’t as fortunate for another pair of Atlanta contributors. Bogdan Bogdanovic, who scored a career-high 16.9 points per game last season, underwent a non-surgical procedure on his hamstring and will be re-evaluated in four weeks. The team also announced its 2023 first-round pick Kobe Bufkin will also be re-evaluated in four weeks due to a shoulder subluxation.

The injuries have reared their head for Atlanta, which fell to Washington 133-120 Wednesday, its second loss to the Wizards in as many games. The Hawks held an eight-point halftime lead, but allowed Washington to score 76 second-half points in the defeat.

“What we need to be mindful of are the things that we have more control over, like getting back on defense,” Hawks coach Quin Snyder said. “Those are consistent themes for us that we care about and we’re working on. When (Washington) made runs, us not getting stops and not converting the other way, that’s a collective thing.”

Atlanta is led in scoring by Trae Young’s 28.2 points per game, followed by Hunter’s 18. Atlanta is led in scoring by Trae Young’s 28.2 points per game, followed by Hunter’s 18. Hunter and Daniels have been ruled out for Friday’s game.

Sacramento enters the game winners of two straight following an 0-2 start. It’s been a three-headed attack for the Kings’ offense, as Domantas Sabonis leads the team with 24.3 points per game, followed by DeMar DeRozan’s 23 and De’Aaron Fox’s 21.5.

The Kings are coming off a 113-96 road victory over the Utah Jazz, in which Sabonis recorded 28 points and 11 rebounds with an efficient 13-for-18 shooting mark from the field.

“(Domantas) is just a monster in there,” Kings head coach Mike Brown said. “He wears his hard hat every single game and he was fantastic (against Utah).”

Brown admits that the group looked out of whack following an 0-5 preseason rut that extended into the first two games of the year. For a Sacramento team that wants to string together three straight winning seasons for the first time in 19 years, Brown’s expectations are as high as ever.

“We were all in a little bit of a funk in the preseason, and I’ll take most of the blame for that,” Brown said. “I put these guys in a box, because I needed to see what we had and we still have a ways to go. The neat part about this is we figured out how to win our last two, and our ceiling is still high. We have a lot of room to grow on both sides of the floor.”

Brown and Sacramento swept the two-game season series with Atlanta last year.
