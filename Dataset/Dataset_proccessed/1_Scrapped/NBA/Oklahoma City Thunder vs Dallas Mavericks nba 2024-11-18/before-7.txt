The Dallas Mavericks survived a thrilling road encounter against the OKC Thunder on Sunday. Lu Dort's potential game-winning 3-pointer failed to connect, allowing the Luka Doncic-less Mavs to escape with a 121-119 victory. Dallas got a boost across the roster to make up for Doncic's absence.

The Thunder, playing without Chet Holmgren, Alex Caruso, Isaiah Hartenstein and Jaylin Williams nearly pulled off the win. Oklahoma's undersized frontline battled but it gave up too many possessions. The hosts were outrebounded 53-29, including 18-7 in the offensive glass.

OKC trailed by 14 points and rallied in the second half but fell short. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished the game with 36 points, eight assists, five rebounds, two blocks and two steals. Jalen Williams tallied 27 points, five rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block.
