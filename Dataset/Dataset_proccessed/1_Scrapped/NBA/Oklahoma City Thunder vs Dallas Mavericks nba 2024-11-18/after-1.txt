The Oklahoma City Thunder continue to struggle against the Dallas Mavericks. In their first matchup of the season, they suffered a close 121-119 loss.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had an efficient 36 points and Jalen Williams had an efficient 27 points. Lu Dort scored 18 points. The rest of the team struggled. The lack of centers was exposed in this loss for OKC.

Meanwhile, the Mavericks survived Luka Doncic's absence. PJ Washington continues to dominate OKC. He scored a season-high 27 points and grabbed 17 rebounds. Kyrie Irving had 23 points and six assists.

Let's look at some of the best photos from the Thunder's two-point loss to the Mavericks:
