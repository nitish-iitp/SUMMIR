The Dallas Mavericks secured a nail-biting 121-119 victory against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday at the Paycom Center, with P.J. Washington delivering a career-defining performance. Washington, stepping up in the absence of Luka Dončić, played a pivotal role, notching a season-high in points and a career-high in rebounds.
The Mavericks, missing their superstar Luka Dončić due to a right knee contusion, relied heavily on Washington to lead both offensively and defensively. The star forward did not disappoint, recording his first-ever 25-15 game and his first 20-point double-double as a Maverick. He finished the game with an impressive stat line: 27 points, 17 rebounds, two assists, and two blocks. Shooting 7 of 13 from the field, including 3 of 4 from beyond the arc, and a perfect 10 of 10 on free throws, Washington showcased his all-around brilliance in just over 28 minutes of action.
Washington's stellar performance was a key factor in the Mavericks overcoming the in-form Thunder. His leadership on both ends of the court proved decisive, earning praise from fans and solidifying his position as a crucial asset for Dallas.

With this standout performance, P.J. Washington has proven his ability to rise to the occasion, even in the absence of one of the league's top stars. Fans will eagerly await his next game to see if he can continue this level of excellence.

The Dallas Mavericks secured a decisive win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, led by a standout performance from P.J. Washington. The star forward, known for delivering strong performances against the Thunder, expressed his enthusiasm for playing at the Paycom Center and his joy in defeating this specific opponent.
"I love playing here, I love this gym, I love obviously beating them too. It was a great win for us and I was just ready to play tonight," Washington said after the game, highlighting his motivation and comfort on the court.
While Washington’s contributions were critical to the win, he did not hesitate to credit the Mavericks’ big men, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II, for their impactful efforts. The duo played a significant role in the team’s victory by dominating the paint and controlling the boards.
Daniel Gafford showcased his physicality off the bench, recording a double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds, including an impressive eight offensive boards. Meanwhile, Dereck Lively II added six points, five rebounds, and two blocks, contributing defensively and on second-chance opportunities.
"Offensive rebounding, creating second shots and getting back in transition and limiting them to one shot. So credit to our bigs, Gaff and Live, they played their a**es off tonight…" Washington said, emphasizing their importance in the game.
The Mavericks' ability to limit the Thunder to single-shot possessions and capitalize on offensive rebounds proved crucial. With Washington leading the charge and the big men providing solid support, Dallas demonstrated their depth and resilience.
This victory not only adds to the Mavericks’ momentum but also reinforces Washington’s reputation as a key player against tough opponents. Fans will undoubtedly look forward to his continued contributions in upcoming games.
