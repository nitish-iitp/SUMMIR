The Oklahoma City Thunder held practice on Saturday. It's fresh off their 2024 NBA Cup win over the Phoenix Suns on Friday.

Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault and Aaron Wiggins talked to the local media after practice. Daigneault followed up on his postgame frustration on the lack of free-throw attempts the Thunder have had despite leading the league in drives.

Wiggins discussed what Jalen Williams brings defensively as a center. Alex Caruso and Nikola Topic were also spotted at practice. Caruso did a lot of physical work. He's missed the last two games with hip soreness.

Here's a recap of the Thunder's Nov. 16 practice:

Aaron Wiggins on Jalen Williams’ defense at center: “Just the same tenacity he has at the 1, the 2, the 3 & the 4. I don’t think much has changed for him. Obviously having to be more physically involved… It kinda gives him more opportunity to make more plays all over the court.”

— Clemente Almanza (@CAlmanza1007) November 16, 2024

Aaron Wiggins on Lu Dort: “He’s just very disruptive. He’s able to make guys have to work to get a decent look… He makes teams get to their 4th option instead of playing comfortable.”

— Clemente Almanza (@CAlmanza1007) November 16, 2024

Aaron Wiggins said he’s not worried about the lack of free throws because it’s out of their control. Instead, he trusts Daigneault will vouch for them. Said it’s still early in the season

Mark Daigneault: “If I’m going to address the officials, which I don’t do very often… I’m going to make sure I have credibility and integrity. I’m not going to be overly subjective. Everything I said last night was just stone cold fact.” pic.twitter.com/yuMyNJTjyW
