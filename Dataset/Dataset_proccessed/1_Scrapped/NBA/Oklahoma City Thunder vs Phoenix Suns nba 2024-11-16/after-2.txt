Cap Discussion

As Carlson signed during the season, he signs a “Rest-of-Season” contract.
OKC uses the Minimum Player Salary Exception to sign Carlson over the Salary Cap.
Carlson’s $990,895 counts toward OKC’s Team Salary (a daily rate of $6,650).
For Apron Salary and Tax purposes, Carlson’s salary is adjusted to the applicable minimum salary for 2 YOS, prorated as of the date of signing (11/16/2024):  $1,787,588 for the full season or a daily rate of $11,997.
OKC waives Malevy Leons to open a roster spot for Carlson.
