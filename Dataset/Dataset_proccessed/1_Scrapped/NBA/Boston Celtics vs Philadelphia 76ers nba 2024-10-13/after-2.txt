The Philadelphia 76ers vs Boston Celtics preseason game on Sunday saw a clash between two teams expected to compete to come out of the Eastern Conference this season. Without Joel Embiid on the court, the Sixers lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves Friday night.

The Cameroon-born big man wasn't available for this game, but the rest of the team was ready to lock horns with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Co.

Boston meant business from the get-go, taking a 20-9 lead with 5:18 on the clock. Besides Luke Kornet dropping 11 points in the first period, Tatum and Brown helped the team with 10 and seven points, respectively. Boston won the first period by 22 points after a 40-18 win to start the game.

The 76ers woke up in the second quarter, scoring 30 points on their opponents, but the Celtics scored 31 to extend the lead to 23 points. Jared McCain continued his good performances, finishing with 10 points while KJ Martin and Jeff Dowtin Jr. scored seven points apiece.

Luke Kornet added four units to her account while Jaylen Brown reached double digits in points (10), being the third-best scorer of the team in the first half behind Kornet and Tatum (11). Sam Hauser was more active and finished the half with nine units.

The Celtics started the second half ready to keep asserting their dominance, adding 18 points to their lead following a 37-15 win. The 76ers had no answer for the defending champions, only managing to score 15 points in the third quarter. Just like it started, this game ended.

The Boston Celtics put on a clinic against the Philadelphia 76ers 139-89. The Sixers rested several players, including Joel Embiid, Paul George, Tyrese Maxey, Eric Gordon, and Kyle Lowry while the C's were at full strength. The development of the game was lopsided and the Celtics showed off their power against a diminished squad.
