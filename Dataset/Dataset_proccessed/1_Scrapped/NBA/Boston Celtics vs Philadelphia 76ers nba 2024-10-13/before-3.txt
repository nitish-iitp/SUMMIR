Paul George did not get an opportunity to take on the Boston Celtics on Saturday in a game between two Eastern Conference powerhouses. The Philadelphia 76ers travel to Massachusetts to face the defending champions at TD Garden in an evening tip-off. George was not on the Sixers injury report and was expected to see some minutes in Saturday's encounter.

Although George did not play in the 76ers' game against the New Zealand Breakers, the nine-time All-Star did play a significant role in the team's 121-111 loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

George impressed in his preseason debut against the Wolves, finishing with a game-high 23 points on 8-15 shooting. The 6-foot-8 forward was 4-9 from behind the arc and made all three free throws. He also chipped in with six rebounds, two assists and one steal.

Philadelphia fans would have been thrilled to see the 34-year-old make an immediate impact after his highly publicized move over the offseason.

Injuries have hampered George's progress over the last few seasons, with the talented star playing just 189 games over four seasons between 2019 and 2023. Last season, however, he played 74 games for the Clippers and averaged 33.8 minutes per game.

The preseason should provide Paul George with a great opportunity to fine-tune his game and get familiar with his new teammates on the court.

After George opted out of his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, the Sixers signed him to a four-year, $212 million contract. George joins former MVP center Joel Embiid and All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey.

Last season, Paul George averaged 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.5 assists over 74 games for the Los Angeles Clippers.

The 76ers ranked seventh in the Eastern Conference standings last season with a 47-35 record but could have finished higher if it wasn't for a late-season injury to Embiid.

With the team's big three looking fit and healthy for the upcoming season, the 76ers start the season as one of the favorites in the East alongside the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks.
