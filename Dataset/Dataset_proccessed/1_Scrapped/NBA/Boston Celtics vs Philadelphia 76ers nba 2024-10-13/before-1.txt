Is Joel Embiid playing tonight against Boston Celtics? (Source: Imagn)

Joel Embiid is not available for Saturday's game against the Boston Celtics. The 2023 NBA MVP also missed Friday's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves at home. Embiid, who was slowed down by a left meniscus injury last year, had a scheduled evaluation on his previously injured knee.

He wasn't with the Sixers yesterday. Coach Nick Nurse also remained non-committal about Embiid's presence against Boston. Considering his absence from Friday's game, the star center can be deemed unlikely to play against the Celtics.

Philadelphia seemingly is taking precautions with Embiid after another injury-riddled end to his season. He was also active this summer with Team USA, contributing to their gold medal win at Paris Olympics.

Joel Embiid hasn't scrimmaged in training camp

Embiid's introduction this season could be a slow process. He wasn't active in scrimmages during training camp, either. Embiid's health is ultimately the deciding factor for Philadelphia's success. His injuries have dictated he team's ceiling the past few years, especially in the postseason.

This year, with Philadelphia investing in Paul George to form a new big three alongside Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, the plan should be to ensure the big man's conditioning is at its peak in the business end of the season.

The Sixers can finally break their conference finals jinx and possibly even make the finals with the talent at their disposal. They haven't had a better roster in previous years, but it could all be for nothing if Embiid faces similar health issues again.

Even he has committed everything to this cause.

"We gotta do whatever it takes to make sure that in the postseason I am healthy," Embiid said on Media Day. "This year, there’s no agenda, there’s no All-Star, there’s no All-NBA."

The Sixers are among the few teams with a shot to dethrone the Boston Celtics in the East this year, provided they are healthy, and Joel Embiid seems to realize that.
