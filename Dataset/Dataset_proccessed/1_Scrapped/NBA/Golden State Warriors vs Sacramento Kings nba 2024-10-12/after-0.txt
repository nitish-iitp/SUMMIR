The Golden State Warriors made their home preseason debut on Friday in a rematch against the Sacramento Kings. Steph Curry and Co. won 91-90 against the LA Clippers in Hawaii before downing the Kings 122-112 on the road two nights ago. The Dubs improved their record to 3-0 following a 109-106 in their second showdown against the Kings.

Curry played only 16 first-half minutes after jamming his finger late in the second quarter. The injury was reportedly minor as the two-time MVP finished his postgame routine in the locker room. Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski led the Warriors.

Sacramento Kings vs Golden State Warriors: Game Summary

Kyle Anderson, acquired in the offseason, showed Warriors fans why coach Steve Kerr was excited with his addition. He led the offense early with six points and savvy plays. Moses Moody and Draymond Green joined him in the scoring column. Steph Curry added five points, helping the Dubs to a 34-30 lead.

Keegan Murray led all scorers with 10 points while new King DeMar DeRozan added seven. Sacramento's 3-for-15 clip from deep was a key reason it trailed after the first quarter.

De'Aron Fox came out smoking in the second quarter, hitting three straight 3-pointers to push the Sacramento Kings to a 40-36 advantage. Mike Browns' starters did the heavy lifting in the first half as the bench could only come up with three points. The Kings took the lead 58-55 by halftime.

Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors' offense stuttered. After dropping 34 points in the first quarter, the Dubs labored to finish with 21. The team's 12 first-half turnovers, seven in the second quarter was a big reason for its erratic play.

Steve Kerr held out Steph Curry starting the second half after reportedly jamming his finger before the halftime break. Kerr's emerging young stars, Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody and Jonathan Kuminga led the team to a 109-106 victory.

Sacramento's starters played well but hardly got anything from the bench. The Kings are still looking for their first preseason win.
