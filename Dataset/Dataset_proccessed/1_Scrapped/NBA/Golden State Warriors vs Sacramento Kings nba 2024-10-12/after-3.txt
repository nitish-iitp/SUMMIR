Warriors fans roast Klay Thompson as $21M guard goes off vs Kings (Source: Warriors X, NBA.com)

After all, the Golden State Warriors might be feeling good after parting ways with Klay Thompson. It may not be true from an emotional standpoint, considering the former All-Star's immeasurable contributions, but it could be a fair assessment from an on-court production standpoint.

Their replacement for Thompson this season, Buddy Hield, who signed a $21 million three-year deal, has probably convinced the fanbase that getting him on board was the right call. Hield impressed in his latest showing in Wednesday's preseason contest between the Warriors and the Kings.

The veteran guard shot the lights out, going 6 of 7 from 3-point range and 8 of 9 overall. Hield only missed his last shot of the night. He scored a game-high 22 points in 19:24 minutes of action. Hield hit his first five 3s of the night consecutively.

Warriors ready for post-Klay Thompson era, hit 28 3-pointers in preseason showdown

Golden State was in full rhythm during its preseason contest against the Kings. The Dubs hit 28-pointers on a whopping 52 attempts during the contest to win 122-112. Buddy Hield's 6-of-7 3-point shooting performance paved the way as 10 Warriors players found the back of the net from long range, with at least five making three or more shots.

That was one of Steve Kerr's concerns before the preseason started with Klay Thompson departing. He nearly combined with Steph Curry to shoot 10 3s a game, and filling that void was one of Kerr's priorities.

"I want Wiggins shooting ... I want Brandin, I want Moses, I want De'Anthony," Kerr told reporters on Oct. 1.
"I want to be a high volume three-point shooting team. I think that's important for us. And the big shift is Klay's not here. We're fourth in the league in three-point attempts last year. ... We're going to have to fill that void."

The players answered his call as most took at least five or more attempts while maintaining a high shot profile as the Dubs ran screening actions and made their off-ball movement count throughout the night.
