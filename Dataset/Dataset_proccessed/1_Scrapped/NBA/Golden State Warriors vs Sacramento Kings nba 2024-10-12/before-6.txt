On the plus side, less horrible basketball to endure.

I think at the very least you should be able to get games in low definition over the air with some bunny ears before then.


What do I do in OR/WA if I have DirecTV or YouTube TV?
As of now, you’ll have games starting January 1 on KUNP, in high definition. Games before that are on CHARGE 2.2, which does not seem to have a local broadcast on those services (based on current information; it’s always possible that changes).


FWIW charge 2.2 says they are on YouTube TV as well as a streaming option. However both are probably potato quality streams which is almost pointless for sports...


Watch CHARGE! on:
Local Over the Air Broadcast channel 2.2
Local Over the Air Broadcast channel 47.3
Xfinity Portland Regional channel 302
Xfinity Portland Regional channel 1170
Northwest Fiber / Ziply Portland channel 463
Northwest Fiber / Ziply Portland channel 467
Dish Network Channel 290-36
You Tube TV
Sling TV
CHARGE! is also available to stream online at WatchCHARGE.com/watch-live/


Of course I'm a sucker who bought BlazerVision before I realized the replays are "live replays" with no ability to pause, rewind or fast forward so I feel like a sucker who is $120 dollars poorer right now and not a guy to be giving advice.

How many people will be buying Blazers games on January 1, if the team is 3-17?

I was able to pause, ff, and replay tonight's game using BlazerVision via NBA League Pass...

Not only that but they gave me 2 tickets and League Pass for non-Blazer games for the full season for free. 
Just a diehard, life-long Blazer fan...

Clearly the Blazers have done a fantastic job disseminating information about their broadcast situation.

It's still a marked improvement from the ROOT sports situation from the past, Blazervision now offers every game for one price with some classic games. This is the case even if you live in Portland, no local black out unlike the League Pass.

You also have the option of getting the games over antenna eventually, which harkens back to the good old days of the past. Just because it's not all perfect on game 1 is not really relevant, a bit of growing pains early on is understandable.
