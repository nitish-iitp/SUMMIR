NBA Player Props Today For 10/30/24!

Check out some spicy NBA Player Props for 10/30/24! Sportsmemo’s Steve Seagrave drops the best picks for NBA player props today with a a couple stellar suggestions to check out!

WagerTalk, the largest picks site online, offers NBA FREE PICKS every day, as well as cheap premium paid NBA picks from expert professional handicappers.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Bam Adebayo Miami Heat Over 14.5 Points (-125) DK

Bam Adebayo has fallen well short of this line in all three of his games this season with only 12, 12 and 9 points scored.

However, he’s due for some positive regression as he scored an average of 19,3 points per game last season while clearing this line in 81% of his games.

The New York Knicks offer the perfect matchup for a bounce back as Adebayo has scored 15+ points in 13 of his last 16 head-to-head games for an 81% success rate.

Opposing big men Evan Mobley & Jarrett Allen both had success against New York recently with 17 and 15 points respectively and Al Horford managed to score 11 points against them on opening night despite only taking 7 shots in 26 minutes of court time.

Let’s look for Bam to get back on track in a matchup where he’s thrived in the past.

NBA Player Props Predictions: RJ Barrett Toronto Raptors Over 27.5 Points + Rebounds (-125) DK

RJ Barrett played his first game of the season on Monday night and logged 20 points and 5 rebounds on 21 field goal attempts despite playing only 29 minutes.

His role should increase in Charlotte as Scottie Barnes & Kelly Olynyk have already been ruled out for the game while Immanuel Quickley is doubtful with a pelvis injury.

Last season, in games where Barrett took 18+ field goal attempts he covered this line in 78.6% of his games while averaging 32.3 Points + Rebounds.

Barrett cleared this line in both of his head-to-head games against the Hornets last season with 29 and 31 PR.

The short-handed Raptors will need to lean on Barrett and the increased usage should be more than enough to eclipse this number.
