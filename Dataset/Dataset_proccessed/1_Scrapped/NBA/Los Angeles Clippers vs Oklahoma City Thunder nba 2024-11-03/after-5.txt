OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Reflects on Clippers Trade: I'd Say It Worked Out in My Favor
SCOTT POLACEK
NOVEMBER 3, 2024

B/R

Things are looking up for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the point guard seems pleased to be with his current team even if he doesn't hold anything against his former one.

"I had a great year here when I was here," he said after leading the Thunder to a road win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, per ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.

"Their front office made a trade that they thought was best for their team. Same with the Thunder. Then the last five years I've tried to focus on my development and the team's development. I've tried to be the best basketball player I can be for the Oklahoma City Thunder. And I'd say it worked out in my favor."

The Clippers traded Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, five first-round picks and two pick swaps to the Clippers for Paul George in the summer of 2019. That was also the summer Los Angeles added Kawhi Leonard as it geared up for a run at the title that never materialized.

SGA was coming off a solid first season when he was named to the All-Rookie Second Team, but the Clippers may not have envisioned him becoming a legitimate MVP candidate and one of the best players in the entire league.

That is exactly what he is after finishing in the top-five in MVP voting in each of the last two seasons.

He could be well on his way to another such result in 2024-25, as the Thunder are 6-0 with him averaging 26.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.2 blocks a night.

As for the Clippers, George is no longer on the team, Leonard is yet to play this season and their record is 2-4 in a daunting Western Conference. The trade was understandable in the moment for a franchise that saw the opportunity to add multiple proven stars in the same offseason and chase an elusive title in a city that is largely dominated by the Los Angeles Lakers.

But it seems to have worked out better for the Thunder in hindsight.
