Bamberg Team News

Bamberg has struggled to find consistency this season, though they managed a recent win in Estonia in the FIBA Europe Cup, breaking a losing streak. Their Bundesliga campaign has been challenging, with only one win from four games, achieved away from home. Their only home win came in the German Cup against Ulm.

Offensively, Bamberg is currently the lowest-scoring team in the Bundesliga, averaging just 69.3 points per game. Their shooting percentages are notably poor, ranking last in two-point shooting (44%) and among the bottom teams in three-point accuracy. They also average the fewest assists per game, indicating limited ball movement and offensive flow. Defensively, they have not been particularly strong either, which suggests the team has substantial room for improvement on both ends of the court. Head coach Anton Gavel aims to instill a fast-paced style similar to what he employed with Ulm. Primary scoring responsibilities lie with Kyle Lofton and Ronaldo Segu, who both thrive in a faster tempo. Ibrahim Watson Boye has also been an emerging threat, while young Moritz Krimmer is gaining a more significant role. Kevin Wohlrath provides defensive solidity, and in the paint, Filip Stanić leads with an impressive average of 10 rebounds per game. KeyShawn Feazell also contributes effectively on the boards and stretches defenses with his three-point shooting.A primary issue for Bamberg is the drop-off in intensity and production from their bench, which impacts their consistency in both offense and defense.

In their upcoming match, Bamberg will aim to capitalize on the fatigue and injuries of their opponent. Speeding up the pace to generate easier scoring opportunities will be essential, as they often struggle in half-court sets. Additionally, Bamberg needs to focus on securing defensive rebounds to limit their rival’s second-chance points, which could otherwise cause issues.

Alba Berlin Team News

Alba Berlin is facing a challenging phase, winning just one of their last five games across all competitions, with that victory coming against Braunschweig in the Bundesliga. Currently, they hold a disappointing record of 2–3 in the league.

The team’s difficulties stem largely from ongoing injury issues. Alba has struggled to field a complete roster, as player recoveries are frequently followed by new injuries. The congested schedule hasn’t helped; they played 11 games in October alone, leaving minimal time for rest or practice. The few consistent contributors so far have been Martin Hermannsson and Trevion Williams. Hermannsson averages 11.8 points and 6.6 assists per game, providing stability in Alba’s offense. Matteo Spagnolo has been a capable backup, particularly in Bundesliga play. Williams, known for his range during his time with Ulm, has struggled from deep this season with Alba, hitting only one of seven attempts. Justin Bean has been Alba’s most versatile performer, delivering in both offense and defense. Luis Olinde, though shaky early on, has shown improved shooting recently, lifting his three-point accuracy from 27%. Adding to Alba’s issues, Khalifa Koumadje was recently suspended following an altercation with a doping control official. Despite these challenges, Alba still leads the Bundesliga in assists, showcasing their capacity for team-oriented play.

In this matchup, Alba Berlin will aim to capitalize on their stronger offensive capabilities. With their opponent’s struggles on offense, Alba’s strategy will likely involve tight defense to disrupt their rhythm and limit easy scoring chances. Offensive rebounding could be another key focus, allowing Alba to generate second-chance points and exploit any weaknesses in their opponent’s defensive setup.

Bamberg  vs Alba Berlin H2H

This matchup marks the 127th meeting between Bamberg and Alba Berlin, with Alba leading the head-to-head series, having won 80 games. In their recent encounters, Alba has claimed victory in four of the last five matchups.

Absences and Injuries

Bamberg will be without Noah Locke, while Alba Berlin faces a string of injuries.  Malte Delow, Matt Thomas, Yanni Wetzell, and Jonas Mattisseck are out, and Matteo Spagnolo’s participation remains questionable. Additionally, Khalifa Koumadje is suspended, further limiting Alba’s rotation.

Bamberg  vs Alba Berlin Prediction

Alba Berlin arrives for this game after a demanding EuroLeague schedule and is heavily impacted by injuries, raising questions about the lineup they’ll be able to field. Bamberg has also struggled to find consistency early in the season, but they’ll likely see this as an opportunity to challenge an injury-riddled Alba team. Given these factors, a close and competitive game is expected, with Bamberg potentially having a chance to surprise the EuroLeague side on their home court.
