After the Oklahoma City Thunder's comeback win over the LA Clippers, franchise history was made. The 2024-25 Thunder are the first team in OKC history to start a season with a perfect 6-0 record. All six wins have been by double-digit points.

It's early, but the offseason hype for the Thunder was well worth it. They've looked like a title contender and will easily rattle off wins. Dominant second-half stretches have highlighted the win streak.

The Thunder and Cleveland Cavaliers are the last undefeated teams in the league a little over a week into the season. The last time the former started 5-0 or better, they went to the NBA Finals. A repeat in history 12 years later is certainly in the cards.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams round out one of the league's best trios. When asked about their historical start, the triumvirate played it cool. Here's what the trio had to say about OKC's 6-0 start:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

"It's cool but it doesn't mean much. Still 76 games left. We're not even close to where we need to be to accomplish what we want to accomplish. Which is obviously winning big. It's cool. Not satisfied at all."

Chet Holmgren

"I don't think any team's ever hung a banner for a six-game win streak. It wasn't our end goal in the beginning. Like I said before, you don't take wins for granted in this league. We know how much hard work it takes to do something like that. We have bigger goals that we're working towards."

Jalen Williams

“It's cool for sure. I don't think we'll get too ahead of ourselves. We got to play another good team. We’ll have fun on this three-hour flight back home and then it’s kinda right back to it. But it’s a cool thing to write your name in history.”
