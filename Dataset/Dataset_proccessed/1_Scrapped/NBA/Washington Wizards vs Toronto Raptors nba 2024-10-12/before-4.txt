Steph Curry stats tonight against the Sacramento Kings (Image Source: IMAGN)

Steph Curry appeared before his home fans for the first time this season. After opening their preparations on the road, the Golden State Warriors faced the Sacramento Kings on Friday at the Chase Center. The two-time MVP, who hasn't missed a preseason game yet, led the Dubs in the rematch with the Kings.

Curry didn’t attempt his first shot until the midway point of the first quarter. He missed a 3-pointer before making the second one two plays later. The point guard got plenty of help from Draymond Green, Kyle Anderson and Moses Moody in carrying the Dubs’ offense in the first period.

Warriors fans did not see "Chef Curry" return in the second half. Anthony Slater had this to report about the two-time MVP's absence:

"Steph Curry jammed his finger late in the first half and left for the locker room. Didn't return for the second half, but it doesn't sound like an issue. He's back in the weight room currently going through his normal postgame workout routine, per Warriors."

Steve Kerr kept Curry out in the second half of the Dubs' previous two games. On Friday, he has more reason not to let the franchise cornerstone see more action. Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski took turns playing point guard in his absence.

What was Steph Curry's impact against Sacramento Kings?

Steph Curry was content to play decoy in his 16-minute appearance against the Sacramento Kings on Friday. He helped orchestrate the plays and used screens to move all over the perimeter. In a handful of cases, Moses Moody and Jonathan Kuminga benefited from the way he pulled the Kings' defense on him.

Curry did miss two open shots, an issue that will not worry him. He has had some slumps in the past but he normally steps up when needed to.

For now, the Warriors will be relieved their superstar didn't suffer a serious injury after playing another preseason game.
