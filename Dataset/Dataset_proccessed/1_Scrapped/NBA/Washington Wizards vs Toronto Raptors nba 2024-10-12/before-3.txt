The Minnesota Timberwolves vs Philadelphia 76ers showdown is one of the five games scheduled on October 11. The newly constructed Sixers are playing their first preseason game against NBA competition after a game against the New Zealand Breakers on Monday.

On the other hand, this is the second preseason game that the Timberwolves are playing.

The 76ers signed former LA Clippers superstar Paul George to a four-year max contract, joining him with Joel Embiid for their championship bid. On the other hand, the Timberwolves are also entering the season after one of the biggest trades this offseason.

With Karl-Anthony Towns gone to the New York Knicks, the Timberwolves have a lot at stake. They had the most successful season in the last 20 years, and it will be interesting to see how they use their new roster.
