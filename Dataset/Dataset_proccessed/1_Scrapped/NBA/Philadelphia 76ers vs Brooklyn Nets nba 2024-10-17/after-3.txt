On Wednesday evening, the Phildelphia 76ers hosted the Brooklyn Nets at Wells Fargo Center.

Despite playing without a lot of key players, they won by a score of 117-95 to improve to 2-2 in the preseason.

After the game, the 76ers waived four players.

Via Keith Pompey of The Philadelphia Inquirer: "The #Sixers waived Jordan Tucker, Isaiah Mobley, Judah Mintz and Max Fielder after tonight’s game with the Brooklyn Nets."

Mobley has played two seasons in the NBA for the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Last year, he averaged 2.3 points and 1.0 rebounds per contest while shooting 41.7% from the field and 30.0% from the three-point range in ten games.
