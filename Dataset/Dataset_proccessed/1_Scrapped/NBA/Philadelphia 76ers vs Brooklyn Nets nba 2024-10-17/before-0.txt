Real Madrid Team News

Real Madrid lost to Baskonia in the previous round 76:72 and now has a 1-2 record after three rounds of the EuroLeague, which is not a good sign for them. The top scorers in that game were Dzanan Musa with 17 points and Walter Tavares with 14 points and an impressive 15 rebounds, but even that wasn’t enough to match a highly motivated opponent.

Real Madrid currently cannot find the right form in the early part of the season. Last season’s EuroLeague finalist doesn’t look good, especially on defense, and it seems they are too dependent on Facundo Campazzo. With him on the court and without him, they are two different teams, which was evident against Partizan when his entrance into the game completely changed the flow, and also against Baskonia, where he was absent due to suspension. When he is on the court, opponents’ aggressive hedging on the pick-and-roll is less effective because he perfectly finds his teammates under the basket, and that’s where Real Madrid thrives at the moment. It’s also clear that this team is allowing too many three-pointers from opponents. Bayern destroyed them like that in the first round, Partizan was close to upsetting them, and Baskonia made 10 three-pointers, beat them, and added to their growing problems, which has seriously shaken Chus Mateo’s position as head coach. They currently lack the necessary level of aggressiveness on the perimeter, which will be crucial for them in the upcoming period if they are to avoid a deeper crisis, reflected in losses in both competitions. For now, the only thing that can save this team is Facundo Campazzo in top form, and because of that, Real Madrid needs to seriously consider whether they need another addition to the squad, as this situation is clearly a red alert.

In the next round, the key will be exactly that aggressiveness on the opponent’s guards, from where everything starts. If Real Madrid allows Kendrick Nunn, Jerian Grant, and Kostas Sloukas to dominate and score, while also finding Mathias Lessort under the basket, it will be a big problem for the home team.

Panathinaikos Team News

Panathinaikos was unexpectedly defeated by Paris on the road, 84:80, in a game where they trailed the entire time. The top performers for the Greek team were Mathias Lessort with 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Kendrick Nunn with 16 points. However, it wasn’t enough to outplay the EuroLeague debutant.

Up to this game, Panathinaikos had been playing just enough at the start of the EuroLeague, in line with Ergin Ataman’s philosophy, who usually starts seasons a bit slower, especially after great successes. The Turkish coach knows that there should be a limit to this, which is why he publicly criticized some of his team’s performances, and he was proven right, as this loss was a major blow. They were expected to extend their winning streak and take full advantage of the relatively easier schedule. What was uncharacteristic for them against Paris was their extremely poor defense against the opponent’s guards. T. J. Shorts and Nadir Hifi did whatever they wanted, resembling the duo that won the EuroCup last season. Panathinaikos couldn’t keep up with their pace, as Shorts finished the game with 16 points and Hifi with 20. The fact that Panathinaikos wasn’t at their defensive best is highlighted by the fact that Paris shot just 7/29 from three-point range, yet still managed to control most of the game and entered the final two minutes with a 12-point lead. Considering the difference in quality, such an approach from Panathinaikos is unacceptable and shows that they didn’t take their opponent seriously enough, something that has been known to happen with Ataman’s teams. Panathinaikos is also currently struggling with role distribution following the arrivals of Lorenzo Brown and Cedi Osman. Those two, along with Kostas Sloukas, didn’t play more than 18 minutes, which is unlikely to happen when the stakes are higher.

In their next game, Panathinaikos must stop Facundo Campazzo’s playmaking, and they have the capacity to do so. Ataman can lock down the opposing point guard through Jerian Grant or Panagiotis Kalaitzakis, effectively cutting him off from the rest of the team. On the other hand, they can attack Walter Tavares with stretch options, just like they did in last season’s EuroLeague final.

Real Madrid vs Panathinaikos Prediction

Real Madrid has been struggling since the start of the season, as seen in the Liga Endesa, but also in the EuroLeague after their loss to Baskonia. Despite both teams losing in the previous round, it seems the home team’s problems run deeper, as they have failed to find their rhythm for several games, unlike Panathinaikos, whose loss to Paris was mostly due to a lackluster approach. Additionally, Ergin Ataman’s team knows how to win in Madrid, and our prediction is that they will take advantage of Real Madrid’s poor form and push them into an even deeper crisis.
