First attempt adding pictures to forum LOL, and pretty sure It's game 3 of preseason? been a busy week.

Game starts Tuesday, Wednesday my time, I won't be watching live, but will watch when home.

Keys to the game

- Shooting 40-50 3's per game, that's JJ's goal for the team?
- Rebounds much talk on this on the offseason
- Defense

Mods feel free to Insert start times/starting lineup etc.

on the 4th quater, kind of dissapointed In the game, not thing much to go for, but I guess that's pre-season lol

Not sold on Rui starting, but that won't change until Vando ready.
I can't wait for trade deadline and really hope DLO Is gone, If his not shooting his useless.

In our regular season starting lineup we have to limit the amount of defensive traffic cones per unit. Can’t have LBJ standing still (I know it’s preseason 22 for him but still) AND have D Lo standing still in the same unit, too. 3.5 defenders against 5 won’t work. I’ll try to be quiet about it but D Lo is fools’ gold for coaches. He dribbles too much, shoots too much, plays NO defense no matter how well you hide him. Let the ball swing, JJ! Get a system in place.

I’d like to go big. Our PG’s offensive role is to bring the ball up to LBJ and AD and Reaves, and to knock down open shots.

Christie can do that, and he’s our best POA defender. Start him at PG. Go big.

Lebron is the "leader" of this team. If he's not playing defense....then the rest will take their cues. Where's JJ??!! I thought he was much too good of a coach for this! Not like that last one, right?? We're all good now, I've been told.

They really need to take a look at starting Max, I think Rui better suited off the bench.

I'll get tomorrow's game up soon, busy atm.

The previous coach was so terrible it can’t possibly be worse but I’m waiting to see what JJ does before thinking anything about him. I do trust the coaching staff around him, and he’s got a pair.
