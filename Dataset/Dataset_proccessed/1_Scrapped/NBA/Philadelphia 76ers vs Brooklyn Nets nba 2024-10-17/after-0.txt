PHILADELPHIA 76ERS
76ers' Jared McCain Diagnosed with Pulmonary Contusion After Release from Hospital

The Philadelphia 76ers announced Thursday that rookie guard Jared McCain was diagnosed with pulmonary contusions and "has not displayed symptoms consistent with a concussion" in connection to the fall he suffered in the team's 117-95 win over the Brooklyn Nets.

The Sixers are keeping him out for Friday's contest against the Orlando Magic, which is their last of the preseason.

In the fourth quarter against the Nets on Wednesday, McCain jumped to collect his own rebound and lost his footing as he was coming down. As a result, he landed on his back on the hardwood.

The Philadelphia Inquirer's Keith Pompey reported the 20-year-old suffered bruising on his lungs and was due to undergo further evaluation for a potential concussion. He wrote that the team was "optimistic that he avoided serious injury."

The 76ers selected McCain with the 16th overall pick in the 2024 NBA draft. As a freshman at Duke last year, he averaged 14.3 points and 5.0 rebounds while shooting 46.2 percent overall and 41.4 percent from the perimeter.

First-year players on a championship contender often struggle to make a big impact out of the gate because head coaches prefer leaning on more experienced veterans. In the case of McCain, he should provide backcourt depth behind starters Tyrese Maxey and Kelly Oubre Jr. once he's cleared to play.

The Sixers open the regular season Oct. 23 against the Milwaukee Bucks.
