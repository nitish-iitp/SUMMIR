As expected, Sacramento Kings star guard De’Aaron Fox is waiting to see if he can earn supermax money by making an All-NBA team in the upcoming 2024-25 season.

According to ESPN‘s Sham Charania, the Kentucky alum “is bypassing a three-year, $165 million maximum extension this year as he and his representative, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, position the All-Star point guard for a larger deal in the 2025 offseason.”

The article highlights that Fox would be eligible for a four-year, $229-million deal next offseason. If he were to make an All-NBA team, something that De’Aaron Fox has accomplished just once (2022-23) in his seven-year career, that would make him supermax eligible.

Kings owner Vivek Ranadive and franchise officials have worked closely with Fox and other key players on major decisions this offseason, including the acquisition of All-Star DeMar DeRozan.

ESPN‘s Shams Charania 

The supermax deal would be a five-year, $345-million contract, making him the highest-paid player in NBA history. Jayson Tatum currently holds that title after signing a five-year, $314-million extension in July.

While that would be a hefty price for Fox’s services, if he were to make an All-NBA team, it would almost surely come on the shoulders of a successful Sacramento season.

Contract values notably increase with each passing season, primarily due to the parallels with the league’s TV deals. The price of keeping elite talent is steep, and De’Aaron Fox is holding out for the chance to see that hefty payday.

When is the next Sacramento Kings game?

Sacramento will head into its final week of preseason with two games—both on the road—remaining on its exhibition schedule.

The Kings will head to Salt Lake City for a matchup against the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night.
