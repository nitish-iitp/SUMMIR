Halfway Through Preseason, More Injuries, Chauncey's HOF Speech And A New Beer On The Brief Case, Episode 112
Casey Holdahl
October 15, 20248:42 AM PDT

Greetings from North Portland, where it looks as though fall is finally upon us. With two of the Trail Blazers' four preseason games in the books it seemed like a good time to record yet another edition of The Brief Case, which you can watch/listen/subscribe to below...

Topics on this edition include...

• The Trail Blazers' 101-99 loss to the Clippers in Seattle in their first preseason games of 2024

• Bouncing back by blowing out the Kings in Sacramento Sunday afternoon in their second preseason contest

• Returning to Moda Center to play their two remaining preseason games

• Injuries to Anfernee Simons and Matisse Thybulle

• Chauncey Billups' speech at his Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Sunday

• The new Trail Blazers/Rogue beer collaboration: The Rip City IPA

More episodes this week (and I swear they're going to get back to being "brief") so now would be a superb time to subscribe on  Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Youtube, IHeartRadio, Amazon Music, TuneIn, Podcast Addict, Podchaser, Pocket Casts, Deezer, PlayerFM. Help me out here folks!
