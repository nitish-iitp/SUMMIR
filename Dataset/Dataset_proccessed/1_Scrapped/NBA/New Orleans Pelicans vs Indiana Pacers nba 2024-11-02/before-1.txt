New Orleans (2-1) plays on national TV for the first time this season Tuesday, visiting Golden State (2-1) at 9 p.m. Central on TNT. Pregame coverage on WWL radio begins at 8:30. Local TV coverage on Gulf Sports & Entertainment Network returns for Wednesday’s 9 p.m. road back-to-back against the Warriors. Read Monday’s injury report, with Steph Curry out for Golden State.

Listen to Monday’s Pelicans Podcast for a look back at the Portland series and the team’s early-season outlook.

Check in with TV sideline reporter Andrew Lopez from San Francisco on a Pelicans practice day.

The Pelicans assigned two players to G League Birmingham.

New Orleans is No. 17 in NBA.com’s power rankings this week (10th in the Western Conference). John Schuhmann noted, “The last two games of the Pelicans’ four-game trip (in San Francisco on Tuesday and Wednesday) are the start of their only stretch of five games in seven days.”
