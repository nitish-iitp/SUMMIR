The Denver Nuggets had a week off after flying back from Abu Dhabi and finally got back on the court tonight against the Phoenix Suns. The Nuggets used the game as an opportunity to get their regular rotation an extended look while the Suns rested their entire starting lineup. Despite the imbalance of players in their standard roles, the game ended up being close throughout. Nikola Jokic and Michael Porter Jr had big nights but the Nuggets let their foot off the gas defensively in the second half and once they finally turned the game over to their bench Phoenix was able to seize control. Denver ends up dropping their third preseason game in a row and lose 118-114.

The Suns had their outside shot going early on and the Nuggets were cold. Porter Jr. was the exception to that and even though Phoenix pulled ahead early, MPJ sparked a run to get Denver back out in front. Neither team played a ton of defense early and the game stayed close. Russell Westbrook was the first player off the bench along with Julian Strawther. Westbrook immediately hit Aaron Gordon with a nice pocket pass for a reverse dunk and the play after that Strawther drew a shooting foul. More bench players checked in, Hunter Tyson and Dario Saric specifically, and Malone went with the bench plus Braun to close out the quarter. That group played well, albeit against the Suns deep bench, and got themselves a 33-26 lead to end the first.

Phoenix stayed hot from the field to start the second quarter while Tyson took some early threes that only found iron. Strawther got a couple to go though which kept Denver in front by about a half dozen. Murray came back in for Braun and Denver stayed aggressive but they missed some easy shots and Phoenix trimmed the lead. When it got down to two Jokic came back in and restored order though the game still had some preseason sloppiness. The starting group eventually dialed in and built the lead back up. They looked crisp as the quarter progressed and were playing like a unit that is ready for the regular season. The lead stretched into double digits but the Suns still knocked down a couple threes to keep it around ten. Jokic master-classed the rest of the quarter and the Nuggets went into halftime up 60-51.

True to his word, Malone had the starters (minus Jamal Murray) open the second half for the first time in the preseason. The Suns came out hot though and got within three points in the opening minutes of the second half. Denver kept in front by a bucket or two but kept blowing easy layups. Porter and Jokic finally started to get some momentum for Denver’s offense while Westbrook tried to inject some energy. It was a mixed bag with some poor turnovers and shots. Eventually the Suns took advantage and got all the way back to tying the game at 71 near the midway point of the quarter. Russ atoned for some earlier sloppiness with a tough alley-oop finish and then buried a corner three but the Suns kept knocking down shots. They took the lead before Denver answered by pushing the fastbreak. The Nuggets reeled off a 10-0 run and got the lead back when Colin Gillespie responded for Phoenix. At the end of the third quarter the Nuggets led 90-88.

It was Braun plus the bench to start the fourth with no true point guard on the floor. Much like the first half, the fourth started with Strawther scoring the points and Tyson missing shots on the other possessions. Dario Saric also got some opportunities inside that he cashed in. The game stayed tight as Phoenix still had the three point shot working. The Nuggets offense started to stall out and Phoenix took the lead. The Nuggets offense consisted of setting up outside shots for their bigs which did not yield great results, putting the chance for victory in danger. With just over three minutes left Trey Alexander checked in for Braun. Strawther continued to be Denver’s main source of offense, keeping them within striking distance. Ryan Dunn kept hitting threes though and Denver was running out of time. Zeke Nnaji had some good minutes in the fourth, he hit a three with just over a minute left and then bullied in for a layup to pull Denver within three. Dunn got the last laugh, burying a dagger three with just over twenty seconds to go. Nuggets lose 118-114.

Best matchup: Julian Strawther vs Ryan Dunn

The high level play came from the wings tonight. For the Nuggets, they got a very promising performance out of Strawther. He knocked down shots and attacked the basket, providing a big boost for the Nuggets bench unit. When he’s paired with Westbrook it puts a lot of pressure on opposing defenses, particularly on their reserve wing players, which looks like an advantage the Nuggets can exploit this season. On the Phoenix side it was a great game for Dunn. He was on fire seemingly all night long and was not shy about firing away from outside. He hit six three pointers and tallied twenty points. The twenty-eighth overall pick may not be in the Suns rotation come the start of the regular season, but he’s making a case for real playing time.

Main thing I noticed: MPJ looks really good

— Denver Nuggets (@nuggets) October 14, 2024

Porter Jr. was in his bag tonight. He had his standard long distance sniper game going, but he also just looks like such a difficult player to defend right now. The added muscle from the offseason is noticeable in his game as he bullied his defender on more than one occasion tonight. He also doesn’t seem to have lost any speed or shooting with his added bulk. Hopefully Denver can find more and more ways to get the ball in his hands and let him exploit matchups against smaller forwards.

Not reading a ton into three straight losses

The Nuggets have yet to win a game this preseason but color me not all that concerned. The most glaring hole right now seems to be in the backup forward spot and hopefully that gets assuaged with the return of Peyton Watson. Tyson had a tough night in that spot on both ends of the floor. Outside of that though the Nuggets look pretty much ready to roll. Jokic looks in MVP form, the bench additions plus Strawther’s growth make for a potent second unit and Braun seems to be fitting in just fine as the starting two guard. Depth is the biggest question mark and Jamal Murray only playing a half did highlight the lack of playable point guards on the Nuggets roster later in the game but going into the season Denver looks primed to be playing very high level basketball as long as they are healthy.

Of the serious title contenders this year I think Denver is the team most reliant on the aligning stars to win a championship. I don’t think any of the bets the Nuggets will be making come down to luck. For example, Westbrook doesn’t have to be his 2021 self for the Nuggets to be successful and everyone else who might need to make upgrades don’t have to make unrealistic leaps like Payton developing more on-ball or as a shooter, Braun being more consistent, Saric being fit and playing at last… Read more »

I realized I worded this poorly. They don’t need luck per say at all to win but they need a lot of high-end realistic scenarios hitting like Watson and Strawther developing into reliable role players, Saric and Westbrook not regressing and MPJ being better in a larger role. Luck e.g Watson developing to Christian Braun levels or a Strawther breakout would be great but even without it they have as good of a chance at winning the chip as those 90s Rockets teams did especially because of Jokic.

The one thing I see with the other contenders that hasn’t happened with Denver is a player taking an unexpected jump in production. In Minnesota, a 36 year old Mike Conley and NAW leveled up after the trade, and Naz became a 40% 3 point shooter overnight. White took a huge step from role player to borderline star after his trade to Boston, Pritchard is a late 1st giving good rotation minutes, and Hauser became a rotation player as an UDFA.

I guarantee they’re listening to the training staff, but I also think they trust their players. If Jokic or Murray say they want to play, they play them. Murray’s looming supermax last year also complicated that, as they didn’t want to shut him down and cause him to miss kickers for the Supermax. It’ll be interesting to see if they force guys to sit a few extra games, but I really don’t think they’re playing guys against the training staffs advice.

Lukewarm take. 2 things…Boston isn’t just jacking up 3s. They run a precise offense all through the game where a variety of high screens and slips create enough space for guys to step into a 3 and the five out ball allows guys like Tatum and Brown to attack off the dribble and create. Bottom line is they are scheming just to take 3s and they don’t always care who takes them.

CB will in fine there. The issue is thr offense needs to stop hesitating from 3. I am looking at Jamal. He is the one that needs to shoot like 8 3s a game.

Hopefully, Russ’s distribution skills will generate 4 or 5 more threes a game (total) for Jamal and Porter, and they should be better looks than either of them got with the bench last season. Jamal and Reggie were forced to take a lot of bad shots last year.

The volume argument is a weird one for me. MPJ and AG both took fewer attempts than 22-23, and getting them back to their prior level offsets any difference between CB and KCP, assuming CB doesn’t up the volume himself. Reggie was inefficient and there’s no doubt in mind that Strawther will shoot more, and hit a higher percentage than RJ did. We also have Saric, who doesn’t hesitate to shoot from deep. It won’t be hard to replace that 3 point volume.

Yeah we don’t want to transform our offense…it’s great. Jamal though is not always ready to shoot those 3s and would prefer to play with his food. That needs to stop. Boston runs a specific offense with high screens/slips designed for players to step i to their 3s and are ready to shoot. You have to have an offense ready to do that. We do…we have jokic ball ready to unleash holy hell 3 ball on people when they double him…akin to Mavs offense.

Hunter and Pickett showing fans of this team why it’s *always* idiodic to draft over age guys. Booth was high on his own farts when he made those picks. That said, I’m more concerned that Jamal hasn’t flashed at all in the pre-season after a dreadful playoff run and even worse Olympic showing. I love the dude and think he would be a multiple time all-star if he had never tore his ACL. But right now, he’s got me worried his decline may be Brandon Roy-esque.

I kind of expect the Nuggets, nay, rather I’m hoping the Nuggs are .500 or slightly above after 20 games. Yes, maybe that means Murray is playing his way to “in shape” but also means Malone has been liberal in experimenting and giving Straw/Tyson/Zeke/Vlatco (?) plenty of run.

that’s also the reason we should lower our expectations for regular season wins, despite how painful it is. We have to identify a bench that doesn’t get clobbered in its minutes. Nugs got too carried away with trying to win the West last year and exhausted the starters. George Karl found out how valuable record wins and a Coach of the Year were after he got promptly bounced after his Gallo-less team got bounced.

Dunn being called the steal of the draft by multiple outlets is beyond premature.

But if it winds up that Booth gave up 3 seconds to move up a couple spots and take a guy who tares his achilles and then the Suns take a steal with our pick… a year after taking Hunter + Pickett, it gonna be a very bad look.

The whole league regretted not taking Rudy. The Nuggets were still the ones that sold the pick.

It didn’t matter because we had Jokic and Tim was walking into that draft blind.

The stakes are infinitely higher now than they were back then. And we gave up picks to move up 3 spots.

It’s just different though when you have the best player on the planet, low on the blocks. There will be games they shoot a high volume because Joker gets you open looks but Nuggs aren’t going to pass up 65%+ efficiency from “Jokicslund”. They’re just not a five out team.

I get that. We’re not going to shoot 50+ in a game. There were only a small handful of games last year where they even shot 40. But it’s still incredibly frustrating to end up on the wrong side of those games where the opponent just keeps shooting, and making, 3 after 3.

I suspect if the Nuggets shoot a high % 3s on high volume they end up blowing out the other team, which means the 3rd string is playing the 4th quarter, which probably means both the volume and % drop.

Also it would require some team to think it is a good idea to double Jokic off of 3pt shooters. Most teams seem to decide that letting Jokic shoot 65% on floaters is better.

But we are a 3 out team with Gordon….that’s why it may not be surprising ismf we are grooming MPJ to be our new 4 while Strawther or Watson take the 3. If the latter can actually hit 3s…defense would fall off a cliff tho

But if P-Watt can turn into a 3 point shooter with that defense it changes our trajectory of sorts

Because he’s back in his home state they will be a problem. Booker Beal shooting threes is what you want

Gordon still has it but Jokic to Gordon or Westbrook to Gordon lacking. Great to see Porter come out of his shell. I liked him alot. Murray looks the the Canadian Olympics guy. Oe step behind. Could be the haircut. Watson should help and Zeke saved his career in Denver. Tyson gone!

Braun played some very good defense as did Zeke but nobody else did. Westbrook hustles like a rookie looking to make the team. Hope it rubs off.

I also agree that Porter looks to be taking a step forward this year. Texted to Plea about it during the game. That combined with the results last year, a coaches comment recently, and the financial implications of an extension for Gordon have me thinking the plan may be to let Gordon go after this season and play Porter exclusively at the 4. I’m not sure which coach it was but he was talking in an interview about how much better the spacing is with Porter at the 4. He… Read more »

I thought David Adelman gave GREAT insight into the keys for MPJ playing more PF this year. Worth a listen pic.twitter.com/AUT6JLK2OQ

Coach Malone said it clearly once. Your position is dictated by whom you guard on defense. Mike is miscast as a 3, everyone knows he can’t move laterally quickly enough. My gosh he’s a spindly 6-10. He adjusts by trying to trail the driving player after the blow-by and block him at the rim. He has the length to defend the 4 well. He bangs well enough to get rebounds when he plays that inside game on D. Even more so with the added muscle this year. So his natural… Read more »

AG can guard 1-4, so it shouldn’t be a problem.

Okay, not very effective on 1s. But I’ve seen him trying.

If we have to pick one or the other, I have a hard time picking MPJ over Gordon. Besides injury concerns, MPJ’s biggest issue has been his overall consistency and being a tease for most of his career, showing just enough to make you think he’s finally going to execute the leap, but never quite makes it over. I’ll admit having a bias for Gordon because he completely set his ego aside when he got here, embraced his role from Day 1, and has been an effective security blanket for… Read more »

MPJ did look great. We might see his best season yet this year.

MPJ and Strawther looked great, Zeke looked good. That’s more important than Tyson struggling and the team losing a pre-season game.

Agreed about Tyson, but this is his opportunity to snag the Holiday role from last year on the team and isn’t looking good so far.

Was great seeing Zeke and CB hitting 3s

Holiday role is Strawther

I think Strawther in the regular rotation, one of the “nine real guys”. Holiday was a sometimes play, sometimes not guy last year.

Yeah, Stawther will be getting the backup 2 minutes that Braun played last year.

I’d like to see him step up too. I was one who believed in his shooting and thought he could fill that role, but it’s been rough. They may just have to go back to Holiday at some point. He’s still out there.

So when BOS starters play they win by 50. When Nuggets do it they lose by 2. Nuggets 2nd round exit at best

AG’s shooting looks very good, more confident and with a better shot selection.
So i think we’ll be better on O than in 23/24.
POA D is not good enough.
Spacing with Russ is bad. Maybe we should play him more with Jok.

malone has stuck to the same rotation for jokic for 5 years or more. that’s one i don’t ever see him changing. so guess that would require getting jamal out even sooner or play mal and rw together with jokic

Team needs to get one win under their belt, just one, to improve the vibes. Even though it doesn’t matter, losing preseason games suck, because it shows our deep bench is garbage. You can bet Jokic doesn’t want an 0-5 preseason, coming off two losses in playoffs to Minny.
