The Denver Nuggets are still winless in this preseason, and after an overseas trip to Abi Dhabi and getting schooled by the backups for the Phoenix Suns, coach Michael Malone was not happy. He questioned their conditioning and habits, which was backed up by a couple of players as well including Michael Porter Jr. Can Denver find a gear to fix their 1-on-1 defense and play the whole 48 minutes against the Thunder? Or because they are seeing Oklahoma City next week to open the season, is this more of a “show nothing and let the reserves play” kind of game? Stay tuned – if you can find the game.

The Basics

Who: Denver Nuggets (0-3) vs Oklahoma City Thunder (2-1)

When: 7:00 PM MDT

Where: The Can. Denver, CO.

How to watch/listen: NBA League Pass, 92.5 FM Altitude Radio. Show up at Ball Arena in a mascot costume and say you’re there to collab with Rocky. Sail the high seas.

Rival Blog: Thunderous Intentions

Injury Report: Jamal Murray – probable (knee), Aaron Gordon – probable (calf), Peyton Watson – questionable (hamstring), DaRon Holmes II – out (Achilles); Jaylin Williams – out (hamstring), Kenrich Williams – out (knee), Nikola Topic – out (ACL).

The Three Things

The thing to watch for: Effort

Coach Malone lamented Denver’s defense and its conditioning, and whether it’s the starters or the reserves getting the bulk of the minutes there is no doubt he has been harping on those two things since Denver’s latest loss. Will Denver come out on fire, or will they shuffle through the motions and save their energy for the regular season? Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon have a couple of leg tweaks between them, so deciding when discretion is the better part of valor when it comes to getting ready for the season is definitely a fine line. Russell Westbrook has opinions on how well the “flip a switch” thing works, but Denver won a title doing it so they may feel differently.

Russell Westbrook on intensity in preseason:

“It’s very important..I think, mentality, you’ve got to be able to bring the same intensity every night..there’s minimal guys that can turn it on and off. I don’t believe in that, for me, and I wouldn’t condone it..”

The thing to remember: Rotations are a work in progress

Peyton Watson being out has affected Denver’s defensive rotation. If Jamal Murray takes the night off for his knee that will affect Denver’s guard rotation. The PG issue behind Russell Westbrook still hasn’t been confirmed, so Trey Alexander and Jalen Pickett should both get chances to prove they deserve minutes. If a rotation looks bad, please remember that Malone is getting an example on video to prove WHY it’s bad and what can be done about it. Denver knows its expected starters – Malone said today that Braun compliments the starters and Strawther does the same for the bench and that the shooting guard competition for the majority of minutes is over. Strawther will get some minutes there, but Malone has that 5 locked down for the regular season opener. Getting minutes with the reserves, and filtering them in with starters to limit minutes doesn’t mean a ton in the fourth preseason game. Don’t do this crossword in pen just yet.

The thing to bet: I keep telling you, it’s the preseason so don’t bet. Okay fine, bet the over on Strawther 3s. I expect him to get minutes and be a-chuckin’.

The Miller comparison falls apart when watching Pickett for five minutes. Let’s move on from him and get a real NBA guard who could help us.

Seems like DAJ has taken Zeke under his estimable wing-span and is in his ear with veteran savvy & encouragement.

See?

Second all-positive comment in this thread.

There’s nothing wrong with concern. I am right behind ‘ya.

But my cynicism about Malone a few days ago occasioned a “what happened to you, LBL? Did u turn into Florida Nugget?”

Far be it for me to demand positivity of any poster. Huge hypocrisy if I did.

IOW, I got zero problem with your perspective. I just try to season my unrelenting worry with a few tidbits of hope.

Keep on keeping on.

Our 3rd stringers stayed with the everyone’s favourite to win the West. Straw was amazing, Zeke was great, lots of positives all around. Refs needed to come and rescue Shai and comp.

Yeah those two taking strides is huge. That makes us 10 deep and has potential to really improve the shooting.

Nuggets are going to have to pull off some kind of trade magic or something, in order to find 3 point shooting. The floor spacing is gonna get ugly.

Man I’m just not seeing how this team is anything more than a first round. Depth is so rough. Some bright spots. But just not enough consistency around Jokic. Same problems amplified.

Wouldn’t it be nice if Denver tried posting CB so he can slash, pivot, use his muscular frame & superior horizontal balance to pump, spin and put up Shai/Brunson middies?

Guess Malone already tried one in a practice and the personnel has to adapt to Malone-Ball’s oh-so-modern “space floor for three’s” instead.
