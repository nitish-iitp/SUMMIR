Julius Randle's advice to Karl-Anthony Towns on the "dangers" of New York: "Just focus on basketball"

The flashy new Minnesota Timberwolves player sends a message to the new Knicks star

 JUAN LÓPEZ | MON, 10/14/2024 - 07:21   
Karl-Anthony Towns and Julius Randle to face off in a Knicks-Wolves match.

Julius Randle has become a star for the New York Knicks in recent years thanks to his class, his baskets, his offensive flow, and being a key piece in the solid team created by Tom Thibodeau. After a challenging year for him due to injuries, the All-Star has been traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Karl-Anthony Towns. Randle dares to give Towns advice that relates more to the distractions one can encounter in the Big Apple than purely basketball:

"Just think about basketball. Stay focused. Stay in the moment. This place tends to make things bigger than they may seem at that time."

When Randle injured his shoulder, the Knicks were on a 14-2 streak before entering the playoffs, where they ended up falling due to more injuries. The Wolves' new player was asked about that missed opportunity:

"What I have always said since I got here is that you have to control what you can control. And if that opportunity had come, I would have been ready for it. It didn't happen. And honestly, I am very happy, excited, and blessed. I have unfinished business here. And that's what I choose to focus on."

Regarding the type of player he has become after his transformation during his years with the Knicks: "I have always liked to say that I am more of a passer than a scorer. That's what I really like to do. That's how I grew up playing basketball. The situation here in New York, [Tom Thibodeau] needed me to score more, and I took on that responsibility. Then came Jalen, who also lessened some of that responsibility. But I love playing. That's what I like to do."
