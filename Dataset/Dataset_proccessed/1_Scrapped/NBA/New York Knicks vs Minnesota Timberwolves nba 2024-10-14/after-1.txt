Sunday's Minnesota Timberwolves vs New York Knicks game was the third of the preseason for each team. The game had a special meaning since it was the first time Karl-Anthony Towns faced his former team after being traded to New York a few weeks ago.

Despite Anthony Edwards' 31 points, the Timberwolves succumbed to the Knicks and his talented starting five that ended the game with four players scoring in double digits. Donte DiVincenzo also faced his former team, scoring 15 points and even trash-talking the Knicks' bench as he took a free throw. New York is now 3-0 in the preseason while the Timberwolves are 2-1 following this 115-110 result.
