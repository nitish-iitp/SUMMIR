MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
NBA Exec: Wolves 'Took a Considerable Step Backward' with Towns, Randle, Knicks Trade

Following the blockbuster trade that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks in exchange for Donte DiVincenzo, Julius Randle and Keita Bates-Diop, one NBA executive believes the Minnesota Timberwolves have taken a "competitive step backwards."

"They took a considerable step backwards," an NBA exec told Sportskeeda's Mark Medina. "Julius (Randle) is a really good offensive player, but he doesn't necessarily play a good game and spread the floor like KAT did."

Last season, Towns averaged 21.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game while shooting 41.6 percent from beyond the arc. The 2022 three-point champion has a career three-point shooting percentage of 39.8.

The dual threat of KAT, with his shooting ability and 7'0" frame was a perfect fit in Minnesota. In contrast, Randle's inconsistency from beyond the arc, with a career average of 33.3 percent, makes it much easier to pick apart defensively.

"I think they will find it difficult to play Ant (Anthony Edwards) and Julius on the floor together," the executive continued per Medina. "Ant needs to play in space. But there won't be space with Julius and Rudy (Gobert) on the floor together."

Randle's inability to draw double teams will limit Edwards' style of play and significantly affect his scoring ability.

Minnesota will have to work out its kinks before its season starts against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 22 at Crypto.com Arena.
