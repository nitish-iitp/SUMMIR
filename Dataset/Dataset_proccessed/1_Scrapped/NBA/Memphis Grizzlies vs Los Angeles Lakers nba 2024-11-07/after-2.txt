LOS ANGELES LAKERS
JJ Redick Slams Lakers' Effort, Praises LeBron James for Playing the 'Hardest' at 39

The stories about JJ Redick being a very intense coach who doesn't take losing well were on display Wednesday night after the Los Angeles Lakers' 131-114 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.

During his postgame press conference, Redick did praise LeBron James' "fantastic" 39-point effort and playing the "hardest" of anyone on the floor in defeat before walking off the podium after being asked how he would address a perceived lack of effort from the rest of the team.

"I just did," Redick said in response to the question.

The Lakers were playing without starters Anthony Davis and Rui Hachimura. Davis is dealing with a contusion on his left heel, while Hachimura was unable to play due to an illness.

Davis' absence, in particular, completely changes the dynamic of this team. He is playing arguably the best basketball of his career, averaging an NBA-high 32.6 points along with 11.6 rebounds per game and fantastic defense.

It was especially evident how toothless the Lakers are on defense without Davis. The Grizzlies shot 51.6 percent from the field and went 17-of-34 from three-point range. Ja Morant, Jaylen Wells and Jaren Jackson Jr. all scored 20 points.

Even though James put up 21 points, his minus-21 was the worst of anyone in the game. D'Angelo Russell, who is off to a bad start this season with a 37.5 field-goal percentage, was specifically called out by Redick after being benched midway through the third quarter.

"Just level of compete, attention to detail, some of the things we've have talked with him about for a couple of weeks," Redick said of his decision to pull Russell. "And at times, he's been really good with that stuff and other times, it's just reverting back to certain habits. It wasn't like a punishment. I just felt like for us to have a chance to win this game, that was the route we wanted to take."

After starting 3-0, the Lakers have lost four of their last five games and dropped to .500 for the first time this season. They have the third-worst defensive rating (118.8) in the NBA, ahead of only the Toronto Raptors and New Orleans Pelicans.

Following the Lakers' first loss of the season to the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 28, Davis told reporters that Redick was "pissed" in the locker room.

While you appreciate a head coach who cares about the result as much as anyone, you also have to be able to modulate over the course of a full season. That's especially true given how the Lakers are playing right now because they need to find answers for what ails them, particularly on defense.

Redick and the Lakers will have a chance to get back on track Friday when they take on the Philadelphia 76ers (1-6) at Crypto.com Arena.
