History
The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 131-114, with Ja Morant and LeBron James engaging in a heated exchange during the game. The rivalry between the two teams has intensified after the Lakers defeated Memphis in the 2023 playoffs, and the Grizzlies capitalized on the absence of Anthony Davis to secure the win. Morant, who scored 20 points, and James, who led with 39 points, exchanged 'too small' taunts, culminating in Morant receiving a technical foul for shoving James. Despite the on-court tension, James downplayed the altercation, attributing it to competitive spirit. Memphis' victory marks a continuation of their strong performances, improving their season record to 5-4, while the Lakers fell to 4-4.

Ja Morant expressed his disdain for the Lakers, stating, 'I don't like them. They knocked me out of the playoffs.' This rivalry intensified after the Lakers eliminated Memphis in the playoffs last season.
Despite Morant's technical foul for shoving James, LeBron downplayed the incident, saying it was '[water off a duck's back]' and emphasized the competitive nature of the game.
The Grizzlies had three players scoring 20 points in the game: Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and rookie Jaylen Wells, showcasing a strong team performance.
Morant celebrated the victory by posting a GIF of a man doing a Griddy dance, further taunting the Lakers after their defeat.
The Lakers struggled in the absence of Anthony Davis and Rui Hachimura, finishing their road trip at 1-4 and unable to capitalize on Morant's brief exit from the game due to a hamstring injury.
