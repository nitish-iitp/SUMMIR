Kevin Broom detailed the statistical analysis part which is linked above. But to use simpler numbers, Coulibaly played 35 minutes, shot 9-of-16 from the field and 4-of-9 from the three point line. He also grabbed 6 rebounds.

While this will be a long season for Washington, Coulibaly’s development could still make every game entertaining this season.
