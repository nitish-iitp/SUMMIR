The NBA is back, and FanDuel Sportsbook has plenty of ways to get in on the action. To celebrate a pair of matchups on TNT, FanDuel Sportsbook has a special promotion for ALL customers.

All customers get a No Sweat Token to use on any wager for either TNT NBA game taking place on Tuesday, October 29th, 2024!

There are two TNT Tuesdays NBA games tonight, starting with the Dallas Mavericks vs. the Minnesota Timberwolves at 7:40pm ET. Both sides have just one loss entering Tuesday night, and they boast the second and third shortest odds to win the Western Conference. The Timberwolves took last year's regular season series, 3-1, but the Mavericks enacted revenge by ousting Minnesota from the Western Conference Finals.

Tonight's line is Timberwolves -5 and the total is set at 221.5. Full Mavericks-Timberwolves odds can be found below.

Then, at 10:10pm ET, the New Orleans Pelicans take on the Golden State Warriors. Both sides enter with 2-1 records, though the Warriors will be without Stephen Curry due to an injury. Consequently, the line is Pelicans -1.5 and the total is set at 217.5.

Full Pelicans-Warriors odds can be found below, while all NBA odds can be found on FanDuel Sportsbook.
