The Minnesota star heated up for the Timberwolves as he notched double-scoring figures in the opening period with 24 points. His efforts led to him to a career-high for most points in any quarter.

Come the second quarter, Dallas pushed the pace a little bit and took advantage of Edwards' absence in the first few minutes. Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic slightly found their rhythm as they combined for 23 first-half points. Their efforts helped them regain a two-point 61-59 lead.

Mavericks vs. Timberwolves: Recap

Kyrie Irving's His remarkable shooting is what helped the Dallas Mavericks come up with a tight victory on the road. Irving put up 35 points, five assists and four rebounds matched 75% accuracy from beyond the arc and 56.5% overall.

Trying to keep the game alive for Minnesota was Anthony Edwards, who scored 37 points. However, 24 of his total points came from the first quarter alone. Meaning to say, Edwards only scored 13 points for the remainder of the game, indicating his struggle to retake the lead.

It’s worth pointing out that “Ant-Man” dealt with minor problems with his left leg throughout the game. That could’ve been a detrimental factor in why he couldn’t follow up on his hot start.
