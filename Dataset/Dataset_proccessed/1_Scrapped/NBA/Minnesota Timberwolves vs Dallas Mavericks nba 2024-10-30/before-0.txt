NBA Player Props Today For 10/29/24!

Check out some spicy NBA Player Props for 10/29/24! Sportsmemo’s Steve Seagrave drops the best picks for NBA player props today with a a couple stellar suggestions to check out!

WagerTalk, the largest picks site online, offers NBA FREE PICKS every day, as well as cheap premium paid NBA picks from expert professional handicappers.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Anthony Edwards Minnesota Timberwolves Over 26.5 Points (-120) DK

Anthony Edwards has cleared this line in 2 of 3 games to start the season with 27, 32 and 24 points for an average of 27.7 points per game.

Edwards has been very aggressive with 21, 24 and 25 field goal attempts while averaging 12 three-point attempts per game.

When taking 20+ field goal attempts, Edwards has gone over this line in 19 of his last 25 games while landing on 26 twice.

Edwards scored 27+ points in 2 of 3 regular season games against the Dallas Mavericks last season with 34 and 44 points.

Recently we have seen opposing shotting guards thrive against Dallas including Keyonte George 17 points, Collin Sexton 23 pts, Devin Booker 21 pts and Julian Champagnie 18 pts.

We have to expect Edwards to remain aggressive against a Mavericks team that knocked him out of the Western Conference Finals last season.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Draymond Green Golden State Warriors Under 14.5 Points + Assists (-120) FD

Draymond Green has already fallen short of this line in three straight games to open the season with only 11, 7 and 4 Points + Assists.

Now Steph Curry is out with an ankle injury and Green has gone under this number in 14 of the last 19 games without him on the court.

Green has also failed to record 15+ PA in each of his last two and 5 of his last 6 games against the New Orleans Pelicans.

Andrew Wiggins is also questionable for this contest, but Steve Kerr runs a very deep rotation so we shouldn’t see a huge spike in Green’s minutes.

Green has only taken 7 field goal attempts through three games, and he can’t create his own shot so that shouldn’t increase without Curry and/or Wiggins setting him up.
