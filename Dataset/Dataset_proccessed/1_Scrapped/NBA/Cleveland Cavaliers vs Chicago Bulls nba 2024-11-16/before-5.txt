Paul George has not had the greatest of starts with the Philadelphia 76ers. While the versatile wing has looked comfortable with each game, the Sixers are still 1-4 in the five games he's played for his new side. However, with Joel Embiid back in the fold, George and Philly receive a massive two-way boost as they host the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers at the Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

George, who dealt with a bruised knee at the start of the season, later endured a scary eye injury against the Charlotte Hornets. However, he was able to take the floor for the team in their Emirates NBA Cup opener against the New York Knicks. At the time of writing, he was not listed on the NBA's official injury report and is expected to suit up against Donovan Mitchell and co.

How has Paul George fared for the Philadelphia 76ers so far in this NBA 2024-25 season?

Paul George is yet to hit his straps fully this season as the F/G averages 14.3 points on 38.9% shooting from the field along with 4.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.8 steals, and 0.3 blocks in 28.3 minutes per contest. His season-high 29 points came during the team's 111-99 loss to New York. It was also the third game where George played 30+ minutes upon his return from injury.

The 8x NBA All-Star averages 19.0 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 32 games versus the Cleveland Cavaliers in his career. Philadelphia could use another 25+ point night from their offseason acquisition as he finally showed how the F-C combo between him and Embiid can work in the days to come.

The 76ers are yet to see their 'Big 3' of Embiid, George, and Tyrese Maxey take the floor together. Maxey sustained a right hamstring strain last week and will be re-evaluated a week later. Their situation is much akin to that of the Phoenix Suns last season where injuries to Bradley Beal and Devin Booker at the start of the season saw their famed trio miss time together on the court.

Paul George and the 76ers will hit the road for a three-game away stretch following their Cavaliers clash and will return for another three-game homestand. The next six games include two NBA Cup skirmishes, one at home and one away. It remains to be seen if George can return to his All-Star form after giving a glimpse of what a healthy version of him is capable of from his last game.
