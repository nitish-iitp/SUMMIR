The Celtics couldn’t go undefeated, but they wrapped up a terrific preseason with a 119-118 loss to the Toronto Raptors. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown look like they’re in regular season form, and the 2nd unit is ready to step up.

What to Know
Boston finished its preseason with a 4-1 record.
Gradey Dick (27 points) and Scottie Barnes (26 points) led the way for Raptors.
Six Celtics scored in double figures, including Jayson Tatum (24 points) and Derrick White (23 points)
The C's lost by just one point after trailing by 24.
The Celtics have a week off before their regular-season opener against the Knicks on Oct. 22 at TD Garden.

The Boston Celtics came up just short of a perfect preseason after falling to the Toronto Raptors at Scotiabank Arena, 119-118.

The finale came down to the wire after Boston trailed by 24 points in the first half. Reserve guard JD Davison put the C's on top with a clutch 3-pointer in the final seconds, but Toronto hit a pair of free throws with 11.1 seconds left to escape with the win.

Boston will return to the court for its regular-season opener next Tuesday vs. the New York Knicks at TD Garden. Before beginning their title defense, the Celtics will celebrate their 2024 championship with a ring ceremony and the raising of their 18th banner into the rafters.

Check out our live blog for a complete recap of Tuesday's entertaining preseason finale.

Horford impressed with how Kornet, Tillman, and Queta have improved
By Justin Leger

Abby Chin caught up with Al Horford before the Celtics final preseason game to discuss staying healthy, offseason highlights, turning the page from last year and more

While sitting out the first four games of the preseason, Al Horford loved what he saw from his fellow Boston Celtics big men.

The veteran watched as Luke Kornet, Xavier Tillman, and Neemias Queta enjoyed standout performances. Kornet notched 15 points and eight rebounds in the team's blowout win over the Philadelphia 76ers. Tillman shot 6-for-8 from 3-point range over his first three preseason games. Queta tallied 12 points and 15 boards in Sunday's win over the Toronto Raptors.

Before taking the court for Tuesday's preseason finale, Horford heaped praise on the trio for the strides they've made since last season.

"Just been very impressed, just with the improvements with them," Horford told NBC Sports Boston's Abby Chin. "I think it's probably them being a little more comfortable. But Neemy (Neemias Queta) defensively looks really solid. Rebounding the ball very well. Xavier, really shooting the ball extremely well and just seems to continue to get more comfortable with everything we're trying to do. And Luke, just high energy, finishing very well at the rim and protecting the rim for us.

FINAL: Raptors 119, Celtics 118
By Justin Leger
Derrick White finished with 23 points in the Celtics' preseason finale in Toronto.

The Toronto Raptors spoiled the Boston Celtics' hopes of finishing the preseason undefeated. The C's made it interesting after trailing by as many as 24 points, but Toronto did just enough to escape Scotiabank Arena with a hard-fought victory.

Boston took a one-point lead in the final minute on a clutch JD Davison 3-pointer. Davison headlined a strong finish by the Celtics' reserves with 12 points in five minutes.

A Davison foul put the Raptors' D.J. Carton on the free throw line with 11.1 seconds to go. Carton made both free throws and C's guard Jordan Walsh missed what would have been the game-winning layup, sealing Toronto's win.
