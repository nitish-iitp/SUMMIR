*Updated Nov. 16*

Stay up to date with the Warriors' top performers from Week 4 of the 2024-25 regular season, which includes two NBA Cup matchups against the Dallas Mavericks and the Memphis Grizzlies.

Nov. 15, Stephen Curry: Warriors 123 - Grizzlies 118

PTS	REB	STL
13	8	4

Stephen Curry had 13 points, eight rebounds, five assists and four steals in 26 minutes of the Warriors' 123-118 NBA Cup victory over the Memphis Grizzlies at Chase Center on Friday. Curry's four steals tied a season-high and he was able to rest the entire fourth quarter due to the team's 15-point lead after three quarters. He attempted just nine shots and three of his four made field goals were 3-pointers. The other was a heavily contested baseline jumper right before halftime.

Nov. 12, Stephen Curry: Warriors 120 - Mavericks 117

PTS	AST	TS%
37	9	63.36

Stephen Curry scored the final 12 points for the Warriors to will them to a 120-117 victory over Klay Thompson and the Dallas Mavericks at Chase Center on Tuesday. Curry's 28-foot step-back 3-pointer with 27.5 seconds left gave the Warriors a four-point lead and his game-sealing free throws capped a season-high 37-point outing.  

Curry had a complete game, leading all players in points (37) and assists (9) while shooting 60.0 percent from two (9-for-15) and 41.7 percent from three (5-for-12). He also had six rebounds, two blocks and a steal. The Dubs were plus-24 with Curry on the floor and minus-21 when he sat.

"It was fun to match up with Steph," Klay Thompson said after competing against his Splash Brother for the first time in an NBA game. "And it hurts to be on the other side of one of his flurries. The guy got hot at the end and made some ridiculous shots and being on the other end, it sucks.”
