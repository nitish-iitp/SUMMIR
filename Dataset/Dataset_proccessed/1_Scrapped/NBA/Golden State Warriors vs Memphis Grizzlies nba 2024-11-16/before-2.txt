Golden State Warriors guard De’Anthony Melton was due for a big game this season and he finally got one.

De’Anthony Melton helps Warriors beat Thunder thanks to season-high game

Melton was huge for the Warriors as they picked up a decisive 127-116 win over the formidable Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday. The 26-year-old talent scored 19 points on an efficient 5-11 shooting from the field. All five of his makes came from three-point range. However, it was his work on the glass that stood out.

The USC product collected 10 rebounds in Oklahoma City. That fell just one rebound shy of his career-high 11 boards corraled on Jan. 8, 2022, against the Los Angeles Clippers back when he was a member of the Memphis Grizzlies. This marked the seventh time in Melton’s career that he has brought down double-digit rebounds in a game.

This surely came at the right time. He helped the Warriors ride momentum into a Western Conference-leading 8-2 record on the year while making a statement for the first time in his young tenure in the Bay. Both his point and rebounding totals on the affair are season-highs for the California native.

Melton will be a key role player for the Warriors this season

The Warriors have been getting contributions across the board from players who have stepped up at varying times in the year. Buddy Hield has carried the Warriors at their helm while coming off the bench. He got great help from Andrew Wiggins to start the year, as well as Moses Moody in a limited capacity before superstar Stephen Curry began coming alive over Golden State’s last handful of games.

Now it was Melton’s turn to get busy, and his performance against the Thunder proved that he did not have time to fit anything else into his schedule that didn’t include giving Oklahoma City the business. The Dubs are hoping that Melton can play up to this standard consistently throughout the campaign whether he starts or not, and make good on the one-year, $12.82 million contract he signed with the franchise ahead of the current campaign.

Is Mavericks’ Daniel Gafford playing vs. Blazers? Latest injury…

The Dallas Mavericks are hoping to earn their second consecutive win on Thursday in a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Mavs snapped a five-game losing streak with a 118-97 win against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. Injuries continue to be a concern for the team, though. Luka Doncic (left calf strain), Kyrie Irving (lumbar back sprain) and Dante Exum (right wrist surgery) have all been ruled out for Wednesday’s game. Daniel Gafford, who is dealing with a left ankle sprain, is also listed on the injury report. The Mavericks are hoping to have Gafford return as soon as possible. Dallas needs all the help they can get at the moment. Dereck Lively II is a reliable center, but the Mavs feature a tremendous center duo of Lively and Gafford when both players are healthy. Here is everything we know about Daniel Gafford’s injury status for tonight’s game vs. the Trail Blazers. Daniel Gafford’s injury status for Trail Blazers-Mavericks game Gafford is currently listed as questionable due to the aforementioned ankle injury, per the NBA injury report. The 26-year-old center did not play on Tuesday. He has made a big impact while on the floor this season, averaging 11.7 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.4 blocks per game. Gafford is also shooting a league leading 71.8 percent on his field goal attempts. Gafford helps the Mavericks on both ends of the floor. He has continued to improve as a rim-protector, and he also finds ways to score on offense. Gafford is a quality finisher, whether it be via a lob or a self-created look at the basket. The Mavericks will enter play on Thursday with a 21-16 record, while the Blazers are just 13-23. Still, Dallas will not overlook their opponent. When it comes to the question of if Daniel Gafford is playing tonight vs. the Trail Blazers, the answer is maybe.

Vancouver Canucks goalie Thatcher Demko breaks silence on…

Vancouver Canucks goaltender Thatcher Demko returned as the backup after missing two games due to injury. But in conversation with Sportsnet's Ian McIntyre, Demko says after such a long process rehabbing the knee injury that kept him out until early December, dealing with the back spasms that pushed him out recently feels like nothing. Demko's season so far, even beyond injuries, has been up to the high standard he has set for himself, but the 29-year-old says he expected some rust. He says coming back from such a serious injury is new territory for him, but he's confident that he's going to find his A-game again. "This is something I haven't really done before. It's a new path, a new challenge, I think. In some ways it's difficult to kind of put into words... It feels like all the pieces are there. I'm ready to kind of get back to how I was last year. I don't have a doubt that I'll be able to do that." Demko is 2-1-3 with an .881 save percentage since returning from injury in December, last season he posted a .918 save percentage. Thatcher Demko downplays rift Speaking to McIntyre, Demko also addressed the noise around the Canucks and more specifically, Elias Pettersson and J.T Miller. Trade rumors continue to swirl, and five teams could make a move for Pettersson. Although, the price could be quite high. The goaltender said he wanted to "tread lightly" but that he considered the issues to be less about what is supposedly happening in the Canucks dressing room, and more about the fact that the team is underachieving. "People probably wouldn't be talking about all the — quote, unquote — issues in the room if we were winning. So really, it's a winning and losing issue, not an issue of what's going on in the room." If that's the case, Demko getting his game back to where it was last season would go a long way to quieting the chatter.

Report: Chicago Bears make odd request of Ben Johnson

On Monday morning, the Chicago Bears made a formal request to interview Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. The Bears made other requests to interview several head-coaching candidates, including Mike McCarthy and Arthur Smith. Johnson is considered to be one of the top names on the market for the 2025 offseason. He has interviewed for head coaching gigs for the 2023 and 2024 offseasons but wound up remaining with the Lions. There have been mixed reports as to whether Johnson chose not to accept a head-coaching offer or if any such offer was made. There have been multiple reports by ESPN and the NFL Network that Johnson doesn’t interview well. There are also serious questions about Johnson’s ability to lead a team, and whether those questions stem from said poor interviews also remains a possibility. The Bears have questions for Johnson about his ability to lead that they aren’t asking from the rest of the pool of candidates. The Chicago Bears make an odd request of Ben Johnson Per well-known Chicago media figure George Ofman, Chicago is requesting Johnson give the team a “leadership” plan. Other coaches have to provide a plan to work with Caleb Williams. “Told the Bears want Ben Johnson to offer them a leadership plan while other candidates are being asked to present a QB plan,” Ofman posted on X. Veterans want leadership The Bears have a reason to ask Johnson to come up with a leadership plan. Players in the locker room would like their next coach to change the culture and provide discipline. Veteran players like Keenan Allen want a head coach with experience. Johnson lacks head-coaching experience but has a great offensive mind, or so he shows with one of the most talented rosters in the league up in Detroit.

Insider addresses wild Pete Alonso contract request report amid…

New York Mets fans and others within the MLB community were downright shocked when Bob Nightengale of USA Today reported earlier this week that agent Scott Boras had been using the nine-year, $214M deal that former slugger Prince Fielder received from the Detroit Tigers in 2012 as a comparison for what free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso should get this offseason. During Wednesday's edition of his weekly Bleacher Report livestream, MLB insider Jon Heyman directly said that Alonso is "not gonna get a nine-year deal" from the Mets or any other club. "The issue with the Mets is the length of the deal," Heyman said about why Alonso hasn't yet re-signed with what's been his only MLB home since he made his big league debut in 2019, as shared by the SNY website. "Right now we’re looking at Alonso wanting at least a six-year deal." It's now clear no club that began free agency in need of a first baseman was ever willing to give such a deal to Alonso. A handful of teams have already addressed the position via other transactions, and most industry insiders believe the 30-year-old's camp will eventually have to accept a three- or four-year contract that will include multiple opt-outs. "I think the Mets are the most likely team, and I've thought so for a while," Heyman said early into the Bleacher Report clip about Alonso's short-term future. "They have a gaping hole at first base right now...Alonso's out there. They need a first baseman. Ultimately, I think that is the most likely scenario." The Mets need lineup protection for Juan Soto following their historic signing of the All-Star outfielder. Additionally, the fact that Alonso is a beloved fan favorite who is on pace to become the franchise's all-time leader in career home runs cannot be ignored. As recently as Wednesday, former Mets captain and team legend David Wright actively campaigned for Alonso to remain a one-club man for as long as possible. "It’s a different feeling when you’re drafted, developed and playing for the team that gave you your first opportunity," Wright said. Boras and Co. may say it only takes one club to match Alonso's contract requests, but Heyman indicated on Wednesday no such team exists this winter. That reality means that Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns and team owner Steve Cohen should have leverage in negotiations with Boras.
