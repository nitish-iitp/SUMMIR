Getting The First Win, A Style Of Play And Halfcourt Heaves On The Blazers Balcony, Episode 133
Casey Holdahl
October 28, 20248:51 AM PDT

Greetings from Sacramento. After the Trail Blazers got their first win of the season Sunday afternoon versus the Pelicans at Moda Center and after the team arrived in California's capital to face the Kings in the second game of a back-to-back, your humble podcast crew of Brooke Olzendam and I, Casey Holdahl, eschewed post-game rest and relaxation to record a road edition of The Blazers Balcony podcast, which you can listen and subscribe to below...

Topics on this edition include...

• Thoughts on the first three games of the season a Moda Center

• Portland bouncing back from a close loss versus New Orleans on Friday with a comfortable victory versus New Orleans on Sunday

• Our guy Klaus Becker ending the Toyota Halfcourt Shot drought 

• The Trail Blazers doing the things they've been talking about doing

• Brooke's bow, mom walking through stunts, consecutive games rule change suggestions, the deliciousness of the Rogue Rip City IPA, Vibram shoes, pounding beers on the big screen and hotel corgis

You don't want to miss out on any of our expert analysis this season so there is no better time to subscribe to the Blazers Balcony on I think we're really starting to hit our stride so now would be a good time to subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, Youtube, Stitcher, TuneIn, Deezer, Spotify, I Heart Radio,  Pocket Casts and Pandora.
