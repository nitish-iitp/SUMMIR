CURRY AND MELTON TO BE RE-EVALUATED ON FRIDAY AFTER INJURY
Stephen Curry, who exited last night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers with 7:55 remaining in the fourth quarter, underwent an MRI late last night. The MRI showed no structural damage and confirmed the injury as a left peroneal strain. He will be re-evaluated on Friday.

Newly acquired guard De’Anthony Melton, who scored eight points during last night’s game against the Clippers before exiting with 4:25 remaining in the fourth quarter, underwent an MRI on his back postgame last night. The MRI showed no structural damage. He has a strained lower back and will be re-evaluated on Friday. 

Without two of their main ball handlers, the Warriors will turn to second-year guard Brandin Podziemski to assume even more ball handling and playmaking responsibilities.

NEW ORLEANS SCOUTING REPORT
The New Orleans Pelicans are a considerably smaller team than the Warriors' first two opponents, having started 6'8 Daniel Theis at the center position and 6'6 Zion Williamson at power forward. Williamson, however, is a physical force at 284 pounds, using his strength and athleticism to wreak havoc in the paint. The Pelicans are a wing and guard-heavy team, with forward Brandon Ingram and combo guard CJ McCollum as shot creators, forward Herbert Jones and guard Jose Alvarado as defensive stoppers and forward Trey Murphy III and guard Jordan Hawkins as sharpshooting floor spacers. New Orleans lost their lead guard, Dejounte Murray, who they acquired from the Atlanta Hawks this offseason, to a left hand fracture, for which he underwent surgery.
