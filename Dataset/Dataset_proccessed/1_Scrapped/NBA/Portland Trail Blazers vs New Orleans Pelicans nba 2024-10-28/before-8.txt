After playing in a career-high 70 games during the 2023-24 regular season, Zion Williamson’s 2024-25 campaign is beginning with a piece of some very bad luck. The two-time All-Star power forward will not play Wednesday in his club's opener vs. Chicago, due to illness.

New Orleans head coach Willie Green said he is “hopeful” that Williamson will be able to travel with the team to Portland tomorrow. The Pelicans have a Thursday afternoon flight scheduled to the West Coast, ahead of Friday’s 9 p.m. CT road game against the Trail Blazers.

“It’s some type of virus,” Green said on the cause of Williamson’s DNP. “He’s not feeling well. He’s been sick the last couple days.” Green added that Williamson will not be in the Smoothie King Center during the game tonight due to the ailment.

Green said Dejounte Murray (personal reasons) and Jose Alvarado (knee) were planning to warm up tonight on the Smoothie King Center hardwood before finalizing decisions to play vs. Chicago. Murray and Alvarado were both officially upgraded to probable roughly an hour and 40 minutes prior to tip-off.
