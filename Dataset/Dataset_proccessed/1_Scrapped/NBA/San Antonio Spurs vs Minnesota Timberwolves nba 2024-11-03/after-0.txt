San Antonio Spurs

The San Antonio Spurs entered Saturday night’s matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves without several key figures.

Starters Devin Vassell and Tre Jones were sidelined due to injuries, and Coach Gregg Popovich was absent due to feeling unwell. Despite these absences, the Spurs delivered a dominant performance, defeating the Timberwolves 113-103 in a game they controlled from start to finish.

Keldon Johnson led the scoring effort with an impressive 25 points, while Victor Wembanyama contributed 17 points, six rebounds, and two blocks, showing off his versatility on both ends of the floor. Chris Paul also played a pivotal role, recording 15 points and dishing out 13 assists.
