Coby White's 28 points not enough as Bulls hand Jazz first win of season | CHGO Bulls Postgame
MATT PECK
NOVEMBER 5, 2024

The CHGO Bulls crew break down the Chicago Bulls 135-126 loss to the Utah Jazz on Monday night. The Bulls gave up the most points to any opponent thus far this season to a Jazz team that came in2to tonight averaging a league-worst 99.8 points per game. Matt, Big Dave and Will Perdue discuss the factors that led to the Bulls giving up a game to the previously winless Jazz missing both Lauri Markkanen and Jordan Clarkson. Plus, Ayo Dosunmu performed well starting in place of Zach LaVine. Will Gottlieb joins from the United Center to offer his thoughts on the game and insights from the Postgame locker room.
