The Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns meet for a second time on NBA TV in L.A. as the Clippers attempt to climb above .500.

Los Angeles is 2-2 on the season with one of its losses coming against Phoenix in the season opener (116-113 OT). The Clippers won two straight at Denver (10-9-104) and Golden State (112-104) before dropping the most recent outing to Portland (106-105). The Clippers have relied heavily on Norman Powell (two 30-point games) and three straight games of Zubac with at least 12 boards without Kawhi Leonard.

The Phoenix Suns are 3-1 on the season and coming off a two-game homestand where they earned a close win over the Lakers (109-105) and a 114-102 win versus Dallas. Kevin Durant joined the 29,000-point club recently, becoming the 8th player to join the club. Durant has scored at least 30 points in three straight games.

With that said, let’s dive into the matchup and offer some information and possibly a sweat or two.

We’ve got all the info and analysis you need to know ahead of the game, including the latest info on how to catch the opening tip, projected lineups, recent team performance, player stats, and of course, our predictions, picks & best bets for the game from our modeling tools and staff of experts.

NBC Sports Bet Best Bet

Vaughn Dalzell (@VmoneySports) likes Devin Booker to go Over 24.5 points against the Clippers:

“In the first meeting between these two teams, Devin Booker recorded six assists and shot 5-of-9 from the field for 15 points, while dealing with foul trouble (fouled out in 4th).

The Suns won that game on the road in OT (116-113) without Booker. Since then, Booker scored 23, 21, and 33 points against the Lakers twice and the Mavericks. Booker is coming off 33 points versus the Lakers and had 23 field goal attempts with eight free throws.

This is a road game back in L.A. where he already experienced the new crowd and with recent shot volume, I like Booker Over 24.5 Points at -110 odds.”

Here are the best bets our model is projecting for the Suns and the Clippers:

· Moneyline: NBC Sports finds value in taking the Suns ML (-185)
· Spread: NBC Sports has confidence in Phoenix on the spread
· Total: NBC Sports has low confidence towards a play on the Total UNDER 221.0 points
