SERIES NOTES

Blazers center Robert Williams III finished with 19 points, 9 rebounds, 3 steals, 3 blocks on 90% shooting. He is just the second player in NBA history to record 15 points, 3 steals and 3 blocks on 90% shooting or better while coming off the bench (James Worthy 1983).
Tuesday was full of both season and career-highs as the Trail Blazers improved to 1-0 in the 2024 NBA Cup.
Jerami Grant recorded a career-high eight assists
Toumani Camara hit a career-high four three-pointers
Robert Williams III finished with 19 points on 9-of-10 from the field to go with nine boards, three assists, three steals and three blocks. He was one rebound shy of his first double-double as a Blazer, and two points shy of a career-high in scoring
Deni Avdija scored a season-high 17
Portland recorded season-highs in 3PM (18), 3P% (56.3), assists (29) and steals (14)
Portland’s 56.3% from deep is an NBA season-high
Seven Blazers scored in double-figures, a season-high
Blazers held the Timberwolves to 17 first quarter points, just the fourth time Portland has held an opponent to under 20 in a quarter this season
Minnesota’s loss last night to Portland marked the first time this season the Timberwolves had lost consecutive games. The Timberwolves only lost consecutive games four times last season and never lost more than two straight in the regular season. The Timberwolves did lose three straight twice in the playoffs (Denver, Dallas)
The Timberwolves finished the 2023-24 in season tournament with a 3-1 record, but a point differential of 0. That point differential stood in the way of Minnesota advancing to the knockout stage, as the Phoenix Suns also finished 3-1 but were +34 through their four group stage showings.
