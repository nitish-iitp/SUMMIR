Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best picks on Wednesday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Luka Dončić (DAL, PG)	$22,710	56.5	2.5
Value	Daniel Gafford (DAL, C)	$10,520	29.9	2.8
Fade	Buddy Hield (GSW, SG/SF)	$11,970	18.4	1.5
Cheapie	Donovan Clingan (POR, C)	$6,000	16.8	2.8

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your NBA Wednesday Late teams, consider starting with a value player like Daniel Gafford. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Luka Dončić is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Donovan Clingan.

On the other hand, according to our model, Buddy Hield is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
