Hornets Take Too Long To Respond In Rematch Loss To Boston
Ball Navigates Foul Trouble for 36 PTS, Miller Returns, Opposing Free Throws Pile Up Again

Following 40-and-a-half minutes of action on Friday night, the Charlotte Hornets were right there with the Boston Celtics before a late-game meltdown scuttled their chances at winning. Unfortunately, they might have let that messy finish carry over just a tad too much into Saturday’s rematch at Spectrum Center, which ended with another hard-fought 113-103 loss.

Top Performers: Weaving through some more early foul trouble, LaMelo Ball went off again for 36 points – 15 in the second quarter – on 15-of-26 shooting, six 3-pointers, four rebounds, six assists and three steals. Additionally, he joined some rather elite company in Steph Curry (5x) as the second NBA player to ever record 30+ 3-pointers in his team’s first six games of the season.

Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 29 points on 7-of-15 shooting, sinking only 1-of-9 shots from behind the arc. Still, he made up for it at the charity stripe (14-of-17), marking his third consecutive outing with at least 13 free-throw attempts (20 total in his first four games). 

Turning Point: Trailing 58-40 at halftime, the Hornets ripped off a 17-2 run in the opening four minutes of the third, quickly slicing Boston’s lead from 18 down to three. This burst got the Celtics’ attention, as they collected themselves and won the rest of the frame, 15-7. Charlotte kept battling over the final 12 minutes but couldn’t muster another game-shifting stretch. 

Not the Start the Hornets Needed

Forced to use smaller lineups without centers Mark Williams and Nick Richards, Charlotte’s defense was all out of sorts in the first quarter and surrendered 38 Celtic points on 54.2% shooting. Though the Hornets got more organized as the game progressed, Boston capitalized on the size advantage to win the glass by 10 (44-34) and scored efficiently in the pick-and-roll. 

Fouling Continues to Be Problematic

Just like in Friday’s loss, the free-throw discrepancy was significant and decisive, with Boston knocking down 25-of-28 attempts (89.3%), while Charlotte went only 6-of-9 (66.7%; all in the first half). Much of it came down to just lack of focus and undisciplined play, but on the bright side, the Hornets didn’t let any calls or non-calls rattle them like they did in the first game.

Brandon Miller Back on the Court

One silver lining for the hosts was the return of last year’s Rookie of the Year runner-up Brandon Miller, who missed the team’s past four games with a left glute strain. Once the rust was shaken off, Miller found his groove and finished the game with 16 points on 6-of-18 shooting (10 points on 4-of-10 in the second half), four rebounds, and six assists, one shy of tying his career best.

Postgame Quote

“I’m extremely happy with the group that came to the floor in the second half. We won the second half by eight points. There are no consolation prizes or anything, but the competitive level we had to get back into the game… I thought in the first half, we actually had some pretty good looks. The Celtics did a good job just punishing us for a bad rotation or a bad execution on a pick-and-roll coverage. They capitalized on a lot of those opportunities. In the second half, we just did a better job of tightening the screws.” – Hornets Head Coach Charles Lee

What’s Next?

The Hornets will head north for a one-game trip to face the new-look Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday, Nov. 4 beginning at 9 PM ET on the FanDuel Sports Network. In las year’s head-to-head season series, the road team went 2-0, with both meetings decided by six-or-fewer points.
