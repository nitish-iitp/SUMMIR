The Sacramento Kings are 1-2 since naming Doug Christie their interim head coach, and there have been a few interesting differences after moving on from Mike Brown.

Brenden Nunes, Frankie Cartoscelli, and Chris Watkins evaluated Sacramento’s recent production, some interesting comments from Christie, Fox, and Sabonis, their continued interest in trading for Cameron Johnson (Brooklyn Nets), and more.

It’s early into the Doug Christie era for this 2024-25 Kings squad. Still, there have been some noteworthy comments and moments involving their new interim, even some rotational differences with him starting Keon Ellis.

Also, Sacramento continues to be heavily linked in conversations with the Brooklyn Nets about forward Cameron Johnson. The Return of the Roar trio broke down what a potential deal could look like, if it could be too expensive, and potential pivots if those discussions were to fall through.

All that and plenty more on the latest episode!
