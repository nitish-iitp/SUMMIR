LAST TIME OUT
The Warriors fell to Pacers on the second night of a back-to-back 108-96 in Indiana on Friday. The Warriors were down six rotation players, including their top three point-per-game scorers. After snapping the Pistons' five-game winning streak in Detroit, the Dubs could not end the Pacers' winning streak as it extends to five games. The Warriors remained within striking distance for much of the game, including pulling to within four points in the fourth quarter, but Tyrese Haliburton (25 points) and Pascal Siakam (25 points) combining for 50 points was too much to overcome. Haliburton (8-for-10 FG, 10 AST) and Siakam (12-for-16 FG, 10 REB) both shot 75 percent or better from the field and recorded double-doubles. » Full Game Recap
