New Orleans Pelicans star forward Zion Williamson is out indefinitely with a left hamstring strain.

Imaging taken Saturday morning confirmed the injury. Though the team did not provide a timetable for Williamson’s return, ESPN reported he will be re-evaluated “in the coming weeks”.

Williamson has averaged 22.7 points, 8.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists while playing in just six of the Pelicans’ first 10 games. He missed the season opener with an undisclosed illness and missed three of New Orleans’ previous four games with various injuries, including left hamstring tightness that kept him out of Friday’s 115-88 loss to the host Orlando Magic.

Williamson, a two-time All-Star, played a career-best 70 games last season and averaged 22.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and a career-high 5.0 assists. He appeared in just 114 games over his first four seasons due to an assortment of injuries, including a foot ailment that kept him out of the entire 2021-22 season.

Williamson, 24, has career averages of 24.6 points and 6.6 rebounds in 190 games with New Orleans since he was the No 1 overall pick in the 2019 draft.
