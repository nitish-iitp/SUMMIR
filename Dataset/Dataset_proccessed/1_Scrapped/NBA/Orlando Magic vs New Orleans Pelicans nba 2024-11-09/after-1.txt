NEW ORLEANS PELICANS
Zion Williamson Out Indefinitely for Pelicans with Hamstring Injury

The injury woes continue for New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson continue as a hamstring injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future.

New Orleans announced on Saturday that Williamson was diagnosed with a strained hamstring that will keep him out indefinitely.

The New Orleans Pelicans announced today that forward Zion Williamson has been diagnosed with a left hamstring strain. Medical imaging taken this morning confirmed the injury.

Williamson has already missed four of the Pelicans' first 10 games this season due to various ailments. He sat out the opener due to an illness before playing in five straight games.

A hamstring injury kept Williamson out of action in three of the last four games, including Friday's loss to the Orlando Magic. Hamstring issues are turning into a persistent problem for the two-time All-Star.

It was a hamstring injury that soured what had been the best game of Williamson's NBA career against the Los Angeles Lakers in the play-in tournament last season. He scored 40 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in 37 minutes before suffering the injury in the fourth quarter.

Williamson wound up missing the second play-in game against the Sacramento Kings and the entire first-round series loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

This Pelicans season is in danger of being ruined by injuries to key players. Dejounte Murray suffered a fractured hand in the season opener against the Chicago Bulls that will keep him out for at least four to six weeks.

Losing Williamson for an extended period of time again leaves the Pelicans without a lot of creative playmakers on offense. The 24-year-old ranks second on the team in scoring average (22.7), tied for first in rebounding (8.0) and second in assists (5.3).

Jeremiah Robinson-Earl will likely remain in the starting lineup for head coach Willie Green until Williamson can return.
