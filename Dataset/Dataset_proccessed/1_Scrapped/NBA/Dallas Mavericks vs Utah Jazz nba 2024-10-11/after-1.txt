DALLAS — Klay Thompson made his NBA preseason debut with the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night, scoring 10 points in his new team’s 107-102 loss to the Utah Jazz.

It was Thompson’s first NBA game in anything other than a Golden State uniform. He played 11 seasons with the Warriors, not counting the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons that he missed with injuries, and helped Golden State win four NBA championships.
