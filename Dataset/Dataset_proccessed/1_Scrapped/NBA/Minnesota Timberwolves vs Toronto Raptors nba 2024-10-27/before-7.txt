Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best picks on Sunday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Victor Wembanyama (SAS, C)	$18,610	61.4	3.3
Value	Stephon Castle (SAS, PG)	$6,000	28	4.7
Fade	Jaren Jackson (MEM, C/PF)	$14,140	27.4	1.9
Cheapie	Scotty Pippen (MEM, PG)	$6,000	26	4.3

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K

Conclusion

When building your NBA Sunday teams, consider starting with a value player like Stephon Castle. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Victor Wembanyama is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Scotty Pippen.

On the other hand, according to our model, Jaren Jackson is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
