Is this why NBA viewership is down?

There's been a lot of speculation as to why NBA viewership is down. It's either that the stars aren't playing as much, the All-Star Game is beyond saving, or that the game has gone soft and there's a lack of competitive fire. The popular take is that there are too many 3-pointers – it's ruining the game because everyone plays the same way and there's no more high-flying buckets. 

If you're a believer in the 3-point argument, look no further than the Chicago Bulls and the Charlotte Hornets. 

Two weeks ago (Dec. 13), the Bulls and Hornets set an NBA record when they combined for 75 missed 3-pointers in their game. Last night the two teams played each other again – and missed 75 3-pointers again.

For The Second Time THIS MONTH, The Bulls and Hornets Tied The NBA All-Time Record For Combined Missed 3's In A Game with SEVENTY FIVE https://t.co/2fRMUfLqmv pic.twitter.com/nvjvnTX1dI

This isn't the first time the Bulls missed 42 3s. On Nov. 17 in a game vs. Houston Rockets, the Bulls were unable to overcome their poor shooting and lost 143-107. 

Despite having these record-setting misses, the Bulls are second in the league in 3-pointers made (543) and second in 3-pointers taken. Right in front of them is the Boston Celtics with 590 made 3. The Bulls are also ranked tenth in 3-point percentage (37.2%) while the Celtics are ranked No. 15 (36.4%).

Zach LaVine has greatly benefited from this 3-point focused offense. Not only is LaVine scoring leader of the team (22.0 points per game), he is the franchise leader in 3-pointers made (1,087). 

At 15-18, the Bulls are fourth in the Central Division and ninth in the Eastern Conference. Their ugly style of play has them ranked seventh in points per game (117.6) but it has also been the reason why they win. Maybe this is why fans have become turned off by the current product of the game.

2025 Navy All-American Bowl: Houston 2026 commit Keisean Henderson named MVP after dazzling performance

SAN ANTONIO — The theme for the 25th edition of the Navy All-American Bowl was that this was the biggest NAAB to date, and Saturday's 13-7 West victory lived up to the billing. In front of a NAAB record 23,213 spectators inside the Alamodome, the physically largest roster to date went to war in an ultra-competitive slugfest.

While the defenses were dominant throughout the contest, Houston commit Keisean Henderson stole the show, creating magic through the air and on the ground en route to totaling 146 passing yards on 3-of-5 passing and four carries for 30 sack-adjusted rushing yards. Much of the talk entering the week of action surrounded the 2025 NAAB being the first edition of the game to allow juniors to compete alongside seniors. So it's fitting that one of the most dynamic talents in the 2026 class used the high-profile event on NBC to launch himself into further stardom entering the offseason.

Arguably the play of the game, Henderson broke the deadlock late in the second quarter with a slick move in the pocket to avoid a rusher before effortlessly launching a ball on the move to a wide-open Jalen Cooper for a 91-yard touchdown. The four-star athlete led the West squad to points on two of his three drives on the day, and provided four explosive of 20 yards or more including the longest run of the game.

In an interview earlier this week with 247Sports national recruiting analyst Mike Roach, the No. 15 prospect in the 2026 recruiting cycle spoke in depth about his relationship with Houston coach Willie Fritz.

"I love coach Fritz with all my heart," Henderson said. "Coach Fritz, (quarterbacks) coach (Shawn) Bell, everyone from the coaching staff to the training staff and everyone else in the room that makes the world go around at U of H. I'm in awe of everything they've got going on, especially with the rebuild they have going on.

"I know coach Fritz, he's one of those coaches that when his back is against the wall, all he knows how to do is fight. Near the end of the season he showed me there's a switch that needs to be flipped and I feel like I'm one of the guys that can flip that switch."

Some of the previous winners of the All-American Bowl MVP include Bryce Young, Vince Young, Dorial Green-Beckham, Joe Mixon, Ronald Powell, Terrelle Pryor, DeSean Jackson and Beanie Wells.
