The Philadelphia 76ers pay a visit to the Orlando Magic at the Kia Center on Friday night. Here’s a Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic Prediction. This article will include a Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic Pick.
Philadelphia 76ers 
The Philadelphia 76ers have struggled to get out of first gear this season as they've lost nine of their first 11 games overall and they will be hoping to avoid a third straight defeat after getting beaten by the Cavaliers in a 114-106 loss on Wednesday. Jared McCain led the team with 34 points and 10 assists on 12 of 26 shooting, Kelly Oubre Jr added 20 points while Caleb Martin chipped in with 18 points. As a team, the 76ers shot 44 percent from the field and 14 of 43 from the 3-point line as they played great defense to take the lead into halftime after restricting the Cavaliers to just 17 points in the second quarter, but they couldn't maintain that effort and leaked 66 points in the second half to become yet another victim of the Cavaliers' undefeated run. 
Orlando Magic 
Meanwhile, the Orlando Magic are starting to heat up as they are now gunning for a fifth straight victory after sneaking past the Pacers in a 94-90 home win on Wednesday. Franz Wagner led the team with 29 points and six assists on nine of 24 shooting, Goga Bitadze added 12 points with 12 rebounds and two blocks while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with 10 points, five rebounds, and three assists. As a team, the Magic shot 40 percent from the field and 13 of 38 from the 3-point line as they struggled to find their offensive rhythm and trailed for most of the contest, but they kept within striking distance and played great defense to hold the Pacers to just 18 points in the fourth quarter to extend their win streak to four games. Jalen Suggs had a forgettable night as he shot just two of 15 from the field to finish with eight points. 
Why the Orlando Magic will win
The Magic have won each of their last 24 games at Kia Center against teams that held a losing record.
The 76ers have lost seven of their last eight games.
The Magic have covered the spread in 17 of their last 18 games as home favorites against Eastern Conference opponents.
The 76ers have failed to cover the spread in nine of their last 11 night games.
Total Points Facts
Each of the Magic's last six games as home favorites following a home win have gone UNDER the total points line.
Each of the 76ers' last five games as underdogs following a home loss have gone OVER the total points line.
Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic Prediction
 
The 76ers are still shorthanded with Tyrese Maxey already out and they have Andre Drummond listed as questionable, while the Magic are still missing Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. The 76ers have most of their starting lineup intact, but it's going to take a bit of time before we see both George and Embiid firing on all cylinders for the 76ers, so I am sticking with the shorthanded Magic to take advantage and come away with their fifth straight win.
