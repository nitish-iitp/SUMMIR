Busy weekend, Knicks fans. No time for hyperbole—here’s the Knickerbocker schedule for the week of November 10–16, 2024.

Sunday, November 10, 2024: Knicks at Indiana Pacers, 5:00 PM

Today! The Knicks (4-4) will visit Gainbridge Fieldhouse to face the Pacers (4-5). Read our preview here. New York’s Karl-Anthony Towns, averaging 24.3 PPG and 12.8 RPG, will square off with Indiana’s Pascal Siakam, 20.7 PPG and 6.3 RPG. The Knicks’ defense, allowing 108.6 PPG, will be tested against the Pacers’ high-scoring offense (114.4 PPG). Haliburton scored a big fat zip (zero, zilch, nada) when these two clubs met in October. He’ll try for 30 points today.

Tuesday, November 12, 2024: Knicks at Philadelphia 76ers, 7:30 PM (TNT)

Right . . . almost forgot about the Emirates NBA Cup. The Knicks face the 76ers in their first game of the tournament before a national audience. This divisional rivalry game carries extra weight because it should see the return of currently suspended Joel Embiid. Philly should also have fellow All-Star Paul George but not rising star Tyrese Maxey (hamstring). As of this writing, the Sixers are holding down the bottom of the conference with a 1-7 record. Reads like a win for the Knicks on paper, but beware a trap.

Wednesday, November 13, 2024: Knicks vs. Chicago Bulls, 7:30 PM

To kick off a four-game homestand, the Knicks will host the Chicago Bulls in the first of a back-to-back. This game will test New York’s depth and stamina, as the Bulls are all run-and-gun (second in pace). Soft on D, though. Having played the previous night, fresh legs will be needed, so expect increased minutes from the Knicks’ bench players, Miles McBride, rookie Tyler Kolek, and Cameron Payne (if his hammy’s healthy). Even if they’re a little laggy, the Knicks’ home-court crowd, potent shooting, and superior defense should carry them over the mediocre Bulls.

Friday, November 15, 2024: Knicks vs. Brooklyn Nets, 7:30 PM

Friday night Knicks! I kinda want Robert Randolph’s orange and blue Transitions lenses. Anyhoo, the week concludes with another In-Season Tournament game, this time against crosstown rivals the Brooklyn Nets. As of this writing, the two teams have similar records, thanks to Brooklyn’s Cam Thomas averaging 25 points per game. Of course he does—he fires 20 shots per game. Surely Cam, playing in his fourth season, will want to peacock under the brighter lights of the Mecca . . . but the Knicks should dispatch his club without too much effort. Following this tilt, the two teams play at MSG again on Sunday. That will be all the Cam Thomas I can stand for a while.

Enjoy your week. Go Knicks.
