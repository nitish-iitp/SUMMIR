With starting point guard Tyrese Maxey sidelined, Jared McCain stepped into a larger role for the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night during their 2024 Emirates NBA Cup opener against the New York Knicks. While McCain has yet to start a game this season, Maxey’s absence has given him a bigger role.

McCain came off the bench once again, tallying 23 points, three rebounds and two assists. Despite his efforts, the Knicks secured a 111-99 victory.

Below are Jared McCain's complete stats:

Joel Embiid made his season debut, contributing 13 points, five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes, while Paul George led the 76ers with 29 points and 10 rebounds.

The Knicks had six players in double figures, with OG Anunoby scoring 24, Karl-Anthony Towns adding 21 points and 13 rebounds and Josh Hart posting a triple-double with 14 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.

With Tyrese Maxey out, Jared McCain says he’s ready to step up

According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Tyrese Maxey will be out for a couple of weeks with a right hamstring injury, setting the stage for rookie Jared McCain to take on a larger role.

Following the news of Maxey’s injury, McCain expressed his readiness for increased responsibility.

"Next man up, always,” he said via Sixers Wire. “Obviously, you don't [want] anybody hurt, but I think it's an opportunity to show any kind of minutes I can get, and whether I step on the floor a minute, 30 seconds, 10 minutes to try and play as hard as I can each time."

In his first two games stepping in for Maxey, McCain averaged 22.5 points, 2.0 assists and 2.0 rebounds per game.

"I think I'm pretty comfortable," McCain said. "I think defensively is the one thing I'm still trying to get more and more comfortable, different coverages, different players we're playing, but I think I'm getting more comfortable. Always staying confident."

A skilled shot-maker, McCain was selected by Philadelphia with the No. 16 pick in the 2024 NBA draft. In his single season at Duke, he earned a spot on the 2023-24 ACC All-Rookie Team and received an All-ACC Honorable Mention.
