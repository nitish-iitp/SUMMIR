Blowing a 15-Point Lead, the Spurs Fall to the Bulls 114-110, Slipping to 10th in the Tight Western Conference Race

The Spurs blew a 15 point fourth quarter lead enroute to a 114-110 road loss to Chicago Monday night. The loss is the the sixth straight loss to the Bulls spanning the last three seasons.

Trailing the bulk of the game, and by as many as 19 points in the second half, Chicago took their first lead 111-110 following a layup by Colby White with 47 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The bulls were Led by Zach Levine’s 35 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists. Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 11 boards, and White finished with 23 points.

The Spurs had 17 turnovers leading to 19 points for Chicago including a crucial one by Devin Vassel with 32 seconds remaining and the Spurs trailing 111-110.

Despite another huge defensive night from VDub, the Silver and Black were dominated in the paint 54-40 as well. VDub was two blocks shy of a triple-double as he led the team with 23 points, 14 rebounds, and eight blocks. Chris Paul added 18 points and nine assists in the loss.

The Spurs missed an opportunity to maintain their position in the standings in a very tight and jumbled Western Conference. Instead, the loss drops the squad two places from eighth place to tenth.

Monday’s game was the first of a four game road swing which includes stops in Milwaukee and a two game home stand in Los Angeles against the Lakers. The Spurs are 6-10 on the road on the season.
