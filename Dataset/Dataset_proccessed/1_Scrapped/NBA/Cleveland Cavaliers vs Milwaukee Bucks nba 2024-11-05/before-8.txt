LeBron James stats tonight: How did the 4x NBA champ fare vs Pistons (Nov. 4)

LeBron James recorded a double-double in the LA Lakers' shocking 115-103 loss to the Detroit Pistons at the Little Ceasars Arena on Monday (Nov. 4). The four-time NBA champion finished with 20 points, eight rebounds, and 11 assists. His effort, combined with Anthony Davis' 37-point performance, wasn't enough to get LA past the Pistons.

The veteran forward had 14 points as the Lakers trailed Detroit 67-53 at halftime. He was 5-9 from the field and 1-1 from beyond the arc while recording five rebounds and as many assists. James shot 7-16 from the field and 1-2 from beyond the arc by the end of the game.

They were outplayed 33-22 and 34-31 in the first two quarters. Tim Hardaway Jr. and Tobias Harris led the charge for the Pistons with 13 points each before the break. Overall, Jaden Ivey (26 points) and Cade Cunningham's fourth-quarter burst (17 points) were enough to help the Pistons land their third win of the season.

A lack of defense, physicality and turnovers cost the Lakers the game. LA is now 4-3 in the West.

Familiar issues plague Lakers despite LeBron James and Anthony Davis' dominance

The Lakers struggled with turnovers and 3-point shooting on Monday — familiar issues that showed up each time they were under the pump. LeBron James and Anthony Davis proved to be forces on both ends of the floor, but the team was far too reliant on its two superstars.

Their defense, currently 27th in the league, is an indictment of their early struggles.

LA gets a day's break before heading West to take on the Memphis Grizzlies at the FedEx Forum. They are 1-3 in their five-game road trip and will hope to close things out with a win before their three-game homestand at the Crypto.com Arena.

They will also be concerned about Anthony Davis, who injured his foot late in the game. The big man played through the injury but labored up and down the floor.
