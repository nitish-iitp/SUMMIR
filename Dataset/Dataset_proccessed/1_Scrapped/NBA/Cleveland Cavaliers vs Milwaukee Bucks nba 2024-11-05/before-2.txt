Its an interesting situation because I don't think anyone wants Middleton or Dame's contract so they might have to use Giannis or some of the proceeds they get for him to off-load them.

I'm assuming Giannis gives the Bucks a list of teams and they trade him to the one offering the best package. Then they either ride out Dame and Middleton with a treasure chest of picks + prospects or they try to use some of that return to off-load them.

Players are not the problem, the coach is the problem. The same players were playing great with the previous coach, even though players were not that much happy with him. LOL

they caught lightning in a bottle years ago but now their bench is awful, they're much older and they've got one of the biggest frauds in coaching history so it's time for Giannis to be allowed to go elsewhere. He's given all that organization deserves. If they were smart they could get a ridiculous package back in a trade. Moving Dame wouldn't be a problem either. Middleton can be a tank commander until he too can be moved. The problem is NBA G.M.s are cowards and wait too long to make moves or don't make all the moves necessary with half-measures. Giannis and the Bucks can make this work so that everyone wins. I hope it happens before Giannis is forced to make a demand because then everyone loses and returns for him and Dame will get worse.

36.7% looks decent but with one game being 10-15 it means it is terrible in all the other games.

Sure, if you ignore the other 6/12 game lol.

Even if he shot a minimum 50% from 3 in every game, not a single game would flip.
What an absolute failure and disaster this franchise is, ran by one of the most incompetent front offices in the league.

I mean, the Knicks also have the ability to trade for him, but like you said, you like your roster so you're choosing to pass on him. Same principle applies to the Thunder.

OKC's main offensive system is creating space around Shai's drives so he can roam inside. Any talk of Giannis to OKC is just hilarious to me simply because of that.


I really dont think we have the same ability to trade for him. We may have the big contract but we dont have the picks ....or even the same caliber of young talent wed be willing to give up.


Knicks are going very well right now with KAT, and the chemistry is very well with Thibs and his new team mates.

I think the Knicks like OKC should stick with their core and not risk the apple cart so to speak by trading for Giannis.

Walker Kessler is someone the Knicks realistically should target, although seems to that relations between Ainge and the Knicks Front Office is strained

He's gonna get to do rebuild. No chance they fire him. If you were gonna blow it up. Do the Pels and Bucks make some swaps. Seems like an interesting pairing,
Miami / Chicago / London

Really, you guys just need a 3rd option and Brook has started the ceiling ice cold.

Dame has 26.2 PPG on 62.5% TS, he's doing what he's paid to do. He's not the issue.

Once Middleton gets back you'll go on a run simply because you won't be playing bench players, starter minutes.

Giannis is not getting traded this year. Bucks had these last two games to the cavs went down the wire and this one without Giannis and Middleton hasn’t played yet. Doc finally playing the youngsters green had 21 and Ajax defense and energy are difference makers. 75 games to go plenty of time to turn this around I know you all don’t want to see that lol

Your record without Middleton last season was better than with him.

He's not moving the needle much(if at all).

Having a legitimate 3rd option is a huge deal. He could have made the difference in a couple of these losses. The issue is anyone thinking he makes a difference as a contender. This isn't even about Khris, the Bucks just look completely outclassed on that end.

Sure the East is a bit of a sh#tshow but it is more likely they get knocked out in the first round than going to the ECF.

At least as things stand now, you never know what kind of trade shenanigans can occur before the deadline. I know they are tapped out for assets but who knows.

The Bucks have nowhere to go. They don't have their own picks for a long time and have no trade flexibility. They went all in on the current core, then dropped the ball with their coaching hires. Adrian Griffin was bad but they replaced him with a worse coach.

They have to figure out a way with this core. I think they should fire Doc and hire a proper coach first. There's no reason you can't build an elite offense off Giannis and Lillard. They do have shooters surrounding them, it's just that nothing flows well and everyone gets cold. They don't leverage the players' strengths right now.

One aspect of this that is being understated is Giannis' decline on defense. He's nowhere near the DPOY level defender he used to be. He's not deputizing for everyone out there the way he used to. The effort isn't there. So part of it is on him. Their perimeter defense sucks, so it becomes even more important for Giannis to cover space on defense.

Bud is one of the best coaches on the league. Doc is one of the worst. I guarantee that Bud would have figured out how to make Giannis + Dame work.



I'm not disagreeing with this, obviously Bud is a great coach and much better. But it's not all him. half the difference in wins is Jrue to Dame.

I think they have to entertain any offers for Dame and Middleton but I suspect no one will want them at their age which leaves Giannis as the big piece to dangle while he's still in his prime because he's a player that almost entirely depends on his power and speed & his game is not one that will age gracefully like KD and LBJ.

He really needs to kick like 5% of his earnings to Garnett Pierce and Allen.
