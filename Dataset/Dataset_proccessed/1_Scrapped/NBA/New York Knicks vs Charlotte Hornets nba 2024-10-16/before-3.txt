Barcelona vs Monaco: Analysis and Prediction – Barcelona will play at home against Monaco in the EuroLeague Round 3.

Barcelona Team News

Barcelona hasn’t been entirely convincing at the start of the new season, and it seems Joan Penarroya will need some time before successfully implementing all his ideas with the team. They suffered a surprising defeat to Zalgiris in their EuroLeague opener, followed by a near fourth quarters struggle to overcome a weak Alba Berlin.

Based on what we’ve seen so far, it appears that Barcelona is slowly adjusting to the new coach’s demands. One of the former players, Nikola Kalinic, recently pointed out that under Roger Grimau, there was a lack of accountability in the game, something that is clearly being addressed this season. However, improvements can’t happen overnight, and it’s likely that results will suffer in October. In crucial moments, Penarroya relies on experienced players like Nicolas Laprovittola, Tomas Satoransky, Jan Vesely, Jabari Parker and Alex Abrines, who have been playing together for some time and know each other well. Kevin Punter has slowed down Barcelona’s offense, and integrating him will be crucial. If they get quality contributions from him, the Catalans can go far. If the new players like Punter, Chimezie Metu, and Juan Nunez don’t step up, they could be in for another long season.

One advantage for Barcelona in this match will be their deeper rotation. Additionally, Blaugrana is known for being a fortress, making it very difficult for opponents to win there. The Catalans always maintain a high level of defensive intensity when playing in front of their home crowd, and they never lack offensive talent. It will be essential for the frontcourt to step up, with Vesely, Hernangomez, and Fall expected to have the upper hand over Monaco’s big men.

Monaco Team News

Monaco is one of the four teams that remain unbeaten after two rounds in the EuroLeague, securing victories at home against Milano and Maccabi Tel Aviv. They travel to Catalonia aiming to stay at the top of the standings after Round 3.

Following the win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, Monaco fans received some good news: Jordan Loyd has returned to the club, reuniting with Mike James and Elie Okobo to form an elite backcourt. These three players were the team’s main strength in the past and are now back together. Head coach Sasa Obradovic mentioned after Furkan Korkmaz’s injury that they were actively looking for a new backcourt player on the market, and Loyd is certainly the best solution. Due to the new EuroLeague rule, Loyd will be available from this round and ready to help Monaco. Jaron Blossomgame is making the most of the opportunities created by John Brown’s departure, and Mam Jaiteh looks much improved from last season. Donatas Motiejunas is maintaining his usual high level, and Georgios Papagiannis’ integration into the new system is progressing well.

When James is at his best, Monaco can beat any team in Europe, on any court. To defeat Barcelona away, James will need to be at his peak. If Monaco can get him going, it will create more space for shooters like Okobo, Diallo, Blossomgame, and Strazel, thereby increasing their chances of victory.

Barcelona vs Monaco H2H

Monaco won both matchups against Barcelona last season and currently holds a three-game winning streak over them.

Absences and Injuries

Joel Parra is injured and will not play for Barcelona. Furkan Korkmaz and Nick Calathes are out for Monaco.

Barcelona vs Monaco Prediction

If Monaco were at full strength, we would give them a much better chance in this game. Without Calathes and Korkmaz, they lack depth in the backcourt, and Barcelona is likely to exploit that. The Catalans also need a big win to boost their confidence and belief in their quality, and this is an ideal opportunity to achieve it. Furthermore, they certainly don’t want to lose to Monaco for the fourth time in a row.
