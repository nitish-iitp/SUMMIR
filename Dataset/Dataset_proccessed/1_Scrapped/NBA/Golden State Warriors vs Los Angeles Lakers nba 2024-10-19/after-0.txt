LOS ANGELES LAKERS
Bronny James Reflects on Lakers Start: 'Great Feeling' to Not Overthink vs. Warriors

As the Los Angeles Lakers made their final preparations for the regular season, head coach JJ Redick used it as an opportunity to give Bronny James his first career in Friday's preseason finale against the Golden State Warriors.

Speaking to reporters following the game, James called it a "great feeling to go out there and not think as much as I do and just play" after putting up 17 points, four rebounds and three steals in 35 minutes.

"[It gives me] just a little bit of confidence going into the season even though I might not be in that rotation, might not be playing, but just going into practice, maybe G League games with that confidence in myself to go out there and play my game," James added about the experience. "I feel like that's the biggest part of it."

Los Angeles rested all five starters to avoid risking injury for the start of the season. Golden State cruised to a 132-74 victory, but that was to be expected with Draymond Green, Brandin Podziemski and Jonathan Kuminga all playing more than 15 minutes.

James took advantage of his increased playing time by having his best performance of the preseason.

The 20-year-old had a total of eight points on 4-of-20 shooting in his first five preseason appearances. His shot remains a work-in progress after going 7-of-17 against the Warriors, but it was a positive sign that he was willing to keep attacking on offense.

Redick said after the game that James—and the other young players on the Lakers—are trending in the right direction as they get set to play games that count in the standings:

"I think for him and all our younger players, all the moments are building blocks. Not just the good moments. The bad moments are learning opportunities. I think you have to have a level of patience, a level of optimism. I'm very confident in the level of work that our young guys have had.

"So, again, I think for him, I'm sure it felt good to have 17 points. ... I'm not even remotely concerned about that. It's not even on my radar. Like, we're trying to help him grow into a great basketball player."

With each step this offseason, James has looked more confident as he got more playing time. He scored a total of 10 points in his first two Las Vegas Summer League games, then finished with back-to-back games of 12 and 13 points.

James was also able to show off some of his defensive acumen against the Warriors. His three steals were tied for most by any player in the game, and he also had one of the Lakers' two blocks.

The next step for James will likely be making his regular-season debut playing with his father, LeBron James. The Lakers host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET.
