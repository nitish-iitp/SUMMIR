The LA Lakers were handed a comprehensive 58-point loss by the Golden State Warriors at Chase Center on Friday. After resting all of their starters, LA went with their inexperienced bench, and except for flashes of a decent game by Quincy Olivari and Bronny James, the visitors endured a massive 132-74 preseason defeat.

The Lakers struggled with turnovers and shooting as the Warriors led 34-18 in the first half. Golden State, who rested Steph Curry, had no issues getting past LA's wafer-thin defense and putting the screws to them in the paint. The win now sees them end their preseason 6-0. The last time the Warriors had a clean slate in their warm-up games, they went on to win the NBA championship.

The Purple and Gold started with Jalen Hood-Schifino, Quincy Olivari, Bronny James, Cam Reddish and Jaxson Hayes. Maxwell Lewis, Armel Traore, and Colin Castleton came off the bench as LA trailed the Warriors well over 20 points right in the first half. They went into halftime trailing 66-40 with Olivari leading LA with a game-high 19 points. James had seven points.

The duo proved to be the bright spots as Olivari ended his evening with 22 points, seven rebounds and two assists. James had a career-high 17 points, four rebounds, one assist, three steals and a block on 7-of-17 shooting from the field and 1-of-5 from beyond the arc.
