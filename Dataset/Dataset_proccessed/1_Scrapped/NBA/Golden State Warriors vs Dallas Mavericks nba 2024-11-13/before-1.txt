Klay Thompson does not maintain contact with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green: "I'll see them when I see them, that's all"

Klay Thompson and Luka Doncic

In the early hours of Tuesday, November 12, to Wednesday, November 13, 2024, the Golden State Warriors will host the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the NBA Cup. It will mark the return of Klay Thompson to the Chase Center, albeit in a different jersey. Undoubtedly, it will be an emotional moment for all Dub Nation fans and for the shooting guard.

Recently, Klay himself spoke about that upcoming game, downplaying its significance by saying that for him, it's just another regular season match in the year. Additionally, he revealed that he's not in touch with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Together, they secured four rings with the Golden State, including a back-to-back triumph in 2017 and 2018.

Klay Thompson's Words

"It’ll be nice to see people you obviously worked hard with, but for me, it’s just another regular-season game in November," Thompson told reporters following the Mavericks' loss to the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night. "Obviously, there are bigger implications with the NBA Cup. So, that's what I have in mind, just winning that because I haven’t been part of it yet. I know it’s a recent thing, but I want to play for that title first."

"I’ve been doing this for a long time," Thompson stated. "And basketball is basketball. I reckon it’s good for the fans. So, good for them." Lastly, he was asked if he stays in touch with his former teammates with whom he has won everything, Stephen Curry and Draymond Green: "I’m focused. Not really," Thompson replied to Andscape. "I’ll see them when I see them. That’s all."
