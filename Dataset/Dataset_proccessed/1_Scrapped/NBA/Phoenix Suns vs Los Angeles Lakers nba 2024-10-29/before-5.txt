Phoenix Suns rookie Ryan Dunn had a great first week in the NBA, averaging 8.0 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.0 assists in three games. Dunn even started in their previous game, a win over the Dallas Mavericks. How did he fare tonight against the LA Lakers?

Dunn finished the game with just seven points in 15 minutes, but had a great impact on the Suns' eventual 109-105 win. He defended LeBron James when they were on the court together, making hustle plays and keeping the energy of the team high.

It was Devin Booker and Kevin Durant who carried Phoenix to their third win of the season. Booker had 33 points, three rebounds and two assists, while Durant put up 30 points, eight rebounds, four assists and four blocks. The Suns even limited James to just 11 points on 3-for-14 shooting.

The Phoenix Suns were down big early after the LA Lakers started the game on a 26-8 run, leading to two timeouts. Coach Mike Budenholzer took out four of his starters, leaving Kevin Durant with his bench corp that didn't include Ryan Dunn. They cut the lead to just nine after the first quarter.

The 21-year-old forward entered the game to start the second period and was matched up with LeBron James. He missed his first shot before scoring on a driving layup over the four-time NBA champion. He finished the first half with two points and two rebounds in about five minutes of action.

Dunn didn't back down from defending James, who had a rough night with just 11 points. The rookie was doing a good job on defense, making the right reads and affecting the game with his hustle plays.

The Virginia product came back late in the third quarter and made a couple of appearances in the fourth. He was even in the closing lineup trying to stop the Lakers from scoring. His performance will likely make him part of the rotation moving forward.

Devin Booker praises Ryan Dunn for his performance against Lakers

Speaking after the game, Devin Booker was asked about the wonderful job the Phoenix Suns did in limiting LeBron James' scoring. Booker praised his teammates for making things tough for the NBA's all-time leading scorer, giving a shoutout to Ryan Dunn.

"Shoutout to our rookie Ryan Dunn," Booker said. "He takes on every challenge. He's been put through a lot this year and he hasn't backed down from anybody."
