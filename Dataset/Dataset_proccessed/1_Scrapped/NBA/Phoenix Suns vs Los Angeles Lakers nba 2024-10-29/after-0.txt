The Los Angeles Lakers wrapped up playing three games in four days and went 2-1 during the stretch. L.A. lost in a down-to-the-wire contest to the Phoenix Suns on Monday, as the star duo of Devin Booker and Kevin Durant combined for 63 points to outlast the Lakers, who were looking to continue their unbeaten start to the season. Lakers forward Anthony Davis shined with 29 points and 15 rebounds.

Offensively, the Lakers continue to look solid, scoring at least 100 points in each game thus far. The personnel change has certainly had a positive impact on the team.

Austin Reaves and D’Angelo Russell must’ve read my previous article about how they have struggled offensively, because since its publication, they have been shooting the ball well and have provided positive minutes on the floor.

Both have also picked up their 3-point field-goal percentage, as each shot 50% on Saturday night against the Sacramento Kings from deep. Reaves has been the most impressive out of the two guards, having played two games against the Suns in which he made five 3-pointers in each game. While Russell hasn’t produced tons of points, his presence in the game is felt with the amount of distributing he does. He has 18 assists over the last three games.

Putting Davis in the MVP conversation would not be an overreaction at this point as he is putting up similar numbers to those of Nikola Jokic’s MVP seasons. Davis is also one of the most-utilized players on the Lakers, and it is usually rare for big men in the NBA to play a lot of minutes. Yet the Lakers rely on Davis so much that he has to play three full quarters for Los Angeles to have the best chance at winning the game.

Rui Hachimura keeps improving game by game. The two-way player is providing the best plus/minus minutes for the Lakers this season. He has yet to record a game in which he provides a negative rating for the Lakers. Hachimura does struggle a bit with his field goal efficiency, but that is due to the number of shot attempts he has in every game.

Not only does Hachimura have to help out on the offensive side, but he is always tasked to guard the opponent’s star player. He is constantly moving and denying the ball while also posing himself as a wall inside the paint.

Defensively, the Lakers are already starting to struggle. They rank 19th in the NBA so far this season in defensive rating, and that is largely because they struggle to guard the 3-point line. Three of the Lakers’ opponents thus far have attempted half of their field goals from the 3-point line.

The Lakers also seem to not be able to contain the opponent’s star player. In the NBA, it is very difficult to stop the superstars since the game is played at such a high level, but the Lakers seem to be not even trying. They are relying heavily on players like Davis and LeBron James to have big games to win games.

Some notable performances against the Lakers this year so far include Anthony Edwards’ 27-point game, Durant and Booker combining for 53 points, the Kings’ big-three of Domantas Sabonis, Demar DeRozan, and De’Aaron Fox combining for 80 points and most recently, 63 points between Durant and Booker in the second matchup with Phoenix.

When having to face a team that has multiple All-Star-caliber players, the Lakers will need to focus on one player to contain and exploit their weaknesses. The Lakers just need to spend a little more time in the film room studying opposing teams and specifically focusing on their offensive schemes, looking at different motions that the team runs to counterattack the defensive scheme that the Lakers run. Having a coach like JJ Redick helps, as he will likely bring up the fact that they are not doing so well on the defensive side sooner rather than later, and he will let the media know what he plans to do to fix that.

The Lakers are hitting the road for a four-game road trip, and it all starts against a team that LeBron is very familiar with. The Cleveland Cavaliers are the Lakers’ first opponent on this road trip, and the Cavs are hot to start the season.

Cleveland has arguably played some of the worst teams in the NBA to start the season, although they are coming off a big road victory against the New York Knicks. The Lakers are going to have to go up against bigs Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen while trying to contain Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland on the wings. This will be a great test to see how the Lakers will do this year on the road and also how they will do against opponents who have height on them.
