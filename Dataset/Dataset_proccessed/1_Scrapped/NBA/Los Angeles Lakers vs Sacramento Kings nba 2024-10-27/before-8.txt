That was a really dirty play by AD. He kneed Sabonis and somehow Sabonis fouled him. He rammed his knee into the inside of Sabonis’s leg.

If you’re forced to listen to Kayte make a game of it and see how close she comes to three possessions.

In game one she came within a missed three pointer of stretching her “point” to three possessions. So close.

Crazy/stupid/bold prediction…

This is going to be Keegan’s team by the end of next season.

And maybe even by the end of THIS season.

There’s just….something…about him that’s different this season. DDR’s presence may prevent him from making the 3rd year jump in primary stats, but he’s going to make that jump everywhere else.

He’s going to become the one untouchable on this roster.

I disavow this DDR slander. There is a Julius Randle-LeBron James-shaped hole at the forward position. That is the problem. That the Kings chose DDR over trying to fill that hole does not downplay the legitimate impact he has had on this Kings offense early in the season.

Beef Stew won’t be playing much in Detroit, so a Huerter for Beef Stew swap could still happen. But that means that Ellis and/or Devin Carter would need to pickup those minutes. And Brown seems to have moved on from Ellis in this game, so who knows what the hell is going to happen.

I’d argue he’s negatively impacted the offense by being a one-dimensional player, with that dimension not being beyond the arc. Swap him out with a player who was even remotely good from deep and we beat Minny by double-digits.

He’s attacking the rim with real confidence. He has looked scared in the past, passive. Now he asserts himself in the post, and looks like he may even be jumping higher – at least more authoritatively.

He looks real good this season, perhaps better than I even expected him to look (and I considered myself a Keegan-optimist). I would say he and Domas have been the Kings two best players to begin the year.

You can really see that 3rd year jump taking shape with him. He came to basketball late, and he was old for a rookie, but unlike Fox, Keegan’s game is going to age VERY well in part because he won’t have to rely on pure athleticism.

Murray is going to be one of those rare guys whose peak is noticeably later than most.

Fox, relying so much on his speed on little else, is going to decline considerably once he loses even half a step (likely by age 32 or so). At that same age, Murray will be playing the best basketball of his life.

Kings win the challenge, but I don’t understand the why Brown did it. It doesn’t takes points on or off the board, it doesn’t change possession and it doesn’t impact the game with 9 minutes to go in the 3rd.

Looking at the box score the scoring distribution among the Kings looks good. Everyone playing is scoring. That will help establish a rotation and not rely on too heavily on one or two players. Hopefully Huerter keeps this up. When he scores this team has so many options. If he doesn’t score this team is simple to defend.

Alright, that’s it for me. There’s still a couple college football games that are more interesting than watching the Kings shit the bed yet again.

Letting a 40 year old on a SEGABABA run them out of the gym. It’s early in the season, and this is already a long season.

They got Lyles trying to defend him. Monte really needs to acquire another forward for this roster. Been an issue for years now

If your roster is built almost entirely on outscoring the other team, being able to score seems kinda important.

It is the box score that shows the running plus minus during the game. The one I look at does not show it until the end of the game. You have a special box score. Thanks for sharing the info.

No defense, players start doing stupid stuff rushing plays, hero ball….and then after 21-0 run, they decide to play defense and slow things down again. Part of this is Brown taking a long ass time to call time outs, just allowing them to keep running up the score.

Well yeah but the team just sucked all around for much of that time. These last few years they’re actually good enough to be a playoff team but their ceiling is capped with this defense of theirs. Doomed to be a play-in/1st round exit roster at best with this core at this rate

The Kings are not going to get much better collective offensive play out of the top 6 guys. Brown has been carping about defense for years. It’s a roster construction and not a coaching issue, which has been as obvious as it is unaddressed for as long as Brown has been talking about it.

Too small and unathletic across the lineup. Only Fox and Monk offer explosion. Love Domas toughness and overall game, but not an explosive athlete. Randle in game 1 bully ball. AD anytime Keegan or Demar on him bully ball. LBJ with Huerter or Demar on him bully ball. Pelicans 6 f***ing time last year!!!! Bully ball. Easy lay up after easy layup. No length to contest 3s. This roster has no chance as is. Pathetic. Fix it Monte!!!! Need a true 4…open your eyes!!!!!

They need length and athleticism? Too bad they didn’t know that coming into this year.

Again, everything that’s been done for the kings. This year is counterintuitive to what they need.

The only way any of this makes sense of McNaor trades a few pieces. Even then? I don’t love where this team is starting.

Fox has consistently shown he should not have the ball in the last two minutes if thinking is involved. If you are going to go so hard in on scoring let the guy with a -29 shoot the ball. It is the only reason he is playing.

Keon gave them good minutes and helped transform their defense to middle of the pack late last season once he entered the starting 5 and the coaching staff just waved that off like it didn’t matter I guess. Not sure how you can declare him the starter to open camp only to do a 180 days before the opener, and now in game 2 he’s getting DNP-CD.
