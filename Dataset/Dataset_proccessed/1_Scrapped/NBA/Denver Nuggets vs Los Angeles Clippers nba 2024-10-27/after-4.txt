HIELD'S HISTORIC START
Buddy Hield has led the Warriors in points (49) and made 3-pointers (12) in his first two games with the franchise and the Warriors have won both games by a combined margin of 77 points, the largest margin of victory to begin a season in NBA history. Hield has thrived in a sixth-man role, leading the Warriors to have the highest-scoring bench in the first two games of a season in league history (150 points) since Elias began tracking starters in 1970-71. » Full Story

L.A. CLIPPERS SCOUTING REPORT
The Los Angeles Clippers remain without two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, who is recovering from a knee injury that has sidelined him since the 2024 Playoffs. With the departure of All-Star forward Paul George, the 'new look' Clippers are centered around former league MVP James Harden, who began his 16th NBA season on Wednesday. Harden was in the same 2009 Draft class as Stephen Curry and the pair have been two of the league's most productive offensive weapons over the last decade. Harden came two assists shy of a triple-double in his season opener (29 PTS, 12 REB, 8 AST). Los Angeles added several rotation players this offseason, headlined by defensive stopper Derrick Jones Jr., who was part of the reigning Western Conference Champion Dallas Mavericks. Wings Norman Powell and Terrance Mann and center Ivica Zubac are projected to shoulder a more significant role this season.
