The Los Angeles Clippers had a successful weekend, winning back-to-back road games after a disappointing opening loss versus the Phoenix Suns.

The first, and most impressive win of the weekend for the Clippers came on the road against reigning-MVP Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets, who have been one of the best teams in basketball in recent years and are also infamous for the unique arduousness that their arena brings opponents.

The Clippers fended off a 41-point explosion from Jokic to come from behind in the 4th quarter and complete the upset.

Norman Powell was the star in this game, scoring 37 points on the night. Powell had an incredible game overall, but he was especially stellar in the fourth quarter. He seemingly couldn’t miss, scoring 22 points in the period while only missing one shot.

Powell also hit timely shots that kept a notoriously explosive Nuggets offense from ever pulling away. The most important of these came with just 56 seconds left, when Powell hit a contested three to tie the game at 103 apiece.

James Harden was also incredible, commanding control of the offense and boasting a 20-point double-double that saw him dish out 16 assists. The Clippers demand a lot from their 35-year old star in the absence of Kawhi Leonard, and in this game he met these demands head-on, creating a number of good shots not only for himself, but also for his teammates.

Harden, like Powell, was also clutch when his team needed him, knocking down a tightly contested step-back jumper at the two minute mark of the 3rd quarter and also drawing a key foul in the last 40 seconds of the game to put his team ahead for the rest of the night.

This game was an excellent display of the Clippers’ ability to be resilient in tense scenarios. Despite Denver being arguably the more talented team, it was always the Clippers who responded in moments late in the game when the pressure was at its highest.

The Clippers rode their momentum from Denver into San Francisco, where they beat the Golden State Warriors—handing the blue and gold their first loss of the new season.

Even though the Warriors were without Stephen Curry for the majority of the second half due to an ankle injury, this win was still hard-fought. While the Chase Center environment might not be what Golden State once had in Oracle Arena, the Warriors are still one of the more difficult teams in the league to play on the road, and on Sunday night, the Clippers prevailed nonetheless.

The Clippers held strong in the fourth quarter, fighting off multiple challenges to their lead with clutch buckets that came from a plethora of players. Harden, Powell and Ivica Zubac all contributed crucial points in the final three minutes of play.

It was perhaps this display of collective team effort that was the most positive takeaway from this game for LA. There was no one “hero” who had the hot hand Sunday night, rather there were four Clippers starters who scored 18 or more points.

The Clippers have continued to play with an abundance of heart this season, led by James Harden first and foremost, a player who has ironically had his drive and mentality questioned more than most superstars in the league. After the game, Clippers’ head coach Ty Lue spoke about how the culture of their team has helped them to stay composed in key moments.

“I think we got the right intent. Our hearts are in the right place. No matter who’s playing, you see we come out to win. Everybody on the bench is always cheering for each other, and that’s what it’s all about,” Lue said in media interviews after the win.

The Clippers have a two-day break before they return home to the Intuit Dome to play the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, Oct. 30.
