Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best selections on Sunday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Trae Young (ATL, PG)	$19,530	53.8	2.8
Value	Ivica Zubac (LAC, C)	$15,110	44.7	3
Fade	Ayo Dosunmu (CHI, PG/SG)	$11,330	22.9	2
Cheapie	Noah Clowney (BKN, PF)	$6,000	17.7	2.9

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K

Conclusion

When building your NBA Sunday teams, consider starting with a value player like Ivica Zubac. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Trae Young is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Noah Clowney.

On the other hand, according to our model, Ayo Dosunmu is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if entering multiple line-ups.
