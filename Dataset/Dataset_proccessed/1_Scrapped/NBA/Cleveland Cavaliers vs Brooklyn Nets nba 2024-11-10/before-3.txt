Cavaliers beat Warriors for 10th straight win
By Staff Reporter

Darius Garland made six of the 11 three-pointers he attempted against the Warriors

THE Cleveland Cavaliers extended their best start to an NBA season with a 10th successive victory by beating the Golden State Warriors 136-117.
Darius Garland scored a game-high 27 points for the Cavs, who became only the 15th team to start with a 10-0 record.

Cleveland dominated from the outset and led 83-42 at half-time, with Stephen Curry managing just 12 points for the Warriors whose five-game winning streak was halted.
“10-0 is a magic number,” Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. “We’re playing really good basketball and I’m just really pleased where the group is.

“I was worried about tonight – they’re 7-1 and rolling and they’re coming in here, they’re champions and they’re going to try and knock our block off.
“The way we came out tonight – that surprised me, how ready we were, how hungry we were.”

Elsewhere, Jayson Tatum scored 33 points as reigning champions the Boston Celtics earned a 108-104 overtime win against the Brooklyn Nets.
Boston, who suffered a first loss in their previous game against the Warriors, did not lead until the fourth quarter before sealing the victory in overtime after the match was tied 94-94 at the end of normal time.
The Phoenix Suns edged past the Dallas Mavericks 114-113 with Jusuf Nurkic netting a match-winning free throw with 0.8 seconds left.

The Los Angeles Lakers bounced back from four defeats in five on the road to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 116-106 at home.
Anthony Davis scored 31 points for the Lakers while LeBron James recorded the 114th triple-double of his career with 21 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds.
