Gran Canaria vs Bahcesehir: Analysis and Prediction – Gran Canaria will host Bahcesehir in the EuroCup Round 3 game.

Gran Canaria Team News

Gran Canaria has had an excellent start to the season, boasting four wins from four games played. In the Liga Endesa, they comfortably defeated Andorra and Leyma Coruna. In the EuroCup, they faced tougher challenges but emerged victorious in both games, first against Trento and then against Buducnost after overtime.

Gran Canaria has maintained a consistent approach for years, with Jaka Lakovic starting his third season as head coach. Nicolas Brussino has been performing well at the start of the season, playing a crucial role in the win over Buducnost with 11 points, and he confirmed his good form in the game against Leyma Coruna, where he scored 13 points. So far, Caleb Homesley has been one of the team’s most reliable players, scoring 23 points in their away game in Montenegro and averaging 12 points in the Liga Endesa. Another player who has been stable at the season’s start is Carlos Alocen, who arrived from Real Madrid, where he struggled to find his place in the team after an injury. He has been in double figures in three of the four games, with only one game in the EuroCup seeing him score single digits with nine points. George Conditt, a Puerto Rico national team player, has yet to fully find his rhythm, and it is clear that this is an area where Jaka Lakovic will want to maximize potential in the future.

Although Gran Canaria is playing excellently and is at maximum performance this season, they will need to improve certain aspects to secure a win against the inspiring Bahcesehir. First and foremost, Mike Tobey, who joined from Crvena Zvezda, needs to elevate his form and provide the team with more offensive depth. Additionally, defense remains an area with plenty of room for improvement.

Bahcesehir Team News

Similar to their opponent in this matchup, Bahcesehir also looks strong at the start of the season. They have recorded two convincing wins in the EuroCup, first defeating the Wolves away and then succeeding against Besiktas in a Turkish derby. To wrap things up, in the opening round of the Turkish Super League, they easily beat Karsiyaka at home by 82:68.

Dejan Radonjic’s team did not undergo drastic changes over the summer. They added players capable of making a difference at this level, while retaining the core and main contributors from last season. CJ Massinburg, who joined the club after an excellent season in the Italian Serie A with Brescia, has immediately emerged as one of the key players for Bahcesehir. Similarly, Sehmus Hazer, who is a EuroLeague addition from Fenerbahce, has been performing very well, providing stability at the start of the season. Axel Bouteille and Tyler Cavanaugh, who were the top scorers last season, have also remained with the team and are playing excellently so far. In the win against Karsiyaka, Jaleen Smith, another former EuroLeague player who previously played for Virtus and later for Partizan, contributed significantly with 14 points. However, it is clear that Bahcesehir still has room for improvement, especially regarding Marko Simonovic and Mateusz Ponitka, who have yet to find their rhythm at the beginning of the season.

To hope for win and an upset in Spain, they will need to utilize all their strengths. They must receive a greater contribution from their bench players, and their defense needs to remain at a high level. Bahcesehir has been struggling with defensive rebounding at the start of the season, making it a crucial area where they will want to improve.

Gran Canaria vs Bahcesehir Prediction

Both teams have had an excellent start to the season and remain unbeaten so far. Gran Canaria is considered the favorite in this match, but despite winning both of their EuroCup games, they have shown some weaknesses. Dejan Radonjic’s team has more players in good form at the start of the season, suggesting they could be a strong competitor. Therefore, our suggestion is that Bahcesehir will not lose by a margin greater than the offered handicap in this game.
