Paolo Banchero leads the Orlando Magic on the road against rookie Stephon Castle and the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.

Both the Orlando Magic and San Antonio Spurs started off the preseason with a loss and look to bounce back in their second game on Wednesday. In Orlando’s 106-104 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans the team was led by All-Star Paolo Banchero with 15 points, three rebounds and two assists. He flashed his scoring ability and a sign of a more efficient season, finishing 5-for-7 from the field while getting to the line for six free throws. Jalen Suggs (11 points) and Cole Anthony (11 points off the bench) were the only other players for Orlando to finish in double figures. Orlando is coming off the franchises best season in over a decade and looks to build on that starting with the preseason.

Last season ended with a first round playoff exit, but in a tough seven game series against a very good Cleveland Cavaliers team. In that series Banchero elevated his game, averaging 27.0 points, 8.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.1 steals per game.

In San Antonio’s preseason debut it lost 112-107 to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The team was without Victor Wembanyama who sat out the first preseason game, but is expected to play in Wednesday’s game against Orlando. Chris Paul also missed the first preseason game and is listed as day-to-day.

Julian Champagnie led the team with 22 points and seven rebounds on 6-of-13 shooting from three. This season San Antonio will try to find the right mix around Wembanyama with shooting, defense and role players to make a push for the Play-In Tournament or the playoffs with veteran additions in Paul and Harrison Barnes.
