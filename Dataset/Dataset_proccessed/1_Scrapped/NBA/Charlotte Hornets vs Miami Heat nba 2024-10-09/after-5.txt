LaMelo Ball had an electric start for the Charlotte Hornets against the Miami Heat on Tuesday. The oft-injured point guard reminded fans why, if healthy, the Hornets could surprise teams this season. “Melo” looked like he was in mid-season form already.

Ball’s first 3-pointers came with a 10:28 in the game. He sank a 26-footer off a Brandon Miller pass. Lonzo Ball’s younger brother dropped three more in the final 3:45 of the quarter. The 2021 Rookie of the Year winner’s last triple, a 31-footer, had the Hornets play-by-play announcer going wild:

LaMelo Ball added another 31-foot 3-pointer in the second quarter to finish the first half with 18 points. Despite his impressive performance, the Heat still took a 62-58 halftime advantage. Brandon Miller struggled to make shots, giving Miami the edge after the first two frames.

The wily playmaker didn’t see much action in the second half, but his performance helped set the tone for the Hornets. Charlotte’s 111-108 against Miami evened its preseason record to 1-1.

LaMelo Ball filled up the stat sheet against the Heat on Tuesday

On a night Miller, Nick Richards and Josh Green didn’t have their shooting touch, LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges carried the scoring burden. Ball, though, didn’t just impress the Charlotte Hornets fans with his shooting; he was also crucial as the team’s playmaker.

“Melo” finished the game with five dimes, but he could have easily tallied more if his teammates had been more efficient with their attempts. Miller made 2-of-13 shots, including 1-for-10 from behind the arc. Several of his tries came from well-executed plays that Ball had orchestrated.

Ball added six rebounds, one steal, one block and just one turnover in 23 minutes of all-out action.

Charlotte’s point guard also had a solid all-around outing on Sunday against the New York Knicks. His 19 points and seven rebounds were team-highs. Tuesday’s performance versus Miami was the more impressive display and a reminder to fans why he is the team’s top crowd-drawer.
