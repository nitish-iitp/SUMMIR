POSTS DIVERSE LINE FROM BENCH

Watson took only five shot attempts, but he made solid contributions in secondary categories in the victory. The Nuggets have a lot invested in Watson, but many forget that he entered the league following limited action in the college ranks and is still considered a developmental project for the team. Nonetheless, he's seeing significant action this season, averaging a career-high 24.7 minutes per game.

LOGS 32/12/15 TRIPLE-DOUBLE

The combination of Nikola Jokic and Russell Westbrook overpowered the Nets, with both players notching a triple-double in the victory. Jokic ranks third in the NBA with 145 career triple-doubles, trailing only Westbrook and Oscar Robertson in the category in NBA history. The Nets played only eight players and were hampered with injuries, so while the win wasn't much of a surprise, the Nuggets are glad to have Jokic back at full strength after his recent illness.

NOTCHES TRIPLE-DOUBLE IN WIN

Westbrook is the NBA's all-time leader in triple-doubles, and Friday he joined Nikola Jokic in a triple-double party. Friday marked Westbrook's 203rd triple-double, and a premature exit from Jamal Murray (knee) likely helped him reach the milestone. Aaron Gordon's (calf) extended absence has placed Westbrook center stage due to the first-unit shift that accommodates the absence. He's responding with quality numbers and is a nightly triple-double threat.
