MOBILE TICKETING

The Denver Nuggets use digital tickets for entry to Ball Arena. Manage your upcoming games through the official Denver Nuggets App.

For your protection, please use caution when purchasing game tickets from third-party sources such as online brokers and marketplaces (i.e., Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist). Fans are encouraged to purchase verified individual game tickets and tickets posted for resale by Season Ticket Members directly from the team or venue via Ticketmaster.

Counterfeit tickets and fraudulent transactions from unauthorized sources cannot be replaced or refunded.

If you do obtain tickets from a third party, please inspect the terms and conditions, and understand the risks before purchasing.

Season Ticket Members reselling individual game tickets are advised to use Ticketmaster's verified Official Fan Ticket Marketplace at ticketmaster.com/verified.

For further assistance, or to report fraudulent ticket-selling activity, contact the Ball Arena Box Office at TicketOps-CS@teamkse.com.
