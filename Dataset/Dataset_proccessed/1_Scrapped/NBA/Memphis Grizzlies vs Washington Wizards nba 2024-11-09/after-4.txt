Injuries seem to keep piling up for the Memphis Grizzlies.

Superstar point guard Ja Morant has been listed as week-to-week after suffering a posterior hip subluxation along with multiple associated Grade 1 pelvic muscle strains, the team announced Saturday.

The team says updates will be provided “as appropriate.”

The incident occurred in the third quarter of Wednesday's game against the Los Angeles Lakers. As Morant was trying to catch a lob pass from a teammate, he was knocked over mid-air by a Lakers player and fell onto his hip.

Imaging was done on the injury to reveal the strains and subluxation. According to the team, he avoided any dislocation.

He missed Friday's game against the Washington Wizards and was seen on crutches during his team's win.

The Grizzlies travelled Saturday to Portland for a game Sunday night with the Trail Blazers. Coach Taylor Jenkins said before Friday night's game that Morant felt the injury more in the hip after further evaluation, and he had testing Friday with another consultation set for Saturday.

Morant, 25, has enjoyed an impressive campaign after playing in only nine games last season. He is averaging 20.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 9.1 assists in 27.9 minutes per game.

The former second-overall pick from 2019 missed all but nine games in the 2023-24 season after serving a 25-game suspension in the early part of the year and then suffering a torn labrum in January, forcing him to sit out the rest of the campaign.

Memphis is also dealing with injuries to guards Marcus Smart (ankle) and Desmond Bane (oblique), as well as forward GG Jackson (foot). They're 6-4 this season and sit sixth in the Western Conference.
