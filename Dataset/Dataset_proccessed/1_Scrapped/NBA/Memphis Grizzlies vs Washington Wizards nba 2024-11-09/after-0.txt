Grizzlies’ Ja Morant week to week with right hip injury: Who steps up in his absence
By Jenna West and Kelly Iko
Nov 10, 2024

The Memphis Grizzlies listed point guard Ja Morant as week to week with a strained right hip, the team announced Saturday.

Morant, 25, suffered the injury during Wednesday’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers after landing awkwardly on a dunk attempt in the third quarter. He attempted to catch a lob and was undercut by Lakers center Christian Koloko. No foul was called, and Morant asked to exit the game.

The Grizzlies said Morant was doubtful to return but he never did. Morant finished with 20 points, five assists and four rebounds in Memphis’ 131-114 win over the Lakers and did not play in Friday’s contest against the Washington Wizards.

Morant, who is in his sixth season with the Grizzlies, is averaging 20.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 9.1 assists.

How this impacts the injury-ridden Grizzlies

Losing Morant is a tough loss for a battle-tested 6-4 Grizzlies team that sits just a game and a half out of third place in the West. Memphis has been dealt several injury blows and adds Morant to a list that includes Desmond Bane, Marcus Smart, Vince Williams Jr. and GG Jackson II.

It’s especially tough for coach Taylor Jenkins, considering Morant had consciously reduced the number of risky, acrobatic dunk attempts he’s been known for over the years, to preserve his body for the long run. — Kelly Iko, NBA staff writer

Who steps up in Morant’s absence?

Scottie Pippen Jr. will assume lead ballhandler duties in Morant’s absence. The third-year guard has had an impressive start to the campaign, averaging 11.6 points, 6.9 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game — including 41.4 percent shooting from 3. The Grizzlies will lose Morant’s speed, dynamism and playmaking but Pippen’s impact as a reserve shouldn’t be understated — 96th percentile in both assist percentage and assist-to-usage ratio, according to Cleaning the Glass.

A healthy Jaren Jackson Jr., who is averaging over 25 points per game and shooting 45 percent from 3 this month, should soften some of the scoring blow.

Memphis’ upcoming schedule is no laughing matter. The Grizzlies will face the Nuggets twice, as well as the Lakers and Golden State Warriors before Thanksgiving. While the team awaits Morant’s return to full fitness, expect more ballhandling duties to be placed on the likes of Jaylen Wells and Luke Kennard — in addition to Jake LaRavia and Santi Aldama.

The team has committed to playing with pace and space with Morant leading the charge, sixth and ninth in offensive and defensive rating, respectively. How the Grizzlies respond to his absence will be critical. — Iko
