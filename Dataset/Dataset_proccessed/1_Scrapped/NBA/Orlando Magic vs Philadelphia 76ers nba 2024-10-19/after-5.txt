ORLANDO MAGIC
NBA Rumors: Mac McClung, Magic Convert Contract to 2-Way Deal Ahead of 2024-25 Season

After going through the preseason with the Orlando Magic, two-time Slam Dunk champion Mac McClung is staying with the team for the start of the regular season.

Per ESPN's Shams Charania, the Magic are converting McClung's deal to a two-way contract after he spent last season with their G League affiliate.

McClung was playing on an Exhibit 10 contract, so by converting it to a two-way contract the Magic get to keep him on their roster. He is eligible to be on their active list for up to 50 games during the regular season.

The Magic used McClung sparingly in the preseason. He appeared in two games for a total of 15 minutes, scoring eight points on 3-of-6 shooting from the field.

McClung is coming off a 2023-24 season with the Osceola Magic in which he was named G League MVP. The 25-year-old averaged 25.7 points on 50.9 percent shooting (39.6 percent from three), 6.6 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game in 27 starts.

Osceloa made the playoffs as the No. 1 seed, but lost in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Long Island Nets.

McClung gained a cult following during the 2022-23 season when he signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers ahead of his appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest as part of All-Star weekend.

The Texas Tech alum stole the show by winning the event with 19 out of 20 perfect scores from the judges across his four dunks.

McClung was invited back to the Dunk Contest last season to defend his title. He became the fifth player in history to win the contest in back-to-back years, finishing ahead of Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown.

Orlando now has two players on two-way contracts, with McClung joining Trevelin Queen. He didn't appear in a game with the NBA club last season.

The Magic will open the 2024-25 regular season against the Miami Heat on Oct. 23.
