Orlando Magic Garnering High Praise From National Media

ORLANDO - Last year around this time, the picture was much blurrier. Not many nationally – or globally for that matter with the NBA reach so extensive – were paying close enough attention to the Orlando Magic. Overlooked a good way to put it, most assumed they were too young, too unproven, too raw, and too mysterious to glorify. 

However, as they went through their 2023-24 journey, which ended with a hard-fought Game 7 loss in Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs after winning 47 games in the regular season, no longer was that really the case. There was a greater understanding of what this team was becoming. 

With that wave of acknowledgment and praise comes loftier expectations. The last few years, a flash of greatness here and a flash of greatness there – individually or collectively – was good enough to imply growth. Now, the mentality is to not settle. Many teams in league history reached the level the Magic made it to last year. Now the real test is coming, and the Magic have an opportunity to show what they are truly made of. 

Not only is there a ton of internal optimism, but many watching from a distance believe in this team, too. The Athletic’s David Aldridge, for example, recently wrote in his piece titled Magic’s Paolo Banchero seeks to dominate in Year 3, with an ever-evolving ‘voice’ and game…

“Banchero’s rapid rise has helped center Orlando as, perhaps, the team with the highest ceiling in the league. Certainly, there isn’t a team in the East with a longer runway over the next five to seven years, with so much young talent on its roster.”

This is an excellent point by Aldridge. Banchero is only 21 (will be 22 next month). Franz Wagner recently turned 23. Jalen Suggs is also 23. Jett Howard is 21. Anthony Black is just 20. Even their more seasoned players – like Wendell Carter Jr., Jonathan Isaac and Moe Wagner – are only in their mid to late 20s. They have a promising 23-year-old rookie as well in Tristan da Silva.

In another article published by The Athletic – this one written by Zach Harper – there’s some more enthusiastic chatter, as Harper writes in his piece titled Are the Magic ready for another leap?...

“Best-case scenario? They clear 50 wins for the first time since 2011 and make the second round.

Worst-case scenario? The defense falls off, they still can’t shoot and they’re a Play-In team who gets bounced in the first round.

Confidence in the Magic: 💪💪💪💪”

Back in July, during the heart of free agency season, many were pleased with the Magic’s architectural decisions, particularly right after they signed two-time NBA champion Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.

Michael Pina of The Ringer, for example, wrote in his article titled The Orlando Magic Quietly Won the NBA Offseason…

“Coming off an admirable 47-win regular season, competitive playoff appearance, and home-run offseason that demonstrated an impressive awareness of their own potential and limitations, this team (the Magic) already has winning habits, a hard-nosed style that’s harmonious with its personnel, and blooming building blocks who make sense together.”

An All-Star last year in just his second NBA season, Banchero has been garnering high praise the last several weeks. Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz wrote in his article titled How Many Future Basketball Hall of Famers Are Playing In the NBA Right Now?...

“Banchero is just two years into his professional career, although he certainly looks like a future Hall of Famer to this point. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2022 draft, he followed up his Rookie of the Year campaign with an All-Star nod and a trip to the playoffs in his sophomore season. Once again projected to be the centerpiece of the Orlando Magic offense, Banchero already has few offensive weaknesses and is extremely skilled and mobile for his 6'10", 250-pound frame. Expect another All-Star season and a step closer to reaching the Hall one day.”

The Duke alum looked terrific in the preseason, finishing Orlando’s three-game exhibition slate with an efficient 21-point effort in 24 minutes of action in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers at Kia Center. 

Afterwards, Banchero talked about how more well-rounded and composed he is compared to his first two years in the league.

“It just comes with experience,” he said. “You can’t really explain it. It’s just a certain level of comfort. After my second year, especially playing in the playoffs, it showed me a different way that I can be effective. Combining my first two seasons and just looking back watching so much tape over the summer, I felt like I played a lot on the ball my first two years. And I think I learned that if I am able to mix up playing on and off the ball – screening, flashing and posting up and not just giving the defense one dose of something, just trying to mix it up and pick my spots and be a little more strategic with my approach, it makes the game a little easier. So, I think I’m just trying to get better at that. You are not able to do that without the experience. Those first two years I learned and now I’m trying to come in with an improved mindset my third season.”

Regardless of what everyone is saying, the Magic know they must lock in and block out all the commotion. If they can stick to their core principles, which include sharing the ball on offense, playing hard-nosed defense and using their depth to their advantage, then sky’s the limit for this group.
