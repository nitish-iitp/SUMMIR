Sixers evaluate Andre Drummond's overall preseason performance
Ky Carlin, Sixers Wire
Sat, Oct 19, 2024·2 min read

The Philadelphia 76ers fell short to the Orlando Magic on Friday 114-99 in the preseason finale as their attention now turns to the regular season. The Sixers have their eyes set on a title in the 2024-25 season and that was obvious with the moves they made in the offseason.

One of those big moves was the addition of Andre Drummond who will play a big role for Philadelphia. The 2-time All-Star had 12 points and 20 rebounds in Friday's loss to the Magic to wrap up a solid preseason for him.

In coach Nick Nurse's first season with the Sixers, there was a lack of size which made rebounding a bit of a battle for them on a nightly basis. With Drummond down there, things are much different.

"He’s back so he knows the territory a little bit," Nurse told reporters after the loss to the Magic. "I thought it was a major signing for us to get him. He just really dominates the defensive glass, right? If you make them miss, chances are Drum is gonna come down with it and a lot of times comes down with it a little without much of a fight for it. It’s like it’s him down there, he’s gonna get it."

The big man is in his second tour of duty with the Sixers, but the first run was with Doc Rivers as coach. Now, Nurse is at the helm in Philadelphia so there are different expectations as they are two different coaches with different philosophies. The rebounding is, obviously, welcomed, but Nurse is happy that Drummond is picking up on what he wants to run.

"That’s a good comforting factor because we really had to battle on the glass a lot last year really hard so that’s good," Nurse added. "He also just kinda keeps getting better in what we’re doing."

The Sixers open the season on Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks at home.
