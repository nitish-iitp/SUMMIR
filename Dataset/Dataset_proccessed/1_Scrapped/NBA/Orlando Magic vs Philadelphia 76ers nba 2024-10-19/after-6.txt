NBA: Preseason-Philadelphia 76ers at Atlanta Hawks - Source: Imagn

Philadelphia 76ers star guard Tyrese Maxey had to exit the final preseason game on Friday after playing five minutes. The Sixers faced the Orlando Magic to wrap up the preseason. They start the regular season on Oct. 23 against the Milwaukee Bucks.

Maxey didn't score a point and only had a single assist. According to the Sixers medical staff, the one-time All-Star suffered a right thumb contusion and will not return to action against the Magic.

The Sixers played four preseason games, and Maxey suited up for three games before their game against the Magic. Like most stars, the guard didn't spend much time on the floor. The most time he was on the floor was 26 minutes, which happened twice.

Philly already suffered an injury with one of their stars. In their preseason game against the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, nine-time All-Star Paul George suffered a hyperextended left knee. This caused him to exit the game and remain on the sidelines until he fully recovered.

Joel Embiid, on the other hand, has not suited up for the team in the preseason. This was a decision from the Sixers as part of his left knee management. The organization has taken a cautious approach to get the one-time MVP ready and healthy for the 2024-25 NBA season.

Tyrese Maxey earned an offseason award

While on-court awards always look good on any player's resume, Tyrese Maxey added an off-court award in the offseason. Maxey was awarded the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award. The league awarded the Sixers guard for his work in the community in Philadelphia.

He's also worked on reaching out to the community in his hometown of Dallas through the Tyrese Maxey Foundation. The NBA will donate $10,000 to his foundation and hand him the Bob Lanier trophy.

According to the league, Maxey launched his foundation over the summer. The NBA star invited children from ages 7-12 to participate in his 1% Better Skills Camp, a free basketball camp that focuses on basic training. The camp also granted the participants giveaways and lunch with the star point guard.

"It’s such an honor to receive the NBA Cares Community Assist Award for the offseason," Maxey said. "I’m grateful to even be in a position to make a difference in the lives of Philadelphia- and Dallas-area youth."
