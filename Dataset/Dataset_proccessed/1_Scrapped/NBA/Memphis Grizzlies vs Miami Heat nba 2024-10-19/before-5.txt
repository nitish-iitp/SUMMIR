Watch: Ja Morant and 5’8' Japanese teammate hit the ‘Griddy’ celebration after electric performance
Originally posted on FirstSportz  |  By Ubong Archibong  |  Last updated Oct 15, 2024 10:19 PM ET

To usher in the new NBA season, the Memphis Grizzlies had an open practice at FedExForum, where rookies Cam Spencer , Jaylen Wells , and Zach Edey took part in the annual rookie dancing competition. As the rookies wrapped up their performances, Grizzlies point guard Yuki Kawamura stood off to the side with his teammates, that wasn’t part of the plan as the crowd had other plans.

Fans in the arena began to chant for Kawamura to join the competition, loudly. Not one to say no to entertaining the crowd, he embraced the moment and hit the “griddy” dance, much to the delight of the audience. He was soon joined by Ja Morant, as the pair added the much-needed excitement to the moment.

Not surprisingly, Kawamura’s performance earned him the top spot in the dance competition, which made him the winner of the Grizzlies’ annual event. The Japanese guard has been a fan favorite during training camp, as he has attracted attention from local supporters, media from Japan, and his teammates.

While he is not expected to be ever present in the team, he can add flair and much-needed firepower to a Grizzlies team that are desperate to return to the summit in the hotly contested Western Conference. The Memphis Grizzlies end their preseason with a game against the Miami Heat.

Yuki Kawamura goes viral with no-look pass in preseason game

The Memphis Grizzlies have looked fired up with rookie Zach Edey on their roster. But he isn’t the only one turning heads as first-year guard Yuki Kawamura has emerged as a standout over the past few games. He went viral for a pass to Edey during a game against the Chicago Bulls, and then chose to deliver another highlight-worthy moment against the Indiana Pacers.

This took place during the third quarter of the game against the Pacers, where he executed a no-look pass to Jay Huff that quickly went viral. It has amassed over 49,000 likes on Instagram and 500,000 views on Twitter within hours.

Despite this being his first NBA season, Kawamura had brought valuable experience from his time at the Olympics and the Japanese league, where he played for the Yokohama B-Corsairs. His standout performance during the Olympics, saw him record 29 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists against France.

Zion Williamson gets suspended after playing a single game

The New Orleans Pelicans have learned they can't rely on Zion Williamson to stay healthy. This week, they learned they can't even rely on him to show up for a flight on time. The Pelicans suspended Williamson for Friday's game with the Philadelphia 76ers after he showed up significantly late for the team's flight on Thursday. Williamson apologized to his teammates and to owner Gayle Benson, releasing a statement that said in part: "There is no excuse for being late to team activities. I have apologized to Mrs. Benson and my teammates and coaches and I also owe an apology to the fans. I can and will be better as a teammate and member of this organization." But according to insider Chris Haynes, it's not the first time Williamson has been late this season. The one-game suspension is not simply due to the flight, but to multiple practices where Williamson also showed up late. Since the Pelicans selected Williamson with the No. 1 overall pick in 2019, there have been persistent questions about the All-Star forward's habits and commitment. In 2021, Pelicans beat writer Jake Madison reported that Williamson regularly skipped rehab sessions for a foot injury that ended up costing him the entire season, while also falling asleep in film sessions. At that same time, insiders reported that Williamson's weight had ballooned to 330 pounds due to poor diet and inconsistent workouts. That's well above his listed playing weight of 284 pounds. This week, Williamson looked quite healthy in his first game of the series, scoring 22 points and throwing down spectacular dunks in the Pelicans' 104-97 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Now that his health isn't an issue for now, the Pelicans have to worry once again about Williamson's mindset. Injuries are understandable. Persistent tardiness is not.

Steelers' George Pickens makes interesting move…

Pittsburgh Steelers star wide receiver George Pickens started the 2024 NFL season in dominant fashion, showcasing his ability to take over games and solidify his role as the team’s top playmaker. However, his momentum was derailed by a nagging hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games. Upon returning to the lineup, Pickens found himself underutilized, leaving him visibly frustrated as the Steelers struggled to close out the regular season on a high note. The frustration reached a boiling point during last Saturday’s matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, where Pickens endured one of the worst performances of his career. Targeted six times, he managed only a single catch for zero yards, a stat line that shocked fans and analysts alike. The low point came late in the game when Russell Wilson missed a wide-open Pickens on a potential game-winning play, a misstep that underscored the lack of chemistry between the two in that game. Adding to the intrigue, ESPN’s Brooke Pryor reported that Pickens is now dodging media interviews ahead of the Steelers' critical playoff showdown against the Baltimore Ravens. Whether his silence signals a brewing storm or a focus on redemption, it has only added to the swirling speculation about his mindset and the team’s ability to bounce back. All eyes are on Pickens as the Steelers prepare for one of their most pivotal games of the season. This move by Pickens is likely a strategic one. The Pittsburgh media has often been harsh on the star wide receiver, rarely giving him the benefit of the doubt, even as he continues to produce in an offensive scheme that fails to cater to his strengths. Despite the Steelers’ offensive struggles, Pickens has remained one of the few bright spots. While his frustrations are usually valid, some fans believe he could express them in a more mature manner. Before the Bengals game, Pickens was asked a question that could have sparked tension between him and Wilson. Rather than risk his words being misconstrued, Pickens wisely chose not to answer. This measured response reflects a deliberate effort to avoid unnecessary drama, showing growth in how he handles pressure situations. This week, Pickens seems committed to maintaining his focus and avoiding any distractions as the Steelers prepare for their playoff matchup. By staying silent and locked in, he’s prioritizing the team’s success over external noise, a move that could prove crucial as they face the Ravens. Steelers fans can critique Pickens all they want, but fairness is essential. At just 23 years old, Pickens is widely regarded as one of the most talented offensive players in the league. Yet, he’s like a Lamborghini stuck in a used car dealership — an analogy that perfectly captures how underutilized he’s been during his first three seasons in Pittsburgh. Despite the limitations, Pickens has still managed to deliver big moments for the offense when it mattered most. If the Steelers hope to upset the Ravens in their playoff matchup, they’ll need a standout performance from Pickens. His absence was felt during their 34-17 loss to Baltimore earlier this season, where the offense struggled to find rhythm. A strong game from Pickens could be the key to defying the odds and pulling off a monumental upset against their division rival.

Gary Bettman and the NHL Looking To Make Major CBA Change…

Frank Vatrano recently inked an extension in Anaheim, but with $9 million of deferred money, Commissioner Gary Bettman and the NHL seemingly aren't very happy. The NHL has seen some interesting and very unique contracts over the years, and recently another was signed, as the Anaheim Ducks inked forward Frank Vatrano to a three-year extension, keeping him in Anaheim until he hits 34-years of age. The interesting part of the deal however was the deferred money involved, as both parties looked to get around California state taxes as Vatrano will be paid $900,000 per year from 2035 to 2045, totalling $9 million which will be taxed a lot less if he's out of California by then. While many people found the deal interesting, many also wondered how the league would feel about it, and while they obviously approved it as this breaks no current CBA laws, Elliotte Friedman has revealed that they weren't happy about it, and could look to change that CBA when negotiations for a new deal begin. "While the NHL approved the [Vatrano deferred salary] contract, it is not crazy about these deals and will discuss eliminating them as part of upcoming CBA negotiations." While this seemingly does give teams a way to get around taxes in their current state, that's something that places like Nevada and Florida already get around with no state-tax, so it's unclear exactly why the NHL see this as such an issue. Ultimately though, this was a great deal for Vatrano, as he's still getting paid great money during his playing days in Anaheim, and if any other California teams want to get around this in the same way, it appears as though they have a limited time as the CBA expires in 2025/26, and as of right now, signs point towards the league outlawing this type of deal.

Toronto Maple Leafs Reportedly Set Their Limit On a Potential…

The Toronto Maple Leafs want to bring back Mitch Marner this off-season, and now they've reportedly agreed on a limit that they will pay him to make it happen. For quite some time, the story of a potential Mitch Marner extension has been a huge story in Toronto, and now with his pending free agency quickly approaching, it's about to come to a head, one way or another. In the midst of a career year, Marner's value is continuing to go up, and at 27 years of age with a huge career ahead of him, the time for Marner to cash in with a long-term deal is now. Now, TSN's Pierre LeBrun has weighed in on the situation, noting that the team, much like Colorado doesn't want to make their upcoming free agents their highest-paid players, with Nathan MacKinnon and Auston Matthews currently holding the mantle for their respective teams. "It's not been a headline story which is unbelievable. What I would tell you is that there is no question that part of the dialogue that is a stumbling block is that much like Nathan MacKinnon's cap number much like Mikko Rantanen, they are pointing to Auston Matthews and I understand from a team perspective. So, what does LeBrun think the number is in Toronto? According to him, the team has a hard limit of $13 million, with the team likely happy to pay him around the $12.5 million AAV mark. "It comes down to this. I don't think the Leafs feel they can or will pay more than $13M, $12.5M? Is that enough for an 8-year deal? If that's where it is, that's the I think that's the clear line of demarcation, $13 million a year." At this point in 2024/25, Marner is on track to pass 100 points for the first time in his career, and while many teammates in Toronto want him back, there will be interest around the league, and if the Leafs aren't willing to go over $12.5 million, we may see another team swoop in and land the young star.
