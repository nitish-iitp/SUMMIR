We’re a week away from a new NBA season and this year feels more top heavy than most.

There are a handful of teams with a realistic shot to win the 2025 NBA title, from the defending champion Boston Celtics to the Phoenix Suns. There’s also a group of at least 10 teams that would be lucky to make the play-in, even without finishing with a .500 record.

For the first time in a while, there is not a player on all 30 teams I’d pay to see. The Toronto Raptors, Brooklyn Nets, Washington Wizards and Chicago Bulls will likely get little run on League Pass from me. The Hawks and Clippers could play themselves into that group.

What’s sad is that two of those squads (Atlanta, Washington) have the top two picks in the 2024 draft on their rosters.

We haven’t had a repeat champ since 2018, but execs believe Boston has a great shot to win its second straight NBA title. The Celtics chief competition looks to come from the group of Oklahoma City, Denver, New York, Philadelphia and Minnesota. Some other contenders will emerge, with players like Ja Morant returning from injury, and Giannis Antetokounmpo being on a mission after seemingly being surpassed in the “Best Player in the World” rankings.

On the other end, there are at least 10 teams with no hope.

Washington looks devoid of talent, despite bringing in top-2 draft pick Alex Sarr. Chicago is in a perpetual state of limbo, though the return of point guard Lonzo Ball could give the Bulls a boost. Atlanta is a bad start away from trading Trae Young.

So where does everybody start?
