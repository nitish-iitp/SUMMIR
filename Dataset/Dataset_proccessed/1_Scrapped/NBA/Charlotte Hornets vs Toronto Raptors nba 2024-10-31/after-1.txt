The Raptors shot 57.1 percent from the floor. Poeltl made 10 of 14 shots and Dick finished 11-for-17 to help compensate for the team’s 32.1 percent (9-for-28) accuracy on 3-pointers.

There were waves of points scored by both teams. Toronto, which trailed by as many as 23 points with less than seven minutes to go in the first half, grabbed the lead with just over six minutes remaining in the third quarter.

Charlotte broke 100 points by the end of the third to lead 103-96 entering the fourth. Mann’s 3-pointer gave the Hornets a 109-97 lead early in the quarter, but the Raptors had several spurts, including Barrett’s five straight points to pull within 127-121.

Mitchell made a free throw and a layup to close within 130-127. Two free throws apiece from Mann, Martin and Williams helped seal the win for the hosts.
