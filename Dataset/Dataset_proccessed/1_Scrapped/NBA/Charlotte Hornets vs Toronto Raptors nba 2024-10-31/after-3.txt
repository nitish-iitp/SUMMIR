Recap/Analysis: Hornets hold off Raptors

Tre Mann and Cody Martin combined for 52 points off the bench as the Charlotte Hornets held off the Toronto Raptors for a 138-133 win.

THE SUMMARY

The Hornets needed to start fast, so they scored the first nine points of the game. The Raptors took a timeout, and it completely broke the Hornets momentum. They scored two points in the next four-and-a-half minutes. Cody Martin and Tre Mann helped fix that by spurring a 13-0 run that put the Hornets up double figures after one despite LaMelo Ball not scoring a point.

The Hornets superstar got going in the second quarter and scored points in bunches of threes. The Hornets led by as many as 23 but went ice cold after Ball and Josh Green went to the bench. The Raptors scored 14 straight points to keep the Hornets within reach. In all, the Hornets let the Raptors score 43 points in the second quarter alone and only led by five at the half.

The defense did not get better in the early parts of the second half. At one point, the Raptors had a stretch where they made 25 out of 33 shots. Despite continuing to score the ball well, the Hornets couldn’t create any separation and eventually lost the lead to the Raptors at the midway point of the quarter. They hung around and used a 12-0 run to close the quarter and reclaim their lead.

The teams continued going shot for shot well into the fourth quarter. Cody Martin did a bulk of the scoring for the Hornets, as per usual. The Hornets made a few attempts to pull away, but the Raptors wouldn’t let it happen. RJ Barrett hit a few tough shots down the stretch to keep the Hornets from putting it on ice, but the Hornets held off long enough to make it a free throw contest. They converted at the line to keep the Raptors from ever threatening at the 11th hour.

THE GOOD

Cody Martin had the best offensive game we’ve seen from him. He scored a career high 25 points and hit four 3-pointers. But it’s more than just the point total; it was the way he got the points. He hit a couple of pull-up midrange jumpers, and a couple of his threes were quick shots with a hand in his face.

His backcourt-mate off the bench had a huge game as well. Tre Mann scored 27 points and looked like the problem he was in the preseason once again. He hit a few timely threes and was all over the place on the offensive end on the floor. When he was on the court, most of the offense ran through him. He’s now averaging over 20 points per game on the season.

Nick Richards had one of, if not his best game as a Hornet as well. He finished with 24 points, 14 rebounds, four assists, and four blocks. He was all over the offensive glass and punished the Raptors on that end of the floor. You’d maybe not like to see Jakob Poeltl put up such a similar stat line on the other end, but that’s picking nits.

Josh Green played limited minutes, but he showed why he’s a seamless fit with this team. He hit 3-of-4 3-point attempts and made several high effort and high IQ plays.

Grant Williams scored a rather quiet 17 points off the bench. He’s been a knockdown outside shooter so far this season.

THE BAD

He had a decent game overall, but LaMelo Ball had a few very reckless shots. You take the good with the bad I suppose.

Miles Bridges had his second game this season where he just wasn’t at the races. The only time he was really noticeable was during a second quarter stretch where he forced a few bad shots up in rapid succession. He only played 24 minutes, so the staff must not have been too keen on what they were seeing given how well some of the bench players were playing.

The Hornets let a shorthanded Raptors team shoot 57% from the field. Some of that was tough shot making that wouldn’t be sustainable over a larger sample size, but a lot of it was the Hornets just letting the Raptors by too easy. A lot of guys got beat too easily on the perimeter and there just wasn’t enough help at the rim to make up for it. You should typically win pretty comfortably if you win the 3-point battle 20-9.

WHAT’S NEXT

The Hornets hang out in Charlotte before hosting the Celtics on back to back nights Friday and Saturday.

This game had me nervous for most of the second half. Luckily, we found a way to pull it off. We’re going to have to play better individual and group defense moving forward. I believe we would be u defeated right now if we played better defense. Offensively, we have 6 players who are capable of putting up 25 to 30 ppg on any given night. That’s pretty refreshing.

tonight the second unit as a whole seemed more cohesive than starters. I loved also what I saw from Tidjane, happy that Lee rewarded him with minutes

yeah big ups for TJ – got his first NBA points, 3/3/3 in 16 quiet minutes

and honestly, thats exactly what you want from TJ right now – QUIET minutes, shows he can play within himself, within the system, and contain that energizer bunny when he needs to. There will be plenty of time to pad the stats and be an impact player after he tightens up his game.

call me crazy, maybe we can split these 2 games with Boston and keep it .500
we’ll be at home, we’re scrappy (we stole one from boston last year), and we also have COACH LEE who knows all their secrets

Do the Celtics really have secrets at this point?

It’s no secret, they have some great players and they know how to play together and win.

I actually don’t have any issue with Miles’ offense right now. He sounded like he was content with being the 3rd of our Big 3. But, I was excited about him talking up defense. Seems like it was just talk so far. I didn’t expect him to run after Dick, but I would’ve expected him to take on the challenge of slowing down R.J. Barrett. Last night also proved to me that we don’t have to have Micic on the court right now. Tre and CoMart handled PG2 just fine.

I don’t want to see Micic on the court anything soon! He’s not the same PG as last year. I’m not sure what happened but it just doesn’t click when he’s on the court this year.

OAN, I can’t wait to get B. Miller back to add more scoring power and defense. Defense, Hornets did a piss poor job in the 2nd half of slowing the ball down in transition. Raptors could have easily stole the game if he weren’t sound on our FTs. That made me uneasy.

It could be as simple as teams have film on the guy now.

Seems like he spent the time in between Olympics and preseason on full tilt vacation and came back out of shape and out of rhythm.

I have to believe he has played and will play better than we’ve seen this year.

If he does, it’s a boon for us. But, if not, he’ll be a serious liability on the floor.

He’s been terrible. My earlier optimism now looks quite misplaced.

Small sample, but something doesn’t seem right with Miles on either end beyond execution – its the intensity that is missing IMO.

Maybe it’s him recognizing it’s a long season, rust, or playing through injury. It feels off especially since in so many previous seasons, Miles has been the player either modeling or urging others to play with commitment and conviction. Soft layup attempts and flatfooted defense from him looks especially jarring when the rest of the team is noticeably playing harder and with high energy compared to the past couple of years.

Hoping the offense is rust. He’s never gonna be a stopper, but he can be better defensively.

My current working hypothesis: The people who scheduled us to play the Celtics two days in a row are the same people who hired the same magician to do the exact same halftime act twice in one week.

I had a couple nice chuckles watching the game today, at the commentary around Toronto Raptor Gradey Dick.

Dell just said: “I’m impressed with second year player Dick!”

I’m thinking that Gradey’s nickname should be “Grade A”.
