Chet Holmgren Out at Least 8-10 Weeks With Fractured Pelvis

The Oklahoma City Thunder will have to play without starting big man Chet Holmgren for at least at least eight to 10 weeks. Holmgren sustained a right iliac wing fracture after he took a hard fall in the first quarter of OKC’s 127-116 home loss to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday, the organization announced. The right iliac wing is part of the pelvis.

“Holmgren is expected to return during the 2024-25 season, and an update on his return-to-play protocol will be provided in eight-to-ten weeks,” the Thunder said in its release.

Holmgren has averaged 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 2.6 blocks while shooting 37.8% on 3s through 10 games this season. OKC has gotten off to an 8-2 start, good enough for third best in the Western Conference.

Holmgren placed No. 2 in Rookie of the Year voting last season. The 7-foot-1 center played in all 82 regular-season games and all of OKC’s 10 postseason games.

Holmgren was rafted No. 2 overall in the 2022 NBA Draft, but he missed the entire 2022-23 season with a foot injury.

Holmgren’s latest injury makes OKC thin in the frontcourt. Newly-acquired center Isaiah Hartenstein has been out this season with a fractured left hand. If the timeline OKC gave in October is still accurate, Hartenstein is expected to be reevaluated in about two to three weeks.
