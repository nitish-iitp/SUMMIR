1. CHAMPIONSHIP CULTURES COLLIDE IN ABU DHABI

Did someone say appointment TV? Well, sit back, relax and enjoy the show because the 2024-25 NBA preseason is just hours away, with the Nuggets and Celtics set to square off in Abu Dhabi (12 ET, NBA TV).

Friday’s opening matchup doesn’t just feature the past two title winners, the reigning Kia NBA MVP Nikola Jokic, 2023-24 All-NBA First-Team member Jayson Tatum and eight total All-Stars — it spotlights two franchises that have laid the blueprint for consistent success.

Over the past three seasons, nobody in the NBA has more regular-season wins than the Nuggets (158) and Celtics (172), who each used the same winning formula to summit the mountain top in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Homegrown Stars: Both teams found superstars in the Draft, with Boston selecting Jaylen Brown (2016) and Jayson Tatum (2017) in consecutive years, while Denver landed Nikola Jokic (2014) and Jamal Murray (2016)
Right Role Players: The Nuggets then built on their foundation by drafting Michael Porter Jr. in 2018 and acquiring Aaron Gordon in 2021. One year later, the C’s added key contributors in Derrick White and Al Horford
Missing Pieces: After four straight Playoff exits, Denver strengthened its rotation by adding Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Bruce Brown and Christian Braun for the 2022-23 season
One year later, Boston, having reached five ECF in seven seasons, bolstered its lineup with Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis
Patience Pays Off: In 2023, the Nuggets claimed their first-ever title. One season later, the Celtics hoisted the Larry O’Brien Trophy for the first time since 2008

Although the two teams followed the same championship recipe, they applied different offseason strategies, with Boston running it back while adding two young shooters and Denver retooling to replace two core vets.

C’s To See: In addition to retaining 15 players from its title team — which led the NBA in made 3s last season — Boston added Lonnie Walker IV (38.4 3P% in 2023-24) in free agency and drafted Baylor Scheierman (39.0 3P% in NCAA) out of Creighton
New Nuggets To Watch: On the other hand, Denver lost Caldwell-Pope (10.1 ppg in 2024-25) and Reggie Jackson (10.2 ppg in 2024-25) in free agency this summer before signing Russell Westbrook (11.1 ppg in 2023-24) and Dario Saric (8.0 ppg in 23-24)

Despite the different offseason approaches, both Boston and Denver enter 2024-25 with the same goal, and each of their coaches expect to accomplish it.

Celtics Coach Joe Mazzulla: “We want to win a championship every single year … That’s the standard. That’s the expectation.”
Nuggets Coach Michael Malone: “I look forward to building on what we’ve done the last six seasons and winning a championship.”

2. ABU DHABI ALL-ACCESS: THE DAY BEFORE DAY 1

One day before beginning their 2024-25 title quest, both the Celtics and Nuggets took time to give back to the community in Abu Dhabi.

After Nikola Jokic, Russell Westbrook and Denver galvanized the next generation of hoopers at Tuesday’s NBA Cares clinic, the Celtics passed along their hoops knowledge on Wednesday.

X’s & O’s With JT: Jayson Tatum helps a young group of ballers work on their handles before breaking down the huddle
“It’s great being on the other side of the world and seeing how the game has grown,” said Tatum. “They’re excited that we’re here and we’re excited to be here.”

Outside the arena, the Nuggets teamed up with student volunteers for a ‘Nurdle Hunt’ at Jumeirah Beach, helping to gather and remove ‘nurdles’ — small plastic pellets used in the production of plastic that can find their way into the ocean.

Can’t Stop Coach Malone: Michael Malone will never turn off his competitive side, even when leading ‘Team 2’ in a friendly competition of Nurdle hunting

Then, Denver locked in for a final practice and media session, where veteran big man DeAndre Jordan took on a fun challenge — trying to unscramble his 17 Media Day headshots.

3. STARRY NIGHT: MORE PRESEASON HOOPS AWAIT

The action doesn’t stop after the preseason opener in Abu Dhabi. Friday features two more matchups to get the preseason going as the New Zealand Breakers take on the Jazz before the T-Wolves face the Lakers.

New Zealand Breakers at Jazz (9 ET, NBA League Pass): How will one of the best teams in Australia’s National Basketball League (NBL) fare against Lauri Markkanen and the Jazz?

The Recent History: 2024-25 marks the third straight preseason featuring at least one NBL vs. NBA game, with the NBA leading the series 5-1
Round 2: Tonight’s meeting will be a rematch from last preseason when Utah defeated New Zealand 114-94 behind Markkanen’s 15 points and seven boards
Players To Watch: Three notable 2024 Draft picks are expected to suit up for Utah: Cody Williams (No. 10 pick), the younger brother of OKC star Jalen Williams; Isaiah Collier (No. 29), a standout guard from USC; and former Duke All-American Kyle Filipowski (No. 32)

Timberwolves at Lakers (10:30 ET, NBA TV): What can we expect when Anthony Edwards and the new-look Wolves face LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the Lakers, with Bronny James expected to make his preseason debut?

Setting The Stage: The Lakers selected Bronny with the No. 55 pick in the 2024 Draft, making the NBA’s first active father-son duo. No father and son pairing has ever played together in an NBA game
Measuring Stick: Now entering his 22nd NBA season, LeBron will look to help the Lakers bounce back from last year’s first-round Playoff exit and will get an early test tonight against last year’s Western Conference Finalists
New To The Pack: On the other side, the Wolves will be making their first appearance since trading Karl-Anthony Towns to the Knicks for fellow All-Star Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo, whose availability for tonight are unknown

Preseason hoops continues tomorrow in Honolulu, as Stephen Curry and the Warriors make their first outing of the 2024-25 season against James Harden and the Clippers in a standalone Saturday game.

Warriors vs. Clippers (7 ET, NBA TV | Honolulu, HI)

Then, Sunday delivers a five-game slate to wrap up the weekend, headlined by the second and final game from Abu Dhabi and the 10th edition of the Canada Series.

Nuggets vs. Celtics (10 a.m. ET, NBA TV | NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2024)
Knicks at Hornets (5 ET, NBA TV)
Wizards vs. Raptors (7:30 ET, NBA League Pass | NBA Canada Series)
Bucks at Pistons (8 ET, ESPN)
Suns at Lakers (9:30 ET, NBA League Pass)

4. W SEMIFINALS PREVIEW: A PAIR OF PIVOTAL GAME 3s

Lynx at Sun, 7:30 ET, ESPN2 (Series Tied 1-1): After splitting the first two games in Minnesota, the best-of-five semifinals has shifted to Connecticut for the next two games.

How Important Is Game 3? When a series is tied 1-1, the winner of Game 3 has gone on to win the series 58.8% of the time (10-7) with 11 of the 17 series going the full five games
Lynx Players To Watch: Napheesa Collier is averaging a double-double (14 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.5 bpg) but her scoring efficiency is down (33.3% FG, 16.7% 3P). Former Sun Courtney Williams came up big in Minnesota’s Game 2 win; can she repeat that effort in Game 3?
Sun Players To Watch: Alyssa Thomas (17.5 ppg, 10 rpg, 8 apg, 2.5 spg) and Marina Mabrey (17.5 ppg, 4 3pg) have shared the bulk of the scoring load. DeWanna Bonner (13.5 ppg on 28.1% shooting) needs seven points to pass Candace Parker for 2nd on the all-time Playoff scoring list

Liberty at Aces, 9:30 ET, ESPN2 (NY Leads 2-0): Can the Liberty avenge their 2023 Finals loss by completing a sweep of the Aces in 2024? Or will the Aces take the first step toward a potentially historic comeback and keep their three-peat hopes alive?

Playoff History: The WNBA has used a best-of-five format in the Finals since 2005 and the Semifinals since 2016. In that time, 18 teams have gone up 2-0 in a series – and all 18 have gone on to win the series, including 13 ending in sweeps
Tables Turned: The last team to win Game 3 after being down 2-0 was the Liberty in the 2023 Finals against the Aces, but Las Vegas won the series in four games
Only One: In the 2018 Semifinals against Seattle, Phoenix became the only team to force a winner-take-all Game 5 after dropping the first two games of the series. Can the Aces defend their home court on Friday and Sunday to join them?
Players To Watch: Breanna Stewart (24.5 ppg) and Sabrina Ionescu (22.5 ppg) have combined for 47 ppg (or 58% of New York’s offense). A’ja Wilson (22.5 ppg, 58.8% shooting) is the only Ace shooting at least 44% in the series

5. CLARK NAMED ROY AFTER HISTORIC SEASON

Few players have entered the WNBA with more hype than Caitlin Clark. She was the top pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft by Indiana following a college career that saw her score more points than any player – men’s or women’s – in NCAA Division I basketball history.

Not only did Clark live up to the hype, she exceeded expectations by putting together a historic debut WNBA season that culminated with a Kia WNBA Rookie of the Year Award on Thursday.

Clark appeared in all 40 games, fueling a seven-win improvement as Indiana posted its best record – and made its first Playoff appearance – in eight seasons
Elite Company: Clark joined Candace Parker (the only rookie to win MVP in 2008), Elena Delle Donne (3rd, 2013), Diana Taurasi (3rd, 2004) and Tamika Catchings (3rd, 2002) as the only rookies to finish in the top five in MVP voting

The stats are only part of the story. Clark, along with ROY runner-up Angel Reese of the Sky, helped spark the WNBA to its most-watched regular season in 24 years, highest attendance in 22 years and record-setting digital consumption and merchandise sales.

Box Office: The Fever saw a 319% increase in attendance in 2024 and were part of three games to draw at least 20,000 fans, including a single-game record crowd of 20,711 on Sept. 19 against the Mystics

Clark received 66 ROY votes from a national panel of 67 sportswriters and broadcasters. Reese received the other vote after a record-breaking rookie season of her own.

Reese posted the highest-ever rebound average (13.1 rpg) and had the longest double-double streak (15 games) of any player in league history
Clark and Reese led the All-Rookie Team that also included L.A.’s Rickea Jackson, Chicago’s Kamilla Cardoso and New York’s Leonie Fiebich
