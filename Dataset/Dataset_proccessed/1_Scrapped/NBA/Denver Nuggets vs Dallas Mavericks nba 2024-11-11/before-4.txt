Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best picks on Monday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	LeBron James (LAL, PF/SF)	$19,200	59.4	3.1
Value	Jared McCain (PHI, PG/SG)	$8,590	29.9	3.5
Fade	Buddy Hield (GSW, SG/SF)	$11,680	22.5	1.9
Cheapie	Rui Hachimura (LAL, SF/PF)	$9,530	30.3	3.2

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Positional Breakdown
PG (Point Guard)
Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K

Conclusion

When building your NBA Monday teams, consider starting with a value player like Jared McCain. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, LeBron James is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Rui Hachimura.

On the other hand, according to our model, Buddy Hield is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
