DeMar DeRozan scored 27 points, including 11 in a commanding fourth quarter, to lead the Sacramento Kings to a 122-107 win over the visiting Toronto Raptors in the NBA on Wednesday.

Keegan Murray combined 22 points with 12 rebounds, De’Aaron Fox contributed 21, and Domantas Sabonis notched his 61st career triple-double — and second in five days — with 17 points, 11 boards and 13 assists.

The Kings quickly erased the deficit and moved ahead 57-54 at intermission.

Barrett hit a tough, off-balance drive to give the Raptors the lead back before the visitors, who hit only 4 of 18 triples in the first half, busted Sacramento’s zone defense with four treys in the first five minutes to go up 77-69 on three successive Jakob Poeltl baskets.

The Raptors were still in front by six early in the fourth before the Kings turned the arm-wrestle around dramatically, gaining total control at both ends.
