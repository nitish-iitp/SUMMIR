Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best picks on Thursday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Domantas Sabonis (SAC, C)	$19,440	59.2	3
Value	Domantas Sabonis (SAC, C)	$19,440	59.2	3
Fade	Gradey Dick (TOR, SG/SF)	$14,750	25.7	1.7
Cheapie	Jonathan Mogbo (TOR, PF)	$7,400	21	2.8

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Thursday Late teams, consider starting with a value player like Domantas Sabonis. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Domantas Sabonis is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Jonathan Mogbo.

On the other hand, according to our model, Gradey Dick is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building out multiple line-ups.
