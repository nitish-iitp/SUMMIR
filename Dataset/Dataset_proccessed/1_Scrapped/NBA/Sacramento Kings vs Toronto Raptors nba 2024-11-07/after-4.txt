SACRAMENTO KINGS
Photo: Kings' Vivek Ranadive Wears 'They Not Like Us' Shirt amid Drake-DeRozan Beef

Sacramento Kings veteran DeMar DeRozan received a show of support from team owner Vivek Ranadive amid his simmering feud with Drake.

While sitting courtside at Wednesday night's game against the Toronto Raptors, Ranadive was seen wearing a shirt that read "They Not Like Us," referencing hip-hop star Kendrick Lamar's hit record that dissed Drake over the summer.

While making a guest appearance on commentary during Saturday's matchup between the Raptors and Kings, Drake made it clear that there was no love lost between him and DeRozan.

When asked if DeRozan, who spent the first nine years of his career with the Raptors, should have his jersey retired by the team, Drake responded, "If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I'll go up there and pull it down myself."

DeRozan fired back by saying, "He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down."

DeRozan and Drake were once close friends, but their relationship understandably changed after this year's beef between Drake and Lamar. DeRozan and Lamar are both natives of Compton, California, and also share a close bond, and the six-time NBA All-Star appeared on stage alongside the 17-time Grammy Award-winning rapper while he performed "Not Like Us" during a concert over the summer. DeRozan also appeared in the music video for the song.

The Kings and Raptors will not face each other again this season, so perhaps this will mark the end of the squabble between DeRozan and Drake.
