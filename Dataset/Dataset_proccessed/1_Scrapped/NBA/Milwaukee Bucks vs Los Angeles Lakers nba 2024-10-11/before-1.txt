Hungary hosts the Netherlands hoping to end a 40-year winless streak against the Oranje on Friday. Watch the game live and for free on Fubo.

Marco Rossi is in a race against time to get Hungary firing again as UEFA Nations League rival the Netherlands visits Budapest on Friday looking to expand its cushion in the Group A3 pecking order. The Oranje are second only to Germany in their pool and level on points as things stand, while the Hungarians are still seeking their first win of the competition heading into Matchday 3. The Magyars sit at the bottom of the table for the time being and haven’t managed to beat the Netherlands since 1982. They are hoping to resurrect some of the imperious form they conjured prior to this summer.

Rossi & Co managed to piece together an incredible 14-game unbeaten run before a shock defeat to the Republic of Ireland in the build-up to Euro 2024.

A single group win over Scotland wasn’t sufficient to reach the knockout stages in Germany, and the Magyars have looked similarly goal-shy in the Nations League having failed to score after two games.

Robin van Persie bagged a hat-trick when the Netherlands walloped Hungary 8-1 in their most recent encounter during qualifying for the 2014 World Cup.

And unlike Hungary, the goals have been flying for Ronald Koeman’s side of late, scoring seven across their two Nations League outings thus far and drawing 2-2 with Germany last time out.

Koeman will be without the likes of Nathan Ake, Jurrien Timber, Teun Koopmeiners and Frenkie de Jong due to injury, but the Oranje should have enough in reserve to continue their unbeaten run.

Regional restrictions may apply.
