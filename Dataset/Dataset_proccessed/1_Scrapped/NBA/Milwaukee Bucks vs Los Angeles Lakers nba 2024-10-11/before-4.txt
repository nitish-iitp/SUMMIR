Giannis Antetokounmpo stats vs LA Lakers on Oct. 10 (Image Source: IMAGN)

Giannis Antetokounmpo made his first preseason appearance for the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday against the LA Lakers. The two-time MVP, who sat out in Milwaukee’s 120-87 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, hoped to help his team bounce back. Bucks fans got their first look at Antetokounmpo going up against Lakers superstars Anthony Davis and LeBron James.

The “Greek Freak” put on a show in the first half, finishing with 20 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks. One of those swats was perhaps the highlight reel of the night. Antetokounmpo chased James and emphatically rejected the four-time MVP’s layup at the rim.

What was Giannis Antetokounmpo's impact on the game?

Giannis Antetokounmpo's impact against the LA Lakers was what NBA fans have been accustomed to seeing from him. Despite LA's defense focused on him, he was nearly unstoppable when he got inside the paint. Anthony Davis' block on him in the second quarter also pushed him to be even more aggressive.

A full training camp with superstar guard Damian Lillard made their chemistry more fluid. The pick-and-roll action between the two looked smoother than last season. Antetokounmpo didn't crowd "Dame Time," giving both enough space to make the play efficient.

Perhaps Antetokounmpo's biggest impact was on the defensive end. The 2020 Defensive Player of the Year winner showed off his versatility on that end. He defended all positions on the floor with no issues.

Bucks center Brook Lopez looked slow against Anthony Davis and the Greek often covered for him. Antetokounmpo exploded on offense tonight but his defense was just as impactful.
