The Indiana Pacers cruised to a convincing 129-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls last night, extending their winning streak to four games. Pascal Siakam led the charge with 26 points, while Thomas Bryant added a season-high 22 points and 8 rebounds. Tyrese Haliburton continued his impressive play with 16 points and 13 assists, orchestrating the Pacers' efficient offense. The Bulls, despite Zach LaVine's 31 points, struggled to keep pace with Indiana's offensive firepower and couldn't overcome a significant early deficit.
