Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best picks on Saturday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	De'Aaron Fox (SAC, PG)	$18,300	46.3	2.5
Value	Andrew Wiggins (GSW, PF/SF)	$11,310	33.6	3
Fade	Jake LaRavia (MEM, PF)	$10,010	9.4	0.9
Cheapie	Brandon Clarke (MEM, PF/C)	$6,440	16.4	2.6

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Late Saturday teams, consider starting with a value player like Andrew Wiggins. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, De'Aaron Fox is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Brandon Clarke.

On the other hand, according to our model, Jake LaRavia is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
