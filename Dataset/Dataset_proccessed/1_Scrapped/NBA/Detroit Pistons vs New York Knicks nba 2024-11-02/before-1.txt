just said Randle is a better defender than KAT. There's no way lol
Randle is a talented scorer  
nygiants16 : 11/1/2024 10:10 pm : link
can give you 25 10 and 5 but its just different eith Towns, its so effecient, it just comes in the flow, nothing feels forced and very rarely is it iso..

When you are gettinf 6 guys in double figures, 3 guys with over 20 it means your stars are incredibly effecient ..
I know there will be reversion to the mean

"Karl-Anthony Towns joins Patrick Ewing as the only Knicks to record 100+ PTS & 50+ REB in their first five games with the franchise."


"Most PTS in first five games as a Knick:

130 — Carmelo Anthony
111 — Karl-Anthony Towns"


Towns is now averaging 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.0 assists per contest while shooting 54.9% from the field and 64.7% from the three-point range in five games with the Knicks.
Wolves-Nuggets  
shyster : 11/2/2024 2:32 am : link
Minny prevails 119-116 with a 15-2 run to overcome a 10 point deficit in the final 3:13.

They had three guards on the court for the winning run, none of whom were DDV (Edwards, Conley and Nickeil Alexander-Walker).

Randle was on the court but did not have a shot, rebound or assist in the final 3:59. He had a good offensive line in the box score, but had been -27 in 33 minutes before the final 3:13 left him with a -14.

The Wolves' winning run was pretty much all the doing of Alexander-Walker and Edwards, with Rudy Gobert contributing a rebound and two final FTs after a take foul.

It's going to be interesting to see how DDV fits in Minny. He's not really a point guard, but has Nickeil-Walker blocking him from being even the backup SG.

Exactly. We simply cannot take anything Jefferson says about the Knicks seriously. He’s embarrassing when it comes to the Knicks and it’s completely unprofessional in his role. Fans can be petty with their hatred of certain teams. National broadcasters should be better than that

I wasn't a Randle hater, but he usually wasn't a quick passer. Sometimes, he seemed like a reluctant passer. He'd often pass out of desperation, after he was doubled and had no shot.

It was quite literally the best three point shooting game of all time. I don’t think you have to squint too hard to see that it may have been a good humbling experience for this Knicks team that was nothing but gassed up all offseason.
Houston up next -

steve in ky : 11/2/2024 10:41 am : link
“When we work together,” Tom Thibodeau said, “our offense is going to be really good.”

“KAT and his skill set, you have to be up on him,” Thibodeau said. “And then what it does is it opens up the cutting, and the harder we cut, the more we’re going to get easy buckets, we’re going to get open 3s. “And then his willingness to share the ball and make plays for his teammates. And with Jalen, they’re developing really good chemistry off it.”

Yeah I cannot think of a less deserved rep. He took it right at Isaiah Stewart who at this point is probably most well known for getting into fights. Jawed at him a bit too.
Three last random thoughts:  
Jon In NYC : 11/2/2024 1:15 pm : link
1. Jalen Duren, who I wanted really badly during the offseason, looks absolutely terrible. 0 spacial awareness. 18 minutes after 10 minutes the game before and it would not surprise me at all if Isiah Stewart becomes the starter there at some point.

2. I give full credit to Josh Hart for really finding his rhythm in this offense. He was really struggling in the preseason I thought and was even bitching to the media bit, but he's averaging 14-10-4-1.4 on 55% from the field and 28% from three.

Him figuring out the three is really the last infinity stone, not unlike Derrick White for the Celtics going from a 30% career three point shooter to 38% in one offseason.

But until then, and even then, they need his rebounding, especially crashing the offensive glass. OG is not a great rebounder, and Bridges is better than expected but I really hope the Knicks don't lose their identity as a plus rebounding team and Hart staying aggressive there is key to that.

3. OG has started posting up smaller guards/forwards which is something I don't think I saw at all last season. And he's converting far more than not. Strong, good touch, good footwork. He just can't dribble for shit for whatever reason and probably never will be able to. But it's a good way to manufacture offense for him.

Interested to see how they handle Mitch. We’ve seen how impactful he can be against Philly and Cleveland, and we can’t just take those teams for granted in our pursuit of Boston.

Hmm that 99 team was real good..but the 94 team had Ewing in his prime.⁸
This team vs. the 90s teams  
Dr. D : 11/2/2024 4:51 pm : link
I always felt that when Ewing was in his prime, the FO failed to surround him with enough talent to win a title. I think for most of those years, Jordan had a better supporting cast than Ewing had. Pippen was voted a top 75 player of all time (Horace Grant & the Worm were pretty good too). With all due respect, Starks and Oak were nice role players, but might not be in the top 750 of all time.

On the '93/94 team Starks was counted on to be the #2 scorer and we saw how that worked out vs Houston. On a real championship caliber team, Starks wouldn't have been counted on for that . 6th man or #3 or 4 with a better SF or PF, but not #2.

'93/94 finished 57-25 reg season.
Ewing 24.5 ppg
Starks 19 (inefficient pts many nights)
Oak 11.9 (pretty 2 dimensional)
C. Smith 10 (don't get me started)
Rivers 7.5
The team averaged 98.5 ppg

Starks might not be starting on the '24 team and he wouldn't have been asked to keep shooting on as horrible a night as he had vs. Houston in the finals. The current team has other guys to go to.

By '98/99, Ewing was past his prime, as was LJ.

Ewing 17.3 ppg
Sprewell 16.4
Houston 16.3
LJ 12.0
Ward 7.6
Camby 7.2

It was a shortened season and they finished 27-23 in reg season, averaged 86.4 pts/game.

I think with time, the '24 team will be a good defensive team, relatively comparable to the '90s teams, but the O is far superior.

This team has 4-5 good shooters (counting Deuce), 3 or 4 of them can score 20+ efficiently on any given night. The 90s teams didn't have that. We'd have at least 1 championship if they did. I know the current team doesn't have a title yet either, but I'm more optimistic about that than I ever was during the 90s.

Sorry for the size but this is a great photo...

If it’s on a nationally televised network like ESPN or TNT it gets blacked out for three days, and if they are playing a team that considers my location a local market of theirs is blacked out until I believe three hours after game is over.

I was able to watch the Piston game with League Pass and the Heat game but the Heat game maybe was ESPN, I don’t really remember for sure. If it wasn’t then with league pass because I watched it

Because Year 2 is a team option for New York, the Knicks can decline that option, make Hukporti a RFA this summer and sign him to a longer-term deal.

That's the likely path this will take.
Hukporti has been a pleasant surprise.
