This is the essence of the debate that people are missing. In most cases, the 3s are replacing long 2s and not dunks or layups. So it's still a jump shot, the attempts are just from a foot or two farther back. And moving the line back wouldn't really affect it, because so many guys are already just bombing away from well behind the line.


Succinctly put.

I don't think it matters where a shot comes from so much as the team work that is used to create a shot. Endless iso ball for instance is boring and it doesn't matter whether the shot is from 12 ft or from 25. Teams playing smart bb is what is fun to watch imo. Combined with world class skill and athleticism.

Indeed, there's a great deal more quality passing in team offenses than was common in the early 2000s (for most teams), that's for sure.

It's too efficient. It's time to get rid of corner threes and move the line back accordingly. Then go from there. This isn't about the top shooters who will still excel, it's about all of the rest that are taking way more than most people want to watch.

Too many are threes are taken every game. It's like a video game. Lower the efficiency enough and three point shots will go down. And the ones still taking them are the better shooters anyway. Corner threes are a joke.

It's funny that Anthony Edwards of all people is being flamed for this on social media today. This is a guy who was under 33% on 3-pointers in his rookie season. But he has worked on his 3-point shot every offseason and has even tweaked his form. His percentages have improved in basically every season.

In five seasons, he has brought his 3-point accuracy from Monta Ellis levels to Steph Curry levels, but people think he shoots too much? Makes no sense.

One of the things I like about the Clippers this season is that they are scoring far more in the paint and shooting way less 3pt shots. This has translated into a more dynamic and entertaining squad to watch. Add the additional effort on defense and even if the team does not make the playoffs, the regular season is going to be more interesting from a fan perspective.

Its a far cry from last season where almost half the shots were a 3pt (partly due to PG13 taking 8+ attempts per game).

That isn't what I asked. Threes are just jumpers. The proportion of long jumpers won't actually change if you remove the 3.

Is the proportion of corner 3s up much? It's much more the case that teams are shooting more above-break 3s...

I bet they will. And even so it's not about jumpers. It's about three pointers being more efficient than two pointers now. It should never be like that except for the very best shooters imo.

What wait? So your punishing teams and players overall for actively honing in a skill just because teams of yesteryear didn't

That's bogus thinking.

Talk about an elitist mentality

Whose fault is it for taking shoddy long midrange 2's?

The % of jumpers will always be high because its basketball where you put the ball into the basket.

And before saying its the 3. The 3 has been there for 30+ years now. Plenty of time to break the game.

The 3s have always been a more efficient shot, it's simple math. They just didn't pay attention to that in the olden days.

i said this 10yrs ago...but its not only the 3, much as i hate it.the nba has homogenized. positionless players is the worst thing to happen to basketball

schools recruit the same type and the pros scout the same type, and teams draft the same type. though while i said it's not just the 3, the 3 is the root cause of it all

thus no,,,a center isnt more well rounded if he develops a 3 shot, he's not better if he gets a 3, nor will he affect the game shooting it

10 2 point shots at 50% = 10pts
10 3 point shots at 30% = 9pts

Simple math. Thing is shots don't happen in isolation. Where the players are after the shot is made or missed can be very important. It will effect rebound rate and initiating defense. There is also a difference of foul rate between 3pt shots and 2 point shots. Not going to check but surely the foul rate is higher on 2pt shots than 3pt shots.

Instead of changing the rules, maybe try enfourcing the present rules better, such as moving screens and dribble violations. Just doing that might change the whole argument

Silver is a reactionary commissioner not a proactive one. Fans have seen this culminating for 10 years now and virtually no rules have been tweaked to better balance it. Not until viewership is down 50% will he do something.

I watched the last few minutes of regulation and all of OT of the Celtics-Pacers game last night.

In the first two-and-a-half minutes of OT, there were 8 three point shots taken between the two teams. The only shot attempts that weren't threes during that time came on putbacks after the missed threes. And there were a lot of misses. Only 2 out of those 8 threes went in.

And it's not like these were the kind of three point attempts that resulted from cuts and screens and good ball movements. These were mostly shots by primary ball handlers. Both teams went up the court, passed it to a guy, he dribbled until the shot clock was running out and then took a three. They were all contested.

The Celtics took 9 shots in the OT of which 6 were from beyond the arc. The Pacers took 10 shots and 7 were threes. That's ridiculous. Just downright ridiculous.

Five minutes of overtime were played and the teams managed to take 13 threes between them. This isn't basketball, this is now basically a video game. As I said, most of these three point attempts could not be described as teams trying to create the best shot possible. It's just guys chucking because they can't be bothered to create plays.

The games this year have been very boring to me. Just not interesting bc it’s basically a 3 point shootout and there is so much variance in it. Combine the variance with how meaningless the regular season is…just feels like an exhibition game.

I found the WNBA regular season much more interesting. I’m also leaning towards watching more NCAA men’s/women’s basketball and almost cutting out the NBA regular season.

Just wait until we get the first NBA game with only threes attempted. Analytics says it's the best play so why hold back. The NBA is so doomed with all this 3pt spamming, big rule changes are urgently needed.

You're a minny fan so your eyes are a bit clouded. He's taking 13 whopping 3pt attempts a game thus far, that's a huge amount of 3pters hoisted. People are saying it's a boring style in general but it makes sense that ANT gets some flack as a guy who people have compared to Wade and MJ the best slashers ever. Quite frankly if you made a poll and asked who would you rather Ant play like, Steph Curry or young MJ/ D Wade, I'm sure most would pick the latter. Has little to do with his improvement, don't think fans really care they just want to see more drives/dunks and other array of moves rather than star players shooting a dozen 3s a game.

Especially high flyers like Ant. That said it's not his fault, he's just adapting to the current style of the nba, 30 ppg is 30ppg afterall . Folks see Celtics and their formula to winning and are just mimicking that style whether its conducive to their personnel or not.
