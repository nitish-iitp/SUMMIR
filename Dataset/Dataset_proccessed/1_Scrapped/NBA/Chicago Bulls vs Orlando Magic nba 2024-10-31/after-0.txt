A balanced scoring effort and overwhelming defense in the second half helped the host Chicago Bulls overcome 31 points from the Orlando Magic’s Paolo Banchero in a 102-99 win in the NBA on Wednesday.

Chicago held Orlando to just 12 points in the fourth quarter and 37 in the second half, helping the Bulls rally from a 10-point halftime deficit. Chicago limited the Magic to just 13-of-42 shooting (31 percent) from the floor after intermission, including a final stop by forcing a miss on Jalen Suggs’ last-second 3-point attempt that would have tied the game.

The stingy defensive performance helped the Bulls overcome their own offensive woes. They shot 15-of-39 (38.5 percent) from the floor in the second half and 36-of-84 (42.9 percent) for the game.

Chicago’s 13-of-34 edge to Orlando’s 11-of-46 on 3-point attempts also proved significant. Coby White and Josh Giddey, who paced six Bulls scorers in double figures with 21 and 20 points, respectively, shot 4-for-10 and 4-for-4 from beyond the arc.

Giddey knocked down three of his triples in the second half. With 11 rebounds, Giddey was also one of three Bulls to record a double-double.

Banchero began the night fresh off becoming only fourth player in Magic history to score 50 points in a game, reaching that milestone on Monday against the visiting Indiana Pacers.

Suggs scored 17 points and Wendell Carter Jr. added 14, but no other Magic scorers reached double figures.

Orlando’s Franz Wagner, who was averaging 20.5 points per game, scored just seven points in less than 23 minutes. He came out of the game early in the fourth quarter and went back to the locker room for a stretch before he returned to the sideline.

Coach Jamahl Mosley said after the game that Wagner was “a little under the weather” after battling an illness earlier in the week, according to the Orlando Sentinel. –Field Level Media
