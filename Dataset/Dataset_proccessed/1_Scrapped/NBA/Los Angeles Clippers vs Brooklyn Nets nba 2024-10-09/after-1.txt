James Harden shrugged off some on-court rust in Clippers’ win over the Nets (netsdaily.com)

By Leobert Julian A. de la Peña

The Los Angeles Clippers clinched their first win of the NBA preseason after containing the Brooklyn Nets, 115-106, on October 9, 2024.

After suffering a heartbreaking one-point loss to the Golden State Warriors during the opener, the Clippers vented their ire on the Nets and banked on a balanced offensive attack from 14 players.

Spearheading the Clippers’ charge is superstar James Harden, who, despite only clocking in 16 minutes of playing time scored in double figures with 14 points.

Harden also recorded four rebounds and two assists as he led Los Angeles with a 6/9 shooting from the field, including 2/4 from the three-point line.

The versatile guard barely played in the second half and inflicted his damage in the first half when the Clippers capped off the first quarter with a 35-18 advantage.

Unfortunately, the Clippers failed to sustain their hot start and got drowned by Brooklyn’s second-quarter assault as they outscored the Western Conference contenders by 19 points.

Los Angeles then deployed the much-needed adjustments in the third, confusing the Nets with several mixed starting five lineups from small ball to the conventional personnel on the floor.

That move paid off as the Clippers pulled away again in the fourth, thanks to some role players who stole the limelight.

Kai Jones, an athletic forward who formerly played for the Charlotte Hornets, backstopped Harden and capped off the win with 13 markers, five boards, and a block.

Jones’ contagious energy in the fourth steered them to a consistent finish, paving the way for guys like Jordan Miller and Alondes Williams to erupt in the most perfect time.

The young LA duo impressed in front of the whole Clippers coaching staff as they delivered 13 and 10 points, respectively.

On the other hand, Brooklyn received a convincing outing for his new squad as the energetic guard handed the Nets a 14-point performance alongside six boards and four dimes.
