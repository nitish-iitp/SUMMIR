Brooklyn Nets center Nic Claxton did not play in Tuesday's 115-106 preseason loss to the Los Angeles Clippers due to hamstring soreness he experienced last week during training camp. While head coach Jordi Fernandez said last week that Claxton was not going to play for precautionary reasons, he shed more light on where Claxton stands with his injury.

Per Brian Lewis of the New York Post on Tuesday, Fernandez said that Claxton should be back in the lineup for their opening night game on Oct. 23 at the Atlanta Hawks "at the latest." While the Nets have released timelines on big men Trendon Watford and Day'Ron Sharpe, who are dealing with hamstring injuries of their own, the team has yet to give a definite timeline on when Claxton should be able to return.

"We're not concerned. It was a minor issue with this hamstring....We’re aiming for the beginning of the season; but that doesn't mean that he's not going to play preseason games," Fernandez said, according to Lewis. At the moment, it sounds like Claxton has somewhat of a loose timeline of coming back at some point during the preseason, but could also miss the entire preseason to come back for the beginning of the regular season.

When Fernandez addressed Claxton's injury initially during training camp, he said "We’ve had Nic (Claxton) with hamstring soreness, but we're not concerned about it. We're just more aiming (for) the first game of the season and doing what we believe is best just for him to be ready there." It seems like Claxton and the team could be aiming for him to be ready for the start of the regular season, even if it means that he doesn't play during the preseason.
