Buddy Hield put forth a nearly perfect shooting display on Wednesday, scoring a game-high 22 points on 8-for-9 shooting and 6-for-7 from behind the arc in the Warriors 122-112 victory over the Kings in Sacramento on Wednesday. Collectively, the Warriors sank 28 3-pointers, which would surpass their regular season franchise record for most made threes in a game.

SPLASH BUDDIES' PERFECT QUARTER
Stephen Curry and Buddy Hield combined for 16 points in the first quarter, shooting a perfect 6-for-6 from the field and 4-for-4 from behind the arc. Both players contributed equally to their unblemished frame, accounting for eight points and two threes each. Curry scored the first eight points and then Hield came into the fray, hitting his first triple off a down screen from Trayce Jackson-Davis. Hield then hit an isolation rainbow jumper from the top of the key and, on the ensuing possession, took it right to the rim for a high-arching scoop layup after being run off the 3-point line.

Hield continued to be an efficient flamethrower in the second quarter, ending the half with the same output he and Curry combined for in the first frame — 16 points on 6-for-6 shooting, 4-for-4 from three.

NEW STAR IN NORCAL 
Six-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan made his Sacramento Kings preseason debut on Wednesday, scoring 15 points on 6-for-6 shooting in 15 minutes. DeRozan was the Clutch Player of the Year runner-up to Curry last season and was also a member of his 2009 Draft class. He makes his bread-and-butter offensively in the mid-range and gives Sacramento additional starpower to compliment De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis.
