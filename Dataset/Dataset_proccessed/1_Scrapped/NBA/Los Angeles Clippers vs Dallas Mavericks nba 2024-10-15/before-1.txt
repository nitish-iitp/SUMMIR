The two-time MVP had another superb start, finishing with seven points and two assists in the first quarter. Milwaukee, though, struggled to keep up with the visitors’ efficiency and pace. The Bulls opened the game without key players such as Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic and Coby White but still took a 34-24 lead after the first period.

Antetokounmpo's efficient night continued in the second quarter. Chicago's undersized frontcourt had no answer to the "Greek Freak." The Bulls were forced to foul him to prevent him from scoring at will. He went 10-for-12 from the charity stripe in the first half.

Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers leaned on Antetokounmpo on both ends of the floor even more in the third quarter. After trailing 59-68 at halftime, the Bucks surged to a 91-83 lead after the third frame. Antetokounmpo opened the period with four straight points to set the tone for the Bucks.

Chicago Bulls had limited options against Giannis Antetokounmpo

Chicago Bulls coach Billy Donovan rested Nikola Vucevic while Patrick Williams and Jalen Smith were held out due to injuries. Without them, Donovan had to rely on 6-foot-9 center Adam Sanogo to slow down Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Sanogo showed grit, energy and hustle but the two-time MVP proved too tough to contain. Dalen Terry, E.J. Liddell and Kenneth Lofton Jr. are all under 6-foot-8. They could only do so much against Antetokounmpo's mobility, size and skills.

Chicago's defensive stance turned into a free-throw party for Antetokounmpo. The play might have worked on most days but it didn't happen on Monday. Milwaukee's franchise cornerstone hit 12-of-16 free throws to punish the Bulls.
