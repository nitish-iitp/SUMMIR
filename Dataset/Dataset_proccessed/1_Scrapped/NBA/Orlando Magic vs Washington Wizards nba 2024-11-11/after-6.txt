Bilal Coulibaly OVER 3.5 1Q Points (-120) – 1.5-units

I’ve been backing Coulibaly’s props nearly every game, but I’m taking a slightly different angle on this one. The top-10 pick is off to a terrific start to this second season in the NBA, averaging 17 points, and going over his point prop in five of his eight games. But Coulibaly has been getting out to very strong starts early in games, especially recently.

There’s an even larger edge to backing Coulibaly in the first quarter of games, where he’s averaging 5.6 points in 10 minutes per game. The Wizards are clearly looking to feature more of their younger talent, meaning more playing time early in games. As a result, Coulibaly has scored four or more points in six of eight games this season, including five in a row. He’s also seen an uptick in minutes to begin games, playing the entire first quarter in consecutive games — resulting in six and nine points.

The nine point outing was on Sunday against the Magic, so while Washington is on a back-to-back, Houston also played yesterday. With this recent change in the rotation to playing Coulibaly the entire first quarter, I’m going to play this angle on Monday against Houston. If he winds up having a poor quarter, I may look to get involved in live betting Coulibaly’s point prop in-game.
