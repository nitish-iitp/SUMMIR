NBA Cup 2024: Latest Standings, Bracket Predictions After November 12 Group Play

East Group A
1 OF 6

Julio Aguilar/Getty Images

1. Orlando (1-0; +25)

2. New York (1-0; +12)

3. Philadelphia (0-1; -12)

4. Charlotte (0-1; -25)

5. Brooklyn (0-0)

Franz Wagner carried the Orlando Magic to the top of East Group A with 32 points against the Charlotte Hornets.

Orlando is ahead by 13 points in the point differential tiebreaker over the New York Knicks. That's a great start for the Paolo Banchero-less team.

New York handled Philadelphia in Joel Embiid's first appearance of the 2024 season. The 76ers could still be a player in East Group A, but they need to win the remainder of their games.

The Sixers and Magic square off on Friday in Orlando in what will be an elimination game for the Sixers in regards to the group win. The Knicks are expected to win easily over Brooklyn on Friday.

Prediction: 1. New York, 2. Orlando, 3. Philadelphia, 4. Charlotte, 5. Brooklyn

East Group B
2 OF 6

1. Milwaukee (1-0; +14)

2. Detroit (1-0; +2)

3. Miami (0-1; -2)

4. Toronto (0-1; -14)

5. Indiana (0-0)

The Milwaukee Bucks won, as expected, over the Toronto Raptors, but they have to wait until next Friday to play another NBA Cup game.

The November 22 clash with the Indiana Pacers could go a long way in determining which team wins East Group B.

Indiana opens its NBA Cup slate against the Miami Heat on Friday. The Heat lost to the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday despite a 40-point performance from Tyler Herro.

Detroit needs to beat Toronto on Friday that way it has a chance to contend with the Bucks and Pacers for the top spot.

Prediction: 1. Indiana, 2. Milwaukee, 3. Detroit, 4. Miami, 5. Toronto

East Group C
3 OF 6

China Wong/Getty Images

1. Atlanta (1-0; +1)

2. Boston (0-1; -1)

3. Cleveland (0-0)

4. Chicago (0-0)

5. Washington (0-0)

The Atlanta Hawks delivered Tuesday's biggest shock, as they beat the Boston Celtics on the road without Trae Young.

Dyson Daniels produced 28 points and Jalen Johnson recorded a triple-double in the win over the reigning NBA champion.

Tuesday's lone result in East Group C shifts the dynamic a bit because now Boston has to be in must-win mode, starting with its Tuesday showdown against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Cleveland hosts the Chicago Bulls on Friday, while Atlanta will try to move to 2-0 against the Washington Wizards.

Prediction: 1. Cleveland, 2. Boston, 3. Atlanta, 4. Chicago. 5. Washington

West Group A
4 OF 6

Alika Jenner/Getty Images

1. Portland (1-0; +14)

2. Minnesota (0-1; -14)

3. Los Angeles Clippers (0-0)

4. Sacramento (0-0)

5. Houston (0-0)

The Portland Trailblazers stunned the Minnesota Timberwolves to grab the early advantage in West Group A.

A lot of basketball is left to be played in what might be the toughest of the six groups. The Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento Kings and Houston Rockets will have a say in the first-place race.

Minnesota's loss looks even more hurtful to its NBA Cup prospects because Tuesday's game was viewed as a win with three tougher games ahead. Now the Wolves have to win three in a row just to have a shot at advancing.

The Wolves visit the Kings on Friday, while the Rockets play host to the Clippers.

Prediction: 1. Sacramento, 2. LA Clippers, 3. Houston, 4. Minnesota, 5. Portland

West Group B
5 OF 6

Alex Goodlett/Getty Images

1. Phoenix (1-0; +8)

2. Utah (0-1; -8)

3. Oklahoma City (0-0)

4. Los Angeles (0-0)

5. San Antonio (0-0)

The Phoenix Suns flexed their status as group favorite on Tuesday, unlike Boston, by beating the Utah Jazz by eight points.

The Chet Holmgren injury makes the Oklahoma City Thunder less of a contender for first place against the Suns. The Los Angeles Lakers are 1-4 on the road this season, so that may hamper their chances to return to the NBA Cup final.

Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs host the Lakers on Friday, while Phoenix visits OKC.

A Suns win over the Thunder would make them an even bigger favorite to get out of West Group B, and it could force the four other teams in the group to fight for the top second-place spot.

Prediction: 1. Phoenix, 2. LA Lakers, 3. Oklahoma City, 4. San Antonio, 5. Utah

West Group C
6 OF 6

Ezra Shaw/Getty Images

1. Golden State (1-0; +3)

2. Dallas (0-1; -3)

3. Denver (0-0)

4. New Orleans (0-0)

5. Memphis (0-0)

Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors won the best game of Tuesday night.

Curry scored 37 points and drained five threes to beat the Dallas Mavericks in Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center. Thompson went 6-for-12 from deep and had 22 points.

Golden State should move to 2-0 in NBA Cup play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.

The Warriors' showdown with the Denver Nuggets on December 3 may end up deciding first place in West Group C.

Denver opens its NBA Cup action against the banged-up New Orleans Pelicans on Friday. That could be a spot for Denver to run up its point differential to counter whatever the Warriors do against Memphis.

Prediction: 1. Denver, 2. Golden State, 3. Dallas, 4. New Orleans, 5. Memphis
