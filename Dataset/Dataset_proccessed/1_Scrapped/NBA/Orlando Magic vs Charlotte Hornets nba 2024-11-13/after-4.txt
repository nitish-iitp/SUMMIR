(ORLANDO, FL) – The Orlando Magic (7-6) defense holds the Indiana Pacers (5-6) to a season worst 38.1% from the field in their 94-90 win.

1. First Quarter

Once again, the Indiana Pacers were without Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith, but they did get Obi Toppin back after missing Sunday’s game against the Knicks. Indiana put together one its most complete quarters of the season. Indiana trailed through the first three minutes and then Pascal Siakam gave the Pacers a 9-8 advantage with 8:48 remaining in the period. The two teams would tie three times after that with the last occurrence being 18-18. With 4:31 left, the game would be tied 18-18. Indiana held Orlando scoreless coming out of the timeout for the rest of the period. Myles Turner knocked down his second three of the quarter to start the 9-0 scoring run. During that stretch, Indiana forced four turnovers. One of those turnovers led to Johnny Furphy’s first career points with a dunk. It was the final field goal of the quarter to put Indiana ahead 27-18. Turner led Indiana in scoring with 8 points, but trailed Franz Wagner by three points for the overall scoring leader. Orlando turned the ball over nine times in the first quarter, and Indiana scored 10 points off those turnovers.

Defensively, Indiana maintained its high level of play in the second quarter, but did not maintain its efficiency offensively. To start the second quarter, Orlando trimmed its deficit down to five points following a Jett Howard three. Indiana would eventually go up by a first half twelve following a three-point play from Furphy to make it 38-26. Orlando countered with a 10-0 run to make it a one-possession game after a Cole Anthony floater with 4:37 left in the half. The Pacers responded with seven points to threaten another double-figure lead, but Orlando would outscore Indiana the final 2:42 by five. At halftime, Indiana’s advantage was 45-41. Pascal Siakam scored seven of Indiana’s 18 points in the period. Franz Wagner led all scorers with 16 first half points followed by a dozen from Siakam. Indiana shot 4/16 from behind the arc, but Orlando also struggled by going 6/21.  

3. Third Quarter

In the first half, both Indiana and Orlando had their struggles offensively. The third quarter would be a solid quarter for both teams as they each scored 27 in the period. With 11:04 remaining in the quarter, a Franz Wagner layup gave the Magic their first lead since the early stages of the opening quarter. That was one of four occasions where Orlando was leading Indiana, but the Magic’s largest lead was just one point. Rick Carlisle’s team largest lead in the third quarter was four points. After thirty-six minutes, Indiana was clinging onto a 72-68 advantage. Wagner led Orlando in the period with 11 points and all scorers after the third with 27 points. Siakam scored 10 points in the third quarter to bring his Pacers high total to 22 points.

4. Fourth Quarter

Despite holding onto a four-point lead, it felt like the Orlando Magic had the momentum going into the final quarter of play. Orlando opened the final twelve minutes of play with a 10-0 run that Indiana simply could not overcome. Jonathan Isaac’s three with 7:47 left in the game put the Magic ahead 81-72. Indiana was able to trim its deficit down to five points, but Orlando delivered another punch. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope converted a layup with 3:42 left in the game to make it a 90-78. Indiana would slowly work itself back into the game, and even had an opportunity to make things interesting. Following a Bennedict Mathurin three-point play, Indiana trailed 90-86 with 1:51 remaining. The Pacers couldn’t get a stop and sent Franz Wagner to the foul line, where he converted both to make it 93-86. Mathurin countered with two free throws and then the Pacers forced a miss. With less than a minute left, Indiana had the ball and down four. The Pacers settled for a Mathurin three that only drew iron. Orlando corralled the rebound and then sent Jalen Suggs to the line. He buried both free throws with 9.8 seconds left to make it 94-90. That ended up being the final score as Tyrese Haliburton’s three only drew air.
