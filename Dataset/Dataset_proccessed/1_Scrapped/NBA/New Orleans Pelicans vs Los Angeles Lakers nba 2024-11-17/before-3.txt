History
The Atlanta Hawks secured a 129-117 victory against the Washington Wizards, advancing to 2-0 in the NBA Cup, with Dyson Daniels leading with 25 points and six steals. Despite a strong performance from the Wizards' Kyle Kuzma, Jordan Poole, and rookie Alex Sarr, Washington suffered its seventh consecutive loss, bringing their record to 2-9. Trae Young returned from injury to contribute 18 points and nine assists, marking his 4,000th career assist with a notable play. The Hawks' defense was pivotal, especially in the second quarter where they outscored the Wizards 30-11. They continue to showcase strong defensive metrics, led by Daniels, who is averaging 3.6 steals per game, the highest in the league. The Wizards, despite their struggles, have shown prowess in three-point shooting and free throws, but their overall performance remains lackluster.

De’Andre Hunter made a significant impact in his return, scoring 22 points in just 21 minutes after missing 10 games due to injury and personal reasons.
Trae Young mentioned that he is dealing with a lingering injury from the start of the season, stating, 'It’s something I’m going to have to play through.'
The Hawks' defensive turnaround in the second quarter was notable, as they held the Wizards to just six points over an 11-minute stretch.
Dyson Daniels’ scoring surge has been complemented by his defensive skills, as he averages 53.7% shooting over his last four games, helping the Hawks implement their offensive strategy of 'let that (ball) fly.'
The matchup between the top two draft picks from France, Dyson Daniels and Zaccharie Risacher, highlighted their rivalry, with Risacher scoring 11 points while Sarr achieved a career-high 20 points.
