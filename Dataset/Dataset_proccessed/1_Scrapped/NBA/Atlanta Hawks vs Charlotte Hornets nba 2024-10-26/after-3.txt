Recap/Analysis: Hornets drop home opener to Heat

LaMelo Ball led the way with 27 points, but the Charlotte Hornets couldn’t get stops down the stretch and lost to the Miami Heat, 114-106.

THE SUMMARY

Both teams started looking like that they had led in their shoes, and that held true for a lot of the game. It took a while for either team to simply make a shot. The Hornets got a little eight point outburst from Seth Curry to briefly take a lead, but the offense went frigid after that and allowed the Heat to get back into the game. The Heat’s stars took turns finding their rhythm in the second quarter and helped the visitors out to an eight point lead at the break.

The third quarter closely mirrored what happened on Friday night against the Hawks. The Hornets made a couple of little runs and threatened the Heat, but they were never able to string together enough scores or stops to overtake them. They let go of the rope a little bit and trailed by double figures heading into the fourth.

Grant Williams and Miles Bridges hit back to back threes to open the fourth quarter and force a quick Erik Spoelstra timeout. That seemed to do the trick. The Hornets didn’t score another point until they called their own timeout a few minutes later. It looked like the Heat were going to run away and hide, but a couple of Cody Martin threes helped keep them in the Hornets’ sight. Miles Bridges did a good job on a couple of Jimmy Butler drives, but he was able to shake free for a couple of buckets. Tre Mann hit a stepback three and a pull-up mid range jumper to answer the Butler buckets, but Tyler Herro hit back with his own three. Nick Richards let a pass slip through his hands that would’ve led to an easy dunk, and the Heat recovered the loose ball and earned free throws. Terry Rozier of all people hit the dagger three with just over 30 seconds left to play.

THE GOOD

LaMelo Ball couldn’t find the stroke from deep for much of the game, but he still found ways to score. He drew a bunch of fouls with low rip throughs on drives to the traffic. He used his body to nudge defenders away to create space for floaters and lays. It’s the kind of progress he’s needed to make to truly unlock his scoring ability.

Tre Mann ended up having a good game off the bench. He got off to a little bit of a slow start, but he hit some big shots down the stretch and accounted for over half the team’s bench scoring.

Seth Curry seemed more like a veteran presence than a key rotation piece when the Hornets brought him back in the summer, but he’s proving to be an important player. He provided a spark for the Hornets in the first quarter with his shooting. He’s been a sneaky good offensive rebounder and glue player as well.

Tidjane Salaün made his NBA debut. He got a rebound a steal.

THE BAD

The Hornets committed five 5-second out of bounds turnovers. That’s like an entire season’s worth. It looked like guys weren’t quite sure where to be, and there were passes to be made that inbounders just weren’t seeing or trusting. Time to hit the drawing board for some sideline out of bounds plays.

The Hornets have dug themselves into double digit holes in all three games so far. They were able to come back and win over the Rockets and put up tough fights in the last two, but they need to figure out how to keep themselves out of those holes. If they can play with the intensity that they do during their comebacks out of the gate, they’ll be really tough to beat.

WHAT’S NEXT

The Hornets have three days off before hosting the Raptors on Wednesday.

Not a big fan of the offense right now. Too much dribbling and iso ball. Everybody taking turns going iso and all the dribbling leading to turnovers. Cody the last 5 minutes in the game twice went 1 on 1 and missed shots. I’m not a big fan of isolation ball. I prefer passing, screening and cutting. Isolation just leads to a lot of turnovers imo.
I’ve never seen a pro team have 4 or 5 turnovers by not being able to inbound the ball. Definitely will need to get that corrected.

Still love the buy in and hard play. Now just need to clean up some a few things.

SO MANY turnovers on inbounds plays … horrible. I assume that’s something we’ll get straightened out, but it’s pretty inexcusable. I know we used to ride Cliff about his weak inbounds plays, but I don’t remember if there were any games quite as bad as that one last night.

So far we don’t have any organized play on either side of the ball. The team looks like they’re just doing whatever on offense. Not getting any easy baskets at all. Doesn’t really reflect well on Lee for them to be so disorganized.

Agreed. No team should open up their season on a back to back against a team that had rested for 2 days and the 2 games we played were road games. Agree they could have at least let us open tonight (Sunday) or Monday. I guess the good thing is that at least this gives us plenty of time to work on how to inbound the ball. That was a joke.

I’m watching the game this morning, and just wanted to pipe in with a word about Seth Curry. He’s playing at a higher level as a two-way guard than I expected, having added more muscle over the years. He is effective using position, body, anticipation and quick hands to contain larger players. Great pickup. If he stays healthy then he’s a good rotation guard for us, and a capable starter in the shorter term.

Yeah the two best pick ups this year has been Curry and Diabate. I thing Green will be also once he can stay on the floor. Tre was a great pick up last year in the trade. Was hoping Vasa would be to but he has somehow lost his confidence since the Olympics.

Went to the game. Like Bob said below, very disorganized. I’m sure all the injuries and different lineups are some of the problem. Saluan is extremely raw and was having difficulty with the pace of play. We are better on D, but have a way to go. This team is extremely soft. Miami is physical and that’s why they beat us. Melo was trying to break down their defense, he’s just not physical enough. The only guy we have that can drive and draw a defense in is Miles.

The Good: The eye test says Lamelo seems to have improved his finishing in the paint, but I haven’t looked at the numbers. Mann seems a new Mann this year compared to last.

The Bad: Coaching. Team often seems disorganized. Too much one-on-one. Terrible at basic in-bounds plays.

The Maybe: If Diabate had a corner 3 and a more reliable floater or jump hook, he’d be a possibly starting-level player in a few years.

Edit: I wrote this before reading the thread. Looks like we all agree on the disorganized O.

Spacing and ball movement has been very poor so far which has led to a lot of contested shots and turnovers. Defense and team rebounding has been solid and should get even better with the return of MW. As the season progresses, I’d like to see less of Vasa and have KJ Simpson get some burn.

Lots of valid criticism about the offense last night. 2 things to consider tho:

1) No Mark or Milly is huge.

2) We’re chucking

Outside of that, I miss JB’s offense more and more. Coach Lee still has time and hasn’t had his full rotation yet.

Missing Josh Green is big too. I think he’ll be a better starter than Cody. Three starters down is a lot, but we should play better than that with the available personnel.

Turnovers were huge, but a lot of it also comes down to missed shots. We should be a better shooting team, on average, than what we saw last night. Second night of a back to back, with travel involved, is something of a scheduled loss, though playing at Atlanta and then home was one of the easier examples of a back to back with travel involved.

Really? The shooting percentages are way better for Josh, on average, and his ability to stretch the floor will open it up for everyone else on the court, giving more room for Melo and Miles to drive, and for Nick to find open space in the paint.

On their careers:
Player FG% 3PT% FT%
Green 50.3% 37.4% 68.9%
Martin 44.0% 31.7% 65.3%

Agreed. It’s also worth noting that despite the record, last night’s point total was our season average last year. In three games, it is our season low.

Currently we are averaging 112 pts/g while allowing 114.7. That 3-game level of combined offense and defense production occurred only once last year. The year before it only happened twice. Neither instance did it occur this early in the season.

It’s a small sample, but if we are going to complain (rightfully – there is plenty to improve on) about the results, lets make sure we are putting it in proper context. Indicators so far are that this team is vastly improved from where it was the past two seasons – despite stupid turnovers and 3 missing starters.

To add to the many comments on our offense, I think what we are really missing is players that know how to set screens.
The majority of our screens are ineffectives and didn’t led to simple pick and roll. Moreover, when we try to set hard screens ,we got called so many time with moving screens’ calls. On the other end, Bam litteraly killed us with those border illegals screen which enable them to shoot midrange or to find open threes on help.

It almost sounds like you are saying we need a player who’s stature would preclude him from being called for fouls from innocently standing at the top of the key where bumps from opposing players would be seen as ill-fated mishaps rather than devilish schemes to get ball-handlers to the hoop unopposed…

Charlotte should be able to run better offense, especially with Melo running the point. Underperforming in offensive execution. We unfortunately have been beaten up for 3 straight games, and the turnovers have to get better. We’re bottom 10 in FG%, Assists, and turnovers.

Charlotte are still 15th in ppg and +/-. This is coming from top 5 3P made and leading the league in offensive rebounding.

Still very early to put a lot of stock in any stats, but an identity is starting to emerge for Coach Lee’s Hornets. If we can add better looks to the mix (with maybe Mark and Brandon) and continue to crash the glass, this could be a top 10 offense at the end of the season.

I think this game’s offense was more on tired legs than anything else. 3 games in 4 nights versus probable play off teams with 2 on the road is going to be rough. Oh and we were missing multiple starters during this stretch too. I can’t imagine why we might look bad on offense or defense.

Nice to see the national sports media calling out the officiating to start the season. The foul rate is 22.5%, up from 17.1% at the close of last season. That results in about 25% more fouls being called per game. Charlotte’s games against Miami and Atlanta have been highlighted as two of the most unwatchable so far.

I guess LaMelo does still have some rust to shake off. He is turning the ball over a lot and committing too many fouls. Missing Miller, Mark and Green is also disheartening. I said this team would make the play in if it could stay healthy, so far that is not happening.

I am not a fan of Bridges but I did expect him to step up more than this with Miller out. He should be carrying more of the scoring load. Its still early in the year so hopefully they will turn it around but not the best start.

Yep agreed on all points.

Bridges had the one good game scoring the ball, but struggled in the other two. Hopefully he’s just shaking off some rust, too. I’d expect him to be putting up over 20/game with Miller out, and he’d be there if he were shooting a little better, especially from 3pt range.

I think the consensus is that, while missing key players, we could/should be performing better with who we have available. I’m not even concerned a tiny bit at this point though. New coach, Melo back in the rotation, etc…gotta give them at least a few games to adjust. But that’s the key, let’s see if they can fix the issues in practice and tighten things up. Sometimes shots just don’t fall, but careless turnovers, silly fouls, inbounding the damn ball…these are things they can clean up with the pros they have available.

The injuries are what concern me the most right now. We all know we have had a horrible time with injuries the past two years. Now we are starting a new season and players are missing time already. Mark Williams had all off season and most of last regular season to get healthy and failed.

I just don’t see it as a pattern that is predictive. Sure, I wish we had better injury luck…but that’s what it is, luck. Every team has injured players sometimes. Do you think our guys are more injury prone? What does that even mean? If you fall and land on your butt and it gets bruised, how do you prevent that? We also want our team to hustle, be physical (rebound, box out, set solid screens, etc.), and watch highlight plays…these things get guys injured. IIRC, Mark was healed and then hurt his foot. How did he fail? Was he supposed to stay bubble-wrapped?

It stinks, I get it. But I don’t know if anyone could be blamed or prevent guys from getting injured. If we have players that aren’t playing and are healthy enough to play, that’s one thing. But if it’s just the ankle-gods or whatever getting their weekly revenge, it’s just how it works, man. I think they should play through some pain if it doesn’t risk re-injury, but other than that it’s just part of the game.

I do not know what and all goes on behind the scenes but we definitely seem to have more injuries than most teams. I guess I just grew up on 80s and 90s basketball when players did not miss many games. I think guys toughed it out more back then but maybe not doing that is how Lebron is still playing well at his age.

I grew up on 80s and 90s basketball too. It does seem like there are more injuries now. I wonder if it’s also that every player is a millionaire, sometimes 1/4+billionaire, so everything is micro-analyzed based on their career and trying to avoid long-term issues. But what’s it matter if they don’t play? Missing Melo (and lately Mark) have been the biggest drags to the last few seasons. I imagine if Melo played 70ish+ games each season, we’d feel differently about our team as a whole. If he’s going to be the face of the franchise, he needs to play.

I was skeptical that the medical personnel and facilities were deficient or if this was just a convenient scapegoat

It’s almost certainly a scapegoat. Cold plunges and testicle tanning aren’t making us healthier or more athletic. Basic knowledge and equipment to be a professional athlete has been available for at least half a century. The former trainer, Joe Sharpe, has had a long career in the NBA. He probably knows a thing or two.

But the PR definitely matters. This is true not just to the fans, but to the league. We’re all human. We all want the premium package if we can have it.

I’m not a doctor, but I have my doubts about the utility of cold plunges, which, IINM, were heavily used by the prior training staff, and I know they weren’t alone. I read some of the scientific literature on them, and they are known to reduce soreness, thought to reduce inflammation, and seem to allow athletes to go harder on the second workout of a day or on back-to-backs.

My problem with them is that by reducing blood flow and numbing nerve endings, yes, you reduce inflammation and soreness, but, you know what? Inflammation is your body’s natural response to injury and delivers an cornucopia of healing substances to the damaged areas. And soreness is a warning signal from your body that things are damaged and you should maybe go a little easier on your body.

So, seems like a bad idea to me, at least in a lot of cases. While the athlete’s body may seem to be recovering faster with the cold plunges, it’s actually masking symptoms and preventing the body from recovering as fast as possible. Then, feeling better, the athlete can go harder in the next training session, and I could see how that would lead to more injuries, if applied as a blanket policy that athletes who are feeling nicked up should routinely take them.

I recently read a good meta-analysis of heat treatment on sports injuries, which does promote more rapid healing from injury, which makes sense to me: more blood flow, more rapid delivery of all the healing goodies in the blood, and promotes relaxation of the muscles.

Maybe excessive use of cold plunges was one aspect of our being more injury prone over the last decade? Just a hypothesis, but one with some basis in my knowledge of human physiology.

I think this is the review article I read before: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7492448/

Good luck with your running … I’ve been trying to build up to some limited running, which is not easy when you’re mid-upper fifties and long out of practice. I’m peaking out recently at ~5 mile jog/walks with a few spurts of faster running/mild sprinting thrown in.

Just got some new Topo running shoes I ordered online that seem to actually fit my very wide feet pretty well, so that will help. Finding shoes that fit is a chronic problem for me, and foot pain has kept me from running much at all in recent months … that and not having a lot of extra time for recreational exercise since I’m dealing with disaster recover every day, lol.

It’s been a few years, but I really like the folks at Jus’ Running when it comes to foot and shoe consultation. They also have different group run events for folks if you need an outlet from all of the recovery efforts.

You’re accurately describing the mechanism of cold plunges and why they don’t promote recovery. I mentioned cold plunges as a joke about modern health trends that don’t really do what people think they do.

My understanding of the benefits of cold therapy for professional athletes is not so much that cold helps recovery, but rather that reducing soreness helps athletes continue to perform.

I’m confused how you’re linking cold therapy to the Hornets elevated injury rate(or at least games missed). My understanding is that ice and ice baths have been used widely in professional sports. I’m not aware of any differences in cold therapy specific to the Hornets staff.

I think it’s more plausible that Hornets players chose not to play when they could have. Not sure why that is, but there’s a gray area when we’re talking about playing through injuries.

I have no real reason to think the Hornets staff/team advocated/used cold plunges more than any other team. I just remember, back in another year when injuries wrecked our season, seeing an interview with Jeremy Lamb, where he was talking about his recovery process, including taking his cold plunges every day, and I didn’t think that sounded like a good idea.

I’ve since researched it more, and I think it’s definitely not a good idea. Cold treatment may make sense in limited situations where you are trying to control swelling. It shouldn’t be part of routine treatment or maintenance, IMO. Heat treatment is the way to go far more often, again IMO.

And if that means an athlete can’t perform quite as hard in the short term, it should have better results in the long term.

Lamb has his best stretch of games played year to year while he was in Charlotte. I think Lamb and Joe Sharpe may overlap in Charlotte by a single year, and that was a good one for Lamb.

Cold therapy is very much a league wide thing. I don’t think it would explain anything unique to the Hornets.

Despite what we now know about cold therapy and recovery, I think its used so often by professional athletes because it helps them feel comfortable performing in the short term. Unfortunately, being available to play doesn’t always overlap with being healthy.

My guess that it is more than PR and is that they are doing a full inventory of the situation. They seem invested in team success at the game-level (not just the long-term resale level of the club), and nobody wants spend billions for a broken toy – not even billionaires.

The medical staff and facilities are the natural first choice to check-on because they are the easiest for them to manage and control – fewer variables, more definitive metrics for “best practice”, further away from the product (being winning games IMO).

Once that is controlled for as best as possible, the next logical step is player evaluation – which has so many more variables, metrics, and is the closest asset to the product.

The most productive asset on the roster has chronic ankle injuries that inhibit production. They could be the result of luck, genetics/history, player preparation, or medical competence. They can’t do anything about about the first two, they can do a bit more about the prior two.

I agree that overhauling training staff and facilities isn’t just PR. I have no criticism for the new ownerships moves with the staff or facilities so far. I do think it’s very easy to under appreciate the PR underlying these moves. The scope of PR isn’t limited to fans. All people need a sale pitch they can buy into, including staff and players.

Video evidence and rumors/suggestions from James Plowright, Nata Edwards, and Terrence Oglesby have all pointed to Melo not playing last season when he could have. Video evidence should be the smoking gun. We also know that Melo refused to wear ankle braces last year.

New ownership is going to want Melo to play, but evidence tells us that what’s happening in the brain is just as important (if not more so) as what’s happening in bones, muscles, and ligaments. Melo is wearing his braces, so I think so far the PR campaign is doing the job.

if a team is not investing in top notch medical personnel and facilities, then i def think the org can bear some blame for guys getting hurt and/or having potentially longer than usual return timelines.
but the team is doing that now (finally), so thats not an excuse anymore.
the health story of this season, tho off to an inauspicious start, has not been written yet. im still hopeful that our investment will yield results.

I was skeptical that the medical personnel and facilities were deficient or if this was just a convenient scapegoat. It’s a hard thing to prove without inside info telling us that our docs are incompetent or facilities are falling apart. And none of it may matter for preventing injuries. I think it’s potentially a classic causation vs correlation argument. Even if we’re much more healthy this year (or just as injured as last season), it’s doesn’t necessarily mean it was caused by any changes the org has made…but it certainly looks better from a PR standpoint.

All that said, I don’t care how it happens…I just want us to be healthy and play up to our potential.

I am developing a theory that Charlotte pro athletes are not more injury-prone, but they are more likely to sit out due to injury.

The obvious reason is that the teams have sucked over the last 8 years and that it is easier to quit on a loosing team (which is getting broken up anyway) than on a winning team.

My working hypothesis on a secondary reason is that Charlotte fans are not rabid enough to make them feel that “extra” pressure to get back.

IMO, he has been healthy the last 8 months, and just recently got hurt.

I am of the opinion that last year was a full-on, “Trust the Process,” ownership-approved tank-job , and everyone was on board except maybe Clifford (as he seemed “confused” as to why he was not playing).

I even think Cody’s injury was half-way fake (maybe exaggerated is a better word).

Its also important to note that Miles and Melo have played only 15 games together since the 21/22 season and never for longer than 7 games at a stretch (hopefully that changes this season). Since LaMelo entered the league, they’ve played more games WITHOUT sharing the court with each other (139) than they have been played WITH each other (133).

Yes, these two complimented each other’s game for two seasons, but their recent development has been pretty exclusive of one another. Chemistry is going to take some time, and it is not guaranteed that it will return to it’s previous state two years ago

Some of it is the magnification of the early season. It stands out that Miles is “only” averaging 17.7pts/gm and shooting <30% from 3 because it’s the 1st 3 games of the season. If he put up the same statistics games 50-53 it would just be a blip, wouldn’t even be noticed. His game will normalize once the players get used to each other and to Lee’s rotations and/or Lee moves to a smaller rotation later in the season … team health permitting

Also – as part of Lee’s rotations Miles is playing almost 5 minutes per game less than he did last year and attempting 3.5 fewer shots. The rest of his numbers, except assists, are in line with what he’s done in the past.

It is still early and they are still working out the kinks. If Miller were to miss a long stretch of games though I would hope for more out of Miles.

I don’t want Miles taking as many shots as he did last year, unless his FG% improves. His PPG numbers were inflated last season with Melo out. I’d prefer his ’21-21′ stats with a little boost in his 3pt%. Combine that with Melo and BMill, and we should have a solid 3 man scoring threat.

Scottie Barnes is out Wednesday. That eye must be really bad.

Conjunctivitis is a serious affliction. It’s a good reminder to us all to wash our hands thoroughly.
