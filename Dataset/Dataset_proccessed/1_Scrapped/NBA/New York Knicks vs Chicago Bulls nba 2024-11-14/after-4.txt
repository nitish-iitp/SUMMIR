NBA: Coby White, Bulls hold off hard-charging Knicks

Coby White made three free throws with 3.2 seconds left to cap his 22-point effort, and the Chicago Bulls rallied after squandering a 22-point lead to beat the host New York Knicks, 124-123, in the NBA on Wednesday.

After falling behind 90-68 late in the third quarter, New York — playing the second leg of a back-to-back — ended the period on a 17-0 run to set up an intense fourth quarter. There were 10 lead changes in the final period, the last coming on White’s free throws on a tough foul call against Josh Hart.

Jalen Brunson, who scored a pair of go-ahead baskets under duress in the final 38 seconds, created space for a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, but his attempt rimmed in and out. Had the Knicks completed the comeback, it would have been the franchise’s biggest second-half rally since a 26-point turnaround in March 2004.

Zach LaVine led Chicago with 31 points and matched Brunson with a game-high eight assists. He also snagged seven rebounds.

Karl-Anthony Towns scored 17 of his 46 points in the fourth quarter and hauled in 10 rebounds. Towns’ scoring performance was a personal best since joining the Knicks in an offseason trade.

Brunson and Towns combined to score 10 of New York’s final 12 points.

White, meanwhile, was clutch for Chicago. His 3-pointer on one of Ayo Dosunmu’s six assists to answer a hard-charging Towns bucket gave the Bulls a four-point cushion in the final two minutes.

Dosunmu was one of five Bulls to score in double-figures, shooting 5-of-8 from the floor en route to 16 points. Nikola Vucevic posted a double-double of 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Patrick Williams added 18 points.

Mikal Bridges scored 20 points for New York. OG Anunoby chipped in 14 points and nine rebounds, and Cameron Payne scored 11 points off the bench. –Field Level Media
