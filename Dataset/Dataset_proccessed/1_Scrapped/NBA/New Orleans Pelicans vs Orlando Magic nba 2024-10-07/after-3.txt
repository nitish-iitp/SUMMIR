Zion Williamson began the preseason in midseason form, leading the New Orleans starting five to very positive results. Second-year guard Jordan Hawkins and his confident shooting helped the second unit expand a lead. In the first of two exhibition games scheduled against Orlando this week, the Pelicans prevailed, with several lesser-known players sealing the victory in the final minutes.

Williamson packed 16 points (on 8/11 shooting), along with eight rebounds, three assists and one steal into his 19 minutes. Meanwhile, Hawkins came off the bench to score 18 points, going 5/8 from the field and drawing multiple fouls on jump shots.

PELICANS PLAYER UPDATES

As promised, none of the New Orleans starters logged more than 20 minutes (Brandon Ingram did not play, due to rest). That meant first half-only action for Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones and Williamson. …

Deep reserve wings Malcolm Hill and Jamal Cain made key offensive plays down the stretch to seal the victory for the hosts. Hill was the 16th New Orleans player to enter the game and scored 11 points in eight minutes. ...

Murray didn’t shoot well in his official New Orleans debut at 2/9 from the field, but showed off his floor game with six assists and a steal. The Pelicans tried various approaches in the first quarter in terms of running the attack, with Murray, Jones and Williamson alternating initiating the offense in the first few minutes.
