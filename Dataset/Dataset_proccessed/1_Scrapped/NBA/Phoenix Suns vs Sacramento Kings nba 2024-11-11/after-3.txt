De’Aaron Fox is still insanely clutch. Shocker.

The one-time All-Star contributed 21 points for the Sacramento Kings in their 127-118 win over Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns Sunday night. Fox also grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out eight assists, falling two shy of his second career triple-double.

Fox and six-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who Sacramento acquired in the offseason, were the only Kings to attempt a field goal in overtime. The duo scored 16 points on 7/8 shooting, good enough to hand Phoenix just its second loss of the season.

With the Kings leading 123-118 with 1:55 remaining in overtime, Fox hit three consecutive pull-up jumpers to secure the win. Trey Lyles scored a season-high eight points in the win, while Malik Monk (four points) was injured and exited the game after just eight minutes of action.

Devin Booker scored 23 points and dished out 12 assists, but shot just 9-22 (41%) from the field in the loss. D-Book is now averaging 23.1 PPG, which is good for 21st most in the NBA. The Suns are now 8-2, but are still tied for the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference.

KAT scores 30 in disappointing Knicks loss to Pacers

Karl-Anthony Towns continued his amazing start to the season with another 30-point game on Sunday night, but it wasn’t enough as the New York Knicks fell to the Indiana Pacers 132-121. Towns, Jalen Brunson (33), and OG Anunoby (25) combined to score 88 of New York’s 121 points.

Although the Knicks big-three had a big night, it wasn’t enough to overcome a career-high 38 points from former Arizona star Bennedict Mathurin. Although KAT has averaged 28.3 points and 13.8 rebounds over the last four games, the Knicks are just 1-3 in that span.

Tyler Herro stays hot with 26 in win over Timberwolves

Although he has been a really good player in the NBA over his first five NBA seasons (including an NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2022), it seems like Tyler Herro is truly breaking out this season.

Herro led the Heat with 26 points (9-15 FG) in Miami’s nail-biting 95-94 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves Sunday night. The Greenfield, WI native has led Miami in scoring in five of its nine games this season, including four in a row. He’s averaging 22.9 PPG, which is 2.1 more than his career-high (20.8 in 2023/24).

Bam Adebayo struggled once again, scoring just nine points on 3-11 shooting with seven rebounds. Adebayo has already failed to score at least 10 points in two (of nine) games this season, something he did just four times all of last season (71 games).

Julius Randle poured in 17 points on 6-16 shooting with six rebounds and six assists for the Timberwolves, while Rob Dillingham once again failed to see the court. Dillingham has played in just four of Minnesota’s 10 games this season.

Other BBNBA Notes:
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points (6-17 FG) in Oklahoma City’s 127-116 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday night. SGA has scored at least 20 points in nine of Oklahoma City’s 10 games this season (7-2). Cason Wallace also scored a season-high 16 points in the loss.
Anthony Davis left the Los Angeles Lakers’ dominant 123-103 win over the Toronto Raptors early after being poked in the eye in the third quarter. In 22 minutes of action, AD scored 22 points (6-8 FG) and grabbed four rebounds. He still leads the NBA in scoring with 32.4 PPG.
The Denver Nuggets are 7-3 thanks to 18 points and six assists from Jamal Murray, and more importantly a MONSTER 37/18/15 triple-double from three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic.
It was another disappointing night for Reed Sheppard, who scored just three points (1-3 FG) in Houston’s 101-99 win over the Detroit Pistons. Sheppard is averaging just 3.4 PPG through 10 games, which ranks 22nd in the NBA among rookies.
