Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best picks on Saturday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Nikola Jokić (DEN, C)	$25,030	61.4	2.5
Value	Jaren Jackson (MEM, C/PF)	$15,320	49.9	3.3
Fade	Russell Westbrook (DEN, PG)	$13,130	23.6	1.8
Cheapie	Jared McCain (PHI, SG/PG)	$6,980	21.7	3.1

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Saturday teams, consider starting with a value player like Jaren Jackson. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Nikola Jokić is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Jared McCain.

On the other hand, according to our model, Russell Westbrook is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building out multiple line-ups.
