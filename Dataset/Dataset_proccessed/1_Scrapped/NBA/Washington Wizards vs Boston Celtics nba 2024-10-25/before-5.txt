NBA: Preseason-Minnesota Timberwolves at New York Knicks (Source: Imagn)

The New York Knicks take on the Boston Celtics on Tuesday in their NBA season opener at the TD Garden. The Knicks' newest acquisition, Karl-Anthony Towns, will start for the home team.

The big man is healthy, so Knicks fans are excited to see him in their uniform for the first time in a competitive game after his surprise trade from Minnesota. The Knicks begin their quest for their first title since 1973 against defending champion Celtics, who will play with their star players Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.

The Knicks finished second (50-32) in the Eastern Conference last season, finishing 14 games behind the Celtics in second place. With a renewed roster and retooled team, the Knicks will look to bridge the gap with the best team in the Eastern Conference.
