The Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz meet Monday in NBA preseason action at the Delta Center. Here’s a Houston Rockets vs Utah Jazz Prediction. This article will include a Houston Rockets vs Utah Jazz Pick.

Houston Rockets Betting Preview

The Houston Rockets won 41 games last season and enter the second year under coach Ime Udoka. Outside of adding AJ Griffin, the Rockets didn’t make any changes to their roster. The Rockets are betting on the growth of Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun and Jabari Smith Jr. to pay off. Fred VanVleet was consistent in his first season outside of Toronto, and Dillon Brooks is what he is at this point. A healthy Steven Adams would be massive for the Rockets, as he missed last year, but is a consistent force in the paint at both ends of the floor. The Rockets are trending in the right direction.

The Rockets are still looking for their first playoff berth since the 2019-20 season. Despite the lack of recent success, the Rockets have improved their win total in each of the last four seasons.

Utah Jazz Betting Preview

The Utah Jazz are coming off a preseason win over New Zealand. The Utah Jazz have split their last 10 preseason games. The Utah Jazz are averaging 116 points on 57.9 percent shooting and allowing 87 points on 36.6 percent shooting. Johnny Juzang is averaging 19 points and 1 rebound, while Lauri Markkanen is averaging 13 points and 3 rebounds. Brice Sensabaugh is the third double-digit scorer and Keyonte George is dishing 5 assists. The Utah Jazz are shooting 40 percent from beyond the arc and 72.7 percent from the free throw line. The Utah Jazz are allowing 23.9 percent shooting from deep and are grabbing 44 rebounds per game.

Houston Rockets vs Utah Jazz Prediction

The Houston Rockets have the talent to dominate the preseason, as the athleticism and the youth is there. I still see value with the Jazz and the free points at home, mainly because they already have a preseason game under their belt. The Jazz have had a chance to knock off the rust and get back in the swing of things in a game format. That's enough of an advantage for me to grab the points with the Jazz.
