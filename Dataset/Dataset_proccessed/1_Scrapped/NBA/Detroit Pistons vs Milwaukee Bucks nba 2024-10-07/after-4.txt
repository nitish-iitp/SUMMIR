The Milwaukee Bucks fell flat in the second half of a lopsided 87-120 preseason loss to the Detroit Pistons.

They have three more exhibition games left on the schedule, including their next one on Thursday before the real action begins on Wednesday, October 23rd, when they tip off the regular season against the Philadelphia 76ers. Since it’s all about the process at this point, there is plenty to like and dislike as Milwaukee tunes up for the games that count.

Like: 5-Out Spacing

The Bucks introduced a sleek, new offensive look on Sunday with a five-out approach. They spaced all five players along the three-point line, with the center usually at the top of the key, orchestrating the action. From there, he could either initiate a two-man game with the ball-handler or set screens away from the ball to kick-start another sequence.

This five-out system should inject a new dynamic into the Bucks' attack, opening up driving lanes and facilitating two-man actions between Milwaukee's stars.

We saw early flashes of that concept bearing fruit, with Damian Lillard launching 10 shots in just 17 minutes, including six from deep, while dishing out four assists. It’s exactly what Doc Rivers wants from his offense—putting the ball in Dame's hands and letting the shooters thrive.

With Taurean Prince and Gary Trent Jr. now on board, the Bucks have added critical floor spacing to complement Giannis Antetokounmpo and Lillard. The results should be more offensive variety and more headaches for opposing defenses.

Dislike: Pat Connaughton’s Spot In The Rotation

Pat Connaughton played 16 minutes in the preseason opener—starting, no less. While Connaughton is a proven veteran, his presence ahead of younger players like Andre Jackson Jr. and AJ Green is a bit concerning. We know what Connaughton brings to the table, so it seems counterintuitive to play him so heavily in a preseason game.

It would’ve been nice to see the younger players get more burn, allowing them to develop and showcase their potential. The early signs suggest Connaughton might maintain a significant spot in the rotation—a troubling thought given his decline over recent years. Milwaukee needs Jackson Jr. or Green to leapfrog him if they want to inject more youth and energy into their rotation.

Like: Damian Lillard In Regular Season Form

Lillard came out looking like a man on a mission. In just 17 minutes, he poured in 15 points, hit four of his six threes, and dished out four assists. It's hard to overstate how important this is for the Bucks, who are counting on him to be their offensive engine.

His shot looked crisp, his decision-making was sharp, and he seemed more than comfortable in the Bucks' new system. After a dip in his shooting numbers last season, it’s promising to see Lillard get off to a strong start, even in a game that doesn’t count. He looks locked in, and that’s exactly what Bucks fans should want to see.

Dislike: Gary Trent Jr. Injury

Trent Jr. showed flashes of what he could bring to the Bucks in his debut, hitting a smooth transition three and showing toughness fighting over screens on defense. But then disaster struck: Trent got caught on a Jalen Duren pick and went down clutching his left arm in obvious pain.

He left the game and didn’t return, with the Bucks calling it a left elbow hyperextension. Any injury in a meaningless game is a tough pill to swallow, and now Milwaukee waits to see the severity. Even a short-term absence for Trent is frustrating given how seamlessly he seemed to be fitting in on both ends of the floor.

Like: Taurean Prince’s Defensive Chops

Taurean Prince flashed some serious defensive potential in his Bucks debut, showing why Milwaukee signed him this offseason. He provided a highlight-reel moment by stuffing Jaden Ivey at the rim on a fast break—complete with a primal scream afterward—but it was his fundamental work that really stood out.

At 6-foot-6, 219 pounds, Prince offers the physicality Milwaukee needs on the perimeter, but it’s his lateral quickness that sets him apart from past experiments like Jae Crowder. Prince stayed in front of ball-handlers on multiple possessions and used his active hands to disrupt plays. This combination of size and mobility is exactly what the Bucks need to shore up their perimeter defense.

Dislike: Young Players In The Second Half

If you were hoping to see encouraging signs from the Bucks’ young players in the second half of Sunday’s game, you came away disappointed. Milwaukee’s youth was completely overmatched, getting blitzed 60-29 by the Pistons, including a dismal 8-29 fourth quarter.

No single player stood out either—it was a collective collapse. Chris Livingston, Tyler Smith, Andre Jackson Jr., AJ Green, AJ Johnson, and MarJon Beauchamp combined to shoot an abysmal 5-for-33 (15 percent) from the floor. Yikes.

While it’s just preseason, games like this make it hard to envision these young players carving out significant rotation spots once the real games begin. They’ll need to show much more to make a case for consistent minutes this season.
