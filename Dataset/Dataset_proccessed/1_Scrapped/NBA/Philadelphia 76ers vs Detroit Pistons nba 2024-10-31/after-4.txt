The home crowd jeered a former Philadelphia 76ers player after the public address announcer mentioned Tobias Harris' name on Wednesday. The 76ers are hosting the Detroit Pistons as part of their three-game homestand.

The Pistons' starting lineup was revealed prior to the game, and supporters welcomed a well-known player back with mixed emotions.

Harris is a recognizable figure for Philly fans. After being traded by the Los Angeles Clippers, the forward moved to the city during the middle of the 2018-19 NBA season. The Sixers wanted him to be part of the future and signed him to a five-year, $180 million contract extension over the summer.

However, those five years went by and the team didn't bear fruit with Harris on the roster. During the recent offseason, the organization let him leave as a free agent. The veteran forward signed a two-year, $52 million contract for a second stint with the Pistons.

During his time with the Sixers, the 6-foot-8 forward averaged 17.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Harris shot an effective 36.9% from long range, making him a respectable shooter for Philadelphia's squad.

Yet he has struggled with his new team. Harris has averaged 10.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.3 assists while playing 34.8 minutes in the season's first four games. The forward is having difficulties making shots, only knocking down 34.1% of his shots from the field and 17.6% of his 3-pointers.

Tobias Harris reflected on his time with the Sixers

Although Tobias Harris' time with the Sixers wasn't the best, he still had some of his best moments as an NBA player with the organization. On Wednesday, he shared takes on his former team for the first time since leaving in the summer. Harris took time to reflect on his time with the Philly team.

According to the Pistons veteran, his time with the Sixers taught him to grow as a player and a person. Harris talked about it during their pregame shootaround.

"It was the first thing in my life that I saw through," Harris said. "The five years being here. And I do think there is tremendous growth in that, and in weathering the storm and finding ways to come through and out of it in some type of fashion and really battle through it."
