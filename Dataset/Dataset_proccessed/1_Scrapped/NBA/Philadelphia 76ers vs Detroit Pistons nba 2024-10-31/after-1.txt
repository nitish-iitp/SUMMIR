Jaden Ivey scored 23 points and Cade Cunningham chipped in 22 as the Detroit Pistons earned their first win of the NBA season, defeating the host Philadelphia 76ers 105-95 on Wednesday.

Detroit’s Tobias Harris, who spent the previous 5 1/2 seasons with Philadelphia, contributed 18 points and 14 rebounds — both season highs. The Pistons, who had dropped their first four games, also received key contributions from Tim Hardaway Jr. (16 points), Malik Beasley (11 points) and Isaiah Stewart (seven points, 11 rebounds).

Tyrese Maxey led the Sixers with 32 points, but he shot just 2 of 10 from 3-point range as part of a teamwide 8-of-28 effort (28.6 percent) from long distance. Kelly Oubre Jr. registered 13 points, while rookie Jared McCain notched 12 points for his first career double-digit scoring effort.

The 76ers remain without stars Joel Embiid and Paul George due to knee injuries.

Detroit’s advantage swelled to as many as 21 when Beasley’s 3-pointer made it 79-58 with 3:19 left in the third period.
