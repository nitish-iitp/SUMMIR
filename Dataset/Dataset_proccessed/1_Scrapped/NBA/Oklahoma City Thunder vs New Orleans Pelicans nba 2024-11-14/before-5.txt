Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best selections on Thursday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Victor Wembanyama (SAS, C)	$21,820	64.3	2.9
Value	Guerschon Yabusele (PHI, C/PF)	$9,700	34.8	3.6
Fade	Kyle Lowry (PHI, SG/PG)	$11,080	19.4	1.8
Cheapie	Duop Reath (POR, C)	$6,000	20	3.3

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Thursday teams, consider starting with a value player like Guerschon Yabusele. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Victor Wembanyama is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Duop Reath.

On the other hand, according to our model, Kyle Lowry is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if entering multiple line-ups.
