In case you forgot, De’Aaron Fox is special
Players like De'Aaron Fox don't come around often. Especially not in Sacramento.

Sometimes, I take De’Aaron Fox for granted. I shouldn’t, but it’s true. He’s been with the team for what feels like forever now, and you’d think we’d have seen everything he can do by now. Sure, there’s the lightning speed, the big shots and the steals. But it’s almost routine for him. You look at a box score and you almost expect to see Fox have 25 points, 5 assists, 5 rebounds and a couple steals. But these last two nights were on another level.

109 points in back to back games. A franchise record 60 points in a heartbreaking overtime loss to the Wolves. 49 the next night with the Kings missing two stars and their sixth man, willing the team to victory all by himself. He’s solidified himself in the annals of not just Sacramento-era history, but franchise history dating back to the 1950s.

The Kings were missing so much scoring potential these last two games with DeMar DeRozan and Malik Monk being out for both and Domantas Sabonis missing the Utah game, and Fox just took the onus on himself to lead the charge. He nearly snatched victory from defeat by clawing the Kings back singlehandedly from a 20 point second half deficit against the Timberwolves. Scoring 60 points is hard enough, but to do it against a Timberwolves team that is one of the better defensive teams in the league? When the other team is putting guys 5 inches taller on him and greeting him at the rim with a 7’1 four-time Defensive Player of the Year? Fox looked absolutely exhausted at the end of regulation against the Wolves, and yet he still managed to hit a couple more big shots down the stretch.

After such a grueling effort, nobody would have been surprised to see the Kings fall to the Jazz last night, especially after the news came that Domantas Sabonis would also be missing time. Fox found extra reserves though and just kept on coming, bringing the rest of the team with him. Every one of his 49 points was needed too, as the Kings had to fight their way back from a 4th quarter deficit. This time, Fox’s teammates helped shoulder the load a bit more, hitting some key shots down the stretch to help seal the victory. But it was Fox who got them to the finish line.

It’s easy to forget because he’s been with the team for eight seasons now, but De’Aaron Fox isn’t even 27 yet. He’s just entering the prime of his career. He’s improved on almost every aspect of his game, becoming not just one of the top scoring guards in the league but also one of the better two-way players. With these past two games he’s showing us that the best may very well be yet to come, and I for one, won’t be taking him for granted ever again.

Kayte mentioned that Luke Loucks told Fox to get to the paint more a couple games ago. We see the results.

Many commenters and writers on this site have said that same thing for months/years now. Are we exceptionally smart, or is the staff blind and stuck in their ways, often slow to react and change things up? Or is Fox the one settling for 3s and trying to be Curry?

I don’t think any of us is necessarily smarter than the coaches or GMs. I think they are a little more patient than we are, and they also understand a lot more nuances behind things. For example, we might see a guy get beat, but they know if that guy was doing what he was supposed to be doing on the play.

Greg ruined TKH.

If fans don’t know better, or at least think that they know better, a site like this has very little comments and discussion.

We are excellent GM’s, much better than Vlade, and know what the stretch provision is and that Luka is better than Bagley.

We are also excellent coaches, we watched the tape as much and more than Luke Walton. I mean, Jack has been a coach for 82 years!

Failure is the best teacher, and no-one has been taught as much as us Kings fans over the last two decades.

And patience? Don’t talk to us about patience. Still waiting for the first play-off series win…

The “exceptionally smarter” comment was made more in jest. Like you said, we see the results and not the process, and often are less patient.

It’s just frustrating when some of the stuff I see is so painfully obvious that it isn’t working (3pt defense scheme), but nothing changes.

And to add:

Besides all of those above areas of knowledge, we also have advanced degrees in player potential, draft and current.

We are a whole other level better at officiating. That’s not even close. If
you don’t believe me, I’ll send you my latest Two Minute Report (it may be longer than necessary, and have various stat numbers thrown in. and if I can a gif, that too. Because)

Will THEY (the thems) listen to us?

I love his evolution so far I just hope he has finally realized that his inside penetration game and mid-range shots set up his 3s and it should always be that way. When he gets cooking by attacking the paint and mid range it sets up more open and makable three point shots or a few off the bounce. If those aren’t falling just keep sticking to mostly paint shots. Never lead with a bunch of 3s and long mid range shots.
The only thing holding him back from being truly elite is consistently hitting 3s at a respectable clip (not taking too many) and hitting FTs at a consistently high percentage (at least 80%). It’s true he is just hitting his peak, I want him to be 1st or 2nd team All-Nba, we’re going to need it to be a legit contender.

The speed makes defenders on their heels, which opens up the quick stop in the paint for the open floater. Work inside out

Which isn’t going to stop fans from saying we need to trade him now because he isn’t a (Fill in the blank.)

But it’s so great to have a Kings player who is such a great player and such a great person. I totally agree that we take him for granted at times.

At his current pace, Fox would be a lock for an All-NBA squad, which make him eligible for a super max extension. Remember, he didn’t sign an extension this past summer because he could potentially make more if he made All-NBA. He turned down a 3 year $165M extension for the possibility of the very rare Designated Player Extension at 5 years $349M That’s a jump from roughly $55M per year to roughly $70M per year. You read that right…$70 MILLION PER YEAR. It would also be the largest NBA contract ever.

Monte would need to do some very clever cap management because in 2 years Fox and Sabonis will be slated to make up over 60% of the salary cap.

Good thing Monte’s been stocking the roster with 1st and 2nd round picks rather than trading/selling those picks away right?

Right??

I am of the opinion that with the new CBA apron rules it’s an absolute must to have cheap controlled talent to compete, especially if area team handing out a super max contract.

Monte has definitely been mining for diamonds in undrafted players, but I feel the real gems are going to be late first round picks. They are cheap and controlled for years. If you can find a solid rotational player in the late 20s of the draft, they are worth their weight in gold.

How do you see likely expansion to 32 teams effecting that?

I expect some down sloping stars to become available to those new teams (always the challenge- finally get to open the doors and they want to make a big splash) and the draft lottery is going to have nee entrants. But no, I don’t think the 2031 pick swap will destroy the Kings.

That’s a great question. I have no idea how they are going to do expansion rules this time. They seem to change each time.

To your point, I could see a team like the Suns making Beal available just to clear cap space. He’s overpaid for his production, and I’m sure there will be more like him.

I’m curious how many games Fox will have to play to surpass Jason Thompson for most games played with the Kings. Crazy he’s been here for almost eight years.

Per basketball reference, Thompson played 541 games for the Kings; Fox is currently at 483 games.

Not surprising. Let them (and Domas) fully heal and be ready for a division opponent on Friday.

Yup. A nice little bonus is ATL is coming in off of a close back to back loss in PDX. They may have some tired legs to balance out our injured roster.

Will MB bench Keegan because he was passive on offense in the Jazz game now that he has seen Isaac Jones play non-garbage time minutes?

I don’t think so. He could go for another 47 on Monday. He is in a slump offensively right now but sitting on the bench isn’t going to solve it.

Fox is special IF he attacks the paint. That is his superpower getting to the paint or elbow and finishing from those spots. He is not special or even very good at taking quick 3s. IMO, how good he is playing depends on his aggressiveness, shot selection and defensive intensity.

Fox is truly one of a kind. The Domas trade unlocked him in a way more valuable than Haliburton could ever be.
