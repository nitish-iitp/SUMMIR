A new season means a new edition of ESPN’s top-100 NBA player rankings!

ESPN has released its top-100 player rankings for the upcoming NBA regular season, and it’s time to take a peek at where the Sacramento Kings stand, according to this year’s panel.

Will De’Aaron Fox or Domantas Sabonis crack the top 20? Is DeMar DeRozan worthy of a top 50 spot? Let’s take a look.

ESPN NBA Player Rank: Where the Sacramento Kings stand

45. DeMar DeRozan, F, Sacramento Kings

2023 NBA Rank: 39

With the Bulls last season, DeMar DeRozan had to shoulder all of the offensive weight — he was the only player in Chicago to average over 20 points per game as the injury-riddled Bulls struggled all year. As he begins a new chapter in Sacramento, the Kings will look to maximize his offensive talents and draw double-teams to help take pressure off of De’Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis. The team will also use DeRozan as a playmaker — an area of his game Sacramento feels is underrated. — Kendra Andrews

29. Domantas Sabonis, F, Sacramento Kings

2023 NBA Rank: 22

When you look at Sabonis’ numbers from last season, it’s not easy to comprehend why he dropped seven positions in the rankings. He led the league in triple-doubles (26) and double-doubles (77) and strung together 61 consecutive double-doubles — the longest streak in modern NBA history. From January to the end of the season, he also led the league in assists. But he and the Kings enter this season under a microscope after not making the playoffs last season and have more pressure to prove they are still in the mix for the top of the West. — Andrews

26. De’Aaron Fox, G, Sacramento Kings

2023 NBA Rank: 23

Fox got off to a hot start last season, averaging 31.8 points through his first seven games — including 43 points against the Spurs. He finished the season averaging 26.6 points per game and led the league with 2.0 steals per game. Despite the continued improvement of the Kings’ lead guard, the team couldn’t match the postseason success it had in 2023. — Andrews
