3. LONZO BALL’S LONG ROAD BACK TO THE COURT

It’s been 1,006 days since Lonzo Ball last played an NBA game.

But tonight, the Bulls guard and former No. 2 overall pick aims to take the floor for the first time since Jan. 14, 2022, as Chicago hosts Anthony Edwards and the Wolves (8 ET, League Pass).

Ball’s Backstory: Following two seasons with both the Lakers (2017-19) and Pelicans (2019-21), Ball was acquired by Chicago ahead of the 2021-22 campaign, in which he averaged 13 points and 5.1 assists while shooting 42.3% from 3 in 35 games
The Injury: However, a lingering left knee injury derailed his season, which ultimately required three surgeries to repair, including meniscus and cartilage replacements
“It started on the Lakers when I tore [my meniscus] the first time,” said Ball. “Tore it a couple more times to a point to where there was no more meniscus left, with bone-on-bone rubbing. So the cartilage was gone. The bone was messed up.”

The injury forced Ball to miss the last 2 1/2 seasons, and he says it took around 14 or 15 months to identify the problem with his knee. He faced several setbacks, dealing with pain while jumping or even climbing stairs.

But tonight, he’ll take a monumental step toward his goal of playing in Chicago’s regular-season opener next Wednesday against the Raptors.

“That’s the plan that I’m on, and I haven’t had any setbacks. I expect to play the first game … I firmly believe that.”

Four more matchups get underway Wednesday, including Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs vs. Cade Cunningham and the Pistons on NBA TV and three additional games on NBA League Pass.

Cavaliers at Pistons (7 ET, NBA TV)
Nets at 76ers (7 ET, League Pass)
Hawks at Heat (7:30 ET, League Pass)
Ratiopharm Ulm at Trail Blazers (10 ET, League Pass)

4. WNBA FINALS: LYNX HOST LIBERTY FOR PIVOTAL GAME 3

The 2024 WNBA Finals have shifted from Brooklyn to Minneapolis for tonight’s pivotal Game 3 between the Lynx and Liberty (8 ET, ESPN).

How We Got Here

Game 1 (Lynx 95, Liberty 93, OT): Down by as many as 18, the Lynx rallied past the Liberty behind a clutch four-point play by Courtney Williams
Game 2 (Liberty 80, Lynx 66): Once again the Lynx got down big and rallied to make it a one-possession game, but this time New York had an answer, closing the game on a 12-0 run to even the series

What’s At Stake

Since the WNBA Finals went to a best-of-five in 2005, the series has been tied 1-1 14 times. The winner of Game 3 has gone on to win 71.4% (10-4) of the time

What To Watch

The 1st Quarter: The Liberty jumped out to double-digit leads in the first two games in Brooklyn. Between the regular season and Playoffs combined, NY is 29-3 when winning the 1st quarter. Can the Lynx get off to a better start at home?
19 Points Away: Collier enters Game 3 with 227 points scored (25.3 per game) in the 2024 Playoffs – the fourth-most all-time. If she scores 19+ points tonight, she’ll pass Maya Moore, Brittney Griner and Diana Taurasi for the highest-scoring postseason ever
The X Factor: In their Game 1 win, the Lynx got 10 points from Natisha Hiedeman in 13 minutes off the bench. In their Game 2 win, the Liberty saw Betnijah Laney-Hamilton match her season-high with 20 points, including a clutch 3 to halt Minnesota’s rally. Who will be the difference maker in Game 3?
Closing Time: The first two games of the series were both decided in clutch time with the winning team using a 12-0 run in the closing minutes. Both teams have played in 20 clutch games between the regular season and Playoffs – the Liberty are 16-4 (.800), while the Lynx are 12-8 (.600)

5. BEHIND CLOSED DOORS: ALL-ACCESS AT TRAINING CAMP
