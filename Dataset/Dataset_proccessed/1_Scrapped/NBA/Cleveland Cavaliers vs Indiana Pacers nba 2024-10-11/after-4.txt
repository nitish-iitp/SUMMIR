The Indiana Pacers got the better of the Cleveland Cavaliers, 129-117, during their NBA preseason clash on October 11, 2024.

After a disappointing one-point loss during their preseason opener against the Atlanta Hawks, the Pacers vented their ire on the Cavaliers and banked on a momentum-changing third-quarter performance to pull away from the game.

Indiana survived Cleveland’s early scoring rampage in the first canto and trailed by three points, 28-21, before stepping on the gas pedal in the last three quarters.

The Pacers dropped 41 markers in the second frame, equalizing Atlanta with the highest scoring output in a quarter in the ongoing NBA preseason.

Indiana then picked up where they left off in the second half as they outplayed the Cavaliers on both ends led by Bennedict Mathurin who went unconscious in the pivotal third.

Mathurin shot the lights out for the Pacers and helped them breakaway for a double-digit advantage heading into the fourth quarter.

After the showdown, Indiana’s scoring machine finished with a team-high 25-point outing built from an efficient 8/12 shooting from the field including five three-pointers.

James Wiseman, a former NBA lottery pick who found his way back in the league again, impressed for the Pacers and chipped in eight markers and 10 rebounds.

Indiana’s superstar Tyrese Haliburton only logged in 17 minutes but delivered an all-around outing of seven points, four assists, two steals, and a rebound.

On the other hand, the star trio of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, and Evan Mobley didn’t suit up for Cleveland, due to the coach’s decision.

They were led by emerging shooting guard Ty Jerome, who boosted the Cavaliers with 15 markers, eight dimes, and four boards.
