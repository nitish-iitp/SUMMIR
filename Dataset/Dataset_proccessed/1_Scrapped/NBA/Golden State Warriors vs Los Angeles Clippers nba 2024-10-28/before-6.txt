WARRIORS RIDE WINNING STREAK INTO SALT LATE CITY
The Warriors have won seven straight games between their 6-0 preseason and their 36-point win in their regular season opener and will look to keep the streak going against the Jazz in Utah on Friday. 

The Jazz were narrowly defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies in their season opener 126-124 despite star forward Lauri Markkanen scoring a game-high 35 points on 82.7 TS% in 35 minutes. The one-time All-Star and Most Improved Player averaged 23.2 points on 63.1 TS% last season.

KERR TO DEPLOY 12-MAN ROTATION
Head Coach Steve Kerr entered the season believing he had 13 rotational-caliber players. Before the season opener, Kerr told sharpshooting newcomer Lindy Waters III and second-year forward Gui Santos that they wouldn't be in the rotation to begin the season. However, despite wanting to cut the rotation down to just 10 players, Kerr wasn't able to justify that to himself, believing that all 12 of the remaining options had proven throughout training camp and the preseason to deserve minutes. Those 12 players being his five starters — Stephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, Draymond Green, Trayce Jackson-Davis and seven reserves — Buddy Hield, Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody, De'Anthony Melton, Kyle Anderson, Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II. In the season opener, Kerr played 11 players in the first quarter, with Moody being the 12th to begin the second quarter. Due to the commanding lead, Waters and Santos also played in the fourth quarter.

UTAH SCOUTING REPORT
The Utah Jazz are one of the younger teams in the Western Conference, led by 27-year-old 7-footer Lauri Markkanen, who has had a career resurgence since joining the Jazz ahead of the 2022-23 season. Markkanen is an effective three-level-scorer and one of the premiere shooters in the league, especially at his size. He is joined in the frontcourt by another 7-footer, Walker Kessler, an elite rim protector averaging over two blocks per game in his first two seasons. Kessler blocked five shots in the season opener while recording a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double. In the backcourt, the Jazz have reigning All-Rookie Second Team guard Keyonte George, who averaged 13.0 points and 4.4 assists in his rookie campaign.
