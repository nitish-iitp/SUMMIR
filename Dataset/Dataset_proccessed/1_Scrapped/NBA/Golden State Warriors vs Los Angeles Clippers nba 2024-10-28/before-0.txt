Stay up to date with the Warriors' top performers from Week 1 of the 2024-25 regular season.

Oct. 27, Andrew Wiggins: Warriors 104 - Clippers 112

PTS	3PM	TS%
29	5	88.85

Andrew Wiggins scored a game-high 29 points and made a game-best five 3-pointers in the Warriors' 112-104 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers at Chase Center on Sunday. Wiggins scored at least nine points in three different quarters, including shooting a perfect 4-for-4 in the third quarter and his highest-scoring 11-point fourth quarter on 4-for-5 shooting. His 29 points and five 3-pointers were an early season high, as he shot 11-for-15 from the field and 5-for-8 from three. Wiggins was also tasked with being the primary defender on the Clippers' go-to offensive player, James Harden. Harden shot just 6-for-19 from the field but recorded a double-double with 23 points and 11 assists.

Oct. 25, Buddy Hield: Warriors 127 - Jazz 86

PTS	3PM	TS%
27	7	96.43

Buddy Hield scored 24 of his game-high 27 points in the first half of the Warriors' 127-86 victory over the Jazz in Utah on Friday. Hield moved to 21st on the NBA's all-time made 3-pointers list and set an NBA record for the most made 3-pointers through two games with a new team (12). He also contributed in other ways, dishing out six assists, including an alley-oop to Jonathan Kuminga.

"He brings so much energy to the floor," Kerr said postgame. "He runs so hard in both directions and sets a tone. What he brings to the team goes way beyond his shooting, but that's massive in and of itself. He's one of the best shooters in the league."

Oct. 23, Buddy Hield: Warriors 140 - Blazers 104

PTS	3PM	TS%
22	5	88.42

In his Warriors debut, Buddy Hield led the way with 22 points and five made 3-pointers in a 140-104 victory over the Trail Blazers in Portland on Wednesday. The Warriors missed their first 10 3-point attempts, but Hield broke the seal with back-to-back triples. He was extremely efficient throughout, shooting 8-for-12 from the field and 5-for-7 from deep. Hield made the second-most threes for a player making their Warriors debut in franchise history, only trailing Nick Young's six threes against the Houston Rockets on Oct. 17, 2017.

"The last time I felt this free was Oklahoma," Hield said, comparing the free-flowing Warriors offense and scoring opportunities he received to his college days at the University of Oklahoma. Hield led Oklahoma to the final four in his senior season, leading the NCAA in made 3-pointers and winning the John R. Wooden Award awarded to the best player in college basketball.
