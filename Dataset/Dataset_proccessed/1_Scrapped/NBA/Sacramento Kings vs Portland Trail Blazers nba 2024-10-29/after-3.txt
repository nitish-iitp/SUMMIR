De’Aaron Fox scored a game-high 24 points, DeMar DeRozan chipped in with 23 and the host Sacramento Kings broke into the win column with a 111-98 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night.

Domantas Sabonis went for 16 points and game highs in rebounds with 13 and assists with seven against his dad Arvydas’ old team, allowing the Kings to break through after tough losses at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves and on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Deandre Ayton had a 20-point, 11-rebound double-double to pace the Trail Blazers, who were coming off their first win of the season, a 125-103 showing at home vs. the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday.

Sacramento scored the game’s first seven points and never trailed, leading by as many as 26. Sabonis had a dunk and a layup and Kevin Huerter buried a 3-pointer during the game-opening run, which lasted until Ayton hit a jumper a full 3:20 into the contest.

The Trail Blazers trailed just 51-43 at halftime before Sacramento blitzed the visitors with a 38-point third period.

A 3-pointer by Jerami Grant had Portland within 60-58 with 7:26 left in the third, but Fox bombed in a 3-pointer to ignite a back-breaking, 12-0 run. Huerter added a 3-pointer during the flurry.

Sacramento led 89-71 by period’s end and coasted home.

Huerter blocked three shots and also finished with 18 points, 12 coming on 4-for-9 shooting from outside the arc. The Kings outscored the Trail Blazers 42-12 on 3-pointers, limiting the visitors to a 4-for-22 clip from deep.

Malik Monk added three 3-pointers and 12 points for the Kings, who outshot the Trail Blazers 45.7 percent to 42.2 percent overall.

DeRozan (three) and Fox (two) combined for five of Sacramento’s eight steals.

Scoot Henderson ran up 18 points to complement a team-high five assists off the bench for Portland, while Jabari Walker had 15 points and Anfernee Simons posted 12. Grant totaled just seven points to go with eight rebounds on a 3-for-12 shooting night.
