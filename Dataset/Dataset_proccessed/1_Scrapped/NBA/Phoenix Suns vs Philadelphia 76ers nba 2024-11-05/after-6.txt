Sharjah 24 - AFP: Kevin Durant’s clutch performance lifted the Phoenix Suns to a thrilling 118-116 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA. With 24 seconds remaining, Durant broke a tie with a key shot, securing his team’s sixth win of the season and fifth straight victory.
The game also marked Paul George’s debut for the 76ers after missing the first five games due to a knee injury. George contributed 15 points, five rebounds, and four assists but missed a potential game-tying shot in the final seconds.

Durant led the Suns with 35 points, while Bradley Beal added 17 and Jusuf Nurkic contributed 15 points and 15 rebounds. The Suns will next face the Miami Heat, while the 76ers visit the Los Angeles Clippers.
