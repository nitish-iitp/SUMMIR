Takeaways

Pacers: Indiana had one of the best offenses in league history last season and set an NBA playoff record by shooting 67.1% from the field in its last trip to Madison Square Garden for a Game 7 victory last season in the Eastern Conference semifinals, so nights like Friday figure to be rare.

Knicks: This was how the Knicks hoped to look on both ends of the floor after the trades for Towns and Bridges. Towns’ ability to make 3-pointers had the floor spaced nicely for the guards to drive, and with Bridges, OG Anunoby and Hart on the perimeter, the Pacers struggled to get into any kind of offense.

Key stat

After allowing an NBA record-tying 29 3-pointers in the loss in Boston, the Knicks held the Pacers to 3 for 30 (10%) behind the arc.
