The Los Angeles Lakers announced on Thursday that rookie guard Bronny James has been assigned to the team's G League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers.

James will remain with the Lakers through Friday when they host the Philadelphia 76ers and then debut for South Bay on Saturday. He's also slated to only play in South Bay home games, with the Lakers expected to move James between their NBA and G League squads throughout the NBA season, according to ESPN.

James has appeared in four of the Lakers' eight games and played roughly 13 minutes total this season. He scored his first points in the team's Oct. 30 road loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, where his father, now-teammate LeBron James, played a combined 11 seasons and won the 2016 NBA Finals.
