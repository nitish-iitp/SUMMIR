MILWAUKEE BUCKS
Giannis Calls Out Isaiah Stewart's 'Dangerous' Flagrant Foul: 'Not a Basketball Play'

Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo was the subject of a hard flagrant-2 foul by Detroit Pistons center Isaiah Stewart during Wednesday night's game, but he kept a level head when discussing the incident.

"I've been in that position many times in my life," Antetokounmpo said after the game, per ESPN. "I have two older brothers that pushed me on the floor, were tough on me. It doesn't really faze me anymore. All I could think about was, 'Get up and make two free throws.' At the same time it's a dangerous play. It's not a basketball play."

Stewart was ejected for the remainder of the game after he pulled Antetokounmpo to the ground by his jersey during the third quarter. His frustration likely stemmed from the two-time NBA MVP's thorough dominance of the Pistons.

Antetokounmpo scored a season-high 59 points on 21-of-34 shooting while adding 14 rebounds, seven assists, three blocks and two steals to help lead Milwaukee to a 127-120 overtime victory over Detroit. The Bucks were without star point guard Damian Lillard and veteran forward Khris Middleton, and the 29-year-old completely put the team on his back to earn the win.

This marked the first time this season that Milwaukee (4-8) won back-to-back games. It can be expected that Antetokounmpo and company will be motivated to make it three in a row when they visit the Charlotte Hornets (4-7) on Saturday.
