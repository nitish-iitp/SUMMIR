Week 3 of the NBA schedule for New Orleans (3-4) includes Monday and Wednesday home games vs. Portland and Cleveland, followed by a one-game road trip for a Friday game at Orlando. The Pelicans are in 12th place in the Western Conference, but only a half-game behind seventh.

New Orleans will host Portland (2-5) tonight at 8:30, with the tip-off later than normal on Election Day Eve, as the NBA staggers start times every 15 minutes Monday. All 30 NBA teams are in action. Tickets may be purchased here.

The Pelicans dropped to 1-1 on their four-game homestand Sunday, losing 126-111 to Atlanta.

Watch postgame reaction from Brandon Ingram (team-best 32 points).
