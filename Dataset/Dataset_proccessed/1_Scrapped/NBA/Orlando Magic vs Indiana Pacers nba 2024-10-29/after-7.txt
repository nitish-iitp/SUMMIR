Banchero tied the Orlando Magic record for points in a half, scoring 37 in the first two quarters against the Indiana Pacers. He finished with a career-high 50 points — tying the fifth-highest scoring effort in Magic history. Orlando won 119-115.

“It was just being in the zone,” Banchero said. “Felt like I was in an open gym, back at home, just working on my game. Every shot felt like it was going in and it’s a good feeling when you’ve got a day like that. Not every game is going to be like that, but I’m glad today was.”

The 37 points in the half tied the mark set by McGrady, also in the first half, for Orlando against Washington in the game where he finished with 62.

“That first half was a magical first half, for sure,” Banchero said.

Banchero’s career-high entering Monday was 43 points, set Jan. 3 against Sacramento. There were four first-half performances of 37 or more points last season — two by Phoenix’s Devin Booker, one by Karl-Anthony Towns (then of Minnesota, now of New York) and one by Dallas’ Luka Doncic.
