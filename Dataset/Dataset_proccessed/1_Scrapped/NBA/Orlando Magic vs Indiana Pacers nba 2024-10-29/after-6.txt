After exploding for 50 points in Monday night's win over the Indiana Pacers, Orlando Magic rising star Paolo Banchero compared the feeling to being in a video game.

When asked during an appearance on ESPN's NBA Today about receiving "MVP!" chants from the home crowd at the Kia Center, Banchero said, "It's a dream come true. I said before, it feels like when you're in 2K."

"It feels like when you're in 2K." 😂 <br><br>Paolo Banchero with <a href="https://twitter.com/malika_andrews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@malika_andrews</a> on becoming the 2nd youngest player with 50 Pts, 10 Reb &amp; 5 Ast in NBA history against the Pacers 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/HVtDrYkcRH">pic.twitter.com/HVtDrYkcRH</a>

From the start of the game, it was clear that it was going to be a special night for Banchero. He had 37 points in the first half alone and finished the game with 13 rebounds, nine assists, two blocks and a steal as the Magic improved to 3-1 with a 119-115 victory.

Banchero had failed to score 20 points in back-to-back outings before his 50-point outburst on Monday. His consistency will be the key to Orlando's success this season.

Banchero and the Magic will look for another strong performance when they visit the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday.
