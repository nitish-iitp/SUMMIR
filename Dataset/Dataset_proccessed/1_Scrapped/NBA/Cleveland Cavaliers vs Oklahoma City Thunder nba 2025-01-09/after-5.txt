“They finally learned who Evan Mobley is and they still have a lot more to learn,” Allen said. “He was doing everything for us. On the defensive end, he was getting stops, on the offensive end we literally just drew up a play, gave him the ball, and said ‘Go to work,’ and he got us a big bucket at the end.”

Mobley was then asked if he feels like a star player.

“Yeah, definitely starting to feel like that,” Mobley said. “Just all the hard work is paying off. I’ve been in the gym these past two years and just trying to work on my offensive game, keeping my defensive game at the same level, and I feel like all the hard work is paying off.”

Cavs defeat Thunder in battle of the best records

In the end, it was the Cavs that took home the victory.

After the game, Darius Garland made an All-Star pitch for not just himself, but for his other teammates as well.

“I’ve been trying to be as humble as possible, but yeah, I should be an All-Star. Yes. There should be four of us on this team that’s All-Stars,” Garland said via Cavs reporter Danny Cunningham.

The Cavs are playing some of the best basketball in the league this season, and a win like that should prove some of the doubters wrong who don’t believe what they’re doing is real. It wouldn’t be a surprise if these two teams saw each other again down the line in the NBA Finals.
