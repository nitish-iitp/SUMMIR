Zach LaVine stats tonight: All-Star guard sizzles as Bulls lose nail-biter to Grizzlies | 2024 NBA preseason

Zach LaVine shrugged off the summer rust from the Chicago Bulls' preseason opener with a 28-point blitz in their second preseason skirmish vs the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday (Oct. 12). The All-Star guard finished with 28 points, four assists, and two steals in 19 minutes shooting 9-12 from the field and a sensational 6-6 from beyond the arc. However, a late Grizzlies surge saw the Bulls go down 124-121.

The forward went on a rampage in the second quarter against the Ja Morant-less Grizzlies putting up 15 points in the second quarter as the Bulls outscored Memphis 37-23.

His efforts saw the side head 65-51 into the halftime break. LaVine had a forgettable start to the preseason with just seven points on 3-8 shooting from the field and 1-4 from the free throw line against the Cleveland Cavaliers, but the Bulls began their preseason on a winning note pipping the Cavs 116-112.

Zach LaVine ended last season averaging 19.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per contest shooting 45.2% from the field and 34.9% from the three-point range in 25 games. He now heads into his 11th season in the league, and what will be his eighth year with the Chicago Bulls.
