Following the Oklahoma City Thunder's blowout win over the Chicago Bulls, a reunion was held on the court.

Josh Giddey was embraced one-by-one by his former Thunder teammates. The 22-year-old had an early reunion against his old squad in the 2024-25 regular season schedule.

After chatting it up with several former teammates, Giddey posed for a group photo with the Thunder. The recent tradition has been used when OKC has played against former teammates. It's happened with Eugene Omoruyi, Tre Mann and Davis Bertans. Giddey's the latest name on the list.

Giddey was shipped to the Bulls in a one-for-one swap with Alex Caruso last offseason. After declining to come off the bench, the 22-year-old opted for a fresh start elsewhere that can return him to his primary ball-handler role. It's an understandable request as he tries to get an extension off his rookie deal.

When Thunder fans examined the 2024-25 season, many circled this matchup. The off-court storylines turned this otherwise mundane matchup into reality television. Would Giddey seek revenge against his old squad? How will the Thunder defend their former teammate?

Alas, the potential fireworks only provided sparks.

Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault said pregame he wouldn't focus on the Giddey matchup more than the actual game. He said it was too early in the season to adjust to the opponent.

“It’s the second game of the season, so we're not in the mode right now. We have a gameplan, but we're not in the mode right now to get super scheme-y," Daigneault said. "We're really trying to build a foundation of the things that I was just talking about with Nick (Collison), which are the things that are going to help us sustain throughout the course of the season. To be honest with you, we've been focused way more on our own team and our own habits than we have been on the opponents."

After the win, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams expressed a similar sentiment.

"I think it was just having fun when he's out there," Williams said on facing Giddey. "I think everybody is just happy he has another good organization to go to and be able to play his game. We don't go into games like, 'Whoever was here, we try to attack them.' We just try to continue to play the way we play."

Holmgren added: "I think you can get wrapped up in the business this is because it is a business. And it's an extremely serious business. But you can't lose sight in the relationships you build with guys along the way."

Seeing Giddey in a different uniform likely invoked emotions from Thunder fans, but for the team itself, it was business as usual. The average NBA roster goes through high turnover rates. It's an ever-evolving organism. Teammates come and go, which is what Holmgren and Williams understand.
