Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best selections on Thursday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL, PF/C)	$21,910	61.8	2.8
Value	Taylor Hendricks (UTA, PF)	$6,790	24.7	3.6
Fade	Derrick Jones (LAC, PF/SF)	$10,040	18.6	1.8
Cheapie	Obi Toppin (IND, PF/C)	$6,000	20.7	3.4

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Thursday teams, consider starting with a value player like Taylor Hendricks. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Giannis Antetokounmpo is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Obi Toppin.

On the other hand, according to our model, Derrick Jones is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
