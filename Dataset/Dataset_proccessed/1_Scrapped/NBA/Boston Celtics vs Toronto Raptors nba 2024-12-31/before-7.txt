All-Star F Scottie Barnes tallied a team-high 19 points on 7-for-12 shooting and pulled down eight boards. R.J. Barrett added 17 points (5-13 FG) and six rebounds for the Raptors, who outrebounded the Hawks by a 52-41 margin.

The Boston Celtics have won 12 of their first 18 home games and trail Cleveland by 4.5 games for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics (23-9) rank third in the league in offensive efficiency and are averaging a shade below 120 points per game. On Sunday, Boston allowed Indiana to shoot 53 percent from the field during a 123-114 home loss. 

All-Star G Jaylen Brown matched a game-high with 31 points on 13-for-21 shooting and dished out six assists. All-Star F Jayson Tatum added 22 points (2-10 3 PT), nine rebounds, and six assists. Payton Pritchard scored 21 points off the bench for the Celtics, who missed 38 of 54 three-point attempts. 

Raptors vs Celtics Pick Analysis

Boston G Jrue Holiday (shoulder) and C Kristaps Porzingis (ankle) are listed as questionable for this game. The Raptors rank near the bottom of the league in defensive efficiency and the Celtics will bounce back from a poor three-point shooting night. Take the over. Final Score Prediction, Boston Celtics win 128-111.
