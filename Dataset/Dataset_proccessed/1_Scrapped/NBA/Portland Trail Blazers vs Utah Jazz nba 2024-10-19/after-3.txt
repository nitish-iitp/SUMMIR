The Portland Trail Blazers announced Saturday morning that they are picking up the 2025-26 team options on Scoot Henderson, Sheadon Sharpe, and Kris Murray. According to Danny Marang, Portland is also keeping guard Dalano Banton for the final main roster spot. The Blazers released a press statement about the extensions.

PORTLAND, Ore. (October 19, 2024) – The Portland Trail Blazers have exercised the 2025-26 team option on the Rookie Scale contract of guards Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson, and forward Kris Murray, it was announced today by General Manager Joe Cronin.

Sharpe, the 7th overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft by the Trail Blazers, posted 15.9 points (40.6% FG, 33.3% 3-PT, 82.4% FT), 5.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 0.9 steals in 33.1 minutes per game in 32 games (25 starts) during the 2023-24 season and earned a 2024 Rising Stars selection at All-Star weekend. The second-year guard holds career averages of 11.6 points (44.5% FG, 35.0% 3-PT, 77.2% FT), 3.5 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 0.6 steals and 25.3 minutes per game in 112 career games (40 starts) in two seasons with Portland.

During his rookie campaign, Henderson averaged 14.0 points (32.5% 3-PT, 81.9% FT), 3.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists and 28.5 minutes per game in 62 games (32 starts) for the Trail Blazers and ranked amongst rookies first in assists per game (5.4), first in total assists (336), fifth in points per game (14.0) and sixth in total points (868).

In his first season out of Iowa, Murray accrued averages of 6.1 points (39.6% FG, 26.8% 3-PT, 66.1% FT), 3.6 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 0.9 steals and 21.7 minutes per game in 62 games (29 starts) in his rookie season.

This will guarantee Sharpe’s fourth year of his rookie contract, and the third year for Henderson and Murray. Their current seasons were already guaranteed.

After a rocky start to his rookie campaign, Scoot improved in the second half of the season, and was the Blazers’ leading scorer of this preseason averaging 14.8 points, 4 boards, and 4.5 dimes in 28 minutes per game. Murray averaged 9.8 points and 3.5 boards on 54% shooting in his four preseason games. Sharpe missed preseason with a shoulder injury and is expected to miss at least a few regular season games.

Banton made an impression last season in his 30 games in Portland, averaging nearly 17 points along with 4.8 boards, 3.6 assists while attempting a career-high 6 threes per game.

Last month, our own Adrian Bernecich wrote about whether the Blazers might grant their final regular roster spot to Banton or fellow guard Devonte’ Graham; that question has now been settled.
