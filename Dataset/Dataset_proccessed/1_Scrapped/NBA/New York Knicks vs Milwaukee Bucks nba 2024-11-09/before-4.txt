The Bucks have nowhere to go. They don't have their own picks for a long time and have no trade flexibility. They went all in on the current core, then dropped the ball with their coaching hires. Adrian Griffin was bad but they replaced him with a worse coach.

They have to figure out a way with this core. I think they should fire Doc and hire a proper coach first. There's no reason you can't build an elite offense off Giannis and Lillard. They do have shooters surrounding them, it's just that nothing flows well and everyone gets cold. They don't leverage the players' strengths right now.

One aspect of this that is being understated is Giannis' decline on defense. He's nowhere near the DPOY level defender he used to be. He's not deputizing for everyone out there the way he used to. The effort isn't there. So part of it is on him. Their perimeter defense sucks, so it becomes even more important for Giannis to cover space on defense.


I think they have to entertain any offers for Dame and Middleton but I suspect no one will want them at their age which leaves Giannis as the big piece to dangle while he's still in his prime because he's a player that almost entirely depends on his power and speed & his game is not one that will age gracefully like KD and LBJ.


Middleton is unmovable but Miami would certainly trade for Dame or Giannis.

I’m legitimately shocked he was given another chance and 40 million to boot.


He really needs to kick like 5% of his earnings to Garnett Pierce and Allen.


I think people need to realize that he just isn’t a good coach. They went 7 games vs a sub .500 team in the first round.

You could have gotten half of the coaches in the nba to get the Celtics a championship.

This is how the league views the Milwaukee Bucks.



Bucks are cooked in terms of contending.

They got the Knicks in a few days time. Win that and they could go on a few games win stream and be right back in the play-off hunt. Remember there is only 2 games in the East with an over .500 record so far, they were unlucky not to win at Cleveland yesterday.

Way too soon to write them off. They have time and enough games to claw themselves back into play-off contention.

Bud is one of the best coaches on the league. Doc is one of the worst. I guarantee that Bud would have figured out how to make Giannis + Dame work.



I'm not disagreeing with this, obviously Bud is a great coach and much better. But it's not all him. half the difference in wins is Jrue to Dame.

Partly.

Dame not being a good defender was well known prior to the trade and it's something a lot of other teams deal with for their star scoring PGs. The difference with most of those other teams is that they have a defender that they can put next to their guy to help cover for them, as well as a system that would try to minimise the damage.

The Bucks have neither. They've started Malik Beasley and Gary Trent Jr in an attempt (I assume) for more spacing but it leaves you with some of the worst guard/perimeter defence in the league. This is then paired with a drop coverage defence that, while maximising Brook Lopez, all but requires guards to be able to effectively navigate screens (i.e. be a good defender).

Doc sucks but I'd be surprised if any coach could get this team to an even average level.

The bucks have other option on the team that a non bucks fan knows nothing about. They need to play their young guys to get them ready for playoffs green had 21 last nite and Ajax had some good D on Mitchell with Giannis they win that game and they should have won without him.

You're probably right, although I'd be concerned that the Trent signing came with a handshake agreement to start him. Plus you're dealing with Doc and Darvin Ham, neither of whom are known for playing youngsters over veterans.

Denver should have NOT extend Murray. Something like a Murray-Lillard swap would helped both teams. Milwaukee gets rid of Lillard's insane contract and Lillard would be more consistent playing next to Jokic.

He doesn't have to endure anything.
He made Milwaukee relevant, he delivered more than any of you could have dreamed of.

All the guys you mention were at his wedding, which means that you should probably seek for enemies elsewhere.

If you guys don't know how to draft talent, it's nobody's fault.
The last player you drafted who made a career on your team is Giannis himself. And that was in 2013.

Once he's gone, Milwaukee will return to the irrelevance they always knew.

To be fair, the bucks did trade away bulk picks for Jrue, that does make it hard to draft more talent


Some of their picks since 2013:

- Jabari Parker (above Embiid)
- Thon Maker (above Sabonis)
- Donte Divincenzo ( their best pick, which they traded eventually to get ....Ibaka)
- DJ Wilson (above Collins, Hart, Kuzma, Anunoby,
Jarrett Allen, White)
- Rashad Vaughn (above Bobby Portis and Delon Wright who now play for them lol)


4 out of 5 of these guys are out of the league (?)

That's just with a little research.
Even if they had kept the picks they traded for Jrue their draft history is so bad(worst in the league?) that they would have probably messed it up.

They lucked out on Giannis.
That's the truth.

Now, they can trade him and get a bazillion of picks to rebuild.

That's a franchise saving talent. I'm not sure they deserved it though(not talking about the fanbase).

I find it hard to believe Giannis would request a trade out, but Miami would basically have two options:

Option 1: build a trade around a Giannis for Adebayo swap, although getting this done financially is tricky on the trade machine:


Miami gets: Giannis

Milwaukee gets: Adebayo, Hardaway, 2 1sts and 2 swaps from Miami

Detroit gets: Duncan Robinson and a 2nd rd pick from Miami


Option 2: Send Butler to a 3rd team (Houston?) who would send Milwaukee pieces they like.


Miami gets: Giannis and D Brooks

Milwaukee gets: D Robinson, R Sheppard, A Thompson, Jeff Green, 2 1sts and a swap (Houston), and 2 swaps with Miami.

Houston gets: J Butler


As far as Lillard goes, Miami would have an interest, but would the Bucks be willing to accept a package around Rozier or Herro + Robinson? (This makes no sense if Giannis isn't getting traded.)

Yea I think the Dame to Miami ship has sailed. They already have a no defense playing guard in Rozier who gets them 16-19ppg. Would be boneheaded to pay DOUBLE the price for an extra 6-8ppg. Especially when Dame has already shown signs of decline.

Herro has taken another leap recording his most efficient and productive season yet. Hes easily been Miami's best player thus far. I think if he were playing like this a couple years ago Cronin woulda pulled the trigger instantly but definitely not worth including now for an aging Dame.

Now they're 100% interested in Giannis if/when he officially demands the trade but don't think they have enough... really depends if they're willing to part ways with Bam of course.

Haven't read through the thread but to me, it seems inevitable that a tear down is coming. Was never a fan of the Jrue trade and I won't get into what I think of Doc but the parts of the roster that need to be around Giannis (outside of Dame) is worn down, aged and seemingly always at risk of another injury. As for Dame, I've never liked his fit there.

I'm sure it's been floated here but the obvious fit to me is OKC. I get they're undefeated but they haven't really been tested and I still think their front court will be an issue come playoff time. iHart/Wiggins/Dieng and a barrel of frps would be hard for any team to beat. SGA, Dort, JWill, Giannis, Chet would immediately be the team to beat for years. OKC is going to have to do something with all those picks, something like 16 frps and 16 srps between now at 2031 (potentially 5 frps in 2025 draft alone), even after a mega trade, they'll still be rolling in frps/srps to keep the youth coming in.

Who knows, Bucks may right their ship and keep things together and OKC will figure something out that will come out from left field and surprise everyone.

As for Miami, they don't have enough to get him and I can't see Bam being traded anyways. If Bucks trade him, they need to take a page from Portland's book and do what's best for the team, regardless of what Heat fans think

I think the bulls would for sure look at a deal involving lavine for middleton with his expiring money, the bucks would probably entertain it as well based on their 3 point volume and lack of speed.

He should never have gotten a job after the Clippers fired him yet he’s been hired 2 or 3 times since then.
