Julius Randle's wife Kendra Randle issued an emoji-filled reaction to her husband's 33-point statement game for his new team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, against the Sacramento Kings. Randle went off for his big scoring night on Thursday, shooting 13 of 17, including 5 of 6 from 3-point range. He added five rebounds and four assists.

Here's his wife's reaction after the Timberwolves won 117-115, riding behind Randle's heroics:

Julius Randle had a relatively underwhelming debut for Minnesota against the LA Lakers on opening night, as his team lost 110-103. He had 16 points, nine rebounds and four assists on 50.0% shooting. The box scores weren't that much of an issue as he was +2, a team-high among the starters.

However, Julius Randle was seemingly the weak link for the Timberwolves on both ends. He was often caught out of position. As a result, he was outplayed by the Lakers' frontcourt of Rui Hachimura, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who shot a combined 10 of 16 with Randle guarding them.

Offensively, the Timberwolves stagnated a lot when Randle had the ball, as he couldn't get past James, Davis and Hachimura when his receiving position was at the top of the key. Nevertheless, Randle had an incredible bounce back against the Kings and will hope to continue that momentum.

Julius Randle's wife Kendra Randle adjusting well to life in Minnesota

Julius Randle's wife Kendra Randle was excited to leave New York for Minnesota. She wasn't a fan of the lack of space while living in a condo with their two kids, Kyden and Jaycey. Here's what Kendra said in a TikTok video on Oct. 1 after Randle's trade got finalized:

"It is pretty hectic," she said. "I'm really grateful that it's actually not in the middle of the season, like, before the tradeline, or whatever. But, it has been pretty crazy for our first time and unexpected."
"Living in a condo with two kids is so hard," she said. "I don't care what anyone else says. It was a great experience but we were already looking to move outside the city. It was just getting so hard and overwhelming for us."

Kendra Randle was referring to her and Julius growing up in Texas and Kentucky and how that differed from living in New York.

Kendra Randle clarified her comments on Oct. 2, saying she didn't mean it was "difficult" to live in a condo but was getting "hard," considering they had two growing kids in the house. Her comments were strictly about her excitement to have space up north as the family prepared to make the transition to live in Minnesota.
