LA Clippers vs Toronto Raptors Player Prop Picks 11-9-24

Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles Clippers will showcase two teams with shifting rosters and differing aspirations. The Raptors are in a rebuilding phase, with young talents like Scottie Barnes and a key veteran in Jakob Poeltl to anchor their frontcourt. Toronto is focused on player development and improving consistency. The Clippers, meanwhile, rely on their veteran core, particularly with James Harden. 

The Raptors have been able to keep games close with some good teams and even have wins against the Kings and Nuggets this season. They’ll look to replicate those performances against this Clippers team that still trying to find momentum this season.




 

RJ Barrett Under 24.5 PTS -110

RJ Barrett is having an impressive scoring run. Across six games, he’s averaging 25.7 points per game (PPG). His shooting has been fairly efficient, with a field goal percentage of 44.9%. Barrett has been active from beyond the arc, hitting 2.5 three-pointers per game on a 35.7% shooting clip.

We have seen a dip in Barrett’s production over the last two games with him putting up 18 in Denver and 23 in Sacramento. Now he gets matched up with this Clippers team that plays at a slow pace and has been strong on the defensive side of the ball. The Clippers are allowing 107.8 points per game which is the 4th fewest in the league. This is a tough matchup for RJ and there’s value to fade him in this spot. 

James Harden Over 9.5 AST -110

James Harden is averaging 9.4 assists per game. In addition to his playmaking, he’s contributing 20.8 points and 8.1 rebounds across 37.6 minutes per game. His assist totals reflect his continued role as a primary facilitator, helping create opportunities for his teammates.

Harden has failed to get double-digit assists in 3 straight games but this is a good spot to buy back in. Toronto is giving up 26.9 assists per game which is the 7th most in the league. We’ve seen Harden have a 16 and multiple 13-assist games this season. He’s fully capable of getting this number and I think this is a great spot for him to get back to a double-digit assist night. 

Jakob Poltl Under 10.5 Reb -110

Jakob Poeltl has been a dominant force on the boards for the Toronto Raptors in the 2024-25 NBA season. Over nine games, he is averaging 11.4 rebounds per game, ranking him 7th in the league. His rebounding efforts have been instrumental in the Raptors’ performance this season. In a standout game against the Denver Nuggets, Poeltl recorded a career-high 19 rebounds, showcasing his exceptional rebounding ability. Overall, Poeltl’s consistent rebounding has been a key asset for the Raptors, contributing significantly to their success on both ends of the court.

Since that 19-rebound game, his production on the boards has consistently dropped. He’s failed to get over 10 rebounds in three straight games and now he’s matched up with the Clippers who’re allowing the 3rd fewest rebounds to opposing teams in the league. Zubac is a presence in the paint and I don’t see Poltl having an easy time with that challenge.

Gradey Dick Over 2.5 Three Pointers -135

Gradey Dick has been taking a solid number of three-point shots. He has averaged 7.2 attempts per game and made 2.6 of them, putting his shooting percentage at about 35.4%. His efficiency from beyond the arc is in line with his role as a perimeter shooter for the Toronto Raptors.

Gradey Dick is coming off not scoring one three-pointer in his last game against the Kings but I think this is a perfect spot for him to bounce back. The Clippers are allowing 13.6 three-pointers per game to opposition which is the 10th most in the league. Like I said earlier this Clippers defense will be heavily focused on RJ Barrett which will open things up for guys like Dick.
