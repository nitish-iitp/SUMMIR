Game 7: Nov 4, 2024

San Antonio Spurs at LA Clippers

Final Score: SA 104 – LAC 113


In a game where the Clippers found themselves down by 26 points against a scrappy young Spurs team, the Clippers were able to rally back and win the game. The comeback was led by Norman Powell who finished with 23 points. Amir Coffey was the key contributor off the bench with 21 points on 8/10 shooting from the field. Victor Wembanyama had 9 blocks in the game, but Ivica Zubac still ended up with 17 points and 13 rebounds.

 
Game 8: Nov 6, 2024

Philadelphia 76ers at LA Clippers

Final Score: PHI 98 – LAC 110


Paul George first returned to Los Angeles after leaving the Clippers in the summer for the Philadelphia 76ers. He was looking for some revenge, but the Clippers were able to spoil the return. The game continued to go back and forth until the Clippers were able to pull away late in the 3rd quarter and extending their lead to double digits. Norman Powell, who’s been the Clippers best scorer all year finished with 26 points on 8/10 and 6/8 from 3-point land. 

 

Game 9: Nov 8, 2024

LA Clippers at Sacramento Kings

Final Score: LAC 107 – SAC 98

 

The Clippers defense held the Kings to a woeful 3/26 shooting from 3. The Clippers were able to shoot 14/30 from 3. Despite 31 points from De’Aaron Fox, Norman Powell matched that with 31 points of his own and had 12 rebounds to go along with it. James Harden didn’t have a great shooting night but still ended up with 22 points, 4 rebounds, and 8 assists. 

 

Game 10: Nov 9, 2024

Toronto Raptors at LA Clippers

Final Score: TOR 103 – LAC 105

 

In another tight, close game against a feisty Raptors team, the Clippers were able to squeak out with a narrow win. Raptors center Jakob Poltl had an opportunity to send the game to overtime after an intentionally missed free throw but couldn’t get it to go. James Harden and Norman Powell both scored 24 points. Kevin Porter Jr had his best game of the season off the bench with 15 points and 5 assists. This game marked the Clippers 4th straight win.
