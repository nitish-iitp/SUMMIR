Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best choices on Saturday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Anthony Davis (LAL, C)	$21,680	57.5	2.7
Value	Jared McCain (PHI, PG/SG)	$6,980	21.7	3.1
Fade	James Harden (LAC, PG)	$19,350	39.3	2
Cheapie	Malik Monk (SAC, PG/SG)	$9,340	26.3	2.8

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Late Saturday teams, consider starting with a value player like Jared McCain. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Anthony Davis is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Malik Monk.

On the other hand, according to our model, James Harden is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if entering multiple line-ups.
