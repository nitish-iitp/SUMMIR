Milwaukee Bucks vs Dallas Mavericks game recap

The Milwaukee Bucks had a more balanced offense to start this matchup, while the Mavericks relied on their second-best player to make this a close game, at least in the beginning.

Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson ran the show for the Mavericks, scoring 14 and 11 points, respectively, to lead their team to victory. Daniel Gafford added 11 units too. On the other side, Gary Trent Jr. was the Bucks' best scorer with 12 points while Anzejs Pasecniks contributed 11 points.

The Mavericks dominated the second quarter with a 33-16 win, taking a 16-point advantage over the Bucks. Irving only added two points to his account, but with Klay Thompson joining the party with 11 units, it wasn't necessary for him to go off again.

Both Doc Rivers and Jason Kidd decided to give more chances to other players on the roster, adding new faces to the game in the third quarter. The Bucks couldn't do much outside of Pasecniks.

On the other end, Jazian Gortman and Brandon Williams said present with 11 and eight points, respectively, to extend the Mavericks lead by nine points. The fourth quarter was more of the same, with the Mavericks managing their advantage and exchanging buckets with the Bucks, who couldn't do much to cut the lead.

The Texans won their first and only game of the preseason 109-84 while Milwaukee finished the preseason with a 1-3 record.
