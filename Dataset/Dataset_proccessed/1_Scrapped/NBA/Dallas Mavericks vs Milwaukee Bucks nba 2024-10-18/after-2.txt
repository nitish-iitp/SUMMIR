Damian Lillard's availability against the Mavericks (Image credits: Imagn)

Damian Lillard and the Milwaukee Bucks are set to play their final preseason game on Thursday against the Dallas Mavericks. However, the Bucks are without the star point guard and some key contributors tonight. The team will play with the bench unit to prepare them for the start of the 2024-25 NBA season.

According to the Bucks, Lillard will sit down tonight against the Mavs to get his rest. He is not the only key player to sit on the sidelines, as All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, veteran center Brook Lopez and big man Bobby Portis Jr. will get their rest.

Star swingman Khris Middleton will not play tonight as he continues to deal with his ankle issues.

Lillard played three games this preseason. The team has been cautious with his minutes and has only allowed him to play over 20 minutes once.

The Mavs, on the other hand, won't have a few key players as well. Luka Doncic won't play their preseason finale, as he has just recovered from his calf issues. Maxi Kleber, Kessler Edwards and Danté Exum will not play tonight's game against the Bucks, according to the Mavericks reporter Grant Afseth.

Klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving will play tonight but will sit out the rest of the fourth period.

Last season was "a blur" to Damian Lillard

Last season was the first time Damian Lillard played an entire campaign for the Bucks. There were many expectations from the fans as they wanted him to be the reason the team started to contend again. However, injuries took over during the postseason, which caused them to be eliminated in the first round for a second straight season.

During his media day availability for the 2024-25 campaign, Lillard said:

"I just think it was, like I said, it was just such a blur. When the season was happening, I didn't even realize it as it was happening. I knew I had things going on. It was a hard year."
"But it took for me to be removed for it and kind of deep into the summer to be like, man, that was just a crazy year, but I just kept pushing through it because that's naturally what I do in my life, you know, even outside of basketball. But I think just gaining perspective too and just being around some of my mentors and my dad and other father figures too."

The expectations from Lillard haven't changed. In his second season with the Bucks, they are expected to become one of the top teams in the league.
