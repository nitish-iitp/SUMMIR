Mavericks guard Luka Doncic is, no doubt, a basketball superstar.

According to ESPN, however, he still isn’t the basketball superstar.

ESPN recently dropped their yearly rankings of the NBA’s top 100 players (we know where fellow Mavericks Klay Thompson and Derrick Lively landed) and finished off their top 10 by ranking Doncic as the second-best player in all of the NBA. He finished behind Nuggets’ center Nikola Jokic in the top spot. Doncic is up two spots from his No. 4 ranking last season.

Doncic and the Mavericks are coming off Dallas’ first Finals appearance since 2011 as they tip off the 2024 season, with Doncic having won his first scoring title at 33.9 points per game. Jokic, though the Nuggets were ousted in the second round of the playoffs last season, won his third MVP in four seasons while averaging 26.4 points and 12.4 rebounds per game.

Here’s the reasoning ESPN’s Tim McMahon gave behind bumping Doncic up two spots, but still not giving him the title of the best player in the NBA.

— “He answered any questions about whether his astounding production could truly drive winning by leading the sixth-seeded Mavericks to the 2024 NBA Finals while becoming the first player in league history to lead a single postseason in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals. Doncic also showed dramatic improvement on defense for a team that had the league’s stingiest unit on that end of the floor for the final quarter of the season.”

— “There are two major questions for Doncic: Will this be the season that he breaks through to win his first MVP? And can he push the Mavs over the finish line for his first NBA championship?”

— “There is no doubt that Doncic will have an MVP-caliber season, barring injury, and the Mavs’ offense, featuring Thompson as a floor-stretching complement to Doncic and Kyrie Irving, should be at the top of the league. The challenges will be figuring out how to piece together a quality defense, likely a necessity for Doncic on top of Dallas making another deep playoff run, in order to land atop MVP ballots.”

ESPN also had Doncic’s backcourt-mate Irving ranked at No. 25 on the list, up nine spots from No. 34 last season.

Irving, who averaged 25.6 points and 5.2 assists in 58 games last season, drew praise for his fit with Doncic and the leadership role he’s grown into in Dallas.

MacMahon: “There has never been any doubt about Irving’s extraordinary skill level, but last year he slid to 34th on this list because of questions about his availability and ability to impact winning. He responded by becoming a driving force in the Mavs’ run to the Finals alongside Luka Doncic, as the pair proved to be a phenomenal fit together. They formed the league’s highest-scoring duo, with Irving contributing 25.7 points per game on 60.8% true shooting while emerging as the Mavs’ emotional leader.”
