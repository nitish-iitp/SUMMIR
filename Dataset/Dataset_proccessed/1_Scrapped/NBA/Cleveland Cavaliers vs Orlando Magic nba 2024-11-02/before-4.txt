Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best picks on Saturday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Nikola Jokić (DEN, C)	$22,800	63.6	2.8
Value	Toumani Camara (POR, SF/PF)	$7,230	25.2	3.5
Fade	Tre Mann (CHA, SG/PG)	$11,290	21.7	1.9
Cheapie	Luke Kornet (BOS, C)	$6,000	19.9	3.3

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your NBA Saturday teams, consider starting with a value player like Toumani Camara. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Nikola Jokić is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Luke Kornet.

On the other hand, according to our model, Tre Mann is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building out multiple line-ups.
