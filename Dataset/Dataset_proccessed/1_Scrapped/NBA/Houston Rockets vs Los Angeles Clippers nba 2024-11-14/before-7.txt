Reed Sheppard was one of the most impressive rookies during the 2024 NBA Summer League. Sheppard was the No. 3 pick of this year's draft, but wasn't expected to break into the team's rotation early in the season. How did the Houston Rockets rookie perform on Monday night against the Washington Wizards?

Sheppard finished the game with seven points, a rebound and a steal in almost 17 minutes. He provided instant offense when he came into the game in the first quarter and early in the second period. However, he barely played in the second half.

Alperen Sengun led the way for the Rockets with 27 points, 17 rebounds, three assists and three blocks. Jalen Green had 18 points, four rebounds and two steals, while Amen Thompson had 13 points, eight rebounds, four steals and four blocks filling in for Fred VanVleet.

How did Reed Sheppard perform tonight against the Washington Wizards?

Reed Sheppard is averaging 3.4 points, 1.3 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game this season. Coach Ime Udoka only plays him 11.5 minutes per game, and he has not made a huge impact for the Rockets. His season high is seven points against the New York Knicks on Nov. 4.

Sheppard entered the game halfway through the first quarter with the Rockets leading 15-12. He made back-to-back buckets at the three-minute mark to give Houston a more comfortable lead. It was a good sign since the rookie already scored more than his season average.

Udoka didn't sub out Sheppard until the midway point of the second quarter. The Rockets were without Fred VanVleet, so they had to rely on the rookie as the backup guard. He hit a transition 3 early in the period to give Houston the momentum needed to take control of the game.

In the third quarter, Reed Sheppard returned to the court with four minutes left. He gave Jabari Smith Jr. a breather as the Houston Rockets went small with a 12-point lead. He didn't score in the quarter, but did get a steal and almost had an alley-oop pass to Tari Eason.

The game was a closer in the fourth quarter, so Sheppard didn't start the period. He re-entered with two minutes left in the game after the Rockets had a huge run to earn a 20-point lead. The rookie didn't do anything during garbage time as Houston got the 107-92 victory.

The Rockets improved to 7-4, which is tied for fifth place in a loaded Western Conference. The Wizards, on the other hand, dropped to 2-7 and have lost five in a row.

What's next for the Houston Rockets?

The Rockets continue their three-game homestand on Wednesday when they host the LA Clippers at Toyota Center. They then begin their quest to win the NBA Cup on Friday against the Clippers again. A young team like Houston could benefit from the higher-stakes game in the NBA In-Season Tournament.
