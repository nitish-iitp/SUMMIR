The Washington Wizards are hosting the Detroit Pistons Sunday night. Here’s the preview.

Game Info

When: Sunday, Nov. 17 at 6 p.m. EST

Where: Capital One Arena

How to watch: Monumental Sports Network, NBA League Pass (if out of market)

Injuries

Wizards — Malcolm Brogdon (thumb) and Saddiq Bey (knee) are both OUT.

Pistons — Ausar Thompson (illness), Bobi Klintman (calf), Simone Fontecchio (toe) and Tim Hardaway Jr. (head) are all game-time decisions.

Game notes
The Pistons are a much-improved squad from the one that lost 28 straight games last season. They’re already almost halfway to their win total from 2023-24.
The Wizards have lost seven straight games and have yet to win one against a team other than the Atlanta Hawks.
Bilal Coulibaly is having a fantastic start to the season, although he’s been somewhat less effective since Kyle Kuzma returned. Expect some bounce back games from him.
