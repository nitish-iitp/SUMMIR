The Cleveland Cavaliers play host to the Charlotte Hornets at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Sunday. Here’s a Charlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers Prediction. This article will include a Charlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers Pick.
Charlotte Hornets 
The Charlotte Hornets have been in decent form as they've won three of their past five games overall and they will be full of confidence following their 115-114 home win over the Bucks last night. LaMelo Ball led the team with 26 points, nine rebounds, and six assists, Miles Bridges added 19 points with seven rebounds and three assists while Josh Green chipped in with 15 points and five assists. As a team, the Hornets shot 44 percent from the field and 15 of 42 from the 3-point line as they withstood an early barrage from the Bucks and trailed for most of the contest before they snatched the game thanks to Ball who drained the game-winning free throws with just 7.1 seconds left on the clock. The Hornets will play against the Nets following this one.
Cleveland Cavaliers 
Meanwhile, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been on fire as they are now going for a 15th straight win after making light work of the Bulls in a 144-126 home win on Friday. Donovan Mitchell led the team with 37 points, seven rebounds, and four assists, Darius Garland added 29 points with nine assists, Jarrett Allen tallied 24 points with 10 rebounds and two blocks while Caris LeVert chipped in with 22 points and eight assists off the bench. As a team, the Cavaliers shot 54 percent from the field and an efficient 21 of 43 from the 3-point line as they set the tone with 49 points in the first quarter to take an early double-digit lead, but they allowed the Bulls back into the contest and needed another 37-point flurry in the fourth quarter to win comfortably in the end. 
Why the Cleveland Cavaliers will win
The Cavaliers have won each of their last 11 night games against teams that held a losing record.
The Hornets have lost each of their last eight road games against Eastern Conference opponents after winning as underdogs.
The Hornets have failed to cover the spread in eight of their last nine games as road underdogs against Central Division opponents.
The Cavaliers have covered the spread in five of their last six games as favorites against Southeast Division opponents.
Total Points Facts
Each of the Hornets' last six night games against Eastern Conference opponents has gone UNDER the total points line.
Each of the Cavaliers' last six Sunday games has gone OVER the total points line.
Charlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers Prediction
The Hornets don't have a single player listed on the injury report, while the Cavaliers are still missing Max Strus and they have decided to rest Donovan Mitchell for this one. I am sure that it doesn't surprise anyone that the Cavaliers have opened as heavy favorites at home given that they're still undefeated, but they're going to be missing Mitchell, the spearhead of their attack. Most likely, the Cavaliers still get the win with ease at home, but the Hornets have been playing better than their record suggests and they might be able to make this one interesting late in the game.
