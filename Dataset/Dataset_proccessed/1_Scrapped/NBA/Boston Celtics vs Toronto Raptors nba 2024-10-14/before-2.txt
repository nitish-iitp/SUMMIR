Two-time defending national champion UConn takes on Rhode Island in a charity exhibition at Mohegan Sun Arena on Monday.

The Huskies are looking to become just the second team to win three straight NCAA tournaments, joining the UCLA dynasty that won seven in a row from 1967-73. The Rams, meanwhile, haven’t reached the NCAA tournament since 2018.

UConn brought back coach Dan Hurley on a six-year, $50 million extension after Hurley had a brief flirtation with the NBA’s Los Angeles Lakers. Four starters are gone from last year’s team, with sharpshooter Alex Karaban the lone returner. But several key reserves are back, led by Hassan Diarra and Liam McNeeley. Transfers include Aidan Mahaney (Saint Mary’s), Tarris Reed Jr. (Michigan) and Isaiah Abraham (Virginia).

Rhode Island finished 12-20 in its second season under coach Archie Miller and are 21-42 in his two years. The Rams added transfers Sebastian Thomas (UAlbany), Quentin Diboundje (East Carolina), Jamarques Lawrence (Nebraska), Javonte Brown (Western Michigan) and Drissa Traore (St. John’s). Senior guard Jaden House is a key returner.
