Kings vs. Raptors Preview: Streaking in the Park
On the second night of a back to back, the Sacramento Kings are rolling into Toronto on Vince Carter's jersey retirement night!

Winners of three straight, The Sacramento Kings are in Toronto this evening to take on a Raptors squad that is riddled with injuries, and young inexperience players to boot. Gone are the Van Vleets and Siakams, the Kyle Lowrys and Kawhis, and in their place: youth. Endless, boundless youth. Well, and somehow, Garrett Temple. With Scottie Barnes, Immanuel Quickley and Bruce Brown injured, and RJ Barrett just off the injured list, Toronto is playing short manned, inexperienced and somewhat limpy basketball… and if the Jurrassic Park movies taught me anything: it’s that the young, stupid and hurt raptors were always the most dangerous.

Let’s talk Kings basketball.

When: Saturday, November 2nd, 4:30 PM PST
Where: Scotiabank Arena, Toronto, ON
TV: NBCSCA – Kyle Draper (play-by-play)
Radio: Sactown Sports 1140 AM

For Your Consideration

Day of the Dead (Narratives): Slowly but surely the Kings are finding their footing, and find new ways to pull out wins against teams that would have surely had their number in years past. Last night against the Hawks was a prime example: after controlling most of the game and going up big, they let the Hawks drag their way back into a tied game with less than half of the fourth remaining. In years past, the Kings fold like wet cardboard. In years past Garrison Mathews gets to be a hero for the night and a villain for years to come in the back of our collective brain, stuck with the pantheon of so many other random Kings killers. Instead, the Kings went pretty calmly down the court, rattled of eight straight and the momentum was killed right there in its tracks. The game got closer again, sure, but the win never felt like it was slipping away. Even with Sabonis fouling out, that anxiety tingle down the spine of “oh geez, they’re really gonna lose this thing” never rattled down my spine. Attribute that to DeMar DeRozan’s calming presence, attribute that to the Kings having six incredible weapons at their disposal for instant offense… there’s nothing like gaining back a little confidence from the fans by rattling off three straight against lesser teams.

And now on to tonight: as previously mentioned, the Raptors reboot is casting all youngings today, folks. Sure, they’ve got a Garrett Temple and Kelly Olynyk on the shelves, but we’re looking at a squad that, even when healthy, is trotting out ten guys with five seasons or less on NBA experience. Their most consistent player through six games is Gradey Dick, who went from a horrendous rookie season LAST YEAR to averaging a hair under 21 points per game to start this season. Now, mind you, RJ Barrett has come out fame throwing in his three games back from injury, averaging 28 points, 7.7 assists and shooting nearly 53% from deep on almost six attempts per night… so, that development might change the calculus for Gradey a bit. But still, even RJ is just barely an established vet in my mind. If you’re sweating over former King Davion Mitchell and the season he’s had to start with Immanuel Quickley being injured, he’s doing Davion things I think. 8.8 points, 6.0 assists, .5 steals and .7 blocks per game. Certainly not the defensive player of the year radio hosts were heralding him as before his rookie season in Sacramento, but at six games into your career as a starter, hey, who is.

Overall, this team feels like another, too young and too dumb to know they should lose, and I mean that as a compliment. They attempt fewer threes than anyone in the league are fourth worst in the NBA at hitting them, averaging just 31.5% from deep as a squad. But, their third in the NBA in offensive rebounding, second in the NBA in assists and third in the NBA in blocks, which tells me they’re getting AFTER it on both ends, just can’t quite execute yet. To further back that up is that they’re third in the league in turning the ball over and foul the second most in the NBA, so they’re a little too eager to make plays and haven’t honed in yet on the ol’ discipline aspect of things. The Raptors won’t be a tough out, right up until the point that the Kings decide they are.

The Small Stuff

Baby Dinos: Saw someone point this out on Twitter last night: if you combined all ten of the players the Raptors used against the Los Angeles Lakers last night and combined all of their regular season and playoffs together, LeBron James singularly outpaces them by thirty or so games. This isn’t a surprise compliment to a Laker in a Raptors preview, this is a testament to the youth movement that the Raptors are finally all in on, and to how many injuries the Raptors have had to their vets as the follow-up, more bummer-y way of looking at things.

Vinsane in the Membrane: Man, I know that Vince played for a multitude of teams in the waning years of his career and that his one season in Sacramento wasn’t the type of success he deserved in the twilight of a Hall of Fame run, but I am legitimately so happy the powers that be picked the Kings to be the team to be in the arena for his jersey getting retired. Even being 40 and hobbled and far too good for a franchise like the Kings were at that point, he was a constant bright spot as a view and he’s easily my favorite one-season wonder in regards to Kings players. I hope its emotional, I hope the Toronto crowd goes bezerk and I hope the Kings crush the ever loving piss out of the Raptors before Fox and him get a chance to catch up on camera after the final buzzer sounds. I’m glad Toronto was able to come together to do this, despite a rather rocky split so many years ago. The icon and the city both deserve this.

Prediction

Gradey Dick is the leading scorer for Toronto tonight and way too many jokes are made at his expense on Twitter. Davion Mitchell plays some hard nose defense and makes a nice heads-up offensive play or two, but Fox thoroughly owns the match up throughout the night. Jonathan Mogbo gives Keegan and Domas a headache down in the post but the Kings fight off the scrappy Raptors (scraptors?) in fourth.

I live in TO and lucky to be going to this game tonight! The tix were crazy expensive, like $415 CAD for further back lower bowl seats. Should be an awesome game, was always a big Vince fan and still am!

He is going to excel at bringing the ball up court and passing it to another player, then doing nothing else during the possession. Elite!

According to my sources, if at any time both Davion and Keon are on the court together, no points will be scored. The NBA is trying to prevent the coaches from attempting this by threatening fines and suspensions.

Keegan Murray might get himself benched in this fantasy scenario with his impressive D. Though crashing the glass and scoring is exciting, so the league just might let it slide.

22/50 from 3pt range tonight for the Raptors. But they still aren’t good enough to beat the Kings.

The matchup I’m interested in watching tonight is Sabonis vs. Poeltl. Although Sabonis has won the career matchups and keeps Poeltl in check, Jakob has held Sabonis below is averages.

Domas dominated their last meetup back in January. He put up 24, 15, and 11. to Jakob’s 14, 6, and 2. Let’s hope that trend continues.

Poeltl has had good defensive games against Domas.

Two close losses against what so far appear to be good teams, three wins against teams they should beat. They’ll likely be a bit tired tonight after those minutes last night, but they should still be able beat a terrible team like Toronto, and are clearly the better team than Miami right now. Would be nice to make a statement by sweeping this road trip.

Toronto is also on a B2B. No excuses. If they wanted rest they should have stood on the Hawks’ necks early in the third quarter.

Next 8 games for the Kings:

@ TOR
@ MIA
v. TOR
v. LAC
@ PHX
@ SA
v. PHX
v. MIN

To me, that’s a soft six game schedule (minus PHX) before it tightens up for the last couple. Kings don’t want to be floating around .500 before hosting the Suns and Wolves. Which means at 3-2, they probably want to go at least 4-2 to take a 7-4 record back home. Leave one of those losses for Phoenix, and that means between SA, TORx2, MIA, and LAC, you got one loss to spare.

TOR is bad and missing its best players, they’re on a SEGABABA tonight at home and then come to play in Sacramento – gotta win both of these games. Then you gotta go 2/3 against Wemby, Jimmy Buckets, and Harden & Friends. Doable, but not guaranteed.

In other words, if Kings don’t wanna put themselves behind the 8 ball, they GOTTA take care of business tonight on tired legs after sitting through customs. Nobody said NBA basketball was easy – LET’S GO KINGS! LTB!

6-2 with losses to Miami and Phoenix, that’s my prediction/expectation.

I have not visited Toronto this year, but I have been in November. Let’s see if that keeps the streak alive.

Also shameless unrelated plug, Toronto is criminally underrated and should be on everyone’s travel list.

I visited Toronto in mid-September this year. Really nice place to visit. We also took a day trip to Niagara Falls.

I never liked peak Vince. I always thought that he was more interested in creating highlights than doing the little things necessary to win (like defend).

I absolutely loved late career Vince. Just seeing his passion for the game and not caring about being way past his peak and embracing a role as a veteran and keep playing. Kudo’s to the man.

Does anyone else find it interesting that the NBA still classifies illnesses as COVID or non-COVID illnesses? Thought the world moved past that by now.

Be interested to see if they go with Keon starting, or if Brown sticks to his usual routine of starting a 3rd or 4th string guy so the bench rotation stays the same.

It honestly wouldn’t surprise me one bit if McBuckets got the start in Huerter’s role in order to maintain the current rotation, beginning with Monk and Ellis coming off the bench together.

That’s interesting. My guess is Keon starts and McLaughlin plays the Keon minutes.

Time to see if Keon can hit a few shots. Obviously he doesn’t have to score a ton, but as the recap mentioned, if he could just be less hesitant when shooting it would help.

It would make sense to put the man2man defender on 2nd leading scorer SG and Keegan on their leading scorer Wing.

Keegan can be all over their Barrett and Keon can put the clamps on their Dick. That should make their offense flaccid. As for their starting PG, apparently the injury update states it is Quickly’s pelvis that makes him limp. With defensive pressure on that group, I expect they will only score in spurts, if at all.

I have the levity level of a 6th grader.

Not sure why Toronto is retiring half-man half-quitter’s jersey. The way he forced his way out by straight up quitting on the team before magically finding the fountain of youth in New Jersey was disgraceful.

I guess time heals all wounds but no way I’d want his jersey retired if I was a Raptors fan.

I think retiring his jersey makes sense. With all due respect and love for Damon Stoudamire, Carter put the Raptors on the map in the national consciousness.

However, I’m surprised he is their first jersey they are retiring. I think they should’ve waited a bit longer to retire Carter, so they could wait and have Lowry be the first one retired. Given what Lowry meant to them, it would have made more sense to me.

Agreed. 9 seasons, 6 all-star appearances, and and NBA title beats anything that Carter did for the Raps.

Big ball of truth, right here:

The Raptors won’t be a tough out, right up until the point that the Kings decide they are.

This is, even more than against ATL, a take care of business game for Sacramento.

Revenge game worries? That’ll be on the Northern cousins side with DeMar DeRozan. I expect him to spread some Mid Game Love all over the Maple Leafers.

Roster construction-wise – Masai Ujiri (President of Ops) and Bobby Webster (GM) ditched all of their expensive contracts of former high level players and are paying Quickley ($32.5M), Rj Barrett ($26M), Bruce Brown ($23M) and Jakob Poetl ($19M) that $100M on those 4 – I am just a no nothing fan – but I don’t see an emerging high level team (yes – Scottie Barnes and Grady Dick are up and comers still on rookie deals) for that amount of scratch.

It’s a 3 Point League:
Will addressed this nicely. Dinos are 29th in 3PM, 27th in 3FG% yet 9th in scoring, just behind Sacramento. How’s that? Well, fhey make 4 FG more a game than the Kings. (Kings also make 2 more FT/game and 2.4 3PM- somehow it adds up- Toronto can score the ball).

Light that beam! Go Kings!
