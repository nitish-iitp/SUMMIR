Anthony Edwards is attempting over 13 threes per game. Is this a winning formula?

He’s making them at the moment, shooting over 41% from three. Basically he’s shooting the three ball like he’s Steph Curry right now. Averaging 30 ppg.

And yet, his PER is a measly 16.9. To me, Ant is probably the most dangerous driver of the basketball in the NBA and I don’t believe he’s the next Steph Curry (ie: over 10 three point attempts per game while shooting over 40%). Is he fostering bad habits that won’t work when his three ball comes back to reality, and arguably isn’t even working right now?

Curious to hear from Wolves fans. Would you like to see him attack the rim a bit more and shoot the three a bit less or are you happy with his current shot selection?

I was actually thinking this. Ant is one of the best, freakiest athletes in the league right now, no question, I don't know if 65% of his shots being 3s is that great, because, I mean sign Seth Curry and he can do that for you, Ant is capable of far more than just chucking. Obviously there is more to it, his burst and talent allows him create a better 3 point shot than some of those stiff would, but he should be more aggressive is what I am saying, shooting 3 is the easy way out.

I think in the next five years, several players will be shooting Steph-like volumes of threes.

While he's shooting at this kind of percentage I say fire away, but I agree if it comes back down to earth some he should (and is obviously capable) start taking less 3's and really attacking the paint.

Absolutely winning formula. Just look at the Celtics and Warriors. Soon it will be illegal to do dunks, layups, and mid range shots. He's ahead of the curve.

Remember too that the Wolves are trying to adjust their offense on the fly. Julius Randle is no KAT (although he’s miraculously shooting 62.5% on 4 3PA!), so Ant’s 10 3PA might not stick. But with Gobert and Randle closer to the basket, it’s crowded underneath, so I expect a rise in his traditional 3PA’s (7.5 3PA for his career). Lastly, he said at the Olympics the two biggest things he focused on was LeBron’s prep and Curry’s shot mechanics. I guess we’ll see.

Bleh assists. Lots of turnovers. Shooting horrendously at the foul line (64%). Draw rate is down. Not that surprising. He isn't even killing it insanely on efficiency, either. He was also 7/13 in his last game, which was much better than any of his first 3 games and is heavily influencing that percentage. HE was shooting 37.5% from 3 over the first 3.

That’s why they play the games. His percentage is his percentage.

I like it. Its a more efficient style and he still drives when needed.

We watch every season what happens to that sort of 3pt shooting over a whole playoff series, though. Eventually, guys will start to learn, I suspect.

Then the drive will be even more open.

Ant’s method change is intentional.

Based on the playoffs last year, that's not really his plan.

I think Edwards is a bit overrated as an athlete. He’s fast and springy, but he’s not a physical freak like Dwayne Wade. He still has to score from the perimeter like most 6’4 guards.

Maybe the nba should restrict the number of threes each team can take. Like MLB did with the shift. Sometimes “big government” has to step in if the product suffers.

Is spamming the 3 early on akin to a jab in boxing ? Get them thinking about that, opponents start to press up more rather than guard the drive...

16.9 PER is incredibly low for a guy of is caliber wow. Has there ever been a player who averaged 30ppg that had <20 PER?

Off the top of my head majority of the premier superstars that ever averaged 30+ all had over 25 PER.

Is it? If you use it to bait the defender in and then actually drive, sure. Waiting to see what Edwards does. It's early yet and he hasn't hit a harsh cold spell from 3 yet either. We'll see, I guess, but we definitely watch excessive 3pt volume become a problem if you don't showcase more than that in your skillset.

Yeah, for sure. Now Edwards certainly has the athleticism, so we'll have to see what he does.

I've reviewed a dusty old metric and I can say with certainty, that 50% of the time it works every time

It's probably a winning formula for an advanced stats perspective, but is it what we want to see as fans?

Imagine if Vince had been told to stop driving to the hoop and pull of for threes instead.... How many highlight plays would we have missed out on?

Imagine if Hakeem was told that his low post moves are cute and all, but coaching really want him to start bombing 10 threes a game because advance stats says that he'll score 1.3 points a game more that way. How many dream shakes would we have missed out on.

Or if Mutombo had just been roaming around the three as a switch defender, how many classic finger wags would we have missed?
