The heat is on Dwyane Wade.

The Miami Heat legend is speaking out after fans slammed a new statue of him that many feel does not look anything like him.

On Oct. 27, the Heat unveiled the statue of Wade outside the Kaseya Center. The statue features the three-time NBA champion making his “this is my house” gesture from a double overtime win over the Chicago Bulls in 2009.

“If I wanted it to look like me, I’d just stand outside the arena and y’all can take photos,” Wade said during an Oct. 28 press conference. “It don’t need to look like me. It’s the artistic version of a moment that happened that we’re trying to cement.”

“I care, but I don’t,” he added. “The social media world is about opinions. Everyone has an opinion. Everyone, use y’all opinions. Please, talk more about us. Talk more about a statue, come on down to see it, take some photos, send some memes. We don’t care.”

While there has been criticism of the statue, Wade marveled at being honored with the artwork.

“There’s only a few organizations that have statues outside. There’s not even 15 players that's played this game of basketball that have a statue outside. We have a statue outside,” Wade told fans during a halftime ceremony at the Heat’s game against the Detroit Pistons on Oct. 28.

“So, for me to be the vessel that’s used to be the chosen one, I’m proud of it. I’m proud because we worked very, very, very hard to create an image that will stand for a very long time that expresses what the Miami Heat, my family and our fan base is about.”

He also credited the job the sculptors did.

“I don’t know a lot of people with a statue. Do you? Anybody here, y’all know anything about the process of a statue? No one out there do neither,” he said during the press conference. “And so, it’s an unbelievable process to be a part of. And it’s a complicated process.”

Wade had previously said he’s responsible for the pose.

“Yeah, it was my idea. I feel that if you’re getting a moment like this, it has to be a moment that when someone thinks of you, it had to be a moment that represents that,” he told Craig Melvin in an interview that aired Oct. 28 on the 3rd hour of TODAY.

“If you go through the different statues, you look at Kobe walking off with the finger up, Shaq dunking, legs up, Jordan (mimics Jordan dunking pose), that’s the moment that represents him. And so my statue had to be a moment that when you think of me.”

The problem, though, is many fans don't think the artwork looks like Wade, and hopped on X after the unveiling to say so.

“They got Dwyane Wade looking like that one Mortal Kombat level,” one person joked.

“The Miami Heat should’ve had a contest where they showed this picture to 1,000 fans — and anyone who guesses it’s Dwyane Wade gets to keep the statue,” ESPN's Jeff Darlington quipped.

“The Dwyane Wade statue will haunt me until my dying day,” another person commented.

“Why does the Dwyane Wade statue look like Beach Frasier?” film critic Richard Roeper wrote, pointing out how it’s similar to Kelsey Grammer.

While the reaction hasn’t exactly been positive, Wade is ecstatic that the team honored him with a statue and said it’s hard to soak in the moment.

“It doesn’t get measured,” he said on the 3rd hour of TODAY. “Hall of Fame: OK, it’s a couple hundred that's made the Hall of Fame. But when you get here, you get the statue talk, that number gets really, really low. And I don’t even know if I have the right emotions for it.”

The game that inspired the statue still lives on for Wade, who explained what he remembers from it.

“Feelin’ on top of the world (laughs) and my expression, what came out my mouth, I meant everything I was saying. It was one of the best moments of my NBA career,” he said.
