Wolves vs Besiktas: Analysis and Prediction – Wolves will host Besiktas in the EuroCup Round 6 game.

Wolves Team News

Wolves have played 11 games this season, six in Lithuania’s national league and five in the EuroCup, winning a total of five games—three in the domestic league and two in the EuroCup. In their latest game, they defeated Zalgiris in the national league.

In that game against zalgiris, Wolves looked like a well-oiled machine, delivering their best performance of the season without a doubt. It will be interesting to see how this game impacts their confidence and overall play moving forward, as they’ve been relatively unconvincing so far, not excelling in any particular area. Wolves have a fairly experienced team, and we believe they will improve over the course of the season, especially given the challenge of replacing two key players, Arturs Zagars and Rasheed Sulaimon. Anthony Andrews is expected to lead the team offensively, as he has the experience and skill to perform at this level of basketball. However, his performance has been inconsistent so far this season. The same can be said for Anthony Cowan, the team’s top scorer, who has struggled with his three-point shooting.

Now they face an in-form team that’s on the rise and poses a significant challenge. For Wolves to overcome Besiktas, they will need to deliver another near-perfect offensive performance.

Besiktas Team News

After struggling at the start of the season, Besiktas is now finding their rhythm in recent weeks. They are currently on a five-game winning streak, with their latest victory in the Turkish Super League, where they defeated Pinar Karsiyaka at home. Prior to that, they won against Joventut in the EuroCup, also on their home court.

It seems that head coach Dusan Alimpijevic is gradually finding a way to reach his players, getting them to execute his vision. Throughout his coaching career, Alimpijevic has been known for his teams’ aggressive, high-quality defense, though this wasn’t initially the case with Besiktas at the start of the season. However, as time goes on, their defense has improved, although it’s their surprisingly effective offense that has been the standout element early in the season. At the moment, Besiktas ranks among the top three offenses in the EuroCup, an unexpected development for many at the season’s outset. Some defensive issues have arisen due to Emanuel Terry’s inability to handle all the responsibilities that Angel Delgado managed, as they are two very different types of players. The offense, led by Derek Needham—who tops the team in assists—ensures that each player gets ample scoring opportunities. A significant strength of Besiktas is their balanced roster, with seven players averaging between 9.2 and 12 points per game, making it difficult for opponents to focus on only one or two threats. The team’s cohesion is evident from the fact that no Besiktas player has a usage rate exceeding 18.5%.

Besiktas is clearly on the rise, but so is their opponent. Where Besiktas could have the edge is in rebounding, as Wolves are one of the weakest rebounding teams in the EuroCup.

Wolves vs Besiktas H2H

Last season, both teams won their respective games on home court.

Absences and Injuries

Jeffrey Taylor missed the last game for Wolves, while Jonah Mathews was absent in Besiktas’s most recent domestic league match. It remains to be seen if Matthews will be ready for this matchup.

Wolves vs Besiktas Prediction

Although both teams are currently improving, we have more confidence in the visitors from Turkey. Besiktas has a stronger roster with more quality players, and their game is far less dependent on the performance of a single player compared to the home team. Additionally, the visitors are better equipped to play solid defense, so our expectation is that Besiktas will secure the win.
