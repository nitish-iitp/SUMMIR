Jaylen Brown reflects on ‘amazing' Abu Dhabi experience with Celtics
By Nick Goss

Exclusive with Jaylen Brown to discuss a memorable experience in Abu Dhabi and how JB wants to continue to grow as an “ambassador for the sport” around the world.

The Boston Celtics and Denver Nuggets helped grow the sport of basketball and the NBA brand in Abu Dhabi this week by playing two preseason games and taking part in several events.

Jaylen Brown helped lead the charge in those efforts, and he put on a show Sunday in the second of the two preseason matchups.

The reigning NBA Finals MVP led all scorers with 21 points on 8-of-16 shooting, along with three assists and one rebound in 23 minutes as Boston cruised to an impressive 130-104 win at Etihad Arena.

Brown talked to NBC Sports Boston's Chris Forsberg postgame about what the experience in Abu Dhabi meant to him.

FINAL
By Nick Goss

Score: 130-104 Celtics

The Celtics went 2-0 in Abu Dhabi with another win over the Nuggets on Sunday. Jaylen Brown (21 points) and Jayson Tatum (17 points) led the way for the C's.

Boston's bench also played well. Sam Hauser scored 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting with eight rebounds. Payton Pritchard scored 14 points on 5-of-7 shooting with five assists.

Nikola Jokic scored 20 points with seven rebounds and three assists to lead the Nuggets. Denver went just 8-of-34 (23.5 percent) from 3-point range.

Neemias Queta making an impact
By Nick Goss

Score: 130-100 Celtics, 54.5 seconds left in fourth quarter

Neemias Queta has played very well in the two preseason games in Abu Dhabi. He has scored seven points with three rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block so far in this game.

Queta should get a decent amount of playing time early in the season with Kristaps Porzingis rehabbing a leg injury and the C's trying to manage Al Horford's minutes.

End of third quarter
By Nick Goss

Score: 109-76 Celtics

Jaylen Brown (21points) and Jayson Tatum (17 points) lead the Celtics in scoring through three quarters. The Jays are unlikely to play in the fourth quarter, which means the bench guys should get some valuable preseason reps.

The bench has already made an impact. Sam Hauser has 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting. Payton Pritchard has 14 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Boston has hit 42.9 percent (15-of-35) from 3-point land overall.

Nikola Jokic (20 points) is the only Nuggets player with more than 12 points. Denver is shooting 18.5 percent (5-of-27) from beyond the arc.

Pritchard picking up where he left off Friday
By Nick Goss

Payton Pritchard led the Celtics with 21 points and six assists in Friday's win, and he has given another strong performance Sunday. The Celtics point guard has scored 14 points (5-of-6 shooting) with five assists and two assists through three quarters.

He also completed a 4-point play in the third quarter when he hit a 3-pointer and got fouled.

By Nick Goss

Score: 91-68 Celtics, 6:04 left in third quarter

Payton Pritchard just hit his first 3-pointer of the game, giving him eight points in 10 minutes off the bench. The Celtics, as a team, are now up to 44.8 percent (13-of-29) from 3-point range. Seven different Celtics players have hit at least one 3-pointer. Jayson Tatum and Sam Hauser have both made three of them.

The Nuggets, meanwhile, are shooting 18.2 percent (4-of-18) from beyond the arc.

Jaylen Brown using his size to his advantage
By Nick Goss

Score: Celtics 65-58, 1:04 left in second quarter

Jaylen Brown looks like he bulked up a bit over the summer, and he used that strength to outmuscle Jamal Murray for a basket on the baseline in the second quarter. Brown leads the Celtics with 16 points.

Sam Hauser is heating up
By Nick Goss

Score: 46-38 Celtics, 8:14 left in second quarter

Sam Hauser already has eight points in the second quarter. He has hit two 3-pointers so far, along with an eight-foot two-point shot.

Hauser is one of the league's best 3-point shooters. He shot 42.4 percent on 3-pointers last season. The veteran forward also connected on an impressive 47.8 percent of his 3-point attempts against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals.

— Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) October 6, 2024

Boston shot 13-of-28 (46.4 percent) from the field and hit four of 13 attempts from beyond the arc. Neemias Queta was the only bench player to see playing time in the first quarter. We should see several others in the second quarter.

Nikola Jokic (11 points) and Jamal Murray (seven points) led the Nuggets through one quarter. The Celtics held the Nuggets to just 2-for-12 shooting from 3-point range.

By Nick Goss

Score: 13-10 Nuggets, 6:37 left in first quarter

Derrick White is in midseason form right now. He has five points, three rebounds and two assists in less than six minutes of action. A classic all-around performance from the veteran guard so far.
