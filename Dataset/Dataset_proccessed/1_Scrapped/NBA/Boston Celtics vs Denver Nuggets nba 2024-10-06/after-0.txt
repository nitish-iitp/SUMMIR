Key Moment

It’s only two games into the preseason, but the Boston Celtics are already back to their dominant ways. A 42-16 third-quarter advantage Sunday night gave Boston plenty of cushion to knock off the Denver Nuggets to wrap up a two-game miniseries sweep in Abu Dhabi.

Payton Pritchard helped to catalyze the win for the second straight game, leading the C’s on a 37-8 run after halftime. He made his first five shot attempts of the third quarter and finished the frame with 14 points and three assists. He was the only player to play the entire quarter, which meant he was plus-26 over a 12-minute stretch.

While Pritchard led the charge in scoring and facilitating, Sam Hauser set the tone on the glass. The veteran wing crashed the boards for eight rebounds over an eight-minute span during the third. Denver, meanwhile, had a total of eight rebounds for the entire frame.

In a matter of less than nine minutes, the Celtics went from being up six to being up 35, and they reached the 100-point mark with nearly five minutes remaining in the third quarter.  That one dominant frame was all they needed to cruise to a 130-104 win, wrapping up their international trip 2-0.
