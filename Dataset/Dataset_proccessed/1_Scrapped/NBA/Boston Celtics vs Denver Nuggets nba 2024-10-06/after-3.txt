Recap: Denver Nuggets lose laugher against Boston Celtics in Abu Dhabi

Jan 19, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) works for the ball against Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic (15), guard Jamal Murray (27) and guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (5) in the last seconds of the game at TD Garden.

The Denver Nuggets finished out their time overseas in Abu Dhabi with the second straight game against the Boston Celtics. The Nuggets elected to sit several veterans, including Michael Porter Jr and Aaron Gordon, and only gave Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray only one half of play. That ended up leading to a third quarter performance that was not only an insult to the game of basketball, but also entertainment in general. Boston separated in the second half behind Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Sam Hauser and never looked back. The Nuggets head home winless after falling to Boston 130-104.

The game began with both teams getting production from their guards. Murray scored seven of Denver’s first nine points while Derrick White scored the majority of Boston early points. Sans Gordon and Porter, Denver’s starting unit struggled with defensive rebounding but kept pace with the Celtics while Brown started to assert himself. The Nuggets offense stagnated a bit which let Boston build a small lead and Michael Malone took a timeout with just over four minutes to go. The first two players off the bench for Denver were Hunter Tyson and Zeke Nnaji, meanwhile Tatum led Boston’s offense while they maintained their lead. To close out the first Malone went with a lineup that didn’t feature a traditional point guard and naturally the offense looked a bit hesitant. After one Boston led 34-29.

Jalen Pickett joined the reserves plus Strawther to start the second quarter. Dario Saric made the most of finding some mismatches on offense but the Celtics still maintained a small lead. Denver’s defense started to get lax, the Celtics started dropping threes and Malone took a timeout with the Boston lead up to nine. Jokic and Murray checked back in to restore order, meanwhile Saric continued to play well. He got a rest as Denver started bringing the starters back in and Boston’s lead was back down to four. Sam Hauser was canning threes left and right though which prevented Denver from closing the gap entirely. The lead went back up to eight with the Nuggets struggling to score but Jokic was an unstoppable force and kept Denver within striking distance. They continued to play no defense though and that allowed Boston to maintain a lead near double digits. At the half it was Boston 67, Denver 60.

Jokic and Murray opened the second half on the bench, ending their run in Abu Dhabi, and Malone went with Strawther, Braun, Tyson, Vlatko Cancar and Saric. The Celtics still had most of their starters in (Jrue Holiday was out with Payton Pritchard in instead) to open the third. Denver looked pretty overmatched and Boston’s lead quickly moved to double digits. It got all the way up to 18 by the time Strawther made a nice and-1 drive to the basket (he didn’t convert the free throw). The Nuggets managed to score just eight points in the first half of the quarter and called a timeout once Boston’s lead was up to twenty-three. They came out of that TO, Pickett chucked a three (clank), Denver turned the ball over, Boston got an easy bucket and Malone called a rage timeout. It didn’t help. The lead kept growing, Denver stayed stuck on 68 points for several minutes and with four and half minutes left the Celtics had scored 101. Trey Alexander got in and finally scored some points. Malone started emptying out the bench with Spencer Jones and Jahmir Young joining Alexander on the floor. The third quarter came mercifully to an end with Denver trailing 76-109.

UPDATE: Got him started 🏹 pic.twitter.com/bvSvAN70k3

— Boston Celtics (@celtics) October 6, 2024

Both teams played full reserve groups to start the second half. Denver had Strawther, Tyson and Zeke Nnaji on the floor with Young and Alexander. They didn’t get off to a great start in the fourth and Malone used up his last timeout with about ten minutes still left in the game. Strawther and Young started attacking to give Nuggets fans at least a little something to cheer for. They led the bench group and kept pace with the Celtics bench group with Young in particular looking good (at least against NBA reserves). Alexander fed P.J. Hall for a nice transition oop towards the end of the quarter and the offense looked better but the defense was still questionable at best so the reserves never really cut into the massive lead Boston built in the third. The game finally ended with the Nuggets losing big, 130-104

Best matchup: Nikola Jokic vs Jaylen Brown

Jokic and Brown obviously didn’t play one on one vs each other much tonight but both looked the part of superstars on championship teams. Jokic looks like he is ready go right now and honestly if it weren’t for the uniqueness of his game and making sure everyone is comfortable playing off him there’d be no reason for him to play another minute this preseason. He clearly does not need the reps. Neither does Brown, he looks like a man primed to have the best season of his career. Jaylen has fully developed into a complete player, complementing his A+ defense with an offensive game that includes deadly outside shooting and the ability to get to the basket at will. There was a lot of garbage today, but Brown and Jokic had no part of it.

Main thing I noticed: It’s over for Jalen Pickett

It shouldn’t be a surprise at this point that the abysmal third quarter largely happened with Pickett playing the point. Unfortunately, there’s no reason to keep him on the roster anymore. The Nuggets will have the pay out his contract whether he’s on the roster or not and there’s plenty of evidence to show that he’s not only not good enough to be impactful against NBA rotation players, but he’s also not good enough to be impactful against guys who are going to spend their seasons in the G-League. You can’t say the same about Alexander and Young who certainly aren’t close to being ready for real rotation minutes, but at least show ability to score and be dynamic against reserves. Alexander is on the roster on a two-way but Young has nothing more than an exhibit 10 contract. I’d much rather have Alexander on a full NBA contract and Young occupying the two-way spot instead of continuing this sunk cost fallacy with Pickett.

This is why you don’t bet preseason games

Two of Denver’s starters didn’t play at all, two more played only a half, meanwhile Boston’s starters played well into the third. It’s impossible to account for that variance and so if you were looking at that 3.5 point spread pregame and thinking there was something to read into then you were hopefully humbled by the randomness of preseason basketball.

So here’s a general question. Is there anything a coach can learn about his team from playing a completely one-sided preseason game? I’m watching the Sixers play the New Zealand Breakers. Embiid and George haven’t even played, but they are currently winning the game by 55 pts in the 4th qtr. Literally everyone on the Sixers looks great. But it’s hard not to when the game is completely noncompetitive.

So what can a coach take out of a game like this? anything?

I know they’re fixated on KCP’s departure and the question about who’s going to fill that hole, and that’s the easy storyline for sure, but it is funny that they just refuse to acknowledge Saric’s existence or give him even a slight spare thought. If he can help us survive non-Jokic minutes then his addition is going to be a lot more impactful than whatever drop-off we experience from KCP to Braun.

The whole premise is the lack of shooting, but that’s not how the Nuggets have been built. Last year was MPJ’s worst shooting performance of his career. AG shot the worst he has since 2016-17 and basically stopped taking 3’s. Jokic was down from 22-23. Positive regression from those 3 is more important than losing RJ or Holiday. And two of the players who will pick up the slack (CB and Saric) shot it at the same 38% level as three departures cumulatively shot. Strawther is the wild card that… Read more »

MPJ played 81 games, shot 39.7% 3pt, with 220 3pt made, 32 more than his previous career high. And only 1% off his 41.0% 3pt career average.

Because Mike played 20 more games than he ever did before and shot 39.7% 3pt at high volume, it’s unfair to call it the worst shooting performance of his career. Considering his 81 games played, I think it’s one of his best shooting seasons. There is more to consider than just percentage.

But as far as your overall point, I partially agree. Hopefully players like Jokic and AG shoot 3pt better. Strawther shot well in college, but needs to prove it on the pro level. CB is a good low volume 3pt shooter. And Russ is 30.4% 3pt career. Murray was great 42.5% 3pt last season. The Nuggets can be a good 3pt shooting team, whether they will be, and it’s enough to win another chip, we hope so. Team 3pt is a concern, especially in the playoffs.

Discounting the 9 games he was playing injured in 21-22, MPJ came into last year shooting 42.7% for his career and his attempts per game were down from 22-23, despite playing career high minutes.

His availability was much better last season, but he was less effective as shooter. He was still really good, but I think there’s room for improvement.

I agree his 3pt% can be higher. And maybe 81 games is not the way to have the best Mike in the playoffs. He can rest occasionally. Having said that, playing 81 games is a huge accomplishment for a player with Mike’s injury history and physical issues.

Given MPJ focus on getting stronger and below the 3pt line along with no faith that CB will replace KCP as a shooter, I think the style of our guys will be attack the paint than sit on the 3pt line

That’s always been the case with Jokic. Last year, we had the fewest 3pa in the league, but were top 5 in offensive rating. This just isn’t a team built to be dependent on the 3 ball.

It’s interesting. Jamal’s always kind of been treated like Will Barton by Nugget fans/reporters. So much so, that he can have been 45% of the reason the Nuggets won a championship a year ago, had the best regular season of his career last season but played badly through injury in the playoffs, and is now a terrible player.

The psychoanalyzing of his psyche/attitude is new though, don’t know where that is from. I guess they are all in the same family.

OT: Dodger choke watch is the only reason I watch baseball (and I usually watch the game when it’s the bottom of the 9th with 2 outs). It’s fascinating with the Dodgers and how they dominate in the regular season and are so weak in the post season.

I was defending the Picket selection at the time but he’s clearly not third point guard material. We sure could use an Ish smith type of veteran on the roster.

I’m with you with Fultz (not sure he’s a fit but would be a talent upgrade), also there are a few unsigned FA that would be additions over the current roster:

Bottom line: 1. Jokic is going to absolutely dominate the league this season. Even though he won’t win the MVP he will have his best season. He’s huge, he looks mean, he has more inside moves than a congressman making stock trades, and he looks soooo comfortable with Jamal out there healthy. 2. Saric and Cancar will really help spell Jok. Big big additions. 3. Jamal will have a 70 game/22 points/7 assists season. He will earn his giant paycheck and again become the floor general the team feeds off… Read more »

Probably, but not definitely.

Something I’ve come around on is that having competent PG depth specifically is more important than any other position. We don’t have depth past Westbrook, and last year we barely had depth behind Murray in Reggie.

It’s really the only position where you can’t shift guys out of position to cover competently like you can at the wings/bigs. It all falls apart if you run out of PG depth to spell your starting (and injured) PG over the course of a season/series

I don’t know. It wouldn’t be the first time a rookie stepped up, and Alexander had a lot of supporters coming out of college. He’s similar in style to Jamal and there’s a good chance he’s a significant shooting upgrade over Facu from day 1. I wouldn’t completely write him off.

Facu became a starting PG when Murray’s knee went out because Monte and Barton also got hurt.

That’s very different than planning to use Facu to spell Monte & Murray for a few minutes here and there, backup a game here and there.

And this brings me back to the point – all the more reason to have PG depth. If you stock a team with known injured players, you need to have competent ball handling and playmaking ability available

There was a national article a while back that it’s going to be more common with new cba. Good deal if it works out and easy/cheap to dump if needed.

I really don’t want to bash the guy when he’s down but he really is the worst player in the league with a contract. imagine having 2 other players on the roster who could actually sniff NBA minutes. Markelle Fultz, Crowder, DSJ, hell bring Holiday or even Austin Rivers back. Holiday was getting minutes in the playoffs just last year.

Biggest takeaway for me is maybe Malone has loosened up a little??
Not playing 2 starters and resting the others for the second half? While Joe Max has something to prove as the Cs didn’t have a great offseason vibe wise.
Maybe we actually rest up before the playoffs this year?

Tatum not playing on team USA, Brown being salty.
I’m trying to postulate as to why Joe Mazz played his starters…usually doesn’t like something that is going on with the team

Remove Pickett and Zeke from this team. Pack Booth with them as well. And try to use this or next year to win something.

Waiting to see Malone do something smart that relates to coaching. This season will be his ascendency or ignomonious exit.

Zeke needs the right situation to function aka a Saric and a Westbrook. I’m not judging Zeke.
Pickett can’t handle the backup PG role though.
I wonder if we win another ship do you want to pack Booth then too?

Yes I would. He didnt do any mastermind moves since the last title tbh. Any average GM could have managed what he did in my unprofessional opinion.

With all the 2nd apron restrictions that no gm had to deal with previously?
Seems like the Braun, Watson, Straw picks/ Brown singings don’t do it for you? Maybe championships don’t do it for you?
I’m also a fan for Saric and Westy.
To me better than Bob Myers for sure who did harm by drafting Wiseman.

The same reason Booth is getting hate for doing minor changes to a built roster is what Myers did (he didn’t draft Curry or Klay)… he drafted Draymond. Calvin has hits too
Then of course Myers didn’t do well to extend the dynasty outside of signing Durant.

Zeke is in year 5, and still looks like he doesn’t belong in the league. He’s had plenty of opportunity to play real minutes.

For reference, he’s played about 4 times as many games and about 2000 more minutes than Bol Bol ever got as a Nugget. Zeke would be waived and out of the league if it wasn’t for how expensive his contract is

When did Zeke last play 4? It wasn’t last year or the year before.
Maybe the year when he was shooting well from 3 and we were raving about him is what you are referring to when he was last a 4

I have to agree with moving on from Pickett. There is no reason to trust the guy as the 3rd string PG. Alexander has game and just needs some seasoning to play the combo role. Young has nice speed which is missing through much of the roster.

Giving him a full deal and moving on from Pickett does not prevent Trey from playing in the g-league

Nah I mean Spencer Jones could be cut from that third 2 way tomorrow and no one would blink. Young is nice but he’s probably too small for the league

Yep, it’s easy enough to make another move as well. The argument for Trey is that you maintain your current roster balance- Alexander becomes the 3rd PG on the 15 man, and you still have Young, Jones and Hall as a PG, wing and big, respectively, on 2 ways. I’m just tossing out one possible scenario.

No clue why people are so impatient to have Trey on a full contract. Did we learn nothing from Booth’s premature moves? Alexander may be a great NBA player, but he could also not or (god forbid) get injured. Why commit a full time roster spot and contract to him before it’s needed?

If you’re looking at Alexander in a vacuum, I completely agree. The real question is whether you think a team will sign Young to a 2 way. If so, and you’d like to keep him around, then there’s a cascade effect.

This is the same issue we’ve learned since Booth took over. Roster spots are valuable. If you really want Young, then cut loose one of the other two way spots. No need to commit years/salary to the 14-18th guy on the roster.

I think there’s been a pretty strong overreaction to Booth’s wasting roster spots based almost entirely on one player. He bet on Pickett and lost, but it wasn’t a high stakes game. I think most would agree his 2022 off-season was strong, and I really liked what he did this year as well, with the exception of having to use picks to off-load RJ’s deal as a remnant of a poor 2023 off-season. The Holmes injury is clouding people’s judgment, to the point we’re seeing the organizing blamed for him… Read more »

Well again, if we’re just talking about Alexander then I agree. He can still join the team at times while getting his G League experience, and you maintain flexibility to pick up a veteran with Pickett’s roster spot.

The argument for giving Alexander a guaranteed deal is entirely based on whether they want to secure Young to a 2 way. If you want Young, Hall and Jones as your 2 ways, then it’s an easy move to make. Or just cut Jones or Hall loose.

Would have won the title last year if they had him on the playoff roster instead of pickett.

The reason to do it is that it’s better to have the coaching staff give the kid a full year of attention, and define a tangible role for him. They won’t do that if he’s on a 2-way contract that isn’t playoff eligible, and rightfully so

I don’t think that changes much based on contract status. Either way he’ll likely spend some time in the G League, and if he’s good enough to be in the playoff rotation, they’ll get him there. It’s easy to give him a guaranteed deal over the next 7 months.

Malone has absolutely talked about not being able to define roles for 2 way guys in the past even when injury would dictate it, Gillespie or Jack White come to mind

CG and White aren’t NBA caliber players though. There’s a reason that CG is on anther 2 way and White doesn’t have a deal. Of course it’s hard to define roles for fringe players on a part-time basis. If Alexander is truly the caliber of player many of us believe, that shouldn’t be a limitation. It’s pretty easy to have an internal conversation about his future and clear the necessary roster spot at the appropriate time.

My takeaway is that Strawther looks like an Energizer Bunny out there. Very active on both sides of the floor, which is good to see. If he can curtail his chucking tendencies and play more under control, he should fit in well on second unit, and as occasional starter when guys are load managed or hurt.

definitely need more scoring on the bench. Westbrook should help but having a real 3 point shooter out there will be important too.

Straight fire from Zach:

 That ended up leading to a third quarter performance that was not only an insult to the game of basketball, but also entertainment in general.

I’d also put Zeke in the Pickett closing thought. He looked outmatched and lost against a bunch of G-leaguers as well.

They both somehow make the game of basketball look like a job instead of a joy. It’s just kind of rough and you have to wonder if they know their days are numbered and just looking to ride out the rest of their guaranteed money.
