MikeCheck: Grizzlies balancing patience and progress amid Edey’s fit within fast-paced system

MEMPHIS – Halloween is still a few weeks away.

By then, Ja Morant doesn’t believe there will be many costumes as spooky or imposing as the Grizzlies’ outfit once 7-foot-4 rookie center Zach Edey finds his comfort zone within the offense.

“We just have to make sure he’s way more comfortable and confident, and make sure he’s getting the ball where he wants to be aggressive,” the Grizzlies’ point guard catalyst insists of the fledgling and potentially formative connection with Edey. “When we get it (together), it’s going to be scary, for sure.”

The Grizzlies know they have both time and several more opportunities to literally and figuratively get their lottery pick up to speed in the post.

If first impressions were any indication, Edey provided enough evidence to warrant massive expectations for what he can add to the Grizzlies’ frontline. He also showed how much patience will be required through some initial growing pains as the two-time NCAA college player of the Year out of Purdue adjusts to the dynamic demands required of a modern big man in the NBA.

Memphis hosts its first home preseason game Thursday as Edey and the Grizzlies aim to build on a largely encouraging – yet expectedly erratic – effort in Monday’s 121-116 win over Dallas.

Edey showed flashes of potential dominance when he slammed home two lob passes and also sank a textbook hook shot in the lane during his 18 minutes of action against the Mavericks. The No. 10 overall lottery pick in June’s NBA Draft also revealed some initial challenges he’ll work to overcome as he picked up two fouls in the game’s first three minutes and pushed to keep pace.

The Grizzlies overall got a decent boost from their two rookie draft picks Monday, with Edey and second-round swingman Jaylen Wells combining for 19 points, nine rebounds, a block and a steal. Whereas Edey made most of his plays in the first half, Wells broke through with all 12 of his minutes in the second half to knock down 3-of-5 attempts from 3-point range.

Edey didn’t place too much stock in his performance, but felt it was a solid first step. While the Mavericks were without key perimeter contributors in Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson, they did play their two rotation centers in Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II.

Gafford and Lively II were crucial to the Mavericks’ success in reaching the NBA Finals last season. So, it wasn’t lost on Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins or Edey that he would get his first taste of NBA action against a pair of productive bigs from a title-contending team.

“They were in the Finals for a reason last year, and they’re a good team in general,” Edey said after enduring the challenge on both ends of the court. “To go against that early is only going to help me, help us. I just have to get out there and keep getting a feel for everything.”

In general, Jenkins liked what he saw from Edey, especially how he responded to some of the early foul trouble. Jenkins elected to start veteran backup Brandon Clarke at center for the second half Monday, which moved Edey to a role off the bench for his final stint.

As the Grizzlies transition into a new offensive system, Jenkins and his revamped coaching staff are implementing an up-tempo attack. Executing within the demands of the high-pace scheme will be a work in progress for Memphis throughout the preseason.

That’s especially the case for Edey as he transitions from the focal point of a ball-control offense in Purdue’s methodical low-post system to essentially a 94-feet NBA track meet with Memphis.

It’s an adjustment for everyone. The Grizzlies committed 23 turnovers that generated 30 points for Dallas on Monday, yet they also tallied 35 assists as 26 fastbreak points. Jenkins applauded Edey’s competitive spirit going up against a proven NBA frontline.

“You can see he’s forcing some tough shots there inside and battling for boards,” Jenkins pointed out. “He’s just got to get a sense of that physicality and speed in those tight situations. Offensively, he’s got to clean up a little of those (transition) running habits. It’s a step in the right direction and he’s doing everything that we’re asking of him.”

Edey doesn’t believe he’s being asked to do too much too soon. He mentioned how stints in recent summers with his Canadian National Team has given him a taste of speed, athleticism and physicality at the NBA level. Team Canada’s roster features several NBA players, including Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Denver’s Jamal Murray.

“It helped me a lot, because Team Canada was a super-athletic, physical team,” said Edey, who bypassed a spot with Canada at the Paris Olympics to instead train with the Grizzlies and shed 10 pounds after the draft. “It prepared me for the pace a little bit. I’ve seen this pace before, but I have to keep working to figure out how to play in it now.”

For Wells, the faster pace created open looks on the perimeter on Monday. That may continue to be the case should the 6-foot-8 former Washington State sharpshooter snag minutes. Wells, the 39th overall pick in June, is among those looking to step up as swingmen GG Jackson (foot surgery) and Vince Williams Jr. (leg stress fracture) miss the preseason to recover from injuries.

“It’s tough to be at that same pace for 94 feet, but we’ve worked on it a lot in practice and training camp,” Wells said of gaining his stride as a rookie within the system. “Soon, we’ll go out there and it’s going to be second nature. Obviously, we made some mistakes, but we’re going to be making aggressive mistakes rather than passive mistakes.”

For the rookies as well as the vets, it’s a case of learning on the fly.

In Edey’s case, the ability to process the game will eventually slow down.

Just not the pace at which the Grizzlies plan to play.

“It’s a learning experience and he’s a tremendous player,” Morant said of Edey. “He was pretty good once he got rolling. We’re not worried about him at all. And I know he’s not worried.”

Together, they’ll keep work out the initial kinks of the new system.

At this pace, they’ll eventually be a frightening fit.
