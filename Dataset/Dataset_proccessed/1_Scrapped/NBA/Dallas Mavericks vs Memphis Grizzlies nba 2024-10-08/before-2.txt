The New Orleans Pelicans are set to tip off their NBA preseason against the Orlando Magic on Monday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. The franchise's star, Zion Williamson, will play as the two-time NBA All-Star prepares for the regular season.

Pelicans coach Willie Green confirmed on Saturday that all of the team's starters will participate in the game. However, Williamson and the rest of the starters are expected to play limited minutes.

"More than likely it will be 20 minutes and under, something like that,” Green told reporters.

"There are going to be times where we go position-less. It could be to start the game, or at some point throughout the course of the game, but we’re probably going to play more of that than we have in the past," the Pelicans coach added.
Zion Williamson excited to lead Pelicans' charge

Zion Williamson is gearing up for his sixth NBA season, though that includes the 2021-22 campaign that he missed because of a broken bone in his right foot. Last season, the 24-year-old displayed the most durability of his career, playing 70 games for the Pelicans.

As the new season approaches, Williamson is eager to once again showcase his exceptional skillset at the highest level. While he acknowledges the challenges ahead, the two-time All-Star is ready to reap the benefits of the hard work he put in during the offseason.

"It’s always exciting at the start of a new season, because you learned so much from the previous season," Williamson said in an interview with Fox 8 WVUE-TV. "You’re ready to get back with the team, just showcase what everybody worked on and where we can go.
"At the top. Is that going to be an easy journey, not at all. We know it’s a hard road ahead of us, and we’re excited for it."

Williamson helped New Orleans reach the playoffs last season but missed the first round series against the OKC Thunder owing to an hamstring injury. In Williamson's absence, the Pelicans got swept by the Thunder.

In the regular season, Williamson averaged 22.9 points on 57% shooting from the field, including 33.3% from 3-point range. He also averaged 5.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.1 steals per game.
