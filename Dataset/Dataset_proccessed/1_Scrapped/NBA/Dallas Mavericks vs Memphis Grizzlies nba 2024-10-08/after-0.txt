The training camp cuts have officially begun for the Mavericks.

The Mavericks announced Tuesday that they have waived A.J. Lawson, which brings their roster to 20.

Lawson spent the last two seasons with the Mavericks, primarily as a two-way player during the 2022-23 season until he was signed to a non-guaranteed contract on March 3. He appeared in 56 games for the Mavericks during that span, averaging 3.4 points and 1.2 rebounds in 7.5 minutes per game.

“A.J. has been great for us,” said Mavericks coach Jason Kidd. “Unfortunately, they waived him today. We wish him the best of luck. When you look at the athleticism, the way that he has improved, the development. He did everything we asked. There was a big jump in his game, but looking at the numbers, management had to make a decision.”

It’s a decision that was foreshadowed, especially since Dallas’ re-signing of Markieff Morris. The deadline to finalize rosters for the regular season is Oct. 21, but Lawson or Morris needed to be waived by Oct. 19 in order to stay below the first apron of the league’s new collective bargaining agreement.

The Mavericks could opt to re-sign Lawson with their third two-way spot, which is currently up for grabs between training camp signees Jazian Gortman, Jamarion Sharp and Emanuel Miller. Lawson had eight points and three rebounds off the bench in Monday’s preseason loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.

Lawson went undrafted in 2021 out of South Carolina and spent time with the College Park Skyhawks (Atlanta Hawks) for his rookie season and signed two two-way contracts with the Minnesota Timberwolves.
