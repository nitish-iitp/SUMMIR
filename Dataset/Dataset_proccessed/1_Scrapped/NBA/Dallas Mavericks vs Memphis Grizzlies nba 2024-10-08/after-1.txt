The Grizzlies will play their first game of the 2024-25 season when they visit the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City on October 23.

Last season, they were the 13th seed in the Western Conference and missed the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2020.

If healthy, the Grizzlies are seen as a team who can finish with a top-six seed.
