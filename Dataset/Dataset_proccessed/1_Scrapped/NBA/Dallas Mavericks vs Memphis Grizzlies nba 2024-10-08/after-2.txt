Memphis Grizzlies vs Dallas Mavericks: Game Summary

Despite playing without three of their best players, the Dallas Mavericks gave the Memphis Grizzlies a tough fight in the first two quarters. Naji Marshall, acquired in the offseason, Jaden Hardy, Dereck Lively II and unheralded Jazian Gortman carried the hosts in the first half.

The Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks were tied 60-60 after two quarters of play.

Strong play from Ja Morant, Santi Aldama, Desmond Bane and Brandon Clarke pushed the Grizzlies to a 93-90 advantage after the third quarter. Clarke looked re-invigorated after an injury-hampered 2023-24 campaign. Scotty Pippen Jr. also showed why he could be a solid rotation player next season for Memphis. He had 12 points and six assists heading into the fourth period.

Jaden Hardy, Dereck Lively II and Jazian Gortman continued to carry the cudgels for the Mavericks. Gortman was a pleasant surprise, tallying 17 points, three steals and two assists in 13 minutes. He took advantage of the Grizzlies’ defense leaving him open on a handful of occasions. The rookie made 5-of-8 shots, including 4-of-6 from deep before the start of the fourth frame.

The Grizzlies and the Mavericks couldn’t sustain the highly entertaining third-quarter explosion. Both teams were quite sloppy in the fourth quarter and struggled to generate good possessions.

Rookie Emmanuel Miller came off the bench to lead the Mavs with 10 fourth-quarter points. Olivier Maxence-Prosper also stepped up to help carry the load for Jason Kidd’s unit. Gortman continued to impress, finishing with 20 points, four steals, three rebounds and three blocks.

The Grizzlies, behind Brandon Clarke, Scotty Pippen Jr., Jake LaRavia and Jaylen Wells, overcame the Mavericks 121-116 for their first win this preseason.
