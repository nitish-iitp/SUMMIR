NBA: Oklahoma tears Hawks’ wings to stay unbeaten in three games

Oklahoma crushes Atlanta to keep their NBA record untainted. (Oklahoma City Thunder official Facebook)

By Leobert Julian A. de la Peña

The Oklahoma City Thunder continued their hot start in the ongoing 2024-2025 NBA regular season after dominating the Atlanta Hawks, 128-104, to stay undefeated in three games on October 28, 2024.

After a slow first-quarter performance with Atlanta taking a four-point lead heading into the second frame, 23-27, the Thunder got back immediately and won all the remaining periods en route to a convincing outing.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander posted his best-scoring performance of the season so far after dropping 35 points built from 10/11 shooting from the free throw line and three treys.

The favorite to win this season’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award notched a near triple-double stat line, adding 11 rebounds, nine assists, three steals, and three blocks against the Hawks.

It was Alexander who sparked Oklahoma’s resurgence in the second, steering the Thunder to a 34-point period with his isolation jump shots and crafty drives to the basket.

After Alexander’s unconscious offensive showing, Atlanta suddenly went flat and failed to maintain their high-octane outing in the first quarter.

Chet Holmgren picked up where Alexander left off and scored his third consecutive 20-point game of the season with 25 markers, nine rebounds, six blocks, four dimes, and a steal.

The sophomore center made the most out of Atlanta’s late defensive help in the pick-and-op plays where he generated most of his open looks from downtown.

Jalen Williams also took a page from his Chicago diary showing after stuffing the stat sheets with 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists, and two steals.

Trae Young had another 24-point outing for Atlanta but was hounded with 10 turnovers, the most he had in the ongoing season.

The All-Star point guard was a -18 inside the playing court and had to be subbed out several times in the second half when Williams and Alexander schooled him at the post in their switch actions.

With the win, the Thunder handed the Hawks their first loss of the season, while Oklahoma will seek to extend their untainted record on October 31, 2024, against the San Antonio Spurs.
