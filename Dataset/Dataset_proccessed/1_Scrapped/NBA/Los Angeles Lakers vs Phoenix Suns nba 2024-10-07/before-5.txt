Oklahoma City Thunder vs. San Antonio Spurs – NBA Preseason Prediction

On October 7, 2024, the Oklahoma City Thunder travel to San Antonio to take on the Spurs in a highly anticipated preseason matchup at the Frost Bank Center. Both teams are eager to showcase their young talent, but the Thunder are expected to have the upper hand, especially with their roster depth and recent form.

As the #1 NBA expert at KingPin Pro, I’ll break down the key factors for this game and provide a confident pick. For more sports picks, check out My Profile.

 

Team Overview
Oklahoma City Thunder Overview

The Thunder are coming off a solid 2023-24 season, showing promise with their young core. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander remains the centerpiece of the team, while players like Josh Giddey and Chet Holmgren provide additional playmaking and size. Though several players like Gilgeous-Alexander and Luguentz Dort are listed as game-time decisions, OKC's depth should allow them to dominate this preseason contest.

After a tough playoff exit last season, the Thunder are looking to build momentum ahead of the new season. Their ability to integrate young stars with experienced role players will make them a tough opponent for the Spurs, even in the preseason.

San Antonio Spurs Overview

The Spurs are entering a rebuild centered around their rising star Victor Wembanyama, who is listed as questionable for this game. San Antonio has shown flashes of brilliance but lacks consistency, especially when facing more seasoned teams. Players like Zach Collins and Charles Bassey provide some interior presence, but the Spurs are still a work in progress.

In this game, much of their success will hinge on the availability of Wembanyama and how well the supporting cast performs. Without key contributors, they could struggle to keep up with a deeper Thunder squad.

 

Odds Table
Team	Spread	Moneyline	Total
Oklahoma City Thunder	-4.5 (-125)	-190	Over 221.5 (-110)
San Antonio Spurs	+4.5 (-105)	+150	Under 221.5 (-120)
 
Prediction

The Oklahoma City Thunder have the depth and talent advantage in this preseason matchup. While San Antonio has promising young players like Wembanyama, his uncertain availability could severely limit the Spurs' chances. The Thunder’s roster, even if some key players are rested, should be enough to cover the spread.

OKC’s young core has shown cohesion and chemistry, which will be crucial in this preseason game. Their superior depth should allow them to dominate throughout, especially if San Antonio is without some of its top talent.

Pick: Oklahoma City Thunder -4.5 (-125)
