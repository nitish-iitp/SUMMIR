Denver Nuggets 
The Denver Nuggets got off to a rocky start to the season, but they will be feeling much better after outlasting the Raptors in a 127-125 overtime road win last night. Nikola Jokic led the team with 40 points, 10 rebounds and four assists on 18 of 27 shooting, Jamal Murray and Christian Braun each scored 17 points while Aaron Gordon tallied 16 points with 11 rebounds and eight assists. As a team, the Nuggets shot 49 percent from the field and nine of 20 from the 3-point line as they fought hard to tie the scores at the end of regulation thanks to a clutch shot from Jamal Murray, before they went on a decisive 8-0 run in the overtime period to come away with the elusive first win of the season. The Nuggets will meet the Timberwolves and Jazz after this game.
Brooklyn Nets 
Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Nets are in similar form as they lost their first two games of the season before they took down the Bucks in a 115-102 upset home win on Sunday. Cam Thomas led the team with 32 points on 10 of 21 shooting, Dennis Schroder added 29 points with six assists while Cam Johnson and Noah Clowney each scored 13 points. As a team, the Nets shot just 42 percent from the field and 16 of 45 from the 3-point line as they played great defense to limit the Bucks to just 20 points in the second quarter to take the early lead before the Nets poured in 67 points in the second half to make it look easy in the end. Dorian Finney-Smith was the only blemish from the surprising win as he finished with just three points on one of eight shooting. 
Why the Denver Nuggets will win
The Nuggets have won each of their last 16 night games against Eastern Conference opponents that held a losing record.
The Nets have lost each of their last nine games as home underdogs on the first leg of a back-to-back.
The Nets have failed to cover the spread in each of their last nine games after winning as underdogs.
The Nuggets have covered the spread in seven of their last eight night games following a road win.
Total Points Facts
Each of the Nuggets' last six games at Barclays Center following a road win has gone OVER the total points line.
Eight of the Nets' last nine games as home underdogs against opponents who are on the second leg of a back-to-back have gone UNDER the total points line.
Denver Nuggets vs Brooklyn Nets Prediction
The Nuggets don't have any player listed on the injury report, while the Nets are still missing Bojan Bogdanovic, Trendon Watford, and Ben Simmons. The Nuggets really needed a win to get their season on track and they were able to get it done in an unconvincing overtime win over the lowly Raptors last night. The Nets didn't look good at all during their first two games which were both losses, but they looked like a different team in their big upset win over the Bucks. I might have been tempted to take the Nets if we were getting more free points, but given the short line, I will have to stick with the Nuggets despite playing their second game of a back-to-back set.
