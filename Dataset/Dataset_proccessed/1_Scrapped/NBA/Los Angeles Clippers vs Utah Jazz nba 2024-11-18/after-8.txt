FACTOR TO WATCH FOR: 
TWO ACTIVE 3-POINT LEADERS
Clippers guard James Harden passed Ray Allen for second on the NBA's all-time made 3-pointers list on Sunday. Harden jokingly told ESPN insider Shams Charania that he would consider himself first on the list once he passed Allen because Curry "doesn't count." For context, Curry has made 807 more threes than Harden despite playing fewer games and minutes. That said, Harden's feat is a testament to his longevity as a volume shooter and scorer. At this stage of his career, he's taken a more prominent playmaking role while also emphasizing attacking the boards without the "Boardman" Kawhi Leonard available. A career 36.3 percent shooter from three, Harden is having his least efficient shooting season, shooting 31.0 percent on 8.1 attempts per game. Curry is shooting slightly above his career average, at 43.2 percent on 9.0 attempts per game.

L.A. CLIPPERS SCOUTING REPORT
The Clippers have been an up-and-down team this season. After their win against the Warriors on Oct. 27, they lost three straight games, then won four straight and most recently lost three straight, before Sunday's win over the Utah Jazz. At 7-7 overall, they are 11th place in the Western Conference. Norman Powell has been the team's leading scorer averaging 23.3 points per game, stepping up after Paul George's departure and with Kawhi Leonard sidelined. James Harden has been a vital all-around contributor as one of four players averaging at least 20 points (20.6 PPG), seven rebounds (7.9 RPG) and seven assists (8.5 APG) this season, joining Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Cade Cunningham.
