The final scheduled preseason game for Wednesday, Oct. 9, was the Golden State Warriors vs Sacramento Kings. The Kings welcomed the Warriors at the Golden 1 Center for their first preseason game. Golden State, on the other hand, was coming off a 91-90 win over the LA Clippers on Saturday.

Sacramento got to test out its new lineup featuring DeMar DeRozan, whom the team acquired in a three-team sign-and-trade with the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs. DeRozan gives the Kings a third option on offense behind De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis.

On the other hand, the Warriors continued to try and find out who will be replacing Klay Thompson in the starting lineup. De'Anthony Melton got a chance in their first preseason game, while Brandin Podziemski received the nod for tonight's game.

The Golden State Warriors have always been known as a 3-point shooting team and they were on fire from beyond the arc for this game. The Warriors started the game on fire by hitting five 3-point shots in the first quarter, taking a 31-27 lead after 12 minutes.

Golden State was even better from threes in the second period, adding seven more 3-pointers for a total of 12 in the first half. However, the Sacramento Kings were attacking the basket at almost every possession to get the 68-66 advantage at the end of two quarters.

However, the Warriors never let up their 3-point shooting and took control of the game in the second half. As usual, both coaches pulled off their big stars and let the rest of the roster battle it out.

Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton and Buddy Hield were the story for the Warriors. They are the three candidates to start alongside Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga and possibly Andrew Wiggins. Hield is perfect for the sixth-man role, finishing with 22 points off the bench and missing just one shot.

Podziemski struggled with his shot, going 3-for-8 from the field, but dished out a game-high eight assists. Melton, on the other hand, was good on both sides of the floor. He finished with 16 points, five rebounds and three assists on 6-for-12 shooting the floor.

As for the Kings, Malik Monk was a microwave with 13 points in 10 minutes and DeMar DeRozan looked comfortable in his new uniform. Jalen McDaniels and Isaac Jones had solid runs during the game, but the Kings' rotation is still up in the air.
