Cairns Taipans Team News

After not entering the playoffs last season and suffering a heavy 27-point defeat against the Illawarra Hawks in the season opener, it was looking like another tough year would await the Cairns Taipans. However, the Taipans quickly picked themselves up and reversed the situation with three straight victories.

The new-look Cairns did a lot of work in the offseason. They replaced all three of their imports and brought in Pedro Bradshaw, Rob Edwards and Tanner Groves. The biggest domestic addition was signing Kyrin Galloway and so far, their new concoction of players has worked out well. At the start of the season, they suffered a heavy 27-point loss (102:75) at home at the hands of the Illawarra Hawks, but it wasn´t a sign of things to come. Following their miserable opening, the Taipans went on a roll and won three straight games against Adelaide, Tasmania and Melbourne. Their last win on the road against the powerful Melbourne United by double digits (101:88) was particularly impressive and they did it without one of their imports Tanner Groves, who will absent in today´s contest as well.

The Cairns Taipans are in blistering form, but they have two heavy absences for today´s match in view of Taran Armstrong and one of their imports Tanner Groves. Their opponents are also dealing with some absences, so overall, because of their superb form, the Taipans will enter today´s clash as slight favourites.

Perth Wildcats Team News

Unexpectedly, the Perth Wildcats have had a very bad start to the season. The expectations were very high ahead of the new year, but they opened up the new season with a very poor 1-3 W-L record.

While it is true the Wildcats opened the new season poorly, we have to take into consideration the fact they were heavily shorthanded in their last two matches. In the losses to Melbourne and Tasmania, they were without two crucial scorers Tai Webster and import Dylan Windler, which severely impacted their performance. For today´s crucial matchup in Cairns, both Windler and Webster will be back, but the Wildcats will be without one of their key frontcourt members Keanu Pinder. However, that is only one player missing, so Perth should be more than competitive in Queensland this Thursday.

The Wildcats will be without Pinder, but Windler and Webster are coming back. They have a good chance to win and stop their losing streak, but predicting the winner in this matchup is extremely tough.

Cairns Taipans vs Perth Wildcats Prediction

Both teams have their absences and it is extremely difficult to predict the winner and the spread coverage. Because both teams are missing key scorers, we expect a slow-paced, defensive style in today´s contest and opted for the Total Under.
