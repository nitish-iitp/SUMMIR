Three-time NBA champion Danny Green announces his retirement
He won titles with the Spurs (2014), Raptors (2019) and Lakers (2020). You can throw the 2009 North Carolina NCAA title on his resume as well.

My latest for @orlandosports:
With the #Magic‘s depth on full display at the Spurs, some questions were answered but others arose.
“I liked the way our first unit started the game,” coach Jamahl Mosley said post-game. “There was a pop that they had…” orlandosentinel.com/2024/10/10/orl… – 10:35 AM

After 15 NBA seasons, Danny Green says he is retiring. Green, who’s announcing the retirement on his podcast Thursday, is one of four players in NBA history to win championships with three different teams (2014 with Spurs, 2019 with Raptors, 2020 with Lakers). pic.x.com/d2mIOG62lh – 10:32 AM

The (preseason) triple take: Spurs 107, Magic 97
1. Wemby and CP3 break out the Rust-Oleum
2. Steph Castle could become a free-throw monster
3. Could Wesley and/or Mamu force Pop’s hand when it comes to rotation decisions?

@PaulGarciaNBA
“It’s so crazy because, playing against him is one thing, but when you see Paolo dribble in there and think he got a lane, then everybody sort of starts kicking it out,” said Chris Paul of what it’s like to see Wemby detering rim attacks in real time. bit.ly/3NkTkul – 12:18 AM

“Comfortable, to sum it all up,” #Magic guard Jett Howard said when asked by @Josh_Cohen_NBA how he felt on the court in Orlando’s starting lineup. “Just playing off them, they make it so easy.”
Howard led all scorers with 19 points to go with 3 assists and 2 steals in 29 mins. – 11:44 PM
Tom Orsborn
@tom_orsborn
Wemby on his lob dunk from CP: “It felt very natural and it felt like it was a good play, and he is making a lot of good plays. It feels really good to play with him. Yeah, in this preseason we are going to try to experiment as much as we can on that pick and roll.” – 11:33 PM
Jason Beede
@therealBeede
“They make your life easier,” #Magic center Goga Bitadze said about playing with Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. “Shoutout to Paolo and Franz, they’re big time players and they’re playing defense … You don’t see a lot of that in the league.”

Spurs’ D pleased Pop: “We were more physical tonight, more aggressive at the defensive end of the floor. That makes a difference for us. We have to do that because we weren’t very good at the defensive end last year, so that’s really the emphasis this season.” – 11:15 PM

Through 2 games, Blake Wesley has 12 assists against 1 turnover. He’s got 5 assists tonight without a turnover. – 10:01 PM
Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
Another quick fire spot-up three for Castle. He leads the Spurs with 17 points
His second made from three – 9:56 PM

@PaulGarciaNBA
Stephon Castle with HALF of his points coming from the FT line.
4 paint points
7 made free throws
3 point make
He’s got 14 points and just 1 TO after 6 TOs Monday
He’s been much more aggressive attacking the rim to draw contact – 9:51 PM

Wemby and CP3 went to the locker room after their last shift to lift and begin postgame cool down.
Going to guess neither will be returning to tonight’s exhibition shindig. – 9:45 PM
Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
Wemby and Chris Paul check out having played 23 minutes tonight. – 9:39 PM
Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
Some possessions to begin the 3Q:
– Wemby blocked an Anthony Black floater
– Wemby blocked a Tristan da Silva layup
– CP3 made a pull-up three with the defense going under when Wemby set a pick.
– CP3 made a right elbow mid-ranger – 9:31 PM
Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
Same starters for the Spurs to begin the 3Q considering Wemby already played 17 mins. – 9:26 PM

@PaulGarciaNBA
Eye test shot location box score at the half.
Wemby and CP3 logged 17 minutes in that first half. They spent all their time on the floor at the same time. pic.x.com/YsrktXt7Mw – 9:11 PM

Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
Castle with 2 plays on both ends:
1) Stripped Banchero in the post when Banchero was backing him down.
2) Made a spot-up three with the hop – 8:55 PM
Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
Nice 1-on-1 defense from Blake Wesley.
Banchero tried to get by him 2-3 times and each time Wesley prevented the drive. Paolo had to stop his dribble – 8:52 PM
Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
Pop is letting Wemby and CP3 build chemistry in this first half. Both times they’ve been subbed out at the same time together. – 8:49 PM
Paul Garcia
@PaulGarciaNBA
It’s unfair when Wemby puts the ball on the floor after a successful pump fake.
He throws it down there.
Late on a halfcourt possession, he went to the fading mid-ranger and got it to fall. – 8:43 PM
Mike Finger
@mikefinger
Chris Paul might not survive this with his sanity intact.
Not this season. This preseason game. – 8:40 PM

@PaulGarciaNBA
Another P&R between CP3 and Wemby results in Wemby drawing 2 defenders, then throwing a no-look pass to Branham for a layup. – 8:37 PM
