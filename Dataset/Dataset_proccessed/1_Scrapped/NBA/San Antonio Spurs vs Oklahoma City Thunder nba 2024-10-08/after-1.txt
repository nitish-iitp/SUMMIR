The San Antonio Spurs used their No. 4 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft to get former UConn star Stephon Castle. Spurs GM Brian Wright said after the draft that picking Castle wasn’t a tough decision. Wright added that the guard’s two-way impact would make him an immediate contributor to coach Gregg Popovich’s plans.

On Monday, Castle made his pro debut albeit in a preseason game. The Spurs hosted the OKC Thunder as both teams ramped up their preparation for the 2024-25 season.

Late in the third quarter, Stephon Castle grabbed the limelight with this play:

The San Antonio Spurs took advantage of the Thunder’s unattentive defense. Castle received the ball on the left flank without anyone defending him. The 6-foot-6 guard did not waste time attacking the basket once he got the ball. OKC rookie Alex Ducas arrived too late to challenge the shot.

Stephon Castle recorded a 37-inch vertical during the NBA Draft Combine. He showed that athleticism by cocking the ball back while in flight before slamming it with authority. The Spurs bench went wild following his dunk.

Castle played 19 minutes and finished with five points on 2-for-3 shooting. He added three assists and two rebounds but committed six turnovers.

Gregg Popovich raves about Stephon Castle

Several former San Antonio Spurs players have said that Gregg Popovich is tough to play for. "Pop," who holds the record for most regular season records in NBA history, demands a lot from his players. Spurs legend and Hall of Famer Tony Parker once said that pleasing Popovich in basketball is a tall task.

Stephon Castle, though, already earned the legendary coach's praise before he played a minute in the NBA. Here's what Popovich had to say when asked to comment about the rookie:

"I'm very impressed. Really mature young man. Has a great demeanor and way about him. ... Good basketball IQ. He's strong. He learns quickly. He's a good one."

"Pop" added that Castle could play "1,2 or 3 right now."

The 6-foot-6 rookie will come off the bench this season. He will be Devin Vassell's primary backup but can also run the offense if needed. San Antonio's bench, much maligned last season, gets a big boost with Castle on the roster.
