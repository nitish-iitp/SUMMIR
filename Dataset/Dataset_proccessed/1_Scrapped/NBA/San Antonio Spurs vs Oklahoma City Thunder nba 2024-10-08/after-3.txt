Swallowing up a drive to the basket, Chet Holmgren forced a miss near the rim. Isaiah Hartenstein was nearby to collect the defensive rebound.

The early sequence in the Oklahoma City Thunder's 112-107 preseason win over the San Antonio Spurs will likely be replayed several times throughout the season. That's one of the several benefits of the Hartenstein-Holmgren frontcourt.

Hartenstein stood out from a pile of positives in his preseason debut. The 26-year-old helped anchor a shut-down interior defense with Holmgren. When one was on the ball, the other was near it for the immediate aftermath.

On offense, Hartenstein showed off his playmaking. The seven-footer was used as an offensive hub in his limited action. He'd dribble toward the basket before dishing out a flashy pass to his teammates. He'd also be part of several dribble handoffs and created space with hard screens for his teammates.

It was everything the Thunder likely envisioned and then some. Hartenstein finished with four points, eight rebounds and seven assists in 17 minutes off the bench. He sat out the second half with Jalen Williams, Alex Caruso and Holmgren.

"It was a lot of fun. Just giving him different options. Think we had a couple of times he came off a hand-off. Played DHO together," Hartenstein said about his pairing with Holmgren. "Defensively, he can go contest, I can go contest. We also know we're going to get the rebound after."

After not rostering a traditional backup center for the last two seasons, the Thunder pivoted and added one of the league's best backup bigs. Hartenstein unlocks several levels OKC can utilize on both sides of the floor. Its preseason opener showed a quick glimpse of what will happen once the games start to matter.

"It was a lot of play. Need to keep building on that," Hartenstein said.
