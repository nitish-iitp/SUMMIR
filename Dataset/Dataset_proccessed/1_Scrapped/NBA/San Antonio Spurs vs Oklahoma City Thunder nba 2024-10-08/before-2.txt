What happened to Ja Morant? Grizzlies All-Star guard exits preseason game vs Mavericks with injury scare (Oct. 7, 2024) (Image Source: Getty)

Ja Morant survived an injury scare upon his return to action during the preseason skirmish between the Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center on Sunday. The All-Star guard appeared to roll his ankle in the second quarter during a transition play with the Grizzlies holding a slim 35-34 lead over the Mavericks.

The guard exited the game and headed toward the locker room, leaving a few faces concerned on the Memphis bench.

But in what came as good news, Morant was seen back on the bench minutes later and re-entered the game. While he was a bench spectator for the remainder of the game, Memphis locked up a 121-116 win against the Mavs who rested their key stars.

Ja Morant and the Grizzlies were tied 60-apiece at halftime with the guard propping up six points, three rebounds, and as many assists in 14 minutes of action. He looked his usual self and even recorded a stellar block showcasing his athleticism and speed.

Grizzlies coach Tayor Jenkins offers latest update on Ja Morant's injury

Speaking to the media in the aftermath of the Grizzlies win, head coach Taylor Jenkins provided an update on Ja Morant's injury. He said the guard tweaked his ankle and was held off playing in the second half as a precautionary measure. He added that the guard will be evaluated in the coming days.

Morant's availability for the upcoming games will perhaps now be a game-time decision as Memphis will look to make sure he remains injury-free. The explosive guard was a notable absentee last season after missing the first 25 games serving a suspension. He was later shut down 10 games into his season following a shoulder injury that saw him spend his summer rehabbing and strengthening it.

Up next, the Grizzlies play the Charlotte Hornets followed by a clash against the Chicago Bulls. The Indiana Pacers follow after that before they end their preseason slate with a skirmish against the Miami Heat. Ja Morant and Memphis will hope that the tweak can be sorted ahead of their season opener against the Utah Jazz on Oct. 23.
