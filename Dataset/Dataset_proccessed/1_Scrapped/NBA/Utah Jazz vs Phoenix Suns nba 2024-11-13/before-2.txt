NBA Player Props Today For 11/12/24!

Check out some spicy NBA Player Props for 11/12/24! Sportsmemo’s Steve Seagrave drops the best picks for NBA player props today with a a couple stellar suggestions to check out!

WagerTalk, the largest picks site online, offers NBA FREE PICKS every day, as well as cheap premium paid NBA picks from expert professional handicappers.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Kyle Lowry Philadelphia 76ers Over 4.5 Assists (-130) FD

Tyrese Maxey is out tonight due to a hamstring string and Kyle Lowry have averaged 5.5 assists on 11.5 potential assists and 61.5 passes made (team high) per game without him on the court. Lowry has also seen his minutes jump from 22 to 32 without Maxey in the mix.

The New York Knicks have allowed the 9th most assists per game to opposing point guards with 9.13 per game. Recently we have seen point guards clear this line against New York including Tyrese Haliburton 14 assists, Dame Lillard 6 assists, Trae Young 10 assists and Cade Cunningham 6 assists.

Joel Embiid will also return from a 3-game suspension tonight, giving Lowry another outlet and the Knicks have struggled to defend the pick & roll as they rank 23rd in the NBA. Let’s take advantage of Maxey being out of what should be a close game with a spread set at -3.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Jusuf Nurkic Phoenix Suns Over 11.5 Points (-104) FD

Jusuf Nurkic has cleared this line in 3 of his last 4 games with 15, 20 & 15 points despite scoring 0 points in his last game against Sacramento.

However, this game offers a perfect bounce back spot as Nurkic has cleared this line in five straight road games against the Utah Jazz while averaging 18.4 points per game.

He’s also scored 12+ points in 7 of his last 9 games overall against Utah. The Jazz allow the 5th most points (28.18/game) and highest field goal percentage allowed (69.82) to opposing centers.

Kevin Durant is out tonight due to an ankle injury and that leaves a boatload of points for other players and Nurkic will be a beneficiary.
