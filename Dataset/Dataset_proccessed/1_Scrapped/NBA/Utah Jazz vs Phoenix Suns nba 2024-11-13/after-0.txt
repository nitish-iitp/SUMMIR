On Tuesday night, the BBN had a fun time celebrating Kentucky’s upset win over No. 6 Duke in the Champions Classic, but a former Cat had some fun himself out on the west coast.

Devin Booker led the Phoenix Suns to a 120-112 win over the Utah Jazz on the road to make the Suns the top seed in the Western Conference. Booker put up 31 points on 11-20 (5-9 3PT) shooting while also recording four rebounds, two assists, two blocks and two steals on the night as well.

The Suns now sit at 9-2 on the year, and only the Oklahoma City Thunder can say they have that record in the West.

Other BBNBA Notes
Tyler Herro scored 40 points against the Detroit Pistons while Bam Adebayo added 20 of his own.
Karl-Anthony Towns recorded a 21-point, 13-rebound double-double to lead the New York Knicks to a 111-99 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. Tyrese Maxey (right hamstring) and Justin Edwards did not suit up for the 76ers.
Shaden Sharpe helped the Portland Trail Blazers get a 122-108 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves with 17 points. Julius Randle recorded 11 points in a losing effort.
Johnny Juzang recorded two assists and a rebound in 13 minutes of play against the Phoenix Suns.
PJ Washington (right knee sprain) did not play against the Golden State Warriors.
