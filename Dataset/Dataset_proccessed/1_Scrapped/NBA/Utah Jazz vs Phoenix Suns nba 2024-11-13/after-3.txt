Devin Booker and Bradley Beal combined to make 9-of-16 3-pointers en route to 31 and 24 points, respectively, and the Phoenix Suns opened NBA Cup group play with a 120-112 defeat of the host Utah Jazz on Tuesday in Salt Lake City.

Mason Plumlee recorded a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds starting in place of an injured Jusuf Nurkic (ankle) for Phoenix, who was also without All-NBA forward Kevin Durant out for a second game due to a calf strain.

Utah, seeking its first win at home this season, chipped away at the deficit in the second half. Jordan Clarkson connected on a pair of 3-pointers in the final minute, both of which pulled the Jazz to within six, but they could get no closer.

Phoenix’s 16-of-22 to 7-of-9 edge at the free-throw line helped keep Utah at arm’s length. The Suns also benefited from outgunning the Jazz beyond the 3-point arc on a night both teams shot well from deep.

Beal, who shot 4-of-7, and Booker at 5-of-9 helped Phoenix to an 18-of-39 performance (46.2 percent) from long range. Grayson Allen came off the bench to knock down 4-of-9 beyond the arc, part of his 15 points.

Clarkson’s 4-of-9 night led Utah to 15-of-38 shooting (39.5 percent) from 3-point range, including the two down the stretch. Clarkson finished with 16 points off the bench. Jazz rookie Kyle Filipowski added 18 off the bench and Lauri Markkanen scored 17.

Utah also got a big second-half effort from John Collins, who scored six straight points over a stretch midway through the fourth. Collins’ flurry, part of a team-high 29 points, could not make a dent with Booker answering with five points during the stretch and Royce O’Neal hitting a 3-pointer that pushed the Phoenix lead to 13. –Field Level Media
