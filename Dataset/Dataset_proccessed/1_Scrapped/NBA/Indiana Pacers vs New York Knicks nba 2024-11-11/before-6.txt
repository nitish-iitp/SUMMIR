NFT: Knicks @ Pacers, 5PM Tip
Jon In NYC : 11/10/2024 1:54 pm
Pacers down to 4-5, including a blowout to our Knicks.

Not sure what's going on with Haliburton, but he's down to 14-7 on the year after averaging 20-11 last year. The scoring you can write off as an aberration, but the assist drop off has been steep and unexpected.

Get after them early, attack Hali whenever we can, and come out with the dub.

Expecting a big Bridges bounce back game.

Sorry if I wasn’t here for beating a 2-8 Bucks team on the second night of a back to back. Do you even think about what you’re writing before you post? Good lord.

I'm not sure about the stats, but we essentially have a 6-man rotation, with Sims and Kolek seeing limited minutes. I'd imagine the starters are getting close to, if not over, 40 minutes a night.



Brunson is playing less minutes than last year..

Towns is at 32

Hart 35

Bridges 37

OG 36..

So really not that crazy, they will probably play a little bit less once either Shamet comes back or Ryan is inserted into the rotation


No, not too crazy, but he should expand the bench. The rotation is too short.

Agreed, i do think he will start to expand it now they are playing more games with only 1 days rest..

To start the season they had a lot of days off

Knicks got to start shooting more 3s  
nygiants16 : 11/10/2024 7:48 pm : link
they are shooting a crazy effecient percentage but they are just not shooting enough 3s..

Tonight Brunson 33 on 17 shots shot 65%
Towns 30 on 19 shots shot 58%
OG 25 on 14 shots shot 64%
Hart 16 58%

they are crazy good offensively but they are losing games becaus eof 3 point shooting, when they win that battle they blow teams out
Making any kind of decisions on a team after 9 games  
Stu11 : 11/10/2024 7:50 pm : link
Of an 82 game season is asinine. They'll be fine. They are missing some interior defense, maybe Mitch can solve that, otherwise they'll hit the trade market. They're still working in 2 new starters into the offense and defense it will take some time. Towns is superb. Once everything starts cooking they are gonna be really really good. I really wanted this one and am annoyed but Indiana always saves their best for us when we come to town. No surprise.

This is a Knicks team that is supposed to compete for an NBA title. Right now, they aren't even a good team.

Towns was traded to the Knicks to play the 5 and model what Boston does offensively. If he moves to the four and Mitch moves to the five, the defense will likely improve but the offense will suffer, and it will defeat the entire purpose of making trading for Towns.

This team has no identity and isn't making enough progress to satisfy me that they're on the right track. In particular, the inability to get stops against the Hawks, Rockets and a depleted Pacers team should alarm any Knicks fan. Teams are doing whatever they want offensively against the Knicks in fourth quarters.
Just stop feeding the troll please.  
Jon In NYC : 11/10/2024 8:14 pm : link
Was out with the in laws, sounds like we collapsed in the second half and just couldn't stop anyone?

Might be more concerned with Bridges' defense than his subpar offense at this point.

They overplayed Haliburton a little bit snd Mathurin got going and then just didnt stop..

Bridges seems like the one guy defensively snd offensively that is playing hesitant..

OG is out there playing like a madman on both sides..

Brunson looked a lot more comfortable picking his spots

Towns was towns..

Bridges seems to be the last guy to find his role
It's about April-May-June,  
Del Shofner : 11/10/2024 8:39 pm : link
not November. I agree that this current Knicks roster has issues. I also think Rose and Thibs get the benefit of the doubt that they'll fix it by next Spring. Precious, Mitch and players not yet on the horizon. The rookies developing.
Precious returning will help a lot  
nygiants16 : 11/10/2024 8:49 pm : link
because he can play the 4 next to Towns and it wont kill your spacing, he is also big enough to help on the boards and protect the paint a little bit..

He will be more effective than Mitch IMO because of his versatility..

Knicks will be fine, some guys are still just thinking to much out there and not just playing, defensively you see it in sourts they will have an elite quarter and then the next it looks like shit..
On offense the Knicks need to stop overpassing and shoot earlier  
LW_Giants : 11/10/2024 9:05 pm : link
In the shit clock. It takes so long for them sometimes to get a shot up. We won’t be the d’antoni seven seconds or less but how about 14 seconds or less. Can’t win when the other team shoots double the number of threes we do.

On defense, Brunson and Hart are killing them. Hart is doing a ton of other stuff well but he’s underratedly been not great on defense. There’s no reason for Mathurin to be as wide open as he was most of this game and that was Hart’s assignment. Towns is still a bit in between on defense which I assume will get better. He’s not sure right now whether to stay with his man or switch.

Thibs teams have consistently had issues defending the three point line and it looks even worse this season because of the number of roster changes. Can’t play inside out if inside isn’t defending well.

None of this is to say it won’t get better, it will. But it’s ugly right now. And Brunson still doesn’t looks right to me. He had a better game today but he’s just so uncomfortable. I don’t know what it is but he just seems unsure out there

Their offense is playing at an elite level right now and it doesnt look it, now imagine what it will look like when they start clicking..

As for Brunson he had 33 and 10 on 65% shooting, i know we all see Brunson take over games and go crazy but we are all saying he looks off and he is 26 and 6 right now on 48% from the field, think about how high of a stabdard we are holding him to..

I actually think Brunson found something the other night vs the Bucks, he looked a lot more comfortable tonight snd he was finding open guys but also scoring at will

I think Hart's poor defense has gone under the radar a lot so far. He's not a good defender. Part of it is he has to take 4s, and he's just too small, but he really has never been a good defender if we're being honest, and I think he only gets that rep because he gets steals and can't shoot, so you figure he can play D. But he's one of the only good NBA players who is a no 3 no D wing.

I basically agree with this. His energy level is great but if you watch just him on defensive possessions it’s a mess and he doesn’t always contest the shooter. I can’t tell you how many times i scream at the tv for him to put his hands up. He just turns and waits for the rebound instead of putting in the extra effort to contest sometimes.

It’s weird bc he does so many little things well, but he leaves a lot to be desired individually on defense.

Bridges  
TyreeHelmet : 11/10/2024 9:31 pm : link
Is whats concerning for me. He just doesn’t look the same on ball hawk defensively you would expect.

I’ve always been a huge fan of the guy and still have hopes. I know it’s 9 games in but I just hate seeing him die on every screen defending Haliburton.

If the Knicks knew they were doing the KAT trade, do they still do the Bridges trade?
For everyone to say wel Pacers went 10 deep  
nygiants16 : 11/10/2024 9:33 pm : link

They were working on the KAT trade around the same time they were working the Bridges trade, they thought they had a deal on drsft night for KAT

No, it's not. In the rest of the games that are finals today, only one starter played 40 minutes. The Knicks have had 2-3 guys play over 40 minutes every game and the other 2-3 play bet. 35 and 40. No other team is playing all their starters like that.

I think so. I think future will prove that we didn't actually give all that much. They have their core locked in for basically all of their picks, and late firsts really aren't worth that much. The Knicks basically gave theirs away this year when push came to shove and traded down for Kolek.

Bridges should be fine. He has a proven extensive history of being a good NBA player. I just want to see Phoenix Defense Bridges + Early Nets Offense Bridges, but he hasn't shown the ability to be elite at both at the same time.

I also think there is another point to make on Bridges which is if he's guarding point guards and spending the high majority of his time on the perimeter, then the 3-4-5 on defense is functionally Hart, OG and KAT. That's a small. 6'4, 6'7, 6'11. It's not stunning they're being beat inside regularly. Precious will really help.

The Pacers had Turner at 39 and Mathurin at 41..

Knicks starters are around 36 minutes per game, Brunson is less and Towns is at 32..

in the celtics game Tatum played 40, Giannis played 39 and so did Taurean prince, Brown played 37 and White played 36

Bam played 38

Starters play big minutes all accross the league but it spreads out as the season goes on, Maxxey was averaging 41

And no it hasnt been every game, nobody is averaging more than 37 and thats Bridges..
I don't have a problem with the minutes so much as  
LW_Giants : 11/10/2024 9:51 pm : link
the lack of creativity with lineups. If something isn't working, change it up.

I still think Hart should come off the bench. I'd also like to see a lineup where Brunson plays with Deuce or Kolek.
This happens with every NBA team  
AROCK1000 : 11/10/2024 9:57 pm : link
When new stars come together on a team.
It usually effects the D more because they don't know instinctively where the other guy will be...
Sprinkle in the injuries and lack of depth and voila...losses.
Winning on the road in the NBA is difficult, especially against playoff caliber teams.

Thibs has been having minimum 2 starters on the floor at all times  
nygiants16 : 11/10/2024 10:06 pm : link
He Takes out Towns and OG together brings in Deuce and Sims..He starts the 2nd with Payne or Kolek, Deuce, OG, Bridges and Towns then Hart comes back for Bridges 3 or 4 minutes in..

I think when Precious comes back Precious will come in for Towns 7 minutes left and when Towns comes back they will keave Precious in and he will come in for Bridges..

That will start to reduce Bridges minutes..

Precious can also sub for OG which will reduce his minutes alittle bit
My only worry right now is Bridges.  
bceagle05 : 11/11/2024 9:35 am : link
Brunson, Towns and OG are excellent players, and Josh Hart is Josh Hart. Bench will get healthier.

When Bridges shoots I get the same feeling I used to get with RJ - no faith at all he’s making it. It’s very strange.
And Bridges’ defense has been bad too.

larryflower37 : 11/11/2024 9:55 am : link
To know this team is going to be a tough out come the playoffs.
Kat iso at the 3pt line vs any center is a mismatch he made Turner look foolish going to the rim.
Bridges seems to be the last starter  
nygiants16 : 11/11/2024 10:03 am : link
to really find his place in the offense and defensively, he seems hesitant still like he doesnt want to step on toes and then there is OG who flys around on defense and offense he is being agressive..

They are elite offensively and they havnt even jelled yet, that tells me they are going to be a great team..

If you look at the losses, they have lost because of hot shooting and whrn a team doesnt grt hot from 3, they blow that team out..

Part of that is their defense needs to be better the other part a team just gets hot like the celtics opening night
I really don't understand the hand wringing over Bridges  
Stu11 : 11/11/2024 11:03 am : link
Yeah his percentages are a bit of his career but not much except maybe 3 point at 31% compared to 37 but it's not like 31 is putrid and that can easily even out in a few weeks. I will say this I tend to be more on the side of NYGiants16 minutes police wise in that I'm not as concerned but Monica McNutt is and I really respect her analysis.

play hard defense and whrn shots come, shots come but jist worry about playing hard defense, rebound, find the open man and take open shots..

The offense will come but if your doing the other things your effectjng the game in a positive way, dont let your offense and trying to fit in make you timid on defense

I'm worried about his defense than offense.


He didn't lose his defense driving over the Brooklyn Bridge. It will be fine once he settled in with this group. He's been an elite defender for 2 different teams.


He didn't have it in Brooklyn either. The thought was "number one option, tough to be the top defender too." But he hasn't been an elite defender for a couple of years now.

Doubt he lost the ability, but it's taking some time.
Itd also hard to go from

basically the number 1 option to the 4th option on some nights, its going to take time for him to find his groove in that role...

He needs to realize that on some nights when Brunson, OG and KAT all have it going that hisnrole that night is to play lockdown defense, Rebound and move the ball and hit open shots and thats it..

He needs to be ok with Josh hart type of stat lines and not worry about how many points he scores, if he plays as hard as Hart does the rest will fall into place..

Look how hard OG plays they arent running offense for him but he is flying around on defense and on offense he is knocking down the open 3 and when he gets a chance to cut he is scoring, and if OG scores 10 points he is still impacting the game..

Brunson and KAT are your 2 scorers, Bridges, Hart and OG have to be ok with getting whats left and impacting the game in other ways and they are all capablr of doing that...Its why RJ failed here he wasnt capable of impacting the game in other areas..

Sims routinely comes in and shits all over the court but keeps getting playing time of Hokporti, and Kolek a bad couple minutes defensively today and never saw the court again



Thibs is infuriating. Same patterns throughout his career as a HC: tight rotations, puts players in his doghouse, stubborn as a mule.
Thibs has to give Matt Ryan

and if Payne is still out trust Kolek a little bit more...I get he wants 2 starters on the floor at all times and he can still do that but just sprrad out the minutes a little bit..

I am not a minutes police guy, but at some point its time to add a guy for at least 10 minutes
