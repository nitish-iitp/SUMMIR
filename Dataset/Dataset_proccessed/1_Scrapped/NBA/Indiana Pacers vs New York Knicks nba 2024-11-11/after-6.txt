Bennedict Mathurin led the Indiana Pacers to a win over the New York Knicks Sunday with 38 points.

The Indiana Pacers had their best performance of the season, beating the New York Knicks 132-121 on Sunday.

Bennedict Mathurin led the Pacers with a career-high 38 points and eight rebounds for the Pacers, who improved to 5-5.

Though the Pacers aren’t leading the league in points like last year, they’re still scoring at high volume – ranking ninth at 116.2 points a game. 

The Pacers have been hit with injuries early in the season. Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith have missed time and Tyrese Haliburton is coming off an injury as well. 

Mathurin has taken advantage of the opportunity and shown flashes of his potential on both ends of the court. Mathurin was promoted to a starting role on Nov. 1, and the numbers are backing his growth: As a starter, Mathurin is averaging 23.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists while logging 35 minutes.

The Pacers still need to work on several areas if they want to repeat the results they accomplished last season. However, they’ve shown why they shouldn’t be counted out.
