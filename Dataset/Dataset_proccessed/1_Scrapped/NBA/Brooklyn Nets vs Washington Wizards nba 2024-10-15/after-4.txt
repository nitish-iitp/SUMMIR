Former Pitt basketball players were all over the court in Monday night’s Brooklyn Nets Vs. Washington Wizards game.

Former Pitt star Bub Carrington earned the first start of his young NBA preseason career in the game. He played 25 minutes in the loss to the Nets, hitting three of his eight field-goal attempts en route to eight points. Carrington went two for three from three-point range, showcasing his pull-up game with this three pointer from the top of the key,.

The three pointer certainly looked familiar, as that pull-up three was a signature move of Carrington’s throughout his one-year tenure at Pitt.

Carrington also added five rebounds, one assist, and one steal in the loss. He committed three fouls and had three turnovers.

This was his not first time playing in Barclays Center — as last year’s Pitt team played against Florida and Oregon State there.

Former Panther Justin Champagnie also played in the game for the Wizards. Champagnie played just under 15 minutes, scoring six points and grabbing five rebounds. The Brooklyn native had three offensive rebounds in his return to his home neighborhood.

Another former Panther, Mo Gueye, recently signed an exhibit 10 deal with the Wizards as well, joining forces with Carrington and Champagnie. Gueye did not play in Monday night’s preseason game.
