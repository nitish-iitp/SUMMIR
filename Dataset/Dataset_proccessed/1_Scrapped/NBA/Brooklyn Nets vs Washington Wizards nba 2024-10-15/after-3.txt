Ben Simmons versus Kyle Kuzma was one of the interesting matchups leading to Monday’s game between the Washington Wizards and Brooklyn Nets. Simmons, a two-time All-NBA Defensive team member, against a versatile scorer had the makings of a good showdown. The two promptly took on each other after tip-off.

With a little under eight minutes in the first quarter, the Wizards attacked the Nets defense in transition. Simmons lost his footing and fell when Kuzma faked a drive. The “ooh” of the Nets’ home fans reverberated inside the Barclays Center when “Big Ben” was wiped off the scene.

Kyle Kuzma, however, air-balled a wide-open 3-pointer that had the crowd booing the Wizards star. Fans on X, formerly Twitter, reacted to the sequence:

"Ben Simmons being Ben Simmons and Kuzma being Kuzma. NBA is back," said another fan, along with a GIF of former NFL star Terrell Owens.

"Hasn’t he had like 6 airballs in 2 games lmao?" said another fan, pointing out Kuzma's shooting struggles in a previous preseason game.

@playoffskee declared:

“Man sold the highlight of his career”

One fan gave a prediction:

“Might be the worst play of the year”

Another fan said what most must have been thinking:

“This going platinum on Shaqtin a Fool”

Kuzma’s fake to go left before stopping forced Simmons to fall. But as he has done a couple of times in the preseason, the former Laker didn’t even hit the rim. Dennis Schroder grabbed the rebound and pushed the ball for a fastbreak opportunity. Cam Johnson returned the favor by also missing a wide-open 3-pointer.

Ben Simmons played better than Kyle Kuzma in Nets' blowout win

Ben Simmons may have been on the wrong end of that highlight against Kyle Kuzma, but he got the last laugh as his Brooklyn Nets blew out the Washington Wizards, 131-92.

Simmons played 13 minutes and finished with 11 points, five rebounds, three coming from the offensive glass, and two assists. The Australian could have had more dimes had his teammates been more efficient with their shots.

Meanwhile, Kyle Kuzma struggled all night for the Washington Wizards. He saw action for 25 minutes and tallied seven points on 3-for-12 shooting, including 0-for-6 from behind the arc. He also contributed six rebounds, four assists and one steal. The Wizards were outscored by 18 points when he was on the floor.

Simmons fell on the floor in the first quarter while guarding Kuzma. In limited minutes, the Nets star outplayed his Wizards counterpart.
