Luka Doncic came out on fire, putting up 32 points, snagging nine rebounds, and dishing seven assists as the Dallas Mavericks stormed to a 108-85 victory against the Orlando Magic.

Doncic set the tone early, scoring 14 in the first quarter alone, giving Dallas a solid 30-22 lead.

By halftime, the 25-year-old Slovenian had racked up 25 points, including five from beyond the arc, pushing the Mavericks to a comfortable 65-40 advantage. 

“Today was real fun. We were guarding everybody, defending, rebounding, playing with a lot of pace. So that's fun for me.”

Dallas kept their foot on the gas in the second half, building a massive 33-point lead by the fourth. 

Daniel Gafford stepped up with a season-high 18 points, while Kyrie Irving added 17, and rookie Dereck Lively II posted a double-double with 11 points and 11 boards.

It was a tough night for the Magic, who struggled from deep, hitting just 8 of 41 three-pointers.

Already down three straight, they’re also missing their All-Star Paolo Banchero, sidelined with an abdominal injury that will keep him out for at least four weeks.
