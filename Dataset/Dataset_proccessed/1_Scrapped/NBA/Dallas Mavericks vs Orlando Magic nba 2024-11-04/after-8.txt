A Monday you simply can’t miss…

All 30 teams will take the floor tonight ahead of Election Day on Tuesday, when the league takes a break to encourage everyone to get out and vote.

Starting at 7 ET, fans can dive into nonstop action with a game tipping off every 15 minutes on League Pass. Fans can also catch all the top moments on CrunchTime, which delivers whiparound coverage throughout the night.

1. LUKA MAGIC: DONČIĆ SPARKS DALLAS EARLY & OFTEN

In Thursday’s loss to the Rockets, Luka Dončić went 3-of-8 from the field and 0-of-2 from 3 in the 1st quarter as Houston jumped out to a 34-21 lead on their way to a wire-to-wire win.

After the game, Dončić shouldered the responsibility, pointing to his slow starts.

“That’s me. I’m just starting pretty tough, pretty bad. So I’ll take the blame because I got to do way better than that.”

In the Mavs’ very next game, Luka started anything but slow, dropping 25 points in the 1st half with five 3s, five boards and five dimes to build Dallas a 65-40 lead that it never relinquished, improving the reigning West champs to 4-2 with a 108-85 win over Franz Wagner (13 pts, 6 reb, 6 ast) and the Magic. | Recap

1st-Quarter Fire: Dončić’s big night began with 14 points, five boards and three assists in the opening frame, stamped by a buzzer-beating scoop shot to put Dallas up eight
All Dončić, All Dallas: Luka finished the game with 32 points (11-22 FG), nine boards and seven helpers in just 31 minutes, while Daniel Gafford (18 pts, 8 reb), Kyrie Irving (17 pts, 3 ast, 2 stl) and Dereck Lively II (11 pts, 11 reb) joined him in double figures

The Luka Spark: It’s Dončić’s 30th career game with 25+ points in the 1st half. In those games, the Mavs are 22-8. And Luka’s early impact doesn’t stop there.

Early Buckets: In games where Dončić has scored 14+ points in the 1st quarter, the Mavericks are 44-19
Early Involvement: In games where Luka’s recorded 10+ points, 5+ rebounds and 3+ assists in the 1st quarter, the Mavs are 24-5
Early Triples: In games where he’s hit 5+ 3s in the 1st half, the Mavs are 15-2
On Sunday, Dončić eclipsed all three metrics, and Dallas earned its largest win of the season
Luka On The Key To Sunday’s Win: “Just being myself. Just playing basketball and having fun out there. Today was real fun.”

2. HAWKS & PISTONS SURGE LATE TO EARN ROAD DUBS

After opening the season 2-0, the Hawks entered Sunday on a four-game slide.

But last night in New Orleans, they refused to be denied.

Hawks 126, Pelicans 111: Brandon Ingram dropped a game-high 32 points, and the Pelicans led 59-58 at the half. But then Jalen Johnson (29 pts, 9 reb, 8 ast) and Trae Young (23 pts, 12 ast, 5 3s) took over and fueled a 24-8 Hawks run in the 4th quarter to secure their third win of the season. | Recap

Game On Ice: Young (17 pts, 7 ast) and Johnson (16 pts, 5 ast) combined for 33 points and 12 dimes in the 2nd half, as Atlanta took an eight-point lead into the 4th before slamming the door shut
Stat Stuffer: Johnson tied a career-high in points while adding two steals and two blocks on the defensive end
Risacher Spotlight: This year’s No. 1 overall pick, Zaccharie Risacher (11 pts, 5 reb, 3 stl) contributed on both ends as well, highlighted by this steal and slam
Atlanta Inside: With Zion Williamson sidelined due to hamstring soreness, Atlanta won the points in the paint battle 66-32

Pistons 106, Nets 92: After trailing 57-52 at the break, Cade Cunningham (19 pts, 6 reb, 5 ast) helped the Pistons (2-5) outscore the Nets 54-35 in the 2nd half while holding Brooklyn (3-4) to just 15 points in the 4th quarter to pull away for a road dub. | Recap

Sharing The Wealth: Tobias Harris and Malik Beasley added 18 points apiece, Jalen Duren (13 pts, 17 reb) notched a double-double and six total Pistons scored in double figures
Brooklyn’s Buckets: Cameron Johnson scored a game-high 26 points, including 22 in the 1st half, while Cam Thomas added 17. Brooklyn fell to 3-4 with the loss
Detroit Detour: With the NYC Marathon filling the streets, the Pistons rode the subway to get to Barclays Center

3. WEEKEND REWIND: WOLVES HOWL, DUOS DOMINATE, 2 UNBEATENS REMAIN

The second weekend of the 2024-25 season came packed with storylines. Catch up on the key moments below in under two minutes.

Friday

Wolves Rally In Game 7 Rematch: Down seven with 2:30 left, Anthony Edwards (29 pts, 7 3s) ignited a 10-0 unanswered Wolves run to stun Nikola Jokić (26 pts, 9 reb, 13 ast) and the Nuggets, 119-116, in the two sides first meeting since Game 7 of the 2024 West Semifinals.

AD & LeBron Shine In Toronto: LeBron James (27 pts, 10 ast) became the oldest player in NBA history to record 25+ points and 10+ assists while committing zero turnovers in a game, while Anthony Davis added 38 points and 11 boards to lead the Lakers past the Raptors.

Brunson & KAT Cook: Jalen Brunson dropped a season-high 36 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns (21 pts, 11 reb, 7 ast) stuffed the stat sheet to lead the Knicks to a wire-to-wire win over the Pistons.

Saturday

Spida Calls Game: Damian Lillard (41 pts, 9 ast, 10 3s) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (34 pts, 16 reb, 9 ast) combined for 75 points for the Bucks, but Donovan Mitchell (30 pts) sank a go-ahead jumper with 0.3 seconds left to improve the Cavs to 7-0.

OKC Stays Perfect: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (25 pts, 9 ast) and the Thunder outscored the Clippers 52-35 in the 2nd half to earn their first 6-0 start since moving to Oklahoma City ahead of the 2008-09 season. The Thunder and the Cavs enter Monday as the only remaining undefeated teams.

No. 15 Flies Forever: On the night Vince Carter saw his No. 15 Raptors jersey retired and raised into the Scotiabank Arena rafters, the Raptors earned an overtime win over the Kings behind RJ Barrett’s third-straight 30-point game.

4. MARATHON MONDAY: 30 TEAMS, 15 GAMES, 1 NIGHT

Buckle up for a full-court frenzy of hoops, with all 30 teams taking the floor tonight.

Monday’s 15-game slate includes nonstop action from 7 ET past midnight, with a game tipping off every 15 minutes, allowing fans to catch the last few minutes of every game on NBA TV, League Pass or CrunchTime, which delivers around-the-league coverage from the night’s top action.

Of the 93 total games played this season, 39 have featured clutch time. And to tip off tonight’s slate, we’ll get a rematch of Saturday’s thriller between the Bucks and the undefeated Cavs.

Bucks at Cavaliers (7 ET, NBA TV/LP): Will Cleveland match its best start in franchise history at 8-0 (set in 1976-77), or will Milwaukee (1-5) get its revenge from Saturday night’s last-second loss?

Warriors at Wizards (7:15 ET, LP): At 5-1, Buddy Hield (51.7 3P% on 5.0 3PA) and the Warriors will look to extend their three-game win streak against the 2-3 Wizards, who are looking to rebound after a loss in Saturday’s Mexico City Game.

Lakers at Pistons (7:30 ET, LP): On Friday, Anthony Davis joined Shaquille O’Neal as the only Lakers to average 30+ points, 10+ rebounds and 2+ blocks over the first six games of a season (since blocks and steals were first recorded in 1973-74). Will he stay hot against the Pistons?

Celtics at Hawks (7:45 ET, LP): Last year, the Hawks were one of just four teams to beat the Celtics twice, as the two sides split their regular-season series 2-2. Atlanta took the last two matchups, and the home team won every game.

Grizzlies at Nets (8 ET, LP): Led by Dennis Schröder’s season-high 33 points, the Nets (3-4) beat Ja Morant and the 4-3 Grizzlies, 119-106, on Wednesday. Who will take Round 2?

Kings at Heat (8:15 ET, LP): In a matchup between former college teammates, De’Aaron Fox (23.5 ppg) and Malik Monk will face fellow Kentucky Wildcat Bam Adebayo and the Heat. Miami’s leading scorer this season? Tyler Herro (20.8 ppg), who also played for Big Blue.

Jazz at Bulls (8:30 ET, LP): Seeking their first win of the season, Lauri Markkanen (18.0 ppg, 7.3 rpg) and the Jazz will visit Chicago to take on Zach LaVine (22.7 ppg, 5.5 rpg) and the Bulls (3-3) at the United Center.

Knicks at Rockets (8:45 ET, LP): New York (3-2) has won two straight and its starting five has all scored in double figures in four straight games for the first time since the 1988-89 season. Can they do it again versus Jalen Green and the 3-3 Rockets?

5. MONDAY CONTINUES: OKC SEEKS 7-0 START + PG’S PHILLY DEBUT?

The action keeps coming as seven games tip off after 9 ET, including Paul George’s potential Sixers debut (per reports) and a matchup between the Thunder and Magic as OKC looks to keep its perfect record intact.

Hornets at Timberwolves (9 ET, LP): In a showdown featuring two players ranked in the top 10 in scoring and the top three in 3s, Anthony Edwards (28.3 ppg, league-leading 5.3 3s) and the Wolves will host LaMelo Ball (30.2 ppg, 5.0 3s) and the Hornets.

Magic at Thunder (9:15 ET, LP): Standing with the Cavs as the league’s only remaining unbeaten teams, the Thunder will seek their first 7-0 start since 1993-94 (when they were the Sonics) against the Magic, who are playing on the second leg of a back-to-back.

Trail Blazers at Pelicans (9:30 ET, LP): In what could be his third 30+ point game in five outings, Brandon Ingram will lead the 3-4 Pelicans against Anfernee Simons and the Blazers (2-5) as New Orleans looks to bounce back from Sunday’s loss.

Pacers at Mavericks (9:45 ET, LP): In a matchup between two 2024 Conference Finalists, Luka Dončić and the Mavs (4-2) will look to win their second game in two days as they host Tyrese Haliburton and the Pacers (2-4).

Raptors at Nuggets (10 ET, LP): Riding three straight games with 25+ points, 9+ rebounds and 9+ assists, highlighted by a historic triple-double, Nikola Jokić will look to lift the Nuggets (3-3) above .500 for the first time this season as they host the Raptors.

76ers at Suns (10:15 ET, NBA TV/LP): After missing the first five games of the season with a bone bruise in his left knee (which he suffered during a preseason game), nine-time All-Star Paul George (questionable) could make his 76ers debut against Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and the 5-1 Suns, who have won four straight games.

Spurs at Clippers (10:30 ET, LP): To close the night, the Clippers’ all-time assists leader, Chris Paul, will face his former team as he and Victor Wembanyama lead the Spurs (3-3) against James Harden and LA (2-4), with the Clips seeking their first win at the Intuit Dome.
