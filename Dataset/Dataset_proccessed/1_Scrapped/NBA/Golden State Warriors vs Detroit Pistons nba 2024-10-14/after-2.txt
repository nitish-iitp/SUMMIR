The Detroit Pistons vs Golden State Warriors preseason matchup was the penultimate game for Sunday night. The Pistons visited the Chase Center looking to win their third game of the preseason, while the Warriors are trying to stay undefeated.

Detroit tried another different lineup, making one change from their previous starting five. Malik Beasley started in place of Tim Hardaway Jr., while Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren and Tobias Harris remained. The first three are the only players to start all preseason games so far for the Pistons.

Meanwhile, the Warriors also used another starting lineup with Steph Curry (finger) and Draymond Green (rest) ruled out. Brandin Podziemski and De'Anthony Melton get another shot at proving to Steve Kerr that they deserve to start. Jonathan Kuminga and Trayce Jackson-Davis were also back as starters.
