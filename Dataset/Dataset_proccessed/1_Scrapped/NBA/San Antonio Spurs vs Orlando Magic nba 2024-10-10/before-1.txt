Cavs Lose Preseason Opener To Bulls, 116-112

On Tuesday October 8th, 2024, at 7:30 pm eastern time, the Cleveland Cavaliers opened their NBA preseason hosting the Chicago Bulls at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse. This game was much anticipated by Cavaliers fans. This is because they wanted to get a preview of the team’s new system and that is implemented by the new head coach Kenny Atkinson. After a disappointing loss in the eastern conference semifinals to the Boston Celtics in the 2024 playoffs. The Cleveland Cavaliers front office felt it was time to make a change at head coach. After the first game the team appears to be working out some kinks before the season starts on October 23rd, 2024, in Toronto.

I usually don’t put too much stock in exhibition season for any sport. But what I look for is execution and fundamentals being sound. The Cavaliers scored 67 points in the first half and only 45 points in the second half. Keep in mind star players like Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, Darius Garland, and Jarrett Allen only played 19 minutes in the game. So, it is safe to say that this score of 116-112 is not an indicator of how the regular season will turn out for the Cavaliers. Also, most of the Chicago Bulls starters and stars played sparingly too. The question is what the next step for this Cleveland Cavaliers team?

The next preseason game for the Cavaliers is Thursday October 10th,2024, 7 pm eastern at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse against the Indiana Pacers. I would expect more of same with starters and star players playing limited minutes for both teams. However, Cleveland Cavaliers fans can watch for the team to build upon the last game. For this team and their new coach each game is step up a ladder. And hopefully at the top of that ladder is a Larry O’Brien Trophy.
