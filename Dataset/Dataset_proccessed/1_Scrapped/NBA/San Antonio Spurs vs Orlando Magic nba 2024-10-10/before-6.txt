Victor Wembanyama starred for the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday in a preseason game against the Orlando Magic. The reigning Rookie of the Year winner had three points, three rebounds, two assists, and one block in seven minutes in the first quarter. San Antonio had a sluggish start as “Wemby,” Chris Paul, Harrison Barnes, and Jeremy Sochan had rough-shooting nights.

Wembanyama bounced back in the second quarter with four early points. He had a 17-foot pull-up jumper before getting a lob from Chris Paul, forcing Orlando to a timeout. The Frenchman’s basket cut Orlando’s lead to 39-27 after trailing the first period, 30-24.

San Antonio played with more cohesion in the second frame. The Spurs dealt much better with Orlando's defense, which sometimes double-teamed "Wemby" in a preseason game.

Wembanyama played a little over four minutes in the third quarter before San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich relieved the center for good. He took three more shots, all 3-pointers and missed them.

He also took a hit on the knee from Magic forward Franz Wagner, so the Spurs’ decision to limit his minutes wasn’t surprising.

Victor Wembanyama's chemistry with new Spurs is a work in progress

Chris Paul, Harrison Barnes, and rookie Stephon Castle, players with significant minutes on Wednesday, weren’t with the San Antonio Spurs last season. The trio has to adjust to playing around Victor Wembanyama and vice versa.

Paul had a nifty pass to Wembanyama that resulted in a highlight-reel dunk but their pick-and-roll dance needed some work. There were instances Wembanyama couldn't roll well, allowing the defense to collapse on them.

CP3 also has to learn to play alongside Castle. When they were on the floor together, it seemed like the rookie was uncertain what to do.

In one play in the second quarter, Paul passed the ball to Castle late in the shot clock. The former UConn star promptly looked for Wembanyama before floating a pass that even the 7-foot-4 center couldn’t reach.

Barnes’ timing with Wembanyama and Castle also needs to improve. There were instances when the Frenchman kept urging the veteran forward to cut or pop out for better spacing in the post.

The San Antonio Spurs have three more preseason games after the matchup with the Orlando Magic. They will need every one of those games to get their rhythm as a unit.
