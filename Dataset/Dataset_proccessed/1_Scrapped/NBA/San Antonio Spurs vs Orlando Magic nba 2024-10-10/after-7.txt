"He might be the goat": Fans in awe of Victor Wembanyama after Spurs superstar unleashes two-handed dunk with "unstoppable" move(Source: Imagn)

Basketball fans were buzzing after Victor Wembanyama put on an impressive display of his offensive bag in one of the possessions during the San Antonio Spurs' 107-97 win over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. Early in the third quarter, the French phenom received a pass from Chris Paul while positioned beyond the arc.

Wembanyama faked a 3-pointer, sending the defender flying, before taking a dribble, three steps and finishing with a powerful two-handed slam. The crowd inside the arena erupted following the reigning Rookie of the Year's highlight-worthy play that added two easy points for the Spurs.

One fan predicted that Wembanyama will dominate the NBA, winning every major individual award in every season he plays.

"Gonna collect MVP, MIP, DPOY like infinity stones every season.

One X user humorously pointed out how teams might defend Wembanyama in the future.

"in 5 years teams are gonna have to start sending their worst player out to beat his ass for a good 4 seconds before the refs stop him to have a chance, and its lowkey a good plan."
"Euro step from three???? How do you even stop that. How is this even possible," wrote another fan.

Rough shooting night for Victor Wembanyama

Despite the impressive offensive skill on display, Victor Wembanyama didn't have his sharpest shooting performance during the game. Having missed the Spurs' first preseason matchup, the star appeared a bit rusty against the Orlando Magic. However, the French sensation still delivered a few highlight-reel moments throughout the contest.

Wembanyama logged 23 minutes and scored 11 points on 4-of-15 shooting from the field, including 0-of-5 from beyond the arc. He also contributed nine rebounds, four assists, and three blocks.

With the Spurs adding veteran point guard Chris Paul, Wembanyama is poised for a dominant regular season ahead. His next appearance will be on Saturday when the Spurs take on the Utah Jazz.
