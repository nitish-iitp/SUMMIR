Utah Jazz vs Orlando Magic Prediction

The Orlando Magic are as injured as any team in the league, but they continue to find ways to win and cover numbers. The Magic are also 13-4 SU at home. The Utah Jazz are on the end of a back-to-back, and they're in a letdown spot after a surprising blowout win over the Heat. The Magic usually beat up on teams they're supposed to beat up on, and I doubt this Orlando defensive pressure is what the Jazz want with their second game in two days. I'm not a believer in the Jazz, especially on the road and without the rest advantage. Obviously no Suggs, Wagner, Banchero, and others don't help, but the Magic are still big favorites with those injuries. The Jazz are awful. Give me the Magic.
