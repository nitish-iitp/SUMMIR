Timberwolves’ Anthony Edwards Rips Refs, Fined $75,000: ‘F—ing Terrible’

Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards was hit with his third fine of the season on Monday after going off on the officiating of the Timberwolves’ 113-103 loss to the Golden State Warriors.

“F—ing terrible, all of ’em, besides the woman,” Edwards told reporters. “But the other two dudes, terrible. Excuses, the reason they call the foul, the reason they don’t call the foul, the s— was terrible. They don’t want to talk back to my coach. They don’t want to talk back to me. I said one thing to the ref, and he gave me a tech. Motherf—er told one of my teammates [that] if I would have said, ‘Y’all calling a bad foul,’ he wouldn’t have gave me a tech…. They never give us the benefit – they penalize me and [Julius Randle] for being stronger than our opponent every night. We don’t get no calls. So, yeah, that’s how I feel about the officials. Every game that we play.”

Edwards disparaged the officiating throughout the season, claiming that it’s discouraged himself and his teammates from attacking the basket. “I get penalized for being stronger than my opponent,” he complained.

Edwards was also fined $40,000 for “repeatedly criticizing the officiating” last season, following a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

“So I don’t know what’s gotta go down,” he said, discussing what he characterized as consistently bad officiating, “But something gotta happen ’cause that s— is terrible.”
