The New York Knicks play host to the Washington Wizards at Madison Square Garden on Monday night. Here’s a Washington Wizards vs New York Knicks Prediction. This article will include a Washington Wizards vs New York Knicks Pick.
Washington Wizards 

The Washington Wizards have been in terrible form as they've lost 10 of their first 12 games and they will be hoping to snap an eight-game losing streak after getting thrashed by the Pistons in a 124-104 home loss last night. Kyle Kuzma led the team with 22 points on 10 of 14 shooting, Jordan Poole added 22 points with five assists on eight of 16 shooting while Bilal Coulibaly chipped in with 15 points on six of nine shooting. As a team, the Wizards shot 47 percent from the field and 12 of 27 from the 3-point line as they played hard just to keep the margin within single digits, only to get blown out in the third quarter where the Pistons poured in 37 points to put the game to bed early. 

New York Knicks 

Meanwhile, the New York Knicks have been a team on the rise as they've won four of their last six games overall and they will be aiming for a third straight victory after beating the Nets in a 114-104 loss last night. Karl-Anthony Towns led the team with 26 points, 15 rebounds, and six assists, OG Anunoby added 24 points, Mikal Bridges tallied 21 points on nine of 18 shooting while Josh Hart chipped in with 20 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. As a team, the Knicks shot 48 percent from the field and 13 of 40 from the 3-point line as they jumped out to an early lead and just kept their foot on the gas until they led by 15 points in the fourth quarter. The Knicks bench combined for just 11 points but they got plenty of scoring from their starters who all finished in double figures in scoring. The Knicks will meet the Suns after this game.

Washington Wizards vs New York Knicks Prediction

The Wizards are still a little shorthanded with Bilal Coulibaly listed as day-to-day, while the Knicks are starting to hit their groove now and they will be brimming with confidence after taking down the Nets twice in a row. This is an obvious mismatch with the struggling Wizards coming into this one after eight straight losses, compared to the Knicks who are starting to heat up now. The line is a little bigger than I had predicted, but the more I look at this matchup, the more I believe that the Knicks are going to win big at home.
