Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best choices on Monday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Cade Cunningham (DET, PG)	$20,750	50.2	2.4
Value	Quentin Grimes (DAL, SG/SF)	$6,000	22.3	3.7
Fade	P.J. Washington (DAL, PF)	$10,950	15.2	1.4
Cheapie	Dario Šarić (DEN, C/PF)	$9,080	33.2	3.7

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Monday teams, consider starting with a value player like Quentin Grimes. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Cade Cunningham is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Dario Šarić.

On the other hand, according to our model, P.J. Washington is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
