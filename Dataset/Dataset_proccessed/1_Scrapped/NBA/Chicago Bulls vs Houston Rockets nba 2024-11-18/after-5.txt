Jack Trehearne has been writing about the Bucks independently since 2022, and joined Brew Hoop in 2024.

The Milwaukee Bucks will attempt to cool down the red-hot Houston Rockets tonight. With Damian Lillard set to return, this game will serve as a barometer of where the Bucks are in the young season. The Rockets have won five straight and are looking to sweep their back-to-back, coming off last night’s thumping of the Chicago Bulls.

Check out the full preview here, then follow along below on Playback and on Twitter. As always, go Bucks!
