The Houston Rockets are 10-4. They've won five straight, and they're just one game out of first in the NBA Western Conference. Yes, it's still early in the season, but has this franchise officially turned the corner on its rebuild? Are the Rockets... good? Even... really good?

In the audio above, we discuss with Houston Press writer and Bleav in Astros podcast co-host Jeff Balke, who tempers our excitement a bit. Balke notes the Rockets have lost to stiffer competition while beating up on largely inferior teams. Still, he admits they’re an exciting team to watch.

We also preview tonight’s Monday Night Football matchup between the 6-4 Houston Texans and the 3-6 Dallas Cowboys.
