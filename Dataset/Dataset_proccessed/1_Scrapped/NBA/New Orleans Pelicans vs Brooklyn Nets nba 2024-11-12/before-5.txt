NBA Player Props Predictions: Dennis Schroder Brooklyn Nets Over 5.5 Assists (-125) DK

Dennis Schroder has recorded 6+ assists in 7 of his 10 games this season while averaging 12 potential assists per game.

The New Orleans Pelicans allow the 6th most assists both to opposing point guards (9.8game) and overall (27.9/game). Schroder has seen a consistent 35+ minutes per game this season and he’s played 37 minutes in back-to-back games.

Coach Fernandez decided to bring Ben Simmons in of the bench last game and that resulted in staggered minutes with Schroder as they only shared the court for 11 minutes.

That’s great for Schroder assists-wise as he has a +5.42% assist rate differential with Simmons off the court. This a great spot to back Schroder on Monday night.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Evan Mobley Cleveland Cavaliers Over 16.5 Points (-125) FD

Evan Mobley has cleared this line in 5 of his last 8 games including 23-point efforts in back-to-back games while averaging 18.4 points per game on the season.

The Chicago Bulls allow the 2nd most points to opposing power forwards with 28.3 per game and 4th most points overall with just shy of 120 points per game.

More importantly, they allow the 2nd most field goals per game in the restricted area where Mobley scores 70% of his points.

The Bulls also play at the fastest pace in the league, and we have a total sitting at 237 with Cleveland favored by 8.

Mobley also scored 25 points in 42 minutes in his last head-to-head game with Chicago. Look for Mobley to score plenty of points slashing to basket while eclipsing this total.
