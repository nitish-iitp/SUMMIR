LOS ANGELES LAKERS
LeBron James Floors NBA Fans with 3rd Straight Triple-Double at Age 39 in Lakers' Win

LeBron James is 39 years old and into his 22nd season in the NBA. And he's still capable of leaving fans at a loss for words thanks to his individual brilliance.

James had 35 points, 12 rebounds and 14 assists as the Los Angeles Lakers earned a 128-123 win over the Memphis Grizzlies,

Anthony Davis dropped 21 points and 14 rebounds, while Dalton Knecht was impactful off the bench by shooting 5-of-5 from beyond the arc en route to a 19-point night.

This was LeBron's third straight triple-double and fourth on the season, which is the second-most in the league behind the Denver Nuggets' Nikola Jokic.

"I'm just living in the moment," he told reporters of continuing to collect triple-doubles at this point in his career. "It feels good to be able to go out and play the game that I love at a high level still. And every night I step out on the floor, I try to help our team be successful in any way, shape, form or fashion. So, in that sense it's pretty cool."

As one would expect, the praise toward James was overflowing on social media:

I hate that I have to say this every time. But Lebron James is simply the greatest basketball player of all time. It's nothing your fav player can say or do to change that

You've never watched a player greater than LeBron James in your life—if you think you have, you're just kidding yourself.

LeBron with another night where I can't believe this is really happening. Not just the stat line but the effort, especially in the 4th.

LeBron James recorded his first career 30-point triple-double on April 9, 2005. He recorded his 40th career 30-point triple-double tonight, 19 years later. <br><br>There are 30 players in the NBA that weren't alive when he recorded his first.

Congrats to LeBron James for a 3rd straight triple double at nearly 40 years of age.

Lebron will retire with 100 hours of highlights we'll never be able to properly sift through it all.

As the cliché goes, genius is never understood in its own time.

James is considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time and perhaps the only serious challenger to Michael Jordan's status as the greatest. Even still, fans might look back in a few years and come to feel they didn't fully appreciate what the four-time MVP continues to do at a time when past legends have either slowed down or retired altogether.

LeBron isn't the player he was 10 or 15 years ago, yet he remains capable of putting his team on his back on a given night and carrying it to victory. Regardless of whether the Lakers go on to win a title or even make a deep playoff run, just sit back and enjoy the ride.
