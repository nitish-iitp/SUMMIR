FanDuel NBA Promo Offer: Two 30% Profit Boosts for NBA Games on 11/13/24
FANDUEL STAFF
2mo

The NBA is back, and FanDuel Sportsbook has plenty of ways to get in on the action. To celebrate a loaded Wednesday slate, FanDuel Sportsbook has a special promotion for ALL customers.

All customers get TWO 30% Profit Boost Tokens (one for a 3+ leg SGP/SGP+ and one for a 2+ leg "To Record a Double-Double" SGP/SGP+/Parlay wager) for NBA games taking place on November 13th, 2024!

Wednesday's slate tips off at 7:10pm ET when the Indiana Pacers take on the Orlando Magic. Both sides sit at .500 just a few weeks into the season, but Indiana already took one from Orlando earlier this month. Even so, the Magic are -112 moneyline favorites as of Wednesday afternoon. The total is set at 223.5.

Full Pacers-Magic odds can be found below.

Davis has the shortest odds to record a double-double (-370) in this game, followed by James at -135 and Pippen at +500.
