No. 1 ranked Pitt looks to stay undefeated against SMU in women’s college volleyball on Wednesday.

This season No. 1 ranked Pitt (14-0) has been the best overall team in women’s college volleyball. The Panthers have four wins against ranked teams and have firmly secured themselves as the best team in the country. They take on Southern Methodist University (12-3), who is looking to become the first team to give the Panthers a loss this season. The Mustangs are playing the best volleyball of the season heading into this match, winning seven straight matches. This season they are 3-1 against ranked teams, including a win against second ranked Nebraska (3-0). A win Wednesday would give the Mustangs wins against teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the country.
