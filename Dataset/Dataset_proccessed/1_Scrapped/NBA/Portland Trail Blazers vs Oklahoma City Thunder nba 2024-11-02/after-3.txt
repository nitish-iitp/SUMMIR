The Trail Blazers shot 47 percent from the field and made 15 of 35 (42.9 percent) from behind the arc.

The Thunder dominated the third quarter, outscoring Portland 38-17 to turn a tie game at halftime into a 21-point lead for the visitors.

Alex Caruso’s basket capped a 9-0 spurt as Oklahoma City led 89-78 with 3:56 remaining in the quarter.

Later, Wallace knocked down a 3-pointer and Gilgeous-Alexander followed with four straight points to end a 23-5 surge as the Thunder held a 103-83 lead with 24.1 seconds to go.

A buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Dieng gave Oklahoma City a 106-85 edge entering the final stanza.

The Thunder scored nine of the first 11 points of the fourth quarter with Ajay Mitchell’s trey making it 115-87 with 9:17 left in the game and Oklahoma City cruised to the finish.

The Thunder led by as many as 17 in the first quarter before the score was knotted at 68 at the break.

Gilgeous-Alexander scored 18 in the half and Williams added 17 for the Thunder. Grant had 14 first-half points for Portland.
