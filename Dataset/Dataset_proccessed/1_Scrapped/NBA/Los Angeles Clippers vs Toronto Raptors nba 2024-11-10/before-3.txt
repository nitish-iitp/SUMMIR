JJ Redick: Lakers Need To Start Game With More Pride Defensively
Originally posted on Lakers Nation  |  By Daniel Starkand  |  Last updated Nov 5, 2024 11:10 AM ET

After a 3-0 start to the season under new head coach JJ Redick, the Los Angeles Lakers have come crashing down to earth on their road trip, losing three of four.

Their last loss was particularly disappointing as they went down by 20 to the Detroit Pistons in the first half and were never able to climb out of that hole, falling 115-103.

When asked about his takeaway from the loss, Redick pointed to the Lakers’ poor defense in the first quarter, via Spectrum SportsNet:

“Probably have a few takeaways but I would say if there was one thing it’s just that you need to start the game with a little more just pride defensively. We talked this morning about how [the Pistons] are a much different team obviously than last year and they play really hard and they try to get up and down, move you in the halfcourt. I thought our effort and just fight in the second half was really good. That third quarter defensively was I think in some ways just a blueprint for us. It wasn’t perfect but in terms of effort was really good.”

While Redick didn’t like how the Lakers started the game, he was pleased with how they played in the second half to get themselves back in it:

“Our effort to get back, even after a miss, was better. Our physicality was better. Our shifts were better at times in the second half, just loading up on the basketball. They started the game and played that way for four quarters, just really physical on both ends. We matched that in the second half but it took us a bit in the first half to match that level of physicality.”

The Lakers were able to cut their deficit to five, but that was as close as they would get. Redick did not sugarcoat the demeanor in the locker room after losing a game that everyone feels they should have been able to win:

“We’re all disappointed. We’re all disappointed.”

The Lakers will close out their road trip on Wednesday against the Memphis Grizzlies, which is another team that will be ready to out-hustle and outwork them if they do not bring energy from the jump.

LeBron James: Lakers didn’t match Pistons’ physicality

When discussing the loss to the Pistons, LeBron James essentially echoed head coach JJ Redick in saying the Lakers did not match their physicality.

“Of course. We definitely have to match physicality depending on whatever game is being played, we have to match that. I don’t think we did that, as a unit we didn’t do a good job in the first half. In the second half we did, but we were already down 14 at half.”

Michael Jordan ‘would have been fine’ if Bulls traded Scottie Pippen…

According to Hall of Fame writer Sam Smith, NBA legend Michael Jordan “would have been fine” if the Chicago Bulls traded Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant for Buck Williams and Walter Davis. The Bulls drafted Jordan in 1984 and acquired Pippen and Grant in 1987. Chicago didn’t reach the NBA Finals until 1991, which frustrated Jordan. “He actually wanted different teammates; he wanted more veterans,” Smith told Alex Kennedy of HoopsHype. “He would have been fine with [Scottie] Pippen and [Horace] Grant getting traded for Buck Williams and Walter Davis – two ACC guys he liked since they were veterans who were more accomplished. That’s who we wanted to play with. He wanted guys to match [James] Worthy and Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] with the Lakers and [Robert] Parish and [Kevin] McHale with the Celtics. He didn’t want to play with babies and so that was a source of frustration. As we’ve seen witnessed in this documentary and which we knew, he has this incredible manic competitiveness to the level that he wants to embarrass his opponent. A lot of players feel sorry for their opponent when they’re dominating; Jordan never did. He wanted to run it up. He was like one of those southern college football coaches who want to win 92-0. That’s his mentality.” It’s a good thing the Bulls didn’t trade Pippen and Grant, as they won three straight titles in 1991, 1992 and 1993 with Jordan, Pippen and Grant leading the way. Chicago then won three more championships with Jordan and Pippen in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Grant left the Bulls for the Orlando Magic in 1994. Jordan and Pippen are universally recognized as the greatest duo in NBA history. The Bulls went an outstanding 514-177 in the regular season when Jordan and Pippen played. Pippen averaged 17.1 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.9 blocks next to Jordan, while Jordan averaged 31.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.5 steals and 0.8 blocks alongside Pippen. “I would never be able to find a tandem, another support system, another partner in the game of basketball like Scottie Pippen,” Jordan said in Episode 2 of The Last Dance docuseries. “He was a pleasure to play with. He helped me so much in the way that I approached the game, the way I played the game. Whenever they speak Michael Jordan, they should speak Scottie Pippen. Everybody says well I won all these championships, but I didn’t win without Scottie Pippen. And that’s why I consider him my best teammate of all time.” The Bulls went 6-0 in the NBA Finals in the Jordan-Pippen era. They defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1991 Finals, the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1992 Finals, the Phoenix Suns in the 1993 Finals, the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 Finals and the Utah Jazz in the 1997 and 1998 Finals.

Maple Leafs Make Bold Move: Fringe Forward Replaces Veteran Max…

The Toronto Maple Leafs surprise with a major roster move that takes Max Pacioretty out of the lineup and replaces him with a forgotten player on the Leafs roster. The Leafs have chosen not to dress Max Pacioretty tonight against the Carolina Hurricanes. Pacioretty, who has played in 29 games this season with Toronto, netting five goals and 12 points, is out of the team's lineup for tonight, with it unclear what led to Pacioretty's sudden absence. Pacioretty has shown a lot of effort for Toronto this season, being willing to engage physically and less reliant on pure offence, something that was his calling card during his prime that made him a consistent top-six player. In Toronto, Pacioretty has been in the top six thanks to high effort. Max Pacioretty Replaced by Pontus Holmberg Ahead of Key Matchup vs Carolina Max Pacioretty has been scratched for tonight's game against the Hurricanes, with forward Pontus Holmberg drawing in for Toronto. Holmberg, 25, will play in his first game of 2025, having last played for the Leafs on Dec. 28th in a 5-2 loss to the Washington Capitals. Holmberg has two goals and six points in 32 games this season for the Toronto Maple Leafs, a decrease in production after 17 points in 54 games last season, seemingly losing his place in Craig Berube's Toronto.. Also swapped out of the Leafs lineup was forward Ryan Reaves, with Nick Robertson drawing back in for the Leafs. The addition of Robertson and subtraction of Reaves indicates a focus on offence in the Leafs lineup, with Robertson a solid bottom-six scoring option, having six goals and 10 points in 34 games this season with Toronto. Leafs head coach Craig Berube said the move was meant to add a 'little more speed' ahead of the team's game. In adding a younger player in Holmberg, Berube appears to signal Max Pacioretty seems to be a player who, at 36 years old, may be kept away as an everyday player to ensure he stays fresh for a longer player without being worn out by the end of this season.

Jets' Aaron Rodgers predicted to sign $25 million deal with…

The New York Jets have a few big question marks that need to get sorted out early in the offseason. New York needs to find a new head coach, a new general manager and figure out whether Aaron Rodgers will be the team’s starting quarterback in 2025. All three of these questions go hand in hand. Will Rodgers come back for one more year? That's up in the air. Rodgers seemed melancholy as the campaign was wrapping up but did look good in the season finale. Although the season didn’t go as planned, Rodgers’ numbers are surprisingly good. He finished with 28 touchdown passes to just 11 interceptions while tallying 3,897 passing yards. If you were to see these numbers not knowing the team’s record, you would probably think the Jets were in a much different position than they are now. Rodgers still seems like he has something left in the tank, and if the Jets don’t want him back, maybe someone else will. CBS Sports’ Cody Benjamin made a list of the top quarterbacks who will be available this offseason and predicted landing spots. He predicted that Rodgers will end up signing with the Tennessee Titans on a one-year, $25 million deal. “The former MVP's numbers are deceiving: While he avoided a rash of turnovers in his first healthy year with the Jets, the former Green Bay Packers star was mostly a non-factor for a dismal New York offense, which is ripe for a total overhaul,” Benjamin said. “At 41, he's simply looked much more his age away from Lambeau. "Projection: Signs with Titans on a one-year, $25M deal.” Tennessee has the No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft and likely will take a quarterback. It wouldn’t be the worst idea to have a young guy sit for a year and watch Rodgers if he decides to leave New York.

New York Rangers Star Reportedly Shuts Down Trade To Western…

Mika Zibanejad's name has been thrown into potential trades with the Vancouver Canucks, but now he's officially shut down any potential of a move. Over the past few weeks, trade talks between the New York Rangers and Vancouver Canucks have been repeatedly taking place, with GM Chris Drury looking to acquire star forward J.T. Miller. According to reports, the Canucks rejected a deal that involved star forward Mika Zibanejad, with the team looking to add Braden Schneider to the deal, something that New York have seemingly not entertained at this point in time. Now, a report from Nick Kypreos has revealed that a deal involving these pieces now officially can't happen, with Zibanejad using his No Movement Clause to reject a deal to Vancouver. Zibanejad shut down going to Vancouver...As of today, I'm told Zibanejad does not want to go to the Vancouver Canucks. It's unclear exactly what happened to cause Zibanejad to take this stance, as Vancouver would give him a solid shot at chasing the Stanley Cup, but with many factors coming into play, this is the decision that he's reportedly made. Earlier in the season, it was reported that No. 93 had no interest in waiving his NMC for any team, but given the Rangers' struggles, he has reportedly softened on that stance, making it possible that he could be interested in a trade to certain teams. For whatever reason though, Vancouver is not one of the teams that he's interested in joining, and if New York is still desperate to get Miller, they may have to do so without moving Zibanejad. With many teams interested in landing either Elias Pettersson or Miller, a potential blockbuster coming out of Vancouver is still on the cards, but for now, don't expect to see them acquiring No. 93 in any potential deal.
