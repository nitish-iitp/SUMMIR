NFT: Nets @ Knicks 7pm tip
larryflower37 : 11/17/2024 2:40 pm
The Knicks need to lockdown Cam Thomas quickly tonight and not let him get going.
I think everyone is interested to see if Hukporti earned himself some more playing time vs. Sims who will start if KAT can't go.

Miles McBride (knee) and Karl-Anthony Towns (knee, too) are listed as questionable for the game.

The Knicks will debut the 2024/25 city edition jerseys from Kith just ordered a Josh Hart one for my son for Christmas.

nygiants16 : 11/17/2024 9:49 pm : link
he closed the games and didnt hurt them at all..

BTW loved Brunsons game tonight, he knew he didnt have it and he knew Brooklyn was doubling him and he continued to find the open man, ended up with double digit assists and the team had 33 assists...If you double Brunson the Knicks have 4 other guys who can beat you and all are willing passers and shooters..

The way Brunson played and the way Cam Thomas played is the difference between a superstar number 1 option and a guy eho can score but does absolutely nothing else to effect winning

McCullar Jr. is an interesting guy. Once healthy he's going to be able to add somethin to this team, but it may not be until next season.

It pains me but yes Sims had a good fourth quarter. He’s athletic enough to get blocks, he just needs to put himself in better position.

Jalen had a stronger second half when he realized forcing it wasn’t working. Hoping he has a big game scoring tomorrow night.

He needs to learn everytbing he can from Josh Hart, he is a similar type of player and can have a long career playing that role

Its weird i dont even care about Brunsons scoring, this team is so damn talented that yeah there will be nights you need him but most nights this team can score 115 in their sleep
I think having Hukporti on the roster is pushing Sims to play better

The revelation to me tonight was Dadiet. Zero points but +9 in 10 minutes. The guys is a really good defender. Only way Thibs gives a rook minutes.

But we need Deuce, Precious and Mitch back. Bench still real thin.

I knew the Nets games would unlock Bridges. Let’s get three in a row tomorrow.
the biggest Knick's fan overaction I've seen in a long time is Bridges  
Stu11 : 11/18/2024 8:19 am : link
the guy has been absolutely fine and on the shots he's good at- the corner pocket 3, and driving pull up and fadeaway 2's are absolute money in the bank. His D has picked up too as he gets more comfortable with the team. The team as a whole needs to gel better defensively however I think last night was a step forward in that dept. I agree that 4th qtr was some Tim Donaghy shit. Literally every time the Nets went into the paint they put them on the line. Points in the paint was 50-24 Knicks, rebounds were 47-35 Knicks and second chance points were 14-9 Knicks, 3 point attempts were 41-40 Nets, yet free throws were 30-19 Nets. Yeah right that makes sense.

That pull-up mid midrange two as far I can tell is basically automatic. The corner 3 isn't far off.

If he can start getting to the line more and fight over screens on defense more effectively, that's basically the Bridges we were promised.
Playing with an actual PG

for the first time in his career unlocked KAT, who would have guessed?


KAT is absolutely dominant at the 5  
nygiants16 : 11/18/2024 9:29 am : link
Teams are going to have to figure out now do they double Towns or do they double Brunson and both are willing passers..

Hart also you cant leave open even if he is not hitting the 3 because he will drive into the teeth of the defense and finish at the rim or if they start to rotate find the open man..

Last night Brooklyn decided to double Brunson and got roasted for it..

I have to say...  
Jan in DC : 11/18/2024 9:46 am : link
I was not terribly excited when they traded for KAT. I thought giving up DDV was going to be really painful, but boy is KAT good. I knew he could score, but he's been a GREAT passer. And I was worried about rebounding but he's been really good in that department too.

He's definitely been an All-NBA level player this year.
If OG keeps on this pace  
nygiants16 : 11/18/2024 10:02 am : link
there is defjnitely cinsiderstion for him to be an all star, its obviously early but he has been on a consistent tear since the 5th game of the season..

It's not just the defense glass either. He is 13th in ORebs per game, which is extra impressive given how a lot of possessions finish with him by the 3 pt line AND the Knicks just aren't missing much which limits the opportunities.

Love OG but the chances of him being an all star round to basically zero. Just not nearly enough of the traditional counting stats.

He is up to 18 and 6 on 50% from the field 38% from 3...Obviously he would have to stay om his current pace but his numbers are getting better and better

Stu11 : 11/18/2024 10:45 am : link
maybe we could talk about OG as an all star sort of how they do with Derrick White. However with our current record no chance.

I'm a Knicks fan and this is a real problem with the Knicks threads. I won't follow along in game, but will come back and read the thread afterwards. Most of the time I won't have any issue with the refs, but the game thread makes it sound like the Knicks get screwed every game through out the game.

I'm not sure how respectable 32% is, but I give Josh a tremendous amount of credit to adapting his game as the 5th best member of the starting lineup and picking his spots.

They've started having him bring the ball up more, which eases the burden on Brunson and has helped facilitate his facilitation. 6 assists per game not only would be a career high, but to accomplish that as a secondary creator on the team would be really impressive.

I'm still not convinced he would be better at the 6th man when Precious comes back, but he is playing well.
I may have missed the commentary, but how about those

Pacome Dadiet minutes? Seems decently entrenched as the number one wing option off the bench ahead of Matt Ryan.

+9 in 10 minutes yesterday after a strong showing Friday with 5 points, 4 boards a steal and a block.

The defense yesterday especially seemed pretty impressive. Attached one clip below but I am really excited about the potential here.

I did comment on it above, but yeah, Dadiet's D last night really passed the eye test, and it's reflected in his plus-minus. Who knew?
Dadiet seems like a smart player with a high bball IQ.  
LW_Giants : 11/18/2024 5:02 pm : link
I don't think his athleticism is going to blow anyone away, but he's often in the right spot and seems to be a good spot up shower. Can't ask for anything more from a 19 year old.

They could all get healthy and turn it on but if Embiid is no longer dominant, they are in trouble
