Teams will flock to Cary, North Carolina on Friday to compete in the ACC Cross Country Championships.

On Friday morning, the best runners from the Atlantic Coast Conference will take to Wakemed Soccer Park in Cary, North Carolina for the ACC Cross Country Championships. The men’s 8k will kick off the event with the gun sounding at 9:30 a.m. ET. The women will head to the starting line for a 10:30 a.m. start in their 6k. On the men’s side, the UNC Tar Heels will look to repeat as champions, while the NC State Wolf Pack will look to claim their eighth straight ACC title. NC State currently ranks No. 10 in the nation with 237 points. Florida State is not far behind with a spot at No. 13 with 192. With three other teams being ranked nationally coming into the championships, the final race should be a good one to follow. UNC comes in at No. 19, Virginia is at No. 21 and Syracuse is sitting at No. 23.
