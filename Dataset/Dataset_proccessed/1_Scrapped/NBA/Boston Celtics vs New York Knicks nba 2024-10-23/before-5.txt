Sims can not be playing  
nygiants16 : 10/22/2024 9:08 pm : link
he does absokutely nothing on the court
Sims fucking blows  
Anakim : 10/22/2024 9:09 pm : link
For as athletic he is, he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
Once Precious comes back thankfully Sims will be on the bench  
nygiants16 : 10/22/2024 9:14 pm : link
..
At least Bridges looks like  
nygiants16 : 10/22/2024 9:18 pm : link
he said fuck it and just started playing and not thinking
Knicks shooting  
larryflower37 : 10/22/2024 9:20 pm : link

Any other game we would be celebrating right now

There is not a defense in the NBA that would of stopped Boston tonight..

This is ridiculous shooting even with hands in their faces
Sims sucks  
Eightshamrocks : 10/22/2024 9:23 pm : link
Cone back soon Precious
Time to give hukporti,  
larryflower37 : 10/22/2024 9:25 pm : link
Dadiet and Kolek some burn .
MLB Network replaying Yanks/Guardians Game 5.  
bceagle05 : 10/22/2024 9:26 pm : link
Ninth inning just began.
I definitely think this game  
Jon In NYC : 10/22/2024 9:27 pm : link
says more about the Celtics than it does the Knicks, but that still sucks since we have to go through the Celtics.
Dadiet!  
bceagle05 : 10/22/2024 9:27 pm : link
.
Hukporti  
Jon In NYC : 10/22/2024 9:29 pm : link
with a pretty sick block
Hukporti already showing more than Sims.  
bceagle05 : 10/22/2024 9:31 pm : link
.
Kolek  
Jon In NYC : 10/22/2024 9:31 pm : link
and Hukporti need to play.
Josh Hart  
Jon In NYC : 10/22/2024 9:33 pm : link
25 minutes 4 rebounds. He just has no idea where to be or what to do out there with the starters.
LOL Jericho  
bceagle05 : 10/22/2024 9:36 pm : link
.
Bridges 7 for 8 2 for 3 from 3 16 ppints in second half  
nygiants16 : 10/22/2024 9:37 pm : link
looked like he stopped worrying about getting the ball high and just shot it without thinking..
Boston launching threes for the record.  
bceagle05 : 10/22/2024 9:37 pm : link
I’d be fine with a flagrant foul sending one of these guys into the 10th row.
No surprise  
PhilSimms15 : 10/22/2024 9:38 pm : link
This blow-out is really is no surprise. The Celtics are the Champions and probably the best team in the league. The Knicks are essentially a new team with several new players including two starters and their style of O and D is completely different than the past two seasons. If the Knicks become something it is going to take at least half the season.

Knciks could of rolled with the same team as last year and they wouldnt of come close to besting Boston the way zboston shot the 3

He is also getting smoked on the defensive end. A total net negative tonight.


hey - minus 33, not everyone can do that in their debut
Some positives come out of this game  
larryflower37 : 10/22/2024 9:50 pm : link
McBride is going to be a force off the bench and will make us forget Dante.
Bridges shot is back and he can score on all 3 levels.
It's nice having a center that can play inside and out.
Cam Payne is the back up PG we needed.
Brunson is still Brunson.
Well, this should be the swan song for Jericho Sims  
Anakim : 10/22/2024 10:03 pm : link
We tried. He's one of the most athletic players in the NBA, but he just can't put it together. Oh well. It was worth a shot, but now it's time for Hukporti.
The good news  
nygiants16 : 10/22/2024 10:10 pm : link
when Knicks lose opening night under Thibs they make the playoffs

I still want to see Kolek in the backup PG role.
Man if ever there was a time I wish we had a back to back  
Stu11 : 10/22/2024 10:36 pm : link
To get the taste of this stink burger out of our mouths.
Couple of observations  
nygiants16 : 10/22/2024 10:39 pm : link
Thibs kept 2 starters on the court at all times, i like that, it allows guys to control the offense at different times in the game..

His rotation style was different than last year, last year was longer stretches for players, sometimes playing the final 15 minutes of halves, nobody did that tonight..

Deuce is ready for a bigger role, he has the confidence in his shot and is agressive..

Brunson is enjoying all the space, he was getting alot of easy looks..

Hart has to make teams pay whrn they out their center on him, at minimum being the screener and getting guys open shots
...  
SFGFNCGiantsFan : 10/23/2024 7:19 am : link
Eh, opening night on the road vs. the defending champions with them hitting seemingly every 3. Yeah, losing sucks, but I'm not losing sleep over this. It's going to take time for this team to jell.

Tatum was UFB too.
I don't take too much away from this game  
Jan in DC : 10/23/2024 8:43 am : link
other than Thibs needs to harp on rebounding. Some of those offensive boards were from long bounces on 3s, but the team rebounding needs to be a priority now that we don't have iHart and Randle.

Other than that.. I'm not getting worked up about it.
Knicks defense will better next time we play Celtics and they wont be  
fredgbrown : 10/23/2024 8:49 am : link
shooting 3 like this.OG needs to play like the 200 million dollar man he demanded. We need that OG in the Pacers game before he got injured.

Kolek is going to be a player to deal with for opponents.
I think Offensively the team was fine  
nygiants16 : 10/23/2024 9:01 am : link
I liked KAT making Boston pay for putting a smaller guy on him and posting up and scoring at the rim..

With Bridges you can see where he is going to be able to score in this offense, a lot on kickouts but also the secondary action where he can get into the lane and get that midrange..

If teams are going to habe their center sit in th epaont, Hart has to hit the open 3 and kill teams with his cuttong and offensive rebounding...Have to make them pay for leaving him open..

Defensively the Knicks were ok on the first action, the problem was when the ball started moving or their was supposed to be a switch, you can tell there was hesitation and unsure of who was going to go and who wasnt...That will come with knowing others tendencies...

Rebounding has to get better, cant be just one guy, Boston is a small team but they team rebound, Bridges and OG need to help on the glass and that will open up the fast break because in reality anyone on the court can take the ball and go..

In reality no team is going to make 29 3s but the 29 3s werent necassarily the reason, it was the effeciency in which they made those 3s, in the first half they were 17 for 27 on 3s...absolutely ridiculous and then 3rd quarter at one point they were 7 for 8..

Knicks beat anyone else last night, they just happened to play a buzzsaw
Bridges actually looked pretty good in the 2nd half  
Jacobs #27 : 10/23/2024 9:02 am : link
at least on offense, his shot started falling. I'm not going to panic over him and assume he forgot how to shoot all of sudden in the middle of his career.

Yeah usually you don't take anything out of what Marv Albert would call "extended Garbaaaage time" but I thought that was a big half for Bridges to have shots start falling in the flow of the offense. He'll be fine. Honestly everyone in here follows Sims around the court and obsesses on every mistake he makes, but he's not making 200 million. OG is and his effort was an embarrassment last night from start to finish.

Yeah its not even the scoring for OG, Knicks need him to grab 6 to 8 rebounds agame and his defense needs to be absolutely elite...


1 game an the narrative  
larryflower37 : 10/23/2024 9:38 am : link
Is the Knicks have lost their identity and they are soft finesse team.
Come on, these hot takes are ridiculous. The NBA didn't do us any favors with the first four games but it's a long season and I still think they win 50 plus games.

My favorite is they are a boring team and just dont have that spark anymore...

After 1 game lol
I’ve been reading Knicks are interested in Matt Ryan

Knicks scored 124 per 100 possessions  
nygiants16 : 10/23/2024 1:58 pm : link
that would of led the NBA last year and they need time to gel, they scored at an elite clip last night, just shows the historic shooting from Boston
It. Was. One. Game.

Knicks need their bigs back OR need to go out and get some via the trade market. The next time these two teams play (Feb. 8th @ MSG), things will be different. The trade deadline is February 6th. Mitch should be back by then or he'll be traded by that point.

Looking forward to him no longer being on TV and that TNT show ending.
The thing with the Celtics to is  
nygiants16 : 10/23/2024 5:47 pm : link
they are the only team in the NBA that has 3 guys who can gusrd Brunson and also have enough defenders where they can put their Center on Hart and not effect their defense..

Friday night Pacers cant put Turner on Hart because then Siakim is on Towns and Nesmith on Brunson and it forces Nembhard and Haliburton to have to play defense and guard Bridges and OG...
