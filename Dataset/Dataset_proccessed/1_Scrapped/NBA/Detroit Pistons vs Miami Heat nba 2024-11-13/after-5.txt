Malik Beasley made a go-ahead technical free throw with 1.1 seconds left in overtime and the host Detroit Pistons escaped with a wild 123-121 victory over the Miami Heat in the NBA Cup opener for both teams on Tuesday night.

Tyler Herro, who scored the last nine points of regulation, all on 3-pointers, to force overtime, gave the Heat a two-point lead on a bank shot with 1.8 seconds left in overtime. An alley-oop dunk by Jalen Duren off an inbounds pass Cade Cunningham tied the score.
