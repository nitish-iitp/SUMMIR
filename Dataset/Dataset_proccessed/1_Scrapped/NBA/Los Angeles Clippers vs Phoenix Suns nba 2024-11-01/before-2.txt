The tank is off to a good start and the Spurs played last night. Markkanen is listed as GTD.

This is the first winnable game for this team IMO.

Don't know who will score if Markkanen won't play. George will have to go off and probably another player as well.

Taking into account George's horrendous play, Hendricks' injury and insertion of Clarkson into stating line-up, my excitement for this season is down about 50%......

Cody Williams is two years away from even having a shot at physically competing in the NBA, I'm not sure what benefit he is getting from being in the NBA instead of the G-League.

Gonna be a long season, and for a 14% chance at Flagg at best.

Oof
New York said Mitchell wasn't the guy you trade the sink for, then they traded it for Mikal, lol.

I actually like the way Keyonte is playing. He's pressing and making some mistakes, but he plays hard and makes some nice plays. If he were to settle into a more simple and reduced role, like Malik Monk, for example, I think he'd do well.

I agree with this. He's not really involved in plays and doesn't touch the ball for long stretches. He'd be better off in the Gleague where every possession is based around developing him. He also needs to be working out physically 2 hours/day.

The guy is shooting 28% FG and 20% 3PT. And he is the guy with more shots in the team. Playing hard is the minimum you can ask to a nba player

Right now I don't know if we will be able to win more than 10 games... and those will be thrown by the opponent.

Another decent showing. The Jazz didn't get embarrassed and ended up with the L. On the negative side, the only ones who stood out were Collins and Flip. I suppose Kessler was kinda ok. I agree with the sentiment about Williams not being felt or involved much in the offense other than shooting 3s, he needs to try and create something.

George has yet to have a good game, and so far he's on a Trey Burke trajectory. Given the keys early, shown flashes of scoring but inefficiently, continues to his second season and performs worse and even less efficiently. Hopefully he figures it out and start showing improvement.

As for the lottery odds, it's 14% for the number one pick but it's 100% for a top-5 pick and there are at least 5 players who are supposed to be really good: Flagg, Bailey, Edgecombe, Traore, Harper (don't know much about Drake Powell but he'll make it 6).

Who is going to be the coach that tells George off the dribble 3's are not a high percentage, winning shot.

Also there are another 10 players in this draft that are as good as anyone in last years draft. This is the draft to get a potential star in the top 5 and prospects with high upside in the 1st round.

Dude thinks he's the next Curry when in actuality he's closer to the next Reggie Jackson.

I know he had a few great shooting nights last season but looking at his overall stats he was the least inefficient volume shooter in the league last year. Someone needs to rein him in but playing alongside a gunner like Clarkson isn't helping matters.

I think Key is a future player but likely as a 6th man type. He doesn't create, shoot, and can't get by anyone to offset all his defensive issues. The bad body language isn't helping either. He just stands there after getting stripped or turning the ball over. It's a continuing theme with him. Hardy needs to get in his ear and tell him to at least try to defend. It's ironic how Hardy has been so hard with Sexton but basically lets Clarkson and Key do anything they want out there. I don't think letting him fall into all these bad habits is good at all for Key's development.

He certainly doesn't play hard after he continually turns the ball over and just stands there to watch. It's a terrible look. If anything he needs to be hustling out there even after turnovers.

I agree he needs a simpler role but unfortunately the only vet PG they brought in was washed Patty Mills but I'm guessing that was intentional leading up to this next draft. Monk had to bounce around a few years before he found his ideal role in Sacramento. Key could potentially be great in a future 6th man role but at this point the Jazz need to find starters which will likely come thru the next 2 drafts and via future trade. Not sure any of the 6 recent draftees are starter material though. I do like Flip the most of the bunch.

The very big issue with Keyonte is just that he doesn't seem much talent.

-Too small to play SG
-Not a good defender
-OK but not great shooter
-Not a natural PG
-Lacks the athleticism to get by people
-Lacks the ball skills to get by people

If you're a shoot first PG, you either need to be an elite shooter or be able to beat most guys off the dribble and... Keyonte is just an OK shooter and can't beat anyone off the dribble.

Super inefficient in college as well. There is no reason to believe he will ever be a star.
