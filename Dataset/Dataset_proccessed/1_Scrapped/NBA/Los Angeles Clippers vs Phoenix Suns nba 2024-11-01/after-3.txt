Devin Booker scored a season-high 40 points as the visiting Phoenix Suns rallied from a 21-point third-quarter deficit to earn a 125-119 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday at Inglewood, Calif.

Royce O’Neale added 21 points, Kevin Durant scored 18, rookie Ryan Dunn had 16 in his second career start and Jusuf Nurkic put up 11 as the Suns won for the second time in two weeks at the Clippers’ new $2 billion Intuit Dome.

Phoenix made 15 consecutive shots to open the second half, sparking a rally that extended its winning streak to three games.

James Harden produced 25 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds while Norman Powell added 23 points as the Clippers fell to 0-3 in their new building. Harden became the 20th player in NBA history to pass 26,000 career points.

Ivica Zubac scored 22 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, Kevin Porter Jr. logged 14 points and Derrick Jones Jr. added 11 for the Clippers, who also lost to the Suns 116-113 in overtime on Oct. 23 during the regular-season debut of their new home.

The Clippers got off to a fast start and led 37-18 late in the first quarter. The hosts finished the opening period with a 37-20 advantage after shooting 61.5 percent from the floor.

Phoenix cut its deficit to eight points in the second quarter before Los Angeles led 70-52 at halftime. Harden had a double-double before the end of the first half with 13 points and 10 assists, and the Clippers had a 33-14 rebounding advantage.

The Suns stormed back in the third quarter to tie the score 89-89 with 3:16 remaining in the period on a 3-pointer from O’Neale. The Clippers finished the third quarter with a 93-91 lead.

The Suns took a 103-102 lead with 6:41 remaining on a floater from Dunn and never trailed again. O’Neale put the game away on a 3-pointer with 44.7 seconds remaining for a 118-112 lead.

The Clippers continue to play without star Kawhi Leonard, who is sidelined indefinitely due to a chronic knee injury.
