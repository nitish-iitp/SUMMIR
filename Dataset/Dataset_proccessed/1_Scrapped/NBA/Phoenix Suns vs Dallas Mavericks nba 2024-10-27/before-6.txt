Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best selections on Sunday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Luka Dončić (DAL, PG)	$22,410	58.7	2.6
Value	Tyus Jones (PHX, PG)	$9,660	33.3	3.5
Fade	Jusuf Nurkić (PHX, C)	$12,090	24.7	2
Cheapie	Rui Hachimura (LAL, SF/PF)	$9,950	30.1	3

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your NBA Late Sunday teams, consider starting with a value player like Tyus Jones. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Luka Dončić is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, explore our cheapie options, including Rui Hachimura.

On the other hand, according to our model, Jusuf Nurkić is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
