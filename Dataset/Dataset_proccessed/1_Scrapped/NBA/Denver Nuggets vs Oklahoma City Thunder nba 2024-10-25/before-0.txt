Aaron Gordon will stay with Denver for 4 more years (yahoo.com)

By Leobert Julian A. de la Peña

The Denver Nuggets just extended their star power forward Aaron Gordon to a four-year $133 million contract deal announced on October 22, 2024.

Gordon, who played a vital role during the Denver Nuggets’ NBA Championship title campaign in the 2023-2024 season, already picked up his $23M player option for the 2025-2026 season that paved the way for the four-year deal.

In his last five years playing for the Denver franchise, the athletic big man tallied 14.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.5 assists.

Not known to be a threat offensively when he was still with the Orlando Magic, Gordon elevated his game the moment he teamed up with Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray in Denver.

In his second year with the Nuggets, Gordon began to develop his perimeter jumper and increased his scoring total alongside the assist department.

When the Nuggets entered the playoffs, Gordon started to take more three-pointers, an arsenal he needed to improve to complement the post-game of Jokic underneath.

All the hard work then paid off as Gordon’s all-around game steered the Nuggets to their first NBA title, defeating the Miami Heat in just five games.

However, the Nuggets failed to repeat the next year as they suffered a disappointing Game 7 loss at the hands of Anthony Edwards and the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Denver just faced a huge overhaul in their roster this season as their primary two-way shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope left the franchise to join Orlando.

Gordon and the Nuggets will kick off their 2024-2025 NBA regular season on October 25, 2024, as they challenge Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder at 10 AM.
