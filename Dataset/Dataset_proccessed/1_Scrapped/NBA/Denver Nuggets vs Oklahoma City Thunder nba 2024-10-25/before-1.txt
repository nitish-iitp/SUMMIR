Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best picks on Friday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Nikola Jokić (DEN, C)	$23,620	62	2.6
Value	Isaiah Joe (OKC, SG)	$6,000	17.5	2.9
Fade	Keegan Murray (SAC, SF/PF)	$11,760	25.2	2.1
Cheapie	Kevin Huerter (SAC, SG/SF)	$7,180	20	2.8

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Late Friday teams, consider starting with a value player like Isaiah Joe. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Nikola Jokić is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Kevin Huerter.

On the other hand, according to our model, Keegan Murray is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
