Minnesota Timberwolves minority owner Alex Rodriguez and girlfriend Jaclyn Cordeiro were present at Target Center during the team's home fixture against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday. The couple are often spotted supporting their team together in Minneapolis.

On Instagram, Cordeiro posted a video of the team led out by Anthony Edwards warming up during their introductions. A subsequent story featured her and A-Rod walking out to the arena. The fitness instructor and the Yankees legend walked hand in hand in dark color-coordinated outfits. Cordeiro wore a black body-con dress while Rodriguez was suited up.

This was the couple's first appearance together at an NBA game after a long and grueling month of October baseball. A-Rod, who is an analyst for FOX Sports, was a regular feature covering games during the postseason. The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees in the World Series in five games to win the title.

Meanwhile, the Timberwolves won 114-93 against Charlotte. Naz Reid and Anthony Edwards led the scoring with 25 and 21 points each. This was Minnesota's fourth win in seven games and their second successive win at home.

Alex Rodriguez's Wolves game appearance ahead of arbitration

While Alex Rodriguez was present at the Minnesota Timberwolves game, it could probably be one of his last appearances as minority owner. There is an ongoing arbitration hearing over the ownership transfer of the Timberwolves and their WNBA counterpart Minnesota Lynx.

Alex Rodriguez alongside his business partner Marc Lore were to take over the majority stakes of the two teams from owner Glen Taylor. But when they asked for an extension at the end of March this year, Taylor stopped the sale transfer owing non-cooperation from the pair. Rodriguez and Lore said they wanted the extension as they were awaiting the NBA's approval.

If the arbitration rules in favour of A-Rod and Lore, then they will have the opportunity to successfully have the $1.5 billion take over as planned and earn 80% of the team's stakes. If the arbitration doesn't favor the two, then they might be willing to sell their current 40% stake in the team.
