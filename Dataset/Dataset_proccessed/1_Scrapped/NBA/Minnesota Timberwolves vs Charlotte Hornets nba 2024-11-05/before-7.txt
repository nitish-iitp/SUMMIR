Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best choices on Tuesday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Nikola Jokić (DEN, C)	$24,240	74.2	3.1
Value	Bobby Portis (MIL, PF/C)	$10,620	41.3	3.9
Fade	Ochai Agbaji (TOR, SG/SF)	$10,620	17.3	1.6
Cheapie	Isaac Okoro (CLE, SF/SG)	$6,000	21.9	3.7

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your NBA Tuesday teams, consider starting with a value player like Bobby Portis. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Nikola Jokić is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Isaac Okoro.

On the other hand, according to our model, Ochai Agbaji is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
