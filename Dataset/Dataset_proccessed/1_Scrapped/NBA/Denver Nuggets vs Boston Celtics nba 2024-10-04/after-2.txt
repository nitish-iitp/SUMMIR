After months of anticipation, the NBA made its return with real action as the Denver Nuggets faced off against the Boston Celtics in the first preseason game. The two most recent NBA champions clashed in the United Arab Emirates on Friday for the first of two preseason matchups at Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi.

The Celtics secured a 107-103 victory, overcoming reigning MVP Nikola Jokic and his revamped Nuggets, which featured the debut of new point guard Russell Westbrook.

Both teams came out with high energy, with Denver initially jumping to an 18-13 lead.

Derrick White and Jayson Tatum sparked a brief rally for the Celtics, with Tatum nailing a step-back 3-pointer to give Boston a 21-20 lead. However, after a Denver timeout, Michael Porter Jr. and Russell Westbrook responded with 3-pointers, igniting a run that allowed the Nuggets to close the quarter strong at 32-25.

Pritchard caught fire for the Celtics in the second quarter, scoring 14 points, including four triples, before halftime.

While Pritchard was on fire, Jokic demonstrated his MVP form, sinking hook shot after hook shot while also showcasing his playmaking and rebounding abilities. The Nuggets led at halftime, 63-56.

In the second half, the starters rested, and the reserves stepped up. Westbrook played a key role as a playmaker, assisting Deandre Jordan and hitting a 3-pointer that extended the score to 73-64.

Pritchard continued to showcase his shooting skills, sinking two more 3-pointers to bring the Nuggets' lead down to one at 80-79 by the end of the third quarter.

The game remained close as it approached the finish. With the score tied at 88, the Celtics went on a 10-4 run to take a 98-92 lead. The teams traded baskets, and the Nuggets narrowed the gap to one after Jahmeer Young converted a layup off a Denver steal.

JD Davison hit two free throws, and with Boston up by three with eight seconds left, the Celtics chose to foul. Young made his first free throw but was called for a lane violation while attempting to miss his second for a possible offensive rebound. Davison sealed the game with two more free throws, giving the Celtics the 107-103 victory.
