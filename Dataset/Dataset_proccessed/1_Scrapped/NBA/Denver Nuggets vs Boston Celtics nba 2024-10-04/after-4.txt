Key Moment

Third-year guard JD Davison spent his Friday night polishing off a preseason-opening victory for the Boston Celtics.

Davison scored or assisted on Boston’s final six points, all while notching an important steal and a clutch block, to lead the Celtics to a 107-103 win over Denver. He canned four free throws during the final eight seconds to seal the victory. However, the highlights of his game-sealing stretch arrived at the defensive end.

With Boston leading 95-92 at the 3:12 mark, Davison picked off a Denver outlet pass and that led to a 3-pointer from Drew Peterson just four seconds later. Then, with the C’s leading by four with 88 seconds left, Davison chased down Trey Alexander and emphatically swatted his layup attempt away before finding Dmytro Skapinstev for an alley-oop dunk at the other end to bump the lead up to six.

Heck of a final few minutes from the athletic guard, and heck of a way for Boston to open up the preseason.
