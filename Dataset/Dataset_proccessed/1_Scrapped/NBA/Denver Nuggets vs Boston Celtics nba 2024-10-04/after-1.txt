The Denver Nuggets started their championship quest 7800 miles from home, but the starters looked to be in good shape in the first half and the bench fought down the stretch in a tight finish to get that experience under their belts, losing 107-103 to the Boston Celtics in Abu Dhabi. The game was meaningless but more fun than a preseason game normally is, but everything you’d want to see from Denver’s offense without KCP was there. The Celtics rained 60+ three point attempts on the Nuggets, but Nikola Jokic had 14 points, 8 boards and 2 assists, Michael Porter Jr. and Russell Westbrook each had 12 points, and Julian Strawther added 11 for the bench. Westbrook’s 8 assists kept the bench organized, but preseason games are for trying out matchups and concepts you may not go to very often in the regular season and Denver did a lot of that. All in all a nice first game from both new and returning players.

Game Recap

Jamal hit a nice three from the corner as the Celtics double-teamed Nikola. The refs called an offensive foul on Nikola on an off-ball push, but Aaron Gordon hit a nice stepback the next time down. Jokic got his second foul on a reach just four minutes in, but a transition layup on a steal by MPJ made it 9-4 Nuggets early. Jamal airballed off a potential MPJ assist, but the sloppiness was apparent for both teams. MPJ got his 7th point on an AG-assisted layup, answered by a Tatum deep shot, and then Jokic finger-rolled in a finish. MPJ traveled on a 3, Jamal had a rebound stripped for a Boston finish, but Russ came in the game and the energy picked up as he hit a 3 off a Jokic assist. Derrick White and Tatum made threes as well though, Gordon missed one and the Celtics took the lead 21-20 on a White layup. Strawther missed a three but blocked a White layup, Saric finished inside and finished a traditional three-point play, then hit another finish as Denver wrapped the quarter up 32-25 after a Cancar corner 3 in the waning seconds.

Denver started the second quarter a little out of sync, with a missed Russ layup and a Vlatko out-of-bounds turnover on the offensive side, and 4 straight missed defensive rebounds that prompted an early rage timeout from Michael Malone. Strawther made a three answered by Pritcheard, then Hunter Tyson hit a 3 of his own. More sloppy play from both teams followed though, as bricks and blown finishes from the bench guys left Denver up 43-37 with 5 minutes gone and the starters began filtering back in. Jokic had another nice finish, Gordon hit a 3 to extend the lead to double digits, but Pritchard hit a pair of 3s and Tatum’s free throw tied the game at 50. MPJ’s transition dunk and the half-court-assist from AG to Braun put Denver back up. Jokic finished in the paint, Tillman made a Boston 3, and then the two teams had a playoff-level fight on Denver’s offensive side with denials and rebounds and passes that finally ended in a Denver putback. Murray got on the floor for a ball, showing the competitive energy had picked up from the first, and Denver finished the half up 63-56 after a Celtics miss at the buzzer.

The third quarter began with the reserves out in force and the Nuggets starters relegated to towel waving with their work in the first preseason game complete. Hunter Tyson buried a three, Strawther had a tough finish off a hustle rebound from Dario Saric. Tillman made a 3 for Boston, Russ passed to Deandre Jordan for a dunk, and Denver’s bench looked well-organized for being the first game. Westbrook made another 3 to extend Denver’s lead to 73-61, and then a transition dunk attempt off a quick pass from Westbrook was almost great from Deandre… until it didn’t fall. The Celtics made a pair of threes to force a timeout, then Trey Alexander scored his first points in a Denver uniform with a floater. Denver finished the third quarter up 80-79.

It was basically all deep bench to start the fourth quarter, as Boston and Denver exchanged threes. Pickett hit a buzzer beater but both he and Alexander missed paint shots. Strawther didn’t miss his drive but the Nuggets struggled with finishes and turnovers as Boston took the lead. Strawther tied it up with 6 minutes to go, but the Celtics made a couple of buckets before Zeke Nnaji hit a turnaround in the paint and earned free throws his next trip down. Denver trailed 95-92 when a turnover by PJ Hall on the outlet after a rebound turned into a made Celtics 3 on their 59th attempt of the game. Peterson hit Boston’s 60th attempt as well but the Nuggets fought back with another Zeke bucket and a Trey-Alexander-induced fastbreak off a turnover. A scoring discrepancy took a bucket off the tally for Denver to make it 103-102, forcing Denver to foul Boston and leading to an extended timeouts-and-free-throws stretch that eventually made the final score 107-103 Boston.

Final Thoughts

Denver’s starters look good. Jamal didn’t do a lot of scoring but looked flexible and athletic on both sides of the court, even getting on the floor for a loose ball at the end of the first half. Jokic mauled the Celtics in the second quarter, as they were simply not big enough to stop him. MPJ was finishing at the rim and running in transition, Aaron Gordon was experimenting with threes, and Christian Braun played great defense on Tatum and hit some finishes on cuts. It’s not quite mid-season form, but the Nuggets look like the Nuggets, and that’s all I really want to see in game one of the preseason.

Denver’s bench is working on roles. Russell Westbrook is still figuring out his guys and where each of them will be. He had some missed layups early but was making passes to try to get Jordan and Strawther open finishes in the second half. Dario was playing the 4 in the second half next to Deandre after playing the backup 5 in the first half, and the second half was a little rough as they obviously did not have much time to work out their roles in the shortened 3-day training camp before this trip. Saric at the 4 and being forced into perimeter defense while not being involved in pick-and-rolls is not how I expect him to be used in the regular season, but if you want to see the limitations and strengths of the roster options then the preseason is a good time to experiment. Jalen Pickett also got a handful of minutes in the 3rd quarter to run the offense with Trey Alexander at the shooting guard, and let’s just say I hope not to see too much of that pairing during the regular season either.

Game 2 Sunday!

This was a glorified scrimmage but showed some promise for the young dudes playing with Westbrook. I like what I see from Saric and Nnaji. With Holmes out for the season their size is needed. One thing I am confused by is Nnaji’s ability to go after offensive rebounds but his lack of aggression on defensive rebounds.

I didn’t watch his minutes yesterday, but have a theory that he (and PWat) try to block almost every shot they are guarding which often puts them out of position for a defensive rebound.

I think we would be better off if we stagger Jok this time around.
Starters plus Saric vs opp starters are able to stay net neutral at least.
Jok, Russ, Straw, Pwat and Cancar/Hunter – net positive slightely.
Full starters – huge net positive

So first sub would be Saric for Jok? Probably would work great, but hasn’t Jok said in the past he preferred this current minute allotment? I think stars have a lot of input on their minutes/rest.

Minnesota is so deep, Terrance “windmill slam” Shannon Jr. & Rob Dillingham are third string. And NAW, smooth & consistently stroking Donte DiVincenzo, Jingles at SF, Leonard “unknown quantity” Miller at PF with Naz Reid at Center. Cancar, Pickett, Jordan & likely Hunter Tyson wouldn’t even make their roster. Trey Alexander too. That’s 5 for the chaff. Its time some Nuggets fans stop crowing about Minnesota’s shrewd trade to get out of the second-apron, increase optionality & take advantage of NY’s desperation.

Anthony Edwards— when finally & belatedly single-covered by Christian Braun after 6 games— had just 4 points, 0 rebounds & 3 assists in the dynasty-ending Game 7’s first half. Finished with 16 pts, 8 rebounds & 7 assists while KCP & Murray/Braun were on him (plus Jokic cheating up to the elbow to thwart Ant in the gather). 2.5-on-one, Dom. Why did we collapse like a souufle at a bombing site? Because Chris Finch had them making the extra pass until our 20-pt third-quarter lead dissipated with every wide-open Conley… Read more »

Can any of Shannon, Dillingham, Jingles and Miller actually play? It’s 3 guys who are all potential and 1 who is in the twilight of his career. I can’t give them credit for those 4, while complaining that the Nuggets are relying too heavily on CB, PW and Straw.

A quick checkin for the worst player in the league watch
Bronny 1/6 2 pts and -12 in 16 min
Pickett 1/4 3 pts and -15 in 15 min
So basically a wash. Interesting race to the bottom there.
Apparently Bronny is going to be the Laker’s messiah per reports but maybe they should have taken Pickett instead if they are equivalent

Let’s just say Bronny would likely not be in the league if it wasn’t for his last name. ESPN is hyping Bronny up already saying his defense was stifling to yield a -12.
Anyway neither Pickett or Bronny are going to amount to much in the NBA and the hype with Bronny is funny because of pop pop.

I actually disagree with this. I think the worst thing for Bronny is his dad. He has a chance to he a nice glue guy with his defense and ability to be a connector on offense, but everyone is expecting an offensive star because of his dad. I think he’ll crumble under unrealistic expectations.

Great to have Nuggets basketball back and no injuries. Didn’t need to see much out of the starters and they obliged.

CB looked like he fit in well and played some great defense on Tatum. Bench looks like they may have some semblance of an offense with Westbrook getting into the paint and being an agent of chaos – both for good and bad. Bench minutes don’t need to be great, just not a crater and the Nuggets will cruise through the regular season.

The Celtics aren’t “fake champs”. The Nuggets didn’t exactly beat a murderer’s row of opponents when they won the title 2 years ago, you know. Does that make them “fake champs” too?

Of course not. You can only beat whoever your opponents are. The Celtics did that. And did so easily. Just like Denver did the previous season. They both deserve for fans to understand & respect the accomplishment

Let’s just say if we match up with them in the Finals I’m not worried.
This year there actually isn’t a team that worries me like Minny did last year.
Yea Celts are champs and Joel won the MVP doesn’t mean that they were the best team or the best player respectively.
Everyone said the Suns were going to beat the Nuggets in our championship run we dealt with more intact teams than the Celtics did

Don’t need to mention the injured teams Boston faced how about Miami without Butler, Cleveland without Mitchell or Indy without Halliburton then they get an overrated Mavs team with an injured Luka (who is already injured as predicted due to his body habitus).
Stats can just portray it reality will bear it out as Newera pointed out the Celtics will choke if there is an all star on the other team who isn’t injured in the playoffs.
