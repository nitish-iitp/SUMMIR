NFT: Knicks: KAT Trade Official
Spider43 : 10/2/2024 5:55 pm
A couple of future second rounders heading Charlotte's way. That's all this piece says.

Mitch is 27 in April, Sims will be 26 in a few weeks.


So, basically, a 6 month difference. If Sims was younger I'd be like he just needs time to figure it out. He's not and maybe he still can but he is nothing more than just an end of the rotation guy that will only be used because of injuries.

up the Sims thing. Age is never an issue unless your body is shot. And this is certainly not so with Sims.

His issue is tied to effort as he plays with too little edge and his time with the Knicks shows not enough growth.

The player I'm most interested in is Kolek. Best vision since Pistol Pete. You can talk about anyone players pluses and for me the top 3 are vision #1 feet #2 and playing with an edge #3

One more I'd like to see the Knicks pick up is Stewart. Talk about edge he fits well with the current style of play.

might be Kolek's #1 fan on here, and was pushing hard for them to draft him but best since Pistol Pete? C'mon lol Did Magic Johnson, John Stockton etc never play? Steve Nash? Heck, guys like Mark Jackson had absurd vision on the court. Not hating on my guy but that's over the top hyperbole.
I'm excited for Kolek too...  
Jan in DC : 10/3/2024 1:06 pm : link
Court vision is really really hard to teach a player. There's some guys who just know how to anticipate motion on the court and they think the game at a different level.

I haven't studied his game that much, but I've seen clips and I saw summer league and it looks like Kolek has that court vision. It took Deuce a couple years to crack the rotation, so I don't suspect he'll be getting heavy minutes anytime soon, but he's a toolsy guy you can invest in and hope he is a rotation player down the road.

to take issue with your fanboy list but for anyone to include Stockton is a miss step. His entire time was spent making Malone an all time great. They were so much in sync that Stockton knew where he was on the court at all times...difficult to miss that target.

"fanboy list". Anybody who thinks Tyler Kolek has the best court vision since Pete Maravich is being truly absurd. Yeah, it's a "fanboy" list to say Magic Johnson had superior court vision, Kolek has better vision than Jason Kidd? Bird? Jokic? Ridiculous statement.

This. Sims' issue is not effort, it's that he doesn't understand where to be on the court so he's in no-mans-land much of the time.

I think that's to be expected. But he should get plenty of playing time in the preseason and if he plays well on both ends of the court he could pass Payne.

We know that Thibs isn't afraid to play guys that he thinks prepares and practices hard. He played IQ from the jump, so it's possible that Kolek earns a rotation spot if he exceeds expectations.

The Knicks are going to play 1 man in and 4 guys out a lot. There's going to be a lot of times where Towns is on the three-point line and brings his man out to guard him while Hart is under the basket for offensive rebounds and buckets around the basket. I don't think Hart will be asked to shoot outside shots as much as you think.

Hart talked about how much work he's been putting into his shot this off-season with his personal shooting coach. I have to assume that's something Thibs has spoken to him about his value there.

I have no doubt he wants to be a better shooter. I just don't think it's a necessity given how the Knicks added the best stretch big men in the NBA. The Knicks starting lineup will already have four above average three-point shooters. I'd rather have Hart work the offensive glass and cut to the basket for bunnies than hang out at the three-point line. It's a waste of what he does best.

Yeah the idea that Hart isn't going to get a trillion open looks from 3 just doesn't check out. He took 6 3s per game in the Sixers series. Teams are going to leave him open. It's on him to hit more than a third of them.

C: KAT (33 min)

BN: McBride (22 min)
BN: Payne (10 min)

BN: Shamet (15 min)

RES: Precious
RES: Kolek
RES: McCullar
RES: Hukporti
RES: Dadiet

Two-Way: Toppin
Two-Way: TBD
Two-Way: TBD

Knicks can still add two more players for the regular season


Sims will only see some spot minutes with bad foul trouble. And that is only while Robinson is hurt. If we are ever become whole with KAT, Robinson and Precious...Sims will never see the court under any circumstances.

While Robinson is out, Precious will be getting all the backup "big" minutes. Precious is a good player who brings that offensive rebounding we lost with I-Hart and M-Rob (while injured).

I also think Payne will get way more minutes than Shamet. Payne is a nice well rounded player that does a bunch of good things, but is also a good shooter (just as good as Shamet). Shamet really only shoots and that's it. But he could see some minutes as a shooter off the bench. I just think McBride and Payne will eat up nearly all the minutes off the bench as the guards.

Josh Hart won’t share all of his goals for the 2024-25 NBA season, but one is at the forefront of his mind:

“It’s to shoot better than 30% from three. That’s for damn sure. So I’m looking for that number to go up for sure. The attempts will go up, too.”
The Knicks got C James Nnaji from Charlotte;  
81_Great_Dane : 10/4/2024 1:44 pm : link
he was first pick of the second round in 2023. He's only 20 and right now he's a draft-and-stash, but I'm sure the Knicks are looking at him as eventual center depth.

Besides Hukporti, they also had Dmytro Skapkintsev at center in the Summer League, and he looked like a guy who could be coached up to be better than Sims. Skapintsev is a little older so I get that his future may not be in the NBA, but I give the Knicks credit for seeing they need depth at C, that Sims isn't really what they need, and that they might as well collect C prospects and see who develops.

I think Rokas Jokubaitis's rights get flipped as part of a trade for a draft pick. Jokubaitis is close to NBA ready and there's probably not a spot for him on the Knicks — but he could catch on with another team.

Likely on their Maine G-League team, but we'll see. With IHart leaving and Mitch hurt, it seems a little odd to me that Skap left. Was that his move or the Knicks'?
.  
DanMetroMan : 10/4/2024 2:03 pm : link
Skapintsev, 26, played in his home country of Ukraine from 2015-22 before heading stateside two years ago to join the Westchester Knicks in the G League. He has spent the majority of the past two seasons with New York’s G League affiliate, averaging 10.0 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.5 blocks in 23.9 minutes per game across 38 Showcase Cup and regular season outings in 2023/24.

Skapintsev earned a brief NBA call-up last December when he signed a two-way contract with the Knicks and appeared in two games for the club. However, he logged just two total minutes in those contests and was waived 10 days later, at which point he reported back to Westchester.

According to Scotto, Skapintsev will look to compete for a roster spot with the Celtics this fall. The 7’1″ center is unlikely to end up on the standard 15-man roster, but Exhibit 10 contracts can be converted to two-way deals before the regular season begins, so perhaps he’ll get an opportunity to unseat a current Boston two-way player (Drew Peterson, JD Davison, or Anton Watson) if he impresses in camp.

Exhibit 10 contracts can also line up a player to earn a bonus worth up to $77.5K if he’s waived by his NBA team and then spends at least 60 days with the club’s G League affiliate. The Maine Celtics would have to acquire Skapintsev’s returning rights for that to be an option for him.

I thought Skapintsev was promising  
81_Great_Dane : 10/4/2024 5:29 pm : link
but the new guys will replace him in the pipeline. Hukporti comes in now, Nnaji maybe next season, probably after Mitch is off the roster.
