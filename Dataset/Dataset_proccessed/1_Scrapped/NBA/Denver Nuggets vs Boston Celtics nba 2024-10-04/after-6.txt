The NBA preseason debuts this weekend with the third annual Abu Dhabi Games, a pair of contests tonight and Sunday at Etihad Arena on Yas Island featuring the league’s past two champions: the Celtics and Nuggets. The games will be televised across the Middle East and North Africa by beIN Media Group, which this week renewed its now 17-year broadcast partnership with the NBA.

As part of the event, the league will again activate an “NBA District’’ pop culture fanfest that has drawn over 10,000 people the last two seasons. Attendees will gain access to NBA legends such as Muggsy Bogues, Marcus Camby, Derek Fisher, Kevin Garnett and Mitch Richmond, along with an opportunity to play on a regulation NBA court, engage in pop-up activations, take photographs with the Larry O’Brien Trophy and buy limited-edition NBA merchandise.

On the Saturday off-day at the arena, the league will also offer an interactive “NBA Fan Appreciation Day’’ that will include a live performance from Grammy Award-winning artist 2 Chainz, cameos by Celtics and Nuggets players, and an independent slam dunk contest with pro dunkers. Ahead of the game, the league has also reprised “Jr. NBA Week,’’ a youth basketball development platform expected to attract 7,000 youth players, 450 coaches and a spate of referees for clinics in each category. The activation will also include a Special Olympics clinic and an NBA Basketball School tournament.

As for the BeIN network, its newest contract with the league allows for 400 live telecasts throughout the regular season and playoffs, broadcast in Arabic, English and French. According to YouGov, basketball remains the most-played team sport in the Middle East behind soccer with 3.9M participants. Data from YouGov also has 15.6M NBA fans in the Middle East, the most of any major U.S sports league there.
