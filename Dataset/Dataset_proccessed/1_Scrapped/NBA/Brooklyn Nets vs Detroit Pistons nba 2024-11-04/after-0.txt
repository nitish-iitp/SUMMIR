Brooklyn Nets head coach Jordi Fernández urged Ben Simmons to be more aggressive on offense.

"I want him to shoot more," Fernández told reporters on Sunday. "My goal for him is 10 [shots per game]. He's got to find a way to get there. He hasn't gotten there yet, but I know he can."

"I don't care about makes, misses," he added. "I just want to see that shots are going up. He's more than capable."

Jordi Fernandez on Ben Simmons attempting four shots in 25 minutes today:<br><br>"I want him to shoot more. My goal for him is 10 [shots per game]. He's gotta find a way to get there.

Simmons took just four shots during the Nets' 106-92 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, connecting on two of them. He finished with four points, six rebounds and six assists while turning the ball over three times.

The 28-year-old is averaging 4.3 attempts from the field per game in six appearances, which would represented the lowest mark of his career over the course of a full season. He hasn't put up more than five shots in a contest at the start of his 2024-25 campaign.

Simmons has still remained an efficient scorer at the rim despite the low volume, hitting 61.5 percent of his shots.

The three-time All-Star's decreased willingness to attack the basket has been a common theme throughout his career, as his scoring averaged declined in his final two years with the Philadelphia 76ers before he was traded to the Nets in Sept. 2022.

He's averaged just 6.6 points per game in 63 appearances with the organization.

Becoming a larger offensive threat could be beneficial for Simmons' long-term future as well as the present success of the team. His contract is set to expire and he'll become an unrestricted free agent during the 2025 offseason.

Simmons' next opportunity to meet the goal that Fernández set for him will come on Monday, as the Nets host the Memphis Grizzlies. Tip-off is at 8 p.m. ET.
