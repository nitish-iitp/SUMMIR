Knicks broadcaster talks about LaMelo Ball's inconsistency (Image credits: Imagn)

LaMelo Ball and the Charlotte Hornets tried to capture a win against the New York Knicks in their first preseason game on Sunday. The Hornets came up short and had a 111-109 loss to the away team. Ball was active and showed the fans that he was healthy and ready for the 2024-25 NBA season.

The star point guard only played for 19 minutes and that was still enough time for him to fill the stat sheet. Ball finished with 18 points, four rebounds, and seven assists. During the game, Knicks broadcasters Mike Breen and Alan Hahn gave their take on the point guard's future.

"When healthy, when not reckless in times with the ball," Breen said, "he is a special talent."

While Hahn agrees with Breen, he believes that his spot as the Hornets' face of the future is in trouble because of his injuries.

"He's a highlight film at any moment, because of the wizardry he has with the basketball and his vision. But what you just said though is pretty much his career so far, right?" Hahn said. "Cause there are times he's erratic and then there's also the injuries that he has dealt with that kept him out of the lineup for long periods of time."

The broadcaster went on to share that he believes Brandon Miller could take Ball's spot as the face of the franchise.

"He has had moments of brilliance. But this is a big year for him, I really truly believe that if he can't stay healthy and emerge as a player who's bought in, this is Brandon Miller's team going forward."

Over the past two seasons, Ball has only played 58 games. During the 2022-23 season, the former No. 3 pick only played for 36 games and was sidelined for the rest of the year. The same happened last season as he only suited up for 22 games before he was shut down due to injuries.

LaMelo Ball is doing his best to protect his ankles

For the first time in his career, LaMelo Ball has decided to wear ankle braces for the 2024-25 campaign. Ball already considered wearing one over the summer but confirmed this during the team's Media Day.

"I feel good and ready to play and then, they got me ankle braces," Ball said.

In his third year, Ball suffered a season-ending injury after he fractured his ankle. He underwent surgery, which was a success. Last season, it was the same case as the one-time All-Star suffered another ankle injury that limited his presence on the court.

Despite this, the Hornets believe that Ball is the point guard of their franchise's future. Over the summer, he signed a five-year, $203.8 million contract extension.
