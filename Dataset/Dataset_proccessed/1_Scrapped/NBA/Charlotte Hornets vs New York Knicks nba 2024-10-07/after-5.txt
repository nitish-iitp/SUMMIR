NEW YORK KNICKS
Josh Hart Nicknames Karl-Anthony Towns 'The Big Bodega' After Knicks Trade

New York Knicks guard Josh Hart christened Karl-Anthony Towns with a new nickname after the big man made his debut in Sunday's 111-109 preseason win over the Charlotte Hornets.

Hart dubbed Towns "The Big Bodega" on social media:

That may not stick as well as the "Bodega KAT" moniker the four-time All-Star quickly received, though.

Karl-Anthony Towns on the Bodega KAT nickname: "That's clever. That's pretty good."

Bodega cats have taken on a life of their own in New York City. They both serve a practical purpose and can be a welcome sight for residents stopping in at a nearby convenience store.

In that sense, it was only natural for a player often called "KAT" to wind up in the Big Apple.

He and fellow Knicks debutant Mikal Bridges had solid but largely forgettable showings against Charlotte. Towns had 10 points, four rebounds and two steals in 15 minutes on the floor, while Bridges put up four points and one rebound over 13 minutes.

"These guys are all super, super special and they are all very talented and they put the work in," Towns told reporters of his new team. "The coaches put us through drills that allow us to work on our skills and our timing."

For now, he and Knicks fans are firmly in their honeymoon phase. How long that remains will depend on his output on the court.

Some players, most notably Jalen Brunson right now, thrive in the pressure cooker that is the New York media market. Others fail to inspire a lot of goodwill despite having a Hall of Fame-caliber career or become a regular punching bag thanks to their regular struggles.

Should Towns play down to his playoff reputation when the time comes, the nicknames from the Knicks fanbase might become a lot less affectionate.
