HOME  THE MILESTONE THAT ONLY 2 PLAYERS IN HISTORY HAVE ACHIEVED: ONE OF THEM IS WEMBANYAMA
The milestone that only 2 players in history have achieved: One of them is Wembanyama

The Spurs star has joined a select group alongside Brook Lopez in one of the most challenging records to achieve in a game.

 JORGE P. BORREGUERO | SUN, 11/10/2024 - 19:00   
Victor Wembanyama, star of the San Antonio Spurs.

Despite the fact that his 2024/25 season start in the NBA is far from dreamlike, Victor Wembanyama continues to show glimpses of the great star he will be in the future. His physical attributes make him a unique player, capable of dominating all aspects of the game.

For this reason, the star of the San Antonio Spurs has achieved a new milestone in his career that, previously, only one player had achieved in the entire history: Brook Lopez.

In Saturday's game against the Utah Jazz, the Spurs lost 111-110, despite a performance of 24 points, 16 rebounds, 7 blocks, and 6-9 from three-point range (66.7%) by Wembanyama.

Victor Wembanyama is the 2nd player of all time in the NBA to have, in a single game, 7 or more blocks and score 6 or more three-pointers. Brook Lopez achieved this in 2017.
