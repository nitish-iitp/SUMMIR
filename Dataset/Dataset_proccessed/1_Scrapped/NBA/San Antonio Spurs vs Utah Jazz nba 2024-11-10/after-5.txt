When it comes to stuffing the stat sheet, few players do it quite like Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama.

Wemby had another monster game Saturday night with 24 points – including a career-high six 3-pointers – along with 16 rebounds and seven blocks as the Utah Jazz held off San Antonio 111-110. That stat line makes Wembanyama the first player in NBA history to record multiple games of 20+ points, 15+ rebounds, 5+ blocks and 5+ made 3-pointers.

He also became the second player in league history with six 3s and seven blocks in a game, joining Brook Lopez, who made six 3-pointers and blocked eight shots on Feb. 17, 2017.

At age 20, Wemby already has three career games with at least five 3-pointers and five blocks, which ties Kristaps Porzingis for the second most in NBA history. Raef LaFrentz did it four times.

And one more: Wembanyama now has 10 games with seven or more blocks, which makes him the youngest player to reach that mark in NBA history.

Youngest players with 10 career 7+ block games

20 years, 310 days – Victor Wembanyama (2024)
21 years, 325 days – Shaquille O’Neal (1994)
22 years, 217 days – Serge Ibaka (2012)
23 years, 64 days – Hakeem Olajuwon (1986)
23 years, 80 days – Benoit Benjamin (1988)

In his sophomore season, Wembanyama is averaging 18.3 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.4 steals and 4.0 blocks while shooting 42.5% from the field and 28.2% from 3-point range in 10 games. Just wait until he finds his stroke. Or maybe he just did.
