Victor Wembanyama Stats Tonight: How did Spurs star fare against Thunder? (Nov. 9) (Image credit: Imagn)

After a poor performance against the Portland Trail Blazers (12 points on 4-from-13 from the floor), Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs hosted the Utah Jazz at Frost Bank Center to try to reach the .500 mark and win their second straight game.

The Frenchman was more aggressive to start this game, first blocking Walker Kessler's 17-foot attempt and then scoring the Spurs' first three points from distance. He was active on both ends of the floor, getting defensive rebounds and blocking shots. He scored his sixth points of the quarter with another 3-pointer while adding more rebounds to the stat sheet.

Wembanyama scored eight more points in the second half while grabbing two more rebounds, but turned the ball over twice. He led the Spurs in scoring with 14 units, but the team entered halftime down 53-45.

Victor Wembanyama explains player's current contact with Gregg Popovich

On Friday, Victor Wembanyama talked about whether the Spurs' players have communicated with coach Gregg Popovich. The veteran coach has been away from the team due to an undisclosed health issue, but players have remained updated about the coach's condition.

The Frenchman said that they are receiving updates about Pop but they don't want to push boundaries and are respecting his privacy.

"We don't hear a lot from Pop, but let's say they keep us informed as much as we're allowed to know. So, I'm not worried about him. I know he's going to come back soon. But no, we're not talking to him directly."

The Spurs named Mitch Johnson as their interim head coach, who boasts a 1-3 record since taking over from Popovich.
