WagerTalk, the largest picks site online, offers NBA FREE PICKS every day, as well as cheap premium paid NBA picks from expert professional handicappers.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Zach LaVine Chicago Bulls Over 20.5 Points (-108)

Chicago Bulls shooting guard Zach LaVine has gone over this line in each of his first three games of the season with 22, 25 and 27 points for an average of 24.7 points per game.

Since the beginning of 2023, LaVine has cleared this line in 9 of 11 games without DeMar DeRozan in the mix. He also has a great track record against the Memphis Grizzlies recently with 36, 24 and 28 points in his last three head-to-head games.

The Grizzlies have allowed the 3rd most points to pick & roll ballhandlers as opposing teams pick on rookie Zach Edey and LaVine leads the Bulls in PnR scoring.

This game should be played at breakneck speed as these teams rank #1 and #4 in pace of play. LaVine will thrive in this environment as he ranks 3rd in the league in transition scoring.

NBA Player Props Predictions: Luka Doncic Dallas Mavericks Over 9.5 Assists (+112) FD

Luka Doncic has only recorded a combined 12 assists through the first two games of the season, but this is an elite matchup for him post his first double digit effort.

The Utah Jazz have allowed the MOST assists overall in the NBA including the 2nd most to opposing point guards.

The main reason why is because they allow the 2nd most catch & shoot shots in the league to open the season with 36 per game.

The Jazz also allow the 7th least points per possession to pick & roll ballhandlers. They deploy a scheme to stop ballhandlers from scoring & forcing them to dish and they will definitely stick to that against Doncic.

Doncic cleared this line in 3 of 4 head-to-head games against Utah with 13, 8, 14 and 11 dimes on a staggering 17, 17, 17 and 26 potential assists.

His usage is right where it was last season and with Klay Thompson on the court, the assists will come. This is the perfect matchup for his first double digit assist performance.
