Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins started Zach Edey to anchor a frontline featuring Jaren Jackson Jr. and Santi Aldama against the Chicago Bulls. Instead of benching one to start Monday’s game, Jenkins opted to roll out a massive frontcourt. The rookie ended the first quarter with two points, four rebounds and altered multiple shots around the rim.

Jenkins changed his frontcourt to start the second quarter. Instead of a three-big lineup, he used "JJJ" and Brandon Clarke to go with Marcus Smart, Jake LaRavia and Jaylen Wells. Edey came off the bench with 7:43 remaining in the period and ended the first half with six points and five rebounds.

After making a 3-pointer on Saturday against the Orlando Magic, Edey took two versus the Bulls but missed both.

Edey started the second half for the Memphis Grizzlies but couldn't add to his box score. Backup center Jay Huff took him out with 7:55 remaining in the third quarter. The former Purdue star wouldn't get off the bench as the Chicago Bulls, which trailed 68-54 at halftime, cut the deficit to 100-93 before the fourth quarter started.

Zach Edey has been a non-factor for the Memphis Grizzlies in the second half this season

Zach Edey played 14 minutes on Monday against the Chicago Bulls, five of which came in the second half. It has been the trend so far for the 7-foot-4 big man. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins has relied on Santi Aldama or even backup big man Jay Huff past the first half.

In the Grizzlies' 124-111 battering of the Orlando Magic on Saturday, Edey hardly saw action in the last half. He finished with seven points and one rebound and had a +/- rating of -12, the worst among the starters.

Edey hasn't gained Jenkins' trust yet, particularly when games get tight in the second half. Santi Aldama played center for the most part in the loss to the Bulls—Huff's 18 minutes were four more than what the rookie got.
