The Chicago Bulls shared some bad news Tuesday night about point guard Lonzo Ball.

Ball sustained a right wrist sprain in the first quarter of Monday's win over the Memphis Grizzlies and will be re-evaluated in 10 days.

The 27-year-old's return to the court has been one of the early feel-good stories of the NBA season after knee issues kept him away from the Bulls for nearly three seasons.

So far this season, Ball has averaged 4.7 points and 3.7 assists over three games. He is averaging just over 15 minutes of play.

He had six points and six assists before leaving on Monday.

The Bulls said they would provide updates on his status as appropriate.
