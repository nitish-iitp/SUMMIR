INJURIES
Expected back in 3-to-6 weeks
Williams is progressing well in his recovery from a Grade 3 right ankle sprain and the team expects him to return to game action in 3-to-6 weeks.
Impact Williams sustained the ankle injury on Nov. 19 in just his third matchup back following a 12-game absence due to a left tibial stress reaction. With the 24-year-old still expected to miss significant time, Santi Aldama and Jake LaRavia should continue receiving extended minutes. Williams is coming off a productive 2023-24 campaign, during which he averaged 10.0 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 0.9 steals while shooting 37.8 percent from three-point range across 27.6 minutes per contest in 52 regular-season outings.

Out at least four weeks
The Grizzlies announced Thursday that Williams has been diagnosed with a Grade 3 right ankle sprain and will be re-evaluated in approximately four weeks.
Impact Williams suffered his ankle injury during the second quarter of Tuesday's game versus the Nuggets and will now be sidelined for an extended period. In his absence, Santi Aldama, Jake LaRavia and John Konchar (illness) are candidates to receive increased playing time.

Won't play Wednesday
Williams (ankle) will not play Wednesday against the 76ers.
Impact Williams suffered a right ankle sprain Tuesday against the Nuggets and was unable to return, so it's not a surprise to see him being held out Wednesday. Marcus Smart (illness) and John Konchar (illness) are both doubtful, catapulting Luke Kennard and Jake LaRavia onto the streaming radar.

Doesn't return against Denver
Williams (ankle) closed with four points (2-6 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and five rebounds in seven minutes during Tuesday's 122-110 loss to the Nuggets.
Impact Williams was considered doubtful to return after exiting Tuesday's contest with 3:14 remaining in the second quarter due to a right ankle injury and didn't see any more action. The 24-year-old forward's next chance to suit up is Wednesday's matchup with Philadelphia.

Unlikely to return Tuesday
Williams (ankle) is doubtful to return to Tuesday's game versus the Nuggets, Kelly Iko of The Athletic reports.
Impact Williams saw just seven minutes of action before suffering a right ankle injury in the second quarter of Tuesday's contest. In his expected absence, Santi Aldama and John Konchar could receive extended playing time off the bench in Memphis' forward rotation.

Impact Williams tallied four points (2-6 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and five rebounds in seven minutes before exiting Tuesday's contest. If the 24-year-old forward is unable to return, Santi Aldama and John Konchar are candidates to receive increased playing time.

Sees just 14 minutes
Williams provided three points (1-4 FG, 1-3 3Pt), one rebound and five assists in 14 minutes during Sunday's 105-90 win over Denver.
Impact This was a disappointing workload for Williams, as the Grizzlies opted to get Luke Kennard and Jake LaRavia more involved off the bench Sunday. Williams has plenty of upside as he demonstrated many times last season, but it will be tough for him to provide consistent value with such a sporadic role.

Well-rounded line off bench
Williams (tibia) played 24 minutes off the bench and finished with nine points (4-9 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 1-4 FT), five rebounds, four assists and two blocks in Friday's 123-118 loss to the...
Impact Poor shooting from the free-throw line aside, Williams delivered quality numbers across the board in his season debut, after having missed the Grizzlies' first 12 games with a left tibial stress reaction. Williams' return to action coincided with Desmond Bane's (27 minutes) return, and with Marcus Smart (ankle) also playing in his second contest following a multi-game absence due to injury, the Grizzlies are now back to full strength on the wing. As a result, Williams may not see his minutes pick up dramatically from what he received Friday, which could make it difficult for him to re-emerge as a meaningful asset in 12-team category leagues.

Available to play Friday
Williams (lower leg) is available for Friday's game against the Warriors.
Impact Williams went through Friday's shootaround and will be eligible to return in this contest. However, he's not expected to play a significant role coming off the bench, so his fantasy upside in most slates should be minimal.

Goes through shootaround
Williams (lower leg) went through shootaround ahead of Friday's game versus the Warriors, Damichael Cole of The Memphis Commercial Appeall reports.
Impact Williams is officially listed as questionable for Friday's contest after missing Memphis' first 12 games while recovering from a left tibial stress reaction. However, Williams' participation in shootaround is a good sign of his availability against Golden State.

Upgraded to questionable for Friday
Williams (lower leg) is listed as questionable for Friday's game versus the Warriors.
Impact Williams has yet to make his debut in the 2024-25 campaign, though the questionable tag suggests he is nearing a return to game action. The 24-year-old has been ramping up for a return with the G League's Memphis Hustle, but if he is unable to suit up Friday his next chance to debut will come Sunday against Denver.

Officially out
Williams (lower leg) won't play in Wednesday's game against the Lakers.
Impact Williams was labeled doubtful for the contest, so his absence doesn't come as much of a surprise. He'll look to make his 2024-25 debut Friday against Golden State.

Doubtful for Wednesday
Williams (lower leg) is listed as doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers.
Impact Williams has been ramping up for a return to game action with the Memphis Hustle in the G League. However, he is still unlikely to make his season debut against Los Angeles while recovering from a stress reaction in the upper portion of his left tibia.

Practicing in G League
The Grizzlies announced Thursday that Williams (lower leg) has been assigned to the Memphis Hustle of the G League for practice but will be recalled to the NBA immediately after.
Impact Williams has yet to play this season while dealing with a stress reaction in the upper portion of his left tibia. While Williams appears to be ramping up toward a return, he is expected to remain sidelined for a few more weeks.

Will remain out for multiple weeks
The Grizzlies announced Friday that Williams (lower leg) continues to progress in his rehab and is expected to return to play within 2-to-4 weeks.
Impact Williams missed all of training camp and the preseason due to a stress reaction in the upper portion of his left tibia, and he's remained sidelined to start the regular season. After a breakout season for the injury-riddled Grizzlies last season, Williams will be looking at a reduced role when cleared, especially if Memphis is healthy.

Out until at least November
Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins said Monday that Williams (shin) is "still a couple weeks away" from being ready for game action, Damichael Cole of The Memphis Commercial Appea...
Impact Williams will likely be re-evaluated later this month before the Grizzlies potentially clear him to resume basketball activities, but he'll require some ramp-up time after he missed all of training camp and the preseason with a stress reaction in the upper portion of his left tibia. As a second-year player in 2023-24, Williams saw ample playing time for a Grizzlies squad that was decimated by injuries, finishing the season with 10.0 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.5 three-pointers, 0.9 steals and 0.7 blocks in 27.6 minutes over his 56 appearances. He should be part of the rotation when healthy, but Williams will be looking at a smaller role if the likes of Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Marcus Smart are able to stay on the court more frequently in 2024-25.

Out at least four weeks
The Grizzlies announced Thursday that imaging has revealed a stress reaction in the upper portion of Williams' tibia and he will be re-evaluated in approximately four weeks.
Impact While Williams is expected to make a full recovery, he will almost certainly miss all of training camp and the preseason. The 24-year-old forward could remain sidelined for Memphis' regular-season opener on Oct. 23 against Utah. Williams is slated to be one of the Grizzlies' top forward options off the bench when healthy this season.

Out Sunday
Williams (knee) is out for Sunday's game against the Nuggets.
Impact Williams missed each of Memphis' final 18 games, but his absence is not a surprise, as the Grizzlies decided to essentially shut down their roster a few weeks ago. Williams ends his second year in The Association with averages of 10.0 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 0.9 steals across 27.6 minutes per game in 52 appearances (33 starts).

Won't face Lakers on Friday
Williams (knee) is out for Friday's game against the Lakers.
Impact Williams is set to miss a 17th consecutive game Friday, and given the Grizzlies have been playing an eight-men rotation in recent contests, it wouldn't be shocking if Williams is also out for the season finale against the Nuggets on Sunday.

Remains out
Williams (knee) has been ruled out for Wednesday's game in Cleveland.
Impact Williams is slated to miss a 16th straight game due to left patellar tendonitis. He has only two more chances to suit up this season -- Friday versus the Lakers and Sunday against Denver.

Still out
Williams (knee) has been ruled out for Tuesday's game against the Spurs.
Impact Williams' breakout campaign has come to a screeching halt, as he'll miss a 15th straight game due to left patellar tendonitis. It's unclear if he'll suit up again this season, but his next chance will come during the second half of Memphis' back-to-back set Wednesday in Cleveland.

Another absence coming
Williams (knee) won't play in Saturday's game versus the 76ers.

Ruled out for Friday
Williams (knee) is out for Friday's game against the Pistons.
Impact Williams hasn't suited up since March 8 due to left patellar tendinitis, and that streak will now reach 13 games. He's also quite likely to miss the Saturday matchup against the 76ers, and at this point, it wouldn't be shocking if the Grizzlies rule him out for the rest of the season in the coming days.

Impact Williams next opportunity to take the court comes Friday versus the Pistons. The rookie has not played since March eighth due to ongoing patellar tendinitis in his left knee.
