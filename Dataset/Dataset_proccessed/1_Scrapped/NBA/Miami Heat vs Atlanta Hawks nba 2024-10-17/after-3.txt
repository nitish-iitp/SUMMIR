Miami Heat All-Star forward Jimmy Butler had a nifty ball game against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday at home, leading his team to a 120-111 victory, the third straight win in preseason play.

Miami had a ferocious 24-7 run late in the third period to blow open what was erstwhile a close contest. The Heat held a 103-84 lead heading into the fourth and final quarter and never looked back from there.

Jimmy Butler looking to play in as many games as possible in upcoming NBA season

Jimmy Butler said he is looking to play in as many games as possible in the upcoming 2024-25 NBA season to help the Miami Heat compete better.

The six-time NBA All-Star shared this in an interview with the Miami Herald, underscoring that provided that he is healthy, the goal is to participate in as many games as he can and win.

He said:

"I want to play as many games as possible. I'll leave it at that. I don't need to put a number on the amount of games that I play."

Butler added:

"I know the more games that I play, the more opportunities that my squad has of winning. I do know that."

Last season, Jimmy Butler played in 60 games, averaging 20.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, 5 assists and 1.3 steals in 34 minutes. He helped the Heat reach the playoffs for a fifth straight time by way of the play-in phase as the eighth seed. They fell to eventual NBA champions Boston Celtics in five games in the opening round.

The last time that Butler played in all 82 games was during his sophomore year in the 2012-2013 season with the Chicago Bulls.

Jimmy Butler is on the second year of the 3-year, $146.4-million contract he signed with the Heat in 2023. He has a player option in the 2025-26 season, which he is reportedly considering declining in favor of seeking a maximum extension in free agency.
