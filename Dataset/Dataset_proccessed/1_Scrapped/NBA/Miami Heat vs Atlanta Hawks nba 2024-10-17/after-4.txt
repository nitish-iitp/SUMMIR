MIAMI HEAT
Pat Riley, Jimmy Butler 'Haven't Had a Lot of Conversation' About New Heat Contract

Pat Riley and Jimmy Butler "haven't had a lot of conversation" about Butler's future with the Miami Heat in the words of the team president.

"I've talked to his agent at times," Riley said, per Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald. "... I don't have to sit down and have these meetings with [Butler] any more. He's a very intelligent man."

Butler can hit free agency next summer if he declines his $52.4 million player option. Shams Charania reported for The Athletic in June the six-time All-Star didn't plan on signing an extension with Miami or another team prior to his opt-out window.

During Thursday's chat with the assembled media, Riley said he "wouldn't want to" when asked about the possibility of Butler leaving as a free agent.

The legendary executive and former head coach also discussed how Miami is entering its sixth season with Butler playing alongside Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro. He said "this is a telling year for the team" but didn't promise a major reshuffle if it falls short of expectations

"Everything changes, I think, for the better with continuity and the fact that we believe in this roster," Riley said. "Does it mean that if we don't win this year or if we don't go deep this year, there are going to be massive changes? No, it doesn't mean that. But they should know that this should be a crucial year for them. They want to win. They've been [to the NBA Finals] twice, but they want to win."

Drama always surrounds a star player on an expiring deal and it's magnified with Butler for a number of reasons.

If the situation were as straightforward as giving the 35-year-old max years and cash, then he'd probably have a new contract in hand by now.

With the more restrictive collective bargaining agreement in place, the Heat are right to question how much they can reasonably pay an aging player who hasn't logged 70-plus appearances since 2016-17 and whose game went backward last season.

At the same time, Riley and the rest of Miami's front office know how a contractural dispute with Butler can turn bad very quickly. He went scorched earth on the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2018 to force his way out.

For now, Butler is incentivized to make the most of his 2024-25 season so he'll be in the best possible position in free agency.

Should Miami get off to a disappointing start, it could test his commitment to the organization and how much the Heat want to keep him around.
