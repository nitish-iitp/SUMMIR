History
The Los Angeles Lakers fell to the Phoenix Suns 109-105, marking their first loss of the season after a strong 3-0 start. Despite leading by 18 points early in the game, the Lakers could not maintain their advantage, with LeBron James scoring only 11 points on 3-of-14 shooting, although he extended his streak of double-digit scoring games. Anthony Davis and Austin Reaves put up strong performances, scoring 29 and 23 points respectively, but the Suns, led by Devin Booker with 33 points and Kevin Durant with 30, rallied back. A critical moment came when James, with the Lakers trailing by three, intentionally missed a free throw but failed to secure the rebound, allowing the Suns to seal the win with free throws from Bradley Beal. Lakers' head coach JJ Redick took responsibility for not adjusting the defense earlier in the fourth quarter to counter Durant's strategy. The Lakers will face the Cleveland Cavaliers next, while the Suns will play the Los Angeles Clippers.
+10
LeBron James had a challenging game, entering the fourth quarter with only seven points and finishing with an NBA-record streak of 1,226 games with at least 10 points.
Anthony Davis was a key contributor with 29 points and 15 rebounds, continuing to demonstrate his value as the primary offensive option for the Lakers.
Kevin Durant's late-game strategy of 'hunting' smaller defenders was pivotal to the Suns' comeback, allowing him to score crucial points over mismatched defenders.
JJ Redick acknowledged that he could have adjusted the defense earlier in the fourth quarter to better handle Durant's strategy, taking responsibility for the loss.
The Lakers' strong start to the season (3-1) ties for their best in the LeBron James era, reminiscent of their championship-winning season in 2019-20.
