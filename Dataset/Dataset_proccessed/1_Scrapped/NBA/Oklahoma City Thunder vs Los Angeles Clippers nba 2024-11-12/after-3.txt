Playing without Holmgren, and with several other frontcourt players injured as well, the Thunder went with a smaller lineup.

Oklahoma City thrived for much of the game after starting Williams with Aaron Wiggins and Dort in the frontcourt.

The Thunder led for much of the game, building their lead to 20 by midway through the third.

But the Clippers finally had success on the interior over the last half of the quarter, reeling off a 25-10 run to cut the deficit to five heading into the fourth.

Zubac had six points and a block during the run, while Norman Powell had 12 points.

Powell had a pair of steals in the final two minutes of the quarter that led to points on the other end.
