The Oklahoma City Thunder took down the Los Angeles Clippers 134-128 in a thriller on Monday. The game was the Clippers’ second loss to the Thunder this year and it snapped a four-game winning streak for the blue and white.

The loss was just one of many disappointing close finishes that the Clippers have suffered this season.

Oklahoma City’s star point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led both teams in scoring with a career-high 45 points on the night. He decimated Los Angeles with his ability to draw fouls, as he shot 16 free throws on the night and made 15.

Forward Jalen Williams also made big contributions for the Thunder in the absence of Chet Holmgren, adding in 28 points on nearly 70% shooting from the field.

For the Clippers, Norman Powell acted as the steadiest source of offense once again, as he scored 31 points on 66% shooting.

The bulk of his points came in the third quarter when the Clippers sparked a 30-10 run to cut a 20-point deficit down to five. Powell led his team with 18 points in the period, including an awe-inspiring fadeaway corner three-pointer to end the quarter.

Powell has been easily the best player for the Clippers this season 11 games into the year. He’s averaging a career-high 26.0 points a game—tied for 11th in the NBA. He’s also 11th in three-point percentage despite being one of the higher-volume three-point shooters in the league.

Center Ivica Zubac and forward Derrick Jones also had stellar, efficient performances in the loss. Zubac had a double-double with 22 points and 14 rebounds, and Derrick Jones had 20 points on 60% shooting.

Zubac, similarly to Powell, is also having a career season so far, putting up averages of 16.9 points per game and 12.8 rebounds, both career highs.

While the Clippers’ supporting cast members showed up last night, just like all year, their star, James Harden, hasn’t been consistent when they’ve needed him to be.

Amid his peers’ wildly efficient scoring nights, Harden stuck out among the worst out of the Clippers’ starters. He shot 33% from the field on 15 shots and turned the ball over five times. As has been the case in recent years, he still contributed through his playmaking ability, putting up nine assists and 11 rebounds on the night, but the Clippers are going to need more scoring from their current number-one option if they want to close out games like this.

This year, inefficient shooting nights have become commonplace for Harden. The 35-year-old is currently having the worst shooting season of his career by far, shooting an abysmal 35.7% from the field and 30.1% from beyond the arc. He’s also averaging 5.2 turnovers per game—the most in the league. His five last night likely could’ve been the difference between the Clippers’ four-point loss and a close win.

Many of the Clippers’ losses this year, like Monday, have been caused by momentary lapses or shooting droughts during important periods of play, which both can be attributed to untimely turnovers or missed shots on the offensive end.

The Clippers are so close to taking wins versus some of the best teams in the league. They just need to clean up the costly mistakes that consistently hurt them, and a lot of that will start with Harden. To beat playoff-caliber teams like the Thunder, L.A. will need consistency from its floor general.

The Clippers play Wednesday at 5 p.m. on the road against the Houston Rockets.
