Shai Gilgeous-Alexander reflects on 2024 NBA playoffs, wants to better prepare teammates

Experience may be the best teacher, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is trying to speedrun through the Oklahoma City Thunder's playoff hardships.

As the Thunder navigate through a reality without Chet Holmgren for the next two-plus months, Gilgeous-Alexander sees the foreseeable future as a chance to elevate his teammates. The 26-year-old scored a career-high 45 points in a close win over the LA Clippers but noted he played within the flow and minimized hero ball.

It's part of a long-term strategy. Gilgeous-Alexander is willing to sacrifice some regular-season success if it means his teammates are better prepared to contribute in the playoffs. In last year's playoff run, the offense dipped.

By the end of OKC's second-round series against the Dallas Mavericks, the offense stagnated. Gilgeous-Alexander was forced to hit bail-out shot after bail-out shot. Jalen Williams struggled to make an impact and faded into the background.

Against the Clippers, Williams scored a season-high 28 points. The Thunder hope the 23-year-old can replicate those types of numbers during this upcoming stretch as he'll be heavily leaned on as OKC's second scorer. It can also be a springboard for a monster playoff outing this year.

“I don't say this to slight my teammates,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. "But I feel like the end of our season last year, in the playoffs — obviously for a lot of them it was the first time in the playoffs and playing games that meaningful. And I don't want to say they weren't ready, but I feel like I could have equipped them better throughout the year in taking shots, getting to spots and being more comfortable in certain positions on the court, especially offensively.”

Trial and error is usually involved for young cores. Typically speaking, a contender must go through a handful of playoff exits before ultimately reaching the mountaintop. On the way up there, they learn something new about their roster and ways to improve it.

Gilgeous-Alexander wants to avoid that multi-year process.

"When we lost, I thought about why we lost," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "Obviously, there are so many things to nitpick. At the end of the day, I can only control what I can control. I try to look at it through that lens. I think that's one of the things I can definitely control through my play on a night-to-night basis."

No silver linings exist without Holmgren. He's been integral to the Thunder's success the last two years. But when one door closes, another opens. The win total might not reach 55-plus, but the baptism-by-fire opportunity for the non-SGA players on the roster could pay dividends when it matters most.

"A lot of people don't recognize it until it's too late and I don't want it to be too late," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "So I try to hit it on the head early."
