Yesterday's action. Sadly, Chet Holmgren suffered serious injury, OKC playing back to back against streaking Clippers, good chance for the ships to grab their 5th W in a row. Suns lost to Sacramento and their clutch King Demar, Suns were holding second longest winning streak at 7, but it ended there, only their second loss overall. Unbeaten Cavaliers being tested today.

Longest winning streaks :

CAVALIERS : 11 WINS in a row, next game @BULLS TONIGHT
NUGGETS : 5 WINS in a row, next game @PELICANS
CLIPPERS : 4 WINS in a row, next game @THUNDER TONIGHT

Longest losing streaks :

PELICANS : 4 LOSSES in a row, next game vsNETS TONIGHT
WIZARDS : 4 LOSSES in a row, next game @ROCKETS TONIGHT
RAPTORS : 4 LOSSES in a row, next game @BUCKS
TRAIL BLAZERS : 3 LOSSES in a row, next game @TIMBERWOLVES

This is way late, but I am listening to No Dunks right now, shout out, and Trey mentioned that while playing Raptors, Norman Powell had his first NBA double double ever! He played over 560 NBA games, and usually plays decent amount of minutes, isn't it crazy it was his first ever double double? Like damn, he is only 2.6 rpg. and 1.5. apg. career. talk about a guy who escaped the black hole accusations, at least I have never hear him mentioned, this guy does not get assists (and his doubel double was with rebounds, his assist all time high is 6!)

Just wanted to say thanks for posting this stuff. I enjoy your and Bisme's daily dose of schedule/streaks, it's good community stuff you can rely on that the internet doesn't offer much of anymore.

Norm has always been known as a microwave type, in the same mold of Lou Gotti or Crawford, but has never been in a spotlight to where he could be called a black hole.

That said, expecting another efficient 25+ point game from him, and with no Chet, expecting Zu to have around a 15/13 type of game..

Kings at Spurs is the only really appealing game today

Really disappointed in Chicago, first two weeks of the season they were a surprising and very fun and competitive team to watch. Now they are back to pure mediocrity

It would be extremely 'Bulls' to win this game and go on a mini win streak to give management hope and **** up their Flagg odds.

Clips need to live at the line the rest of this quarter with the foul trouble if they want to have a chance to take this one

Down one after a putrid first quarter to the Thunder....I'll take that any day. On the flip side, not a single foul was called on the Clips, when that balances out and if Clips still shoot this bad, will be, at least, a 15 point loss

Edit: and the first foul was a nice veteran flop by Caruso
