StubHub’s 2024-25 NBA Season Preview
Published: October 10, 2024


Olympics Momentum Brings On Big International Demand; New York Knicks Top Ticket Sales
Overall League Numbers Continue Upward Trend; Minnesota Timberwolves Record Highest Growth in Sales


Ahead of the 2024-25 NBA season, StubHub, the world’s leading marketplace to buy and sell tickets to any live event, has released its annual NBA Season Preview revealing the top-selling teams, games and trends of the season. StubHub has seen a 32% increase in sales across the league compared to last season’s start, with ticket buyers on StubHub and its international marketplace, viagogo, coming from 127 countries - 40% more countries than last year. On the heels of last season’s exciting playoff run, the New York Knicks lead preseason demand, while the reigning champion Boston Celtics at #2 have nearly double the sales over last season.


	"The spotlight on basketball this summer at the Olympics, especially Team USA, is no doubt having an impact on sales this season - international demand for the NBA on StubHub is experiencing rapid growth. It’s a trend we’re seeing across sports leagues, as many international travelers are purchasing tickets to a sporting event during their stay in the U.S."

— Adam Budelli, spokesperson for StubHub	


As the world’s leading live event marketplace, StubHub provides the most robust look at consumer trends and behaviors of NBA ticket buyers. Our in-depth trend insights stem from our unparalleled global presence, connecting buyers from over 200 countries and territories to a global catalog of more than 100 million event tickets worldwide each year.
