Zaccharie Risacher, Hawks eye revenge vs. Wizards

The top two picks from this year’s NBA Draft will meet for the second time in three days on Wednesday when the Washington Wizards host the Atlanta Hawks.

Atlanta’s No. 1 overall selection, Zaccharie Risacher, and No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr of Washington squared off for the first time Monday in the Wizards’ come-from-behind 121-119 victory over the host Hawks.

The 19-year-old Risacher, who made his second career start, struggled from the field, scoring just four points on 1-for-8 shooting. The 6-foot-9 forward is averaging 7.3 points and 2.5 rebounds through four games.

Sarr fared better in his first NBA win, scoring seven points on 3-for-11 shooting, adding nine rebounds and two blocks. Also just 19, the 7-footer is averaging seven points and 6.7 rebounds per game in three games.

For Washington, coming off a franchise-worst 15-67 record, a pair of veterans willed the Wizards to their first win. Trailing by 13 at one point, Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma caught fire, leading the team with 26 and 25 points, respectively.

Poole’s stepback 3-pointer with 51 seconds left extended Washington’s lead to 118-112, and he later connected on two free throws with 12.7 seconds remaining.

“I was just trying to find ways to keep our team composed,” Poole said. “Tonight was a really big win for us, really big for our morale. We were able to stay connected, offensively and defensively. We have talented guys, guys that work extremely hard. It’s good to get that first win in the books, not only for our team but for coach (Brian Keefe) as well.”

Keefe took over the reins midway through last season following the firing of Wes Unseld Jr., and picked up his first victory following the interim tag being removed in May.

Kuzma (groin) will miss the rematch.

Just four games into the season, Atlanta has already been struck with the injury bug.

The Hawks will be without Bogdan Bogdanovic (hamstring) for approximately a month after he underwent a non-surgical procedure Tuesday. Bogdanovic hasn’t played since the season opener and will be re-evaluated in four weeks, the team announced Tuesday.

De’Andre Hunter (knee) sat out Monday’s game and is questionable for Wednesday. Dyson Daniels (right hip flexor strain) was injured in Monday’s game and won’t play Wednesday, while Vit Krejci (adductor strain) will also miss the game and will be re-evaluated in two weeks.

“I mean, we didn’t have depth,” Atlanta coach Quin Snyder said. “We can’t control those things. The biggest thing we can try to do is execute in the things that we can. Do our best to overcome it and not point to it. The guys that we do have need to be ready to go.”

Despite the loss, a welcomed sight for Atlanta was Jalen Johnson’s first big game of the year.

The fourth-year forward signed a five-year, $150 million contract on Oct. 21, following a breakout season of 16 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game last year. Johnson had struggled entering Monday but scored a career-high 29 points to go along with 12 rebounds and seven assists.

“(Jalen) was terrific tonight,” Snyder said. “When he’s attacking the rim and making plays for other people, his offense has a way of coming to him. … He found a real rhythm. That’s the way we need him to play.”

This season, Johnson is averaging 15.8 points, 9.5 rebounds and four assists.
