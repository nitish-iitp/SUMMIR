Bronny James silences mouths with a massive game against the Golden State Warriors

LeBron's son ended with 17 points before those from the Bay Area in their heavy defeat

Bronny James, player for the Los Angeles Lakers.

The Los Angeles Lakers fell clearly defeated yesterday against Golden State Warriors in a game that, however, could mark a before and after in the history of Bronny James, who completed his best minutes by far in the purple and gold uniform.

LeBron James' son finished the duel with 17 points (7 of 17 from the field), 4 rebounds, and 3 steals in 35 minutes of play: "I had a great feeling going out there and playing without overthinking."

To appreciate his performance yesterday, in which the Lakers only played with substitutes, it must be said that in the previous 5 preseason games, he had scored a total of 8 points (4 of 20 shooting with 0 of 7 from three-point range) and had turned the ball over 5 times.

With Reddick's Confidence

"I think for him and for all of our younger players, every moment is a building block," commented coach JJ Reddick after the game. "Not just the good moments. The bad moments are learning opportunities. I think patience and optimism are required. I have a lot of confidence in the work ethic of our young players."

"So, again, I think for him, I'm sure it felt good to have 17 points. ... I'm not even remotely worried about that. It's not even on my radar. We are trying to help him become a great basketball player," he concluded.
