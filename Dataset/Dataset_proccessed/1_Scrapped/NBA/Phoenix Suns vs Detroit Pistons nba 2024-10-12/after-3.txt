Kevin Durant maintains commitment with the Phoenix Suns

Kevin Durant knows that having changed teams the past years that there are some who view his commitment with the Phoenix Suns with apprehension. He, however, allayed fears over his tenure in the Valley by coming out and saying he loves playing in Arizona and buys into what the team is trying to accomplish.

The two-time NBA champion shared this in an interview with the Arizona’s Family news site, reiterating his commitment with the Suns, who he is still under contract to until the 2025-26 season.

“There is always going to be speculation about my future. That’s somewhat a part of my brand now," said Durant. "I played with a couple of franchises in the NBA. So it’s natural coming to a league that fans and media members and people who don’t know me quite as well, confused on what my future may hold.
"A lot can change in anybody’s life in two years. So I just tend to focus on the moment. Realize that I’m locked into this team, guaranteed for the next two years. They know how much I love being here. They know how much they want me here, and we’ll figure that stuff out as we move forward.”

Prior to joining the Suns, Durant played for the Seattle SuperSonics/OKC Thunder; Golden State Warriors, where he won his two NBA titles; and Brooklyn Nets. With the Suns, he has had averages of 27 points, 6.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.2 blocks in 83 games so far.
