Why is Devin Booker not playing vs. Pistons? Reason behind Suns' 4xNBA All-Star's absence revealed. (Source: Imagn)

The Phoenix Suns faced off against the Detroit Pistons in their third NBA preseason game without star guard Devin Booker. In Booker's absence, head coach Mike Budenholzer started a lineup featuring Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Tyus Jones, Ryan Dunn and Mason Plumlee.

Booker, a four-time NBA All-Star, sat out due to right ankle soreness. According to Suns reporter Duane Rankin, the team is being cautious with the two-time Olympic gold medalist, particularly given that it's a preseason game.

Booker played in both of Phoenix's previous preseason games before sitting out. In the preseason opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 6, the former Kentucky standout logged 14 minutes and scored 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting, including 3-of-6 from beyond the arc. He also contributed two rebounds and three assists.

Devin Booker on managing his health

At the Phoenix Suns' media day, Devin Booker was asked about maintaining peak physical condition as he enters his 10th NBA season. The former Kentucky standout openly shared how he’s learned to manage his body, taking cues from seasoned veterans like Kevin Durant and Chris Paul.

“I’m always a sponge. You’ll see guys all have their different kind of ways to stay healthy," Booker said via The Arizona Republic. "KD is obviously somebody, you know, that I’ve watched closely ... he’s just a hooper. I think his love for the game is what keeps him going. And I’ve had plenty of guys around.
"Chris [Paul] was somebody who was over-obsessive about his body, taking care of his body, you know, so I take bits and pieces from everybody I’m around, and just try to implement it, but, you know, I still do feel really good," he added.

In his nine NBA seasons, Booker has yet to play a full 82-game regular season. Last year, the four-time All-Star appeared in 68 games for the Suns, averaging 27.1 points on 49.2% shooting from the field, including 36.4% from 3-point range.

The most games Booker has played in a single season was 78 during the 2016-17 campaign. Notably, in the past four seasons, Booker has not reached the 70-game mark.
