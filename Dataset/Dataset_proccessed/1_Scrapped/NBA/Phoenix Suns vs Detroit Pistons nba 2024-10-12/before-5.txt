Anthony Edwards debuted on Friday for the Minnesota Timberwolves this season against the Philadelphia 76ers. “Ant-Man,” who sat out in his team’s preseason-opening 124-107 win versus the LA Lakers, struggled early on. He had two points in the first quarter and missed all three of his 3-point attempts.

The All-Star guard finally hummed on offense late in the second quarter. He had seven points in the last 2:30 seconds to finish with 11. Edwards also dished a couple of assists as the Timberwolves took a 70-53 lead in front of a loud crowd in Des Moines, Iowa.

What was Anthony Edwards’ impact against Philadelphia 76ers?

Edwards had a rough shooting night to open the game for Minnesota but remained aggressive. Even when he wasn’t scoring, Philadelphia’s defense concentrated on him. Kelly Oubre Jr., Caleb Martin and Paul George all had their eyes on the explosive star.

Edwards’ offense wasn’t on point early on but his defense never slackened. He was engaged and had little trouble guarding four positions. The 6-foot-4 guard held up when forced to matchup against Andre Drummond, the 76ers’ hulking center.

Minnesota’s five-year guard has become an even more vocal leader on and off the floor without Karl-Anthony Towns. Following Towns’ trade to the New York Knicks, “Ant-Man” was busy on the sidelines or the court talking and cheering for his teammates.

Edwards’ two-way impact was as expected even when he struggled to make shots. He stepped up his leadership game as well by engaging his teammates even when he sat on the bench.
