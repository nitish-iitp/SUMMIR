Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best choices on Saturday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Nikola Jokić (DEN, C)	$26,300	68.3	2.6
Value	Cody Martin (CHA, PF/SF)	$8,360	28.4	3.4
Fade	Julian Champagnie (SAS, SF)	$10,190	19.6	1.9
Cheapie	Keon Ellis (SAC, SG)	$7,790	26.3	3.4

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they are expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options refer to the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your NBA Saturday teams, consider starting with a value player like Cody Martin. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Nikola Jokić is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Keon Ellis.

On the other hand, according to our model, Julian Champagnie is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building multiple line-ups.
