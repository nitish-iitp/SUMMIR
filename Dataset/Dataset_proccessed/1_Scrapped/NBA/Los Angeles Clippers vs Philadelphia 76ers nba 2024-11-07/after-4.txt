PHILADELPHIA 76ERS
Paul George Calls Out 'Stupid' Boos from Clippers Fans After 76ers Drop to 1-6

Philadelphia 76ers wing Paul George commented Wednesday on some fans booing him upon his return to Los Angeles to play against the Clippers.

Speaking to reporters following a 110-98 loss to his former team, George said:

"It is stupid. I mean, I was a free agent, you know what I mean? It wasn't something that I demanded a trade or went against the team here. I was a free agent. The team presented something that was team friendly, and I did what was best for me in that situation.

"So there were the cheers. I appreciate them. Those were the ones that I played hard for. The boos, I didn't get it. I still don't get it when I go [back] to Indy, but it is what it is. It's sports. I look forward to next year being back here and more boos."

George, 34, spent the past five seasons with the Clippers before signing a four-year, $211.58 million with the Sixers in free agency this past offseason.

During his tenure in L.A., George was a highly productive player, earning three All-Star nods and one All-NBA Third Team selection. He also helped lead the Clippers to their first Western Conference Finals appearance in franchise history in 2021.

The Clippers acquired both George and Kawhi Leonard in the same offseason with hopes of finally reaching the NBA Finals and winning a championship, but the superstar duo was never able to get over the hump.

Injuries were a big reason why, as both George and Leonard missed a significant amount of time during their five-year run together. In fact, George played in 56 or fewer games in each of his first four seasons in Los Angeles.

Last season was the healthiest he had been since 2018-19, playing in 74 games, but it wasn't enough to get the Clips out of the first round of the playoffs.

George missed the start of this season due to a knee injury suffered during the preseason, but he has returned to appear in two contests, averaging 16.5 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.5 three-pointers made per contest.

The 76ers have lost each of the two games he has appeared in, however, and they are now a disappointing 1-6, which is tied for the worst record in the NBA.

Philly has missed superstar center Joel Embiid, who has yet to play this season due to knee injury management, but more was still expected out of the team with George and Tyrese Maxey leading the way.

As for the Clippers, they have been something of a pleasant surprise with a 4-4 start despite losing George and Leonard not yet appearing in a game this season due to injury.

They may be a bigger playoff threat than most anticipated, whereas the Sixers have come nowhere close to living up to their status as a championship contender.

George will have a chance to get his first win as a member of the 76ers on Friday when he goes up against the Los Angeles Lakers.
