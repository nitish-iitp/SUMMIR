The Los Angeles Clippers came out victorious last night in a 110-98 win at home over the Philadelphia 76ers. The victory gave the Clippers’ their second straight at the Intuit Dome and their fourth win on the season.

Norman Powell led the way for the Clippers, keeping them afloat amidst James Harden’s first half struggles. Powell had 15 points in the first half and poured in 26 points on 80% shooting by the final buzzer, continuing to build off of his electric start to the 2024-2025 season. In eight games this year, he’s averaging 25 points per game—an 11-point increase from last season and a 12.5-point increase over his career average.

The game was tightly contested until the third quarter, when the Clippers exploded. They outscored Philly 33-17 over the period as a whole, and also outscored them 16-2 over the last four minutes of the quarter alone.

The Clippers couldn’t seem to miss, shooting a staggering 70% from the field during the third while the 76ers’ offense grew stagnant, shooting only 36.8%.

After an abysmal first half, Harden collected himself and acted as the primary driver for the Clippers’ third-quarter heroics, contributing 12 total points and a timely, contested step-back three with 2:44 left in the period that kickstarted their fiery run and ultimately put the game out of reach.

While the Clippers executed decently well on the night, Philadelphia’s continued struggle with its stars’ absences certainly helped LA.

Former MVP Joel Embiid, who was supposed to make his regular season debut, was handed a three-game suspension for lashing out and shoving a disrespectful reporter in the locker room after a game, and All-Star Tyrese Maxey injured his right hamstring in the second half and missed the entire fourth quarter. The 76ers, who were marketed as contenders leading up to season, have begun the year 1-6. Having been unable to field their new “big three” yet, the 76ers look a bit disoriented in this early season.

Perhaps the only silver lining in an otherwise disastrous game for Philadelphia was former Clipper Paul George’s performance, playing in only his second game back after hyperextending his knee in a preseason game versus the Atlanta Hawks.

After a shaky debut against the Phoenix Suns on Monday, George scored an efficient 18 points in just 24 minutes of play. He understandably wasn’t wildly aggressive in his second game back, settling for a lot of contested jump shots as opposed to attacking the basket. However, his jumper looked much better today than it did on Monday.

Despite George’s successful night in terms of actual on-court play, one of the biggest stories of the night was the less-than-warm welcome he got from some Clippers fans in his first game back in Los Angeles since leaving in free agency.

The Clippers organization and George didn’t necessarily part ways on bad terms, but some fans were still loud in expressing their discontent with their former star player. After the game, George said that he was confused by some of the fan responses.

“There were cheers, I appreciate them, I still appreciate them,” he said. “Those were the ones I played hard for, and then there were the boos. I didn’t get it. I still don’t get it even when I go to Indy.”

Norman Powell’s continued excellence is a great sign for the Clippers heading into the In-Season Tournament, which begins in about a week.

The Clippers play on the road against the Sacramento Kings tomorrow at 7 p.m.
