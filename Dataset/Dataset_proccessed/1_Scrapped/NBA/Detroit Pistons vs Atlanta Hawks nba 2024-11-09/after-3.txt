Hawks Game 8: Nov. 4, 2024
Boston Celtics at Atlanta Hawks

Final Score: BOS 123 – ATL 93

The Boston Celtics took over State Farm Arena in blowout fashion on Monday night. The short-handed Atlanta Hawks kept the contest close for the first quarter-and-a-half despite a slow start from Trae Young, but the defending champs went on a massive 31-9 run to end the second frame. Atlanta never recovered, as they shot just 6-31 from downtown land compared to Boston’s 18-55.

Jayson Tatum started hot with 16 first-quarter tallies and finished with 28 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Derrick White continued his strong start to the season with 21 points, and Payton Pritchard added 18 off the bench.

Jalen Johnson led the Hawks with 20 points and 11 boards, while Onyeka Okongwu had a strong performance in the paint for 18 points, 10 rebounds, and two steals in just 23 minutes. Young struggled for two points but left the game in the third quarter with a rib sprain.  Keaton Wallace’s role would increase if the star guard misses any significant time, but Atlanta’s offense would likely struggle to put consistent points on the board.

 

Game 9: Nov. 6, 2024
New York Knicks at Atlanta Hawks

Final Score: NYK 116 – ATL 121

The Hawks recorded their best win of the young season against the New York Knicks behind a breakout performance from Zaccharie Risacher. The 2024 first-overall pick scored a career-high 33 points with seven rebounds, three steals and two blocks.

After the game, I asked the rookie how Head Coach Quin Snyder instilled confidence in him despite some early shooting struggles.

“He basically tells me to shoot the f**cking ball… every time,” Risacher said with a smile.

Atlanta collected 12 steals in total and forced the Knicks into 15 turnovers, leading to easy buckets on the other end. Even though New York shot better from the field, three-point line, and charity stripe, the Hawks only committed eight turnovers to dominate the possession battle. Atlanta’s defense got three clutch stops after taking a 112-111 lead with one minute left and sealed the victory at the free-throw line.

Young had a rough first half but turned it on in the second to finish with 23 points, 10 dimes, and six rebounds, while Johnson put up 23 points, 15 boards, and seven assists. Clint Capela made all eight of his shots for 18 points.

Dyson Daniels struggled mightily from the field (3-16 for six points) but held Jalen Brunson to 21 points on 8-18 shooting. Karl-Anthony Towns did all he could for the Knicks with 34 points, 16 rebounds, and three blocks.

 

Game 10: Nov. 8, 2024
Atlanta Hawks at Detroit Pistons

Final Score: ATL 122 – DET 121

The Hawks put themselves behind the eight-ball early against the Detroit Pistons. Detroit scored a whopping 40 points in the opening frame, and Atlanta managed only 23. However, the Hawks put up 30 points and held the Pistons under that mark to take a one-point lead with 13 seconds left. Cade Cunningham responded with a tough finish over Daniels and Johnson, giving his quad the lead. On the final possession, Young dished the ball to Okongwu under the rim for a dunk, but Cunningham flew in for a weak-side block, sealing the Pistons’ victory.

Young shined for 35 points and 13 assists, and Larry Nance Jr. provided a spark off the bench in the second half with 13 points on 5-5 shooting. Daniels collected a career-high seven steals in an impressive defensive performance.

Cunningham put up a 22-point, 13-assist, and 11-rebound triple-double, while Tobias Harris (5-8 3PT) and Malik Beasley each scored 22.

 

Game 11: Nov. 9, 2024
Chicago Bulls at Atlanta Hawks

Final Score: CHI 125 – ATL 113

In contrast to the previous game, the Hawks built a quick 37-24 lead over the Chicago Bulls after the first quarter. However, as the game progressed, Atlanta’s offense and defense declined. Chicago scored at least 30 points in the final three quarters, but Atlanta’s disastrous fourth frame opened the door, and the Bulls stormed through. The Hawks shot 6-23 from the field, 0-7 from deep, and committed five turnovers in the final 12 minutes. Chicago scored 35 in the fourth to complete an 18-point comeback.

The Bulls had eight players in double-digit scoring led by Ayo Dosunmu with 19. Zach LaVine, Nikola Vučević, and Coby White each had 18 points. Johnson and Capela both scored 20 points. Young dished out 16 assists.

 

De’Andre Hunter Injury Update

De’Andre Hunter appeared in Atlanta’s first two games but has been sidelined with a knee injury ever since. Before the game against Chicago, the Hawks changed his injury designation to “personal family reasons.” According to Lauren Williams of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunter’s partner gave birth to their baby girl on Saturday morning. The Hawks expect Hunter to be back on the court at some point in week four.
