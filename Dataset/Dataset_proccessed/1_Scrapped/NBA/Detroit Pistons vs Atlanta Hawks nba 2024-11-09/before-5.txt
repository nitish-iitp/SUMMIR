The Chicago Bulls travel to the State Farm Arena to battle the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. Here’s a Chicago Bulls vs Atlanta Hawks Prediction. This article will include a Chicago Bulls vs Atlanta Hawks Prediction Pick.
Chicago Bulls 
The Chicago Bulls have struggled to get going this season as they've lost six of their first nine games and they will be hoping to arrest a four-game slide after getting thrashed by the Timberwolves in a 135-119 loss on Thursday. Nikola Vucevic led the team with 25 points on 11 of 15 shooting, Coby White added 24 points with eight assists while Ayo Dosunmu and Talen Horton-Tucker each scored 13 points. As a team, the Bulls shot 53 percent from the field and 15 of 36 from the 3-point line as they poured in 65 points in the first half to take a 13-point lead, only to get blown out by 45-24 in the fourth quarter to suffer yet another disappointing defeat at home. The Bulls will meet the Cavaliers after this game.
Atlanta Hawks 
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Hawks have been in a major slump as they've lost six of their last eight games overall and they will be hoping to bounce back here after falling just short to the Pistons in a 122-121 road loss last night. Trae Young led the team with 35 points with 13 assists, Jalen Johnson added 20 points, Dyson Daniels added 18 points with seven steals, while Larry Nance Jr chipped in with 13 points off the bench. As a team, the Hawks shot 45 percent from the field and 15 of 36 from the 3-point line as they worked hard to claw their way back from an early 24-point deficit to take the lead with just 12.1 seconds remaining, only to see the Pistons snatch the game away with the go-ahead shot from Cade Cunningham with just 8.1 seconds left on the clock. 
Why the Chicago Bulls will win
The Bulls have won 10 of their last 11 games as underdogs following a home loss.
The Hawks have lost each of their last five night games against teams that held a losing record.
The Bulls have covered the spread in each of their last six games as underdogs against Southeast Division opponents following a loss.
The Hawks have failed to cover the spread in each of their last six games as favorites against Eastern Conference opponents.
Total Points Facts
Each of the Hawks' last seven games as home favorites has gone OVER the total points line.
Nine of the Bulls' last 10 games against the Hawks following a home loss have gone UNDER the total points line.
Chicago Bulls vs Atlanta Hawks Prediction
The Bulls are still missing Lonzo Ball and they have Zach LaVine listed as questionable, while the Hawks have again ruled out Bogdan Bogdanovic, Cody Zeller, and Seth Lundy to name a few. You really couldn't back either team with any confidence these days, but the Hawks are playing their second game of a back-to-back set after losing a heartbreaker to the Pistons last night, so I am looking at the Bulls who really put a scare into the in-form Timberwolves in their loss on Thursday. It's hard to split these two squads at the moment, but I think there is some decent value with the Bulls as the underdogs in this spot.
