Heat’s Bam Adebayo calls season-opening loss to Magic ’embarrassing’

They may have started with a flesh slate Wednesday night, but the Miami Heat’s 116-97 loss to the Orlando Magic reflected many of the same issues we have seen over the last two seasons–both offensively and defensively.

It’s just one game over a long 82-game season, sure. It was an uninspiring effort from the Heat, especially from their two best players, Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler, who scored a combined 12 points on 2-of-13 shooting in 26 minutes apiece.

Ironically enough, it came on the night when Heat president Pat Riley was commemorated with a court in his honor, as he enters his 30th year with the organization. He embedded a culture of grit and toughness that’s been the bedrock of this organization for three decades. That was nonexistent Wednesday.

After the game Wednesday, Miami’s team captain gave an honest assessment of the team’s performance, not mincing words.

“We played bad. It’s not really anything to that,” Adebayo said. “I mean, that’s, that’s as simple as I can make it. It’s embarrassing, especially on a night like this for the Godfather Riley. For us, it’s short term memory. I know it’s the beginning of the season, but we don’t want to create this as like a ‘getting used to’ thing. For us, it’s win or misery.”

You can check out Dan’s full recap here, but the Heat shot 39.0 percent while being out-rebounded 16 throughout the duration of the game. Through the first three quarters, Miami was outscored by 12 (36-24) in the paint, 11 (20-9) in second-chance points and 18 (15-9) from beyond arc.

That’s not a winning formula for success in today’s NBA.

There were glimpses of good process for the team’s “new-look” offense with a modified shot diet. After all, they attempted all but five of their 82 of their shot attempts from the paint or 3-point range. Orlando, however, did an excellent job at shutting off the Heat’s water on dribble penetration and was incredibly disciplined with its rotations and screen navigation–making it very difficult for them to generate clean offense.

This was a good test for the Heat–and one they needed. Once early November arrives, the schedule gods aren’t doing them any favors, so perhaps this “embarrassing” performance is exactly what they need to begin the season.

Spo: well that didn’t work
Might be the needed “challenge” to put the rookie out there. I love Spo but one of the quirks I hate is his style of not fielding ur draft pick that really looks good. This loss is on him. Next game pls.

I’ve read two different articles today on why the Heat should trade Butler now…to Houston. The Rockets have a couple of bad contracts and far too many young rotation caliber players. I’ve tried to figure out how the trade could work and haven’t found a solution. Heat can’t take back 3 or 4 players for 1. Plus, one of the contracts would be Dillon Brooks for three more seasons. That will not work!

I also looked at a possible trade with Golden State. In my scenario, Miami would receive:

Andrew Wiggins (2 years plus player option 3rd year @$84.7M)
Jonathan Kuminga @$7,636,307 RFA,
De’Anthony Melton and
Gary Payton III, one year at $12,822,000 in exchange for
Butler, Richardson, Jovic and Larsson.

NOTE: Warriors were unwilling to pay Kuminga max extension contract he desired: 5 years $225M ($45M per season). Warriors offered him 5 years @$155M. He has career averages of 11.9ppg, 3.0rpg, 1.7apg, 0.4bpg and 34% 3pt average.

Both the Houston and Golden State scenarios do not work unless Miami involves a third team. For the time being, it looks like we are going to need to make due with what we have. Hopefully, Spo and the team get their shit together real soon.

We should find out over the next few weeks whether the catastrophe on Wednesday was a wake up call or a death nell. Looking ahead from October 30 – November 26, Miami has a 12 game stretch of:
New York, @Washington, Sacramento, @Phoenix, @Denver, @Minnesota, @Detroit, @Indiana, @Indiana, Philadelphia, Dallas, Milwaukee.

GO HEAT!!!

Can you explain the thinking behind Golden State including Melton who they recently signed this past off-season? And why Miami would prefer Melton to Larsson or Jovic?

Need to make numbers match. I don’t think it is a good trade unless Miami gets real desperate to unload Butler.

They should be embarrassed after that performance and Riley should be too. A bunch of nba fans are trolling them as well. Hopefully this the wake up call they need. Jimmy can’t carry the team anymore, so bam gotta step up, and take at least 18 shots a game moving forward.

Maybe Matt is right. Better to fix what’s wrong now than later. Let’s hope this was a wake up call. And Bam should rightly be embarrassed. But, what if this squad is just undermanned? I hope not, but time will tell.

I don’t think we need Bam to inform us that the effort was embarrassing.

The word that came to mind was disgusting. Butler finished with a +/- 30 box score! WTF?

Note: The Heat was ranked #18 in the power rankings before that dismal display. They should be 20 or lower now.
