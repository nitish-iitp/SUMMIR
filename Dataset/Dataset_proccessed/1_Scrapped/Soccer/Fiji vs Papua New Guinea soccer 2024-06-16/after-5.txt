Tailevu Naitasiri’s Mosese Nabose has impressive debut for the Bula Boys

In a memorable debut match, Mosese Nabose, the 25-year-old full-back from Tailevu Naitasiri, showcased his talents in front of the fans at ANZ Stadium in Suva. Nabose played a crucial role in his team’s commanding 5-1 victory against Papua New Guinea in the OFC Nations Cup debut held in Suva.

Nabose’s inclusion in the starting lineup was a testament to his impressive performance and work ethic, as noted by Fiji’s coach, Robert Sherman. The coach had been closely monitoring Nabose’s progress and decided to give the young defender a chance to prove himself on the international stage.

During the match, Nabose was a standout performer, contributing both defensively and offensively. His energetic presence at the back helped stabilize the defense, preventing Papua New Guinea from mounting any significant comeback. Moreover, Nabose demonstrated his attacking prowess by assisting the fifth goal, delivering a smart through ball to captain Roy Krishna, who made no mistake in finding the back of the net.

Looking ahead, Fiji is set to face Samoa in their next match on Wednesday, June 19th. With Nabose’s remarkable debut, expectations are high for another strong performance from the full-back, as Fiji aims to continue their winning streak in the OFC Nations Cup.
