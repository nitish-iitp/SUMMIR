Uruguay Predicted Lineup vs Panama Preview

Uruguay is set to participate in their 46th Copa America as they arrive in the USA. The South American team will be aiming for their 16th trophy, facing tough competition from powerhouses Brazil and Argentina.

With the 2024 Copa America just around the corner, Uruguay is ready to showcase its footballing prowess once again. Drawing from their rich history and renowned ability to nurture top-tier players, they have a strong lineup of seasoned veterans and promising young talents who are poised to make their mark on the pitch and reclaim their position at the top.

Uruguay’s talent pool boasts a wide range of players, from experienced veterans in Europe’s top leagues to up-and-coming young stars making waves at home. Some managers at Copa America 2024 are widely recognised and need no introduction.

Marcelo Bielsa is widely recognised for his unpredictable nature and unwavering tactical philosophy. The 68-year-old, who brought about significant changes to Chile’s national team and gained immense popularity among Leeds United supporters, now has the responsibility of leading one of South America’s most talented squads.

When Bielsa took on the Uruguay job just over a year ago, he knew that the small country bordering his homeland of Argentina had the potential for great success. Uruguay hopes to reach the knockout rounds after being drawn with the USA, Panama, and Bolivia. They recently defeated Argentina and Brazil, proving their big-stage credentials.

Going into this fixture, Uruguay has a win probability of 65%, whereas Panama has a win probability of 20%.
