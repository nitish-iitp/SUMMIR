Today’s Starting XI has an average age of 25 years, 339 days. It is the second-oldest lineup deployed by Gregg Berhalter in a tournament group-stage match behind the XI that faced Haiti in the opening match of the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup (25 years, 360 days).

The Starting XI averages 37.3 caps overall and 22 in official competition.

Berhalter makes two lineup changes from the 1-1 draw against Brazil on June 12, inserting midfielder Tyler Adams and forward Folarin Balogun. Adams last started for the USMNT at AT&T Stadium when he provided the game-winning goal in the 2-0 win against Mexico in the Concacaf Nations League Final on March 24, while Balogun returns to the lineup after playing a substitute role against Brazil.

A veteran of the 2016 Copa América Centenario, Christian Pulisic earns his fourth overall appearance in the competition, while the other 10 starters all make their debut.

Pulisic captains the team for the 24th time tonight, tying Kasey Keller for seventh on the USMNT’s all-time captains list. The USA is 16W-3L-4D when Pulisic wears the armband.

Pulisic (May 28, 2016), Josh Sargent and Tim Weah (May 28, 2018) scored their first international goals against Bolivia, while defender Antonee Robinson debuted and registered his first assist against La Verde on May 28, 2018 in Chester, Pa.

On the last day of his 20s, goalkeeper Matt Turner earns his 32nd cap in official competition, tying him with Brad Friedel for fourth all-time among USMNT goalkeepers.Turner is the fifth different goalkeeper to appear for the U.S. in Copa América, following Friedel (6 caps), Brad Guzan (6), Kasey Keller (5) and Tim Howard (1).

At 36 years, 261 days, center back Tim Ream is the oldest field player to appear for the USA in Copa América. The previous oldest was Fernando Clavijo who was 36 years, 150 days when he appeared in the 3-3 draw with Venezuela on June 22, 1993 in Quito, Ecuador.

Making his 13th appearance, striker Folarin Balogun will appear in his first tournament group-stage match for the United States.

The backline of Antonee Robinson, Tim Ream, Chris Richards and Joe Scally start together for the third-straight match.

FC Dallas products Weston McKennie and Chris Richards start for the USA not far from where they played for the club’s academy. Substitutes Shaq Moore and Ricardo Pepi also came up in the FC Dallas Academy, with Pepi rising to play for the club’s first team.

Substitute Josh Sargent is available for selection for the first time during the summer window. Should he come off the bench, it would mark his first USMNT appearance since the 1-0 win against IR Iran at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The USMNT is unbeaten in its last 18 matches in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, holding a 13W-1L-5D all-time record in the DFW. The USA is also a perfect 5-0-0 at AT&T Stadium.

The USMNT is 2W-2L-4D all-time against Bolivia in a series that dates back to May 23, 1993.

Gregg Berhalter is 43W-15L-13D in 71 matches as USMNT head coach and 28W-7L-7D in 42 matches in official competition.

Five substitutions are allowed in three different moments. Halftime does not count as a substitution moment.

Tonight’s match will be officiated by Maurizio Mariani of Italy, who is the only center referee at the 2024 Copa América from outside of the Concacaf and CONMEBOL regions. This is the first USMNT match officiated by Mr. Mariani.
