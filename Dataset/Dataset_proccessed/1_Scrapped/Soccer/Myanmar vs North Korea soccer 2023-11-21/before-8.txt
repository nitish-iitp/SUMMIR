Hi!
A lot of schools have bio-med engineering. Like previous mentioned in replies there are a lot of good websites to help you choose the best one. It also depends on if you want to play for the school or just in a rec league (which can be just as fun). As for some suggestions, University of Iowa has a good bio-med program with a decent soccer team. University of Minnesota also has an incredible bio-med program with a soccer team.
Iowa State (my alma mater) has been building up their bio-med program as well as having a pretty good soccer team.
No matter where you go, there will be chances to play soccer. It may not be for an "official" team just a club or rec. Don't be afraid to ask around.
wish you the best!

My own children were once student athletes, so I'm familiar with the process of finding the right school. There are numerous resources available to help you narrow down your options. One such resource is the NAIA website, found at this link: https://www.naia.org/schools/index. Here, you can select your preferred field of study and discover schools offering that specific degree program.

For information about being an NCAA athlete, visit this link: https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2021/2/8/student-athletes-future.aspx. It's important to remember that being a student athlete is about more than just competition; your education is crucial for your future once your sporting days are over.

My best advice is to find a school that aligns with your career aspirations. Understand what degrees you can pursue as an athlete, as your ability to balance schoolwork and sports may be affected by the intensity of your training schedule, meetings, and travel commitments. NAIA is generally more accommodating for student athletes, while NCAA can be more challenging, particularly for specialized degrees. However, NCAA Division II or III is typically more manageable.

The bottom line is that you should prioritize academics when choosing a school, and then consider if it's a good fit for your athletic pursuits. Once you've identified potential schools, start contacting coaches and recruitment coordinators to express your interest. Most schools have a recruitment form on their athletic website that you can fill out to provide them with information about yourself. Remember, coaches appreciate well-rounded individuals, so maintain good grades alongside your athletic prowess.

I hope this advice is helpful. Best of luck in your search!

My -- I feel compelled to recommend my alma mater, St. Mary's College of California. It is a small liberal arts school with robust science classes and facilities and a lively sports program, including women's soccer.

I believe you would get a complete and balanced education at St. Mary's in science, literature, and the arts.

Here is a brief outline of the St. Mary's women's soccer team:

The women's soccer team at Saint Mary's College of California competes in Division 2 of the West Coast Soccer Association. The team's head coach is Theresa Romagnolo. The assistant coaches are Mariah Cameron and Emily Kruger.
The team's 2023 season was strong, with 10 wins and a fourth-place tie in the WCC. Romagnolo surpassed her 100th career win this season, bringing her total to 105.
The team's 2022 roster included:
Taylor Poland: Goalkeeper, 5'10"
Kate Borgmeier: Goalkeeper, 6'0"
Emma Barthel: Midfielder, 5'5"
Amari Hicks: Defense, 5'9"
Kylie Granno: Defender, 5'4"
Kyllie Glock: Forward, 5'4"
Tessa Salvestrin: Forward, 5'11"
Emily Jensen: Midfielder, 5'5"
The team's Instagram account is @smc_wsoccer.

Choosing a college can be a big decision, and there are many factors to consider in addition to your bio medical engineering degree. Here are some friendly suggestions to help guide your choice:

1. Make sure the college you're interested in offers the major you want to study. This way, you can pursue the degree you desire. Auburn University (Alabama) has a wonderful engineering program including bio medical engineering.
2. If you're worried about the cost of college, consider in-state colleges as they often have lower tuition fees. But check that the in-state college has your degree and check out any reviews on the program.
3. If you're interested in scholarships, look to see colleges with a bio medical engineering degree offer different scholarships especially any sports scholarships like soccer. Don't forget to apply to all available scholarships.
4. If you're thinking about living on campus, look to see colleges with a bio medical engineering degree offer affordable housing and meal plans.
5. If making new friends is important to you, consider the recreational activities offered by the college. They can be a great way to meet new people and expand your social circle.

Are you dreaming of a career in bio medical engineering and also have a love for soccer? Well, there are several colleges and universities that provide excellent programs in both these areas. When you're on the hunt for the best colleges offering bio medical engineering and soccer, it's crucial to find institutions that boast of highly-rated engineering programs and robust athletic programs.

Duke University: Nestled in Durham, North Carolina, Duke University is celebrated for its robust bio medical engineering program and its highly competitive soccer team. The Pratt School of Engineering at Duke presents a well-rounded bio medical engineering program that blends engineering principles with medical and biological sciences. Besides, Duke’s men’s and women’s soccer teams have a successful track record in the NCAA Division I soccer competitions.

Stanford University: Situated in California, Stanford University is another excellent choice for budding bio medical engineers who also wish to play soccer at the college level. Stanford’s Department of Bioengineering offers a challenging curriculum that merges engineering with biology and medicine. The university’s soccer teams have a formidable presence in the Pac-12 conference and have enjoyed significant success in NCAA soccer.

University of California, Berkeley: Globally recognized for its bio engineering program, the University of California, Berkeley also provides opportunities for students to engage in high-level soccer through its Division I athletics program. UC Berkeley’s College of Engineering offers a variety of bio engineering specializations, and the university’s soccer teams have a storied history of success in collegiate soccer competitions.

These universities not only offer robust bio medical engineering programs but also provide opportunities for student-athletes to chase their love for soccer at a competitive level.

What to do when conflicted over possible majors?
I am an incoming senior in HS. I plan on going down the art path, but do not know whether to do Graphic Design in Marketing, or to go down the Museum Studies path. I am an art student at my school, and plan on joining a student board for an art museum as an internship, but I have always been good at design. I feel as if I need to know my future major to decide on possible colleges, but not knowing what I want to study is holding me back there. Are there other ways for me to make sure I choose the right major to then go on to choose the right college?
