History
North Korean footballer Han Kwang Song has returned to the international game, playing two World Cup qualifiers since November 2022. Han, who is nicknamed 'Korean Messi', had disappeared from football after playing for Qatari club Al-Duhail in August 2020. In 2017 he had become the first North Korean to score in one of Europe's major leagues, and played for Juventus and Cagliari before moving to Qatar. His career had been hampered by UN Security Council sanctions, which prevented North Koreans from working overseas, including in sport. Han's return has been greeted with joy by football fans and experts, who have noted his promising career had been disrupted.
