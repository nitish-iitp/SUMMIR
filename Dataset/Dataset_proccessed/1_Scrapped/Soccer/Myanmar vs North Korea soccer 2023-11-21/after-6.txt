Myanmar face big loss to North Korea in World Cup Qualifier

Myanmar national football team suffered a 1-6 loss to North Korea in the second-round World Cup qualifier played at Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon yesterday.
Due to the big difference in the world level, the Myanmar team could not play at the same level as the North Korea team.
The first goal for North Korea was found at 30 minutes which was superbly scored by I Jong amidst the ruined Myanmar back line. The North Korean attack was never stopped and the second goal was scored by J Choe at 34 minutes as he got a chance to shoot a penalty-kick. Four minutes later, North Korean Kwang-Song Han touched the ball into the net to make the third score.
The first half ended with North Korea winning three goals.
In the second half, Myanmar’s play increased, but they could not control North Korea’s play and conceded more goals.
North Korea star player I Jong made a hat-trick as he scored the fourth and fifth goals at 54 and 56 minutes. Next, North Korea produced the sixth and final goal at 70 minute-mark as the goal was scored by Hyong-Jin Ri at 70 minutes.
In turn, Myanmar found a single goal with Win Naing Tun’s action at 77 minutes.
At the final whistle, North Korea celebrated a 6-1 victory over Myanmar. Since team Myanmar lost both matches, it is not a good situation to advance to the next round of the World Cup qualifiers. — KZL
