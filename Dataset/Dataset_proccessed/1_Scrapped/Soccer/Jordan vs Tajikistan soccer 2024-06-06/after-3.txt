Pakistan and Saudi Arabia square off in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Thursday

The action continues in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia go head-to-head at the Jinnah Stadium on Thursday. Stephen Constantine’s men have lost their four matches in Group G and will head into the game looking to stop the rot.

Pakistan were outplayed and outclassed last time out as they suffered a 7-0 hammering against Jordan at the Amman International Stadium.

With that result, Constantine’s side have now lost their four games in the World Cup qualifiers and currently are rooted to the boom of Group G.

Next up for Pakistan is the stern challenge of an opposing side who have won their previous two encounters, scoring 10 goals and keeping two clean sheets in that time.

Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia’s 100% record in the qualifiers came to an end last time out as they were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw by Tajikistan.

Prior to that, Roberto Mancini’s men picked up three wins in their opening three matches, scoring seven goals and keeping three clean sheets to start the campaign.

With 10 points from four matches, Saudi Arabia currently lead the way at the top of Group G, three points above second-placed Jordan.

Pakistan vs Saudi Arabia Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
This will be the third-ever encounter between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, with Mancini’s men winning their two previous meetings.
Saudi Arabia are unbeaten in their four World Cup qualifying matches, claiming three wins and one draw. They have scored eight goals and kept three clean sheets so far.
Pakistan currently hold the poorest defensive record in the qualifiers, having conceded a staggering 20 goals in just four matches.

Pakistan vs Saudi Arabia Prediction
