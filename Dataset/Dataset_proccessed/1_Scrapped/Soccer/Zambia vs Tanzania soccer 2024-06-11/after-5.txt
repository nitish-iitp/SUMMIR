SC Villa will play at CECAFA Kagame Cup

The CECAFA Executive Director John Auka Gecheo has communicated new dates for the forthcoming 2024 Kagame Cup.

The club competition will now take place in July 6-22nd in Tanzania and Zanzibar.

Gecheo also revealed three guest teams led by five-time African champions TP Mazembe from DR Congo.

The other guest teams are Nyasa Big Bullets (Malawi) and Zambia’s Red Arrows FC who join 13 other teams from the CECAFA Zone.

“The competition was earlier planned to take place July 20th to August 4th in Tanzania. But because of the busy CAF calendar, the competition has been rescheduled so that it kicks-off earlier and ends few days before the start of the 2024/2025 CAF Club competitions,” read a statement on the Cecafa website.

“This competition will help our teams in the Zone prepare better in the pre-season ahead of the 2024/2025 CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup which start in August.

“Having top sides from DR Congo, Malawi and Zambia will also spice-up our Club competition and give our teams a real test,” says the CECAFA Executive Director John Auka Gecheo.

Shockingly, defending champions Express from Uganda who won the title in 2021 are not part of the teams with Uganda to be represented by league champions SC Villa.

Teams for the CECAFA Kagame Cup:

Vital ‘O (Burundi), APR FC (Rwanda), El Merreikh, Al Hilal, Hai El Wadi (Sudan), Young Africans SC, Simba SC, Azam FC, Coastal Union FC (Tanzania), Gor Mahia FC (Kenya), SC Villa (Uganda), JKU SC (Zanzibar), El Merreikh FC-Bentiu (South Sudan), Nyasa Big Bullets FC (Malawi), TP Mazembe (DR Congo) and Red Arrows FC (Zambia).
