Chipolopolo skipper backs young guns for crucial Tanzania clash

Zambia’s Chipolopolo skipper Lubambo Musonda is confident his young players are up to the challenge as they face Tanzania this evening in a crucial World Cup qualifier.

“The team has prepared well,” Musonda said during a press briefing yesterday.

“We are all focused to get the best result. We will definitely do our best and get three points.”

Musonda acknowledged the inexperience of some of the new players but believes they’ve adapted well.

The team is looking to bounce back from their recent defeat to Morocco.

Zambia suffered a 2-1 defeat to the Atlas Lions last Friday.

“It’s unfortunate that we didn’t get a point in the last game, but everyone is still focused,” Musonda added.

Echoing Musonda’s sentiments, coach Avram Grant stressed the importance of the match and praised Tanzania’s strength.

“We know it is a very important game for us because we want to stay in the picture against a very good opponent,” Grant said.

“They played well with a lot of intensity but we need to think about us and how we want to win this game.”

Grant also called on the home fans for their support.

“Now we are playing at our home where our supporters are amazing, and we always took our results in the last games we have played here and we still want it to be like this,” Grant remarked.

The match kicks off at 18:00 hours CAT at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Ndola.
