We said: Slovakia 1-1 Austria
With both sides coming into this clash in a good vein of form, we are expecting a hard-fought encounter between the teams on Saturday afternoon. Austria are without their talismanic figure in Alaba whilst Slovakia are weaker defensively without Skriniar, so we are predicting a draw in this friendly. Read more.
