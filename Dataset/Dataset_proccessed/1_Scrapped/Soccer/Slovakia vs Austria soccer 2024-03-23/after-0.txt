Friendlies

Christoph Baumgartner took just six seconds to open the scoring for Austria against Slovakia in an international friendly on Saturday.

Austria up against Slovakia in friendly
Baumgartner scores straight from kick-off
Goal timed at just six seconds
WHAT HAPPENED?

Baumgartner made the perfect start to Austria's friendly against Slovakia. The 24-year-old went straight at Slovakia from the kick-off, going past two players before unleashing a low shot from range that flew past goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and into the back of the net. With just six seconds on the clock, Baumgartner's strike is the fastest recorded goal in international football history, beating Lukas Podolski's effort for Germany against Ecuador in 2013, timed at seven seconds.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Baumgartner's goal made international football history but may not be the fastest ever. South London side Croydon FC have laid claim to the honour after showing Ryan Hall scoring after just 2.31 seconds in the London Senior Trophy in February 2024. Guinness World Records failed to confirm if it was indeed the fastest ever goal recorded but did seem impressed, responding to the query with the message "what a hit son, what a hit."
