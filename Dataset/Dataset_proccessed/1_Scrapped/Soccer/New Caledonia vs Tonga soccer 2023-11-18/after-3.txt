A well experienced Team Fiji Men’s Basketball side defeated Tahiti 70-45 in their first pool match this morning.

With only one new player included in the mix, the side started strongly in the first quarter scoring 23 points to 11. The team carried this moment to the end of the game.

Tyron Mclennan says the main idea coming into the game was to start with alot of energy as they could and this set the tone for the game.

He adds that as a team there is always bits and pieces they try and improve on and will be working on in the lead up to their next Game on Monday.

Team Fiji Men’s Basketball last won the gold medal at the Pacific Games in 2007.

Manager Leone Qumi says Fiji is in a very tough pool, adding that they are looking to better their performance at this year’s Pacific Games in Honiara, after settling for bronze in Samoa four years ago.

With temperatures going up as high as 31 degrees, Qumi says they are happy they were able to arrive early to get the acclimatised to the weather and training conditions.

Meanwhile, Team Fiji Men’s Basketball will now take on  Tonga at 6pm (7pm FJT) next Monday, while their final pool match will be against New Caledonia at 3.45pm (4.45pm FJT) next Tuesday.
