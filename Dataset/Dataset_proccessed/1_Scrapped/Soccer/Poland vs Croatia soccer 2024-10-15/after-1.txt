Croatia celebrates after Petar Sučić scores 

Croatia and Poland have played out a thrilling 3-3 draw tonight in their UEFA Nations League clash at the PGE Narodowy stadium in Warsaw.

– A left-foot rocket from the edge of the box from Borna Sosa, and debut international goals for Petar Sučić and Martin Baturina helped Croatia get in front after going a goal down, but Poland would spoil the party in the second half.

– Croatia would have to play the final 13 minutes with 10 men after keeper Dominik Livaković was controversially sent off for reckless play.

– Poland started star striker Robert Lewandowski on the bench, whilst Mateo Kovačić was still absent for the Croatians.

– The opening 15 minutes was all Poland as Zlatko Dalić’s side failed to settle into the match.

0-1 (5’)

Captain Piotr Zieliński found himself on the left inside the box and his curling strike would beat Dominik Livaković’s dive to his left.

It didn’t take long for Croatia to level.

1-1 (19’)

From a free kick the ball would spill out to Borna Sosa who was waiting on the edge of the box and he would volley home a spectacular strike.

Croatia goes in front.

1-2 (24’)

Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Petar Sučić found himself free inside the box after a wonderful ball from his club teammate Martin Baturina and Šučić would calmly guide the into the far corner for his debut goal for his country.

Two in two minutes.

1-3 (26’)

Sučić and Baturina would combine again and this time it would be Baturina who would slot the ball through the Poland keeper’s legs for his first senior international goal.

2-3 (45′)

Zalewski pulls one back for Poland when he gets the ball in the left side of the Croatia box and again finds the bottom left corner.
