Nahki Wells will miss the Concacaf Nations League match with Dominica tonight.

The striker, who scored a hat-trick in the match against Dominica on Saturday as Bermuda romped to a 6-1 win, has returned to England as part of an agreement between the Bermuda Football Association and Wells’s club Bristol City.

Wells is heading home to prepare for the Sky Bet Championship match against Middlesbrough on Saturday, with Bristol City coach Liam Manning absent from that game after taking time away from the club due to the death of his baby son.

Bermuda’s Kane Crichlow and Keziah Martin have joined up with the squad after playing in the FA Cup qualifying rounds in England on Saturday and will be available for the match against Dominica, which starts at 7.30pm tonight.
