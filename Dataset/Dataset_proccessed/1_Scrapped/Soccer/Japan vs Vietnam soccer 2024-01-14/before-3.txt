Which 2022 World Cup venues will be used for 2023 AFC Asian Cup?

The 2023 AFC Asian Cup is a mere few days away with international football returning to Qatar just 13 months after the World Cup. The venues are ready-made, then, having only just hosted football's greatest spectacle. K League United provides a quick guide to which of the World Cup stadiums will be used by Asia's elite over the next month or so.


Which stadiums were used in the 2022 World Cup?


Qatar, having hosted the World Cup in 2022, was seen as the ideal host for the AFC Asian Cup once China pulled out. Of the nine stadiums being used for the Asian Cup, seven were used at the World Cup. Stadium 974, the one made of shipping containers, no longer exists. 


Are any of the stadiums new?


None of the stadiums are newly made for the Asian Cup, but Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Al Rayyan and Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium in Doha are two smaller stadiums that have been added to the list. The former holds 15,000 and the latter 10,000. Jassim bin Hamad Stadium is the home of Al-Sadd and has been since 1975 when it was first built. It was renovated in 2004 and 2010. Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium is the home of Al-Duhail SC and was opened in 2013. 


Where will South Korea play?


South Korea kick off their Group E match against Bahrain in the 15,000-seater Jassim bin Hamad Stadium. The match against Jordan on January 20th will be played at Al Thumama Stadium in Doha, a 44,000-seater that hosted eight matches at the World Cup including Spain's 7-0 win over Costa Rica and Morocco's 1-0 win over Portugal. The third and final group stage match on January 25th against Malaysia will be at Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah. The 44,000-seater hosted seven matches at the World Cup, mostly in the group stage but was also the venue where Japan lost on penalties to Croatia in the Round of 16.  


What about the stadiums South Korea played at during the World Cup?


South Korea played all three of their group stage games at Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan and then to the now non-existent Stadium 974 for the Round of 16 clash with Brazil. Korea could return to Education City Stadium in the quarterfinals should they win their group and then beat the runners-up of Group D in the first knockout stage.


And what about the 2020 AFC Champions League?


Four of these venues served as the stadiums used in the centralised hub in 2020 - the first AFC Champions League campaign played during the pandemic. Al Janoub, Education City, Jassim bin Jamad, and Khalifa International all hosted K League teams in the ACL.


Al Janoub was where Jeonbuk beat Sydney FC 1-0 and lost 4-1 to Yokohama F. Marinos in Group H. Education City is where FC Seoul lost 2-1 to both Beijing FC and Melbourne Victory and where Ulsan beat Perth Glory twice and well as FC Tokyo once.


Jassim bin Hamad is where FC Seoul beat Chiangrai United 5-0 but then lost 2-1 to the Thai outfit a few days later. It's also where Ulsan beat Shanghai Shenhua 4-1, while Khalifa International is where Suwon Bluewings drew 0-0 and 1-1 with Guangzhou Evergrande, beat Vissel Kobe 2-0, and where Jeonbuk did the double over Shanghai SIPG.
