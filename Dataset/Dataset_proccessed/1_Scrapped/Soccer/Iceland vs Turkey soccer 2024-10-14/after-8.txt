Iceland vs Turkey: Nations League B Clash at Laugardalsvöllur

The UEFA Nations League B continues with an intriguing matchup between Iceland and Turkey on Monday, October 14, 2024, at 21:45 GMT+3. The match will take place at the Laugardalsvöllur stadium in Reykjavík, with Polish referee Damian Sylwestrzak officiating. This fixture marks the fourth matchday of the competition, and both teams will be eager to secure crucial points as they aim to improve their standing in the group.

Turkey currently leads the group with 7 points, while Iceland sits in third place with 4 points. The visitors have the upper hand in recent form and head-to-head encounters, having won their last direct meeting in the Nations League B with a convincing 3-1 scoreline. However, Iceland’s home advantage and their determination to climb up the table could make this an exciting and closely contested match.

With contrasting styles of play and different objectives, this encounter promises to be a fascinating tactical battle between two ambitious sides. The outcome of this match could have significant implications for both teams’ chances of promotion or relegation in the Nations League B.

Our betting tip for Iceland vs Turkey

Our betting prediction for this Nations League B clash leans towards an away win for Turkey. The visitors’ superior form and table position make them the favorites, with odds of 1.92 at Betwinner for a Turkey victory. This translates to an implied probability of about 52%, which seems reasonable given their recent performances and head-to-head record against Iceland.

For those looking for a potentially safer tip we can recommend a double chance X2 with an odd of 1.22 at Betway. This means we are opting for a draw or an away win for Turkey.

Alternatively, for those preferring the Over/Under market, we suggest considering a bet on Over 2.5 goals. The average goals per game in recent head-to-head encounters and both teams’ current form indicate a strong possibility of at least three goals being scored in this match.



Want to see more betting tips for this competition? Here is a list of more Nations League betting predictions.


Iceland Form Check: Striving for Consistency

Iceland enters this fixture with a mixed bag of results in their recent outings. In their last five matches across all competitions, they have managed 2 wins, 1 draw, and 2 defeats. This inconsistent form has left them in third place in their Nations League B group with 4 points, having won once, drawn once, and lost once.

Their most recent result was a 2-2 home draw against Wales, which showcased both their attacking prowess and defensive vulnerabilities. Iceland has shown the ability to score goals, netting 5 times in their three Nations League B matches so far. However, they have also conceded 5 goals, highlighting the need for defensive improvements.

The Icelandic side will be keen to build on their positive moments and address their weaknesses as they face a strong Turkish team. Their home advantage at Laugardalsvöllur could play a crucial role in their performance, as they aim to upset the group leaders and climb up the table.


Turkey’s Recent Form: Group Leaders on the Rise

Turkey has been in impressive form recently, solidifying their position at the top of the Nations League B group. With 7 points from three matches, including 2 wins and 1 draw, they have established themselves as the team to beat in this group. Their goal difference of +3, having scored 4 and conceded only 1, further underlines their strong performances.

In their last five matches across all competitions, Turkey has secured 3 wins, 1 draw, and suffered just 1 defeat. Their most recent outing resulted in a 1-0 home victory against Montenegro, demonstrating their ability to grind out results even in tight contests.

Under the guidance of manager Vincenzo Montella, Turkey has adopted a disciplined and tactically astute approach. Montella’s experience in Italian football has brought a blend of defensive solidity and attacking flair to the Turkish side. This tactical flexibility has been crucial in their success so far in the Nations League B campaign.

As they travel to Iceland, Turkey will be confident in their ability to maintain their unbeaten record in the competition and potentially extend their lead at the top of the group.
