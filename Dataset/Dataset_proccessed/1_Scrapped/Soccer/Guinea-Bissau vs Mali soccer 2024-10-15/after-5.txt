 FSL News

Algeria confidently secured their place in next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals in Morocco by defeating Togo at the Kégué Stadium in Lomé during Monday’s Group E qualifier. They have previously won the AFCON tournament twice.

This victory brings the total number of qualified teams to four. Algeria’s Ramy Bensebaini scored the only goal for the North Africans, maintaining their 100% record in the qualifiers.

They have secured 12 points from four matches. Bensebaini converted a penalty in the 18th minute to give Algeria the lead. Despite facing heavy pressure from the hosts, Algeria managed to hold on to their lead. Hosts Morocco, Cameroon and Burkina Faso have also qualified for the finals.

In another match, Zimbabwe defeated Namibia 3-1 in Johannesburg, bringing them in a strong position in their pool. With two matches remaining, they are eight points ahead of the third-placed Kenya.

Gambia moved into the second place in their pool, ahead of Comoros, based on head-to-head records, despite playing one more game.

Mozambique secured a 3-0 win over Eswatini in Nelspruit, taking them to the top of their pool. They are five points clear of third-placed Guinea Bissau, who will host Mali on Tuesday.
