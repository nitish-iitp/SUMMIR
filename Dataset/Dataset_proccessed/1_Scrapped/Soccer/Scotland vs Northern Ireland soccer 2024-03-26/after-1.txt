Andy Robertson

Andy Robertson was visibly upset as he was forced off for Scotland against Northern Ireland this evening.

The skipper now faces an anxious wait to discover the extent of the issue for both club and country with a title race on for Liverpool in the Premier League and Euro 2024 just around the corner.

Robertson was replaced by Lewis Ferguson as Steve Clarke opted to switch to a back four. The incident came earlier in the action when the Liverpool full-back was clattered by Sunderland defender Tai Hume. Robertson attempted to shake off the problem and carry on, but he would break down again.
