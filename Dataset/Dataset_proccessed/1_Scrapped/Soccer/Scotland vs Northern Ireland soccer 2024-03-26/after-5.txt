This is Conor Bradley’s world right now and we’re all living in it. What a footballer. And what a dream night for this wonderful young 20-year-old from Tyrone capping a dynamic display with a stunning first goal for Northern Ireland to beat Scotland at Hampden Park.

The boy keeps getting better and better and Michael O’Neill’s young team are on the same trajectory.

This was an outstanding, disciplined performance from the visitors who fought for everything all over the pitch and were rewarded with a fabulous morale boosting victory.

There were heroes wherever you looked for Northern Ireland from the composed Bailey Peacock-Farrell in goal, to the commanding back three of Daniel Ballard, Paddy McNair and Eoin Toal, to the fearless and fabulous wing backs Trai Hume and Brodie Spencer to the tireless Ali McCann and Shea Charles in midfield and Isaac Price and Jamie Reid in attack.

Then there was the superhero Bradley who wore his white shirt like a cape scoring what turned out to be the only goal of the game in the first half.

Northern Ireland's goalscorer Conor Bradley

It’s a joy seeing this kid play for Northern Ireland with all his pace, power, energy, drive, heart and commitment to the cause…and his quality, oh his quality. It oozed out of him at Hampden with O’Neill playing him in a more attacking role after shining at right-wing back in Friday’s 1-1 draw in Romania.

That worked a treat.

The manager made three changes from Bucharest with Peacock-Farrell, new dad Ballard and McCann replacing Conor Hazard, Jordan Thompson and Paddy Lane.

The Scots made two alterations to the side that started in their 4-0 defeat away to the Netherlands - Lyndon Dykes came in up front for Lawrence Shankland and Liam Cooper replaced Ryan Porteous.

When the British Home Championships were going strong this fixture was an annual event but tonight’s encounter was the first between the nations since 2015 when Scotland won 1-0 in a friendly in which McNair made his international debut.

Back then in O’Neill’s first spell in charge, his side were on their way to qualifying for the Euro 2016 finals while Scotland were in the wilderness.

Fast forward nine years and it is the Tartan Army who are preparing to invade Germany to attend this summer’s European Championships with the Green and White Army hoping a major tournament is not far away.

The last time Northern Ireland defeated Scotland was 41 years ago - 2-0 at Windsor Park in 1983 courtesy of goals from Norman Whiteside and Sammy McIlroy - during the final British Championship which Billy Bingham’s side won.

Before kick-off the home fans booed and jeered the Northern Ireland anthem God Save The King and in turn the away supporters did the same when Flower of Scotland was played.

A friendly? Do me a favour.

Early on in the battle of the fans there was only one winner in the stands with the Ulster boys making all the noise taunting the Scots about their country being a ‘small part of England’.

Scotland’s flower wilted in the closing stages in Amsterdam but seeking to end a winless run of six games, they began by dominating possession here though failed to do anything productive with it.

Ryan Christie fired well wide and from a free-kick in an excellent position Scott McTominay’s shot was blocked.

There were no alarms for the visitors in the first period with O'Neill's side keeping their shape superbly.

Hume smashing into a challenge on Scotland skipper Andy Robertson on the half hour mark underlined the determination of the Northern Ireland players. The Liverpool full-back would go off injured moments later but not before he had watched his Anfield team-mate score a spectacular goal to give Northern Ireland the lead.

With 32 minutes on the clock Bradley seized on the ball inside the Scotland box after a Nathan Patterson mistake and drove towards goal cutting inside from the left before unleashing a cracking right foot effort which took a slight deflection of Jack Hendry and roared into the top corner of the net beyond the despairing dive of Angus Gunn.

Northern Ireland’s last three goals have been superb team strikes. This was all about one man – the marvellous Liverpool star netting his first goal for his country.

What a way to do it. Pure class.

He celebrated by running towards the joyous 1500 Northern Ireland fans and doing a knee slide in front of them.

This was a moment to savour and a first goal for a Northern Ireland player at Hampden since Billy Hamilton in 1981.

It was also the first goal scored by a Liverpool player for a Northern Ireland team in 110 years.

Billy Lacey, who also played for the Reds, did it in 1914 when it was the Ireland team.

Becoming a regular in Jurgen Klopp’s side, Bradley has been breaking records for fun this season. Back in January he was the first Northern Ireland player to feature in a league game for the Merseysiders since Sammy Smyth in 1954 and when he scored against Chelsea in the same month it was the first goal from one of our own in a Liverpool shirt for 70 years.

“There’s only one Conor Bradley,” roared the travelling support in tribute.

With the home crowd growing frustrated and Scotland players feeling the strain and giving the ball away, the visitors could have scored twice more before the break with Bradley at the heart of both breaks.

First after an intelligent ball from Price, the Liverpool player set Charles away inside the box with the Southampton midfielder striking wide when he ought to have hit the target. Then Price and Charles were involved again before Bradley was crowded out in the area.

The Scots were all over the place. They had 77% possession in the first 45 but it was Northern Ireland making their 23% count.

Northern Ireland were just as fired up in the second half with Hume showing McTominay who was boss and Ballard blocking out substitute Lewis Ferguson.

Scotland continued to search for an equaliser as the clock ticked down but O’Neill’s side were not going to be denied a famous victory with outfield players throwing their bodies on the line and Peacock-Farrell making saves when required.

Josh Magennis ran his heart out as did other substitutes Conor McMenamin, Paul Smyth and Jordan Thompson.

This was Northern Ireland’s night. This was O’Neill’s night in the country where he lives and is admired and this was the magnificent Conor Bradley’s night.

Glory in Glasgow.

Northern Ireland were fantastic there, absolutely fantastic. 

Yes, Scotland dominated possession. And yes, Northern Ireland rode their luck at times. But Michael O'Neill's team were so well structured and defended so well. Brilliant stuff
