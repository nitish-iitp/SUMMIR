Scotland fans loudly booed the British national anthem God Save The King ahead of their game against Northern Ireland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night.

Northern Ireland sing the song ahead of every game, but it was not well received by some patriotic Scots, who tried to drown out the anthem as it was played on the stadium's speakers before the friendly kicked off.

Visiting supporters responded to the jeers in kind, by whistling their way through the Flower of Scotland, the anthem for the hosts. 

Scotland supporters booed at the end of the game too, as they responded to their 1-0 defeat to Northern Ireland, courtesy of Conor Bradley's first-half goal. 

Bradley capitalised on a mistake from Nathan Patterson, before darting into the penalty box and thumping a looping effort into the top right-hand corner of the goal to break his international duck.

Scotland and Liverpool also suffered a potential injury setback with Andy Robertson holding his ankle in pain as he was substituted off for the hosts. 

The booing at the start of the game by the Tartan Army is one of several examples of people showing their disapproval of God Save The King at football games in recent months.

Back in September, Scotland fans did a similar thing during their home game against England, which they ultimately lost 3-1.

There have been similar incidents at club games too. Liverpool fans made a barrage of noise to block out the national anthem ahead of the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea last month.

In May, Celtic displayed an anti-Charles banner on the same day as his coronation as King.   

Whilst Northern Ireland failed to qualify for Euro 2024, and turn their attentions to Nations League in September, Scotland have friendlies against Gibraltar and Finland in June as they gear up for their Group A games against Germany, Switzerland and Hungary.
