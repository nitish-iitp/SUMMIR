The Black Stars are back from Bamako where they recorded a dramatic 2-1 victory over Mali on Matchday 3 of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Jordan Ayew’s 94th minute goal gave Ghana a 2-1 win against Mali at Stade du 26 Mars in Bamako on Thursday. Ghana’s contingent touched down at the Nana Agyemang Prempeh I International Airport in Kumasi at 1:15am via ASKY Airlines. The team will continue preparations for the next game against Central African Republic, scheduled for Monday, June 10, 2024.

Ghana were forced to dig deep for the points after Kamory Doumbia gave Mali the lead in the 45th minute. Ernest Nuamah leveled matters with a towering header in the 58th minute before Jordan Ayew combined with fellow substitute Abdul Fatawu Issahaku to fire home the winning goal in the 94th minute.

The Black Stars are level on points (6) with Group I leaders Comoros, who travel to Madagascar on Friday, June 7, 2024. Ghana will host Central African Republic at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on Monday, June 10, 2024.
