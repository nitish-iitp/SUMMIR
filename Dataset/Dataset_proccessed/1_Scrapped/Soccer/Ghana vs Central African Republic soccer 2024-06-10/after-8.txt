Hat-trick hero Jordan Ayew says he is always ready to give his all despite being played out of position on several occasions.

The Crystal Palace forward stole the headlines on Monday evening as the Black Stars defeated the Central African Republic.

Jordan scored three goals in the 4-3 win at the Baba Yara Stadium on match day four of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.

Speaking after the game, the 32-year-old talked about his readiness to sacrifice for the national team.

“I've been playing out of position for quite some time in the national team and also at the club level. But I have always done my duty, put my country first, and never complained because I always give my all,” he said.

On what his favourite position is, Jordan added: “It’s difficult [to say]. It's not something that I like to talk about but obviously my favourite position right from the academy in France, in the national team has always been as a number 9."

“But I understand because I have qualities that allow me to play in the pockets of spaces, and I don't complain.”

Jordan’s three goals on Monday night take his tally to 28 goals for Ghana becoming the country’s 6th all-time top scorer.
