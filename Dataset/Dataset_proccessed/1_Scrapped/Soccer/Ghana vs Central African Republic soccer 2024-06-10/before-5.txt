Ghana's Black Stars

Ghana’s senior national team, the Black Stars, were given a rousing welcome in Kumasi after beating Mali 2-1 in Bamako at the Stade du 26 Mars on Thursday, June 6, 2024.

Coach Otto Addo and his charges left Mali the night after their win and boarded the next available flight to Ghana.

The team arrived in Ghana around 2:00 am on Friday, June 7, 2024.

Immediately upon arrival in the country, the players received a rousing welcome and moved straight to their hotel in the Ashanti Region.

The Black Stars will later have a recovery training session in Kumasi as they prepare for their next match.

Ghana will host the Central African Republic in their next match on Monday, June 10, 2024.

Ahead of the match, the Central African Republic is expected to be in Ghana by Saturday for the match.

A goal from Jordan Ayew was all Ghana needed to beat Mali 2-1 in their encounter on Thursday, June 6, 2024.

Jordan Ayew came off the bench to score the match-winner after Ernest Nuamah had equalized for the Black Stars, cancelling out Doumbia’s goal for Mali.
