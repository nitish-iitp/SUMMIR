Preview: Mauritania vs. Egypt - prediction, team news, lineups

Egypt's perfect Africa Cup of Nations 2025 qualifying record will be put to the test when they travel to face Mauritania at Stade Cheikha Ould Boidiya on Tuesday in Group C.

The hosts are last in fourth place with three points after three games and lost 2-0 last Friday against Tuesday's opponents, while the visitors are first with nine points but will have to cope without star Mohamed Salah, who was released early from international duty.

Mauritania began their qualifying campaign positively when they beat Botswana 1-0 on September 7, but they subsequently lost 2-0 against Cape Verde on September 10, before going down against Egypt in their third game.

Though the hosts were able to hold out until the 69th minute when Trezeguet scored Egypt's first of the game, the Lions of Chinguetti can have few complaints about the scoreline given just one of their 11 shots was on target.

Manager Amir Abdou, who has been in charge since 2022, will be aware that fans may expect the national side to qualify for AFCON considering they have reached the finals of the last three editions of the tournament.

Abdou's team have been bested their last two games and have lost 10, drawn three and won just two of their last 15 matches, scoring in just four of those fixtures.

Mauritania have won four and lost four of their eight most recent home games, and to their credit they have won seven, drawn two and lost just one of their last 10 matches at home.

Egypt come into Tuesday's game without Salah, who manager Hossam Hassan said was being rested for the fixture amid rumours the Liverpool forward had asked to not be involved against Mauritania.

Hassan has raised several concerns about the hosts in the build-up to their second clash, citing their opponents' aggressive play style and artificial pitch as reasons to be worried about the welfare of his players.

The Pharaohs will be hoping that this qualifying campaign can be the start of a successful AFCON tournament in 2025, especially in light of the fact they have finished as runners-up in two of the last four editions of the competition.

Hassan's side have won their last three games, scoring nine goals and keeping three clean sheets in that period.

Egypt have also won their seven most recent AFCON qualifiers, and have in fact won 15, drawn four and lost just one of their last 20 qualification matches.

The Pharaohs have won their three most recent away games, although they did lose one, draw three and win just one of the previous five fixtures on the road.

Centre-back Hassan Houbeib may come into the starting XI on Tuesday given he replaced Lamine Ba at half time against Egypt.

Houbeib could be joined in the backline by right-back Ibrahima Keita, centre-back Mohamed Dellahi Yali and left-back Aly Abeid.

Oumar Ngom and Bodda Mouhsine are likely to be chosen to feature in a double pivot, while Papa Ndiaga Yade and Aboubakar Kamara could start up front.

Meanwhile, Egypt may turn to Mostafa Fathy in Salah's absence, and the winger could be joined in the forward line by Zizo, Ibrahim Adel and Omar Marmoush.

Defender Mohamed Abdelmonem was substituted off as a result of injury in his side's last match, and he could be replaced on Tuesday by Ahmed Ramadan.

Ramadan may be partnered in defence by Ahmed Eid, Rami Rabia and Mohamed Hamdi.


Mauritania possible starting lineup:
Diop; Keita, Yali, Houbeib, Abeid; Thiam, Ngom, Mouhsine, Koita; Yade, Kamara

Egypt possible starting lineup:
El-Shenawy; Eid, Rabia, Ramadan, Hamdi; Attia, Fathi; Fathy, Zizo, Adel; Marmoush



We say: Mauritania 1-1 Egypt

While Egypt are in exceptional form, they could struggle against Mauritania's aggressive play style.

It would also not be surprising if the visitors struggled in the final third without the presence of Salah, who is both a hub of creativity and a source of goals.
