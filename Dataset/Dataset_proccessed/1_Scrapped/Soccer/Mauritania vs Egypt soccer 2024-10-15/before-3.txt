Ward 1 Alderman Chris Morgan has two items on the agenda for the aldermanic Committee on Lands and Buildings, which meets Tuesday at 5:30 p.m at City Hall — to name the soccer field at Livingston Park after longtime Central High coach Chris LaBerge, and name the soccer field at Sheridan-Emmett Park after former Central soccer star Thamba Mbungu, found shot dead at Derryfield Park in Manchester on Oct. 23, 2021.
