Albania will face Liechtenstein on Monday

Albania will face Liechtenstein at the Haladás Sportkomplexum on Monday in a friendly clash between the two teams. Kuqezinjtë are set to make their second-ever appearance in the European Championship this summer and their first since 2016.

They locked horns with Sweden in a friendly clash in their most recent outing, suffering a narrow 1-0 defeat and will be looking to return to winning ways on Monday. Following the midweek clash, Albania will face Azerbaijan next weekend before kicking off their Euro 2024 campaign against Italy midway through the month.

Liechtenstein, meanwhile, endured a wretched run of results during the Euro qualifiers last year and will hope they can find better luck in the UEFA Nations League later in the year. They played out a 1-1 draw against Latvia last time out, taking the lead in the opening minute via an own goal before their opponents drew level minutes later.

Albania vs Liechtenstein Prediction

Albania are on a run of back-to-back defeats after going undefeated in their eight games prior. They are without a win in their last four games on foreign grounds and will be desperate to snap that streak on Monday.

Liechtenstein are on a poor 37-game winless run, with 33 of those games ending in defeat. The sheer gulf in class and quality between the two teams should see Kuqezinjtë win this one fairly easily.

Prediction: Albania 2-0 Liechtenstein
