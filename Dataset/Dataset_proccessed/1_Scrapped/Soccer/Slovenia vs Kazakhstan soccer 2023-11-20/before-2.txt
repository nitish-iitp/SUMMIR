Preview: Slovenia vs. Kazakhstan - prediction, team news, lineups

Slovenia and Kazakhstan meet in a huge, winner-takes-all encounter in Euro 2024 qualifying on Monday.

A win for the visitors on Friday paired with Slovenia's defeat in Denmark means a Kazakh victory here will send them through, while any other result will be enough for the hosts.

Regardless of the result here, we will have an unfamiliar name among the finalists at Euro 2024 next summer.

Slovenia have only reached the European Championships once since independence from Yugoslavia - at Euro 2000 - and have not qualified for a major tournament in 13 years.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan will have their sights set on a first-ever major tournament since their breakup of the Soviet Union.

Even as an Asian participant, Kazakhstan failed to reach both the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, as well as the 1996 and 2000 Asian Cups, and they have never before threatened the qualifying spots since joining UEFA.

They come into matchday 10 still in contention with their fate still in their own hands too, after Slovenia were beaten in Denmark on Friday.

That was just Slovenia's second defeat in 15 competitive games, but they still have work to do to progress in this group, despite picking up 19 points from their nine qualifiers so far.

Entering the fixture in the top two, with a one-point advantage over Kazakhstan, means Matjaz Kek's side are still heavy favourites to progress though.

In a group where near-perfection has been required, they are paying the price for costly defeats in Finland and Denmark.

When they beat Kazakhstan 2-1 on matchday one, the Slovenians probably had no idea how crucial that win may have been come November, but it could end up being the win that proves decisive.

Magomed Adiyev's side will be out to avenge that defeat though, and in doing so, creating Kazakh footballing history, by reaching a first-ever major finals as an independent nation.

A win over San Marino on Friday means the most eastern nation participating in the qualifiers have won six of their eight fixtures since losing to Slovenia back in March.

Recording wins both home and away against Northern Ireland, as well as a shock, come-from-behind successes against Nordic duo Denmark and Finland have been vital.

Kazakhstan's form from the Nations League last year suggests this is no fluke either, as they won their group containing Slovakia, Azerbaijan and Belarus.

That has guaranteed them a playoff spot for the Euros even if they fail to win here, as well as a place in League B of the next Nations League in a year's time.

Domen Crnigoj and David Brekalo are the only notable absentees from the Slovenia squad gathered together by Kek this month.

Miha Zajc and Sandi Lovric are among two of the most high-profile players in the squad, but they have been struggling for game time with the national side of late.

RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is the talisman of the side, and he will likely need to be on form if Slovenia are to seal their place at Euro 2024 here.

Kazakhstan are significantly weakened in midfield by the absences of Besiktas' Bakhtiyar Zaynutdinov and captain Askhat Tagybergen.

Fellow regular Bauyrzhan Islamkhan is also on the sidelines, alongside defender Mikhail Gabyshev, who are not in the squad.

Zenit St Petersburg centre-back Nuraly Alip was left out of the side that beat San Marino but should return to the side for this one.

Slovenia possible starting lineup:
Oblak; Karnicnik, Blazic, Bijol, Janza; Verbic, Gnezda Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Vipotnik, Sesko

Kazakhstan possible starting lineup:
Shatskiy; Kairov, Bystrov, Marochkin, Alip, Vorogovskiy; Beysebekov, Zuev, Chesnokov; Aymbetov, Samorodov



We say: Slovenia 3-1 Kazakhstan

Despite a potentially tense affair being on the cards for hosts Slovenia, knowing they only need to avoid defeat may settle the side down slightly after defeat on Friday.

Having come so close, Kazakhstan will be devastated if they are to fall at the final hurdle, but against a side who beat them at home earlier in the campaign, it may be just too much to ask for the dark horses in Group H.
