We're in the second phase and what's it like afterwards?

2nd - There are nine groups divided into 36 teams, with the top 26 in the FIFA Ranking + the other teams from the previous round. The nine group winners and runners-up advance to the third round and automatically qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup.

3rd- There are three groups of 18 teams, with six teams in each. The top two will go through to the World Cup, while third and fourth place respectively will go through to the next round.

4th - The six teams are divided into two groups of three. The first-placed teams in each group seal their place in the World Cup, while the rest go through to the fifth and final stage.

5 - The teams will face each other in two games to determine who will decide their place in the play-offs.

Speak,Mano Pölking!

"We're back in Singapore once again, and we have fond memories of winning the AFF championship two years ago. This game will be difficult for both teams. We're in the same situation. That is, we lost the first game. But now we have to stay focused and we're ready to win this game.

It's normal to put the pressure on in this game. But we talked within the team that we couldn't stay down, we had to get up quickly. and get back to concentrating on this game again As the time periods are quite close together, there's no time to be disappointed. We have to concentrate and do our best to win."

Speak, Nishigaya!

"We knew it was always going to be tough and although it was a physically intense game, I'm proud of my players' effort tonight. Now we have to focus on the game against Thailand, which we'll be playing at home, and it's crucial that we get a positive result."

Singapore National Stadium

The Singapore National Stadium is an imposing architectural feat located in the heart of the city-state of Singapore. Opened in 2014, the stadium is a symbol of Singapore's commitment to sport and excellence in infrastructure.

With a capacity of more than 55,000 spectators, the National Stadium is home to prestigious sporting events and large-scale entertainment. Its distinctive design, marked by a unique and bold dome, stands out in the city skyline and symbolizes the modernity and innovation that characterize Singapore. 

The stadium was designed with versatility in mind, being able to host a variety of events, from soccer matches and international sports competitions to world-class concerts and shows. It is the only one in the world to encompass a special design for soccer, rugby, cricket and athletics events.  The retractable dome is a notable feature, allowing the space to be adapted for different purposes and weather conditions, providing a comfortable experience for spectators.

In addition to its impressive facilities, the Singapore National Stadium incorporates sustainable and ecological technologies, reflecting the country's commitment to environmental responsibility. The areas around the stadium have also been designed to offer a complete experience, with commercial facilities, green spaces and amenities that complement the venue's vibrant atmosphere.

The venue is home to the Singapore national soccer team, the Singapore national cricket team and the Sunwolves, a Super Rugby team. It has also hosted a number of international events, including the 2015 Southeast Asian Games, the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2022 AFC Champions League final.
