The Singaporean players look up to the stands as they line up ahead of kickoff and prepare to sing the national anthem. 29,644 fans filled the National Stadium on Wednesday evening, surpassing the attendance for the Singapore Festival of Football match between Lion City Sailors and Tottenham Hostpur in July earlier this year.

With a more defensive game plan by Takayuki Nishigaya, Shawal Anuar was often deployed to help subdue Thai attacks. Hassan Sunny is on high alert as a threatening Theerathon Bunmathan skips past the Singaporean forward.

Theerathon Bunmathan embraces his teammates after Supachok Sarachat’s opener, assisted by Ekanit Panya. The goal came after only five minutes into the game. The War Elephants were charged with adrenaline and excitement, especially since coming into the game with a loss to China.

Ryhan Stewart makes a last ditch tackle in a crowded penalty area, blocking off Chalermsak Aukkee's shot towards goal. It was a busy shift for the Singaporean defence, who despite their best attempts conceded three goals.

Ikhsan Fandi made his long-awaited return to the pitch since December 2022, earning a deafening chorus of cheers from the crowd, second only to Shawal Anuar’s goal. Fate had it that the forward returned to action for the first time since his serious knee injury in a Singapore jersey, which he suffered while also on national duty 339 days ago.

Hassan Sunny gathers the ball safely, as he had done countless times in the game to keep the scoreline tamed. His most heroic save came in the second half, when a shot was deflected as it hit Safuwan Baharudin on its way to the goal. Despite the ball’s altered trajectory, the 39-year-old dove at full stretch to parry it away.

Often seen breaking away from Singapore’s half of the pitch in an attempt to lead a counter attack, Song Ui Yong was one of the home side’s best performers before being taken off in the second half. Here, he turns away skillfully from Sarach Yooyen.

Suphanat Mueanta, younger brother of Supachok Sarachat was a constant threat on the pitch. Nazrul Nazari keeps his eyes on the ball with knees bent, ready to pounce for the ball.

As per tradition at the end of international games, The Singa Brigade sing the national anthem, ‘Majulah Singapura’ in unison with the players stood in front of them on the pitch. Win or lose, the group of fans hold the flag up proudly for the team.

The Thai players celebrate the 3-1 win with their travelling fans, some clad in Thai traditional costumes. The away corner of the stadium was atmospheric for a full 90 minutes, competing with the Singa Brigade a few sections away. After every Thai goal, a massive Thai flag was unfurled in celebration.
