Singapore's national football team is hoping to give home fans something to shout about when they host Thailand in a World Cup qualifier tomorrow at the National Stadium.

About 20,000 tickets have been snapped up. Both teams will be looking to pick up their first points in Group C, after suffering defeats in their opening matches .Coach

Takayuki Nishigaya is aware of the scale of the challenge, acknowledging that Thailand are technically adept and have talented players. Jeraldine Yap reports. The match will be screened "live" on Channel 5, mewatch and Mediacorp Entertainment on Youtube.

I seriously think they may have a chance cos home ground advantage.

Home ground goal post is bigger when lions attack and smaller when opponent attack.

Grass also smoother to lions boots compared with opponents.

When lion doing corner kick , the distance also shorter to goal post

Most importantly is when the soccer ball touch lions boots it will be able to move more powerful and curl or straight whenever required.

Thailand confirm no chance

More nonsensical articles from media
I hope that media will be professional & write article professionally analyzing Singapore's chances taking into account Thais' game & weaknesses & how Singapore can exploit it
Instead the usual home ground advantage and Singapore can just try try try and win
But who are we kidding
Haha

Only way homegrown have advantage is whenever Thailand on verge of scoring, they turn off the lights I mean power failure or at pivotal moment , release otters on pitch

More Incline to believe WC qualifiers are the highest actual serious match Thais can play against Singapore so they'll be more serious to get a result

Higher level Than Asian qualifiers or Suzuki Cup

18000 tickets given out to corporate sponsors so in reality only 2000 sold? LOL
