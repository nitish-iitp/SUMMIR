WHAT HAPPENED?

Shanga Forsbeg, wife of Emil and mother of his two children, wrote a lengthy statement on social media accusing the NYRB midfielder of a multitude of things, announcing at the end that she is filing for a divorce.

WHAT SHANGA FORSBERG SAID

'We will part ways. Words I thought I would never utter after two children and 19 years together and that still feel unreal," she wrote on Instagram in Swedish.

"'I have loved you more than anything and always supported you. But even love has its limits. The greatest love is my children and I want them to know their worth just as I know mine. Being taken for granted and neglected is not love. A new start in New York was apparently a new start for you and your life. It was just that I, being a child, did not know about it beforehand. But it became painfully clear quickly. In the newspapers, we have read and seen that you are doing well and are 'enjoying every moment'. You also have future plans. We didn't know about them either.

"If the reporters even knew you've been talking to them more than your family these past few months. Since you haven't communicated at all, apart from insisting that you can't explain your actions, let time tell what it was you wanted to achieve by ghosting your family. I hope that in the future you can show respect and consideration for others despite your own needs. And have the courage and maturity to communicate.

"I will continue to put the children's well-being and need for security first. For your sake, I hope you don't regret it and that your new life in NY is worth a divorce and the way you treated your children and their mother."

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Forsberg has yet to address the statement as he's on international duty with Sweden. The NYRB captain has one goal and one assist in four MLS matches this season since arriving from Leipzig.

He was married in 2016, has two young children and had been with his partner - Shanga - for 19 years.

WHAT NEXT FOR NYRB?

Forsberg and Sweden take on Albania in an international friendly Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, the Red Bulls face Orlando City in an Eastern Conference clash on Saturday.
