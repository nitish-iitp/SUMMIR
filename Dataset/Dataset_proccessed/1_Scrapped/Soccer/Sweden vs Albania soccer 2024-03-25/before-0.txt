The reverse fixture saw a narrow 1-0 victory for Everton, adding an extra layer of anticipation to this encounter.

Team Analysis

Everton Ladies are under pressure to break free from a troubling three-game losing streak, highlighted by recent setbacks against Manchester City, Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-finals, and Aston Villa. The team’s resilience was tested when they succumbed to a 2-0 deficit against Villa, only managing a late consolation goal. The absence of key players like Emily Ramsey, Sara Holmgaard, Karoline Olesen due to injuries, and Elise Stenevik due to suspension, poses additional challenges. However, the potential return of Katrine Veje and Karen Holmgaard could offer a late boost.

Liverpool Women are riding a wave of confidence, coming off a comfortable 3-1 victory against West Ham, marking their third consecutive WSL win. With Leanne Kiernan, Missy Bo Kearns, and Sophie Roman Haug finding the back of the net consistently, Liverpool’s attack appears formidable. Despite missing Sofie Lundgaard for the rest of the season and Taylor Hinds, the anticipated return of Fuka Nagano could fortify their midfield. Liverpool’s success on the road, with three wins in their last four away matches, will embolden their quest for a derby victory.

Prediction

Given the current dynamics and recent performances, Goal.mu/Mauri.bet predicts: Everton Ladies 1-2 Liverpool Women. Liverpool’s coherent team play and robust form, coupled with Everton’s struggle to navigate through injuries and suspensions, tilt the balance in favour of the Reds. Additionally, Liverpool’s effective attacking force is expected to exploit Everton’s recent defensive vulnerabilities.
