Senegal clinched a narrow 1#0 ein against Niger at the Abdoulaye Wade stadium in Diamniadio on Monday January 8, 2024. The Teranga Lions exhibited a resilient performance to snatch the win in stoppage time before traveling to Cote D’Ivoire.

Senegal’s coach Aliou Cissé used a tactical 3-4-3 formation.

Sadio Mané, who celebrated his marriage the previous day started on the bench alongside Gana Gueye and Youssouf Sabaly, while Boulaye Dia’s potential absence for AFCON heightened speculation.

The encounter saw a momentary shift to a moderate pace, with Senegal commanding the ball but failing to convert possession into clear chances.

Pape Gueye’s long-range attempts missed the target, while the Menas of Niger occasionally tested Edouard Mendy, who eventually made way for Mory Diaw at halftime due to a hand injury.

The second half unfolded with Senegal continuing their offensive onslaught. Lamine Camara’s free-kick sailed just over the crossbar, signaling the Lions’ intent.

Pape Gueye and Abdou Diallo attempted to break the deadlock with set-piece opportunities, but Niger’s goalkeeper, Younoussa Hainikoye, remained vigilant.

The defining moment arrived in the 90th +9 minute when Formose Mendy, introduced in the second half, capitalized on a defensive mix-up, slotting the ball into the net from close range.

The late goal sealed Senegal’s 1#0 victory, leaving fans eager and optimistic as the Teranga Lions embarked on their AFCON 2023 campaign in Cote D’Ivoire.
