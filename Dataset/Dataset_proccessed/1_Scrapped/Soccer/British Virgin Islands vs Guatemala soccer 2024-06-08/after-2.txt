CHEYENNE — Cheyenne Central boys soccer coach Dirk Dijkstal knew pretty early on that Sammy Shumway was going to be special. Dijkstal was an assistant at the time under former Central boys coach Tim Dennison during Shumway’s freshmen year, when the team ran a completely different style of offense.

To use Dijkstal’s words, Shumway got pushed around in that position. A lot.
