KUWAIT CITY, Nov 21: On Tuesday, the Australian national football team secured a victory over their Palestinian counterparts in a match held at Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium in Kuwait, as part of the joint Asian qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup and the 2027 Asian Cup. The match began with the Palestinian team displaying determined efforts, buoyed by a large crowd, but the Australian team managed to break the deadlock, scoring a goal in the 18th minute through player Harry Soutar.

In the second half, the Palestinian coach implemented strategic changes to diversify attacks, but these efforts were unsuccessful, resulting in their second defeat in the group stage. With this win, the Australian team claimed the top spot in the group, amassing six points, followed by Lebanon with two points, Palestine and Bangladesh in third place with one point each, and Kuwait securing the last place. The match attracted a massive turnout of Kuwaiti, Palestinian, and Arab fans who rallied in support of the Palestinian team.

The crowd chanted slogans in solidarity with the cause and voiced their opposition against the Zionist entity. In the seventh minute of the match, fans waved keffiyehs and proudly raised the Palestinian flag, symbolizing Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which began on October 7th. Due to ongoing events in Gaza, Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium in Kuwait hosted the match as part of Kuwait's unwavering and supportive stance towards their Palestinian brethren.
