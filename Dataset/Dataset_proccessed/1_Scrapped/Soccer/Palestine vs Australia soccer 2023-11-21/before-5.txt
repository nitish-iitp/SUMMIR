Graham Arnold's Subway Socceroos coaching timeline
Socceroos.com.au
Updated: 10:09pm Nov 16, 2023
With Graham Arnold set to break the record for most Subway Socceroos 'A' international games coached on Thursday against Bangladesh, we look back at some of his highlights in the dugout.

Arnold has experienced two separate spells with the national team as a head coach and is somewhat synonymous with the Socceroos fabric both as a player and now manager, and the values and culture he has instilled - famously coining the term 'Aussie DNA' last year.

The 60-year-old has never been one to shy away from the honour and immense pride that comes with leading the Green and Gold and it is that undeniable passion and belief imparted on the squad which has the team heading in an upward trajectory off the back of the team's most successful performance at a FIFA World Cup™ in 2022.

The optimism around the squad has never been higher as an abundance of players, possessing lots of potential, are in or around the side making for an exciting time.


And on Thursday night at AAMI Park, the Aussies are again in action where Arnold will surpass friend and former teammate and colleague in Frank Farina.

After representing the Socceroos as a player between 1985 and 1997, earning 56 'A' caps while scoring 19 goals, Arnold ventured into coaching and from 2000 to 2006 served as an assistant coach to both Farina and Guus Hiddink. 

Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Arnold took over on an interim basis until 2007, while also looking after the Subway Olyroos and in charge at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. He remained an assistant to Pim Verbeek before heading into club football, enjoying immense success with the Central Coast Mariners and Sydney FC.

Arnold returned to the Socceroos in 2018 after the World Cup in Russia and also took control of the Olyroos and led the squad to the Tokyo Summer Olympics.

Here is a timeline of some of his milestones with the Subway Socceroos.
