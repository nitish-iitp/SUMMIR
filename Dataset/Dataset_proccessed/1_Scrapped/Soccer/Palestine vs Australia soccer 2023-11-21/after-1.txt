Is Harry Souttar a striker in disguise? ⚽🤔
With 10 Goals now for the @Socceroos, the towering Defender could easily be mistaken for one. @Michael_Zappone talked with the @LCFC Center Back, a short time ago.

My apologies to those of you who stayed up until the small hours to watch the game; it wasn’t one exactly one for the books. But Australia won and Harry Souttar scored again, so things could be worse. Thanks for your company – goodnight.

Here's the Full-Time Match Stats for Palestine vs Australia.
It's the @Socceroos that take home the win, thanks to some Harry Souttar and Mat Ryan magic.

There’s plenty of goodwill at the final whistle, with Jamie Maclaren talking to a couple of Palestine players. And then the TV coverage cuts to the highlights, so I’ve no idea what happened next.

Full time: Palestine 0-1 Australia

Football, as we are told ad nauseam, is a results business. In that sense it’s been a perfectly good night for Australia, though their attacking performance, left a fair bit to be desired.

The goal machine Harry Souttar headed the winner against a Palestine team who defended admirably but lacked composure in the final third. Even so, the Socceroos needed Mat Ryan to make one of the best saves of his career on the stroke of half-time. A draw wouldn’t have flattered Palestine.

Things were generally more comfortable for Australia in the second half, with the substitute Jordy Bos coming closest when he powered a header against the bar.

It's Full-Time in Kuwait, and the @Socceroos continue their successful @FIFAWorldCup Qualifying run.
It finishes Australia - 1, Palestine - 0.

90+3 min Saldana releases Dabbagh on the left with a stylish flick behind his standing leg. Dabbagh’s cross, alas, is too close to Ryan.

90+2 min Souttar, perfectly positioned on the edge of the area, makes his umpteenth interception of the night. Even if he hadn’t scored the only goal, he would be my player of the match.

89 min Baccus is penalised for handball on the left wing, another chance for Palestine. It’s half cleared and then swung back into the area. There’s a big penalty appeal when Wadi is challenged by Borrello right on the edge of the area. The referee says no and replays show that both players missed the ball.

87 min Al-Battat’s free-kick is headed away emphatically by either Souttar or Duke at the near post.

86 min: Palestine substitution Before the free-kick is taken, Mahmoud Wadi comes on for Zaid Qunbar.

85 min Miller tangles with Qunbar on the left edge of the area and is penalised, a little harshly I think. This is a chance for Palestine.

84 min Metcalfe’s deep corner is headed wide by Irvine, though the whistle had gone for a free-kick. Good thing for Irvine because it was basically an open goal.

83 min A good move from Australia. Borrello’s floated cross is headed down by Metcalfe to Duke, back to goal near the penalty spot. He tees up the onrushing Irvine, whose shot is deflected behind from a corner.

81 min: Palestine substitution Islam Batran replaces Tamer Seyam, who was denied an equaliser by that remarkable save by Mat Ryan.

15.39 GMT

80 min Another desperate long-range shot goes high over the bar, this time from Seyam. Palestine have been impressive in many facets of the game, but they lack patience in the final third.

78 min After a nice run down the left by Bos, Baccus pings one from 25 yards. it hits Termanini and flies out for a throw-in.

77 min Cmilio Sandana has been booked, I think for dissent.

76 min This has been a tough game for Australia. Their attacking play has been unconvincing and, though Souttar and Rowles have been excellent, it still took an extraordinary save from Mat Ryan to maintain the lead.

72 min: Chance for Palestine! A match is never safe at 1-0. Abu Warda nicks the ball and feeds it into Dabbagh near the penalty spot. He takes a touch and hits a shot on the half turn that deflects behind for a corner. I’m not sure who made the block but it was a crucial one.

68 min Rowles is booked for a late, clumsy tackle on Dabbagh.

65 min: Bos hits the bar! The resulting corner, taken by Goodwin, is thumped against the crossbar by the head of Jordy Bos! He arrived late and unmarked, eight yards out, and will be frustrated that he didn’t score.

That said, Hamadi may have got a slight touch to divert the ball onto the bar; if he did it was a brilliant save. (I don’t think he did but you’ve got to cover all bases eh.)

64 min: Fine save by Hamadi! That’s the best move of the match. Duke backflicks the ball to Borrello, who returns the favour with another jaunty flick. Duke slides it back towards Borrello, who shoots first-time from the edge of the area. Hamadi gets down smartly to his right to push the ball behind.

62 min Miller screws a good pass into Metcalfe on the edge of the area. He can’t decide whether to shoot or pass, however, and Saleh (I think) makes a good tackle.

57 min Miller’s low cross is cut out at the near post by Saleh. As well as Palestine have defended, Graham Arnold will be disappointed with Australia’s work in the final third.

54 min There’s a brief bit of needle between Saldana and Miller. The referee invites them both to act their age and play resumes.

49 min Australia are very happy to eat up the time by passing the ball around in the middle third. Palestine will have to alter their approach at some stage.

The Socceroos lead in Kuwait, thanks mainly to the head of Harry Souttar and the hands of Mat Ryan. They haven’t played well, particularly in open play, but they’re ahead.

45+1 min: Great save by Ryan! What a chance for Palestine. The corner was taken short to Al-Battat, who swung a cross towards the far post. It bounced off Ataa Jaber and back across goal towards Seyam, barely three yards out. He stabbed the bouncing ball towards goal and Ryan, who charged back across his line and threw himself at Seyam’s feet, somehow clawed the ball round the post with his right hand. I’d like to see a replay but that looked like a seriously brilliant save.

Not sure how it's not 1-1 right now. #PLEvAUS

45 min Palestine have got two players marking Souttar now. But this time Goodwin’s corner evades him and is booted away at the near post.

43 min Metcalfe’s cross hits Saleh and goes behind for a corner. Harold Souttar Esq. is jogging forward.

42 min Palestine are definitely picking their moments to press. At some stage they will have to be more aggressive without the ball; for now it’s more important to stay within range of the Socceroos going into the last 20 minutes.
