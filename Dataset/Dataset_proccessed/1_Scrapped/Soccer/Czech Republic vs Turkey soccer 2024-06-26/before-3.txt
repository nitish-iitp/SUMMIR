BYTNT SPORTS

UPDATED 22/06/2024 AT 17:59 GMT+1

Patrik Schick cancelled out Georges Mikautadze’s strike as Georgia and Czech Republic played out a 1-1 draw at the Volksparkstadion in Euro 2024 Group F. The draw leaves both sides on one point, having played two matches. Portugal and Turkey - who play later - are on three each. Georgia complete their group stage with a match against Portugal, while Czech Republic play Turkey.

A Patrik Schick goal spared the blushes of Czech Republic as they played out a frantic 1-1 draw against Georgia at the Volksparkstadion.
The result means both teams go into the final round of group games at Euro 2024 capable of qualifying for the last 16. Georgia complete their group stage with a match against Portugal, while Czech Republic play Turkey.

Georgia took a deserved lead on the stroke of half-time with a penalty converted calmly by their striker, Georges Mikautadze after a somewhat controversial VAR check for handball from Robin Hranac.

Talking Point – Czech Republic rue missed opportunity as both teams stay in contention
After the half-time break, Czech Republic came out looking to use their dominance at set pieces to their advantage. As the half went on, it was evident how tired and leggy the Georgian defence was and the Czechs will be disappointed that they could not take advantage of this to register their first win at the tournament.
Player of the Match - Vladimir Coufal
The West Ham defender was dominant on and off the ball throughout the game. From whipping in dangerous balls into the box to covering the defence expertly, the Czech star played a huge role in helping his country come from behind to remain in contention for qualification.
Player Ratings
Georgia: G Mamardashvili 7, S Kverkvelia 5, G Kashia (c) 5, L Dvali 6, O Kakabadze 6, A Mekvabishvili 5, G Kochorashvili 5, H Tsitaishvili 6 (63’ Lochoshvili 4), G Mikautadze 7 (88’ Kvilitaia 5), K Kvaratskhelia 5 (82’ Lobzhanidze 4), Z Davitashvili 6 (62’ Chakvetadze 5)
Czech Republic: J Stanek 6, T Holes 4, R Hranac 4, L Krejci 5, T Soucek (c) 7, V Coufal 8*, L Provod 6 (81’ Barak 6), P Schick 7 (68’ Chytil 5), A Hlozek 4 (55’ Lingr 6), V Cerny 4 (55’ Jurasek 5)
Match Highlights
23' - DISALLOWED GOAL: Hlozek believes he has scored for Czech Republic but replays show he scored with his arm and the goal is ruled out.
45+2 - GOAL! GEORGIA 1 - 0 CZECH REPUBLIC (MIKAUTADZE): Calmly slotted away by the striker as Georgia take the lead on the stroke of half-time. That is a huge goal for the tournament debutants
58' - GOAL! GEORGIA 1 - 1 CZECH REPUBLIC (SCHICK): Equaliser for Czech Republic as their set-piece dominance continues. An out-swinging corner is bundled in by Patrik Schick and the Czechs have a deserved goal
90+5' - MISSED CHANCE: What drama at the end as Georgia break with a three on one. The shot at the end is put over the bar and the final kick of the game could have won the game for Georgia.
