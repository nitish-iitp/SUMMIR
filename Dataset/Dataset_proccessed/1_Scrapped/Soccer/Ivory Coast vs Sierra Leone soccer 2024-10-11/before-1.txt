Off the back of a first victory in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Zambia welcome Chad to the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium on Friday afternoon.
 
While the hosts head into this one on a high, the visitors will make the journey in need of a pick-me-up as they look to kickstart their qualifying campaign with all three points here.

Zambia showed great mettle to emerge triumphant from a thrilling five-goal contest against Sierra Leone when the teams locked horns on September 10.
 
Having thrown away 1-0 and 2-1 leads, Avram Grant's men were set for a share of the spoils on home turf, only for Kings Kangwa to grab the winning goal five minutes from the end of normal time.
 
That ended a dismal run of nine competitive outings without a victory for the Chipolopolo, who had also come away empty-handed from six consecutive matches prior.
 
While Grant saw his side fail to keep a clean sheet for the 15th straight game, he would have been pleased by their attacking output after five straight games without a goal.
 
Currently second in Group G of the AFCON qualifiers, Zambia could potentially pull five points clear of the chasing pack before next week's trip to Yaounde for the second leg of their double-header against Chad.
 
Chad's downward spiral continued in last month's encounter against the Elephants of Ivory Coast, which ended in a 2-0 defeat at Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo.
 
After setting up Jean-Philippe Krasso's opener on the stroke of half time, Oumar Diakite grabbed a second-half clincher in the 55th minute to leave Kevin Nicaise's men with what proved to be an insurmountable task.
 
It is now three defeats and a stalemate from the last four matches for Les Sao, who have exhibited glaring deficiencies at both ends of the pitch in that time, with five goals conceded and none scored.
 
Still yet to feature at an AFCON tournament proper, Chad, who sit bottom of their qualifying group, are running out of time to save their continental dreams ahead of Friday's clash in Ndola, where they will be aiming to pick up only a second away triumph since 2015.

Leicester City forward Patson Daka is still out of contention for Zambia having sustained an ankle injury during August's pre-season friendly against Lens.
 
Fashion Sakala remains out in the cold following a disagreement with Avram Grant, but Frankie Musonda is available to feature after recovering from an injury layoff.
 
Chipyoka Songa has been handed his maiden call-up for the home side, although it remains to be seen if he will make his international debut in this one.
 
Chad's Marius has directly contributed to three goals in his last four games at club level and will be looking to come up with the goods on the international scene.
 
Having racked up more appearances (32) and goals (five) for his nation than any other player, Casimir Ninga will be looking to extend both records here.


Zambia possible starting lineup:
Mulenga; Chepeshi, Chongo, Mwape; Banda, Chisala, Chama, Chaiwa, L Musonda; Kangwa, K Musonda

Chad possible starting lineup:
Allabatna; Osee, Abderamane, Nounchil, Thiam; Damba, Tchouplaou; Allarabaye, Yeo, Marius; Ninga



We say: Zambia 2-1 Chad

Chad have struggled in front of goal recently, and while we expect them to return to the scoresheet here, we are backing Zambia to carry the day in the end.
