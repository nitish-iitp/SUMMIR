World Cup 2026 (Q): Senegal held by Togo
World Cup 2026 (Q): Senegal held by Togo

The African champions came out swinging on Tuesday November 21. On Matchday 2 of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, the Lions of Senegal were thwarted by an audacious Togolese side. Although the Eperviers managed to draw (0-0) as they did in 2021, they can blame themselves for not coming away with a win. With Edouard Mendy at his best, Togo kept the Group B favourites at bay. Paulo Duarte's men picked up their second point in these qualifiers from 2 outings.
