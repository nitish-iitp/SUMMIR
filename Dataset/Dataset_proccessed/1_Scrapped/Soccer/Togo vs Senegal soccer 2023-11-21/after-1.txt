Football: Lions of Teranga 2023 in numbers
Football: Lions of Teranga 2023 in numbers

After a particularly successful year in 2022, the Lions of Teranga haven't had a hangover in the national team.Even if they've had some complicated seasons at club level, they're still going strong in the Senegal jersey, despite one or two bumps in the road.Discover Senegal's performances in 2023.

The reigning African champions are unlikely to play again in 2023. They played their last match at Kégué in Togo, where they have always struggled to win. Senegal were held to a 0-0 draw, their first 0-0 draw since the AFCON 2021 final, won on penalties against Egypt. The goalless draw was the 9th match for Aliou Cissé's men this year.

Two prestigious wins, first home defeat

In 2023, Senegal played nine matches. The Lions won 5 of them, including two prestigious victories. They defeated Brazil 4-2 in a summer friendly. It was the second time under Aliou Cissé that the Senegalese had come up against the nation with the most World Cup titles and they've never lost, as the two nations drew 1-1 in 2019. In addition to Brazil, Senegal also beat Cameroon (1-0), historically one of Senegal's bête noires. In addition to these two friendly victories away from home, the Lions delighted their fans at the Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade on March 24 against Mozambique in the qualifiers for AFCON 2023. It was a 5-1 manita with some outstanding goals.

However, not everything has been rosy. The Lions suffered their first defeat in their brand-new stadium. It was another bête noire who inflicted it on them. Algeria won 1-0 in Dakar. Since Cissé's arrival on the bench, Senegal have met the Fennecs five times, losing four of them 1-0, including one in the AFCON final, and drawing one 2-2.

Sadio the most decisive, Habib his lieutenant

The hero of the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon and a notable absentee from the 2022 World Cup, Sadio Mané made his return to the Senegalese national team last March and he has lost none of his influence. The number 10 was once again Senegal's top scorer in 2023. In 9 matches, he scored 6 goals, including a brace against Brazil (4-2). Mané was also the team's joint top passer with two assists.In 101 appearances for the Lions, he has scored 41 goals and provided 25 assists.

Behind Sadio Mané, Habib Diallo was the most decisive Senegalese player. Although he missed out on the 2022 World Cup and is not yet an indisputable starter up front, the former Génération Foot player still has two goals and two assists to his name in 2023 with the Lions of Teranga.

PMS, Camara, Iliman, Seck and Sabaly open their account Six players scored their first international goal in 2023.Iliman Ndiaye and Youssouf Sabaly opened their account against Mozambique last March in a 5-1 victory at the Stade Abdoulaye Wade. Abdoulaye Seck scored his first goal against Benin on June 17 (1-1). Mamadou Lamine Camara, African U20 champion, scored Senegal's goal in the 1-1 draw with Rwanda on the 6th and final day of the AFCON 2023 qualifiers. Against South Sudan last Saturday (4-0), young midfielders Pape Matar Sarr and Lamine Camara scored their first goals each.

Gana and Sadio, "centenarians", Kouyaté blocked at 90

The year 2023 will also go down in the annals of Senegalese soccer. Two of the team's key players have passed the 100-cap mark. They are the first Senegalese footballers to do so. Idrissa Gana Guèye was exactly the first. The defensive midfielder, launched into the national team by Amara Traoré in November 2011 during a 4-1 victory over Guinea, reached 100 caps on March 24, 2023 against Mozambique and Sadio Mané, who made his first appearance for the Lions of Teranga in May 2012 against Morocco (1-0) thanks to the late Joseph Koto, celebrated his 100th last Saturday against South Sudan. This duo could be joined in 2024 by another Mammoth, Cheikhou Kouyaté. He has 90 caps to his name.
