Haiti face Puerto Rico on Friday

Puerto Rico welcome Haiti to Mayaguez Athletics Stadium for a CONCACAF Nations League fixture on Friday (September 6th). The hosts have not been in action since claiming an emphatic 8-0 home win over Anguilla in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier in June 2024.

Jeremy de Leon and Roberto Ydrach scored first half goals to give them a 2-0 lead at the break. De Leon completed his brace along with Wilfredo Rivera in the second half, while Nicolas Cardona, Darren Rios and Leandro Antonetti also scored a goal each in the rout.

Haiti, meanwhile, claimed a 3-1 away win over Barbados in a World Cup qualifier in June. They were two goals up at halftime courtesy of goals from Louicius Deedson and Duke Lacroix. Niall Reid-Stephen halved the deficit in the 73rd minute before Bryan Labissiere wrapped up proceedings in the 84th minute.

Puerto Rico vs Haiti Prediction

Puerto Rico's games have been high-scoring in recent times. However, they have a losing record in this fixture and are yet to register even a draw.

Haiti, for their part, have a 100 per cent record in head-to-head games against their hosts. They will be expected to keep this winning run going and are the pre-game favorites despite playing away from home. Sébastien Migné's side have lost just one of their last seven games, with four games ending in a draw.

We are backing the visitors to claim a comfortable victory with goals at both ends.

Prediction: Puerto Rico 1-3 Haiti
