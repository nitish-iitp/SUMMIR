Australia and Palestine, who have both already qualified for round three of the Asian FIFA World Cup qualifiers, are set to match up in the final game in Group I.

The hosts have won all five of their group matches, while the visitors secured their place in round three for the first time in their history with a draw in their last game.

Australia have been one of the best-performing sides in the Asian World Cup qualifying so far; they are one of just four teams to have taken maximum points up until this point and are yet to concede in any of their five outings.

They will be looking to continue that streak in the coming game against Palestine to carry their momentum into round three and ensure they qualify for their sixth successive FIFA World Cup finals.

Graham Arnold's side have only lost on one occasion in the last 12 matches, falling to a 2-1 defeat in extra time against South Korea in the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup, while they last lost in normal time against England in October.

The hosts have beaten Palestine in each of the last two meetings, including a narrow 1-0 win in the reverse fixture, and have now gone over a year unbeaten when playing at home, leaving them with plenty of confidence ahead of this one.

Their opponents will also be coming into this one in good spirits following a series of history-making achievements in an extremely emotional year for their country.

Palestine had already created history earlier this year when they made a first-ever appearance in the knockout rounds of the Asian Cup, where they were defeated in the round of 16 by eventual winners and hosts Qatar.

Makram Daboub's men followed that up by securing their place in round three of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time in their history thanks to two wins and two draws from their five fixtures in Group I.

They went into their game against Lebanon needing only a draw to progress, and they got exactly what they desired as the game finished 0-0 after 90 minutes.

Australia may be without Ajdin Hrustic for this game after the midfielder was forced off early in the first half of their 2-0 win against Bangladesh due to an injury.

Joshua Nisbet replaced him in the middle of the park in that game, and the Central Coast Mariners star is expected to start in his place in this one.

Outside of that change, Arnold could name the same 11 that dominated in their last outing as he looks for his side to continue their unbeaten run into round three of qualifying.

As for the visitors, Amid Mahajna could make a return to the side after serving a suspension in their previous match having been sent off for an accumulation of yellow cards in the win over Bangladesh in March.

Oday Dabbagh has scored three of Palestine's six goals in the group and the striker is expected to lead the line once again against Australia.


Australia possible starting lineup:
Gauci; Strain, Souttar, Rowles, Bos; Metcalfe, Irvine, Nisbet; Irankunda, Yengi, Duke

Palestine possible starting lineup:
Hamada; Al Battat, Termanini, Mahajna, Khalil; Seyam, Kharoub, Jaber, Cantillana; Abou Ali, Dabbagh



We say: Australia 1-0 Palestine

Palestine gave Australia a tough time in the last meeting between the two with Arnold's side narrowly winning that game, and we expect this match will play out in a similar fashion.

The hosts are undefeated at home since a 2-1 loss to Ecuador in March 2023, and we expect them to continue their home form with a victory here.
