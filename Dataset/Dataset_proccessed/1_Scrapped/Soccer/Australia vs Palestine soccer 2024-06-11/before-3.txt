<image:caption>The island is considered part of Massachusetts, and is separated by a bay that for the most part is US property.

<image:caption>'Choosing a favourite photograph is like choosing a favourite child,' Donn says. But one shot that stands out is 'Broadway Boogie Woogie' (above), taken over Times Square. Explaining the meaning behind the shot, Donn says: 'From above, the scene was nothing short of enchanting: a radiant web of stories, dreams, and ceaseless movement. Out of the doorless helicopter from about 2,500 feet, I realised how lucky I was to have the opportunity for this rare view. And, for a few seconds, I forgot the camera and my purpose for the flight'</image:caption>

<image:caption>In creating his aerial art, Donn says: 'I tend to shoot straight down as I'm always looking for symmetry, patterns, and colour; images that, when seen from high above, often take on a completely different identity from what they are on the ground.’ An example of this is 'Feathered' (above) - an aerial image of containers taken over London</image:caption>

<image:caption>Before a flight, Donn makes sure that all of his equipment 'is in perfect working order'.

<image:caption>Donn says 'Xylophones' (pictured) in his ‘Points of View’ collection has become one of his most 'iconic images'. While flying over the Port of Los Angeles in 2016, Donn says: ‘I spotted six symmetrically positioned horizontal rows of shipping containers that looked like the tonal bars on a musical xylophone. I got very excited to then see a single white semi-tractor trailer driving along the road between the rows. Getting the pilot to quickly manoeuvre me into position to take the shot, I accomplished it only seconds before the truck had moved’</image:caption>

<image:caption>Michael and Teresa Lye paid £24,000 for the property almost 40 years ago and it has since become one of the most famous homes in the area. However, residents of Downham now believe it is time the ivy got the chop</image:caption>

<image:caption>Originally, when the houses were built in the late 1920s, other homes were covered in Virginia Creeper. But over the years owners have opted to remove the plant with the exception of the Lyes where the plant has since consumed the entire brickwork</image:caption>

<image:caption>Mark Philpot (pictured), 59, said he thought the property looked strange among all the other more brutal homes. He joked: 'It probably attracts a load of bugs! I think something like that probably would look nice in a little village but it's a bit out of place in Downham as it's very concrete'</image:caption>

<image:caption>In 2022, Mr and Mrs Lye (pictured) told MailOnline that the gargantuan plant that encases their home had 'accidentally' helped insulate their home during the cost of living crisis</image:caption>

<image:caption>Even two years ago the house still attracted attention from passersbys. Mr Lye said: 'Every week, somebody will stop. 'There was a lady out there the other day. I said, 'It's a pound a picture'. She said, "What?!" I said, 'I'm only joking, don't worry'</image:caption>

<image:caption>Virginia creeper is also known as five-leaved ivy and is an aggressive deciduous climbing plant. While it is not advised to grow ivy on houses, Virginia Creeper is less likely to damage brickwork. However there are some setbacks to allowing it to grow rampantly</image:caption>

<image:caption>Another local said: 'It's not my thing, green just isn't my colour. To be honest I think that look is more laziness than planned. I've been here 26 years and it has always been like that - it's definitely not my sort of look though'</image:caption>

<image:caption>Neighbour Eric Sands, 90, has a long affiliation with the area and says he wasn't keen, but he did sympathise with the Lyes. He said: 'My family moved here 88 years ago and all the time I've been an old man it's been like that'</image:caption>
