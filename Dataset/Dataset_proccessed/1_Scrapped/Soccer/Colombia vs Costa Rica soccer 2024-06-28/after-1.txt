TELL ME MORE

A first-half penalty kick from Luis Diaz set the tone as Colombia blanked Costa Rica 3-0 Friday night in Group D of the Copa America.

The strike from their star winger handed them an early 1-0 lead 31 minutes into the match, but the floodgates opened in the final 45 minutes.

A 59th-minute header from ex-Tottenham defender Davinson Sanchez gave them the double, but the third arrived via Jhon Cordoba. A precision lofted through ball from James Rodriguez placed the it on a platter for the forward, and he made no mistake as he fired past the goalkeeper.

With the result, Colombia have confirmed their spot in the knockout stage of Copa America 2024. A win or draw against Brazil on matchday three would affirm that they finish top of their group.

THE MVP

After a brilliant first game, Diaz was finally rewarded with his first goal of the tournament. The Liverpool superstar notched the opener from the penalty spot, and was a menace for the Ticos all night.

He was lively from the start, creating chances and opportunity in the final-third. A deserved MOTM performance.

THE BIG LOSER

Brazil:

If the Selecao want to top Group D, they now will have to win-out through the remainder of the Group Stage. That means their matchday three showdown with Colombia could be massive.

Colombia's victory Friday night puts all the pressure on Vinicius Jr. and Co., who now cannot afford to falter in their final two group stage matches.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Los Cafeteros will round-out the Group Stage against Brazil and Vinicius Jr. Tuesday. The blockbuster affair will likely determine who tops the group and who takes second.
