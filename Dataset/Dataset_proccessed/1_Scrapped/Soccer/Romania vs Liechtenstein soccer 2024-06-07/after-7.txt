We preview the UEFA Euro 2024 groups, looking at the key stories from our predictions ahead of the tournament in Germany.

Euro 2024 is finally here, with the tournament the first to be held in Germany since 1988. The 17th edition of the European Championship will see 24 teams battle it out across 51 matches to determine the winner of the Henri Delaunay Trophy in Berlin’s Olympiastadion on 14 July.

The group stage will compromise six groups, each featuring four teams. Sixteen of those sides will make it through to the knockout stage, with first and second place sides in each group qualifying for the last 16, as well as the four best teams to finish third.

There are 10 German cities hosting matches at Euro 2024, with Berlin, Munich, Dortmund, Stuttgart, Gelsenkirchen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Cologne and Leipzig all welcoming national teams across June and July.

After England lost the Euro 2020 final at Wembley Stadium on penalties against Italy, Gareth Southgate’s side have been made Euro 2024 favourites by the Opta supercomputer before a ball is kicked, while the Italians will hope to retain their title this summer.

Cristiano Ronaldo will look to add to his already record-breaking goal tally at the European Championship, while new Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappé will be looking to help France win their first Euros title since 2000.

We’ll be providing unique data-led content all throughout the tournament, including covering the big questions ahead of the Euro 2024 groups:

Can England win their first major trophy since the 1966 FIFA World Cup after finishing as runners-up at Euro 2020?
Will Italy become the first nation to retain the European Championship since Spain in 2012?
Can Germany become the first host nation to win the Euros since France in 1984?
Could one of the outsiders win the tournament against all the odds, like Greece in 2004?

Ahead of kick-off on 14 June in Munich when hosts Germany face Scotland, we look at our via our esteemed Opta supercomputer’s Euro 2024 predictions for progression from each of the groups into the last 16, as well as each team’s chances of advancing to the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.
