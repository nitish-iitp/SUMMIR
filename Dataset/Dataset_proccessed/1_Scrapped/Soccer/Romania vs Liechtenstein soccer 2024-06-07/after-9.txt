Euro 2024 Fantasy team previews: Romania
AVFC82
41 CommentsSHARE

Our Euro 2024 Fantasy team previews continue with a profile of Romania.

In these country-by-country guides, we’ll be looking at the best players from each nation, taking a stab at predicted line-ups, reviewing the road to Germany and more.

To do this, we’ll be calling on the help of correspondents from each nation.

Here, we hear from Fantasy Football Scout user Ovidiu Lucian (aka ovy_009 on X).

A recent addition to these team previews is a Premium Members section detailing the official Opta data from Euro ’24 qualification. This data has just arrived in our Members Area, so sign up today to gain access to the all-important stats you need for this summer’s Euro Fantasy game.

All prices given are from the official Fantasy Euro 2024 game.

THE ROAD TO QUALIFICATION
Pos	Team	P	W	D	L	GF	GA	Diff	Pts
1	Romania	10	6	4	0	16	5	+11	22
2	Switzerland	10	4	5	1	22	11	+11	17
3	Israel	10	4	3	3	11	11	0	15
4	Belarus	10	3	3	4	9	14	-5	12
5	Kosovo	10	2	5	3	10	10	0	11
6	Andorra	10	0	2	8	3	20	-17	2

To many people’s surprise, Romania topped their qualifying group by five points.

They finished the campaign unbeaten, winning six and drawing four, and secured their place at Euro 2024 after a 2-1 win against Israel last year. A few days later, they clinched top spot, courtesy of a 1-0 victory over second-placed Switzerland at the National Arena in Bucharest.

Romania’s defence was particularly impressive during qualifying.

Led by Tottenham Hotspur centre-back Radu Dragusin (€4.5m), they conceded just five goals in 10 games, while keeping six clean sheets.

In fact, only six teams had a better defensive record than Romania in Euro 2024 qualifying, highlighting their resilience at the back.

Meanwhile, Romania’s competition for second spot in Group E – which Belgium will likely win – comes from Slovakia and Ukraine.

QUALIFICATION IN NUMBERS
Most starts: Andrei Burca, Radu Dragusin, Nicolae Stanciu (10)
Most goals: Nicolae Stanciu, Denis Alibec, Valentin Mihaila (3)
Most assists: Olimpiu Morutan (4), Ianis Hagi, Razvan Marin (2)
Clean sheets: 6 from 10

RECORD SINCE QUALIFYING
Date	Competition	Opposition	Result	Score	Goalscorers	Assists
22 March	Friendly	Northern Ireland (h)	D	1-1	Man	
26 March	Friendly	Colombia (n)	L	2-3	Hagi, Tanase	Man
4 June	Friendly	Bulgaria (h)	D	0-0		
7 June	Friendly	Liechtenstein	D	0-0		

Romania have failed to win any of their friendlies since qualifying for Euro 2024.

Last week, they failed to score a single goal against either Bulgaria or Liechtenstein, with both matches ending 0-0.

That’s despite racking up 35 shots on goal in the latter fixture, with 12 on target.

However, Romania lack a prolific goalscorer, something which was sometimes apparent in qualifying – they failed to score against Kosovo or Belarus away from home.

04/06/2024 – Bulgaria (h)

(4-2-3-1): Nita; Ratiu, Dragusin, Rus (Nedelcearu 69), Bancu (Mogos 69); R Marin, M Marin (Hagi 61); Man, Stanciu (Olaru 77), Mihaila (Coman 61); Dragus (Birligea 61)

Don't think so and bull's blood is at a premium also due to the large population of vampires. I'm not sure if you'd like it!

Frimpong benched. I think Dumfries could be the play - surprisingly under the radar

It's only Germany v Scotland where we can make transfers after seeing the lineup. No transfers during the matchday

rumours of TAA playing next to rice, so Bellingham might actually get the CAM role? tempted now

You can tell from the friendlies that Bellingham will be CAM with a no. 6 next to Rice. Just not clear who the 6 is, and whether its Foden out left or not

18yo Kilicsoy getting a chance up top for Turkey tonight. Targeting that Georgia fixture becoming quite a headache

My last changes revolve around a Turkey striker and my latest draft is just to not bother (Calanoglu only).
Weirdly just read a bit about Kilicsoy on the Guardian deep dive which I like
https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2024/jun/10/euro-2024-complete-guide-to-all-622-players
and which must take an age to compile (I did not read them all, but skimmed about 50 or so).

Vida owns a pig farm, and Baumgartner makes a mean cappuccino...
