Malaysia have never beaten Jordan before

Malaysia and Jordan lock horns at the Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah, Qatar for their opening game in Group E of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

At 130th, Malaysia are one of the lowest-ranked sides competing at the tournament and have qualified for the first time since the 2007 edition.

Despite this, the Malayan Tigers will feel confident of their chances given their strong run. In their last 11 games, the ASEAN outfit have lost just once, while having won seven times, but in their friendly game with Syria last week, Malaysia were held to a 2-2 draw.

Head coach Kim Pan-gon has called up 26 players for the Asian Cup, including key forward Safawi Rasid, who has scored 20 goals in 58 games for the side. Goalkeeper Azri Ghani and forward Romel Morales are the only two uncapped players in the side.

Jordan will be making their fifth appearance in the cup, and a fourth in a row. The mood in the camp will be a tense one as Japan thrashed them 6-1 in a friendly game on Tuesday.

It was the third defeat of their last four international games, and the Chivalrous Ones have now won just one of their last nine games. Such a below-par form is now a cause of concern for head coach Hussein Ammouta, who has called up 27 players for the Qatar showpiece.

Malaysia vs Jordan Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been five previous games between the sides, with Jordan going unbeaten in all of them, winning thrice.
Malaysia have never scored against Jordan, drawing a blank in all five fixtures so far.
Jordan beat Malaysia 4-0 in their last clash on October 2021, which is also the only clash in this fixture's history that has produced more than one goal.

Malaysia have lost just one of their last 11 games, winning seven.
Malaysia vs Jordan Prediction

Given Jordan's appalling defensive form at the moment, Malaysia could end their scoreless run against the side and finally find the back of the net, but the Chivalrous Ones have enough to secure a draw.

Prediction: Malaysia 1-1 Jordan
