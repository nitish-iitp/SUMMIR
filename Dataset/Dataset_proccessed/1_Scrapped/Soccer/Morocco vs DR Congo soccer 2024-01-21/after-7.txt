TELL ME MORE

Morocco looked set to seal a second straight win at the 2023 AFCON and progress to the next round after they took the lead just six minutes in. Hakim Ziyech's corner came sailing deep into the DR Congo box and Achraf Hakimi read it perfectly before brilliantly knocking a first-time volley through the crowd and into the net.

DR Congo had the opportunity to pull level when they were given a penalty late in the half, but Cedric Bakambu's effort struck the post. The Leopards refused to give up after that upset, as they were the better team in the second half, and their persistence paid off when Silas Katompa Mvumpa latched onto Meschack Elia's low cross and fired in the equaliser.

The draw leaves Morocco on four points after two matches, while DR Congo now have two to their name in Group F and will also be eyeing a spot in the next round.

THE MVP

Bringing Silas on in the 64th minute proved a masterstroke by coach Sebastien Desabre. The Stuttgart attacker was a big threat as Congo pushed for the equaliser and eventually delivered in the 76th minute. More than that, though, he fought hard for the ball and was constantly looking for a way to threaten the Morocco back line.

THE BIG LOSER

He will be left wondering what might have been had he managed to convert his penalty near the end of the first half, but Bakambu's performance overall was rather poor. His passing was woeful, he had a tough time getting into space and he was hardly a real threat for most of the match.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Morocco will look to recover from Sunday's slip up when they take on Zambia in their last game of the group stage on January 24. DR Congo, on the other hand, will hope to get their first win when they face Tanzania on the same day.
