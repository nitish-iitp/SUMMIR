The Assistant Coach of Sudan, Ignatius Osei Fosu, has expressed his displeasure over the poor state of the pitch that was given to them by the Ghana Football Association (GFA) to train on ahead of their game with the Black Stars.

According to him, the St. Thomas Aquinas pitch that was assigned to them for training was not in good condition, thereby complicating their training session.

Ignatius expressed his disappointment in the Ghanaian sporting authorities for the training pitch they were given and added that they expected a pitch that was close to the one at the Accra Sports Stadium.

“Preparations have not been bad, but our only problem is the training pitch. It hasn’t been the best, but we will take it like that. We have not trained at the Accra Sports Stadium yet, but what we were given at St. Thomas Aquinas is not good,” he said during a pre-match press conference on October 9, 2024, as shared by JoySports on X.

It is worth noting that both the Sudan head coach, James Kwasi Appiah and Ignatius Fosu are Ghanaians.

Ghana will play Sudan on October 10, 2024, at the Accra Sports Stadium.

The Black Stars' doubleheader against Sudan will have a major impact on Ghana’s chances of qualifying for the 2025 AFCON after failing to win their first two games.

Ghana occupy the third position with one point in Group F of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers after two matches.
