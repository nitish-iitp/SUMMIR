Kurt Okraku is the President of the Ghana Football Association (GFA)

The President of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), Kurt Okraku, has called on the Black Stars players to play to their utmost best as they come up against Sudan in the 2025 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers.

In a meeting with the players ahead of the game, Okraku entreated them to deliver their best performances in what seems to be a must-win match for the Black Stars if they want to sail through the qualifying phase.

He warned that players who fail to impress risk not being called up to the Black Stars, as he had informed head coach Otto Addo about it.

Ghana will play Sudan on October 10, 2024, at the Accra Sports Stadium.

The Black Stars' doubleheader against Sudan will have a major impact on Ghana’s chances of qualifying for the 2025 AFCON after failing to win their first two games.

Ghana occupy the third position with one point in Group F of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers after two matches.

Angola lead the group with six points, followed by Sudan with three points, while Niger lies at the bottom with one point.

Here are the five things Kurt Okraku said when he met the Black Stars players:

1. Commitment: It is either you are with this family, or you are out. I swear by my life, if you are out of this family, Ghana will never be represented by ten men, never.

2. Risk selection: The minimum I expect is a team of men who show passion and desire to play. I told the coach, it is either you decide to play for Ghana, or decide you will not, then you will not be selected.

3. Lack of passion: Four or five of the players in that [Niger] squad can’t play in my club. But Ghana played 1-1 against Niger. What did we see? We saw a Black Stars team without energy, passion, and desire.

4. Team spirit: I hope this will be the last day I will have to appeal before all of you. Not only to appeal to your hearts but to your conscience about who we are and the fact that we are Ghanaians. The indomitable spirit of the Black Stars can only be resurrected by men with one vision, focus, and love for the nation.

5. No player is untouchable: When Kudus, you were not born; this team existed. When Alex [Djiku], you were not born; this team called the Black Stars existed. It is important for us to remember we belong to a privileged group.
