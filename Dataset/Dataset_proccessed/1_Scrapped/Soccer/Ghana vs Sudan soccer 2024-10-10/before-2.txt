The Ghana Football Association (GFA) has announced four Black Stars players have dropout and will miss the Ghana v Sudan match.

The four include Arsenal star Thomas Partey.

A statement by the Kurt Okraku-led GFA outlined exactly why Partey, Joseph Painstil, Kingsley Schindler, and Osman Ibrahim dropped out of Otto Addo’s 25-man squad for the 2025 TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sudan. See it below:

Thomas Partey

Thomas is unable to join the Black stars due to medical issues he is currently experiencing, and his club has scheduled him for further tests in the coming days.

Joseph Paintsil

He experienced some pain in his hamstrings during their last game on Saturday, October 5. His club doctors have scheduled him for an MRI on Monday, 7th October. He is therefore unavailable to join the Black stars.

Osman Ibrahim

Experienced pain in his calf muscles during their last game and was substituted in the 65th minute. His club has since communicated his unavailability to the Ghana Football Association.

Kingsley Schindler

The player is unable to join the Black Stars due to a medical emergency he's currently receiving treatment for.

The Ghana Black Stars will host Sudan’s Falcons of Jediane in Accra at the Ohene Gyan Sports Stadium on Thursday, October 10, 2024, then head to Libya to play Sudan again at the Martyrs of February Stadium for the Matchday 4 encounter on Tuesday, October 15.

In Group F, Ghana is in third place, having secured one point after a 1-0 loss to Angola in their opening match and a 1-1 draw with Niger.

Meanwhile, with Thomas Partey away, reports indicate Jordan Ayew may lead the Black Stars against the Falcons of Jediane on Thursday.

Coach Otto Addo is set to address the press today, October 9, at 5PM at the Accra (Ohene Gyan) Sports Stadium's conference room, ahead of the game.
