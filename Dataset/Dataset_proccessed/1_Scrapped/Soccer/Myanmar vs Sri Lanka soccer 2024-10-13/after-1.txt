Myanmar and Sri Lanka men’s national football teams met for the second time this month in a FIFA friendly match at the Thuwunna Youth Training Centre, Yangon yesterday. After a competitive 90 minutes, the game ended in a goalless draw, with both teams showcasing solid defensive performances. The result marked a stark contrast to their previous encounter earlier in the month, where Myanmar triumphed with a 2-0 victory.
In the first match, Myanmar’s attack had proven too strong for the Sri Lankan defence, with two well-taken goals sealing a comfortable win. However, this time around, Sri Lanka made noticeable improvements, especially with their defensive style, successfully shutting down Myanmar’s key attacking threats. Myanmar, despite having home advantage and controlling much of the possession, struggled to break down Sri Lanka’s compact backline.
Both teams created a few opportunities in the first half, but the finishing lacked precision on both sides. Myanmar’s forwards, who were instrumental in their previous win, found themselves frustrated by Sri Lanka’s resilient defence. In the second half, Sri Lanka’s counter-attacks also failed to yield any significant chances, as Myanmar’s defence held firm.
The two teams leave the month with contrasting results, Myanmar having the satisfaction of an earlier victory but unable to find the winning edge in this second encounter, while Sri Lanka can take pride in their improved performance after the 2-0 defeat in their first meeting. This latest draw will provide valuable lessons for both sides as they continue to prepare for future international fixtures.
Among the spectators at the friendly match were Union Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs U Min Thein Zan, Yangon Region Chief Minister U Soe Thein, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar Ms Prabashini Ponnamperuma, Myanmar Football Federation President U Zaw Zaw and guests. — KZL
