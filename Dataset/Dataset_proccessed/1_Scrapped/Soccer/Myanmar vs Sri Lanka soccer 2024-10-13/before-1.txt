COURTESY OF JACOB TOBEY

One Sandwich resident has made it to the big league. Jacob R. Tobey started his new role as the play-by-play announcer for the San Antonio Spurs on Monday, October 7.

Mr. Tobey’s love of broadcasting began when he was young. He idolized Celtics announcer Mike Gorman as a child and he even got to meet him during his journey to the Spurs.
