Sri Lanka keen to erase two-goal deficit against Myanmar today
football
View(s): 146


The Sri Lankan men’s football team will attempt to overturn a 2-0 deficit as they face Myanmar in the second leg of their two-match series at the Thuwanna YTC Stadium in Yangon, starting at 3:00pm today. Ranked 200th in the FIFA rankings, Sri Lanka faces a daunting task against the Myanmar team that is ranked 167th.

The first leg of the series, held on Thursday, saw Myanmar take a strong lead with goals from Lwin Moe Aung and Maung Maung Lwin. The Sri Lankan team struggled throughout the match, unable to capitalise on their few scoring opportunities. Despite a spirited effort, they were unable to find the back of the net, leaving them with substantial work to do in today’s match.

Sri Lanka was overwhelmed by a strong Myanmar outfit on Thursday by 2-0 in Yangon, and today's encounter will be crucial for the visitors if they seek to bounce back in the two-match FIFA International Friendly series

Sri Lanka’s football history has been challenging, particularly in recent years. Since 2014, they have won only three matches, with just two being official victories. This year, they secured a 2-0 win against Bhutan in a friendly, but prior to that, their last win came in 2019. This long stretch without victories reflects the difficulties the team has faced on the international field.

In comparison, Myanmar has shown more consistency. They have been more competitive in their recent matches, including draws against teams like Syria and a notable 5-0 victory over Brunei. Their squad has more experience, and they will be looking to maintain their supremacy against Sri Lanka, having previously won six out of their seven encounters.

Sri Lanka will need standout performances from players like goalkeeper Sujan Perera, who will be crucial in keeping Myanmar’s attacking threats at bay. Additionally, the offensive trio of Adhavan Rajamohan, Sam Duran, and Oliver Kelaart must find a way to break through Myanmar’s defence and convert chances into goals.

Myanmar, on the other hand, will likely play a balanced game, focusing on maintaining possession and striking when opportunities arise. In particular, Lwin Moe Aung and Maung Maung Lwin, will be key threats as they aim to add to their goal tally.

Both teams’ coaches have had time to analyse their strategies following the first leg. Sri Lanka’s coach Abdullah Al Muraiti will need to instill confidence in his players, emphasising the need for clinical finishing and solid defence. Conversely, Myanmar’s coach Myo Hlaing Win, will focus on capitalising on Sri Lanka’s weaknesses, looking to exploit any defensive lapses.

Before the Sri Lanka football team left for Myanmar, they faced a huge challenge. Three important senior players—Jack Hingert, Jason Thayaparan, and Claudio Kammerknecht—were injured. To fill these gaps, Sri Lanka brought in three Under-20 players — Chalana Chameera, Raul Suresh, and Mohamed Thilham. Chameera made a significant impact in the first leg of the match.

Another notable absence was Dillon de Silva, whose energy was missed by the team, especially during the recent two-legged series against Cambodia. With these changes, Sri Lanka will need to rely on the young talents and adapt quickly to compete effectively against Myanmar.

As Sri Lanka prepares for this uphill battle, they will be eager to turn the tide and secure a much-needed victory. A win could serve as a turning point for the team, reinvigorating their ambitions in international football.

However, facing a confident Myanmar side will undoubtedly make this an intense and competitive match. Fans from both sides will be watching closely to see if Sri Lanka can produce a remarkable comeback or if Myanmar will continue their authority.

Sri Lanka: Sujan Perera (Captain), Harsha Fernando, Chalana Chameera, Mohamed Aman, Kaveesh Fernando, Senal Sandesh, Jude Supan, Mohamed Aakib, Mohamed Mursith, Mohamed Hasmeer, Mohamed Rifkhan, Manaram Perera, Mohamed Thilham, Anujan Rajendram, Waseem Razeek, Oliver Kelaart, Barath Suresh, Adhavan Rajamohan, Sacayaradjy Steven, Leon Perera, Wade Dekkar, Samuel Durrant, Raul Suresh
