The second friendly match between Myanmar’s national football team and Sri Lanka will take place today (4 pm Myanmar Standard Time) at the Thuwunna Youth Training Centre in Yangon.
As part of October’s international break, both teams are playing two friendly matches. In the first match on 10 October, Myanmar secured a 2-0 victory. This was the first friendly of the year for Myanmar, where goals from Lwin Moe Aung and Maung Maung Lwin earned the win.
Although Sri Lanka is ranked lower than Myanmar in the world standings, they have improved their performance with the inclusion of naturalized players. Both teams missed some scoring chances in the first match, and they will aim for better finishing in today’s game.
Myanmar is using these friendly matches in October and November to prepare for the upcoming ASEAN Cup 2024, which will start in the second week of December. — Ko Nyi Lay/KZL
