Antigua face Cayman Islands on Saturday

Cayman Islands welcome Antigua and Barbuda to the Truman Bodden Stadium for a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Saturday (June 8th). The hosts are coming off a 4-0 defeat to Moldova in an international friendly in March.

Vitalie Damascan, Artur Ionita, Ion Nicolaescu and Victor Bogaciuc scored to help the Europeans claim the win in that game.

Antigua and Barbuda, meanwhile, kick-started their World Cup qualifiers with a 1-1 draw at home to Bermuda on Wednesday. Raheem Deterville broke the deadlock for them in the 26th minute before Sachiel Ming drew the game level in the 90th minute.

The draw left The Benna Boys in second place of Group A after one game. This will be the Cayman Islands' first game of the qualifiers.
