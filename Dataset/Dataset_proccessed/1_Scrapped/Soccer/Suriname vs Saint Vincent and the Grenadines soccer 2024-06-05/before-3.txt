Way too many things to post… almost 7 hours there and still didn’t see it all…

Gavrilio Princip’s FN… the actual one that started WW I when he shot the Archduke.

Possibly the ‘bloodiest’ gun in history if one considers its ramifications up to and including today…



More to follow…

BTW… those are some Martin Pegler Photos and I HIGHLY recommend you buy his book “Out of Nowhere.” Along with Gary Yee’s books.

This was new since my last visit…

Interesting concept… and 2000 yard range? Wow!











I wonder what a pinch of tannerite Would do in one of these projectiles?

Ballistic clay after a 12 Gauge buckshot round at close range.



For all those folks who say “a 12 ga. Is a lousy home defense weapon…”

What more do you want?

Special Exhibit called “weapons of mass seduction” on art guns.

Pretty standard gold plated AK



Gold plated and decorated Dragunov variant from one of Saddam’s palaces. Made c.1989



Saudi embellished P7 gifted to a British military attache.



Pakistani (PoF) MP-5 variant presented to a British officer.



FN “Baby Browning serial number 4”. Incredibly complex engraving as showpiece of what can be put on one.



Gold Plated Sterling (fully functional) with ivory grips used by Saudi palace guards in 1980’s.




There were others, but those were the highlights.

Same here. Including a visit to the “basement” so to speak.

And my favorite restaurant in all of UK is right across the canal. Mumtoz. Lime juice and Peshawar Naan. I’d eat there three meals a day!!!

One cool thing I forgot to mention… and it’s always a good day when I learn something… is the origin of the term Drilling.

As in “Drilling rifle.”

I always sort of wondered where the term came from. As it seemed nothing to do with close border marching and while it could create holes… it was not really “that” related to hole punching.

That said… never bothered to look it up.

So Drilling comes from the German word for three — drei. And “drilling”’is the word for Triplett. Three barrels…

As the Drilling was pretty much a German thing, so the name stuck in English.

And now I know. You guys probably knew this all along. (Shakes head sheepishly)

Cheers!

I feel like I may have known that somewhere in the back of my brain because I believe it's also the case with vierlings.
