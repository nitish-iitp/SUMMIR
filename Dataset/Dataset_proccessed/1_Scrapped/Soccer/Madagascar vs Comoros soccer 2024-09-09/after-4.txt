Madagascar and Comoros lock horns at the Honneur Stadium in neutral Morocco on Monday for a clash in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations. The sides have been drawn alongside Tunisia and Gambia in Group A.

Having made their AFCON debut in 2019, Madagascar's quest for a second appearance in the tournament finals took a hit this week when Tunisia inflicted a 1-0 defeat upon them.

Ferjani Sassi struck the only goal of the game in the eighth minute of added time, much to Madagascar's dismay, as their resistance was finally broken. But for the second consecutive game in all competitions, the Barea failed to score a goal.

The result relegated them to the bottom of their group, with their next opponents, the Comoros in third. Les Coelacantes were held to a 1-1 draw by Gambia in their first match. Youssouf M'Changama broke the deadlock for them in the 37th minute before Musa Barrow equalized for the Scorpions nine minutes later.

Madagascar vs Comoros Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been eight clashes between the sides in the past, with Comoros going winless in all of them, losing seven.
The only time Madagascar failed to beat Comoros was in November 2017 when the sides drew 1-1 in a friendly game.
Madagascar and Comoros met as recently as June this year when the former won 2-1 in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying match.
Comoros are winless in their last three official games, having won three of their previous four.
In five official games this year, Madagascar have won twice, including one against Comoros (2-1 in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier).
Madagascar have failed to score in their last two official games: 0-0 vs Mali in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier, and a 1-0 loss vs Tunisia in a 2025 AFCON qualifier.
Madagascar vs Comoros Prediction

Madagascar have a terrific record against Comoros and that should give them a psychological edge here. The Barea have not been at their best of late, but should have enough in the tank to beat the sluggish Coelacanths, who've failed to win their last three official games.

Prediction: Madagascar 2-0 Comoros
