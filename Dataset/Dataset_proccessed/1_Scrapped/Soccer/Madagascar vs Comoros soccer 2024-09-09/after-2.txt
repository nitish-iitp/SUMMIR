Madagascar quest for first win in the AFCON 2025 qualifiers continued after they played out a 1-1 draw against visiting Comoros in their second Group A game on Monday.

Madagascar who narrowly lost 1-0 to Tunisia in their first qualifier game were hoped yo claim the three points against Comoros who were also held to a 1-1 draw in their first game against Gambia.

The host started on an impressive note as they took the game to their visitors as they scored an early goal just nine minutes to the game through a Carolus Andriamatsinoro right footed shot from very close range to the bottom right corner.

Two minutes later Comoros player Faïz Selemani missed a chance that could have leveled matter for his team.

Arnaud Randrianantenaina almost doubled the lead for Madagascar but his right footed shot from the right side of the box was saved in the top centre of the goal.

In the 36th minute, Comoros missed another begging chanve when Myziane Maolida header from the centre of the box skewed the top left corner.

The visitor finally levelled in the 41 minutes as Youssouf M’Changama curled a right footed shot from outside the box to the bottom right corner following a set piece situation.

The result leaves Madagascar at the bottom of Group A with just one points from two games.

Tunisia currently top the group with six points from two games while Comoros are second with two points from two games and the Gambia have one point from two games.
