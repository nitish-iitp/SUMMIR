Madagascar will host Comoros at Stade Olympique Hammadi Agrebi on Monday in a crucial 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match.

Both sides will be aiming to secure their first victory in the qualifiers to boost their chances of making it to the competition.

Madagascar will enter their second match of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers aiming to swiftly recover from a 1-0 defeat to Tunisia in their opening fixture last Thursday.

The Barea were on track for a valuable point until Ferjani Sassi's late goal that came eight minutes into stoppage time shattered Malagasy hopes.

This defeat leaves Romuald Rakotondrabe's side at the bottom of the group, behind Gambia and Comoros, who currently occupy second and third with one point each, while Tunisia leads the group with three points.

Madagascar are seeking a first AFCON qualifying win since 2021, having failed to win during the last edition when they drew three and lost three of the six matches played.

However, the Barea hope to replicate their form from the 2026 World Cup qualification campaign, where they won two of four games, including a 2-1 victory over Monday's opponents, Comoros, in June.

This will be the third time Madagascar hosts Comoros, and in the previous two meetings on Malagasy soil, the home side have emerged victorious.

Meanwhile, Comoros kicked off their AFCON qualifying campaign with a 1-1 draw against Gambia at Stade Ben Ahmed El Abdi last Wednesday.

The Coelacanths took the lead in the 37th minute through Youssouf M'Changama, but they could not hold onto it, conceding a goal in first-half stoppage time to settle for one point.

Stefano Cusin's side failed to qualify for the 2023 edition of the AFCON, finishing third in their group, six points above Lesotho but six behind Zambia and the eventual tournament winners, Ivory Coast.

However, they have enjoyed an impressive World Cup qualifying campaign so far, currently leading their group with nine points after four matches, including one win in two away matches.

The visitors have only appeared at one AFCON tournament, in Cameroon 2021 where they put up a commendable performance for a debutant before being eliminated by the hosts in the round of 16.

After a solid performance in their last match, despite the defeat, Rakotondrabe may opt to keep the same starting XI.

Warren Caddy will likely lead the Madagascar attack with Rayan Raveloson expected to play behind the striker, while Lokomotiv Plovdiv midfielder Johan N'zi and veteran Ibrahim Samuel Amada anchors the midfield.

Red Star Belgrade forward Ben El Fardou, who scored in each of Comoros' last two World Cup qualifiers, started from the bench against Gambia, but he could return to the starting XI for Monday's match.

Myziane Maolida, currently on loan at newly promoted Saudi Pro League side Al-Kholood from Hertha BSC, led Les Coelacantes' attack in the previous game but may make way after failing to score.


Madagascar possible starting lineup:
Laiton; Rabemanantsoa, Fontaine, Demeleon, Fortun; NAmada, N'Zi; Randrianantenaina, Raveloson, Lapoussin; Caddy

Comoros possible starting lineup:
Pandor; Bakari, Omari, M'Dahoma, Abdallah; Said, M'Changama, Bourhane, Mohamed, Selemeni; Maolida



We say: Madagascar 2-1 Comoros

Madagascar put up a commendable performance against a top-tier team in their last match, demonstrating their significant growth as a team, and with a strong home record against Comoros, including a victory against them in June, we believe that the hosts are capable of securing another win against their visitors.
