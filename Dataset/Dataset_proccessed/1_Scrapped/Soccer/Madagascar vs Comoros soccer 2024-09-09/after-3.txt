The African Cup of Nations Qualification encounter between Madagascar and Comoros will take place at Stade Olympique Hammadi Agrebi. The two teams could not secure a win. How will they approach this one?

Madagascar

Madagascar started their AFCON qualifier against Tunisia, and they ended up losing. In that match, Madagascar did well in holding, but a last-minute strike by Ferjani Sassi gave their opponent maximum points. However, Madagascar's recent matches into this saw them win two, lose two, and then play to a draw with Mali.


Comoros

Comoros started their AFCON qualifier with a draw with Gambia. Comoros took the lead in the 37th minute through Youssouf M’Changama’s strike in that encounter. However, this team could not hold well, as Musa Barrow leveled the scores for Gambia before the break. Heading into this game, the visiting team failed to win any of their last three matches, losing to Angola and Mozambique. 


Expert Betting Tips

Madagascar has a point to prove in this game. The home team did an excellent job against Tunisia but will need to do better offensively in this encounter to pick a win. While Comoros are on the road, given their recent performances, they can not be written off. Yet, I expect the home team to edge here, a game that could see both teams net.
