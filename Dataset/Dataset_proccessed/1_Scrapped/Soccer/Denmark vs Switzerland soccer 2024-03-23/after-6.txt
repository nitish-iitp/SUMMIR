CHICAGO FIRE SPORTS SOCCER
Fire to play without Xherdan Shaqiri, which might not be a bad thing
Over four games, Shaqiri hasn’t played a full 90 minutes, and his numbers are underwhelming.

One of the pressing questions surrounding the Fire is whether they are actually better without their best-known player and would-be creative force in the midfield.

Perhaps Saturday will provide a few more clues.

Captain Xherdan Shaqiri will be with the Swiss national team to face Denmark on the same day the Fire (1-2-1, 4 points) visit the Revolution. Shaqiri, who in 2023 earned $8,153,000 in guaranteed compensation, according to the MLS Players Association, has appeared in four World Cups and won every club trophy in Europe worth winning.
