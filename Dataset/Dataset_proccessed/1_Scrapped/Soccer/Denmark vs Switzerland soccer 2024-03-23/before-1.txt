Inter

Inter: but what is this section of the site/blog really about?

The answer is immediate: memories and emotions of the experience to supporting Inter at stadium, all documented with photos and videos :)

They are texts of life lived with accompanying images and videos that allow you to better understand every single word and part of the story! The images are all captured by me as I went through these daily life experiences.

It’s a collection of stadium experiences and goodies to help. Help with what? To excite and remember both those who lived those moments and those who can see them (and try to interpret/understand) through a digital device.

If they are places in which you have already been and/or know, I can imagine that you find yourself in what I describe/photograph/film. In summary, you can review yourself in what you read in every single article :)

Remember to also take a look at the rest of the site/blog where I’m sure you will find lots of other useful information for your possible future trip or a simple vacation or tourist/excursion destinations.

When you start with an article, I then recommend that you deepen the reading with others on the same topic. Why this choice? The answer is simple: get a more complete idea of ​​the topic/place/trip you are reading/seeing. Don’t just have a vague idea, which, as in many aspects of life, never does too well.

Just chat because now it’s time to take a look at the collection of articles from “Inter” and choose the one that interests you most (or that inspires you the most)! :)
