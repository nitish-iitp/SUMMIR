The Canadian men’s national team remained unbeaten in the September international window on Tuesday, holding Mexico off the scoresheet for a 0-0 draw.

Though it was not an evening where the Canadians managed to put the ball in the net, they nonetheless managed a good result. Now, Canada are actually unbeaten in their last three matches against Mexico including both games in 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualifying.

After defeating the United States last weekend, Canada boss Jesse Marsch made just a few changes to his side. He started Richie Laryea at right-back after Alistair Johnston’s injury in the prior game, and added Jonathan Osorio to his midfield, also playing Liam Millar up front with Jonathan David dropping to the bench.

Dayne St. Clair also got the nod in goal for his third start under Marsch, taking over after Maxime Crépeau’s strong outing last time.

It was largely an uneventful first half, from an attacking perspective at least. Mexico had a clear game plan to disrupt the Canadians’ rhythm and prevent them from pressing in the way they had against the United States.

The Mexicans committed 13 fouls in the first half to Canada’s six, earning two early yellow cards; every time the Canadians moved forward, especially through the more congested midfield areas, they found themselves cut down cynically.

As a result, it was difficult for Canada to put together any extensive attacking patterns and connect into the penalty area; their 55 per cent first-half possession resulted in three shots and just eight touches in the box. Although they largely kept Mexico away from any serious opportunities in the Canadian half, Marsch’s side was still frustrated by the stop-start, disjointed game.

With neither side finding any breathing room in the physical, congested midfield, it was Canada who chose to blink first and turn to the bench. Marsch brought David into the game in place of Mathieu Choinière, adding another talented attacking option to try and create numerical advantages in the final third.

The match ultimately had very little in it. Neither side was able to string more than a couple of passes together in a way that would carry them up the pitch, with space closing very quickly.

Perhaps the most noteworthy positive of the second half for Canada was Niko Sigur’s introduction in the 77th minute; the Hajduk Split midfielder made his senior international debut after recently committing to represent Les Rouges.

Despite a handful of set-pieces at both ends in the final five minutes, though, where the pace of play opened up, neither side ultimately got very close to goal.

In the end, the statistics were fairly even; the possession ended just barely in Mexico’s favour, and they had an advantage in shots (10 to five), but still Canada rarely felt threatened. That said, St. Clair was crucial to preserving the clean sheets, making three excellent saves and perhaps putting some doubt into the argument that Crépeau is guaranteed to be Canada’s starter going forward.

Canada thus finished this international window with a pair of positive results against their two biggest Concacaf rivals; although their win over the United States was more convincing, and they might be disappointed not to have scored against Mexico, they did well not to roll over when provoked on Tuesday.

The latest version of Les Rouges under Marsch looks like it has serious ambitions of not only rising to the top of Concacaf but progressing farther than that; proving they can go toe-to-toe with the heavyweights of the region was a very important step toward getting there.

CanPL.ca Player of the Match

Ali Ahmed, Canada

The Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder has had an outstanding couple of games this window, looking at home in a very difficult physical affair. Ahmed had two successful dribbles and won eight out of 12 duels, including both of his attempts in the air. He won two fouls as well in a very challenging night in the middle of the park.

What’s Next?

Canada’s next game will be on Oct. 15, when they’ll take on Panama in a friendly at home at Toronto’s BMO Field.
