Black Stars head coach Otto Addo

Coach Otto Addo has expressed his confidence in the Black Stars' ability to beat Angola in their first match of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers.

At a press conference ahead of the game against Angola in Kumasi, the coach listed several talented players that the opponents possess, which could threaten Ghana’s hopes for a strong start in the qualifiers.

However, the coach quickly stated that after assessing the qualities of both sides, the Black Stars are more capable of defeating Angola.

“They have a lot of good players, so it won’t be easy for us, but we have good players as well, and I am convinced that we can beat them, even though it won’t be easy,” Otto Addo said at the presser on Wednesday, September 4, 2024.

Although the squad has been hampered by the absence of some key players due to injury, Otto Addo stated that he believes the current team is ready for the game on Thursday, September 5, 2024.

“We have had some injuries, but the squad is ready. We have a lot of players who can match up. I wish the injured players a speedy recovery,” the coach said.

The Black Stars will open their 2025 AFCON qualifiers against Angola at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium in Kumasi.
