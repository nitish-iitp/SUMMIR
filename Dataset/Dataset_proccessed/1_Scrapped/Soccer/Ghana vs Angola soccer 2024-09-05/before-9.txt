Former Kenyan International Taiwo Atieno Calls For Rebranding of Football Federation And National Team
 September 04, 2024

By Samuel Ouma

Taiwo Atieno

Former Kenyan footballer Taiwo Atieno has called for a comprehensive rebranding of the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) and the national team, Harambee Stars.

According to Taiwo, the goal of this rebrand is not only to refresh the visual identity of these organizations but also to remodel their infrastructure to encourage economic growth and unite Kenya's rich cultural diversity through football.

In a statement, Atieno highlighted the critical need for Kenyan football to undergo a strategic transition. He stated that since being appointed Commercial Director in November 2021, he has spoken with club owners, CEOs, and industry experts. A common theme in these meetings has been the urgent need to decentralize football activity beyond Nairobi.

He stated that the capital city's domination in football has resulted in a dwindling fan base for local teams despite rising interest in international football, particularly the English Premier League.

“In 2009, 75,000 fans supported Harambee Stars, but by 2024, fewer than 10,000 attend. This is concerning, as Kenya’s population of 55 million—with 75% under 35—represents tremendous untapped football talent and fan base,” said Atieno.

The 39-year-old ex-striker noted that Kenya's football sector has the potential to earn between $176 million and $308 million per year, accounting for 0.16% to 0.28% of national GDP—figures comparable to leading African football nations.

Furthermore, he highlighted Harambee Stars' potential market value, estimating between $80 million and $300 million.

The suggested rebranding approach for FKF and Harambee Stars is complex, addressing more than just aesthetics. Atieno identified several key components that will determine this change. They include the logo and visual identity, training facilities, headquarters, personalities and ideals, storytelling, and consistent branding.

He also underscored the critical role of the Kenyan diaspora in this transition. With yearly remittances of $4 billion, he believes the diaspora is well-positioned to help with the rebranding drive by investing, sharing skills, and forging international collaborations.
