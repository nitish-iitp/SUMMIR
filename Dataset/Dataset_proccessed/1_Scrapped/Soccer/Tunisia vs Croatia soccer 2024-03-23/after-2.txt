BACK IN THE SQUAD—Gabadinho
SHARE

By Mabvuto Kambuwe in Durban, South Africa:

Malawi National Football Team, the Flames will be looking to throw caution to the wind and go flat out when they face Kenya in a Four Nations Tournament in front of the home crowd at Bingu National Stadium this evening.

This is the official opening match of the tournament which has hosts Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.

Meetings between the Flames and Harambee Stars have been rare in the last five years.

The last time the two teams met was in 2018 in which the Harambee Stars defeated Malawi 1-0 in Nairobi, Kenya.

However, the Flames have dominated matches against Kenya having won four, drawn four and lost twice in the last 10 fixtures.

And this evening, the Flames will bank on home advantage to start the tournament with a victory. The winner in this tie will progress to the final to face either Zimbabwe or Zambia slated for Tuesday at the same venue.

The losers will also meet in another match on the same day.

TO TRY NEW PLAYERS—Mabedi

Flames coach Patrick Mabedi has assembled a strong squad comprising 11 foreign country based players.

Mabedi said the tournament will give him an opportunity to prepare for the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers in June this year.

“The tournament is very important as we are trying different combinations. As you know, we already have a team but it is still under construction. It is also a good opportunity for us to get some new players who can be part of the project,” Mabedi said.

For the first time, Mabedi has also included Henri Kumwenda of Butler University, US, Takondwa Maosa of regional league side Brentwood Town FC AND Jubril Odedina of Cambridge United, UK.

Moroka Swallows striker Gabadinho Mhango has also returned to the Flames fold after missing two World Cup qualifiers against Liberia and Tunisia in November last year.

Chawanangwa Kaonga, who also missed the games due to injury, is back with the team.

Mabedi has a pool of talent at his disposal which might give him a selection headache ahead of this evening’s match.

On the part of Kenya, they have also assembled a strong squad for the tournament.

Coach Engin Firat has blended the squad with local and internationally based players.

Captain Michael Olunga, Ayub Timbe, Richard Odada and Eric Akumu have travelled to Malawi.

In an early kick off, it will be a battle of Zambezi between Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Zambia and Zimbabwe are familiar foes. All the teams are using the match as part of preparations for the World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers.
