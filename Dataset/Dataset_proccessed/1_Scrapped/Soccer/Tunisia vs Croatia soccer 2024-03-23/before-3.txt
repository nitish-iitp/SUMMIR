Adidas has unveiled the latest home and away kits for teams competing in the 2024 Copa America, featuring Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. These kits incorporate bold national colors, innovative patterns, and symbols like the phoenix for Colombia, reflecting each nation's cultural identity. Adidas aims to connect with fans through artistry and innovation, creating jerseys that embody the spirit of the tournament and the unique heritage of each country.

Argentina's 2024 Copa America kits feature a modern design with gold accents on the home kit to celebrate their recent achievements, and a royal blue away kit that symbolizes their prestigious status in international football. The designs incorporate metallic graphics and colors from the national flag, appealing to a new generation of fans.

Colombia's 2024 Copa America kits feature the phoenix as a new symbol, embodying rebirth and transformation. The home kit incorporates phoenix wings along the sides, while the away kit presents a dark base with smoke patterns and vibrant orange details, both reflecting the team's dynamic energy and passion.

Mexico's 2024 Copa America kits are inspired by folk art, embodying the nation's vibrant and playful spirit. The home kit features eagle-inspired patterns symbolizing speed and precision, while the away kit is adorned with a serpent motif from the Mexican coat of arms, representing power and greatness.

Peru's 2024 Copa America kits modernize tradition, with the home kit featuring the iconic red sash against a white base, inspired by the texture of the Peruvian Cajon, an instrument in traditional music. The phrase "Unidos Siempre" unites fans and players, while the away kit reinterprets the red sash with a unique textured pattern, also drawn from the Cajon's aesthetic.
