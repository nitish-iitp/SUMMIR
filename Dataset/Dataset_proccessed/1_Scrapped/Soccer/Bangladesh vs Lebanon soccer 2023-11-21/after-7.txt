In Short
Palestine are taking part in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers
Palestine will face Australia on Tuesday
Palestine drew their match against Lebanon

Palestine coach Makram Daboub said the players have been in constant touch with their families back home amidst their campaign in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. The situation in Gaza has deteriorated to the extent that three of the players from the squad were unable to get out of there for a training camp in Jordan.

Daboub said that the players in the squad have found it tough to concentrate on their game at a time when Palestine is facing turbulent times.

“The players are in the hotel or on the bus most of the time following the news on their phones and communicating with their families. They are in a constant state of anxiety with the continued aggression and war in Palestine,” Daboub was quoted as saying.

Daboub is next set to lock horns with Australia on Tuesday at the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium in Kuwait. A massive crowd is expected to be present at the venue in support of Palestine.

Palestine drew their previous match against Lebanon 0-0, but coach Daboub sounded confident ahead of the match against the Aussies.

“We should have won the game but it is a good point for us. We know that Australia is a strong team and we need to focus on that as best we can,” he added.

Australia coach Graham Arnold also poured his heart out about the worsening situation in Gaza, where the death toll is rising at an alarming rate.

“We’re very sympathetic for everyone with what’s going on. But again, it’s a game of football and that brings a lot of joy to everybody,” he stated.
