Following the conclusion of the AFC Asian Cup, the continent now turns its attention back to FIFA World Cup 26™ qualification. Matchdays 3 and 4 get under way from 21 March, with it all still to play for across the nine groups.

The likes of Qatar, who lifted the Asian Cup last month on home soil, Saudi Arabia and Australia reconvene qualifying looking to maintain their perfect records and secure their spots in the third round. Meanwhile, a number of sides including Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Nepal are aiming to kickstart their campaigns and keep their hopes of progression alive.
