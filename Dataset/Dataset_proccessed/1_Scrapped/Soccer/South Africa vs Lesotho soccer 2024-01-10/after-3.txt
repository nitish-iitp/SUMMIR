The excitement continues to build as the South African senior men’s team steps up preparations ahead of the start of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Ivory Coast in the coming days.

Bafana Bafana play a training match against Lesotho behind closed doors at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville on Wednesday (10 January) before departing for Ivory Coast on 11 January 2024. The continental tournament will be held in the West African country from 13 January to 11 February 2024.

The past few days have been a whirlwind of activity in two provinces (Gauteng and in the Western Cape) and the four- day pre-camp in the winelands, in Steelnbosch, was exactly the calm and quiet that coach Hugo Broos and his charges needed to get their game plan going.

Percy Tau, Grant Kekana, Oswin Appollis and Stellies’ pride Jayden Adams addressed the media on Monday at the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport (SAS) with their eye very much on the Afcon.

“For me it’s a pleasure to represent my home, which is Stellenbosch, and also my club Stellies. It’s an honour now to join the national team and represent my country,” said Adams.

“The younger members of the team are finding their place well, and are fully included. I think the onus is on us experienced players, who have been around longer, to make them feel part of the team. But to be honest, we are all happy with what we bring to this team, regardless of our ages or experiences,” said Kekana.

Broos was happy with the time spent in the Cape and applauded SAS on their hospitality, ensuring that Bafana Bafana were not left wanting.

The team jetted back to Johannesburg early on Tuesday morning (9 January 2024) to continue preparations, with the game against Lesotho at Lucas Moripe Stadium in mind.

“I have three issues to report on. The first one, our goalkeeper and captain Ronwen Williams is currently being managed by the medical team due to a knee niggle. The second, Themba Zwane took a knock on the knee two days ago and did not fulfill training on Monday. He is also currently receiving treatment. Thirdly, Mothobi Mvala is currently undergoing a scan due to a groin injury. We are awaiting full medical details and will not jump to conclusions on a replacement. For now, Mothobi is still very much a part of this team,” said Broos at the MD-1 press conference on Tuesday as he gave an update on the team ahead of the match against Lesotho.
