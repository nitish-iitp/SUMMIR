DOHA: Jordan have sent record goal-scorer Hamza Al-Dardour home from the Asian Cup after a public bust-up with coach Hussein Ammouta during their last-16 win over Iraq.

Dardour, who has 35 goals for his country, clashed with Ammouta on the sidelines in the dying minutes of the 3-2 win over Iraq in Doha on Monday.

The 32-year-old was shown a red card by the referee despite being an unused substitute.

Jordan said in a statement that Dardour had "violated the team's instructions."
