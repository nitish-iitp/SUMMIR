Venezuela seals top spot in Copa Group B with win over Jamaica
ByReuters
Updated: Jul 1, 2024, 03:43 am

Venezuela hammered Jamaica 3-0 in Arlington, Texas on Sunday to seal top spot in Group B and set up a Copa América quarterfinal with Canada.

Goals from Eduard Bello and Salomon Rondon early in the second half, followed by a late strike from Eric Ramirez, ensured victory for the Venezuelan side.

Venezuela had already booked their spot in the last eight with wins over Ecuador and Mexico and needed just a point against already eliminated Jamaica to clinch top spot and avoid facing defending champions Argentina in the next round.

Bello's powerful downward header put the South Americans in front in the 49th minute and Rondon doubled their lead seven minutes later with a scuffed effort past Jamaica keeper Jahmali Waite.

It was Rondon's 43rd international goal, extending his record as Venezuela's highest scorer.

Ramirez added Venezuela's third on the breakaway in the 85th minute, sending a right-footed shot under the advancing Waite after a well-timed pass from Kervin Andrade.

Venezuela were joined in the last eight by Group B runners-up Ecuador, who qualified thanks to their superior goal difference after holding Mexico 0-0 in the other match, with both teams tied on four points.
