Sri Lanka held Cambodia to a 0-0 draw

Cambodia host Sri Lanka at the Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh on Tuesday for the second leg of their 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers in the playoff round. The tie is finely poised at 0-0 after both teams failed to find the back of the net.

Ranked 205th in the world, the Golden Army sat deep to block all passing lanes for their visitors and frustrate them with a solid defensive display.

Even by their own lowly standards, it was a good performance that will give them some confidence ahead of the deciding leg this week. However, it is imperative for them to find their attacking boots too, as it's been four games since they last found the back of the net.

On the other hand, Cambodia haven't necessarily covered themselves in glory this year either, winning just once in five games, a 2-0 win over Mongolia in a friendly international three months ago. If the Koupreys are to reach the next round of the Asian Cup qualifiers, it is imperative for them to replicate that performance here.

Cambodia vs Sri Lanka Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been only three clashes between the sides in history, with both teams winning once each.
Sri Lanka won their first-ever encounter in March 2001 (1-0 friendly win), before the Koupreys exacted revenge in 2006 with a stunning 4-0 win.
In their last eight official games, Cambodia have won just once: a 2-0 friendly win over Mongolia. The Golden Army are winless in their last three matches, failing to score in each of those games.
The Koupreys are ranked 180th in the world while their opponents are 25 places adrift of them, according to the latest FIFA World Rankings.
Cambodia vs Sri Lanka Prediction

The Koupreys are likely to face resistance here too but will have to up their attacking game at home to stand a chance of progressing against one of the weakest sides in the world.

We expect Cambodia to secure a narrow victory against Sri Lanka.

Prediction: Cambodia 1-0 Sri Lanka
