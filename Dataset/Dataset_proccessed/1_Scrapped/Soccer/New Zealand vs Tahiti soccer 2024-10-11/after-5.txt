Lautoka questions
Yesterday, at around 8.30pm, Fiji’s director of health James Fong said:
“Early today, the patient’s condition began deteriorating. He was moved into an intensive care unit and swabbed for the virus. Barely four hours ago he tested positive for COVID-19. His condition will be discussed more with his family before any public announcement. His described timeline and the recent deterioration in his condition indicate he is likely a late-stage carrier of the virus. So, we suspect that this patient, who is case number 125, transmitted the virus to the doctors, not the other way around.”
What is striking here is that Patient 125 was already dead as Fong spoke of him.
The Fiji Times today quoted the family of the 53-year-old man as saying he had died “late yesterday afternoon.”
As the name of the patient was never disclosed, it is not clear why the fact of death has not been disclosed. In fact, other people in the room last night’s press conference was being held, already knew. What was the public health concern in failing to disclose this?
Leaked photos from the scene at Lautoka Hospital last night as Fong was speaking.
