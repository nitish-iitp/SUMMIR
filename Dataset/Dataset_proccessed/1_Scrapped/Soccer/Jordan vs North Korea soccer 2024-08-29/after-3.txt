Alex Dehelean is one of the key returning players for the Mashpee High School boys’ soccer team this season.

RICH MACLONE/ENTERPRISE

Ascending up the South Shore League boys’ soccer rankings has been an ongoing process over the past few years. Two years ago, the Mashpee High School boys suffered through a winless season where a few draws were the highlight of a tough-to-swallow run through the campaign.

Last year things got better. Not only did the Falcons win five regular season games, but with a challenging schedule they cracked the MIAA state rankings’ top 32 to earn a playoff spot, and won a preliminary round contest before falling to powerhouse Cohasset.
