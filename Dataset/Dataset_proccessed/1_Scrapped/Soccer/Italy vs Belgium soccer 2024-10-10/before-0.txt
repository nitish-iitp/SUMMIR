Italy lineup vs. Belgium: Predicted XI for Azzurri's UEFA Nations League contest

Topping League A Group 2 after securing maximum points last month, Italy will resume their UEFA Nations League campaign on Thursday, when Belgium visit Stadio Olimpico.

Boosted by the recall of Sandro Tonali and a fresh tactical set-up, Luciano Spalletti's side saw off France and Israel in September, prompting the Azzurri's head coach to continue introducing new faces.

AC Milan centre-back Matteo Gabbia has been included, alongside ex-Milan forward Daniel Maldini, now with Serie A strugglers Monza. The latter could follow in the hallowed footsteps of father Paolo Maldini and grandfather Cesare Maldini by earning his first senior cap - though probably from the bench.

While he replaces Lazio captain Mattia Zaccagni in Italy's attacking department, Juventus goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio - sent off in the Champions League last week - has also been given a first call-up, as cover for the injured Alex Meret. Gianluigi Donnarumma's place between the posts is unquestioned.

Roma youngster Niccolo Pisilli was also selected after breaking into the Giallorossi's first team, but Tonali, Nicolo Barella and Manchester City target Samuele Ricci are expected to feature in midfield, with Inter Milan's Davide Frattesi another strong contender.

Liverpool's Federico Chiesa is still short of fitness so was not considered, and with Gianluca Scamacca (ACL) and Fiorentina striker Moise Kean (back) both ruled out by injury, Lorenzo Pellegrini is likely to support Mateo Retegui up front. When Kean withdrew earlier this week, Lorenzo Lucca stepped in, but the Udinese forward is set for a place on the bench.

Spalletti's new 3-5-2 formation offers space for three specialist centre-backs, but as leading defenders Alessandro Buongiorno, Riccardo Calafiori and Alessandro Bastoni are all left-footed they will not be fielded together.

Gabbia or versatile Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo should therefore start on the right; meanwhile, Federico Dimarco and Raoul Bellanova are favourites for selection at wing-back, consigning Destiny Udogie and Andrea Cambiaso to the bench.

Italy possible starting lineup: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori; Bellanova, Barella, Ricci, Tonali, Dimarco; Pellegrini; Retegui
