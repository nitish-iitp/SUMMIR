Preview: Italy vs. Belgium - prediction, team news, lineups

Setting the pace atop League A Group 2 after a superb start in September, Italy will welcome Belgium to Rome for a UEFA Nations League contest on Thursday.

While the Azzurri secured maximum points last month, the Red Devils were castigated by their own captain following another dismal defeat to France.

After making a tame defence of their European title during the summer, Italy bounced back by getting off to a fast start in this season's Nations League, and they will be seeking a third successive win when they meet Belgium at Stadio Olimpico.

The Azzurri kicked off their campaign with a shock 3-1 victory over France: having conceded a calamitous goal within just 13 seconds of kickoff, Federico Dimarco scored a sublime equaliser, then strikes from Davide Frattesi and Giacomo Raspadori wrapped up three points in Paris.

Three days later, Luciano Spalletti's side saw off Israel to secure an early lead in Group 2, giving more credence to their mercurial coach's claims of a fresh start.

At Euro 2024, they never found their rhythm and ultimately limped out in the last 16, so new blood has been brought in to aid their latest quest for a first Nations League crown.

Just before Spalletti was appointed, Italy reached the 2023 finals by winning their group, but they could only manage a third-place finish in the four-team tournament.

Now aiming to go at least one better this time around, Italians must claim a top-two placing in their League A group, which would see them qualify for the new quarter-final stage.

Picking up more points in midweek - and from Monday's return match against Israel in Udine - would put them on track to do so, as La Nazionale's rebuild continues.

While their hosts have tried to turn a page on past failings, familiar problems resurfaced during Belgium's September get-together, which had started well enough, with a 3-1 win over Israel.

Captain and playmaker Kevin De Bruyne scored twice in the Red Devils' Nations League opener, but a few days later he was caught bitterly lamenting his teammates' lack of fight against old foes France.

Having headed to Lyon seeking some revenge for their tame exit from Euro 2024, which came at the hands of Les Bleus just two months previously, Belgium were beaten 2-0 and came in for some stinging criticism from their frustrated skipper.

Under-fire boss Domenico Tedesco is hoping to help his side build momentum before looking towards the 2026 World Cup, but De Bruyne has since temporarily stepped down from international duty, alongside all-time top scorer Romelu Lukaku.

In addition to his unresolved spat with Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, that has drawn questions about Tedesco's approach to man-management, as he tries to keep several big egos content while integrating fresh faces.

After Belgium were unable to reach the last Nations League finals, showing some progress this season might keep their current coach in a job, but he could do with picking up more points sooner rather than later.

Continuing his process of reducing Italy's age profile, Luciano Spalletti has included five uncapped players in his latest squad, including Daniel Maldini - son of Azzurri legend Paolo Maldini - and young Roma midfielder Niccolo Pisilli.

Federico Chiesa is still absent due to his lack of match fitness, Atalanta BC duo Gianluca Scamacca and Giorgio Scalvini are on the long road back from ACL injuries, while in-form Fiorentina striker Moise Kean has withdrawn because of a back problem.

Lorenzo Lucca will replace the latter, having scored five goals in nine games for Udinese so far this season, while midfield mainstay Nicolo Barella is back after missing last month's Nations League matches following sinus surgery.

With several forwards missing, Giacomo Raspadori or Roma captain Lorenzo Pellegrini will support Mateo Retegui up front.

Meanwhile, Belgium boss Domenico Tedesco - born in Calabria but brought up in Germany - will be without some senior stars as he returns to the land of his birth.

Ex-Roma loanee Romelu Lukaku will not appear at Stadio Olimpico, having taken a national-team sabbatical until 2025 in order to get fully fit for new club Napoli. Injured captain Kevin De Bruyne and estranged goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois are also unavailable.

Tedesco has called up three Italy-based players, including Atalanta's Charles De Ketelaere and Juventus winger Samuel Mbangula - the latter only made his senior debut in August, scoring in his first Serie A appearance.

In Lukaku's absence, Lois Openda should start up front, while Arsenal's Leandro Trossard is back in the visitors' squad after being overlooked for September's fixtures.


Italy possible starting lineup:
Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori; Bellanova, Barella, Ricci, Tonali, Dimarco; Pellegrini; Retegui

Belgium possible starting lineup:
Casteels; Castagne, Faes, Debast, Theate; Mangala, Tielemans; Lukebakio, Trossard, Doku; Openda



We say: Italy 2-1 Belgium

All is not well in the Belgian camp, despite a new generation of talent emerging to replace the 'golden' old guard. Meanwhile, Italy are starting to re-find their identity following some time in the wilderness after success at Euro 2020.

With fresh legs in midfield and an impressive array of defenders available, the Azzurri should see off their visitors and make it nine points from nine in Group 2.
