Italy 2-2 Belgium: Highlights, man of the match, stats as Belgium produce crucial fightback

Belgium came back from two goals behind to record a 2-2 draw against 10-man Italy on Thursday evening, giving the Red Devils a potentially crucial point in their UEFA Nations League group.

Italy burst out of the blocks as they found the opening goal just after the minute mark, with Federico Dimarco's cross causing huge trouble for the Belgium defence, allowing Andrea Cambiaso to poke in from close range after Maxim De Cuyper almost scored an own-goal.

The Azzurri were dominant after the restart and eventually scored their second goal in the 25th minute, following a sweeping attack that saw Cambiaso's effort parried into the path of Mateo Retegui, who calmly slotted it into the net to double their lead.

Italy appeared to be in complete control as the clock approached the 45th minute, but the game quickly took a turn when a VAR check in the 40th minute ended with Lorenzo Pellegrini receiving a red card for a dangerous tackle on Arthur Theate.

Salt was rubbed in Italy's wound when a brilliantly worked free kick resulted in De Cuyper whipping his effort past Gianluigi Donnarumma and into the bottom left corner, bringing Belgium straight back into the match.

Belgium took control in the second half as they sought to fight their way back, ultimately finding their equaliser when Wout Faes headed a corner towards goal, with Leandro Trossard skilfully poking it into the near corner.

Italy did well to manage a large part of the remaining minutes, with Belgium struggling to create any moments of quality, as the hosts stood strong to secure the point.



ITALY VS. BELGIUM HIGHLIGHTS

Andrea Cambiaso goal vs. Belgium (2nd min, Italy 1-0 Belgium)

What a start for Italy!

Dimarco receives the ball on the left, charges forward and plays a one-two with Pellegrini before driving a cross towards the back post.

De Cuyper deflects the cross towards his own goal, with Koen Casteels unbelievably stopping the ball on the line, only for the rebound to be bundled in by Cambiaso to give Italy the perfect start.

Mateo Retegui goal vs. Belgium (25th min, Italy 2-0 Belgium)

Dimarco sensationally switches the ball to Cambiaso with a driven first-time pass, and the forward drives towards the box before taking it onto his left foot and attempting to curl an effort into the far corner.

Casteels should make a routine save as he gets both hands on the ball, but his parry only goes as far as Retegui at the back post, with the striker able to slot it into the net with his left foot and give Italy their second goal of the night.

39th min: Lorenzo Pellegrini (Italy) red card

Roma's Pellegrini sees red at his club's home ground.

A late challenge from the midfielder on Theate results in the Italian receiving an initial yellow card, but a brief VAR check deems the foul to be high and with studs showing, leading to the decision being upgraded to a straight red card and leaving Italy with just 10 men.

Belgium are right back in this game!

Youri Tielemans lines up the free kick as if to shoot, but the midfielder deceptively plays the ball short to Trossard, who sets a shot for De Cuypers on the edge of the area.

The left-back unleashes a first-time whipped effort that soars past Donnarumma and into the bottom left corner, delivering a phenomenal strike that gives Belgium a lifeline in the match.

Leandro Trossard goal vs. Italy (62nd min, Italy 2-2 Belgium)

Belgium have equalised!

A deep corner is directed toward Faes, who heads the ball toward goal, and Trossard expertly moves in front of the keeper and pokes it into the near corner, levelling the score for his nation.



MAN OF THE MATCH - LEANDRO TROSSARD

Trossard was instrumental in Belgium coming back from two goals down to secure a crucial point in their attempts to climb their UEFA Nations League group table, assisting the first before scoring the second.

The forward was key in almost every positive attacking move that the Red Devils produced, having 57 touches and making two key passes throughout the game, while he put in a shift in defence with two tackles and three duels won.

BEST STATS







WHAT NEXT?

A point for Italy moves them to the top of their UEFA Nations League group, and they will look to make it three wins and a draw from four in League 2 Group A when they face Israel on Monday.

Belgium will be boosted by their comeback draw, and Domenico Tedesco's men will aim to make it two consecutive positive results when they take on France at home on Monday.
