Scorers: Gómez 20'

ONEFOOTBALL VIDEOS

Paraguay pulled off a famous victory against an ailing Brazil side thanks to a Diego Gómez stunner in the first-half.

The lion's-share of the ball was held by Brazil in the opening 15 minutes, but they could hardly get a sniff of the Paraguay goal.

Their lack of cutting edge came back to bite them just 20 minutes into the match when Inter Miami youngster Diego Gómez fired home a rasping shot from the edge of the box which found its way into the net off of the post.

Brazilian wonder-kid Endrick could hardly get a touch of the ball in the opening 45 minutes, forcing Dorival Júnior to substitute the youngster at half-time.

Brazil continued to see most of the ball after the restart, but they struggled do anything remotely meaningful with it.

Frustration appeared to be boiling over on the Brazil bench as the game fizzled out. The loss sees Dorival Júnior's side remain in fifth with just three wins from their opening eight games.

Meanwhile, Paraguay's first win against Brazil since 2008 meant they jumped up into seventh with the win.

Scorers: Mosquera 25', James (P) 60' ; González 48'

In a rematch of the 2024 Copa América final, Colombia got some revenge as they downed Argentina in a World Cup Qualifier.

Argentina have largely had it all their own way in the qualifying campaign so far, but it was Colombia who struck first and ultimately took a lead into the break thanks to a well-worked short corner that allowed James Rodríguez to pick out Yerson Mosquera for a thunderous header in the box.

The reigning World Cup and Copa América holders did not manage a shot on goal in the opening 45 minutes.

It did not take Argentina long to claw their way back into the match however, as Nico González went on a fantastic run before slotting home the leveler just a few minutes after the restart.

But parity did not last long. Colombia regained their lead thanks to a James penalty just 12 minutes later, putting the champions behind the eight-ball once again.

The hosts did not let their advantage slip away a second time, holding on for a big three points that sees them cut Argentina's lead at the top to just two points.

Colombia get their revenge on the 2024 Copa América final against Argentina 😅🇨🇴🇦🇷
