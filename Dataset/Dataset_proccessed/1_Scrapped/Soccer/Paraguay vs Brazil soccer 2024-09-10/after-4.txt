A stunning first-half strike from Diego Gomez helped Paraguay register only their second success of 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualification after a marvellous victory over Brazil at the Estadio Defensores del Chaco.

Having found the back of the net no less than 10 times across the previous three head to head's, Brazil dominated the opening proceedings by amassing over two-thirds of possession.

However, it was Paraguay midfielder Gomez who visibly stunned the five-time World Cup winners in the 20th minute as he expertly manoeuvred the ball away from his marker before striking a stunning shot, via the slight assistance of the post straight past Alisson.

In nearly an immediate response, Guilherme Arana came close to equalising for Brazil, however, the flying full-back frustratingly saw his effort cleared off the line by a retreating Paraguayan defender.

Despite fielding a front-three of Real Madrid attacking trio of Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior and Endrick, manager Dorival Junior returned to the away dressing room with work to do as La Albirroja remained a half of football away from a first head to head victory played within 90 minutes since June 2008.

Set for the second half with two substitutions in tandem, Brazil threatened immediately as Rodrygo – looking to make a point on the pitch after being omitted from the recently released 30-man catalogue of excellence for the 2024 Ballon d'Or award – fired over the top of the crossbar.

Following a period of inactivity in front of goal, Paraguay goalkeeper Gatito Fernández came to his side’s rescue with the game entering the final quarter as he sublimely redirected Vinícius’ fierce effort around the post.

Despite their huffing and puffing at Fernández’s door seeking a late equaliser, Brazil could not get through as a much-needed three points for Paraguay, in terms of a first appearance at a World Cup finals since 2010, sees La Albirroja enter the month-long break in the sole CONMEBOL qualification play-off position.

Meanwhile, Junior’s side’s struggles as of late continue with the Selecao emerging victorious in only two of their previous six matches, in addition to losing a hat-trick of WCQ away from home.
