Al Nassr continued their impressive run in the Roshn Saudi League with a dominant 3-0 win over Al Orobah in the final match of Matchweek 6. Under the guidance of their Italian coach Stefano Pioli, the team secured another valuable three points, extending their winning streak.

Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Al Nassr in the 17th minute, confidently converting a penalty after his side was awarded a spot-kick. The Portuguese forward, who captains the team, set the tone for the rest of the match.

Senegalese forward Sadio Mane doubled the lead in the 29th minute, finishing off a well-executed play to put his side in control. Mane then netted his second of the match in the 71st minute, with the referee initially ruling the goal offside but reversing the decision after consulting the VAR.

The win pushes Al Nassr’s points tally to 14, moving them closer to the top of the league table. Meanwhile, Al Orobah remain on seven points after the defeat.

The match was not without setbacks, as Al Nassr’s Sultan Al Ghannam was forced off with an injury early in the first half.
