Mauritania, with only two previous Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) appearances, are determined to leave a lasting impression in the upcoming tournament.

Making their debut in 2019, the Lions of Chinguetti faced tough opposition and exited in the group stage.

Their inaugural AFCON journey included a challenging start with a 4-1 defeat to Mali, followed by goalless draws against Angola and Tunisia, earning them two points but placing them at the bottom of the standings.

In their subsequent attempt to advance further in the tournament, Mauritania found themselves drawn against Tunisia and Mali once again, along with Gambia. Unfortunately, they couldn’t secure a victory in any of the three matches and failed to score a single goal, resulting in their exit.

As they approach the 2023 AFCON, the Lions of Chinguetti are eager to make a stronger impact and surpass the group stage. Despite being grouped with formidable opponents like Algeria, Burkina Faso, and Angola, Mauritania are determined to defy the odds and make their mark in the continental competition.
