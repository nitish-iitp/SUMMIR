“Frankly, it’s embarrassing,” says Coun. Brad Bradford of the ban due to obstacles and safety hazards on the hills. ‘This is part of the Canadian experience ... and Toronto shouldn’t be the exception to that.”

“Tobogganing is not allowed on this hill,” reads a new sign at the top of a popular spot in East Lynn Park, near Danforth and Woodbine avenues.
