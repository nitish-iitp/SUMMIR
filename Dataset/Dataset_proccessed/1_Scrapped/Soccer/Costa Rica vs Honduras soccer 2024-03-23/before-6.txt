Countries with the Most Similar Food to Nicaragua

country food similarity index, food, nicaragua

The Country Food Similarity Index is a statistically-based attempt to quantify how similar the food in one country is relative to another. By comparing the weight of raw food ingredients used in each country, a score is assigned that reflects the degree of similarity between the respective countries. The methodology is exactly the same for each country studied.

The Most Similar Cuisines to Nicaraguan Food

Nicaragua is a Central American country. Four of the five countries with the most similar food to Nicaragua were all once colonized by Spain. These four nations have tropical climates. In addition, all five countries are predominately Catholic.

Honduras and Nicaragua heavily rely on staple ingredients such as corn, beans, rice, plantains, and various meats. Several dishes are shared between the two countries, albeit with regional variations. For example, both countries have variations of tamales, which are made from corn dough.
Panama is another country in Central America that borders both the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea. Rice is the most commonly eaten staple grain in these countries. Furthermore, chicken and pork are their most popular meats. Both countries incorporate many beans into their dishes as well.
Venezuela is in South America, but it also borders the Caribbean Sea. Both countries use a lot of rice and beans in its dishes, and also shares a love for fried plantains. Additionally, Nicaraguan cuisine features dishes like nacatamales, which is similar to Venezuelan hallacas. Chicken is the most commonly eaten meat in both countries.
El Salvador and Nicaragua do not border each other but they do have similar food. The popular nacatamal in Nicaragua is akin to the Salvadoran tamale. Gallo pinto, a mixture of rice and red beans, holds a special place in both nations’ breakfast tables. Additionally, the shared love for plantains can be observed in dishes like maduros and tostones.
Cape Verde shares some culinary connections with Nicaragua, particularly in the use of corn and rice based dishes. Additionally, both countries appreciate comfort foods. Chicken is the most widely consumed meat in these nations. Cape Verde, although geographically distant from Central America, was a Portuguese colony.

Nicaragua’s cuisine is not far different from most countries. Four of the five countries with the least similar food to Nicaragua are located in Africa. Four of the five countries are landlocked. Furthermore, many of these countries have drier climates than Nicaragua on average.

South Sudan has a tropical climate, but its food supply is still extremely different from Nicaragua’s. Cassava is its staple food, however the country eats a lot of sorghum as well. Porridge is one of the most popular dishes in the country. In addition, South Sudanese cuisine features a variety of sauces made with peanuts and sesame seed.
Chad is a former French colony in the middle of Africa that is predominately Muslim. Sorghum and millet are the two most commonly consumed grains there. These crops are well adapted to the Sahel’s climate.
Turkmenistan is the only Asian country on this list. Wheat, potatoes, and lamb are key ingredients in Turkmen cuisine. In contrast to Nicaragua, the country’s culinary traditions reflect the rich nomadic heritage of its people.
Sudan is located to the north of South Sudan. Sudan’s climate allows for the cultivation of crops like sorghum and millet. Sudanese cuisine often incorporates a wide range of spices and seasonings, such as cumin, coriander, ginger, and fenugreek.
