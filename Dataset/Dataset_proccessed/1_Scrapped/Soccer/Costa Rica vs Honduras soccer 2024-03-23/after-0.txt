Canada defeat TT 2-0 in Copa America Play-In

Trinidad and Tobago's hopes of qualifying for the 2024 Copa America vanished as the national team fell to a 2-0 defeat to Canada in a winner-take-all match in Frisco, Texas on Saturday afternoon.

Cyle Larin gave the Canadians the vital first goal in the 61st minute before Jacob Staffelburg added a second in second-half stoppage time to confirm the Maple Leaf's first participation in the South American Championship.

Trinidad and Tobago held Canada, who participated in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, scoreless for 60 minutes before the first goal went in.

Canada had 25 shots on goal to Trinidad and Tobago's six, with the Maple Leafs having 59% of the possession in the game.

Canada will now move into Group A of the 2024 Copa America and will play Lionel Messi's Argentina in the opening game of the tournament.

Costa Rica is playing Honduras for a place in the Championship on Saturday.

The USA, Panama, Jamaica, Mexico, and now Canada have already qualified for the tournament.

Argentina is the defending champions after Angel Di Maria's goal beat Brazil in the final at the Maracana, Rio de Janeiro in July 2021.
