Matt worked at Mile High Shooting Accessories, and was always a gem to talk to. Some of you from the Hide may have spoke with him on the phone or met him in person while dealing with Mile High. From professional standpoint and from a bullshitting standpoint, Matt was a great guy to have in our industry . Frank and I worked with Matt a lot, laughed a lot too. Unfortunately, this Sunday Matt was riding his motorcycle and was involved in an accident, he died of his injuries. He was 28yrs young and was taken way too soon.

Please consider helping us raise money for his family during this tragic time to help compensate for this unexpected tragedy. Rest easy young man, we will miss your “moosestash,” quirky smile and your willingness to help out anyone who needed it.

Frank and I will be attending his funeral this Sunday. This is just a reminder that everyday that we are here is a gift. Our time on this earth is short, make the best of it. Do good things, be spontaneous, have adventures. You never know when God calls you to him.

Yeah, it’s entirely too short. I had to have Frank proof read it because I was crying too much.

OMFG!

I worked with Matt and we became good work friends. We literally worked side by side. I can't believe he's gone. I just stopped in and spoke with him several weeks ago. He was an exceptional young man and I was fortunate to know him and become friends. I can't believe I'm reading this right now.

Wow, that's so tragic, such a young man. I did not know him, nor done business with MHSA, but this really struck a deeply personal nerve for me, so I sent a little support.

To those of you that did know him, I'm sorry for your loss.

Yep, looked through my messages and Matt squared me away with a discussion on shooting bags. Great guy in my experience, far too young. I chipped in.

Hopefully it helps bring some closure to his family.

Hey - I get many of us are in a bad place with Bidenomics especially if you are on a fixed income, but only 36 donors for less than $3500? Come on 'Hide, we are better than that. How about $10 or $20 from those who visit SH today?

Didn't know Matt, had one or two interctions with Mile High years ago, but this is our community..

I'm only just now seeing this after learning about the loss of Matt from MHS. Matt helped me for years and I wouldn't be where I am in my shooting career without him. I considered him a friend and he was always my go-to guy. I'm going to mourn his loss greatly. I'll be contributing to the GoFundMe as soon as possible.
