Sierra Leone head coach Amidu Karim has named his starting squad for the African Cup of Nations Group G qualifying opener against Chad at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Stadium.

Crystal Palace Under-21s midfielder Hindolo Mustapha, who received his first International call, is starting from the bench.

The Gaffer has opted for experience in defence with Ankara Keçiörengücü‘s defender Steven Caulker, Dinamo Brest centre-back Jarju Kabia, Hartford Athletic‘s Emmanuel Samadia and Osman Kakay as his back four.

First start for Huddersfield attacker Jose Koroma, who will team up with Italy-based Augustus Kargbo, Mustapha Bundu and Daniel Kanu to find goal access over 90 minutes of football.

In Midfield, Twin brothers -Alusine and Alhassan Koroma must create cover and process attacks for the team.

The Leone Stars – ranked 56 places higher than their opponents, must lay down an early statement against the Central African nation at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Stadium on September 6th.

A win will significantly increase the squad’s belief when they engage Zambia’s Chipolopolo on the 9th for the second match day at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium.
