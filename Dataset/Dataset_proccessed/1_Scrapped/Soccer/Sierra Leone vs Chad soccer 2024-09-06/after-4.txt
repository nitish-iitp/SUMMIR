Chad snatch valuable point as Sierra Leone sleep at home
 September 6, 2024
 Alie Bittar @bittar32

In Friday’s match, Sierra Leone missed an opportunity to secure a win as they settled for a goalless draw against Les Sao of Chad in the Group G opener at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Stadium in Liberia.

The visitors put up a solid fight in the Liberian capital as Sierra Leone failed to create decisive chances in the opening hour of the tie.

The Leone Stars in most of the game, struggled to assert themselves, facing relentless pressure from Chad. Chad maintained a persistent offensive, repeatedly testing Sierra Leone’s goalkeeper Mohamed Kamara, who made several outstanding saves.

A missed opportunity arose for Sierra Leone when substitute Musa Noah Kamara’s presence led to a promising chance, only for Charlton Athletic striker Daniel Kanu to falter late in the game.

Musa struck another shot in the final two minutes of extra time, but it was an easy save for the Coton Sport keeper, Allabatina Allamtana Gabin

Crystal Palace Under-21s midfielder Hindolo Mustapha, who received his first International call, made his Sierra Leone debut.

This outcome makes it imperative for both Sierra Leone and Chad to pursue a win in their next matches: Sierra Leone will face Zambia, while Chad will host defending champions Ivory Coast, both on Tuesday.

Sierra Leone has failed to secure victories in their last three opening recent Cup of Nations qualification matches against Lesotho and Nigeria, the 0-0 result against Chad.

In the meantime, the other teams in the group, Ivory Coast and Zambia, will confront each other at the Stade de la Paix in Bouaké later this evening.

Sierra Leone 0-0 Chad
