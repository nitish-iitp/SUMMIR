Sierra Leone meet Chad for just the second time (PC: Getty Images)

Sierra Leone and Chad clash in a neutral Monrovia, Liberia on Friday for their opening game of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. The sides have been drawn alongside Ivory Coast and Zambia in Group G.

Ranked 122nd in the world, Sierra Leone are looking to make their AFCON return for the first time since 2021, having failed to make the cut for the Ivory Coast showpiece earlier this year.

After starting the year with back-to-back defeats, against Ivory Coast and Morocco, the Leone Stars overcame Djibouti 2-1 before a 2-2 draw with Burkina Faso, both coming in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

On the other hand, Chad are looking to create history with their first appearance in the AFCON finals next year. They are one of the lowest-ranked African sides at 178th in the world, and beat Mauritius home and away in the first round of the qualifiers to get to this stage.

Marius Mouandilmadji struck the winner for Les Sao in the third minute of added time to win the first leg 1-0, before pulling off a 2-1 comeback win in the return. That game also saw the North African side net another late winner, this time through Ousmane Hissein in the 10th added minute.

Sierra Leone have improved after their sluggish start to the year, demonstrating good attacking quality. They can ruffle some feathers here, with Chad looking shaky lately, and we expect Sierra Leone to secure a narrow win.
