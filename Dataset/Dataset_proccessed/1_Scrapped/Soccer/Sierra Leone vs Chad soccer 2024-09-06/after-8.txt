In a thrilling AFCON Cup Qualifier match, Sierra Leone’s Leone Stars were held to a 0-0 draw against CHAD at the SKD Stadium in Liberia today 6th September, 2024 .

The two teams were very determined as they  refused to give up in the Opening Qualifier Match. The tide began to turn  as both teams made tactical changes in an attempt  to found the net but all efforts prove fruitless.

The struggle for goals reignited the two teams  as they pushed relentlessly to secure their fist three  Points. However, their efforts didn’t paid off as the match ended in a stalemate.
