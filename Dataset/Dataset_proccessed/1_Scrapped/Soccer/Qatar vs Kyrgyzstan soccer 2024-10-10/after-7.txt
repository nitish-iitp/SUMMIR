Qatar Recent Performance

Current times have seen Qatar at the summit of its history in terms of success. The wins at the 2019 and 2023 AFC Asian Cup as well as the very first qualification to a World Cup appearance in 2022, this has been the most successful time in history as hosts, who will go straight to the group stage automatically, the first Arab nation to achieve that. Although Qatar went out after two matches, it was hard to get much better than that, considering the team only won four of their next 14 matches in other competitions. That reversed when they thrashed Afghanistan 8-1 in the second round of AFC qualifying. That triggered a streak of 13 victories, one draw, and one defeat. Although, they entered the third qualifying round with optimism towards the 2026 World Cup, a slow start to group games against Kyrgyzstan, North Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Uzbekistan has mounted immense pressure upon them. Qatar is still within five points of automatic qualification spots, even though they have eight more games to play and have won only once in their first two games. 




Qatar Expected Lineup

Barsham; Hassan, Salman, Mendes; Al Yazidi, Abdulsallam, Fathy, Al-Hassan, Ahmed; Afif, Ali

Kyrgyzstan Form

A match against Kyrgyzstan could be the turning point for Qatar, who will be playing against a struggling opponent who has lost both of their opening group matches. Kyrgyzstan has won only four of their last 22 games in all competitions but has shown resilience in close defeats against stronger opposition in the third qualifying round.

Kyrgyzstan Expected Lineup

Tokotaev; Mishchenko, Brauzman, Kozubaev, Kichin, Kenzhebaev; Abdurakhmanov, Zarypbekov, Shukurov; Kojo, Uulu

Qatar vs Kyrgyzstan Prediction Expert Picks

The Qatar side drew 2-2 with North Korea in their last match. Qatar played very well and could pick the same starting line-up. The main strikers Akram Afif and Almoez Ali were on target in that game and have high chances of repeating the pattern again.

However, Kyrgyzstan seemed to play decently in the 3-2 defeat at the expense of Uzbekistan and can be considered to remain the same force here.

The mentioned Joel Kojo and Odilzhon Abdurakhmanov, who scored his first goals in the last match, should enter the field again for the visitors. While Kyrgyzstan has proven itself to be quite a tough opponent in the previous rounds of AFC third matches, Qatar is in a stronger position and would surely want its first win, making it the probable winner of this game.
