SCOTLAND V PORTUGAL - NATIONS LEAGUE PREVIEW

He's a footballing icon and now Cristiano Ronaldo is in town for a Nations League clash at Hampden - his first time ever at the national stadium.

Portugal are dab hands of making qualifiers a breeze and will aim to do so again at the national stadium as Steve Clarke and his team look for a morale-boosting result. It's been a dreary recent run and while performances have largely been good in our first three games in League A, three late goals mean we're yet to get a point on the board.

There might be some optimism Scotland can get off the ground tonight having run Portugal so close in Lisbon only for Ronaldo to emerge from the bench and bundle one in at the back post. The plan tonight will be to stop them at source and remind the Tartan Army why there is still real cause to believe. Here is everything you need to know to watch it.

When is the game?

Scotland face Portugal on Tuesday, October 15 at Hampden. Kick off is 7.45pm.

Is the game on TV?

The game will NOT be shown on traditional TV by a major broadcaster. Viaplay Sports have the rights, but a deal with either ITV or BBC to show the game collapsed, and with Viaplay no longer in the UK TV market, that means it won't be on the box.

Will there be a live stream?
