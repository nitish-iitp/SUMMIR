Let's 1xbet - Let the dream come true:




Early life in Madeira: The Humble beginnings

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira, February 5th, 1985. From a poor family background, Ronaldo grew with some difficult circumstances in his childhood. His father was the kit man for a local football team and his mother provided to family members carrying out some cleaning jobs. Even in his lowest points, it was clear Ronaldo loved football. So he started to play for the amateur club Andorinha, which his father worked at where it became apparent quickly that Ronaldo had exceptional abilities.

However, Ronaldo left his home in Madeira and made the move to Lisbon aged 12 after joining Sporting CP's famed academy - where he embarked on a path towards becoming a professional footballer. It was not a straightforward decision, as it meant moving away from his family to learn the ropes in another city but Ronaldo had amazing self belief.




Sporting CP and the move to Manchester United

Ronaldo's talent was quickly flourishing at Sporting CP. He was best known for his tremendous speed, dribbling ability and sharp technical skills. He first represented Sporting's senior team in 2002, aged just 17, and quickly became the subject of transfer speculation to Europe.

Sporting CP and Manchester United 'matched' up in a friendly match back in 2003, the game where his life would be forever changed. Sir Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United players were in raptures been by one of the performances most electrifying. Ferguson realised immediately that Ronaldo was something special and soon the young Portuguese winger had been snapped up by Manchester United in a £12.24 million deal, back then making him one of English football's most expensive teenagers ever.

Ronaldo was a budding world-class player with Manchester United. Under Ferguson, he refined his game and became a far more disciplined footballer. He was instrumental in their 2008 Champions League success and helped them to three straight Premier League titles. His spell at Manchester United not only made him one of the world's biggest names but also granted Ronaldo his first Ballon d'Or award in 2008.




Real Madrid: The rise to global stardom

Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid in 2009 for £80 million (€94 million, US$132m) which was a world record transfer fee at the time. It was the start of an extraordinary period in Ronaldo's career which saw him break records, and is still very much among football's top tier to this day.

In his nine years at Real Madrid, Ronaldo broke goal-scoring records left, right and centre with 450 goals in 438 appearances, which made him the club's all-time top scorer. He has won 4 Champions League titles (2014, 2016–17 and 18) including a Ballon d'Or each for himself and the several other accolades. His highly charged struggles with Lionel Messi during this time period inspired football enthusiasts around the world, taking sport to a new level.

We all saw it in every match, Ronaldo was incredibly talented with his unbelievable work-ethic and attention to details invaluable. He could score from anywhere on the field and with his blend of physicality and footballing smarts, he was a nightmare for defenders. More than just his footballing ability, Ronaldo was also the leader on and off the pitch that underpinned Real Madrid's european success.




Juventus and the return to Manchester United

Ronaldo shocked the footballing world in 2018 by moving to Juventus — one of Europe's biggest clubs - for a fee of €100 million. He would continue to defy the aging process while displaying his brilliance out on field despite having entered this 30s stage of life. He claimed two more Serie A titles and continued to score, underlining his desire for greatness remained unquenched. This year, Ronaldo is back to Manchester United from where he started his internationally journey. Fans were understandably excited to see the all-time-great return and add another layer to his legacy.




International success with Portugal

Although Ronaldo has enjoyed an incredible club career, he has also impressed with the Portugal national team. Ronaldo finally got over the hump in 2016, leading Portugal to their first major international win at that year's Euro tournament, which only served to further elevate his status in his home county. He then added the UEFA Nations League with Portugal in 2019.

For the past 12 years, and for good reason, Ronaldo has been an established fixture in the Portuguese side with his leadership skills on full display at Euro 2016 along with some clutch performances over their quest to earn silverware forever memorable. His ambition for his country to be successful emphasises the love of playing and winning that exists within him.
