BOTSWANA PREVIEW: TOUGH FOR BOTSWANA

Under the management of Didier Gomes Da Rosa, Botswana are currently ranked 145th in the world according to FIFA’s rankings. The Zebras came through the preliminary round to make the group stages of qualification.

In their opening match of the group stages the other day, Botswana began with a slender 1-0 defeat to Mauritania in the capital city, Nouakchott, with an 84th minute winning goal scored by Sidi Bouna Amar.

EGYPT PREVIEW: FLOURISHING PHAROAHS

Egypt are into the seventh month of their new era following the February appointment of Hossam Hassan. The Egyptians are blessed with the impressive form of Mohamed Salah but the Liverpool forward didn’t need to score in their opening qualifier.

Hosting Cabo Verde at the Cairo International Stadium in the Egyptian capital, Egypt took a 23rd minute lead via Ramy Rabia before doubling that through Omar Marmoush on the stroke of half-time. They then made it 3-0 in the 70th minute with Ibrahim Adel notching.

BOTSWANA TEAM NEWS: NO ISSUES

Botswana have a generally weak squad so the depth of talent isn’t really there for them to make too many changes as they are set to be quite defensive against a strong Egyptian side.

PREDICTED XI (4-3-3): Phoko; Sikele, Kopelang, Ditlhokwe, Mangolo; Mohutsiwa, Gaolaolwe, Majafi; Seakanyeng, Tlhalefang, Orebonye

UNAVAILABLE:

QUESTIONABLE:

EGYPT TEAM NEWS: GOING UNCHANGED

After an impressive performance the other day and with no injury issues or suspension concerns, it would seem likely that Egypt remain unchanged for this one.

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): El Shenawy; Hany, Rabia, Fathy, Hamdy; Attia, Trezeguet; Salah, Sayed, Marmoush; Mostafa Mohamed

BOTSWANA VS EGYPT PREDICTION

Botswana are one of the weakest teams in the group stages of qualification and they now face an extremely tough test against the seven-time champions of Africa that have started their qualifying campaign extremely well with that hammering of Cabo Verde the other day. As a result, it would seem quite a good value bet to suggest that a heavy and comfortable Egyptian victory is to be expected.
