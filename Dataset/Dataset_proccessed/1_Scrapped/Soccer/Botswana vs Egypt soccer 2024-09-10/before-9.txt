20h08: Full-time – Cameroon 1 (Aboubakar 65′) Namibia 0




Cameroon maintain their unbeaten start under Brys after picking up all three points in the opening match of their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign. Namibia had their chances despite seeing far less of the ball, but lacked a cutting edge in front of goal.




20h00 – Full-Time: Mauritania 1-0 Botswana.




Amar’s 84th minute goal inspired the Lions of Chinguetti to a narrow win over the Zebras in a Group C clash. The two teams will be in action on Tuesday as Botswana host Egypt in Francistown, while Mauritania will be away to Egypt.




20:00 – Full time. Nigeria 3-0 Benin.




Goals from Lookman (two) and Osimhen secure a comfortable win for the Super Eagles, who top Group D on three points. The teams will return to action on Tuesday 10 September, with Nigeria away to Rwanda in Kigali, and Benin hosting Libya in neutral Abidjan (Ivory Coast).

19:40 – Nigeria 1-0 Benin. Less than a quarter hour left to play in this Group D clash, with the Super Eagles still on course for a narrow victory.

19h33: Cameroon v Namibia – Couple of chances for the Indomitable Lions as Jackson Tchatchoua fires wide of the mark after winning back possession in the final third before Bryan Mbeumo forces Maova at his near post moments later.




19h29 – Mauritania 0-0 Botswana: Attack-minded duo of Baruti and Sesinyi are introduced by coach Didier Gomes Da Rosa as the Zebras look to open the scoring. 65 minutes played.

19h13 – Mauritania 0-0 Botswana: The second-half is underway.

18:53 – Half time. Nigeria 1-0 Benin. The hosts hold a slender advantage in Uyo at the break.




18h54 – Half-Time: Mauritania 0-0 Botswana – No goalless at the break following a first-half which was dominated by the Lions of Chinguetti, but goalkeeper Phoko made two saves to keep the hosts at bay.
