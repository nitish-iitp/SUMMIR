California Ultimate is excited to host the 2024 Sinvite on March 30-31, 2024 in Henderson, Nevada.

That’s on you.

EVENT DETAILS

Date:  March 30-31, 2024

Time Expectations (subject to change, and not including warm-up before games start):

Saturday – 9:00AM-9:00PM
Sunday – 8:30AM-3:30PM

Field Site: Heritage Park, 350 S Racetrack Rd, Henderson, NV 89015

Games will be played on the soccer fields on either side of the southwest parking lot. Teams should be prepared to play on turf or grass.

Divisions: Div I, III, & Developmental teams are all welcome, however we will likely combine divisions based on the number of teams expressing interest.

Teams: University of Arizona, Arizona State University, Cal State Long Beach, Claremont Colleges, Grand Canyon University, San Jose State, UC-Berkeley (B), UC-San Diego (B), UC-Santa Barbara (B), USC (B)

Official Hotel: We’ve arranged a special event rate with the Downtown Grand Resort & Casino about 30 minutes from the fields and 10-15 minutes from the famous Vegas Strip. The rate is $155/room/night which includes all fees and taxes; rooms must be booked through the payment portal below by March 15th.

Fees:  $400 team fee, with an additional per player fee of $8 for men’s players and $5 for women’s players. The difference in cost is CUA’s commitment to (re)building women’s & girls’ ultimate post pandemic; one way we are trying to do that at this event is by lowering the cost of participation for women’s teams/players.
