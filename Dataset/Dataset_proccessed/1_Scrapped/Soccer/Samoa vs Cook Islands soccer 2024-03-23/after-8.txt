BROOKLYN — No. 12 seed JMU men’s basketball is set to face No. 4 seed Duke in the Round of 32 of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday at 5:15 p.m, and it’s not the first time JMU has faced a Tobacco Road school in the second round.

The last two times JMU advanced this far, in 1982 and ’83, it faced North Carolina. First, the Tar Heels narrowly defeated the Dukes 52-50 en route to a national championship. The next year, North Carolina handedly defeated the Dukes 68-49 before bowing out to Georgia in the regional finals, later dubbed the Elite Eight.

On that ’83 JMU team were two freshman centers — Todd Banks and Eric Esch (both ’86).

The two joined the program that appeared on an upward trajectory. The Dukes were coming off that close loss to the Tar Heels in their second straight NCAA Tournament appearance. Not only was JMU eying a third straight trip, but it was also preparing to play in a brand new arena — the Convocation Center.

“It was just a great atmosphere,” Banks said of the program. “It was awesome.”

Despite the precedent set the following two years, JMU’s road to a third-straight NCAA Tournament appearance wasn’t easy. The Dukes played in the ECAC South at the time, which later became the CAA, where they played from its formation in 1979 until 2022.

“We knew, being in a small conference at the time, the ECAC South, that we thought we had to win the tournament,” Banks said.

The Dukes actually managed to earn an at-large bid the year prior with a 24-6 record and an ECAC South-leading 10-1 conference mark. But in ’83, JMU entered the conference tournament as the No. 2 seed at 17-10 and a conference record of 6-3.

Ahead of them was William & Mary, which finished the regular season 20-6 and 9-0 in conference play. The two teams met in the conference tournament final, where JMU junior guard Derek Steele (1980-84) made the jump shot that was the difference in the Dukes’ 41-38 win.

“He made a great shot and put us ahead and we won the game,” Esch said. “So that’s how we qualified for the NCAA.”

JMU was back in the tournament and won its first -round game for the third straight year in 1983, beating West Virginia 57-50. The Dukes advanced for a rematch with the Tar Heels that is remembered less for the actual game and more so for an unexpected collision between UNC senior guard Jim Braddock (1979-83) and a JMU cheerleader.

Before JMU fans threw streamers at football games after every touchdown, they threw toilet paper after the first JMU basket at every basketball game, even in the NCAA Tournament. So when the up-tempo Tar Heels quickly inbounded the ball to Braddock, he sprinted down the court, directly into a cheerleader trying to retrieve the rolls who was knocked to the ground.

“I was standing not too far from it and, boy, was that a collision,” Esch said.

But the game went on, ending with a decisive North Carolina win. Esch said he didn’t expect it to be the last time the Dukes would be in the Big Dance during his time at JMU.

“One of the biggest things I learned from the experience was to enjoy the moment when it happens because you don’t know if it's going to happen again,” Esch said.

Now, 41 years later, both Esch and Banks are excited to watch the Dukes’ return to the Round of 32. Banks had the opportunity to see JMU in person earlier this season, when some of the program’s alums decided to have an impromptu get-together at the Dukes’ 78-63 win over Old Dominion in Harrisonburg on Feb. 3.

“Looking forward to [tipoff at] 5:15,” Banks said the morning of JMU’s second round game.

As for Esch, he hopped on a zoom call with a few of his college friends on Friday to watch the Dukes’ 72-61 victory over Wisconsin in the first round.

“We had so much fun on that call, and we were so proud,” he said. “It’s been just a great experience, and I couldn't be happier for the players and the coaches and everybody associated with the program.”

Esch said he plans to hop on another Zoom for JMU’s second round game, but only after the Fairfax, Virginia, resident heads down to Richmond to meet his two new granddaughters, one born on Monday, the other on Saturday.

“We’ve got a tight itinerary,” Esch said. “We’re going to get down there, kiss some babies and get back on the road so we can watch the game at home.”

Noah Freidel leans on his family’s support during March Madness run

Redshirt senior guard Noah Freidel has traveled to 11 JMU basketball games this season and made the trip to Brooklyn for the Dukes’ NCAA Tournament appearance.
