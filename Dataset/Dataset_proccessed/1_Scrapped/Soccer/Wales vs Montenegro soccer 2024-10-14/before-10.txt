Preview: Iceland vs. Turkey - prediction, team news, lineups

Following a spirited second-half fightback last time out, Iceland can draw level with League B Group 4 leaders Turkey when they meet in the UEFA Nations League on Monday.

While the hosts salvaged a point from their game against Wales, the Crescent-Stars moved clear at the top with a late winner at home to Montenegro.

Staring defeat in the face after going two goals down before the half-hour mark on Friday, Iceland were seemingly set to drop three points behind in the race for a top-two finish.

However, the hosts came roaring back after the break in Reykjavik, with substitute Logi Tomasson first curling an equaliser into the bottom corner, then seeing his low cutback strike Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward and go in, levelling the scoreline at Laugardalsvollur.

Though Age Hareide's men were much the better side throughout the second half, they ultimately had to settle for a draw, following on from one win and one loss in September.

Ranked 71st in the world by FIFA, Iceland are still in contention to finish first and secure automatic promotion back to League A, but their current third-place position would result in a relegation playoff.

Facing trips to Montenegro and Wales next month, when Group 4 will reach its conclusion, the Nordic nation must now try to capitalise on having home advantage against Turkey, who they have beaten in both of the teams' last two meetings in Iceland.

Turkey came out on top when the teams met last month, though, with in-form Benfica forward Kerem Akturkoglu netting a hat-trick in a dominant 3-1 victory.

Having previously kicked off their latest Nations League campaign with a goalless draw against Wales, the Crescent-Stars topped the table coming into the current international period, and they maintained their unbeaten record at home to Montenegro last time out.

Substitute Irfan Kahveci - who had replaced Yunus Akgun just seven minutes earlier - scored the only goal midway through the second half in Samsun, giving his country a two-point lead at the halfway stage.

Vincenzo Montella's side have continued their progress since reaching the quarter-finals of Euro 2024, and the Italian coach now has a 50% win-rate from his 16 games in charge of the Turkish national team.

Renowned as a pin-sharp striker during his playing days, Montella is getting a tune out of his talented crop of forwards, including Akturkoglu, Juventus star Kenan Yildiz and particularly Real Madrid's Arda Guler.

In addition to Lille winger Hakon Haraldsson, who suffered an injury while on international duty in September and is still not available, Iceland boss Age Hareide is without centre-back Brynjar Ingi Bjarnason this month.

Sverrir Ingi Ingason returned to the back four on Friday and should start again, lining up ahead of Brentford goalkeeper Hakon Valdimarsson.

Meanwhile, 96-cap skipper Johann Berg Gudmundsson features in midfield, where 35-year-old Gylfi Sigurdsson could force his way back into the first XI after being restricted to a cameo against Wales; Andri Gudjohnsen - son of national team legend Eidur Gudjohnsen - should start up front.

Turkey are without injured first-choice goalkeeper Mert Gunok, so Ugurcan Cakir is set to deputise again; Caglar Soyuncu, Ozan Kabak and Ismail Yuksek are also sidelined.

Bertug Yildirim and Merih Demiral have returned to the setup after both served a suspension after misdemeanours at Euro 2024, while Ferdi Kadioglu is likely to continue at left-back, having missed out in September because of injury.

With a host of options open to him, Vincenzo Montella may rotate his resources following the win over Montenegro, so Kenan Yildiz, Zeki Celik and match-winner Irfan Kahveci could all come into the side on Monday evening.


Iceland possible starting lineup:
Valdimarsson; Sampsted, Gretarsson, Ingason, Tomasson; Anderson, Gudmundsson, Thordarson, Thorsteinsson; Sigurdsson; Gudjohnsen

Turkey possible starting lineup:
Cakir; Celik, Demiral, Bardakci, Kadioglu; Calhanoglu, Kokcu; Kahveci, Guler, Yildiz; B. Yilmaz



We say: Iceland 1-1 Turkey

After an excellent second-half showing on Friday night, Iceland can take the fight to Turkey and come out of a close-fought contest with at least one point.

The visitors' squad is packed with attacking talent, but they do not tend to fare well away from home and may have to settle for a draw at Laugardalsvollur.
