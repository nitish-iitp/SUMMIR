The June issue of qathet Living's cover celebrates the arrival of Humpback whales in the Salish Sea this summer, with a warning to boaters to be on the watch. This issue also includes a look ahead at some of the big events coming up in June, including Grad, Bike Week, and the symphony extravaganza that is PRISMA. We also take a look at the new federal dental plan and the hiccups in it rollout in qathet. Our real estate section considers the $40,000 government subsidy for building and renting out a suite. We also look at the Inland Lake trail and the bridge that needs to be repaired, and how some advocacy got things rolling. Plus there's our jam-packed events section that includes info on Pride Month, the Garden Tour, and more, and a summer planner. Plus our usual business news, columns and more.
