TELL ME MORE

Belgium were slow to get off the block but an inspired performance in the second half saw them get over the line before heading to Germany. The hosts dominated possession from the first whistle but a gritty Luxembourg defence had little trouble dealing with an insipid Belgian attack. Domenico Tedesco had thrown in his attacking resources on the pitch including the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Leandro Trossard, Doku and Lukaku but still ran out of ideas while trying to break down Luxembourg who had set themselves up in banks of five and four.

However, just three minutes from half-time the visitors' resistance was finally broken by a marauding Lukaku. The Chelsea forward bamboozled his way past two Belgian players until he was finally brought down inside the box by Enes Mahmutovic. The striker stepped up to take the penalty and made no mistake in finding the net to put his side ahead.

Tedesco fine-tuned his attack at half-time and allowed more freedom to Doku to venture forward. The Manchester City winger proved to be a menace to Luxembourg's defence as his speed, trickery and guile were too much to handle. Just before the hour-mark, another sensational play from Doku paved the way for Belgium's insurance goal. He showed a clean pair of heels to Eldin Dzogovic, drilled in a low cross across the face of the goal and Lukaku did the rest to complete his brace. Belgium upped their ante in the final quarter to increase their margin and Leandro Trossard scored the third to cap off a comfortable victory for his side.

THE MVP(S)

Doku and Lukaku were simply incredible after the first 40 minutes for Belgium. The duo played in tandem and their chemistry in the attacking third spelt trouble for Luxembourg. In fact, Lukaku could have even completed his hat-trick if he had been a bit more clinical during a one-on-one with the keeper.

THE BIG LOSER

Luxembourg manager Luc Holtz never had a Plan B. They had a decent first half as they kept soaking up the pressure but against a fluent Belgian side, it was a tough task to do for the entire 90 minutes. And after Tedesco tweaked the formation a bit in the second half, his defence collapsed like a pack of cards.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Belgium won both their warm-up friendlies by a 2-0 margin and look geared up for the Euro 2024. They will begin their continental campaign against Slovakia on June 17 at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt.
