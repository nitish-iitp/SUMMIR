Papua New Guinea and Tahiti will battle for three points in an OFC Nations Cup Group B fixture on Tuesday. Papua New Guinea will be looking to register their first win of the tournament.

They suffered a harrowing 5-1 defeat to Fiji in their tournament opener on Saturday. Thomas Dunn scored a brace in the rout, Nabil Begg and Roy Krishna scored a goal each while Alwin Komolong scored an own goal. Tommy Semmy scored a late consolation strike with two minutes left on the clock.

Tahiti, meanwhile, started off the Nations Cup campaign with a routine 2-0 victory over Samoa. Mateo Degrumelle and Teaonui Tehau scored first-half goals to guide the Iron Warriors to victory.

Papua New Guinea vs Tahiti Prediction

Papua New Guinea were totally outclassed in their opening game of the Nations Cup and they are set to square off against a side they have historically struggled against.

Tahiti, for their part, are on the verge of qualifying for the knockout rounds and a win here would all but guarantee them a place in the semifinal. Samuel Garcia's side are on a fine run of form that has seen them win their last four games on the bounce.

We are backing Tahiti to claim a comfortable win in addition to a clean sheet.

Prediction: Papua New Guinea 0-3 Tahiti
