Stock market live updates: HFCs - Oct-Dec’23 Earnings Preview – Q3 to be softer than Q2 due to NIM contraction: Gaurav Jani - Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd

.For our coverage HFCs, AuM at Rs3.3trn could see 1.9% QoQ growth compared to 0.9% in Q1’24 and +7.5-9.0% (likely) in case of housing segment for banks. NIM could decline by 20bps QoQ to 3.17% as LICHF could see some moderation in margins. Hence NII may fall by 3.7% QoQ. As policy rates have stabilized, NIM for HFCs could improve in FY24E since asset repricing would be faster as compared to liabilities. Disbursal run-rate of LICHF is the key monitorable especially given weak credit flows in the last few quarters.

Other income might decline by 6% QoQ to Rs1.16bn while opex could rise by 7.3% QoQ to Rs4.75bn. Hence PPoP could dip by 5.9% QoQ to Rs21.9bn. We see a 6bps QoQ decline in provisions to 56bps as CANFIN would see credit costs normalize. PAT may fall by 5.0% QoQ to Rs13.9bn. CANFIN remains our preferred pick in HFCs.

Stock market live updates: Oil & Gas sector Q3 results preview by Swarnendu Bhushan - Co-Head of Research, Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.

Weak operating results anticipated

Indian Oil & Gas sector’s operating profit is expected to decline by 24% QoQ to Rs861bn mainly on account of weak refining margins of OMCs. Upstream companies like ONGC and OIL India are expected to maintain production volumes and net crude realization of ~US$75/bbl post windfall tax. Similarly, gas realization will remain unchanged QoQ at US$6.5/mmBtu. IGL and MGL’s volumes are expected to grow 9%YoY and 7%YoY, while we build in a 31% YoY volume growth in Gujarat Gas due to remarkable growth in industrial volumes. We expect RIL’s O2C segment to report lower operating profits with decline in refining margins and weak petchem spreads. We build in steady telecom performance (+4%QoQ revenue growth) as we build in 2%QoQ ARPU growth; retail revenue growth is also expected to be steady. ONGC remains our top pick in the sector.

Stock market live updates: Oil & Gas sector analysis by Anand Rathi Research Team

“The Indian oil sector’s Q3 operating profit would have fallen 21% q/q to Rs562bn as OMCs’ performances were hit by inventory losses. ONGC and OIL are expected to report steady results given stable production volumes/realisations. GAIL is likely to report another strong quarter (transmission & LPG earnings) though we factor in lower gas trading earnings q/q. CGDs would report healthy volume growth; absence of price hikes would impact MGL. We prefer BPC and HPC as crude prices are likely to have been stable, and clarity on oil & gas realisation/volume recovery would have driveen ONGC and OIL. We like MGL given much-needed volume recovery expected, which would drive a re-rating”

Stock market live updates: Here's what Gaurav Jani - Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, said about the outlook for the banking sector

“Banks under are expected to witness a weak quarter, as core earnings could fall by 7.3% QoQ to Rs463bn (vs +0.1% QoQ in Q2’24), mainly driven by reduction in NIM. Loan growth might come in at 3.8% QoQ (4.3% in Q2FY24), while deposit accretion could be +2.1% QoQ (3.9% last quarter). NIM contraction could moderate this quarter (vs Q2FY24) and we expect NIM to decline by 5bps QoQ (-16bps in Q2’24) to 3.62%. HDFCB, IIB and FB may see better NIM performance. Fees could grow by 3.1% QoQ to Rs333bn while opex may increase by 3.4% QoQ to Rs842bn (seasonality in case of PSU banks). Core PPoP may come in at Rs733bn (-0.4% QoQ). HDFCB, IIB and FB might do better on core PPoP. Led by KCC, gross slippage ratio might see a slight 3bps rise to 1.28% and we expect SBI, HDFCB, ICICIB, AXSB to report higher delinquencies. Banks’ PAT is expected to be Rs524bn (-8.7% QoQ). Among our coverage universe we prefer ICICIB and HDFCB.”

Stock market live updates: Here's what Suman Chowdhury, Chief Economist and Head –Research, Acuité Ratings & Research, said about Dec’23 PMI indices

Contrary to the sequential decline in the PMI Mfg, PMI Services witnessed an uptick. India’s services sector ended the year on a high note, with an uptick in business activity, led by a three-month high new order position.

New orders from abroad continued to grow with Indian service providers seeing higher demand in December from clients based in Australia, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and South America, the global slowdown notwithstanding. Employment in the sector rose slightly, at a faster rate than in November.

Services firms in India expect the strong demand momentum to carry forward to 2024 coupled with advertising and better customer relationships. The overall degree of business optimism was strong and better than that seen in November. On the prices front, input cost inflation for service providers fell to the lowest in 40 months in December. However, in a sign of improving corporate margins, prices charged to customers rose at a faster pace than the increase in input prices.

With the improved momentum in the PMI Services, the PMI Composite rose but the quarterly average for Q3FY24 was the lowest in the last four quarters.

Share market today: Analyst Gaurav Jani foresees robust growth in Asset Management Companies’ equity portfolios

Asset Management Companies - Gaurav Jani - Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.

Oct-Dec’23 Earnings Preview – Healthy growth in equity to protect profitability

Industry MAAuM as at Nov’23 stood at Rs48.75trn and equity/debt share was 51%/18%. Equity flows continue to remain strong; excluding NFOs, Oct’23 and Nov’23 combined, saw net flows of Rs394bn compared to Rs424.7bn in Q2FY24. Equity QAAuM growth is expected to be strong for FY24E as closing equity AuM (incl. balanced) has seen healthy YTD growth of 31% as at Nov’23. On the flipside, due to stronger AuM growth equity yields could fall more sharply owing to the TER structure.

We expect AMCs in our coverage to see overall/equity QAAuM growth of 4.1%/9.3% QoQ (vs 7.9%/10.1% in Q2FY24). Equity QAAuM growth for HDFC AMC would be superior to UTI AMC owing to stronger equity performance, while core income for our coverage AMCs could grow by 5.2% QoQ.

Stock market live updates: Itus Capital Equity Fund Factsheet - December 2023 is given below

“As we end the year in 2023, the fund generated a return of 25.35% in the year as against Nifty which had a 21.1% over the Calendar year.

At Itus, our fund has delivered an IRR since inception (Annualized) of 20.62% (net of fees) (Jan 17 – Dec 2023) as against Nifty which has delivered an IRR (Annualized) of 15.11% over the same period. This healthy outperformance of 5.5% (since inception CAGR) is net of fees and expenses.

In 2023, the fund has seen a churn rate of 20% where we have exited a few positions and reduced our exposure in small caps. Some part of the cash generated has been redeployed in select large caps in pharma, power, and capital goods. We continue to maintain cash across portfolios and be prudent around deployment.

The portfolio has shown a strong growth in earnings in the last year, with the last year’s cash flow growing at 19.2% on a portfolio basis. The Return on capital has been consistent at 21% and we expect this trend to continue within the portfolio. We do not run a benchmark-based fund at Itus, which means, we will deviate significantly from the index and sector weights and invest in businesses where we find growth and the ability to grow market share – with this regard, the portfolio continues to be underweight financial.”

On the global front, Wall Street is coming off its first losing week as mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple underperformed, and Treasury yields rose. In the US, market participants are now turning their attention to the upcoming inflation data and significant bank earnings set to be released later in the week. Meanwhile, the Asian markets fell today after a surprise jump in US non-farm payrolls saw markets rethink expectations for early interest rate cuts, with the focus now turning to a string of key inflation readings this week. 

On the commodity front, Oil prices gained on Friday, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to visit the Middle East to try and prevent the Israel-Gaza conflict from widening. 

Over the weekend, China announced sanctions on five US defence-related companies in response to sanctions on Chinese companies and arms sales to Taiwan.

Stock Market Live Today: OPENING BELL: Sensex and Nifty open positively, analysts forecast shift to large-cap stocks

On Monday, India’s leading indices, the Sensex and Nifty, began positively, with the 30-share BSE Sensex rising 81.20 points to reach 72,107.34 in early trading. The NSE Nifty also saw an increase, gaining 20.65 points to hit 21,731.45. 

According to analysts, bulls now lack strength as the market already discounts all the positives. According to analysts, corporate results and global trends will keep the market active, and with mid-and small-cap stocks turning expensive on the valuation front, the focus will shift to large-cap stocks.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “As valuations are getting expensive, investors are taking exposure to select frontline stocks with focus shifting to corporate earnings season.”

VK Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services noted December’s market surge aligned with FPI inflows hitting Rs 66,134 crores. 2023 saw Rs 1,71,106 crores FPI flows due to declining US bond yields. He anticipates further FPI investments in 2024, expecting a rise in debt inflows, potentially accelerating indices with a focus on large-caps.

Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President, Master Capital Services Ltd, said: The market will react to the domestic and global macroeconomic data, global bond yield, crude oil inventories, movement of the dollar index, and FII and DII investment activities.

However, experts said the underlying tone remains strong, thanks to India’s robust economic activity.

On GDP numbers, Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head - Research and Outreach, ICRA Ltd.. “The Advance Estimates released by the NSO peg GDP growth in FY2024 at 7.3%, much higher than our estimate of 6.5%. The NSO expects the GDP growth to moderate to 7.0% in H2 FY2024 from 7.7% in H1 FY2024. Surprisingly, the estimated GVA growth of 6.9% for FY2024 implies that growth in this metric has been assumed at 6.2% in H2, significantly lower than the imputed GDP number for this period.

“In our view, the growth assumed for H2 FY2024 is quite high, given the tepid outlook for agriculture amidst the weak kharif output and ongoing lag in rabi sowing, as well as the feared temporary slowdown in capex ahead of the General Elections. In fact, the GoI’s capex declined by 8.8% YoY during October-November 2023 after rising by 43.1% in H1 FY2024,” she added.

Shrey Jain, Founder and CEO SAS Online - India’s Deep Discount Broker Looking ahead, it is anticipated that the Nifty will trade within the range of 21,500 to 21,850 in the upcoming trading sessions. As for the bank Nifty, a short-term perspective suggests an upside target of 49,500.

Despite the index reflecting a lack of enthusiasm due to neutral domestic sentiments, there is a discernible shift in the mood toward individual stocks as the market approaches the results season.

Stock Market Live Today: India News Highlights

1)India’s foreign exchange reserves ballooned by $2.759 billion to touch $623.20 billion for the week ending on December 29, revealed the latest data by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday.

2)Central Bank of India has reported a 14.91 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth in its gross advances at Rs 2.4 trillion at the end of December 2023 (Q3FY24), up from Rs 2.08 trillion a year ago.

3)The Indian economy is expected to grow by 7,3% in the current financial year, according to the first advance estimate released by the National Statistical Office. This is higher than the previous government forecast of around 7%, which was due to the Reserve Bank of India’s revision of its GDP estimates.

4)Investments by foreign portfolio investors (FPI) in debt instruments turned positive in 2023 after three years due to attractive yields and the upcoming inclusion of Indian bonds in JPMorgan’s index, experts said. FPI investment in debt stood at Rs 68,663 crore in 2023 compared to Rs 15,911 crore of outflows in 2022, according to data from the National Securities Depository Ltd.

5)According to the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, India’s manufacturing PMI fell to 54.9 in December from 56 in November and 55.5 in October. The December value is the lowest since October 2022, when the reading came in at 55.3.

6)UPI numbers in 2023 touched a new high with cumulative volume at 117.6 billion and value at Rs 183 trillion, up 59 per cent and 45 per cent compared to 2022.

7)The Reserve Bank of India has tweaked norms for the issuance of commercial papers (CPs) and non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of up to one year to regulate short-term investments and ensure transparency in the market.

One of the key changes, slated to take effect from April 1 this year, was that the guidelines mandate issuers to mention the exact end use of the funds raised through these instruments, excluding financing for current assets and operating expenses. The settlement period was capped at T+4, which means the transactions need to be settled within four days from the trade date. Individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) were restricted to investing a maximum of 25 per cent of their total income. The guidelines specify that redemptions (repayment of the invested amount) need to be made before 3 pm on the maturity date.

8)Insurance companies have been granted permission by their regulator to invest in infrastructure debt funds (IDF) of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). This decision follows a recent review of the regulatory framework for IDF-NBFCs by the Reserve Bank of India, assigning these funds a more significant role in financing infrastructure projects. Previously, insurers were permitted to invest in IDFs backed by the central government on a case-by-case basis.

9)Goods and services tax (GST) collection in December declined to a three-month low due to economic activities winding down after Diwali but remained elevated at Rs 1.65 trillion. The growth rate year-on-year fell to a three-month low of 10.3 percent over Rs 1.49 trillion in December 2022-23.

10)Foreign portfolio investors net bought Indian equities, which includes both primary and secondary markets, worth Rs 1.77 lakh crore in 2023. This was the highest-ever inflow from FPIs in history, in rupee terms.

11)Jet fuel or ATF prices were slashed by 4 per cent on Monday, marking the third consecutive monthly reduction in prices. In contrast, the price for commercial cooking gas (LPG) was reduced marginally by Rs 1.50 per 19-kg cylinder, keeping in line with international benchmarks.

12)As the central government prepares for the interim budget for the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), insiders familiar with the deliberations suggest that fiscal discipline will take precedence over populist spending or incentives in the run-up to the general elections in the summer, according to The Economic Times (ET).

13)On 03 January, 2024, REC inked an initial pact with Bank of Baroda (BoB) to jointly offer finance for power, infrastructure and logistics projects in India. The company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the presence of senior representatives from both the organisations.

14)India’s fiscal deficit for the first eight months of this fiscal year through November stood at 9.07 lakh crore rupees, or 50.7% of annual estimates, government data showed today. The fiscal deficit narrowed from 58.9% reported in the comparable year-earlier period.

15)Retail inflation for industrial workers rose marginally to 4.98 per cent in November against 4.45 per cent seen a month earlier in October this year, owing to surging prices of certain food items, data from the labour ministry revealed.

Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations: Emkay Global on Building Materials - Q3FY24 preview: Volume trajectory improves

We anticipate demand for wood panel companies to improve in Q3FY24. The Plywood segment is likely to log a mid-single-digit YoY growth, while the MDF segment would register low double-digit volume growth in Q3FY24. Timber prices remain largely stable in the North, albeit staying elevated in the South. In general, we estimate sequential margin improvement (in the range of 60-70bps) for our coverage companies. With implementation of BIS norms w.e.f. Feb-24, MDF imports are likely to slow down; the implementation will also help market-share gains from the low-end plywood segment. Besides, growing possibility of reduction in timber prices, especially from FY26E, with rise in plantations in the past few years is likely to partially address margin concerns in the sector. We continue to favor Century Ply and Greenpanel Industries in the wood panel space, given their leadership position, strong brand patronage, growth visibility and healthy balance sheet. We will soon review our estimate and target price for our coverage stocks.

Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations: Motilal Oswal FInancial on AUTOMOBILES 3QFY24 PREVIEW: Gross margin to contract sequentially as RM prices inch up

The third quarter witnessed healthy demand across the segments, as volumes are expected to grow 18% YoY. The 2Ws outperformed other segments and is likely to rise ~20% YoY. Volumes for 3Ws, PV, and CV are likely to improve ~15%, 12%, and 3% YoY, respectively, while the same should decline 4% YoY for tractors. Overall exports are anticipated to recover gradually as the supply chain situation improves further, followed by improving macro outlook in key geographies.

- Commodity prices have remained favorable over the last few quarters. Inflationary pressures peaked in 3QFY23, following which, prices corrected for most of the commodities. Despite a slight increase in some of the RM prices sequentially, we expect gross margin to improve ~100bp YoY for our OEM coverage universe in 3QFY24.

- We estimate EBITDA margin to improve YoY for the seventh successive quarter, with a 160bp YoY gain (+40bp QoQ) for our Auto OEM Universe (ex-JLR). This will be driven by better gross margin, cost efficiencies, and operating leverage. The benefit of healthy growth in underlying industries coupled with cost efficiencies should also result in strong earnings growth for our Ancillary coverage during the quarter.

- There has not been any material change in the FY24 earnings estimate for our coverage universe. We are already witnessing a reversal in demand patterns, especially in the 2Ws, wherein we anticipate a high growth potential. As compared to other categories, 2Ws have a relatively better scope for growth over FY23-26E. On the other hand, we turn cautious about the PV growth outlook due to a slowdown in demand trends and a high base

Stock Market Live Today: Stock Recommendations: Emkay Global on Marico

We have a REDUCE call on Marico due to its inability to drive structural growth in the domestic business; however, better margin prospects have been aiding double-digit earnings growth. Consol. revenue is likely to see a 1% dip with a 1% drop in India business (~1.5% volume growth) and flat international sales. In the domestic business, supply-chain issues continue to mar performance, while in the international business, weak macros are hurting performance. Sustained supply-chain hiccups in the domestic business are bothering, given lower rural and general trade dependence. Consol. EBITDA margin delivery is likely to be strong (>225bps to 20.7%), which will aid double-digit EBITDA (>11% YoY) and earnings (>10%) growth YoY. We maintain REDUCE with Sep-24 TP of Rs570, based on 42x its P/E (in-line with its last 5yr avg. fwd. P/E)

Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations:  Aviation: Quarterly Preview by Elara Securities

PAT remains strong but demand slows

Combined PAT at INR 17.6bn in Q3FY24E

We expect our aviation coverage universe – InterGlobe Aviation (INDIGO IN) and SpiceJet (SJET IN) – to report a combined adjusted PAT of INR 17.6bn in Q3FY24E vs INR 4.2bn in Q2FY24 and INR 22.3bn in Q3FY23. As per Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) data, Q3FY24 domestic demand was up 9% YoY while domestic capacity was up ~11% YoY, which led to a 2% fall in airfare. FY25 may continue to see robust demand growth of 15% if airlines keep airfares under check, but competition comes from 1) INR 22.5bn equity infusion in SJET, 2) interest shown by three bidders, including SJET, to revive the grounded GoFirst (Not Listed) airline, 3) pilot shortage issues behind for Akasa Air (Not Listed), and 4) capacity growth by Tata Group airlines.

Stock Market Live Today: FPIs poised for increased purchases in 2024: VK Vijayakumar of Geojit

V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.

“The sharp up move in the market in December coincided with the surge in FPI inflows during the month which stood at Rs 58372 crores. Including the investment through the primary market and others the December FPI inflows stood at Rs 66134 crores. The last two months of 2023 has witnessed big investment by FPIs thanks to the sharp decline in US bond yields and declining dollar. FPI inflows which were negative in the 3 months before December have sharply turned positive in December. The total FPI flows for 2023 stood at Rs 171106 crores (Source: NSDL). In December, FPIs were big buyers in financial services and also in IT. FPIs also bought in sectors like autos, capital goods, oil and gas and telecom. 

Since 2024 is expected to witness further declines in U.S. interest rates, FPIs are likely to increase their purchases in 2024 too, particularly in the early months of 2024 in the run up to the General elections. FPI inflows into debt will also see acceleration in 2024. 

FPI inflows can help accelerate the uptrend in the main bench mark indices since bulk of the FPI flows will be into large-caps.”

Stock Market Live Today: Pravesh Gour of Swastika Investmart on Market outlook

Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart Ltd. on Market outlook

All eyes will be on the beginning of corporate performance for the third quarter of the current fiscal year (Q3 FY24), spanning from November to December. The anticipation is particularly high for India’s IT giants. TCS and Infosys released their Q3 results on January 11th, followed by HCL Tech and Wipro on the 12th. Market participants will be keeping an eye on the movement of the rupee against the dollar and crude oil prices. Investments by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) will also be monitored.

The Nifty is consolidating in the 21500–21800 range with intraday volatility. If it slips below 21500, then the 20-DMA of 21400 will be immediate support; only below this can we expect any meaningful profit booking. If it manages to sustain above the 21800 mark, then 22000 and 22200 will be the next target levels.

Banknifty is respecting its 20-DMA around the 47800 mark. On the upside, 48500–48800 is acting as an immediate supply zone; above this, we can expect a move towards the 49500–50000 level. If it slips below 20-DMA, then 47000 will be the key support level.

FII’s long exposure in index futures remains at 67%, accompanied by a put-call ratio of 1.08, both indicating a neutral to positive market sentiment.

Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations: Emkay Global on Media & Entertainment: Q3FY24 Preview: A muted quarter

After an exceptional performance in Q2FY24, box office collections moderated in Q3, with a strong showing by select movies in the second half of the quarter. A few big-budget Bollywood movies did well in the quarter, ably supported by select regional movies, while Hollywood fell short of the mark this quarter. For broadcasters, growth is likely to be impacted by the Cricket World Cup in the first half of the quarter which resulted in diversion of advertising spends. However, the festive season should aid some sequential growth. Subscription revenue should stay stable.

Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations: Emkay Global on Insurance - Q3 Preview: Expect a modest show; FY25 outlook remains key

Insurance stocks are currently exposed to a motley of divergent influences, including: 1) moderating growth and margin of life insurers in the previous as well as the upcoming quarter; 2) constant noise around regulatory changes, including surrender charges, mis-selling and claims repudiation; 3) besides the near-term uncertainty, the structural growth story of Insurance in India—led by rising affluence and the lack of protection & longevity cover—being very much intact; and 4) the sector’s attractive valuation (against the backdrop of its own historical trend and relative to other sectors) supporting share prices. We continue to prefer players with strong brand, distribution & cost advantages, which give them the right to grow profitably. We maintain our preference for SBILIFE (Buy), HDFCLIFE (Add), and ICICIGI (Add). LICI (Buy) is our valuation pick.

January 08, 2024 08:07
Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations: Emkay Global on Logistics - Sound performance amid lofty expectations

We expect healthy top-line growth for our coverage companies in Q3FY23 buoyed by festive season demand (the entire season captured in Q3 this year against being spread across Q2-Q3 in last FY) with integrated logistics players like Delhivery benefitting from sector tailwinds in both B2C and B2B express markets. Data on freight movement via road was supported by channel checks; however, it tempers down expectations laid by the managements after an uptick seen in volumes in Oct-23 for >15% YoY volume growth in Q3. Margins should see a sequential uptick in a benign fuel price environment and operating leverage kicking in. Management commentary on volume recovery remains critical post a muted H1FY24 performance. We roll forward our target prices to Dec-24 and retain our previous ratings on Delhivery (BUY; TP: Rs470/share), VRL Logistics (BUY; TP: Rs 875/share), TCI Express (ADD; TP: Rs1,550/share), and Blue Dart Express (REDUCE; TP: Rs7,350/share).

January 08, 2024 08:07
Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations: Emkay Global on Telecommunications

In Q3FY24, we expect Bharti Airtel and Jio Mobile to register revenue growth of 2.5-3% QoQ. RJio will benefit from industry-leading subscriber addition in Q3 (10.5mn), aided by competitive pricing of its plans, while Airtel will benefit from the mix of subscriber addition and conversion of 2G subscribers (to 4G). Vi is likely to lose subscribers. Bharti’s focus on rural and 5G rollout is likely to aid Indus’s tower/tenancy addition. For Indus Towers, the trajectory of receivables/provisioning remains the key monitorable. Tata Communications (TCom) is likely to maintain revenue growth in data, while its margin may come under pressure post Kaleyra’s acquisition.

January 08, 2024 08:06
Stock Market Live Today: Sectoral Recommendations: Emkay Global Financial on : Consumer Goods - Demand recovery eludes Q3FY24

Given the weak winter and slow recovery in rural demand, Q3FY24 is likely to be lackluster for FMCG plays, from the topline viewpoint. We expect competition from small players in select categories to ebb, as large players have embarked on corrective measures. The international show is likely to be better, on a constant currency basis, though currency will limit reported growth. Gross margin is likely to expand YoY, but EBITDA margin expansion would be limited due to weak operating leverage and higher A&P spends. In India business, we see a low-to-mid single-digit volume growth. Overall, in our coverage, Colgate is likely to report better results (sales/earnings growth at 7%/21%), while HUL (sales/earnings growth at 3%/1%) and GCPL (sales/earnings growth at +1%/-1%) would be the weakest. Dabur (+9%, sales driven) and Marico (+10%, margin driven) are likely to clock better earnings growth. Our report highlights the rollover of our TP to Dec-24 from Sep-24 earlier. We downgrade our rating for Britannia to REDUCE (from Add) and GCPL to ADD (from Buy). We prefer Dabur, ITC, and Emami, while avoiding Colgate

Stock Market Live Today: Adani Wilmar records 6% volume growth, 15% revenue drop in Q3 FY23

​Adani Wilmar,​ during the quarter ended December 2023, recorded overall volume growth of 6 per cent, however, lower pricing of edible oils in line with the fall in the cost of raw materials (crude edible oils), resulted in a revenue decline of 15 per cent YoY. In both Oil and Foods, branded products account for around 80 per cent of the business and have been growing at a faster rate. With the easing of the global edible oil prices, our branded edible oils volume growth has been strong during the year, with 4 per cent YoY growth during the quarter and 16% YoY growth in 9M FY’24. However, for the overall edible oils segment, volume stayed flat YoY in Q3 FY’24 due to subdued demand from institutional clients and registered a growth of 9% YoY in 9M FY’24.

Macroeconomics with interest rates as the overriding element will obviously dominate short-term concerns but other strategic shifts such as an acceleration in the growth of private credit, ongoing global power shifts, and the widespread deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) will determine the investments in the new year, said MSCI’s Chief Research Officer Ashley Lester in a blog post ‘Investment Trends in Focus: Five Key Themes for 2024.’

“We expect banks to report muted operating profit growth in Q3FY24, on lower NII and higher opex, even as the sequential pace of NIM decline moderates. Repricing of term deposits will continue to drive funding costs higher. Credit costs should remain benign,” Axis Capital said in a note.

At 20.2x, the Nifty’s price to earnings multiples have been higher on only 8 per cent of days over the past 18 years. The market’s valuation premium to its historical average is the highest recorded among the 19 largest global markets and India is no longer the EPS growth leader that it has been for the past three years. India’s valuation premium to China, for instance, is close to 14-year highs. The brokerage’s proprietary India bull/bear index has had an extended 95 per cent bullish sentiment reading as well.
