SHOW LOW — Show Low Police responded early Thursday to a two-car collision on State Route 77 near Pintail Lake Road near milepost 344 between Show Low and Snowflake-Taylor.

Tyler Turner, 23, of Show Low, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Tammy Dowdy, 45, hometown unknown, was taken to Summit Healthcare with non-life threatening injuries.

The accident occurred between 5:30-6 a.m. Highway 77 was shut down from the intersection of 77 and U.S. 60 to Lone Pine Dam Road until just before 9 a.m. to allow police to conduct the investigation.

Motorists driving into Show Low from Snowflake-Taylor on SR 77 were detoured to SR 260 via Lone Pine Dam Road until the highway reopened.

Dowdy was reportedly traveling southbound on SR 77 toward Show Low in an orange Ford Edge when Turner, traveling northbound in the southbound lane in a green Chevrolet Cavalier, ran head-on into Dowdy at high speed. Witnesses told police Dowdy braked suddenly, causing the rear of her vehicle to lift completely off the ground, spin out into the road before Turner struck her.

“Witnesses said Dowdy’s vehicle was struck head-on by the Chevy Cavalier, driven by Turner, which was driving north in southbound traffic. Witnesses told officers they never saw a vehicle driving northbound on Highway 77 in the northbound lane. Turner was killed instantly. Highway 77 was closed for accident-scene investigation and both vehicles were towed from the scene. The cause of the crash remains under investigation,” a press release from Show Low City Clerk Ann Kurasaki stated.
