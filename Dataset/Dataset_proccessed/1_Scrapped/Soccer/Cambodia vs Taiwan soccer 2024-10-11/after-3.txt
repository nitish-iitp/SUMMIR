Despite a slow start, Rock Bridge bulldozed Battle 49-12 on Friday night at Battle to clinch its second consecutive Central Missouri Activities Conference championship.

For the majority of the night, Rock Bridge senior quarterback Brady Davidson did not air it out. Instead, the Northern Illinois commit operated from the shotgun, relying on a quick release to establish momentum. Screens, posts and short outs defined the team’s aerial attack.
