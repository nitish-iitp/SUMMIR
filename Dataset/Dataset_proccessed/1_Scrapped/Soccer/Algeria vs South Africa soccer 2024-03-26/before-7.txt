Somalia Football National Team History

The Somalia Football National Team’s origins are closely linked with the nation’s history and aspirations. Football was introduced in Somalia during the 1940s amidst the country’s struggle against colonization. The sport’s organized form began with the formation of a local team by the Somali Youth League (SYL), a leading political party, to compete against Italian exile teams. The establishment of the Somali Football Federation (SFF) in 1951, followed by the appointment of the first Somali national as the commissioner for sport in 1958, marked significant steps in formalizing football in Somalia.

 

Despite participating in preliminary matches, the Somalia Football National Team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. The team’s efforts were further hindered by political instability and the outbreak of civil war in the early 1990s, forcing them to play FIFA-sanctioned matches in foreign countries. However, the passion for football in Somalia remained undiminished. Following the pacification of Mogadishu in 2011, efforts were renewed to reintegrate the team into the international soccer community.

 

Somalian Football has continued its journey passionately towards improvements over the years. After a decent amount of struggles and obstacles, Somalia finally defeated Kenya 1-0 to win its first-ever Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match in almost four decades. Similarly, the Ocean Stars defeated Zimbabwe in the World Cup qualifiers, showing where the trajectory of Somalian Football is heading and indicating exciting times ahead.

 

During this journey, notable players have greatly supported them and left their imprints on the game. Some of these individuals include Mohamed Shangole, the team’s inaugural captain and Hasan Babay, who served as its captain for the longest time in history. Other standout figures include Liban Abdi, Ayub Daud, and Abdisalam Ibrahim, whose prowess and achievements have earned them recognition both locally and globally. These players epitomize what Somali Football stands for – tenacity and persistence – thus being the perfect role models for the younger generations.

 

Somalia is currently ranked 198th in the FIFA Rankings. However, Faid Ilmi has been appointed as the head coach to change the fortunes of the team, and Ahmed Said Ahmed takes charge as the captain. Expectations are high for the duo, and under the Ilmi-Ahmed era, one anticipates the team progressing beyond their current position. With a crucial 2024 on the horizon, it will be a significant test for this duo and the new era of Somali football.
