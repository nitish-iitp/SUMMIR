Poland beat Ukraine but injured Milik ruled out of Euros
ByReuters
Jun 7, 2024, 11:07 pm

Poland's 3-1 win over an experimental Ukraine side on Friday was overshadowed by an injury to striker Arkadiusz Milik that has ruled him out of Euro 2024.

Milik went down with a knee injury in the second minute of the game, and was assisted off the pitch by medical staff. Poland manager Michal Probierz confirmed afterwards that his Euro chances were over.

All four goals on Friday came in the opening half, with Sebastian Walukiewicz poking home his first goal for Poland in his first international game since 2020 and Piotr Zielinski doubled the home side's lead with a shot from distance.

Poland were 3-0 up after the half hour mark when Taras Romanczuk headed in from a corner, before Artem Dovbyk pulled one back for the visitors three minutes before the break.

Ukraine named a completely different starting side to the one which drew 0-0 with Germany on Monday, manager Serhiy Rebrov using the opportunity to look at as many players as possible before the Euros.

Poland coach Michal Probierz left goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and striker Robert Lewandowski, certain starters in Germany, on the bench, giving the likes of Milik a chance to impress, but the Juventus forward's game came to a premature end.

Poland will play their last warm-up match before the Euros against Turkey on Monday, while Ukraine finish their preparations with a game against Moldova on Tuesday.

Ukraine are in Group E in Germany together with Belgium, Slovakia and Romania, while Poland will face France, the Netherlands and Austria in Group D.
