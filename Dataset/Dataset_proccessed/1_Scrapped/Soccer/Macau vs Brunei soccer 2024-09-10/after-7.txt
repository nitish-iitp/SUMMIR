Brunei have one foot in the next round

Brunei visit the Estádio Campo Desportivo in Taipa on Tuesday to face Macau for the second leg of their clash in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifier playoffs. The side are looking to get the job done after picking up a big win at home in the first leg earlier this week.

The Wasps prevailed 3-0 in a clinical display. Muhammad Said opened their account in the 32nd minute which had them 1-0 up at the break. Following the interval, Mohammad Nazry doubled their advantage just before the hour mark while Abdul Hariz made it 3-0 shortly after.

Ranked 190th in the world, Jamie McAllister's side have one foot in the next round of the qualifiers, unless they spectacularly implode away from home. But their recent form suggests they could be headed for another win, as Brunei have won their last four in a row, breathing new life after a run of four consecutive losses since last year.

On the other hand, the Lotus' Team have an uphill battle to keep their progression hopes alive. But here's the catch: They haven't scored four goals in a game since November 2016 and haven't won by a four-goal margin since July 2012.

Macau vs Brunei Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been five clashes between the sides in history, with Macau winning four times and losing once.
The Lotus' Team had a 100% win record against the Wasps before the 3-0 loss on Friday. It was also the first time that the latter scored more than once in the fixture.
They need to win by four goals here, which they haven't since July 2012 (5-1 vs Nothern Mariana Islands) and haven't scored four goals in a game since November 2016 (4-1 vs Laos).
The Lotus' Team have not scored a goal in any of their last four official games. The Wasps are on a four-game winning run right now.
Macau vs Brunei Prediction

Brunei are the form team here, winning their last four in a row in what's been their best run in a while. The Wasps also broke the jinx to win this fixture for the first time this week, and we're betting on them to back it up with a second consecutive victory on Tuesday.

Prediction: Macau 0-2 Brunei
