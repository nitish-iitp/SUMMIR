A Global Economic Boycott of Israel Gains Traction, but the Government Has No Answers

The world is losing patience with Israel's conduct in the Gaza war and taking steps – restricting exports, canceling professional confabs, backing down on planned business transactions and so on. Local consumers will suffer

The current Israeli government doesn't have a single accomplishment to its credit, only a long series of failures and damage inflicted on every possible front: diplomatic, security, economic and social. When the prime minister, the finance minister and the economy minister are asked what they are doing, say, to curb the appalling cost of living, they mumble something about the "what's good for Europe is good for Israel" reform, which will make it possible to rely on European standards without subjecting goods imported from the Continent to a bureaucratic Via Dolorosa.

Netanyahu wants to shut us down. Read Haaretz now.

We know the one answer that will prevent us to go ever more into Pariah State Apartheid Southafricanizaion Status:
Allow for an effective Palestine independent State on the basis of the 1967 borders with is even less than 22% of their ancient homeland.

Long, long overdue. Had this been done 76 years ago and continuing apartheid Israel may not have committed so many atrocities ending with a genocide.

You mean Egypt militarily occupied Gaza and Jordan militarily occupied the West Bank? Or when your own beloved Pakistan was brutally slaughtering millions of Bengalis in what was then "East Pakistan?" Do you mean when Iraqi Muslims slaughtered hundreds of their Jewish neighbors in the Farhud? Or do you mean when they and the Syrians and Egyptians stripped all their Jewish citizens of their statehood and stole all their property? Do you mean when those same countries refused to resettle a single Palestinian refugee or give them legal status because it would "hurt the cause," or do you mean when every Western country shut their borders with immigration quotas and sent ships full of Jews fleeing the Holocaust back to Germany? Just so we're clear, you are saying the quiet part out loud.

No, he is talking about the crimes that Israel has committed.
Certainly Israel is not the only sinner in this world, but here it is the one being discussed, and seeking to change the topic makes nothing better.

All the disbarred lawyer that initiated this thread ever does, in this post and in every other over the years, is seek to delegitimize the existence of a Jewish state when he sets the benchmark at its foundation. To which my question is: what would have happened to all the aforementioned Jews if they didn't have the safe haven that is Israel? Tell me yourself, what would have happened to the millions of refugees that survived the Holocaust and were left stateless and surrounded by people who had just murdered their entire families? What would have happened to the Jews who fled for their lives from Iraq and Syria if they had no place else to go?
This is not about "whataboutism," as you are misleadingly trying to imply; this is about direct cause and effect.
In 1934 there were 16 million Jews in the world, after the Holocaust there were 10 million, and today there are 15 million, half of which live in Israel.
No one is changing the topic but you.

"To which my question is: what would have happened to all the aforementioned Jews if they didn't have the safe haven that is Israel?"
An interesting hypothetical, to which the answer is - many would have remade lives in Europe, if not in their native countries, many others would have emigrated to America, South America, Australia etc where they would have made happy lives for themselves, integrated into societies where they would have lived these last 75 years free if threat and insecurity and unburdened by the guilt of having dispossessed, decimated and impoverished an entire indigenous population to achieve an unattainable goal of a life free of insecurity. Israel lives under a threat it itself has created, while Jews in the diaspora are secure and far happier.

Great job removing a comment that translated "DGM's" antisemitic subtext as a desire for Jews to either have been killed in order to "finish the job" or been subjected to the same multi-generational persecution that created the Holocaust and the pogroms in the first place, but leaving up every single one of the most antisemitic screeds you'll find outside the Daily Stormer.

The question asked was " what would have happened to all the aforementioned Jews if they didn't have the safe haven that is Israel?" I stated the obvious answer to the question: Israel was not the only place where they would have found safe haven. Zionist claims that there is nowhere for Jews to live safely except Israel is not true: Jews live happily & are vital members of nations worldwide. Your paranoid response & knee-jerk resort to accusations of anti-semitism & trying to have my response removed is demonstrative of Zionism's greatest offense to worldwide Jewry: it attempts to bind them to the nation of Israel with bonds of fear & insecurity that are completely unnecessary. Further, the security it promises is a chimaera. Jews in Israel have not found the peace & security that Zionism promised & have had to resort to increasing repression and violence to maintain it, which has damaged the psyche & souls of every Israeli, whether they admit it or not.
What safe place are you talking about?

Even beyond the Holocaust, where 1/3 of all Jews were murdered by 1945, are you saying Jews were safe everywhere and were just lying about antisemitism?
The Farhud didn't happen in Iraq 1941? The Tripolitania Massacre didn't happen in Libya 1945? The Kielce Pogrom didn't happen in Poland 1946? The Aleppo Massacre didn't happen in 1947 in Syria? There weren't decades of state antisemitism in the USSR? The United States just allowed every single person who came to the border to move there and become a citizen? I can go on for days on end. And nobody asked to take down your post, I asked why mine was taken down. You are deliberately twisting everything that anyone says to conform to an evil line of argument.
You are an antisemite, plain and simple, who is saying without saying "the world would be better off if they'd finished the job," using recycled Soviet talking points and rhetorical strategies from the 1960s, and are dangerously close to outright Holocaust denial.

"This newspaper", "Haaretz" (and many of its journalists) are among the few good things seen in the state of Israel.
Even in Israel not everything is bad, but the government, the IDF and the feeling of entitlement among (according to surveys) of the majority of Jewish Israelis are all bad, very bad indeed.

The only booming business is the cemetery business. I see in the Haredi weeklies, published in the U.S., that so many American Haredim after their deaths have their bodies shipped to Israel for burial.
Some of their favorite Israeli cemeteries are Har HaMenuchot and Har Hazeitim (Mount of Olives), both in Jerusalem, and in the town of Beit Shemesh.
No wonder tiny Israel has so few parks and is becoming so crowded.

Arab Muslims have slaughtered half a million Black Muslims in Darfur with their bare hands, Arab Muslims buy and sell hundreds of thousands Black Muslims as slaves in Mauretania, that Saudi Arabia has massacred tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians at weddings and birthday parties, and that Assad has intentionally targeted tens of thousands of Muslims with barrel bombs and nerve gas.
When you ignore the fact that Hamas even exists and pretend like Israel just woke up one day and decided to just start bombing Gaza for fun, that all 36,000 casualties are civilians, and that October 7 was either justified or never happened, that is what is called a "double standard," where you disproportionately single out the only Jewish state in the world and grossly mischaracterize the entire situation and its history to fit your narrative, and is antisemitic by definition.

Again, more misdirect. Why not defend the actual critiques of the Israeli State's behavior over the last 8 mo. and over decades of brutal occupation of a people on the land of their origin. As your diatribe on the inherent barbarism of arabs and muslims seems to suggest, one could be led to believe a whole host of assumptions about your world view as being of a supremacist bent and with a real lack of universal values. I for one, beleive in the right for Israelis, Jews and Palestinians, Arabs and non-arabs to live equally on the land, however that can be drawn up. We all have agency to help make the future better than the past.
It's not a misdirect the double standard is a fact

Where are the protests against Egypt for stationing their tanks on the border with Gaza, saying they "are willing to sacrifice millions?" Where are the protests against Egypt's 20 year blockade of Gaza? Where are the protests against Egypt refusing to allow aid through Rafah? Where are the protests against Egypt for refusing to let a single Gazan seek refuge without charging $5,000 a head in human trafficking? Where are the protests against PRC's genocide of the Uyghurs? Where are the protests against Myanmar's genocide of the Rohingya? Where are the protests against the Azerbaijani ethnic cleansing of Nagorno Karabakh? Where are the protests against Russia's genocide of Ukrainians?
When you ignore far larger, unprovoked, indiscriminate, and unquestionably targeted killing of civilians by the regimes who are the most vocal critics of Israel and the progenitors of most of your talking points, you are either a useful idiot or a willing accomplice in spreading your blood libel.

You mean Egypt's 20 year blockade of Gaza that was coordinated with Israel?
By that logic, shouldn't you be glad about every tunnel below the Egypt/Gazan border that's tolerated by Egypt as a display of humanitarian compassion?

Yes, I actually agree with you that you can criticize the conduct of the arab neighbours and specifically Egypt (Then again, Jordan did take in many millions of palestinian refugees and naturalized them. That almost led to a coup by the Fatah in Jordan).
On the other hand, in the context of criticism of Israel it really sounds like cheap whatapoutism. The root cause of the conflict is still the occupation - and, yes, the existence of the State of Israel in its current form at its current location and the history of its creation. You can't just violently take over someone else's house and then complain the neighbours don't clean up your mess for you.

Noel, you are right. The following remarks are addressed to those who try to distract from the topic on the table.
People who criticise Russia, and there are plenty of reasons to do so, are not therefore anti-Christian.
People who criticise Myanmar, and there are enough reasons to do so, are not therefore anti-Buddhism.
People who criticise India, and there are enough reasons to do so, are not therefore enemies of Hinduism.
People who criticise Saudi Arabia, and there are enough reasons to do so, are not therefore anti-Islam.
People who criticise their own country, and there are often enough reasons to do so, are not therefore traitors.
Why is criticising Israel, even though there are plenty of reasons to do so, repeatedly equated with anti-Semitism? The callers should look in the mirror and amend their ways.
What is special about anti-Semitism? Real not imagined anti-Semitism is to be condemned, but are not all the other antis a.k.a. bigotry not just as despicable?

Who started the cycle of violence?

And who sanctifies it as the only means of problem solving? The first act of internecine violence was when an paranoid mob of angry Palestinians, ginned up on antisemitic conspiracy theories, committed a completely unprovoked massacre of Jewish residents of Jaffa in 1921, murdering them in their own homes. It was in direct response to this and Hebron that Jews started forming self-defense leagues.
Moreover, every other national liberation movement of the 20th century, whether it be Civil Rights in the US, Indian independence from Great Britain or the end of Apartheid in South Africa, reached their goals by nonviolent civil disobedience, which were the overriding characteristics of those movements, and why their leaders were given the Nobel Peace Prize. The Palestinians and their allies in the Arab League, on the other hand, have only ever used violence as their first and only tool to achieve an end in the last century, through invasion, suicide bombings and school shootings.

I didn't know I was 150 years old, let alone that every Jew alive today is a proxy for whatever bogeyman of the past you're demonizing at the moment. That's not at all antisemitic to assume I'm Jewish and then accuse an individual you know nothing about and have never met, of being a stand-in for an entire group of people.
Do you accuse random West Africans of being single-handedly responsible for the Atlantic slave trade? Do you accuse random Asians of being responsible for COVID? Do you accuse random Black people of being responsible for gang violence? Do you accuse random Hispanics of being Cartel pushers? Do you accuse random Germans of being single-handedly responsible for the Holocaust? Do you accuse random Russians of torturing, raping and murdering thousands of Ukrainian civilians?

Ok, I'll put it differently: Was there a movement among large parts of the jewish public at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century of establishing a jewish state in historic palestine or was there not?
You're right that it's wrong to blame every individual person of a group (or who sympathizes with that group) for actions of that group. (Oddly we easily seem to forget that with russians though)
That's indeed something the arabs and palestinians can be blamed for: Attacking and killing civilians and jewish persons who have no agency in the matter.
But to deny there had been a plan if taking over the land, even against the explicit wishes of the local population, when such a plan is well documented and even overtly continued today is ridiculous.

(And also don't seem to be particularly friendly towards the jews and jewish groups who actually distance themselves from Israel). And then of course neither the IDF nor the settlers care very much about attacking involved civilians either. 2/2

Was there, or was there not, a large pan-Arab nationalist movement, from Egypt to Arabia to Iraq, that intended to build a single unified Arab state, first as a Hashemite kingdom and later as a secular Nasserist one, after they gained independence from the Ottomans? Was it or was it not because the existence of a state with a few million Jews on a strip of land smaller than the state of New Jersey within a region the size of Europe would have been an unacceptable disruption in territorial contiguity for the half a billion residents of the Arab League? Was it or was it not the future Syrian armed forces who attacked the residents of Tel Hai unprovoked in 1920 because they were convinced the Jews were all French spies? Was it or was it not a Syrian national, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, who traveled from Beirut to Cairo to Gaza riling up and arming the populace against the Jews, and is now memorialized in the name of Hamas's military wing and the name of the street Shifa Hospital is on?
