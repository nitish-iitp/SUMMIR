Elliott takes 11% share in Southwest, demands leadership overhaul
DOWNLOAD

By Judson Rollins

June 10, 2024, © Leeham News: Hedge fund Elliott Investment Management announced yesterday that it has a $1.9bn position in Southwest Airlines, comprising 11% of the company’s shares. It issued a letter to the airline’s board, calling for new directors, a new CEO, more executives from outside, and a comprehensive business review.

In its letter, Elliott wrote, “While Southwest has a proud history, that history is not an argument for supporting poor leadership and sticking with a strategy that no longer succeeds in the modern airline industry.”

Source: Elliott Investment Management.

The announcement came as Southwest’s stock price remains near its April 2020 value, and management faces growing questions about excessive costs and middling unit revenue.

Elliott included with its letter a 51-slide presentation laying out its case for overhauling Southwest. One slide features a 2014 quote from founder and former CEO Herb Kelleher: “If things change faster outside your company than they change inside your company, you’ve got something to worry about.”

LNA has written extensively about Southwest’s fleet, customer, revenue, and cost issues:

Ryanair, Southwest, United take biggest hit from FAA cap on 737 MAX production
Southwest could solve its MAX 7 woes … by buying Breeze?
Southwest, the “legacy LCC,” part 1: Not keeping up with industry standards crimps unit revenue
Southwest, the “legacy LCC,” part 2: Bloated labor expense, difficult fleet strategy result in uncompetitive cost structure

The LNA team is in contact with Elliott and expects to publish a deeper analysis after speaking with the fund’s investment team.

Elliott: “… we are convinced that Southwest represents the most compelling airline turnaround opportunity in the last two decades.”

Mgmt response can be to postpone some capex like new aircraft and use the fund to buy back shares to appease the activist investor.

Putting all its money on an undeliverable (and controversy-plagued) Boeing model has been a large contributor to Southwest’s (recent) woes.

One wonders if the move by Elliott will precipitate some sort of fleet diversification. Forget the standard fleet commonality argument — being constricted by a paper-only fleet is worse.

Good point on fleet diversification……..maybe add A220 and A321XLR But can they find aircraft available? Since American and United are looking to encroach into Southwest routes, Southwest needs to expand into their markets

REPLY

They can always put in orders, and hope that slot availability will improve with time if other airlines defer/cancel (e.g. due to a market downturn and/or glut).

All their MAX orders can be canceled without penalty at this stage…might as well face up to the possibility that they’re never going to be delivered.

Another good point about “never to be delivered” Its about time Sir TC of the Emirates come to same conclusion on the 777x He keeps blaming Boeing but he doesn’t do anything different. So let’s refurnish old 777s and A380s…..so let’s fast forward 5 years….still no 777x..so refurbishment round 2 or do something different today and order some A350-1000s (“stupid is as stupid does”)

REPLY

At least TC has a foot in the door with his existing orders for 65 A350-900s…which he can (partially) upgrade to -1000s if/when he manages to get over his reticence regarding the RR XWB 97*. He can then cancel a huge portion of his 777X orders, without penalty.

In contrast, Southwest has no foot in any other door.

*Which is puzzling: he seems to have no reticence regarding the durability of the GE9X, despite a complete lack of real-world data for that engine.

@Abalone
Wild idea but if 777X gets cancelled could GE drop the GE9X on the the A350-1000?

@Casey, some customers would like engine option on A350-1000 but it would be a legal mountain to climb to make it happen. Maybe if Airbus made a stretch with a brand new wing A350-1200, still RR would fight to be single source.

TransWorld
June 10, 2024


Abalone clearly over states the case into outright wrong.

SW is getting jets delivered. Clearly at a lower rate than expected as are all MAX customers right now.

They are not getting the MAX-7 they want.

Clearly South West shot themselves in the foot with not diversifying the fleet. They could get Embraer E2 190/195 if nothing else. Certainly better economy wise than the MAX-7 which is heavy for the mission (shrunk -8)

All airlines will get deliveries, at some point they will ramp up to 38 and then 50. Not nearly as fast as Boeing assumed in Calhouns gross stupidity.

Longer term Boeing has issues. But they are not going under for the next 10 years. What its future looks like is not predicable.

Southwest is getting planes that it didn’t originally order (conversions through lack of other options).

Of the planes that it originally ordered, none are being delivered (still).

Customers like to receive the products that they order — nobody likes to have incomparable substitutions forced upon them at a later date.

TransWorld
June 10, 2024


Yea that is fair. More in service -8 than ordered.

Long term SW may have ordered more -8 but they clearly wanted the -7 and in numbers.

They had a window to split the fleet as well. Bad call on their part.

While the A220 has a lot of appeal, the E2 190 and more likely the 195 would have been a great option

You would have to parse the numbers of Pax and pitch to see what they could get though I believe SW is fairly dense packed and only one class of seating.

PSA: 195 E2 does not compete with A220-300 or the MAX 7

@Pedro
The MAX7 is more related to the 737-800 than the -700 Southwest wanted to replace. E195-E2’s range is slightly less compared to a 737-700 but should be sufficient for the US without Alaska.

How many passengers you can squeeze in the E195 at LUV’s 32″ seat pitch??

TransWorld
June 17, 2024


140 at a guess.

They run E175s all over the place. Alaska is only 1500 air miles from Seattle.

Why do you need range in a point to point operation? Figure out what stop you need to throw in some fuel and good to go.

Perfect is the enemy of good enough.

Pedro
June 17, 2024


Haha. Porter’s E195 has 132 seats (30″ to 36″ seat pitch). I check with their seat map (from Porter), WN can squeeze in 128 passengers at best (or 124 passengers). Why would anyone think this is a good substitute for the MAX 7??

TransWorld
June 18, 2024


Because you can fill it and its got very good economics.

It has a modern wing and engine. Its lighter as its a bespoke production not a compromise like the MAX -7 which is heavy as its a cut down -8

Do some planning for fuel load and you can operate a lot lighter.

And the landing fees are less.

Funny to have someone who is against the MAX argue for the -7!

What you need to do is run the route profiles and assess use vs non use based on that.

As it can do pretty close to Trans Con range, the only mission it could not do would be NY to LA.

Is SW planning on doing that route with a -7?

Pedro
June 18, 2024


Yup flying like five-sixth paying customers with the same crew cost is a winning formula. I don’t realize you moonlight as a comedian here at LNA. After reading your posts, WN’s (and other LCC) C-suite must be beating their chests why they didn’t order the magical E195-E2.

The whining about an aircraft shortage is total BS based on Slide 36 in the Elliott presentation. I strongly suggest you read the presentation at strongersouthwest.com. Southwest has plenty of aircraft, but for some inexplicable reason they have chosen to not abandon lousy routes and redeploy the aircraft to more profitable routes. A full 12% of Southwest’s routes have a load factor below 70%, vs. 3% at American and 1% at United and Delta. My bet is even if they cut half of these low load factor routes and redeployed the aircraft, it would generate significant extra RASM. I really hope some analysts grill Southwest management on the next conference call as to why they are clinging to lousey money bleeding routes while whining about lack of aircraft? As a Southwest shareholder I fully support Elliott’s attempt to fix the airline.

“Southwest Airlines said Tuesday that it will have to trim its capacity plans and reevaluate its financial forecasts for the year, citing delivery delays from Boeing, its sole supplier of airplanes”

Old aircraft cost a *lot* of money when kept longer than originally planned, because:
– They require extended leases; or
– They require expensive maintenance (D checks, or extra C checks); and/or
– They require interior refurbishment, to keep them up to a level expected by customers on the basis of what competitors are offering.

REPLY

June 10, 2024


On the subject of cancellations…what about the related subject of conversions?
Southwest has already been forced to convert many of its MAX-7 orders to MAX-8s. Seeing as Southwest is essentially the only customer for the MAX-7, I can imagine that Boeing would be *thrilled* if all remaining MAX-7 orders were converted to MAX-8s…even at the same price! That way, at least, the company could stop pretending that the -7 is ever going to be certified…

REPLY
TransWorld
June 10, 2024


Another wild and odd jump of illogical.

South West will get their -8s at -7 prices ( better) if that is what occurs.

Or they can take -8s now and more -7s when it gets certified (sadly plenty of lead time)

The bigger question is South West diversifying and getting better aircraft for the -7 mission.

That of course means loss of commonality but the option is there and Embraer would be happy to sell them E2s. So you loose on one area but more efficient aircraft day in day out for the mission.

“Embraer’s E2 backlog sits at 194 units, divided between 179 E195-E2s and 15 E190-E2s” (April 2024)
“American Airlines’ new order for the E175 accounts for more than half the firm order backlog for the type. Together with AA, Republic Airlines (YX), Skywest (OO) and Horizon Air (QX) represent the bulk of the E175s backlog, totalling 176 out of 187 units to be delivered to the US”

David P:

Sometimes reality rears its ugly head and an upgraded aircraft (aka MAX) is better than long lead delivery times and swap over.

Depending on the route, an E2 195 could well be more economical than an A220-300.

But top call a E series dated? That is pretty odd

New wings (each version has its own wing which makes up for not having a composite wing that fits all the A220) , FBW, new engines and you keep the tube that adds nothing?

You should note that BBD did not do anything other than a standard aluminum fuselage.

Possibly… But on the other side of the coin, Boeing would maybe been more compelled to take the Plane and make it a replacement for the MAX. The MAX was grounded for two years. Boeing could have devoted their great resources to the -500/-700, and possibly had great success. But, I agree this is speculation…

Southwest needs the additional range of the MAX 7 compared to the MAX 8 and for this the MAX 7 can start from shorter Runways. Also, the fees should be slightly cheaper.
All things Southwest needs according to their concept.

A switch to MAX 8 is therefore associated with route problems. Only an A223LR version helps.

You have to get deep into routes to see if its SW Spin or not, but an E2-195 would work as it has trans-con range. Not by a lot but I don’t see the -7 as being a Trans Con either. Smaller markets jump to jump with shorter distances.

are you the “official” monitor of this discussion group? So let’s go off topic again………what will Boeing replace the current 737 model with?

Mainstream thoughts…all composite single aisle? But looking at weight and costs for single aisle aircraft production doesn’t make sense (e.g. C Series composite wing is still not cost effective)

The cost of some type of composite wing (autoclave or not) the capital equipment/space needed for 75 a month rate would be in the tens of billions

The cost and weight of composite fuselage …..you can’t descale composite thickness (hence not reduce weight) As a note, the same size 767 and 787, the 767 weights less.

My guess…Boeing already has “decided” on a metallic wing for the 737 replacement…..that’s why they are currently investing over $100 million for new wing riveters at Renton to replace the vintage 1960 WRS (which they still could maintain/operate for another 10 years)

Frank P:

Trying to take a cheap shot and making yourself look foolish.

So why not question those on the A220 wagon?

The discussion is about South West and why they are being raided.

Their current fleet is part of the discussion and most relevant to this forum as it is about aviation.

Clearly SW business practices have a major bearing and the attempted outing of SW uppers is part of that (as rotten as Elliotts goals may be, it does not mean its not true in the data)

So part of fixing SW has relevancy in the E2 with the MAX -7 delay and on hold on PART of the fix for SW. E2 and A220 are clearly options for that part of the issue.

People jump on the A220 and no disagreement its a better than -7 bird overall. But is it needed for SW and can an E2 substitute in for the maybe never to be -7?

Its not the only aircraft and a smart organization looks at its options

You should be aware of Mentour Pilot and his presentation on a possible merger with Breeze. While a lot of it has to do with the A220 options they have , Breeze runs E 190/195

Porter Airlines has gone with E2 195 and they route all over US from Candada.

SW can do a bit of seat pitch change and get the -7 number is those are magic of some kind. Keeping in mind the -7 was supposed to be a specific build originally not just a shorter -8 it is now.

SW has compromised on that point.

Its more than fair to ask what else may be on the table (or should be). All options should be. Then its what you can get when and how that works into the network and the needs.

Everyone is focusing on the 737Max, but LUV gets its aircraft at rock-bottom prices (late though they may be). If you are trying to unpack where LUV is going wrong, start with labor costs that are no longer industry competitive.

Also bear in mind (been a while), but LUV’s strategy of fuel hedging played out a long time ago. They no longer have that baked in advantage. And LUV is also the only airline that does not charge for luggage. That is not an insignificant income stream either.

Although Ryanair says that it based its model on Southwest, there’s one important difference: secondary airports are the backbone of Ryanair’s network.

If Ryanair were in the US, it would be serving airports like Fresno (CA), Saint George (UT) and Flagstaff (AZ) with regular services at low prices; as it is, such airports have very sub-standard connections, and no (or very little) LCC business. Maybe LUV could take a page from that playbook?

How does Q1 LF compared with last year? The remainder of the year is when there’s higher demand and airlines make most of their profits.

From your article:
‘“A balance sheet that size would have a lot of challenges financing itself in the high-yield market”, making it “a really difficult transition to high-yield”, said one asset manager who holds Boeing bonds. […]

Investors noted that Boeing’s bonds are already trading between the bottom of the investment-grade world and the top of the high-yield ladder, in a sign of its challenges to date and the changes made to its credit rating. Among Boeing’s larger and more liquid bonds, one issued in 2020 and maturing in 2050 currently yields roughly 6.5 per cent. Another maturing in 2030 yields just under 6 per cent, while a bond maturing in 2025 yields just over 6 per cent.

Six years ago, before the first 737 Max crash off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018, Boeing was rated “A” or “A2″– four notches above junk – by all three ratings agencies.

So fleet commonality with Airbus is good.

Fleet commonality with Boeing is bad.

The hypocrisy is deafening.

The religious fervor to have SWA operate Airbus aircraft is laughable. Please forgive me for interrupting the services, please resume.

SWA biggest problem is the same one they have been criticized for the last two decades. Its technology platform is ancient and should have been updated decades ago. Do a search over on Anet, there was a good thread on why SWA is married to its ancient software. To debut a new system will mean a rethink in operations, scheduling and reservations. But it must be done, it should have been done.

As regards the Elliot Group, if he does not have the unions on his side, it’s a moot point but he will make noise and maybe get a few board seats.

JP Morgan should do better research and see which major did not file for BK after 9/11. Evolving the least?

Apr 2024 Bloomberg:
“Southwest Airlines Co. is slowing growth, ending service at four airports and offering voluntary leaves to address *“significant challenges” stemming in part from reduced deliveries* of Boeing Co. planes. Southwest is now set to get 20 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in 2024, down from 46 previously…”

Williams:

You hit the nail on the head.

Of course people ignore the fatal crashes that Airbus has incurred with its fool proof computer only FBW system.

They should have been grounded a number of times and if you actually watch how some of those systems work its mind boggling.

A log of it is not instinctive, its just someones idea of what should be done, they clearly did not get an average group of pilots together to critique it.

Its why the 737 and the A320 have a close spot equally crash record. Sometimes pilots get in trouble with the Airbus system and sometimes its with the Boeing system.

And its an ugly truth, the two MAX crashes do not change the overall data. Horribly tragic for the people who died and their families, friends, loved ones.
The horror that was MCAS 1.0 needed to be stopped and was. But one bit of software in an aircraft that works fine?

And Airbus is all software and people have paid a price for some of that bodged software as well.

“Boeing Gets No Orders for the 737 Max for the Second Straight Month”

“Boeing received orders for only four new planes in May — and for the second straight month, none for its best-selling 737 Max, as fallout continues from the blowout of a side panel on a Max during a flight in January.

“The results released Tuesday compared unfavorably with Europe’s Airbus, which reported orders for 27 new planes in May.

“Boeing also saw Aerolineas Argentinas cancel an order for a single Max jet, bringing its net sales for the month to three.

“The dismal results followed poor figures for April, when Boeing reported seven sales — none of them for the Max.”

Deliveries were also poor:

“(Bloomberg) — Boeing Co. delivered 24 commercial jets in May, including 19 of its 737 family aircraft, as parts shortages and fresh scrutiny by China’s regulators complicated efforts to recover from a crisis engulfing its most popular aircraft.

“While rival Airbus SE handed over 53 aircraft last month, the US planemaker matched its total for April, the lowest monthly tally in more than two years. Boeing also recorded four gross jet orders against one cancellation for the month.”

“Allegiant slashes 19 routes due to Boeing delivery delays”

“Allegiant expected to receive six Boeing 737 MAX aircraft before July, but it now expects them later this year (at the earliest). Because of these delays, Allegiant has “incurred significant expenses,” president Greg Anderson said on the company’s most recent earnings call. These costs include pilot training for aircraft that aren’t yet in the fleet, as well as “loss of pilot productivity awaiting delivery of the 737 MAX aircraft.”

“Another cost associated with the delivery delays is this big network downsizing. In fact, with these cuts, Allegiant is projected to fly nearly 10% fewer flights in November 2024 compared to the previous year, Cirium data shows.

“”Reduced Boeing delivery expectations will impact our anticipated fourth quarter capacity and in turn our full-year guidance,” Drew Wells, Allegiant’s chief revenue officer, said in May.”

Alaska – an all BA fleet, seems to have no problems with their older 737’s as they posted an 11.2% margin.

The Big 3 all have positive margins and all have Boeing Max’s on order.

Does having to fly older aircraft for a longer period of time mess with your fleet strategy and cost you more? Sure.

It’s a combination of many things, isn’t it? Kinda like Boeing, a lot of fires to put out.

How much weight you would put to each issue, is a good conversation. There’s not a whole bunch SWA can do with the Boeing problem – it’s pretty much out of their hands. The Max 7 will get certified when it does. Production kinks will get sorted when they do. The FAA mess with oversight will eventually be fixed (I think). Supply chain has nothing to do with them.

They missed the boat in 2019, when the Max was grounded, to order the A220 and diversify the fleet. They’d have some in the fleet working today and probably would have gotten a good price from Airbus.

They also dropped the ball on investing in infrastructure and paid the price.

A really good question would be about load factor;

Why? Are customers not happy with them?

@ Casey
Ryanair also targets leisure travelers, and it has surpassed all the traditional operators in Europe.
Nothing wrong with targeting leisure travelers — but you then have to keep fares low, and you do that by keeping costs low. Southwest can start by improving its turnaround time (use two doors for boarding/de-planing) and introducing basic fares (with surcharges for all add-ons), for example. Not sure what the situation is where you live, but passengers on shorthaul flights in Europe now predominantly rely on carry-ons — not to save money, but to save time and hassle…so what’s the point in giving them a “free” checkin baggage allowance at a higher fare level?
Southwest could also consider moving away from the big airports and toward smaller ones: for example, 4 million people visit the Grand Canyon per year…but the service to the nearest “normal” airport (Flagstaff, AZ) is almost zero. Ryanair would fly into Flagstaff, and make alot of money doing so.

You guys are missing the point that SW could pick up the E2 195.

Embraer is not swamped though it has some backlog.

Clearly the A220 is the premier option, but long lead times.

A svelte E2 195 is better than a Fat Max -7.

Perfect is the enemy of good enough.

All the situation in regards to the aircraft for SW does is reveal the management is stuck in the past. They continue to think their model works when its does not for a variety of reasons.

One part is they are now a “mature” airline with higher costs that they did not have lo many years ago.

Cebu Pacific (Asia’s first LCC) looks to be heading toward a 150+ order from Airbus:

“(Bloomberg) — Airbus SE is closing in on a large single-aisle jet order from Cebu Pacific Air, with the carrier planning to sign up for as many as 150 A320neo aircraft that would more than double the Asian airline’s fleet size.

“A deal would include about 50 optional purchases, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Philippines-based Cebu and Airbus may announce the accord at the Farnborough Air Show later next month, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential.”

“Boeing had been looking to win over a loyal Airbus customer as it seeks to expand the customer base for its 737 Max jet in Southeast Asia. Cebu Pacific, the largest airline in the Philippines, has a fleet of about 85 Airbus and some smaller ATR turboprop aircraft, and an existing order book of more than 30 planes from the European manufacturer

“In leaning toward Airbus, Cebu Pacific appears to have kept its faith with the European planemaker despite delivery delays. The budget carrier is managing problems with Pratt & Whitney engines on some grounded jets in its fleet, forcing it to bring in additional leased planes to backfill the shortfall.”

Also important in this discussion: turnaround time. Ryanair turns a plane around in 25-30 minutes. So does Wizz. Do does Air Asia. I bet that figure is closer to 90 minutes over at Southwest…which is probably still using jetways instead of stairs…?

REPLY

More like Ryanair? Maybe.

The first question I would want answered, is why the LF is so low? Even by SWA standards…

There’s perhaps another angle to this story;

The C-Suite at SWA considers itself to be one of the Big 4 of airlines in the US. When airlines are mentioned in the states, it’s American, United, Delta & SWA.

Changing their model to mimic the other LCC’s/ULCC’s puts them in a class with those ‘other’ guys. Not just the 2 checked bags but routes, jetways, sardine seating et al.

I think they like being grouped with the legacy carriers and want to stay away from comparisons with Ryanair.

Ryanair has cattle call…we have Guests.

Note:

On the jetway thing – can that work in the US? Are airports just too jetway centric? IIRC the Ryanair aircraft have their own stairs, yes? Not so on the SWA fleet. Do any of the LCC’s/ULCC in the US use outside boarding?

Would SWA fear that they would shrink their LF even more, if they went that route?

I know the puddle jumpers load outside, even the Embraers. I can’t recall ever seeing outside boarding from a full size NB in a US airport, even the small ones. And I’ve flown out of places like Burlington, Vermont.

People do like their creature comforts…

On jetways: you’re right…they seem to be the norm in the US. That’s a pity, because boarding/de-planing then occurs via just the front door (on narrowbodies), which slows things down.

Ryanair 737s have an in-built front stairs only; for the rear door, push-up trolley stairs are used. Wizzair’s Airbus aircraft don’t have in-built stairs, so they use 2x push-up trolley stairs.

A bit more on the jetway thing;

The US has (especially during winter) a more diverse weather system.

Someone flies from the aforementioned Burlington, Vt to Fort Lauderdale, FL in Jan. It could be minus 25 in BTV and many people who make that trip leave the winter coats and boots in the car. You get into the terminal and you’re warm until you return back from FLL.

Loading and getting off outside in FLL isn’t a problem, but I’ll fly the carrier with jetway loading in BTV, every time.

As far as flying regional, like a Dash 8 or RJ, in winter – you always dress for the cold. You’re loading in the cold, your destination is cold, you dress warm.

You don’t drag your winter gear with you, down south.

@ Frank P
I don’t buy the climate difference argument.
There’s lots of North-South air traffic in Europe in winter, from freezing Scandinavia (-20C) to balmy Las Palmas (+20C). The Scandinavians wear winter clothes when they get on the plane, and they just take off their jackets when on board.

I suspect that the real reason for the jetway thing in the US may be an American aversion to using stairs…

‘The sources said the fasteners – which attach the carbon-composite skin to skeletal supports inside the fuselage called longerons – had been torqued from the wrong side.’

How many delivered and in service jets have the same issue?

But here comes the rider:

‘There is no immediate concern about flight safety but Boeing is working to understand what caused the problem…’

Immediate (def):
occurring or done at once; instant.

Add up all the currently-known defects in the 787 fleet and the concept of “immediate flight safety risk” is cast in a very different light.
Probabilities stack multiplicatively…not additively.
And unit probability takes on a very different meaning when considered across a base size as large as the 787 fleet.

As a vote of confidence, isn’t it time for members the board & C-suite of BA to abandon flying in private jets and switch to taking nothing but Boeing 737 MAX and 787.

Truly ROFL when someone tries to distort another persons statement.

For the rest, I stated that COMAC would not break into modern markets that adhere to certification requirements of which CAC does not have ant recognition. Those certifications are based on mutually recognized standards. So its EASA, Brazil, Candada and the US that make some form of larger commercial aircraft. CAC is not. COMAC has failed twice to achieve a system that adheres to those standards. No one says they have to. They can supply their own market (well the one the Government controls entirely) or any country that allows it. Japan will not, none of Europe will (unless EASA gives them cert) UK will not, India will not, Kenya and Ethiopia probably will not. Etc. Saudi’s might if they cook up a deal with China, politics being what it is.

The other hoot is supposedly COMAC has hundred of sales of the C919, all to China Airlines, China owned or Chinese controlled companies and in other countries.

With an amazing 6 of the C919 delivered already, the wait list for one is something around 2050?

But then for what looks like a foreign sale, one would be available of course.

But then there is the poison in the chalice that China gives deals and then forecloses and takes over an operation.

The Indonesian operation is Chinese controlled though how closely tied to the Chinese government no one outside the inner circles knows.

China has two pie in the sky programs going (on a spin basis) in the 929 and the 939. Eventually they will develop the tech to do them.

For those even if they ever came to see the light of day, its all international flights.

To be very specific there are certainly international sales that Comac can access.

Regarding the ARJ21, it’s interesting to note that there are now almost 150 of them in service.

Average production rate is now up to 3 per month…although there were 6 first flights in May. As with Airbus, the time between first flight and delivery is now measured in days rather than weeks.

After all, the order was placed before the Alaska door blowout (+ nacelle heating + wiring issues + faked documentation + whistleblower drama + Dutch roll) gained attention.

“Half of travelers are avoiding Boeing planes in wake of safety incidents”

“As many as half of passengers are deliberately avoiding flying on Boeing planes this summer, and turning to digital tools to avoid buying tickets on Boeing flights.”

“DailyMail.com spoke to multiple travel-sector experts who said that up to half of customers are now shunning Boeing planes in the wake of a series of safety issues.”

“Aaron Sutherland, founder of travel company Jetsetter Lifestyle, said that there has been a ‘notable’ shift in customer sentiment around Boeing aircraft.

“Sutherland said: ‘In recent months, almost 50 percent of our clientele have explicitly requested to avoid Boeing planes for both domestic and international travel.”

As if we needed more proof;

737Max line can’t deliver over 38 (they can’t get to that number, right now)

You’d think that Embraer might be able to make some headway with the E2 line.

And, yet, we have this curious article today — evidence of a complete “reality disconnect” at BCA:

“737 MAX Production Rate Increase Reported”

“Boeing has signaled its 737 MAX program suppliers that the aircraft assembly rate will increase in September to an estimated 42 jets per month. The increase had been expected to be reached this month, but the OEM has been operating under voluntary limits as it works with regulators to determine the sources of various quality and performance failures with the narrow-body aircraft program.”

https://www.americanmachinist.com/news/article/55089109/737-max-production-rate-increase-reported-boeing

So, the current *real world* line rate appears to be about 10 p/m…but 42 p/m in September is being planned.
Sure!

REPLY

An all-out effort to spin a bad story of delay into 42 jets per month! (disregard FAA’s limit at 38 only)
Look at the upside!

Reuters:
“Boeing’s supplier master schedule lays out expectations for when suppliers should be at a given production rate. Analysts say it does not necessarily reflect actual production which has been lagging due to a mixture of regulatory scrutiny and supply constraints. […]

The new supplier schedule calls for output to reach 47 a month in March 2025, compared with January of that same year. Output would reach 52 a month in September 2025, compared with June.”

FAA caps
Lack of staff at BCA
Re-work
No certification

Lowering prices is also an option, to entice existing customers to defect. For example: I think TC would get an attractive price on a batch of A350-1000s if he indicated that he was going to use them to dump ordered 777Xs.

Additionally, I can imagine that attractive pricing would be offered to Air Asia X (for example) for a big order of A330neos.

But I don’t see AB selling at a breakeven or loss, no matter how enticing the deal — unlike over at BA.

Major orders on A330 and A350 are easier to absorb…not the same level of backlog.

By the time the 777-9 becomes available in numbers, I believe the ongoing mid live upgrade programs for the A350 have progressed. Deliveries started 10 yrs ago & Airbus R&D doesn’t sit on it’s hands.

Ultrafans, A350F, A35XLR, capacity derivatives, less pilots cockpit certification, production ramp up, MRO optimizations, continuous production improvements, cabin options.

An uphill battle for the 777-9, let alone 777XF (a changed product derivative of an unapproved changed product derivative, FAA will love the certification paperwork)..

A picture on the 777x certification I made many years ago & was considered flamebait..

Boeing Lost Track of Up to 400 Bad 737 Parts, Whistleblower Says

“[…] The stock has lost about a third of its value this year.

Documents and whistleblower accounts collected by the panel thus far “paint a troubling picture of a company that prioritizes speed of manufacturing and cutting costs over ensuring the quality and safety of aircraft,” staff from the panel said in a memo to members. […[

The demands on Mohawk’s job monitoring those parts surged after the 737 Max’s worldwide grounding triggered by the two deadly crashes. Mohawk alleged that “the overwhelming number of nonconforming parts eventually led his superiors to direct him and others to eliminate or ‘cancel’ the records that designate a part as nonconforming,” according to the memo. […]

The concerns raised by Mohawk bear similarities to allegations previously raised by the late Boeing whistleblower John Barnett about the production of one of the company’s other flagship aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner.
