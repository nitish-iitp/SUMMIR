Preview: Japan vs. Syria - prediction, team news, lineups

Syria will be looking to seal their spot in the third stage of the AFC section of 2026 World Cup qualifying when they travel to Hiroshima for Tuesday's clash with Japan.

The hosts, who have already booked their place in the next round, will have the chance to finish the second stage with a 100% record.

As the 18th-ranked side in the world, Japan have showcased their quality to make light work of a group that contains Syria, North Korea and Myanmar.

They began their qualifying campaign with consecutive 5-0 wins over Myanmar and Syria, before they recorded a narrow 1-0 victory over North Korea.

Japan were then awarded a 3-0 win after their scheduled away meeting with North Korea was cancelled, ensuring that they sealed their spot in the next round with a game to play.

After securing their progression in March, the Samurai Blue returned to action with a dominant 5-0 away win in Thursday's clash with Mynamar thanks to braces from Keito Nakamura and Koki Ogawa as well as a Ritsu Doan effort.

They will now be looking to maintain their 100% record and clinch another clean sheet to advance to the next round without conceding a single goal.

In contrast to their hosts, Syria are yet to secure their place in the next stage after collecting seven points from their five qualifiers.

They kicked off their campaign with a narrow 1-0 victory over North Korea, before losing to Japan and drawing 1-1 with Myanmar.

Syria then produced a free-scoring display to ease to a 7-0 victory over Myanmar in March, ensuring that they went into Thursday's game against North Korea with the chance to seal a top-two spot.

However, they ultimately fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat on matchday five, reducing their buffer to North Korea to just one point ahead of the final round of fixtures.

Hector Cuper's side still have their fate in their own hands, knowing that a win will be enough to clinch second spot, but a failure to claim all three points will leave Syria at risk of being leapfrogged by North Korea.

Japan boss Hajime Moriyasu is likely to make a number of changes as he looks to give the majority of the squad some game time.

Ko Itakura and Koki Machida could be brought into the backline, while Wataru Endo and Ao Tanaka are in contention to feature in midfield.

Japan's attacking options could be freshened up with the introduction of Takumi Minamino, Daizen Maeda and Ayase Ueda.

As for Syria, they are unable to call upon the attacking duo of Mahmoud Al Aswad and Daleho Irandust due to injury.

Muayad Al Khouli is pushing for a starting spot after featuring as a half-time substitute in Thursday's defeat to North Korea.


Japan possible starting lineup:
Maekwa; Sugawara, Itakura, Machida, Ito; Endo, Tanaka; Doan, Minamino, Maeda; Ueda

Syria possible starting lineup:
Madanieh; Oues, Krouma, Midani, Ajan; Elias, Al Khouli, Ham; Hesar, Ramadan, Al-Somah



We say: Japan 3-1 Syria

Japan have proven to be a cut above the rest in Group B, and while they may be guaranteed top spot, we still think that they will have the motivation to wrap up the second stage of qualifying with a home victory.
