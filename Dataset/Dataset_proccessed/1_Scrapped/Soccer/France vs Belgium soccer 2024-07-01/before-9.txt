FOOTBALL
Euro 2024: Every player serving last-16 ban or nearing quarter-final suspension
By Oliver Thomas, Senior Reporter

Following an action-packed group stage filled with late goals and shocks galore, the lineup for the last 16 at Euro 2024 is now complete.

The excitement for knockout football is growing and while the managers of all the remaining teams will be looking to play their strongest sides at this stage of the tournament, some players will be forced to watch on from the stands as they serve a suspension.

UEFA's yellow card rule for Euro 2024 states that a player will be suspended for one match after picking up yellow cards in two separate games, and again after a fourth caution, meaning if a player receives two yellow cards during the group stage, last 16 and quarter-finals, they will be banned for the semi-finals if their team progresses.

All accumulated yellow cards are reset after the quarter-finals and players can only be suspended for the grand final on July 14 by receiving a red card in the semi-finals.

Here, Sports Mole provides the lowdown on every player who is suspended for the last 16 and every player who is at risk of serving a ban in the quarter-finals.
