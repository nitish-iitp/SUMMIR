Sierra Leone head coach Amidu Karim has made four changes from the Chad opener in today’s starting line-up for Leone Stars’ second match in the African Cup of Nations Group G qualifying against Zambia.

Kick-off at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium is 21 hours local as coach Avram Grant’s side hosts their West African Counterparts.

With Injury to Qatar-based midfielder Alhassan Koroma, the Gaffer has opted to bring in Holland-based midfielder Ibrahim Sillah in his place. Furthermore, Bo Rangers striker Musa Noah Kamara and Cambridge winger Sullay Kaikai are in for Daniel Kanu and Plymouth Argyle’s Mustapha Bundu.

The same back four in Ankara Keçiörengücü‘s defender Steven Caulker, Dinamo Brest centre-back Jarju Kabia, Hartford Athletic‘s Emmanuel Samadia and Osman Kakay.

Crystal Palace Under-21s midfielder Hindolo Mustapha, who made his International debut in the draw against Chad, started from the bench.

Bristol Rovers midfielder Kamil Conteh replaced Jose Koroma to team up with Italy-based Augustus Kargbo, Bo Rangers striker Musa Noah Kamara and Cambridge United Sullay Kaikai in attack.

A must-win game or worse case, Sierra Leone must avoid defeat at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium.

Sierra Leone Subs: 23 Francis Koroma, 16, Isaac Caulker, 17, Yeami Dunia, 20 Saidu Mansaray, 13 Josh Koroma, 3 Sallie Tarawallie, 27 Hindolo Mustapha, 22 Kamil Conteh, 10 Mustapha Bundu, 14 Daniel Kanu, 12, Jonathan Morsay, 4 Saidu Fofana
