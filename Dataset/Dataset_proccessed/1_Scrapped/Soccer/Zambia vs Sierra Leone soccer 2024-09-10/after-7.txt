Kings Kangwa was the hero for Zambia in their latest Group G 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Tuesday night, as the midfielder capped off a dramatic 3-2 win against Sierra Leone at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium.

Zambia got the game off to a rapid start and had a go at the Sierra Leone goal on a couple of occasions.

Amid Zambia’s pressure, the Leone Stars attempted to get into the game through quick transnational moves in the middle of the park.

The Copper Bullets actively searched for an opener during the first 20 minutes of the encounter and dominated the ball possession count midway through the first half.

Then, after a quick passing move down the left-hand side of the pitch, Lubambo Musonda picked out Kennedy Musonda with a fine cross into the area before the attacker guided the ball home with an accurate header from close range in the 28th minute.

The Leone Stars fought back immediately and levelled the scoreline five minutes later.

With Zambia in a vulnerable defensive position, Augustus Kargbo capped off a well-constructed passing move on the edge of the box with a clinical finish en-route to goal.

After a thrilling end to the half, Zambia and Sierra Leone went into the break with a goal apiece.

The game reached a tacky period after an hour played at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium with neither side creating any notable scoring opportunities going forward.

However, the Copper Bullets restored their lead via a well-taken effort by Kelvin Kampamba in the 70th minute of the match after yet another delicate passing move outside the 18-yard-box.

Zambia once again failed to hold onto their lead for more than four minutes, as Hindolo Mustapha levelled matters for his nation with a calm finish inside the Copper Bullets box.

Then lastly, in a moment that sent Zambian fans into a state of euphoria, Kings Kangwa gave the Copper Bullets a well-deserved lead moments before the 90th minute mark with a classy free-kick outside the area.
