Prediction 1X2 : Which team to bet on?
My prediction for this match is: Draw or Gibraltar wins the match.

1. Home Record: Gibraltar has shown that they can hold their own against opponents on their home turf with a 20% win rate and 40% draw rate in their last 5 home matches, demonstrating a certain level of strength and resilience.

2. Poor Away Performance by San Marino: San Marino has neither won nor drawn in any of their last 5 away matches. Additionally, they have scored only 1 goal and conceded 5 goals, highlighting their weak offensive and defensive performance on the road.

3. Favorable Odds: The probability of Gibraltar winning or a draw is 85.03%, which is significantly higher than the probability of San Marino winning. This statistic speaks in favor of Gibraltar and reduces the associated risk with this prediction.

Over/Under 2,5: Which bet ?
Under 2.5 goals in the match

1. The offensive statistics of both teams are low. On average, Gibraltar scores 0.6 goals per home match and San Marino scores 0.4 goals per away match. This results in a combined average of just 1 goal per match.
2. San Marino, in particular, has strong defensive statistics when playing away, conceding only 1.8 goals per match on average. Moreover, in their last 5 away matches, they have only scored once, further reducing the probability of many goals in the match.
3. Recent matches involving Gibraltar at home and San Marino away have also tended to be low-scoring, with most matches featuring less than 2.5 goals, further supporting the argument for a total score of under 2.5 goals in this match.

BTTS: Will both teams score ?
Both teams to score: No

1. The offensive potential of San Marino is very low, scoring on average only 0.4 goals per match in their last 5 away games. This indicates that they struggle to score.
2. Gibraltar has a strong defensive performance at home, conceding on average only one goal per match in their last 5 games. Therefore, there is a high chance they can prevent San Marino from scoring.
3. Recent match statistics show that San Marino often loses without scoring, as seen in their away games against Moldova, Slovakia, Kazakhstan, Northern Ireland, and Denmark.

Which bet offers an interesting value bet ?
Draw or Gibraltar win the match – 85.03% probability of success: 1.15

1. Recent statistics are in favor of Gibraltar, especially at home where they have a win and two draws in their last 5 matches, with a strong defensive performance only conceding an average of one goal per match.

2. San Marino has poor performances away from home, having neither won nor drawn in their last 5 matches. Furthermore, their offensive and defensive performances are inferior to Gibraltar’s, averaging only 0.4 goals scored and 1.8 goals conceded per match.

3. The prediction success rate is also higher for Gibraltar (55.1% for a win) or a draw (29.93%) compared to a San Marino win (14.97%). The probability of a win or draw for Gibraltar is very high at 85.03%, indicating strong favorable odds, thus enhancing the value of this bet.

Bet on the exact result
Gibraltar 1-0 San Marino

1. The match history shows that Gibraltar has been able to maintain decent performances in their home games, managing to equalize or win against their opponents in 60% of cases. On the other hand, San Marino has shown no positive performance in their away games, losing every time with several goals conceded.
2. Based on the offensive and defensive potential of both teams, Gibraltar scores on average more goals than San Marino and concedes fewer goals than San Marino in their respective matches. This difference in performances could lead Gibraltar to score a goal while preventing San Marino from scoring.
3. Furthermore, the provided probabilities strongly favor a victory for Gibraltar or a draw. The probability of fewer than 1.5 goals being scored in the match is also notably high, which is consistent with a scenario of Gibraltar scoring a single goal and San Marino not scoring any.

Game Analysis and Key Facts
Team Form

Gibraltar has had a mixed performance at home, with one win and two draws in their last 5 matches. They have scored 3 goals but conceded 4.

It is important to clarify that the prediction is based on the statistics provided, not on a certainty or guarantee of outcome. With an Estonia U21 team that draws a lot of matches at home (80%) and has a weak offensive and defensive potential, and an Israel U21 team that also struggles to secure victories away, the match appears to be very balanced and difficult to predict. However, given their higher offensive and defensive potential, Israel U21 seems to have a slight advantage. Prediction: Israel U21 wins the match or Draw.
