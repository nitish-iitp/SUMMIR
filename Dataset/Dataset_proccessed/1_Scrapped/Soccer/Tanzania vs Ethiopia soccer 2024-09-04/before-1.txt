Current Africa Cup of Nations Qualification standings for Tanzania vs Ethiopia September 4, 2024

Both Tanzania and Ethiopia are trying to move up in the Africa Cup of Nations Qualification, Group H, as they get ready to play on September 4, 2024. This encounter might significantly affect their prospects of moving on to the next round of the tournament because there are crucial points at stake.

Tanzania Recent Results

Tanzania has shown that it is still developing as a squad by exhibiting a mix of victories, defeats, and draws in its recent outings. Their recent matches provide a snapshot of their form leading into this qualification game.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
11.06.24	WC	Zambia vs Tanzania	0-1	W
02.06.24	FI	Indonesia vs Tanzania	0-0	D
19.05.24	FI	Sudan vs Tanzania	0-1	W
15.05.24	FI	Sudan vs Tanzania	2-1	L
25.03.24	FI	Tanzania vs Mongolia	3-0	W

Tanzania has managed to secure a few critical wins, including a narrow victory against Zambia in World Cup qualifying and a convincing win over Mongolia in a friendly match. However, their defeat against Sudan highlights potential vulnerabilities, particularly when playing away from home. Their defensive solidity, as seen in multiple clean sheets, will be a key factor against Ethiopia.

Ethiopia Recent Results

Ethiopia’s recent results have been varied, reflecting a team capable of both surprising performances and disappointing results. Here’s a look at their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
09.06.24	WC	Djibouti vs Ethiopia	1-1	D
06.06.24	WC	Guinea Bissau vs Ethiopia	0-0	D
24.03.24	FI	Ethiopia vs Lesotho	2-1	W
21.03.24	FI	Ethiopia vs Lesotho	1-2	L
21.11.23	WC	Ethiopia vs Burkina Faso	0-3	L

Ethiopia’s World Cup qualifying matches against Djibouti and Guinea Bissau have shown them to be resilient, but their crushing loss to Burkina Faso raises questions about their defensive solidity. They can recover, as evidenced by their victory over Lesotho, but they still struggle with consistency.

Tanzania vs Ethiopia Head-to-Head Results

Tanzania and Ethiopia have a competitive head-to-head record, with no team clearly dominating the other. Their last five encounters are listed below:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
30.11.15	CHA	Tanzania vs Ethiopia	1-1
28.11.15	CHA	Tanzania vs Ethiopia	1-2
11.01.13	FI	Ethiopia vs Tanzania	2-1
10.12.72	WC	Ethiopia vs Tanzania	3-0
03.12.72	WC	Ethiopia vs Tanzania	0-0

The two sides’ past encounters demonstrate their fierce rivalry, with Ethiopia holding a slim victory differential. But Tanzania has shown that they can compete, especially in more recent meetings. This game might once again be hotly contested, based on the pattern.
