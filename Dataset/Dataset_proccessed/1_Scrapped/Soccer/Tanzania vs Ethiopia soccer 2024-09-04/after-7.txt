Despite a second half equalizer, the Gresham High School boys soccer team couldn’t quite hang on against Milwaukie in the Gophers’ 2024 home opener.

Sophomore Ariel Hernandez fired a shot into the far bottom corner of the net from nearly 35 yards out to tie the match up at one in the 69th minute, giving the home team plenty of momentum.
