Tanzania and Ethiopia get their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign underway when they go head to head at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium on Wednesday.

Both sides, who are meeting for the first since November 2015, have been drawn in Group H, alongside 1976 AFCON runners-up Guinea and two-time champions Congo DR.

Tanzania endured another forgettable campaign in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations as they failed to win any of their three matches and suffered a third consecutive group-stage exit from the continental showpiece.

Making just their third AFCON appearance, the Taifa Stars fell to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Morocco in the Group F curtain-raiser on January 17 before playing out consecutive draws against Zambia and Congo DR to finish rock-bottom in the table with just two points.

Since their underwhelming display in Ivory Coast, Tanzania have put together a decent run of results, picking up three wins and one draw from six matches while scoring six goals and keeping four clean sheets.

Hemed Suleiman's men head into Wednesday's clash off the back of an impressive 1-0 victory over 2012 African champions Zambia in the World Cup qualifier on June 11 courtesy of a fifth-minute strike from Waziri Junior.

Following the win over Zambia, Tanzania have now picked up six points from the first three games in Group E to sit second in the table as they set their sights on securing a first-ever World Cup appearance.

While Tanzania will be looking to pick up from where they left off in June and kick off their quest for a place in Morocco a high, they go up against an opposing side who are unbeaten in 17 of their last 23 meetings, picking up 10 wins and seven draws since February 1969.

Ethiopia, on the other hand, failed to get up and running in the World Cup qualifiers as they could only salvage a 1-1 draw against Djibouti at the Stade El Abdi on June 9.

Gabriel Dadzie struck in the 29th minute to put Djibouti in front but the visitors hit back two minutes later through Menyelu Wondimu before turning in a solid defensive performance in the second half to see out the draw.

With that result, Ethiopia have now failed to win any of their four games in Group A of the World Cup qualifiers, picking up three draws and losing once to collect three points from a possible 12 and sit fifth in the table.

Head coach Gebremedhin Haile will urge his side to take the positives from the result against Djibouti as they begin their quest for a return to AFCON, having missed out in 2023 following a disappointing qualifying journey.

The Walia Ibex picked up just one win from their six matches in Group D of the 2023 AFCON qualifiers while losing four and claiming one draw from their six matches to collect four points and finish bottom of the standings.

Ethiopia head into Wednesday's clash without a win in any of their last 11 competitive games, losing six and picking up five draws since beating Rwanda 1-0 in the Africa Nations Championship qualifiers in September 2022.

Tanzania have named a 23-man squad for their games against Ethiopia and Guinea, with Yanga defender Dickson Job earning a call-up after being dropped for the World Cup qualifying clash against Zambia in June.

The Simba trio of Edwin Balua, Mohammed Hussein and goalkeeper Ally Salim have been named in the squad, alongside Egypt-based Himid Mao and Goztepe man Novatus Miroshi, who has netted three goals since his debut in September 2021.

PAOK's Mbwana Samatta and 31-year-old Simon Msuva, who has scored 19 goals in 76 senior caps, including their only goal in the 2023 AFCON, have been overlooked by head coach Suleiman.

As for Ethiopia, Abel Dele, 22-year-old Mesfen Tafese and Mamelodi Sundowns striker Abubeker Nasir, who boast five goals in 22 senior caps, have been ruled out due to injuries.

The Ethiopia Commercial Bank trio of goalkeeper Firew Getahun, defender Suleiman Hamid and Fetuddin Jemal have been called up while defender Fraser Kass will miss Wednesday's clash due to passport issues.

Canaan Markneh, Gatoch Panom and Binyam Belay all started the game against Djibouti last time out and should retain their roles at the centre of the park, while Faud Fereje should lead the Walia Ibex attack.

Suleiman Hamid, Fetudin Jemal and Ethiopian Medhin man Million Solomon should also form the three-man defence for the second consecutive game shielding Adama City goalkeeper Said Habtamu between the sticks.


Tanzania possible starting lineup:
Salim; Husseini, Bacca, Nondo, Mwaikenda; Mkami, Yahya; Kachwel, Salum, Mzize; Junior

Ethiopia possible starting lineup:
Habtamu; Hamid, Solomon, Jemal; Terfu, Markneh, Panom, Belay, Berhane; Berhanu, Fereje


We say: Tanzania 1-0 Ethiopia

While Ethiopia have enjoyed the better of this fixture, Tanzania head into the game off the back of a solid display against Zambia and will be backing themselves on their home soil.

Ethiopia have failed to taste victory in 11 straight competitive games and we see this run extending, with the Taifa Stars claiming all three points.
