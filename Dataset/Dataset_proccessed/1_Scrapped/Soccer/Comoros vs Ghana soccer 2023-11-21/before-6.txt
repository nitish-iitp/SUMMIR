Ghana vs Madagascar: Come and buy tickets – NSA appeals to supporters
November 16, 2023in Sports

Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the National Sports Authority (NSA), Rita Addai Asare, has appealed to supporters to purchase tickets ahead of the highly anticipated World Cup Qualifier clash between Ghana’s Black Stars and Madagascar.

Speaking exclusively on Happy FM, Asare expressed concern about the current ticket sales, stating, “Tickets have been bought, but not as expected, so I want to appeal to supporters to try and purchase the tickets. One thing we have noticed is that many prefer to buy the tickets on the day of the match, which sometimes leads to network problems. I’m urging everyone to try and get their tickets from tonight to tomorrow morning so there wouldn’t be any network problems.”

The NSA assures fans that the match promises intense action, and getting tickets in advance will not only guarantee entry but also contribute to a smoother and more enjoyable experience for everyone attending the event.
