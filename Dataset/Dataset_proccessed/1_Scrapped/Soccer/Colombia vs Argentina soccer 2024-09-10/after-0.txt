Advertising and content can be personalised based on your profile. Your activity on this service can be used to build or improve a profile about you for personalised advertising and content. Advertising and content performance can be measured. Reports can be generated based on your activity and those of others. Your activity on this service can help develop and improve products and services.
Use limited data to select advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.
Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.
Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.

You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

What a win for Colombia!

Colombia had Argentina's number for the full 98 minutes as they kept Argentina at bay for large spells and managed to dominate in all areas.

James Rodríguez set up Mosquera for the first goal after the 20 minute mark with a delightful cross from the left. From then on, the home side packed the middle of the pitch and stopped the world champions from finding space in between the lines. 

They attacked with a lot of flair at times and Luis Díaz was a constant threat down the left, helped by James magic on occasion.

Nico González scored after the break following a mistake from James but he made up for it with a sensational penalty that came when Muñoz was brought down.

After the goal went in from the spot, Colombia managed the game superbly well, creating danger until the final whistle.

"7 of the last 8 goals that Colombia has scored have come from set pieces and James Rodríguez has been involved in 6 of them."

AS.COM
POSTED AT: 17:29 EDT 10/09/2024

Colombia have been superb...

James Rodríguez has James Rodríguez-d the life out of that game, being decisive without dominating. It seems that apart from dead ball moments he has touched the ball 6 times but they've all been crucial to Colombia's attacking threat.

Luis Díaz is finding way too much space down the left and Durán looks like the most annoying person to stand next to on this side of the globe. 

If Colombia keep up the pressure and Argentina can't find a way to close off the spaces, then I could see another goal for the home side before long...

AS.COM
POSTED AT: 17:25 EDT 10/09/2024

Dare I say my prediction was correct?

The lack of dynamism in the middle of the park from the away side is, in my opinion, a reason why they're struggling so badly against Colombia, who are packing the middle channel off the ball. 

While longer switches of play have opened things up for Argentina on occasion, they're not finding the passes in between the lines when moving through towards the final third. 

If only they had a number 10, an attacking midfielder who could exist in between the lines... Yes! Dybala, for example.

Argentina have the ball in the middle third and there's definitely a sense of frustration from them as the passing lanes in behind, that are usually so well carved out, just aren't there.

A sublime goal from Colombia

I've just checked out a replay of the goal and Nico González allowed Mosquera to have just enough space to bend his legs and leap into the air.

The pass from James was lofted over Dibu's grasp and landed perfectly where he intended it too. Fabulous.

Julián dived into Camilo Vargas as he came to collect the ball and although the goalkeeper landed on his foot, the foul was already committed.

Three at the back for Argentina?

Montiel is no stranger to playing in a wing-back role for his national team, as we have seen him do at club level.

We could see the away side shift into a back 3 in on-ball moments, as they look to overpower Colombia and dominate in the wide areas.

Whatever the case, Montiel will have to run his socks off in defensive moments as he'll likely have Liverpool's Luis Díaz looking to create havoc down the wing.

Argentina 1-0 Colombia: summary, score, goals, highlights Copa América final

Nobody had crowd trouble, Shakira, a Lionel Messi injury and an extra-time winner on their bingo card as Argentina clinched a record 16th Copa América title against the same opponents as today.

Keep an eye on...

The names Bond, James Rodríguez might be the worst headline ever written in the English media (search online for it), but James Rodríguez has, on plenty of occasions, got people talking about his amazing natural talent.

The Colombian has been raising eyebrows again with his recent performances and was given the MVP of the Tournament award at the recent Copa América. 

Those performances led many people to believe that a move to one of Europe's top leagues was on the cards, but nobody expected Rayo Vallecano to be his next team. Yes, the ex-Real Madrid player rocked up at Vallecas and signed a deal that will see him grace the fantastic 3-sided stadium this season in southern Madrid. 

For Colombia he's been a shining star in a team full of quality players who give me 'the fizz' and that left foot of his has been magical every time he's put on the yellow shirt.

Here's how the table looks:

The South American qualifiers for the World Cup are a notoriously difficult set of games, with more historically successful teams regularly stumped by smaller nations due to the difficulty of the league format. 

As things stand, Argentina are top of the pops with 18 points from 7 games.

They hold a 4 point advantage over Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay and are 5 ahead of their opponents tonight.

Five-time world champions Brazil are in 4th with just 10 points and they have dark horses Venezuela right up their, ahem, just a point behind.
