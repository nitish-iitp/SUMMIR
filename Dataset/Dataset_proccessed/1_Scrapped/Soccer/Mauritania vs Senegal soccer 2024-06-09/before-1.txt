Preview: Congo DR vs. Togo - prediction, team news, lineups

Separated by just one point in Group B of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Congo DR and Togo go head to head at the Stade des Martyrs on Sunday evening.

This will be the first meeting between the sides since January 2017, when the Leopards cruised to a comfortable 3-1 victory in their Africa Cup of Nations group-stage clash.

Congo DR turned in a resilient team display on Thursday when they fought back from behind to salvage a 1-1 draw against a star-studded Senegal side at the Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade.  

Marseille forward Ismailia Sarr broke the deadlock right on the stroke of half time to set the home side on their way to a second group victory but substitute Fiston Mayele netted five minutes away from time to force a share of the spoils.

This was the Leopards' first piece of action since their gruesome end to the 2023 AFCON back in February when they finished fourth in Ivory Coast after losing on penalties to South Africa in the third-placed playoff.  

Having kicked off their quest for a World Cup ticket with a 2-0 victory over Mauritania back in November, Congo DR have now picked up just one point from their subsequent two matches in Group B as they fell to a 1-0 loss against Sudan in their second group outing.

However, Sebastien Desabre's men will be backing themselves to return to winning ways this weekend as they take on a Togo side who have failed to win 11 of their last 12 encounters, losing 10 and managing just one draw since their first meeting in January 1965.

Togo were denied their first win of the qualifiers in midweek as they were held to a somewhat disappointing 1-1 draw by South Sudan when the sides squared off in Lome's Stade de Kegue.

With nothing to separate the sides in the first half, 29-year-old midfielder Khaled Narey struck one minute after the hour-mark to put the hosts in front but Esperance Tunis man Roger Aholou scored an own goal seven minutes later to gift the visitors a point.

Paulo Duarte's side have now been involved in a share of the spoils in their three Group B matches, having kicked off the campaign with a 1-1 draw with Sudan on November 16, five days before playing out a goalless draw with Senegal.  

With the result against South Sudan, Togo have now gone unbeaten in nine of their last 10 outings across all competitions — claiming four wins and five draws — with a 3-0 friendly defeat against Algeria on January 5 being the exception.

Following his side's solid defensive display against Senegal, Desabre could name an unchanged back four of Arthur Masuaku, Henoc Inonga, Chancel Mbemba and Axel Tuanzebe shielding Montpellier man Dimitry Bertaud between the sticks.

Off the back of an impressive cameo, Mayele could be rewarded with a place in the XI on Sunday, teaming up with 26-year-old Samuel Essende and Brentford star Youane Wissa

Nantes' man Samuel Moutoussamy should retain his role at the centre of the park, forming the midfield trio with Gael Kakuta and 27-year-old Charles Pickel.

Togo should name an unchanged XI from their midweek draw against South Sudan, with Jacques-Alaixys Roma, Loic Bessile and Kevin Boma forming the back three once again.

Kevin Denkey, who lit up the Belgian top flight with 27 goals in 38 matches last season, had an uncharacteristically quiet game last time out but should keep his place in the visitors' attack, alongside strike partner and Hoffenheim man Ihlas Bebou.


Congo DR possible starting lineup:
Bertaud; Masuaku, Inonga, Mbemba, Tuanzebe; Pickel, Moutoussamy, Kakuta; Wissa, Mayele, Essende

Togo possible starting lineup:
Mensah, Romao, Boma, Bessile; Aziangbe, Tchakei, Aholou, Dermane, Narey, Denkey, Bebou


We say: Congo DR 2-1 Togo

Looking at past meetings between the two nations, Congo DR head into the weekend as firm favourites to come away with the desired results. While Togo have shown resilience in each of their three group matches so far, we fancy the Leopards to return to winning ways at the Stade des Martyrs.
