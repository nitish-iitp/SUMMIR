Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson has suffered an ankle injury whilst on international duty with Senegal.

The 22-year-old was forced off in the closing stages of Senegal’s 1-1 draw with DR Congo in their World Cup qualifier on Thursday.

Senegal are due to play Mauritania in their next World Cup qualifier on Sunday evening but the medical team have confirmed that Jackson has been forced to withdraw from the squad for the game.

Jackson has suffered an injury to his right ankle and following an MRI scan, Senegal’s medical team have discovered that the striker has a ‘serious sprain’.

The Chelsea striker will now recover ahead of pre-season training which begins in July.

Enzo Maresca’s side will start their tour of the United States with a game against Wrexham in California on July 24. They will also play Celtic, Club America, Manchester City and Real Madrid.

Jackson finished his first season at Chelsea with 17 goals in all competitions but faced criticism for his inconsistency.

CHELSEA PRE-SEASON 2024 SCHEDULE

Chelsea vs Wrexham – July 24 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California

Chelsea vs Celtic – July 27 at Notre Dame Stadium, Notre Dame, Indiana

Chelsea vs Club America – July 31 at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia

Chelsea vs Manchester City – August 3 at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio

Chelsea vs Real Madrid – August 6 at Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, North Carolina

However, Jackson was also praised for his lively performances in the Premier League since his £31.8 million move from Villarreal last summer.

‘I actually like Nicolas Jackson, might be an unpopular opinion on here, but I like him,’ Gary Neville said on Sky Sports’ The Gary Neville Podcast in April.

‘I think he has a lot to give, he’s a young player. I think he’s not cost stupid money but it’s his first full season in the Premier League, he’s scored quite a few goals and he keeps going. There’s a lot to be said for that.

‘He might not be striker number one but if he was your striker number two or number three in a squad of 18 to 20, you’ll say, ‘I’ll take that’. So for me, the performance Chelsea put in against Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final that was a hell of a performance. Good, really good.

‘And if they had a forward who could finish more consistently than Nicolas Jackson then they would have obviously won the game, and I think that’s what Chelsea’s owners should be looking at.’
