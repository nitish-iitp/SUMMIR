SERBIA 0-0 SPAIN: LAMINE YAMAL AMONG LA ROJA STARS STIFLED AS HOSTS FRUSTRATE EURO 2024 WINNERS IN NATIONS LEAGUE OPENER
BYMATT JONES

UPDATED 05/09/2024 AT 22:00 GMT

Spain weren't able to kick off their UEFA Nations League campaign with a win after they were held by Serbia in Belgrade. Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams re-formed their wing wizard partnership that had been so devastating at Euro 2024, but it didn't result in goals for the visitors, who were missing Manchester City midfielder Rodri from their squad.

A wasteful Spain failed to get the defence of their UEFA Nations League campaign off to a winning start, as they were held to a 0-0 draw in Belgrade by Serbia.
It took a little while for the game to burst into life, but it finally did deep into the first half, when Nico Williams whipped a strike over and Ayoze Perez forced a good save out of Predrag Rajkovic.

At the other end, Luka Jovic should have opened the scoring when he missed the target from close range, before Veljko Birmancevic was denied by David Raya.

Things continued in a similar fashion after the break, when Spain dominated possession and continued to carve out a string of openings, only to be let down once they got into the penalty area.
Lamine Yamal was the most likely to score, missing a couple of chances, while Williams and substitute Alex Grimaldo were also thwarted, as Serbia clung on for an impressive point.
TALKING POINT - NO MORATA, NO GOAL
It would be unfair to say that Alvaro Morata is Spain’s only goal threat, but his injury-enforced absence was telling as his side failed to find the back of the net.
Lamine Yamal in particular had a handful of chances in the second half, but he did not hit the target enough.
Even when goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic was tested, he was not particularly stretched, leaving the visitors wondering what could have been as they proved far too wasteful in the final third.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - PEDRAG RAJKOVIC (SERBIA)
The 28-year-old was certainly the busier of the two goalkeepers, and he carried out his duties perfectly.
It is fair to say the Serb will have tougher nights, but when he was called into action, he made a number of saves, none better than the one to deny Ayoze Perez in the first half.
Picking up a clean sheet against this Spain team is no mean feat, and, coupled with his defence, Rajkovic should take a lot of credit.
PLAYER RATINGS
SERBIA: Rajkovic 8; Pavlovic 7, Milenkovic 7, Erakovic 6; Nedeljkovic 7, Ivan Ilic 7, Lukic 6, Birmancevic 6; Samardzic 6, Jovic 5, Zikovic 6. Subs: Simic 6, Mitrovic n/a
SPAIN: Raya 6; Cucurella 6, Le Normand 6, Laporte 6, Carvajal 7; Fabian Ruiz 6, Zubimendi 6; Olmo 7, Yamal 7, Ayoze 6, Williams 6. Subs: Grimaldo 6, Oyarzabal 6, Pedri n/a, Ferran Torres n/a, Joselu n/a
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
33' PEREZ DENIED. An excellent reaction save in the Serbia goal from Predrag Rajkovic keeps Ayoze Perez at bay, as the striker's first time strike from near the penalty spot is diverted to safety
34’ WHAT! A! SITTER! Oh my goodness! Jovic has just missed an absolute sitter. The ball breaks to him from Andrija Zikovic's reverse pass. He's in on goal, one-on-one, and he somehow misses the target by yanking past the far post. They may live to regret that
59' NEDELJKOVIC MISSES THE TARGET. If that had gone in, it would have been a stunning goal. A remarkable Serbia counter, starting near their own penalty area and involving some glorious one-touch football and several players. They pass their way into the Spain half, and then the penalty area, but Nedeljkovic cannot test the goalkeeper
76' YAMAL SHOT SAVED. The young star has another go from a similar position inside the area. This time he does test Rajkovic, but the goalkeeper makes the save.
KEY STATS
It’s now four games without success for Serbia, who were knocked out of Euro 2024 without tasting victory
Spain are now unbeaten in 16 competitive games, a run that includes 13 wins
