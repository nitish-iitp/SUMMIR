BELGRADE (Reuters) - Euro 2024 champions Spain were held to a dour goalless away draw with Serbia in Nations League Group Four on Thursday, ending a nine-game winning streak and dropping their first points since March.

Playing their first match after a stunning European Championship campaign in which they won all seven games en route to lifting the trophy with a 2-1 victory in the final over England, Spain dominated possession but were unable to convert in 22 scoring attempts.

Spain and Serbia are second on one point in the standings, two points behind Denmark who beat Switzerland 2-0 on Thursday.
