OSHA Employee Rights FAQs

Under OSHA law, employees have specific rights designed to protect them from workplace hazards and empower them to speak up about safety concerns without fear of retaliation. These rights cover various aspects of job safety, from access to information about potential hazards to the ability to report unsafe conditions.

This article will explore OSHA employee rights and protections. By familiarizing yourself with these rights, you'll be better equipped to protect yourself and your coworkers, contribute to a safer workplace, and take appropriate action if you encounter unsafe working conditions.

Key Takeaways
OSHA ensures employees have the right to work in a safe environment by enforcing safety standards and protecting against retaliation for reporting hazards.
Employers are responsible for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace by adhering to OSHA regulations and providing safety training and equipment.
Employees have the right to report injuries or unsafe conditions without retaliation and can request OSHA inspections if they believe their workplace is hazardous.
It is illegal for employers to retaliate against employees who report unsafe working conditions, file an OSHA complaint, or request an OSHA inspection.

 

Workers' Rights Under OSH Act

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) establishes a framework for worker protection in the United States. This legislation grants employees specific rights aimed at promoting safe and healthy work environments. Under the OSH Act, employers must create workplaces free from known hazards that could harm their staff.

The Act empowers workers to take an active role in maintaining their safety at work. Employees have the right to file confidential complaints with OSHA, requesting workplace inspections. They can also receive training about potential hazards and prevention methods in a language they understand.

Workers are entitled to access important safety-related information. This includes reviewing records of work-related injuries and illnesses, obtaining results from workplace hazard tests, and accessing their own medical records related to their job.

During OSHA inspections, employees have the right to participate and speak privately with inspectors. The Act also protects workers from retaliation if they exercise these rights or act as whistleblowers under various federal statutes.

By outlining these rights, the OSH Act aims to create a collaborative approach to job safety, involving both employers and employees in the process of maintaining healthy work environments.

 

Who Does OSHA Cover?

The OSH Act extends workplace safety and health protections to a broad range of employers and workers in the United States and its territories. This coverage includes most private sector employers and employees, as well as certain public sector workers.

Private Sector Workers

In the private sector, Federal OSHA directly oversees workplace safety in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and several U.S. territories. The remaining 21 states and Puerto Rico operate under OSHA-approved State Plans. These State Plans are workplace safety and health programs run by individual states rather than Federal OSHA. They must meet or exceed the effectiveness of the Federal OSHA program and receive up to 50% of their funding from OSHA.

The following 22 states or territories have OSHA-approved state programs that cover both private sector and state and local government workers:

■ Alaska ■ Arizona ■ California ■ Hawaii ■ Indiana ■ Iowa ■ Kentucky ■ Maryland ■ Michigan ■ Minnesota ■ Nevada ■ New Mexico ■ North Carolina ■ Oregon ■ Puerto Rico ■ South Carolina ■ Tennessee ■ Utah ■ Vermont ■ Virginia ■ Washington ■ Wyoming

State and Local Government Workers

Federal OSHA does not cover state and local government employees directly. However, these workers receive protection under the OSH Act if they work in states with OSHA-approved State Plans. All State Plans must include coverage for state and local government workers.

Some states and territories have State Plans that only cover state and local government workers, leaving private sector employees under Federal OSHA jurisdiction. The following have such limited State Plans:
■ Connecticut ■ Illinois ■ Maine ■ Massachusetts ■ New Jersey ■ New York ■ Virgin Islands

Federal Government Workers

OSHA worker protection applies to all federal agencies. While OSHA doesn't issue fines to federal agencies, it monitors them and conducts workplace inspections in response to worker reports of hazards. Federal agencies must maintain safety and health programs that meet the same standards as private employers. The U.S. Postal Service, under a 1998 amendment, falls under OSHA's jurisdiction like any private sector employer.

 

Who Does OSHA Not Cover?
Self-employed individuals
Immediate family members of farm employers
Workplace hazards regulated by other federal agencies (e.g., Mine Safety and Health Administration, Department of Energy, or Coast Guard)

 

Whose Responsibility Is It to Provide a Safe and Healthy Workplace?

The primary responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace falls squarely on the shoulders of employers. Under the Occupational Safety And Health Act, employers are legally obligated to create and maintain a work environment free from serious hazards and to comply with all OSHA safety and health standards.

Key Employer Responsibilities:

Employers must actively identify and address safety and health issues in the workplace. This involves regular inspections, risk assessments, and prompt corrective actions when hazards are found.
When addressing workplace hazards, employers should prioritize eliminating or reducing risks through changes in working conditions. This approach takes precedence over relying solely on personal protective equipment. Examples include:
Switching to safer chemicals
Enclosing processes to contain harmful fumes
Installing ventilation systems to improve air quality
Employers must prominently display the official OSHA poster that outlines rights and responsibilities under the OSH Act. This poster is available for free download from www.osha.gov.
Employers are required to inform workers about workplace hazards through various means, including:
Training sessions; all training must be conducted in a language and vocabulary that workers can understand.
Labels
Alarm systems
Color-coded systems
Chemical information sheets
Accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses must be maintained.
Employers must conduct tests required by OSHA standards, such as air sampling.
When mandated by OSHA standards, employers must provide medical tests like hearing exams.
OSHA citations and workplace injury and illness data must be posted in areas visible to workers.
Employers are obligated to notify OSHA of:
Workplace fatalities within 8 hours
Work-related inpatient hospitalizations, amputations, or loss of an eye within 24 hours
It is illegal for employers to retaliate against workers for exercising their rights under the OSH Act, including reporting work-related injuries or illnesses.

 

OSHA Employee Rights to a Safe Workplace

A safe workplace is an environment where employees can perform their duties without unnecessary risks to their health or well-being. It includes proper training, appropriate safety equipment, and procedures to prevent accidents and injuries.

Examples of Unsafe Working Conditions:

Construction sites lacking guardrails, safety nets, or personal fall arrest systems for workers at heights.
Manufacturing facilities with insufficient ventilation or lack of proper filters to remove harmful airborne particles or chemicals.
Exposed wiring, damaged electrical cords, or overloaded circuits in office buildings or industrial settings.
Food service areas with pest infestations or improper food storage practices could lead to foodborne illnesses.
Offices with poorly designed workstations can cause repetitive strain injuries or musculoskeletal disorders.
A worker enters a narrow underground sewer pipe for cleaning without proper ventilation equipment, risking exposure to toxic gases or low oxygen levels.
Laboratories or industrial facilities without proper containment or handling procedures for dangerous substances.
A female office worker experiences ongoing sexual harassment from a male colleague, including unwanted physical contact and explicit verbal comments.
Workplaces without clear evacuation routes, fire extinguishers, or first aid kits in case of emergencies.
Workers’ Rights to Information

OSHA requires that workers have access to information about workplace hazards. Employers must use various methods to inform employees about potential dangers, including warning signs, color-coding, and training. This training should be conducted in a language workers can understand, and employees should receive their regular pay for attending OSHA-mandated sessions.

The Hazard Communication standard, also known as the "Right-To-Know" standard, focuses on chemical hazards. Under this rule, employers must inform and train workers about hazardous chemicals in the workplace. This includes maintaining an up-to-date list of hazardous chemicals, properly labeling containers, and providing Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) with detailed information about each substance.

In higher-risk industries, employers with more than ten employees must keep accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses. Workers have the right to receive copies of these records, which can help identify areas needing safety improvements. From February 1 through April 30 each year, employers must post a summary of the previous year's injury and illness log where workers can see it.

Many OSHA standards require employers to conduct environmental tests to check for harmful levels of hazardous substances, noise, or radiation. This process is called exposure monitoring, and workers have the right to access the results of these tests.

Some OSHA standards also require medical tests to assess workers' health in relation to workplace exposures. For example, employers must test for hearing loss in workers exposed to excessive noise. Workers have the right to access their own medical records, and their representatives can review these records with written permission from the employee.

Workers’ Rights to be Provided with Free PPE

Employers are required to provide the appropriate PPE at no cost to their employees when such equipment is necessary to protect them from job-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. This requirement is part of OSHA's broader mandate to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for employees.

This can include a wide range of equipment such as:

Safety glasses and goggles
Hard hats
Safety shoes
Chemical-resistant gloves
Respirators
Fall protection equipment
Hearing protection devices

There are a few exceptions where employers may not have to pay for PPE:

Ordinary clothing or weather-related gear
Items used solely for protection from the weather
Back belts and prescription safety eyewear (in some cases)

Employers are generally responsible for replacing PPE as necessary due to wear and tear or contamination. However, if an employee provides their own PPE, the employer must ensure its adequacy and proper maintenance.

Workers' Rights to Refuse Dangerous Work

In extreme cases, workers may legally refuse to work if there's a clear risk of death or serious harm, OSHA can't inspect in time, and the employer has been notified but hasn't addressed the issue. However, specific conditions must be met for this refusal to be protected:

The worker has asked the employer to fix the danger (when possible)
The refusal is in "good faith," meaning the worker truly believes in the danger
A reasonable person would agree the danger is real
The hazard is too urgent to be addressed through normal channels

If these conditions are met, workers should:

Ask the employer to fix the hazard or provide different work
Inform the employer they won't do the work until it's safe
Stay at work until the employer tells them to leave

 

OSHA Employee Rights in Case of Injury or Illness

Employee rights aim to protect workers' health, safety, and well-being in the event of workplace injuries or illnesses. If employees believe their rights have been violated, they can file a complaint with OSHA or seek legal advice.

How to File a Safety and Health Complaint

Employees have the right to report work-related injuries and illnesses without fear of retaliation. This is a fundamental right that ensures workers can bring job safety concerns to their employer's attention without risking their jobs or facing other negative consequences. This right is protected by federal laws and is a key part of maintaining safe and healthy workplaces.

Steps to File a Safety and Health Complaint:

Clearly define the safety or health issue you've observed in your workplace.
If possible, bring the issue to your employer's attention through your company's reporting system.
Keep records of the hazard, any incidents, and your efforts to report it internally.
If the issue remains unresolved, you can file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
Choose your filing method:
Online: Use OSHA's online complaint form
Phone: Call your local OSHA office
Mail/Fax: Send a written complaint to your local OSHA office
In-person: Visit your local OSHA office to file a complaint
Include specific information about the hazard, location, number of workers at risk, and your contact information.
You can ask OSHA to keep your identity confidential if you wish.
Stay in touch with OSHA about the status of your complaint.
Can You Get Fired for Complaining to OSHA?

No, it is illegal for an employer to fire, demote, transfer, or retaliate in any way against a worker for filing a complaint with OSHA. If you believe you've faced retaliation for reporting a safety or health concern, you have the right to file a whistleblower complaint with OSHA within 30 days of the alleged retaliation.

Remember, an employee’s right to a safe workplace is protected by law. Don't hesitate to speak up about job safety and health concerns - it could save lives.

Workers’ Rights to Workers' Compensation Claims

Employees have the right to file a workers' compensation claim for work-related injuries or illnesses. This system provides benefits to cover medical expenses and a portion of lost wages while the employee recovers. However, it's important to understand that this falls outside OSHA's direct jurisdiction, which focuses on workplace safety standards.

Workers' compensation programs are primarily managed at the state level, with each state implementing its own laws and systems to handle these claims. This means that the specific details of workers' compensation coverage, benefits, and claim procedures can vary depending on where you work.

If you find yourself in a situation where you need to file a workers' compensation claim, it's advisable to consult your state's specific workers' compensation board or agency. These state-level organizations can provide detailed guidance on your rights, the benefits available to you, and the proper procedures for filing a claim in your state.

How to File a Whistleblower Complaint

Under OSHA's whistleblower protection laws, employers cannot retaliate against workers for engaging in protected activities. Protected activities include:

Reporting a work-related injury, illness, or fatality
Raising a safety or health concern with the employer or OSHA
Providing information to a safety and health investigation
Reporting a violation of the statutes

Retaliation can include actions such as firing, laying off, demoting, denying overtime pay or promotion, or reducing pay or hours.

Steps to File a Whistleblower Complaint:

File your complaint as soon as possible. Depending on the statute, you have 30, 60, 90, 180, or 210 days from the date of the alleged retaliation to file.
Collect all relevant documents, including:
Your name, address, and phone number
The name, address, and phone number of your employer
Your job title and a description of your job duties
The date of the alleged retaliatory action
A detailed description of the retaliatory action
Names and contact information of any witnesses
Choose a Filing Method:
Online: Use OSHA's Online Whistleblower Complaint Form
Phone: Call your local OSHA office
Mail/Fax: Send a letter to your local OSHA office
In-person: Visit your local OSHA office
Clearly explain how your employer retaliated against you for engaging in protected activity.
After filing, an OSHA investigator may contact you for additional information.

 

Safe Working Conditions for Young Workers

Young workers have specific rights and worker protection designed to ensure their well-being on the job. If you're under 18, additional safeguards are in place primarily enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Here are some of them:

Minimum Wage: Employers can pay a youth minimum wage of $4.25 per hour to employees under 20 during their first 90 consecutive calendar days of employment. Laws such as the Equal Pay Act in the US require that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work.

Hours Restrictions for 14-15 Year Olds:

Cannot work during school hours
Maximum 3 hours on a school day
Maximum 18 hours in a school week
Maximum 8 hours on a non-school day
Maximum 40 hours in a non-school week

How to Protect Your Employee Rights

Protect your employee rights by thoroughly educating yourself about the specific rights and protections afforded to you under labor laws. Actively exercise these rights in your workplace, documenting any violations or concerns, and don't hesitate to report issues through proper channels. If you encounter significant challenges or complex situations, seeking legal assistance from an employment lawyer can provide expert guidance and support in navigating your rights and potential courses of action.

 

OSHA Employee Rights FAQs
What does OSHA do to protect employees?

OSHA sets and enforces safety standards, provides training and education, and conducts workplace inspections.

Can I refuse to work if I feel unsafe?

Yes, if you believe you're in immediate danger. You must inform your employer and attempt to resolve the issue first.

What are employees entitled to under OSHA?

A safe workplace, safety training, access to injury records, copies of safety standards, and the right to file complaints.

How many hours can you work in a day according to OSHA?

OSHA doesn't set limits on work hours. However, OSHA requires employers to provide a safe working environment, which includes preventing overwork that could lead to unsafe conditions. OSHA does consider a normal work shift to be 8 consecutive hours per day, 5 days a week, with at least 8 hours of rest between shifts.

How many breaks does OSHA require?

OSHA doesn't require specific breaks. However, some OSHA standards involve rest breaks in certain situations. For example, there are requirements for rest breaks in very hot working environments to prevent heat stress. While OSHA doesn't set break requirements, many states have their own laws that do require employers to provide rest or meal breaks. These laws vary by state.
