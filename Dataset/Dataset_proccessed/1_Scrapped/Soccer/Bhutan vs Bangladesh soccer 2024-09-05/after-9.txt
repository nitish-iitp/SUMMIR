PRATTVILLE -- The Trinity Presbyterian Wildcats fielded the same offensive line on Thursday in their 49-0 lopsided victory against Prattville Christian Academy as they did six days prior against Reeltown, but the difference was night and day.

Trinity managed 177 yards rushing in the first half as opposed to just 29 yards in their entire ground game last week against Reeltown.
