Fiji finishes perfect campaign as they beat Tahiti at OFC Nations Cup final group matchday

In a tense final group stage match at the OFC Men’s Nations Cup 2024, Fiji emerged victorious over Tahiti with a 1-0 win, ensuring both teams progress to the semi-finals in Vanuatu next week.

Roy Krishna’s historic 40th international goal, scored from a penalty, was the defining moment of the match, marking his third successful penalty in two games. This vital goal secured Fiji’s place at the top of Group B, setting them up for a semi-final clash against co-hosts Vanuatu in Port Vila on Thursday.

Tahiti, despite the loss, continue their tournament journey and will face the defending champions and favorites, New Zealand, in the semi-finals, also on Thursday. Tahiti started strong, with captain Teaonui Tehau driving their offense in the first half. Opportunities for Shawn Tinirauarii and Taumihau Shan threatened Fiji’s defense, but goalkeeper Isikeli Sevanaia stood firm.The decisive moment came around the 30-minute mark. Tahiti’s goalkeeper Teave Teamotuaitau rushed out to tackle Sairusi Nalaubu, resulting in a foul and a penalty for Fiji. Roy Krishna confidently converted the penalty, sending the ball straight down the middle and igniting celebrations among the home supporters.

Tahiti responded with determination, led by the relentless efforts of Tehau. Near the 60-minute mark, Tehau set up Tauhiti Keck, but Keck’s shot sailed over the bar. Matéo Degrumelle, who has been impressive throughout the tournament, then forced an excellent save from Sevanaia with a well-struck volley.

Fiji nearly doubled their lead late in the game when a poor back pass from Pothin Poma almost resulted in an own goal. Teamotuaitau managed to recover and clear the ball off the line, keeping Tahiti’s hopes alive.

However, Fiji’s defense held strong, thwarting any late attempts by Tahiti to equalize. The match concluded with Fiji securing the win, topping Group B, and setting the stage for an exciting semi-final against Vanuatu.

Both teams now turn their focus to the upcoming semi-finals. Fiji will leverage the momentum from their recent victories, while Tahiti aims to regroup and challenge New Zealand for a spot in the final. The stage is set for thrilling encounters as the OFC Men’s Nations Cup 2024 progresses.
