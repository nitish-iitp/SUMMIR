Preview: Ecuador vs. Peru - prediction, team news, lineups

On Tuesday, Ecuador will welcome Peru to Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado in Quito for a 2026 World Cup qualifier.

Ecuador are in sixth place with eight points to their name, while the visitors are languishing at the foot of the standings after mustering three points from seven matches.

Ecuador entered the current international window with a new manager after Sebastian Beccacece replaced Felix Sanchez following a quarter-final exit at the 2024 Copa America.

Beccacece was unable to take anything from his first game in charge as his side fell to a narrow defeat in their away meeting with Brazil.

Rodrygo's first-half strike proved enough to condemn Ecuador to a narrow 1-0 defeat, bringing an end to their five-game unbeaten run in World Cup qualifying.

While they may have experienced an unsuccessful trip to Brazil, La Tri still have one unbeaten streak to defend, having avoided defeat in each of their last nine home World Cup qualifiers.

However, they will be wary of the fact that their most recent home loss in World Cup qualifying took place against Peru in June 2021.

In contrast to their hosts, Peru were unable to make it out of their group at the 2024 Copa America, where they mustered just one point from their three matches.

After failing to score at the Copa America, La Blanquirroja would have been relieved to get on the scoresheet in Friday's World Cup qualifier against Colombia.

However, they would have ultimately finished the game in a frustrated mood after Alexander Callens saw his opener cancelled out by Luis Diaz's 82nd-minute equaliser.

As a result of the 1-1 draw, Peru are still searching for their first win of the qualifying campaign, with their three-point tally leaving them five points adrift of the automatic qualification places.

La Blanquirroja may at least be able to take some confidence from the fact that they have won three of their last four World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador (D1).

Ecuador are unable to call upon Club Brugge winger Alan Minda, who pulled out of the squad prior to the meeting with Brazil due to an injury issue.

Defender Angelo Preciado has completed a one-match suspension and is expected to come into the side for Tuesday's home fixture.

Enner Valencia will don the captain's armband, with Ecuador's all-time record goalscorer looking to add to his 41-goal international tally.

Meanwhile, the visitors are without the services of Franco Zanelatto, who was forced to withdraw from the squad before the 1-1 draw against Colombia.

Peru head coach Jorge Fossati could be tempted to select the same side that went close to claiming all three points against Colombia.

Gianluca Lapadula is set to offer one of Peru's main attacking threats, and the veteran forward will hope that he can add to the 10 goals he has scored for his country.


Ecuador possible starting lineup:
Galindez; Torres, Pacho, Hincapie; Preciado, Franco, Caicedo, Paez, Estupinan; Rodriguez, Valencia

Peru possible starting lineup:
Gallese; Araujo, Zambrano, Callens; Advincula, Cartagena, Tapia, Pena, Lopez; Valera, Lapadula



We say: Ecuador 2-1 Peru

Ecuador usually prove to be a tough team to beat in home qualifiers, and we think that they will make full use of home advantage to claim all three points in their meeting with a Peru team that has lost two of their three away matches in the current qualifying cycle.
