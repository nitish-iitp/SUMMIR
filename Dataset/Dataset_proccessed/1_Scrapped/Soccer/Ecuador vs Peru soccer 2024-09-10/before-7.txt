Short-handed LAFC battle to draw against Dynamo
ByField Level Media
Updated: Sep 8, 2024, 04:10 am

Hugo Lloris made four saves and short-handed LAFC preserved a 0-0 draw with the host Houston Dynamo on Saturday night.

With Denis Bouanga, Mateusz Bogusz and Cristian Olivera -- who have combined for 34 league goals -- among six LAFC players out for international duty, the Dynamo failed to take advantage of their superior personnel and earn a second win in as many weeks against the Black-and-Gold.

LAFC (14-6-6, 48 points) trails the Western Conference-leading LA Galaxy by four points, while Houston (11-8-8, 41 points) remained in seventh, one point above Portland.

After Houston's 2-0 road win last weekend against a much stronger version of LAFC, the Dynamo led 12-7 in shots and 4-2 in efforts on target. But all of Lloris' four saves were routine, with Houston's best opportunities failing to hit the target.

France's all-time leading international goal scorer Olivier Giroud made his first MLS start for LAFC after completing a free transfer this summer. The 37-year-old striker started alongside the 40-year-old Kei Kamara, in what was possibly the combined oldest starting striker pairing in league history.

Steve Clark made two stops for Houston, which has held LAFC scoreless in the teams' last four regular-season meetings.

Amine Bassi missed Houston's best first-half chance in the 21st minute, when he couldn't get on top of a bouncing ball close to the goal and skied a volley over the bar. And 17 minutes later, Ibrahim Aliyu also failed to hit the target on a promising look.

Ryan Hollingshead thought he had given LAFC the lead in first-half stoppage time, but Giroud was ruled offside in the buildup.

Houston fullback Franco Escobar got on the end of Griffin Dorsey's cross from the right in the 77th minute but fired well high of the target. His striking teammate Ezequiel Ponce also reached a cross in the 88th minute, but could only flash a header high while marked by two LAFC defenders.

Visiting center back Eddie Segura sent his effort directly at Clark in the 90th minute on LAFC's best chance after halftime.
