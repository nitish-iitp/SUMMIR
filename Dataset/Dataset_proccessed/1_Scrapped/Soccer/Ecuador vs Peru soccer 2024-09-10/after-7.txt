Ecuador will be without Alan Minda, who withdrew from the squad due to an injury ahead of their match against Brazil. However, they will regain the services of Angelo Preciado, who has completed his suspension and is expected to return to the lineup. Team captain Enner Valencia will also lead the attack, looking to add to his record 41 international goals.

Peru’s defensive structure may allow them to keep the scoreline respectable, but Ecuador’s more dynamic attack should find a way through, especially with key players like Pervis Estupiñán leading the charge.
