THAT'S ALL FROM ME
Right, thanks very much for joining me for that; a thoroughly enjoying game. If you missed any of the action, here's my full report. Enjoy the rest of your evening!
EURO QUALIFYING
PORTUGAL SWEEP PAST ICELAND IN EURO QUALIFYING ENCOUNTER IN LISBON

19/11/2023 AT 21:52

21:53
REPORT - PORTUGAL 2-0 ICELAND
There was no sign of the Beautiful South, but a dominant Portugal completed their 'Perfect 10' as they waltzed to a 2-0 victory over Iceland in Euro 2024 qualifying, ensuring they head to Germany next year on the back of 10 wins in as many matches.
The hosts, keen to sign off the campaign with a victory, enjoyed 78% of the possession in the first half and had 15 shots, six of them on target, but it took until the 37th minute to break the deadlock.
Joao Felix had two efforts saved, while Goncalo Inacio and Cristiano Ronaldo missed headers from close range, before Bruno Fernandes finally opened the scoring by firing home from just inside the box.
Things continued in a similar fashion after the break, as Hakon Valdimarsson superbly denied Ronaldo, before substitute Ricardo Horta finally made it 2-0 after a rebound fell at his feet.
Valdimarsson continued to play party-pooper deep into the second half, making further stops to deny Joao Cancelo and Raphael Guerreiro, before the latter was involved as Iceland hit the bar at the other end, deflecting Arnor Traustason’s shot onto the woodwork in injury time.
21:47
NO GOLDEN BOOT FOR RONALDO
He's unable to keep pace with Romelu Lukaku, who scored those four goals earlier against Azerbaijan. In the end, Ronaldo finishes the campaign with ten strikes from nine appearances; still not a bad return
21:45
ELSEWHERE TONIGHT
Euro 2024 bound Scotland were held to a dramatic 3-3 draw with Norway, whereas Spain sealed top spot in that group by beating Georgia 3-1.
In this group, Slovakia, who've also qualified for the Euros after finishing second to Portugal, won 2-1 away to Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Luxembourg beat Liechtenstein 1-0
21:43
WHAT IT MEANS
Well, not a great deal, actually, because qualifying in this group was already sewn up! But Portugal have made history, going through a European Championship qualifying group unbeaten for the first time, picking up 30 of an available 30 points, while Iceland's haul of ten points from as many matches is their lowest in Euros qualifying since their efforts to reach the 2012 tournament
90+4'
FULL-TIME: PORTUGAL 2-0 ICELAND
And there goes the full-time whistle! The Beautiful South aren't in sight, but it's a 'Perfect 10' for Portugal, as they complete a clean sweep in Group J thanks to goals from Fernandes and Horta.
90+3'
OFF THE BAR!
Iceland comes inches away from pulling one back! Oskarsson has an effort saved, but the ball falls to Traustason on the edge of the area. He pulls the trigger and Guerreiro gets a head on it, nodding the ball onto the bar!

A simple stop for Diogo Costa, as a cross from the left skims off the striker's head and floats into the 'keeper's hands

PORTUGAL SEEING THE GAME OUT
The tempo has dropped now from the hosts, but that's completely understandable. They've waltzed through this one

GUERREIRO'S FREE-KICK IS KEPT OUT
He swings a left footed delivery goalwards, but the 'keeper awkwardly palms away
78'
ICELAND TRY AND BREAK
They win an turnover in their half of the field and surge forward, but even then Portugal show their determination to defend the clean sheet as they get men back in what ends up being a seven on one scenario!

NO LET UP FROM PORTUGAL
They just keep going, don't they? Iceland are penned back on their 18-yard line. Portugal are hungry for more goals
69'
PORTUGAL HEADING FOR A PERFECT TEN
It's nine wins in nine from qualifying so far. Unless Iceland perform some kind of miracle, they're going to make it ten, and you'd expect them to be a force in Germany next year
66'
GOAL! PORTUGAL 2-0 ICELAND (Ricardo Horta)
The substitute scores with what must be his first touch! Felix's shot is saved, as is Ronaldo's rebound, only for the ball to spill to Horta, who taps into an empty net from five yards out
