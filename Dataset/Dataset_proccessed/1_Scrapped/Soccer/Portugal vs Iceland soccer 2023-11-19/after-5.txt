Portugal ratings vs Iceland: Cristiano Ronaldo goes missing but Bruno Fernandes steps up to make sure Roberto Martinez's side finish Euro 2024 qualifying with perfect record

The veteran striker was anonymous for most of the clash, but his ex-Manchester United team-mate was on hand to lift the Seleccao to victory

Portugal had to dig deep to claim a 2-0 win over Iceland on Sunday, in a game that was essentially attack versus defence.

Bruno Fernandes finally broke Iceland's stubborn resistance with a superb goal, as he drove an effort into the bottom corner from the top of the box after a clever flick from Bernardo Silva.

Ricardo Horta emerged from the bench to score the second, all but ending the game as a contest, as he tapped home after a Joao Felix shot was spilled. Cristiano Ronaldo attempted to fire the ball home initially, but only found the goalkeeper's face, and Horta tapped home the second rebound.

Iceland had a late rally, and hit the crossbar, but this was a comfortable evening's work for the hosts. The result ensures that Portugal finish their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with ten wins from ten, and they will surely be among the favourites at the tournament in Germany next summer.

GOAL rates Portugal's players from Estadio Jose Alvalade.

Goalkeeper & Defence

Diogo Costa (6/10):

Barely had anything to do all night until Iceland hit the bar in injury time.

Joao Mario (6/10):

Enjoyed a fair bit of the ball as he routinely drove forward. Wasn't quite able to impact the game in the final third but a strong showing nonetheless. Subbed for Guerreiro.

Ruben Dias (6/10):

A simple night. Dias is simply elite and Iceland had no way past him.

Goncalo Inacio (6/10):

Headed wide from six yards out in the first half but his defensive work could not be faulted.

Joao Cancelo (7/10):

Some superb dribbles down the left flank, switched to the right, and then had some superb dribbles down the right. A class act, who delivered some excellent crosses.

Midfield

Otavio (6/10):

A mishit cross looped onto the post early on. Dribbled well but couldn't really impact the play as much as he would have liked.

Joao Palhinha (6/10):

A composed operator in midfield, mopping up whenever needed. Not his most difficult night.

Bruno Fernandes (8/10):

Scored a stunning goal, driving a brilliant effort into the bottom corner from the top of the penalty area. Some exceptional passes, as he ran the show at times.

Attack

Bernardo Silva (7/10):

Assisted Fernandes' opener with an impudent backheel and was always available for a pass. Finds space so well and Iceland struggled immensely to pick him up before his substitution on 62 minutes.

Cristiano Ronaldo (4/10):

Headed an excellent chance over on the half-hour mark. Should have scored after a Felix shot was saved and dropped to him, but his rebound was saved and Horta tapped in instead. Mostly anonymous.

Joao Felix (7/10):

Such a clever footballer and continually found space in the tightest of areas on the left wing. Couldn't score himself but did everything but.

Subs & Manager

Ricardo Horta (7/10):

On for Silva and scored almost immediately, tapping home after a goalmouth scramble.

Raphael Guerreiro (6/10):

Replaced Joao Mario for the final stages and deflected an Iceland shot onto the crossbar.

Bruma (N/A):

On late on.

Joao Neves (N/A):

On as a late sub.

Roberto Martinez 7/10):

As comfortable as it gets for the Belgium manager. With a perfect record in qualifying, he will be confident of success in Germany next summer.
