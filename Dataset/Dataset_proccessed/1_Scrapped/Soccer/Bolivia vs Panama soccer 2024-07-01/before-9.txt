FANATICS ITALY S.R.L.

FANATICS ITALY S.R.L. is a “brick and click” enterprise that manages the official physical and online stores for top Italian football clubs and other prominent international brands, as well as the football retail brand thepitchfootball.com

Formerly known as EPI, it was founded in 1996 and started to operate in mail-order of sport merchandising. From Formula 1 to football, in 2002 it progressively extended its dimension by using internet technology with the aim of creating virtual shops, with a 360° in-house management of the entire sales process: from purchase planning to warehouse and store management, from customisation of individual products to marketing and delivery to the end customer.

Fanatics Italy enhances the value of the best sports brands through the sale of merchandising online and through dedicated official shops. The aim is to reach the widest target of customers/fans worldwide, through an efficient and integrated service. Customer engagement and continuous improvement of the offer are very important features of the corporate strategy.

In April 2023, EPI is acquired by Fanatics which rebrands it and launched Fanatics Italy, further consolidating its presence in the Italian market and laying the foundations for future growth.

July 1st 2024, Juventus and Fanatics have announced a wide-ranging partnership across ecommerce, retail, manufacturing and licensing that will see Fanatics manage all aspects of Juventus’ merchandise offering worldwide.

The new partnership, one of the most comprehensive and ambitious club deals ever agreed in sports merchandising, will run until the end of the 2034/2035 season, with Fanatics working alongside Juventus to grow its brand and merchandise offering to fans across Italy and into every corner of the world.

Fanatics, which as part of the deal will become the master licensee for the Juventus merchandise portfolio, will operate the business from its Fanatics Italy headquarters, utilizing both its local expertise and its global capabilities to deliver a world-class experience and access to products for Juventus fans all over the world.
