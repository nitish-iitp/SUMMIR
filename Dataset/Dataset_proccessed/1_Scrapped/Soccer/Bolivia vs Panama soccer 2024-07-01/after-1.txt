Panama beat Bolivia to reach Copa América quarterfinals
ByESPN News Services
Updated: Jul 2, 2024, 05:22 am

Panama beat Bolívia 3-1 on Monday to finish second in Group C and qualify for the Copa América quarterfinals after tournament hosts the United States were eliminated following a 1-0 loss to group winners Uruguay.

The win moved Panama, playing in only their second Copa América, up to second on six points, three more than the U.S., as the central American side reached the knockout stage for the first time.

Uruguay finished with nine points.

"We made history tonight, the first time that Panama advances to this round in Copa América," Panama midfielder Jovani Welch said. "We're so happy, and with great desire to reach the final and compete.

"We were nervous because with a draw the U.S. advanced, and when Bolivia equalized we got stressed and down but we insisted. We resisted until the very end. We scored the second, and got a wind of air. And then with the third we were able to pass."

José Fajardo, Eduardo Guerrero and César Yanis scored for Panama with Bolivia's lone goal coming from Bruno Miranda.

Bolivia exit the tournament after three straight losses having conceded 10 goals and scoring just one.

Bolivia needed a win with only a slim chance of staying alive in the tournament, but it was Panama who broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute when Cristian Martinez set up Fajardo.

The 30-year-old forward expertly controlled Martinez's header into the box, let it bounce and volleyed the ball past Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra.

Bolivia equalised in the 69th minute when they cut through Panama's midfield and defence, with Ramiro Vaca finding Miranda, who slipped his shot past the keeper.

Bolivia nearly took the lead in the 78th minute when Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera ventured out of the box but Miguel Terceros's long-range effort was thwarted by the retreating Panama defence.

A minute later, Panama wrested back control of qualification when Davis curled in a cross from the left and Guerrero connected with a glancing header -- his first goal for his country.

Yanis made sure of victory in the first minute of added time, blasting a right-footed shot into the top right corner after he was put through on goal, sparking wild celebrations at the Inter&Co Stadium.

"Today we had a lot at stake, we knew that even with a win we weren't sure we would get through, and after 1-0 we got into a rut, at times we had a lot of momentum, and that was when they got into the game and with the goal we got nervous but the reaction was good," said Panama manager Thomas Christiansen.

"If before starting this Copa America, we talked about qualifying with two wins, no one would believe it."

Information from ESPN's Lizzy Becherano and Reuters contributed to this report.
