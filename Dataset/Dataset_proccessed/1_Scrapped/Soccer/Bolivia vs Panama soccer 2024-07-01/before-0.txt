Preview: USA vs. Uruguay - prediction, team news, lineups

Faced with a potential early exit at the Copa America, the USA will wrap up group play on Monday by welcoming Uruguay to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.

A 2-1 defeat versus Panama this week has the host nation narrowly above them for second on goal difference, while it would take a massive implosion for La Celeste not to make the quarter-finals after they trounced Bolivia 5-0.

The return of Gregg Berhalter as head coach of the American team has been filled with inconsistencies from one match to the next, as the Yanks now face an uphill battle in their hopes of making the quarter-finals of this tournament.

Their 2-1 defeat marked the first time that they had failed to win a Copa America fixture when netting the opener since allowing four unanswered goals to Argentina in their opening game in 2007 (4-1 loss).

So far in 2024, this team have yet to lose consecutive games, following up their only defeat this year (5-1 versus Colombia) with a 1-1 draw against Brazil.

Coming into this match, the Americans have a slight edge for second with a goal differential of +1 to Panama's -1, but the US may need to win this match by more than one goal, given that the Bolivians have lost their last four encounters across all competitions by at least two goals.

The Stars and Stripes have lost four group stage matches at home in this competition, but they won their final group fixture when they previously hosted this event in 2016, 1-0 over Paraguay.

They are unbeaten in their previous four meetings with the Uruguayans across all competitions, holding them to a 0-0 draw in a 2022 friendly at Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City the last time out.

We saw another blistering start for Uruguay on matchday two of this tournament, putting them in the pole position to qualify for the last eight for a third successive occasion.

Marcelo Bielsa's men not only lead the Group C standings with six points, but they have a goal differential of +7, which is six more than the US in second, meaning that only a defeat combined with a Panamanian victory on Monday and a massive shift in goals would eliminate them from this tournament.

Bielsa will be banned from the touchline for this clash because his side came out late for the second half in both of their Copa America fixtures thus far.

A matchday three victory would assure them of topping their Copa America group for the first time since 2019, and it would also mark the first time they finish the group stage of this tournament with a 100% record.

These players have shown plenty of quality all month long, outscoring their last three opponents by a combined margin of 12-1.

Uruguay have not won a game when conceding in the opening half since a narrow 2-1 victory in a friendly versus Hungary in November 2019.

While they have only beaten the Americans twice, La Charruas came out on top in their only prior meeting against them at this tournament, 1-0 in 1993.

For this pivotal match, the US will be without Tim Weah after he received a straight red card against Panama, while Matt Turner was replaced by Ethan Horvath in the second half of that match with an apparent leg injury, and he is questionable for this match.

Tim Ream made his 50th career start for the national team this week, Cameron Carter-Vickers appeared in his first-ever Copa America encounter, replacing Gio Reyna in the second half, while Josh Sargent made his first appearance for the Yanks since November 2022.

Folarin Balogun had the only American goal on matchday two, becoming just the second player after Clint Dempsey to score in consecutive Copa America fixtures for this team, though the latter did it on three successive occasions in 2016.

There were concerns about the status of Ronald Araujo after he suffered a knock in the opening match for Uruguay, though he played the full 90 minutes against Bolivia, partnering with Mathias Olivera at centre-back.

Nicolas de la Cruz made his first start of the competition this week, replacing Giorgian de Arrascaeta, while Luis Suarez, Lucas Olaza, and Cristian Olivera all made their first appearances at the 2024 Copa America.

Maximiliano Araujo and Darwin Nunez each scored for the second match running, putting them in a four-way tie for the Golden Boot lead alongside Balogun and Lautaro Martinez (two), with the other Uruguay goals coming courtesy of Rodrigo Bentancur, Federico Valverde and Facundo Pellistri.

USA possible starting lineup:
Horvath; Scally, Richards, Ream, A. Robinson; McKennie, Musah, Reyna; Aaronson, Balogun, Pulisic

Uruguay possible starting lineup:
Rochet; Nandez, R. Araujo, Olivera, Olaza; Ugarte, Valverde; Pellistri, De Arrascaeta, M. Araujo; Nunez



We say: USA 1-3 Uruguay

It seems as though the pressure of being the hosts is getting the better of the Americans, who look vulnerable defensively and incredibly inconsistent.

There is little pressure on Uruguay heading into this fixture, but knowing Bielsa, we expect them to play aggressively and put away the opportunities presented to them.
