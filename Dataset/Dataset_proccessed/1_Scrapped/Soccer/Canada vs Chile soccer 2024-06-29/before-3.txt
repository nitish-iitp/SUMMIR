PREVIEW: CanMNT take on Chile in Copa América group stage finale, a win away from advancing

 Canada vs. Chile
Copa América 2024 — Group A
June 29, 2024 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT
Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, Florida

The Canadian men’s national team head into their group stage finale at the 2024 Copa América on Saturday against Chile in control of their own destiny.

Win, and they are off to the knockout rounds. A draw would also be enough for Canada to advance should Peru fail to defeat Argentina. If Peru win, and Canada draw, Les Rouges would be eliminated on goal difference.

For their opponents on Saturday, Chile, only a win is enough to advance after a 0-0 draw against Peru to open the tournament, and a 1-0 loss to Argentina. As a result, this promises to be a fiery affair between two sides desperate to get to the knockout rounds.

Canada are coming off their first-ever victory at a Copa América, 1-0 against Peru on Tuesday courtesy of a goal from Jonathan David. However, on a scorching hot day in Kansas City, Canada didn’t really find their footing in Tuesday’s match until Miguel Araujo was sent off in the 59th minute.

Under similar conditions on Saturday in Orlando, they will need an improved effort against a Chile side who are significantly superior to Peru technically, tactically and in experience. The combination of the opposition they are playing, and what is on the line, makes this Canada’s biggest test yet.

This certainly isn’t the golden generation Chile team that won back-to-back Copa América tournaments in 2015 and 2016. Gone are the likes of Arturo Vidal, Matías Fernández and Gary Medel. Eduardo Vargas is 34, Alexis Sánchez is 35, Mauricio Isla 36 and goalkeeper Claudio Bravo is still between the sticks at age 41.

The team has failed to qualify for the last two FIFA World Cup tournaments, and have just one win in six matches thus far in 2026 qualifying. Only eight places separate them and Canada in the FIFA rankings.

They will also be without manager Ricardo Gareca on Saturday, as he has received a one-match touchline ban for failing to arrive on time for the whistle. Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni has also received the same ban for his side’s group stage finale against Peru after his team was slow to return to the pitch at halftime of their match against Canada.

But Canada should know by now that no opponent can be taken lightly at this competition, not least of which a Chilean side with a championship pedigree.

Chile have failed to advance from the group stage just once in eight tournaments during the 21st century. There will be both expectation and desperation to get out of the group once again on Saturday night.

While goalless so far this tournament, they have plenty of attacking weapons that can hurt Canada. Sánchez, a teammate of Canada’s Tajon Buchanan at Serie A winners Inter Milan, and Atlético Mineiro’s Vargas are still top-quality players, while CSKA Moscow’s Victor Dávila has the potential to create havoc up front as well. Chile also boast Ben Brereton Diaz, who was excellent this season for Sheffield United on loan from Villarreal, but he has rarely been a preferred option under Gareca.

With that being said, Chile’s attack has been rather up and down in recent years. They have scored two or more goals seven times in 15 matches over the past two years, but have been held scoreless a further seven times.

While one of the biggest talking points for Canada so far this tournament has been the heroic play of goalkeeper Max Crépeau, Chile have been getting a similarly outstanding effort from 41-year-old Bravo. The former Barcelona legend made a stunning eight saves against Argentina, after four made against Peru in Chile’s tournament opener. At this stage in the competition, it will likely take something special to beat either.

Canada have actually met Chile four times before at the senior level, but not since 1995. A large number of the players for both teams on Saturday would not have even been born when that match was played, much less have any recollection.

Instead, there is new history to be made on Saturday. For Canada, making it out of the group at a Copa América would be one of the biggest accomplishments in the nation’s footballing history. Getting a result against a former tournament champion to do so would be a significant sign of the nation’s footballing growth.
