Preview: Togo vs. South Sudan - prediction, team news, lineups
By Joshua Cole

Togo will host South Sudan at Stade de Kegue on Wednesday in a World Cup qualifier, with both sides searching for their first win in the campaign.

The Sparrowhawks and their opponents are winless after two games, navigating a group that also includes Senegal, Sudan, DR Congo and Mauritania.

Match preview

Togo are keen to claim their first victory in World Cup qualifying after recording two draws, leaving them with two points from their opening two matches in Group B.

Paulo Duarte's men drew with Sudan in November and held Senegal to a goalless draw five days later. Since then, the West Africans have managed just one win - a 2-1 victory over Niger in March - followed by a 1-1 draw against Libya.

Togo will hope to reach another World Cup, their only appearance coming in 2006 under the guidance of the late Stephen Keshi, with German coach Otto Pfister taking charge during the tournament itself.

Qualification will be a tough ask in this competitive group, where only the winners progress automatically. However, the Sparrowhawks will be determined to give it their best shot, starting with a win over South Sudan in their first-ever meeting.

Meanwhile, South Sudan are participating in their third World Cup qualifying campaign and are yet to register their first ever win in the competition, having never progressed beyond the first round playoffs.

Nicolas Dupuis's men are bottom of Group B with a single point. They lost 4-0 to Senegal in their opening qualifier before drawing 0-0 with Mauritania at home.

The Bright Stars are winless in their last four matches, with a loss and three consecutive draws, including back-to-back draws against Sao Tome and Principe.

However, they will be hoping to avoid defeat, which would be their first away point in a World Cup qualifier.

Team News

Kevin Denkey has scored Togo's only goal in the World Cup qualifying series so far, and he is expected to lead the attack, flanked by Ihlas Bebou and Euloge Placca.

Loic Anthony Bessile and Djene Dakonam are the two players expected to play in central defence, while Steven Mensah remains in goal.

Having kept a clean sheet in their World Cup qualifier against Mauritania in November, we may see an unchanged back four featuring Joseph Dhata, Rashid Toha, Peter Maker and William Gama.

In attack, Ajak Riak is likely to start in the front three that also includes wingers Valentino Yuel and William Akio.


Togo possible starting lineup:
Mensah; Romao, Djene, Bessile, Amouzou; Narey, Aholou, Dermane; Denkey, Bebou, Placca

South Sudan possible starting lineup:
Mawith; Dhata, Toha, Maker, Gama; Adebo, Yoseke, K. Wani; Yuel, Riak, Akio



We say: Togo 1-0 South Sudan

Togo are a stronger side than South Sudan and they have the advantage of playing on home soil. The hosts also have more match winners in their ranks, which should help them edge this affair.
