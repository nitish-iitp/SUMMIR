Caitlin Clark probably isn’t having too much fun playing basketball these days, which is the primary reason she plays. Following her Fever team’s most recent lopsided loss to drop its record to 2-9 where she scored just three points, I wouldn’t be surprised if she went home and cried.

Today, most people are talking about the foul committed on her by Chicago Sky player Chennedy Carter two games ago. She hip-checked Clark from the blind side, knocking her to the ground. It was assessed a regular foul at the time but has been upgraded to a flagrant — although no fine or suspension was levied.
