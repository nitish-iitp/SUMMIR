How to Get to GBK to Watch the Indonesian National Team Match

 

Nestled in the heart of Jakarta, the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium (GBK) is not just a sports venue but a beacon of national pride.

 

Named after Indonesia’s first president, Sukarno, this iconic stadium has hosted numerous international events, including the 1962 and 2018 Asian Games.

 

Renowned for its large capacity and state-of-the-art facilities, GBK is a historical and cultural landmark that every football fan should visit. To reach GBK, you have several options for transportation:

 

Public Transportation:

 

TransJakarta Bus: The TransJakarta bus service has routes that stop near GBK. It’s an affordable and reliable option, but be prepared for a walk or an additional ride from the bus stop to the stadium.

 

MRT and KRL Commuter Line: Both the MRT and KRL Commuter Line offer stops around GBK, though you might need to take a taxi or ojek (motorbike taxi) for the final leg of the journey to the stadium.

 

Car Rental Services:

 

Looking for more flexibility? Consider renting a car. With TRAC, you can choose between self-drive or hiring a driver, giving you the freedom to explore Jakarta at your own pace before and after the match. This option also spares you the worry of finding transportation when the game ends.

Whatever mode of transportation you choose, planning your trip in advance is crucial. Avoid delays, traffic jams, and parking hassles by checking schedules and routes ahead of time. A well-planned journey ensures you arrive at GBK smoothly, ready to enjoy an unforgettable match day experience.

 

It’s Better to Leave Early When Going to Watch the National Team at GBK

 

Jakarta is known for its heavy traffic, especially during big events like football matches or concerts. Additionally, finding parking can be a time-consuming hassle. Although GBK Stadium has several parking lots, they often fill up quickly.

 

To avoid traffic jams and the stress of parking, it’s a good idea to leave early. Arriving early not only helps you avoid these inconveniences but also gives you the chance to secure the best seats in your ticketed zone and to chat with fellow spectators.

 

Wear Comfortable Clothes

 

The weather in Jakarta in June can be unpredictable, but it typically tends to be hot and humid, with temperatures ranging from 26-30°C (79-86°F). Due to the heat, it’s best to wear lightweight, sweat-absorbing clothes.

 

Leave your jackets and sweaters at home and opt for a comfortable t-shirt or a national team jersey. Avoid carrying large bags to allow for more freedom of movement. Since the match is held in the afternoon, bring a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself from the sun.

Stay Hydrated and Don’t Forget to Eat Before the Match Starts

 

To avoid fatigue from waiting or getting too excited while cheering, make sure you stay well-hydrated. Be aware that packaged drinks might not be allowed into the stadium, as they might be transferred to plastic packaging. Check the stadium’s policies regarding reusable drinking containers if you prefer to bring your own.

 

Supporting the national team at GBK requires a lot of energy, so it’s wise to eat beforehand. Consider stopping by a food place or preparing a meal at home to avoid sudden hunger during the match.
