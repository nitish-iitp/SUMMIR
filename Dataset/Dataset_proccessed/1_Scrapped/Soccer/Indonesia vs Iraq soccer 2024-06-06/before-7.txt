JAKARTA - Iraqi coach Jesus Casas admitted that his team was in high confidence ahead of the match against the Indonesian national team in the second round of the 2026 Asian Zone World Cup Qualification. However, he warned his team to remain vigilant with the movement of the home team.

The meeting of the Indonesia vs Iraq national team will be held at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium (SUBK), Jakarta, on Thursday, June 6, 2024, afternoon WIB. This match is important for the Indonesian national team, which only needs one victory to qualify for the third round.

As for Iraq, tensions have passed because they have already secured a place in the third round. In addition to that factor, Iraq will also certainly appear more confident because of the slick record from the previous meeting.

Jesus Casas' team defeated the Indonesian national team 5-1 at the first meeting of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers at their home.

However, for the coach, the results in the previous match would not make his team complacent because he was sure that each match would be different. The results of the previous match could not be a benchmark.

"It is true that we won in Basra (Iraq midfielder). We deserved three points in the 5-1 win at that time. However, I think this match will be very different," said the coach during a press conference ahead of the match in Jakarta, Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

"Every match is different and tomorrow's match (against the Indonesian national team) is also a different duel," said the coach again.

Will appear in front of opposing supporters, Jesus Casas did not rule out the fact that the match would be difficult. Therefore, he asked his players to enjoy the match in order to present maximum results.

"I think tomorrow is a tough match in this round (World Cup Qualification 2026) because I think Indonesia is a strong team."

"They played in order to qualify for the next Asian Cup. I expect an extraordinary match (between Indonesia vs Iraq)."

"I also hope we can enjoy the game. We will try to give the best version of ourselves in tomorrow's game," said Jesus Casas.
