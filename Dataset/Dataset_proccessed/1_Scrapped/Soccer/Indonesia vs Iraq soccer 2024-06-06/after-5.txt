The Indonesia national team still has a fighting chance in the final match of the second round of 2026 World Cup qualification in the Asian zone, after losing to Iraq. In the match which was held on June 6 2024 at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, Iraq beat Indonesia with a score of 2-0.

In the second round of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup Asia zone, the Indonesian national team was in Group F. There were four countries in Group F, namely Indonesia, Iraq, Vietnam and the Philippines.

There are forbidden words in this article which I am not allowed to translate.

Indonesia is currently in second place in the temporary standings of Group F. The Garuda team has already collected 7 points from five matches. Two matches have been successfully won by the Indonesian national team. Meanwhile, one other match ended in a draw and Indonesia suffered two defeats in the other two matches.

The captain of the Indonesian national team, Asnawi Mangkualam, controlled the ball during the second round of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers match against Iraq at the Basra International Stadium in Iraq on November 16, 2023.

After Iraq and Indonesia, Vietnam sits in third place in the temporary standings with 3 points from four matches. Vietnam has only won one game, while losing the other three.

The bottom rank in Group F belongs to the Philippines with only one point from four played matches. The Philippines only recorded one draw, which was obtained after a 1-1 draw against Indonesia in November 2023.

The four teams in Group F only have two final matches remaining. From this current standings, Indonesia has a big chance of qualifying for the third round of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup in the Asian zone. With 7 points saved, Indonesia only needs 3 points to secure the runner-up position in Group F. The additional three points will not be overtaken by Vietnam, which is in third place, even if Vietnam wins the remaining two matches.

In the last two matches, Indonesia will host Iraq and the Philippines. The match against Iraq will take place today, June 6, 2024, at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta. Meanwhile, the final match against the Philippines will be played on June 11, 2024, at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.

Looking at the track record of the two teams in their past matches, Iraq has been superior to Indonesia. According to Transfermarkt data, both teams have played a total of eight matches since 1968. Out of these eight matches, Iraq has won five, Indonesia has won one, and the remaining two ended in draws.

The last two matches between Indonesia and Iraq took place in 2023 and 2004. On November 16, 2023, the two teams met in the first match of Group F in the second round of the 2026 World Cup qualification. Iraq defeated Indonesia with a score of 5-1 at that time.

Two months later, Indonesia met Iraq again in the Group D qualifying round of the 2023 Asia Cup. The match, played on January 15, 2024, saw Iraq once again defeating Indonesia by a score of 3-1.

Traces of the Indonesian national team in the World Cup

Nevertheless, Indonesia still has a chance to win the match in its final game. Aside from the home factor, the motivation to advance to the third round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Asia qualifiers is the main support for the Indonesian national team in facing the Philippines on June 11, 2024.

If Indonesia successfully qualifies for the third round of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, the country will also automatically earn a ticket to the final round of the 2027 Asian Cup, which will take place in Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia's progress to the third round will also be an achievement in itself for Indonesia. The Indonesian national team took part in the 1958 World Cup qualifications in the Asia-Africa group. Indonesia qualified for Group 1. However, in the final four round to determine the champion who would represent Asia-Africa, Indonesia refused to compete against Israel in Tel Aviv (Kompas, 12/6/1994).

The next milestone was advancing from the 1986 World Cup preliminary round in Group 3B. At that time, the "Garuda" national team emerged as group champions after defeating India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. However, in the second round of qualification, the Indonesian national team lost to South Korea.

Furthermore, throughout 1990-2014, Indonesia has not succeeded in qualifying. In the 2018 World Cup, Indonesia was absent from the qualification for the Russia 2018 World Cup following PSSI's suspension by FIFA. Most recently, in the 2022 World Cup qualifying, Indonesia has also failed to qualify in the competition against the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. (LITBANG KOMPAS)
