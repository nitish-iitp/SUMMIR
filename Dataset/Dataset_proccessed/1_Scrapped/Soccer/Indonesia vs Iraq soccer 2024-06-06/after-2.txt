JAKARTA - Iraqi coach Jesus Casas has expressed optimism for the Indonesian national team after clashes at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium (SUGBK). Even though the Garuda Squad failed to win, he believes Shin Tae-yong's team will advance and accompany irak to the third round of the 2026 World Cup Qualification.

This was revealed by Jesus Casas after the meeting of the Indonesian vs Iraq national team on Thursday, June 6, 2024. In that match, the Garuda Squad, which was the host, fell in the hands of the Mesopotamian Lions with a final score of 0-2.

Although happy with his team's victory, Jesus Casas also expressed his desire to meet again with the Indonesian national team.

He also hopes that Shin Tae-yong's team will qualify for the third round. Moreover, according to him, the Garuda Squad is filled with great players.

"I think Indonesia will be the next team to qualify (to the third round of the 2026 World Cup Qualification)," said Jesus Casas in a press conference after the match.

"After this they (Indonesian National Team) still have to fight the Philippines here (SUGBK). With their current line-up of players, I am sure Indonesia will win against the Philippines," he said again.

Despite the coach's optimism, Iraq is the only team from Group F that has secured a place in the third round of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers.

Meanwhile, the fate of the Garuda Squad is still floating because it must go through one final match against the Philippines on June 11, 2024.

Even though he is aware that his team is safe, Jesus Casas does not want to get satisfied quickly. He still has ambitions to wipe out all the matches in Group F. In the last match, they will challenge Vietnam.

"We really want to win all the remaining matches. So, we are trying to beat Indonesia."

"However, Indonesia was also able to qualify to beat the Philippines in their next match and advance with Iraq," Casas said.
