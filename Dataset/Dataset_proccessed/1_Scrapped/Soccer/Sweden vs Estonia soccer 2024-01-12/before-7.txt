Preview: Sweden vs. Estonia - prediction, team news, lineups

Sweden will kick off their 2024 calendar when they face Estonia in Friday's friendly at the Stadio Stelios Kyriakides in Cyprus.

With the contest taking place in the middle of the season for many European leagues, the two nations will give valuable game time to a number of untested players.

Sweden are preparing to face Estonia for the second game in a row after the two sides faced off in the final fixture of Euro 2024 qualifying in November.

On that occasion, the Blagult recorded a 2-0 home victory thanks to goals from Viktor Claesson and Emil Forsberg in Janne Andersson's final game in charge.

Prior to the contest, Andersson had confirmed that he would be leaving his post following Sweden's failure to qualify for Euro 2024 – the first time that they have failed to reach the European Championships since 1996.

Having seen Andersson's seven-year stint come to an end, Sweden are on the lookout for a new permanent manager, leaving Daniel Backstrom to take charge of the team on an interim basis.

Although Sweden are unable to call upon their regular internationals, they will fancy their chances of claiming a victory, having won each of their last three games against Estonia without conceding.

While Sweden finished in third place in Euro 2024 qualifying, Estonia rounded off a disappointing campaign in the fifth and final spot in Group F.

Thomas Haberli's side lost seven of their eight qualifying matches, with their only point coming courtesy of a 1-1 draw with Azerbaijan.

Despite extending their winless run in European Championship qualifying to 19 matches, Estonia still have a chance to seal their place at Euro 2024 thanks to their performance in the 2022-23 Nations League.

After winning all four of their Nations League games to win promotion to group C, Estonia will face Poland in the semi-finals of the Euro 2024 qualifying playoffs.

With that crucial match set to take place in Warsaw in March, Estonia's current focus will be on Friday's friendly in Paphos, where they have the chance to beat Sweden for the very first time.

With their domestic league currently in the off-season, Sweden's squad is largely made up of players who ply their trade on home shores.

Armin Gigovic and Rami Al Hajj are the only two members of the squad that play overseas, with the pair currently playing for Midtjylland and Odense in Denmark.

Gigovic is also just one of six players in the group who have earned an international cap, highlighting the lack of experience in the Swedish team.

Like their opponents, the majority of Estonia's squad contains home-based players, although there are several members of the group currently without a club.

Meanwhile, Zulte Waregem's Kevor Palumets and Gent's Ramol Sillamaa are the only two individuals who play overseas.

While there may be a number of uncapped players in the group, the likes of Ken Kallaste, Nikita Baranov and Konstantin Vassiljev offer crucial experience.


Sweden possible starting lineup:
Widdell Zetterstrom; M. Karlsson, Eile, Tolinsson, Dahl; Ali, Bergvall, Gigovic, Nanasi; Kiese Thelin, Persson

Estonia possible starting lineup:
Vallner; Peetson, Baranov, Veering; Tur, N. Vassiljev, Ainsalu, Kallaste; Zenjov, K. Vassiljev; Lepik



We say: Sweden 2-1 Estonia

Sweden may have named an inexperienced squad for the trip to Cyprus, but we still expect them to have enough quality to edge past Estonia in Friday's friendly.
