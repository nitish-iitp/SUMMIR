HUNGARY (HUN)

EHF EURO 2022 did not end up the way co-hosts Hungary hoped. The team led by Istvan Gulyas received massive support from the Hungarian fans but could not make it past the main round, partly due injuries.

Two years later, some things have changed. Chema Rodriguez, once assistant coach, has taken over the head coach position. And various players have gained additional experience at top level, playing for some of the best clubs in Europe. Dominik Mathe has been wearing the Paris Saint-Germain HB colours for two seasons, Miklos Rosta plays under Xavi Pascual at Dinamo Bucuresti, and Gergö Fazekas has developed into a key asset for Orlen Wisla Plock.

Will it be enough for Hungary to finally deliver? Usually among the pre-tournament favourites on paper, Hungary have not made it to the semi-finals of a major event again since the London 2012 Olympic Games. And this handball-crazy country is eager for success.

Their preliminary round group at EHF EURO 2024 looks well balanced – with Iceland, Montenegro, and Serbia all being able to win points against each other.

In the qualifiers, Hungary suffered one defeat – at home against Georgia, but in that game many of the stalwarts were rested to give the young guns some playing time. Otherwise, they easily got past Switzerland and Lithuania, earning themselves the first place of the group.

With the bright individual talents showing up in their squad list, there are no reasons why Hungary should not be able to go far at EHF EURO 2024.

KEY PLAYERS
Roland Mikler
Goalkeeper

Roland Mikler will play at the EHF EURO for the eighth time, a record for the Hungarian national team, 16 years after making his debut at the EHF EURO 2006, when he was only 21. The goalkeeper has nearly 20 years of experience at the highest level, starting his professional career in Dunaferr, in 2002, and winning five domestic titles with Veszprém and Szeged. He was named male Player of the Year in Hungary in 2014 and male Goalkeeper of the Year seven times; also the All-star goalkeeper of the EHF Champions League in 2015. Since his teenage years, Mikler has DJed in his spare time, producing mixtapes for warm-up sessions for his clubs and the national team.

Bence Bánhidi
Line Player

Bence Bánhidi’s excellent performances led him to be named in the EHF EURO 2020 All-star Team, as best line player. He started handball by following his friends at age 14, as a back-court player at his local club Györ, after trying both football and basketball. He was first used as a left back, nicknamed the "small Bodo", as a tribute to international Richard Bodo, but switched to become a line player, due to his lack of stamina. Bánhidi was named junior handball player of the year in Hungary in 2015, a year after his debut in the national team at age 18.

HEAD COACH
José Maria Rodriguez Vaquero

José Maria (or "Chema") Rodriguez was coach of both Hungary and Portuguese club SL Benfica until the end of the 2022/23 season before focusing only on the national team. Before moving into the head coach position with Hungary in 2022, Rodriguez was assistant coach to Istvan Gulyas for three years. At club level, Rodriguez led Benfica to their first European club competition trophy - the EHF European League Men - in the 2021/22 season; as a player, he won two EHF Champions League titles with Ciudad Real and one World Championship title with Spain.
