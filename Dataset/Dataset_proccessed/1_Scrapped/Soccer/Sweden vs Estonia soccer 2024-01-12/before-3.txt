SPAIN (ESP)

Spain have been one of the most consistent teams – if not the most consistent – over the last six editions of the EHF EURO. “Los Hispanos” have made the semi-finals every time since 2012 and have won a medal in the past five editions, winning the title in both 2018 and 2020, silver in 2016 and 2022, and bronze in 2014.

This era coincided with the appointment of coach Jordi Ribera in 2016. He oversaw a great run, with some excellent handball delivered by Spain over these years using an excellent playing system which worked wonders both in attack and in defence. Over the past five editions of the EHF EURO, Spain boast an overall 66 per cent winning efficiency in the competition.

For EHF EURO 2024, Spain will once again be one of the big favourites and will hope to create more magic in the preliminary round, where they face Romania, Austria, and Croatia in Mannheim, being expected to start the competition with three wins in a row, setting them up nicely for another semi-finals berth.

Players like Joan Cañellas, Gonzalo Pérez de Vargas, and Adria Figueras will surely bring the experience to the table, but overall Spain have plenty of talent, as well as experience, to challenge for the trophy once again, having featured in the last four finals of the EHF EURO.

“Los Hispanos” will rely once again on the same core, albeit an aging one, but with plenty of talent and experience at their disposal. And with the return of right back Alex Dujshebaev, who missed the 2022 edition with a shoulder injury, Spain are likely to once again be considered as main contenders in this edition of the premier European national team competition.
