Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina was in Las Vegas, Nevada, in November to watch Raiders football when he got word that one of his officers — a suspect in a highly confidential FBI corruption investigation — might have been tipped off about the inquiry.

Medina learned the city’s Civilian Police Oversight Agency had notified DWI officer Honorio Alba Jr. that a top state court official had alleged “questionable conduct” related to Alba’s DWI arrest of a court employee more than two months earlier — an employee Alba never filed charges against.
