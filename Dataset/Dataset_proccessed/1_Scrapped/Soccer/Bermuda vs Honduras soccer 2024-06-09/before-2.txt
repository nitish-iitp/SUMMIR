Sachiel Ming was the happiest man on the planet after finding the back of the net for Bermuda in their opening 2026 World Cup qualifier against Antigua & Barbuda on Wednesday, which ended in a 1-1 stalemate.

The Gombey Warriors trailed 1-0 before Ming came off the bench in the 84th minute and grabbed the equaliser six minutes later to rescue a point for the visiting side.

“It was an unbelievable feeling and as you can see in the footage I look like the happiest man on earth,” Ming told The Royal Gazette.

The 18-year-old opened his account at this level after dispatching Kane Crichlow’s pass at the second attempt.

“Scoring a goal for your country is a special feeling that is cherished by all Bermudians,” Ming added.

Bermuda dominated the game but lacked cutting edge which ultimately denied them from coming away with maximum points.

The visitors were forced to chase the match after Raheem Deterville gave the hosts the lead in the 26th minute before Ming’s late heroics earned Bermuda a share of the spoils.

Nahki Wells, the former Bermuda captain, praised Ming for making such a huge impact with the game on the line on his senior national team debut.

“That’s amazing as an 18-year-old,” the Bristol City striker said. “It’s something I could not have dreamt of doing.

“I scored at a young age but it was such an important goal, so amazing on him.

“We do have a good bunch of talented youngsters coming through, which is great. So a lot of positives for the new generation and hopefully we can try and get a good result on Sunday because it’s not going to be easy.”

Michael Findlay’s team will host Honduras in their second World Cup qualifier in five days at Flora Duffy Stadium tomorrow evening.
