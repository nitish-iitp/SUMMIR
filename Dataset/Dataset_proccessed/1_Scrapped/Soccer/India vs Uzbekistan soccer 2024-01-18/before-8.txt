Australia will aim a win in order to secure their spot in the AFC Asian Cup knockouts.

After a win in their opening AFC Asian Cup 2023 game against India, Australia will look to continue their good run of form against Syria in their second group stage game. The Socceroos will face Syria at the Jasim bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan.

Australia are currently high on confidence after winning all their last five games. Syria on the other hand, managed a hard fought 0-0 draw against a highly-ranked Uzbekistan side in their opening fixture. It will be an entertaining clash as both teams will go all out for the win in this tie.

Players to watch

The defender was Syria’s best player in their opening game against Uzbekistan. His presence at the back made it impossible for the Uzbek forwards to score. Abdul’s ball-winning capability coupled with his physical presence and passing abilities have been a very crucial asset for Syria.

Jackson Irvine (Australia)

The midfielder put up a very strong performance in his side’s opening game against India. Jackson also won the player of the match award for his heroics on the pitch against the Blue Tigers. He scored the opening goal for Australia and was a constant threat to the opposition. Syria must put a pause to his creativity.
