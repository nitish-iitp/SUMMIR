India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian Cup 2023 Highlights:

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian Cup 2023 Highlights: India showed more intent in the early seconds of this game than they did in the entirety of their match against Australia. However, Uzbekistan made them pay for a lapse in defence and took the lead in the fifth minute. Uzbekistan doubled that lead eventually and India were two down within the first 20 minutes of the match. India, however, were looking like being able to make a strong finish to the first half with wave after wave of attack. However, Uzbekistan ended up scoring their third right at the stroke of half-time....Read More

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: FULL TIME! India 0-3 Uzbekistan

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Well a rather disappointing end to a match that was pulsating in the first half and for much of the second. Both sides were going through the motions really in extra time and the referee actually blew the whistle about three seconds before the five-minute mark. India yet to score in this tournament but they did come oh so close a couple of times in this match. But let's face it, they could not sustain the kind of pressure needed to make it look like the Uzbek defence was too bothered at any point in the game. That late third goal in the first half was probably too hard a blow for India to recover from. It did come against the run of play somewhat, India were looking good towards the end of the first half. There is still this little thread of a chance for India to go through to the knockouts and so for now, see you until the next match, which is against Syria on January 23.

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: A little scare for Uzbekistan

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Khusanov gives the ball away to Pandita and he was part of the final line of defence at the halfway line. It is a race between the centre backs and Pandita and the latter is hopelessly left behind, easy recovery for Khusanov. There will be FIVE minutes of added time for some reason. India 0-3 Uzbekistan.

Jan 18, 2024 9:49 PM IST

Jan 18, 2024 9:21 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 60 mins done

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Quality seems to have seeped out of the match at the moment. There was a good moment for India when Rahul got the ball and drove at the defence on the right. However, he was caught in two minds and the ball just harmlessly bobbed away past the touchline. Uzbekistan have also not been able to string the passes the Indian third the way they were in the first half.

Jan 18, 2024 9:16 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 55 mins gone, India 0-3 Uzbekistan

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: India have more of the possession but most of it is in their own half. Sayfiev threatens to break on the left but Jhingan stops him. The Indian centre back provokes a foul as well.

Jan 18, 2024 9:10 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: BIG CHANCES FOR INDIA

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 50 mins | Oh how unlucky are India there! Cross comes in from the left, Yusupov doesn't deal with it well and it falls to Rahul KP who takes a shot, the rebound falls to Apuia who is not in a position to shoot at all but he plays it to Chhetri who can't get hold of it first time. He gets another go at it and it is blocked by a defender to go out for a corner. That comes to nothing for the Blue Tigers. Oh goodness me what more do India need to do to score?

Jan 18, 2024 9:07 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 2nd half underway

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Allright then, what can India get upto in this second half. Uzbekistan get us underway at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium. That late goal in the first half must be a bit of a dagger into the Indian hearts but there is still an entire half to play. There are changes at half-time as well. India bring on Rahul KP is on for Manvir Singh, Uzbekistan bring on Abdirahmatov for Nasrullayev.

Jan 18, 2024 8:56 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: HALF TIME! India 0-3 Uzbekistan

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Football can be a cruel sport and it hasn't been too nice to the Indian team in this first half. Uzbekistan have not played extremely complicated football here. On the contrary, they have kept things simple but they have been relentless. No standing around and knocking off passes for them, when they are on the ball, there are forwards running everywhere and before India know it, they have a shot or a cross to parry away. Abbosbek Fayzullaev has been as dangerous as he was expected to be and he has made a nuisance of himself on the right. Masharipov, Urunov and Sergeev have been just as effective. In defence, Sayfiyev has been especially effectively in smashing the Indian players to ground whenever he gets a chance. India have a very difficult half ahead of them now.

Jan 18, 2024 8:49 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: GOAL! IND 0-3 UZB (Nasrullayev 45+4 mins)

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Well at the end of all that, it is Uzbekistan who extend their lead. Just simple football, cross comes into the box from the right, Nasrullayev first heads it to the post, then has enough time to turn in the rebound.

Jan 18, 2024 8:48 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 5 mins added time

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Good pressure from India in the dying embers of this half. One gets a feeling that Uzbekistan would be relieved to hear the half-time whistle at the moment.

Jan 18, 2024 8:45 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: SHOT FROM MAHESH!

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 45 mins | Free kick for India, sent in from the right into the mix. It comes out and Mahesh takes a shot from distance. Yusupov had to parry that one out and India win a corner.

Jan 18, 2024 8:44 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: India keep the ball

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 43 mins | The last five minutes or so have been a good period for the Indians, they have kept the ball in and around the Uzbek third. Mahesh turned around the defender marking him and tried driving into the box but he was soon dispossessed.

Jan 18, 2024 8:38 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: India break!

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 37 mins | India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Jhingan, Bheke and Gurpreet knock the ball around for a bit before it is played quite brilliantly to Poojary on the left flank. Poojary's cross into the box is almost turned into his own goal by Eshmuradov but it goes off the post. Then Mahesh flings in a low cross from the left, Yusupov punches it out and is flat on the ground face down after that. Sergeev takes it and goes for glory from the halfway line. Terrible shot though.

Jan 18, 2024 8:37 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Another chance for UZB

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 33 mins | Masharipov pings the ball right over Jhingan's head on the left, Fayzullayev is on his bike and he absolutely races to the ball. He gets a touch but by the time he sets up for the shot Sandhu is out and he collects it. Uzbekistan are running the Indian defence ragged. 2 mins before that, Uronov turned Mishra inside out on the right and picked out Masharipov on the opposite side. He plays it first time inside to Fayzullayev on the overlap, the latter whips it in and Bheke clears it off.

Jan 18, 2024 8:32 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 28 mins gone, IND 0-2 UZB

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: India win a free kick on the left not far outside the box. Chhetri tries a little training ground routine first but that was before the ref blew the whistle and so India have to take it again. This time the ball is sent into the mix, Poojary heads it just wide of the target. This is better from India though, they are not being run over by the Uzbeks any more for now.

Jan 18, 2024 8:26 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 25 mins gone

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Fayzullayev has been a nuisance so far down that left hand side. Masharipov plays a little one-two with him and cuts inside and Fayzullayev sets off on a run into the box. Masharipov passes it further in to Sergeyev who lofts it to Fayzullayev first time. The latter squares it and it is cleared off by the Indian defence.

Jan 18, 2024 8:23 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Some Indian pressure now

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 21 mins | Apuia and Suresh link up well in midfield and the ball is worked to Manvir on the right. He holds it up and plays it out to the overlapping Poojary. His cross into the box could not be controlled by Chhetri. Then a mistake from the Uzbek goalkeeper and Thapa runs down the left with the ball. He then venomously squares it and it misses both Chhetri and Manveer in the middle. That was quite a chance for India.

Jan 18, 2024 8:18 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: GOAL! India 0-2 Uzbekistan (Sergeev 17 mins)

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Look away India fans, this is not a pretty sight. India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Manveer gives the ball away in a sloppy manner in midfield and Fayzullayev then sets himself free on the counter with a fantastic piece of skill to get past Bheke. Pulls back inside the half, Mishra comes sliding in, sticks foot out and that hits the bar. Off it comes nicely for Sergeev who taps it into the unguarded net.

Jan 18, 2024 8:14 PM IST
India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: 14 mins gone, India 0-1 Uzbekistan

India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Some good play from India at last with Bheke managing to win the ball in his third and passing it out to Thapa. He drives forward and plays a lofted pass to the right that Manveer chases down. But the space that he had for a second is closed down instantly by Sayfiyev
