India vs Uzbekistan Highlights, AFC Asian Cup 2024:  India fell to a second straight defeat at the AFC Asian Cup 2024 on Thursday, losing 3-0 to Uzbekistan, all the goals coming in a torrid first half for Igor Stimac's team. The result put Uzbekistan in pole position to qualify along with Australia from Group B with one round of matches to go. The Uzbeks were ahead within five minutes in Doha, through an Abbosbek Fayzullaev header, the 20-year-old CSKA Moscow winger nodding in Otabek Shukurov's looping header.  Their hopes of a comeback were extinguished during first-half stoppage time, Sherzod Nasrullaev exploiting some statuesque defending to notch a third. India, who were beaten 2-0 by Australia, sit bottom of the group with zero points and no goals.

Here are the Highlights of the AFC Asian Cup 2024 match between India and Uzbekistan:

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Time almost over
India will take heart from their showing in today's match but the lack of a goal will surely worry Igor Stimac. They were not focused in front of the goal and that can be a massive problem for them.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Two more chances
India continue to search for their first goal of AFC Asian Cup 2024 but two more chances go down begging. Ishan Pandita had the chance to make a run through the heart of the Uzbekistan defence but he was stopped by a well-time tackle. Brandon Fernandes went for a shot a minute later but not good enough to bother the opposition.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: So close yet so far
How have India not scored a single goal? Another humongous chance for India as Rahul Bheke connected perfectly with a corner. However, the Uzbekistan goalkeeper was once again up to the challenge and India's wait continues.

India have shown significant improvement when it comes to their defending. Uzbekistan were able to find space in the penalty box twice in the second half but the defenders were up to the challenge and they quickly shut down the chances.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Bit of a dull start
Both teams are somehow trying to settle down and as a result, the pace of the match has gone down significantly. A couple of chances on both ends of the pitch but no more goals in the match since half-time.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Big chance for India
India could have asked for a better chance. Rahul KP's shot slammed into the cross bar and the rebound fell to Chhetri but could not put it past the Uzbekistan goalkeeper!

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Back for second half
The first half was extremely forgettable for India as the Sunil Chhetri-led side ended up conceding three goals. They will need a good start to the second half if they want to salvage anything from this game.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Nazrullaev scores
This is just getting worse for India. Nazrullaev finishes an easy chance and they have conceded three in the first half! A very bad run of play for India as they were completely outplayed and as easy a finish that the footballer could have hoped for.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: India living dangerously
Sergeev had the chance this time but the score remains 0-2. Uzbekistan will be kicking themselves after missing at least 3 great chances to score. India living quite dangerously!

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: India with a chance
It is Uzbekistan all the way till now but India did find a small opening as Thapa won the ball at the edge of the opposition penalty box and although he was able to send it straight into the box, there was no one to tap it in.

Uzbekistan have scored again and this time, it is Sergeev! A total mess from the Indian defence and at the end, it was a very simple finish. Rahul Bheke made a mess of a clearance and although Mishra did get a final touch on the ball, it was not enough to stop the goal.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Under pressure
It is all Uzbekistan till now in this game and this is not good news for India. Another confident shot from Khusanov but it was far away from the goal. India have been pushed on the back foot and they are mainly restricted to tough defending at the moment.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: India one goal behind
Fayzullaev has scored and India have conceded a massive goal early. A good inswinging cross from Nasrullaev and the striker was in the perfect position to complete the finish. Gurpreet had no chance as India trail in the second game of the group stages.

India vs Uzbekistan Live Updates: Big match for India
The Indian cricket team started the match against Australia well but a few errors were enough to put an end to their hopes of a win. Against Uzbekistan, they have a slightly lower ranked opponent but the challenge will not be less at all.
