Cristian Romero spoke about scoring for the Argentina national team against El Salvador.

Romero scored Argentina’s first goal in their 3-0 win vs. El Salvador and he now has three goals with the Argentina national team. The 25 year old spoke about his goal, the team and the young players. Here is what he had to say:

“We played a great game. We keep growing, they are the last matches before the Copa America and we continue with the same motivation and the same desire to have the national team at the top.

“We have a great group to keep achieving things. I always see Leo (Scaloni) well, with the same desire as always.”

“It’s always nice to score with the national team. I emphasize that the important thing is that this team plays in the same way against any rival.”

In regards to Alejandro Garnacho and Facundo Buonanotte:

“I have faced Garnacho and Buonanotte and I know they have enormous potential.”
