Argentina player ratings vs El Salvador: Angel Di Maria runs the show in Lionel Messi's absence as Albiceleste begin 2024 with a bang

FEATURES

La Albiceleste began 2024 with a thumping friendly win in Philadelphia, with the veteran winger crafting their victory in the final third

Without Lionel Messi available, Argentina flourished in Philadelphia against El Salvador as they ran out comfortable 3-0 winners. Their superstar and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner missed the match due to a hamstring injury he sustained at the club level for Inter Miami playing in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, and it was up to Lionel Scaloni to show what his squad could do without their talisman Friday.

The world champions put the pressure on from the opening whistle, and they did not let up for 90 minutes. Argentina outclassed El Salvador nearly every aspect of the match; from possession in the center of the pitch to crafty build-up play in the final third, they were phenomenal.

Tottenham's Cristian Romero put them up 1-0 early on with a booming header from an Angel Di Maria corner, with Chelsea superstar Enzo Fernandez doubling their lead before the break after a scramble in the box. Early in the second period, Giovani Lo Celso added a third off a Lautaro Martinez assist - putting them in cruise control for the rest of the match.

Argentina looked like proper reigning world champions Friday evening ahead of a summer showcase at the 2024 Copa America.

GOAL rates Argentina's players from Lincoln Financial Field...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Emiliano Martinez (6/10):

Kept a clean sheet, but wasn't really tested. When needed, he did exactly what was expected of him.

Nico Gonzalez (7/10):

A new position for the Fiorentina winger Friday. He filled in brilliantly at fullback, providing some sensational overlap play in the attack.

Cristian Romero (8/10):

Scored a booming header early on and was rock-solid in defense; couldn't ask anything more of him.

Nicolas Tagliafico (7/10):

Was subbed off early in the second half, but played valiantly in central defense - a position he's not familiar with at all. Did his job and executed transition play well with the midfield.

Nehuen Perez (5/10):

He was rarely tested defensively, but was a bit sloppy going forward. On a night where he was given a chance to prove himself to Scaloni ahead of Copa America, we're not sure he did.

Midfield

Enzo Fernandez (8/10):

Put on a passing clinic, scored a goal and was subbed off at halftime. The Chelsea midfielder did everything Scaloni wanted and more in his 45-minute showing.

Giovanni Lo Celso (8/10):

A really, really good display from Lo Celso - who has been struggling for consistent minutes at the club level. He showed exactly why Scaloni still trusts him in the XI ahead of this summer with a fantastic midfield performance and a goal to top it off.

Leandro Paredes (7/10):

Incredibly solid as the lone defensive midfielder, he connected well with the defense and the attack for transition play.

Rodrigo De Paul (7/10):

Pushed out into a wide role, De Paul successfully operated on the flank behind Di Maria during his 65 minutes on the pitch. A top performance from the combative Atletico Madrid man.

Attack

Angel Di Maria (9/10):

A brilliant performance as a second-striker alongside Martinez, Di Maria was crafty in tight areas and had a lovey assist off a corner kick on the opening goal.

Lautaro Martinez (6/10):

A slightly disappointing cameo from the Inter star, who struggled to find a clinical touch in the box despite numerous attempts. However, he had a lovely assist on the third goal for Lo Celso.

Subs & Manager

Nicolas Otamendi (7/10):

Subbed on at halftime, he helped close the match down and earn a clean sheet for the defense.

Alejandro Garnacho (6/10):

It felt as if he was trying too hard to force the ball into the box at times, despite being given chance after chance off the bench. He was everywhere on the flank for Argentina, but not necessarily in a good way.

Valentin Barco (7/10):

An eventful cameo, he thrust himself into the game immediately and looked up to the task, as well. A solid defensive showing, with play into the midfield.

Facundo Buonanotte (7/10):

A few bright movements in the final third, it's easy to see why Scaloni is considering him as a super-sub alternative this summer at the Copa America.

Alexis Mac Allister (N/A):

Subbed on late, the Liverpool star was composed in the midfield.

Nahuel Molina (N/A):

Subbed on with a little over 15 minutes to go, but the defense wasn't tested and he didn't contribute much to the match.

Lionel Scaloni (8/10):

Put on a clinic with what he had available, and played a few players out of position successfully. We need a larger sample size, and likely a better opponent, but Argentina look like Copa America title contenders under Scaloni - again.
