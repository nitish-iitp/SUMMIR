Use limited data to select advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.
Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Ecuador vs Chile: as it happened

Thanks for reading!

We're going to close out this live feed. 

They had to survive a scare right at the death, but Ecuador were good value for their win. Ángel Mena's first-half goal means La Tri are now that bit more comfortably ensconced in the automatic-qualification spots.

As for Chile, they have two tasks: appoint a full-time head coach, and turn around their qualifying campaign. La Roja are in increasing danger of missing out on a third straight World Cup.

Thanks for reading, and remember that you can follow live coverage of Brazil vs Argentina with AS USA's Paul Reidy.

Uruguay win again - will Argentina slip to 2nd?

Elsewhere in CONMEBOL qualifying, Uruguay have beaten Bolivia 3-0 and, as things stand, have leapfrogged Argentina at the top on goal difference.

Liverpool’s Darwin Núñez scored twice for Marcelo Bielsa’s team, either side of a Gabriel Villamíl own goal.

And in that 1-0 Colombia victory over Paraguay that I mentioned a moment or two ago, Rafael Santos Borré scored a first-half penalty in Asunción to win it for Los Cafeteros.

The Colombians look set to stay third, with a large lead now over seventh and eighth.

Ecuador continue to dominate Chile at home

Tonight's win for Ecuador also means that La Tri have now won six of their last seven home World Cup qualifiers against Chile.

And as Mister Chip notes, the Ecuadorians have taken 20 out of a possible 24 points at home to the Chileans in the current South American qualifying format (whereby every CONMEBOL team plays each other home and away). Only Bolivia have had less success in Ecuador than Chile.

As things stand, Ecuador will be staying in sixth, in the final automatic qualification spot. However, Felix Sánchez's men have now opened up a three-point lead on both Chile and Paraguay.

The Paraguayans were beaten 1-0 by Colombia today.

Peeep peeep peeep! Ecuador survive that late Chile rally and have their third win of this World Cup qualifying campaign.

For much of the game, it felt like the hosts were on course for a comfortable victory, but the Chileans improved in the second half - and almost snatched a late leveller.

My word! How have Ecuador survived that?! Chile have a triple chance to snatch a leveller.

First, Brereton meets Osorio's left-wing ball with a glancing header that bounces off the post. Alexis gobbles up the loose ball and fires a shot at goal from 12 yards or so out, but Domínguez parries. Again the ball falls to a Chile player - this time Dávila, whose drive is beaten out by a combination of Domínguez and Torres.

Every Ecuadorian in the Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado breathes a HUGE sigh of relief.

Ecuador keep it for a minute or so - and, given that they're ahead, that doesn't seem like the worst of plans.

Oh my. Ecuador have been much the better side, but they haven't put this game to bed and again Chile might have snatched an ill-deserved point. 

Breaking at pace, the Chileans work it left to Brereton, who squares it to Alexis at the top of the box. Alexis feeds it right to Dávila... who prods a limp ball into the box that's straight to a yellow shirt.

Chile had started the second half decently enough, but now Ecuador are really starting to turn the screw once again.

The hosts work it left to Caicedo, who takes one touch to steady himself on the left-hand side of the box - and thumps in a low shot towards Cortés's far corner. It looks to be flying into the net, but Cortés does very well to palm it away! A fine, fine save.

Receiving with his back to goal some 40 yards or so out, Páez turns neatly and sets off towards the Chile box. From just outside the area, he lets fly with a low, left-footed shot that looks to be arrowing into Cortés' far corner - but the Chilean keeper parries.

Unfortunately for Cortés, he parries straight to the feet of Mena, who sweeps the ball into the net.

Every time Chile have possession, Ecuador are winning the ball back very quickly indeed.

Indeed, the latest stat I have is 65% possession for the home side.

Now Ecuador work it out right to Preciado, who tries a neat flick to buy himself a yard to cross. It doesn't come off, and he ends up fouling Suazo. Free-kick to Chile.

Back come Ecuador, who are doing most of the early running in Quito.

The hosts can't carve out an opening, though. Pacho looks to slip a ball into the corner for Rodríguez to chase, but it's too long and runs out for a Chile goal-kick.

That's a fine save by Cortés to deny Ecuador an opener!

From the left, Pacho drifts a cross over to the far post. His ball is headed away, but only as far as Rodríguez some 10 yards out from goal.

In one movement, he controls and fires a powerful drive at goal - but Cortés tips it over!

At one end, Gruezo almost releases Rodríguez in behind the Chile defence, but can't find the striker.

At the other, Alexis feeds a neat through ball into the area to find the run of Aravena, who is in space to square it. However, he was just offside when he darted in behind the Ecuador defence to receive Alexis's pass.

Caicedo whips the corner deep into the Chile box - and after a moment's hesitation from the visiting defence, the Chelsea midfielder's delivery finally misses everyone and drifts through for a goal-kick.

Ecuador start on the front foot, keeping the ball for pretty much the entirety of the first three minutes.

After popping it about inside the Chile half, the hosts get Pacho into a position to charge towards the left-hand byline and win a corner.

Ecuador and Chile are out on the field at the Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado, and we're into the anthems. The visitors first.

We appear to have a very sensitive mic in the vicinity of the Chilean players. Their ability to hold a tune is not the best, by the sounds of things.

Ecuador on long unbeaten home run against Chile

Ecuador’s record in home World Cup qualifiers against Chile is very, very good.

La Tri have only lost once to the Chileans on home soil - and that was a 1-0 defeat all the way back in February 1977, in qualifying for the 1978 tournament in Argentina.

The countries’ most recent World Cup meeting in Ecuador was in September 2021, ahead of Qatar 2022. 

That game ended goalless - and was the first time in six home World Cup qualifiers that Ecuador had failed to beat Chile.

What the coaches said: Nicolás Córdova

Stepping into Berizzo's shoes: 

“It’s always a tough one when a coach leaves, because there’s a kind of period of mourning. We know it’s a difficult situation - above all, a coach usually has a bit more time to work with their team. And it’s particularly challenging in these circumstances, when you’re in World Cup qualifying.” 

Nicolás Córdova, Chile interim head coach

Players must show character in Quito:

“Above all, I hope we show plenty of personality in this game. I’m sure there’ll be moments when Ecuador are going to have us pinned back in our own half, and we’ll have to show our ability to defend. And I’m sure there are going to be moments when we push them back. We're going to have to be mindful of Ecuador’s ability to hit us on the break, as they’re very quick and direct in attack.”

Sánchez on Córdova: “I know him - he’s a really good coach"

Speaking to reporters ahead of today’s match, Felix Sánchez also talked about Chile caretaker Nicolás Córdova - a coach the Spaniard is familiar with.

“I know him - he’s a really good coach,” Sánchez said. “He’s very methodical, a keen analyst of the game. He’s very highly thought of, both as a guy and as a professional. 

“It’s true that he’s just come in and won’t have had a lot of time to get his ideas across, but I’m sure he’s going to send out a well drilled team with a clear game plan.” 

I’m assuming that Sánchez knows Córdova from their respective stints in the Qatari national-team set-up. The latter actually replaced the former as Qatar Under-23s boss in 2020.

What the coaches said: Felix Sánchez

Calls for Ecuador to play more attacking style:

“I know that the way we play isn’t going to be to everyone’s liking - I respect that. There are 17 million Ecuadorians, so it’s hard to keep everyone happy […]. We’ve just started a new cycle and we hope to keep on improving with time.” 

Felix Sánchez, Ecuador head coach

Clarion call to Ecuador fans:

“We’d like to see a full stadium. We’re going to go out there to win the game, make the fans happy and achieve our goal. The lads are clear on that […]. There are many things you can talk about [when discussing how to improve], but these lads always give their all. They’re raring to go, and it’s important that the crowd are right behind us.”

Felix Sánchez, Ecuador head coach

Chile without skipper Medal as Córdova switches things up

Ecuador, who are now coached by former Qatar boss Felix Sánchez, are bidding to reach their fifth World Cup since the turn of the millennium. 

Their World Cup record over the past couple of decades is all the more impressive when you consider that they didn't qualify for a single one in the 20th century.

Where are Ecuador in CONMEBOL standings?

As for Ecuador, they've won two and drawn two since losing their opening qualifier to world champions Argentina. However, a three-point deduction means La Tri are level on points with Chile.

The Ecuadorians were docked points by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after they were found to have used ID documents that falsified defender Byron Castillo's place of birth during qualifying for World Cup 2022.

Ecuador currently sit sixth, inside the automatic qualification spots by virtue of goal difference.

Chile out to avoid third straight WC absence

As I mentioned a few moments ago, Chile are bidding to reach their first World Cup since 2014. 

La Roja made it to successive tournaments in 2010 and nine years ago, reaching the knockout stages in both. It was the first time they had qualified for back-to-back World Cups since the 1960s.

However, the Chileans then failed to even make the intercontinental playoff spot in qualifying for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022. They haven't missed three World Cups in a row in nearly 30 years.

Chile reeling from Berizzo resignation

The Chileans go to Ecuador in a state of turmoil, following the sudden resignation of their head coach, Eduardo 'Toto' Berizzo.

Berizzo, who had been in charge since May 2022, announced his departure after Thursday's disappointing draw with Paraguay - a game that ended goalless despite Chile playing with an extra man for half of the match.

Ecuador vs Chile: welcome!

Good evening, good afternoon, good morning - whichever applies to you.

Welcome to our live-text coverage of Ecuador and Chile's matchday-six World Cup qualifier, which gets underway in Quito at 6:30pm ET/3:30pm PT.

The teams are level on points, but sit either of side of the dividing line between qualification and elimination - so it's fair to say that today's clash in the Ecuadorian capital is muy importante.

Team news should be dropping in about an hour's time.
