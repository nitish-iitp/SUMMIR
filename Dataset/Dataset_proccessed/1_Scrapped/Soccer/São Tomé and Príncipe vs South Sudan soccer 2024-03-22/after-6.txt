Albert Gomez said he wants Santa Fe’s best-kept secret to no longer be a secret at all.

The director of the Santa Fe Vet Center said one way to do that is to build a bigger, better resource center for veterans dealing with an array of emotional, physical and mental issues.

On Friday, Gomez joined others in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new veterans’ center off of Airport Road. The new facility, which will be about twice as large as the current 2,400-square-foot center on Brothers Road, is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. A grand opening is planned for sometime in early 2025.

Jake Lopez, president of Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 996, salutes during the Pledge of Allegiance on Friday during the groundbreaking at the new Santa Fe Vet Center.
