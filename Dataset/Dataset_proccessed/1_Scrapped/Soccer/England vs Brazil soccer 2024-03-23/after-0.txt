Use limited data to select advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

England - Brazil summary: Endrick winner, score, goal and highlights | International friendly

England vs Brazil: as it happened

Peeep peep peeep! Brazil are the winners at Wembley. It’s very hard to begrudge the visitors their victory. They created almost all of the clear-cut chances.

For England, it's a first Wembley defeat in three and a half years - and a little bit of a letdown, to be honest. The pre-game talk was that the hosts were, for once, favourites against the five-time world champions, but they struggled to carve out genuine scoring opportunities.

Brazil, meanwhile, bring an end to their three-game losing run. For Dorival Júnior, it's a dream start to his tenure as Seleçao boss. As for Endrick, well, as Clive Tyldesley once said: remember the name.

The Brazilians now travel to Madrid for a friendly with Spain, while England are back at Wembley for a clash with Belgium. Both those games are on Tuesday.

Thanks for joining! Bye!

The corner almost leads to a goal - but not for England.

Brazil break at pace, working it to Endrick in acres of space inside the English box. He tries to plant a sidefooted shot low into the net, but Pickford saves.

One last England attack. Can they salvage a draw?

From the right-hand channel, Foden drifts a cross over to Rashford at the back post, but again he's beaten to it and it's behind or a corner.

Oh, that's a crucial touch from Danilo.

Watkins does very well to get a cross away from the left-hand byline - he seemed boxed in - but his ball can't find anyone in a white shirt.

That's a lovely first-time strike by Paquetá, but it flies just off target!

At the top of the England box, Bruno Guimaraes touches it right to Paquetá, who's lurking on the corner of the area. He tries to send it across Pickford and into the far top corner, and Pickford his very happy to see it flash by his goal.

Now it's England's turn to create a neatly-worked forward foray.

Receiving on the left, Gordon waits for Chilwell's overlap before slipping the left-back into the Brazil area with a perfectly-timed pass.

Chilwell has Foden waiting, but his cut-back is blocked.

England recycle it back to Bellingham at the top of the box, where the Real Madrid man lays it off for Gallagher to strike. 

Gallagher gets plenty of welly behind his strike, but aims it a couple of yards past Bento's post.

Again it's slick forward play by Brazil.

Paquetá carries the ball into the England half, before playing it inside to Bruno Guimaraes. He quickly shuttles it out to Rodrygo, who's in space to strike first-time on the right-hand side of the area - but Chilwell does very well to block the shot.

That's nice combination play by Brazil - but nobody is there to get on the end of Vinícius' ball into the danger area!

Rodrygo works it to Wendell on the left, and he in turn plays it to Vinícius. The Real Madrid forward hares towards the England byline and plays it across Pickford's goal, but there's no-one in a blue shirt to connect with the delivery.

England win yet another free-kick on the right wing, and Foden will take.

Foden lifts it high to the back post to Rice, who has peeled off into space. He has too much time to chest it down and fire it low into the middle, but Brazil deal with it.

Walker is off - England are clearly taking no chances with that hamstring problem.

He's replaced by Konsa, who is making his debut.

Now England create their best chance thus far - but Watkins blazes over!

From the left, Bellingham lifts it to Gallagher at the top of the box. He then works the bouncing ball to the right to Watkins, who has space to burst into the area and shoot.

His first touch is good, but his second isn't. He fires well over the bar!

England enjoyed much the better of the opening 10 minutes, but Brazil are coming to life now.

First, Vinícius jinks past Walker inside the box, before tumbling to the turf under the right-back's challenge. No penalty, says the referee.

A moment later, Brazil work it to Rodrygo in shooting space in the area, but he flashes his low strike past the post!

Play is halted for a minute or so when Walker drops to the turf, clutching his hamstring.

He leaves the field for a moment's treatment... but is quickly back on. Let's see how he gets on.

Oh, that's a bad tackle by Bellingham. He catches Bruno Guimaraes with a very late challenge, and deservedly goes into the book.

Oh, that's a fine chance for Vinícius!

In the blink of an eye, the Real Madrid forward is released in behind the England defence, with Pickford coming out of his goal to narrow the angle.

Vinícius beats Pickford, but undercooks his shot! Walker has time to scuttle back and clear it off the line!

Now it's England's turn to keep the ball for a little while.

The hosts finally feed it left to Chilwell, who tries to whip a ball into the area, towards the penalty spot. Fabrício Bruno is in position to clear.

Brazil enjoy their first sustained period of possession, keeping it inside England's half for a good minute or so.

The visitors finally work it to Rodrygo, who has space to dart towards the England box and shoot. He zips a low effort towards Pickford's left-hand corner, but it doesn't have enough power or direction to trouble the keeper.

This time it's Chilwell who takes, clipping a curling ball into the box towards Maguire at the back stick.

The flag is up, though. Maguire had drifted into an offside position when Chilwell played the ball in.

It's Foden who'll deliver... and he almost catches Bento at at his back post! 

Foden whips a ball over everyone's head and, for a moment, it looks like it's going to drop into the far corner of the net. It flashes just wide, though.

England get their first chance to push Brazil back, Gallagher scampering forward and slipping it right to Walker.

Walker gets himself in a bit of tangle, but manages to work it back inside to Gallagher, who is fouled. A dangerous early free-kick for England on the right-hand corner of the box.

"We shouldn't mess with" flag - Sunak

The controversy stems from the fact that the shirt includes a multi-coloured St George’s Cross on the back of the collar, in what Nike have called a “playful update on the traditional red and white national flag.

It's a creative decision that has come in for criticism (from people who, if you ask me, need to get a grip - it's just a football kit).

UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, for example, said: "When it comes to our national flags, we shouldn't mess with them because they're a source of pride, identity, who we are, and they're perfect as they are.”

A long time since last competitive meeting

England and Brazil haven't crossed swords in a competitive match for over 20 years now.

That clash, as David Seaman won't thank me for reminding you, came in the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup.

Ronaldinho's fabulous/ridiculously flukey lob over Seaman's head earned the Brazilians a 2-1 win in Japan, on their way to their most recent world title.

Who is Dorival Júnior?

Dorival Júnior has had a long coaching career, but many of you may not be entirely familiar with him.

In two decades in the dugout, Dorival has coached a large, large number of Brazil’s major clubs: Cruzeiro, Santos, Vasco da Gama, Internacional, Atlético Mineiro, Flamengo, Fluminense, Palmeiras, Athletico Paranaense, São Paulo...

A Copa Libertadores winner with Flamengo in 2022, he left São Paulo to take up the Brazil post.

The Brazilian Football Federation turned to the 61-year-old after missing out on first choice Carlo Ancelotti, who signed a new Real Madrid deal late last year.

To find out more about Dorival, check out my colleague Calum Roche's profile of the coach.

While England are on a 10-game unbeaten run since losing their World Cup quarter-final to France in Qatar, Brazil's form is... dreadful.

The five-time world champions have lost their last three games - all 2026 World Cup qualifiers - and saw a long unbeaten home run come to an end in their most recent defeat.

The Brazilians' 1-0 November loss to Argentina was the first time they had ever been defeated in a World Cup qualifier on home soil.

Hello there! It comes with the house-sized caveat that it's only a friendly, of course. But, nonetheless, a match between England and Brazil at Wembley, a stadium dubbed by Pelé himself as the 'church of football', sounds rather appealing, doesn't it? 

Kick-off in London is at 7pm local time - about an hour and a half from now. If you're in the US, the ball gets rolling at 3pm ET/12 noon PT.
