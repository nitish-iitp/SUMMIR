EURO 2024 MATCHDAY 1 RECAP | CHIESA MVP IN ITALY WIN

Euro 2024 has kicked off, and there are nine Bianconeri flying the flags for their respective countries in Germany this summer. Saturday's games saw the first two Juventus players in action - with Andrea Cambiaso and Federico Chiesa featuring for Italy - with Sunday's action seeing Wojciech Szczesny and Dusan Vlahovic and Filip Kostic take to the field. Adrien Rabiot and Kenan Yildiz took to the field later in the week to round off the first fixtures of this year's continental tournament.

ITALY

Italy got off to a winning start thanks to a comeback victory over Albania in Group B. The opening 30 seconds couldn't have been worse, falling behind with just 23 seconds on the clock. But the Azzurri quickly regrouped and led after a quarter of an hour.

Chiesa started the game and was named as MVP - Player of the Match - while Cambiaso came off the bench with 77 minutes on the clock to help see the Azzurri through to the finish line. Both Federico Gatti and Nicolo Fagioli were unused substitutes on the bench for Italy.

Next up for the Italian Bianconeri is a game against Spain on Thursday.

POLAND

The first of Sunday's fixtures saw Poland take on Netherlands, with Szczesny in goal for his side. The goalkeeper was among his team's best, but it was not enough to avoid defeat in the final minutes of the match against the the Dutch, who emerged 2-1 victors.

Poland next face Austria on Friday.

SERBIA

On Sunday, Dusan Vlahovic and Filip Kostic took to the field from the start for Serbia in their match-up against the finalists of the previous year's edition, England. Jude Bellingham's first half strike secured a 1-0 win for the Three Lions, with Kostic forced off due to injury after 43 minutes, while Dusan Vlahovic played the full 90 minutes.

Serbia next play Slovenia on Thursday.

FRANCE

France began their EURO 2024 campaign on Monday evening against Austria. The match, which ended 1-0 in favour of Les Bleus, was decided by Wober's own goal a few minutes before the end of the first half. Rabiot was selected as a starter by coach Didier Deschamps, and remained on the pitch for 70 minutes before being replaced by Eduardo Camavinga. The French will next take on the Netherlands, who also took three points from their opening Group D fixture, on Friday evening.

TURKEY

Turkey took all three points away from their first match at Euro 2024, overcoming Georgia 3-1 in their Group F match-up. Yildiz was named in the starting line-up, as part of an offensive trident behind the striker, and featured for 85 minutes, even finding the back of the net in the first half, only to have his joy cut off as the goal was ruled out for offside. Turkey's next engagement in the tournament is scheduled for Saturday, 22 June at 18:00 CEST against Portugal, who overcame Czech Republic 2-1 in their first game.
