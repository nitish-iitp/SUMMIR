The most anticipated international European tournament kicked off Friday, June 14, in Germany. Euro 2024 will run until July 14, and if you know where to look, you can catch all of the 51 matches (not "games") right here in the U.S.

How to watch Euro 2024 matches

Most of the games will be played on the FOX networks and Fox Sport 1 (FS1), and five matches will be played on Fubo. You have only one option if you want to catch all of the games with a single subscription: Fubo Pro. The subscription is $79.99 per month and gets you access to all of the relevant Fox channels. If you only want to watch some games, you can get a seven-day free trial.

If you want some other streaming subscriptions that include FOX and FS1 (but won't include the Fubo-only games), DirecTV Stream, Sling Blue, Vix Premium, and YouTube TV + Sports add-on all get you both FOX channels to catch the Euro matches.

DirecTV Stream is $79.99 per month. The YouTube TV Base Plan is $57.99 per month for the first three months. Sling Blue will run you $40 per month, and you can stream on three screens simultaneously. Vix Premium with ads starts at $4.99 per month and can also stream on three screens simultaneously; just be aware the matches will be narrated in Spanish.

If you're considering getting one of these subscriptions, remember that Copa America will be starting June 20 and running until July 14. Copa America will also be streamed on FOX and FS1 so you'll get to enjoy both tournaments.
