Tonight’s Starting XI has an average age of 24 years, 95 days. The lineup also averages six caps.
Seven starters earn their USMNT debuts today, taking the total number of players to appear for the USMNT to 867. In order of each player’s Unique USMNT Number, today’s starting debutants are: Josh Atencio (861), Bernard Kamungo (862), Diego Luna (863), Patrick Schulte (864), Timmy Tillman (865), Brian White (866), Sean Zawadzki (867).
The seven starting debutants tie a modern era record for most USMNT starting players to earn their first cap in the same match, a mark first set in last year’s January camp friendly against Serbia. It also takes the total number of debuts under Gregg Berhalter to 67 in as many matches, pushing him past Bob Bradley into sole possession of second among USMNT head coaches behind only Bruce Arena (89 debuts in 148 matches).

Bruce Arena	89	148
Gregg Berhalter	67*	67
Bob Bradley	60	80
Bora Milutinovic	51	96
Lothar Osiander	51	18
Jurgen Klinsmann	50	98
*Number could increase by end of USA-Slovenia


Ten substitutes are also in contention to make their debut. The USMNT record for debuts in a match is 12, which occurred on Aug. 3, 1973 vs. Poland and Jan. 10, 1988 at Guatemala.
Five players are age-eligible for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris: Atencio, Kamungo, Luna, Morris, and Schulte.
Among the seven debutants, midfielder Timmy Tillman joins younger brother Malik in representing the U.S. Men’s National Team. The Tillmans are the 10th set of brothers to appear for the USMNT.

They are joined by Atencio (Seattle Sounders), Jones (New England), Kamungo (FC Dallas), Luna (Real Salt Lake), Moore (Nashville SC), Robinson (Atlanta United), Tillman (LAFC), White (Vancouver Whitecaps).
Veteran defender Miles Robinson captains the side for the first time today. He is the 15th different player to captain the USMNT under Gregg Berhalter.
Right back Shaq Moore earns his first cap since the 1-0 win against IR Iran in the FIFA World Cup group stage finale on Nov. 29, 2022.
Midfielder Aidan Morris appears for the first time since the 6-0 win against St. Kitts and Nevis during the Gold Cup group stage on June 28, 2023 in St. Louis.
Defender DeJuan Jones makes his first appearance since the 4-0 win against Oman on Sept. 12 in St. Paul.

The USA is 41-13-12 in 66 matches under Gregg Berhalter.
The USMNT is 0-1-1 in two previous matches against Slovenia. The teams first met during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when the USA rallied from a 2-0 halftime deficit to earn a 2-2 draw. They met in a friendly the following year, with the USMNT earning a 3-2 victory in Ljubljana.
Six substitutions are allowed in three different moments. Halftime does not count as a substitution moment.
