JAM (0) - CUBA (0)
1. Poorly refereed game.
2. Cuba had little attacking ambition.
3. Coach was innovative in formation (start 4-3-3 revert to 3-4-3 with Lattibudere at center back and Pinnock/Lowe wide back). There was more attacking flair from this team and lots of passes strung together, however, I temper it with the fact that it was Cuba. Overall, not bad coaching given that it was the first time the coach had the team together.
4. The field is not worthy of world-class football being played on it. As such, the overseas players will always find it difficult to be at their best.

GK : Blake (6) shaky on occasions. Showed a bit more with his ball distribution.
RB : Lembikisa (7.5) solid in both attacking and defending.
CB : Pinnock (8.5) my player of the game.
CB : D.Lowe (7.5) one of his better game recently. Somehow a yellow card found him......as it usually does. He needs to dump long passes from his arsenal.
LB : Bell (7) decent game, however, he doesn't offer much going forward, especially when we are in a 3-back set. I prefer Greg Leigh in that position.
RM : BD-R (7.5) his usual hard-working self.
DM : Lattibudere (7.5) arguably, his best game for Jamaica.
AM : Palmer (7) his best game for Jamaica, however, he is not the solution. With the opposition down to ten men, how can your attacking midfielder not find the gaps? Also, his tackling was poor.
RW : J.Lowe (5) hesitancy in front of goal and faulty shooting.
F : Antonio (7) threatening with most of his touches. He displayed good work-rate but missed a chance.
LW : Gray (8 ) on another night, with another goalkeeper, he would have scored at least two goals. The bumpy field didn't help.
SUBSTITUTES
RW: Nicholson (4) how he missed an open goal will remain a Jamaican football mystery. Made no contribution to the game.
W : Campbell (3.0) selfish and a bit wild.
LW: Dixon ( ) not on the field long enough to merit a grade.

Weren’t you the leader of the gang bashing Leon Bailey for making that exact point?

STEVE McClaren’s first game in charge of the Reggae Boyz ended in disappointing fashion as they were held to a goalless draw by Cuba at the National Stadium in the opening group game of Concacaf Nations League on Friday night.

Despite 21 shots and having a one man advantage for over 45 minutes, the national senior men’s team failed to breakdown the Cuban defence.

Michail Antonio had the first shot on target in the ninth minute but his close-range effort was comfortable for goalkeeper Raiko Arozarena.

The West Ham forward then had arguably the best chance of the first half when he latched on to Demarai Gray’s cross but found the woodwork. Jamal Lowe also had a great chance to put Jamaica ahead minutes later when he was one on one with Arozarena in the six-yard box but failed to get any real connection with the ball. However, the Reggae Boyz were given a man advantage in the 44th minute when defender Yunior Perez was shown a straight red after pulling down Antonio on the edge of box, preventing a clear goalscoring chance.

JAM (2) - HONDURAS (1)

1. Always tough to win in Central America, good win by the Boyz.
2. We still have a creative midfielder problem.
3. Campbell (but for his one moment of crossing the ball that led to the own goal) looked like he didn't belong on the field.
4. Dixon looked slow.
5. Pinnock/Blake - players of the game.

Honduras capital is a tough place for visiting team, not as high as Mexico City but there are atmospheric challenges.

Still waiting to see a player for Jamaica like Whisper was for KC!

Agreed, then you add in the crowd and it becomes even more challenging.
