I purchased a barreled action from them a while ago to put together my first "custom", albeit it's a trued remington with a Bartlein 3B. I haven't shot it a ton as it is mainly a hunting rig, but it hammers. They are great guys and are very responsive, even helping me track down parts for my build. I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again.

I have several from Deep South Tactical. The workmanship is terrific. Accuracy is guaranteed. Very fast turnaround. Prices are very reasonable.

He put a MTU Bartlein on my Bergara that shoots really well with most factory ammo. Shoots to the same point of aim as well. I took it out to 900yds a few weeks ago.

They spun me up an AI barrel when they were offing SH discounts. I provided the barrel blank and some loose guidance, they returned me a hammer in about a week. Clean machining, good comms. I wouldn't hesitate to have them do more work again.

Thanks for bringing this shop to my attention ,again . About the same drive for me.Had heard of them in the past , but forgot about them.
Have a guy 15 min. from my house that started building AR s and bolts ,oh three years ago ? His builds have shot impressive groups at 1000 ,1200 yds at his "out the backdoor " range, I bang steel there when its not any hunting seasons open . Holding off from giving him work, until he gets some more time under his belt.
Currently driving to Delhi La. to get work done. Will check these guys out for sure.

The builder in Delhi, La is excellent. Sixteen miles further West on I-20 in Rayville, La. is another excellent builder (Brian Allen) owner of A-TEAM PRECISION.

David has rebarreled and bedded two rifles for me. Both are " shooters" ,very happy with his work , however a shorter drive for me would be nice sometimes.

I’ve heard of David Christman many times .. I guess in this day and time with as many good builders using all the new day expensive equipment building them there are many good choices . I just really see no reason in a person shooting a rifle anymore not capable of 3/8 or better

Another happy Deep South customer here. Spun me a 20 inch 308 barrel for my terminus zeus. Fast turnaround, reasonable pricing, and that combo has killed a good bit of critters in the few years I’ve had it.
