Once again, the Concacaf Nations League belongs to the United States men's national team.

The Americans defeated Mexico 2-0 in Sunday's final at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The victory meant a three-peat for the Red, White and Blue in the Nations League and gave them bragging rights over their archrival.

Tyler Adams and Giovanni Reyna scored the goals for the winning side, while goalkeeper Matt Turner and the defense kept Mexico off the scoreboard.

Adams' goal shortly before halftime stood out, as he fired it from well outside the penalty box and broke much of the tension that dictated the back-and-forth start to the game. From there, Reyna also scored a beautiful goal during a prolonged dangerous attack for the Americans.

Yet it was Adams' strike that generated plenty of love on social media:

12,000 years from now, when our civilization is a distant memory, there will be a patch of synthetic leather buried deep under millennia of sediment. And that little piece of unrotten plastic will still remember getting kicked by Tyler Adams.

The USMNT were loving that Tyler Adams goal 🤪 <a href="https://t.co/tyadluLbks">pic.twitter.com/tyadluLbks</a>

Sunday's showing was quite different from the semifinal one for the United States. The USMNT barely scraped past Jamaica thanks in large part to a stoppage-time own goal that sent the match into extra time.

The Americans took full advantage with a 3-1 win, but it was far more nervy than Mexico's dominant 3-0 win over Panama on the other side.

Adams played an important role off the bench in that win over Jamaica and moved into the starting lineup for Sunday's final. The goal was long overdue and his first for the national team since 2018.

It was also just his second goal in 38 caps for the USMNT and couldn't have come at a better time or against a more notable opponent.

And it helped ensure the Americans were the ones celebrating at the final whistle.
