XI'AN, China - The hosts China beat South Korea 2-0 by Liu Chengyu's two goals here on Monday and claimed the championship of the Huashan Cup, a U-19 men's soccer invitational tournament organized by the Chinese Football Association (CFA).

The South Korea team showed advantage in the first half but was unable to convert a goal.

China replaced two forwards on the pitch to strengthen their attacks at the beginning of the second half and the opening goal came from Liu Chengyu's close-range header in the 77th minute.

In the 90th minute, the hosts enlarged their lead after the 17-year-old striker Liu dribbled to the left side closing to the end line and unleashed a shot in a counter-attack tactic.

After securing a 2-0 victory over South Korea, China lifted the trophy of Huashan Cup with two wins and one draw.

"This victory is a good way for our players to happily grow up. They did great jobs for tonight and for the whole tournament," said China head coach Dejan Durdevic, adding that all the team members will try everything to step-by-step be better for the preparation of the upcoming AFC U-20 Asian Cup that will hold in 2025.
