On a recent night in Merced, El Farolito SC won one of the biggest matches in club history underneath the Central Valley’s purple and orange skies.

For just the second time ever — and the first time in over 30 years — San Francisco’s so-called “burrito team” advanced to the third round of the U.S. Open Cup, the oldest nationwide soccer competition in the country.
