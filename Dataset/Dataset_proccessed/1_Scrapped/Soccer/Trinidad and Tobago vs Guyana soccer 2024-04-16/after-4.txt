EXCELSIOR IN DEBATE FINALS
By Brianna Thomas | Head Girl
Tuesday, April 16, 2024
Excelsior High School  has transitioned to the Grand Finals for both JPS and National Tourism Debates.
The team comprising Kimani Leslie, Brianna Thomas and Joshua Atkins, three upper sixth form students, hopes its success will help to again cultivate a vibrant debate culture at Excelsior High School.
In years gone by, Excelsior was a hotbed of debating talent with the likes of Raymond Walker, Antoinette Haughton and other notable students,  helping to embed the name Excelsior in the public consciousness. This latest debating team plans to reclaim that legacy.
This week's finals, and the expected success will be the first hopeful steps in realizing that goal.
Both Grand Finals will be held on the same day which is Thursday, April 25. The first debate begins at 11:00 at the PBCJ studios and the JPS debate is at 2:00 p.m at  the Science Lecture Theater 3 (SLT3) at The University of the West Indies, Mona.
