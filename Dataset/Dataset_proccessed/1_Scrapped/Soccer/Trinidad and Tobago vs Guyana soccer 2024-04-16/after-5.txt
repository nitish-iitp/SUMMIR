Owner and president of Central Sports Cricket Club Richard Ramkissoon has been removed from the Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board (TTCB) Premiership Committee by the TTCB executive.

In a letter sent to Ramkissoon on April 15, the TTCB thanked Ramkissoon for his services and informed him that “at a national executive meeting it was unanimously decided that you are no longer a member of the Premiership Committee of the TTCB.”

The letter addressed to Ramkissoon and signed by TTCB general secretary Altaf Baksh, also stated there were several public disclosures of Premiership Committee matters and public criticism via various forms of media which have painted the Premiership Committee and the TTCB in a negative light.

“This has resulted in a lack of confidence in your ability to function in the committee,” the letter added.

Reached for a comment on the developments, Ramkissoon could only confirm that he received the letter from the TTCB and that he wrote the Board seeking clarity on the allegations made against him.

Four from four for ‘Bongo’

BIG Brent Sam netted a brace as the Densill Theobald-coached Defence Force took an outright lead in Tier One of the Trinidad and Tobago Premier Football League (TTPFL), when hammering a youth-laden Terminix La Horquetta Rangers 6-2, before a big crowd on Boxing Day at the Arima Velodrome.

Also, it is now four goals in as many matches for Defence Force striker Isaiah ‘Bongo’ Leacock, who normally comes on as a replacement for Sam.
