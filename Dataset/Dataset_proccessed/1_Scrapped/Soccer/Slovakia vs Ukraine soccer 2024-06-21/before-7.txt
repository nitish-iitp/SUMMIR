Newcastle United goalkeeper helps make history in Frankfurt

Martin Dubrabka helping to make a bit of history on Monday.

A shock win for Slovakia over Belgium in Group E of these excellent, so far, European Championships.

It made it three wins in a row in terms of Newcastle United interest.

Fabian Schar and Switzerland won 3-1 against Hungary, then Kieran Trippier and England (Anthony Gordon an unused sub) followed up with the 1-0 over Serbia.

Now the NUFC keeper adding that third win out of three for NUFC players at these Euros.

Slovakia hanging on for one of the biggest shocks in the history of European Championships finals, well actually the biggest statistically. Never has one so low in the world rankings defeated one so high in a finals, Slovakia 48th in the world rankings defeating third in the rankings Belgium.

The 2pm Group E match saw Romania very impressive as they hammered Ukraine 3-0, so not the two teams at the top of the group that were expected.

Schranz scored the only goal of the game, for Slovakia, after only seven minutes and whilst there is that huge difference in world rankings, you would never have guessed it watching the game.

Belgium created plenty chances over the course of the match but then so did Slovakia as well. Slovakia the better team in the first half and knocking the ball about so well.

Slovakia play a brave passing it out from the back style and it does come with risks, Martiin Dubravka gifted possession just outside the box and Trossard should have equalised, only to lift it over the bar.

The Newcastle United keeper though made plenty quality saves and earned his clean sheet.

When he was beaten, others to the rescue, a defender clearing one effort off the line, whilst Lukaka denied two goals by VAR. A very marginal offside and then a very very dubious handball by a Belgium player in the build up for the second of the disallowed goals.

Martin Dubravka and his Slovakian teammates fully deserved their win, for both the quality of their play and the fightiing spirit,  the likes of De Bruyne, Lukaku, Onana, Trossard and Doku on the losing side.

Newcastle United players on international duty:

Saturday 15 June

Switzerland 3 Hungary 1 (Euros Group match)

The Newcastle United defender with a very good personal performance, playing the full 90 minutes as the Swiss deservedly beat Hungary.

Sunday 16 June

England 1 Serbia 0

England got the job done, eventually.

Anthony Gordon an unused substitute but Kieran Trippier playing the full 90 minutes and doing ok at left-back. His job to stretch things in attack up England’s left hand side, with likes of Foden not willing/able to stay out wide and instead continually drifting inside. With the plan clearly for all of England’s main attacking to be through the middle and especially out wide on the right.

That is where the excellent winning goal came from, a great ball from Walker putting Saka in behind and his deflected cross perfectly then flighted for Bellingham’s pinpoint run into the box and the header giving Serbia’s keeper no chance.

At the other end was Trippier’s main task though and with the rest of the defence he did well, especially after the break when England suddenly went all defensive and invited Serbia to go for the equaliser. The Three Lions offering zero threat in the second-half apart from sub Bowen’s cross where the keeper made a great save but in reality Kane should have given him zero chance with the header.

Pickford only had one shot on target to save all game and whilst the commentator and pundits raved about it, in reality it was from outside the box and straight at him, the England keeper tipping the ball over the bar.

The highlight of Trippier’s performance was when Serbia got into the box on the left and an equaliser beckoned for Serbia with Mitrovic waiting for the ball to be squared for a tap-in. However, the Newcastle defender covering his central defenders had got across and was too strong for Mitro who was sent sprawling  and claiming for a forlorn penalty.

Monday 17 June

Slovakia 1 Belgium 0

Martin Dubravka and his Slovakia teammates pulling off a massive shock, third ranked in the world Belgium beaten by a team ranked 48th.

Schranz scoring after only seven minutes and the Newcastle keeper and his international teammates more than matching Belgium. What a victory.
