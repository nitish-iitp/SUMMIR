Guinea have never lost in this fixture

Guinea and Tanzania lock horns at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium in neutral Ivory Coast on Tuesday at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Both sides are looking for their first time of the campaign after dropping points on matchday one.

Ranked 77th in the world, the National Elephants were beaten 1-0 by DR Congo in their opening game. Edouard Kayembe struck the only goal of the game in the 27th minute to hand the Leopards all three points.

Having qualified for each of the last three editions of the AFCON tournament, even reaching the quarter-finals of this year's championship, Kaba Diawara's side are aiming for bigger things at the Moroccan showpiece next year. But will have to pick themselves up here to get their campaign up and running.

Tanzania earned a point against Ethiopia as the sides played out a 0-0 draw. The Taifa Stars had nine shots in the game, but only two on target, as they seemed to have forgotten their shooting boots at home.

As a result, they are in third place in Group H, behind Ethiopia due to disciplinary points, and group leaders DR Congo.

Guinea vs Tanzania Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
The National Elephants have never lost in the fixture in their previous three encounters with the Taifa Stars, winning twice.
They won the first clash 3-2 followed by a 4-2 victory, both games coming within a few days of each other in November 1971 friendlies.
In their last encounter, the sides played out a 0-0 draw at the 2021 AFCON tournament.
The Taifa Stars are unbeaten in their last four official games, keeping a clean sheet in each of them too.
Kaba Diawara's have lost their last two official games after having won their previous three.
Guinea vs Tanzania Prediction

Guinea's slump in form means Tanzania have a chance to break the jinx and perhaps register their first win against the side, but they will have to up their attacking game for that.

The Taifa Stars boast one of the meanest defenses in the AFCON zone right now, and the out-of-form National Elephants will certainly find it hard to score against them. We expect Tanzania to secure a narrow win.

Prediction: Guinea 0-1 Tanzania
