South Africa’s ambassador to Sudan, Adv Mahlodi Sam Muofhe, rolled out the red carpet and welcomed Bafana Bafana to Juba after coach Hugo Broos’ charges arrived in the North-East African country on Sunday.

The South African senior men’s national team will tackle South Sudan at Juba National Stadium in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Tuesday, 10 September 2024 (kick off is at 3pm) just days after drawing 2-2 with Uganda at Orlando Stadium in the opening match of the qualifying programme on Friday.

Ambassador Muofhe said while Bafana Bafana did not arrive with a throng of fans in tow, they would not be alone at Juba stadium on Tuesday.

“South Africa and South Sudan have got a very strong relationship and our wish is that we watch a very good match on Tuesday free of hard tackles, understanding that more than just playing football, the two countries are also cementing their relationship,” he said.

SAFA NEC member and HOD of Bafana Bafana David Molwantwa said he was heartened by the warm welcome that the team received in Juba.

“On behalf of SAFA President Dr Danny Jordaan, I want to say thank you, and we are honoured by the kind of welcome and reception we received here as soon as we landed. We were made to feel at home, and we now have to deal with the task at hand and turn our attention to Tuesday’s AFCON qualifier against our hosts,” the Bafana Bafana HOD.

Broos’ charges wasted no time in getting down to business soon after arrival and hit the gym.
