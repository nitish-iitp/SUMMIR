Preview: Guinea vs. Tanzania - prediction, team news, lineups

Guinea and Tanzania will both be looking to round off September's international break with all three points when the sides go head-to-head at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium on Tuesday.
 
The home side kicked off their Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign with a defeat last time out, while the visitors could only manage a share of the spoils in their opening encounter.

Match preview

Guinea had little reward for what was a highly spirited display against the Leopards of Congo DR courtesy of a narrow 1-0 defeat at Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa on Friday evening.
 
Edo Kayembe's opener just shy of the half-hour mark proved to be the difference as interim boss Charly Paquille came away empty-handed from his first outing in charge after taking over from Kaba Diawara.
 
Consequently, the National Elephants have now been beaten in consecutive matches without finding the back of the net since winning three games in a row by a combined score of 13-2 between March and June.
 
Having featured in eight of the last 11 AFCON tournaments, Guinea have established themselves as regulars at this level, but a second qualifying defeat in as many matches could leave them with a mountain to climb in the battle to make it through to next year's event.
 
Tuesday's affair in Yamoussoukro will be only the second meeting between Guinea and Tanzania since a group-stage clash at the African Nations Championship three years ago.

Tanzania would have been frustrated not to have secured maximum points in their AFCON qualifying curtain-raiser against Ethiopia at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday.
 
Hemed Morocco's men were superb in defence as they limited their opponents to no efforts on target over the 90 minutes but could not find the all-important goal at the other end to emerge victorious.
 
That is becoming an all too familiar story for the Taifa Stars, who have recorded just three wins in 2024 despite keeping six clean sheets, which is largely due to their failure to score in six of their 11 outings.
 
Nonetheless, Tanzania have still made a bright start to their World Cup qualifying campaign, picking up six points from a possible nine to sit third in Group E, level on points with Niger and three shy of Morocco.
 
One of three teams to have been confirmed as hosts of the 2027 AFCON, Tuesday's visitors now have the opportunity to make three straight appearances on the continental scene off the back of their early exit in Ivory Coast earlier this year.

Unsurprisingly, Serhou Guirassy was unable to play any part for Guinea against Congo DR last time out as the forward continues to nurse a niggling knee injury.
 
Guirassy's absence for the home team meant that the burden of attacking responsibility fell on the shoulders of Mohamed Bayo, who was unable to add to his seven goals so far.
 
Making his first international start since March, Novatus Miroshi put on an industrious display in midfield for Tanzania, racking up an impressive nine tackles, and is expected to retain his place in the XI.
 
That represents bad news for Mudathir Yahya after the 29-year-old dropped to the bench, having to make do with a second-half cameo appearance against Ethiopia.


Guinea possible starting lineup:
Kone; S Sylla, Jeanvier, M Camara, Diakite; Toure; Kamano, M Sylla, M Camara, A Camara; Bayo

Tanzania possible starting lineup:
Juma; Husseini, Bacca, Job, Mwaikenda; Mkami, Miroshi; Balua, Salum, Kibabage; Mzize




We say: Guinea 1-0 Tanzania

Guinea's form has taken a hit over the last couple of matches, but they still possess more than enough quality to see off Tanzania.

While we expect the visitors to put up a good fight, we are backing the hosts to come out on top at the sound of the full-time whistle.
