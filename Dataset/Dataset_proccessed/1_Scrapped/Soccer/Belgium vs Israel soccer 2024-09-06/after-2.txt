Arne Engels proving his talent by making his international debut for a strong Belgian side…

Congratulations to Arne Engels on making his debut for Belgium in a 3-1 win over Israel in last night’s Nations League clash. It was Belgium’s home match but their association was unable to find a ground willing to stage a match against last night’s opponents, to the game was played in Debrecen in Hungary. Here’s Arne arriving at Debrecen International Airport ahead of the match.

Arne replaced Youri Tielemans in the 74 minute and had very little to do in a game that the Belgians had full control of, but it showed how highly he’s rated by national boss Domenico Tedesco who was willing to give the 20 year old some game time in a side packed with so much talent.

Belgium boast some big names in their midfield. Renowned world class talents like Kevin De Bruyne, Youri Tielemans, and up and coming stars like Amadou Onana and Jeremy Doku are some of the stars that the Red Devils can call upon, so the fact that Arne is regarded good enough to be selected alongside them is a testament to his talent.

We should all be grateful that that we’ve landed a superb player. At £11 million Arne is our record signing and I’m sure that he will prove to be a bargain once he’s settled at the club. Arne is going to be a star, let’s enjoy him while he’s here as he’s destined to go to the very top.

Just an Ordinary Bhoy
