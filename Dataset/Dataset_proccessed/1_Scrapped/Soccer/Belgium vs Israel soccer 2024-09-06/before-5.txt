Preview: Belgium vs. Israel - prediction, team news, lineups

Belgium begin their latest quest for some elusive silverware on Friday, as they meet Israel in the first fixture of a new UEFA Nations League campaign.

Playing in Hungary due to security concerns, the Red Devils will try to make a winning start, as Italy and France are their other opponents in League A Group 2.

Exiting in the first knockout round of Euro 2024 - and at the hands of neighbours France - brought more misery for Belgium supporters this summer, and doubts remain that current coach Domenico Tedesco can get a talented squad challenging for titles.

The Red Devils did not impress in the group stage either, so Tedesco will hope to turn a page on his first tournament in charge and ensure his side secure a top-two spot in Group 2 of the Nations League's elite tier.

That would guarantee a place in the newly expanded competition's quarter-finals, while finishing third will result in a relegation playoff, and fourth means automatic demotion.

Belgium cruised through Euros qualifying undefeated - and for the loss of just four goals - but they were previously unable to reach the last Nations League finals after finishing runners-up to the Netherlands.

Fourth place overall in the 2021 edition is their best result so far, and beating that mark must be the target for the season ahead - avoiding a slip-up this week, then, is surely essential.

The Belgians travel to France then Italy for their next two matches, so Tedesco will be expected to see off outsiders Israel, having come under more pressure after failing to heal his rift with Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Having previously lost four from four against their opening opponents - conceding 10 goals and scoring just one - history will not be on Israel's side at Debrecen's Nagyerdei Stadion.

They have been thrust into a fiendishly difficult group following promotion from League B in 2022, when they topped a group featuring Iceland, Albania and - initially - Russia.

Also present in the playoff semi-finals for Euro 2024, where they were beaten 4-1 by Iceland, the Sky Blue and Whites have been steadily improving, but they are still waiting to end over 50 years without a major finals appearance.

Before trying to end that wait in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup, Ran Ben Shimon's side are back in Nations League action this season, following summer friendlies which brought a 3-0 defeat to Hungary and a 4-0 win over Belarus.

On Monday, they will play in Hungary again, 'hosting' Italy in Budapest, as ongoing conflict in the Middle East makes holding games in Israel impossible.

In addition to the self-imposed absence of Thibaut Courtois, several familiar faces will be missing from Belgium's squad this month; most notably, Romelu Lukaku has been allowed to work on his fitness after a summer of uncertainty before joining Napoli.

Veteran defender Jan Vertonghen has finally retired from international football, while versatile Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard misses out despite featuring regularly at Euro 2024.

Italy-based duo Koni De Winter and Alexis Saelemaekers have both been called up, alongside Borussia Dortmund teenager Julien Duranville and recent Celtic signing Arne Engels.

Without Lukaku, Manchester City pair Kevin De Bruyne and Jeremy Doku should supply Lois Openda in the final third, Galatasaray striker Michy Batshuayi is still out in the cold.

Meanwhile, Dan Glazer, Sean Goldberg and Shon Weissman are Israel's most notable absentees, in a squad featuring four uncapped players.

Maccabi Haifa's Ilay Feingold is one of a quartet hoping to make their senior debut, but captain Eli Dasa is most likely to start at right-back.

Leeds United loanee Manor Solomon is set to start in attack, potentially alongside ex-Celtic winger Liel Abada.


Belgium possible starting lineup:
Casteels; Castagne, Faes, De Winter, Theate; Onana, Mangala; Bakayoko, De Bruyne, Doku; Openda

Israel possible starting lineup:
Gerafi; Dasa, Shlomo, Nachmias, Gropper; Kanichowsky, Peretz; Solomon, Gloukh, Abada; Baribo



We say: Belgium 2-0 Israel

Without home support, Belgium should go through the motions and secure maximum points, despite lacking their all-time top scorer and world-class goalkeeper: outside of major tournaments, the Red Devils tend to be ruthlessly efficient.
