STORY: :: Demonstrators clash with police as fires burn on the French island of Martinique

:: Le Lamentin, Martinique, France

:: October 10-11, 2024

The protests disrupted flights at the Martinique airport which were re-directed to the neighboring French island of Guadeloupe, the local French administration for Martinique said.

France announced on Friday new curfew measures to try and quell civil unrest on the Caribbean island, which has been hit by violent protests over the last month due to anger over rising living costs.

Martinique's local administration said it was banning public gatherings until Oct. 14, and banning the purchase of products that could be used for arson attacks.
