  
HAF corrects errors about the Foundation’s law enforcement trainings in Sacramento Bee article

On October 2nd HAF submitted the following letter to the editor, written by HAF Community Outreach Director Ramya Ramakrishnan, to the Sacramento Bee: 

“In Joe Rubin’s recent article “In the shadow of a freeway shooting lurks the fear of Sikhs threatened in California”, I have been misquoted and the work of my organization, the Hindu American Foundation, has been misrepresented. My comments on the well known gun and narcotic interdictions linked to pro-Khalistan gangs were misrepresented as specifically referring to the Fremont Gurdwara. Furthermore, HAF’s law enforcement trainings have nothing to do with the questionable notion of “soft transnational repression”. Rather, against the backdrop of recent vandalism of Hindu temples, attacks on journalists in Canada, open threats to HAF and other Hindu groups by Khalistan supporters and organizations, they have been done solely to educate law enforcement on Hindu Americans and Hinduism. Painting this work, as the article does, as being done at the behest of the Indian government is factually incorrect and a smear.”
