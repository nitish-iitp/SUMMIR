“If we don’t pass the group stages, we will not be happy,” Bafana coach Hugo Broos said, as quoted by TimesLive.

“Passing the group stages has to be our first goal, but it is the most difficult thing to do in the tournament. You are playing against three opponents who are 100% motivated. They’re 100% physically and mentally in order and they also want to pass the group stages.

“In a tournament everything is important. But let’s focus from the start on the group stages and try to qualify Bafana to the next round.”
