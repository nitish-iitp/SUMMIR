Mamelodi Sundowns‘ top marksman Peter Shalulile has finally revealed why he always tucks in his jersey close to his belly.

WHO INFLUENCED SHALULILE IN NAMIBIA?

The 30-year-old attributed his smart dressing to his upbringing in Namibia. He said his father always wanted him to tuck in his shirt. Shalulile said: “It comes from home. My father was, let me say in the NDF, like a cop [police officer]. He always wanted us to be smart.”

The DStv Premiership record goal-scorer said discipline extends beyond the field of play. Shalulile added: “It is not only on the field [of play] but off the pitch too. That is where it came from. When going to school, I used to tuck in [my shirt] and made sure that my pants were on top of the belly.”’

SHALULILE TALKS ABOUT LIFE WHILE GROWING UP IN NAMIBIA

The Golden Boot Awardee said it was impossible for one to be disciplined on the pitch only. He said discipline starts from home. The Sundowns forward explained: “Discipline is very important. Without discipline, you are nothing. It starts from home in terms of how you were brought up and you bring that into football.”

HOW THE PSL STAR FOUND HIS WAY TO SUNDOWNS

The speedy player first arrived in the PSL in 2015 when he signed for Highlands Park FC. The talented footballer arrived in South Africa from a Namibian side called Tura Magic FC. He then played for Highlands Park for five years, the last season being 2019/20, when he finished as the joint-top scorer with 16 goals. The Namibian shared the Golden Boot Award with Malawian Gabadinho Mhango. Mhango was then on the books of Orlando Pirates.
