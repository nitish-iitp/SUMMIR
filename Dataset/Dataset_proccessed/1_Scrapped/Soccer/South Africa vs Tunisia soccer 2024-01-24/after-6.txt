That’s all from me today. Thanks for tuning in to what was a rare dull Afcon clockwatch. I must have jinxed it in the preamble. May it be the first and the last of its kind. Catch you next time.

And before I leave you, here are the matchups for the last 16.

Nigeria v Cameroon

Angola v Namibia

Cape Verde v Mauritania

Group F winner v South Africa

Mali v Burkina Faso

Senegal v Third place of Group A or F

Egypt v Group F runner up

Equatorial Guinea v Guinea

Four of the six third placed teams advance to the last 16. Here is how that table stands:

1. Guinea: -1GD, 4pts

2. Namibia: -3GD, 4pts

3. Mauritania: -1GD, 3pts

4. Ivory Coast: -3GD, 3pts

5. Zambia: 0GD, 2pts

6. Ghana: -1GD, 2pts

We have known that Ghana are out, but Ivory Coast’s fate is still up in the air. If Zambia get a result in the 8pm GMT kick-off against Morocco tonight then the hosts are out. The waiting game for the players whose fate isn’t in their hands must be brutal.

Don’t think we’ll be getting much post-match reaction but let’s take a look at how these results affect the rest of the teams and to what lies ahead later tonight.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: Tunisia have a final corner … and the header is well off target. Their last chance is very anticlimactic.

Full-time: Namibia 0-0 Mali

Namibia await for the other game to finish but both these teams are 99% through.

Namibia 0-0 Mali: Two of the four minutes of added time gone. This will be such a historic night for Namibia if they can manage to hold on. Remember, with four points they can be one of the third placed teams that advance to the last 16.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: Five minutes added on. The referee could add 5000 minutes and I don’t think anyone wearing a red shirt would score.

“Five minutes of TORTURE,” exclaims the commentator, who is cheering for South Africa. I am not necessarily cheering for South Africa but I am inclined to agree, mostly because the football has been shocking.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: Jouini gets the ball on a platter and he is one on one against South Africa’s Williams but he cannot head the ball down on target.

Namibia 0-0 Mali: Namibia are minutes away from getting into the group stages for the first time ever. Traore of Mali hits a freekick straight into the wall.

All the Afcon magic has seemingly been used up. To be frank, both these games have been pretty boring, a first for the tournament. Play has stopped in both games due to fouls.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: Mokoena has a go from distance after a South Africa counter attack and it is just wide. They come again and win a corner. Zwane is called to be subbed off and he tries to go before the corner (which he is supposed to) but Laïdouni body checks him and a scuffle begins. Tunisia, who think South Africa are wasting time, continue to waste time. No cards given and no goal from the corner is all you need to know.

Namibia 0-0 Mali: A great save from Kazapua, who jumps up and catches the ball firmly with two hands after a cross/shot from Mali. And how about that keeper kit though? The most fashion-forward top of the tournament, I reckon.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: Abdi receives the ball in a dangerous area but Mobbie flies in and makes the challenge.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: After a triple sub, Tunisia are looking a little bit more forward thinking. Took them long enough. It’s not like we’re in the final 20 minutes and they need a goal or anything. Rafia, Achouri and Jaziri off for Ltaief, Sliti and Jouini.

Namibia 0-0 Mali: Bissouma takes a free-kick and goes straight for goal. It’s well off target.

Namibia 0-0 Mali: More subs from Mali. They clearly have little faith that anyone in this group is going to score a goal. Dieng and Diarra off for Camara and Dante.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: A more attacking sub for South Africa now as Maseko comes on for Morena. The sub scored in his country’s 4-0 win against Namibia.

Namibia 0-0 Mali: Mali now spring forward and Sissoko’s shot is deflected into row Z.

There is a paper with instructions making its way around the Mali bench. I am sure we’ll see it on the pitch soon. Will it have the magic formula that will lead to a goal?

Namibia 0-0 Mali: Namibia are generating some chances. Hotto, with his back to goal, lays it off to Katua, whose spinning shot goes the wrong way off the post.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: Here is a big substitution. Ben Slimane comes off for Youssef Msakni. The forward is a Tunisian legend and he makes his 100th appearance for his country. Let’s see if he can be a part of a fairytale story.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: So close yet so poor in the final third! Ben Slimane does so well to speed past his defender and get in a dangerous are in the box. He lays off a cross into acres of space but not a single red shirt is there! Where are the Tunisian players?! Do they not want to win this? It seems like it.

Namibia 0-0 Mali: This is a strange one. Éric Chelle has opted to hook both his strikers. Sinayoko and Niakate off for Sissoko and Doumbia. Would assume that the Mali camp are simply looking to preserve legs for the knockouts.

Kári Tulinius himself has got in touch:

It took me a mortifyingly long time to get Bob’s pun on ‘maali’, the Finnish word for ‘goal’, so out of embarrassment I’ll get behind Mali. Which is handy, since the team I usually support at AFCON, namely Ghana, is out. Go Eagles!

Even I got the joke, Kári! In all seriousness, Mali is a good pick. They seem to be preserving energy today but they have played some great football so far. They are also six time Afcon semi-finalists.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: A long ball over the top for Tunisia but it is an easy collect for Williams.

South Africa 0-0 Tunisia: A half-time sub saw Mobbie come on for Mudau. Not a major change of tactics which I think really shows that Bafana Bafana are happy to play out a draw.

Second-half: South Africa 0-0 Tunisia and Namibia 0-0 Mali

We’re back underway at both stadiums.

There was a delay in kick-off in the South Africa v Tunisia game because they wanted both games to start at the exact same time.

As it stands, Mali win Group E and South Africa and Namibia would also progress.

We have yet to see a match end 0-0 at this Afcon. That streak might break today if neither of these four teams find their shooting boots.
