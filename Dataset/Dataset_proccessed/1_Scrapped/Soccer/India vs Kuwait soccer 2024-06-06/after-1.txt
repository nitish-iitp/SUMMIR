It is full time and the match ends 0-0. That is the end of Sunil Chhetri's career and it is an emotional moment for Indian football. A good match for India but they will need to win their next game against Qatar if they want to qualify for the next round.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Big tussle
A mini-brawl between Edmund and a Kuwait international with Sultan Alenezi stepping in between the two players. A yellow card and this was not a great way to close out the match.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Big chance
A brilliant piece of skill from Rahim Ali as he danced past a couple of Kuwait defenders and produced a solid pass inside the box. But the defenders cleared it once again and it looks like Sunil Chhetri may end up retiring without a last win.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: India living dangerously
Another defensive lapse from the Indian defenders and the Kuwait attacker almost made his way to the goal. However, the clearance came at the very last moment and the score remains 0-0. Will it change in the last 10 minutes?

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Pressure from India
This has been a frustrating stretch of play for India. Not much to show on the attacking front and although there were couple of runs down the flanks that looked encouraging, the final pass has been badly lacking in the second half.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: More pressure from Kuwait
While there has not been a lot of attacks lately, most of them have come from Kuwait. A controlled show from the visitors and India are finding it difficult to launch the counter-attacks that served them well in this match.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: A slight lull
The second half started on such a frantic manner that it seems like not much has happened in the past few minutes. A much more controlled show from both the teams and it seems like  the coaches may bring in some changes.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Chaotic start
Both teams are looking in a mood to attack and this is end-to-end stuff. A huge chance from India did not bear any fruit as the finish was not great. On the other end, Kuwait continued to search for the goal but still no success.

The second half is underway and once again, Kuwait start strong. A shot from a narrow angle but Gurpreet was once again up to the task as he saved it brilliantly.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Half-time
It is half-time and no goals in this game till now. India 0-0 Kuwait but both teams had a lot of chances. Sunil Chhetri found himself in space on one occasion and he will look to score in the second half as the Indian football team captain inches closer to his retirement.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Al-Rashidi comes close
Kuwait were able to withstand the storm somewhat and they found their own momentum. Al-Rashidi once again came close but his shot was just not up to the mark. Another attack from the Kuwait international but cleared once again.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: India not letting go
India are on the offensive and it is just waves after waves of attack. Chhangte has been the man to watch out for till now and Samad is also looking dangerous in the central role.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Sustained attack
A free-kick curled inside the box from Anirudh Thapa resulted in a blocked shot from Samad and the rebound from Jay Gupta slammed into the side netting. This is intense stuff from India!

India vs Kuwait LIVE: So close!
Jay Gupta received a brilliant ball on the wings and he was able to prove a pin-point cross into the box for Samad. However, the Kuwait defender did brilliantly well to come up with a block and this is a huge relief for them. India come agonisingly close and they will take a lot of heart from this attempt.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Not much from Chhetri
While the pre-match discussions were all about Sunil Chhetri, the Indian football team captain has been quiet till now. Not much in terms of delivery from his teammates and he will be itching to score in his farewell game.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Chhangte in top form
Lallianzuala Chhangte has been the pick of the Indian players till now. Quick movement and brilliant skills have made him a menace for Kuwait and he has already featured in two dangerous attacks. However, still no goals in this match.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: End-to-end attacks
India seem reliant on their counter-attacks and Chhangte was looking to create one within the first few minutes of the game. However, no fortunes for the player as he was stopped in his tracks. On the other end, Gurpreet once again showed great awareness to keep the Kuwait attackers in check.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Huge chance for Kuwait
A massive reprieve for India! Kuwait found themselves in a brilliant position with Gurpreet in a fix but the shot was just not good enough. Al-Rashidi makes a mess off it and a good save from the India keeper. India survive for now!

India vs Kuwait LIVE: Big game for Stimac
While all eyes are on Sunil Chhetri as he plays his farewell match, this encounter also holds special importance for head coach Igor Stimac. The recent losses has put him in a tough position and another defeat can worsen his situation.

India vs Kuwait LIVE: A golden opportunity for India
It will be a little far-fetched to imagine India in the 2026 World Cup in North America, but a win over Kuwait will take the team into the unchartered territory of being up against the best of Asia in at least 10 matches. That would also translate into some quality friendly games.
