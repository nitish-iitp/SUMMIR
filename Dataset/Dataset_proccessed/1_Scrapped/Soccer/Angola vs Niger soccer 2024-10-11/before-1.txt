High-flying Angola will be looking to open up a six-point lead in Group F of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they play host to Niger at the Estadio 11 de Novembro on Friday.

The Menas, who have failed to win any of their last 11 AFCON qualifying matches since November 2020, will head into the weekend looking to end this dry spell and end their run of two consecutive defeats against hosts.

Angola made it two wins from two in Group F of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers as they held on to see out a 2-1 victory over a resilient Sudan side at the Estadio 11 de Novembro on September 9.

Following a goalless first half, experienced striker Mabululu broke the deadlock from the spot in the 51st minute, and after Mustafa Karshoum hit back for Sudan four minutes later, substitute Randy Nteka struck in the 81st minute to hand the hosts all three points.

Prior to that, Angola kicked off their race for a place in Morocco with a 1-0 victory over Ghana on September 5, when Felicio Milson netted in the third minute of stoppage time to end the Black Stars' 24-year unbeaten streak at Kumasi's Baba Yara Stadium.

Pedro Goncalves's men have now won six games on the bounce and are unbeaten in their last 10 matches across all competitions, claiming seven wins and one draw since a 1-0 friendly defeat at the hands of Morocco on March 22.

This fine run of results has seen Angola rise to fourth place in Group D of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and clinch the 2024 COSAFA Cup in July, when they stormed to the final where they thrashed Namibia 5-0 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.

Angola will be backing themselves to make it seven wins on the trot this weekend as they take on an opposing side who have lost each of their previous two encounters, conceding five goals and scoring twice since June 2008.

Niger, on the other hand, failed to secure their first win in their quest for a first AFCON appearance since 2012 up and running last time out when they could only salvage a 1-1 draw against Ghana in Berkane.

Stade Rennais defender Alidu Seidu opened his international account on the stroke of half time to put the Black Stars in front at the Stade Municipal de Berkane but Oumar Sako struck in the 81st minute to force a share of the spoils.

Prior to that, Niger were denied a dream start to the 2025 AFCON qualifying campaign as they fell to a 1-0 defeat against Sudan at the Juba Stadium courtesy of a 51st-minute effort from Abo Eisa.

The Menas have now failed to win nine of their last 10 competitive matches — losing eight and claiming one draw — with a 2-1 victory over Zambia in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in November 2023 being the exception.

Head coach Zaki Badou will hope that September's result against Ghana can serve as a turning point for his side who have failed to win their last 11 games in the AFCON qualifiers, losing seven and claiming four draws since a 1-0 victory over Ethiopia in November 2020.

Angola have named a 25-man squad for October's qualifiers, including the likes of Zito Luvumbo, Gil Vicente man Jonathan Buatu and Red Star Belgrade striker Milson.

Twenty-eight-year-old forward Gelson Dala has netted 20 goals in 48 caps since his debut in June 2015 and we expect the Al-Wakrah man to spearhead the hosts' attack this weekend.

Clinton Mata has withdrawn from the squad after sustaining an injury while Casa Pia goalkeeper Ricardo Batista, who is the only new face in the Angola camp, will be looking to make his debut.

Meanwhile, Niger have called up 25 players for October's double-header, with Badou sticking with the majority of the players called up during September's international break.

That said, we expect to see a similar side that started the game against Ghana last time out, with Najeeb Yakubu, Oumar Sako, Alhabib Hassane Abdou and Abdel Rahim Alhassane in defence once again.

Yusif Moussa, Ousmane Diabate and skipper Youssouf Oumarou should retain their roles in the centre of the park while 26-year-old Boubacar Hainikoye and Kryvbas striker Daniel Sosah should lead the attack.


Angola possible starting lineup:
Nebulu; Bastos, K Gaspar, Carmo, Buatu; Milson, Fredy, Show; Dala, Mabululu, Luvumbo

Niger possible starting lineup:
Hainikoye, Yakubu, Sako, Abdou, Alhassane; Moussa, Diabate, Oumarou; Moutari, Hainikoye, Sosah


We say: Angola 2-1 Niger

Angola are currently firing on all cylinders and will look to maintain their fine run of results against a Niger side who set out in search of their first win of the qualifiers.

Despite being the underdogs, the Mena did well to secure a point against Ghana last time out, but we predict that they will struggle at the Estadio 11 de Novembro this weekend.
