Black Stars defender Alidu Seidu

Black Stars defender Alidu Seidu came out of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan with his stock rising due to his good performance in the game.

Ghanaians on social media took notice of the French-based right-back's impressive performance and hailed him for an outstanding display.

Alidu Seidu was commended for both his defensive and offensive performance, with Ghanaians taking notice of how he battled with the Sudanese wingers.

Offensively, Seidu made some good runs down the right and put in some good crosses, but they could not find connections.

While Alidu received praise for his outstanding display, Mohammed Kudus and Inaki Williams were heavily criticized for their inability to convert chances in the game.

The biggest chance of the game fell to both Kudus and Inaki, with Kudus missing from just two yards away from the net.

The draw against Sudan at the Accra Sports Stadium on Thursday, October 10, 2024, means that Ghana is yet to win a game in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

In three matches played against Angola, Niger, and Sudan, the Black Stars have drawn two and lost one.

They now face an uphill task in qualification when they meet Sudan in the reverse fixture in Libya on October 14, 2024.
