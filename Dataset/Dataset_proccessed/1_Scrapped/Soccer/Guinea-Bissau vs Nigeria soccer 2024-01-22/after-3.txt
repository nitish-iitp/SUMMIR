TELL ME MORE

There was little to separate the two teams until a cross came into the Guinea-Bissau box in the first half and defender Opa Sangante lashed at it, inadvertently sending it into his own goal.

Nigeria had a great chance to double their lead when Moses Simon was sent through on goal just two minutes into the second-half but goalkeeper Jonas Mendes did a great job in getting low to stop the winger. Seconds later, Mendes came rushing out to prevent Victor Osimhen from getting onto the ball and causing some trouble.

Nigeria kept knocking at the door and shortly after Osimhen saw a difficult header just miss the target, the Napoli star fired in his team's second goal but it was ruled out by the referee. Osimhen had another chance to score when Ola Aina whipped in a great cross but the forward's header went wide again.

Guinea-Bissau thought they had pulled level late on through Franculino Dju but the assistant's flag denied him. Nigeria responded by lashing in another goal but it was also disallowed and the Super Eagles held out for the 1-0 win.

THE MVP

A rock at the back, Kenneth Omeruo was crucial in Nigeria holding onto their lead. Guinea-Bissau were hardly toothless compared to the Super Eagles but Omeruo pitched in with some strong tackles, was good in the air and his passing was spot on. He looked excellent alongside Calvin Bassey, who also impressed again.

THE BIG LOSER

He has had a disastrous time at this year's AFCON. After a big error gave away a goal in his side's opening defeat against hosts Ivory Coast, Opa Sangante was not involved against Equatorial Guinea but was brought back into the starting XI for the final group stage match against Nigeria. It could hardly have gone worse as it was he who blasted into his own net to give Nigeria the win.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Having finished second in Group A, Nigeria will progress to take on the runner up of Group C, which will either be Senegal, Guinea or Cameroon. Guinea-Bissau, meanwhile, crash out of the competition after finishing bottom of the table with zero points.
