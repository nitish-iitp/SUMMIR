Preview: Equatorial Guinea vs. Ivory Coast - prediction, team news, lineups

Africa Cup of Nations hosts Ivory Coast look to avoid another embarrassing defeat when they take on in-form Equatorial Guinea at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium on Monday.

The Elephants suffered a damaging 1-0 loss in their second Group A fixture against Nigeria to leave the home side in a precarious position before battling high-flying Nzalang Nacional, who secured a rip-roaring triumph over Guinea-Bissau in round two.

Nzalang Nacional have qualification from the group all but assured after an exciting 4-2 triumph over Guinea-Bissau in their second game at AFCON 2023.

Emilio Nsue was the story of the encounter, with the 34-year-old becoming the first player at the continental showpiece to find the back of the net three times in one game since Morocco's Soufiane Alloudi against Namibia in 2008.

With four points already secured from two games, Juan Micha's men need a point from Monday's clash to secure a spot in the first knockout round.

Having avoided defeat since losing 4-0 to Tunisia in qualifying, Equatorial Guinea should back themselves to extend their 13-game unbeaten run against the competition's hosts.

Micha already promised that his side would show the same hunger and desire from the Guinea-Bissau victory, and it is up to the Nzalang Nacional players to take up the challenge against the home side.

Apart from Jean-Louis Gasset's disappointment at Ivory Coast's defeat against the Super Eagles of Nigeria in the host nation's second game was the striking inability to find solutions to Jose Peseiro's tactical alteration.

The three-time African champions switched from a back four to a five-player defence, and the Elephants barely fashioned promising goalscoring chances in the 1-0 loss.

Ivory Coast's second half was further marred by their tendency to shoot from low-value positions when they could not break down the Super Eagles' organised rearguard, with Seko Fofana particularly guilty.

Gasset's men occupy third in Group A, currently enough to advance as one of the best third-placed sides in the competition, with Groups D, E and F yet to complete their second round of fixtures at the time of writing.

Losing to the Equatoguineans would be a disaster, and while a draw could see the Elephants progress in any capacity, it is not expected to appease a disappointed home support, who left Ebimpe in low spirits after Nigeria's win.

Current leading scorer Nsue is expected to captain the Equatoguineans as they seek another scalp at the continental showpiece.

Pablo Ganet was substituted in the triumph over Guinea-Bissau, possibly ruling out the midfield man against the host nation.

It remains to be seen if Sebastien Haller and Simon Adingra are healthy to play in Monday's final Group A encounter for Ivory Coast, having missed the Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria fixtures because of injury.

No player at AFCON 2023 has outdone Fofana's four shot-ending carries, but the midfield man must avoid speculative efforts if the game is not going the Elephants' way.

Former AC Milan man Franck Kessie has created a joint-high four chances so far and should be pivotal in possession for the home team.


Equatorial Guinea possible starting lineup:
Owono; Akapo, Obiang, Coco, Ndong; Eneme, Bikoro; Salvador, Machin, Miranda; Nsue

Ivory Coast possible starting lineup:
Fofana; Aurier, Diomande, Ndicka, Konan; Fofana, Sangare, Kessie; Pepe, Krasso, Boga



We say: Equatorial Guinea 1-1 Ivory Coast

Despite the undoubted home support, Equatorial Guinea could nick a point against an Ivorian side that went down in many observers' estimation after a disappointing defeat to Nigeria.
