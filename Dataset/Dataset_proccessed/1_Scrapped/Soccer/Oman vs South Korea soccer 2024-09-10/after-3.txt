In the end, it was Son Heung-min who saved Hong Myung-bo, who was in crisis and faced a stranded crisis.

Son Heung-min led South Korea to a 3-1 victory on the 10th (Korea time) by scoring a dramatic winning goal at the end of the second half in the second Group B match of the third Asian qualifying round for the 2026 North-China World Cup against Oman at the Sultan Qaboos Stadium in Muscat, Oman. South Korea, which led by Hwang Hee-chan's early first goal in the 10th minute of the first half, showed signs of anxiety from the middle of the first half and allowed the pursuit with Jung Seung-hyun's own goal in the 2nd minute of extra time. In the 37th minute of the second half, when he couldn't find a way out, Son Heung-min stepped up as the troubleshooter for the victory. Son Heung-min, who showed poor performance in the first preliminary match against Palestine at the Seoul World Cup Stadium on the 5th, presented Hong Myung-ho, who re-routed for the first time in 10 years with his 49th A-match goal. Son Heung-min assisted Hwang Hee-chan's first goal and Joo Min-kyu's net goal in the 10th minute of extra time in the second half, silencing Oman's soccer fans with one goal and two assists, literally 'Crazy Performance'.

The national team, which lost face with a scoreless draw against Palestine, ranked 96th in FIFA rankings, won its first win in the second match against Oman and wrapped up its A-match day schedule in September in a good mood. He rose to the top of the group with one win and one draw and four points. At the same time, they tied Jordan, who defeated Palestine 3-1 with four points and two goals on the difference between gains and losses. Jordan has one more goal in multiple goals. Immediately after taking office, A national team coach Hong Myung-bo, who was not supported by soccer fans due to controversy over fairness during the appointment process, was able to breathe a sigh of relief.

Coach Hong made drastic changes to replace five field players compared to the match against Palestine. Oh Se-hoon was put in place of Joo Min-kyu in the one-top position, and Hwang Hee-chan was put in place of Lee Jae-sung in the side midfielder position. Park Yong-woo instead of Jung Woo-young, Park Yong-woo instead of Jung Seung-hyun, and Lee Myung-jae instead of Hwang Moon-ki entered the ground.

The concept at the beginning of the first half was infinite switching of the second line of offense. Hwang Hee-chan Son Heung-min and Lee Kang-in went around without a fixed position. In particular, Hwang Hee-chan started the game on the left side, but before he knew it, he moved to the right side. Son Heung-min also went back and forth between the center and the left side. Yang Fullback and central midfielder Hwang In-beom also raised the line and built an aggressive lineup that was incomparable to the match against Palestine. The players' movements were lively, and the pass connection was fast.







Hwang Hee-chan 'I did it'

We got off to a good start. The first goal was scored in the 10th minute of the first half. Hwang Hee-chan, who received Son Heung-min's pass near the penalty arc, hit a right-footed mid-range shot aimed at the bottom left of the goal. Hwang Hee-chan, who played as a substitute in the second half against Palestine in the first round, proved his qualification as a starter with an early first goal. Son Heung-min and Hwang Hee-chan are a combination of scoring the final 16 goals in the 2022 Qatar World Cup match against Portugal.

South Korea knocked on the extra goal, keeping Oman out of the defense under strong pressure. In the 20th minute of a corner kick, Lee Myung-jae sent the ball from the opponent's goalkeeper out of the box back to the goal with a left-footed non-stop volley, but it was blocked by the goalkeeper. In the 25th minute, Jung Seung-hyun's shot in the box went straight to the goalkeeper.




South Korea's overwhelming game began to gradually change around the 30th minute of the first half. Midfielders and defenders repeated control and pass misses, and missed communication repeatedly gave the opponent a back-to-back opportunity. Ali al-Busaidi in the 31st minute and Jamil al-Yahmadi in the 36th minute knocked on the South Korean goal in a row, but the shooting accuracy was insufficient.

Concerns have become a reality. In the first minute of extra time, Seol Young-woo committed a foul with a deep tackle in the process of blocking Mohammad al-Mussalami's breakthrough in the dangerous area on the right side of the box in our camp. Seol was warned, and Oman got a free kick opportunity. And near the near post, Ahmed Al-Kamish allowed a run with a header. The center backs, who are close to 1m 90, were helplessly beaten by short Al-Kamish, who is 1m 74.

South Korea, which faced the second half of the game amid an unstable trend, received a penalty foul in the fifth minute. The opposing defender blocked Son Heung-min, who was handed a long ball by Lee Kang-in from the right, from the other side, from connecting the pass to his teammate. When Amjad Al-Harti, who took the ball away, dribbled out of the penalty box, Son Heung-min ran quickly and snatched the ball away. Shortly after that, Al Kharti's right knee touched Son Heung-min's left calf, and Son Heung-min fell. Referee Manning pointed his finger at the penalty point as it was. However, after more than two minutes of on-field review of the video reading system, he returned and reversed the decision.

In the 15th and 16th minutes of the second half, Lee Kang-in knocked on the goal with his signature left-footed shot, but failed to aim for zero. Oman handled South Korea roughly, with Al-Kamish and Nasser Al-Rawahi receiving back-to-back warnings. In the 21st minute of the second half, Oman tried to change by excluding Al-Kamish and putting Khalid al-Briki and Al-Rawahi. In the 23rd minute, South Korea also took out Oh Se-hoon and Seol Young-woo and put in Lee Jae-sung and Hwang Moon-ki to play the game.

In the 37th minute of the second half, when the 1-1 score continued, the long-awaited second goal was scored. Son Heung-min exchanged Lee Dae-il passes with Lee Kang-in. Son Heung-min, who took off his opponent's mark, shook the net with a powerful left-footed shot that stabbed the bottom left of the goal. Lee Kang-in's post-pressure and pass, Son Heung-min's calmness and accurate shooting created synergy. Coach Hong called in Lee Kang-in's Hwang Hee-chan and put in Joo Min-kyu's thumb-sung. The judges gave a somewhat incomprehensible '16 minutes of additional time'. Even considering the VAR reading time, it was too much time.

South Korea's Hwang In-beom's shot was blocked by the opponent's goalkeeper in a counterattack in the third minute of the second half. Joo Min-gyu's shot in the 5th minute was also caught on the goalkeeper's fingertips. In the 11th minute of extra time, Joo Min-kyu, who was assisted by Son Heung-min, scored a decisive goal. South Korea won 3-1 with Son Heung-min's one goal and two assists.
