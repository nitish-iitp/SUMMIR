Burkina Faso have never lost in the fixture before

Burkina Faso and Malawi lock horns at the Stade du 26 Mars in neutral Mali on Tuesday for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Both are aiming for their first win of the campaign after dropping points in their respective openers.

Ranked 67th in the world, the Stallions earned a point against the big guns Senegal with a stoppage-time equalizer. Ousseni Bouda scored in the 95th minute to cancel out Sadio Mane's early opener for the Lions of Teranga.

Brahima Traoré's side can be proud of their performance and could play the same XI here too as they aim for a three-pointer. On the other hand, the Flames went down 3-2 to Burundi despite an encouraging attacking display.

They fell behind twice in the game, only to equalize each time, but then Mokono Eldhino struck the third goal for the Swallows with only three minutes of normal time remaining.
