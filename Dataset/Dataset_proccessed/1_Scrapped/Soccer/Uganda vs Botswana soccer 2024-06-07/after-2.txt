Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT |  Muhammad Shaban’s second half goal gave the Uganda Cranes victory on their return to Mandela National Stadium on Friday.

The Zebras of Botswana held on to a goalless first half under floodlights in the third matchday of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, but were finally opened up in the second half.

Nine African teams will directly qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2026 if they top their groups during the qualifiers. The best four group runners-up will participate in play-offs to determine which team will advance to the inter-confederation play-offs where Africa will get another one slot.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
