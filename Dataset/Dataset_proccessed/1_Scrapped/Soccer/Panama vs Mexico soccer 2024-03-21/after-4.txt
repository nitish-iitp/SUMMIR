Gomez: Mexico picked Panama apart

Herculez Gomez believes that Mexico dispatched Panama easily by letting their opponents keep the ball and hitting them in transition.

First-half goals from Edson Álvarez and Julián Quiñones helped Mexico beat Panama 3-0 on Thursday, setting up a CONCACAF Nations League final clash with the United States.

Álvarez opened the scoring on 40 minutes when he beat his marker and slotted home, followed three minutes later by a Quiñones strike -- his first goal for Mexico.

Panama had a couple of chances in the second half. A shot by José Fajardo on 51 minutes that forced Ochoa into an impressive save, and Ochoa was made to maintain Mexico's two-goal lead again around the hour mark when José Luis Rodríguez took a powerful shot from outside the area.

Orbelín Pineda added a third goal on 66 minutes for Mexico, who now have the opportunity to settle score with the USMNT, having not beaten their rivals since 2019.

Led by Jaime Lozano, Mexico managed to win the Gold Cup last year, a tournament in which the United States sent an alternate team.

The final is scheduled to be held on Sunday.

Information from the Associated Press contributed to this report.
