Paramount+. Thousands of episodes, live TV & exclusive originals–all in one place. Try it free!

“Halo: The Series” on Paramount+ is a sci-fi drama based on the popular video game franchise. The series follows the adventures of Master Chief, a super soldier who fights against the alien Covenant. His team of Spartans, enhanced humans trained since childhood, assist him in his missions.

The series showcases key moments such as Master Chief’s encounter with Makee, a human prisoner of the Covenant who knows the location of a mysterious artifact. It also explores Master Chief’s bond with Cortana, an artificial intelligence who assists him in his missions, and his conflict with Dr. Halsey, the creator of the Spartan program who has a hidden agenda.

The series has received mixed reviews. While it has been praised for its storytelling and character development23, some critics have expressed concern about the lackluster action and the series’ attempts to recreate the look and style of the games23.
