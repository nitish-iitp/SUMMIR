GREAT FEAST—Hammers players during the luncheon

Mighty Mukuru Wanderers interim coach Meck Mwase has applauded players who were on the bench for turning around the team’s fortunes to return to winning ways.

Wanderers defeated Premier Bet Dedza Dynamos 3-1 at Kamuzu Stadium on Saturday to end their two-match winless run in the TNM Super League.

Christopher Kumwembe gave Wanderers an early lead after scoring in the third minute but Dynamos were rewarded for their positivity when Chifuniro Mpinganjira equalised in the 20th minute.

Wanderers then suffered a blow after Kumwembe limped off with an injury before being replaced by Vincent Nyangulu.

At the start of the second half, in a bid to win the match, Mwase introduced Isaac Kaliati and Felix Zulu for Wisdom Mpinganjira and Cameroonian debutant Sama Thierry Tanjong.

Substitute Isaac Kaliati showed his class when he restored Wanderers’ lead in the 51st minute before completing his brace in the 64th minute.

In a post-match interview, Mwase admitted that his charges were sluggish in the first half until the changes paid dividends.

“Indeed we struggled a bit in the first half and in the early minutes. We managed to score but they came back and equalised.

“In the second half, we brought fresh legs to add more fire power and we got those goals. Congratulations to the boys. They came in well and jelled with others and that is why we have won this match. We have to congratulate the boys because we were coming from two successive defeats,” Mwase said.

Dynamos Coach Andrew Bunya rued missed chances.

“We had a lot of chances which we did not convert. This is a problem which we are having. We got punished because we did not utilise our chances,” Bunya said.

Wanderers have 15 points from nine matches.
