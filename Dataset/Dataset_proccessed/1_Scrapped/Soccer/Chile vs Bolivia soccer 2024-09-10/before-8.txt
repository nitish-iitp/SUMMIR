Chile will attempt to end a four-game winless run when they play host to Bolivia in Tuesday's 2026 World Cup qualifier.

Meanwhile, the visitors will have the opportunity to claim a second straight victory after sweeping past Venezuela in their most recent outing.

Chile came into the current international period looking for a positive response after suffering a group-stage exit at the 2024 Copa America.

La Roja failed to score in any of their three group matches as they crashed out of the tournament with just two points to their name.

Unfortunately for Chile, their barren run continued in Thursday's away outing against world champions and Copa America winners Argentina.

Alexis Mac Allister, Julian Alvarez and Paulo Dybala all got on the scoresheet to condemn Chile to a 3-0 defeat and their third loss of Ricardo Gareca's tenure (W2, D2).

Having won one, drawn two and lost six of their seven qualifiers, La Roja will head into Tuesday's fixture in ninth position and three points adrift of the automatic qualification places.

Like their hosts, Bolivia also experienced a disappointing Copa America campaign, losing each of their three group games against the USA, Uruguay and Panama.

Bolivia sacked Antonio Carlos Zago following the group-stage exit and subsequently appointed Oscar Villegas as the new manager.

Villegas would have been pleased to begin his tenure with a comfortable 4-0 victory in Thursday's World Cup qualifier against Venezuela.

Ramiro Vaca, Carmelo Algaranaz, Miguelito and Enzo Monteiro all got on the scoresheet to help their country claim their second win of the qualifying campaign.

Having collected six points from seven qualifiers, Bolivia are sitting one point above Chile and two points adrift of the automatic qualification spots.

La Verde will turn their focus to Tuesday's fixture where they will attempt to end a five-game winless run in head-to-head matches against Chile (D2, L3).

Chile legend Alexis Sanchez has been ruled out of the current international period, while Diego Valdes and Bruno Barticciotto have both withdrawn from the squad due to injury.

Erick Pulgar missed the defeat to Argentina and remains a doubt for Tuesday's contest, while Marcelino Nunez is suspended due to an accumulation of yellow cards.

In positive news, Toulouse defender Gabriel Suazo is available for selection after serving a one-match ban for a red card that he received at Copa America.

As for Bolivia, they are unable to call upon forward Henry Vaca, who was forced off in the first half against Venezuela due to injury.

Defender Hector Cuellar and midfielder Ramiro Vaca are both set to serve one-match bans for yellow card accumulation.

Those three absentees could result in Jose Sagredo, Gabriel Villamil and Miguelito all being presented with starting opportunities.


Chile possible starting lineup:
Arias; Isla, Catalan, Diaz, Suazo; Osorio, Echeverria, Alarcon; Loyola, Davila, Vargas

Bolivia possible starting lineup:
Lampe, Sagredo, Haquin, Suarez; Medina, Matheus, Villamil, Fernandez; Miguelito, Chavez; Algaranaz



We say: Chile 2-0 Bolivia

Chile have won three of their previous five games against Bolivia, and we think that they will pick up another victory to extend their current unbeaten home run to four World Cup qualifying matches.
