BETTING TIPS AND MATCH INSIGHTS

When considering the Chile vs Bolivia prediction today, several key factors must be taken into account. Both teams have struggled during the current qualification campaign but are now in urgent need of points. Chile has the home advantage, and while Bolivia has shown flashes of brilliance, Chile’s record in head-to-head matches gives them a psychological edge.

Chile Results

Chile has experienced a difficult run of form recently, as shown in their latest results across different competitions. The team is under pressure to perform and end their current winless streak in World Cup qualifying matches. Below is a summary of their recent fixtures:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
06.09.24	WC	Argentina vs Chile	3-0	L
30.06.24	CA	Canada vs Chile	0-0	D
26.06.24	CA	Chile vs Argentina	0-1	L
22.06.24	CA	Peru vs Chile	0-0	D
12.06.24	FI	Chile vs Paraguay	3-0	W

Chile has managed only one win in their last five matches, which came in a friendly against Paraguay. Their World Cup qualification campaign has been challenging, with a heavy 3-0 loss to Argentina in their most recent outing. Their struggles to score have been a major issue, with only one goal in their last four matches. However, Chile remains competitive at home and will aim to turn things around.

Bolivia Results

Bolivia enters this match on the back of mixed form, but their recent victory over Venezuela has given them a boost. Below are the details of Bolivia’s last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
05.09.24	WC	Bolivia vs Venezuela	4-0	W
02.07.24	CA	Bolivia vs Panama	1-3	L
28.06.24	CA	Uruguay vs Bolivia	5-0	L
23.06.24	CA	USA vs Bolivia	2-0	L
15.06.24	FI	Colombia vs Bolivia	3-0	L

Bolivia’s recent form has been inconsistent, with four losses and one win in their last five matches. Their emphatic 4-0 victory over Venezuela in their last World Cup qualifier, however, shows they are capable of turning up on the day. Defensive issues have been a concern, as they conceded multiple goals in four matches before their recent win.

Chile vs Bolivia Head-to-Head Results

The historical meetings between Chile and Bolivia indicate a competitive but favorable matchup for the hosts. Below are the last five matches between these two teams:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
21.06.23	FI	Bolivia vs Chile	0-0
01.02.22	WC	Bolivia vs Chile	2-3
18.06.21	CA	Chile vs Bolivia	1-0
09.06.21	WC	Chile vs Bolivia	1-1
27.03.21	FI	Chile vs Bolivia	2-1

Chile has had the upper hand in recent head-to-head encounters, securing two wins and two draws in the last five meetings. Bolivia has found it difficult to overcome Chile, particularly in Santiago, where Chile tends to dominate. Bolivia’s last win over Chile came at home, and they have struggled to replicate that success on the road.
