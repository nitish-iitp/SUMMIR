Our Principles

When used thoughtfully and responsibly, we believe Generative AI holds immense promise for improving customer experiences. To guide us, we have developed a set of principles that describe how we use — and do not use — Generative AI.

Put People at the Centre

We consider humans integral to the use of Generative AI. We primarily use AI to serve people and build human oversight and control into how AI systems work

Stay in Compliance

We're committed to ensuring our use of Generative AI aligns with our contractual agreements and remains within agreed-upon terms and conditions.

Amplify Human Creativity

We use Generative AI to complement and extend human imagination and ingenuity, not replace it.

Be Responsible, Ethical, and Unbiased

We avoid using Generative AI in any way that could perpetuate discrimination, inequality, or harm to people.

Experiment and Validate Before Use

We embrace new Generative AI models as they arrive, but we first test them and learn what they are good at — and what they aren’t — before we use them.

Build for Security and Transparency

We make data privacy and protection a priority when using Generative AI. We work to ensure the role of AI is clearly communicated to those with whom we work and to the customers who use what we build.

How We Engage
AI Accelerator Workshops

A facilitated session to uncover where Generative AI could bring value to your business.

AI Architecture + Development Assessment

An in-depth identification of the optimal architecture, AI models, prompts and refinement required to develop a Generative AI solution.

AI PODs

AI Annotation + Data Labeling

Empower AI teams with high-quality training data to solve data-set challenges.

Despite not knowing a lot about American Football and especially cheerleading and youth at that, ISHIR Team quickly picked up what we were about and what we needed. They were never shy about asking questions before spending time and money to do something so that it was right and done in a timely manner.
EVP

Texas Youth Football & Cheerleading Association

What, to us, might be a complicated issue was proven to be simple for ISHIR. They made swift progress on any task we submitted to them. There were very few times that the issue was complicated enough that it required numerous iterations and only twice did we need to actually speak to someone.
