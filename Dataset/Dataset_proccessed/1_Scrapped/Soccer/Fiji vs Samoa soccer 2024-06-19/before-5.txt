So am currently brainstorming if I can make a multi caliber rifle out of a Terminus Zeus QC LA. The calibers I intend to run are 300 PRC, 7 PRC, 6.5 creedmoor. This will be running out of a AX AICS chassis or Foundation Stock, I know that there is no issue with the PRC cartridges besides barrel changes so it comes down to the 6.5 creedmoor. As of now magazines that will feed reliably are the main concern as am sure Terminus has .308 LA bolts. I know theres AXSR magazines that are designed to feed 6.5 CM but I believe those are double stack and the magazines on the AX chassis and Foundation are single stack.

Are there single stack magazines out there that will feed 6.5 CM reliably on a LA? maybe inserts?

Are there other issues I should be worried about?

Does this make any sense? can it be done?

Did you try to call Terminus and ask them? That or your gunsmith. I'm not sure I'd try this as a lego-build.

No issues. I forget which sniper branch used to do so but .308 in long actions is old news.

Right. It makes sense that it could be done like I said magazine comparability was the real issue. Just checked with Terminus and they do make a LA .308 bolt.

You might ask to make sure 300/7 PRC are cool on the QC. Sounds like they are, but I asked on 300NM and got this response: “…We recommend the FT option for the NM and Lapua based cartridges…”

Good info. I already have a 7 PRC QC barrel so am hoping it won’t be an issue, I don’t think it would be since it’s a off the shelf proof pre-fit and I would think they’d do their research.

James Eagleman from Barbour Creek Outfitters has a few videos of using the Zeus QC Long Action for both and doing a barrel swap.

I think the key was the mags.

Hope this helps.

Holler at the MKM boys in this thread, they are working on a better solution for this!

Long Action Magazine Interchangeability
@lash and @Tyler Kemp I figured we could start a new thread to kick ideas around instead of polluting @Terry Cross’s thread haha. So, the objective is to allow someone to go from shooting 308 Win to 338 Lapua with the change of a barrel, bolt and magazine. Extra points if it’s possible to step...
 www.snipershide.com
@Tyler Kemp



I run a 6 CM (Proof CF), 6.5 CM, 308 Win, 300 Win and 300 NM through my Zeus LA QC using the mags already mentioned. Trying to stay strong and not add a 6.5 PRC or 25 CM to the mix!

If you’re going to run a clip on and need the maximum versatility in an optic, I’ve enjoyed the MK8 3.5-25 TMR (easy to see at min power, great glass, good tracking, lightweight, better FOV than the MK5 3.6-18)

6.5 prc I don’t see a gain for you but I think you definitely need a 25 creed I run a 6 creed and 6.5 prc in my sa zues qc I like to go fast

If I did a 6.5 PRC it would be a ~20” to shoot the 100 ELD VT’s as close to 3500fps as I could!

ETA: hard to get away from factory 6 CM slinging the 80 ELD VT’s at 3150fps and very accurate (good enough for 300 yds at midnight anyway)

I believe so, they have a sort of spacer in the back of the mag that keep the SA cartridges towards the front of the magazine. I’m on the road the next couple weeks or I’d take a pic. The mags I’m using came with the actions / barrels when I bought it

It would be cool if they are. Or they come out with a Gen 2 that is. A cheaper option for QC compared to the MRAD and AXSR.

I want to build a magnum again eventually. The Zeus has been on my radar

Currently waiting on Terminus/proof regarding headspace compatibility between LA/SA pre fits. I would imagine it’s the same tenon dimensions?

Well at this point this project has hit a brick wall. Still waiting to hear any news of my Zeus we are on week 16 originally quoted 7. I got everything else. It’s a shame because I really want the QC feature.

Any LA recommendations I should be looking at as a substitute?

Ok so after a 21 week wait it seems like it’s finally at its end. I been told that the action should be shipping from terminus today.

Also I email Joel and he says that all proof prefit barrels are I interchangeable between LA and SA and there should not be any issues feeding .308 SA based carriages using the accurate mag magazine recommended above.

This might happen guys. I’ll keep you posted everything is in place.

A little off topic, but I have a Zeus QC and was thinking of buying an extra bolt with Lapua bolt face for a future 300NM barrel, that’s not recommended by Terminus?

Keith at PCR was sketchy about the short amount of threads on the tenon when he chambered my 300WM.

@rlsmith1 any concerns with your 300NM in QC option?

Unsure what’s the caliber cut off, if contact Joe. I’d be interested on his answers as I plan to move to 300 PRC in the future.

I've not had issues but also have shot about 50 rounds through the Norma barrel. From what I've read, the 300NM shouldn't be an issue.

For rifles in general, I'd be more concerned about hanging a suppressor off a heavy contour 26" barrel of any caliber but people have been doing that for a long time with no issues.

I've been thinking about doing this very thing but with a bighorn origin. Been looking at the zeus as well. Can't wait to see how the short action cartridges perform. I don't think you'll have any issues.

So is there a mag solution that lets you get more than 5rd in either LA or SA are you stuck with 5rd LA CIP type mags and Accurate’s 5rd LA footprint SA mags? To me that’s always been the LIMFAC.

So is there a mag solution that lets you get more than 5rd in either LA or SA are you stuck with 5rd LA CIP type mags and Accurate’s 5rd LA footprint SA mags? To me that’s always been the LIMFAC.
Unsure. I purchased a .308 single stack LA CIO magazine to try out. I did see anything other than 5 rounds tho. We’ll see if it works.

UPDATE.

this project got side tracked for some time but it’s back on.

I have confirmed reliable feeding with the accurate mag .308 long action magazine. At this time am waiting on the .308 bolt from Terminus to confirm headspace and extraction which I suspect should be fine.

I had also reached out to Hawkins regarding their hunter magazine system. They confirmed that a 30.06 magazine with one of their spacers could be used to run .308 based cartridges out of a LA. That would have been my back up plan.
