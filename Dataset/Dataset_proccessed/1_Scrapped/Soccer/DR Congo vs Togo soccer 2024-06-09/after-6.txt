Congo DR play host to Togo in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Sunday

Congo DR play host to Togo at the Stade des Martyrs in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Sunday. Paulo Duarte’s men have failed to win their opening game in Group B and will head into the weekend looking to end this poor run.

Congo DR failed to return to winning ways in the qualifiers as they played out a 1-1 draw with Senegal at the Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade on Thursday.

Before that, Sebastien Desabre’s side kicked off their quest for a place in the World Cup with a 2-0 win over Mauritania on November 15, four days before suffering a 1-0 loss against Sudan.

Congo will be backing themselves to bounce back this weekend as they take on an opposing side who have managed just one win in their last 12 meetings since January 1965.

Elsewhere, Togo were denied their first win in the World Cup qualifiers as they were held to a 1-1 draw by South Sudan on Wednesday.

Duarte’s men had kicked off their campaign with a 1-1 stalemate against Sudan on November 16, five days before playing out a goalless draw with Senegal on home turf.

With three points from three matches, Togo are fourth in Group B, one point and one place behind Sunday’s hosts.

Congo DR vs Togo Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
Congo DR have been imperious in the history of this fixture, having won 10 of the last 12 meetings between the two nations.
Togo have managed just one win in that time, which came in September 2013, when they beat Desabre’s men 2-1 in the World Cup qualifiers, while the spoils have been shared once.
Congo DR have won all but one of their last five home games, with a 2-1 defeat against Burkina Faso on January 10 being the exception.
Togo are unbeaten in nine of their last 10 matches across all competitions, claiming four wins and five draws since March 2023.
Congo DR vs Togo Prediction

With just one point separating the two nations in the table, we expect a thrilling contest at the Stade des Martyrs as both sides look to get one over the other.

Congo DR boast a superior and more experienced squad and we are tipping them to come out on top in front of their home supporters.

Prediction: Congo DR 3-0 Togo
