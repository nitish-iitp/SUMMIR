Namibia and Tunisia played to a goalless draw in their fourth match of the CAF 2026 World Cup qualifiers at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg on Sunday evening.

The Brave Warriors went into the match with high hopes of replicating their iconic 2023 Africa Cup of Nations win against the Carthage Eagles, however it was not to be as neither team could find the breakthrough to get onto the scoresheet.

Bethuel Muzeu was a standout player in the fixture, as he proved problematic for the Tunisian defence. T

The Southern African team were close to getting the breakthrough early in the first half, however the goal was disallowed.

Nonetheless, Namibia remain second in the Group H standings and Tunisia still hold first place for the time being.

In other matches, São Tomé and Principe lost 1-0 to Liberia in the same group and remained at the bottom of the table following their fourth defeat in a row.

Liberia are third in the standings.

Other results on the day saw Djibouti play out to a 1-1 draw against Ethiopia in Group A. The Democratic Republic of Congo won 1-0 against Togo, and Senegal picked up the same result against Mauritania.

RESULTS

São Tomé and Príncipe 0-1 Liberia

Djibouti 1-1 Ethiopia

DR Congo 1-0 Togo

Mauritania 0-1 Senegal

Namibia 0-0 Tunisia
