Chile take on Paraguay this week

International football is back in action with another set of matches this week as Paraguay lock horns with South American rivals Chile in an intriguing encounter at the Estadio Nacional Julio Martinez Pradanos on Wednesday. Both teams can pack a punch on their day and will want to win this game.

Chile are in eighth place in the World Cup qualification standings and have not been at their best in recent weeks. La Roja slumped to a narrow 3-2 defeat at the hands of France in their previous game and will need to bounce back this week.

Paraguay, on the other hand, are in seventh place in the qualification table and have been inconsistent in recent months. The Paraguayan side played out a 0-0 stalemate against Peru last week and will aim to take it up a notch in this fixture.
