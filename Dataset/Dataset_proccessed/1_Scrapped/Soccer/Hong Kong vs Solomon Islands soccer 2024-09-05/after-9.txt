Solomon Islands face Hong Kong on Thursday

Solomon Islands and Hong Kong will trade tackles in an international friendly on Thursday. Solomon Islands are coming into the game on the back of a 1-0 defeat to Fiji in a friendly on Monday.

Tevita Waranaivalu broke the deadlock in the 81st minute and his strike proved to be the difference between the two sides.

Hong Kong, meanwhile, shared the spoils in a goalless draw away to Turkmenistan in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier in June. The Dragons have another friendly lined up against Fiji in this international window.

Solomon Islands will use this game to continue preparations for their return to action in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers next month.

Solomon Islands vs Hong Kong Prediction

Solomon Islands have marquee FIFA World Cup qualification games coming up in October and the Bonitos will use this game to finalize preparations for Fiji's visit next month. They have not found the back of the net in any of their last four games, losing all four matches.

Hong Kong, for their part, were knocked out in the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, finishing bottom of Group E with just two points from six games. They are winless in their last five games and do not have any competitive game slated for the rest of the year.

This game represents a perfect opportunity for either side to register a much-needed win as they are unlikely to do so against tougher opposition. We are backing the spoils to be shared in a low-scoring stalemate.

Prediction: Solomon Islands 0-0 Hong Kong
