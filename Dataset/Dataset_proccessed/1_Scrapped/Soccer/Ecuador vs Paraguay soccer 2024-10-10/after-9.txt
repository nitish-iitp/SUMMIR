 Louis Smith  3  October 10, 2024

By Louis Smith.

The 2026 World Cup Qualifiers summarized and in South America they’re approaching the halfway stage with the table beginning to shape up nicely. Teams are fighting for crucial points as the competition intensifies, and the battle for qualification spots becomes more competitive.

Argentina

Captain Lionel Messi, returns to International duty for the first time since his injury during the 2024 Copa America final.

The squad includes two uncapped players in Julio Soler and Nico Paz.

Emiliano Martinez does not feature in the squad due to a two-game suspension.

La Albiceleste extended their unbeaten run to 12 matches last month with a 3-0 victory over Chile, before suffering a 2-1 loss away from home against Colombia.

Argentina remain top of the standings.

Argentina Squad

Goalkeepers:
Geronimo Rulli, Juan Musso, Walter Benitez

Defenders:
Nicolas Otamendi, Nicolas Tagliafico, Nahuel Molina, German Pezzella, Cristian Romero, Gonzalo Montiel, Lisandro Martinez, Leonardo Balerdi, Julio Soler

Bolivia

Óscar Villegas’s start to managing the Bolivian National Team got off to a flyer as he enjoyed a 4-0 mauling of Venezuela at home and a 2-1 win against Chile on the road. The win was Boliva’s first away from home in World Cup Qualification in 31 years.

His latest squad sees four potential debutants in Bruno Poveda, Alejandro Torres and Jhon Velásquez.

Only seven members of the side ply their trade outside of Bolivia.

Bolivia has moved up to eighth in the standings and will be eager for a repeat of what happened last month.

Brazil

Brazil have lost four of their last five Qualifiers, increasing the pressure on manager, Dorival Júnior.

Back in September, they earned a 1-0 win over Ecuador in a less-than-pleasing display, before suffering a 1-0 loss to Paraguay in Asuncion. It’s safe to say Seleção need to raise their game.

Alisson misses out after picking up a hamstring injury in Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Six Brasileirao-based players have been called up, including a potential debutant in Botafogo’s Igor Jesus.

Abner Vinicius who won Olympic gold with Brazil in 2021 is another uncapped player called up to the side.

Brazil Squad

Goalkeepers:
Ederson, Weverton, Bento

Defenders:
Marquinhos, Danilo, Alex Telles, Gabriel Magalhães, Lucas Beraldo, Fabrício Bruno, Vanderson, Abner

Midfielders:

Forwards:
Rodrygo, Raphinha, Gabriel Martinelli, Endrick, Savinho, Luiz Henrique, Igor Jesus

Chile

After a terrible time in September which saw them lose to Argentina away and Bolivia home, Chile has called up seven uncapped players as they hope for a huge improvement.

They currently sit ninth in the standings, Chile have not won any of their last six matches in all competitions.

The experienced duo Mauricio Isla and Eugenio Mena are not included in the squad, Ben Brereton Díaz also misses out.

The squad features nine domestic-based players, two more than last month.

Colombia’s unbeaten run in the Qualifiers continued last time out as they drew 1-1 on the road against Peru, before beating World Champions Argentina in a 2-1 victory in Barranquilla.

There are two potential debutants in the squad; Kevin Mier and Midfielder Nelson Deossa.

Álvaro Montero and Andrés Román are the only domestic-based players in the 29-man squad.

Ecuador

Despite a decent display in Brazil Ecuador suffered a 1-0 loss but managed to end September on a high as they ran out 1-0 winners against Peru, lifting them to fourth in the standings.

Gonzalo Valle could earn his first cap here as could Hull City’s Óscar Zambrano who has made a solid start to life in England.

Darwin Núñez can return to the side after he had his ban lifted following the Copa America riots.

Marcelo Bielsa’s squad features three potential debutants Agustín Sant’Anna, Tiago Palacios and Miguel Merentiel.

Like last time, La Vinotinto has called up a huge squad, due to having a training camp for the youth sides at the same time to be integrated.

The only domestic-based player to be called up is Deportivo Táchira’s Carlos Vivas.
