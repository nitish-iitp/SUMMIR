History
Asian World Cup qualifying resumed this week, with Japan beating Myanmar 6-1 and Syria 1-0, while North Korea beat Myanmar 6-1 after losing to Syria 1-0. The two countries face each other in Tokyo today in the first of two matches, with the return leg in Pyongyang on Tuesday. While Japan is the favourite to qualify for the World Cup, the matches are likely to be more contentious than other games in the qualifiers, as the countries have a fraught geopolitical relationship, with Japan having been the colonial power in Korea. In addition, North Korea has recently cancelled plans to host the matches in Pyongyang, due to concerns over "a malignant infectious disease" in Japan, apparently referring to a rise in streptococcus infections.
