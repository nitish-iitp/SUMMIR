We said: Japan 3-0 North Korea
North Korea will be motivated to upset the odds here, aware of how all but a few people will expect this group to be a foregone conclusion for Japan. We expect it to be just that for this game, too, with Japan cruising to the three points and another clean sheet. Read more.
