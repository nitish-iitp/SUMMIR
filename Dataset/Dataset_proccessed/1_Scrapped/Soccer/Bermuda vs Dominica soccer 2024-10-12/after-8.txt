Dominica’s Senior Men’s National Football team is gearing up for their crucial matches against Bermuda in the Concacaf Nations League. Head coach Ellington Sabin expressed confidence in his team’s readiness as they prepare for the first of two matches, scheduled for Saturday, October 12, and Tuesday, October 15, in Bermuda.

Dominica currently holds third place in their group, and the team is eager to seize this opportunity to advance in the league. Coach Sabin praised the players’ sharpness and determination during practice, noting the importance of blending local talent with overseas players. “The practices went well, and the guys look sharp and determined to take on the opponent,” Sabin remarked. “It’s now time for the players to execute what they practiced.”

Acknowledging the cold conditions in Bermuda, Sabin mentioned that the management staff has taken steps to ensure players are prepared to perform at their best despite the weather. He expressed satisfaction with the team’s physical condition, highlighting that there are currently no injuries.

Calling for continued support from the Dominican public, Sabin urged fans to keep faith in the team. “We always aim to do our best, and though things don’t always go as planned, your support means everything to us,” he said.

Dominica’s starting lineup for the first match includes Glenson Prince as captain and goalkeeper, along with key players such as Rufferson Pierre-Louis, Eustace Marshall, and Travist Joseph. The game kicks off at 7:30 pm Bermuda time (6:30 pm Caribbean time).

Chad Bertrand, who received two yellow cards, will sit out the first game but will be eligible to play in the second. Dominica remains focused and ready to deliver their best performance on the field.
