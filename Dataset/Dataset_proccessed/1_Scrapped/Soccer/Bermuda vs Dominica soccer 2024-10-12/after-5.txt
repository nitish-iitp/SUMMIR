Triumphant Leadership and Team Spirit: Bermuda’s Gombey Warriors Secure Back-to-Back Victories
16 October, 2024

Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Sport, the Hon. Owen Darrell, celebrated Bermuda’s outstanding achievements as hosts of the Concacaf Nations League, where the Gombey Warriors demonstrated exceptional skill, sportsmanship, and unity over the past few days.

In their first match on Saturday, October 12, 2024, Bermuda defeated Dominica with an impressive 6-1 victory, fueled by the dynamic return of Nahki Wells, whose first-half hat-trick energized the home crowd and set a strong example for the team.

In their second match last night, Bermuda secured another win over Dominica, finishing 3-2. With teamwork and resilience, the players came together to achieve a hard-fought victory exemplifying the spirit and determination of Bermuda football.

Minister Darrell said, “We are incredibly proud of Bermuda’s Gombey Warriors. Saturday’s match set a high standard of leadership and inspiration, especially for our young fans. Last night’s win further reflects the team’s dedication and unity. Congratulations to the Bermuda Football Association (BFA) for successfully hosting the Concacaf Nations League. With strong leadership guiding our young players and a team driven to excel, the future of Bermuda football is bright.”
