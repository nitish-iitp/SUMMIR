Tridents widen lead in Concacaf Nations League with victory

Barbados won heir second successive match of Group A in League C of the Concacaf Nations League; 3-0 over USVI.

Renaldo GilkesSeptember 11, 2024 05:38 PM ET

The Barbados senior men’s football team completed round one of the Concacaf Nations League on top of Group A of League C, with their second successive victory.

Yesterday evening the Tridents blanked the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) 3-0 at the Bethlehem Soccer Stadium in St Croix.

The result means the Tridents have a perfect record of two victories in two matches, after their last Saturday success versus the Bahamas.

Tridents and USVI do battle this evening in CNL

September 10, 2024 12:38 PM ET

Barbados made some changes to their starting roster, which saw the inclusion of Shay Prescod, Ethan Taylor, Kevon Lucas and Niall Reid-Stephen.

Reid-Stephen was a handful for the USVI defenders.  His strength, technical ability and mobility made him too hot  to handle.

After threatening the Islanders goal on a couple of occasions, the Tridents went ahead in the 15th minute.

Niall Reid-Stephen was in sublime form yesterday versus the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), scoring one of three goals that helped the Tridents to a 3-0 victory.

A corner by Barbados was partially cleared, and the ball fell favorably to roving right back Carl Hinkson who shot the ball low and powerfully into the bottom  right corner.

Reid-Stephen came close to doubling the Tridents’ lead in the 49th minute, but his free-kick from 30 yards was parried away by USVI goalkeeper Gabriel Catone-Highfield.

Barbados would double their lead in the 86th minute. 

Substitute Sheran Hoyte played an inch-perfect pass into the path of Reid-Stephen who held off his marker to blast an unstoppable shot beyond the right hand of Catone-Highfield, from the edge of the penalty area.

Khalil Vanderpool-Nurse would come off the bench to convert his debut international goal at the senior level in the 93rd minute.

The result saw Barbados earn their first clean sheet after 25 games, with the last one being achieved in 2021 versus Anguilla (1-0)

Barbados will complete their Nations League campaign next month on October 11th versus the USVI and October 14th against the Bahamas.
