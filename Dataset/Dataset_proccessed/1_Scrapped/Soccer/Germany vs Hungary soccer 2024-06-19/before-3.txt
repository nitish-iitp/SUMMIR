Reminder that politics and football do mix.

The French far-right leader Jordan Bardella has criticised the footballer Kylian Mbappé over his call for young people to vote against the “extremes” in parliamentary elections this month.

“I have a lot of respect for our footballers, whether Marcus Thuram or Kylian Mbappé, who are icons of football and icons for youth … But we must respect the French, we must respect everyone’s vote,” Bardella told CNews TV on Tuesday.

“When you’re lucky enough to have a very, very big salary, when you are a multimillionaire … then I’m a little embarrassed to see these athletes … give lessons to people who can no longer make ends meet, who no longer feel safe, who do not have the chance to live in neighbourhoods overprotected by security agents.”

Belgians refuse to blame sweaty shirts for Slovak shock
Paul MacInnes

Why did it look like the Belgium team were running their own wet T-shirt competition during their Group E match against Slovakia on Monday? While the Slovaks, dressed in all white, looked fresh as daisies, KDB and co looked as if they had sweated out their body weight trying to keep up.

A succession of sticky images raised the prospect of Belgium having done an Aston Villa, where the men’s and women’s teams asked the supplier Castore to provide a new kit for the second half of last season because the original version absorbed so much perspiration it began to weigh players down.

Not the case, says Adidas, which has designed the kit that the Belgium men’s team have been wearing since March (as well as the shirts of Spain, Italy and of course Germany). The problem, rather, was an excess of humidity. “Our jerseys are built with breathable materials and HEAT.RDY technology to maximise air flow – however moisture was visible given the humidity in yesterday’s match,” a spokesperson said. “We constantly gather player feedback, also after yesterday’s game, and as a result both adidas and the RBFA [Royal Belgian Football Association] are confident in the performance of our RBFA kit.’

We checked with the RBFA and it confirmed there had been no complaints from the players, so look forward to more wet Belgians when they play Romania on Saturday.

Sir Keir Starmer says a new Labour government will look into kick-off times and ticket pricing. He’s been chatting to something called Football Weekly.

However, Starmer dismissed suggestions that the package of football regulations could include a proposal to levy a 10% charge on transfers that would then be distributed to lower league clubs.

Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow sports and culture secretary, suggested on Monday she would be open to such an idea, saying: “I’m going to look at absolutely everything that might help increase the financial sustainability.”

But Starmer told an LBC radio phone-in on Tuesday: “Let me just kill that one. We’re not looking at that … We will get that football governance bill in. It’s much needed for fans, but that isn’t part of it.”

West Ham are the latest club to raise prices and cut concession tickets. Their fans are enraged.

There’s a question on Stockport from L’Equipe’s reporter. The motto there these days is “Stockport, it’s not s**t”, and Kobbie relates that he, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer have been kicking back and reminding themselves of youth teams back in the day, their back in the day being as far back as 2014. Are Mellor Boys still going?

Fuller transcript will follow.

“I’m ready to play, whether that’s off the bench or starting. Obviously, there’s other great midfielders in the squad in the Premier League or abroad like Jude [Bellingham]. I’m trying to train hard and be ready when I’m called upon.”

On playing against Danish teammates: “They’re both great team-mates to me, Rasmus is young like me so I am always around him. I am trying to learn and pick up from Christian. If I’m to play on Thursday I’ll have to put that aside.”

“It’s such a good squad, we’ve gelled real well.”

It’s not been a great advert for German logistics, this tournament. Or weather, which reminds of that grainy footage of the 1974 World Cup, which looks like it was played in Ireland in mid-March. The fan parks, as first shown off at the 2006 World Cups, have had their problems, too.

Per Reuters – Berlin’s two Euro 2024 fan zones, which attract tens of thousands of guests for public viewing of matches, will be closed on Tuesday due to an extreme weather warning.

Germany’s weather service has forecast heavy rain, thunderstorms and hail for the wider area around the capital later in the day. There are no matches in Berlin on Tuesday but fans would have gathered at the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag areas to watch Georgia take on Turkey in Dortmund before the evening game in Leipzig between Portugal and the Czech Republic.

“Safety of the visitors is the top priority,” said Moritz van Duelmen, of organisers Kulturprojekt Berlin. The fan zones are expected to re-open on Wednesday.

“Re tongue-swallowing,” begins Stephen Halliday, “I actually watched something very recently that informed me that it’s impossible to swallow one’s own tongue. This was news to me as it’s always slightly scared me that this could happen and what if it happened and nobody knew what to do. Anyway, can’t remember where I saw that but see it I did! Doesn’t take anything away from quick-thinking players over the years who have come to the rescue of a colleague who may have, or probably hadn’t, swallowed their own tongue.”

I guess they called it swallowing one’s tongue but what it actually was the tongue blocking an airway. Bryan Robson, though, who did it – or didn’t do it – against QPR in January 1989, is still nails.

“Euro ‘88 is the first major tournament I can remember watching,” writes Kári Tulinius. “I really liked that Soviet side, and Rinat ‘The Cat’ Dasayev became my hero, as I wanted to play in goal. One of the main reasons Marco van Basten’s strike was so special is that he beat one of football’s greatest ever goalkeepers.

Mine is Mexico 86 but I was still fully amped-up with wonder for Euro 88. I liked Dasaev too, but the definitive Euros keeping performance is Peter Schmeichel in 1992 – without him – and, in fairness, Brian Laudrup and Flemming Polvsen – no chance Denmark win that.

“My actual favourite bit of the Savage announcement,” returns James Humphries, “is Heskey being brought in for a ‘position-specific role’. I assume that means he’s gonna knock the team talks down for Owen or Vassell?”

He’s going to coach the strikers who don’t score to get even better at it.

The statement here is sensational.

Robbie Savage takes head coach job at Macclesfield, the club he part-owns
Read more

Macclesfield FC can confirm that Robbie Savage has been appointed first-team head coach with immediate effect. As a result of achieving two promotions as well as reaching a play-off final and Isuzu FA Trophy semi-final within the club’s first three years, it came as no surprise when Robbie was offered a senior role elsewhere recently.

Robbie subsequently agonised over this on numerous levels as it would have meant him relinquishing his role at Macclesfield FC – in addition to his shareholding. This was something which the board was not prepared to let happen and it was unanimously decided that Robbie should be given the chance to prove himself here at Macclesfield FC as he launches his coaching career with us.

How many levels constitute “numerous”? We must be told.

I’m looking forward to seeing Turkey this afternoon – most particularly to watch this lad but also because Vincenzo Montella has got them playing exciting, enterprising football. Kenan Yildiz is another with huge potential, who’s also pretty nifty now, and if they find their tempo, Georgia are in trouble.
