Souček scores as Czech Republic qualify for UEFA Euro 2024
20TH NOVEMBER 2023

Tomáš Souček both captained and scored for the Czech Republic as a 3-0 win over Moldova confirmed their place at the 2024 UEFA European Championship.

Souček and his international teammates headed into Monday evening's home clash with Moldova at the Andrův Stadion in Olomouc knowing a point would be enough to send them through to their eighth consecutive UEFA European Championship finals. 

The West Ham United midfielder once again captained the national side on the international stage and it would only take 14 minutes for the hosts to take the lead, as David Douděra netted on the counter-attack.

Things were made even more difficult for Moldova when they were reduced to ten men early in the second half. Defender Vladyslav Babohlo was given his marching orders for a second yellow card.

Tomáš Choré achieved a dream on his debut for the Czech Republic national team. The forward scored his side's second - and his first international goal - to put the team in full control of the match heading into the closing exchanges.

 

Captain Souček wrapped up a perfect evening for the Czech Republic with just a minute to play in Olomouc. The 28-year-old coolly slotted home from just inside the penalty area following a well-worked corner routine, securing the win and his team's place at next summer's finals in Germany.

The win means the Czech Republic's qualifying campaign concludes with four wins and three draws from eight matches played, earning them 15 points and assuring them a spot in the top two of Group E; meaning a place among the 24 teams at the 2024 UEFA European Championship.

The team only finished behind group winners Albania on goal difference, who had drawn 0-0 with the Faroe Islands in their final Group E fixture. 

Souček was the only Hammer in action on Monday evening. Young striker Callum Marshall was named among the substitutes for Northern Ireland in their final Group H qualification match, with the side securing an impressive 2-0 win over group leaders Denmark. 

The three points mean Northern Ireland end their qualifying campaign on nine points, which is not enough to reach the 2024 final.
