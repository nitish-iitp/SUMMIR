Pick of the day: Celebrity Gogglebox

10.10pm, Channel 4

Opinions differ on the wisdom of including celebrities in every successful (and not-so-successful) reality TV format, but it works quite well with Gogglebox, with the famous faces delivering just as much wit and quirkiness as the regular everyday TV fanatics. Among those giving their real-time reaction to recent TV programmes are Jennifer Saunders and daughter Beattie Edmondson, Danny Dyer and his daughter Dani, Rylan Clark and his mum Linda, Babatunde Aléshé and Mo Gilligan, Happy Mondays legends Shaun Ryder and Bez, Clare Balding and wife Alice Arnold, and Stephen Mangan with his sister Anita. It’s easy, stressless viewing.

Live England International Football

7pm, Channel 4

England vs Iceland (Kick-off 7.45pm). Jules Breach presents coverage of the friendly from Wembley Stadium, as the Three Lions fine-tune their preparations for Euro 2024 against a team that knocked them out of Euro 2016 (but which failed to qualify this time). Their opening match against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen is in just nine days’ time. Scotland’s friendly against Finland at Hampden Park can be seen on BBC Three at 7.30pm.

Gardeners’ World

8pm, BBC Two

Monty Don reveals plans for planting up pots in his Cottage Garden, shares tips on how to start a topiary from scratch, and, in the veg garden, gets some pumpkins in the ground. Meanwhile, Sue Kent visits a garden in Carmarthenshire situated around a wooden house on stilts, and Carol Klein continues her class on how to grow plants for free, and this time she’s taking cuttings.

Dalgliesh

8pm, Channel 5

Bertie Carvel returns as a splendidly buttoned-up Commander Adam Dalgliesh in the first of three new 70s-set adaptations of PD James’s detective novels. After Dr Edmund Lorrimer, a senior forensic biologist, is found dead in his lab, Dalgliesh and DS Kate Miskin (Carlyss Peer) find the murderer lying in wait.

Hidden Treasures of the National Trust

9pm, BBC Two

The 18th-century Viennese-born, highly cultured Theresa Robinson might seem an unlikely bride for an MP in rural Devon, and indeed she did find life at Saltram House somewhat stifling. However, she had money (her own) and great taste, befriending a local artist – none other than Joshua Reynolds.

Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution

10pm, BBC Four

Disco may not immediately seem like a political genre, but this deeply sourced three-part series (a repeat from last year) makes a compelling case. Emerging from the gay and Black basement clubs of early 70s New York City, the music brought liberation and joy to Manhattan’s marginalised minorities before going on to conquer the world. We hear from George McCrae, Ana Matronic, Donna Summer and many others.

The Nevermets

11.15pm, Channel 4

Matt, a 38-year-old factory supervisor from Warrington, had never had a girlfriend before he met his Filipino love, Maria, online three years ago. Still a virgin, Matt is preparing to make the 7,000-mile journey to the Philippines and hopefully turn their online relationship into a physical one. But what does Maria think about all this?

Saturday
Pick of the day: Jana: Marked For Life

9pm, BBC Four

A new Scandi noir drama series settles in to BBC Four’s Saturday night schedules, the original UK home of subtitled crime thrillers. This one is set in the Swedish city of Norrköping, where Jana Berzelius (Madeleine Martin) has just begun her career as a prosecutor by investigating the murder of the head of the migration board. However, she hides the truth that she knows the victim and is seeking to uncover the secrets of her past. The case throws up unsettling memories for Jana, who was adopted at the age of 11 by her wealthy Swedish parents. Also starring August Wittgenstein.

Live Challenge Cup Rugby League

2pm, BBC One

There is a choice of rugby disciplines as BBC One visits Wembley Stadium, where Warrington Wolves and Wigan Warriors meet in League’s Challenge Cup final. Meanwhile, ITV1 is at Twickenham, where Northampton Saints play Bath in Union’s English Premiership finale. Both finals kick off at 3pm.

Doctor Who

6.45pm, BBC One

The Doctor Who wardrobe department will have been on the phone to Bridgerton’s as the Doctor and Ruby land in 1813, where guests at a duchess’s high society party are being murdered, and a mysterious bounty hunter called Rogue is about to “change the Doctor’s life for ever” (which, in the Timelord’s case, is a rather long time). Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson star in Russell T Davies’s latest sci-fi adventure.

A Royal Guide to Scotland

8pm, Channel 4

The Royal Family has a close association with Scotland, which has been the location of many key royal moments, from weekend hikes at Balmoral to university love affairs and the death of the Queen. However, it hasn’t always been such a close relationship – as this documentary aims to explore and analyse.

MoviePass, MovieCrash

9pm, Sky Documentaries

An illuminating documentary about the ill-fated (though now-revived) American subscription service that offered cinema tickets at a discounted rate. In just eight years, MoviePass went from being the fastest-growing subscription service since Spotify to a collapse and bankruptcy.

Rebus

9.15pm, BBC One

“We’re going to sell the drugs and we’re going to get out of here,” Michael (Brian Ferguson) assures his band of ex-army comrades – except that nobody steals drugs from Edinburgh crime boss Cafferty that easily. Looking for the culprits includes a nasty piece of torture with a blowtorch – and as a police officer asks when searching the scene of the crime: “Has somebody been cooking meat in here?” Gruesome, indeed.

Later… with Jools Holland

10.25pm, BBC Two

On stage at Alexandra Palace Theatre in London this week are Leeds indie group Yard Act, New Zealand singer-songwriter Jordan Rakei, Big Thief frontwoman Adrianne Lenker, artist and musician Lava La Rue and south London band Fat Dog. Singer Gabrielle also chats about her career and is joined by Jools for a song from her new album.

Sunday
​Pick of the day: Soccer Aid for Unicef 2024

6pm, ITV1

Dermot O’Leary and Alex Scott present live coverage of the annual charity fixture, as England take on the Soccer Aid World XI (kick-off 7.30pm) at Stamford Bridge. The England team includes the likes of Sam Thompson, Mo Farah and Jill Scott, with a World XI featuring Usain Bolt, Lee Mack and Eden Hazard, all playing in aid of the children’s charity. Scottish singer-songwriter Tom Walker provides the half-time entertainment.

Secret France with Dick and Angel

8pm, Channel 4

The Strawbridges head to Gascony. At an antiques market in the historic town of Lectoure, Dick and Angel pursue their well-established interests: Angel spots some French linen for which she has crafty plans, while Dick can’t resist buying a kitchen gadget handy for cooking duck.

The World’s Most Luxurious Retirement Homes

8pm, Channel 5

No, they haven’t just been added to the Conservative election manifesto – this particular retirement home, the modestly titled The Palace, is in Miami and this new series is yet another chance to gawp at how the wealthy live (and presumably die). The Palace features a swimming pool, a private theatre, a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and apartments costing up to $200,000 a year.

On Thin Ice: Putin Vs Greenpeace

9pm, BBC Two

Knowing what we now know about Vladimir Putin’s Russia, it would seem like extreme folly for Greenpeace activists to board a Russian oil rig in the Arctic and disrupt production. Back in 2013, however, they thought they might get off with a slapped wrist (“We have a good lawyer,” the leader assured his team) and this six-part series follows the ordeal as shots are fired and the protesters are thrown in a Russian jail. “It felt like we were stuck in the middle of a James Bond film,” says one.

The Piano: The Final

9pm, Channel 4

Claudia Winkleman presents the final concert that climaxes this tear-jerking sort-of-contest. The final seven must overcome their nerves before playing in front of a sold-out auditorium.

Crashed: $800m Festival Fail

9pm, BBC Three

It is unclear why the title of this documentary about the failed British music festival company Pollen has been valued in dollars – but either way, it went bust in 2022, owing tens of millions of pounds to staff and customers. The company was launched by two British brothers, who predicted an upsurge in demand for festivals after Covid. However, a combination of poorly managed events and the ongoing issues of the pandemic soon turned customers against them.

Maternity: Broken Trust

10.15pm, ITV1

Investigating alleged failures in maternity care at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, told through the experiences of families campaigning for answers to the death of their children. Leading the campaign are former NHS clinicians turned whistleblowers, Jack and Sarah Hawkins, who lost their baby daughter, Harriet, in still-unexplained circumstances.
