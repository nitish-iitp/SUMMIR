Meanwhile, Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown, a dedicated supporter of touch rugby, has been enthusiastically cheering for his team at DC Park since the competitions began on Monday.

The leaders, who recently convened at the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting hosted by the Cook Islands, are seen enjoying their time with their athletes in Honiara. Adeang and his delegation made regional headlines when they left the forum abruptly following questions about the appointment of the former Nauru President Baron Waqa to take over in 2024 as the next Secretary General for the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.

Putting politics aside, both leaders are actively participating in the Pacific Games cheering their athletes on. As of the last medal tally, Cook Islands boasts five gold medals while Nauru has one gold medal.

It is anticipated that the Papua New Guinea Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso and his delegation is next to arrive in Honiara this week for the Pacific Games. The official closing ceremony for the Games will be this Saturday 2 December 2023.
