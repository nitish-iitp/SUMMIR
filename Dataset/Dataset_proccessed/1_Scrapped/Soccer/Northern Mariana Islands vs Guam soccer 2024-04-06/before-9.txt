I have an M1A Scout Squad (with synthetic stock) on which I am running a Sig Tango6T 1-6 scope, along with an RMR on a 45 degree offset. The scope is mounted in the traditional M1A/M14 manner [via the receiver side attaching mount from Springfield], while the scout rail mount option has been dedicated to the offset RMR.

I'm seeking recommendations for a cheek riser. I prefer a synthetic attachment.

If I have to get a traditional leather wrap, that is okay, but if that is the case I would prefer one with a few loops. If a cloth/nylon riser then I would prefer one with an internal pouch for a few rounds of ammo.

Thanks!

Bradley cheek rests seem to be a popular option with the M1A crowd and they seem to check most of your boxes.

Is the Bradley a drill or no drill?

ISO Mat/closed cell foam strips duct taped to the stock then pop a stock pouch on it.

It just straps on to the stock I believe, no modifications needed.

There are cheap cloth blackhawk ones you can buy off ebay that come with foam that you pack into the cheek riser to get the height you want.

I was going to recommend the Fulton Armory Cheek Riser (if you can find one)

However, it appears to have disappeared from their site. Has multiple heights and is no-drill
