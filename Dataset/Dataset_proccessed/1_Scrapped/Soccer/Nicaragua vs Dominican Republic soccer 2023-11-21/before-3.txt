Different Ways to Apply the Ford Fusion Vinyl Wrap

Customizing your Ford Fiesta involves the application of a specialized vinyl film onto your vehicle's exterior, effectively concealing the original paint. Not only does this process allow for stunning color transformation, but it also unlocks an array of texture and design possibilities. It's a dual marvel that offers personalization and an armor of protection for your cherished Fiesta.

Full Wrap For Your Ford

A full wrap involves covering your entire Ford Fusion, from the front bumper to the rear bumper, with a sheet of vinyl film. This comprehensive approach opens up the opportunity to choose from a wide spectrum of colors, textures, and finishes, enabling a complete transformation of your car's exterior appearance.

It's important to note that fully wrapping a vehicle is a complex process best executed by skilled professionals. Their expertise ensures precise installation, the use of specialized tools, and thorough vehicle preparation, resulting in a flawless, high-quality finish. It's worth mentioning that a full wrap typically involves a higher cost due to the increased material and labor required.

Partial Wrap - Covering Selected Parts Of Your Ford

If you're inclined towards a more understated transformation or wish to highlight specific areas of your Ford Fusion, a partial wrap is a fantastic choice. This option allows you to cover select parts of the vehicle, such as the hood, roof, trunk, mirrors, or bumpers while leaving other areas untouched. Partial wraps can be a cost-effective way to introduce stylish accents that enhance your Ford Fusion's overall aesthetic.

It is important to consider color selection for partially wrapping your Ford. The shade of your wrap should either complement or be in contrast with the original color of your sedan. For example, if your Ford is in Ruby Red color, you can go for Super Glossy Piano Black vinyl wrap in contrast available at VinylFrog. Also, check the Carbon Fiber vinyl films that look excellent when used for selected coverage.

Partial Vehicle Wraps

Another way to choose a vinyl wrap shade for partial wrapping of your Ford Fusion is to look at the accent colors on your sedan, such as trim, logos, or detailing. Choosing a vinyl wrap color that matches or complements these accents can create a cohesive and well-integrated design.

You can also consider the purpose or theme you have in mind. For example, if you want a sporty look, bold and dynamic colors may be suitable. If you're going for a more understated appearance, muted or classic colors might be preferable.

The best way to decide is to look at the vinyl color samples or swatches. View them in different lighting conditions to get a better sense of how they will look on your Ford. At VinylFrog, you can get sample kits for not only vinyl films but paint protection films and window and headlight tints as well to help you make a decision.

Custom Printed Vinyl Wrap For Ford Fusion

For those who seek a truly unique appearance, a custom-printed wrap is the answer. With it, you have the creative freedom to design a distinct pattern and incorporate logos, images, or any visual elements that convey your personality and preferences. It's a perfect choice for those who want a one-of-a-kind design that reflects their individuality.

You can get anything that your heart desires printed on your Ford Fusion wrap. Some people also opt for anime wrap for their vehicles. The cost of this wrap is the highest whether you opt for partial or full coverage as the expense of graphic designing and printing is also included.

Split Vinyl Wraps

To achieve a visually captivating and distinctive design, you can opt for the split vinyl wrap on your Ford Fusion. This technique involves applying two different colored or textured vinyl films to create a unique configuration. The split can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or any other imaginative arrangement, allowing you to showcase your personality or promote a specific brand.

These are full-body wraps to give your sedan a distinct look. While split wraps offer endless possibilities, they do necessitate the expertise of a professional wrap installer to achieve a seamless and visually appealing result.

You can try different color combinations for it, for example, Glossy Metallic Metal Black and Vampire Red. In fact, any color looks great with black like Glossy Metallic Grape Purple, Candy Metallic Neon Yellow, and Glossy Metallic Glitter Champagne to name a few. You can also try combinations with white and silver vinyl wraps on your Ford Fusion.

Vinyl Decals For Your Ford Fusion

If you do not want to completely overhaul the look of your Ford Fusion but would like to add a touch of your personality to it, go for just the decals on the hood, roof, or sides. This is the most cost-effective option though it might not have protective benefits. Some vinyl decal ideas for your Ford Fusion are:

Apply racing stripes along the hood, roof, or trunk for a sporty and dynamic look. Choose a color that contrasts or complements your Ford’s original shade.
Add thinner accent stripes along the sides of the car or around the windows for a more subtle and stylish effect.
Consider a vinyl decal designed specifically for the hood or the roof of your Ford Fusion. This can include custom graphics, patterns, or even a matte black hood decal.
Place decals on the rear windshield. These can include brand logos, custom text, or graphics that reflect your interests.
Create custom vinyl graphics that represent your personal style such as abstract designs, geometric patterns, the logo of your favorite soccer or baseball team, or even your initials.
Consider adding pinstriping along the body lines of your Ford Fusion. This classic look can be customized to match the car's color scheme.
Use carbon fiber vinyl decals to add a modern and high-tech appearance to certain areas, such as the side mirrors, door handles, or trim pieces.
Choose reflective vinyl decals for increased visibility at night. This is not only a safety feature but can also add a unique element to your sedan's appearance.
How Much Vinyl Do You Need For The Ford Fusion Wrap?

The length of the Ford Fusion midsize sedan is approximately 192 inches. For its full wrap, you will need 55 to 60 feet of vinyl This amount also covers the extra needed in case of mistakes or mishaps.

For partial coverage, you will have to measure the specific area that you want wrapped in vinyl and then buy the film accordingly. It is best to consult with an automotive vinyl installer in this regard to get an accurate figure. 

The Cost To Vinyl Wrap The Ford Fusion

The cost of wrapping the Ford Fusion sedan depends on quite a few factors, however, if you want full coverage from a professional installer, keep the figure of $3000 in mind. It can be greater or less than this depending on several factors. 

The size of your Ford, the type and quality of vinyl chosen, color and finish preferences, design complexity, professional installation fees, any required preparation work, the style of wrap that is whether it's a partial or full wrap, and the geographical location and shop rates of the installer all play an important role in determining how much you will have to pay for wrapping your Ford.

Why Should You Get Your Ford Fusion Wrapped? 

The Ford Fusion is well-regarded for its blend of style and practicality. As its proud owner, you are well aware of your vehicle's worth and want to ensure it maintains its value and appearance for years to come. This is where a vinyl wrap proves invaluable. For those who would like to know its many benefits for their Ford Fusion, here’s a brief lowdown:

Preserving the Factory Finish

The primary advantage of applying a vinyl wrap is that it acts as a protective shield for your sedan's original paint. This means that, beneath the wrap, your Ford Fusion's factory finish remains untouched, pristine, and unharmed. When the time comes to sell your vehicle, you have the option to reveal the unblemished paint, potentially boosting its resale value.

Protection Against Everyday Hazards

The world outside can be harsh on your car's exterior. Vinyl wraps offer an additional layer of defense against common hazards like minor dings, scratches, road debris, tar, and even the occasional parking lot mishap. They also offer a shield against the onslaught of the harsh UV rays preserving the original paint of your Ford Fusion.

Easily Removable And Flexible

A significant advantage of vinyl wraps is their easy removal process. Unlike a permanent paint job, vinyl wraps can be removed without causing any harm to the original paint. This flexibility allows you to experiment with different looks or return your car to its factory appearance whenever you desire.

Limitless Design Possibilities

One of the most exciting aspects of vinyl wraps is that they provide the opportunity for personalization, enabling you to express your unique style and make a statement on the road. They offer a wide range of color, finish, and design options.

Whether you prefer a subtle color change, a bold and eye-catching graphic, or the introduction of a unique texture, vinyl wraps can bring your vision to life. While working with these superb films, your creative imagination knows virtually no bounds.

Your Ford Fusion is an extension of your personality. A vinyl wrap provides you with the canvas to showcase your individuality.
