Selena Lancaster, from Canada, joins the team for the first time, while another Canada-based player- Tafari Natti Bertrand- will make a comeback after five years.

Another change is the addition of Kezzy Vigilant, who has been recalled, since she last played for Dominica in its home match against Suriname, in the opening round of the 2023 Road to W Gold Cup.
