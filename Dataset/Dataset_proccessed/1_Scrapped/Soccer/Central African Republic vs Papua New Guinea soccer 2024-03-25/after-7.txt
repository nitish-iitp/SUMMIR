Bhutan take on Sri Lanka on Monday in a friendly.

Bhutan and Sri Lanka battle it out at the Sugathadasa Stadium in Colombo on Monday (March 25) in a friendly under the 2024 FIFA World Series.

On Friday, the two sides were in action under the new initiative, but both failed to win. Against Central African Republic, Bhutan are crushed 6-0 for one of their worst defeats in recent memory. Tresor Toropite and Hamissou Mamadou Dangabo scored , while Venuste Baboula and Karl Namnganda fired braces to down the Dragon Boys.

Head coach Kim Taen is likely to make a few changes to his XI after the lackluster show as the side aims to wrap up their international week on a positive note.

Sri Lanka, meanwhile, were held to a goalless stalemate by Papua New Guinea on the same day as their winless run extended to seven games. The Golden Army were playing for the third time since 2023 but didn't let their lack of gametime allow the Cuscus to walk all over them.

It was an encouraging result even when considering that Sri Lanka are ranked 204th in the world, with only six teams below them in the rankings.
