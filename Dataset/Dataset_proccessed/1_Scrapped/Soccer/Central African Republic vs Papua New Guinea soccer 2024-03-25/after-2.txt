Central African Republic vs Papua New Guinea Prediction

Central African Republic started their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers with a defeat to Comoros before claiming a memorable point at Mali. Their six-goal friendly victory over Bhutan would have helped boost confidence in Raoul Savoy's camp, and they will be aiming to build on this.

PNG, meanwhile, are the underdogs, and their chances of ending their long-wait for a win appear slim. Central African Republic's games in recent months tend to see both sides score, and this trend could continue in a narrow win for Les Fauves.
