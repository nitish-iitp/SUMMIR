Clubs who have provided the most players for England
Hundreds of players have represented the Three Lions over the years, and here we take a look at the top ten clubs who have provided the most England internationals.

With the final international break of 2023 now underway, club football is on pause for the next fortnight. Players are flying to all corners of the world to represent their respective countries. Some nations will be playing in friendlies, whilst others will be looking to secure their place in the 2024 European Championships in Germany.

Neither of these apply to Gareth Southgate’s England, who secured their place in the Group Stages of the 2024 European Championships after a sensational 3 – 1 win over Italy at Wembley. This was good revenge for the home side, as the Azzurri had beaten them in the EURO 2020 Final at the same venue.

The November international break will see England take on Malta and North Macedonia in their final two EURO 2024 Qualifiers. Southgate’s team will now be looking to win their group, and they have a good chance of doing just that against two teams they are expected to beat.

Now that international football is taking over the football world for the next two weeks, we decided to look at the top ten clubs who have produced the most England Senior Internationals over the course of more than 100 years.

10 – Southampton, Derby County & Newcastle United: 39 players each

We start off this list with Southampton, Derby County and Newcastle United, who have provided 39 players each for England. Legendary Goalkeeper Peter Shilton got 125 caps for England throughout his career and played for both Southampton and Derby County. He was with the Saints from 1982 to 1987 and the Rams from 1987 to 1992.

The most recent player to have represented England at Southampton is right-back Kyle Walker-Peters, who still plays for the South Coast Club. As for Derby, the most recent Derby player to play for England was Seth Johnson in 2000.
