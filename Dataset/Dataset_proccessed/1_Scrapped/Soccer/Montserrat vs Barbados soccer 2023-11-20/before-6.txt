READY FOR THE SHOW—Blender
SHARE

After his performance at a Reggae Jam Festival in Lilongwe last month where he shared the stage with fellow Jamaican artist Luciano, reggae singer and producer Everton Blender dates Blantyre for his second gig at Mibawa Multipurpose Hall Saturday.

The legendary musician, known for his smooth, crooning, tenor vocals, up-tempo arrangements, and spiritually uplifting themes, successfully bridging the gap between roots reggae and dancehall, will come face to face with the country’s legend Soldier Lucius Banda.

One of the members of the organising team of the concert, Ras Ray Harawa, said Friday that the concert is there to give a chance to people, who missed the Reggae Jam Festival in Lilongwe to sample Blender’s act.

“Some people missed the Reggae Jam Festival in Lilongwe and, so, because Everton Blender is still here for some days, he accepted to hold another concert,” Ras Ray Harawa, who has since indicated that he is retiring in the field, said.

He described Everton Blender as a legend and that he showed this during his performance in Lilongwe.

“He is energetic and always delivers and so, he is ready for the showdown,” Ras Ray said.

LUCIUS— It feels good to hang around

Apart from Soldier Lucius Banda, who will be performing at the gig fresh from his feats in Kenya last weekend, the other performers on the line-up are Tuff Lions Band, Nepman and Sam Smack.

Ras Ray said Everton Blender loves Malawi and that he is contemplating building a house in the country.

“This actually is not the first time for him to visit Malawi, he has been here before and in it was during his first visit that he fell in love with Malawi,” he said.

The 68-year old artist is expected to come to Blantyre today ahead of the performance tomorrow.

Lucius could not be drawn to comment on the show yesterday as we went to press.

Meanwhile, Ras Ray Harawa, who was the band manager for reggae group Black Missionaries, has said that he will be retiring having served the creative industry for over 30 years.

“I am retiring because I have done my part. Now is the time to let the young people do the job. I will still be available here and there to offer my expertise but I want to channel all my powers to farming now,” he said.

He has since said that he will hold a farewell show on December 23 2023.

“To the other side, my retiring is to do with my health. I have not been available in some of the shows that Black Missionaries has been holding. I have wanted to retire for the past six years. So for the farewell show, I will come back to announce the performers,” Ras Ray said.

He said the farewell show was also part of a platform to raise funds for a cause.
