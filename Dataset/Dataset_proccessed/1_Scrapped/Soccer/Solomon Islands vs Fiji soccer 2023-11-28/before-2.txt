TEAM Solomon female beach volleyball duo Hanna Donga and Kirstin Baimasi are set and ready to hit the sand tomorrow in front of the home crowd.

The girls will take on Fiji at the SIFF Academy facility starting tomorrow [Tuesday, November 28, 2023] at 8:00 p.m. Solomon Islands, Fiji, and PNG are placed in pool A of the XVII Pacific Games 2023 Beach Volleyball competition.

The young beach volleyball star and team captain, Ms. Hanna Donga, expressed excitement for the match, saying they are trilled and eager to compete on home soil in front of their families, friends, and, of course, the other participating Pacific countries.

Ms. Donga, 25, from Malaita province, participated in two Pacific Games, in 2015 in PNG and 2019 in Samoa, as well as one Mini Pacific Game in 2017 in Vanuatu, where she won a silver medal for the nation alongside her former partner, Rose Gwali.

“It gives me great pleasure to be participating in the 2023 Pacific Games with my partner. It is going to be a wonderful feeling to have our family, close friends, and relatives there to lift our spirits.

“We look forward to representing our country to the best of our abilities,” she added.

Ms. Donga urged Honiara residents to attend tomorrow’s match in support of Team Solomon Islands’ female beach volleyball team.

She later thanked the national beach volleyball team coach, Mr. Ben Kefu, the Solomon Islands National Institute of Sports (SINIS), and the Games Organising Committee (GOC) for their ongoing assistance with recovery physiotherapy training and uniform preparation for the Pacific Games.
