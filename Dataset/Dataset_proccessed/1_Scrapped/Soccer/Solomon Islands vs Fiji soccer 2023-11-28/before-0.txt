PNG Women’s football team have advanced to the Gold medal playoffs after defeating Samoa 5-1 in the semifinal earlier today.

The Ramona Padio skippered side were down with one player (Serah Waida, red card) but manage to hold off the Samoans till the full-time whistle.

They will now await the winner of the 3pm semifinal between New Caledonia and Fiji.

The belief in the team remains intact and coach Frederica Sakette and her hard-working coaching staff knows what the team will polish up on heading into Friday’s gold medal final.

As publicly stated by Padio during the official Team PNG farewell two weeks ago that they will defend their 2019 Gold medal, history awaits them in another daunting task of 90 minutes football set to be hosted at the Solomon Islands national stadium.
