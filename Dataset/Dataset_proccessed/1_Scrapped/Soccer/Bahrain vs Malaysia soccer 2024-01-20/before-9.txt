By Aaron Howey

Cork City FC are pleased to announce that Cian Coleman has signed back with the club for the 2024 season.

The 27-year-old has now made over 100 appearances for the club, and he told CorkCityFC.ie that he was pleased to have re-signed:  “I’m glad to have signed a new contact with the club. it’s a big season for us. We want to win the league and I know that myself and everyone in the club will be giving everything to make that happen. The manager has put a good squad together and I’m looking forward to getting back in front of our fans in Turner’s Cross”.

City boss Tim Clancy gave his thoughts on the news, saying: “I am pleased to have Cian signed back for the season ahead. We needed to add some more numbers in defensive areas, which he does, and he also has a lot of experience which he can bring to the group. Having spoken to him, I know he is hungry to roll his sleeves up and work hard for the club.”
