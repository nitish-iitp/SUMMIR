Carlo Geromin C.E.O Gruppo Geromin

“Gruppo Geromin has always supported the world of sport, a passion which embodies deeply rooted values such as teamwork and individual excellence, the spirit of sacrifice and technical ability.
In this sense, supporting Venezia Football Club is a natural and proper approach for us: just like our company, Venezia FC plays the role of global ambassador of the city of Venice, supporting its preservation and promoting its cultural strength. A strength that embraces all the craftsmanship, the inclination to innovation, the great spirit of excellence combined with constant commitment, typical of our territory.
Gruppo Geromin strongly reflects this same soul: our team works feeling part of one big crew sailing towards the emotion of a new product, with the desire to show the world what we have achieved, with the curiosity to learn new techniques and the determination to reach ever more ambitious goals. This is the spirit that animates us every day, the same spirit that we find in a healthy, pioneering sports club like Venezia Football Club’.

Filippo Antonelli, Sporting Director & General Manager Venezia FC

“This partnership represents a further significant step in the constant development of companies based in our territory which are leaders in their own sector. We have several points in common with Gruppo Geromin, from commitment to innovation and the constant search for improvement. All these values are at the heart of both our companies. We are happy to be able to count on partners who share the same business philosophy with us.”
