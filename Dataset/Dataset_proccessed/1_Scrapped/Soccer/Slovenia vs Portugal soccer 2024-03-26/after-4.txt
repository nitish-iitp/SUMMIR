Cristiano Ronaldo fumed as he left the pitch following Portugal's 2-0 defeat away to Slovenia in a friendly on Tuesday night.

The 39-year-old superstar sat out the previous game against Sweden, which took Roberto Martinez's side to 11 straight wins under his control, but Ronaldo returned to start the game in Ljublana. 

However, second half goals from midfielders Adam Cerin and Timi Elsnik ensured that Slovenia got a surprise victory over Portugal - leaving Ronaldo unhappy.

Footage showed the Al Nassr star storming off the pitch at the end of the game. 

Portugal had ten shots during the game, two of which fell Ronaldo's way, but they were unable to convert any of their chances, and became undone by a resilient performance from the hosts, who will be in England's group at Euro 2024.

Portugal's top goalscorer was barely involved, and spent more time trying to find fouls and appealing to officials than making a difference between the two sides.  

Martinez made it 11 straight wins since he took over, as they beat Sweden 5-2 on Thursday, with Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes among the goalscorers.

But they will have to revisit the drawing board for their June friendlies against Finland, Croatia and Ireland, as they look to go into the European Championships on the right foot. 

At Euro 2024, Portugal will face Czechia, Turkey, and Georgia, who beat Greece on penalties after a play-off match which descended into anarchy with a mass melee.
