Portugal head coach Roberto Martinez has revealed that Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias, Joao Palhinha, Nelson Semedo, Toti Gomes, Rafael Leao, Bruno Fernandes and Goncalo Ramos will not be involved in next week's friendly with Slovenia.

All eight featured in Thursday's clash with Sweden, which Portugal won 5-2, with Leao, Matheus Nunes, Fernandes, Bruma and Ramos on the scoresheet.

A Selecao das Quinas will be bidding to make it 12 straight victories in all competitions when they take on Slovenia on Tuesday night.

Martinez has revealed that there will be changes for the contest, with eight players being rested, which will open the door for Cristiano Ronaldo, Diogo Dalot, Joao Cancelo, Danilo Pereira, Otavio, Ruben Neves, Vitinha and Joao Felix to come into the squad.

"The players that will rest in the the next game are Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias, Joao Palhinha, Nelson Semedo, Toti Gomes, Rafael Leao, Bruno Fernandes and Goncalo Ramos," Martinez told reporters following the impressive win over Sweden.

"Hence, eight players will leave and another eight players will arrive at a high level for the second game, with hunger and a lot of energy, I hope."

Portugal are set to play another four friendlies against Slovenia, Finland, Croatia and Republic of Ireland before opening their Euro 2024 campaign against Czech Republic on June 18.

Martinez has a perfect record since arriving as head coach last January, winning all 11 of his games at the helm.

"It was a good and important test for us," Martinez added after the clash with Sweden. "Sweden have very good strikers. We worked on defensive concepts and it was a good experiment.

"There are other concepts that we need to work on and improve in our next game at Slovenia. It was great to play against a talented team of this level."

Portugal won the European Championship in 2016, but they were eliminated in the last-16 stage of the 2020 competition, suffering a 1-0 defeat to Belgium.

The Iberian nation made the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup, meanwhile, losing out to Morocco in the final eight.
