Spain lineup vs. Germany: Predicted XI for Euro 2024 quarter-final match

Spain boss Luis de la Fuente is expected to name an unchanged starting lineup for Friday's Euro 2024 quarter-final showdown with Germany at the MHPArena in Stuttgart, with Lamine Yamal set to continue in attack.

At the age of just 16 years and 353 days, Barcelona prodigy Yamal became the youngest-ever player to feature in the knockout rounds of a European Championship when he started and registered an assist in Spain's 4-1 comeback victory over Georgia in the last 16.

Yamal is now bidding to become the youngest-ever player to feature in a quarter-final tie on the continental stage and could become the youngest-ever goalscorer in Euros history if he makes the net ripple on Friday.

The teenage wonderkid is expected to retain his spot on the right side of a front three next to captain and striker Alvaro Morata, and in-form winger Nico Williams who scored and assisted during a scintillating display against Georgia.

Both Fabian Ruiz and Rodri were also on the scoresheet and are set to link arms with Pedri in centre-midfield, although Dani Olmo - another goalscorer against Georgia - Mikel Merino and Fermin Lopez will be among those hoping to force their way into the first XI.

Nacho Fernandez has recovered from a minor foot injury to make himself available for selection, but the ex-Real Madrid man is unlikely to displace either of Aymeric Laporte or Robin Le Normand in central defence, while Dani Carvajal and Marc Cucurella should continue as full-backs.

Spain possible starting lineup: Simon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata, Williams
