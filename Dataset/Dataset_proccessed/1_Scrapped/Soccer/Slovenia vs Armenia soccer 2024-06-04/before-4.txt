Popular demand: The Urus SE is the first in the line of electrified Lambos.

Lambo is going electric. The legendary Italian supercar manufacturer introduced its second Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle to Toronto May 8. As a family car, the 2025 Lamborghini Urus SE PHEV marks a dramatic turn for a brand known for splashy supercars.

The EV, which made its global debut at the Beijing Auto Show April 24, makes 789 horsepower, thanks to a hybrid powertrain (engine, transmission and driveshaft); a twin-turbo, four-litre V8 married to a 25-kWh lithium-ion battery. That means it can rocket to 100 km/h somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3.4 seconds. But it can also travel up to 60 kilometres on 100 per cent electric four-wheel drive (4WD). Oh, and it has a top speed of 312 km/h — outperforming the previous model’s 305 km/h limit.
