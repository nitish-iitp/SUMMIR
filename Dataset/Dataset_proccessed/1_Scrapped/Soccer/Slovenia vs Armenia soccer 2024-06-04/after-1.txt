A basketball and volleyball court; enclosed dog park (the second one in Gresham); 300 trees and 1,000 shrubs; amenity plaza with food trucks and permanent bathrooms; and, most excitingly, eight pickleball courts.

All of this is coming to Gradin Sports Park, 2303 S.E. Palmquist Rd., as part of Phase II Development, which had an official groundbreaking Tuesday, June 4.

Former Mayor Shane Bemis, Mayor Travis Stovall and Rep. Ricki Ruiz share a laugh during the Gradin groundbreaking.
