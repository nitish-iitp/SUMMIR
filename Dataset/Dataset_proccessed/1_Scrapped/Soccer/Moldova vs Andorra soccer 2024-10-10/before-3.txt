Moldova will attempt to claim a third consecutive victory when they welcome Andorra to Chisinau for Thursday's UEFA Nations League clash.

Meanwhile, the visitors will be desperate to clinch a positive result after losing each of their last five internationals.

Moldova are competing in League D for the second straight edition of the UEFA Nations League after missing out on promotion by the narrowest of margins in 2022-23.

The Tricolours matched Latvia's 13-point tally, but they ultimately missed out on top spot on head-to-head goal difference.

Moldova made a promising start to their latest promotion bid, with Mihail Caimacov and Ion Nicolaescu grabbing a goal apiece in last month's 2-0 victory over Malta.

They then went on to record a narrow 1-0 win in a friendly against San Marino, making it four victories from their last five internationals.

Not only will those results offer encouragement, but Moldova can also draw inspiration from the fact that they have won each of their last four Nations League matches.

Andorra are competing in League D for the fourth consecutive edition of the Nations League despite enjoying their best campaign in 2023-24.

After failing to win a single match in the first two editions, Andorra finally got off the mark with two victories over Liechtenstein in their previous Nations League campaign.

Unfortunately for Andorra, they could only take two points from their other four matches, ensuring that they had to settle for a third-placed finish.

Andorra began the 2024-25 competition with a narrow 1-0 defeat in last month's home clash with Malta, leaving them without a win in 19 internationals.

The visitors have struggled to trouble the scorers in times, having failed to find the net in 11 of their previous 12 internationals.

Incidentally, their winning run in the Nations League began with a 2-1 home win in their most recent meeting with Andorra in June 2022 when Caimacov and Nicolaescu both scored from the penalty spot.

The hosts are unable to call upon midfielder Serafim Cojocari, who has been forced to withdraw from the squad through injury.

Moldova boss Serghei Clescenco is set to line up with Artur Craciun, Victor Mudrac and Denis Marandici as his three centre-backs.

In the final third, Clescenco will want to utilise Nicolaescu as his number nine, but the striker may have to be assessed after sitting out Heerenveen's last two matches due to injury.

Meanwhile, Villarreal 'B' goalkeeper Iker Alvarez is expected to line up between the posts for Andorra.

The shot-stopper is likely to be shielded by a back five of Moises San Nicolas, Ian Olivera, Max Llovera, Joel Guillen and Joan Cervos.

Berto Rosas is set to offer one of Andorra's main attacking threats, with the striker looking to add to the four goals that he has scored for his country.


Moldova possible starting lineup:
Celeadnic; Craciun, Mudrac, Marandici; Platica, Rata, Reabciuk; Caimacov, Ionita, Nicolaescu

Andorra possible starting lineup:
Alvarez; San Nicolas, Olivera, Llovera, Guillen, Cervos; Teixeira, E. Vales, M. Vales; Rosas, Cucu



We say: Moldova 2-0 Andorra

Andorra have failed to score in each of their last five matches, and with the visitors struggling to offer an attacking threat, we think that the hosts will take advantage of their opponent's weakness to claim a fifth win in six internationals.
