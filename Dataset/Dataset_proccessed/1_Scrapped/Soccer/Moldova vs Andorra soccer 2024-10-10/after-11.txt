The increased competitive balance of the Nations League generates more interest from supporters, media and commercial partners – an important consideration for UEFA, as we see the significance of national team competitions as vital in boosting the resources of our member associations as they continue to recover from the financial hit of the COVID-19 pandemic.


Since its inception, the Nations League has provided a platform for more competitive and meaningful matches – without adding any fresh dates to the calendar.


The UEFA Nations League continues to give national teams at all levels fresh opportunities, with thirty-three national teams earning at least one promotion since the competition's inception. Not only does this help them to climb the overall rankings, it also improves their chances of a more favourable draw in the European Qualifiers.
