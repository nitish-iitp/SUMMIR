Amery Middle School is being recognized nationally. The middle school was one of 356 schools in the nation awarded the Blue Ribbon Award, given to schools with high overall academic achievement. In Wisconsin, Amery is just one of eight schools chosen for the prestigious award and one of 50 middle schools nationwide.

“The Department of Education names Blue Ribbon Schools, and it's the highest award a school can get,” said Tom Bensen, Amery Middle School Principal. “It was pretty exciting to have been nominated for one. So basically, there are specific requirements that you have to meet to be nominated, and that's to be a top academic performing school. And then also have narrow learning gaps.”
