PENDLETON — It was not entirely the Landon Robinson show for Walhalla High School football team on Friday night at Pendleton, but on paper, it would be easy to think it was.

The Razorbacks returned to action with a 20-7 win against the Bulldogs to open region play at Cunningham Stadium behind Robinson’s 305 yards rushing on 52 carries, with three touchdowns to his credit as well.
