Trinidad and Tobago thrashed the Bahamas 7-1 to jump to the top of Group B of Concacaf qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

T&T drew 2-2 with Grenada on Wednesday but fell to third in the table after Costa Rica whipped St Kitts and Nevis 4-0 on Thursday.

However, Angus Eve's men raced out to a 4-0 lead in the first half to put the game beyond the Bahamians at the St Kitts and Nevis Football Association Technical Center in Basseterre.

Malcolm Shaw notched the opening goal in the sixth minute before Alvin Jones converted a 14th minute penalty to double T&T's advantage.

Duane Muckette scored two goals in the last two minutes of the first half to give T&T a dominant lead 4-0.

The second half began with a goal from Reon Moore in the 56th minute before Shaw added a second in the 66th.

Teenager Nathaniel James scored his third international goal in five games to give T&T a 7-0 lead.

The Bahamas pulled back a consolation goal in the 86th minute with Wood Julmis scoring.

Trinidad and Tobago play their next FIFA World Cup qualifying games on 5 June 2025 at home against St Kitts and Nevis, and on 10 June 2025 away to Costa Rica.

Costa Rica plays Grenada in St George's on Sunday at Warner Park in Group B.
