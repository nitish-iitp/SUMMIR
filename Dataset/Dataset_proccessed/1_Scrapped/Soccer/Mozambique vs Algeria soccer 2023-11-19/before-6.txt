In the heart of Maputo, Mozambique, football enthusiasts are gearing up for a spectacle that promises to be nothing short of breathtaking. On Sunday, November 19, 2023, the Estádio Nacional do Zimpeto will witness a clash between two formidable teams – Mozambique and Algeria – in a battle that extends beyond the field, capturing the essence of passion, talent, and national pride.

Unbeaten in their last eight games and boasting three consecutive victories on foreign soil, the Desert Foxes, led by the seasoned Riyad Mahrez, are ready to showcase their prowess.

Team news and Injury

In the latest team news, Mozambique face a setback as Catamo grapples with a muscle injury expected to keep him sidelined through late November 2023. Meanwhile, over in Algeria, goalkeeper Zeghba is dealing with a shoulder injury that may keep him out of action for just a few days. Amoura, also from the Algerian squad, is nursing a shoulder injury as well, but he’s eyeing a return to the pitch around mid-December 2023. Adding to the injury list for Algeria is Bennacer, who is contending with a knee injury, with hopes of making a comeback in mid-December 2023.

On a brighter note, Rayan Ait-Nouri is set to rejoin the Algerian national team camp after missing out on the October internationals due to injury. The full-back, eager to contribute to his team’s qualification efforts for the 2026 World Cup, looks to add to his three caps earned so far. His return is timely as Algeria prepares for challenging matches against Somalia and Mozambique. The team is optimistic about overcoming these hurdles and securing their spot in the prestigious tournament.
