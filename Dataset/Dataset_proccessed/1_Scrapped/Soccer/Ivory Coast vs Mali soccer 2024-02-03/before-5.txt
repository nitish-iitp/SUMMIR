Egypt and Ghana are the most and third-most successful sides in the Africa Cup Of Nations history, respectively. The former have won seven titles - two more than Cameroon - while the latter four, their combined haul standing at 11. (More Football News)

In the 2023 edition of the tournament, both found themselves in the same group, alongside two minnows in Mozambique and Cape Verde, yet it was Cape Verde, who topped the group ahead of the two behemoths, proving that, in AFCON, history counts for little.

Cape Verde have been a revelation, thus far, in the Africa Cup of Nations 2023. The Blue Sharks beat Ghana in their opening match of the tournament and later held Egypt to a 2-2 draw. In the knockouts, Cape Verde beat Mauritania 1-0 to confirm their spot adjacent to South Africa sor the last eight round.

South Africa, who, despite starting slowly, have picked up steam over the tournament. Bafana Bafana lost their opener to Mali, but beat neighbours Namibia 4-0 in the very next match to all but secure a place in the round-of-16. However, their most significant success, so far, came in the first level of the knockouts, where they eliminated FIFA World Cup 2022 semi-finalists Morocco with a regular-time win.

Cape Verde Vs South Africa, Africa Cup Of Nations, Head-To-Head

Their respective punctuated appearances over decades of AFCON competitions mean that Cape Verde and South Africa will meet in the continental cup for only the second time in history. The first meeting between the pair yielded a 0-0 stalemate in 2013 in the opening match of the South Africa-based edition.
