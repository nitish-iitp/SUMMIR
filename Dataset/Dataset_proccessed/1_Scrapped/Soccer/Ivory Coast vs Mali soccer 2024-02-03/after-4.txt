TELL ME MORE

Despite advancing to the last four, the Africa Cup of Nations hosts rode their luck for much of the contest as goalkeeper Yahia Fofana saved Melbourne Victory's Adama Traore's tame spot-kick after Odilon Kossounou brought down Lassine Sinayoko in the box. The Elephants defender Kossounou was then sent off shortly before half-time for a second yellow after fouling Sinayoko in a first half of few chances.

The Eagles deservedly took the lead 19 minutes from time through Nene Dorgeles's superb 25-yard strike only for substitute Simon Adingra to stab home an equaliser in the 90th minute. Just as it looked as if the game was going to penalties, fellow substitute Diakite, who was sent off at the death for a second yellow as he took off his shirt while celebrating, was in the right place at the right time to knock Mali out of the tournament with seconds of the contest remaining. That led to a furious reaction from the Mali players, with Hamari Traore also being shown a red card as a result.

THE MVP

Oumar Diakite: While Simon Adingra grabbed an unlikely equaliser in normal time, the 20-year-old was the hero as he helped the Elephants into the last four in the most unlikeliest of circumstances. However, he will miss the semi-final after the substitute picked up a second yellow card for taking off his shirt.

THE BIG LOSER

Odilon Kossounou: The defender had a day to forget after initially conceding a penalty, something he received a yellow card for, and then he clumsily hacked down Sinayoko for a second time to be given his marching orders. He will miss the semi-final.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Following Ivory Coast's victory, they will face the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who beat Guinea in the last eight, in the semi-finals of the competition on Wednesday in Abidjan. The AFCON final takes place on February 11.
