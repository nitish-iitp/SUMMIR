Armenia fell 2-0 to North Macedonia in their UEFA Nations League clash in Skopje, North Macedonia.

Despite holding a numerical advantage after North Macedonia’s Gjoko Zajkov was sent off in first-half stoppage time for a second yellow card, Armenia was unable to break through and capitalize.

After a goalless first half, North Macedonia took the lead in the 70th minute when Enis Bardhi found the back of the net with a well-placed shot. Just eight minutes later, Bojan Miovski doubled their advantage, securing the 2-0 victory. Despite Armenia’s efforts, they were unable to find the net or breach North Macedonia’s resilient defense.

This result leaves Armenia with one win and one loss in their Nations League campaign. Armenia began their tournament on a high note with a convincing 4-1 victory over Latvia on Saturday, September 7, 2024, in Yerevan. In that match, Vahan Bichakhchyan opened the scoring early, with Eduard Spertsyan and Lucas Zelarayán contributing to an impressive win.

Armenia will look to regroup as they continue their Nations League campaign next month.

Upcoming Matches:

Match Day 3: Armenia vs. Faroe Islands

Thursday, October 10, 2024 – Armenia will travel to Tórshavn to face the Faroe Islands in a crucial third-round match.

Match Day 4: Armenia vs. North Macedonia

Sunday, October 13, 2024 – Armenia will host North Macedonia, hoping to avenge their recent defeat in Skopje.

Match Day 5: Armenia vs. Faroe Islands

Thursday, November 14, 2024 – Armenia will meet the Faroe Islands once again, this time at home, aiming to secure maximum points.

Match Day 6: Armenia vs. Latvia

Sunday, November 17, 2024 – Armenia will conclude their group stage with a visit to Latvia, looking to replicate their earlier success.

With one win and one loss so far, Armenia’s Nations League journey remains competitive, and the next few matches will be crucial for their chances of advancing.
