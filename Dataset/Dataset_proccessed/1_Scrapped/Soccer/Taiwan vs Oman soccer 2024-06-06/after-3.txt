Oman beat Chinese Taipei 3-0 in their previous clash

Chinese Taipei host Oman at the Taipei Municipal Stadium in Taiwan on Thursday for their penultimate game in the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

With four losses in their previous four outings, Chinese Taipei's hopes of reaching the next round of the qualifiers are long over. Having cantered into the round with a 7-0 aggregate victory over East Timor, the Blue Wings failed to produce any of that attacking flair here, netting just once, while conceding 11 times.

So, without a single point in the bag right now, Chinese Taipei are at the bottom of Group D, but have assured their place in the third round of the Asia Cup qualifiers.

Ranked 159th in the world, Gary White's side will be hoping to get a point on the board in their final two games, but Oman are no pushovers. The Reds crushed them 3-0 in their opening qualifier, courtesy of goals from Omar Al-Maliki and Mataz Saleh on either side of an own goal from Pan Wen-chieh.

Since their disappointing 2023 AFC Asian Cup campaign earlier this year, the Middle Eastern side have managed to recover themselves and post back-to-back qualifying wins over Malaysia, both 2-0.

With nine points in the bag, Oman are level with Kyrgyzstan, but trail on the number of goals scored, although they have two more games to turn things around and win the group.
