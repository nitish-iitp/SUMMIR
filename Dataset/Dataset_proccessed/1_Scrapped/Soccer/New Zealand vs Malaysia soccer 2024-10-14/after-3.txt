PETALING JAYA: Harimau Malaya let in four second half goals in a 4-0 loss to New Zealand in a Tier 1 friendly at the North Harbour Stadium in Auckland earlier today.

New Zealand broke the deadlock in the 53rd minute when Elijah Just finished off a pass from Liberato Cacace after a counter-attack, reported The New Zealand Herald.

Matthew Garbett bagged the hosts’ second goal after receiving a pass from Cacace just past the hour mark, and substitute Chris Wood made it 3-0 after pouncing on a rebound in the 72nd minute.

Fellow substitute Logan Rogerson capped off a successful night for New Zealand with a powerful shot from outside the penalty area in the 90th minute.

Harimau Malaya last took on the All Whites in 2006, losing both friendlies 1-0 and 2-1.

It was the first time the national team have laced up since they won the Pestabola Merdeka tournament on Sept 8 with a 1-0 win over Lebanon.

The All Whites, meanwhile, were coming off a 3-0 win against Tahiti in a World Cup qualifier on Friday.

Malaysia take on India in another friendly on Nov 19 before starting their 2024 Asean Football Federation (AFF) Cup campaign against Cambodia on Dec 8.
