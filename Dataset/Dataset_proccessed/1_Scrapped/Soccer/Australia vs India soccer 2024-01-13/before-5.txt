Subway Socceroos unveil new brand campaign ahead of AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023™
Football Australia Media
Updated: 06:34am Jan 10, 2024
A new brand campaign underpinning the Subway Socceroos AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023™ journey and beyond – ‘A Different Breed’ – has been officially released ahead of the squad’s arrival in Doha for the tournament.

‘A Different Breed’ epitomises the distinctive identity that the Subway Socceroos have cultivated over many generations, and the way that collective journey has shaped the image of the current squad.

The campaign – developed in partnership with Ogilvy Australia – characterises the way the Subway Socceroos have inspired a nation and galvanised the football community through their many on-field exploits.

‘A Different Breed’ encapsulates the belief, desire, and spirit of the Subway Socceroos as they begin to write the next chapter in their storied history.

The focal point of the campaign launch will be a video featuring Keanu Baccus, Mitchell Duke, Jackson Irvine, Sam Silvera and Harry Souttar – representative of the current core of players who have been so pivotal to the Subway Socceroos’ success, as well as the next generation of talent beginning their national team journey.

Football Australia CEO, James Johnson said ‘A Different Breed’ would resonate strongly with Subway Socceroos fans old and new.

“I think it’s a fantastic way to capture the essence of this Subway Socceroos team,” Johnson said.

“The Australian men’s national team is littered with stories of pioneers and champions across the course of history, and their influence on the identity of this team is still evident today.

“Those who have watched on for many years will hold fond memories of moments that this team has left a nation in awe – no more so than the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 – and deeply understand what this campaign represents, while for the next generation of fans ‘A Different Breed’ makes immediately clear what this team stands for.

“Arnie and the senior members of his squad have worked tirelessly to build a camaraderie that has become the cornerstone of this group’s success, ‘A Different Breed’ is a way for us to showcase that across what is an important period for the Subway Socceroos,” concluded Johnson.

Subway Socceroos captain, Maty Ryan said ‘A Different Breed’ spoke to the many journeys the squad members had taken to become part of the national team.

“This campaign is about our characteristics as a collective, the things we know make us uniquely Australian,” Ryan said.

“The identity of this team, our values and how we want to play are so important to our success and we felt ‘A Different Breed’ summed those things up perfectly,” Ryan concluded.

The campaign will run across the Subway Socceroos entire FIFA World Cup 2026™ qualification campaign, with promos/television commercials, a national presence through OOH and radio; as well as digital ads and digital activations through the official Subway Socceroos and Football Australia social channels.
