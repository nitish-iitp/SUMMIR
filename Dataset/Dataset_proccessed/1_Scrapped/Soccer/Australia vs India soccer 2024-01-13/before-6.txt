Socceroos History vs India
Australia will meet India for the ninth time in ‘A’ internationals when they face their in their opening Group B match of AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023™ on Saturday, 13 January.

Ironically, this is the encounter since the two nations last crossed paths in the 2011 edition of the tournament’s group stage. That too was a matchday one clash which saw the Subway Socceroos prevail with a convincing 4-0 display.  

Graham Arnold’s side will be determined to make a positive start to its campaign ahead of subsequent group matches against Syria and Uzbekistan respectively. 

Head-to-head

Played: 8
Wins: 4
Draws: 1
Losses: 3


1938 | 5-3 win | International Friendly 

Australia hosted India in a ‘five-match series’ in 1938, travelling around the country which started in Sydney. The Aussies claimed a 5-3 win thanks to braces from Alf Quill and Jack Hughes and a solitary goal from James Wilkinson. 

1938 | 4-4 draw | International Friendly

The following week the two sides met in Brisbane and played out an entertaining 4-4 stalemate. Jack Hughes netted another double, while Redvis Kitching and Cec Brittain were on target.

1938 | 4-1 loss | International Friendly

Australia’s first defeat came in the third encounter, this time in Newcastle. Jack Hughes scored his fifth goal of the series but it proved inconsequential against an Indian side too strong on the day.

1938 | 5-4 win | International Friendly

The hosts responded with another epic win in Sydney, prevailing 5-4. Jack Hughes’ impressive form continued, bagging an inevitable double, James Wilkinson grabbed two of his own and Ray Bryant scored one.

1938 | 3-1 win | International Friendly

A month after the first meeting, the two teams would play the fifth and final match at the MCG in October. To no surprise Jack Hughes scored his customary goal – his eighth of the series – while skipper William Coolahan and Frank McIver added a goal each.

1956 | 4-2 loss | Olympic Games

Eighteen years would pass before the next meeting at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. However, a number of ‘professional’ players were absent from the team with the likes of defender Joe Marston and midfielders Tom Jack and Cliff Almond. Despite a plucky 2-0 win over Japan in the game prior they could not overcome an India side four days later. Bruce Morrow twice restored parity but the Blue Tigers scored twice in the second half through J. Krishna Kittu.

1956 | 7-1 loss | International Friendly

Following the conclusion of the Olympics, a friendly was organised in Sydney. However, unfortunately for Australia they were comprehensively beaten with Brian Vogler, scoring a mere consolation.

2011 | 4-0 win | AFC Asian Cup

Australia would face India for the first time in an ‘A’ international in nearly 55 years and made the perfect start to AFC Asian Cup campaign in 2011. It took just 11 minutes for the Green and Gold side to open the scoring in its opening Group C match with Tim Cahill finishing off Brett Emerton’s square ball. Harry Kewell doubled the lead soon after finding a pocket of space before arrowing a long-range shot with precision into the bottom corner. In half-time inury time, Brett Holman made it 3-0 via a header and this time off an aerial cross from Emerton. Tim Cahill put the result beyond any doubt midway during the second half with a textbook bullet header from Holman’s inch-perfect crossing free-kick.
