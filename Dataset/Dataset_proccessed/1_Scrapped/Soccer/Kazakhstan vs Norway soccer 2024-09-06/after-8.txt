OSLO, Norway — Norway captain Martin Odegaard has injured an ankle ahead of a key series of games for his club Arsenal. Odegaard covered his face with his hands while being treated before limping off in the second half of a Nations League game against Austria in Oslo on Monday. He turned his left ankle awkwardly in a tough challenge with Austria midfielder Christoph Baumgartner. Arsenal faces three tough away games in eight days: At Tottenham, in the Champions League at Atalanta, then at Manchester City.
