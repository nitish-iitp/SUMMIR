FOOTBALL
Serbia vs. England: Head-to-head record and past meetings
By Ben Knapton, Senior Reporter

The Veltins-Arena is the venue for England's eagerly-anticipated Euro 2024 opener on Sunday evening, as the Three Lions pit their wits against Serbia in Group C.

Gareth Southgate's men endeavour to go one better than their agonising runners-up finish three years ago, but they arrive in Germany with just one win under their belts from their last five matches across all tournaments.

Meanwhile, the Eagles - who finished second in their qualifying section behind Hungary - are competing at the European Championships for the first time as an independent nation, and Sunday's game will also mark an inaugural contest of sorts for Dragan Stojkovic's team.

Here, Sports Mole takes an in-depth look at the head-to-head record and previous meetings between the two sides.

Head-to-head record

Previous meetings: 15*
Serbia wins: 6
Draws: 5
England wins: 4

* = as Serbia and Montenegro/Yugoslavia

As it has been 21 years since England last crossed paths with an iteration of Serbia - who did not regain their independent status again until 2006 - the Three Lions will be facing the Eagles for the first time since the end of their opponents' respective unions.

In June 2003, England would pit their wits against Serbia and Montenegro in a friendly contest at the King Power Stadium - then known as the Walkers Stadium - in Leicester, a game in which now-Three Lions head coach Gareth Southgate started as a defender.

On that occasion, Sven-Goran Eriksson oversaw a 2-1 victory thanks to strikes from Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole, but during the days of Yugoslavia, there was little to separate the two nations in the head-to-head column.

Indeed, England earned five wins and five draws while suffering four defeats against Yugoslavia - which also encompassed Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina - although one of those losses came in perhaps their most famous meeting.

The four-team Euro 1968 tournament saw England and Yugoslavia lock horns in the semi-finals, and the Three Lions succumbed to a 1-0 loss thanks to a strike from Dragan Dzajic, before Yugoslavia fell to defeat against Italy in a final replay.

However, that semi-final reverse remains the last time that England came up short against Serbia/Yugoslavia, as they are now on a four-match winning sequence against Sunday's opponents, having also triumphed in a pair of Euro 1988 qualification matches.

Prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia, Sir Bobby Robson also masterminded a 2-1 friendly victory in 1989, where Bryan Robson scored a brace and Stojkovic - now in charge of Serbia - started in midfield.

The most emphatic victory in this particular matchup belongs to Yugoslavia, who thrashed Walter Winterbottom's Three Lions 5-0 in a 1958 exhibition contest, the same margin they lost to the Netherlands to (6-1) in their Euro 2000 quarter-final, their most recent appearance at the quadrennial event.
