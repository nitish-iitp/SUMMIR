The midfielder Dimitrios Pelkas has said Greece did not want to play their Nations League game against England after the death of George Baldock but forced themselves to win in his honour.

Baldock, a former Sheffield United defender, died at the age of 31 from drowning in his swimming pool in Athens. He won 12 caps for Greece, after being eligible to represent them through a grandmother, and was last involved in their squad for the Euro 2024 playoff defeat by Georgia.

Greece paid tribute to their teammate after they beat England for the first time with a stunning 2-1 victory at Wembley, Vangelis Pavlidis scoring a winner in stoppage-time.

Pelkas, who came off the bench, said his side did not want to play but could not postpone the game because there was no room in the calendar to rearrange.

“It is like this, rules are rules, Uefa don’t have another opportunity to play this game, so we played today,” he said. “We give this win to him. When these things happen in life, football is the second part. The most important thing is that our friend George passed away.

“We will never forget him, I was sure today that he would be with us from upstairs and he would celebrate with us and force us to take this victory. I don’t want to speak about football. Yesterday was very hard for all of us, we couldn’t speak, we couldn’t laugh, we couldn’t eat in the hotel.

“It was a really hard day. I want to send my condolences to his family, for them it is the most difficult period. It was really difficult, it was one of us, he was an excellent guy, it is like he was with us from a very young age.”

Uefa has been contacted for comment.
