Jorn Andersen plans to field his strongest 11 when Hong Kong complete their AFC Asian Cup finals preparations against Saudi Arabia next week, after a much-changed side lost to Tajikistan in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.

Head coach Andersen called the 2-1 defeat behind closed doors a valuable “learning experience” after retaining only four players from the team who on Monday earned Hong Kong’s first victory over China in 29 years.

Everton Camargo, one of the quartet starting successive matches, scored Hong Kong’s goal. The forward struck left-footed from distance after 33 minutes, following a 25th-minute opener from Tajikistan attacker Rustam Soirov.

Tajikistan – 106th in the latest Fifa rankings to Hong Kong’s 150th – restored their advantage with a goal from Shahrom Samiev six minutes after half-time.

Hong Kong have now scored in eight of their past 10 fixtures including practice matches, following an infusion of fresh attacking blood, to leave Andersen looking forward with confidence.
