I see garmin voids warranty if you mount the xero

Anyone have firsthand knowledge of failures of any kind ?

I feel like Garmin is trying to have it both ways on that issue.

Might want to tell Area419. They were one of the first to advertise the Garmin and made a mount for it to hook to the rifle.

I decided not to mount mine, especially since I shoot some larger calibers. After a year of them being beat to shit with no problems, I may reevaluate.

hence my point about having it both ways.

Can I Use the Xero C1 Pro Chronograph Mounted to a Rifle?​
While Garmin did not specifically design or test the use of this product to be mounted to a rifle, aftermarket manufacturers have tested the device mounted to a variety of rifle calibers and the Xero® C1 Pro chronograph has worked without issue. Garmin does not warranty the product when used in a manner outside of the design content.

Outside of you explicitly stating it was used on a rifle and broke, how would they know?

I guess if all units returned for warranty work had the same issue or broke in the same manner, they could insinuate that they were being used in a specific way (ie mounted on a rifle). But outside of it being stated, or until there’s an obvious trend, I’m not sure how they could decipher recoil vs “it just stopped working.”

Area419 had the garmin in house months before release, and were advertising it with their mount. All of this was with Garmin seeing this. If Garmin expected it to be an issue, it's pretty likely they would have advised 419 not to do this.

And if a big boy company like Garmin is selling these for a wholesale price that makes $600 retail possible, they likely aren't going to care too much about sending out a replacement here and there.

I'm curious to know if anyone has had issues with theirs or direct knowledge of an issue. I've seen a few folks on Facebook groups say they've had issues with missing shots.

No misses in about 200 rounds so far, moving back and forth between rifles and not to careful on the placement. A few times when it kind of spun and said something like analysing shot.

Garmin's chief engineer on the project shoots big ELR calibers and mounted it to his rifle during development. He has had no issues since the development pre-covid. He publicly stated so on the Shooter's Mindset podcast.

Y'all realize that lawyers write 99% of the warranty/terms & conditions of everything you buy? Right?

They could not give a fuck less about what any of you think or what any aftermarket gizmo maker does for their products. Their only sole purpose in life is to minimize risk/exposure/loss for their employer.

Had you been patient Burt, and bought it thru BestBuy you could have added the geek squad insurance.

But no you couldn’t wait.

I’ve been running my Xero, trying to see any real flaws or failures with it. From my perspective, it’s been fucking incredible.

Brought out a couple of my son’s Nerf guns. Registered every single shot.

Brought out two of his gel bead blasters. Sure as shit, registered every shot and didn’t even have to manipulate its position in relation to the muzzle.

After using Labradars and Magneto’s, there is no comparison. This thing just dominates in every regard.

My Xero started acting up. Weird data, missed shots.

One day it wouldn’t turn on. So I left it there and continued shooting.

Then, it started making fun of the Labradar of the guy next to me.

Swearing and shit.

Labradar started talking smack back so next thing I know the Garmin shoots a laser through the LR’s circuit board.

Stay far away from the Xero, boys. It’ll steal your wife and get your daughter pregnant too.

(I  the thing!)

When gun mounted I seem to miss a significant (~10%) number of shots. I’m chalking that up to recoil or pre-shot movement, but interested if anyone else has some data points? Sitting next to the gun, no dropped shots yet.

If there are any barricades, walls, boards, or things blocking the radar beam in front of your muzzle, this can cause it not to register a shot. They say you need 50 feet minimum open in front of the radar for it to properly detect a shot. Don’t know if this helps, but I’ve tested it, and it’s true.

That’s good info to know! Good looking out.
