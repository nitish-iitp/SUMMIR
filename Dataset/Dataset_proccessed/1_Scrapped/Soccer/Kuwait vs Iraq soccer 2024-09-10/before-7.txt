Sharjah 24: Sharjah Men's Basketball Team secured their first victory in the opening of the 5th Sharjah International Basketball Championship, defeating Saudi Arabia's Al-Fateh with a score of 94-87. The match, held Thursday evening at Al-Batayeh Cultural and Sports Club, went into two overtimes to decide the result in the first round of Group B.
Sharjah will face Lebanon’s Hoops next Friday to determine the group leader. This edition of the championship is played in three stages, starting with a single round-robin group stage to determine rankings. The top team from each group will advance directly to the semifinals, while the second and third-placed teams will compete for the remaining semifinal spots. The two winners will move to the final, while the losers will compete for positions three to six. Group A includes Al-Batayeh (UAE), Al-Arabi (Kuwait), and Dijla University (Iraq).

Sharjah, the defending champion, has won the title twice before. They first claimed victory against Egypt’s Al-Jazeera in the second edition in February 2014, and their second win was last season against Lebanon’s Antonine in March 2023.

The tournament, organised by the Sharjah Sports Council in collaboration with JAM Club, is being held from September 5 to 10 at Al-Batayeh Cultural and Sports Club, with six clubs from five countries: UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon.
