Thousands of Iraqi football fans are converging on Kuwait to watch a World Cup qualifying match, the first time they have been permitted to do so since Saddam Hussein invaded the emirate 34 years ago.

The influx of fans illustrates gradually improving relations between the two nations, despite enduring sensitivities and some controversy surrounding the match's arrangements. 'I can't explain how I feel,' said Abbas Abdelatif, a middle-aged Iraqi from Basra.

The game is being held at Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium, with Iraq leading Group B of the Asian Football Confederation's qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. The football event is seen as a step toward repairing relations with Arab Gulf states after years of conflict.
