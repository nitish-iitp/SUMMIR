All football fans and supporters are following all the matches related to the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, as many are waiting for the final result of these qualifiers, because they will determine the 45 teams that will belong to the host countries (Mexico, Canada, and the United States of America), and these qualifiers began on September 7, 2023 and will end in March 2026, and the participants in these qualifiers are 211 teams, and in the following lines we will explain to you everything related to this topic in detail.

2026 World Cup Qualifiers

The following will explain to you the new 2026 World Cup qualifiers system for this season, which the FIFA Executive Committee announced on May 19, 2023, dividing all teams into only nine groups, each group containing 6 teams. This is due to the increase in the number of teams participating in the World Cup, as their number reached 48 teams compared to the previous season, which was 32 teams. The leaders of their groups will qualify directly for the 2026 World Cup, while the best four runners-up in their groups in the play-offs to determine the team that will qualify will participate in the World Cup qualifiers between the federations.

The group stage will be played over two legs, and the group leaders will qualify for the 2026 World Cup.

While in the play-off stage, the best four runners-up will be drawn from the nine groups, to qualify for the African play-offs, and then determine which team represented the Confederation of African Football in the play-offs between the confederation.
