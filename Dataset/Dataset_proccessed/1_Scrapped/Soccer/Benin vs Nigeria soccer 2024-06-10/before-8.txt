Showdown in Bamako as Sierra Leone eye second win
 June 9, 2024
 Alie Bittar @bittar32

Sierra Leone will face Burkina Faso at the Stade du 26 Mars in Group A of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers as both teams seek their second win.

The Stallions of Burkina Faso recently lost 2-1 to Egypt, so they will surely be looking for a win against Sierra Leone. The Leone Stars of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, registered their first 2-1 victory over Djibouti in Matchday three of the qualifiers.

Coach Amidu Karim’s team needs to either win or avoid defeat against Burkina Faso to keep their World Cup hopes alive. A loss will significantly reduce the Leones Stars’ chances.

This upcoming match at the 26th of March Stadium will be the second meeting between the two West African nations, Sierra Leone and Burkina Faso last played each other almost 30 years ago.

Sierra Leone won with a score of 2-1, thanks to Mohamed Kallon’s winning goal at the 1996 Nations Cup in South Africa. Now, both teams are set to meet again in Bamako for the 2026 World Cup qualifying match. What will the outcome be this time?

Burkina Faso is coming off a defeat to Egypt but started their World Cup qualifying journey with a draw against Guinea-Bissau and a victory over Ethiopia.

On the other hand, Sierra Leone’s recent 2-1 win against Djibouti brought an end to their four-match winless run.

This victory has moved Sierra Leone to fourth place in the group standings, just behind Burkina Faso on goal difference.

Despite the recent defeat, Traore was a standout performer for Burkina Faso against Egypt, and he is expected to lead the attack again.
