The spoils are equally shared in the fixture

Malaysia and Chinese Taipei clash at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, looking to make one final effort in their hopes of reaching the third round. With seven points in the bag from five games, Malaysia are currently third in Group D, three points behind second-placed Kyrgyzstan.

They must win their last qualifying game of the round, and hope that Kyrgyzstan lose to Oman in the other clash.

However, in eight official games this year, Malaysia have won just once: a 5-1 friendly win over Nepal back in March. Their last qualifier win, however, came in November 2023, when Kim Pan-gon's side beat Chinese Taipei 1-0 away from home.

Ranked 159th in the world, the Blue Wings have lost all five qualifying matches of the second round, including a 3-0 defeat to Oman on Wednesday. Without a single point in the bag, they are at the bottom of Group D but have secured their place for the next round of the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers.
