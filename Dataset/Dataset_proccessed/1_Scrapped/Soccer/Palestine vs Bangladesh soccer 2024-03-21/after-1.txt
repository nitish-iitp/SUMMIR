⚽ The Bangladesh national football team is set to face a formidable Palestine side in their away group match of the FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifiers. The match is scheduled to take place on early Friday at the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium in Kuwait, with kickoff at 12:30 am (BST). Bangladesh skipper Jamal Bhuyan, in a video message on Wednesday, expressed the team's determination to secure a good result against Palestine, acknowledging the strength of their opponents.

💬 Bangladesh head coach Javier Cabrera expressed satisfaction with the team's preparation in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, stating that everything has been going according to plan. Cabrera acknowledged Palestine's physical superiority but remained confident in his team's ability to minimize the difference and put up a strong fight. "Palestine is a very strong team as they also fought very hard against Australia losing the match 0-1 in the qualifiers. Palestine has very positive results in the Asian Cup with UAE, Hong Kong and Qatar," said Cabrera.

🥅 In preparation for the World Cup Qualifier match, Bangladesh underwent a two-week training camp at the King Fahd Sports City Stadium in Saudi Arabia before traveling to Kuwait. The team also played two preparatory matches against Sudan, drawing the first match goalless and suffering a 0-3 defeat in the second. Bangladesh had previously played two World Cup Qualifier matches last year, losing 0-7 to Australia in an away match and drawing 1-1 with Lebanon at home.

The thing is ...I have this feeling for the greater good , it should be Palestine, their cause is important right now and their players need every bit of money to support their families in Gaza ...as for Bangladesh 😢they would disappoint us in the long game anyway
