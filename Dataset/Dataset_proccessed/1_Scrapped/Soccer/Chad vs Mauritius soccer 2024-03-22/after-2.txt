MEETING AGAIN TODAY—Malawi and Morocco

By Mabvuto Kambuwe in Durban, South Africa:

Malawi Beach Soccer National Team has a score to settle with Morocco in a semi-final match of this year’s Cosafa Beach Soccer Championship at South Beach Arena in Durban, South Africa, this afternoon.

The two teams last met at the 2022 Beach Soccer Africa Cup of Nations finals in Vilankulo, Mozambique, with Morocco winning 7-3.

It is expected to be a David vs Goliath affair as there is a big gulf in terms of class and quality between the two teams with Morocco investing a lot in the game over the past two years. The North Africans are currently the number one team on the continent in beach soccer.

However, there is renewed hope in the Malawi camp ahead of the showdown.

Coach Willy Kumilambe said he has high hopes that his troops will reach the final.

’’Let Morocco underrate us at their own peril. We are here on a serious mission. We suffered a setback when we lost to Saudi Arabia but the players showed great character to demolish Seychelles. That was a big statement about what we can do,’’ Kumilambe said.

In all the three group stage matches, Malawi were guilty of missing clear-cut chances.

But Kumilambe said he has done his homework.

’’We have rectified all the mistakes we identified during the group stage. It will be a different ball game against Morocco and the players are ready to cause a big upset,’’ he said.

Interestingly, no team is unbeaten at this year’s tournament.

Malawi’s only dent in the competition was a 5-1 loss to Saudi Arabia whereas Morocco suffered a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Angola.

Captain Isaac Kajamu, who has scored four goals at the tournament, echoed Kumilambe’s sentiments.

“As players, we are indeed determined to cause a big upset. This is our chance to show Morocco that we are a good team. The loss to Morocco in Mozambique is still haunting us and we will go flat out to get the result,’’ Kajamu said.

Malawi beat South Africa and Seychelles 4-2 and 7-2, respectively, to advance to the last four after finishing second in Group A with six points from three matches, behind Saudi Arabia on goal difference.

Malawi are eyeing a second appearance in the final of the championship after finishing as runners-up in 2015 when they lost 9-4 to Madagascar.

In another semi-final, Saudi Arabia will meet Mozambique at the same venue later today.
