Summary: Goodwin inspires comfortable win

“A clinic in Canberra”. That’s how the Socceroos’ social media account has described tonight’s game. I wouldn’t go quite that far but it was one of the better attacking performances of the last couple of years, with some exciting glimpses of the future. A record crowd of 25,023 should go home sated.

2 min Kusini Yengi scored his first international goal from a magnificent Craig Goodwin cross

47 min Bassel Jradi scored an unfortunate own goal after Harry Souttar’s header was saved

48 min Goodwin waved a superb third from the edge of the area

68 min The debutant Patrick Yazbek made a first international goal for John Iredale, who had just come on

81 min Goodwin tapped in his second after good play from Iredale on the right.

John Iredale’s reaction

It means the world to me personally, and to the boys. We set out to score more goals tonight and we’re pleased we did that.

It’s really special when you come from the same youth team [as Patrick Yazbek] to share a goal and assist. As soon as I saw him charging down the left I knew I had to get in the box.

Craig Goodwin’s got an unbelievable left foot, and having him in the squad really boosts our quality. I was really pleased to help him get his second goal.

“From the snippets I’ve seen that was pretty prosaic...” says Chris Paraskevas. “You can feel Arnie’s grip on the job loosening post Asian Cup. His body language is more tetchy than usual. Something isn’t quite right at the moment, a sense that things have become unsettled.

“Fine margins. I really think his tenure will be defined by a 15-minute spell against Korea (and possibly a more positive 15-minute spell against Argentina. As much as this is a PR boost and a ‘good night’ for Football Australia... it’s not enough to start turning the tide of public opinion.”

I wonder whether football fans expect more/too much these days, or whether we are just more exposed to complaints. I’ve no idea. But given that watching sport is something we love, we do spent an awful lot of time in a state of dissatisfaction. I don’t say that critically by the way; I’ve been a horribly entitled brat in the past.

Full time: Lebanon 0-5 Australia

The Socceroos are into the third round of World Cup qualification with a couple of games to spare. An emphatic win over Lebanon was a celebration of both the present and future. Craig Goodwin flaunted his educated left foot, making the first goal and scoring two – the first a beauty – in the second half.

There were also first international goals for Kusini Yengi and John Iredale, as well as assists for Iredale and the debutant Patrick Yazbek. All in all, it was a good night for Graham Arnold.

Goody at the double! ⚽⚽@craig_goodwin11 nets a brace upon his return to the side 🔥

GOAL! Lebanon 0-5 Australia (Goodwin 81)

The celebration of Craig Goodwin continues with his second goal of the night. Jones played a simple ball down the right to Iredale, who made a nice run into space and crossed low into the middle. Shour, stretching towards his own goal, could only divert the ball across the six-yard box to Goodwin. The rest was a formality.

Iredale sped away from Sharafeddine at the far post and swept the ball into the empty net.

Khalil Khamis was booked just before that, I think for dissent.

64 min Metcalfe plays in the overlapping Jones, whose cross is headed over from eight yards by Duke. It was slightly too high.

Just before that, there was an appeal for a penalty when the ball hit Bitar’s hand. It deflected off his chest, though, so it was the correct decision.

60 min “The game will take care of itself,” says Martin Turnbull, “but a bit of a bugbear of mine – Arnold with his hand over the heart during the anthem. Might be getting long in the tooth but despise creeping Americanisms. Teams going on o-fence and d-fence, which is also happening in the footy. Anyway, let’s get five.”

I can’t speak for Graham Arnold but I do wonder how often gestures like that are a sad (I use that word in the truest sense, while looking in the mirror) attempt to embrace a modern world that the person doesn’t truly understand. I’m not looking forward to growing old and doddery in a post-empathy world.

54 min The more replays you see, the more you realise Tniech should have been sent off for that tackle on Hrustic. It was born of frustration rather than malevolence but it was still dangerous. And it has done a lot of damage: Hrustic is being helped off by two physios, moving very gingerly.

Waved away but he's being carried off by the trainers, unable to support his own weight on his left leg. #LBNvAUS https://t.co/T5AUkmBCwA

Half time: Lebanon 0-1 Australia

Australia lead in Canberra. The first half was essentially an ode to the left foot of Craig Goodwin. His unplayable cross set up Kusini Yengi’s early goal, Yengi’s first for the Socceroos, and an equally delicious ball was headed against the post by Harry Souttar just before half-time.

Lebanon had some promising moments, usually when their captain Hassan Maatouk was on the ball, but Maty Ryan didn’t have a save to make. Australia are in control and heading for the third round of qualification.

Made in Adelaide. Converted in Canberra.@yengikusini ⚽

It curved onto the head of Souttar, whose downward header from six yards hit the post. For a goal machine like Souttar, that was a great chance.
