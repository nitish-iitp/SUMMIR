The Dubai Barça Academy is notable for its extraordinary cultural diversity and international representation as it features players from around the world. Dubai is the place where borders are diluted, opening the way for tolerability towards different cultures and cooperation.

With 107 players from 28 different countries, it is a clear example of Barça's global reach. The United States of America leads the way with 12 representatives, followed by Egypt with 10 and Canada with 9. There are also students from countries such as France, Lebanon, Iran, the United Kingdom, Jordan, Australia, Turkey, Spain, the Netherlands, India... all adding to the diversity and very wide-ranging cultural mosaic.

A global Barça

This richness of diversity adds to the academic and sporting learning for the boys and girls, but it also helps promote sport as a global culture through a passion for football. It is a multicultural setting that enriches the educational experience and promotes values such as inclusivity, respect and understanding towards other cultures and ways of understanding life.

Barça is more than a club, and the international spread of football has been essential in consolidating the team in terms of international prestige. By creating different academies and through international collaborations, Barça has left its mark around the world and become established as an influential institution in the world, where children want to come and be involved in a unique playing style.
