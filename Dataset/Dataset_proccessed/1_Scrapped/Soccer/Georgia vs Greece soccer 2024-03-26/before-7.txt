Details:

The City of Luxembourg (Ville de Luxembourg – VdL) is organising a live broadcast on a giant LED screen (23 m2) of the Georgia-Luxembourg play-off match which will take place from 18:00 on Thursday 21 March 2024 at Place Guillaume II.

The match will kick off at 21:00 (local time at the Boris-Paichadze Stadium in Tbilisi with a capacity of some 54,000 spectators), i.e. at 18:00 in Luxembourg. Catering with grills and drinks will be available on-site from 17:00 to 22:00, providing a lively atmosphere for football fans. Admission is free.

In the spirit of sustainability, the VdL encouraged spectators to use public transport when attending the event.

The outcome of this play-off match is important for Luxembourg's football team. If Luc Holtz's Rout Léiwen emerge victorious in Tbilisi on Thursday 21 March, they will advance to the decisive match for participation in UEFA EURO 2024. This game would then take place on Tuesday 26 March, at the Stade de Luxembourg, where they would face the winner of the other semi-final match in Group C of the qualifying play-offs, between Greece and Kazakhstan.

However, should the Luxembourg team lose in the match on Thursday, they will still have an opportunity to continue their journey. In this scenario, they will compete against the loser of the other "play-off, path C" match in an international friendly match on Tuesday 26 March 2024, also at the Stade de Luxembourg.
