Preview: Rwanda vs. Nigeria - prediction, team news, lineups

Nigeria will travel to Rwanda for the second round of their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series after opening their campaign with a victory last weekend.

The Super Eagles comfortably defeated Benin in their opening match of the qualifying series, while the Wasps salvaged a draw against Libya.

Rwanda have only appeared in the AFCON once in their history, in Tunisia 2004 when they failed to progress beyond the group stage after one win, draw and defeat each.

The Wasps began their journey to qualify for the 2025 edition with a 1-1 draw against Libya in Tripoli last Wednesday - Sobi Al Dawi gave the hosts the lead in the 16th minute, but Innocent Nshuti equalised for Torsten Spittler's side early in the second half.

The Wasps, now unbeaten in their last two matches, will face Nigeria looking to continue their fine form under Spittler - since the German took charge of the team in November, they have lost just once, winning and drawing three each in seven matches.

However, his next challenge will be helping Rwanda record a first victory against Tuesday's opponents, as they have failed to win any of their five previous meetings.

Augustine Eguavoen began his reign as interim boss of the Super Eagles with a convincing 3-0 victory over Benin at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium last Saturday.

Fresh from his Ballon d'Or nomination, Atalanta forward, Ademola Lookman, put Nigeria ahead with a brilliant solo goal just before half time.

Galatasaray's new man, Victor Osimhen doubled the lead in the 78th minute with a one-time finish from a cross, before Lookman headed in his second of the game in the 83rd minute to seal the victory.

The victory ended a run of three matches without a win for the Super Eagles and has put them top of Group D heading into the game against Rwanda on Tuesday.

It will be the sixth meeting between both sides, but the Super Eagles have the upper hand with two wins and three draws, including two in the AFCON qualifiers played in 2012 when the visitors drew away and won at home.

Twenty-six-year-old forward Nshuti scored his fourth goal for Rwanda in 18 caps, and he is expected to lead the line once again.

Right-back Fitina Omborenga has 63 caps, making him the sixth most-capped player for the Wasps, one cap away from being joint-fifth, and he is expected to achieve this on Tuesday.

Reigning African Player of the Year, Osimhen, came off the bench to find the net for Nigeria last time out, and he is likely to play from the start in this clash.

Lookman, who was named man of the match against Benin after his brace, will support Osimhen while Samuel Chukwueze is expected to complete the front three after a fine showing last Saturday.

Lazio midfielder Fisayo Dele-Bashiru is also in contention for a starting place after his fine cameo against Benin.


Rwanda possible starting lineup:
Ntwari; Omborenga, Mutsinzi, Manzi, Niyomugabo; Rebangouka, Bizimana; G. Mugisha, Muhire, Kwizera; Nshuti

Nigeria possible starting lineup:
Nwabali; Ekong, Ajayi, Bassey; Aina, Ndidi, Iwobi, Onyemaechi; Lookman, Osimhen, Chukwueze



We say: Rwanda 1-2 Nigeria

Nigeria looked like a solid side again following a change in leadership and the return of key team members. Although Rwanda's form makes this a challenging fixture for the visitors, we anticipate that the visitors will ultimately prevail.
