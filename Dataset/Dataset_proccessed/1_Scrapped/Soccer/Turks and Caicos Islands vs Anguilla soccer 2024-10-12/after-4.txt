Back in August, once teams were finally able to start live tackling and hitting in practice, Summit’s Connor Conneely dislocated his left elbow so severely that he had to be sedated to pop it back in place. He then missed the first four games of the season.

The junior safety, playing in his second game of the season, made his presence felt with a pair of interceptions and a fumble recovery in the Storm’s 21-6 win over previously undefeated Bend High Friday night.
