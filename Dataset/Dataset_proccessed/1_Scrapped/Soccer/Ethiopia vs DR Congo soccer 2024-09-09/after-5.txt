The match will take place at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Ethiopia drew 0-0 with Tanzania in their Group H opener maintaining their unbeaten run of four matches.

One of their players, Abinet Demise, missed training due to illness, while Gezahegn returned to light training.

DR Congo won 1-0 against Guinea in their first Group H match. The Leopards extended their unbeaten run to four games, with two wins and two draws, including one against South Africa.

Congo head coach Sebastien Desabre mentioned the need to improve the link between midfield and attack and expressed satisfaction with the team’s control during the match.
