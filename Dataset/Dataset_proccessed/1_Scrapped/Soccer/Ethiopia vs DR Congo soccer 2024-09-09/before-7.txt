The second round of matches in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers sees Ethiopia entertain the challenge of Congo DR at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium on Monday evening.
 
Ethiopia had to make do with a share of the spoils in their opening outing against Tanzania, while Congo DR just about saw off the threat of Guinea to make a winning start.

Congo DR showed great mettle to grind out a hard-fought 1-0 triumph over the National Elephants of Guinea and secure maximum points at Stade des Martrys in Kinshasa on Friday.
 
Boasting three strikes in four league matches already this term, Edo Kayembe carried over his hot streak in front of goal to the international scene as he netted a 27th-minute winner to get the job done for Sebastien Desabre's men.
 
Since their AFCON exit to South Africa earlier this year, Les Leopards are now unbeaten in the subsequent three involvements and will head into Monday's affair on a run of two straight wins without conceding.
 
Victory in Dar es Salaam would see Congo DR take control of proceedings in Group H before October's double-header against Tanzania, but their away form has been dodgy of late, with only one win on enemy territory dating back to June 2023.

Ethiopia's attacking struggles came to the fore once again in their goalless stalemate versus Tanzania on Wednesday, which saw them fail to find the back of the net for a fifth time in the last eight matches.
 
More worryingly for Gebremedhin Haile's men, they failed to muster an attempt on target over the course of the 90 minutes despite boasting the larger share of the ball possession in a drab affair.
 
However, the Walia Ibex did manage to come away with a rare positive, keeping a second clean sheet in three outings off the back of just one from their five matches across all competitions prior.
 
Having missed out on the last AFCON edition, Ethiopia will be keen to get their qualifying journey up and running at the second time of asking to avoid being left too far behind in the race to secure a spot at the continental showpiece.
 
Standing in the way is an opposing outfit who claimed a thrilling 3-2 extra-time victory in the sides' only previous encounter—a semi-final tie at the 1968 Africa Cup of Nations—en route to going all the way.

Defender Chancel Mbemba recorded his 86th cap last time out, moving him five clear of Issama Mpeko at the top of Congo DR's all-time appearances chart.
 
Noah Sadiki was handed an international debut against Guinea, and the midfielder will now be targeting his first senior start since switching allegiance from Belgium.
 
Edo Kayembe has found his shooting boots this term with four goals for club and country already, making the 26-year-old one to look out for.

Ethiopia's chances of naming an unchanged lineup from the draw against Tanzania took a huge blow when Wogene Gezahegn was hauled off with an injury scare in stoppage time.
 
With such a short turnover between the games, Gezahegn is not expected to feature right from the off on Monday, and Biniam Ayten is poised to come into the XI.


Ethiopia possible starting lineup:
Habtamu; Moges, Baye, Kasa, Berhane; Waza, Panom; Gugsa, Ayten, Belay; Markneh

Congo DR possible starting lineup:
Bertaud; Tuanzebe, Mbemba, Inonga, Masuaku; Moutoussamy, Pickel; Bongonda, Kayembe, Wissa; Essende




We say: Ethiopia 0-1 Congo DR

Goals have been few and far between for both teams of late, and we can see that translating into a low-scoring affair here.

That said, we are also backing Congo DR to pip their hosts to all three points in the end.
