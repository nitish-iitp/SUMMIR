DR Congo are looking for their second consecutive qualifier win (PC: Getty Images)

Ethiopia and DR Congo lock horns at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Monday for their second game of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

Ranked 143rd in the world, Ethiopia are looking to make their AFCON return after missing out on this year's showpiece in Ivory Coast. But their campaign began on a rather somber note, as Tanzania held them to a 0-0 draw earlier this week.

The Walia Ibex had eight shots in the game, but none on target, despite having 53% of possession, which is a reflection of their toothless display on the night. Head coach Gebremedhin Haile is certain to make a few changes to his lineup here.

On the other hand, DR Congo had no upsets in their first game, overcoming Guinea in a narrow 1-0 victory. Edouard Kayembe struck the only goal of the game in the 27th minute as the Leopards kept out their rivals for the remainder of the match to seal all three points.

They now sit atop Group H with three points, with Ethiopia in second place with one.

Ethiopia vs DR Congo Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been six clashes between the sides in history, with DR Congo winning four times over Ethiopia and losing just once.
Ethiopia's only ever win over DR Congo came back in June 2007, when the Walia Ibex beat the Leopards 1-0 in the AFCON qualifiers.
DR Congo and Ethiopia lock horns for the first time since January 2016, when the Leopards beat the Walia Ibex 3-0 at the AFCON competition.
After going three games without a win, DR Congo have won their next two: a pair of 1-0 wins over Togo (in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers) and Guinea (in the 2025 AFCON qualifiers).
Ethiopia have drawn their last three official clashes.
Ethiopia vs DR Congo Prediction

DR Congo are on a good run of form, winning their last two official games. They've also been sturdy in defense, not letting their opponents have many chances. Ethiopia could also struggle to create anything meaningful, and we expect them to suffer a loss in this game.

Prediction: Ethiopia 0-2 DR Congo
