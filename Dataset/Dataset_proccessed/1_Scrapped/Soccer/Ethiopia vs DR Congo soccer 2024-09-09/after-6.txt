DR Congo secured a 2-0 win over Ethiopia in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualification Group H match at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on Monday night.




As a result, Leopards moved to the top of the Group H standings having won their first two matches, while Walia Ibex are placed third in the table having picked up one point in their first two games in the qualifiers.




The Leopards started the match brightly and they created the first real chance of the game in the seventh minute, but Samuel Essende was denied by well-positioned goalkeeper Seid Habtamu.




Walia Ibex grew gradually into the match and coach Sebastien Desabre decided to make a tactical change – pulling out Chadrac Akolo, and introducing Theo Bongonda in the 33rd minute. The score was 0-0 at half-time.




Bongonda proved to be an inspired substitute 17 minutes into the second-half as the dreadlocked attacker turned home a long ball from Joris Kayembe to hand Congo a 1-0 lead with Habtamu well-beaten.




DR Congo’s 2-0 victory was sealed by another inspired substitute, Fiston Mayele who beat Habtamu with a good finish in the 76th minute with the creative Meschack Elia providing the assist.
