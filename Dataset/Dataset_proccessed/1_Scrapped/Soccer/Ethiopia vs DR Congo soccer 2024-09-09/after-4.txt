DR Congo emerged as 2-0 winners over Ethiopia in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualification Group H match at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on Monday night.

The convincing victory saw the Leopards climb to the top of the Group H standings having won their first two matches. Congo will take on Tanzania home and away when the qualifiers resume in October 2024.

Walia Ibex, on the other hand, were left to lick their wounds after recording another defeat which leaves them placed third in the Group H standings. Ethiopia will face Guinea home and away next month.

The Leopards started the match brightly and they created the first real chance of the game in the seventh minute, but Samuel Essende was denied by well-positioned goalkeeper Seid Habtamu.

Walia Ibex grew gradually into the match and coach Sebastien Desabre decided to make a tactical change - pulling out Chadrac Akolo, and introducing Theo Bongonda in the 33rd minute. The score was 0-0 at halftime.

Bongonda proved to be an inspired substitute 17 minutes into the second-half as the dreadlocked attacker turned home a long ball from Joris Kayembe to hand Congo a 1-0 lead with Habtamu well-beaten.

DR Congo's 2-0 victory was sealed by another inspired substitute, Fiston Mayele who beat Habtamu with a good finish in the 76th minute with the creative Meschack Elia providing the assist.

Ethiopia 0

DR Congo 2 (Bongonda 62', Mayele 76')

ETHIOPIA: Habtamu, Kasa, Hamid (Biniam 77'), Baye, Moges, Panom, Waza (Demissie 64'), Berhane, Dagnachew (Wondimu 83'), Gugsa (Belay 64'), Markneh
