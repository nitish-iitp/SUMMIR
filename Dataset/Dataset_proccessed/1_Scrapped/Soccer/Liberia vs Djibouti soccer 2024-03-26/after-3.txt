Health science professor Debra Sutton created HTH 100, an entry-level health course, when she first arrived at JMU in the early ’90s and when the university was looking to restructure its general education program. Sutton said wellness classes had been common electives for a long time at universities, but they were not usually general education courses. 

And there’s another difference between JMU’s HTH 100 class compared to those of other universities: the passport event course assignment, which has existed now for about 27 years. Sutton was inspired to create the assignment after reading a flier that outlined different wellness programs and the multi-dimensional model of wellness used as the foundation of passport event requirements today.

As of now, there are six dimensions for the assignment: intellectual, emotional, social, occupational, spiritual and environmental. Students enrolled in HTH 100 are required to attend four events that relate to four distinct dimensions — they can find these events, as well as which dimensions they fulfill, on the HTH 100 webpage. 

Wellness passport coordinator Sherri Wilson said passport events are “an experiential education activity,” an opportunity for students to be connected to resources on campus, to engage with new and old interests and to form relationships. 

Freshman media arts and design major Kaileigh Atkinson took HTH 100 last semester and said she most enjoyed a cooking passport event. She said she enjoys watching cooking and baking shows and doing it herself, but she hasn’t had many chances to before the event. The passport class introduced Atkinson to the existence of the University Recreation Center’s (UREC) cooking events and inspired her to apply to work there.

Atkinson said she signed up for a cooking event — the most popular kind of event, Sutton and Wilson said — about 2-3 weeks ahead of time. She also said she signed up for a tie-dye event, another she said she enjoyed, nearly a month before it. Overall, though, Atkinson describes her experience of passport events as “neutral” instead of positive because of one event she chose at the last minute that she didn’t enjoy. 

Attendees of passport events must fill out a reflective form with their takeaways. Some students write about how they feel their time is wasted through their required attendance to the events.

Some take stronger stances against the passport assignment: Wilson said some students write on the forms they fill out after events, with one stating “this was a waste of my time.” She said she doesn’t take this personally — instead, she considers whether they chose an event too close to the due date, leading them to choose events they don’t find interesting. 

Sutton shared a similar sentiment. She said students have negative experiences with passport events when they wait until the last minute to complete them. When they do so, Sutton said, they end up attending events they’re not interested in.

Atkinson said she is the only person in her friend group who speaks positively about passport events; she said she “most definitely” hears people talking negatively about them. Atkinson said  finding events during the spring semester can be especially challenging — fall semester HTH 100 students already know about passport events and thus can sign up for their favorite ones, even though it’s not a class requirement for them. 

On the other hand, freshman architectural design major Hannah Cundiff said she’s glad to be taking HTH 100 in the spring. Cundiff is a part of the color guard and said her band friends who took HTH 100 last semester had trouble finding passport events to go to, as many are held from 11 a.m. to noon — when many have class — or in the evening, when band activities are often held. 

Cundiff said she was “dreading” the passport assignment at the beginning of the semester but has since changed her perspective. 

“A lot of them have very important life lessons,” she said. 

Furthermore, Sutton said students have met lifelong friends at passport events — and she said she knows this because they’ve written it on their forms. Sutton says she sees this “over and over again,” which Wilson echoed.  

“Across campus, there may be a misconception that it’s just an assignment, and it’s really much more than that,” Wilson said. 

Sutton pointed out that passport events count for 60 points out of 500-600 in HTH 100.

“I think students make more of a big deal out of this than they should,” Sutton said.
