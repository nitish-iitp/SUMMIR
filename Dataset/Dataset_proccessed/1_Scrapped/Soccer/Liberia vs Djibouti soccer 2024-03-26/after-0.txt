WILSONVILLE — Oregon high schools could soon be looking at stiffer penalties following ejections from athletic events, as well as some new varsity sports.

The Oregon School Activities Association’s delegate assembly — a group of school administrators featuring one representative from every athletic district in the state, as well as representatives from committees and other statewide athletic associations — is meeting on Monday, April 8, and the group will be tasked with discussing an increase in ejections since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the OSAA’s agenda for the meeting, the number of ejections hit all-time highs in boys soccer and football this season.

New high school sports?

In October 2023, the Oregon School Activities Association’s delegate assembly added boys volleyball as the state’s first “emerging activity,” giving boys volleyball organizers some time to set up an unofficial spring season, which is currently running around the state.

Early numbers indicate there are enough schools participating to reach the threshold that the OSAA needs to consider adding boys volleyball as a future varsity sport.

While boys volleyball is currently seeing success as an emerging activity, the delegate assembly will be getting a first reading on potentially adding girls flag football as an emerging activity, as well as an update on both boys and girls water polo (which could start as early as the 2024-25 school year).

The last time the OSAA added a sport was girls wrestling in April 2023, splitting wrestling from the co-ed distinction into both boys and girls wrestling. Prior to that, the last time the OSAA added a full sport was softball in 1979.

The OSAA has also discussed the potential of adding esports in the past, but that hasn’t been brought up in some time.
