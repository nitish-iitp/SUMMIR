Mexico Copa America squad: Ochoa, Lozano, Jimenez all miss out

Mexico stalwarts Guillermo Ochoa, Hirving ‘Chucky’ Lozano and Raul Jimenez have been left out of the side’s 26-man squad for the men’s Copa America this summer.

Goalkeeper Ochoa, 38, and forward Lozano, 28, were both included in the March squad for the CONCACAF Nations League and started in the 2-0 defeat by the U.S. in the final. Ochoa, Mexico’s third-highest appearance-maker (150) captained the side and he and Lozano played the full game.

Jimenez’s last call-up came in the previous international break last November and the 33-year-old has struggled with form and injury this season, seeing his minutes reduced at Fulham after the emergence of Rodrigo Muniz.

“We are two years away from our World Cup,” Mexico sporting director Duilo Davino said. “We have our spot secured and we want to take advantage of this great opportunity to not think about the immediacy of the result and project our path to 2026.”

Head coach Jaime Lozano added: “Having a range of players, the most important thing is to get to 2026 with the strongest possible national team.”

Mexico’s youthful squad has an average age of 25, with the midfield trio of West Ham’s Edson Alvarez, AEK Athen’s Orbelin Pineda and Cruz Azul’s Uriel Antuna the only players with more than 50 caps.

Mexico were disappointing at their last major tournament, exiting the 2022 World Cup at the group stage after finishing behind Argentina and Poland. Gerardo Martino left his role as head coach after the tournament, with his replacement Diego Cocca lasting only seven games before being sacked and Lozano given the job.

PSV winger Lozano, meanwhile, posted a message of support to Mexico’s young squad after his omission was announced.

“Whether I’m on the pitch or supporting from the sidelines, I have my national team jersey tattooed on me like a second skin,” the 70-cap man said in a statement on social media.

“Today, the honour falls to you. I’m sure we’ll see each other later, but in the meantime, tear it up and raise Mexico’s name high.”

Mexico’s first group game comes on June 22 against Jamaica, before facing Venezuela on June 26 and Ecuador four days later.
