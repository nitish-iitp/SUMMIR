Preview: Ecuador vs. Honduras - prediction, team news, lineups

Playing their final warm-up fixture ahead of the Copa America, Ecuador meet Honduras in Connecticut on Sunday evening.

After winning their previous Stateside friendly in midweek, La Tri now aim to round off preparations for South America's showpiece with another success.

Bouncing back from defeat to world champions Argentina three days earlier, Ecuador saw off the challenge of Bolivia on Thursday, with all-time top scorer Enner Valencia opening the scoring at Subaru Park in Pennsylvania.

That 3-1 victory should boost morale in the camp, after they had lost their second March friendly to Italy and then been beaten 1-0 by Lionel Scaloni's side in Chicago.

Head coach Felix Sanchez had previously led his squad to three wins and two draws from their opening six matches in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers, and El Tri are very much in the mix to take part at the global finals in 2026.

First, though, they are focused on another tournament held in the CONCACAF region, as their opening Copa America group game against Venezuela is scheduled for June 22.

Ranked 31st in the world by FIFA, Ecuador are not among the favourites to prevail in the US-hosted finals, but they will expect to emerge from Group B, where Mexico, Venezuela and Jamaica are their opponents.

While Ecuador have taken a break from traipsing towards World Cup 2026, Honduras recently played two qualifiers, ultimately seeking a fourth appearance at FIFA's main event.

Los Catrachos had been winless in four games and failed to qualify for the Copa America via a playoff, but putting nine goals past CONCACAF minnows Bermuda and Cuba certainly puts a more positive spin on things.

Reappointing Reinaldo Rueda in July of last year - the Colombian coach led Honduras to the 2010 World Cup - has yet to pay dividends, but they are now top of the Group A table and will expect to reach the final phase.

Amid a busy period on several fronts, next up will be another Nations League campaign, with the opening game pitching Rueda's men against Trinidad and Tobago in September.

Having shed several experienced players over the past few months, Honduras are undergoing a period of transition, and they have the chance to test themselves against tougher opponents this weekend.

After stars such as Piero Hincapie and Moises Caicedo were left on the bench last time out, both could start in Ecuador's final friendly before kicking off their Copa America campaign.

Teenage prodigy Kendry Paez - set to join Caicedo at Chelsea next year - and Brighton & Hove Albion's Jeremy Sarmiento are also contenders to start this time, should Felix Sanchez decide to rotate his resources.

It remains to be seen whether vastly experienced captain Enner Valencia, who has scored 41 goals in 85 international appearances, will be rested; if so, Union Saint-Gilloise striker Kevin Rodriguez may be handed an opportunity to impress up front.

Meanwhile, Honduras are captained by Almeria forward Anthony Lozano, and 'Choco' should spearhead the Central American side's front line at Rentschler Field.

Full-back Andy Najar won his 50th cap on Monday and will feature on the right of Reinaldo Rueda's preferred back four; Celtic's Luis Palma started both recent World Cup qualifiers on the left wing.


Ecuador possible starting lineup:
Dominguez; Hurtado, Porozo, Ordonez, Hincapie; Caicedo, Gruezo; Mena, Paez, Franco; Valencia

Honduras possible starting lineup:
Menjivar; Najar, Melendez, Decas, Rosales; Rodriguez, Flores, Alvarez, Palma; Ruiz; Lozano



We say: Ecuador 3-1 Honduras

There is a considerable gap in quality between these two nations, as Ecuador are among South America's top teams and Honduras failed to even qualify for a guest spot at the Copa America.

Though El Tri might decide to preserve some of their best players for the upcoming tournament, they should make light work of opponents that have only beaten minnows in 2024.
