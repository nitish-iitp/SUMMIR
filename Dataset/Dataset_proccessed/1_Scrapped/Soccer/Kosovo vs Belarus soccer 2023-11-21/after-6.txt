With mud and great disappointment. This is how the qualifying campaign for Kosovo ends.

Even after the draw, "Dardans" aimed for the historic European qualification at least from the second position.

And this not only did not happen, but Kosovo ended these qualifications in the penultimate position in group I.

Kosovo ended the qualifying campaign for Euro 2024 worse than it started.

The draws with Israel and Andorra were the starting point for the downhill that Kosovo took in these qualifications.

Tonight, on a muddy field, Kosovo was defeated by Belarus with a score of 0:1.

This was the second defeat by Belarus in these qualifications.

The only goal of the game came in the 43rd minute, when Antilevskiy scored a beautiful goal.

Kosovo ends the qualifications in fifth (penultimate) place with 11 points.

Behind the "Dardans" was only Andorra with two points, one of which was won by Kosovo.
