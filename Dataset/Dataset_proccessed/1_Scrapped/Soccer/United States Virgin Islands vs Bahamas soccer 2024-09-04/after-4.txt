Six debutants on Concacaf Nations League roster

Barbados senior men's national team coach Kent Hall has called up six newcomers to assist with operation "rebuild"

Renaldo GilkesSeptember 4, 2024 03:08 PM ET
A youthful Barbados men's senior team will take on the Bahamas and the United States Virgin Islands during the international break in Concacaf Nations League action.

Six new faces headline the recently announced Barbados senior men’s team roster for the upcoming fixtures of the Concacaf Nations League.

Barbados will compete in Group A of League C after suffering relegation from League B in the last edition of the competition.

Recently appointed Head Coach Kent Hall selected Barbados Soccer Academy duo Jaylan Gilkes and Khimani Cox, Canadian-based defender Nathan Walters, United States collegiate pair Nathan Sealy and Justin Griffith and former University of the West Indies (UWI) Blackbirds winger Justin White.

New look Tridents take on Curacao tonight in World Cup Qualifiers

June 5, 2024 12:40 PM ET

The new boys will have an opportunity to get their feet wet in senior international competition when the Tridents take on the Bahamas on Saturday evening and the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) three days later.

After their most recent results of 1-4 versus Curacao and 1-3 against Haiti in the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, Barbados has an opportunity to turn their fortunes and spirits around.

Jaylan Gilkes (left) challenges an opponent from the United States during the 2019 Concacaf U17 Championship.

The Tridents are the highest ranked team in the group at 177th, followed by the Bahamas who are ranked 203rd and the United States Virgin Islands  who are just five places below the Bahamas, therefore all attention and expectations are on them to win the group and earn promotion to League B.

The team has been buoyed by the return of Kickstart Rush duo Carl Hinkson and Kevon Lucas, as well as promising teenage goalkeeper Jireh Malcolm, all of who missed the last international assignment in June.

There are some notable absences who have been a part of the national programme for a lengthy time, players such as Akeem Hill, Elijah Downey and Jomo Harris. Along with recent call-ups who would have made an impact such as Nadre Butcher and Rommel Bynoe are also out of this specific assignment.

Coach Hall’s bravery, means there will be a huge responsibility on seasoned players such as captain Andre Applewhaite, Weymouth Wales clubmates Hadan “Fatty” Holligan, Ricardio Morris, Mario “Bagga” Williams and Khismar Primus.

Niall Reid-Stephen is expected to lead the frontline for the Tridents, and hopefully can add to his goals versus Curacao and Haiti in June.

Khimani Cox (#9) is surrounded by a host of Aruban defenders in an international Under 20 encounter.

The UWI attacker is fresh from an impressive season in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) in the United states, where he helped Appalachian FC win the East Region Southeast Conference League and finish fourth in the NPSL league nationwide.

The inclusion of Cox, the son of former national midfielder Kirk Cox, should offer some quality offensive support for Reid-Stephen.  Cox is athletic, strong and very accurate in and around the penalty area.

Identifying an internationally equipped holding-midfielder has stumped us in recent times, especially since most of the top nations and clubs are highlighting the importance of an astute player in that position.

University of the West Indies Blackbirds forward Niall Reid-Stephen will be aiming to continue his goal scoring run during this campaign.

Gilkes has the qualities to be that missing piece. His technique and game intelligence can assist the Tridents on either side of the ball.

Sealy, a right back at Salem University and Walters a towering center back for Altitude FC in the Canadian third-tier, will complement a backline which is expected to be marshaled by Williams, along with skipper Applewhaite.

Butcher’s absence is going to leave huge shoes to fill and White, with his United Staes experience at school and club maybe the man chosen to do so.

Griffith, a former youth national team goalkeeper is expected to add coverage for the more experienced Primus and promising Malcolm.

Barbados will kickoff their 2024-25 Nations League campaign versus the Bahamas on Saturday evening at 4 pm at the Bethlehem Soccer Stadium in St Croix.
