Ghana and Namibia face off at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on Monday in a tune-up encounter before beginning their Africa Cup of Nations journeys.

The Black Stars begin this year's AFCON against Cape Verde on January 14, while the Southern African nation battle Tunisia two days later in their tournament opener.

Ghana go into AFCON 2023 as one of the outsiders for the trophy, despite reigning supreme on the continent four times in 1963, 1965, 1978 and 1982.

They seek success after four decades, and Chris Hughton hopes to be the man to deliver the West African nation's fifth crown.

The Black Stars battle Namibia before the finals, keen to secure a positive result before departing for Ivory Coast, but should the form of the four-time champions worry supporters?

Ghana have been beaten in three of their last four games in all competitions, even if fans will state that two losses came in friendlies against Mexico (2-0) and the USA.

However, the 1-0 defeat by Comoros in World Cup qualifying in November set alarm bells ringing, and the Black Stars hope to have that winning feeling before their continental showpiece opener against Cape Verde.

As for Namibia, this year's AFCON represents the Brave Warriors' second since the 2010 finals in Angola, underscoring the need to head into the competition confident in their prospects of making it to the knockout rounds.

Collin Benjamin's troops have never made it out of the group stage at the continental showpiece but could turn the tide this time in the Ivory Coast.

Before facing Tunisia, South Africa and Mali, the underdogs face the Black Stars in Kumasi, hoping to record an encouraging outcome in Monday's encounter.

Despite the overall disappointment of a six-game winless run, the Brave Warriors claimed a 2-0 triumph over Sao Tome & Principe in late November, and they hope to carry the performance from that 2-0 win into facing Ghana, albeit against superior opposition.

Indeed, Monday's game could be more than a friendly for the southern African country.

Thomas Partey is absent from Ghana's AFCON squad, but West Ham United's Mohammed Kudus could feature for the four-time African champions on Monday.

The West African nation's forward line could feature Athletic Club's Inaki Williams, Crystal Palace's Jordan Ayew and Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.

Andre Ayew should compete at an eighth Cup of Nations, and the Black Stars captain should play a part in Monday's game.

Peter Shalulie, who netted four goals, was Namibia's top performer in AFCON qualifying, and the striker should start in Monday's friendly.

The majority of Benjamin's side ply their trade on the continent, although Ryan Nyambe (Derby County), Aprocius Petrus (Liria Prizren), Prins Tijueza (Liria Prizren) and Petrus Shitembi (Kuching City) play outside Africa.


Ghana possible starting lineup:
Ofori; Seidu, Djiku, Opoku, Mensah; Samed, Baba; Williams, Kudus, J. Ayew; Semenyo

Namibia possible starting lineup:
Maova; Nyambe, Haoseb, Gebhardt, Hanamub; Papama, Katua; Kamatuka, Muzeu, Limbondi; Shalulile



We say: Ghana 2-0 Namibia

The Black Stars should secure a routine victory over Namibia to give them the much-needed winning feeling before the finals.
