[[[SPORT<<<<]((((]] Ghana - Namibia Live Broadcast 8 January 2024



Latest news, stats and live commentary for the Friendlies's meeting between Ghana v Namibia on the 8 January 2024.



Since I came here I said I want to win the Premier League. The city did not win it for a long time. Last year we had a chance but Man City also played really well and deserved it. It's our time to win the league. Ruthless Liverpool thrash PalaceWhen can Liverpool win the Premier League?Action and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League gamesHow you rated the playersLiverpool's last top-flight league title, their 18th, came in 1989-90, when Sir Kenny Dalglish led them to victory.

Bundesliga 2. Match where team Darmstadt 98 will play with team Heidenheim. Hosts did 3 wins at last 3 matches played. Their shape is well. There they scored 6 goals. Heidenheim did 2-2-0 in the last matches. There they scored 4 goals. They have a good shape also. My bet will be over 3. 5 goals in this game. Hosts are in the middle part. At home field they play very well. Guests have some chance to reach the 3rd place. They will play in offensive style here. I recommend to try this bet with me for the good odds ! 

I'm just happy that we are back and we can play again. I'm not sure if it would give an edge [playing at Anfield]. If you look at Germany for example, they have not had a lot of home wins! We will speak to our supporters, although I'm not sure we have to because they know. It is a positive situation for us and our fans will not make a negative situation of it, I know that. If the alternative is not to play at all, then I will play wherever you want.

The Premier League has also been asked by Qatar broadcaster beIN Sports to consider "the direct role of Saudi Arabia" in beoutQ illegally showing matches in the Middle East region, although there is a long-running diplomatic row between the two countries. That could prove to be a crucial consideration on whether the test is passed, especially as the Premier League wrote to the US government in February urging it to keep Saudi Arabia on a watch list because it said the country "remained a centre for piracy".

Indeed, we have often done so on our own initiative in those moments in which we have considered it important or necessary. For that reason, we cannot help but be surprised by the fact that from within the club there are those trying to put us under the microscope or apply pressure for us to do something that we have always been clear that we would do,” he added.

Freiburg have won two of their last three home league games. Werder Bremen have one point from their last seven league matches. Werder Bremen have only kept one away clean sheet in this season&#039;s Bundesliga. Only two sides have conceded more away league goals than Werder Bremen. Freiburg start the weekend in seventh place, two points behind the final Europa League qualifying position.

 This game has good chances to end up with both teams scoring as well as most likely exact 3 goals scored or maybe 4, last season Brighton won both games against Crystal Palace in the league winning first with 3-1 at home and also winning here at this stadium with 2-1, so they did concede both times one goal but attack had no problem breaking through the Crystal Palace defense and taking 6 out of 6 points last season against this opponent.

THAT DOESN’T SEEM RIGHT. It certainly doesn’t sit well when you consider how much some of the top executives, coaching staff and players at these clubs earn. It certainly doesn’t sit well when you consider how big a PR push these clubs are trying to put out about how much they’re helping the community.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic's cross was behind Mkhitaryan but the midfielder rapidly readjusted, arcing his foot to send a barely believable backheel looping past Jordan Pickford. It was a strike never to be repeated - at least not until Olivier Giroud scored an even better version just five days later. Arsenal fail to deliverSouthampton 4-0 Arsenal (26 December 2015) The Gunners have only played five times on Boxing Day this decadeArsenal's demise has been a feature of the past decade and Boxing Day 2015 summed up Arsene Wenger's side's decline.

I was not told anything other than 'try to win the next game', that's what we all agreed. A vision for the future and let's try to do the best we can this season," he said. Spurs are sixth, 17 points adrift of second-placed City and six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea who occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot.

Che Adams scored twice and Danny Ings netted from the penalty spot as Saints claimed only their sixth home win of the season at St Mary's. Ings began the game in the hunt for the Premier League golden boot, and with five minutes remaining, he moved to within one goal (22) of Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (23). The Southampton striker had his opportunities to draw level with compatriot Vardy in the second half, but his selfless approach created better chances for his team-mates.

It's home form that has led to a good start to the season for Isloch Minsk. They are yet to pick up a point on their travels and six out of nine league games have been played on home soil. They need to keep coming up with the goods at home then but this won't be easy against Energetik. The away side started well, went into a slump but have picked up again with three wins in a row. A bet on both teams to score is the best bet here.

Lagging behind in the league, out of the Copa and (former captains) with Diego Godin and Gabi gone, everything pointed to the end of an era," said newspaper AS. Then suddenly, no. Against the hardest test of all, the best team in Europe, Simeone's Atletico rose again and produced one of their best performances in years.

there is no more hope for the sonnenhof to avoid relegation this season and I m pretty confident they are going to lose this game despite on the other side meppen has nothing to play for and that is because meppen on the road is very good especially offensively and I think they will score at least two goals tonight and that should be enough for them to get the win because sonnenhof offense is really not so good and they are rarely scoring more than one goal when they are playing at home and surely their confidence is not on high level right now 

Juventus have an impressive 48 points from 19 games -- 15 wins, three draws and a defeat -- and a two-point lead over Inter Milan but their style of play has suggested they have changed Sarri rather than vice-versa. I don't know if Juventus has changed me, my wife tells me I'm just as obstinate as before," said Sarri, who previously turned Napoli into Serie A's most entertaining team.

They have suffered straight losses in their eight matches after lockdown – seven in the league and one in the FA Cup. The team has had the poorest run in the league; scoring the least goals, winning the least matches, and conceding the most and go to this game straight from a 1-0 loss to Chelsea. Each of Norwich’s last eight league matches has ended in defeat and they have scored in just one of the eight – the 2-1 loss to Watford on July 7th.

Second-placed Leicester suffer 2-1 home loss to Saints * Chelsea beat Burnley, Manchester United thrash Norwich (updates after Liverpool win) By Martyn Herman LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Liverpool overcame another obstacle on the path to what looks an almost certain Premier League title triumph as they chalked up a record-breaking 20th win in 21 matches with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.

Earlier in April, culture secretary Oliver Dowden said the Premier League was considering making some behind-closed-doors fixtures available free-to-air when the season restarts. Plans to resume the Premier League season stepped up this week in what has been labelled 'Project Restart', with Arsenal, Brighton and West Ham opening their training grounds to players for individual work on Monday. The league is hopeful of a potential 8 June restart and finishing at the end of July to fit in with Uefa's European competition plans.

The PFA is calling for a "loophole" in EFL managerial appointments to be closed from next season to ensure diversity. The union also wants to see "substantive" diverse representation at board level across football's key governing bodies. In 2019, the EFL adopted a mandatory recruitment code closely aligned with the NFL's Rooney Rule. There are six BAME managers across the 91 clubs in the Premier League and EFL.

Well, as I say I will try a more confident prediction total total of more than two, 1.68 I think fine for this variant. Minsk after the victory charged, Dynamo on the contrary after the defeat should try to win, if Dynamo scored first, then Minsk must necessarily leave the defense and return the score to a draw at places. In the last full-time was scored 5 goals. So, in 18, the teams played 3-3 in a draw, scoring 6 goals for two, why not cut down here too? In addition, this is only the beginning of the season and in the beginning usually play outdoor football.

She may not have the stature of Alex Morgan or Megan Rapinoe but she remains a perfect foil. Ada HegerbergClub: Lyon Nation: NorwayAge: 24 Honours 2019: Women's Champions League, Division 1 Feminine, Coupe de France FeminineA global superstar and winner of the award last year, Hegerberg needs little introduction at all. While she missed the World Cup, she's already made up in part for that with nine Champions League goals this term, to add to her hat-trick in the 2019 final, making her the highest scorer in the competition's history.

There are lots of things going on in the community during this coronavirus crisis that people do not realise are happening because football clubs did not want the badges on their arm, and felt it is their duty to do it. Football is so big in the community and the more you go outside of London, football clubs play an even bigger role.

Celtic has a good result from first leg, 1-1, tonight they will play at home ground, and fans expect much better performance from their club. FC Copenhagen is not an easy opponent, they controlled the ball possession most of the time in the first leg, and they will not to surrender without strong resistance, their major goal in this duel will be to avoid defeat, and by my opinion, they have quality to score at least one goal, anything can happen in extra time. Santos and N'Doyle will be in attack, visitor was very close to victory in first leg, they even missed a penalty kick. Match without winner

As things stand, Sunday's visitors are bottom of the pile and are three points from safety. Three points isn't a lot, so they are very much still in touch, but performances don't exactly suggest that they'll move up the table any time soon.

While Celtic are fighting for yet another title, Hamilton, just as they did last term, are fighting for survival. Wednesday's visitors are three places from the bottom, though they're just a point off sitting below everyone else.

Roma vs Juventus predictions in our match preview for Sunday's Serie A clash. There is pressure on both sides as Roma chase the top four and Juventus try to retain their title. Who will claim the points at the Stadio Olimpico? Read on for our free Serie A predictions and betting tips.

Newcastle Jets will against Melbourne City in match Australia League. My prediction this match could be the win for Melbourne City with margin score is 1 goal. Melbourne City have better result on last 3 match in league due to Melbourne City have won in 2 match and 1 match is draw. Meanwhile, Newcastle Jets have also good result on last 2 match in league due to Newcastle Jets have won in 2 match and 1 match is lose. Nevertheless, my prediction that Melbourne City can beat Newcastle Jets on this match due to Melbourne City on last 2 match always won when they meet on match. 

Hamilton should have had a penalty when Goldson made an awful mess of a diving header, blocking a cross with a flailing left arm and then landing face-first on the ball. He got away with the gaffe. Then at the death, Miller flummoxed Barisic and was only denied by a terrific Glen Kamara cover tackle. The substitute was injured in the process and had to be substituted himself by Blair Alston. Rangers reset and got a grip of the game after the break.

 Bayern are for sure going to win another title in Germany and what better way to do so but by winning away from home at their rivals from Werder Bremen which back in December they simply destroyed at home with no less than 6-1. And Bremen the only reason why they still have chances to avoid relegation is the many points they won on the road as at home they lost about 70% of the games played some by really big scoring difference as well.

FC Minsk made a good start to the new season with a 3-1 away win. They host Dinamo Minsk in this derby clash and their opponents have been disappointing in pre-season. Four games have been lost in a row and they will be determined to improve on that sorry statistic. Place a double chance bet on FC Minsk to win or draw this fixture.

All the managers complained about it but they [the authorities] don't care. A distance of two or three days [between games] again and again. The players suffer. They want to do well and the clubs have a lot of pressure to win or qualify for the Champions League. We push and push. The body says 'stop', 'enough'. With that number of games, the players break down. After a phenomenal start to the season, when he scored 14 goals in his first 16 games, the form of another England forward, Raheem Sterling, appears to have slowed.

 The hosts are just a relegation candidate in their own 3rd league level division as at this moment they have no less than 4 defeats in a row in home games alone and they are not much better in away games as well as they have a record of just 2-2-13 in the league this season and are clear bottom of the league with only 8 points won from 17 games played by them in the league alone.
