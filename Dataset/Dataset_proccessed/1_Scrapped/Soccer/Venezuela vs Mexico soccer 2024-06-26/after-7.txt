Why Mexico are 'better off' not advancing in Copa America

Ale Moreno discusses Mexico's chances to advance from the group stage in Copa America ahead of their match against Ecuador.

Salomon Rondon struck a second-half penalty to send Venezuela into the Copa América quarterfinals on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Mexico in Group B, a result that also sent Jamaica crashing out of the tournament.

Rondon -- Venezuela's all-time leading scorer with 42 -- made no mistake from the spot in the 57th minute after Jon Aramburu was brought down inside the box by Julian Quinones, sending Mexico keeper Julio Gonzalez the wrong way and slotting home into the bottom corner.

The result saw Venezuela end a 13-game winless run against Mexico.

Mexico earned a penalty of their own for a handball in the dying minutes, but Rafael Romo got down low to parry Orbelin Pineda's 87th minute spot kick.

The win moved Venezuela, which beat Ecuador in their opening match, up to six points at the top of the group and secured their progress to the last eight with a game to spare.

Mexico plays Ecuador in Arizona on Sunday in a match that will decide the other qualifier from the group, with El Tri needing a win to advance.

Jamaica is out irrespective of the outcome of their last match against Venezuela in Texas, having already lost to Mexico and Ecuador.

Venezuela could win the group with a draw or victory in their final match against Jamaica, potentially avoiding defending champions Argentina in the quarterfinal stage.

Romo's penalty save was one of five stops that prevented Mexico from finding an equaliser, with his last two saves coming after Pineda's penalty miss.

He first kept out Cesar Huerta's low drive in the 88th minute, then bravely blocked Guillermo Martinez's close-range effort in stoppage time.

Mexico dominated the opening half hour, but Romo was equal to Santiago Gimenez's weak shot from Luis Chavez's through-ball.

Venezuela grew into the game, with Rondon hitting the post with a dipping half-volley in the 34th minute and Yeferson Soteldo forcing Gonzalez into a near-post save in the 50th.
