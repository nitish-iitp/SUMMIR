Edson Alvarez out of Copa America with hamstring injury, will stay with Mexico squad through tournament

Mexico captain Edson Alvarez has been ruled out of the remainder of Copa America with a hamstring injury.

Alvarez, 26, said in a video posted on social media that he will remain with the Mexico squad for the remainder of their tournament to offer his support.

Mexico said Alvarez’s injury was confirmed after tests in L.A. on Tuesday but did not provide an estimate on how long he faces on the sidelines, adding that the “recovery time will depend on the evolution of the player”.

“Unfortunately, my participation in Copa America has come to an end,” Alvarez said. “I have no words — the truth is that it is a hard blow for me because I had that dream as much as my team-mates have it but sometimes these things happen in football and I will have to learn and grow from all this.

“But I wanted to let you know that I have made the decision to stay with the team until the end, to support and encourage them, as I always have done. Now it will be my turn off the field. It will also help my rehabilitation and return as soon as possible.”

Alvarez was forced to come off just 30 minutes into Mexico’s opening game of the tournament against Jamaica after pulling up while attempting to stop a counterattack.

Mexico 1-0 Jamaica takeaways: Alvarez's agony, Arteaga strikes

Medical staff tended to him on the field before the visibly distraught midfielder was helped from the pitch and consoled by team-mates. In Alvarez’s absence, Gerardo Arteaga’s second-half strike secured a 1-0 victory.

Alvarez was appointed as Mexico captain ahead of the Copa America, after stalwarts Guillermo Ochoa and Andres Guardado were left out of Jaime Lozano’s youthful squad for the tournament. The midfielder has 80 caps for Mexico since making his debut in 2017, scoring five goals.

Edson Alvarez the 'Machin' - 'Mexico's most important player'

Alvarez joined Premier League side West Ham United from Ajax for £34.4million ($44.1m) last summer. He impressed in his first season in English football, making 42 appearances in all competitions for the east London side.

Mexico are back in action on Wednesday when they face Venezuela at SoFi Stadium. They close out the group stage against Ecuador at the University of Phoenix Stadium on Sunday.
