Lionel Messi will “see how it goes” after a physical meeting with Chile at Copa America saw him undergo treatment on an apparent injury.

The Argentina captain, 37, was looked at by training staff in the first half of his side’s 1-0 win at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey after a heavy challenge from Chile defender Gabriel Suazo.

A member of the team’s medical personnel worked on Messi’s upper right leg on the sideline before he returned to the field of play after a short delay.

He appeared to do his own share of stretches before exploding into life with a long-range shot that clipped the post as Argentina searched for an opening goal in what proved to be a challenging game.

Messi completed 90 minutes but revealed after the match he had been harbouring concerns from the start.

“I felt some discomfort in my right hamstring at the beginning of the game,” he told reporters.

“It was tight. It wasn’t as loose as it should’ve been. But I was able to finish the game. We’ll see how it goes.”

He also revealed he has been dealing with a sore throat and fever in recent days.

Messi missed six games for Inter Miami during this Major League Soccer season due to muscle injuries with manager Tata Martino limiting the minutes of his star player where able to.

When Argentina traveled for a pair of friendlies in the U.S. earlier this year, Messi was a notable absence.

Head coach Lionel Scaloni had earlier played down concerns over his captain although admitted he hadn’t yet spoke to him.

“I didn’t speak with him after the game,” he said. “He ended up playing through.

“You saw he had the 50-meter sprint there with Angel (Di Maria) and Lautaro (Martinez), and it’s the last image I have (in my head). I can’t say more because I haven’t seen him.”

Argentina — top of Group A and already qualified for the quarterfinals — are next in action against Peru in Miami on Saturday.
