Uzbekistan beat Thailand 2-1 in their Asian Cup last-16 tie with a second-half winner from Abbosbek Fayzullayev at Al Janoub Stadium on Tuesday to set up a quarterfinal clash with hosts and defending champions Qatar.

Thailand were looking to beat Uzbekistan for the first time since 2007 but the central Asian nation scored two stellar goals to deny Masatada Ishii's side.

Uzbekistan took the lead in the first half when Diyor Holmatov lobbed a crossfield ball into the box to Azizbek Turgunboev, who expertly controlled the pass with his chest before volleying it past Patiwat Khammai in Thailand's goal.

But Thailand equalised just before the hour mark when Supachok Sarachat pulled the trigger from more than 25 yards out, with his low shot curling past Uzbekistan goalkeeper Utkir Yusupov who did not react in time to make the save.

However, Uzbekistan restored their lead seven minutes later through Abbosbek Fayzullaev when the winger quickly turned his defender and fired from the edge of the box, directing a low shot that squeezed past the keeper and into the net.

Uzbekistan will be looking to reach the semifinals for only the second time when they take on Qatar on Saturday at Al Bayt Stadium.
