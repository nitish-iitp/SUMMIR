AS Monaco have announced the extension of the contract of Eliesse Ben Seghir, an 18-year-old attacking midfielder trained at the Academy, until 2027.

Scorer of a famous double against AJ Auxerre (in 3-2 win on Matchday 16 of Ligue 1 in 2022-2023) during his first professional match in Rouge et Blanc – thus becoming the second youngest player to score a double in the top flight behind a certain Thierry Henry – Eliesse Ben Seghir has now extended his future with the Club.

The native of Gassin, who joined the Academy in 2020 and signed his first professional contract in 2022, has just extended his contract with AS Monaco until June 30, 2027. Since this impressive debuts, the Monegasque number 7 has established himself within the first team, playing 25 matches, including 3 in the UEFA Europa League, scoring 4 goals and providing 3 assists.

These performances allowed him to be nominated by the UNFP, last May, for the Best Young Player of the 2022-2023 season, after only a few months within the first team.

At the same time, the player trained at SC Cogolin and Etoile Fréjus Saint-Raphaël joined the French U-19 team and won his first cap, on March 22, 2023, against Northern Ireland as part of the qualifications for the Euro 2024. Selected four times by Jean-Luc Vannuchi, the attacking midfielder was decisive by scoring three goals for his team.

The #MadeInLaDiagonale player, coached at the training center by Manu Dos Santos (U17), Frédéric Barilaro (U19) and having also passed through the Elite Group coached by Damien Perrinelle, was also named best player of the Tournoi Maurice-Revello, in June 2023, with the French U-18s.
