History was made by the Indonesia national football team as they secured a spot in the last 16 of the Asian Cup, marking a significant achievement for Indonesian football. This milestone was realized following a 1-1 draw between the Oman and Kyrgyzstan national teams in the concluding match on the evening of Thursday, 25th January 2024.

The outcome of this draw propelled the Garuda Squad, affectionately known as the Indonesia national football team, directly into the last 16 of the Asian Cup. Since the inception of the Asian Cup in 1996, Indonesia has consistently been halted in the group phase.
