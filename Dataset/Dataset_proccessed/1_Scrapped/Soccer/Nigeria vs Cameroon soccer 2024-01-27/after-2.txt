WHAT HAPPENED?

Onana's troubled AFCON campaign has continued with the goalkeeper left out of the starting XI for the second match running. The Manchester United stopper was surprisingly omitted against The Gambia last time out and is on the bench once more for the last 16 tie with Nigeria.

WHAT WAS SAID

The Cameroon manager remained coy regarding his team selection prior to the game, after insisting he has no issues with any players amongst the squad. He said: "I have no problem with my goalkeepers. They are all competitive and ready to respond when they need to play. There is no controversy. They get along very well."

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Onana has previously made his feelings clear on being left out of the starting line-up during the current AFCON tournament.

Speaking in the direction of the Cameroon coaching staff after making a 5000-mile journey prior to their opening game of the tournament, Onana voiced his frustrations at being left out of the match-day squad to face Guinae. He said: “If I wasn't going to play or make the team, then why did I come here on a private jet?"

Onana was previously sent home from the 2022 World Cup due to his strained relationship with Song. The United keeper had retired from international action but reversed the decision ahead of the 2024 AFCON tournament, which he may now be regretting.

WHAT NEXT FOR ONANA

Onana will still be cheering his country against Nigeria, with a glimmer of hope that his team can progress into the quarter-finals and he can regain his spot in the starting line-up.
