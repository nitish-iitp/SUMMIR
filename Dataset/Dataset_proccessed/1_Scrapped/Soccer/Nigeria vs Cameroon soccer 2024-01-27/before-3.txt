HAPPY BIRTHDAY. 
DR EDWARD CHUKUKERE'47
He is 91 years young today. After Rev Fisher, he is the most iconic name which every GCU student knows for having written the College Anthem in 1949 as a Class III boy. He has remained my mentor and his command of English speaks volumes. Even at 91, he works fervently for GCU.It would be nice to have a student for 2024 sponsored in his name.  Please pay to Zenith Bank. Ac.1224309142.gcuoba UEIRE. I am kicking it off with N91k payment for now. Long live Edward Chukukere.In Unum Luceant. 
-Dr ibe 1955. School
