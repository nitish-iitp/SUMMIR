2022/23 was Son Heung-min's least productive campaign since his debut season in north London.

"I was in pain every single moment, literally," the South Korean would later admit, although the pain wasn't caused by Antonio Conte or Cristian Stellini's pre-historic ideals, but by a hernia.

2023/24, however, has seen Son return to his vintage self. The man who chuckles every time he hears the phrase "xG" has been emboldened by Ange Postecoglou's arrival, the Aussie's gung-ho style and his newfound responsibility as club captain.

Amid a barrage of injuries and suspensions, Son has so far been a constant, notching 17 goal contributions in 20 Premier League games. However, the Asian Cup means the South Korean superstar will have to endure his own absence from domestic action for a little while.

Son signed off in style on New Year's Eve as he scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season in Tottenham's 3-1 win over Bournemouth.

He'll next be in action for South Korea at the 2023 Asian Cup which was originally scheduled for last summer, but, just like the 2022 World Cup, the Qatari heat pushed it back to the winter.

The Spurs forward will meet up with the rest of his teammates ahead of a friendly against Iraq on 6 January before the tournament gets underway six days later. South Korea's first group game is against Bahrain on 15 January.

When does the 2023 AFC Asian Cup finish?

The 2023 Asian Cup final is scheduled for 10 February in Lusail and there's a good chance Son's South Korea are competing for glory.

Son's side are among the favourites to go all the way in Qatar. Barring a disaster, they should top Group E and begin their knockout stage journey on 31 January.

What Tottenham fixtures could Son Heung-min miss?

While Spurs supporters would love to see their captain perform well in Qatar, there's no doubt they'd prefer to have Son back in action as soon as possible.

Korea's preparation for the tournament - as well as their group stage fixtures - means Son will certainly miss their FA Cup third-round tie against Burnley as well as the Premier League clash at Manchester United on 14 January.

The Premier League winter break means Spurs' schedule quietens down this month and if, South Korea are knocked out of the tournament in the group stage, Son could return for the FA Cup fourth round if the Lilywhites progress.

If Korea advance into the round of 16 as expected, Son will be absent for the Brentford game on 31 January. Should his country advance into the final, the Spurs forward will also miss Premier League fixtures against Everton and Brighton.
