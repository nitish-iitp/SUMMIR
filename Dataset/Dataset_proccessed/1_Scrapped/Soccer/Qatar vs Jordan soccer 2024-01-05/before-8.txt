BOONE — The Watauga Pioneers wrestling team opened conference play with a 38-33 victory on Tuesday, holding off a spirited comeback attempt in the heavyweight matches from the Hibriten Panthers, and followed it up with a win over Freedom on Friday night.

“It was a great team effort,” Watauga head coach Zack Strickland said on the win against Hibriten. “There were some individual matches that didn’t quite go the way that we had expected. But it takes everyone to perform in order to get a win and some guys to pick up the slack when needed. So I think overall, they did a great job.”
