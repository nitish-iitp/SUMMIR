Japan host Syria in a FIFA World Cup qualifier on Tuesday

Japan welcome Syria to Hiroshima Big Arch Stadium for a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Tuesday. The hosts are coming off a 5-0 away bashing of Myanmar on Thursday.

Keito Nakamura and Koki Ogawa each scored a brace in the rout while Ritsu Doan scored one goal.

Syria, meanwhile, fell to a 1-0 defeat away to North Korea. Jong II-Gwan stepped off the bench to score a last-gasp match-winner in the second minute of injury time.

The loss left the Qasioun Eagles in second spot in Group B, having garnered seven points from five matches. Japan lead the way at the summit with maximum points accrued from five games.

Japan vs Syria Prediction

Japan have already booked their spot in the next round of the qualifiers, having had a perfect campaign so far. They have won all five games and have nothing but pride to play for in this final game. However, the Blue Samurai will be keen to end the second round of the qualifiers on a high with a 100% record.

Syria are directly below them in the table and need a win here to guarantee progression in second place. Nevertheless, a loss would also see them qualify if North Korea fail to win against bottom-placed Myanmar.

Japan are the vastly superior team and, despite not needing the points, are unlikely to take their foot off the pedal with their fans behind them. We are backing the home side to claim maximum points with a routine victory and clean sheet.

Prediction: Japan 2-0 Syria
