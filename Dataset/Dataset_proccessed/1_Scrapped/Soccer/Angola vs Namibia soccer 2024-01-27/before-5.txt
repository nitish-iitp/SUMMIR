NYAMBE'S NAMIBIA REACH AFCON ROUND OF 16 AFTER MALI DRAW

Derby County’s Ryan Nyambe was not included in the Namibia matchday squad for their final 2023 Africa Cup of Nations group fixture in Ivory Coast on Wednesday.





After overcoming Tunisia in their Group E opener last Tuesday, claiming a late 1-0 win, Namibia were beaten 4-0 by South Africa in their second match on Sunday.

A point in a 0-0 draw against Mali, alongside the same scoreline in the match between South Africa and Tunisia, saw Namibia finish third in the standings to reach the Round of 16 for the first time as one of the group stage's four best third-placed teams.

Nyambe, after starting the side's opening two group stage outings, will hope to force his way back into the fold in the knockout stages when Namibia face on Group D winners Angola on Saturday 27th January at the Stade de la Paix (5pm kick-off).

Defender Nyambe has 16 caps for his country following his international debut in 2019.

The right-back has made 16 appearances for Derby since signing as a free agent in September and recently penned a new deal until the summer of 2025.
