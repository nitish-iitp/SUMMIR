Royal Caribbean & Messi celebrate icon of the seas

Friday, January 26, 2024

Just days before Royal Caribbean International’s 55th anniversary, the world’s largest cruise line, along with the iconic sports figure Lionel Messi, known as “The Icon of Icon,” officially introduced the brand-new Icon of the Seas during an impressive naming celebration in Miami. This groundbreaking cruise ship, a unique blend of the finest vacation experiences, took center stage. Lionel Messi, the most decorated soccer player in history, symbolically entrusted the ship to ensure the safety and enjoyment of countless families who will create cherished memories onboard for years to come.

Lionel Messi, Royal Caribbean’s Icon of Icon, expressed his enthusiasm, saying, “Family means everything to me, and it was a thrill to participate in welcoming the world’s best family vacation to Miami. The offerings on Icon of the Seas are truly extraordinary, offering experiences that cater to every member of the family, and these memories will last a lifetime.”

This milestone event, seven years in the making, was hosted by the four-time Emmy award-winning host, Mario Lopez, in the AquaDome neighborhood, a remarkable engineering achievement that represents the ship’s record-breaking lineup of experiences. The event was attended by Royal Caribbean executives, crew members, employees, fans, and partners, including the Meyer Turku shipyard and Inter Miami CF.

Jason Liberty, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group, remarked, “Icon of the Seas represents over 50 years of dreaming, innovation, and our commitment to delivering the world’s best vacation experiences responsibly. It is the ultimate vacation destination for multigenerational families, transforming family travel and fulfilling vacation dreams for all age groups onboard.”

Messi, an eight-time Ballon d’Or award-winner and TIME’s 2023 Athlete of the Year, marked the highly anticipated launch of the cruise ship with a bottle-breaking ceremony that befit an icon. Icon generated record-breaking bookings upon its initial unveiling in October 2022, making it a significant milestone in Royal Caribbean’s history. Jason Liberty, Michael Bayley (President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International), and Henrik Loy (Icon’s captain) joined Messi on stage for the event.

With great enthusiasm, Michael Bayley, the President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International, declared, “Following seven years of dedicated pursuit towards the ambitious goal of crafting a distinctive vacation experience catering to every kind of family and adventurer, Icon of the Seas has now come to life. The official christening of the ship marks the commencement of a fresh era in vacations, and we eagerly anticipate witnessing countless families and friends forging indelible memories during their journeys.”

Icon of the Seas offers a comprehensive range of experiences that combine the best elements of various types of vacations, including beach getaways, resort escapes, and theme park adventures. It features eight distinct neighborhoods, each offering unique day and night attractions. These include thrilling attractions like six record-breaking waterslides in Category 6 and the Crown’s Edge experience, which takes you 154 feet above the ocean, as well as seven pools, including the first suspended infinity pool at sea. The ship also boasts a family-friendly neighborhood designed for young kids, more than 40 restaurants, bars, and lounges, and a wide range of entertainment options.

Starting on January 27, 2024, vacationers can embark on their first journey aboard this extraordinary cruise ship, exploring tropical destinations in the Eastern or Western Caribbean from Miami. Each 7-night voyage includes visits to picturesque Caribbean destinations and a memorable day of excitement and relaxation at Royal Caribbean’s acclaimed private island, Perfect Day at CocoCay in The Bahamas. Additionally, in January 2024, Perfect Day will introduce its first adults-only retreat, Hideaway Beach, featuring a private beach, pools, exclusive cabanas, live music, and more, enhancing the perfect island getaway.
