DOHA: Oman launched their Asian Cup Qatar 2023 campaign on a losing note against three-time champions Saudi Arabia in Doha on Tuesday.




Saudi Arabia beat Oman 2-1 in the Group F match at Khalifa International Stadium in Qatar capital of Doha on Thursday.




The match started with great enthusiasm from the Oman team.




Saudi defender Hassan Timbukti received a yellow card in the first half when he collided with Omani forward Mohsen al Ghassani, to cause a penalty to Oman after a VAR review following Oman players' appeal.

Salah al Yahyaei scored from the spot kick in the 14th minute to give 1-0 lead for Oman.




Oman head coach Branko Ivankovic brought in midfielder Moataz Saleh Abd Rabbo in place of striker Esam al Subhi in 46th minute.




The second half began with clear Saudi pressure, with continuous shots that did not reach the Omani net, while Saudi coach Roberto Mancini made a change by replacing midfielder Sami Khalil with striker Abdullah Hadi Redeef.




On Oman part, Salah al Yahyaei tried to reach the Saudi net with a shot that went over the bar narrowly in the 74th minute.

In the 90th minute Saudi defender Ali Hadi Mohammed al Bulaihi scored the winner to give Saudi the lead. With this result Saudi Arabia and Thailand earned three points each in Group F with Thailand on top over the goal difference.




Oman are third and Kyrgyzstan are fourth and last.

Omani fans




THAILAND WIN




Thailand won 2-0 in the first match of Group F of the Asian Cup against Kyrgyzstan held at the Abdullah Bin Khalifa Stadium in Doha on Tuesday.




Supachai Chaidid scored a goal in each half to lead Thailand over Kyrgyzstan.




Thailand controlled the match from the beginning, without any real threat from Kyrgyzstan, who are participating in the finals for the second time.




Subanat Muinta almost gave Thailand the lead in the 22nd minute, but his shot from close range hit the crossbar. But four minutes later, Chidid scored his first goal.




After conceding a goal, Kyrgyzstan tried to equalise with counterattack tactics, but failed to create a proper scoring opportunity.




The 25-year-old striker added the second goal in 3 minutes into the second half, to end the match with Thailand lead.
