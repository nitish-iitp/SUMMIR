Scorers: Félix 18′, Ronaldo 50′, 60′

Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 130th international goal as Portugal put the Republic of Ireland to the sword.

João Félix opened the scoring for the hosts in Aveiro by curling the ball past Caoimhin Kelleher after just 18 minutes’ play.

But Roberto Martínez’s side stepped things up after the interval as Ronaldo doubled their lead with a sublime long-range effort.

The Seleção’s evergreen captain followed up his wonder strike with a first-time finish to dink Diogo Jota’s cutback beyond Kelleher.

Portugal open their Euro 2024 campaign with a Group F opener against the Czech Republic on 18 June in Leipzig.

Scorers: Bradley 16′, 23′

Conor Bradley’s first-half brace helped Northern Ireland to a comfortable home win over Andorra.

The Liverpool full-back opened the scoring after 16 minutes by prodding home from Callum Marshall’s left-sided cross.

He followed it up with another close-range effort, this time with a diving header to meet Jamal Lewis’s delivery.
