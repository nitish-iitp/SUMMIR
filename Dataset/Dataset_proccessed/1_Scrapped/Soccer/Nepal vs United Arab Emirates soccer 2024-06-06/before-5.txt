“If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark

Following the conviction of Donald Trump on 34 felony counts by a jury of his peers last week, Cult 45, formerly known as the Republican Party, has shown us precisely who they are. Parroting Trump’s lies are now required for membership in MAGA.

I SAW AN ASSASINATION

PoJ Jun 11, 2024 8:31am

When?

Henry J. Jun 8, 2024 4:11pm

I took time to stay off this string and see where it went. At least there is a lot of direct back and forth and Mike and Jat had quite a robust conversation. My memories of politics date to the late 1950s and over the intervening years I was an assasination of a President, his brother and the most famous civil rights leader. I have seen the Viet Nam war come and go, the biggest recession since the Great Depression, a corrupt President who removed himself rather than put the country through am impeachment and conviction. I have seen the climate crisis from the beginning of our awareness it was happening. I have seen the country struggle with its economy, with stark political differences, terrorism, immigration issues never dealt with. What I have never seen, and never thought could happen, is that one political party would throw aside the principals of our democracy, our guiding Constitution, for one corrupt, vile, psychopath, aided by a cabal of the super rich, perverted Christian nationalists, and many expanding racist organizations. Because of this confluence of circumstances, and a fragile, old, candidate, it is possible a fascist will win our Presidency. These circumstances mimic in many ways Germany in the early 1930s. I ha e always been confident Americans could see through the fog of political lies and elect the better candidate. Today the choice is not which is better for the country, it is more existential. The choice is between keeping our democracy and rule of law or losing it to an authoritarian State lead by a maniac who has no conscience. I hope the right choice is made but I just do not know if that will happen

Mike Jun 8, 2024 5:23pm

Hj, I'm there with you. I remember the Nixon/Kennedy debates and knew right away that Kennedy was the right guy.

Today, anybody with a brain should be able to pick Biden as the better choice. trump is so obviously a poison to our nation.

Henry J. Jun 8, 2024 5:57pm

Moke when I watched those debates I determined that both were extremely intelligent and I thought neither won. I just agreed with Kennedy on the issues. Nixon was impressive, knew the subject matter, and perhaps if he won, may have attacked Cuba and started a nuclear war. In any case, the disagreements were on policy, not on personal attacks, not on demonization. That is what has happened since Trump entered the political scene and the GOP has followed suit. Sad and alarming.

Mike Jun 9, 2024 10:29am

Today's maggat party is incapable of governing and has no platform. It's whatever the uneducated, sociopathic, orange lying con man wants to do on the whim of the moment.

PoJ Jun 11, 2024 8:35am

Mike: Haven’t you heard about Project 2025? Looks like this time Republicans might write down what Trump wants into a party platform.

El Guapisimo Jun 8, 2024 7:17am

I do believe kelvin is giving mjb a run for biggest mythinfo spreader. Meanwhile, Don't count mike or rw out. LOL!

Mike Jun 8, 2024 8:40am

What myths?

PoJ Jun 11, 2024 8:36am

Crickets.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 2:07pm

Time has run out for human scum and trump propagandist, Alex Jones. He is now liquidating his assets to pay the Sandy Hook parents $1,500,000,000.00. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. Savor every day, as trump, and those who support him, go to trial, prison, and bankrupt. Everything trump touches, dies.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 4:23pm

Alex Jones was crying on his infowars propaganda program because he has to pay $1.5 billion to Sandy Hook parents. He loses infowars too. That will be very good for America. Now do fox.

Justin A Theriot Jun 7, 2024 4:59pm

Funny you mention Alex Jones and John Kelly in the same thread. The Dems didn't mind Alex Jones, in fact, they actually seemed to favor him, back in the days when he was against the Republicans and the Bushes. On the other end of the spectrum, they hated Kelly, who supported the Republicans. Now they have flip flopped out of their hatred for Trump. And, that is my problem with today's Dem party. No integrity. They will turn on any and everyone, or any and every issue, so long as it suits their quest for authoritarian power. Go ahead and tell me now that is the Republican Party. Cool. I don't care. I have never been a "Republican".

Mike Jun 7, 2024 6:46pm

While I'm sure we can agree on some things, I don't share your take on many. You seem to create/find conspiracies to fit your world view. Some may be accurate. That said, I DO enjoy you challenging practically everything I write. We should all question the foundation upon which our beliefs stand and welcome any opportunity that compels us to examine them.

Justin A Theriot Jun 8, 2024 6:40am

Mike, just a couple of thoughts here. As for me creating or finding a conspiracy to fit my world view, the entity of the US federal government operates as one big conspiracy. That is not simply my opinion, that is the opinion of the majority of global citizens, who have viewed the US Government as a terrorist organization and the largest threat to world peace, for decades now. Of course, the US government is not alone here, this applies to most of the top governments. They all work, at times in concert, at times in conflict, trying to rule us all. That being said, there is some great things the US Government has accomplished, for not just We The People, but global citizens on a grand scale. But, we deserve better. And, better is within the realm of the possible. The current state of DC is sad. Both sides. As for challenging almost everything you write, that is simply not true. Have you noticed there is a pattern to the things I do and do not challenge you on? Have you noticed, for example, that I do not challenge yourself or HJ, when you guys slam the Republicans on the debt. It's one small example, but you seem to comment mostly on this Trump distraction stuff. Do we agree he is a criminal? Absolutely. We just disagree on what he has been charged with, and why. Also, when you returned to this site, you proudly proclaimed you were here to do battle and run everyone you disagreed with off. I'm not one to run from a challenge. When it comes to responding to you, I'm part troll, part antagonist, part contrarian, and sometimes serious. Take your memes for example, I think many of them are funny. In fact, I thought the spray tan meme was hilarious. But, when I brought it up, you denied it, so I dug in. Anyhow, I have rambled on long enough. If you are still reading, we can move forward any which way you like. I'd prefer to back off myself, and let the thread breathe a little more, but if you want to keep in the trenches, I'm your Huckleberry. Lemme know, muh fren. 🐸

Mike Jun 8, 2024 8:20am

My opening position was that the maggats were running wild here and reinforcing their their delusions, like some big circle jerk, and somebody needed to correct them. That doesn't happen any more and the site is better for that. Also, the right stuffer's were getting away with just plain lying to the public without any editorial oversight. They have seem to have self moderated a bit with the fact checking. I still think the D.R. needs more reasonable opinion writers and a stronger editor, but he may be getting his marching orders from way above.

Tired-Of-It Jun 8, 2024 11:52am

"somebody needed to correct them." BWAHAHAHAHA. That's going to take someone with less TDS and is more level headed that doesn't have a bad case of pseudologia fantastica. You keep trying tiger...it's funny. LOL

Mike Jun 8, 2024 4:07pm

Toi, I never had to correct you, because you have never written anything that made sense. Your posts, especially when you laugh manically for no reason, are self-cancelling. Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but you deserve to know.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 10:53am

Lying Faux news anchor, John roberts, told his viewers that trump capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a bottle, when we all know it was President Biden.

Justin A Theriot Jun 7, 2024 11:24am

This is what PBS had to say when the Trump insulin deal was rolled out, "Medicare recipients who pick a drug plan offering the new insulin benefit would pay a maximum of $35 a month starting next year, a savings estimated at $446 annually." Sorry for any misconceptions.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 11:54am

I see you saw his on-air apology. Biden's was for ALL Medicare recipients, not just those picking an expensive drug plan.

Justin A Theriot Jun 7, 2024 2:01pm

Mike, cool. Now that we have that part out of the way, let's address the misinformation you are spreading here. Yet again. Here is what Roberts actually talked about, "I remarked that I recalled back in May of 2020 that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had issued a press release that stated President Trump had a plan to lower insulin co-plays to $35. The Biden campaign’s rapid response issued a response on X,” Roberts said on America Reports on Tuesday.

The Fox News reporter said he had the “receipts” to back up what he said.

“But there are receipts to dispute the Biden campaign’s claim about what I said,” Roberts declared.

Roberts then produced the press release from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that references a “maximum $35 co-pay” for seniors. Roberts also showed footage from a press conference held in the Rose Garden announcing Trump’s plan to lower insulin costs.

“I was in the Rose Garden that afternoon as were

many other news organizations,” Roberts said, then producing a Washington Post article about the price reform too." Each and every time I have looked into a claim you have said was made on FOX News, your claim is not what was said. Also, I am starting to notice a trend with what the China eyed Biden/Harris twitter bot tweets, and you blasting the same talking points here.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 2:29pm

Whatever, misinformation spreader.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 2:30pm

I haven't been on Twitter or X for weeks.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 2:41pm

Lying con man and cult leader trump, had a voluntary program for pharmaceutical companies and wrote an executive order about lowering insulin prices, which was never implemented. The average price for Medicare patients WITH a drug plan, was$57.00.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 6:55pm

trump and the repubs like to talk about all the wonderful things they want to do. But they simply lack the mental capacity and political motivation actually accomplish anything. No, they would rather sit around and complain all day and then cut taxes for their wealthy donors.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 9:42am

President Biden in France the past 2 days, honoring our heroic American military on the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. What a stark contrast to trump, who asked which side were the good guys and referred to our fallen soldiers as suckers and losers.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 10:58am

As a felon, trump could not even serve in the military, therefore, he is unfit to be Commander in Chief. (One of many reasons.)

Justin A Theriot Jun 7, 2024 11:19am

Actually, convicted felons can, and do, serve in the military.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 12:54pm

I guess that makes it fine for this felon to be the most powerful criminal in the world.

Justin A Theriot Jun 7, 2024 11:18am

You sure love to push that suckers and losers disinformation.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 1:06pm

Yes, trump called our military losers and suckers. That WAS confirmed by trump's Chief of Staff, General John Kelly. trump also did not want injured veterans in parades. "No one wants to see that." Also, trump budget proposals cut disability and retirement pay for veterans. Other trump proposals would have cut veterans access to medical care, food, and housing.

Justin A Theriot Jun 7, 2024 2:05pm

Mikie, John Kelley known liar. Just ask the Democrats in DC.

Mike Jun 7, 2024 4:20pm

That's all you got? Just calling someone a liar? Weak sauce. So yes, your lying con man cult leader called our fallen veterans suckers and losers. Sorry if that irritates you.

Justin A Theriot Jun 6, 2024 3:31pm

All the comments about the worthless, drug addict, career criminal, George Floyd are gone. Just like him.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 4:19pm

I'm glad the posts are gone. Hank can get out of control. Thank you Overseer.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 9:31am

Wow! trumpie Steve Bannon ordered to report to prison by July 1st! Yesterday, trumpie peter navarro went to prison. Everything trump touches dies.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 11:41am

I wonder if steve bannon will get his naz! tattoo from his brotherhood protectors while he's in the pokey. That would make it official.

SK Jun 6, 2024 7:48am

"We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth." I normally do not even open Kelvin's politically super biased columns, but here is the truth, Trump will have FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, especially thanks to that sham of a trial. COUNT ON IT, says this NO PARTY CENTRIST voter.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 7:57am

You mean 4 more years in the BIG House.

Tired-Of-It Jun 7, 2024 9:30am

The big white house. LOL

El Guapisimo Jun 8, 2024 7:33am

TOI & SK - Exactly! Meanwhile, PDJD gets another bump up in individual swing state polls, while the money keeps flowin' in. Especially for Trump in San Francisco. Perfect

Mike Jun 6, 2024 8:47am

How is this trial a sham? trump was convicted from his own company's paperwork and the testimony of his associates. Did you follow the trial? Were the checks, emails, recordings, ledger accounts, and notes forgeries? Did all the witnesses lie? Or did you just not like the verdict?

El Guapisimo Jun 8, 2024 7:40am

Interesting that mike deletes another comment. Free speech for me and not for thee, is what mike sez. smh. Meanwhile, the Kangaroo Court had to dust off an expired misdemeanor, redefine it and then manipulate every aspect of normal court proceedings complete with bastardized jury instructions to obtain all y'all's giddy, "guilty until proven innocent," verdict. Maybe all y'all are fooled, but The American people are not fooled.

Mike Jun 8, 2024 9:54am

I haven't reported any comments on this thread. As usual, hankie goes off the rails and gets caught.

Comment deleted.
Mike Jun 5, 2024 5:55pm

It was a homicide, not an O.D., just ask Chauvin. Do you and Jat watch fox or newsmax by any chance?

Comment deleted.
Mike Jun 5, 2024 4:43pm

Hank, he didn't forget, he just wanted to write a truthful column, not one filled with maggaty lies and conspiracy theories. Wait, were you thinking this was the right stuffers' column? That was Monday.

Justin A Theriot Jun 5, 2024 4:05pm

A mixed bag from Kelvin today. I'm gonna keep it light, and just give kudos to him for making this distinction, "adjudicated rapist and convicted felon". The "rapist" thing is a nothing burger. There is no evidence it ever happened, let alone enough to warrant charges.

PoJ Jun 11, 2024 8:42am

Yet a jury had to be convinced of it to make a defamation award to the victim. That’s “adjudication.

Hank Jun 5, 2024 3:50pm

You forgot to mention that Jesse Jackson praised Trump for his decades of supporting the black and minority communities. You forgot that part of the Trump cult.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 9:49am

Hankie, you are really behind the times. Jackson more recently wrote that trump was destroying America. It's like you still think that the confederate flag wavers are Democrats. They aren't, they're maggats. Try to catch up.

Hank Jun 5, 2024 2:34pm

When all else fails and you don’t receive the comments volume of the past, write a letter about Trump. Lmbo

Mike Jun 5, 2024 3:51pm

This is not a letter. It is a column, and by the way, trump is still a lying, traitorous, seditionist, racist, sociopathic sex offending felon. Laugh that off.

Tired-Of-It Jun 6, 2024 5:57am

Okay...BWAHAHAHAHA Your TDS is always hilarious.

El Guapisimo Jun 5, 2024 1:51pm

Perfect. kelvin hits on all cylinders with their fave patented tool - projection. It is what the dem cult party is a about. smh

Mike Jun 5, 2024 2:27pm

Oh look, the audio video club showed up.

El Guapisimo Jun 5, 2024 5:32pm

Yep. All y'all did.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 8:50am

Can you show the other kids how to operate your projector?

El Guapisimo Jun 8, 2024 7:14am

No need. All y'all dem party luvin' minions have got it down. Perfectly.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 7:40am

Do repubs understand that trump is a convicted felon? I realize that the non-billionaire repubs are gullible, bleach-injecting, low information voters, but what percentage are zero information voters?

Tired-Of-It Jun 5, 2024 8:21am

"but what percentage are zero information voters?" Well, that would be anyone who thinks Biden still has all his faculties. Ya know, like you. LOL

Hank Jun 5, 2024 2:33pm

Mike you’re funny. Bleach injecting. That just shows your level of knowledge and what was actually said and described. Parroting garbage

Mike Jun 5, 2024 4:56pm

Hank, i wanted to keep it simple. I didn't think most trumpanzees would understand the word "disinfectant." You have to know the audience you want to communicate with and speak at their level. It's just good writing.

Justin A Theriot Jun 5, 2024 5:21pm

"disinfectant." 🤣

Hank Jun 5, 2024 2:42pm

You took the jab didn’t you🤣you wore the mask and maintained 6 feet clearance until seated next to another table and then took the mask off didn’t you. 😂

Mike Jun 5, 2024 5:05pm

Yes, Hank, I took the jab, every time, washed my hands a hundred times a day, and wore a mask, because I worked with Covid patients in the hospital. When the danger had largely passed, I actually got Covid. I would have never known it, but we had mandatory weekly testing and I had a positive test. No symptoms. I stayed home for a week, tested negative, and went back to work.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 5:16pm

Covid was not some maggaty punch line. A million Americans died. Tell your little Covid jokes to their friends and families.

Justin A Theriot Jun 5, 2024 5:24pm

"Covid was not some maggaty punch line. " correct. It was a virus created by the governments of France, China, and the United States. There may have been other governments involved, but we know these 3 as a matter of fact.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 5:58pm

"as a matter of fact."🤣🤣🤣 Yeah, I can do that too.

Justin A Theriot Jun 5, 2024 6:21pm

Mike, you care to share those facts? Are you aware of other nations that were involved in creating Covid-19? It's safe to say it, you won't get anyone in trouble, the governments are all immune from any accountability.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 9:16pm

No. You are the one who stated "facts" without support. The ball is in your court. You are the one who must prove his point. Of course, you cannot. Typical maggat B.S.

Justin A Theriot Jun 5, 2024 10:00pm

Mike, documents that are entered into the record of numerous Congressional hearings, as well as several US Intelligence reports, support the facts. The virus was created in a lab, that lab had known security vulnerabilities, and the virus got out into the wild. If you can't acknowledge that, your not a serious person. The only other possibility is that is was purposely released, and I ain't going down that path.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 7:04am

"The only other possibility..." Nice way to wall off the other possibility, that it was created in the wild. I am aware of the indications that it may have been man made, but you were sure. No doubts. "It was a virus created by blah, blah, blah..." Things not proven are shades of gray, not black and white.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 9:00am

Jat, maybe if you didn't believe your conspiracy theories whole heartedly, you could preserve a little space in your brain for the existence of doubt. Absolute certainty is a very rare commodity and anybody who tries to sell it to you should be met with the appropriate skepticism. trump, for example, seems absolutely certain about everything.

Justin A Theriot Jun 6, 2024 11:03am

"Nice way to wall off the other possibility, that it was created in the wild." The evidence, the data, the "science", all make it clear that the virus was lab created. It has never been found in the wild, the experts in the science agree that it would not have spread from an animal in the wet market to a human and be so easily spread amongst humans if it were naturally occurring, and lastly the virus was known to be created in the lab. So, yeah, it's from the lab.

Justin A Theriot Jun 6, 2024 11:06am

Mike, "maybe if you didn't believe your conspiracy theories whole heartedly, you could preserve a little space in your brain for the existence of doubt." Sure, and the time for that doubt was 4 years ago now. The evidence has made clear exactly what the virus is, where it was created, and who funded it. I an leaving room for new information as to additional sources of funding. See that? Not dealing in absolutes here at all. I even asked if you had any additional info on the funding. Your not very smart, are you?

Mike Jun 6, 2024 12:06pm

Jat, I'm not denying the virus came from the lab, it's just not a fact that it did and trump's handling of the outbreak was horrendous, borderline criminal.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 12:28pm

Jat, Try reading, "No, gain of function research did not cause Covid 19" published on the Big Think website 6/6/2024. It may help you.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 12:34pm

I'm not sure where my post went, so I'll try again. Jat, try reading, "No, gain of function research did not cause Covid-19," published on the Big Think website on 6/6/2024. It may help.

Hank Jun 6, 2024 3:38pm

Good for you helping, Covid was no joke but the restrictions and mandates were.

Hank Jun 6, 2024 3:41pm

JAT- Fauci funded it. Btw Obama endorsed the labs in Ukraine.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 4:47pm

Since the conversation has been pushed into Covid, here are some interesting things to think about: 1. trump cut 2/3 of the C.D.C. staff operating in China just before the Covid outbreak. 2. trump cut the pandemic early warning system 3 months before the outbreak. 3. trump cut U.S. research on bat-human virus transmission. 4. Trump threw out Obama's pandemic playbook. 5. In a recorded interview with Bob Woodword, trump told him that he knew the virus was airborne and much more dangerous than the flu, while he downplayed it to the public. 6. Because of him downplaying covid, many more Americans died than should have. And the capper to this is that after the vaccine became available, a higher percentage of Americans in trump voting counties died than in Democratic counties. I can't say it serves them right, because they were duped into danger by their lying con man cult leader, trump.

Justin A Theriot Jun 6, 2024 6:14pm

"Trump threw out Obama's pandemic playbook" clown world business right here.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 7:34pm

Jat, the trump administration didn't use the Obama administration playbook and countless thousands of Americans died because of trump's vanity. There, sound better?

Tired-Of-It Jun 5, 2024 6:51am

"a jury of his peers" I wouldn't call 12 TDS dem jury members being lead to a guilty verdict by a TDS judge "a jury of his peers". After reading that nonsense, I just quickly scanned the rest of Kelvin's racist rant.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 7:12am

The lawyers couldn't find 12 sociopathic, treasonous, racist, fat, old, sex offending serial liers, so they had to use normal citizens to form a jury of his peers.

Tired-Of-It Jun 5, 2024 8:19am

"so they had to use normal citizens" NY and California dems ain't "normal." BWAHAHAHAHA

El Guapisimo Jun 6, 2024 6:30am

TOI - It is interesting seeing posts of our our dear leader luvin' friends hold up this Kangaroo Court as legit. LOL! Only because they are authoritarians wanting, "guilty until proven innocent," to be the norm. Undermining the Constitution is the way our demsocialist supportin' friends roll.

Mike Jun 6, 2024 10:03am

Eg, have you heard what the maggat politicians have been saying? Yikes!

Henry J. Jun 5, 2024 3:16pm

Though repeated over and over, no where in the Constitution or law does it say we are entitled to trial by our "peers." We are entitled to a trial by 12 people who reside within the jurisdiction where the alleged crime occurred. If a defendant were tried by his peers, few would ever be convicted of anything.

Justin A Theriot Jun 5, 2024 3:59pm

HJ, yes.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 6:47am

Great job, Kelvin! Every word truth. I can't wait to read what all the trump deranged maggats here have to say in response.

Tired-Of-It Jun 5, 2024 8:17am

"Every word truth" LOL That doesn't much coming from someone inflected with Pseudologia fantastica.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 9:03am

"That doesn't much" and "inflected"? I DO like the "pseudologia fantastica," though, but it applies to serial liar trump, not me. I just write things that trigger your trump derangement syndrome. LoL!

Tired-Of-It Jun 5, 2024 10:42am

"I DO like the "pseudologia fantastica," though" Of course you do. You know it defines you perfectly and so does everyone else with at least one working, brain cell. *That doesn't mean much* Yeah, I missed a word. Oh noooooo. LOL *Afflected* Auto correct did that. It was worth it to watch you wet yourself over it. BWAHAHAHAHA

Mike Jun 5, 2024 11:12am

You didn't miss a word, you wrote nonsense. Also, still dry.

Tired-Of-It Jun 5, 2024 2:10pm

LOL "You didn't miss a word" Yeah, I missed the word "mean". It's called a typo, but hey, when typos are all you've got to excite yourself, you're pretty pitiful. Carry on. BWAHAHAHAHA You're dry? You changed your diaper? Well, good for you.

Mike Jun 5, 2024 5:42pm

Still nonsense, but that's all you got.

Tired-Of-It Jun 6, 2024 6:00am

I'm playing to your level, Mikey. Don't like it...get smarter. LOL

Henry J. Jun 5, 2024 6:11am

Well said Kelvin.
