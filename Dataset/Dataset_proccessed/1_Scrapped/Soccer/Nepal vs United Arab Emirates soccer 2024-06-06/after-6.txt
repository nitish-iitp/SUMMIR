Nepal’s national football team will be playing against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today in a FIFA World Cup Asian Qualifier match. The game will start at 9:45 PM Nepal Standard Time (16:00 UTC) at Prince Mohamed Bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, Saudi Arabia.

This game marks the third match of the second round for Nepal in their quest to reach the World Cup. Nepal has lost all the games and is yet to book a point in the qualifiers. They have lost four of the four games played so far.

The UAE currently leads Group H, while Nepal sits in fourth place. Historically, the UAE has dominated the head-to-head record against Nepal.

However, Nepal is determined to turn the table by winning this game. And all Nepalese people are ready for today’s match with high hopes and excitement.

Nepali football fans across the world will be glued to their screens, cheering on their national team as they strive to achieve a winning result. The match is expected to be a little difficult for Nepal, and every tackle and goal attempt will be crucial.

Can Nepal pull off a surprise victory? Predict your score!
