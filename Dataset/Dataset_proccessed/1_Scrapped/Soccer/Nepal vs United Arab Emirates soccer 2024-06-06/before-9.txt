Cover Story (view full-size image): The amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced is projected to reach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050, with only 33% being managed sustainably. Composting, a key method for recycling the organic fraction of MSW, offers an economically viable solution to transform waste to compost. MSW often contains per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), leading to contamination. PFAS levels in compost range from 1.3 to 11.8 µg/kg, posing risks to human and ecosystem health. Effective PFAS remediation technologies are needed. We explore composting as a sustainable waste management practice, the systems used, and the challenges of PFAS contamination, showing the lack of understanding of PFASs’ fate in composting and emphasizes the need for innovative solutions to address this issue, achieve circular economy, and meet sustainable waste management goals.View this paper
