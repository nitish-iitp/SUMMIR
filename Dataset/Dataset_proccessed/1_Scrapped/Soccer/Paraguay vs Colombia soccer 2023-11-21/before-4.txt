Luis de la Fuente rules out rotations

The Spanish coach, Luis de la Fuente, has attended the media at the press conference prior to the match against Cyprus. When questioned about possible rotations, since Spain has qualified for Euro 2024, he said that he will not give anything away to anyone "because those who are here are deserving. There will be a guaranteed team. I don't want to play down the importance of this match. I know it's utopian, but I take it as a final. We're going to go all out. 

 

As for the chances for the next Euro, Luis de la Fuente explained that it is one of the teams that have options to win the title at Euro 2024. "We are in a position to fight to win, like other teams that are in a position to do so. But we also have the potential to do so. We are in the top ten in the FIFA rankings and we want to continue to grow. France, Germany, England, Portugal and Italy, like Croatia, are teams that compete very well. And then we have to bear in mind that all the teams that are going to the finals have at least eleven very good players, and we can't rule out any surprises," added the Spanish national team coach.
