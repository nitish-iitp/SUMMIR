WATCH: US captain promises team will be ‘hungry’ against All Whites
 posted in: All Whites, National teams, News, Streams and videos |

Under-pressure United States will be hungry for a win against New Zealand, says captain Christian Pulisic.

After losing 2-1 to Canada — the first loss on home soil to those opponents in 67 years — it was important the team responded by beating winning Wednesday’s friendly against New Zealand in Cincinnati.

“We want to take it serious,” Pulisic told a media briefing ahead of the match.

“The guys are in a good place now [after the Canada loss]. We need to respond, and we need to show that, no matter who the coach is, we’re willing to fight and we’re willing to give the best for this country and that we want to win games.

“You’re going to see a team that is hungry and is not happy about the last result, is going to want to go out and fight, and take this game very seriously.”

Though former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager Mauricio Pochettino is reportedly set to be named as the new manager of the national side, US Soccer have been unable to confirm the appointment.

They appointed Mikey Varas as the interim head coach for the two friendly internationals.

“We don’t want to just look at this as we’re in between [coaches] so these games don’t matter,” Pulisic said.

About New Zealand, Pulisic said: “It’s an opponent who’s not going to give it to us.

“It could be a tough match-up so we need to be at our best tomorrow and, hopefully, some guys are really going to step up.”

Meanwhile, interim coach Mikey Varas said the most important thing for his squad was to put the loss to Canada behind them, and to focus on the game against New Zealand.

Of New Zealand, he said: “They want to play; they want to have the ball. A lot of movement, a lot of interchanging of positions. Their shape is very dynamic, and they want to get the ball in the box early.”
