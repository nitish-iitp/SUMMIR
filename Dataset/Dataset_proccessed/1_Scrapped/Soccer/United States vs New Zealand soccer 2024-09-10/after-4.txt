USMNT DRAWS NEW ZEALAND 1-1 AT TQL STADIUM IN INTERNATIONAL FRIENDLY
CHRISTIAN PULISIC MOVED INTO FIFTH PLACE ALL-TIME ON THE USMNT SCORING CHARTS WITH HIS 31ST CAREER INTERNATIONAL GOAL; U.S. NEXT FACE PANAMA AT AUSTIN’S Q2 STADIUM ON OCT. 12 IN FIRST MATCH FOR NEW HEAD COACH MAURICIO POCHETTINO (9 P.M. ET; TNT, TELEMUNDO, UNIVERSO, MAX, PEACOCK, FÚTBOL DE PRIMERA)
SEPTEMBER 11, 2024

CINCINNATI (Sept. 10, 2024) - The U.S. Men’s National Team produced an impressive, bounce-back performance and Christian Pulisic made a bit of history, but a late, improbable goal by New Zealand led to a 1-1 friendly draw between the sides on Tuesday at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati.

The result snapped the USA’s three-game losing streak and didn’t reflect an evening that was dominated by the hosts, who outshot the Oceania champions 17-8 and held more than 66% of possession. Pulisic came off the bench in the second half and lifted his side into a deserving lead, moving into fifth place on the program’s all-time scoring chart in the process. But the Kiwis leveled it in the 88th minute on a fortunate deflection.

While the U.S. fell to 2W-0L-2D against New Zealand, Tuesday’s performance before 15,711 fans was much improved from the 2-1 friendly defeat to Canada on Sept. 7. And it came at the threshold of a promising new era, as veteran Argentine manager Mauricio Pochettino was confirmed as the USMNT’s new head coach shortly before kickoff.

Before passing the baton to Pochettino, interim U.S. coach Mikey Varas decided on a starting XI that featured six changes from the Canada game. Standard Liège right back Marlon Fossey made his USMNT debut while Aidan Morris, who had the assist on the USA’s only goal after subbing on against Canada, joined Yunus Musah in central midfield. The American attack featured new starters Haji Wright and Ricardo Pepi in wide roles, to either side of holdovers Brenden Aaronson and striker Folarin Balogun.

A high energy level and collective commitment to pass and move was evident as the USA dominated the ball early, but solving the Kiwi defense would require some persistence from a fresh combination of players. The Americans thought they’d broken through in the 19th minute, but a slick finish from Pepi was nullified by referee Selvin Brown for a foul during the build-up. Wright cut inside from the left and sent an 18-yard bid just wide of the left post in the 25th, then shot high from long range a couple minutes later.

Fossey, the Los Angeles-born, Fulham academy product, had an excellent evening overall and quickly proved to be a genuine attacking threat on the right. After setting up Pepi’s 19th-minute effort, he fed the PSV Eindhoven attacker again in the 35th. But Pepi’s curling, first-time shot bounced just wide of the left post. Musah then forced a good save from New Zealand’s Max Crocombe with an ambitious but well-hit blast in first-half stoppage time.

The U.S. entered halftime with a clear territorial advantage and plenty of momentum, but still level on the scoreboard. Luca de la Torre, the scorer against Canada, replaced Musah to start the second period. The Americans continued to carry possession, although All Whites forward Elijah Just had a good look at goal on the counterattack in the 56th minute. U.S. veteran Matt Turner made the save, and Pulisic came on for Wright seconds later (center back Chris Richards was wearing the armband for the first time).

The USA’s leading active scorer would make the difference. The Americans took a well-earned lead in the 69th minute on a play that started with a ball from Morris to Fossey on the right wing. Successive passes to De la Torre, Pepi and Balogun set up Pulisic on the left side of the penalty area, and he deftly guided his left-footed shot past Crocombe and inside the right post. Pulisic’s 31st international goal lifted him past National Soccer Hall of Fame striker Brian McBride and into fifth place on the USMNT’s all-time scoring list (in 72 games compared to McBride’s 95). Pulisic is now three behind No. 4 Eric Wynalda.

The U.S. continued to push and look for a second goal, but it fell victim to a long, high ball from the back that was headed by substitute defender Caleb Wiley and bounced into Mark McKenzie’s path. The Toulouse center back pivoted and smashed a clearance that struck Waine and then floated over Turner.

Pochettino will make his debut on the U.S. bench when the USMNT opens the October international window with a friendly against Panama on Oct. 12 at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Tex. (9 p.m. ET; TNT, Telemundo, Universo, Max, Peacock, Fútbol de Primera). He’ll then get his first taste of the USA-Mexico rivalry on Oct. 15 at Guadalajara’s Estadio Akron (10:30 p.m. ET; TNT, Max, Fútbol de Primera). That will be the first away friendly against El Tri since the 1-0 win at the Estadio Azteca in 2012.
