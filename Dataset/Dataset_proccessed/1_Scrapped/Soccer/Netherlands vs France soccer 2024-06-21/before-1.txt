La Roja were always in control despite winning by a one-goal margin only.

After Germany, Spain are the second team to reach the Euros knockouts thanks to a win over Italy, while England stay on top of Group C despite drawing against Denmark.

Spain 1-0 Italy: Defending champions give in to Spain's dominating play

La Roja broke the deadlock only in the second half, but it never looked like it could go any different.

Italy's goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma did his best to fend off Spain's constant incursions but finally had to surrender after teammate Riccardo Calafiori unluckily pushed the ball into his own net. Italy's reaction came too late.

The Azzurri's next face-off against Croatia will be decisive.

England 1-1 Denmark: Kane's first Euro goal not enough to secure victory

Harry Kane opened the scoring for England in the first half but Denmark quickly reacted with an amazing shot from outside the box by Sporting Lisbon's Morten Hjulmand.

Denmark looked overall as the better team on the pitch while England often appeared clumsy and vulnerable in the back. Nonetheless, the draw keeps The Three Lions top of Group C with Denmark and Slovenia two points behind, followed by Serbia.

England now need only one point against Slovenia next Tuesday to reach the knockout phase.

Slovenia 1-1 Serbia: Jović's late header pulls Serbia out of trouble

Another Euro 2024 game was decided in the last minute, as Serbia wrote off Slovenia's celebrations thanks to a 95-minute equaliser by AC Milan's Luka Jović.

Slovenia opened the scoring in the second half, with Žan Karničnik, after a brilliant ball recovery followed by a quick counterattack.

But Serbia's efforts finally paid off as they earned a corner to set up for Jović's goal.

England remain first in the group as they face off with Denmark at 18.00CET, followed by Slovenia, second with two points, and Denmark and Serbia with one point each.

Fun fact, the last AC Milan player to score in a Euro Championship before Luka Jović was Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimović against France in 2012.
