Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.
Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.
Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Netherlands - France: live updates

Full-time thoughts:

In the end, both sides appeared to think that a draw was not a bad result, given the third fixture still to come. Having said that, it was by no means a bore-draw, with chances flying left and right for both sides, especially in the first half.

In the first 45, the Netherlands blitzed France, pressing them high across the pitch and squeezing the life out of their attackers. However, given the crazy nature of the game, despite Gakpo, Simons and Memphis intertwining like Olympic ice skaters, France had the best chance when Rabiot squared to Griezmann inside the box, only for the pass to be poor and the Atleti player to fall to the floor as he scrambled to squeeze it under Verbruggen.

In the second half, France came out and bossed the ball, controlling the ball and dictating the flow of the game as the Oranje sat back and looked for the counter.

But just as happened in the first half, the dominance did not equate to chances in front of goal, and Xavi Simons thought he broke the deadlock with around 20 minutes to go. He would have put his side ahead in their worst moment of the game were it not for Dumfries' offside position as the ball hit the net, and the score remained level.

All to play for in the second half...

While the chances cooled somewhat in the final 10 minutes, we've seen some incredibly entertaining football on show.

The chances have been flying in from minute one with both sides going full throttle to take the advantage. While France have carved out some good opportunities, the momentum has certainly been with the Dutch, who have wasted plenty in front of goal.

The movement from the front 4 of the Oranjehas sent French heads spinning and Deschamps' plan hasn't managed to keep them at bay so far.

Gakpo, Memphis and Simons have been brilliant in combination play on the left and through the middle, with Frimpong a constant danger down the other side, although it must be said that Theo Hernández has had a fairly good night so far against him.

However, we're yet to see anything from Thuram and Dembélé, who have been squished to a pulp by the Dutch press out wide and in the middle, with all 11 players in orange working hard to keep a lid on things off the ball.

Having said all that, this is France. And while Rabiot didn't shoot when he was one yard out, instead squaring it to Griezmann, France are the team we're used to: they're not fantastic but they find a way to win, and there's a certain player on the bench who knows how to do that...

A big chance for the Netherlands goes begging after a terrible pass from Gakpo sees the move break down. 

The Oranje attacked with the former PSV man, who slid into Xavi Simons.

After being worked back to Gakpo, he wanted everything on his right foot and the touch allowed the defence to slip back into position. Then, somewhat inexplicably, instead of shooting, he played the ball straight out of play.

What the lesson learned against Poland is that you need to play the high level for 90 minutes not just 60 minutes.

Ronald Koeman, Netherlands manager

Be careful about where you lose the ball and in which parts of the pitch you really need to dare to play. To think about where you are in defence what's your position and what will happen if I lose the ball here. This is all very important.

Ronald Koeman, Netherlands manager

Not everything depends on whether Mbappe is there or not. We know that he can be a game changer. He had a big influence on the last two games.

While Les Bleus take on a poor Poland side, the Netherlands go up against Austria. Since both of the latter two can't win in the final game, it looks like that one will indeed be the crunch result in this fascinating group.

Real Madrid's Tchouaméni makes the XI

Aurélien Tchouaméni is Deschamps' choice for the starting XI, replacing Kylian Mbappé.

On paper, replacing a forward with a midfielder doesn't fit square pegs into square holes, which means we expect another player, probably Antoine Griezmann, to sit closer to the attacking line than he did in the previous game.

Poland 1-2 Netherlands: how it went

When Adam Buksa put Poland ahead after just 16 minutes in the first game, many thought we may be on for another shock result in this tournament that has had us on the edge of our seats for just about every game.

However, the Dutch courage soon showed and it was Cody Gakpo who equalised before the half-hour mark in Hamburg. 

From then on, while the game was never completely one-sided, another goal from the northwest Europeans could well be on the way.

It was, but they had to wait, and Poland did what Poland do, drawing the life out of the game as their opponents pushed, with Wout Weghorst getting a late goal as the clock ticked towards the final five minutes.

It was enough to see them get three early points on the board and put Koeman’s side in a great position to qualify for the next round... if they win tonight.

How things went in the last game for Les Bleus...

Ahead of the first round of games (and before we all watched England play in denim jeans and flip-flops), France were the favourites of many to win the tournament outright, with stars such as Mbappé, Dembélé and Griezmann looking like too much to handle. 

While their win over Austria was not inspiring, and an own goal needed from Max Wöber to separate the sides, France have never been scintillating to watch during their recent period of dominance, save for perhaps the World Cup final in 2022.

They dig themselves into holes and fling themselves out, with Deschamps’ calm, conservative style juxtaposed with top talent like the names mentioned at the top. It’s what they do and it’s what we might see tonight as they come up against a Netherlands side with an impressive amount of flair.

Who to watch: Xavi Simons

While much has been made of ‘prodigy’ Xavi Simons, much has also been made of his lack of impact on a football pitch while wearing an orange shirt.

While I don’t think he’s got either chrysophobia or esperidoeidiphobia, it’s true that Simons’ games in the colour orange or the kit’s resemblance to a citrus fruit is the reason behind his less than stellar showings for the Netherlands.

However, we’re in his club stadium today, something which might give him a little more confidence around the place, and the oomph to shine in front of the expectant fans.

EURO 2024

Will Kylian Mbappé play for France against the Netherlands in Euro 2024?

And here's the latest: the Real Madrid player is set to miss out on a place in Deschamps' starting XI for their second game in the group stage.

It seems as though his broken nose has not healed sufficiently in time for the French forward to squeeze his way into the starting side, although the flow of the game will certainly increase or decrease his chances of getting on the pitch.

The big question mark heading into today’s clash is whether or not a certain Kylian Mbappé will be fit to start.

The Real Madrid forward suffered a heavy hit on the nose in France’s previous game and as such, his availability for the fixture has been questionable. 

The player has been spotted wearing a mask in the colours of the French flag, although despite this bit of extra kit, he still was not given the green light to play in the days leading up to the game.
