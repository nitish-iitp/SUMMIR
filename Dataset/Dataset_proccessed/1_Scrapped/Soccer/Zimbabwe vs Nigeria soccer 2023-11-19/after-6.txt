Super Eagles star, Alex Iwobi has opened up after the Nigerian team played a 1-1 draw with Zimbabwe on Sunday.

Iwobi insisted that Super Eagles players flew four hours for the Zimbabwe tie, which he said was a lot for Jose Peseiro’s men.

The Fulham player spoke alongside Super Eagles manager Jose Peseiro during the post-match press conference after the clash.

The former Arsenal and Everton star shared similar thoughts with the gaffer on how the travel affected the team.

“He [Jose Peseiro] has already said the travel was a lot for us, after the game [against Lesotho] we had to fly four hours then another three-hour coach down here which was not easy but as a player, we should not use that as an excuse,” Iwobi said.

“We are professional enough and we have lots of quality in the side.”

Meanwhile, Walter Musona and Kelechi Iheanacho scored for their respective teams in the Group C matchday 2 encounter.

Nigeria’s next World Cup qualifier is against South Africa on June 3, 2024.
