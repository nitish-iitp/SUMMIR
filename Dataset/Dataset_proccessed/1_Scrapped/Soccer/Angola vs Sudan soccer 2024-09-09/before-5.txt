Angola and Sudan return to action in Group F of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they go head to head at the Estadio 11 de Novembro on Monday.

Having picked up opening-day victories in midweek, both nations will head into the game looking to maintain their solid start to the campaign and open up a three-point lead at the top of the group.

Angola kicked off their quest for a spot in Morocco next year on a high as they snatched a 1-0 victory over four-time African champion Ghana in their Group F opener on Thursday.

Red Star Belgrade striker Milson grabbed the headlines at the Baba Yara Sport Stadium as he netted in the 93rd minute to hand Angola a last-gasp victory and end the Black Star's 24-year unbeaten run in Kumasi.

This followed a stunning run to the 2024 COSAFA Cup in July as Pedro Goncalves's men brushed aside Seychelles, Lesotho and Comoros to reach the final, where they thrashed Namibia 5-0 to clinch their fourth title in the Southern Africa tournament.

Angola have now won their last five games across all competitions, scoring 14 goals and keeping two clean sheets, and are unbeaten in nine consecutive matches since a 1-0 friendly defeat against Morocco on March 22.

The Black Sable Antelopes will be backing themselves to maintain this fine run of results on Monday as they take on an opposing side against whom they are unbeaten against in their last four encounters, picking up one win and three draws since 1988.

On the other hand, Sudan turned in an impressive team display in the Group F curtain-raiser last Wednesday as they picked up a 1-0 victory over Niger when the two nations squared off at the Juba Stadium.

Nongbua Pitchaya midfielder Abo Eisa finished off a well-worked set piece six minutes into the second half to break the deadlock and put the Falcons of Jediane in front before they held on to see out their lead.

Sudan have now won each of their last four competitive matches, including three consecutive victories over Congo DR, Mauritania and South Sudan in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

James Kwesi Appiah's men, who are 121st in the latest FIFA World Rankings, currently hold a one-point lead in Group B of the World Cup qualifiers, having picked up three wins and one draw from their opening four matches.

After missing out on the 2023 AFCON in Ivory Coast, Sudan set out in search of a second consecutive victory in their opening two qualifying matches as they aim to return to the continental showpiece for the first time since their group-stage exit in 2021.

Angola showed their mettle against a star-studded Ghanaian side in midweek and Goncalves could name a similar starting side, meaning that we could see Nurio Fortuna, Show, Fredy and Clinton Mata in the centre of the park once again.

Olympiacos defender David Carmo, who made his Angola debut in March, should form the back three alongside Bastos and Bruno Gaspar, with 30-year-old Nebulu starting between the sticks once again.

Milson turned in a solid cameo against the Black Stars last time out and could be handed a starting role on Monday which could see Rayo Vallecano forward Randy Nteka sweat over his place in the Black Sable Antelopes' attack.

As for Sudan, 28-year-old Mohamed Mustafa was forced off with a 85th-minute injury against Niger in the opening game and the Azam FC goalkeeper is a doubt for Monday's clash.

Should he fail to shake off the injury, Al-Hilal Omdurman man Ali Abdullah Abou will in goal for the Falcons of Jediane, who have kept three consecutive clean sheets since a 2-1 friendly loss against Guinea-Bissau on March 25.

Mohamed Abdelrahman, who has netted 19 goals in 40 senior caps since his debut in August 2017, should lead the Niger attack once again, while the Omdurman duo of Walieldin Khidir and Mohamed Abuaagla should form the two-man midfield pivot.


Angola possible starting lineup:
Neblu; Carmo, Bastos, Gaspar; Fortuna, Show, Fredy, Mata; Dala, Mabululu, Milson

Sudan possible starting lineup:
Abou; Agab, Koko, Karshoum, Khamis, Abuaagla, Khidir; Eisa, Omer, Thierry; Abdelrahman


We say: Angola 2-1 Sudan

Sudan have put together a fine run of results in recent outings but will need to be at their best against Angola who are currently firing on all cylinders. The Black Sable Antelopes' home advantage should give them an extra edge on Monday and we fancy them to secure all three points.
