Otto Addo

Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu says the Black Stars are on the wrong path under coach Otto Addo after a disappointing start to the 2025 AFCON qualifiers.

The former Ghanaian international raised concerns after the team failed to win any of their first two games in the qualifiers.

The Black Stars started their campaign with a 1-0 loss to Angola at the Baba Yara Stadium. Their troubles deepened on September 9, 2024, with a 1-1 draw against Niger in their second Group F match.

With only one point from two games, the four-time African champions now sit in third place in the group. With four matches left and only the top two teams qualifying, Ghana’s chances are in jeopardy.

"With the kind of quality players we have, and we struggle to string three or four passes together, even after taking the lead, Niger dominated possession and had 16 shots, three on target, while we managed six shots with three on target. After the game, the Black Stars got just one corner," Agyemang-Badu told Asempa FM.

"I don't think where we are going is the right direction. We used to reach the finals, and now we are getting eliminated in the group stage. At the moment, we are struggling to even qualify from our group. Things are getting tougher for us," he added.

Ghana will aim to revive their AFCON qualification hopes in October with a critical doubleheader against Kwesi Appiah's Sudan.
