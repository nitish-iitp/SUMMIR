Historic Moment at Maracanã

The Maracanã stadium, where Argentina clinched the Copa América title against the hosts two years ago, witnessed another remarkable moment as the Albiceleste secured a victory over their arch-rivals. Brazil, a five-time world champion, had never suffered a defeat at home in a World Cup qualification match, boasting an impressive record of 65 games without loss, comprising 52 wins and 13 draws.

The celebration for the reigning world champions was nothing short of euphoric, with central defender Nicolás Otamendi sealing the match's fate with a powerful header into the right corner of the net in the 63rd minute. However, the start of the superclásico was marred by a half-hour delay due to severe clashes in the stands involving Argentine and Brazilian supporters, as well as Rio de Janeiro police.

Brazil's Unprecedented Fall

Brazil's unexpected loss in this match pushed them to an unprecedented sixth position in the South American qualifiers, the last slot for direct qualification to the 2026 North American World Cup. In contrast, Argentina now leads the standings with 15 points, followed closely by Uruguay with 13, and Colombia trailing by just one point after defeating Paraguay in Asuncion 1-0.
While the Maracanã spectacle held the spotlight, Ecuador quietly sought redemption on the pitch by defeating Chile 1-0 in Quito. This hard-fought victory, achieved through Ángel Mena's 21st-minute strike, eased Ecuador's disappointment over deducting three points in the ongoing qualifiers. These points were subtracted following Chile's complaint about the improper inclusion of Ecuadorian defender Byron Castillo on the road to Qatar 2022. This dispute had the potential to alter the competition's dynamics.

Uruguay Dominates in Montevideo

Uruguay, often regarded as a football powerhouse in South America, secured the role of Argentina's closest contender in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers by delivering a resounding 3-0 victory against Bolivia in Montevideo. Liverpool forward Darwin Núñez netted two goals for La Celeste, while an own plan by Bolivian defender Gabriel Villamil added to the scoreline. The match also witnessed an emotional farewell to Bolivia's star player, Marcelo Moreno Martins, as he took his final bow from international football. This poignant moment was met with applause from teammates, opponents, and the local crowd.

In another compelling encounter that concluded the sixth round of qualifiers, Venezuela and Peru battled to a 1-1 draw in Lima. Peru scored through Yoshimar Yotún in the 17th minute, but Venezuela's Jefferson Savarino leveled the match at 54 minutes. This unexpected result placed Venezuela in a surprising fourth position in the qualification standings, well within the zone for direct World Cup qualification, with 9 points. In contrast, Peru languishes at the bottom with just 2 points.
