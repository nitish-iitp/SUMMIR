Preview: Slovakia vs. Sweden - prediction, team news, lineups

Tied atop League C Group 1, Slovakia and Sweden will continue their battle for automatic promotion in the UEFA Nations League on Friday night, when they lock horns in Bratislava.

Both teams won their first two matches last month, so a straight fight to finish first could take place between now and November.

As the new Nations League campaign kicked off in early September, Slovakia returned to action for the first time since dramatically bowing out of Euro 2024, where they lost to eventual finalists England in the last 16.

En route to the knockout phase, the Falcons had beaten Belgium and drawn with Romania, so they still took some positive momentum into last month's games against more modest opposition.

Their quest to earn promotion to League B started with a hard-fought victory over Estonia in Tallinn, with Hellas Verona forward Tomas Suslov scoring the game's only goal during the second half.

That was swiftly followed by a 2-0 defeat of Azerbaijan in Kosice, where another Verona player, Ondrej Duda, converted a penalty before David Strelec effectively wrapped up the points with Slovakia's second.

Having failed to mount a serious challenge for a place in Europe's second tier during the 2022-23 season, Francesco Calzona's side are therefore on track for at least a playoff when this year's group phase finishes.

However, if they are to pip Sweden to top spot, they must surely end their drought against Friday's opponents: Slovakia have yet to win in six previous meetings - most recently losing at the Euro 2020 finals.

Sitting alongside their next hosts on six points, Jon Dahl Tomasson's side cruised past their first two Nations League challengers without conceding a goal.

After losing three out of four friendly fixtures at the start of his reign, new Blagult boss Tomasson eased the pressure by recording back-to-back competitive wins in September, following a 3-1 success in Azerbaijan with a comprehensive home win three days later.

Having also found the net in Baku, Sporting Lisbon goal machine Viktor Gyokeres scored twice in Solna, while strike partner Alexander Isak also registered his third goal of the campaign as the Swedes strolled to victory in some style.

Following their relegation from League B in 2023, Sweden are already hot favourites for an immediate return, while winning Group 1 could potentially lead to a backdoor place in the World Cup playoffs, if required.

Taking maximum points this month would put them in pole position to claim top spot, but they have lost three of their last four away matches ahead of a tough assignment at Stadion Telhene Pole.

Causing a headache for coach Francesco Calzona, Slovakia will be without several key players due to injury for both Nations League matches this month.

First-choice goalkeeper Martin Dubravka is absent, so Marek Rodak should deputise between the posts on Friday evening, while Euros star Ivan Schranz and veteran midfielder Juraj Kucka are also injured.

Furthermore, Verona pair Ondrej Duda and Tomas Suslov have been struggling for fitness of late - though both are staying with the squad - so Calzona could be set for an enforced reshuffle.

Meanwhile, Sweden are missing one of their brightest stars, Dubravka's Newcastle United teammate Alexander Isak, meaning Viktor Gyokeres will be the visitors' only specialist centre-forward. Tottenham Hotspur winger Dejan Kulusevski is set to link up with the Sporting ace.

Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen is absent again, having missed out last month, while Celta Vigo centre-back Carl Starfelt and Club Brugge forward Gustaf Nilsson also withdrew.

Midfield duo Jens Cajuste and Mattias Svanberg are unavailable too, so promising Under-21 players Hugo Bolin and Daniel Svensson - the latter reportedly of interest to Liverpool - have been called up as cover. In the circumstances, Tottenham teenager Lucas Bergvall may even be handed a start.


Slovakia possible starting lineup:
Rodak; Pekarik, Obert, Skriniar, Hancko; Benes, Lobotka, Duda; Duris, Strelec, Haraslin

Sweden possible starting lineup:
Johansson; Krafth, Douglas, Hien, Gudmundsson; Karlstrom, Bergvall; Kulusevski, Nanasi, Elanga; Gyokeres



We say: Slovakia 1-2 Sweden

Clearly the best two teams in their League C group, these sides could play out a close-fought contest - albeit both will be badly hampered by injuries.

Sweden are still searching for identity under new management, but they possess enough attacking talent to beat Slovakia and go clear of the pack with maximum points.
