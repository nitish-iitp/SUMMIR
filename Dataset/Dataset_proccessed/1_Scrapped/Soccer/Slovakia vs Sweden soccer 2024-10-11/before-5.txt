What on Earth? Zwayer in Gibraltar-San Marino? This is the joke of the year. I literally started laughing when I saw the appointment.

Chefren7 October 2024 at 10:23

This can remember an appointment made by Collina many years ago, by sending Felix Brych in San Marino (I don't remember the opponents). But... apart from that, this can be related to the incredible events Tohver had to face in Gibraltar on last month... moreover, it seems as committee is starting to think also League C and D deserve maybe more attention.
I think there is nothing related specifically to Zwayer condition for this choice.

Chefren7 October 2024 at 10:24

But maybe, more incredible, Colombo in England - Greece. Apart from U17 and U19 games, this should be his first senior game and debut (he skipped the whole preliminary rounds in Summer for some reasons...). Big plans!

MARIO7 October 2024 at 10:35

Incredible to me !!!! Ok with only 3 teams in the D1 group each match is a play off, but come on........Gibralter - San Marino to Zwayer is against any law of physics..... :-) It's not fair respect to second category referees, it seems they are not able to manage neither Gibralter- San Marino

Howard Maxi7 October 2024 at 16:51

It was San Marno vs Estonia for Brych back then. Missed a RC for SFP in the first minute.

petschovschi8 October 2024 at 12:37

I remember Rizzoli in Greece- Feroe back in 2014.If I remember well, in that round, there were many top referees sent by Collina to whistle in low-profile games.

Reply
Philipp S7 October 2024 at 10:47

After no 2nd group referee on MD1/2, they are now appointed to half of the games on Thursday, including two league B games.
And indeed Colombo's appointment is hard to understand. Maybe replacing Maresca, but still quite a jump from U19 qualifiers...

Reply
Euro Soccer Ref7 October 2024 at 11:31

I expect a difficult game for Milanović. Interesting that GIBSMR was given to a top elite referee and this game to a young unexperienced Serb...

Nikola Dabanović is treated like he is between elite and first category. Still no really big games but some sort of importance is always there for him.

Eskås continues as a fully trusted elite referee. One can say he didn't do much to be considered top elite but Rosetti sees things differently.

Colombo's 'out of nothing' appointment leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I can't understand this move, even if he had been really good domestically. It shows you don't reach the certain level step by step but you are thrown there as an experiment. Bad management, imo.

Undiano Mallenco replaced initially appointed Velasco Carballo as observer in NORSVN. Lukjančukas with an always-important game involving Slovenia... Big test for the Lithuanian.

Sundberg and Derevinsʹkyy will try impress the committee in a close C4 group.

Zwayer's appointment is understandable to me. Both teams play in a rough manner due to technical deficiencies. You need an experienced referee to cope with such kind of game. I think that Rosetti explained it well to the German. Good move, imo!

Nerazzuri7 October 2024 at 12:31

HUGE surprise in Colombo's appointment.
Not only does he get a game, but also quite a nice one. Wonder if it's a replacement but even so, there are so many names that should be ahead of him ( Massa,Mariani,Guida,Pairetto etc ...). This is so exciting for me considering that I feel that italian referees are a bit undervalued here after Orsato's retirement, though they are doing very well locally. I really hope he manages it well.

Other than that, not surprising anymore seeing Eskas, he is starting to get a lot of recognition by the committee and deservedly so, with good performances lately.
Dabanovic also starting to have more and more games which is good to see.
As for Zwayer, with what happened with last Gibraltar's game, I think this is logical even if a bit of an overappointment. The German has been very solid this year and nowhere near a penalty for him.

Eskas yes fully deserves his appointments. Trust in Dabanovic I don't understand, every time I've seen him he wasn't good. Liverpool v Bologna was a catastrophe, inconsistent foul detection, nonsense yellow cards. And it was one of the easiest games you can get as a referee!

Reply
M7 October 2024 at 14:44

If Zwayer is appointed for GIB-SNM,then what about Andora match?

They also play rough and they have matches that are brutal and ugly.

So what about them,why not send more experienced and better refs to their matches if we are sending Zwayer to League D?

I agree,last GIB was difficult and ugly for Tohver,but if that's the case then for every difficult match we should then appoint Elite ref.

Letexier to referee Bosnia and Herzegovina - Germany, appointment made before and kept after Leipzig - Juventus.
Had it been Italy - Belgium for the French, Rosetti would have replaced or switched him with another referee, be sure...
Chiffi back after a very long time and a regular assignment for him, I think.
Maybe a bit sub-standard the game in Sweden for Mariani, but still quite good.

Jonas8 October 2024 at 16:06

In Switzerland, Fähdnrich is one of the most trusted referees. I don’t doubt, that he is good enough for this game. But I agree, there was no development path internationally, this appointment comes out of nothing. Especially now, after Schnyder got his first CL game and Schärer is on his way to the highest elite referees

That's correct. Both Dankert and Dingert turn 45 next year so no surprise.

Euro Soccer Ref8 October 2024 at 16:28

Fähndrich's appointment is indeed surprising. UEFA tried to push him but it looked like they quickly switched to Schnyder. Now this appointment came out of nothing - maybe not exactly Colombo's case but still.

Rosetti continues with appointing Bastien to potentially hot games. I expected something bigger (and easier) for him after his last performance but CZEALB is both important and most likely difficult.

Chiffi is back in a maybe not so big but potentially hot game. Mariani in SVKSWE where both teams will try their best to advance from League C - good test for him!

Colombo is very overrated even in Serie A IMO and this is quite unanderstandable. Still a lot to improve to get such a match in Wembley. Also, many other Italian referees are doing much better than him

Jonas9 October 2024 at 10:33

This is indeed an incredible surprise. This game is expected to be hot, since a lot of players with Albanian roots play for Switzerland. And there are big controversal games in the past. Swiss media has talked about this game already for quite a long time. I expected a very experienced elite referee for this clash.

Chefren9 October 2024 at 10:40

This is how Rosetti works. Particular treatment for Italian national team and clubs and of course excellent appointments for all Italian referees, regardless of their status, current form and so on, it seems they can do eveything.

M9 October 2024 at 10:41

Wow, no big name such as Marciniak or Turpin?

Wow,UEFA with huge risk appointing Sozza for this not potentially hot,but very hot match.

Ref889 October 2024 at 10:42

Isn’t it bizarre how many Italian crews are appointed. It might be just me, but I really get the feeling they are overrepresented sometimes, in all the leagues. Compared to Spain and England.

And of course, the fact that the Italians don’t have any development/path at all. Being “decent” in domestic league is enough. However, skills and management in their domestic league do not always work with e.g. Nordic countries. It requires development, time and understanding.

Mikael W9 October 2024 at 11:39

One should split the 'Italo-favouritism' appointments into two different groups.

'Ceremonial' -> a perfect example of this concept is Colombo to England-Greece; surely a very prestigious occasion for the young Italian to ref a competitive match at Wembley, but in reality the game will (probably) resemble a friendly international and not offer much challenge to the officials. It gives a chance to 'build' a palmares for a referee in the future. This, imo, is the worse of the two formats - how is it fair for (insert Italian here) to get this chance ahead of somebody else?!

'Fire-fighting' -> this is slightly different and is a well-worn concept going back to the 1980s time when famous names Franchi and Campanati had huge influence; it is just a fact that Serie A referees are (or, were?) of a higher standard than other Western leagues, and thus better at handling delicate matches as a consequence.

Sozza's designation comes very much into the latter category but -- while one can't be sure if the game in Leskovac will bring the same level of difficulty that Brych and Rapallini faced -- is one that I would consider a misstep, according to his style of refereeing. Let's wait until Saturday before making any further comment.

M9 October 2024 at 11:55

Well ,looking at last Switzerland matches one can say that they have some passionate individuals.

Xhaka,Elvedi Schaer and some others.

Most of their fiery players have Balkan roots and are extra motivated against Serbia.

Given the history of these 2,logical would be to appoint some better and proven ref.
For me,more logical would be to see Zwayer here and Sozza instead of Zwayer.

But common sense is not usual with this Uefa and hopefully game for Sozza wont turn into a blood fest.



Ichigo9 October 2024 at 13:49

@M, still are MD4 to see Turpin, and by the way he was appointed in first slots of the NL. about Marciniak I don't know if he will be appointed because we don't know if he passed the tests.

RvT9 October 2024 at 12:02

Collins said earlier this year... that no one italian on this moment are selected for WC2026.

Rosetti is desperate and know a lot appointments of the italians .. and try dont have a second Collina or Rizzoli.

Ref889 October 2024 at 13:37

Is not going to happen. There will be more teams at WC2026, thus more officials as well. I hate to say it, but you can be sure that Rosetti/Collina will do everything to have one Italian on board; probably the referee with the best form in domestic league, regardless of the international path.

And I agree with @Mikael that Colombo at Wembley is an unfair treatment. It won’t be a fierce game indeed, hence it would be more fair to give the opportunity to referees from smaller countries without stadiums of a certain capacity. Why should there be an Italian at Wembley if they can experience an atmosphere like “San Siro” domestically.
Give it to an experienced Cat.1 from a smaller football nation.

MARIO9 October 2024 at 16:04

I'm personally a little out of the chorus and I only partially agree with most of the above comments. I also find very wired most of the appointments, especially Colombo in England-Greece and Zwayer in Gibralter, but watching globally all of them I really don't see a special attention to Italian referees. In MD1 and MD2 CL we got some debuts and many new names like as Walsh, Martinez Munuera, Lindhout, Saggi and so on; as well Brooks and Sozza have been appointed in big matches of EL. And now in NL we only have 5 Elite referees while the remaining are name like Harvey (ghost) or Dabanovic (new perspective ?). So watching all the appointments done so far since begin of september I really don't see a specific treatment towards Italian, but a correct strategy to find new names and to launch new referees in the Arena of the big matches. Don't forget that Soares Dias, Orsato, Collum and Koulbakov left the panel; Hategan, Jovanovic, Gil manzano and Sanchez Martinez seem no more reliable; Sidiropolus, Grinfeeld aren't real elite and few years ago Uefa has lost big names like as Mateu lahoz, Del Cerro Grande Brych and Cakir. Uefa really needs a new generation of top referees and it can be created only pushing them on big match, even taking the risk to make mistakes. So, to me, assignment like as Sozza and Chiffi are not a special reward to italian football but a common change of strategy to build up a new generation of top officials, like as the assignments done for Saggi, LIndhout, Walsh, Nobre, Osmers, Obrenovic. One could compare the act that more new names from Italy are selected respect to France or England, but that's only due to the contingent situation: France has Turpin and Letexier at top level, England has Oliver and Turpin, Italy no one at their level. I'm extremely glad and exited by the new strategy adopted by Rosetti after the Euro 2024: it's the right time to change and to move on to a new elite class

Philipp S9 October 2024 at 20:26

Hm, but a "correct strategy" would be:
Second group / youth games and club qualifiers
-> First Conference League games and NL league C/D
-> First Europa League games
-> Promotion to First Group
-> Regular EL games and NL league B
-> First Champions League games and EL KO games
-> Promotion to Elite
-> Regular CL games and NL league A
-> CL KO games and consideration for big tournaments

And you have to show good performances on each step for at least a year before you reach the next step.
At the moment, we are quite far away from such a logical system with appointments not really considering the category and sometimes skipping several of those steps.

Forlan9 October 2024 at 17:51

Quite disappointing for Croatian referees so far, being assigned as VAR duos on 3 different games for referees from Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro, but no main referee in any game.

Also an unusual situation that Mario Zebec, who is allegedly removed from the list of referees in the 1st Croatian league after a very bad mistake (foul whistled too early as the ball was entering the goal, so VAR wasnt able to intervene and revert the decision), is appointed as VAR.

Very quiet game so far for Eskas, but right now OFR for a SFP, the Norwegian had wrongly assessed the tackle only as reckless.
Absolutely correct call by the Dutch VAR.

Chefren10 October 2024 at 22:10

In 62' a potential penalty for Belgium, desperate tackle from behind in penalty area, Eskas assigned a corner kick after a consultation with assistant referee. Very long check by VAR, but no intrervention. To me, it looked like a penalty and I can't see the touch on ball justifying the corner kick given by referee. Should have been penalty, I think, but maybe Dieperink from the VAR without an evidence.

Now, possible penalty for handball. I‘m a bit surprised by the non-intervention. For me the defender‘s arm is too far away from his body. And as I know the Italian strict handball opinion, Eskås will be the talking point afterwards, won‘t he?

Chefren10 October 2024 at 22:43

It was not arm but another part of body, otherwise clear penalty.

Difficult to make an assessment about Eskas, I think that as long as the game was quiet, he didn't have troubles at all, but when it turned into a more challenging one, due to the sending off (missed live) and the number of fouls increasing, he didn't look to be always in full control.
About the crucial incidents, he needed VAR for the serious foul play, then the possible penalty in 62' is another point for discussion (I think he failed in making a direct assessment there) and finally the possible penalty for handball was a correct decision, no arm, but rather body of the player. Still, in very crucial moments, he didn't convince that everything was OK, but again, to be underlined the difficulty of the game. Good to make experience, for sure, but he has further areas for improvement.

Here the very controversial PLAY ON call by Norwegian referee.
For sure he didn't have opportunity to make a live assessment, it's clear he was surprised by the quickness of the action and he relied on assistant referee. Big responsibility for VAR to say this wasn't a clear and obvious mistake. I don't see clearly the defender touch justifying the corner kick then assigned, but maybe this is not enough alone to say it was clear and obvious mistake.

Chefren11 October 2024 at 21:16

No GLT, indeed. VAR in case with the analysis of a possible goal.

pita falta12 October 2024 at 11:30

Referee who lacks tactical sensitivity, keeps his eyes on the red number 3 as he throws and even a second later.
Then he notices that the attacker is sprinting towards the area and referee snaps to make up for lost ground.
The shot then is to be commended, even reaching the goal line, very generous but still arriving late.
I would say he lacked tactical reading in a clear way. He makes poor use of his excellent fitness

Definitely not aware of the foul, very lazy approach to the player who had committed it. Also AR2 should have helped.
I think you can support No red card and VAR should be right in sdtaying silent, but missing YC is a very big mistake that committee will not like.
Having a certain elegant style in managing the game, Mariani has not the best skills regarding crucial decisions, one must say, we can't remember a game he ended without at least a controversial situation. After Lille - Real Madrid, this one, a very dark YC close to RC. I think he made many efforts, but the reality quality of an Elite referee still doesn't belong to him.

Absolutely correct decision, with a full focus. But the second touch was not 8 meter where the free kick was given, rather it was in 12-15 meter from the line.

Chefren11 October 2024 at 21:59

One must praise this decision before all the rest, for sure.
I'm convinced the very good referees are the ones who can take such decisions when a totally unexpected and rare situation, happens. You don't expect, you don't have any focus, in most of cases (I'm sure about what I'm saying) some don't even know how to punish a certain infringment. So let's praise the Swiss for this decision. Surely missing it would have been evident, but we see many cases in which referees don't want to complicate their games. In this regard, I want to add that in the recent matchdays of serie A, we saw a couple of deliberate backpass to keepers, but none of them was punished accordingly. I think because referees don't feel comfortable when they have to manage the indirect free kick inside the penalty area, and we know how much it's hard.
A very positive point for the Swiss referee, certainly new to such games, as we discussed earlier on the blog. Maybe helped by AR2 as well.

Much controversy now in the Pudkas Arena. First a yc for Hungary where a rc was asked by the dutch players. Yc for protest for the captain van Dijk, while he as captain was the only one allowed to talk to the referee. The other protesting players got nothing. Minute 79 the correct 2nd yellow card for van dijk

Quilava11 October 2024 at 22:44

I think all actions by Fähndrich were justified there.

-Fiola on Malen foul is a YC (SPA, not DOGSO, there was another Hungarian player around, foul is cynical but not a tackle-as-an-attack)
-First YC for van Dijk was justified, despite being the captain (running +30m just to complain)
-Correct 2YC for van Dijk for SPA.

marko11 October 2024 at 22:52

After the incident Fahndrich lost the control a little bit I think. This is why need Elite referees for this kind of matches. While the Swiss is a talented one, bit it was a big step.

Unknown11 October 2024 at 23:01

I disagree with the first YC being justified. As the captain he should be allowed to go to the referee, even from 30+ meter. IMO he didn’t do that while gesturing heavily or shouting to the referee, he only made a gesture towards goal (pointing out a DOGSO). I think it’s a too harsh caution.

Very interesting position at 90th min for Chiffi. He pointed for first penalty for Turkiye but within two seconds he changed to free kick against Türkiye. He clearly pointed penalty kick (normally to me not a penalty), Turkish players were celebrating for a penalty after that it created a brawl ended up two players booked from both teams.

The attitude of NED captain by protesting with referee, when he got his first YC, was absolutely bad. Aggressive, not the way he should talk to the officials. Excellent YC issued by the Swiss for me, in a classic situation in which other referees would have closed their eyes. But yes, once again, the problem is consistency. Many people can say he was just wrong because the player was the captain...

Unknown why German player was booked, I think referee thought easily about mutual misconducts but without having the evidence in front of his eyes. Significant mistake for the French. I'm very curious about next assignment, should be no more than EL, maybe ECL, also possible to skip two matchdays (but hard to believe).

Min 4 - Clear RC for violent conduct and Var intervention should have been made.
Min 60 - Borderline YC/RC. For me in any case - No intervention, no leg bending as it seems more of a step on foot but still some part of the studs a little higher.
Min 64 - Clear SFP and an Intervention by Var. Clear studs aboce ankle and a leg bending image.

Watched Nalbandyan's first half, wasn't impressed to be honest. Inconsistent foul detection, some of the free kicks he gave I didn't understand for what exactly. Also would like to see NI disallowed goal again, the whistle was before the shot on goal so VAR couldn't intervene but again I didn't see any attacking foul. But may be I am wrong watched only once this moment.

Here the whistle before the goal scored.
https://streambug.org/cv/d49035
Technically, you can't say disallowed goal because he whistled before, but not clear indeed what he wanted to punish. I think he was following the couples of players close to him, he indicated a holding with this gesture, but how many times you see that and hard to believe that it must be assessed as clear foul. Moreover, for VAR purposes, he should have waited for the possible goal scored, or at least he should have followed the play, showing also more focus on what was happening in penalty area.


GRef13 October 2024 at 11:37

I dont see any foul here anyways. Even if there is any holding which I guess it the reason he is whistling - this is a A national team game. Football understanding must be at higher level. Soft fouls is no good and in this case he got unlucky.

Inside vs. outside?: https://streambug.org/cv/562c3b

Switzerland were rightly given one penalty and probably ought to have been given another but Pairetto probably acted correctly (no CLEAR and unambiguous evidence that the tripping was outside). There was also a disallowed goal for offside early in the second half. Overall, if one supports Sozza at 84', then it was a fine performance in this delicate context.

84' Very interesting situation. Possible penalty for SUI. Outside or inside penalty area?

Chefren12 October 2024 at 22:57

According to one replay, it looks clearly correct decision by Sozza, outside, but then the other replays definitly don't help us. It looks also inside. I think that referees can't be penalized in such situations, you see how much difficult is for VAR as well.

Whistle212 October 2024 at 23:50

Mikael W13 October 2024 at 00:23

(my above comment should read 'inside'^^).

In theory, by the 'screenshot' method you could even construe the penalty given as DOGSO-noattempt, but with 'football understanding' you realise that N'Doye never had any attempt to run with the ball to goal and instead only tried to win a foul off Nedelkovic by placing himself between the ball and the Serb before slowing down; the defender obliged by committing a careless push, despite N'Doye never having had any chance in reality to bring the ball under control. Sozza probably never even computed a potential DOGSO and he was right so to do: penalty and no sanction.

GRef13 October 2024 at 11:40

Challenging final for Gozubuyuk, penalty appeal by Poland when game was on open score, a moment before the action in which Portugal scored 3-1 on a counterattack with an own goal. Big protests, but personally once again I didn't fully understand the Dutch gestures, he did not immediately seem to signal for the goal scored, but it looked like as if he had indicated the previous situation and then he immediately put his hand on the earphone to get info from VAR about what to do. In my opinion he should be more mentally free on the pitch, he never gives the impression of having made a clear and extremely firm decision, he is often shaky. Here with clear gestures he should have indicated the goal regardless of the rest, then if it had been a penalty on the other side, VAR would have called fio it. In any case, very good to caution the home players for protests, but, as usual, he appeared agitated and lost his composure once involved in very crucial moments.

That is unfortunately a recurring theme for him.

He made good progression in recent years, with Zeinstra at his side. KNVB is publishing a 4-part series ("Behind the whistle") this month. In the episode with Gozubuyuk I was pleasantly surprised by his player management and communication: https://youtu.be/bMGbhQfRdb0

To reach European top, he has to improve his main weaknesses (take crucial decisions, signaling, selling the decisions to the audience) though.
