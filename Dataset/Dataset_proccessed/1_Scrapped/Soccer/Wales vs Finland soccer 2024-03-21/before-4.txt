<image:caption>If we're going to talk shame and blame, let's talk about Oprah. More specifically, let's talk about the one-hour infomercial she just did for Ozempic, Wegovy and Big Pharma, pushing controversial weight-loss drugs on the general public, including children.</image:caption>
</image:image>
<image:image>

<image:caption>This was more about the central conflict of Oprah's life, her weight-loss struggles, rather than what these drugs mean for public health, or our understanding of obesity, and whether the potential side effects ¿ you know, minor complications like pancreatitis or cancer ¿ are worth the risk.</image:caption>
</image:image>

<image:caption>'I took on the shame that the world gave to me,' Oprah said of her former figure. (Pictured: in 1988).</image:caption>

<image:caption>Well, she also took on ten percent of Weight Watchers stock in 2015, becoming the face of a company that advocated portion control and exercise, making $400 million in the process. (Pictured: in 1992).</image:caption>

<image:caption>And after publicly insisting, as recently as last July, that she would never use a weight-loss jab because that would be 'the easy way out', Oprah was forced to admit that yes, she had been using a drug - which one, she has never said - after dropping forty pounds in mere months.</image:caption>

<image:caption>'I'm absolutely done with the shaming,' she says. 'For 25 years, making fun of my weight was national sport'. And yet, no mention that she participated in very publicly making herself a laughingstock - including when she wheeled out 67 bags of animal fat to represent how much she first lost in 1988.</image:caption>
