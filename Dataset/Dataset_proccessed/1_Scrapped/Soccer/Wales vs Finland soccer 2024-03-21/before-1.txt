There are oodles of reasons to get excited about this betweeny season of warmer (likely) but not hot (probably) weather. In this week’s cover story we present you with 99 — from art and theater events to concerts, literary events, foodie fun and, of course, holidays like Free Comic Book Day. Also on the cover Symphony New Hampshire performs the music of video games in “Game Over(Ture): A Symphonic Journey Through the Music of Video Games” which will be performed this weekend (page 16). Check out our listing of Easter-related food specials — from places to dine in on the day (Sunday, March 31) to places offering special eats to go. (And speaking of Easter, check out the rundown of egg hunts starting on page 20.) And add your laughs when comedian Mike Koutrobis records his comedy special on Saturday at the Nashua Center for the Arts.
