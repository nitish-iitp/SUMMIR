Kazakhstan, to win again

For their part, Russia's Stanislav Cherchésov, ranked 109th in the FIFA rankings, will be looking to show why they have been promoted to the UEFA Nations League B, which they have so far failed to demonstrate, sitting bottom of their group with just one point after drawing with Norway and losing to Slovenia.

They will also be looking to get back to winning ways, having last beaten Turkmenistan 2-0 in a friendly on 14 March. However, in an official game, the last one was on 17 November last year when they beat San Marino 3-1 in the Euro qualifiers.
