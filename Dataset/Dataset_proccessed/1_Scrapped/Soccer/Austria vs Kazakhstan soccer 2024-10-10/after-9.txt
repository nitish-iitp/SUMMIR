UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE ROUND-UP: HAALAND BECOMES NORWAY ALL-TIME TOP SCORER, IRELAND BEAT FINLAND, FRANCE THRASH ISRAEL
BYCONOR KEENAN

UPDATED 10/10/2024 AT 22:24 GMT

Erling Haaland broke a 90-year-old record to become his country's all-time top goalscorer after netting a brace in Norway's comfortable 3-0 win over Slovenia. Elsewhere, France swept past Israel with a 4-1 win in League A, Austria hammered Kazakhstan 4-0 in League B and the Republic of Ireland earned their first win under boss Heimir Hallgrimsson with a late 2-1 victory over Finland in Helsinki.

Erling Haaland broke a 90-year-long goal scoring record for his country in a busy night of UEFA Nations League action which saw dominant victories for both France and Austria, while the Republic of Ireland beat Finland via a last-gasp Robbie Brady goal.

WALES BEAT REPUBLIC OF IRELAND TO QUALIFY FOR EURO 2025, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND KNOCKED OUT

03/12/2024 AT 22:21

The Manchester City front-man took just seven minutes to open his account for the night, tapping home unmarked in the box after a fantastic save by goalkeeper Jan Oblak kept out a long-range effort on goal. Fellow striker and former Crystal Palace man Alexander Sorloth doubled the hosts' lead in Oslo seven minutes into the second half.
Wearing the captain’s armband in the absence of the injured Martin Odegaard, Haaland swept home the record-breaking goal to break Jorgen Juve’s record of 35 goals, which the latter had held since 1934.
Norway now lead the way in Group 3 of League B, amassing seven points from their opening three games.  
BRADY STRIKES LATE AGAIN TO EARN VALUABLE IRISH WIN
Robbie Brady struck another important late goal for his country as the Republic of Ireland earned their first competitive international victory in 360 days with a dramatic 2-1 win over Finland in Helsinki.
A poor back-pass from captain Nathan Collins gifted the hosts an opener after 17 minutes, with Venezia’s Joel Pohjanpalo slotting his finish past a helpless Caoimhin Kelleher in the Irish net.

Ireland huffed and puffed in the first half but failed to create many meaningful chances. However, they should have been level midway through the half after Evan Ferguson tapped in following Collins’ header back across the box from a Brady free kick. The linesman’s flag was raised, seemingly for offside, with the decision confirmed by VAR despite replays showing Collins was in an onside position and looked to have successfully kept the ball in play at the byline.
Ireland came out stronger in the second half, with Liam Scales’ first international goal leveling the scores before the hour mark. Another dangerous free kick delivery from Brady met the head of the Celtic defender, who guided his header into the far corner past a helpless Lukas Hradecky.
Brady would become the Irish hero for the night two minutes from time, smashing home at the back post after a wonderful run and cross from substitute Festy Ebosele.
The win was the first of Heimir Hallgrimsson’s reign as manager after taking over from Stephen Kenny this summer, as Ireland climbed to third in League B Group 2.
FRANCE HIT ISRAEL FOR FOUR
France comfortably dispatched Israel 4-1 in their Nations League A Group 2 game in Hungary.
Real Madrid’s Eduardo Camavinga opened the scoring before an unlikely equaliser for Israel came through Omri Gandelman 24 minutes into the first half.
Israel were level for only four minutes, with Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku restoring the French lead with a slick finish underneath the body of Omri Glazer after 28 minutes. France continued to dominate the game, but the Israeli defence kept their side in the game until the latter stages of the second half.
Former Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi secured the win for France, coolly finishing from the edge of the box after a lovely layoff from the left wing by Theo Hernandez. Guendouzi then became the provider two minutes later, sliding in PSG’s Bradley Barcola to score his second international goal in a devastatingly quick attacking move.
The result leaves Israel rooted to the bottom of Group 2 in League A, with France now one point behind Italy in second following the Azzurri's 2-2 draw with Belgium.
AUSTRIA CRUISE PAST KAZAKHSTAN IN LINZ
Austria cruised to a dominant 4-0 win over Kazakhstan in the other Group 2 game in League B.
RB Leipzig’s Christoph Baumgartner opened the scoring in Linz as the hosts took a 1-0 lead into the break. The lead was doubled eight minutes into the second half via Philipp Lienhart, with former Manchester United midfielder and Austria captain Marcel Sabitzer adding another with a right-footed curling finish from the edge of the box only a few minutes later.

Matthias Seidl notched his first goal for his country to cap off the scoring eleven minutes from time, hammering home on the half volley after a smart knockdown header from Marko Arnautovic presented him with the chance.
Austria move to second in Group 3 of League B, level on points with Slovenia but with a superior goal difference.
