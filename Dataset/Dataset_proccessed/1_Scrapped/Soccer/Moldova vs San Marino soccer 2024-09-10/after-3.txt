Forza Titani: San Marino’s journey to their first competitive win
A detailed look at the competitive story of the San Marino national team as they finally secured their first competitive victory after a decades-long wait for success.

The story of the San Marino national team is one that can be defined by the tale of the ultimate underdog and an ability to never quit, no matter how bad it gets.

Having a population of just under 34,000, this microstate was never meant to be a footballing powerhouse.

This is proven by the national team’s inability to win a competitive game in their entire history, a fact changed on 6th September 2024, when on one night in Seravalle, a goal from Nicko Sensoli secured San Marino’s first-ever competitive victory in a UEFA Nations League match against Liechtenstein in what can only be described as a joyous occasion for both the people of San Marino and football fans alike.

The journey to this point was far from easy however, so with this in mind, let’s take a look back at the history of the San Marino national team up to this point and see just how they reached such an usually stunning high point in their unique history.

The Early Days: Struggling to find their feet:
 

The competitive journey of the San Marino national team began in 1990, with the country competing in qualifying for UEFA Euro 92, their first venture into qualifying for a major tournament.

The opening game set the tone for the rest of the group (and indeed the majority of their history), with La Serinissima losing 4-0 against Switzerland at the Stadio Olympico in Seravalle, with the following matches proving to be just as tough thanks to the likes of Scotland and Bulgaria making light work of the minnows, ensuring they finished bottom of the group and without a point in the process.

However, their sole moment of joy in this campaign would come in their qualifier against Romania in Seravalle, with Valdes Pasolini’s penalty giving the side their first ever goal in a moment that would set the tone for the majority of the team’s current history.

Next up was qualifying for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a campaign that followed the theme of the previous one, starting with a humiliating 10-0 loss to Norway in Oslo.

This campaign’s biggest triumph would be a 0-0 draw in the home qualifier against Turkiye, a result that sealed the side’s first ever point in a competitive game, whilst also showing that they were determined to not always be the whipping boys.

Another slight moment of joy would come in the campaign’s final game after a scuffed clearance from Stuart Pearce allowed Davide Gualtieri to give La Serinissima a shock 1-0 lead over England that ultimately went some way to preventing the Three Lions from qualifying for the tournament.

UEFA Euro 96 qualifying wouldn’t be as fruitful, with goals in Helsinki and Seravelle during 4-1 and 3-1 defeats to Finland and the Faroe Islands respectively being the sole highlights of a dismal campaign that again saw San Marino rooted to the foot of the table and without a single point.

Qualifying for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 wouldn’t be much better as the Sanmarinese again failed to get a point in the board in either campaign alongside failing to score a single goal in the former of the two.

The latter campaign however would offer a glimmer of hope for the side’s future when a young striker by the name of Andy Selva scored his first goal for his country in a 4-1 defeat to Austria, a goal that seemed insignificant at the time, but would ultimately be the start of possibly the biggest individual legacy in the team.

Points, goals and the Selva effect: A glimmer of hope:
 

As the new millennium got into gear, so did San Marino’s renewed hopes of success, starting with qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, a campaign that whilst ending the same way as the others, was one of the more fruitful ones so far for La Serinissima after a Selva wondergoal in a 10-1 defeat to Belgium was later followed up by a 1-1 draw in Latvia that sealed the team’s first-ever competitive away point in a real moment of progress.

Belgium proved to be a very lucky opponent for the side in particular, with Selva following his up his effort in Brussels with another goal in the return game in Seravalle to get his second goal of the campaign and San Marino’s third, making this qualifying run their best yet.

Unfortunately though, qualifying for UEFA Euro 2004 did everything to halt any momentum the side had built up after they lost every game and didn’t score a goal in the process.

Nestled at the back of this campaign however is a result that would be a signal of great things to come, this being an exciting 2-2 draw against fellow minnows Liechtenstein in Vaduz in a friendly, a game in which goals from Alex Gasperoni and Nicola Ciacci saw La Serinissima come from two goals down, scoring twice in a game for the first time ever in the process.

Then in 2004, history would be made when a free-kick from Selva gave San Marino their first-ever victory, a 1-0 triumph over the aforementioned Liechtenstein that built on the result the previous year, whilst also cementing the legacies of Selva and the entire team in Sanmarinese folklore.

The victory may have meant nothing to the competitive record, but it meant everything to the team, giving them the momentum to push on and find that first competitive victory.

Failure To Capitalise: A run best forgotten:
 

It would have been a reasonable assumption back in 2004 that following the Liechtenstein victory, San Marino could have used the momentum to find any inkling of form and secure some more victories, but it couldn’t have been more of the opposite case.

Qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup again failed to come up with a single point for La Serinissima, with the only notable moment being the milestone of the side scoring in consecutive fixtures for the first time ever during their defeats to Belgium and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the goals both coming from Selva.

UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying couldn’t have started in a much worse fashion, with San Marino hosting 2006 World Cup hosts and semi-finalists Germany in a game that can simply described as a demolition job that saw the visitors defeat their lowly hosts 13-0, including hat-tricks from Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose that condemned La Serinissima to their biggest ever defeat.

The rest of this campaign wasn’t much better as the team again finished without a point in the group, with a heartbreaking loss via a last minute Stephen Ireland goal against the Republic of Ireland and a goal for Selva against Wales being the only slight highlights of another dismal showing.

2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying wasn’t much better as the the team once again finished bottom of their qualifying group, even with a Selva goal against Slovakia to shout about, whilst UEFA Euro 2012 provided more of the same, but this time without a single goal.

This consistent run of terrible qualifying campaigns after the victory in 2004 left many wondering if La Serinissima would ever win another game, let alone a competitive fixture, something they would have to wait a long time to find out.

Hope Amongst Pain: More of the same, but with another glimpse of hope:

After yet another disappointing attempt at qualification for a major tournament with Euro 2012, San Marino’s attention turned to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

A slight ray of joy showed itself prior to this campaign, with a narrow 3-2 friendly loss to Malta in Seravalle showing that La Serinissima still had the ability to compete with the teams in and around their level.

However, their group for 2014 World Cup qualifying failed to allow an opportunity to prove this as a very difficult group could only yield a single goal courtesy of Alessandro Della Valle against Poland, whilst the rest of the games produced no points.

The following campaign to qualify for UEFA Euro 2016 would become a huge turning point for the side, with a 0-0 draw against Estonia in Seravalle providing the team with their first result other than a defeat since that famous night in 2004, whilst later in the group, they would again find themselves the victims of a late goal, with Lithuania stealing a victory in Vilnius despite an impressive Sanmarinese equaliser from Matteo Vitaioli.

By the time qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup came about, San Marino were used to the general routine of finishing bottom of the group and maybe with the odd point or goal, but with very little sustained success, proven by their two goals in this latest qualifying group being their only highlights.

However, following this campaign, a potential lifeline to any Sanmarinese hopes of glory would come in the form of the UEFA Nations League, with the 2018-19 campaign seeing La Serinissima put up a good effort against Moldova, Belarus and Luxembourg, but ultimately they would come up short of a competitive victory yet again.

However, this new competition’s format worked in the side’s favour and would prove to be a turning point that would eventually lead to the moment that supporters all around the world had been waiting for….

The Hopes Are Realised: Consistent highs and the long awaited moment of glory:  

Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2020 soon came around, with San Marino now long without the services of record scorer Selva and looking for a new piece of inspiration that could guide them to glory.

Unfortunately however, this campaign failed to show any real progress as La Serinissima could only score a single goal in this campaign thanks to an effort from Filippo Berardi against Kazakhstan.

Following this campaign, the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 meant that it would be a whole 10 months before the team would play another match as they began their 2020-21 UEFA Nations League campaign in a favourable group with Gibraltar and  Liechtenstein, a group that saw San Marino pick up more than a point for the first time ever as they managed two 0-0 draws, one against each side.

As fans slowly returned to stadiums everywhere, qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup began in a fashion that La Serinissima know all too well, with a thumping at the hands of England.

The rest of the group was again a mostly demoralising display, but this campaign is also seen as a turning point thanks to a goal from Nicola Nanni against Poland, a goal that became seen as a real show of progress for a team that used to struggle to score against any opponent, let alone an established and moderately successful side.

The 2022-23 UEFA Nations League campaign failed to be as kind to the team as a group consisting of themselves, Estonia and Malta quickly reduced any hopes of a competitive win coming at this time with a convincing 4-0 loss to the former of the two teams in Seravalle just about summing it up.

However, a rejuvenated San Marino side arrived at qualifying for UEFA Euro 2024 with a point to prove as they managed to concede fewer goals than expected in their opening games of the campaign against Northern Ireland and Slovenia, only conceding two in each game.

The campaign trundled on and with the regular theme of defeat, but a second half equaliser from Alessandro Golinucci in La Serinissima’s qualifier against Denmark in Seravalle would mark the start of a record breaking streak, despite losing that particular game.

The team’s next qualifier against Kazakhstan saw a second consecutive goal thanks to Simone Franciosi, before the final game of the campaign against Finland saw Berardi score a late penalty to ensure San Marino had managed to create a new team record, scoring in three successive games for the first time in their history, another high in a team that seemed to be improving significantly.

After a run of friendlies against St Kitts & Nevis, Slovakia and Cyprus, the 2024-25 Nations League saw La Serinissima drawn into a familiar group as they once again found themselves facing Liechtenstein and Gibraltar in a golden opportunity to get that first competitive victory after all the improvements that the team had made.

The first game arrived, with the former of the two sides the visitors to Seravalle.

After surviving an offside goal in the first half, the hosts capitalised as Sensoli scored to send both the players and the supporters into a state of delirium before managing to hold on amidst consistent pressure from Liechtenstein to seal a 1-0 victory, sending the whole stadium into celebration and confirming that San Marino had won their first ever competitive game — a stat made all the more impressive by the fact it was against the same team they’d won their first match full stop against back in 2004.

Conclusion: The spirit of the beautiful game:

The story of San Marino is truly a rare case in football.

This tiny nation that finds itself wedged inside Italy and the players that represent it on the pitch have captured the hearts of fans outside their borders and support has stemmed from some places that they could never have imagined.

This victory is simply the culmination of a team and a nation’s constant effort to improve and to give their supporters something to be proud of, no matter the odds.

This team never gave up and have received a much-deserved reward for their effort, now let’s hope they can press on and create more memories for those who have dedicated their time waiting for this moment and if they do, who knows where they could go?

The moment itself and the general question of just what could follow it for the entire team is part of what is quite simply, the beauty of football.
