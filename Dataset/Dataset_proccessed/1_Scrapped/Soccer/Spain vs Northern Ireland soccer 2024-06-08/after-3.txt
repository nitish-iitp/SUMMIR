Spain turned in a stunning display against Northern Ireland, despite an early blip, and sent a message to their fellow Euro 2024 contenders.

TELL ME MORE

Spain looked to flex their muscles ahead of Euro 2024 against Northern Ireland and did so, in powerful fashion, as they sent a message to the rest of the continent on Saturday evening.

Amazingly, though, within 70 seconds, Dan Ballard, the Sunderland defender, gave the visitors a stunning lead, sending a looping header into the back of the net from a set-piece.

But Spain quickly righted their course, and Pedri slammed an effort into the bottom corner from 25 yards, leaving Bailey Peacock-Farrell with no chance.

Spain were ahead soon after, as Alvaro Morata headed in Jesus Navas' floated cross.

Just before the half-hour mark, Spain added a third when Nico Williams found Pedri in the box with a clever cross, and he made no mistake. An absolutely beautiful Lamine Yamal cross then found Fabian Ruiz before half-time, and he finished coolly from close-range to give Spain a 4-1 lead.

And a fifth came in the second half, Mikel Oyarzabal finishing in scruffy fashion after Yamal's cross.

THE MVP

Pedri was absolutely superb. His ability in midfield is remarkable and Northern Ireland couldn't get near him. Not only did he score an absolutely sensational goal from range, he added a second with a striker's finish after ghosting into the box. Adding goals to his game is the final piece of the puzzle; Europe better beware.

THE BIG LOSER

Spain's opponents in Group B will not have been enthused by this performance. In a week in which the favourites have faltered - England lost to Iceland, Portugal were beaten by Croatia and Germany needed a last-minute winner against Greece - Spain purred. They will face tougher challenges, particularly in a group that also includes Italy and the Croatians, but this was such a dynamic, electric performance. You simply have to see them as one of the favourites at Euro 2024.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Spain head into the tournament proper on the back of a big win. They kick off their campaign on June 15 against Croatia, in a game that may be rather more finely poised.
