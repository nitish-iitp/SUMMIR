This comment section is open for any non-work-related discussion you’d like to have with other readers, by popular demand.

Here are the rules for the weekend posts.

Book recommendation of the week: Within Arm’s Reach, by Ann Napolitano. Told from alternating perspectives, it’s the story of three generations of a large Irish-Catholic family that is forever changed when the matriarch becomes ill and one granddaughter unexpectedly gets pregnant.

The weekend posts are for relatively light discussion and comments should ask questions and/or seek to discuss ideas. Recommendations or one to two updates on things you received advice about in the past are fine, but “here’s what happened to me today” personal-blog-style posts are not. We also can’t do medical advice here.

Please give the full rules a re-read if it’s been a while!

I’m reading Divine Might by Natalie Haynes. Following up on her book about women in Greek myth (recommended many times here), this is her book about goddesses in Greek myth. I’m really enjoying it; she writes with her usual snarky style but clearly loves the classic authors she’s quoting and is fond of the goddesses she discusses even if she knows they can be dangerous. Would definitely recommend.

I am reading The Familiar by Leigh Bardugo. It’s fun! I like that the reader knows as little as the character does regarding all the politicking and the machinations of the side characters, it creates some solid intrigue. And I think this is a subtle redo of many of the tropes that were poorly executed in the author’s flagship trilogy (IYKYK): a young woman is unexpectedly vaulted into the social, religious, and martial limelight due to magical abilities she’s long suppressed. I find this point of view and narration much less tiresome.

I have never been able to get into Leigh Bardugo — Ninth House should have been right up my alley, but their protagonists felt very fanficcy in the “world revolves around them while they snark irritatingly at a distance” sense. Maybe this is a sign to give it another go! I like VE Schwab, after all :p

I just finished To Be Loved, a memoir by trauma therapist Frank Anderson. I have mixed feelings about it.

Nevertheless, I know a great deal of effort went into writing it so I appreciate the effort.

Just read Pandora’s Jar this week and very much enjoyed it! And speaking of recs from here, I’m in the middle of Rust in the Root and having fun. Y’all, I am *such* a giant sucker for the trope of hey, I’m just nobody, but oh wow, I have amazing powers! That probably also ties into my love of fairy tales and fairy tale retellings.

In last week’s thread, someone asked about reading books during certain seasons. I usually don’t time my books that way, but I did read the novella Last Night at the Lobster (about the last day at a closing Red Lobster location told from the manager’s POV) as a toast to my nostalgic feelings about The Red Lobster going bankrupt because of my childhood memories there, even though I’ve been a vegetarian for years now. The story wasn’t anything spectacular, but it perfectly fit what I was looking for.

I’m more or less reading “The Worst Ship In The Fleet” by Skyler Ram.
It’s not a classic, it’s not really art, but it WAS free with my Amazon Prime membership, so it’s got that going for it. It’s a light, kinda funny, kinda cringy (but, so far in a sort of amusing way) syfy book. It’s short and breezy, no real thinking involved. Which actually makes it perfect for little isolated moments where I have a couple of minutes, maybe a half hour, when nothing interesting is happening and I don’t have access to anything more entertaining. Lunch at my desk, long line at the grocery store. That kind of thing.

Continuing with the non-fiction “A Sting in the Tale” by Dave Goulson, an informative and surprisingly entertaining look at bumblebees, from the viewpoint of the author as a very curious child up through his career in international bumblebee conservation efforts. Dry British humor adds to the fascination – I have learned a LOT about bees in general and bumblees in particular.

“Out of Left Field” by John Newman – a semi-autobiographical graphic novel in which a nerdy teen decides to join his high school baseball team, mainly because he thinks the shortstop is really cute. Looks to be a mix of finding-one’s-self/coming-of-age/friendship/romance.

On the creepier side: “Harrow Lake” by Kat Ellis, a novel about a teen whose father, a famous director of horror movies, has disturbingly controlling tendencies that she doesn’t seem to realize (at first). When he winds up in the hospital for a while he sends her to her maternal grandmother’s – an odd move, as they’ve had no contact for most of her life. And as the grandmother lives in the little town that inspired (and was the shooting location for) one of her father’s greatest hits, with her mysteriously-disappeared mother playing the tragic lead… yeah, it’s a kind of meta-horror thing. Atmospheric and creepy, though from the outset I just wanted to get the poor kid into therapy.

I’ve just started Tam Lin by Pamela Dean, that was recommended here last week, and loving it. I knew I would when I read the introduction and Elizabeth Marie Pope’s The Perilous Gard was mentioned–it and her other book, The Sherwood Ring, are two of my most favorite YA novels. Both are historical but in crisp, tart ways that make the subject matter more magical, not less, because the characters are very much intelligent and aware.

Ahhh yay so glad you picked it up!! I also adore Elizabeth Marie Pope, I found old library editions of those two years ago and I think The Sherwood Ring is such a well done “story within a story”, plus, ghosts!

For the Firebird paperback of Tam Lin, Dean did a little note about how this book is one that instead of hanging around and begging for sequels, rushed off and belongs now to the people who love it, which I think is such a lovely image. I will say that while I’ve never gotten around to reading alllll the texts referenced, I did enjoy The Lady’s Not for Burning years ago, and have seen a great production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead (and later discovered Arcadia which is probably my favorite play ever). But it would be fun to have a Tam Lin book club someday where we read the books and poems referenced. In her Secret Country trilogy she uses bits of poetry as spells and I love that so much.

Sipsworth, by Simon van Booy. It’s really a beautiful book. The language describing the inner life of the elderly main character is gorgeous and insightful.

Nearing the end, I think the plot has somewhat gone off the rails, but I loved the first three-quarters. @Alison, I think this is a book that you would enjoy also.

This week, I read “Instruments of Darkness” by John Connolly. It’s the 21st book in the Charlie Parker series. I love the characters so much, and Connolly is a great storyteller and also a great sentence writer. The series is dark with a lot of supernatural elements, and yet, I always feel like climbing into one of the books is like putting on my most comfortable sweater.

Not sure what I’m going to read next – I have several library holds that came in at the same time.

In audiobooks, I got and started Stephen King’s latest “You Like It Darker”. I don’t enjoy reading short stories, but I do enjoy listening to them.

In this world it’s 1922 and Native Americans control certain territories, the story takes place in one of those areas, “the Republic of Deseret” in the city of Cahokia. It follows one of the detectives assigned to the homicide case. It’s very well-written and so far quite good. I’ll probably check out some of Spufford’s other works after I finish it.

The Scholomance is one of my favorite series. Both my spouse and I found it so high stress to read the first time around–she perfectly captures the feeling of being always on edge poised to be attacked as an unpopular kid in high school. Except the monsters really eat you here.

Just finished Suspect by Scott Turow. The main character is the granddaughter of Sandy Stern, Turow’s renowned defense lawyer character. Sadly, the novel is not as good as Turow’s earlier novels.

You Like it Darker by Stephen King.
A collection of 12 short stories that was released this week.
I’ve always thought his short stories were vastly superior to his other horror novels (I like them too). His ability to create characters that are so compelling and facing real world circumstances (It’s not all about killing the monsters, regular people are the monsters) is amazing. Growing up in a small backward town like the ones he writes about, I can relate to his characters and the life issues they face.
I’ve been reading him all my life, since I was a young teen, I think I started with the Shining. I was an advanced reader and quickly went thru the children’s sections (as you can tell by my name) My mother was an avid reader and we visited the library every week during the summer. I’m so lucky that we didn’t have the book banning jerks we have today back in the 70’s. Mom was usually strict but I was allowed to check out whatever I wanted and the librarians were encouraging.
The only difference is that today I will not be reading in the pool and getting a weird sunburn.
This will also be my small (BIG) Joy this week.

If you like that one, also check out Anne Lamott’s Bird By Bird.

Well, I’m almost finished. Haven’t had a book binge like that in a long time. It was spectacular.

Love the idea of keeping the book in the freezer. I used to have a rule not to read his books at night. That’s why I used to read him in the pool. I broke that rule last night, it was after midnight when I stopped. I still have the 2 longest stories to finish.

The Unhoneymooners by Christina Lauren. I am really enjoying how romance lets me turn my brain off for a bit and this was an excellent book for that (a thing I mean sincerely to be a positive thing about it, not a passive aggressive critique of this book specifically or romance in general). Though, given some of the writing earlier in the book, I was surprised at the fade-to-black parts later on that made it less steamy than I was expecting.

It’s a loopy, delightful story of a young woman, who while mired in a series of dead end jobs, reads Treasure Island (RL Stevenson) and decides it is cosmically intended for her, and that she must follow its lessons to improve her life. It’s fast & hilarious, and the suddenly dark & surprising.

I’m reading Widowland by E. J. Carey, which I think was one of Allison’s recommendations. Alternate history in which England struck an alliance with Nazi Germany, the US didn’t enter the war, and women are assigned to castes with the beautiful ones expected to produce babies. It’s not The Handmaid’s Tale redone, although of course you’ll be reminded of that. The main character’s job is to edit all the spunk and independent female thinking out of classic literature so you might say it’s a horror story for us booklovers (although not written as horror). Definitely recommend this one.

Next on my list: City of Stairs by Robert Jackson Bennett. I finished his Foundryside trilogy and wanted to read more of his writing. This is the first in another trilogy. I’m always happy when a writer creates a world I can live in for quite a while, although a brilliant standalone is satisfying too.

Going back to books that have stayed with me in memory, if someone hasn’t read The Book of the Unnamed Midwife and its sequels by Meg Alison, these are *brilliant* and you must read them if post-apocalyptic feminist writing is your bag (and if it is, you’ve likely already read them).

An author recommendation: Sarah Gailey. They’ve written horror, alternate history (River of Teeth with hippos raised as transportation and food animals, based on a real idea to import them into the southern US), and more. Wonderful.

Every weekend I add to my library wish list thanks to all of you. I’m far from retirement but have no worries about what I’ll do with all that time!

Was pleasantly surprised by this one:

The Love of My Life by Rosie Walsh – a psychological thriller featuring a woman whose happy marriage may be threatened by secrets from her past. Lots of use of alternate viewpoints and late-revelations of back-stories – all rather typical of the genre, but this one not only has some interesting twists on the usual type of secrets (and the motives behind hiding things), but ends up considerably better than most such works tend to do. Kind of a cozy thriller?

I just finished Wartime Lies by Louis Begley. I picked it up after hearing that Stanley Kubrick had begun working on a film based on the novel, to be called Aryan Papers, but died before he could complete it (maybe even start filming). A fast and compelling read, though I felt it ended somewhat abruptly, and of course the subject matter is sad and disturbing.

Now I’ve started Everyone on This Train is a Suspect by Benjamin Stevenson. At first I didn’t like the narrator, and the whole meta prelude seemed like it was trying too hard to be clever, but now I’m enjoying it. I also noticed, just based on names, that except for one indigenous character, so far every character seems to be white. I don’t like when authors try to shove in diversity in an obvious and unnecessary way but I’m a little disappointed.

The caterpillars only eat milkweed. The butterflies will eat pretty much anything that has lots of nectar (which includes milkweed flowers but also lots of other flowers). So it’s important to have milkweed around to support the caterpillars and a variety of other plants that bloom throughout the season to support the adult butterflies. Variety is good!

My mom has been looking for something special to do with her fancy laser engraving machine, like family special, and this week she found a handwritten recipe card given to her by my grandma, for HER mom’s (my great-grandma’s) “chocolate fudge picnic cake.” So my mom is going to scan the card and laser my great-grandma’s recipe in my grandma’s handwriting onto a decorative cutting board for me and my siblings.

Plus she sent me a picture of the card, and I actually made the cake tonight and it is EXCELLENT. (I am sending most of it with my husband to his gaming group tomorrow.)

Happy to share!! It’s a literal one pan recipe, not counting your measuring utensils, and no turning out or need for extra frosting, you just take your whole pan full of cake to your picnic and let people scoop some out. I didn’t put the nuts on mine because of allergy issues among the group, but my mom says it’s really good with all kinds of different baking chips, mint or white chocolate or toffee or whatever, to give it different looks and flavor profiles.

Preheat your oven to 350. Layer directly into a 8″ or 9″ cake pan:
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 packets liquid chocolate*
1 egg
1 and 1/4 cup Wondra flour**
1/2 tsp each baking soda and salt
1/2 tsp vanilla
3/4 cup water

Scrape and stir together for about 2 minutes. Sprinkle across the top 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans). Bake for 30 minutes.

*modern substitute: 6 tbsp cocoa powder and 2 tbsp oil
**Substitutes for this particular flour are available online, mostly involving corn starch, but I didn’t have any corn starch either so I did just actually get the real Wondra brand stuff at my grocery store, and it’s somehow pre-cooked so that it thickens but doesn’t clump when you add it to liquid? And it really did mix into this particular recipe better than I think AP flour would’ve done as a result.

I knew there were crows around because I can hear them, but not ravens. I could tell it wasn’t a crow because it was bigger and it croaked instead of cawing. Too bad I didn’t have my phone with me. I’ll make sure to take it with me when I go outside so I can snap a pic if it comes back.

Another neighbor sent her daughter over with a couple of bags of Schwann’s frozen cookie dough and a half-size cookie sheet. That’s an incredibly handy cookie sheet size I didn’t already own and I could bake cookies before I had any of our stuff unpacked.

Yes, my husband and I recently met with a lawyer to update our wills, and she said she always recommends getting at least 20 death certificates.

I am so very sorry for your loss and that you’re dealing with these difficulties on top of losing your sibling.

Please make sure you take some time to breathe, eat, drink, bathe as well. Maybe call some close friends too? The tasks you’re worried about right now will still be there later, so it’s okay to take them slowly.

My friend was dealing with something like this. She wound up hiring a lawyer who was local to where her dead sibling lived, someone who could tell her about the state laws that were in play as well as the federal laws. A local lawyer should be able to talk you through how you get yourself named executor in your sibling’s state and give you a roadmap about what may need to be done (like opening an estate bank account out of which to pay any bills that come in for your sibling and into which to put in any last payments that come in for your sibling, etc). You could also think about hiring a local accountant to deal with your sibling’s last tax returns.

I lived in a neighboring state when my dad died, and I often found it useful to go to his state to deal with things in person, but I think it is possible to subcontract most things that need to be done if you’re willing to pay a fair bit for lawyers, accountants, realtors, estate auctioneers, etc. I arranged to sell my dad’s house almost 100% via phone/e-mail during covid, so it is indeed possible.

In my case also found the funeral director to be a good source of advice.

Sending you a big hug.

P.S. If your sibling was on Social Security, you will have to call the Social Security Administration to let them know to stop sending money. I believe when my dad died, they said it was okay to keep the check for the month he died in, but I’d double check that.

June 8, 2024 at 2:18 pm

That was the case in my state too — the funeral director immediately notified Social Security.

The lawyer said to contact any entities that were sending annuities or other payments as soon as possible, as the estate will have to pay back anything that comes in, I assume starting in July. Also, once you’re officially the executor, work with your sibling’s bank and/or credit card companies to track down autopays. Some will need to continue until the house is sold, but other services can be stopped as soon as you’re able to get hold of them.

In my experience most entities were satisfied with either a photocopy or a scan of the death certificate, and you can always purchase additional ones later, so I wouldn’t go overboard unless they’re really inexpensive in your sibling’s locality.

My condolences to you on losing your sibling. I hope there are some supportive people in your life who can help you cope.

I’m sorry for your pain and loss.
I’ve never lost a sibling, thank goodness, but I’ve witnessed what the older members of my family have gone through too many times in the last few years.
-The biggest takeaway is not to let people get to you.
You can run into relatives and old family friends who are blinded by their own pain and loss and just lash out. It can be horrible and I know a couple of people in my family who will never speak again.
-There are terrible people out there who make their living taking advantage of grieving families. Funeral homes that will try to get devastated children and grand children to bankrupt themselves on ridiculously ornate funerals that their departed loved ones would never have wanted. Not all funeral homes are bad, but, understand this happens a lot.
-Even worse than that are what I’ve always heard referred to as “Vulture Realtors”. Realtors who target exhausted, grieving families who just want it all to be over and will “offer” to take the loved one’s house, car, whatever is really valuable, off of your hands quickly, easily, with no fuss and very little paperwork. For what always turns out to be a tiny fraction of their value. This happened with the grandparents on both sides of my family. The biggest part of the inheritances they worked all their lives to leave their children ended up going to some shady company.

Condolences! First find someone in your own local area to keep you company if you need that, or bring you some food, or just sit with you if you need moral support. Second, find people who were close to your sibling (neighbors, friends, coworkers, members of a club, congregation or other group…?) for moral and logistical support. Can you get into your sibling’s personal papers, or cell phone, or email records?

I also wonder if the web site getyoursh*ttogether (dot) org would be helpful. The site was developed after its creator was suddenly widowed with two children and without any helpful, completed-in-advance-of-need paperwork. She has checklists for tasks to be done after someone dies. Spouses and siblings are not the same, but some of the post-death tasks are the same: close down accounts with vendors, service providers, utilities, and credit cards; tie up loose ends with checking, savings, and retirement or brokerage accounts (this may involve tracking down a designated beneficiary, or figuring out what to do if there’s no beneficiary listed); ditto with any long-term loan repayment plans.

If there were people (individuals, a club, a congregation, coworkers) in your sibling’s life, would it help you to reach out to them? Did your sibling have a medical doctor, realtor, mechanic, or any other type of service provider? Can you contact a lawyer in your sibling’s state, or maybe a state department of ….aging, or the recorder of deeds office (I think that’s where wills get registered in my state) for guidance? Was your sibling a member of some sort of legal service or group that might help you with basic legal advice?

I’m sorry for your loss and also sorry for the administrative challenge you’re now facing. As awful as it must feel, you’re not the first person suddenly obliged to settle someone else’s financial & legal affairs. Supportive agencies and organizations exist to help people when this happens. Maybe I’m just repeating Mr. Rogers’ advice to “look for the helpers.”

Take care of yourself. Find ongoing moral support (or a therapist, if necessary). And please ignore any or all of my advice if it is not helpful.

P.S. In response to Jay’s comments: It’s not mandatory to spend a fortune on a funeral, casket, etc., so don’t feel obliged to agree just because the funeral home makes suggestions. Plain, unvarnished pine coffins are available for Jewish funerals; I’m sure they can also be found for non-Jewish families. Cremation is another possibility. Honor your sibling however you feel is best, but please don’t let yourself be talked into having an elaborate funeral that nobody can afford.

you should hire a probate attorney in your brother’s state. They will know what needs to be done.
you can also hire a professional executor. many people ask a family member to be the executor, but if you want someone else to do it, you can hire someone.

I haven’t done these 2 but they sound like they might be helpful for you.

I have been involved with getting my mothers financial accounts distributed (my sister was executor)
Financial assets & life insurance often have beneficiaries listed. these do not need to go thru the estate, the financial institution will pay them out to the beneficiaries with a death certificate. If he was employed, his employer may have included life insurance and retirement accounts in his benefits. Their HR department can probably help with them. retirement accounts have special rules about how they are taxed, so look at that first before removing money from a retirement account. (the financial institution will be able to give you an overview of this, but won’t provide tax advice)

I did read that the executor can get credit reports from all 3 credit agencies for the deceased, this will help with finding any credit cards to cancel and mortgage info. his estate will have to pay his debts, but you do not need to pay them.

going thru any papers in his house may help you find financial info you need. The executor can also have his mail forwarded to them by going to the post office and filing for it.

you may not find all needed financial information to get all his assets distributed. Eventually unclaimed assets are turned over to the state. So check the unclaimed property website for years after to see if any property shows up that you can claim. (check what info you will need to file the claim, so you know what to keep available after estate is settled)

Also check the unclaimed property site for your state.
I had an insurance company cash out my (paid up) life insurance policy to the state because they didn’t process my change of address before the forwarding order expired. It was annoying, because I couldn’t reinstate the policy, or replace it at a remotely comparable rate, but “found money” at least.
My cousin found several thousand in her deceased parents’ names a decade after they died. She had to get new copies of their death certificates, among other documentation to validate her claim as successor. Easier to claim now than after the estate is settled.

Oh, I’m so sorry.

I have administered an estate from out of state. I had a local attorney to help with the initial paperwork, made a couple of trips to deal with the bank account, and sort through personal property, hired an estate sale company to clear the house and sell or dispose of the things that were not sentimental, and did the rest of the paperwork, bill payment, and taxes from home. My CPA is qualified in both states, so he was able to help me with the state tax as well as the IRS.

I didn’t have to deal with selling a house. You should probably get someone local to keep an eye on it and get Ring cameras if it’s going to sit empty for a while.

Again, my condolences. The administration process is fairly slow. Take your time.

Undine Spragg*
June 8, 2024 at 3:14 am

I agree hiring a local lawyer is valuable. Banks mostly can be dealt with remotely— they may want you to come in, but usually you can do that at the branch near to you. A lot of places now have portals where you can upload copies of the death certificate and so on.

The important things to do immediately are secure his property and notify any banks or other institutions about his death. You can often notify verbally over the phone if you have his ssn or an account number, and they have a database to check against. It’s important to do this for loans and credit cards, because they stop accruing interest and they don’t send bills. Not quite sure how it works for a mortgage. You don’t need a death certificate or official standing to do this step.

The house and car are trickier, making sure they will be safe.

The third thing is to get the mail forwarded. This will help you see any other bills and so on.

My father recently died about a month before I was going on an extended vacation, and I asked the lawyer if I could still go on vacation, and the things above were the three things he said I had to do: notify banks, secure his property, forward his mail.

Getting death certificates may be tricky if you don’t order them through the funeral home or whoever is handling the body. Thst depends entirely on county rules, but in my case, my sister who was living locally and who signed the paperwork for the body had to go in in person,

I’m so very sorry for your loss. In selecting an attorney, remember you get what you pay for. When my father-in-law died, we used a basic attorney who assured us they could do everything. Later on we had to pay an attorney who specializes in estate planning to reopen the estate. We were penny wise and pound foolish, much to my chagrin.

June 8, 2024 at 10:57 am

I am so sorry for the loss of your sibling.

My biggest piece of advice is to hire a probate or estate attorney in the state of your sibling’s residence. Most states have very specific laws when someone dies intestate (without a will or trust). Not knowing your family situation, doing this may also protect you. And your sibling’s estate assets would pay the legal fees, not you.

You have gotten a lot of good advice so far. I personally think you can get away with 5-10 copies of the death certificate, but that will depend on the complexity of your sibling’s situation. I have dealt with the estates of two family members previously and I’m in the process of dealing with my husband’s, who passed away in February. So far, the only original I had to submit was for one of his life insurance policies. Everyone else I have dealt with so far has been okay with a scanned upload to a website or a faxed copy or, if I’m in person, I give them the original to scan and I get it back.

Life insurance and pensions sometimes have time limits for beneficiary claims, so look at those. And for retirement accounts, the IRS has time limits for converting the account to the beneficiary/ies. I would probably also prioritize looking at non-essential recurring payments and stop those so you can stop the drain on estate assets- though in some cases, you may need a death certificate and possibly a court document showing that you are the executor- all good reasons to get in touch with an attorney.

Pocket Mouse*
June 8, 2024 at 12:48 pm

The book The Executor’s Guide by NOLO is extremely helpful and thorough, I would recommend getting it ASAP. Almost everything can be done remotely, especially if you are able to hire an attorney in your brother’s state to assist. The main thing you’ll need to be in person for are securing/moving his belongings, and transferring the car (maybe also the house?) to your name as executor so you can sell or legally use it. Forward his mail to yourself right now, or at least several days before you arrive in his state to secure his property. My advice having assisted a loved one in a similar situation: get his phone and other devices, unlock them if you can, and do not cancel his phone service for another couple months at least. Insight into who is trying to contact him, as well as having the device for 2FA if you otherwise have access to some accounts, is really helpful. Similarly, don’t close his credit cards yet – you may be able to get rebates on some things (like turning a year-long subscription pro-rated). When you’re going through his things, take anything handwritten and all paperwork that looks remotely administrative with you, and later set aside time to make a list of all accounts/areas to address and potential passwords. Better yet, enlist a super-organized friend to join you to collect those papers and take on a chunk of that work.

In general, line up some people to support you, hydrate, and take the full executor’s fee that you’re entitled to. It’s unlikely to be a short process, and takes a lot of mental and emotional resources as well as time and labor. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.

I’m so very sorry for your loss-we lost my brother unexpectedly too. If your sibling died intestate, as mine did, in my State (NY) you’d have to be appointed administrator and so you’d be best served by hiring an attorney to file the paperwork work. You can contact the local bar association for recommendations. The house and assets can be transferred once you’ve been appointed. Good luck and take care of yourself.

I am so very sorry for your loss. Siblings are a different level of loss than parents or friends — please be kind to yourself in the weeks and months to come. Grief is unpredictable and complicated, regardless of the exact nature of one’s relationship to the deceased.

There are many excellent suggestions here. Co-sign on getting an attorney who deals routinely with estates in that state; you don’t need to go to BigLaw but you do need someone who knows the drill. The state bar association probably has a referral system.

If your sibling belonged to a faith community of any kind, you might check with its head to see if the community has a volunteer group that offers assistance to relatives. It might be a way to find folks to keep an eye on the house and car, feed you when you have to be in town, arrange for an estate sale, and so forth.

Absolutely. The sibling relationship is generally the longest we’ll ever have with anyone unless one sibling dies prematurely as happened here. In the expected order of things, our parents will predecease us and our children will survive us, but because siblings are typically in the same generation (generalizing, as there can be more than a generation between siblings, especially paternal half-siblings, like Mick Jagger’s youngest child is younger than at least one of his grandchildren).

I’m so sorry for your loss, Heartbroken, and I second the advice of hiring a lawyer in your sibling’s state.

Prime has a couple of good documentaries for sci-fi fans. The Center Seat for Star Trek fans and Icons Unearthed which gets into the background of how the original Star Wars films were put together. Both are absolutely amazing.

Also, just want to say that I will listen to anything Gates McFadden narrates. I loved her podcast, where she asked really good questions, not just fanboy questions. It’s such an amazingly intelligent podcast. She’s just so amazing!

In a pinch, I’ve sometimes grated some Zote soap into the washer. Seems to get things clean. I think most commercial laundry soap is highly over-rated. Gotta pay for all those ads!

Yep, it’s sodium carbonate, not bicarbonate. It works by saponifying oils, which makes them soluble in water. It also helps to soften the water you are washing in, if hard water is a problem. It’s usually sold as a laundry booster. It’s great stuff.

I have used ones from Sheets Laundry club through Amazon. No subscription required. I like that there is an unscented option, because my husband always buys scented liquid detergent and I would rather not have the scent.

Consumer Reports said the sheets don’t clean that well, but I am not rolling around in dirt, so they seem to do ok for me.

I tried them and found that I needed about a 1/4 of a package for one load of my really grimy work clothes, so I used them for my hand wash only laundry just to use them up, and went back to powdered detergent in a cardboard package.

I’ve been using either EcoNext or TruEarth (I’ll check tomorrow!), my local natural foods store had them. No subscription. They seem to work fine for mildly soiled clothes, but I still have a partial jug of liquid detergent I use for anything very dirty. Consumer Reports evaluated several brands and I believe they found the same. I haven’t decided yet what I’ll use when my current jug runs out.

We’ve used sheets from HeySunday. They’re not bad. In terms of cleaning ability, they seem fine. But you’re supposed to toss them in while the washer is filling with water, so they can dissolve before you add clothes. And even though I have a top loader, it’s so computerized that you can’t just start the water flow without actually selecting and starting a wash cycle. For that reason, I tend to prefer laundry tablets instead.

I have some family drama going on right now. To make a very long story short, my sister has been living in another country for several years because she fell in love with a local. They had had plans to get engaged in the near future, when he was out of grad school but she has come to the revelation that he has been emotionally manipulative for a while; she is leaving him and is working on coming back to the USA. My parents are not taking it well, because the ex-boyfriend has been in our family for the last 6 or 7 years and they clearly saw him as part of the family.

They are convinced that my sister is going through mental health struggles and that is the only reason for their break up. My sister acknowledges she has had some mental health issues recently and she’s getting help for it, but she says that this is not the core of her break up with her long-term boyfriend because the mental health issues were over the last couple months and she has realized his true self over the last year. My sister is currently not speaking to our parents because they just keep hounding her to get back with her boyfriend and are not being helpful to her trying to work on her mental health.

She has spoken to me that she is seeking out a new therapist to deal with her struggles and is working on settling her stuff in the other country to come home. She allowed me to tell our parents that she is OK and is dealing with physical/mental stuff and she would like some space from them. I already had plans to visit our parents this weekend before all of this occurred. I have a feeling they’re going to ask me for details my sister gave me, but I wish to keep her confidence so that she always feels safe talking to me, and I would only tell them something if I was truly believe that she was in danger.

My sister does have a tendency to exaggerate, but I believe her on the whole. There is a part of me that is dying to ask my parents their involvement, because she has gone no contact for the fact that they won’t let her ex go and they keep pampering him with gifts to try and get him to stay with my sister (dinners and a month of free rent). As much as I would love to probe my parents about what they are thinking and if their actions are true, not exaggerated about my sister, I do not want to put myself in the middle of this. I wish to be a safe space for my sister, no matter what our parents do, and I do believe that they have gone crazy over this break up because they have a tendency to hang onto the exes of me and my siblings.

So what should I do for my visit this weekend if my parents pro me for more details from my sister? Just shut it down and tell them she asked for space and let her reach out to them? Do I let them talk to see if they corroborate the details my sister gave me?

Definitely stay out of it as much as you can if you want to maintain relationships yourself with both your parents and your sister. I think stating a boring “Mmm hmm” when they complain about her to you or “I really don’t want to be involved,” if they ask you anything is the way to go. You may get lots more information by listening to what they say even without your participation or asking, so just let the chips fall where they may without intervening.

Did you also send this to Carolyn Hax in a Friday chat? It feels really familiar.

I’d definitely shut them down if you’re going to stay out of the middle of it. You’re not going to be able to probe any “truth” when people are telling you their version from their perspective. They’ll want to defend their actions and your sister isn’t even there. Do not engage on it.

The only other thing you might say is “Mom, Dad, if I were in a bad situation I’d want you to believe and support me, not my boyfriend. I’m your daughter, I’ll always be your daughter, and I’d want you to give me a chance for you to understand what I’ve been through.” I say this after my mom thought she was being helpful staying in touch with my ex-husband “so he could take our granddaughters to the family lake cabin” instead of counting on me, their daughter, to be the one who could take them. My mom was awesome in many ways and meant well but hadn’t thought about maintaining the relationship with him as putting him before her own daughter.

The best thing to have handy when you want to protect someone’s confidence is a statement that you can repeat in perpetuity when asked. “What’s up with sister’s weird behavior?” I think she is doing what she needs right now and we will see where the chips fall. “Do you know how we can contact her? she’s not answering.” I think she is doing what she needs right now and will reach out whenever she is ready. “Did she contact you?” I think she is doing what she needs right now. How about that topic change?

Prepare a phrase or two in advance and don’t be afraid to use a non-sequitur. People are much less likely to point it out than one might think and the art of the topic pivot can end many a tense discussion. Just don’t say “Can we talk about something else”, but launch right in. Ideally into a topic that your parents love/can talk about forever.
If all else fails, excuse yourself to the bathroom/some kitchen prep/announce that you need some fresh air.

This has my hackles up on you and your sister’s behalf. Agree with grey rocking if your parents push you for details, and if you can muster it the subtle subject change (though this is harder than it looks especially when frustrated/nervous — don’t feel guilty about just removing yourself if you need to).

In a broader sense, offering your sister’s ex *a month of free rent* (which in my city would be about a grand) as a bribe feels WILDLY not normal to me, especially given what your sister has said about him. You say they like to hang onto relationships with your exes — have they made you feel like their bonds with them are more important than their bonds with you? Do they disbelieve your sister about other things?

Do they seem otherwise concerned with her mental health, and/or are they using it to convince Sister that she doesn’t know what she actually wants?

You probably already went to visit your folks, but this will also likely keep coming up, so:

1. Stay out of it. As much as you are dying of curiosity (I get it!), do not get in the middle of this. Nothing good will come of that.

2. If your parents keep pestering you about it and won’t let it go, leave. Yes, it will be awkward. Yes, it will feel like you are ruining the weekend. You’re not though and they’ll get over it. It’s going to be hard to stay out of the situation if they won’t stop talking to you about it.

3. Even if your sister exaggerates, even if she has mental health issues, even if this guy isn’t abusive, even if everyone thinks she’s making a bad decision . . . she’s an adult with autonomy and she gets to leave this guy if she wants. It’s her life and this doesn’t need to be approved by a committee of her family.

Shut it down and don’t get into this discussion with them.

It doesn’t really matter if your sister is exaggerating. She feels strongly enough about this that she’s taking some fairly major action, and they need to let go. They spoke their piece and now they need to accept her decision. I TOTALLY understand your parents, but they are not handling it well. Even if they are correct that Sis’s mental health struggles are at the heart of her breakup, they are STILL not handling things well.

Offer to help her and support her in dealing with her mental health? Absolutely. The rest is way out of line, no matter what the issue is. So, getting into specific details does not help and could easily do a lot of harm.

Jo-Jo Sucht Das Glück and Nicos Weg through Deutsche Welle are good for early German learners.

Türkisch Für Anfänger and Doctor‘s Diary are also at an okay German level and it’s easy enough to read what’s happening in the scene. Be aware that they‘re older shows (pre-2010) so contain some jokes or relationship styles that wouldn’t fly today.

I also rate Babylon Berlin, Dark, and Das Boot.

Once your German is at maybe a C1 level I’d also suggest Hubert und Staller. It’s a lighthearted, very funny murder-solving show but they speak in Bavarian dialect so it might be hard to understand. Could always try with subtitles though.

My all-time favourite German show is “Mord mit Aussicht” (the original series, not the new one, which has almost none of the magnificent original cast and none of the writers, and is frankly terrible). It’s an extremely gentle police comedy in which a hot-shot city cop, Sophie Haas, is “promoted” by her sexist boss to head of a police station in a rural backwater, the village of Hängarsch, and the village itself is as much of a character as the three police officers. It’s very unusual for cop show in several respects: there’s very little violence but when it does happen, it’s frightening and shocking and even the police are shaken; the audience never gets to see the crimes being committed but, like the police, have to work back from the evidence as it is uncovered; it passes the Bechdel test so fast and hard it leaves it in the dust; and the primary focus is on the cast of wonderfully idiosyncratic inhabitants of the village, both recurring characters and main, all of whom are played by outstanding actors who are very good at comedy. It’s one of my favourite shows of all time – it ended when the actors got fed up with the network giving them less and less time to rehearse and quit rather than reduce the quality. It’s on Netflix in Germany, I’m afraid I don’t know about anywhere else.

The amount of forethought that must have been necessary boggles my mind. Having to ensure all the actors’ sight-lines were correct for so many characters who hadn’t been drawn in yet? Incredible.

It features an all-star cast headed by a pre-Mad Men Robert Morse and Jonathan Winters.

Vertigo (1958) The actual movie was kind of meh, but Alfred Hitchcock was a master cinematographer with an uncanny ability to film aesthetically beautiful scenes.

Sometimes in conversation, I will say I am fat to make a point, to describe myself objectively or to make other people realise that they are talking to a fat person so their fatphobic comments (about someone else) are not welcome, and they’ll reply, “You’re not fat.” And I don’t know how to reply to that?

I am well aware that I am (descriptor). It’s a state of being that I am very familiar with. Trying to tell me that I’m not, when we both know better, is kind of insulting.

This is a bit tricky, because it assumes that the person saying it really means it as a description and is not saying it in a self-defamatory way, which is not always the case (and should be clarified as OP says).

If my friend says for example “I am stupid” / “I am ugly” / “I am a cripple”, I would find it difficult to agree, and I would think “when you reject my statement about myself you’re rejecting a part of who I am. If you’re my friend you won’t do that” a bit grating.

All the above are clearly derogatory but “fat” sort of sits on the fence. Some people use it neutrally, others don’t. So as I said, tricky, and I think OP is spot on when they want to clarify they mean it the neutral way.

A friend and I just worked through this, actually. I am used to her complaining about her weight and wanting to lose weight (I love her at any size). Lately she has shifted to using fat as a neutral descriptor / identity to explore and at first I interpreted it as a request for reassurance. I don’t know if I automatically said “you’re not fat!” but I might have. If these are people you love, it’s worth it to say something like, “being fat doesn’t have to be an insult or some terrible thing. I’m using it as an accurate neutral description. Don’t feel like you have to reassure me.” Because to me, at first it was like she was calling herself stupid or useless or any other insult – because she had been using it that way before – and as her friend I couldn’t just let it stand and agree that she is stupid (I say this as someone who is at least occasionally, objectively stupid). If they’re not people you care about or consider worth educating, you can use some of these other strategies or just say “plus sized” which I think is a more widely accepted neutral term so you can avoid the debate.

I think you’re unfortunately up against decades of training in that people have grown used to others soliciting reassurance and encouragement by disparaging themselves—and a common self-disparagement is the fatphobic “I’m fat” fishing for a compliment statement. I think you might be best served heading it off at the pass by pairing what you need to say about your own body and experience with the disclaimer “I’m not using this as a negative term, but” or “keeping in mind that fat is a neutral description, as a fat person I…” or whatever fits. And if people insist on pushing back after that—well, maybe they’re still not getting it but maybe their definition of fat is different and you really don’t fit it but either way, I think a neutral/friendly “fat isn’t a bad word, and it’s how I describe myself/I identify with it” might drive it home. (I think whether this kind of thing sounds antagonistic is highly dependent on tone fwiw—if you’re frustrated and don’t think you can maintain Pleasant but are in a situation where you need to not tick people off you can also just pivot the conversation.)

But is “fat” really a neutral description (in general)?

If it was, people would take it as if someone said “I have green eyes” or “I have short hair” – a mere statement with no negative or positive connotations.

However, we would consider it acceptable to tell a friend “this top goes very well with your green eyes” but probably not “this top goes very well with your fatness”.

Moreover, “fat” is rather a judgment than an objective statement (there is no strict definition of it and one person can easily see themselves (or others) as fat while another would consider it within the norm).

I think that because of all the above, “fat” is not perceived as neutral but rather a judgment on a person’s body, and it is safer to leave it out of casual conversations altogether (either as commenting on other persons, or oneself). I would definitely avoid it if talking to strangers/coworkers/acquaintances.

It’s okay to want to reclaim “fat” but I think wanting to do that in a conversation in which you aren’t willing to educate the person you’re talking to is a bit tough, because it comes across like you’re just using something of a slur against yourself if you don’t first give a sign that you are owning it / using it in a different way. If you don’t have the patience to explain – totally understandable – I’d suggest using a neutral word so you can keep the conversation moving.

June 8, 2024 at 5:32 pm

Sometimes the best way to get through to someone is just to say one thing and then leave it. People will return to conversations in their minds and get something new out of them over time. It depends, though, on whether the goal is make people reconsider in the immediate moment or to allow them space to do so on their own time. If the latter is acceptable, just keep making the point over consecutive conversations and then move on. Consistency can work.

Despachito*
June 8, 2024 at 5:49 pm

I think the word “fat” is very loaded, and it is difficult to say what a person saying “I am fat” wants.

Some people do want reassurance “you are not fat”, so it would perhaps help to be more specific and say “I mean it as a neutral statement, no bad feelings attached to it.”

It is also likely to embarass the other person. What is the correct response? A lot of people would feel an answer “yes, you are” as fatphobic.

Observer*
June 9, 2024 at 2:25 pm

and they’ll reply, “You’re not fat.” And I don’t know how to reply to that?

Sometimes I’ll come back with “You’ve just proved my point.” Because so often, the underlying issue is not being seen; having one’s experience being invalidated; and or people hanging on to their notions by thinking of you as an “exception” and thus needing to pretend that you are not “fat” (or whatever it is).

With “fat” it’s sometimes easy to come back with a dry “my Doctor would disagree with you.” or “Clothing Store X (~~choose a clothing vendor they use~~) would disagree with you.” Depending on the context, it can be surprisingly effective.

You can make a surprisingly powerful air purifier with furnace filters and a box fan. They can cut dust pretty drastically, if you don’t already have a powerful purifier. Look up a Cursi-Rosenthal Box for step by step instructions.

In the absence of a specialty filter, (or at least until you get one set up) replacing the furnace/air conditioner filter often really can help. Getting the air ducts / dryer vent professionally cleaned can help too.

Make sure that your air purifier and vacuum cleaner have HEPA filters and clean and/or replace them regularly. I have a dust mite allergy and strongly recommend Sebo brand vacuum cleaners. Unfortunately, they are expensive, but they last forever.

Also, wash bedding (and your cat’s bedding too, if this is feasible) in hot water weekly. You can get allergy covers for pillows and mattresses that will help to cut down on dust mites. Finally, it’s a lot easier to remove dust from hard floors than carpets, so that’s something to consider if you move or re-do your floors at any point.

Air purifiers help a lot. I like the Honeywell ones – not ugly, very efficient. Taking off your shoes at the door helps a ton too. I have a really powerful Hepa Miele vacuum – it’s an investment, but it will last me 20-30 years. So much better than brands like Dyson. You can use it to vacuum your upholstery which is helpful for the kitty. Also, wash all your and his bedding in hot once a week to kill the dust mites! Encase your mattress and pillows in dust proof things (this is very key). Get higher level furnace filters. I know it seems like a lot, but as someone with a bad dust mite allergy, this is really effective. It’s some work up front, but now I just have to vacuum and wash my sheets once a week, and change out my air filters every 3 months or so.

Deeply Anon For This One*
June 7, 2024 at 10:58 pm

I’m trepidatious about posting this at all, but it’s really bothering me, so here goes:

I was greatly shocked by the responses to the woman who wrote in about her husband with vertigo, who was frustrated that his less-than-stellar boss Tina did not call her with an update on his whereabouts after an episode. Many people were making some huge assumptions, which the OP addressed in detail. It ended up an enormous pile-on. Not one person seemed to be at all sympathetic to the OP, who, as I see it, was just venting about a stupid boss who made it clear that she didn’t give a single damn about her employee’s health.

I admit I am biased. I have a hereditary chronic illness, covered by the ADA, that was never a problem at work until my last job, where there were coworkers who literally HATED me for “not being healthy enough”. Now, that was an abnormal workplace. I had had enough work experience to know that what I was dealing with was not normal. At the same time, though, I had never in my fifty-odd years on this planet come across such naked, spitting anger over my effrontery at having a disease that I could not help having; and the accompanying assumption that, by having the condition, I was too stupid to cope with it properly. It was deeply disturbing.

I found that same sense of bewilderment come over me as I was reading the responses. I do NOT want to rehash everything here – in other words, please don’t start screaming at me that he shouldn’t be driving and his boss can’t make him do anything, etc.. Those points were made ad nauseam and the OP responded to them. But I have to ask: do you really think that those of us with certain conditions need to be screamed at, or pontificated to, about what we can and cannot do?

Those of us with conditions, and those of us like the OP who live with and care for people with conditions, are not stupid children. I’m really sorry that your kid was killed by some guy who had a stroke while driving, I really am. That’s tragic and cannot be glossed over. And yes there are a few people with conditions who are dumb enough to flout the law, as there are people who will willfully drive drunk, high, on their phone. I am not justifying any of this. Irresponsibility that can lead to actual death is not justifiable.

But I also feel very strongly that at least SOME kind of sympathy can coexist with that same knowledge. OP is married to a person with a frightening, but manageable, condition. The stress of living with that can be tough. I thought my experience at my last job was an anomaly, but then I read all these comments and think, holy Christ, there really are people who actually believe that she needs to be chastised and vilified into the ground for being frustrated with a bad boss who doesn’t give a damn about her employee’s welfare; and instructed like a kindergartner over what she and her husband can and cannot do, as if she couldn’t possibly know all of that already.

I’m just stunned.

Yes, it is a stressful situation. But her expectation was unrealistic, and she was, at no time, left out of the loop. Which was, in her initial letter, her primary complaint. That she wasn’t called by the boss. When she had ALREADY been called by her husband.
Stressful situations do NOT mean you get to have unrealistic expectations and be angry about those not being met. I would 100% agree with you if something had happened and she wasn’t aware of the situation. I can sympathize with the stress and also say that her response was over the top and a problem. BOTH can be true. Chronic conditions do not excuse bad behavior.
And she did know what was happening. Because her husband kept her informed. She didn’t need to be double informed.
I think there’s room to understand that your own experiences and frustrations are deeply coloring your opinion of people’s responses. And not with any of the sympathy you claim to be advocating for.

I’m really sorry that happened to you.

Most people in a comment section aren’t reading each other’s replies, or not until after they make a top level post. It is not actually an orchestrated effort to “chastise and vilify someone into the ground.”

The LW of that post mentioned (several times, I think) that her husband wasn’t supposed to be driving the truck in the first place and it wasn’t part of his job. She didn’t want him being sent out on delivery runs.

So at the time I read the post, the people *agreeing* that he shouldn’t be driving the truck didn’t strike me as chastising her or condescending to her. They were supporting her case with additional reasons.

Maybe the overall tenor of the comments changed after I read it. Or maybe it’s one of those instances where everyone reads things through their own lens.

It just seemed like the OP was focusing on the wrong thing – being annoyed with Tina for not calling (when I don’t think Tina would have had any real reason to call) instead of focusing on the fact that her husband is putting himself and others in danger driving a large truck when he has a medical condition that affects his ability to drive. Or that her husband’s job is making him do that.

The OP said it was episodes of vertigo, and that the husband had to ‘sleep it off’ before he could continue driving. I wouldn’t want someone with that sort of condition driving an HGV lorry (and where I live there are very strict conditions on holding an HGV licence, and you have to have passed a stringent specific HGV driving course in order to have a licence. I can’t believe someone with any medical condition that could impair their driving would be allowed to keep an HGV licence where I am).

One thing – I do not think it was a semi (18 wheeler), or the HGV lorry. If it was, he probably was driving it without the appropriate license, because you don’t get it just because.
I work for a smaller family owned company that sells products wholesale out of the warehouse and also delivers. No small customer of mine, not even larger distributors, own their own semi. They are very expensive to own, insure, they require loading docks, and they are really an overkill in size. You usually hire semi for deliveries if needed via trucking companies. Otherwise you have smaller trucks, vans, etc.
The vehicle he drove was probably what in the US we call a “box truck”. The CDL requirements for them get confusing, because on one hand, there are weight limits, after which you will need the commercial license, but on the other hand, anyone with just the regular Class C license can rent the big moving truck.

I think your perspective is deeply and unavoidably coloured by your personal experience and strongly felt emotions. I read that entire post and I do not recognise your characterisation of it here.

I’m sorry you have had such bad experiences. But this is a workplace advice blog. People were giving workplace advice on norms and reasonable expectations. No one was “screaming” at the person with the medical condition, not least because they were not the one writing to Alison, and your interpretation of their comments in that way is uncharitable at best.

Sometime the best thing you can do is recognise that you are not the right audience for something, and remove yourself from the experience.

June 8, 2024 at 7:06 am

I was one of the ones responding with the “danger!” reaction although that was not what the LW asked about. I’m sorry if we were too strident, and I’m sorry you had that experience in your workplace. It sounds awful.
However, driving a large vehicle is a specific work duty which requires a certain degree of health and there are specific regulations about who can do it. It is not ableism (imho if that needs to be stated) to insist that a truck driver not have a medical condition that might make them pass out. They should not be drunk or high or sleepy. They should not be on medication that says “do not operate machinery” on the label. They should do an inspection before driving to ensure the vehicle is in good condition. They should have a CDL (not obtained by bribery in Illinois in the 90s.)
None of that seemed to be the case in LW’s story and it was alarming to any of us who have driven a truck responsibly or been in an accident with one.
We hear many accounts here of people being asked to do unreasonable things, even illegal things, by their unreasonable bosses. I think this seemed like one of those situations and LW and the spouse forced to drive seemed to be in this situation. Way beyond office full of bees. Possibly fatal or business-ending lawsuits level of consequences. So often people get used to their weird workplace, it’s normalized for them, and ask a question that reveals the weirdness but it’s the not question being asked.
Again, it’s terrible that you’ve been bullied for your health condition. That shouldn’t happen to anyone.

Well the OP didn’t have a chronic disease, she was unrealistic in her expectations of how her husband’s boss communicated with her, so no one was yelling at OP for being ill. I did find myself irritated by one comment kind of ragging on a person with diabetes driving, so I can see where you feel stunned overall but again, the bigger picture was not the illness. It was her expectations, her obvious dislike of the boss and, to me, a really dysfunctional dynamic among the three of them.

June 9, 2024 at 2:50 pm

The LW (OP1) says (in the comments) that it’s a “large dangerous truck”. And she implies that it’s a semi.

The fact that he almost certainly does not have a CDL doesn’t make this less likely. Let’s face it, Tina doesn’t give a flip about safety. And she is apparently stupid enough to not realize that if he gets into an accident, that truck is gone, and probably so is the business.

Why would you think that someone like that would care if he has the proper licensing.

I imagine it was a box truck, and it gets murky with licensing for driving those.

To be honest, it’s not even relevant. The whole situation is an accident waiting to happen. Even “small” box trucks are far more dangerous in an accident than a car. And, at this point he should absolutely not be driving one. Even if it were in perfect condition – which it’s NOT.

Tina is acting monstrously, and the LW’s husband needs to be ready to be fired, while looking for a new job. Given the situation, he’d be eligible for UI,if he can document the situation.

Yes, this. And that’s the main reason why I’m upset with the boss, the husband shouldn’t have been required to drive at all. That said, a truck can be anything from a pickup to an 18-wheeler. You don’t need a professional license for a small pickup even in my area, although you would for a large one, a longbed van or something like a U-haul truck. The limit is based on the fully loaded weight of a vehicle that mustn’t exceed 3.5 metric tons for a standard driving license.

Perhaps I missed this in the original thread, but has OPs husband told the boss why he should not be driving / making deliveries?

If it’s unsafe for him to drive (as the OP states), then he has a responsibility not to drive. The boss told him to do it (again, maybe the boss knows why he shouldn’t or maybe she doesn’t ), but he didn’t refuse. He got in the truck and drove it.

As the caregiver for a spouse with serious illnesses, even people who know about that and who care about my spouse, do not understand what he can and can’t do unless they’re told explicitly. It is not clear to me that the boss in this situation has been told explicitly that due to the husband’s medical condition, it is too dangerous for the husband to be driving a truck.

According to the OP’s responses, Tina did know; she just sent him out anyway.

There’s a whole heap of problems making a nasty spaghetti here:

Tina as a boss and the business as a whole are terrible and toxic.
Tina over communicates with both the husband and the OP and tries to create a personal relationship with them which is very, very boundary violating.

Husband has a known medical condition, but does not refuse to drive even though he should, because he feels a misguided “loyalty” to the company.
Husband was ill and had to pull over. He called the OP but Tina did not.

The OP has all this sitting on her head and is channeling her frustration and fear into a combination of “Tina is terrible” and “Husband keeps doing dangerous stuff” that comes out as “Tina should have called me.”

But Tina not calling isn’t the problem–it’s everything else.

The fact there was a problem that the LW would have to compensate for is an issue.

You can be frustrated with someone, but still know that they’re really not required to do anything differently. Maybe it would have been nice if the boss went above and beyond to make sure everything was OK and OP was informed every step of the way, but it’s not like the OP was held completely out of the loop. It seems like the boss sucks overall, and this is a tiny symptom of it.

I really didn’t get the impression that the comments (at least the ones I read) were yelling at or chastising anyone. They seemed pretty matter-of-fact from what I recall. Sometimes, it can be helpful to get another point of view from people who don’t have any personal involvement, so hopefully at least some of the comments or suggestions were helpful for OP.

I can’t speak for anybody else but I was certainly sympathetic to the LW and it sounded like she had definitely valid reasons to be frustrated with Tina. I do think she was focussing on the wrong thing, that the real issue was Tina expecting him to drive in the first place rather than not contacting the LW. Tina sounded wildly unreasonable and it sounds like the LW had really gotten to BEC status with her, understandably, and like this was just the last straw.

However, it was a long thread and I think a lot of people just read the post and then post their response, which is reasonable as many, probably most, LWs never engage with us at all, so people assume the letter tells all the information we are going to get and going on the letter alone, it sounded like the LW might be overreacting. It sounded as if the husband had the situation under control and his wife was just worried. The LW’s replies really put a very different spin on things and yeah, I think there were a couple of people who just had already made up their mind by the time they read them and weren’t willing to change it, but I think a lot of people were simply trying to point out to the LW that she was focussing on the wrong thing, that she needed to worry more about her husband being on the road at all and less about whether or not Tina should have contacted her (which there was nothing that could be done about at this point anyway)

I can’t comment on what all people with certain conditions need. I haven’t met them all. I can comment that yesterday’s OP needed to hear that her husband should be saying no to driving, even if his boss schedules him to drive. Apparently she, and he, need to hear that a few more times bc nowhere did I see her acknowledge that he should stop.

Both him with the driving and you with the unhealthy lens are showing a gap between what you say you know and the actions you choose to take. He knows (we presume) that he shouldn’t drive, yet he chooses instead to keep driving. You know you should talk a therapist about the lens through which you interpret events, yet you choose instead cling strongly enough to your interpretations that you share them on the internet. It’s less that anyone thinks people with certain conditions are children who need instruction and more that when there is a gap between what would be helpful someone to do and what someone actually does that the advice gets pointedly emphatic.

That was the question she wrote in with – if she really just wanted to vent, that’s more what the open thread is for (although not for only venting).

But I did see many people validate the OP’s beliefs that the boss sounds terrible! Nightly swims? Calling the OP for minor things? There is a lot not to like about this boss, and I think people were sympathetic to that!

I think issues of who should be allowed to drive are really touchy. Because public transportation is so insufficient in the US, being able to drive is a major factor in many people’s independence here, so a lot of people don’t want to give up driving even if it’s unsafe for them to do so. Meanwhile, it’s scary to think that you could be out on the road with someone who has a health condition that makes it unsafe for them to drive. Hence people feeling the need to drive home that this guy shouldn’t be driving a truck, especially given that the letter writer made it sound like they didn’t think it was safe for him to drive.

I also have a chronic health condition that sometimes causes symptoms that would make it unsafe for me to drive. The symptoms come on slowly enough that I would know before getting into my car that it’s not safe to drive right now, so yeah, I would be annoyed if someone told me that I just shouldn’t be driving at all. I get where you’re coming from. But I don’t think that was the situation here. The letter writer made it sound like neither they nor their husband thought it was safe for husband to drive this truck, but that husband was doing it anyway due to pressure from Tina.

No one was talking to her like a child. But she WAS expressing that she apparently does not realize or is unable / unwilling to accept what the limits of her and her husband’s options are. So, does she know? I have no idea. Based on her question and answers, it’s really not clear.

Because it’s so close to the Sierra Nevada mountains, there are lots of outdoorsy activities within an hour or so. Beyond Yosemite it’s even closer to two other National Parks – Kings Canyon and Sequoia (the giant trees). When I was in Clovis I could be at the gate of Kings Canyon in 45 minutes.

Distractable Golem is right about the air quality. With it being in the Central Valley, the particulate matter can just settle in with no where to go. It’s definitely more conservative than the rest of the state, with pockets of more liberal areas. Overall, I think it’s moderate, leaning right.

The agriculture is interesting… in some ways it’s a nuisance to living, but you access to cheap, plentiful produce all through the summer months. There are lots of fruit stands that sell anything you can think of for fruits and vegetables.

Thank you for the information! I’m originally from CO so I know about “dry heat” (currently in the midwest so I get humidity now).
One thing I heard was that the fog can make it pretty overcast during the winter months, are there still lots of sunny days though?
I don’t have any existing health issues so is the air quality something I would notice even without that?

It tends to be periods of gray weather, like a week or so, followed by sunny days. Many times the overcast will “burn off” from the morning leading to sunny skies.

Some people complain about developing allergies that they didn’t have before moving to the area, but not everyone. I’ve lived in the Central Valley all my life and I don’t have any. But lots of people do.

I’m confirming how poor the air quality is. Even if you don’t have existing health issues, bad air can cause them. There are lots of studies linking long-term exposure to bad air in California’s Central Valley leading to health problems. We’re not talking about mild smog. Fresno has some of the worst air quality in the entire US.

A website called IQ Air summarizes an evaluation by the American Lung Association of the Fresno region in 202.

– Ozone: #4 worst of 229 metropolitan areas in the United States
– Annual Particle Pollution: #2 worst of 216 metropolitan areas in the United States

Seaport Village is a stone’s throw from your hotel and easily walkable/scooterable — lots of restaurants and shops, if a little touristy, and fun to be by the water.

Little Italy is a longish walk or a short, inexpensive Uber ride. There’s a farmers market there on Saturday mornings.

Balboa Park is a longer walk but still not too far for an Uber, and the southern part where all the museums are is fun for a little stroll or just taking in the glorious weather and people watching. The Prado restaurant in the park is actually really nice, and Cucina Urbana just outside it is one of my favorites.

BTW, if you’re flying into SAN and have the option — try to get a window seat on the right side of the plane. It’s a fun approach and the views of Balboa Park & the Cabrillo Bridge always make me feel like I’m coming home. (Did I mention I live in NY?)

My kid has lived in San Diego for the past six years and we love visiting. We were just there a couple of weeks ago! The C Level lounge should be right near the Marquis – delicious and gorgeous water views. We also love The Henry on Coronado. If you can take your scooter in a cab/Uber/Lyft, you might want to spend some time on Coronado. There’s a paved walkway along the beach that runs for a couple of miles and has amazing views of the ocean and some lovely houses if you like looking at house (I do). Orange Avenue, the main drag, is pretty flat with wide sidewalks and fun window shopping. The Hotel Del Coronado is a landmark with ice cream shops and sand sculptures and a taco stand. You can hang out near their beach even if you don’t stay there.

The zoo is amazing but very hilly and I don’t know how navigable it would be by scooter. The art museum in Balboa Park is accessible and fun to visit. I love La Jolla – again, not sure how scooter-friendly it would be. If you do go, there’s amazing sushi at Blue Ocean.

Other restaurants we love: Provisional Kitchen at the Pendry Hotel in the Gaslamp District and Herb & Wood in Little Italy. Herb & Wood can get dark and noisy – we try to go early in the evening.

I live in a decent-size city, and there is a certain amount of playing musical chairs among the staff at a handful of similar

When I was laid off from the first place, one of the board members physically took copies of my resume to places he thought would be a good fit for me (this was just before applications were done online), and one of those was where I was hired.

The side loaders are pricier and maybe a bit less convenient, but they have the potential to be much more durable, last much longer, use much less water and power, and are less likely to unbalance when washing things like sheets/blankets/large towels. There is a reason that most high volume laundromats use them.

I don’t recommend my specific one (Series 6 with a lot of eco programs), but that’s more because the programs don’t match my washing needs, not that it is a bad machine.

It’s a top loader but it has a little impeller at the bottom instead of a tall agitator. Everything comes out as clean and soft as with the front loader – much better than a traditional agitator washer – and there are no mold issues. It’s easy to load and unload, uses relatively little water, and it fits whole bed quilts and sleeping bags easily. It does take a little longer to run a cycle though.

We have a front loader and run the cleaning program about once a month (hot water, no spin, no detergent but sometimes bicarbonate of soda).

The one essential thing to avoid stink is to always, without exception, keep the door open when it’s not in use. So many people don’t do that. If you have small children or cats, keeping it closed is a safety issue, especially if your washing machine is in the kitchen. But many people never unlearn the habit once their kids are old enough for the issue to go away.

For a front-loader, leaving the door open is essential so that you don’t get mildew in the door seal. That means it has to be in a place where you can do this – e.g. a large laundry room or basement, not a hallway or utility closet such as in many smaller homes.

We just replaced our washer and dryer, so I have some research that’s recent. Due to a problem with the gas line in this house, we don’t yet have the dryer installed, but the washer is less than a week old and I already love it.

Our choice was The Electrolux ELFW7637AT, which is a front loader and highly water-efficient. Different review sites noted it handles both protein and oil-based stains well. (That’s apparently how they test them.) True! I forgot to spot-treat spilled red wine, and it came out.

The washer has an internal water heater, meaning you won’t run out of hot water during your shower or whatever because you’re also doing a load of wash. The drum lights up when you open it (but automatically goes dark when you leave it for more than a few minutes), which means I’m not going to miss a sock.

Like all front-loaders, it should not be left closed, but this one has a little stay-open thing that makes sure you don’t leave it latched when not in use. I’m not a tech person, but its controls are pretty intuitive, and the design of the drawer for detergent, bleach, fabric softener, etc. is very good.

Finally, a quote from one of the review sites that made it their number one pick: “…this Electrolux just has a great fit and finish. You can tell that the manufacturing is well done by the clean text on the control panel and the satisfying click on the dial.”

I’ve had a Bosch stack and now a Miele stack and really liked them both! Both also used non-vented, condensing dryers which yes, are slower, but I’m satisfied with them. There is a bit of a learning curve with detergent dosing and additives (I have hard water) but I am super happy with the Miele.

I recommend front loaders and against the newer impeller models of top loaders. (Obviously I am generalizing) The impeller models make a lot of claims on their efficiency, but people seem to need to use extra water, extra this and that to actually get loads cleaned well, meaning the posted efficiency is not realistic.

One thing to ask dealers about is the service availability in your area, this should influence what brands you consider.

right now I have a combined washer / dryer unit. I dont like it cause it is difficult to reach the clothes in the washer to remove them because the dryer kind of blocks the washer opening ( top loading washer). And it is a little smaller than I would like, which is fine for most things…. but I dont want to wash big things in there. It also gets unbalanced easily.

I had front loader and they were fine except the washer gasket thingy getting yucky. I did like that the dryer was higher up, but not too high. (dryer was stacked on washer)

My favorite was a top loading without and center agitator. That thing seemed huge and I could wash anything in it.

I wake up around 6am every day. I have no desire to get out of bed and Do Stuff until it’s time to have breakfast with my partner (2-3 hours later!), but my brain is completely switched on.

Part of it, I think, is the fact that our supposedly blackout blinds let light in from the sides (probably because of the shape of our windows, long story, assume we can’t change the blinds). Some days, I manage to sleep a bit more after reading or listening to podcasts in bed for an hour or so, but really, I’d love to just sleep through to breakfast time.

I also tend to feel sleepy on the sofa around 1 hour before I get myself to bed. I wish I could stay awake and read or write for that hour! But I wake up at the same time even on days I manage to do it, or go to bed late, so it feels like yet another lifelong thing my body works against my instructions on.

So, long story short…has anyone trained themselves to sleep until the time they actually want to get out of bed? Any tips? All I can think of is trying a sleeping mask for the light issue, which feels flimsy given I’ve been like this all my life.

A sleep mask became more and more important to me as I got older, plus a white noise machine. I think I became a more sensitive sleeper over time.

Now I naturally wake up around 7, with a half-hour deviation either way. I could stay up later but I try not to, as I will probably still be up at that time regardless of when I go to bed, and I have needy pets now who want to do morning things.

Now I’m retired and two years in I can more reliably sleep until 7:00, especially if I stay up late, which only happens if I’m doing something that involves people and stimulation (concert, party, something like that). If it’s just the two of us reading or watching TV I fall asleep despite myself.

For a few years we had real blackout shades, which helped a little. Hubs is more of a night owl than I am and finds that having filtered daylight in the room helps him feel human when he wakes up, and since I usually had to get up anyway it didn’t matter that much to me.

Your first sentence made me laugh – I can understand the “unpopular early riser” all too well! Making plans whe travelling with friends in my university years was a special kind of hell. Recently, I’ve been to a hen do (bachelorette for US people) weekend, and by the time everyone woke up the day after the party I’d already made my coffee and cleaned up the entire kitchen of our Airbnb by myself. I was the earliest to go to bed, at 2am, and still woke up at 7. It was Sunday, come on, why am I like this!

I am not sure of the English word for it but I’ve bought a sort of “heavy” weight duvet for my eyes. Its name was something with yoga but its purpose is to make you relax and it truly does help with my active head that gets too frustrated to sleep even though my body is exhausted. Maybe something like that could at least make you rest until you want to get up?

Weighted blanket, yes! Just in this case, a weighted eye pillow.
I found the site but it is all in Danish. I have the Calm Eye Pillow. Perhaps there is an equivalent in your country?

After trying this I really want a weighted blanket, too. The weight is surprisingly comforting. The eye pillow is great for when I feel I need a nap during the day. It forces me to lie on my back to avoid it slipping off. At night I sleep on my stomach so can’t use it then.

The light also wakes me too early this time of year. My bedroom window doesn’t even face east; I close the blinds; every sleep mask I’ve tried gets too warm for summer temperatures, and interferes with sleeping that way. I’ve given up, and just do quiet stuff until it’s really time to get up.

I do /try/ to go to sleep earlier than my normal 1 a.m. or later, because 4 hours sleep is just not enough. Absent an afternoon nap, it seems like the best solution, I just have trouble turning myself off. I even override the time limit on my devices, so that doesn’t help.

If you’re actually getting sleepy earlier, it might be worth going to bed then and reading in the morning. Would that be an issue with your partner?

I’d kill to be able to sleep until 6 AM. I’m usually awake and moving by 4:30 or 5 no matter how late I go to bed the night before. I can’t make myself lie in bed and maybe drift back off to sleep (I’ve tried) because my brain is also up and ready to go that early. So I can’t help you, but I do sympathize with you!

Light exposure is a huge thing for sleep. My wife had that problem too, except worse – she would wake up at 1am or 2am and be unable to get back to sleep. She now wears dark red laser-safety glasses for about a half hour before bed (this helps the body generate enough melatonin to keep you sleepy), and at any time she wakes up at night to go to the bathroom or something. Then she wears a sleep mask that blocks all the light from reaching her eyes while actually sleeping. The first day she did that, she slept a normal 8 hours, and she has continued to do so ever since.

I used the same kind of red laser-safety glasses to train myself to become a morning person – I just put them on about an hour before my desired bedtime, and then wear a sleep mask while sleeping. I used to be a night owl and now I happily wake up at 6am with no issues.

June 9, 2024 at 8:58 pm

I am mostly a night owl, but have been an early bird at some points in my life.

1. Tackling things and getting stuff out of the way for the next day. Like picking out your outfit, having a clean bathroom and clean space. That way it isn’t like there’s a bunch of work to do.

2. Ensuring you’re getting enough sleep. If you go to bed early enough, getting up isn’t hard. If I go to sleep at 9 PM, I can be up real early and easily.

3. Having things you’re excited to do before the drudgery tasks. Like watching a thing you like while you eat breakfast, or going for a relaxing run (once you get hooked on the runner’s high), or taking some time for a walk with your favorite animal (be it a dog or a 5 year old).

4. Find the ways that early mornings are convenient. I really enjoyed being an early bird in another country because it meant we dodged traffic, lunch rushes, the heat of the midday, the party culture of the location.

5. Consistency. Do not sleep in on weekends. If you want to make a sustained change, sleeping in will disrupt that. Avoid napping as well if you can.

6. Make it a habit to have wind-down activities before bed, things with less stress and urgency and a bit more slow tedium. Meditation, painting, reading. My brain will stay on and active until I collapse from exhaustion. I have to let myself say the day is done and let myself sleep. Dimming the lights in the house so it feels darker, which also means less screen time before bedtime.

7. Get some good blackout curtains if you’re a light sensitive sleeper. I have several different eyemasks if one isnt feeling the right fit.

8. Make sure the temperature works for you. If my feet are warm I can sleep easier, and my circulation doesn’t warm up the bed quickly. So a heat pad can help me knock out quicker. But in the late night I can overheat on my torso and end up too hot with nightmares. If I don’t control my circumstances I’ll just stay up until my sleepiness overrides that discomfort, which isn’t good for going to bed early.

Some food for thought, discard which ones don’t fit you!

Not seeking medical advice so much as comfort suggestions. For months now, I’ve had chronic itching which seems to be connected with my cycle. Never had any allergies before. No doctor has figured it out yet. I’m trying a low histamine diet. Running makes it worse. Anyone out there with chronic itching have quality of life suggestions? Any food tips? What do you do for exercise? Do you advise giving up sweetened applesauce or buttered (home air-popped) popcorn, my remaining regular treats? (I’ve given up so many foods). Have you had side effects from taking antihistamines too long?

June 8, 2024 at 2:28 am

Oh no! I really feel for you. I was on a low histamine diet for about 9 months to get over some long covid allergy nonsense. My allergist retested my allergies and redid my allergy shots and I’m in month 4 of them and feeling MUCH better. I started winding down my low histamine diet two months ago annd introducing new foods every week and it’s been wonderful. If you suspect your itching is food related, don’t forget about Pepcid (it’s an anti histsmine) and probiotics to help heal your gut. There are some good Reddit forums on low histamine diets that will steer you to good probiotics for people with histamine issues. Also, I can’t emphasize enough how much sleep helps with keeping your body from overreacting to things. Sometimes blood sugar swings can cause weird histamine dumps, so maybe making sure you have enough carbs in you before running? Also, check out the b vitamin rabbit holes if you have a lot of free time (methylation issues with folate and B12, pluses and minuses of b3/b6). I think zinc and vitamin c were helpful with my issues – vitamin c is actually an antihistamine! Lots of foods have antihistamine properties, like blueberries for example.

Sorry this post turned all to advice. I thought I was never going to be normal again a year ago, and now I’m feeling so much better and eating so many wonderful foods. So there is hope! My doctors told me it would probably take a year for me to get back to normal and they were right. I did work really hard on boosting my immune system this last year though (cutting out processed food, eating I think an actual ton of kale, brocoli, and blueberries, allergy shots, prioritizing sleep, elimination diet, probiotics, the works).

Good luck! I learned so much about nutrition this last year, lost a fair bit of weight, figured out what specific foods annoy my body, and am pretty much eating all unprocessed food now. And I’m actually well rested most of the time now! So even though it was a miserable year, in the end I’m much healthier? I hope you too can find your way there. Sometimes something going haywire in your body can be a wake up call. You too will eat bananas and spinach again! (Low histamine diet people will know what I’m referring to :-)

Super Immunity by Joel Furhman is a great book, FYI.

My only real issue with long term antihistamines has been dryer eyes. Just being dried out in general. Eye drops and this microwaved eye heating pad my eye doc suggested have helped. Plus a hot steam humidifier in the winter. And drinking lots of water.

If treating it like an allergy isn’t helping, it might not be an allergy at all.

Have you had bloodwork done to check your liver function? When I got horribly itchy, turned out that one of my medications was screwing up my liver. Fortunately I stopped taking it before there was permanent damage.

But lots of things can affect it.

Two cents*
June 8, 2024 at 2:35 am

Oh no, that sounds awful, I’m sorry!! Hormones are so weird.

I had an itchy head as a side effect of some medication and it took a while to figure that out. So my first suggestion is to double check that–a doctor friend made the connection and I never would have! The itchiness persisted for a long while after I switched, so it wasn’t immediately obvious that it worked. I didn’t have any side effects from the antihistamines, but I probably wasn’t on long enough.

My biggest suggestion is to up your skincare game because all the scratching will have effects. For me, it aggravated my existing skin problems. So I had to switch shampoos and up my care game, otherwise I was bleeding all the time. Maybe go to a dermatologist to get a handle on the effects? They have tricks up their sleeves to help with lacerated or aggravated skin.

Good luck and I hope you feel better soon! Itchiness is so crazy making…

I am also very itchy, and always have been.
I also have terrible seasonal allergies, and I am on one prescription (nasal spray) antihistamine and one OTC during allergy season. They help with the itchiness a lot, even though that’s not their primary function. My ENT and GP have both said there’s no reason to worry about long term antihistamine use, so I am deciding to believe them given I can’t really function without. Low histamine diet did nothing for me, which I was honestly thankful for because so many of my favorite fermented foods are proscribed by it. That said, some supplements (ironically turmeric) and OTC meds (NasalCrom and similar) I have taken have exacerbated the itching. I have also tried CeraVe, Aveeno, and other anti-itch body lotions to no avail. While it’s possible I’ve gained a little weight (10 lbs?) as a result of taking antihistamines, I’m also 44 so everything is changing anyway. I wouldn’t suffer if you can avoid it!

June 8, 2024 at 6:58 am

if the itching is on your skin, you could try expanding on foods high in vitamin B12, potentially also B6 and iron.
My chronic itching was caused by B12 deficiency primarily, which I only found out by treating that and noticing how my arms and legs didn’t drive me crazy anymore.

From experience I recommend restricting as little as possible/adding foods back in if removing them didn’t make a noticeable difference. It’s so hard getting things back on track once the microbiome or energy levels are out of whack due to removing foods/food groups for a while.

June 8, 2024 at 7:32 am

My quality of life dramatically improved with allergy shots. My allergens are not food related, and my allergist is pretty comfortable prescribing a steroid when I had flares, so I have never tried any type of diets to control my symptoms. My allergist recommended Zyrtec as his first line OTC for people with skin reactions, but I found I am more comfortable using a different OTC med.

I’ve been using a daily OTC antihistamine since my teen years, for me they do contribute to dry skin, but that is managed easily for me with basics like shower oil and lotion, and it’s way more comfortable than constant itching! Second generation antihistamines (not Benadryl) are safe for long term use according to my doctors.

As far as non-medical strategies, using an air purifier and strict low-dust household habits (frequent vacuuming, an air purifier, showering at the end of the day and keeping windows closed in pollen season) are key for me.

When I am really allergic I just cannot run, because the skin reaction/itching is too uncomfortable for me. Mast cells can release histamine in response to mechanical disruption, which can include pounding exercise like running (and of course, also the action of itching your skin). When I am in a really allergic period I swim or use a stationary bike for cardio, I find I can typically do weight lifting and pilates without a major histamine response. I try to stick indoor exercise to keep cooler and reduce allergen exposure.

My best hack is run hot water, hot as you can stand it, over the itchy part. It doesn’t resolve what is causing the itch and may make it worse, but it’s temporary relief.
Calamine lotion, oatmeal baths, if your skin responds to soothers.
Keep your nails so short you can’t injure yourself. Sleep with gloves on if necessary.
I don’t know what food has to do with it, if anything, so I wouldn’t advise giving anything up unless some test has revealed an allergy to it.

For me, the thing that finally worked was getting tested for allergies, finding out what I was specifically allergic to (it sometimes seems like I’m allergic to everything), undergoing desensitization shots for the environmental allergies, and then avoiding the foods that I am allergic to. I recommend doing this sooner rather than later and regret the time wasted as for years I suffered from my allergies before seeing a competent ENT with experience in allergies. The side effects that I suffered from taking antihistamines included dry eye, dry mouth and um, constipation. I believe that the years of dry mouth contributed to later dental and gum problems, although I can’t really prove this. (I have always been diligent about brushing and flossing.)

I don’t have any great solutions, only to say solidarity with the weird cycle stuff. I did start getting weird itchy nonsense for seemingly unknown reasons, but thankfully it isn’t long lasting.

For me I’ve done best on eliminating just about everything from my diet, eating lots of clean salads with tons of veggies, keeping processed foods out. You may benefit from going through sensitivity/allergy testing and an elimination diet. For skin issues – does humidity help? For the first time in a while I was in a climate with extremely high humidity and within 24 hours it was like I had new skin. Short of an international relocation, sadly, I haven’t figured out how to replicate this. Taking hyluronic supplements and using the most hydrating products I can sometimes helps. I still run, but I do weights/pilates/yoga/kickboxing, etc.

I also have cycle-related itching, so you’re not alone in that. But mine is pretty manageable and localized so I just live with it.

A couple of thoughts: 1) not all itching is histamine-related. It’s possible that a chronic pain specialist or a neurologist might have different ideas than a GP or a dermatologist. 2) do you have any implants? I knew someone who turned out to be allergic to her implanted birth control. In her case it was the Essure coil and I think those have been recalled by the FDA (the inner zinc became exposed) but it’s worth considering if you have any implanted devices.

hm, you listed my favorite snacks that I eat frequently, never heard those connected to allergies before! I thought apples were actually a natural antihistimine but I haven’t looked that stuff up in a while.

For me, antihistamine side effects were more about dosage than length of time. I have run into issues where they dry everything out for me (skin, nose, eyes, etc), at which point I switch to half doses or every-other-day. It can also become a cycle where things are itchy because they are dried out not because of allergies.

Being hydrated has been helpful – helps prevent drying out + flushes bad stuff out. Too much plain water can flush out nutrients, so I swap some of it out for electrolyte water like Smart Water. Oatmeal based lotions like Aveeno have also been super helpful.

Hormone balancing foods like Quinoa have also been helpful whenever I’m trying to get something balanced in my life. No idea if it is related to hormones or because they are usually just healthy foods in general

LakefrontBrewery dot com has a fun factory tour. I don’t like beer but I still liked the tour. The guy who gave ours was getting a master’s degree in history and his thesis was on beer.
Friendslsp dot org (Lakeshore Park) has tours. We went on the fossil tour and it was fun. (And free)
Clock Shadow Creamery used to have a cheese tour, but I don’t know if they do it anymore.
MilwaukeeKayak dot com has some fun excursions, including some joint events with the historic society.
SculptureMilwaukee dot com sometimes has tours, but even if they don’t, you can get the map of the sculptures and walk the route yourself. There are permanent and temporary sculptures scattered all over the city. One of my favorites – this one is permanent – is a huge iron thing in front of the MKE Art Museum. It was made by Betty Gold, a sculptor who was also a Miss Texas. (I think she’s still alive, with a studio in Santa Fe.)

Villa Terrace is an interesting little museum.

The Milwaukee Public Museum is going to be rebuilt and is worth a visit before it disappears. The decades-old dioramas are super cool (although somewhat dated in their language), as is the butterfly room, where you can be surrounded by living butterflies. The jungle room replicates a jungle in Costa Rica and has bird sounds, which really confused Merlin, which was looking at my location data and saying, “Resplendent quetzal????????” And the Streets of Old Milwaukee are fun.

Visit Uzinger’s Sausage on 3rd St. They have a bargain counter. :) You used to have to know about it and ask for the clerk to look on the table in the back (“Do you have any – Canadian bacon?”), but now it’s not a big secret – they display it up front.

If you had a car, I would send you up to the Kohler Design Center, where there are amazing mockups of perfect bathrooms and kitchens. They also used to have a tour of their factory, where you could watch the molten iron being poured into the bathtub mold and see artists painting custom sinks.

Neither of us is overly busy or pretentious, quite the opposite. I think she has people in her life who ARE overly scheduled and pretentious, so she thinks she’s being polite. Any thoughts? I’ve noticed this trend with my friends in DC. My friends and family in the Midwest are still in the “just call” school of thought.

I’m not overly scheduled because I need a lot of downtime for my mental health, but most of my friends are very busy. If we didn’t schedule calls, I’d never get to talk to them or we’d end up playing phone tag.

The only unscheduled phone calls we have are with my husband’s family (who are local) and people who are trying to sell us things (that kitchen company we got a quote from 6 months ago that calls us every month!) My family are in another country so we have to schedule calls in order to get time zones to work.

I don’t really have short phone calls! And I have a very busy life that is filled more with bad times to talk than good. If you’re a good friend of mine, I’d rather know that when we talk we’ll get to talk properly. I also, to be honest, spend a lot of time talking to people and have points where I would prefer to spend my free time just focusing on one quiet thing by myself, like knitting! I don’t get to do that very often, so would be annoyed to be called out of the blue and would feel obligated to take it.

I completely understand your position and honestly also rebel against the over scheduled nature of my life in other ways – but unscheduled phone calls just wouldn’t work for my life at all.

Not invalidating your experience just giving an alternative perspective as to what might be going on here. But just talk to her – it sounds as though she might feel the same as you but have lots of friends like me! I’m just pushing back gently on the idea of a one true way here, people are different, different preferences are valid.

I don’t really like “out of the blue” calls because there’s a really high chance they happen when I’m half way through doigg something, or travelling, or I’m just not settled and able to give you my attention and enjoy the call. But for me, scheduled doesn’t need to be a week in advance – the ideal would be getting a message like “hey, are you free this eve? Wanna catch up?” and I can reply to say “that’d be fab, give me 15 mins to wrap up and make a cup of tea – will call you then!”

I’m Gen X, and I used to make and receive random phone calls with friends all the time when I was in high school and college. In adulthood, partly because people just get busy with life (work, kids, etc.) and partly because of how technology has evolved (how would you coordinate a phone call pre-email and pre–cell phone?), most friends I talk with the phone usually involve some kind of text message checking on whether it’s a good time to catch up or not.

This is something that’s definitely changed in my lifetime, thanks to the advent of mobile phones. Phone calls used to be the only spontaneous way of contacting someone, and the way a phone call worked was that you’d just pick up the phone and dial and hope the person you wanted to speak to was there. There wasn’t really a way to schedule a phone call unless you did it in person or on another phone call (or I suppose by letter!)

Now, with smartphones and instant messaging, things like text and WhatsApp are the ways we speak to people spontaneously. And they’re not intrusive – you send a message and the person can reply at their leisure. So now a phone call seems very intrusive, because you have to drop everything and take the call. What used to be completely normal now feels like an intrusion into someone’s day. So I can see why your friend feels they want to schedule a call – they might not want to feel like they’re interrupting by calling with no notice, or they might want to make sure you’re free to chat (or indeed that they’re free to chat). But I can also see your point of view – a phone call with a friend is meant to be a casual conversation, not an appointment.

I think you do just need to explain to her that you’d love to chat, but you feel that scheduling calls is too restrictive for you and you’d rather she just rang whenever she felt like it and not worry if you don’t pick up.

I also do not like the trend towards scheduling phone calls. One friend in particular seems to expect a very long call (sometimes an hour or more) if it’s scheduled. I feel like a hostage, and she’ll get annoyed if I try to hang up at 30 minutes (“but you said this was a good time for you!”) My lifestyle doesn’t allow for hour-long calls, period. So with her I get around it by texting mostly, and in the middle of a text conversation, if I feel up to phone-chatting, I’ll ask “can you take a short call now?”
But I so agree with not wanting to schedule my free time when I’m off work.

I don’t think it’s within your power to get anyone to stop wanting anything, but for sure you don’t have to schedule phone calls if you don’t want to. I schedule with some friends and do spontaneous calls with others, depending on what works for them. A friend of mine once asked me if I wanted to schedule a regular call (like, the first Saturday of every month or something like that) during a time when my life was very busy and more unpredictable than usual. I said something like, “Friend, I love you and I love talking with you, and also my life cannot handle a scheduled commitment like that right now. It would be great to catch up as we’re able, though!” And now we talk on the phone about once a month, but not always at the same time, and it’s lovely. So one thing that might help is expressing enthusiasm for your friend and your conversations while also explaining what works for you and what doesn’t.

Have you asked her outright? That might be the best way. “I’ve noticed we have different communication styles, can you just call me when you like and not schedule?”
A compromise might be to give her a window or two when you’re usually available. “Im usuallyhome Saturday afternoons and Tuesday evenings but I don’t answer the phone after 9.”
Friend of mine, who had been a PM inhis career, always used to end his calls by trying to set up our next appointment. “In closing, I’ll be in touch next Sunday morning at 10, does that work for you?” LOL. I’d say “dude, we’re not at work, just call me when you want, I’ll pick up if I can.”
Never did really resolve that.
Downside of my preferred spontaneous method is that I don’t answer at least half the time. But I always call back later.

He “needed to talk” and I – stupidly – let myself be persuaded by my people-pleaser side. I ended up making several stupid packing mistakes because I was distracted by the conversation and went from being on-time to the meeting to being 40 minutes late when all’s said and done.

Suggest that she schedule for herself the task of texting you to find out if you’re available for a quick chat and give her some day/time blocks that are the ones when you’re most likely (although not guaranteed!) to be available. She gets 100% of the scheduling burden and she can leave you a voice mail if you’re not available.

I do and don’t understand the scheduling need. My best friend in another town and I call each other all the time just because we have a few minutes. I love her messages that say “I got nothin’, just going out for a walk and thought I’d see if you were available.” With my daughters I do some scheduling because we’re in different time zones.

Jay (no, the other one)*
June 8, 2024 at 11:54 am

I see both sides and I do it both ways. I have one friend who doesn’t work outside the home and was often available when I was driving long distances for work, so I’d call and if she was available we’d chat and if not, no harm no foul. I have another friend who never – and I mean *never* – picks up the phone if he’s not expecting a call, so he and I text to arrange a time. With many of my friends it’s somewhere in between – sometimes one of us calls spontaneously and sometimes we text and say “hey, would love to catch up, are you free sometime?”

Neither approach strikes me as pretentious and I can completely understand why it’s annoying to have to schedule your free time. I also know that I if I told my must-schedule friend to call me whenever he was free, I would never – and I mean never – hear from him. I’d rather talk to him than not talk to him so we schedule.

Over the years I’ve realized I’m often the one who picks up the phone or sends the Email or arranges the gathering. It’s not that my friends don’t like me. It’s just how it is. I’ve tried waiting for them to reach out and – crickets. So I do the scheduling. I’m OK with that. The second or third time someone is busy/tied up/whatever, I stop asking.

I’m sure you are correct in your assumption that your friend is trying to be considerate of your time in attempting to schedule her calls with you, so that she doesn’t call during an inconvenient time when you are busy with other things or when you aren’t there. You can certainly tell her things like, “You can call me anytime” and “You don’t have to schedule a call with me” if that is the case. And you can also reach out to her and give her a call, instead of just waiting for her to always call you.

If a friend told me they really wanted to talk to me on the phone more but didn’t want to pre-schedule it (I’m a scheduler) it would be a kindness to tell me, “I’d love to talk to you Tuesdays any time, just give me a call whenever it works for you” or “I’m always available in the afternoons” – they could also text me and say, “if you can talk today, give me a call!” and that would be meeting me halfway. In theory, this is someone you like and are willing to be a bit more flexible with, even though you have different communication styles and neither one of you is wrong – just like “texts about minutiae all day” guy, or the “group thread that will go off 200 times an hour” family. Giving me a no-warning phone call isn’t really the halfway option, but if you don’t mind me not picking up if I’m not available, it’s a choice.

Are you sure it’s not helpful for her? Because if it is—I’d accept the scheduling as the price paid to keep in touch.

I’m not oh so special or anything—I just have a lot of awkwardly paced time commitments. You could try just telling her “I’m always free after six on weekdays, call anytime!” but only if you really will drop what you’re doing to chat if she’s doing her best to carve out time for you.

I’ve read about a few different encounters people have had with wildlife lately, usually at Yellowstone, and it puzzles me how some people seem to think that these large wild animals are safe or something? A ranger had to stop a couple from having their young kids pose in front of (and very close to) some elk.

And what are people thinking of when it comes to buffalo? (American Bison). They’re huge and massive. But there are videos showing people acting like these are friendly pets.

I’m honestly curious about why people do that kind of thing. These are adults, they probably know better than to walk right in front of a moving car, or else they probably wouldn’t have lived long enough to get to Yellowstone. It sounds like there are warning signs up to remind people not to mess with the wild animals.

It just makes me wonder what people are thinking when they do something like this. Especially with a buffalo. Any ideas? I guess maybe they aren’t thinking, but I would think most people would have enough fear to realize it wasn’t a good idea.

We had similar issues between lockdowns when people couldn’t travel abroad.

So they didn’t really know how to behave in the countryside. It’s not an excuse because any reasonable person should know to take their litter with them and not damage things etc, but some people do just have a sense of being entitled to a holiday and being entitled to do what they want to enjoy themselves, and they didn’t really think about the fact that no one’s there to clear up after them.

There are kids living in London who have never seen cows in real life. One of my sister’s university friends genuinely thought badgers were mythical creatures like unicorns. I grew up in the countryside so I’ve always had a good knowledge of and familiarity with British wildlife, but even so we don’t have any big scary wild animals here, and the only time people would see them would be if they visit a safari park like Longleat.

I saw some commercials or something on a kids’ show where they had a platypus and a jackalope together. Since platypuses are real, and jackalopes are basically not (apparently some jackrabbits grew some stuff on their heads that could look just a bit like horns), this seemed to me like it would confuse kids.

Maybe some appeal-to-nature stuff going on here? It’s really easy to think that nature is all benign/beneficial if you’re from a background where you don’t ever have to contend with natural dangers. Same reason why you can convince so many people at Whole Foods to eat cherry pits or bitter almonds even though they tend to contain a lot of cyanide. And why some preventative treatments for contagious diseases have been so effective that people end up more afraid of the treatments than of the diseases.

I was a national park ranger for five seasons across the US, and definitely saw or heard of people getting very close to black bears, grizzly bears, moose, etc. I definitely feel like it’s people thinking, “I’m in a park run by our overly cautious government having a touristy Experience! Anything goes!” They’ve come from the branded coffee shop and gift shop, picked up a lil junior ranger booklet, hopped into their rental RV, and when they see a cute moose on a short hike, it all feels like part of it. Like, if it was going to hurt them, it would have been shooed off already.

I wonder if rates would be lower in England (where you have public footpaths taking you through fields of cows, with warnings not to antagonize the cows) than in the US (where large livestock are not near the public pathway)?

People have done this for a long time–Bill Bryson wrote about it in his book about hiking the Appalachian Trail. (Someone put honey on a toddler’s hand for the bear to lick off.) It’s akin to the need for signs at the Grand Canyon about how the natural wonder was not made by a team of imagineers and lawyers and so it’s not safe to mess around at the edge.

While I recommend The Magic Treehouse series for early readers, I was quite annoyed when they went to dinosaur times and recognized stegosaurs as vegetarians, and therefore safe to walk up to and pat and hand feed some flora. The most dangerous (not insect or microbe) animals in Africa are water buffalo and hippos. They don’t eat you after they trample you to death, but they are tetchy and easy to annoy.

We also have a lot of trouble here with people not understanding that places like the Lake District can be dangerous – they set off up a mountain or a high fell wearing shorts and a t-shirt and Converse trainers, assume they can use their phone as a sat nav (or assume there will be a proper signed footpath) and have no idea that a) it’s a challenging hike and b) the weather conditions at the top can be completely different from at the bottom, and inclement weather can come in very quickly. Mountain rescue have to rescue several people every year. I think people just think ‘it’s Britain, how dangerous can it be’ and they assume they wouldn’t ‘let people go up there’ if it wasn’t safe.

I can’t speak for all Australians but generally that meme about everything trying to kill you in Oz is pretty over-hyped. That said generally most Aussies grow up being careful in nature because the things that can kill you are usually smallish and quiet (snakes, spiders, jellyfish) and you can’t always see them coming :). The thing that visitors to Australia usually don’t get warned about that can actually kill them is swimming at the beach. Lots of Aussie beaches are beautiful but can have deadly rips especially if you are not a strong swimmer. Swimming is taught in primary school here. Anyway, if you do come here, always swim between the flags (means that part of the beach is being patrolled by life guards)

As Sarah K has said, a lot of our species are small and quiet and don’t want much to do with us anyway. I did get Don’t Touch That drilled into me as a kid, but generally our wildlife isn’t as easy to reach as North American animals. You’ve got:
– animals that most people wouldn’t want to pick up or get close to anyway (spiders, ants, scorpions)
– animals that are easily spooked or hard to find (most Australian snakes are shy and will avoid humans, kangaroos and emus can easily outrun a human)
– animals that are only in a specific part of nature (sharks are only a problem if you swim in the ocean and some river systems close to the ocean, crocs are dangerous in/around the water but you’re not generally going to see them anywhere else)

I believe that of all our wildlife, kangaroos are actually the most deadly because they cause so many car crashes. Most of our animals are not aggressive or dangerous as long as you don’t bother them and/or don’t go into their habitat.

I do wonder how many stories about people getting too close to large and furry animals is Australian tourists seeing a bear/cougar/bison/etc and going “well it’s fluffy, too big to fit in a shoe and not venomous, how dangerous could it be?”

We’re living in Charleston now, and every year we roll our eyes and wait for accounts of humans approaching alligators (during breeding/nesting season, no less); people feeding alligators in their neighborhood pond and then being totally SHOCKED when an alligator attacks a dog. You’d think it would be a fairly simple concept: Do not train alligators to associate humans with food. No good will come of that. And then when an alligator does attack a pet (or, not nearly so often, a person), the cry goes up to kill them. We moved into their territory, and all we need to do is have the common sense to leave them the fuck alone, but apparently common sense is not so common these days.

The senior ranger took a look at the photo she was holding and showed it to his trainee: a portrait of a small dog taken next to a resting alligator.

Another one said that he had helped rescue a toddler standing next to a rattlesnake in the park’s parking lot. Dad was trying to get a picture of the two of them together. Dad explained afterward he was sure that the snake wasn’t dangerous because why would the park service put a dangerous snake in a parking lot?

Ridiculous question for the cat lovers! We’re undertaking a fairly significant house renovation (no changes to layout or extension however) and my kids and I decided this week that when we’ve completed the downstairs we’ll get a pair of kittens (I don’t think it would be safe for them beforehand and we wouldn’t be able to give them all the attention they need.) We have been thinking about this for YEARS. I think I am in reality a cat person, I grew up with many cats and dogs and really miss the cats in particular. My husband’s family hates cats (because cats catch birds and they love birds) and he grew up with that view, but he has come round after spending time with my mum’s cats and the four neighbour cats that play in our garden.

Despite growing up with pets, we haven’t had one as adults since the dog we had 12 years ago. She was a rescue who turned out to bite (we got her informally online, we were young and foolish!) We worked intensively with a caring behaviourist but we could not resolve the behaviour and the three years or so we had her were very traumatic for me. Eventually, we gave her to a specialist rescue when we had a baby and it wasn’t safe but I think it’s unlikely that she stopped biting at that point and that she will have eventually been put down. I still deeply feel I failed her. I read a lot of things at the time that a pet is as much a part of the family as a child that reinforced that view.

We also lost a childhood cat (hit by a car) at a particularly traumatic point when I was an older teenager and my father had recently died and I was alone for the weekend looking after my two younger siblings. I had to tell my little brother for whom the cat was his best friend and support them both on my own.

So I’ve clearly got some stuff here! I do quite deeply want the cats, but I worry a few things a) they will destroy my newly decorated house right? The couple of minor antiques I have and the curtains I’m hoping to sew? Hair everywhere! My house is not a tidy sterile space at all but I have this vision that someday it will be nice at least. b) Pets die, and the main reason we haven’t got cats to date is the sadness for the children although they’re old enough now (7 & 9) that I feel they’re more emotionally able to handle it. The joy will outweigh the eventual sorrow right? c) Dead animals arriving at my door. How to deal with it? How to deal with my husband’s (otherwise lovely) family making comments/disliking the cats?

I am catastrophising as you can see, reassure me! I’ve held off doing this because of the above reasons but I feel that my children and I are really starting to miss this bond now. Thanks, please be kind!

well, you’re not catastrophising, all these things may well come to pass, and in my opinion it will still be totally worth it! I don’t know what your antiques are, but my cats have never damaged wood furniture, but yes they will probably scratch your soft furnishings. Your house won’t be a tidy sterile space – but you have kids, so that’s not a reasonable aspiration anyway! It will still be “nice” because cats make it nicer.
Pets will die, and it’s sad. But you don’t avoid making relationships with people in case they die. Losing a pet is often children’s first experience of death, and it’s not necessary or helpful to protect them from these feelings.
As for bringing in dead things – some cats do, some cats don’t. It’s grim, you find a way.
And the in-laws – well, maybe they will come to love the cats if they get to know them. And if not, well, they are going to dislike things about the way you live, you don’t have to change to please them, and if they are rude you can point that out to them.

Keep your cats indoors and they will be at much much much less risk of untimely death + bringing untimely death to other creatures at your door.

That said, cats are animals and therefore are a little gross. For your “a” point, yeah there will be cat hair around, and sometimes they’ll have barf or bathroom accidents. A litter box is ultimately a box of poop you have in your house.

Cats also love to play a game called Get Their Attention! and the way they win is by getting your attention. If you really really really don’t want the cat to touch a minor antique, the cat will identify that minor antique as a winning move in Get Their Attention!

It’s also fairest and kindest to the cats to have a lot of cat apparatus around. Scratching posts, cat trees, toys, etc. Your house should look like a cat lives there.

All that said, I love having cats, and love cats in general. I treasure the bonds I have with my kittens, and my recently-passed cat was my friend. That’s the answer to b I suppose; in Norwegian Wood, Murakami writes about the twin realizations that death is a part of life, not life’s opposite; and that although it’s a part of life it’s still dreadfully sad.

Absolutely agree on the indoor part.
There is no defensible argument for having outdoor cats.

They destroy the local ecosystem even if the owner never witnesses it. They massacre birds which booms the insect populations.

There are other ways to stimulate a cat than letting them roam free, like cat walks, viewing carriers, cat-fenced areas.
They are hire risk for parasites themselves (so higher vet bills, less longevity) as well as being at risk of getting hit by a car or in a fight with another animal.
Animalogic just did a good video on this whole topic.

Tons of interior toys are good. How you interact with the toys matter as well. Toys are partially fun due to owner interaction of putting magic into the toys, which means spending time with the cat, enticing it to play.
Hair will depend a bit on the cat itself and how much you groom it.

A: Pets are messy. They will get hair everywhere. I have a robot vacuum and a lint roller for my dog which help keep the place neater. I wipe his paws coming and going which helps reduce that mess. The area around a litterbox is always going to be messy and a bit smelly.

B: I think it is healthy and normal for children to gain a safe understanding of loss. Things in life aren’t permanent or entirely controllable. It is important to recognize that a promise of joy is that it will end sometime, that there will be a sadness when it is over. That enjoying that joy and experiencing that loss are healthy and normal.

If you keep your cats indoor-only that should help with your in-laws since these kitties won’t kill any birds. Also, it keeps cats so much safer! Where I live, some possible dangers are cars, dogs, coyotes, other cats, and humans.

If possible, you might want to keep antiques somewhere the cats can’t get to.

For curtains… yeah, sometimes they’re a target, especially with kittens.

Grandma Mazur*

You’ve clearly thought this through from multiple angles so I think you’re ready to go for it, but a couple of things occurred to me from your later paragraphs: can you put the antiques in a glass-fronted cabinet or are we talking desk/armoire/free-standing? How possible is it to have those in a room the kittens can’t access until they’re a bit older at least? Realistically, are they cat-scratcher-appealing or just furniture?

Curtains is a trickier one – we have cheap IKEA ones and again, the kittens went up them (can still see a few claw-holes in the single-layer cotton) but after they’d grown out of kittenhood, they didn’t really show an interest. Is it the thought of all the effort you’ll have put into the curtains that get damaged, or the actual appearance of potentially slightly damaged curtains overall that would upset/bother you?

Short-haired cats don’t shed that much IMO but YMMV.

Our kids were 5 and 6 when one of our two 11yo cats died just before Christmas and they handled it better than we parents did! „The joy will outweigh the eventual sorrow right?“ 100% agree!

>>> c) Dead animals arriving at my door. How to deal with it?

IME it was the still-alive animals (occasionally mice, but worse, small birds) that were the hardest to deal with. My partner said his childhood cats used to bring in worms when it was raining. We dealt with dead animals by picking them up with a dog-poop bag and slinging them in the bin. Alive animals got taken to the vet to be dealt with humanely (birds) or they escaped again (mice) but that was only possible because the vet was three streets away. The radical option would be indoor-only cats or a cat garden that’s totally fenced in…

>>> How to deal with my husband’s (otherwise lovely) family making comments/disliking the cats?

How often do they visit? Will it just be the first time they meet them or ongoing? Can your partner talk to them if the comments get excessive? My personal approach would be to agree the downside of having cats is that they can kill birds and other wildlife, in the hope it takes the wind out of their sails, but I’ve never met a really committed cat-hater so I don’t have much experience here!

You might consider an older bonded pair of cats instead of kittens – much less likely to destroy everything.

Have you considered that cats can be indoor cats? They have a much longer life expectation when indoors, and that solves the dead animal problem. I know people have very strong opinions on this. We adopted a deaf cat, who can never be an outdoor cat due to that anyway ;)

Cat whisperer Jackson Galaxy has books and YouTube stuff and he will be a good source of everything you need to know.
Cats like to be up high on things, so if you can facilitate them being able to get on top of furniture safely, they will like that. If you can arrange a table in front of a window, they will like watching things and enjoy sunbeams. Cardboard boxes of any size will be appreciated, and cardboard “scratchers” will get a workout. I have a bristle doormat inside the house which apparently feels great to roll around on.
If you talk to your cats a lot, and greet them whenever you walk into the room, they will become responsive to your voice and more engaged with you. When you brush and stroke them, and they are relaxed, touch their paws too and gently squeeze them so their claws extend a little bit – if they are used to you touching their paws, they won’t mind you checking their feet and it will make your life easier if they ever need their front claws trimmed a little bit when they are older.
And don’t get in the habit of carrying a kitten around on your shoulders unless you are willing to carry several kilos of adult cat eventually! I think you are in for a splendid time!

One of the best books I’ve ever read seems to be also a book I never hear other people talking about: Last Night at the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo.

Excellent TV series I rarely hear people recommend (unfortunately, only one season): City of Ghosts by Elizabeth Ito.

A movie almost nobody saw, because Crazy Rich Asians was out at the same time, and I guess a lot of people in America at the time thought “We can watch only one movie featuring Asian diaspora actors this month”? Searching with John Cho, Michelle La, and Debra Messing.

I have a cherished copy of Writer’s Choice: A Library of Rediscoveries (1983) “an annotated listing of approximately one thousand books which 400 distinguished writers and a handful of other experts believe to be unjustly neglected, overlooked, or forgotten.” The choices are great but what’s really fascinating is that since the 1980’s, some of the books have been rediscovered in the wider culture – and then maybe “lost” again. Thinking of Paul Scott’s Raj Quartet novels which became the enormously popular television series The Jewel in the Crown in the 1980’s, and again now a bit forgotten. TV and movie adaptations (and re-adaptations) lead to a lot of “rediscoveries”!

Oh, do I and I highly recommend it! BUNION DERBY is a book published by a university press that didn’t get much attention. But I reviewed it and I loved it! It’s a fantastically interesting story about a foot race from the west coast to the east coast in 1928. Charles Kastner, the author, did amazing research and wrote the story with sympathy, respect and love. I have always been sorry this book and his others did not get the notice they deserve.

A YA novel from the late sixties/early seventies called Amanda. I can’t recall the author off the top of my head, but it’s about a girl who moves in next to the main characters and has all sorts of magical adventures with them: everything from encountering a set of lost paper dolls in the sandbox to riding the horse from the Mobile gas sign. I originally found it at the library, read it to death, and tracked it down later as an adult so I could possess a copy.

For more adult stuff, a little chapbook of poetry called A Murmuration of Purrs, full of cat poems and prints. My mom owned it, and again, I tracked down my own copy. I have no idea how many copies exist in total but it’s got to be pretty rare.

June 8, 2024 at 5:59 am

Would love your take on the best way forward in my international relationship. I would love a full-time live-in partner, but I don’t want to go the marriage-visa route.

I‘m in my 40s and 2 years ago I met a person in what is now a third country to my country (ca 8h quickest route door-to-door, unless you’re afraid of flying, like my partner, then 28h).
We see each other every two months or less, for 5 days to 6 weeks. We both live in desirable destinations, so it’s enjoyable to visit. Due to vacation day limits, the visited person is usually going to work while being visited.
We‘re allowed only to spend 90 days within 160 in each other‘s country.
I speak both languages but my partner doesn’t. I‘m in the highly-skilled bracket and have some disposable income, but I still would have a hard time getting a job there which comes with a work permit. I’d also make less than I do now and I’d have to quickly fly home if my chronic illness flares up to get care.
My partner has a degree but there‘s rarely a job in my country that requires no local language skills; the sector he works in now is hiring here as well (hospitality), but these workers aren’t treated as well in my country.
Getting married might work, but I‘m politically opposed to it and also just afraid of getting myself into a legal contract that I can’t get out of, with someone I’ve known only 2 years. It’s also quite complicated & expensive – my country requires interpreters and official translations of documents, my partner‘s a marriage visa and wait period after announcement.
So the conclusion I’ve come to is we need a lot more money, to be able to take lots of unpaid leave, and uphold two family residences in two countries between which we switch every 90 days.
I don’t know if one can have a relationship like we have now until retirement.
Anything I might have missed?
Thank you for reading this!!

usually getting married doesn’t do anything. I’m a Brit in New Zealand and if I got married, it is just another piece of paperwork. it is not a magic wand to get to stay here longer or quicker.

I moved over having known my partner for less than 2 years. we started living together at 8 months in (visa requirement). if you know, you know and personally. I feel living in two countries a bit bonkers for the reason you suggest. plenty of Brits do it on retirement and spend their lives chasing summers (in the UK and then NZ).

Depends on the location. When my friend met her now ex-husband, he got an assignment in Japan for a few years. She went with him on a tourist visa, but to be allowed to stay for more than 90 days they had to get married. So they married at the embassy and had a recommitment ceremony for friends and family. To be sure, he went to Japan on a work visa and she got a spousal visa.

June 8, 2024 at 11:26 am

Getting married absolutely does something in many countries! In Germany, it is the difference between a permanent residence card with the right to work (or not) and needing to scramble to get some other sort of visa (student, work visa that is Not trivial to get–many companies won’t bother or can’t hire you, something else expensive and time intensive).

In the USA it makes getting a green card SO MUCH EASIER.

I can’t speak to any other countries with the same level of personal experience, but in those countries it is literally night and day.

Anon for this*
June 8, 2024 at 2:31 pm

I respectfully disagree that marriage doesn’t do anything. It is a legal contract with implications for your finances and property ownership. it may confer obligations to support each other financially. it may affect how your estate is treated when you die. it does all these things in my jurisdiction and probably in yours. in some countries cohabitation confers different (usually fewer) rights and obligations as well.

I suggest you speak with a family law attorney and possibly an immigration attorney in your country and in any other country in which you and your partner might marry or cohabit.
(yes, I am a family law attorney)
that aside, if you want to live like you are doing now until you retire, you can..there aren’t any rules. equally I would not marry anyone unless I was sure the relationship would last and I understood and accepted the legal implications of this. it doesn’t sound like you are all that sold on marriage and that’s ok too. if you add up all the days you’ve spent together they’re probably less than a year. you could always carry on like this a bit longer and see how it plays out.

June 8, 2024 at 7:43 am

– Can you work remotely with your current job (with occasional visits back to the parent site)? This would allow you to keep your current salary.
– Is there a country that you both can move to, where your partner will be treated well and you both can get working visas, and you can retain a similar income? There are some countries that are looking for immigrants (Japan, Australia), and working visas can be easily obtained depending on the industry.
– Related to above, have you talked to your partner if and where they’d be willing to move to? Maybe they are willing to move to your country despite how they are treated?

Is your partner discussing all of this with you? Because any international move needs both parties involved. Personally, I don’t believe 1 person should be making all the sacrifices with such a big decision, it can lead to resentment. I would like to have a back-up plan and exit strategy — in the back of your mind, if the relationship doesn’t work out, how would a move affect your career. Because you don’t want to uproot yourself to find no relationship and no career — it’s a path to “force” the relationship even when it has run the course, which then further feeds into a stale/not-great career.

Why are you so opposed to marriage? It’s not an unbreakable contract in most places, and the cultures that don’t accept divorce also don’t tend to look favorably on cohabiting relationships.

In most places, marriages help guarantee the financial security of the person with lower earnings, traditionally women who stayed at home with the kids.

June 8, 2024 at 1:46 pm

I agree with this. A marriage is a pre-created contract to the state that spell out rights and responsibilities you get when you enter it with a person. It also contains the default rules for divorce.

If you don’t like the defaults, you can look into a prenup. Marriage has historically been a business and property arrangement; you can look at it a such if you want. Or just a tool that could help facilitate your relationship.

Frankly an international move to be with someone is, in my eyes, a bigger commitment than marriage (and I’m married) because it’s harder to undo logistically. But marriage also means whatever you want it to mean, so I understand how it could be something that’s a hard no for you.

NOT my unpopular opinion–a former husband’s–somewhat similar to yours: Everyone should have contraceptives implanted at an early-teen age that can only be removed after you pass tests on parenting skills. I think he also had a minimum age for taking the test, set to get you through college or some other training so you’d have some chance of being able to afford a family.

Of course, we now have states where they’re trying to limit access to contraception as the next step in the grand plan so this should be a pretty sparky conversation starter.

I also don’t want to be all “explain yourself” for an unpopular opinion, but this is literally impossible with our current medical technology even if we wanted to. The only type of birth control for men close to what you’re describing is a vasectomy. Vasectomies are not always reversible, and the likelihood of it being reversible decreases the longer time you’ve had it, and you’re talking about people having it for 15+ years (assuming it’s done at 13 or 14 and they don’t have kids until the American male average of 31).

And for women, “implanted” forms of birth control can have a host of side effects. So you’re talking about forcing someone to have something that might make them very ill.

We should have federal regulations stating that vehicles can’t be manufactured to go faster than the actual posted speed limits. All existing vehicles on the road would have speed limiters installed.

Optional lower-level starting point: Third occurrence of speeding ticket triggers mandatory installation of a speed limiter on your vehicle.

You shouldn’t be able to purchase a giant personal vehicle without passing a specific driver’s license exam (similar to a motorcycle endorsement) designed to test your ability to operate the vehicle, understand the limited sightlines, and so on.

Mandatory retesting for all drivers should begin at age 65, with the time between retests reducing as you age.

I don’t disagree with you, I’m just curious how it would work. I guess I’m considering being a landlord for 6 years.

I’m wondering how the logistics of that would work, if someone had the right to live in my place forever? (I mean, I’d just sell my place, of course)

▼ Collapse 4 replies

Narwhals are real*
June 9, 2024 at 6:34 am

I’m not really sure of the logistics to be honest, except that essentially once you rent to someone in certain countries they have strong rights to the property because the thinking is that it’s their home, and because it’s their home they have a right to live without fear of being evicted, or without other restrictions typical in rented accommodation in many countries. So in most ways it’s essentially treated as if it’s their home, and there is very little interaction with the landlord. If it’s sold, it’s sold as a property with renters in it (ie the buyer would buy it as an investment, not to live in), there are rent controls, you can basically only evict in extreme cases, like longterm non-payment of rent or extreme anti-social behaviour. I believe the flip side is that the tenant mostly takes care of things like home repairs or the like themselves. It works because of expectations on both sides – a long-term tenant is never going to make the landlord rich but it’s a handy, steady source of money with less effort than what’s typical of landlords in mostly English-speaking countries.

(This is from second-hand experience with people I know living in or owning apartments in one particular Western European country. I don’t know if it’s different with houses. If anyone else wanted to weigh in I’d be interested!)

Generally non-payment of rent is a reason to call in the bailiffs/cops and evict the tenant and confiscate their property by force if necessary. But that’s an extreme case following years of non-payment.

I’m in Finland where tenants’ rights are generally strong in the sense that a rented home is the renter’s home, and not even the landlord can come and demand to be let in without notice. If they enter with their own key without the tenant’s explicit permission, they can be accused of breaching the privacy of the home, a key principle in our legal system. You can get up to six months in jail for that.

But if a tenant breaks the rules by not paying rent for a significant period of time, or by engaging in illegal activities in their home, such as running a brothel or growing cannabis, or by doing malicious damage to the property, they can certainly be evicted. Cannabis remains a controlled substance, sex work is legal but profiting from another’s sex work isn’t. Most leases also prohibit subletting the apartment for short-term leases. So you can sublet a room to a roommate, but you can’t use the apartment for Airbnb.

When a landlord sells the dwelling they let to someone else, the new owner generally has to give at least six months notice to the tenant if they want to move in or change the terms of the lease.

Yes — pets should be legally allowed in rental homes even if they are not currently pet-proof if a) renters cover the costs of pet-proofing the property* and b) larger pets, like dogs and cats, pass a test like the Canine Good Citizen test to confirm that they’re well trained. Also depending on the animal there should probably be minimum space requirements.

If you (fairly) have to cover damage caused to the property when you leave it, including cleaning etc anyway, you shouldn’t have to pay extra on rent for a well-behaved animal companion.

*and this should be tied to specific measures taken within the home — like covering wires, sealing off dangerous small spaces — rather than “you have a hamster, we want 300 more on your rent every month”

I disagree with child free weddings being rude, but only because people should be allowed to host exactly the kind of wedding they want. But if you host a child free wedding, you don’t get to be mad if half your guest list declines the invitation. The same thing goes for destination weddings.

Kids should be kept in school until they’ve learned at least the middle school curriculum, even if this means they’re 30 when they graduate. Obviously you can’t have older students with the kids because that could be physically dangerous to the younger ones. So pass the kid up the grades and put those who don’t pass the grades in remedial school for adults when they turn 18.

An invitation is a polite request, not an order. You have the right to decline for any reason, including just not wanting to go. But the polite thing is to RSVP your no rather than say yes and simply not turning up.

True. And adults who genuinely hate their names can change them in most jurisdicitions. In my area, kids are allowed to choose a nickname to use at school for everything except their school report and any medical records. I don’t know what the age limit is, but it’s fairly low. There have been cases where trans kids have been out at school but not to their parents, so the kids can change their name at school without parental consent. In those cases, the parents only see the legal name, but the kid is still addressed by the name they want to use.

I don’t agree with all of our legal requirements for names, but I do enjoy the fact that here the name that the Muskrat’s poor kid has been saddled with would never fly. We have some fairly recent neo-names that are intentionally gender-neutral and have been given to approximately equal numbers of (assumed) boys an girls. But you can’t give an established boy’s name to an AFAB baby or vice versa, unless the child has family connections to a culture where the name is either gender-neutral or assigned to the other gender. For example, Kari is a man’s name in Finland but a woman’s name in Norway. The only way an AFAB baby could be given that name here would be for one or both of the parents to have a close relationship to Norway.

Brand names are also disallowed, so you couldn’t call a kid Apple or ESPN here. You also can’t give a baby a name that can be expected to cause moral outrage in a significant percentage of the population or to embarrass the child, so names like Satan and God would not work, at least not the Finnish or Swedish versions of them. Theo is fine, though! It’s also not allowed to give the same first name to siblings, although having the same middle name(s) is common. In merged families this does happen sometimes, but in those cases the kids generally have different family names.

Just like girls have been stereotyped to be bad at STEM, boys have been stereotyped to be bad at humanities. A lot of boys who have problems reading, for example, are just brushed off as boys will be boys and of course they don’t like to read, when it’s actually something they should be helped with because being able to read well later is so essential. Also, boys often get in trouble for being too active or loud when that’s just developmentally normal for them. (Honestly, my belief is that this is just developmentally normal for young kids but girls are more likely to have it socialized out of them at younger ages.) This affects both genders, but often boys get in trouble more for acting out when it’s just them being age-appropriate.

Just a couple of examples, but things that we could do for young boys that would make things much better for them later, and honestly if done right would help girls out too!

I don’t think we need to do anything special for boys or girls. Just treat them like young people. I’m the parent of a daughter and a son – I remember hearing people say things like, “Oh, hope for a boy – girls are so hard to raise,” and the converse, “Oh, boys are so hard – hope you get a girl.”

I cannot remember a single thing I had to do differently with them because one was a girl and one was a boy. They were different people, but the differences had nothing to do with gender.

I so agree with you that we have focused so much on the emotions/talking part of relationships and interactions for young kids (both very important!) that we have forgotten that young boys are Apt to get physical, not even in a negative way always – think lion cubs play-fighting. if we try to pretend it away we make boys feel guilty for their normal instincts (and set parents and educators up for failure). just my two cents.

Everybody deserves enough income to live on. Yes, even the long term unemployed. Unemployment should, in my opinion, be enough to cover rent, food and bills. Minimum wage then should be high enough to cover a certain amount of “luxuries,” such as TV, nights out, a holiday, etc.

Regardless of how easy (or otherwise) it is to obtain a legal abortion, society needs to continue working to ensure nobody feels they have no choice but to abort (or place for adoption) a wanted child, due to lack of funds or support. Society still needs to work to ensure there are adequate supports for disabled children, for families on low incomes and to ensure that young girls who become pregnant can continue with their education.

Criticising one party in a conflict or one political party does not necessarily imply support for another. If I criticise the current Fianna Fáil/Fine Gael coalition, that does not mean I support Sinn Féin (I’m actually primarily a Green voter, but I’ll criticise them too). If I express horror at some of the British policies in Northern Ireland, especially between the 60s and the 90s, it does not mean I support the IRA.

No country should have a veto in the UN. I do think it would make sense to require say 2/3rds majorities for certain votes, but allowing any one country to single-handedly decide a policy makes no sense.

We should have students go back to using pens/pencils and paper to write essays in school, and much of the scaffolding of writing a paper should be completed in class, by hand. If I could figure out a way to get a bunch of typewriters to the students, I would. Handwritten essay tests should be the norm.

There is way WAY too much cheating these days, and ChatGPT and the autocomplete functions in word processing programs essentially mean that students aren’t learning how to write complex sentences on their own.

Also, we should have students to a LOT more reading throughout their school lives and have students listen to a lot more material read aloud — they need more story time and more reading fiction time baked into every day.

On grammar I’m split. I am a huge grammar nerd for myself (and for ESL pals who have given me permission to give feedback on their English), but I don’t really see the point in teaching the finest finer points to most people. In terms of engaging the “logic brain”, I’d much rather have everyone take a critical thinking/intro to philosophy/media literacy class. (I actually think your point about the person with a creative writing degree kind of proves this: in-depth knowledge of English grammar evidently isn’t a necessary condition for someone to be a compelling communicator.)

However, it’s easier to understand grammar in *other* languages if you understand the same grammatical principles in your own.

On handwriting: in the UK we do this! At least we definitely did pre-pandemic, and my uni exams would have also been handwritten if they didn’t happen in 2020. I think once you get to undergrad or even the last years of secondary/high school a lot of the stuff you’re doing is too complex to handwrite though, since you’re also learning to cite properly by that point.

On cheating via ChatGPT though: my unpopular opinion is that there is a fair bit of unwarranted panic about this. It is quite easy to spot when writing is AI-generated, and you can also reverse-engineer an AI-generated answer. It’s no more nefarious than Googling the answer on the DL and copy pasting from Wikipedia.

The idea that “everyone should be able to go to college” is as outdated and harmful as Don’t Ask/Don’t Tell.

I tend towards the liberal side, so here are some unpopular opinions for the liberals I’ve heard from. Obviously the crowd involved may vary.

In regards to racism/sexism/other isms: It’s not bad for men (and boys) to feel pants feelings for any (or even all) women they meet. The bad part is when they have the power to act on that and treat the women (and girls) that they see however they want to and the women and girls have no recourse if they don’t want the attention, and no way to be treated as not a sex object. It’s not a bad thing when white people have Feelings about racism, even when those feelings create a lot of smoke but no light. It’s a bad thing when their feelings are considered more important than the consequences to the people of color around them. And so on. In other words, it’s not wrong for people who have more power to have a normal human reaction (physical attraction, bad feelings about learning they’ve been doing something wrong, etc.). It’s only wrong when their power means that their actions and reactions are considered more important than the lives of and consequences on the people with less power.

People who are struggling to overcome isms they were raised with SHOULD get a cookie when they start getting it right. Or a pat on the back. Or whatever. And help from others figuring it out. Expecting someone to change by telling them they need to educate themselves all on their own and yelling at them when they get it even a tiny bit wrong is not a way to make people learn. Humans (and other animals) learn by getting positive feedback from doing it right and neutral or no feedback from doing it wrong.

Christian communities get the idea of forgiveness and moving on right for healthy relationships. Non-religious liberal-leaning communities (NRLLCs) get the idea for abusive relationships right. Christians should learn that it’s not okay to push people to forgive their abusers or ignore the wrongdoing. Likewise, NRLLCs should learn that in healthy relationships forgiveness is a good thing and moving on and letting go (often but not always after talking about it) is a good and healthy thing to do.

The comment from The Prettiest Curse reminded me of one of mine: that you should aim to live life in your comfort zone, and that the only reason to go out of your comfort zone is to “stretch” it, so that more of the experiences you’re going to have in the future will land in the comfort zone rather than outside it. After all, they call it the comfort zone because it’s comfortable! Going outside your comfort zone is just deliberately making yourself miserable. (Unless being miserable is what makes you comfortable, I guess.)

Another one I’ve come into fairly recently is that, in a democracy, large-scale election fraud (or generally, any attempt to artificially influence election results to make them less representative of the will of the people – and yes I know that’s vaguely defined) should be among the most severe crimes recognized by the law, right up on the same level as treason.

Yeah, poor or non-existent antenatal care also plays a role, and sometimes the pregnant person’s actions do, too. Every single case of FAS is preventable by simply not drinking when you’re pregnant, but how to prevent that, especially without excessively limiting the lives of young people who could potentially get pregnant, is a very thorny issue. I guess providing support and help without judgment to pregnant people so they can quit drinking, and for many addicts the mere fact of being pregnant is what finally gets them motivated enough to stop, is the way to go.

Sometimes it’s just pure bad luck, as happened to my aunt. She was pregnant with twins but Baby A was stillborn. Baby B suffered from a lack of oxygen during birth and had severe cerebral palsy as a result. She never matured past the infant stage and died of pneumonia when she was 12.

I agree, sort of. It figure it’s important to acknowledge the step the kid’s taken in their educational path, but the acknowledgment should be limited to the school and the immediate family of the child, not used as an excuse to beg extended family and friends of the parents for presents for the kid.

I’m in Finland, and until 2021 graduating from middle school at 15 or 16 marked the end of compulsory schooling, so having a graduation ceremony after middle school makes perfect sense to me. After that most kids continued in secondary education either in high school, originally a prerequisite for going to college/university, or in vocational school. Now there’s a track to go to university or university of applied sciences trough vocational school.

Now the mandatory school age has been extended to 18, so everyone has to at least start high school or vocational school. But many never graduate, or quit when they turn 18 and go to evening school as mature students when their frontal lobes have matured enough for them to realize that they need some education past 9th grade.

Some of that is cost. Healthier food is more expensive. There are other limitations that can be at play too.

I buy primarily prepared meals, usually frozen, because I can handle making and (if I’m careful about what I get) eating them. They are not the healthiest options on the planet, but they are what I can manage.

When I was in grad school my only reasonable shopping option was a convenience store. It was a nice convenience store that had a deli and sold some prepared food, but it was much more limiting than a grocery store. On average, the healthier items that were available were much more expensive than other options. Most people could not or would not pay the premium, which also meant over time fewer healthier options were available because the store couldn’t sell them at a price that made sense for their business.

So many issues are non-issues and our collective societal consciousness fails to address some of it’s most basic problems quibbling over distraction issues.

I’m also contemplating the moving process; I’d like to paint, but the place doesn’t *need* it and maybe I should live there for a while and get to know the light before I throw money at something purely cosmetic? If I do paint, should I have the place deep-cleaned before or after?

Deep clean before painting–you want the walls clean.

Maybe ask yourself the reason for painting: Do you really like yellow and want a yellow living room? Or is it more that you feel like people expect you to Have A Vision and to Want To Paint To Express It?

You can always repaint if a color doesn’t work out. For example my relatives who did a bright yellow in a space that got a ton of sun, and so it landed as more broiling than cheerful. Sometimes you try a color and it doesn’t work out and that’s okay.

Painting is one of the less-expensive and easiest things to do on your own (or have a friend come help) so I highly encourage you to do it if it will help you feel like you made the place your own!

In that case I would paint before moving in. Particular focus on anywhere you spend a lot of time, or on a small space that can take a strong color you’d find overwhelming covering the whole room.

I think “live there for a year” is good advice for remodeling and gardening–sometimes you really use that weird little hallway, or discover that the weird scraggly things are sensational in May–but painting is much less effort to redo if you decide the dark red isn’t working in the space.

I’m on the fence about painting, timing wise. It’s easier to paint when you don’t have to deal with furniture but it can be important to live in a space for awhile. If there’s a room color now you particularly dislike you could start with that beforehand?

Definitely deep clean before you move in. It’s easier to paint before the furniture is in place but time is a factor. DIY or hire? DIY takes WAY more time than you think it does. You can also be strategic about what to paint before vs after. I painted the main living space, the guest room and the craft room because those would be the hardest areas to move furniture later.

Paint is relatively inexpensive and it really makes a place feel like your own. It is also far easier to paint before you move all of your own stuff in. Unless you are very unsure about light and/or color, I will always vote for painting before moving in.

When you are reading the documents think about how YOU think the deal should be structured, especially your initial % of equity, monthly payments, and if you have an escrow account.

Our documents weren’t correct when we purchased our current house so we had to wait for them to be corrected to complete the closing.

Dancing Otter*
June 8, 2024 at 12:09 pm

Regarding the loan documents, pay attention to how the escrow portion will be determined, if you will have escrow. (I kept mine for the convenience, even after I had enough equity to drop it.) The first year is commonly mis-calculated due to the apportionment of tax liability on the closing settlement. Knowing how escrow shortfalls are handled, immediate catch-up or spread over future payments, is going to matter.

I recommend painting before moving furniture in, then shampooing the carpet and/or washing and waxing bare floors. Even if the seller swears on a stack of Bibles that they already did, potential buyers have been tracking through there since. And sellers lie.

Re docs: the most important one is your note – make sure that is right for your loan amount, interest rate, term, base payment and prepayment penalty. All this should be on the first page in 99.99% of loans. Obviously know your payment and impound account details, when title documents come out make sure to review your settlement statement, know how you plan to take title and what that will mean to you. Make sure it matches your name on the Deed of Trust. This may sound basic – but check your names are right and you have a DL/passport that matches those names.

The rest is all standard stuff – you don’t need to stress that much over it, it is all basically the same and has been for years, and if you want your loan you will sign it. Basically – pay your bill, don’t do lie to your lender or illegal snit and don’t endanger the property.

Dog people: how much medical intervention and how much money are you willing to spend for care for sn older dog? Our golden/lab mix is 12, wonderful dog, much-beloved. Annual vet bills used to be in the hundreds. This week his annual vet check was over $1,000. Each year the vet wants to do more and more testing and treatment. His only noticeable issues are stiffness (arthritis) and some benign lipomas which the vet is not concerned about.
So when your older dog starts having costly medical problems, what is your thought process for deciding how much treatment you’ll allow and how much money you’ll spend? Our first guideline is if he’s in pain we don’t want to prolong his pain (he’s not there yet, but we’re thinking of the future). How much would you spend for care of an older dog per year – $2,000? $5,000? $10,000? What factors would make you choose to euthanize an older dog?

My buddy is 13. We have insurance for him, but it doesn’t cover everything. His recent check-up with a bunch of shots (including his monthly arthritis shot) was almost $800.

My vet is really wonderful when it comes to figuring out what is worth treating and what isn’t. He was having some leakage issues, vet suggested a blood panel, I didn’t hesitate. Turns out he has chronic kidney disease. Treatment is a diet change and monitoring, and it’s working. He has bad arthritis in his hips. He gets Librela every month, which is a little under $100 (insurance covered the first three months). He’s on inexpensive meds for arthritis and anxiety.

He had a cancerous lump removed from his flank about 3 years ago. I wouldn’t do that again because I wouldn’t put him through the risks of anesthesia and surgery at his age. I don’t know what I would do if he broke a leg (I hope I never find out!). Basically, I weigh the risks based on what he can reasonably handle.

But I’m in a very privileged position– I can afford to treat him. As long as he remains happy and relatively pain-free (he’s almost 14, there’s going to be some discomfort), and as long as we still take 80-minute sniffing walks in the mornings, we will pay just about anything. We live in an expensive city so vet care isn’t cheap, but we’re now in a position where that’s ok. We’re very fortunate. The sad part is that I know I won’t be spending this much forever– good news for the wallet, bad news for the heart.

Thanks for your thoughts, ALB. The kicker for us is we just don’t have that fat a wallet. I know when problems start we’ll be willing to spend hundreds at a time. But if and when it gets into thousands and thousands each year it will prompt some very tough decision-making. We don’t have vet insurance, and have some other unrelated financial concerns. I’m most afraid that my husband and I will be divided on what to do and how much to spend. I fear I won’t be able to let go of our dog when push comes to shove and his quality of life is not good. But I need to remember that my dog’s well-being is more important than my inability to let go. I don’t want him to have prolonged suffering.

We were really stressed when our new vet (our vet had just retired) told us that our 16 year old cat with chronic kidney disease needed a dental. Low estimate was $1,700, which is more than I paid for my first car. High estimate was $2,500.

We pushed back on the part of the process that we should give Shirley gabapentin before the procedure and the office manager basically fired us. (“If you don’t trust our medical advice, you are free to seek treatment elsewhere.”)

We found a new vet who owns his own practice (not part of a chain, unlike the previous vet) and who charges about $600 for a dental. (We were considering another dental just because when old old vet pulled four of Shirley’s teeth six years ago, it changed her personality from grumpy – that is, in pain – to sweet.)

But the first thing new vet told us was that he doesn’t do dentals on cats Shirley’s age – it’s too risky. (Even our other cat, who died last year, almost died during her dental six years ago.)

My advice is to find a new vet. Our new guy is clearly more concerned with our pet’s comfort than with making a buck. Some procedures are too risky for an older pet.

You might want to consider a veterinary dentist for a third opinion. Side note: we found one in a further-out suburb who was less expensive (and more highly-trained) than our regular vet. She was fabulous.

If you Google “Tanya’s comprehensive guide to feline chronic kidney disease,” she has extensive information on cats with CKD undergoing dental procedures (and the level of pain that dental problems cause in cats, despite their amazing ability to hide it). Interestingly, she points to research that shows that dental problems can lead to CKD. I found her site very helpful overall in the past with a CKD kitty who has since passed.

Yes! We have been fans of Tanya’s page since our other cat was diagnosed and wouldn’t eat anything. My husband was able to find CKD appropriate food because of Tanya.

Unfortunately, Shirley is probably too fragile for anesthesia and surgery. :( Since her bonded partner died a year ago, she has gone from 7.5 lbs to 4.7 lbs and herself has been diagnosed. Right now, we just want her to eat.

(Our retired vet discovered that one of the reasons Shirl doesn’t like to eat is that she has a hernia in her diaphragm and her stomach pokes through it, physically constraining her stomach capacity. Dr B said that in almost 50 years of practicing, she had never seen that before.)

We have always had rescue dogs (and cats) and we will not (and can’t anyway) spend a lot of money on their end of life treatments. I feel like a lot of vets really milk that gravy train and I just don’t think it’s fair to the animal and I can’t afford it anyway. If my dog is basically at the end of his or her lifespan, I’m not going to have a ton of tests done because I’m not going to treat him/her if the tests find something. I keep them as comfortable and spoiled (as always) as possible, but when they are in pain or otherwise not able to have their usual good life, I have them put to sleep. I hope someone does that for me, honestly.
I don’t think spending tons of money medically treating your pet is an indication of how much you love them. And many times it just makes them suffer more.

My bar is related to how the price benefits the animal. My husband got sent to the vet a few times with pets who had mystery ailments this year and I coached him to ask “how would the results of this test impact your treatment?” and “How would these results impact Pet’s quality of life?”
I understand from the vet’s perspective that more data allows for catching issues early when they are more treatable or treatable with less intervention, but as a person on a tight budget, I can’t often swing testing that isn’t symptom-directed.

So here’s my discussion question for youall: what is something you’ve come across in a story that nagged at you as not making sense, and if so did you find a way to fix it in your mind or find a logical explanation or way to change the situation so that it did make sense? I’m thinking more of, “This story element doesn’t work in the real world, but if we tweaked it a bit then it could.” My main story interests personally are fantasy and to a lesser extent sci-fi, so that influences this question, but the answers don’t have to be.

The question that I’ve been mulling over that triggered this is the question of dragons. I’ve long enjoyed dragons in stories, but from a biological perspective, having such large predators would mean that they have gigantic territory needs, and unless we’re considering the gigantic prey animals from dinosaur times (conveniently a time when giant lizards could exist and find food), I find it hard to imagine how a genetically sustainable population could exist. This morning when I was trying to sleep, I suddenly had the thought that dragons could be omnivores instead of carnivores. That gives them a much wider range of food options and makes it much more likely that they’ll be able to feed themselves and have a sustainable population. I still have to workshop it a bit, but I think it makes a lot more sense. Anyone else have similar story elements they’ve solved (or failed to solve) for themselves?

Why would anyone imagine that the metal needed to make a Jupiter-encircling band for the multiple rail lines would be easier to construct than settling the damn moons?

If it’s fiction, IMO the author can do or say pretty much whatever they want to do or say. But I think it does affect the author’s credibility if they have outlandish things or circumstances in a work of fiction. Maybe fantasy fiction is a bit different. I usually read straight fiction or mystery. Good authors research their fiction books, to avoid writing about unrealistic circumstances. Often I can tell by reading the Acknowledgments how much research an author has done before writing a fiction work. I appreciate that when they do. I’m reading a mystery fiction series now, and I so appreciate all the author’s historical research because her books, while fiction, are historically accurate.

Is this a clue, or does the author just really not know about X? is distracting when reading. (Or watching.) I’m totally willing to suspend my disbelief, but I need an indication that I’m supposed to do that.

I will roll with all sorts of unlikely or impossible things if the author commits to it and is logically consistent.

Example from TV: I thought Season 1 of Legion was absolutely brilliant at indicating what weird thing was important and a part of the overall plot, and what was neat atmosphere that wasn’t ever getting a deeper explanation. Then Season 2 just completely whuffed that. (e.g. You spent most of the season setting up a macguffin that knocks out people’s powers; probably should have used it in the final episode when you really needed a device that would do exactly that.)

Once I was reading a story written by an English-speaking author where one of the characters was French, and had a paragraph or three where she was speaking in French. She used the masculine form of an adjective for herself and I grumbled to myself about English-speaking authors not using proper grammar in French. Well, it turns out that “she” was in fact the male criminal accidentally using the adjective that he would normally use while disguising himself as a woman and that adjective was the only clue to who he was! I was bemused that I’d caught the clue but hadn’t realized it was on purpose.

What makes it work is if the author ensures the outlandish thing works within the rules of that world they’ve created. No matter what those rules are, the reader has to understand them, and the outlandish thing cannot deviate from them.

This is true even in fantasy. If you do it skillfully enough, then anything can make sense within the confines of the story. In straight fiction, you’re probably ending up in magical realism territory, which imo is much harder to pull off.

For me it bugs me MORE when sci fi/or fantasy writers don’t seem to care about basic scientific principles. Double for when they construct very specific circumstances and then violate them willy-nilly with no in-story reasoning.

The film AI starts with this huge explanation of the scarcity of resources in the future–to the point where even the super rich are only allowed one child each. But later, Flesh Fairs and robot dumping grounds are introduced without any care for said shortages–if stuff is in that short of supply every scrap of anything that’s come to the end of its use should being aggressively recycled with tons of government regulation.

“Technology doesn’t work because of the magic” so often indicates that the writer doesn’t understand how technology grows out of observed science. Like your body has electrical currents–that’s what an ekg measures. So if electricity just can’t flow around magic, welp, everyone just died.

Love this question. If dragons are omnivores they must have molars as well as the giant fangs they’re illustrated with.

Things I notice and haven’t successfully solved–I just appreciate it when the author actually addresses these with any kind of attention at all:

– Economies and use of resources. To take a well-known alternate world, in Star Trek they produce all these giant ships and send them off into space. Replicators produce their food. From what? Something they’re hauling with them that’s never specified, I decided. Who pays for the labor to produce the ships? Do they get paychecks? Do they have retirement plans? (They must, now that I’ve watched Picard.) Do they have to keep exploring to find unpopulated planets they can stripmine? But if they care about not doing harm they can’t just do that; what if there’s a developing life form there? There’s a bit of a Ponzi scheme element to it; you can’t just keep expanding without exploiting.

– Related on the resource question: ANY post-apocalyptic anything that has people roaring around in petroleum-fueled vehicles. Yes, Mad Max, I’m looking at you, but at least you dealt with it as a precious and limited resource. In all the others if the power is knocked out to a digital gas station pump they’re going to need to break into the underground tanks and use a bucket on a rope, or if they have a generator they’d have to fire it up and make a lot of noise. Either of these take time during which the zombies or whatever will find you, and there would be a lot of death at the gas stations since everyone can see them. (I found a reddit thread with some additional options for getting the fuel out but you’d have to have the equipment beforehand; I’ll share it in a reply. If you work in contingency planning for emergencies you may have more ideas.)

– The actual labor of producing things. This one is thanks to a comment on some forum long ago by someone whose expertise was in the history of textiles, commenting on the enormous amount of labor represented in just one gorgeous gown like what we see on Bridgerton. If it’s set back in time before the invention of the power loom that’s all someone’s hand labor somewhere. You don’t just discard a gorgeous gown that got a rip in the hem or a wine stain; you fix or redo in some way. Any society or planet that doesn’t represent a place in the system for the people doing all that work has left out a critical element. Jo Baker’s Longbourn is Pride and Prejudice from the perspective of one of the maids and it’s great for those details: pointing out the amount of labor involved in dealing with the monthly cycles of a house full of women, for example, and all that walking that Elizabeth Bennett does sure makes for a lot of laundry to deal with the muddy hems.

I don’t solve these as I read but I notice them. If it’s really egregious and wrong it affects my feelings about the book. If it’s just ignored I tend to accept it as long as they don’t do something ludicrous that means they really didn’t see that consequence from their world-building omissions coming and when it came they and their editors didn’t catch it and fix it.

When I first read ancient Greek texts like The Odessey and The Iliad, it just amazed me how often and broadly praise for female characters boiled down to “weaver of cloth” or “spinner of thread.” Besides physical comeliness it was the single most important thing about any woman who’s mentioned, even in passing. Even Helen, the literal most beautiful woman in existence, has almost more said about her weaving and spinning than about the war being fought over her.

Later when I started reading more about the history of clothing and textiles and realized the sheer amount of labor involved, it got a lot clearer why this was considered such a big deal. Fine cloths, fabrics and clothing were a hugely important signifier of weath, prestige, and stability.

The blog estimates that *85%* of the labor in producing a finished garment was in the spinning before the spinning wheel increased efficiency. By his numbers, that’s about 36 hours of spinning a week for a family of 6 to have minimal new clothing. More if you wanted to have nice things (and everyone likes nice things, pretty things, if they can afford them) or have extra to sell. And all that work was fit in around all the other women’s work-cooking, minding the kids, hand milling grain, fetching water, helping with harvest and planting, maybe taking care of the kitchen garden and livestock.

I am actually writing a story about dragons right now and they are omnivores. They also come in a huge variety of sizes; they kind of replace birds and large predators in the ecosystem. The largest of them aren’t insanely huge. They also don’t have 6 limbs, because literally no vertebrate is or has ever been built this way; they have wings like bats. I’ve also spent a lot of time reading and watching videos about pteradons to get ideas of how dragons could more realistically exist.

I also had the thought that fire breathing would have given them an advantage of cooking their food somewhat, which makes nutrients more digestible and is one reasons humans can sustain our brains. So if dragons cook their food that’s why they’re smarter (although they are not magic or human level intelligent in my story, but are maybe a bit smarter than dogs).

I recently read a crime novel set in 2018 London. The premise was that a child goes missing at Bond Street tube station, and the mother loses sight of her because she is receiving a phone call. There is notoriously no phone signal in the London Underground (some stations are getting it now, Bond street definitely didn’t have it in 2018). The phone might have rung if she was still on the down escalator just after the ticket barrier. This is my generous explanation, even though the book says the call came while going down to the platform in a lift (the escalator is so far from the track, the child could not have boarded the train and disappeared so quickly).

Also, I just read another London-based crime novel with geographical inaccuracies that bugged me. Part of it happens to be set in my old neighbourhood, and some location names and distances are totally off. I get not wanting to name a real police station, but don’t call it West Kensington Police Station when you’re placing it on a street that is clearly in North Kensington (there is no real North Kensington police station, and the two areas have quite different vibes). Later on, a main character meets an old friend at a pharmacy near her home in Fulham, and says she’s not surprised to find out they’re neighbours; readers know by this point that the friend lives in Ladbroke Grove, which is not at all within walking distance. Lastly, a key location is a restaurant that really exists in Central London, and the first character to name it correctly says it’s in Holborn. Chapters later, another character goes “oh yes, I’ve been there, it’s that place near London Bridge!” – when London Bridge and Holborn are around a 30-minute walk away. I enjoyed the book, but these three things still nag at me.

Not exactly an answer to the question, but some of you might enjoy Diana Wynne Jones’ ‘Tough Guide to Fantasyland’ (a kind of dictionary of fantasy quest tropes), and ‘The Dark Lord of Derkholm’ (a story about the practicalities of running a quest including all the standard elements).

Excerpts from probably the most famous entry from the former:
‘HORSES are of a breed unique to Fantasyland. They are capable of galloping full-tilt all day without a rest. Sometimes they do not require food or water. They never cast shoes, go lame or put their hooves down holes, except when the Management deems it necessary, as when the forces of the Dark Lord are only half an hour behind. […] But for some reason you cannot hold a conversation while riding them. If you want to say anything to another Tourist (or vice versa), both of you will have to rein to a stop and stand staring out over a valley while you talk. Apart from this inexplicable quirk, horses can be used just like bicycles, and usually are. Much research into how these exemplary animals come to exist has resulted in the following: no mare ever comes into season on the Tour and no stallion ever shows an interest in a mare; and few horses are described as geldings. It therefore seems probable that they breed by pollination.’

June 8, 2024 at 9:38 pm

I’ve meant to look into this for forever, but I think that Arabic and also Hebrew are difficult for English speakers to learn (or indeed, other European languages) because 1) different alphabet, 2) alphabet doesn’t always include vowels, 3) alphabets are right-to-left, rather than left-to-right, and 4) there are some guttural sounds that are difficult for English speakers to make. (Although if you speak Dutch or German….)

Given that, I think the “difficult to learn” thing may be based on learning the written language, rather than the spoken language. As someone who has worked with a lot of English language learners, I know that these are very different things. So maybe that’s the case here? I’m not entirely sure.

That said, I know there are some tonal languages (such as Mandarin) that are very difficult to learn as a spoken language, because most westerners don’t have ears that are trained to hear the various intonations that distinguish between similar sounding words.

I mean, their options for scheduling a group of people are kind of limited. Presumably Sundays are church days (?), scheduling it during weekdays has a high likelihood of either interfering with people’s workdays or, in the evenings, their limited family/free time after work (or else more work interfering for people who work off-hours). I’m not a parent, but I’m not sure why Saturday morning would be worse for parents than like, Saturday afternoon – either way, they have to have a solution that isn’t “bring the kids to the meeting.” Moving the meeting to the afternoon also would just make your Saturday afternoon feel like work, would that be better somehow? I think if you don’t want to be on the board, you should probably just tell them sorry, but no, you don’t have the capacity to take this on right now, and if that’s not something you’re willing to do for whatever reason, then you pretty much just get to deal with the situation as it is.

I used to participate in church discussions with and about young adults. The topic of scheduling came up a lot. Although I will be the first to admit that churches have MAJOR problems, they are also running up against absolutely intractable scheduling problems.

Lots of churches schedule things mid-day, mid-week, which works for retirees and nobody else.

But name literally any other time, and the responses will be some combination of the following: “My work is exhausting. I’m tired in the evening, and I can’t commit to going out again” or “lots of people work in the evenings and on weekends” or “Saturday is my only day to get things done” or “I can go to the service, but I can’t really can’t spend all day Sunday at church” or “I don’t have reliable childcare at that time.”

Weekend mornings are bad because people who work during the week don’t want to rush out of the house on Saturday morning. Midday is bad because midday meetings seem to eat the whole day. Evenings are bad because people are tired. Also, the young adults that churches are trying to reach are reasonably likely to have kids, and that makes scheduling anything more difficult.

I’m not blaming anyone. I’m tired in the evening, too. I know that people really do have to work evenings and weekends and even constantly changing shifts. I honestly don’t know how parents of young children manage to schedule all of the stuff they already have! I’m just saying that there is literally no time during the week that everyone will agree is a good and accessible time.

I’m young, I guess (late 20s), and I would be okay with 9am Saturday if it was pitched as having breakfast provided (like, coffee and bagels, not fancy catering).

Ultimately I think that whatever time you hold the meeting is going to cause a conflict for someone – some people might prefer weeknights, but others will have their standing book club meeting or yoga class on Wednesdays.

That said, I do think the Saturday meeting means that the church is now monopolizing both weekend days (assuming Sunday services), which I think is the primary argument against Saturdays, rather than anything about the time. Sometimes it’s nice to be able to spend a full day lounging around at home!

I wouldn’t like a Saturday 9am board meeting either regardless of my age!! When I think of my sleep patterns: pre-kid (which for me was until mid-30’s) I would easily sleep/lie in bed until 10-11 on Saturdays. My kid’s early years, we slept until he woke up which was usually 5-8am (his wake-up time got later as he got older) so MAYBE I could have gone to a 9am meeting on Saturday but we usually took advantage of having a slow morning on the weekends. Plus my kid would have school friend meetups, etc that might make it more challenging. Now my kid is 14 and I’m in my 50’s and back to lounging in bed until 10-11am on a Saturday morning. So I don’t go to church, but I’m assuming those that are on a church board go to church services rather regularly – wouldn’t a more logical time be once a month on Sunday after one of the services? When you are already at the church?

This is what I think too. And, you can/should continue whatever the childcare is, so that the spouses of the board-members don’t have to kid-wrangle.

Our church vestry meets one Sunday a month after services. The church provides child care for the meeting. Folks are busy but generally in the building. As someone who jealously guards Saturday morning the 9 am thing would be a no go.

I feel like the obvious time is after services when everyone is already there… Churches often have social activities then anyway so the board could just have their fellowship donuts in a meeting room sometimes instead of the public space?

I would have to be really excited about something to be willing to get up early on Saturday for it, but it would generally be a better time childcare-wise. It’s poor timing but the bigger issue is you don’t want to be there!

Hmm, as someone with multiple young children, I have to say I’d prefer this time to most others, including weekday evenings, especially since it’s only once a month. The earlier the better, I’d even say do 8! Get it out of the way and still have the rest of Saturday to do other stuff.

Weekday evenings are a challenge for anything that doesn’t involve having food there – getting everybody fed, starting dinner early enough, and do you do have dinner before or after?

Saturday morning that early seems bad for everyone. I wonder if part of the problem is that meetings can go long? I’m with the “after services” bunch since most of you would be already there, but it needs a hard stop time so that it doesn’t eat up the day. Maybe even before services (like sports practice before school) could work.
I do wonder why you are trying to attract “younger people” to board positions. Seems a better fit for people who have aged out of the herding children stage. (Or the single adults, retired adults, child free adults, adult parents of teenagers, etc.) If you’re concerned about longevity of the institution, attract younger folks with programs and services they need or like, then get them on the board in 20 years.

June 9, 2024 at 12:10 pm

This time works for a lot of parents I know, especially if its virtual, because their Saturdays are filled with sports games, play dates, and other activities. The kids wake up early anyway and first thing Saturday is an easier time to have the spouse keep an eye on the kids. Weekday evenings would be harder for them because it interfers with picking up kids from daycare/aftercare, cooking/feeding them dinner, doing the bedtime routine.

Then again, the volunteering event I was at yesterday started at 7am and was mostly staffed by people 16-30.

If you really don’t want to do it, then either anytime they suggested would have been bad or there would have been something else about the meeting that you’d have strong negative feelings about. You can not want to do something without needing to justify the thing as #Terrible.

It sounds like it’s all over the place in terms of how other people would feel about this time. I will certainly ask in a future meeting if we’ve tried meeting after services and why that didn’t work for people, but I’ll do it with an open spirit and I won’t act like it’s universal among younger people not to prefer this time based on what’s been said here.

Sunscreen advice needed.
I since wear sunscreen daily (please no lectures, I literally had the skin cancer screening last month in the nation’s best cancer hospital, and the derm complimented my minimal sun damage and recommended to continue to do what I’ve been doing), but now it’s summer, I am spending a lot of evening time in the neighborhood pool, and it’s still fully sunny after work. So sunscreen is obviously needed.
The issue: all sunscreen makes the skin on my face to break out. I tried all drugstore “face”, “dry” etc versions. I tried the highly recommended Supergoop. I still get breakouts. I wash it off immediately after I get home, breakouts.
I have the 40+ years old skin which is combination oily but also getting sensitive. I need not to get sun damage, but I also don’t want to spend all summer looking like I am back in my teen years.

This started happening to me almost immediately after our pool opened on Memorial Day Weekend. So far what’s been working for me is to wash the sunscreen off as soon as I get home and follow that with a blemish-cleating toner (I use Target’s knock-ooff of Clean & Clear daily toner with salicylic acid). I was worried that using this daily would try my face too much but I guess the sweat and sunscreen are providing enough moisture to keep things in balance.

I know not everyone can use toner with salicylic acid in it because it’s harsh so this may not work for you. I unfortunately don’t have a good sunscreen option for you. All of the ones I use on my face tend to be pretty thick and sticky, by design.

Have you tried a liquid foundation/makeup from a natural/organic line? Say, Jane Iredale? They typically won’t make your skin break out like a specific sunscreen will, contain natural sunscreen, and since they use ingredients that are already sun blocking I’ve found I never have problems with them.

If that doesn’t work for you – I personally have found Raw Elements works well. I use that for extra protection on my nose when I only want to use a powder that might not have the staying power of a liquid foundation.

Have you tried liquid foundation with sunscreen? I have had really good luck with this with the cheap-ish mainstream brands. Currently use Revlon Colorstay but have also had success with Covergirl and Maybelline – all of them have lightweight foundation that lasts a long time. My face gets so little sun that my freckles have gone into hibernation!

It is only SPF 15 but unlike normal sunscreen foundation stays on your face and acts like a physical barrier. My experience that converted me was accidentally having a lazy river trip last 4hrs instead of the planned 1.5 (low water levels) and being stuck in hot direct sun instead of the planned shaded route. My arms were the darkest of reds, my legs actually got so burned they turned purple. My face was pristine! Only a light pink on areas where my makeup had rubbed off from my sunglasses.

PSA to also remember that the water will reflect the sunlight up at you, so you need sunscreen in places like the underside of your jaw which are normally protected from overhead sunlight.

I have combination skin and rosacea and struggled most of my adult years looking for products that work with my skin’s temperamental nature. I also spend a lot of time outside (for a number of years I worked outdoors).

I have successfully been using a brand called Paula’s Choice, specifically their Calm line. The toner keeps my skin from over reacting to cleansing and makes it possible for me to use a single moisturizer with SPF 30- their normal to oily (although they also have a normal to dry version as well). All the products are very reasonably priced.

.I’ve also had great results with Hydropeptide brand foaming face cleanser. It doesn’t strip my skin and cause over compensating oil production. It’s expensive but a container lasts me more than 6 months so it averages out.

Good luck- it can be a real adventure trying to find something that works for your skin!

It isn’t uncommon. It depends on the individual owners and it varies. In my current condo community (of about 100 units or so) everyone has a double garage of their own and it seems like at least one of the residents is having a garage sale every weekend. There might be tag sales where you enter the actual condo unit 2 or 3 times a year, but these are usually estate sales. I previously lived in an apartment community where many of the residents rented garages and there would probably be a garage sale going on once every 2 or 3 weeks. (It did seem like they were often being held by the same 2 or 3 residents over and over.) I never really worried about my own safety, but I do worry about people stealing the items offered for sale. Once a year certainly doesn’t seem excessive.

There are tricks you can use for the second one to make it look like all one thing, from just putting a scrunchie over the two hair ties to arranging the second half of your hair strategically around the first ponytail.

Lots of skinny braids, make them loose at the top. You can loosely gather the braids when you need to get them completely out of the way. That’s what I did when my hair was that long. Takes forever to do it, I recommend washing your hair, towel drying well, then make the braids even if your hair is damp. I used to leave the braids in for a week or so. Leave loose for a couple days, restart the process.

I had calf long hair until recently and wore it in a simple braid most of the time.
If I wanted it up and out of the way for any reason, a normal bun would result in too much pulling, so I instead used
1 hair tie to get all hair in the generally right place and then
lots of small (not tiny but small, so they grab a feasable amount of hair) clamp hair clips to affix the hair in a bun shape.
I would gently (so it doesn’t pull at my scalp) twist the hair and wind it around the base of the ponytail – and each round would get secured bit by bit with about 6-7 clamp hair clips. At the end I would feel for looser strands within the bun and add more clips as necessary.
I needed about 35 of those clips and it took a bit of time but it at least was a comfortable way of wearing my very long hair up and out of the way. And also still comfortable to lean my head against things because the hair would act as a cushion.

Maybe that would work for you, too. :)

One of the keys is hairstyles that don’t have one point of tension—like a ponytail or bun twisted around an elastic is all hanging on that one spot. Braids can work better, as they spread out the tension, or learning to put your hair up without elastics. (I use “Amish hairpins” available on Amazon of all places and loop my hair into a bun without elastics.)

I am a fan of the center part double French braid. My hair is not as long as others on this thread but is VERY thick and type 2C/3A curly. I can’t put it in a bun and drive comfortably because it takes up SO much space between my head and the car headrest. Braids keep it out of my way, together, and contained.

I’m planning to retire soon and move to a 55+ community near my family in the Sun Belt.

I’m looking at some small one-bedroom townhomes. They have an HOA of just over $300 per month (US) which covers exterior maintenance, pest control, the roof, HVAC, water heater and water, sewer, trash and access to a couple of neighborhood pools.

Nobody in my family has ever had a condo or a townhome, and opinion is divided between “this sounds reasonable” and “are you out of your mind?” Given that my current water bill alone is about $150 and I pay about $40 per month for trash, I’m leaning toward this sounding reasonable. But I would appreciate any thoughts from the wise people here.

That sounds pretty incredible to me. My condo fee is like $550/month and it does not include HVAC or the water heater, we have to maintain those individually.

It’s always a shock to people moving from single-family homes or townhouses to see how high the condo fees are. But when you consider shared amenities, landscaping, parking lots, lighting, fire safety, exteriors of all the buildings, plus maintaining funds for master insurance payouts and big repair projects, it is a LOT of money. And as an owner, by paying the HOA, you don’t have to take care of any of it yourself. I find it to be as reasonable expense.

Our HOA dues are 560 a month and covers a great deal, or so they claim. It does cover water, garbage, snow removal, landscaping, the exterior but it absolutely does not cover plumbing within the building (not just the specific units which I can understand, but the general plumbing throughout the building). It’s not the HOA dues that can be the problem, it’s the special assessments for high cost projects. We had one a few years ago that was $6000 per unit for fixing our balconies (which they never did so just waiting for the next assessment). Before that we had several in the $3000 range.

The other consideration to ask about is the HOA insurance coverage. In my area HOA dues are increasing considerably because fewer insurance companies are covering multiple unit dwellings. The companies that are covering are increasing their rates. One reason given is the increase in natural disasters—think wildfires, hail, hurricanes, etc. As insurance rates climb so do our dues, along with special assessments. If your rate doubles next year, is it still a good deal? Maybe. Maybe not.

My HOA is currently 477 a month and it doesn’t cover nearly half what yours does. Though when I moved in it was much lower.

I’m a treasurer for a 14-unit condo. Our monthly dues were just raised to $275 from $225, which theoretically gave us a much-needed extra $700 per month for projects. Two months after raising it, our master insurance policy went from $950 to almost $1400 per month, wiping out most of our increase. We also cover water, which for 14 units comes out to about $700 per month. The sewer rates in our city go up 7% every year, which becomes pretty expensive over time. And you always need funds for unexpected emergencies on top of the usual monthly/yearly expenses. So I think it is reasonable.

Water, sewer and pest control monthly would add up to more than $300 where I am, so sounds pretty dang reasonable.

Your HOA fee sounds pretty reasonable to me. I pay $250 a month in my HOA which covers the roof, street lights, lawn mowing (our yards are small) and tree and shrub trimming, and snow removal for our sidewalks and driveways. I still have to pay for my own utilities and pretty much all of the house maintenance other than the roof. We don’t have any pool or club house, but some of the lawns on the outskirts of the development are considered shared space and maintenance of them is covered by HOA fees. I thought the fees were a bit much, but I guess they really are not. We did have to pay a special assessment of something like an extra $800 last year when we had a lot of snow in the winter of 2022/2023 than expected and the expense of removal was more than what the HOA had budgeted for.

Seashell*
June 9, 2024 at 9:24 am

I lived a townhouse-style condo in the early 2000’s, and I think that was about what we paid then, so I’d say reasonable. I live in a fairly high cost of living area, so, if your family members live where $200K for a 2500 square foot house is the current norm, they may have a different mindset.

The downside to this stuff is that the HOA may not be as willing to fix things as you hope. We had a leak from the HVAC into our condo, and the condo association was resistant to paying for any of it because they said the problem was inside. In the end, we split the costs.

Condo resident here. That could be totally reasonable or nowhere near enough. Please get the association’s financials for at least five years as well as the annual meeting minutes, and anything else they’re willing to give you. You want to know if there’s a deep reserve fund (helps avoid but not eliminate special assessments), how they’re handling insurance (as someone else mentioned, it’s going up everwhere), how they’re discussing necessary improvements (if the buildings are older, have they replaced roofs lately? is that in the cards soon? etc.), and if they’ve had to do recent special assessments.

Good luck!

Oh, yes, absolutely.

As a veteran of both a lumbar and a cervical spine surgery I focus a lot on spine mobility, especially thoracic spine, and targeted moves that spread the work around rather than just replicating my spine’s natural bendy spots. But also a lot of dynamic side squats, foot mobilizations, etc.

I’ve been stretching for about the past 10 years and it makes a tremendous difference in heading off pain. Also, when I feel stiff I intuitively know which stretches are likely to help me.

But my biggest game changer by far has been working on my core. Not just the abs, the whole core, with simple isometric exercises. I haven’t “thrown out” my back or shoulder in years, knock on wood, and it’s because I can feel my core engage properly when I have to reach or lift.

100%. I started stretching regularly as part of my PT exercises when I got diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my early 30s and if I don’t stretch for a while, I can tell. If you work out, do at least ten minutes of stretching at the end of your workout. Or, if you want to stretch but don’t want to do a workout, take a hot shower to warm up your muscles and then stretch. Besides those, just stretching randomly during the day, like get up from your chair and stretch for a couple of minutes. It really, really helps. The increased range of motion you’ll develop also makes it less likely that you’ll pull or tear something.

Yes, and just general regular movement more frequently throughout the day. I participated in a research study a while back that consisted of moving 5 minutes out of every half-hour. It’s essentially the pomodoro technique that’s suggested for better concentration, with exercise added in the break. I had to set my timer to do it consistently and obviously sometimes couldn’t make it work, but what a difference in my energy level and general sense of easy mobility! Sometimes I put my earphones on and found a 5-minute song to dance to, sometimes I just walked back and forth, sometimes I did some sun salutations or other yoga moves.

I dropped the habit for a while thanks to a sprained knee interfering with movement but as that healed I really needed to move. Even with a sit/stand desk I can end up locked into one position for too long. Moving again after an extended block of time would remind my sprained knee that it needed movement more frequently and I think that applies even without injury.

Does anyone have advice on managing very different circadian schedules within your family? As I cruise through perimenopause, I’ve lost the ability to sleep in, so I’m usually up before 7. My husband has trouble getting going in the morning, and I don’t even want to talk about the teenager. Getting them up and going is so much work on my part that I’ve pretty much given up on family outings unless it’s something I really want to do, which makes the battle worth the fighting. (Part of my exhaustion is having to get my teen to school on weekdays.) It creates issues with meals as well — if I have breakfast at 7, husband at 11, teen at 1, we’re off -schedule all day and it’s hard to do anything because someone is always hungry at the wrong time.

Aim to have dinner together. Breakfast and lunch can be each person on their own. (One of my teens could eat a full meal every couple of hours, which helped to align meals.)

Try and remember that just as your body is like “Yup, it’s 6:30, that is now our wakeup time. We are now WIDE AWAKE, even if you try lying quietly in bed with your eyes closed to trick me. It’s awake time” their bodies are giving them the opposite message.

I would gently nudge you to think about “should’s” in your thinking pattern. “A family should all get up at the same time.” “A family should always eat all meals together/eat the same meals.” “A family should do X on weekends.” “A family should do X sorts of things at a particular time of day.” and so on. Should’s tell you about what you believe the ideal, or the model, behavior is (“should be”). They don’t necessarily tell you what is best or most helpful for you and your family.

Maybe it needs to be your teenager’s responsiblity to learn enough kitchen skills that they can feed themselves two meals a day (and clean up after themselves!). Maybe you shift your weekend schedule to afternoon/evening activities instead of morning ones. But as one person who lives with a lot of should’s in their head, to another, a little bit of reflection on what is, and isn’t working, and shifting your patterns towards what is working, might make everything about how your household runs feel better.

As others have said, family dinner may be a better better than being all together for breakfast/lunch; everyone should be able to calibrate their snacks for a 6PM meal no matter what time they got up.

Do you know the economic theory of revealed preference? It’s when people show what they really want by what they do.

Your family likes hiking, but they don’t like it enough to get themselves up in the morning. If you don’t like it enough to do the extra work of getting people up and out (I wouldn’t), I’d put a pause on the summer family hikes. You can look for a hiking group or buddy that you can join to do your own hikes until schedules or temperatures make it possible to pick up family hikes again. Maybe that’ll make spouse and kid realize they could get it together if they want to join you or maybe not, but at least this way you don’t have to sacrifice your hike to their lesser enthusiasm.

Hiking, at least in summer if you live somewhere hot, would depend for me on if your husband was willing and able to get up and at ’em in time to hit the trails (*without* complaining about the hour) or not. If he is, the two of you can go and the teen is invited if s/he wishes to come but can also stay home and sleep in. If he’s not, and you’re not willing to go alone, then perhaps hiking is better in winter/fall for now. It also requires a bit of honesty: do you *really* need to hit the trails at 7 or 8 AM to have an enjoyable day, or would you just prefer it? Does husband agree, or does he think a hike that starts at 9 or 10 is also worth doing? Can you trade off maybe, or otherwise split the difference?

They might need to be dropped off if they can’t get to school by themselves, but in that case they should still be up and ready to go when it’s time to leave.

I’m not about to armchair diagnose anyone, just commenting that many of the expectations that apply to NT kids go out the window when you’re dealing with something more fundamental than simply an age-related delay in circadian rhythms. And not all teens get those. Granted, I’m perimenopausal now and routinely get up by 5 on weekdays, but I don’t remember ever having any trouble getting up early for school even in my teens, and my 15-year-old seems to be the same way.

A key to even a modicum of success in adjusting circadian rhythms is consistency. Your kid shouldn’t sleep in even on the weekend, as cruel as that sounds. Doing so means they’re back where they started on Monday morning. The world is a cruel place when your circadian rhythms don’t match what society expects.

Talk to me about (digital) photo storage! I don’t consider myself “tech-y” and have kept kicking this problem down the road, but my Google storage is now full from my Google Photos. I have through different phones/devices ended up with big backups to both iCloud and Google Photos, and I have a staggering number of photos on my iPhone, and I don’t know how to go about separating/organizing/deleting or knowing what’s duplicate. Should I have any hard drive storage? Has anyone done a photo organization project and is willing to share their tips and methods? Thank you!

I recently downloaded a ton of pictures to my PC and then deleted them off Google Cloud. Now the daunting task of organizing them! But I used the PC for years for photo storage, so all it will really take is shifting the downloads to new, similar folders and subfolders. I organize folders by year, most subfolders by month and others by topic, like special occasions or vacations. For some vacations with a lot of pictures, I’ll make sub-subfolders labeled by date and location (most of our vacations are wandering road trips). Good luck!

You can purchase more storage to your phone. You sign up once, and then they automatically charge you each month. I can’t remember the price, but it’s very reasonable and well worth it.

I’d recommend a local RAID drive and then some kind of unlimited cloud backup program like Backblaze. Google Photos and iCloud storage get way too expensive way too fast.

Go buy yourself a couple of external hard drives, making sure they’re big enough for each cloud file. Get one for each place in the cloud your photos are, and download them onto separate drives. Use two monitors (you can buy second hand monitors for $25 on Craigslist.) Plug in two of the hard drives (probably icloud and iphone first). Open each file, viewing them on separate monitors, and sort by date and size, or whatever is most distinctive. It should be fairly easy to spot the duplicates between your iphone and your icloud account. When you’re finished de-duping, open up the Google file and do the same thing.

Sympathy only, not much advice because I’m as backlogged as you are. I have various folders on my laptop named things like “photos from phone to sort 2013”.

I have photos saved in my Verizon account, in Google Photos, in OneDrive, and in Dropbox. It’s ludicrous.

I’ve been doing a small thing that helps but doesn’t solve. When I’m someplace with time on my hands like riding the bus, I go through and delete photos I took for a particular need, like the screenshot of my boarding pass for a flight. I think of this as whacking the underbrush.

I’m definitely going to work on this on my laptop, not my phone, for the big sorting. The decision-making labor may be my biggest personal barrier and I’ve decided I’m going to move quickly, not linger on the photos. If I have 5 versions of something I’ll pick the best and delete the others. If I’m not looking at them anyway, which is the case, I’m not going to miss the other 4 one bit. If I can’t remember why I took it I’ll delete it without stopping to try to remember. This feels like something I can do while I watch TV if it’s something that doesn’t really require deep attention.

Thanks for asking this–you’re re-inspiring me to tackle this.

My husband, “Jay,” has recently become interested in Cape Verdean culture, as there is a large Cape Verdean population in a nearby city where he volunteers twice a month. It just so happens that I have a casual acquaintance, “Dee,” who is a recent immigrant from Cape Verde. He takes the same train to work as I do, and we get off at the same stop. He’s very friendly, and we often chat as we’re getting off the train in the morning or waiting for the train in the afternoon. Would it be appropriate for me to tell Dee about Jay’s interest in his culture? Perhaps introduce Dee to my husband, maybe invite him over for dinner so that Jay can learn about Cape Verde from Dee?
Or is Dee likely to have the attitude of “I don’t exist to educate you Americans about my culture,” as I understand some minorities do? While I can understand why a Black person wouldn’t want their White co-worker to educate them about BLM, I also know some minorities who are honored by people who are interested in their culture, and welcome the opportunity to share his culture. After all, Dee made the choice to move to a foreign country with he knew he would be a minority, and he might appreciate the opportunity and see it as a gesture of welcoming him to our country. Maybe I could just casually mention to Dee that my husband is interested in Cape Verdean culture, and see how he responds? If Dee says, “Oh, wow, I’d like to talk to him,” then take it from there; but if he doesn’t seem interested, then drop it?

This is tricky. There’s something that sounds a little bit “you people” in the idea of inviting someone over specifically so that they can teach you about their culture. If you like Dee, invite him over because you like him. If you don’t like him enough to invite him over to dinner, then don’t invite just because of his country of origin.

I do think there’s room to mention your husband’s interest *if* it comes up organically. Like, for example, if Dee mentions something and you can follow up on it because you heard about it from your husband. That’s a nice organic place to mention your husband’s interest. I personally would say that he’s been “reading about” Cape Verde, which for some reason resonates better for me than “interested in the culture,” I’m not sure why.

Would you invite someone else with the same level of acquaintanceship to dinner? Would you invite Dee (based on personality, common interests, etc) if he wasn’t Cape Verdean? I’m sure you mean well, but the fact that you explicitly say you want to invite him over to provide a free education rather than to help him feel welcome in your country, get to know him (and his family?) better, or because you get along so well … doesn’t come across so great.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with mentioning the volunteering, but be aware that might be really uncomfortable for Dee depending on your husband’s role (does he work side by side with Cape Verdeans, like helping with the landscaping at a cultural center, or are they recipients of a service like free food or legal help?) I think you should be clear with yourself whether you’re looking at this relationship as a networking opportunity versus a friendship you want to nurture (with the culture thing as an interesting bonus) before acting further.

1. My husband does not provide charitable services to people (Cape Verdean or otherwise) at his volunteer place. He volunteers at a museum based on one of the city’s largest industries, and this particular industry has drawn many Cape Verdeans to the city. Dee does not live in this city, but in another city nearby.
2. Truth is, I’ve been wanting to get to know Dee better, but I’m not sure how I (a married woman) could go about it without going him the wrong idea, or leading somewhere that it shouldn’t go. So I thought that my husband’s interest in Dee’s country of origin would give me the opportunity I’d been hoping for.

Ooh good point. Is Dee married/partnered? Inviting a couple/family over for a meal sounds more natural, I think.
Re: asking about Dee’s culture, as a member of a minority in my country, I agree saying your husband has been reading about it sounds good. If someone indicated interest in my culture I would take this as a compliment. I think the best way to go would be asking Dee if he has any recommendations for further information (e.g., websites, events. cultural associations, etc.). That way you and your husband can explore without “burdening” Dee – and if he wants to invite you to an event or something there’s an organic opening in the conversation for it.

Invite him over for dinner with you and your husband if you want to invite him for dinner and think he’d be good company. If he’s on his own in a strange land, a home cooked meal might be nice.

If you’re worried about it being misinterpreted, make it clear that it’s with you and your husband and maybe invite a couple of other people and include Dee’s partner (if he has one). But invite him because you want to invite him personally, and not because he’s a walking example of Cap Verdean culture or an educational tool / party turn.

When I was young and my father was a mature student, he hung around with the international students (often from Malaysia or China) and brought them home with him for dinner sometimes because they were far from home and missed home cooking. They talked about their culture sometimes but it was always an organic conversation. In exchange they took him to Chinese / Malaysian restaurants he’d never have visited on his own and broadened his palate. It worked because it was a reciprocal friendship.

There’s a man who parks in front of our condo every day, often multiple times a day, and smokes on the sidewalk. My guess is that he lives in a condo nearby but isn’t allowed to smoke at home, so he drives a little ways away and smokes outside. The problem is that a little ways away from his condo is right in front of mine. I have three young children, including a baby with congenital health issues, and I don’t want them exposed to secondhand smoke. Should I confront this person and ask him to smoke elsewhere? I hate confrontation, and technically he’s on a public sidewalk so he is allowed to smoke there. I just hate having to call my kids to go inside when I see him outside or closing all the windows when I smell the smoke coming in. Any advice?

Does it need to be confrontational?

Bring him a cupcake and ask nicely.

How about what works for adults?

– A calibrated bottle that she can fill up and drink down over time, with a small reward at the end.
– Flavoring the water with lightly crushed fruit. If you’re worried about the fruit in the water, I see Amazon has some water bottles with built-in fruit strainers.
– Starting a meal by drinking a glass of water (adjust for her size).

I would let her fill the bottle/choose and crush the fruit herself, and I’d institute the “drink a glass of water before meals” for adults, too. Eating isn’t a race, but drinking one’s water might be.

Yes, my idea would be to attach water drinking to getting something, either as a reward or as a gate to getting what the kid wants. So, kid wants stickers? Drink some water first. Kid wants you to come now? Drink some water, then I’ll come.

Another option would be to try to build it in to your routines. We’re going upstairs (or whatever)? Take a sip of water at the bottom and the top. Every time. We are reading a book? Sip of water at the beginning and end. Every time.

Increase availability, too. Have cups all over the house. Looks messy, but then the convenience barrier is gone.

I guess I would also try to push water earlier in the day, as in not when the kid is tired. Bedtime/naptime is hard enough as it is.

I don’t recommend drinking water as a race. My toddler liked to drink fast sometimes, would drink in enormous gulps very quickly and swallow a lot of air in the possess. The result was 3 2 1 throw up…

Popsicles? Slashes? Snowcones? You can make your own to address the sugar level. (I like freezing watermelon chunks and throwing them in the blender with a little bit of frozen limeade concentrate. )

You could ask an expert about caffeine free ‘teas’ like mint or orange peal. (I am NOT suggesting anything with caffeine nor herbal remedies.)

Also, maybe your little one is fussy about the temperature. I really only like to drink plain water if it is very very cold or room temperature. Someone else only drank it super hot.

This was me for my entire childhood. I still don’t really know how to explain it. For the most part I was an obedient kid, but I resisted all the urging about water. I really didn’t like the (lack of) taste or the sensation, and I can tell it still bugs me. All this meant that I was dependent on fruit juice until I discovered tea, but because the adults in the house only drank coffee, that didn’t happen until I was about 14. It might be worth trying herbal/fruit infusions, to avoid the caffeine? If I’d realized I could have had ‘water, but tastes like peppermint’ or ‘water, but tastes like some flowers,’ I think that would have helped. It certainly would have cut down on the dizzying amount of sugar that I’m sure I consumed with all that fruit juice.

I might be a bit late in the weekend to get many responses, but hoping to start a thread on ‘what do parents of small kids wish their child-free friends knew about being welcoming to their kids when they’re hanging out?’ …

I’m happily child-free but getting to the age where more of my close friends have small kids. I want to do the right thing and help them and their kids feel comfortable (and safe!), but I just feel really clueless about all the ‘common sense’ that parents pick up. I’m just not interested in having kids myself so I’ve never learned much about it.

(What’s specifically sparked this is a friend wanting to bring her toddler to a small afternoon gathering that I’m hosting — I’m more than happy for this to happen, but I’ve just never had a kid at my parties before! Another time recently I had to Google at what age babies can sit in a high chair …)

June 9, 2024 at 7:10 am

Depending on age, have a “safe”** area that the kid can play in, in eyesight of the parent if they are talking to others in the general party space.

This could either mean that the wider party area is safe and you put some toys in the corner for the kids to play with, in eyesight of the parent, or that there’s a mat / enclosure / similar.

Bonus: simple distractions (eg paper and crayons, things to build with, a ball) and kid-friendly snack options – a special snack plate or lunchbox of their own would be amazing!

For a parent, having a toddler at a party tends to mean following them around to make sure they don’t break anything, being asked for food, or them wanting stimulation “look at me / look at this,” so the more you can create an environment where those 3 things are less likely and I can actually have a human adult conversation and I will be eternally grateful.

** safe = an area that is fenced off / closed off / inescapable so that the kid can’t get to the road or anything breakable or precious without an adult letting them through. Move anything at kid-friendly heights that you don’t want touched away – they will want to touch / move everything and it means as a parent you’re on high alert.

My kids are older now, but we had kids first of our friend groups so we are still somewhat in this stage of life with their younger children.

The biggest thing for all of us is timing of events. The best case scenario for a get-together is having the guests arrive late afternoon (after naptime) and then leave shortly after dinner to get everyone home in time for bed.

Everything Onwards and Forth says below is also gold. Also keep in mind that even “good” kids can break things, spill things, have accidents, etc., so keep your cleaning supplies handy and don’t let anything priceless be within reach.

If there are babies/kids under 2, a quiet place for nursing or diaper changes is really nice to have.

I went through that a number of years ago. Most of my friends’ children are closing in on collage, or already there, but it was fairly common for someone to bring the kid over for game night/movie night/what have you.
Do sweeps of any areas that the kids even MIGHT wander into for things like mouse or insect traps or baits.
Put covers on all electrical outlets.
Move any furniture that a child that age can topple over (tall, narrow stands/side tables, etc.).
Look for anything with really sharp corners that a child can hurt themselves on if they run into them at full speed.
In my experience with hosting my friends and their children, running at full speed into sharp or wobbly objects is every child’s most beloved activity. Followed closely by eating things off the floor that are deeply toxic.
A good rule of thumb is, if they CAN injure themselves with it, they WILL injure themselves with it. If they CAN’T injure themselves with it, they will break it and then injure themselves with the pieces of it.
Just assume that you are dealing with a hoard of tiny, hyperactive Steve O’s and you will be fine.

That really depends on the kid, though. Our home was obviously kid safe when our son was a baby and toddler, but when we visited our friends, all he ever wanted to do was to sit on my lap until he was about three. Even then he was a bit slow to warm up to the other kids, and he was often just getting into playing with other kids when it was time for us to leave. But regardless of age, he never tried to do anything not explicitly allowed when we were guests in other people’s homes.

So he sat on my lap, and I admit it, I let him play with my phone when he got a bit restless. Only a few minutes at a time, mind. His favorite was a paint by numbers game, and that’s when I realized that he could read single-digit numbers when he was a few months short of two years old, because he didn’t pick the colors randomly. (Math is his strongest academic subject, and when he was barely three and we went to the grocery store after work/daycare, he asked if we could buy six croissants. I scolded him a bit for being greedy, but he said they weren’t all for him, that we’d get two for him, two for Mommy and two for Daddy. Readers, I bought the croissants…)

I have two kids, two step-kids, and a bunch of next-gen descendants. I will tell you that there is no generically useful advice regarding “small kids,” “welcoming,” and “hanging out.” Individual kids’ needs change quickly over a short period of time, different kids of the exact same age have different needs, and different parents have different preferences. Even parents of small children often can’t predict what their child’s needs will be in the near future, and if they are entertaining other families, they still have to find out every family’s preferences separately.

My advice is just to ask the parents in advance what would make the event easier for them.

Very general advice that applies to a variety of ages:

– Remove small breakables from reach, and push small obstacles to the edges of the room
– Warn parents about unstable furniture, like bookcases that are not anchored to the wall
– Designate a separate space that is acceptable for parent & child to retreat to for private cuddles, soothing, reading, etc. If the child needs to nap, the parents will bring safety equipment if it’s needed, but many kids will be of an age to curl up in a spare bed or on a floor pillow
– If you regularly have small children visit, they will very much appreciate a small step stool for reaching the toilet and the sink
– Have box with a few old-fashioned, analog toys. Wood alphabet blocks, small musical toys like bells or shakers, puzzles with large chunky pieces.
– Have a small assortment of non-trendy kids books for roughly different ages.
– Offer some broadly-acceptable, non-trendy snacks and drinks

The reason I suggest “non trendy” is that you will never meet the exact threshold of what the child loves/feels comfortable with at home. When you’re a little bit off kids can have an uncanny valley response, whereas when it’s a new (to them) offering, sometimes that’s intriguing, especially in a different environment. Also their parents will bring the favored toys and treats with them.

I will give a heads-up about small food aka choking hazards. Before I had kids, “don’t give them nuts, or whole grapes” just wasn’t obvious: those are healthy foods, right? Sliced circles of hot dog are a choking hazard because, like grapes, they are circular and soft and so really good at blocking a tube.

For the specific case, I’d check with the friend about whether you should have something specific or if she just wants to bring food for tot. Fishy crackers are good bets. (Our first dog loved toddlers because she associated them with a little trail of goldfish crackers or cheerios.)

We have the opposite of this, in that we’re the first to have kids! Things a that have been hard:
– timing. If possible, let parents pick the timing. At the moment we can do an 11am brunch with basically no issues, anything 1-4 is impossible unless at our house when it’s great, 4-6 is theoretically fine but high unpredictable meltdowns, 6-8 is no good, 8-on is fine but we’ll need a sitter. But this changed all the time! So if you can be flexible on time, ask them when suits
– I love invites that are either explicitly kid friendly, or explicitly not. So like, “do you want to come to this child friendly brunch with the kids?” Or “do you want to get a sitter and join for dinner and a show?”. The in between is more stressful (are the girls invited to brunch too? Could it be an hour earlier if so? As I being annoying to everyone else by asking?)
– I think that toddlers are mostly the hardest age. Babies will come along for the ride (although especially for first time parents they are stressful and you are tired) and older kids can hang.
– safe space is great as others say
– kids are very noise sensitive. Loud dining room with background music will totally overwhelm mine so if there’s a quiet space or outdoors option that I can see them in, amazing

When my son was little, the main issues visiting other people’s houses was people with no small children have breakable stuff everywhere and often don’t have plastic cups/plates. Crawl around on your hands and knees and take note of anything that could be broken. Stuff on lower shelves and coffee tables are all fair game. Even if you “reassure” the parents that there’s nothing valuable and not to worry, the parents are worrying that their child will get cut on broken glass.

So, what should I know that seems obvious when you’re a a parent, but that you wouldn’t have thought of before you had kids?

If it’s physically possible for you, get down to the level that the kids are on – so maybe on your knees or even crawling – to see what’s on eye level. Go through the space the could conceivably get to, and see what you “see” (differently than you see it at normal standing and sitting height.)

No one mentioned electrical outlets. Either you buy plug protectors or your friends bring them every time.

If you’re going to have kids over often consider whether you want to have a gate for the top of stairs, if you have any, and whether to install cupboard latches. All poisonous substances need to go into high cupboards if you don’t latch the cupboards.

If you have any beloved breakables put them away, meaning not in a low cupboard.

Depending on toddler age anticipate they’re smart and agile enough to pull drawers out and create a ladder up to the counter height. They’re crafty :D .

If you have heavy bookcases you haven’t secured to the walls that’s a tipping hazard for you too. This is going to send like a lot of prep but you don’t want a child pulling a bookcase down on top of themselves or anyone else.

Dithering on whether to cancel a dinner date, any advice? This is someone who I was close to decades ago, but we had drifted apart and usually only saw each other when my husband and I hosted parties. the last time I saw her was pre-Covid. at that point she went on for about an hour during a coffee and barely asked me how I was doing. at that time I had just gone through some super significant health things, but I couldn’t get a breath in edgewise, Plus she also ended up on the phone with her college age son during our coffee (he was about to take a big test) After that get together, she kind of disappeared. I text her happy birthday once a year, but that’s it. Several weeks ago she texted me to ask if we wanted to have dinner with our husbands. I was polite and said yes, but tonight’s the dinner, and I’m sort of dreading it. I don’t want to officially not be her friend, but don’t want to start regularly getting together with her. Thoughts?

People on the Internet will be quick to tell you to end a relationship that isn’t entirely fulfilling you, but personally I think it’s worth investing a dinner once every several years to maintain a decades long friendship even if that’s shading into acquaintance. People who have known you for decades are not a renewable resource. Maybe your last visit wasn’t representative of the whole arc of the relationship. It’s been at least five years, right?

If she doesn’t ask about you, then tell her what you want her to know.

One dinner isn’t a commitment to start seeing her regularly again. As others have said, I would go and prepare to be pleasantly surprised by a nice time. You can decide from there how much to continue seeing her. If her tendency to monopolize conversation is tempered in a small group, maybe you can make sure any future get togethers include your husbands or another friend.

Too late to cancel now. You could have declined weeks ago, you can’t decline day of without being an AH. So go and make the best of it. Restaurant dinners are usually under 2 hours anyway.

Falling Diphthong*
June 9, 2024 at 1:41 pm

a) Worst case scenario you have a dinner and add more evidence you’ve grown apart. That seems a small risk, especially when the other outcomes are more pleasant. (e.g. you conclude that coffee was a weird one-off, rather than how she shall be forever.)

b) You committed to dinner and should do that. It’s rude to have people commit to plans on your behalf and then bail last minute–they would have made other plans themselves if you’d bailed back at the planning stages.

c) For the kid call, while I could see a version where it happens frequently and the kid needs better coping skills, much more common is to rarely speak to your college student on the phone, and so “Mom, I’m freaking out, I just know I am going to blow this test and fail this class and thus destroy my entire plan for my life” is a rare one off freakout that you should, as a parent, try to drop other things to talk this very close and very inexperienced family member through.

Go, mentally focus on the food, order something you like but hate cooking

Also as I got older, my standards for socializing have gotten lower. I don’t think anyone does it correctly. Also someone who talks about themselves too much can be a relief in some cases. Think about the alternative, someone who rapid fires questions at you!

Another thing I noticed is that people often complain about someone talking about themselves too much, as if that’s the worse social faux pas. It actually isn’t! For example, some people here focus purely on social status and social climbing type stuff way too much, “I was in Palm Beach last week, tomorrow my producer friend from LA is coming and we’re seeing Les Mis…have you ever gotten a table at Cocos?”

Gag me, much rather have someone I knew from years ago yammer on about their kid:-/

Late! But I forgot about this until just now.

We’re having a work potluck this week to celebrate summer, and I need some rough ideas of what to bring. We have a stupidly narrow fridge and two microwaves at work. I have no idea what to take, and I’m not sure I want to do a dessert since most potlucks seem to have a disproportionate amount of those. I don’t have a cake holder or large cake pan anyway, although I could get a foil pan at the grocery, I guess.

There doesn’t seem to be a sign-up sheet; it was just an email saying “Bring your favorite summer dish!” It also has to be something that can endure an hour of public transport.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

So I got off the train this morning and was on my way to work and found . . .

. . . a young cat abandoned in a carrier by the side of the road.

She’s in the utility room at work while we figure out how to get an intake appointment somewhere. I very much do not want to take her to a shelter but I can’t take in another animal, and this one is an older kitten/young adult who could get out of my kitten-fostering bathroom.

It was 78 degrees and 87% humidity at 6:30 in the morning.

Also, she’s a black cat. She’s super friendly, at least?

I hate people right now.
