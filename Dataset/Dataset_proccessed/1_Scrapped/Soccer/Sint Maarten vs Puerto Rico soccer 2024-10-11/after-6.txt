EEEEEATSCON Returns To NYC This Weekend!
October 11, 2024Food, Travel NewsEEEEEATSCON, Festival, Food, Infatuation, NYC

For the past two years, we’ve attended EEEEEATSCON NY, Infatuation’s food festival at Forest Hills Stadium.

Besides the lousy weather last year, we had an awesome time. Some highlights include  Wizard Hat Pizza, brisket from Burn’s BBQ, 1-900-Ice-Cream, getting free drinks and swag from LaCroix and attending presentations from Sarah Jessica Parker and the founders of the Infatuation.

EEEEEATSCON returns to Queens this year on October 12 & 13!

The event is in partnership with Chase Sapphire. Due to this, card members who attend can enjoy a variety of perks.

Benefits include access to the event an hour earlier than general admission. (This applies to Sapphire cardmembers who purchased 50% off pre-sale tickets.) There’s also special access to the Chase Sapphire Lounge, including a complimentary beverage, entertainment and exclusive bites from Momofuku and more (for Reserve cardmembers plus one guest)!

Reserve cardmembers could also purchase a ticket to an exclusive cocktail class with Apotheke through Ultimate Rewards.

This year, over 30 restaurants from New York and around the country will be at EEEEEATSCON. There will also be a variety of speakers doing panel conversations each day including Matty Matheson, Sophia Vergara and NBA players Amare Stoudemire and Latrell Sprewell.

We’ll be attending this year’s event. We’re looking forward to seeing what the restaurants will be offering. We plan to hit up one of my fav pizzerias in the country- L’industrie, Lucali Pasta Shop, Gotham Burger Social Club, Salt & Straw, Hoodoo Brown BBQ and many more (as long as our stomachs can handle it)!

There’s also a couple of killer collabs that we’re hoping to try, Potluck Club X Great NY Noodletown and Shake Shack x Thai Diner!

Tickets to attend EEEEEATSCON cost $41.86. While food and drinks are not included, the music, panels and entertainment are. Based on attending the past two EEEEEATSCONs, I’d say that the food is fairly priced.

It’s highly recommended to take public transportation or a ride share service to the event.  As a sponsor of the festival, Lyft is offering $5 off (2) rides for all guests with the promo code ECNYC24 to and from the event.

EEEEEATSCON is a family friendly event, good for all ages. Children ages 6 and under can attend for free, no tickets are needed!

We can’t wait for this year’s event, are you going?

EEEEATSCON takes place on October 12 & 13, 2023 at Forest Hills stadium in Forest Hills, NY.
