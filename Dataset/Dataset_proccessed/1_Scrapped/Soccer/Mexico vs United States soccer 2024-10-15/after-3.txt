GAME NOTES | FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT MEXICO

USMNT Starting XI Cap Numbers (including this match): Tim Ream (64), Antonee Robinson (48), Matt Turner (47), Brenden Aaronson (46), Yunus Musah (43), Josh Sargent (27), Joe Scally (17), Mark McKenzie (16), Malik Tillman (16), Gianluca Busio (15), Aidan Morris (9).
Mauricio Pochettino’s USMNT Starting XI has an average age of 25 years, 190 days.
The Starting XI averages 31 caps.
Mauricio Pochettino makes one change to the lineup that started Saturday against Panama, inserting Malik Tillman for Christian Pulisic, who returned to AC Milan on Sunday.
Both Tillman and midfielder Aidan Morris earn their first away starts for the USMNT tonight.
Tim Ream captains the USMNT for the 12th time tonight. The USA is 8W-1L-2D when Ream wears the armband.
Ream, who was part of a three-man backline in the USA’s 1-1 draw with Mexico in World Cup Qualifying on June 11, 2017, is one of three starters to have faced El Trí away. He’s joined by both Yunus Musah and Antonee Robinson, who started the USMNT’s 0-0 draw with Mexico in World Cup Qualifying on March 24, 2022.
Musah, Robinson and Matt Turner all collect their 10th caps of the year, tying Pulisic for the team lead in 2024.
Turner (2021-2024), is just the second USMNT goalkeeper to achieve double-digit caps in four consecutive years, joining Tony Meola who did so in five-straight years between 1990-1994.
Both Musah (2022, 2023, 2024) and Robinson (2021, 2022, 2024) hit double digit caps in a calendar year for the third time in their international careers.
Brenden Aaronson starts four consecutive matches for the first time in his international career.
Forward Josh Sargent starts back-to-back USMNT matches for the first time since the 2021 Concacaf Nations League Final Four, where the USA defeated Honduras 1-0 (June 3, 2021) and Mexico 3-2 in extra time (June 6, 2021) in Denver.
Midfielder Gianluca Busio earns his first road start since the 1-1 draw with Jamaica in World Cup Qualifying on Nov. 16, 2021.
Following the 2-0 shutout of Panama on Saturday, the backline of Joe Scally, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson work together for the second time tonight.
The USA is 24W-36L-17D in 77 matches against El Trí and 1W-23L-4D in 28 matches on Mexican soil.
