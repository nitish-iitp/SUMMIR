Fiji puts nine past Samoa to clinch semi-final berth at OFC Nations Cup

In a stunning display of attacking prowess, Fiji stamped their authority in the OFC Men’s Nations Cup 2024 with a resounding 9-1 victory over Samoa at the ANZ Stadium in Suva, Fiji. This emphatic win not only secured Fiji’s spot in the semifinals but also showcased their offensive capabilities in front of their home crowd.

The match began with an early breakthrough from Setareki Hughes of Rewa FC, who wasted no time in opening the scoring within three minutes. Hughes cut inside from the right flank and unleashed a precise left-footed strike past Samoa’s goalkeeper Joel Bartley, setting the tone for Fiji’s dominance.

Fiji’s attacking trio of Hughes, Thomas Dunn, and Roy Krishna continued to torment Samoa’s defense throughout the match. Dunn doubled Fiji’s lead with a well-timed header before Roy Krishna extended the advantage further with a penalty just before halftime, making it 3-0.

Samoa showed resilience early in the second half, pulling one back through Luke Salisbury’s composed finish, but Fiji quickly reasserted their control. Thomas Dunn earned and another penalty and star Roy Krishna added his second of the match with a powerful strike from the spot.

The floodgates opened further as Setareki Hughes notched his second goal of the game, showcasing his speed and finishing ability. He then turned provider, setting up Navua’s Filipe Baraviala for Fiji’s sixth goal with a precise pass.

Nabil Begg added another deserved goal for his great performance having the assisted being provided by substitute Ivan Kumarto further inflate Fiji’s lead. Ba’s Etonia Dogalau added himself two more goals towards the end, completing Fiji’s staggering 9-1 victory.

Coach Robert Sherman’s side demonstrated exceptional teamwork and clinical finishing, leaving no doubt about their credentials in the tournament. With this win, Fiji not only secured a place in the semifinals but also sent a strong message to their upcoming opponents. Samoa downgraded their performance from the last match where they lost only by 2-0 against Tahiti.

As Fiji prepares to face Tahiti in their final group stage match, followed by a semifinal clash in Port Vila against either New Zealand or Vanuatu, their confidence and momentum are at an all-time high. Meanwhile, Samoa will regroup ahead of their final group game against Papua New Guinea, aiming to salvage pride in their remaining matches.
