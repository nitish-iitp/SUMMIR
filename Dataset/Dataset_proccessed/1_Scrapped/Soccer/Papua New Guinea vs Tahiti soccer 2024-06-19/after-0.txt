Thrilling Deadlock: Papua New Guinea improves their game to keep the semi-finals chances alive as they draw against Tahiti

The OFC Men’s Nations Cup 2024 Group B match between Tahiti and Papua New Guinea ended in a thrilling 1-1 draw on match day two. Both teams remain in contention for a semi-final spot as they prepare for the final group match to be played in Suva.

Papua New Guinea dominated the early stages of the match, but it was Tahiti who struck first. In the 14th minute, a brilliant counter-attack orchestrated by Samuel Garcia’s squad saw Matéo Degrumelle sprint past the defense. Degrumelle skillfully drew out Papua New Guinea’s goalkeeper Ronald Warisan before chipping the ball into the far corner to give Tahiti a 1-0 lead.

Papua New Guinea responded swiftly. Forward Tommy Semmy led the charge, with Hekari United midfielder Ati Kepo playing a crucial role. Kepo beat his defender in the box and unselfishly passed to an unmarked Pala Paul, who slotted the ball into an open net in the 23rd minute, leveling the score at 1-1. The remainder of the first half saw Papua New Guinea pressing hard for another goal, with Semmy and Yagi Yasasa both coming close, but Tahiti’s defense held firm.

Warren Moon’s halftime talk appeared to invigorate Papua New Guinea as they began the second half with renewed energy. Emmanuel Simon narrowly missed the target with a shot from the edge of the area shortly after the break. Tahiti had a golden chance to reclaim the lead just past the hour mark when captain Teaonui Tehau found himself one-on-one with Warisan, but the goalkeeper made a crucial save.

Papua New Guinea almost capitalized on a counter-attack when Semmy delivered a low cross to a late-arriving Ati Kepo, but the midfielder couldn’t quite reach the ball. The match continued at a frenetic pace into stoppage time. Papua New Guinea dominated possession but failed to break down Tahiti’s resolute defense. A major incident occurred late on as Tahiti’s Matatia Paama received a red card for lashing out at Ati Kepo following a clash in the air.

With the draw, both teams now look forward to Saturday and the final match day of the group stage. Papua New Guinea will face Samoa, while Tahiti will take on co-hosts Fiji, with both matches crucial in determining who advances to the semi-finals.
