The next instalment of the rivalry between Germany and Netherlands takes place in Munich in the UEFA Nations League on Monday night.

After sharing the spoils in Amsterdam last month, the two meet once again in one of the fiercest international football derbies that stretches back 50 years.

With both nations still unbeaten at the halfway stage, the two look set to progress to the quarter-finals at the expense of Hungary and Bosnia-Herzegovina, who remain winless in League A Group 3.

Germany's only dropped points so far came in the reverse fixture last month, as they have recorded wins over the other two sides in the section and sit top.

Julian Nagelsmann's men did need to avoid a late scare to get over the line with a 2-1 win in Zenica against Bosnia on Friday night though.

A first-half double from Deniz Undav set them on their way, and the Germans also had two goals disallowed with VAR, but Edin Dzeko's strike 20 minutes from time made it a nervy ending.

Holding on for their win means Germany have moved onto seven points now though, the same tally they managed in the entire of the previous edition of the Nations League, when they only avoided relegation thanks to England's poor showing.

The Nations League has certainly not brought the best out of Germany, as they have never reached the finals, but they have only ever suffered one defeat on home soil in the competition.

That does not mean a win is certain here, though, because despite being the much more accomplished nation, Germany have only won two of the previous eight meetings against the Netherlands.

Four of those eight have ended level though, including the meeting at the Johan Cruyff Arena last month, and a repeat of that outcome will please Ronald Koeman and the Dutch side, as that should take them one step closer to reaching the finals for a third time in four editions.

While they will not quite reach the heights of their last campaign when Holland took 16 points from a possible 18, they have shown courage to come from behind to draw in their last two outings.

In Budapest on Friday, Virgil van Dijk's red card looked like it had finished off Oranje's hopes of taking anything against Hungary, but like he did against Germany, Denzel Dumfries popped up with an equaliser to keep them in the top two.

That extended Holland's unbeaten run to seven games away from home in the Nations League, but this trip to Bavaria will seriously threaten that streak, especially being without Van Dijk at the back.

The retirement of Manuel Neuer finally gave Marc-Andre ter Stegen the chance to step up as Germany's number one after a decade as the deputy, but the Barcelona man is now out for the season after his awful injury against Villarreal last month.

Two of Germany's most in-form talents have also pulled out with injury, with Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz not available for Nagelsmann, while Niclas Fullkrug has had a difficult start at West Ham United, meaning Tim Kleindienst and Jonathan Burkardt were both handed debuts against Bosnia.

Undav will be the man to watch, though, as the Stuttgart striker has scored eight in eight games since netting in the reverse game last month.

Van Dijk's suspension means Matthijs de Ligt is likely to start at the back for the Netherlands, despite his recent troubles since joining Manchester United.

Daley Blind's retirement and injuries to Nathan Ake, Jurrien Timber and Quilindschy Hartman means the Dutch are very short on options at left-back, so Micky van de Ven is set to be shifted out there once more.

Koeman is also light in the centre of the park, with Frenkie de Jong a long-term absentee, and Teun Koopmeiners, Jerdy Schouten and Joey Veerman all absent as well.


Germany possible starting lineup:
Nubel; Kimmich, Rudiger, Tah, Mittelstadt; Andrich, Pavlovic, Gross; Wirtz, Undav, Gnabry

Netherlands possible starting lineup:
Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, De Ligt, Van de Ven; Gravenberch, Reijnders, Q. Timber; Simons, Zirkzee, Gakpo



We say: Germany 3-1 Netherlands

Both scored five on matchday one and served up an exciting draw a few days later in Amsterdam, so there is nothing to suggest that these two will not produce another thrilling encounter.

The Dutch looked insipid against Hungary, though, and were fortunate to come away with a point, so the Germans are understandably favourites here, sitting top of the section and benefiting from home advantage.
