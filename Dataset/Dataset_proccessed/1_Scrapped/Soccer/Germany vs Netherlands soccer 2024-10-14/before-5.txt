Germany lineup vs. Netherlands: Predicted XI for fierce UEFA Nations League clash

Julian Nagelsmann will have to do without in-form duo Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz when Germany face bitter rivals Netherlands in the UEFA Nations League on Monday night.

Musiala and Havertz pulled out of the squad late, with many uncapped players drafted into the squad, and some were handed debuts in the win over Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday.

After many good years at Heidenheim, Tim Kleindienst, now of Borussia Monchengladbach, was thrown straight in at the deep end for his first cap, while Jonathan Burkardt was also given his debut off the bench.

However, more experienced options may be preferred here against stronger opposition in a very important fixture to the German supporters.

Deniz Undav's double means he is undroppable at present, considering those two strikes added to his tally of eight goals in his last eight games, while Florian Wirtz is also one of the first names on the team sheet.

Serge Gnabry started on Friday, and may well do so again, but in a more familiar role out wide, after starting as a number 10 in Zenica.

Aleksandar Pavlovic was set to start against Bosnia, but a knock in the warm up saw him drop to the bench, so even though he is a doubt, he should start if he passes a late fitness test.

Niclas Fullkrug's difficult start at West Ham United in terms of both playing time and injury means he is not in the squad, so Undav is set to be the starting striker, after playing out wide against Bosnia.

Nagelsmann is also without a number of defenders who withdrew after the announcement of his squad, with Benjamin Henrichs, David Raum and Robin Koch all unavailable, even if they were unlikely to be starters.

Those injuries in other areas of the squad mean Joshua Kimmich could play either at centre-back, right-back or in the centre of midfield here, but what is for certain is that he will captain the side in his 95th cap.

On the other end of the spectrum, all three of Germany's goalkeepers were uncapped heading into this window, and it was Alexander Nubel who was given the nod over Oliver Baumann and Janis Blaswich on Friday.

That opportunity has arisen due to the awful injury that has likely ended Marc-Andre ter Stegen's season, just as he was getting used to being the Germany number one after Manuel Neuer's international retirement.

Germany possible starting lineup:
Nubel; Kimmich, Rudiger, Tah, Mittelstadt; Andrich, Pavlovic, Gross; Wirtz, Undav, Gnabry
