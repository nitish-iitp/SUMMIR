UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 1-2 GERMANY - DENIZ UNDAV STRIKES TWICE TO GIVE SECURE NATIONS LEAGUE WIN IN ZENICA
BYJONATHAN DAVIES

UPDATED 11/10/2024 AT 21:44 GMT

Deniz Undav was Germany's hero as his double helped them to a 2-1 UEFA Nations League win over Bosnia and Herzegovina in Zenica. The Stuttgart man bagged his brace in the first half to put the visitors in control and could have had a hat-trick but for VAR intervention after the break. The home side did set up a nervy finish when Edin Dzeko pulled one back but Germany held on.

Germany maintained their unbeaten start to this season’s Nations League after holding on for a narrow 2-1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Deniz Undav’s first-half brace put the visitors in control in Zenica.

Edin Dzeko halved the deficit with 20 minutes remaining, but Julian Nagelsmann’s side held out to strengthen their position at the Group A3 summit.

SZOBOSZLAI PANENKA EARNS HUNGARY LAST-GASP DRAW AGAINST GERMANY

19/11/2024 AT 22:36

Germany broke through on the half-hour mark when Florian Wirtz beat the offside trap to latch onto Joshua Kimmich’s lofted ball into the area. He then showed great awareness to tee up Undav, who neatly slotted a first-time finish beyond Bosnia goalkeeper Nikola Vasilj.
The hosts almost responded five minutes later with Ermedin Demirovic hitting the bar. However, within 60 seconds, they were 2-0 behind when Maximilian Mittelstadt’s inviting cross was turned in by Undav from close range.
Undav thought he had his hat-trick just before the hour mark, only to be called for offside following a lengthy VAR review.
The offside flag also thwarted Serge Gnabry before Bosnia gave themselves hope 20 minutes from time, when Dzeko rose to nod in Benjamin Tahirovic’s corner.
However, it proved a consolation for the hosts, as the visitors held out for victory.
TALKING POINT - GERMANY PUT TROUBLESOME TRAVELS TO ONE SIDE
With this result - and Netherlands being held in Hungary - Germany now have a two-point cushion at the top of Group A3.
Although favourites to claim the three points, this had the potential to be a banana skin for Nagelsmann’s side.
Indeed, they had won just four of their previous 13 matches outside of Germany, and just one of their nine away games in the Nations League.
However, after withstanding Bosnia’s positive start, Undav’s quickfire brace swung the contest firmly in their favour. And but for the offside flag, which denied them three times, their lead could have been even more comfortable.
As it was, they had to ensure their concentration levels did not wane after Dzeko’s header, but they did so effectively to make it seven points from a possible nine.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH – DENIZ UNDAV (GERMANY)
Having opened his senior international account against Netherlands last time out, Undav built on that momentum with a well-taken brace.
He showed great composure by tucking away Wirtz’s layoff for his first goal, while his predatory instincts were evident for the second, which was put on a plate by Mittelstadt.
Undav, who had an xG of 1.05, registered the most shots in the contest (four), and went agonisingly close to completing his hat-trick with an effort that drifted just wide, before he was thwarted by VAR.
PLAYER RATINGS
Bosnia: Vasilj 6, Gazibegovic 6, Kolasinac 6, Katic 6, Barisic 6, Gigovic 6, Huseinbasic 6, Burnic 6, Basic 6, Demirovic 7, Dzeko 7. Subs: Tahirovic 7, Saric 6, Hajradinovic 6, Bajraktarevic 5, Tabakovic N/A.
Germany: Nubel 7, Mittelstadt 8, Kimmich 8, Rudiger 7, Tah 6, Andrich 6, Gross 7, Wirtz 7, Gnabry 7, Undav 9*, Kleindienst 7. Subs: Stiller 6, Gosens 6, Burkadt 6, Fuhrich 6, Anton N/A.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
25’ JUST WIDE: Receiving the ball on the edge of the box, Gross takes aim with a fierce strike that flashes just wide of Vasilj's near post.
30’ GOAL!!! BOSNIA 0-1 GERMANY (UNDAV): The visitors break through after half an hour! Wirtz beats the offside by latching onto Kimmich’s long ball over the top of the Bosnia defence. He then shows great awareness to lay it back for the onrushing Undav, who neatly slots home first time.
35’ OFF THE BAR: After the referee waves away penalty appeals for a challenge on Gnabry, Bosnia counter with Demirovic leading the charge. The winger accelerates away from Andrich and is one-on-one with Nubel, but the woodwork comes to Germany's rescue as his shot crashes against the crossbar.
36’ GOAL!!! BOSNIA 0-2 GERMANY (UNDAV): Two for Undav, two for Germany. They are in control here! Following a neat build-up down the left, Mittelstadt works space to whip the ball into the six-yard box, where a sliding Undav arrives to apply the finishing touch.
59' OFFSIDE, NO GOAL: Undav's hat-trick will have to wait for the time being. He thinks he has it when he scrambles the ball home after Kleindienst's initial effort was parried by Vasilj. However, following a VAR review, offside is the outcome.
70' GOAL!!! BOSNIA 1-2 GERMANY (DZEKO): Hope rekindled for the hosts! They halve the deficit as Tahirovic's deep corner is met by Dzeko, whose powerful downward header is too hot for Nubel to handle. Can they go on and grab an equaliser now?
