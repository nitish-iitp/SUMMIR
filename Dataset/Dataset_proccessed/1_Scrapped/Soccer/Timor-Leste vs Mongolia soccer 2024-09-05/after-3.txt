BATAVIA — The Avon River Hawks boys’ soccer program entered a new era in 2024, and it started on a high note.

The River Hawks (1-0) knocked off the Batavia Blue Devils 3-0 on Wednesday at VanDetta Stadium to begin Section V play.

In the first half, Caden Leonard and Josh Harter scored two goals for Avon, and the River Hawks took a 2-0 advantage into halftime. In the second half, Trevor Stroud showed off his powerful leg by drilling a ball into the net on a free kick, pushing the Avon lead to three, and the team never looked back.

Jack DeVito started in net for Avon, finishing with 9 saves and a shutout performance. DeVito was one of the best goalkeepers in the GLOW region in 2023 and started the 2024 campaign with a statement game between the pipes.

For Batavia (0-1), goalkeeper Harry Mellander finished with 5 saves. However, he came off his line many times throughout the contest and made several nice plays with his legs when the Blue Devils defense passed the ball to him.

Next up for the River Hawks is a contest against the Bath-Haverling Rams at 6:30 p.m. on Monday at the Haverling Soccer Complex. Bath-Haverling started its season on Wednesday with a 3-2 loss vs. Arkport-Canaseraga.
