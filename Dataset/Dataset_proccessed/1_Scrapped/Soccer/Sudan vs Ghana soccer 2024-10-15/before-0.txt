AFCON 2025 QUALIFIERS: Ghana 0-0 Sudan -Match Report
By Papa Kwamena Egyir - October 10, 2024 321 0

Ghana’s ambitions to improve their standing in the AFCON 2025 qualifiers suffered a setback on Thursday as they were held to a frustrating goalless draw against a determined Sudan team at the Accra Sports Stadium.

Despite a strong start, the Black Stars struggled to capitalize on their opportunities, leaving their qualification hopes precariously hanging in the balance.

Ghana began the match brightly, with Alexander Djiku hitting the crossbar just four minutes in, following a well-placed corner from Mohammed Kudus.

Their offensive efforts continued when Antoine Semenyo forced a remarkable save from Sudan’s goalkeeper, Mohamed Mustafa Ahmed, in the 17th minute.

As the match progressed, Sudan found their rhythm, effectively stifling Ghana’s creativity and making it challenging for the Black Stars to penetrate their well-organized defense.

Kudus remained a constant threat, nearly scoring with a powerful shot early in the second half, but once again, he was thwarted by Mustafa’s excellent goalkeeping.

The closest Ghana came to breaking the deadlock was in the 88th minute when Kudus, in a prime position, failed to convert, and Mustafa’s crucial goal-line save preserved a point for Sudan.

With only two points from three matches, Ghana faces a daunting task as they prepare for their crucial return fixture on October 15, 2024, at the Martyrs of February Stadium in Libya.
