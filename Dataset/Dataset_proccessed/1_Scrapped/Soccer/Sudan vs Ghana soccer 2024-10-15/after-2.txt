Some Black Stars players

The Black Stars of Ghana were defeated 0-2 by Sudan in the second leg of the 2025 African Cup of Nations qualifiers in Libya on October 15, 2024.

The Black Stars were far from their best as they struggled to string passes together and push forward to threaten the Sudanese defence.

Mohammed Kudus, Antoine Semenyo, Inaki Williams, and their teammates struggled to find their best form, failing to create chances and pose a threat to the Sudanese as they had in the first game at the Accra Sports Stadium.

Ahmed Hamed Mahmoud Mohammed and Yousif Yagoub scored the two goals for Sudan to defeat the Black Stars.

The Sudanese team, led by Ghanaian James Kwasi Appiah, dominated the game and created good chances, which resulted in their deserved victory.

After four matches played, Ghana lies in third place in Group F with two points, Sudan in second place with seven points, while Angola leads with nine points, waiting to play their fourth game.

Prior to this game, Ghana drew one-all against Niger, lost to Angola at home by a goal to zero and drew goalless at home against Sudan.

The Black Stars will travel to face Angola and play the last match against Niger in Ghana.

The chances of the team qualifying have become slim, with a defeat in any of the next two games likely to jeopardize the team’s chances of qualifying for the 2025 AFCON in Morocco.
