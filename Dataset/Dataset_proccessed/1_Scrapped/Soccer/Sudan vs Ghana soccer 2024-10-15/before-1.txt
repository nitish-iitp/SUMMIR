The Black Stars players appeared cheerful as they engaged in their recovery session after a frustrating stalemate against Sudan on Thursday, October 10, 2024.

Players who had more minutes in the match participated in less intense routines, while those with little or no playing time practised more intense drills.

The team is expected to hold another final training session at the Accra Sports Stadium on Saturday before departing for Libya on Sunday for the return leg against Sudan on October 15, 2024.

Ghana is currently without a win in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series after three matches and must win all their remaining games to qualify for the tournament.

A slip-up in any of the last three matches will complicate their qualification, forcing them to rely on favourable results in other games within the group.

The Black Stars currently sit third in Group F with 2 points. Angola leads with 9 points, followed by Sudan with 4 points, while Niger occupies the bottom spot with 1 point.
