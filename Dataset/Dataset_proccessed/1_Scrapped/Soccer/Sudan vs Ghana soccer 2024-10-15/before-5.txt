Ghana have two points from three games

The Martyrs of February Stadium in Benghazi, Libya, will host Ghana’s must-win encounter against Sudan in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Tuesday, October 15, 2024.

The game comes barely five days after the Sudanese battled the Black Stars for a hard-fought draw at the Baba Yara Stadium.

Sudan, by virtue of the draw, kept their second-place spot in the group and are in a good position for qualification to the 2025 AFCON.

Ghana, on the other hand, must win this game to put themselves in the frame for qualification to the AFCON, which will be held in Morocco.

Below are three things GhanaWeb believes Ghana must do to beat Sudan:

Convert the chances

In the first leg at the Accra Sports Stadium, Ghana created six big chances and failed to convert any of them.

If the Black Stars are to qualify, then the players cannot afford to miss the huge chances they fluffed in the first leg.

The likes of Antoine Semenyo, Mohammed Kudus, and Inaki Williams must get their scoring boots on and do the job for Ghana.

Take advantage of the set-pieces

In the first leg, Ghana had as many as sixteen corner kicks, yet none of the corners resulted in a goal.

For a team that lacks a potent goal-scorer, set-pieces are great avenues for goals, and the Black Stars must take advantage of these chances.

Be wary of the Sudanese fast-breaks

For Sudan, a draw in this game is not really a doom result, so they will not come out of their shells and attack Ghana. They are most likely to set up in the same fashion they did in the first leg.

However, with their pacey wingers, they have threats in attack, and the Black Stars must be wary of their quick counter-attacks.

The players, particularly fullbacks and defensive midfielders, should be careful not to lose concentration as they could be caught off-guard.
