The loss in Libya puts Ghana’s qualification hopes for the tournament in serious doubt

Ghana’s Black Stars suffered a crucial 2-0 defeat to Sudan on Tuesday, 15 October 2024, in their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Qualifiers second-leg match.

The loss in Libya puts Ghana’s qualification hopes for the tournament in serious doubt.

Ahmed Hamed Mahmoud broke the deadlock in the 62nd minute after a failed clearance in the Ghanaian box led to a scramble, with Mahmoud capitalising on Gideon Mensah’s clearance to tap the ball into an empty net, giving the Falcons of Jediane a 1-0 lead.

Just three minutes later, Sudan doubled their advantage when Mohamed Abdelrahman outmuscled Ghanaian defender Mohammed Salisu and slotted the ball past goalkeeper Lawrence Ati-Zigi, making it 2-0.

Ghana came close to pulling one back when Inaki Williams volleyed a cross from Tariq Lamptey, but his effort went wide, failing to break Sudan’s defense.

Despite late efforts from Coach Otto Addo's side, the Black Stars were unable to score, leaving their qualification chances in peril.

The loss leaves Ghana third in Group F with just two points from four matches, drawing two and losing two.

The Black Stars now face a must-win situation in their upcoming matches in November against Niger and Angola, with other results needing to go in their favour to keep their AFCON 2025 qualification hopes alive.
