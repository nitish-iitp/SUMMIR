TELL ME MORE

It was a feisty affair from the start, with both sides flying into tackles in a way that befits a semifinal. Both teams came out strong, sending clear, physical messages.

Colombia, ultimately, sent the most important message - an opening goal, the ultimate decision maker in a 1-0 victory that sends them to the Copa America final Sunday against Argentina.

It came from the head of Jefferson Lerma, who thumped home from the center of the box to give his side a 39th-minute lead. James Rodgriguez provided the assist, his sixth of the tournament, and Colombia was rolling.

The celebration of that goal was short-lived, however. In first-half stoppage time, Daniel Munoz was sent off with a second yellow card for an elbow, leaving Colombia short-handed for the entire second half.

Yet, despite all of Uruguay's efforts, they could never break down Colombia, who held strong throughout the second 45. The final 20 minutes were all Uruguay, but, aside from a Luis Suarez shot that caromed off the post, Colombia prevented their opponents from taking advantage of their extra man.

DID YOU KNOW?

Colombia had only made the Copa America final twice in the tournament's history. They won the title in 2001, their most recent final appearance, while finishing as runners-up to Peru in 1975.

THE MVP

James Rodriguez:

He did it again.

Somehow, Rodriguez continues to turn back the clock, playing just as well, if not better, than he did back in 2014. He's the quintessential South American No. 10, one that can win you the game with just one swing of his leg.

The Colombian star needed just one cross to turn the tide and it was a perfect one. All Lerma had to do was put it on frame, as it was delivered on a platter.

With Rodriguez in this type of form, Colombia can dream about, perhaps, beating another legendary No. 10 in the finale.

THE BIG LOSER

Darwin Nunez:

He had his chances, as he often does, but Nunez just couldn't convert.

It's his MO, isn't it? The volume is always there - the quality, less so. Nunez had two legitimate chances in the first half but couldn't put either on frame.

If Nunez can bury one of those chances, Uruguay could have been flying into the semifinal. Instead, it's another case of missed opportunities for a player that is so, so close to figuring it all out. After the match, he was also involved in an altercation with Colombia fans that could ultimately result in discipline.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Up next for Colombia is the Copa America final, which will be held on Sunday in Miami. Awaiting them are Argentina, as Lionel Messi and Co. look to make it a second consecutive Copa America title.

Uruguay isn't done, though, as they'll face Canada in Charlotte on Saturday in the third-place game.
