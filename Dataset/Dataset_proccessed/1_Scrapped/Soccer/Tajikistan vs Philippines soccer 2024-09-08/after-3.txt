Philippines vs Tajikistan in Merdeka Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.–CONTRIBUTED PHOTO

The Philippine men’s football team came up short against Tajikistan, 4-3, on penalties after their 90-minute match for third place in the Merdeka Cup ended in a scoreless tie Sunday at Bukit Jalil Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Jefferson Tabinas and Jarvey Gayoso missed the first two attempts of the shootout, with both spot kicks hitting the crossbar, which opened the door for Tajikistan to salvage a podium finish while extending the Filipinos’ winless streak to nine consecutive matches.

But a gallant showing should give the team something to look forward to despite coming into the invitational tournament in transition mode following the departure of Belgian coach Tom Saintfiet for Mali and the appointment of Norman Fegidero as interim.

Wednesday’s Merdeka Cup opener saw the Philippines lose 2-1 to Malaysia, but not before Fegidero’s side stunned the hosts by taking the early lead on Tabinas’ goal.

The Philippine Football Federation is set to continue the process of finding a permanent replacement for Saintfiet following the Merdeka Cup campaign, though the men’s team is also returning to action next month for the King’s Cup in Thailand.

The Philippine side had several opportunities to find the back of the net, with Bjorn Kristensen, Sandro Reyes, Gayoso and substitute JB Borlongan forcing Tajikistan keeper Olek Baklov to make key saves that kept the match scoreless.

Dylan Demuynck had one attempted volley seconds into the second half, but the ball rattled the bar, foreshadowing the Philippines’ fortunes later on in the match.
