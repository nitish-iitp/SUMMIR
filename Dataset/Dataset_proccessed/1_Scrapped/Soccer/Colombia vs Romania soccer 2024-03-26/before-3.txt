Preview: Colombia vs. Romania - prediction, team news, lineups

Colombia and Romania continue the respective build-ups ahead of their upcoming major tournament appearances with a friendly in Madrid on Tuesday.

While the South American nation are on one of the longest current unbeaten runs in international football, Romania are on a high having qualified for Euro 2024.

With an unbeaten run stretching 20 matches, everyone associated with Colombia would have recognised that the streak was at risk of being ended when they faced Spain on neutral territory on Friday night.

However, Nestor Lorenzo's side were able to deliver a standout 1-0 victory in London, with Daniel Munoz netting the only strike for his first goal for his country.

Including matches in December that featured a second-string squad, Colombia have now won five times in succession and are playing with enough confidence to put themselves in the running for the Copa America.

As recently as November, Colombia posted a 2-1 victory over Brazil, with the 1-0 success in Paraguay that followed leaving La Tricolor third in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying standings.

That takes a back seat until the autumn, though, with Nestor focused on his side continuing to build momentum in friendlies against Romania and the USA before they start their Copa America campaign.

From Romania's perspective, Edward Iordanescu will have mixed feelings about the progression of his side ahead of Euro 2024.

First and foremost, this is a group of players that have not lost in 12 outings and qualified for the upcoming major tournament without suffering a single defeat.

On the flip side, Iordanescu was left bitterly disappointed with just a 1-1 draw being posted against Northern Ireland on Friday.

Having taken just 16 minutes to get back on level terms after the visitors' early opener, Romania were unable to force a winner in a game that they were tipped to dominate.

Romania are unbeaten in four matches against Colombia, winning World Cup fixtures in 1994 and 1998, as well as posting a goalless draw in a friendly in 2006.

With as many as 12 substitutes not being used against Spain, it is plausible to expect Lorenzo to make sweeping changes to his Colombia XI.

David Ospina, Yerson Mosquera, Yaser Asprilla, James Rodriguez and Rafael Santos Borre are some notable names who could be included.

Luis Diaz played 90 minutes against Spain and could be rested, while young Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Gustavo Puerta may be drafted into the side for his debut.

Iordanescu is also expected to tinker with his Romania side, with Andrei Ratiu and Adrian Rus both in contention to start in defence.

Goalkeeper Horatiu Moldovan may be given a run out between the sticks, while Adrian Sut and Ianis Hagi are options further forward.


Colombia possible starting lineup:
Ospina; Arias, Mosquera, Lucumi, Fuentes; Lerma, Puerta; Asprilla, Rodriguez, Gomez; Borre

Romania possible starting lineup:
Moldovan; Ratiu, Dragusin, Rus, Manea; Stanciu, Sut, Cicaldau; Hagi, Puscas, Coman



We say: Colombia 2-0 Romania

We expect Romania to give a better account of themselves than they did against Northern Ireland, that draw potentially acting as the catalyst for an improved performance here. However, we cannot back against Colombia, who may prevail through a goal in each half.
