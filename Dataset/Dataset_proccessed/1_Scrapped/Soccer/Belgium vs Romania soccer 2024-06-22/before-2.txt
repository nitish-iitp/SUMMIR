'André is not even my name': Amadou Onana forced to correct reporter – video
This article is more than 6 months old

The Belgian midfielder Amadou Onana was left visibly frustrated after a reporter called him 'Andre' in a post-match interview. 'Andre is not even my name, mate. Do you know what I mean?' he said, calmly rebuking the journalist who had been trying to get his attention. André Onana, whom Amadou had been mistaken for, is a Cameroonian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Manchester United. The video has gone viral online and fans have been marvelling at Onana's seamless switch from French to a clear English accent as he addressed the new reporter.
