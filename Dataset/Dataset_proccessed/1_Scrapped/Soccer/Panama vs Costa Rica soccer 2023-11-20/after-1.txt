OPINION
Things I’m thankful for in my sports world

This is the time of year for reflection, appreciation and kindness to one another. Given the state of national and international affairs, I thought I would offer aspects and occurrences in the sports world and my life that I am thankful for, in the hopes that those of us in the industry can appreciate and express their own forms of thanks.

I’m thankful for:

■ Streaming services like ESPN+ and YouTube TV that provide me the opportunity to enjoy Oklahoma State sports and Pittsburgh Steelers football despite living a thousand miles away. I also appreciate the sports programming on Prime Video, Netflix and Peacock that offer insightful and inspiring programming like “The Saint of Second Chances.” If you haven’t seen it, I guarantee you will be thankful for what you have and appreciate the struggles of finding your mission in life and how to get there — but mostly the pure enjoyment of having fun at a baseball game.

■ A Homecoming Friday night in Stillwater, Okla. I know most schools have a homecoming weekend, but not to this extent. Fraternities and sororities work for weeks creating elaborate lawn decorations and floats that attract a crowd of 100,000, far exceeding the population of the town and the campus. A Saturday morning parade followed by football and fantastic tailgating, unless you opt for local culinary delights like Hideaway Pizza and Eskimo Joe’s bacon/cheese fries (I’m especially thankful for those).

■ Opening Day of baseball season. Sure, it might be a little cold and the fans might be dressed for football season, but the first game after winter, the smell of freshly mowed grass and the exuberance of people coming together to celebrate traditions and the American pastime — and every team is undefeated!

■ The great broadcasters and storytellers who describe the games and provide stories and depth to complete the experience. I grew up in Pittsburgh with the legendary Bob Prince calling Pirates games but also have experienced Harry Caray, Marv Albert, Vin Scully and one of my all-time favorites, Lindsey Nelson, who was responsible for me adding the Cotton Bowl to my bucket list.

■ Walking the grounds of Augusta. I’ve only been once, but it’s a memory that is easy to conjure up. The colors, the scenery, the reverence, the challenging golf holes and the focus and concentration of the golfers. But my favorite part? Taking off my shoes and socks and walking on the lush grass. If you think you know what lush grass is, you really don’t until you have been to Augusta.

■ Authors providing fictional and nonfictional accounts of the sports world. While Dan Jenkins is my all time favorite, I have loved the writing of Pat Jordan, W.P. Kinsella, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Bill Veeck, Jim Bouton and Willie Morris to name a few. If you haven’t read Morris’ “The Courting of Marcus Dupree,” you missed a great narrative about an amazing football talent and a history lesson about the South.

■ Attending an NCAA championship. I’ve been to soccer, baseball, men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s volleyball, wrestling, and softball. Perhaps because I played competitive softball until I was 69, I’m particularly thankful for the competition, sportsmanship and athleticism I’ve seen at the Women’s College World Series in Oklahoma City, which I have been referring to as the University of Oklahoma Invitational — what a dynasty!

■ Having been a YMCA director and a coach. Sure I gave up a lot of Saturday mornings after working all week, but there is something special about watching it all come together for a young boy or girl. Watching them learn how to play, be part of a team, compete but mostly enjoy. In Stillwater, I had the opportunity to coach a young man named Chris Holt in basketball who went on to a solid and respectable high school athletic career. I felt real joy coaching Chris as he worked hard to improve and was able to enjoy his own progress as he developed.

■ My wife, Sharon, enjoying attending and watching sporting events. This has been a huge blessing as we probably watch 100-plus Pittsburgh Pirates games in person or through MLB Extra Innings each year. We also watch Steelers and Oklahoma State games together and this year plan to watch the Oklahoma City Thunder and a few of my other favorite NBA teams.

■ The opportunity to work for David J. Stern. A life-changing experience that provided an opportunity to develop and demonstrate my skill as a pro sports executive and sport marketer and also made me a much better professor when I returned to my academic life. It also provided me the best mentoring experience I have ever had.

Finally, I’m thankful for all of the amazing men and women I taught over 34 years beginning at Robert Morris University, The Ohio State University, the DeVos Program at the University of Central Florida, the Vinik Program at the University of South Florida and now in retirement as a professor of practice at the University of South Carolina. I have had the privilege of teaching/advising future SBJ Forty Under 40 honorees, television personalities, national championship coaches, general managers, entrepreneurs, collegiate athletic directors, agency leaders and pro sport personnel. Absolutely one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I’m in a fantasy football league with students that I had in class in the early 1980s, I have a child named after me (thanks Hunter Lochmann and Sutton) and I can go to almost any major city in the U.S. and have dinner with one or more of my Sutton Alumni. I have fond memories of class trips to Los Angeles and London, Fox Sports Speaker Series and great experiential learning projects with real-world clients.

Finally, thank you dear readers and Happy Thanksgiving.
