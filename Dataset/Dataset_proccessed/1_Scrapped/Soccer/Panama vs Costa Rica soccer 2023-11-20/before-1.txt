The US men's national team are aiming for a third straight CONCACAF Nations League title, starting with a quarterfinal clash against Trinidad and Tobago.

After a 2-0 victory over Canada secured their most recent title, the United States earned automatic qualification to this stage. Despite a 5-3 loss to Curacao, Trinidad and Tobago secured the second spot in Group A thus making it to this round. 

Led by coach Gregg Berhalter, the USA are not just aiming for another Nations League title, but also an automatic place in the 2024 Copa America.

Trinidad and Tobago, led by Dennis Lawrence, are making their first appearance beyond the group stages since the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup, having won their first three matches by a slim one-goal margin.

The quarterfinal first leg takes place in Austin, Texas with a start time of 9 p.m. ET. The Sporting News details the team news for the game here.

USMNT starting lineup vs Trinidad and Tobago

Even with the absence of key players such as Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah due to hamstring injuries, the USA still possesses a strong team, featuring notable players like Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna and promising talents such as Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun.

Berhalter is a coach who is unlikely to sway from his usual 4-3-3 formation unless circumstances change drastically.

It remains to be seen whether Reyna or Malik Tillman are deployed on the wing, while the other ends up as the main attacking midfielder.

USA starting lineup (4-3-3): Turner (GK) — Dest, Carter-Vickers, Ream, A. Robinson — McKennie, Musah, Tillman — Reyna, Balogun, Paredes.
