Burundi beat Malawi in AFCON qualifier Group L opener
 September 5, 2024
 FSL News

The Intamba of Burundi were impressive against host Malawi’s Flames as they defeated the home team 3-2 at the Bingu National Stadium on Thursday.

Burundi’s opening goal came from Chimwemwe Idana’s own goal in the 22nd minute, which was then equalized by Chawanangwa Kaonga’s 31st-minute goal for Malawi.

Burundi took the lead again, through Jean Claude Girumugisha two minutes later, but Malawi fought back with a goal in the second half when Lanjesi Nkhoma capitalized on Kaonga’s assist, sending the fans into ecstasy.

In a competitive battle, Burundi sealed the win with a goal by Mokono Elie Eldhino in the 87th minute – making the score 3-2.

The game ended with no further goals during the additional four minutes of play. With this win, Burundi is currently at the top of Group L as Senegal prepares to host Burkina Faso on Friday.

The Flames will travel to Bamako, Mali for their second Group L match against Burkina Faso next week. Malawi will face Senegal back-to-back in October. On the other hand, Burundi will host Senegal at BNS.
