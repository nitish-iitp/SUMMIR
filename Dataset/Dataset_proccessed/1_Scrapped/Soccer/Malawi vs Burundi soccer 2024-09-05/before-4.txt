BLANTYRE-(MANA)-Flames head coach, Patrick Mabedi on Friday named 28 players, a squad for 2026 African Cup of Nation (A FCON) qualifiers against Burundi and Burkina Faso on September 5 and 10, 2024.

Innocent Nyasulu, George Chikooka, Brighton Munthali, Mark Lameck, Nickson Mwase, Maxwell Papillon, Stanley Sanudi, Lawrence Chaziya, Nickson Nyasulu, Precious Sambani, Denis Chembezi, Llyod Aaron, Wongani Lungu, Wisdom Mpinganjira, Chimwemwe Idana, Uchizi Vunga, Patrick Macheso, Chikondi Kamanga, Lanjesi Nkhoma, Patrick Mwaungulu, John Banda, Yamikani Chester, Robert Saizi, Zeliat Nkhoma, Gaddie Chirwa, Chawanangwa Kaonga and Chifundo Mphasi are the players ready for the AFCOM 2026

Speaking during the briefing at Mpira Stadium in Blantyre, Mabedi said he believes in his competitive squad which will make a significant impact on the continental stage of the 2026 AFCON qualifiers and urged football lovers to accept his decision as he has brought a winning squad.

“Let us all believe in the squad, I am assuring football lovers that these players will succeed and play according to my system,” said Mabedi.

He added that the team needs to do things without other international players like Gabadinho Mhango citing that as a coach he focuses on players that will fit in his system.

In separate interview with sports expert, Frank Kandu said the squad lacks depth “but there isn’t much that the coach can do, adding that it lacks real hitman and stickers considering that every team needs goals”.

“Every team needs goals and more goals but the squad have few strikers. There no real hitman there.  Let’s wait and see if the one entrusted will deliver on the match day”, said Kandu, adding that the team needs a player like Gaba’s calibre.

He said it was unfortunate that the coach did not pick him, adding Gaba is not too old to play.
