TELL ME MORE

Roberto Martinez's troops had little trouble in dispatching a toothless Sweden at the Estadio Dom Afonso Henriques in Guimaraes despite restsing several first-team players in Diogo Dalot, Joao Cancelo, Danilo Pereira, Otavio, Ruben Neves, Vitinha and Joao Felix - as well as Ronaldo. It was a lively start to the match with Sweden seeing more off the ball in the first 10 minutes but they soon faded away as Portugal grew into the game. They were soon rewarded for their persistence as Leao broke the deadlock in the 24th minute. After the woodwork denied Bernardo Silva, the rebound fell kindly for Leao who packed his effort with power and precision.

Less than 10 minutes later, Matheus Nunes doubled the lead as Sweden's defence was once again sliced open by some exceptional individual brilliance by the Manchester City midfielder. After dancing past three defenders, Nunes pulled the trigger and his shot had enough power to beat Robin Olsen between the sticks. Just before half-time, Fernandes made it 3-0 after Nelson Semedo drilled in a low cross across the face of the goal.

Matinez took off Leao, Pepe, and Nuno Mendes at half-time but Portugal continued to look ominous. They weaved their first meaningful attack after the break in the 57th minute and converted it into a goal with Bruma getting on the scoresheet after being set up by Fernandes. Viktor Gyokeres did pull one back but Goncalo Ramos soon restored the four-goal advantage after he scored his eighth international goal in just 11 appearances. Gustaf Nilsson reduced the deficit in the 90th minute but it was too little too late.

DID YOU KNOW?

Roberto Martinez has won his first 11 matches as Portugal's manager and hence boasts of a 100 per cent win record.

THE MVP

Fernandes was the standout player for Portugal and in Ronaldo's absence, he looked like a leader on the pitch. He was the primary orchestrator in midfield, created several chances and deservedly got the goal to cap off a fantastic evening.

THE BIG LOSER

It was Jon Dahl Tomasson's first game on the Sweden bench and the manager would have hoped that his players could have showed more grit against a second-string Portugal side. But the manner in which his defence was dismantled time and again by Fernandes and Co, mean he will be a worried man.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

After an emphatic victory against Sweden, Portugal will march on and will be back in action to face Slovenia on March 26. The match might see the return of the big guns like Ronaldo, Joao Felix, Otavio, and Joao Cancelo which will make them even more formidable. Meanwhile, Sweden will host Albania on the same day in their second friendly of the window.
