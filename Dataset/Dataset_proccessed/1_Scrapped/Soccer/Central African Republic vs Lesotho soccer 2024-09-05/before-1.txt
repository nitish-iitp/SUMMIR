Preview: Central African Republic vs. Lesotho - prediction, team news, lineups

The Central African Republic and Lesotho will begin their quest to reach their first-ever Africa Cup of Nations when they face off in their opening match of qualifying on Thursday evening.

With none of the stadiums in either of these countries being suitable for international competition, both nations will play their 'home' games in this tournament in Morocco.

The Central African Republic are making their ninth appearance in AFCON qualifying since 2000-01 but have never managed to progress to the main stage and will be hoping that this is their year.

However, given that group B in this competition also features African powerhouse Morocco and the formidable Gabon, most would agree that Les Fauves's chances of qualifying are relatively thin.

Nevertheless, Raoul Savoy's side will enter the qualifiers with confidence after a few morale-boosting performances this year, including two easy friendly victories over Bhutan and Papua New Guinea back in March.

Thereafter, CAR put in a resilient performance to hold on to a one-goal advantage over Chad in World Cup qualifying before a thrilling match against Ghana, which they only narrowly lost 4-3 in June.

This is the first time that these two will meet in a recognised international match but both would have had this fixture down as the most likely to bring them a victory in this competition.

Meanwhile, ranked 149th in the world and 45th of 53 CAF nations, Lesotho are comfortably the lowest-ranked side in group B. With Morocco being the highest-ranked team in Africa and Gabon currently inside the top 20, it is fair to say the Southern African outfit have a serious task ahead.

Adding to the expectation that Likuena are going to find it tough in this section is their recent record, which shows that the side have failed to win any of their last four matches, including a winless campaign at the COSAFA Cup in July.

Since the arrival of Leslie Notsi back in November last year, the new boss has recorded just two wins in his first 12 matches at the helm, while splitting the remaining 10 five draws and five losses.

However, the one positive for Lesotho is that they are still in contention to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, with the side currently two points behind group leaders Rwanda and South Africa after four matches.

Louis Mafouta, who plays for Ligue 2 club Amiens, scored a remarkable hat-trick for CAR against Ghana in their World Cup qualifier in June and should continue to lead the line this week.

Karl Namnganda is the most likely to partner Mafouta in the two-man frontline, while Marseille's Geoffrey Kondogbia and Brad Pirioua are expected to partner up in the 'hosts' engine room.

Notsi has included eight players that apply their trade in neighbouring South Africa in his squad, including the likes of Thabo Makhele, Teboho Letsema and Motebang Sera.

Tlotliso Phatsisi was released by Premier Soccer League outfit Sekhukhune United this summer but is included in the squad, while Katiso Thamae and Letlotlo Molomo have earned their first call-up for national duty.


Central African Republic possible starting lineup:
Youfeigane; Yangao, Yoga, Ndobe, Tatolna; Baboula, Pirioua, Kondogbia, Solet; Namnganda, Mafouta

Lesotho possible starting lineup:
Moerane; Makhele, Malane, Mokokoane, Matlabe; Fothoane, Toloane, Lebokollane, Mokhachane; Makateng, Thabantso



We say: Central African Republic 2-1 Lesotho

The Central African Republic have looked very good this year and would have taken massive heart from that performance against Ghana back in June. While this is not actually a home game for Les Fauves, we fancy they will secure all three points in this one.
