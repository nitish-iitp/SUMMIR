We said: Central African Republic 2-1 Lesotho
The Central African Republic have looked very good this year and would have taken massive heart from that performance against Ghana back in June. While this is not actually a home game for Les Fauves, we fancy they will secure all three points in this one. Read more.

The most likely scoreline for a Central African Republic win was 2-0 with a probability of 16.07%. The next most likely scorelines for that outcome were 1-0 (15.88%) and 3-0 (10.85%).
