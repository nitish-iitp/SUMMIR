Central African Republic took charge of Group B in their initial 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier this week following a 3-1 win over Lesotho at Stade El Abdi on Thursday night.

Central African Republic got the game off to a dream start at Stade El Abdi as Lousi Mafouta opened the scoring with just one minute on the clock.

Shell-shocked by The Wild Beasts' early lead, Likuena were forced to sit back during the opening stages of the match.

As the dust settled in El Jadida, Lesotho began seeing more of the ball and looked tidy in possession, while the Central African Republic looked dangerous during counter attacking situations.

The Wild Beasts doubled their advantage in the 23rd minute of the match, with Mafouta causing all kinds of problems going forward.

Following a swift passing move toward the 18-yard-area, Mofouta spotted the onrushing goalkeeper who made his way toward the edge of the box before guiding the ball toward an empty net.

CAR ended the half on a confident note and bossed the possession count moments before the referee called time on the first 45.

Lesotho were often seen chasing shadows in an attempt to regain the ball but were largely unsuccessful in doing so.

Despite a largely disappointing first half, Lesotho did not rest on their laurels and drew one goal back 10 minutes after the restart with Motebang Sera joining Mafouta on the scoreboard.

However, Central African Republic restored their two-goal advantage in the 62nd minute as Goduine Koyalipou capped off a swift passing move into the 18-yard-area.

With it being Central African Republic’s turn to play under the cosh, Lesotho dominated on the ball after the 80th minute mark while the Wild Beasts were content at kicking into game-management mode.

Despite having the bulk of the possession count in the second half, Lesotho were unable to cause notable damage to the CAR backline as the clock began to expire.

Nevertheless, CAR held their nerve to secure their first victory of the 2025 Afcon qualifying campaign.

CAR: (2) 3 (Mafouta 1’, 23’, Koyalipou 62’)

Lesotho: (0) 1 (Sera 56’)

CAR: Youfeigane, Ndobe, Gambor, Tatolna, Kondogbia, Youga (Yangao 43’), Solet, Mafouta (Yawanendji 83’), Koyalipou (Godame 82’), Namnganda (Urie 65’), Baboula (Dangabo 65’)

Lesotho: Moerane, Rasethuntsa, Malane (Sefoli 81’), Matlabe (Matsoele 46’), Lebokollane, Makhele, Thabantso, Fothoane (Letsema 81’), Sefali (Mokhachane 81’), Matsau (Phatsisi 46’), Sera
