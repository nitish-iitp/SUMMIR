Mediation efforts on ending the war in Gaza are ongoing, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson said in a press briefing.

Separately, he said escalation in the Red Sea represented a “big danger”.

He was speaking a day after US and UK forces carried out fresh strikes against Yemen’s Houthi fighters who have disrupted global shipping in protest over Israel’s war in Gaza.

Qatar, whose mediators are involved in talks on the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas, has also helped mediate in several regional conflicts including in Afghanistan.

Summary of the day so far...

Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday, by far the biggest single-day Israeli death toll in the three-month-old war. An Israeli military spokesperson said 21 soldiers were killed when two buildings they had mined for demolition collapsed after militants fired grenades at a nearby tank. Reports in local media said explosives set by the soldiers detonated prematurely. Earlier, the military said three soldiers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza.

Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said it had been an “unbearably difficult morning” after hearing news of the deaths of the Israeli soldiers in Gaza. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said Israel would push on with fighting in Gaza until “absolute victory”.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Israeli bombardment was continuing in the vicinity of al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, with gunfire from Israeli drones targeting “anyone moving around” the hospital.

The Gaza health ministry said a total of 25,490 Palestinians had been killed and 63,354 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October. At least 195 Palestinians were killed and 354 injured in the past 24 hours, the ministry added.

Israel’s military said its troops had encircled Khan Younis. “Over the past day, IDF troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area. The area is a significant stronghold of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade,” the military said.

The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, said action to degrade Houthi military capabilities would continue after the UK and US launched a fresh wave of airstrikes against the rebel group on Monday. “What we’ve done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks,” he told broadcasters.

A Houthi army spokesperson said the latest US-UK strikes against the rebel group in Yemen would not go “unanswered” or “unpunished”.

Israel has given Hamas a proposal through Qatari and Egyptian mediators that includes up to a two-month pause in the fighting as part of a multi-phase deal to free all the hostages being held in Gaza, Axios reported on Monday. The first phase would reportedly involve the release of women, men over 60 and those in critical medical condition.

Twenty-four Israeli soldiers killed in deadliest day for Israeli forces of Gaza war

Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday, by far the biggest single-day Israeli death toll in the three-month-old war.

As we reported earlier, an Israeli military spokesperson said 21 soldiers were killed when two buildings they had mined for demolition collapsed after militants fired grenades at a nearby tank.

Reports in local media said explosives set by the soldiers detonated prematurely.

Earlier, the military said three soldiers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza.

The large death toll of Israeli troops in fighting comes at a time when Israel is beginning to see the first stirrings of discontent with Benjamin Netanyahu’s war strategy, which aims to “crush” Hamas but which has not involved detailed discussion of what would come next for Gaza.

Reuters has some more quotes from Abeer Etefa, the World Food Programme’s spokesperson for the Middle East, on the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.

Etefa said there was a “systematic limitation on getting into the north of Gaza, not just for the WFP”.

“This is why we’re seeing people becoming more desperate and being impatient to wait for food distributions, because it’s very sporadic,” she said. “They don’t get it frequently and they have no trust or confidence that these convoys will come again.”

The UN humanitarian office this month said Israeli authorities were systematically denying it access to northern Gaza to deliver aid and this had significantly hindered the humanitarian operation there.

Israel has previously denied blocking the entry of aid.

The World Food Programme (WFP) has said that very little food assistance has made it beyond southern Gaza since the start of the war.

“It’s difficult to get into the places where we need to get to in Gaza, especially in northern Gaza,” said Abeer Etefa, the WFP’s spokesperson for the Middle East.

“Very little assistance has made it beyond the southern part of the Gaza Strip … I think the risk of having pockets of famine in Gaza is very much still there.”

Palestine Red Crescent says Israeli gunfire targeting 'anyone moving around' al-Amal hospital

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said Israeli bombardment is continuing in the vicinity of al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, with gunfire from Israeli drones targeting “anyone moving around” the hospital.

It said earlier on Tuesday in a post on X that its ambulances were unable to reach the injured, and said in a separate post that a civilian was killed by Israeli gunfire at the entrance of the hospital.

Israel says Hamas fighters operate in and around hospitals, which Hamas and medical staff deny.

US officials said the latest US-UK airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen have degraded the Houthis’ ability to carry out complex attacks.

But, according to Reuters, they have declined to offer any specific numbers of missiles, radar, drones or other military capabilities destroyed so far.

“We are having the intended effect,” a US military official told Pentagon reporters.

Death toll in Gaza reaches 25,490, says health ministry

A total of 25,490 Palestinians have been killed and 63,354 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday.

At least 195 Palestinians were killed and 354 injured in the past 24 hours, the ministry added.

Most of the casualties have been women and children, the ministry has said, and thousands more bodies are likely to remain uncounted under rubble across Gaza.

Israel's military says its troops have encircled Khan Younis

Israel’s military said on Tuesday that its troops had encircled the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, Reuters reports.

“Over the past day, IDF troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area. The area is a significant stronghold of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade,” the military said.

“Ground troops engaged in close-quarters combat, directed (air force) strikes, and used intelligence to coordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists,” it said.

Israel launched an offensive last week to capture Khan Younis, which it says is the principal headquarters of the Hamas militants responsible for the 7 October attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.

Nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have lost their homes and the vast majority are now penned into small towns just north and south of Khan Younis, many sleeping rough in makeshift tents with food and medicine running out and no clean water.

Palestinians said Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals since Monday had left the injured beyond the reach of rescuers.

Dead people were being buried inside the grounds of Khan Younis’s main Nasser hospital because it was unsafe to leave to reach the cemetery, according to Reuters.

Another Khan Younis hospital, al-Khair, was stormed by Israeli troops who arrested staff there, and a third, al-Amal, where Red Crescent rescuers are based, was cut off and unreachable, according to Palestinian officials.

US-UK airstrikes will not go 'unpunished', Houthis warn

A Houthi army spokesperson has said the latest US-UK strikes against the rebel group in Yemen will not go “unanswered” or “unpunished”.

The spokesperson said:

The American-British aggression aircraft launched 18 airstrikes during the past hours, distributed as follows: 12 raids on Amanat al-Asimah and Sana’a governorate, three raids on Hodeidah governorate, two raids on Taiz governorate [and] a raid on al-Bayda governorate.

These attacks will not go unanswered and unpunished.

The US and UK said they had conducted “an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes” against eight Houthi targets on Monday, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.

The number of targets is considerably lower than the 60 struck in the first air raids on Yemen made by the two countries 10 days earlier, while their effect and the number of casualties caused is uncertain.

The latest raid marks the eighth time the US has conducted strikes on Houthi targets this month and the second time that the UK has participated.
