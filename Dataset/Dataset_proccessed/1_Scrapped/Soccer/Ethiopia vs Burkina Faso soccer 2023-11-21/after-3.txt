 November 21, 2023

The Les Étalons of Burkina Faso recorded their first win in the 2026 World Cup qualifier over Ethiopia Walias on Tuesday in Morocco.

All three goals were scored in the second half at El Jadida, Morocco, to claim up to second behind Egypt.

The Burkinabess opened the scoring in the 69th minute through a Blati Touré (Burkina Faso) right-footed shot from the centre of the box to the centre of the goal, assisted by Bertrand Traoré.

Ten minutes later, Bertrand Traoré (Burkina Faso) converted a penalty with a left-footed shot to the high centre of the goal.

Their third came in the 90th minute from Dango Ouattara’s right-footed shot from the centre of the box to the centre of the goal.

Having opened their campaign with a 1-1 draw against Guinea Bissau third on Friday, they now secured four points from their opening two matches ahead of Bissua on goal difference. 

Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Djibouti are fourth, fifth and sixth on the table, respectively, following matchday two.

Elsewhere, South Africa suffered a serious setback in Group C after losing to Rwanda in Butare. Rwanda won 2-0 both goals in the first half, while the South Africans battled to create attacking opportunities for themselves.

Rwanda tops the group with four points, followed by South Africa with three, Nigeria, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe with two apiece and Benin with a point – precisely on the table.
