Preview: Kazakhstan vs. Slovenia - prediction, team news, lineups

Both well beaten in midweek, Kazakhstan and Slovenia will aim to bounce straight back when they meet in the UEFA Nations League on Sunday.

The threat of relegation looms large at the halfway stage, as the pair now trail Norway and Austria in the League B Group 3 standings.

Following promotion from the Nations League's third tier in 2022, Kazakhstan played their first League B fixtures in September, when they held Norway to a goalless draw before losing 3-0 to Slovenia in Ljubljana.

RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko helped himself to a hat-trick to leave the Hawks with just one point on the board, consigning them to fourth place in the table.

Stanislav Cherchesov's side are now in real danger of automatic demotion, as Thursday's trip to Austria brought a humbling 4-0 defeat, in which they conceded 29 shots at goal and had only one-third of the ball.

Having previously posted six wins from 10 Euro 2024 qualifiers, not long after winning promotion in the Nations League, such setbacks will surely have hit the Kazakhs' confidence coming into Sunday's game in Pavlodar.

Precedent is not on their side either, as not only were Kazakhstan beaten by a three-goal margin in Slovenia last month, but they also lost twice to their next opponents during qualifying for the Euros.

Slovenia kicked off their campaign with a 1-1 draw against Austria, before getting the better of their Kazakh counterparts on home turf - but they suffered a heavy defeat in their first October international.

In midweek, Matjaz Kek's men went down to a 3-0 loss against Erling Haaland-inspired Norway, managing just two shots on target to their hosts' tally of 14.

The Manchester City striker drilled home an early opener after Jan Oblak could only parry Antonio Nusa's stinging shot into his path, before going on to become his nation's all-time top scorer midway through the second half.

As a result of that reverse, Slovenia are on a five-game winless run away from home in the Nations League - a streak featuring three draws and two defeats.

Having earned promotion to League B for the 2022-23 edition, they finished third last time out, behind Serbia and Norway; this season, that would mean facing a relegation playoff.

Though they are still in the mix for a playoff to enter League A, Slovenia's current position means they cannot afford to slip up on Sunday: finishing fourth when the action wraps up next month will result in automatic demotion.

Cherchesov paired Bauyrzhan Islamkhan and Aybar Zhaksylykov in attack against Austria, but Adana Demirspor striker Abat Aymbetov may be brought back in, despite his lack of match fitness.

Cherchesov could alternatively turn to Artur Shushenachev - who last featured in June 2022 but has now been recalled - as the hosts try to score for the first time this season.

Leading marksman Bakhtiyor Zaynutdinov has only played six minutes for Besiktas this term, yet he is still set to continue operating on the Hawks' right wing.

Once again, Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak will captain the visitors, whose most notable absentee is injured Udinese midfielder Sandi Lovric; the latter's clubmate Jaka Bijol helms Slovenia's defence.

At the other end of the pitch, Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko will aim to add to his 10 goals for club and country so far this season, with Andraz Sporar set to join him up front.


Kazakhstan possible starting lineup:
Shatskiy; Astanov, Alip, Kasym, Vorogovskiy; Zaynutdinov, Tagybergen, Orazov, Samorodov; Aymbetov, Islamkhan

Slovenia possible starting lineup:
Oblak; Janza, Drkusic, Bijol, Balkovec; Stojanovic, Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Sesko, Sporar



We say: Kazakhstan 0-1 Slovenia

After a miserable showing in midweek, Kazakhstan do not look like causing Slovenia many problems in the final third, with most of their main forwards short of playing time at club level.

The visitors are still hoping for a top-two finish, and they can stay in contention by edging out their hosts in Pavlodar.
