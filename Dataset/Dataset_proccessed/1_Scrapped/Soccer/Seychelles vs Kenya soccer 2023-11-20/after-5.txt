Football: Fifa World Cup Africa qualifiers |20 November 2023

          Second group match against Kenya today

 

Seychelles lost 0-9 to Ivory Coast on Friday in its first match of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers, allowing the African giants to set a record winning margin for a World Cup qualifier in Africa.

At the Alassane Ouattara Stadium, commonly known as the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpé on Friday, Sebastien Haller of Borussia Dortmund opened the floodgate in the 20th minute of play from the penalty spot, before Nottingham Forest’s Ibrahim Sangare made it 2-0 four minutes later.

Simon Adingra made 3-0 for Ivory Coast in the 36th minute, before Karim Konate added a fourth for Ivory Coast, concluding the first half 4-0 in favour of the home side.

In the 61st minute, Seko Fofana made it 5-0, before Hamed Traore added a sixth goal to the Ivory Coast’s tally in the 72nd minute.

Jean-Philippe Krasso made it 7-0 in the 84th minute, before Ivory Coast scored two more goals in added-time – Traore 90+4 and Konate 90+6 – rounding up the match 9-0 in favour of the home side.

It is worth noting that Seychelles goalkeeper Carlos Simeon made several excellent saves to prevent further humiliation for Seychelles in the one-sided rout.

The players of lead coach Ralph Jean-Louis will be in action again today, playing their second group match against Kenya at Stade Félix-Houphouët-Boigny.

In the other matches played in the group, Burundi defeated the Gambia 3-2, while Gabon edged out Kenya 2-1.

Burundi and Gabon were on the fixtures last night, while Ivory Coast will play against the Gambia today.
