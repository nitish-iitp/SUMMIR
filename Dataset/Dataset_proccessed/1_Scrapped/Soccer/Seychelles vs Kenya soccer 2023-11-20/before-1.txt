KENYAN DEFENDER JOSEPH OKUMU PLOTTING MOVE TO A BIG CLUB AFTER SETTLING AT REIMS

Harambee Stars defender Joseph Okumu has ambitions of making a big-money switch to one of the world’s top teams even after turning down lucrative offers last summer

Kenyan defender Joseph Okumu has his eyes cast on an even bigger club after moving to French side Stade de Reims from Belgian club KAA Gent in the summer transfer window.

Okumu rejected major offers in favour of a €12 million move to Reims where he believes is a perfect opportunity to continue learning and developing.

However, his camp feels it is just a stepping stone to a big-money move to one of Europe’s top teams in either the Premier League, Bundesliga, or LaLiga.

“When it comes to transfers, nothing complicated, just clubs doing business and we work for our client to have a good project both financial and sporting side,” said Okumu’s agent Omar Banza.

“After Reims we still don’t know. Right now, our client is happy where he is, focusing on achieving something with the club but of course, we are still dreaming. Playing in France is a good step forward though not the destination yet.”

Okumu was rumoured to have attracted interest from a host of top European sides with Premier League giants Arsenal and Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund among those mentioned but he opted for a switch to France instead.

Banza believes his client has all the attributes to succeed at a top club not just because of his quality but also the way he conducts his business, a trait that sets him apart from others.

“Working together, he is a top professional. Our motivation comes from him. He is professional, he knows what he wants and that makes it easy to work with him,” he added.

Okumu has already shown his quality in France, becoming a key member of Will Still’s side, having started nine of the 10 matches he has been available for.

His impressive displays earned him a spot in the Ligue 1 team of the month for October and it is such recognition and performances that will make it hard for Reims to hold onto him.

The former Chemelil Sugar defender has had a meteoric rise since moving to Europe in 2019 to join Swedish top-flight club IF Elfsborg.

He spent two years in Sweden before switching to Gent in June 2021 in a deal worth €3.5 million and he is now in France after a similarly successful stint in Belgium.
