International update: Konate's Ivory Coast smash nine
How our boys got on over the weekend
NEWS
NOVEMBER 20TH, 2023

Karim Konate has certainly been enjoying the international break with the Ivory Coast! Les Éléphants made a dream start to World Cup qualification with a 9-0 thumping of the Seychelles! Our 19-year-old attacker had a fantastic match with two goals and two assists. At 17:00 CET they face Gambia before Konate returns to Salzburg.

 

Dorgeles Nene and Mali have also enjoyed a successful start to World Cup qualifying. The 3-1 win over Chad featured a substitute appearance from the 20-year-old. They also have another game today at 20:00 CET against the Central African Republic.

Serbia qualify for first Euros

The entire nation is in footballing heaven and Strahinja Pavlovic is in the thick of it! A 2-2 draw against Bulgaria saw the Orlovi secure their very first spot in the Euros. Our centre-back is usually a regular for Serbia but was rested for the decisive qualifier - which did not dent his euphoria in the slightest.

Petar Ratkov was called up for the Serbian U21 squad for a key European qualifier against England. The young Serbs lost 0-3. 

 

Israel (with Oscar Gloukh in the starting line-up) are in danger of missing out on automatic qualification after a 1-2 defeat to Romania in European qualifying! They still have a chance in the spring via the UEFA Nations League-Play-off though. Amar Dedic and Bosnia also have a chance in that after a disappointing qualification campaign.

Leandro Morgalla and Germany U21 are doing batter, having taken their third win in three matches in a European qualifier against Estonia (4-1). Our defensive youngster started and was taken off at half-time. On Tuesday (18:00 CET, ProSieben MAXX) there will be a clash against Poland, who are currently group leaders with 12 points from four matches.

 

France U21 suffered their first defeat of the qualifying campaign with Lucas Gourna-Douath (who was brought on in the 13th minute). A 0-2 loss was suffered against Austria's youngsters. Our midfield enforcer still has a friendly match against South Korea U21 to contest today.

 
Still to come

Alexander Schlager is set for action again on Tuesday after a superb EURO 2024 qualifying campaign. Austria host neighbouring Germany for a showcase friendly match at a sold-out Ernst-Happel Stadium in Vienna (live on ORF 1 and ZDF in Austria).

Luka Sucic was ill for Croatia's 2-0 win against Latvia but will be ready to take part again in the crucial final qualifier against Armenia on Tuesday at 20:45 CET (DAZN). A win would take Croatia into the EURO finals.
