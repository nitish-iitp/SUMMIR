MORE PLACES

The expansion to 48 participants in the next World Cup will allow Africa the opportunity to have up to 10 teams represented, doubling the number it had in the previous edition of the tournament. This significant increase in places is especially notable in Africa and Asia, as these are the two continents that experienced the largest increase thanks to the implementation of the "new World Cup".
