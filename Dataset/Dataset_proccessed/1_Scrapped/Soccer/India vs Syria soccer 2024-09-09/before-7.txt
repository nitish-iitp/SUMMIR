Syria clash with Mauritius for the first time (PC: Getty Images)

Mauritius and Syria lock horns at the G.M.C Balayogi Athletic Stadium in Hyderabad, India on Friday for the 2024 Intercontinental Cup. This is a tri-nations tournament with the hosts also involved.

Ranked 179th in the world, Mauritius began their campaign with a goalless stalemate against India on Tuesday at the same venue. Les Dodos had only 35% possession in the game, but managed to hold off the home side with stoic defending.

Having lost the previous three games in a row, the island outfit extended their unbeaten run to two games, previously overcoming Eswatini 2-1 in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

On the other hand, Syria are looking to return to winning ways after back-to-back defeats in the World Cup qualifiers. North Korea beat them 1-0 before Japan crushed the Middle East side 5-0, having gone their previous four official matches without a loss.

Head coach Jose Lana has summoned 23 players for their Intercontinental Cup campaign in India, including experienced midfielder Mahmoud Al-Mawas. The Al-Shorta star has made 93 appearances for Syria and struck 15 times.

There are four uncapped players in the squad - goalkeeper Elias Hadaya, defensive duo Ali Al Rina and Ahmad Faqa, and midfielder Mustafa Abdullatif. Prolific forward Omar Khribin, who has 27 goals for the side, misses out yet again.

Mauritius vs Syria Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
This is the first official clash between the sides in history.
After going four games without a loss, Syria have lost the next two: 1-0 vs North Korea and 5-0 vs Japan.
Having lost thrice in a row earlier this year, Mauritius have gone the next two unbeaten: a 2-1 win vs Eswatini and a 0-0 draw vs India.
Syria are ranked 93rd in the world; Mauritius are 86 places adrift of them.
Mauritius vs Syria Prediction

Mauritius will be confident of their chances after holding out India in their last game, but Syria are a different kettle of fish. The Qasioun Eagles can be a deadly attacking side on their day, and despite missing Omar Khribin here, can cause them plenty of problems.

It won't be easy for the Middle East side, but we expect them to prevail nonetheless.

Prediction: Mauritius 0-2 Syria
