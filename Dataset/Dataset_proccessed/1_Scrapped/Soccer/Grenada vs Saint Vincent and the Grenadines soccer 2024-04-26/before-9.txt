By Mercy Matonga:

In a move that suggests that State Vice President Saulos Chilima’s delegated duties have been fully reinstated, President Lazarus Chakwera has directed the second-in-command to represent the Republic in Tanzania.

The move comes nearly two years after Chakwera stripped Chilima of all delegated powers over alleged involvement in corruption following an investigation report into Zuneth Sattar’s contracts with the Malawi Government.

In 2022, Chakwera suspended Chilima’s powers following allegations from Malawi’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) that Chilima allegedly accepted kickbacks in government contracts involving the United Kingdom-based businessman.

Tuesday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Chakwera had delegated Chilima to attend the 60th Anniversary of Union Day of the Republic of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs the public that President Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera has delegated Vice President Saulos Klaus Chilima to attend the 60th Anniversary of the Union Day of the United Republic of Tanzania to be held in Dar es Salaam on Friday, April 26th 2024,” the statement reads.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Charles Nkhalamba confirmed the development in a separate interview.

“Yes, the statement released is from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and it was an invitation extended to the President [Chakwera] but it has pleased the President to delegate Right Honourable Chilima to represent him at the celebration,” Nkhalamba said.

Chilima’s court case in relation to the corruption allegations continues.

When announcing the withdrawal of delegated powers to Chilima, Chakwera said he made the decision to relieve Chilima of official duties since the Constitution does not give the President powers to suspend or fire a sitting Vice President.

“The best I can do for now, which is what I have decided to do, is to withhold any delegated duties from his office while waiting for the bureau to substantiate its allegations against him,” Chakwera said, “and to make known its course of action in relation to such.”

Reacting to the announcement, civil society representatives accused Chakwera of inconsistency in his decision-making.

And, in an interview, Centre for Social Accountability and Transparency Executive Director Willy Kambwandira said there is a need for the President to be clear on the issue.

“The President should openly address [Malawians on] the issue,” he said.

In a separate interview, Youth and Society Executive Director Charles Kajoloweka also criticized the President for inconsistency in his decision-making processes.

“It is clear that the President has been inconsistent in how he has been handling his own decisions. It will be important if the President communicates to the public if he has reviewed his decision and this is not just limited to the Vice President. You would recall that the President suspended other officials for similar cases, and we only saw the President rehiring the same individuals at the state House,” Kajoloweka said.

Responding to the decision change, State House Press Officer Antony Kasunda referred us to the Minister of Information Moses Kunkuyu, who is also government’s official spokesperson.

In his response, Kunkuyu said the President has, nonetheless, maintained a cordial working relationship with the Vice President.

He said the cordial relationship has involved the President’s regular practice of including the Vice President in all Cabinet meetings as well as meeting with him regularly to discuss matters of State.

“In this regard, by continuing to withhold ministerial portfolios from the Vice President, the President remains committed to a policy of non-interference in the functions of the Judiciary by the Executive branch as prescribed by law.

“At the same time, by continuing to maintain a cordial working relationship with the Vice President, the President also remains committed to the practice of treating the Vice President as someone the Constitution presumes to be innocent until proven otherwise by a fair trial before an independent court of law,” Kunkuyu said.
