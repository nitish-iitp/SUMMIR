 posted in: National teams, News, OFC news |

New Zealand begin their campaign to qualify for next year’s FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup when they meet New Caledonia at midday on Monday (NZT).

It’s the first group game for New Zealand at the OFC U-16 Women’s Championship which decides which nation will represent Oceania at the 2025 World Cup.

The eight-nation OFC tournament is being staged in Suva, Fiji.

The New Zealand squad named by new women’s U-17 head coach Alana Gunn, and features 15 players based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and three based in Australia and Canada.

Seven players were part of the squad who won the 2023 OFC U-16 Women’s Championship to qualify for the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup 2024, set to be held in the Dominican Republic this October.
