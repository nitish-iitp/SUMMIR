TONGA PREVIEW: BIT OF AN UPSET

In qualification for the OFC Nations Cup back in March, the Cook Islands saw off Tonga by a goal to nil but still finished second in the three-team qualifying group below Tonga’s upcoming opponents, Samoa.

However, in their preliminary round semi-final of OFC qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup the other day, Tonga pulled off a surprise 3-1 defeat of Cook Islands with goals coming from Viliami Tikoipau, Hemaloto Polovili and Christopher Kefu.

SAMOA PREVIEW: HEAVY FAVOURITES

Among the weakest and lowest ranked sides in Oceania, Samoa are probably widely viewed as the best under the management of Jess Ibrom with the Samoans currently ranked 192nd in the world by FIFA.

In what did appear a mis-match before the game, especially being played in Samoa, the Samoans pulled off an impressive 2-0 defeat of American Samoa the other day with goals coming from Dilo Tumua from the penalty spot and then a late strike from Jarvis Vaai.

TONGA TEAM NEWS: FULLY FIT AND AVAILABLE

Tonga eased to victory against Cook Islands the other day and they have no injury concerns or suspension issues for this one so are expected to be unchanged against Samoa.

PREDICTED XI (4-1-3-2): Otukolo; Teu, Palei, Kite, Tu’amoheloa; Feke; Fifita, Polovili, Tukia’ Sonasi, Tikoipau

UNAVAILABLE:

SAMOA TEAM NEWS: LEIATAUA SUSPENDED

Despite that comfortable victory against American Samoa in the preliminary round semi-final, the Samoans will be without Alton Leiataua due to a red card in that game.

PREDICTED XI (4-3-3): Taupau; Tolo Kent, Setefano, Chote, Salisbury; Tumua, Fasi, Mariner; Kwan, Vaai, Viliamu

UNAVAILABLE: Leiataua (Suspended)

TONGA VS SAMOA PREDICTION

Tonga have already caused something of a mini upset in the semi-finals of this OFC 2026 FIFA World Cup preliminary round stage by beating Cook Islands so they have thrown a cat amongst the pigeons. However, especially with their home advantage, Samoa were always expected to progress into the group stages. It may not be overly convincing or a hammering but the Samoans remain the team to back in this preliminary round final.
