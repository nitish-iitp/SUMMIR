As the journey to the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations heats up, Chad and Mauritius are set to clash in a pivotal preliminary qualification round on Friday, March 22, 2024. This encounter, scheduled for 6pm UK time at the Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo in Cameroon, is not just a match but a battle between two of the lowest-ranked nations in the CAF region vying for a spot in the group phase of the qualifiers.

The Road to Redemption

Chad’s Turbulent Journey Chad’s football history, marred by financial issues and governmental interference, has seen them absent from the grand stages of international football. Embarking on this year’s qualification campaign, coach Kevin Nicaise’s team faced setbacks from the outset, with logistical issues hampering their preparation. Despite a five-match losing streak and no competitive wins since October 2019, Chad aims to rewrite their narrative and secure a historic qualification.

Mauritius’ Quest for Glory Mauritius, on the other hand, looks back at their participation in the 1974 AFCON with hopes of emulating and surpassing those achievements. Recent performances, including commendable results against Angola, Kenya, and Pakistan, have built a positive momentum for Les Dodos. The close FIFA ranking between the two sides belies the apparent advantage Mauritius holds, given their recent form and the cohesiveness of their squad.

Tactical Overview and Key Players

Chad’s Local Brigade Financial constraints have limited Chad’s selection to local talents, with Bakhit Djibrine expected to spearhead the attack. The team’s resilience and determination will be crucial as they seek to overcome the odds and secure a victory against their more favoured opponents.

Mauritius’ Balanced Setup Mauritius’ recent draw against Angola and victories over Kenya and Pakistan highlight their strategic approach and tactical discipline. With players like Adrien and Aurelien Francois leading the attack and the experienced Lindsay Rose marshalling the defence, Mauritius boasts a balanced and formidable lineup.
