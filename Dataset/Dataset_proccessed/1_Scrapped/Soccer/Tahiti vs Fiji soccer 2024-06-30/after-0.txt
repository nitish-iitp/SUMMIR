New Zealand wins OFC Nations Cup; brave Vanuatu bows out to the technical superiority of the All Whites

New Zealand secured their sixth OFC Men’s Nations Cup title with a hard-fought 3-0 win over Vanuatu at VFF Freshwater Stadium in Port Vila. In front of a packed stadium, the home side put up a valiant fight against a technically superior and fully professional New Zealand team, earning the admiration and applause of their passionate fans.

Vanuatu, who had lost 4-0 to New Zealand in the group stage, showed remarkable improvement and determination in the final. Making history by reaching their first-ever OFC Men’s Nations Cup final, Vanuatu marked the federation’s 90th anniversary in grand style. Around 10,000 fans filled the Freshwater Stadium, with many more watching from rooftops and cars surrounding the venue, creating a vibrant and electric atmosphere.

The stage was set for an unforgettable match, with New Zealand making a single change to their starting eleven as Sam Sutton replaced the injured Tim Payne. Vanuatu, on the other hand, saw Alex Saniel return to the lineup, replacing the injured Bong Kalo, while Timothy Boulet stepped in for Kerry Iawak.The passionate local supporters had been singing and dancing long before kick-off, but the jubilant mood was dampened just two minutes into the match. Cam Howieson struck a superb volley from the edge of the box, leaving Vanuatu goalkeeper James Iamar with no chance and giving New Zealand an early lead.

Despite the early setback, Vanuatu, under the leadership of captain Brian Kaltak and new head coach Juliano Schmeling, regrouped and began to dominate possession. Encouraged by their fervent fans, who cheered every pass and tackle, Vanuatu showcased their progress and resilience. However, the New Zealand defense stood firm, and goalkeeper Max Crocombe had little to do in the first half apart from a single punching clearance.

Kosta Barbarouses came close to doubling New Zealand’s lead, but Iamar made a strong save to keep Vanuatu in the game. Although New Zealand had been dominant in their previous matches, scoring 12 goals without conceding, they struggled to extend their lead against the determined hosts. Liberato Cacace was a constant threat on the left flank, but his efforts did not translate into more goals.

In an attempt to change the game’s dynamic, coach Schmeling introduced veteran striker Kensi Tangis, whose presence immediately troubled the New Zealand defense and ignited hope among the Vanuatu supporters for a potential upset. The match became a gritty midfield battle on the bumpy pitch, with both teams struggling to create clear-cut chances.Just as Vanuatu was preparing for a final push, disaster struck when Timothy Boulet received a second yellow card, leaving the home side with ten men. Despite this disadvantage, Vanuatu continued to press for an equalizer, driven by their unwavering fans.

However, their hopes were dashed when New Zealand substitute Jesse Randall pounced on a loose ball in the Vanuatu box, scoring his first international goal and effectively securing the title for his team. Max Mata then sealed the victory in stoppage time, finishing off a brilliant build-up play by Player of the Match Liberato Cacace.

New Zealand’s 3-0 victory highlighted their dominance in Oceania football, while Vanuatu’s spirited performance earned them respect and admiration from fans and opponents alike. The final showcased the passion and progress of football in the region, providing a memorable conclusion to the 2024 OFC Men’s Nations Cup.
