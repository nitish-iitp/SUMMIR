Uruguay take on Bolivia this week

The 2024 edition of Copa America is back in action with another set of matches this week as Bolivia take on Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay side in an important encounter at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Thursday. Uruguay have improved over the past year and hold the upper hand going into this game.

Uruguay vs Bolivia Preview

Bolivia are rooted to the bottom of Group C in the Copa America 2024 standings and have made a poor start to their campaign. The Bolivian side slumped to a damaging 2-0 defeat at the hands of the USA last week and will need to bounce back in this match.

Uruguay, on the other hand, are in impressive form and are at the top of their group. La Celeste eased past Panama by a comfortable 3-1 scoreline in their previous game and will look to achieve a similar result this week.

Uruguay vs Bolivia Prediction

Uruguay have shown marked improvement under Marcelo Bielsa and will look to remain at the top of their group. Darwin Nunez has emerged as La Celeste's leading striker this year and will look to add to his goal tally in this fixture.

Bolivia have struggled over the past year and will need to play out of their skins to keep up with their more powerful counterparts in the competition. Uruguay are the better team on paper, however, and should be able to win this game.

Prediction: Uruguay 3-0 Bolivia
