FINAL
Uruguay 5-0 Bolivia

Somehow, Bolivia looked worse than the MetLife Stadium field tonight. Uruguay moved players around and still looked great. Hard to think how the #USMNT can get three points against them.#CopaAmèrica #CopaAmèrica2024 #CA2024

#CopaAmerica everytime I see a goalie attempt a save I see @SeanHayes from Will&Grace. A show I've never watched, but seeing clips-- pretty gay.

The U.S. Soccer Federation is fumbling the most important four years in this country's soccer history. It's insane; big changes need to be made to avoid wasting this golden generation.#USMNT #CopaAmerica
