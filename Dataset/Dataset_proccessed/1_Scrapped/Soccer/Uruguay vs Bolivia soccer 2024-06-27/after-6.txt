TELL ME MORE

Two first-half strikes told the story as Uruguay all but confirmed their spot in the Copa America knockout round with a dominant 5-0 victory over Bolivia. An early goal from Manchester United youngster Facundo Pellistri, a close range header, set the tempo early on.

Darwin Nunez added a second goal in the 21st minute, and that was the strike that dictated the match. Marcelo Bielsa's side controlled every aspect of the match, with the floodgates opening late.

In the 76th minute, Maxi Araujo snuck a goal underneath a rushing Bolivian goalkeeper, making it three - but they weren't done there.

Five minutes later, Real Madrid superstar Federico Valverde notched a fourth, putting the match out of reach for Bolivia. The cherry on top, however, arrived in the 89th minute when Rodrigo Bentancur headed home a sensational cross from Giorgian de Arrascaeta.

DID YOU KNOW?

Uruguay are 15-time Copa America champions. Their last Copa championship came in 2011, when Diego Forlan netted a brace following an 11th-minute opener from none other than Luis Suarez.

THE MVP

Darwin Nunez:

Once again, their big striker shined. With seven straight matches with a goal for Uruguay, Nunez was dominant in the final third for the second-straight Copa America match. With two goals so far, he firmly put his foot in the race for the Golden Boot for Copa America, as he looks to lead La Celeste in their path towards the final.

THE BIG LOSER

Bolivia:

La Verde are on the brink of elimination heading into matchday three. They will need a win against Panama Monday, and a dominant one at that. They will need La Celeste to top the USMNT and they will need to make up their goal differential to best the U.S. for a potential berth in the knockouts.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Uruguay will take on the USMNT Monday to round out the group stage. The U.S. are in must-win territory while Nunez and Co. will look to round out things atop the group.
