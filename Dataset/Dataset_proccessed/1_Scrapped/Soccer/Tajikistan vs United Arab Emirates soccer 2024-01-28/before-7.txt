Hello everyone,

Long time stalker first time posting up. This is my first precision gun of any type. I came across something from a seller and we made a deal. Picked up a very clean REM 700 Sendero 7mm STW . Well I really didn’t think getting ammo or brass for starters would be as hard as it seems in today’s market. I have read several of the posts from others here but wanted to reach out to all the professionals in the community for some guidance moving forward. Frankly I’m not a reloader because I have never had the need. Well that’s changing ASAP it apparent. Is there anyone out here that’s shooting one that’s been reloading or also knows were I can get some factory ammo still? I have found some Nosler off Ammoseek and picked it up so I have some brass to learn to reload with. Any help would be great and thanks again.

This will be a long range Elk and Mule deer gun mostly and maybe a speed goat gun too.

Blue

Easiest button is to have it re- barreled to a more common caliber .
I’m a strong advocate of reloading , but now is a terrible time to dip one’s toes in the water .
And even if you do score everything you need and at decent prices , a quick search for brass showed me the only thing in stock in that flavor is Hornady and at nearly $80 a 50. Or one could form brass - best candidate also from a quick google fu search is to use 8mm Remington Magnum brass . So use unicorn Horns to make hens teeth.
The PRC family looks be getting its legs so brass/ factory ammo would be less of an issue . From one Devil Dog to another. Best of luck on your quest and remember my advice is worth exactly what you’d pay for it .

+1 on re-barreling.
I did find some Nosler 8mmRem brass for $112 (plus shipping) for 25 pieces of brass. That makes for some seriously expensive shooting!
Of course, you also have a huge bolt face (0.54")and either you also replace the bolt or you restrict yourself to those rounds that take that big bolt face. Not a real hindrance...

Our bolt face diameter database helps to determine which new caliber or cartridge will work with the bolt face diameter and action length.

With keeping the current .540 bolt you’d have a hell of a selection of easy turn key solutions- 300- basically in all flavors lots of 7mm’s and up to .375 Weatherby up to .458 win .

Well, the only thing I see for ammo, using ammo seek, is 168 gr bergers, and 140 gr Remington core loks, ( @ 6 to $7 dollars a round ) and it has been that way for a couple of months, so I would be interested in knowing where you picked up some Nosler.

As far as brass goes, all of my usual sources are out of stock, and the one place I found that claimed to have Hornady, reloadingbrass-usa.com, does not have a location nor a contact number, and will only take Zelle, Cashapp, or Crypto. I am thinking that is a scam site.

As Aftermath has pointed out, the only way I saw as well was to get 8mm brass and neck down, which is not hard to do if you have any reloading equipment.

I guess I always considered mine to be a hunting rifle, it is accurate, but not in the precision rifle class.

Maybe in the future it might make come back, but I kind of doubt it.

Funny you say the PRC lineup. One of my more local gun smiths said the same thing.His advice was 7PRC as it’s more available and cost less to shoot. I miss spoke on the ammo I think that was Gunbroker I found the factory Nosler Ammo (6 Boxes) but I have been on Ammoseek and almost every other place for that matter. I did find a large batch of 8mm REM Mag (Parent Case) brass somewhat local but even at 4.00 a pop for brass it’s spendy for sure. Im really torn on a direction in all honesty but it’s still a nice rifle for sure and I hate to see it go the way of the dodo. I appreciate all the insite and I’ll be honest I didn’t even consider the blot in the equation of everything. Thank you all for some in-site and guidance.

I will agree with you now that you made that point on the hunting rifle.

I’m thinking that’s why I had someone suggest taking Weatherby 6.5-300 case and necking it up. Never thought about that way. Still expensive for sure. Also the .375 I was looking into also for brass.

The 7mm STW is a heck of a cartridge. Seen its power on large hogs beyond 200yds. Serious thunder right there. I believe I used to reload it for a buddy that had one. Will check my notes.... i believe the Lyman manual has loads as well. Will post if so, what bullet weight are you considering?

The only reloading note I have for 7 STW is From 2009 btw. I may have final accurate note in log books...

160gr Nosler Accubond, seated to 3.73 COAL, Nosler brass, load development started with 73.0gr of IMR 7828.

7stw is such an awesome classic round! i'd do whatever you can to keep it.

that said, 7prc is a pretty good round with not horrible cartridge availability now.

Not sure how dropping $700-800+ on a re-barrel is the "easy" answer.

Handloading is wonderfull, but this would be jumping in the deeper end of the pool for learning.

100 CASES = $400
Dies, press, scale, etc.....momoney
Just leave out the primers, powder and bullets and still...

Yeah.

Re-barrel is the "easy" answer.

Yeah I don’t want to even tell you what I have gave for the factory loads I have dug up already just to get brass for reloading. I have a line on a few more boxes of Nosler 160’s but they are not cheap. I think I have a good 300 rounds of factory ammo right now. I still feel like that’s just a good start and I want to find brass to reload and it looks like 8mm REM Mag will be the most available right now.

If I reload I’ll reload some heavy just to see how it likes the heavy Bergers. I think I seen some 190 or 195 bergers at the last gun show. I would hunt with 160 or 175’s at least. I just don’t like my game to turn into fast food and run off.

Don't get me wrong. I am very set up to reload and have been doing it for decades so I would probably just get stuff as I find it and keep that old rifle as a 7STW. Just for the heck of it. I have LOTS of other options to shoot with so that one would just be another and unique.
However, since you have never reloaded and do not have all the gear, it will prove expensive to get it all set up. There is a lot to it and it gets more expensive the more you get into it and search for perfection. You can be well above $1000 in a hurry and that is not buying the outlandishly priced stuff. And I am not even including the brass, primers, powder and bullets. Of course, once you have all the measuring tools and the basics (like a press), a new caliber is not much more than a new set of appropriate dies.
I am not trying to discourage that either. IF, big IF, you want to get into reloading. It's the way to go, as far as I am concerned, to gain the most from your shooting rig and especially for the more obscure cartridges.
I'd say that 300 rounds to reload with are PLENTY for that hunting rifle.
But...there are other chamberings that are more readily available as factory ready to shoot off the shelf ammo. Barrels are not exactly readily available right now either but you can get a blank for around $400 if you shop the want ads and another $400 or less to have it fitted to your action in the chambering you want.

Been shooting that same exact rifle and caliber for over 22 years... I might can give some insight.

This is the ONLY in-stock decent ammo available according to Ammoseek...

Get as much as you can, shoot it, and then reload the brass.

For dies, I recommend a good quality set of Redding dies and shell holder.

For reloading, I'd jump up to the Berger 175 Elite Hunter bullets, backed by Winchester StaBall HD powder, or H1000, and some CCI 250 primers.

This would be his best bet, and it's a simple 1 pull trip through the 7mm STW FL sizing die, and he has ready to roll STW brass.

If you have 300 rounds of factory ammo you’ve got enough there to kill 20% to 25% of the realistic barrel life for a brand new unfired example. Take that fired 300 rounds of brass and re-load them 3-4 times which is realistically no problem, and that barrel will be pretty much done.

Just get dies and roll your own, by the time you are close to wearing out the brass it will be time for a new barrel too. Decide on a re-barrel then.

For clarity at current component prices if you load each piece of brass 4 times after initial firing and can keep costs down to at or just under $2/round you will have sent $2,400 worth of ammo down the tube, not counting what you paid to lay in the original 300 rounds.

That means a lot ! Thank you very much. I’ll keep you posted on this endeavor. I’m hoping my father in law will be willing to part with all his reloading gear and send it home with me so it will actually be used! So I guess I’ll have to buy rifles in his calibers lol. He was a huge 270WBY man and 300 WBY. He killed alot of deer with them over 40 years of hunting all over. I can’t tell you how much shit he has. Walls full of stuff.

Just came across this somewhat dated thread. Pardon the dust, but I did not think it necessary to start a new thread...

Like Blue, came across an estate sale deal, and had no idea what I got myself into. God bless the guy who use to have this Rem700 mag-face rifle as he kept it immaculate (detailed guy or did not get to shoot it much as I ran Patch-Out through it when I got it and it came out clean). Supposedly made by a custom shop in Texas (https://egaguns.com/) by the markings on the 28" M24 barrel that is a 1 in 8.5 twist of unknown brand origin and unknown number of rounds down through it (thinking most likely a hunting rig, but it came on an old school thumbhole AICS chassis; note to self, get a bore scope). Thinking about calling them to find out the freebore on this build to mitigate pressures if I am conservative with my loadings. It would be nice for things to last more than a few firings with annealing extending the brass life...

Like Blue, I did not want to back away from what history has dubbed an incredible round with a short barrel life...I now know who beat me on gunbroker. Quickly found out it was a rabbit hole, but one I was willing to take the red pill from Morpheus, er, Layne Simpson, to see how deep it would go....and yes, I know, he and others here, like @FuhQ with his 22 years (man that made me breathe a sigh of relief), were ever offering was the truth....nothing more...




The factory Nosler 300 rounds Blue bought/acquired/has is easily close to $1500 when each 20 round box of Nosler old new stock of factory 7mm STW 140s/160s go for $130 average a box. Unless I am wrong, Nosler brass is made by Norma for their factory rounds; hence, why, like Blue, I went the factory round for brass even though @FuhQ showed a Hornady variant link which still works as of this post's date for $160/box (not for me, nope).

Believe it or not, Sportsman Warehouse (https://www.sportsmans.com/search/?text=7mm+stw) still has some actual old stock in some of their stores and DoubleTap (https://doubletapammo.com/collections/7mm-stw) still makes this round seasonally, although I am not sure what brass they use (emails to them never get answered on this query). If anyone knows, please chime in. Lately I am a Norma whore like Blue and will only go with the best brass I can get my hands on that will most likely outlive the barrel. Glad there are people here who know way more about this 1979 round creation / 1989 debut than all the reading I could get my hands on from Layne Simpson of Shooting Times (who I am amazed still writes articles for them). Some links below the veterans most likely will know back of their hand, but good reference for the newbies to keep this hotrod going:

7mm STW
7mm STW & 180 gr Bergers
I am just finishing my STW build and am planning on shooting the 180 gr Bergers. Is anyone else using this combo? I am having a hard time finding much load info for it. Thanks

What's the best way to deliver 180 gr Berger's?
Sometimes when you get the right question you find the answer you're looking for. Hopefully this is one of those times. The 180 gr Berger in 7mm seems to be really outstanding, and I see more and more people on the Hide shooting it for real. I have been looking at this for some time as the...
 www.snipershide.com

Makes me wonder what the nick is for / if Mr. Simpson is on the Hide or some other forum (assuming no as he is a gun writer who makes his living not giving away his advice for free).

@RUN8 above said about 25% of factory life for 300 rounds. Link below says "barrel life for the 7mm STW is between 600 and 900 rounds depending on methods of use and cleaning procedures. With good throat polishing procedures and low volume shooting it is possible to push barrel life beyond 1000 rounds. The STW represents the absolute maximum velocities obtainable from the 7mm bore."

Source: https://www.ballisticstudies.com/Knowledgebase/7mm+Shooting+Times+Westerner.html#:~:text=Barrel life for the STW,obtainable from the 7mm bore.

In any case, I am all in, doing the accuracy reloading with 0.310 sizing for a 0.001 neck tension on factory Nosler brass with loaded 0.311 necks with Berger 180gr hybrids using Retumbo (starting low at 70 grains and working up to 80 or so). Goal is long range steel banging with sufficient cooling times in between. Barrel gets changed when its time, not worried about it; like a tire, change it when you have to. Lots of decently priced factory 7mm barrel pulls with no rounds down them on the Hide Exchange, eBay, etc. MODBB from Bartlein I do not think is worth the money or the time given the short barrel life; rather, just will go with off the shelf pulls on the relative cheap. Figured good to have one hot rod in the stable that has an excellent pedigree and not as bad of a kick as I thought it would have. Then again, it is braked well (spiral radial brake flush fit on M24 profile barrel) and I only shoot it when no one is within 10 feet of me.

The idea of an ackley improved version with a 40 degree reamer piqued my interest not for the increase in powder capacity (Retumbo already leaves like 10-15% space in the case for the Berger 180 hybrid), but because I only fired factory brass once and I am at max length needing to trim before next reload; want to slow the flow. I find multiple sources quoting trim-to-length of 2.830" to 2.850" with most saying 2.840". I would rather trim down to 2.830" and give myself a few cycles more before having to trim again, but I do not know if 20 thou is really too much to take off the neck. Chamber seems to be cut so brass headspaces off the shoulder and not the belt, so I seek others more experienced than I to guide me on this point.

Is it worth on the next re-barrel to ask Dave Kiff of PTG to make a 40 degree variant (Manson and JGS take way longer to make even though I know more people go with them than PTG; but PTG is months faster)? Sounds crazy I know, but the round is not hard to load for and the amount of research done by many before me makes me want to continue to press the easy button for this all-around do-everything rig; barrel-life be damned. Should I consider an AI variant (https://pacifictoolandgauge.com/sea...rway=desc&search_query=7mm+stw&submit_search=) and ask John Whidden to make the Ackley improved dies for it?

My rationale lies in what Cal Zant, in his PRS Blog article about the 2018 Q Creek Extended Long Range PRS match, revealed that "there are many high-BC 7mm bullets to choose from, which would 'cheat the wind' like the 215gr Hybrid does. I asked the match director, Scott Satterlee, about the cartridges that have led in the past, and he said while he is also running a 300 Norma Mag personally, he suspects that we may see a trend down towards the 7 magnums for these types of matches."

It was me lol. Guilty as charged on that Nosler lot of ammo and also at Sportsman’s too. I had a buddy from the Corps go to the location and buy it all up. I have sources about 200 rounds and 500 pieces of brass total I think. I’m going to work the loads up this winter at a private range outside Sacramento area. I smoked a bobcat with it at 643 yards so far and he was DRT. Dead right there. I’m still looking at a more modern hunting rifle still but I have been having fun hunting a gathering for this STW. I have 10lbs of RL25 for it and some H1000 and a bit of RL22 too. We will see what she likes.

Try some Winchester StaBall HD powder, as well. Easy to find, and nice and slow for the big case. Should get you a really nice case fill with the heavies. I haven't worked it up yet in mine, but have an 8 lbs. jug sitting around for when I get bored.

Easiest button is to have it re- barreled to a more common caliber .
I’m a strong advocate of reloading , but now is a terrible time to dip one’s toes in the water .
And even if you do score everything you need and at decent prices , a quick search for brass showed me the only thing in stock in that flavor is Hornady and at nearly $80 a 50. Or one could form brass - best candidate also from a quick google fu search is to use 8mm Remington Magnum brass . So use unicorn Horns to make hens teeth.
The PRC family looks be getting its legs so brass/ factory ammo would be less of an issue . From one Devil Dog to another. Best of luck on your quest and remember my advice is worth exactly what you’d pay for it .

Appreciate it man. I think I’ll buy a 7PRC just to have also but I’m still not giving up on this classic killer. I’m deep into to it and at this point F it lol. I just picked up 409 round of brass and that will be my stock pile of brass I load plus what I have. I’ll burn the barrel out by the time I through that and then I’ll think about what to do next. I’ll probably send it to Randy up in WY and let him play with it after it’s lived its life hunting stuff. I’m thinking I’ll sit on the porch and drop deer with it on the property mostly if I’m being honest and also anything when I’m at work in CA since they don’t like any of my other pew pews in this state.

Just came across this somewhat dated thread. Pardon the dust, but I did not think it necessary to start a new thread...

Like Blue, came across an estate sale deal, and had no idea what I got myself into. God bless the guy who use to have this Rem700 mag-face rifle as he kept it immaculate (detailed guy or did not get to shoot it much as I ran Patch-Out through it when I got it and it came out clean). Supposedly made by a custom shop in Texas (https://egaguns.com/) by the markings on the 28" M24 barrel that is a 1 in 8.5 twist of unknown brand origin and unknown number of rounds down through it (thinking most likely a hunting rig, but it came on an old school thumbhole AICS chassis; note to self, get a bore scope). Thinking about calling them to find out the freebore on this build to mitigate pressures if I am conservative with my loadings. It would be nice for things to last more than a few firings with annealing extending the brass life...

Like Blue, I did not want to back away from what history has dubbed an incredible round with a short barrel life...I now know who beat me on gunbroker. Quickly found out it was a rabbit hole, but one I was willing to take the red pill from Morpheus, er, Layne Simpson, to see how deep it would go....and yes, I know, he and others here, like @FuhQ with his 22 years (man that made me breathe a sigh of relief), were ever offering was the truth....nothing more...




The factory Nosler 300 rounds Blue bought/acquired/has is easily close to $1500 when each 20 round box of Nosler old new stock of factory 7mm STW 140s/160s go for $130 average a box. Unless I am wrong, Nosler brass is made by Norma for their factory rounds; hence, why, like Blue, I went the factory round for brass even though @FuhQ showed a Hornady variant link which still works as of this post's date for $160/box (not for me, nope).

Believe it or not, Sportsman Warehouse (https://www.sportsmans.com/search/?text=7mm+stw) still has some actual old stock in some of their stores and DoubleTap (https://doubletapammo.com/collections/7mm-stw) still makes this round seasonally, although I am not sure what brass they use (emails to them never get answered on this query). If anyone knows, please chime in. Lately I am a Norma whore like Blue and will only go with the best brass I can get my hands on that will most likely outlive the barrel. Glad there are people here who know way more about this 1979 round creation / 1989 debut than all the reading I could get my hands on from Layne Simpson of Shooting Times (who I am amazed still writes articles for them). Some links below the veterans most likely will know back of their hand, but good reference for the newbies to keep this hotrod going:

The Double Tap ammo is using that Australian brass or at least in the 5/6 boxes I have anyhow is all the kangaroo brass. I was told they will not be shipping any more to the US for now. I’m not sure how that’s going to play out but time will tell I guess.

HOLY Daddy Warbucks, Batman! $12/round BEFORE shipping!

I do not have an STW but I do shoot a 280 Ackley a whole bunch and I really like 140 gr Berger VLD Hunt out of it. I'm getting 3250 fps at the muzzle!!

I have a crapload of brass and a large stockpile of bullets, primers and powder. Thank goodness because I think I'm about $3/round.
