WHY IS AUSTRALIA PLAYING?

Australia has been participating in the 2024 Asian Cup as a member of the Asian Football Confederation since June 2005. This decision was made due to the lack of clear direction in the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) for the Socceroos, as well as the absence of a full World Cup quota allocated to the OFC.
Australia's official debut as a member of the Asian Confederation came in February 2006, when they participated in the qualifiers for the 2007 Asian Cup. Since then, Australia has been an integral part of Asian soccer, participating in competitions and contributing to the development of the sport in the region.

THE CHAMPIONS

Japan holds the record as the most successful team with 4 titles (1992, 2000, 2004 and 2011) in the Asian Cup. They are followed by Saudi Arabia (1984, 1988 and 1996) and Iran (1968, 1972 and 1976) with 3 titles each. South Korea has achieved glory on 2 occasions (1956 and 1960). Meanwhile, Israel (1964), Kuwait (1980), Iraq (2007), Australia (2015) and Qatar (2019) have one title each in their competition history.

THE NO. 1 CONTENDER

Japan is positioned as the top favorite. Since their elimination in the round of 16 at the World Cup against Croatia on penalties, they have suffered only one defeat and have accumulated eight consecutive victories, including a resounding 4-1 win over Germany. Beyond their excellent results, the team has shown remarkable play and impressive offensive power, scoring a total of 40 goals in 10 games during 2023.

WHAT IS THE FORMAT LIKE?

It is comparable to the format of the European Championship. The initial phase will involve 24 teams in six groups of four. The top two finishers from each group, along with the four best runners-up, will advance to the round of 16, after which elimination will be straightforward.

About the Stadium:

The Ahmad bin Ali Stadium is located in Rayan, Qatar, and serves as the home venue for the Al Rayyan team of the Qatar Football League. This sports venue has hosted major events such as the 2006 Asian Games, the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, the FIFA Club World Cup in 20202 and the FIFA Arab Cup in 2021. In addition, the stadium was one of the main venues during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, hosting six group stage matches and one match in the round of 16. To prepare for this major event, a complete renovation of the stadium was carried out. In May 2015, the original stadium was completely demolished, and reconstruction work was carried out until November 2020, ensuring modern facilities suitable for hosting high-level sporting events.

One of the favorites to win the Cup

On the other hand, UAE comes in as one of the favorites to qualify for the next round of the Asia Cup 2024, after finishing the group stage as group runners-up with 1 win, 1 draw and a surprise loss to Iran, The UAE team will have to prove that the second place they got was due to punctual mistakes and not because they are not up to the level as they bring one of the best valued squads of the tournament, however, the weak point is the defense as out of 5 goals scored, they allowed 4, so in this game, the key to seek victory should be to have a wall at the back that allows them to go on the attack with confidence.

To impose themselves

The national team of Tajikistan comes to this game with the obligation to impose conditions to get the ticket to the quarterfinals of the Asia Cup 2024, after a good performance in the group stage where they were able to get a victory, a draw and a loss to qualify as second place in Group A only behind Qatar who finished the first phase undefeated, the team showed they have the sporting weapons to defend themselves on the field and think about going far in the tournament, so the UAE team will have to be careful because an oversight could end in a Tajikistan goal.

The Asian Cup of Nations is here

The new edition of the Asian Nations Cup is back with the best actions, emotions, controversies, plays, goals, players and matches of one of the biggest continents in the world where soccer has grown by leaps and bounds. Little by little, the continent's nations began to export several players to the world's top leagues and the project bore fruit as they gathered their best players to worthily represent the colors of their flag on the pitch in the quest for Asia's eternal glory. In this round of 16 match between Tajikistan and UAE, both teams will be able to test the level they will face in the next match and the level they will have to be at to be able to face a great challenge such as this tournament, likewise, in these 90 minutes they will have to be forceful as there is no margin for error to think about recovering.
