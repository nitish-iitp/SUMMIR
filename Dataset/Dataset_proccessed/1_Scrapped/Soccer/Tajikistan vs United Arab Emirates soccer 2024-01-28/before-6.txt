Setting up a rimfire for “long range” (200 yard) shooting. Looking for a cheap scope with 10 or more mag on the upper end. Would like something with turrets and zero stop so I can practice dialing. Pretty limited on price though.

Should be in the $200 range. Just putting something together for fun, not going to compete with it so there’s no sense breaking the bank. Will dope and plink for fun while the barrels are cooling on my centerfire guns, that’s about it.

Looking at the swfa fixed mag scopes, but wondering if there’s something with more features and less bombproof. Don’t need it to be tested for 50bmg recoil!

I would see what you can find in the PX section. So really good deals can be found. I don;t think you find anything in the $200 range with a zero stop. I know it's double your $200 but I icked up a Vortex Venom 5-25X56 34mm tube for $400 shipped here in the PX section.
Good luck!

You are asking way too much for $200. You need to at least double that and look in the PX.

I’d save up, and look at Arken. I like mine and they seem to punch above their weight.

Arken is the only Optics Company that was too busy to return a call or talk when you call. No thanks too many other optics companies that want you sell you a scope and back it up.

Took a look around optics planet. Looks like if I go up to $300 there are lots of options with lower-end athelon, vortex and a handful of other chineasium brands. All with turrets and such. Would never put any of them on a serous rifle, but looks like good stuff for a non-competition plinker. Might keep an eye on the PX for a bit to see if any pop up cheap.

I have 2 Muellers on my 457s. They are 8.5-25 x 44, I got them from MidWay a few years ago. Darn nice scopes, granted they are made in chinksville but what isn't.

So you want to look through a potato and have turrets that kinda do something?

Better raise your budget.

You'll have to really raise it if you want to look through glass that isn't cloudy.

Do you not think the strike eagle at midwayusa for $300 is a good deal? I have never looked through one.

Aside from the PX, check out CameraLand NY, B&H Photo, and others. On the zero stop, is it a make/break feature? That's more for higher priced ones.

If you're looking for say a first focal plane, with a tree reticle, parallax adjustment down to 10/15, if you can up it to say $300, plenty of basic options. Just check out the gear list for NRL22/PRS for production/base class and see the scopes used there.

Only vortex I would own is a razor.

I'm one of the lucky ones that got to warranty at least 1 of every single Chinese vortex I bought. So I don't have them anymore.


I'm also not really a fan of their glass and coatings. They have a ton of contrast that makes the image look super sharp. However, it gives me horrible eye fatigue and just doesn't make for a pleasant experience.



I find it odd that if you put this question in rimfire you get weird answers, yet if you posted in optics you'd get guys telling you to quit being poor 

I may not be the best to follow, as I have a $2k scope on my $1500 rimfire. It replaced what I thought was a cheap placeholder that was only $750.

I don't have any rimfires without a ffp mil scope with a tree reticle, other than one dedicated to the 50' indoor range. (And that one still wears a $700 sightron 6-24 for 50').

Yes, which is why my first response is either increase the budget or get used to trying to look through a potato with no features.

To each their own. I have pretty high standards for the weapons I hunt with. Less so for a little Rimfire me n my kids will use to knock over soda cans. Fun to have something that dials so we can maybe hit said can rather far away, but not thousands of dollars fun. Kids drop stuff..

a potato sounds like a pretty good idea. If it doesn’t work as a scope, you can throw it down range and shoot it! Let me know where you get your optical-quality spuds 

I found a guy with a used diamondback. Under my max budget, so I have some $ left for ammo now. Good times!

Late to the thread, but was going to reply that I have both a Venom and Diamondback. While the Venom is better, for the budget stated, the Diamondback is a really good and less expensive replacement. I find that the DB parallax focus is NOT as marked, but I can adjust to get a clear picture regardless of what the dial says.

I should add that I admit, I have not shot the DB out past 100 yards. The Venom had been shot to 250ish on plates.

And the DB is mounted on a Savage, the Venom on a Bergara B14R.

If you look at Frank's list of scopes from his classes, you will see one that failed tracking, and it was a Vortex Diamondback. How do I know this I took the class and it was mine!

It was VERY early in this journey and I didn't know any better. I stopped at Vortex on the way home from the class, got a new one and sold it as a new scope. Good riddance!!!

I used a Athlon Talos 4-16 on a varmint rifle for years without any problems. I paid $159 back 3-4 years ago so probably can be had for $200 these days.

Talos 4-16×40 Mildot Low Light Rifle Scope | Athlon Optics
The Talos low light rifle scope with Advanced multi-coated lenses foffers clarity and brightness in low light, add precious minutes to every hunting day
 athlonoptics.com

A year ago I sold it to a friend for $150 and upgraded to a Heras 4-20 for the same rifle it was on. He's still using it on his 22rf. It has 10Y focus so we often shoot that gun on 10M Olympic airgun targets offhand.
The Talos is unique because it's SFP, mils correct on 10x, and capped 5 mil turrets with .1 clicks. I got it to see the reticle on 4x for small game and yotes. 10x is good for holds and having a wide FOV, 16x for dialing at max magnification. Only 19oz.

It is obviously a cheaper scope, and the one I have is on a Savage I use as a play around gun. For a budget of $200, it's not a bad choice.

Check out Armstrong Precision Rimfire on Amazon. Looks like it will check most of the boxes for you. They are second focal plane but do have a mil dot reticle and mil turrets. 4-16x44, parallax down to 15yards and within your budget.
$159 on the ol Amazon. Looks like a decent option for a VERY budget option

I was going to recommend the same one. I saw a recommendation on YouTube and thought I'd try it on my RAR. I sighted it in earlier this week and for the price, it's not a bad scope. The included rings and caps only up the value.

Tried out the $150 diamondback on my savage B22 today. It’s been sitting in the safe for awhile, but finally took it out to the range.

Seems to be working for me. Here’s 10 rounds at 50 yards. 3/4MOA, if my math’s correct.

A similar post on another thread after a single call that didn't work out. You don't own an Arken so how do you know they will not have your back? Personally, I don't own an Arken scope so I don't have an opinion either way. However, I wouldn't shut the door on a company over one attempted contact. I contacted Bergara USA by phone and email several times and guess what? They never answered my calls or returned my emails. They are a company with a solid reputation, but they lost my business when I purchased from a different company. I would still reach out to Bergara again in the future. Companies prefer live chat or email because everyone is trying to cut expenses and Arken and maybe Bergara is no different.

velocidad247 I hear what you are saying BUT when every other optics company they compete with has people you can talk to why would I buy from them. If you have an issue what then Email after Email no thanks. If they are that short of people and can't afford to have a rep to speak with then maybe the are not far for going out of business I don't know?? Custom service is the life blood of small companies. If they had taken 5 min to answer 2 simple questions I was going to buy 2 of their 5-25x56 scope but they didn't and lost the sale. This was good for Vortex as I ended up getting a Venom 5-25X56. I own many different scope brands and Arken is one I will NEVER own. Just how I see things.​

I'd recommend the Athlon Argos Gen 2 BTR 6-24x. Great scope with affordable price with lifetime warranty.
I'm looking at trying NRL22 for the first time. The budget/factory class has a $1300 combined MSRP limit for rifle & scope. Arken scopes have a lot of features at a great price point. Granted the 2025 NRL22 for base/factory class will have a $1500 combined MRSP limit which increases the options until companies raise their prices.

Customer service is important and I'm not knocking your complaint. Like I said, I was disappointed with Bergara's customer service. May I suggest going through a middleman? Camera Land Inc. has the same sales listed on Arken's website, plus Camera Land will ship for free! Any problems with the scope, return it to Camera Land, you pay for shipping, and they will send you another scope! Camera Land works with Arken while you don't. I called Camera Land and I'm satisfied with their assistance over the phone. I didn't purchase anything, but Camera Land will be the source if I get an Arken scope.

Arken is a Chinese company. They have front men here handling the shipping and complaints. But they have pushed other companies to get cheaper and better optics. They are a good lower end optic that performs better than some big name scopes.

Camera Land is great have used them before. You may wish to deal with Arken but I will never deal with them to many other options. Like I said if you have an issues good luck getting resolved where as Vortex, Athlon and others have great customer service. Those of you that have Arken I hope you never run into issues.

I'd shy from arken but Doug or whoever it was that ran cameralandNY years back was real pleasant, 10/10 would recommend.
I recently snagged a vortex venom 5-25x56 and it's real nice for the money. impressively so even. I just can't stomach the cheap scopes anymore. once you've re-zero'd a tangent theta there's no going back unfortunately. even the razors are easy to zero and real dang nice. after I come to terms with my mistake I'll likely list it in the px for 399$ shipped fwiw.

Arken is the only Optics Company that was too busy to return a call or talk when you call. No thanks too many other optics companies that want you sell you a scope and back it up.
I have had nothing but good results from Arken but I never called. I emailed them. The main thing is I have 4 of them and never had a problem that wasnt my fault and they remedied it anyway. Every email I have sent them with problems or product questions was answered in one to two days. As far as OP, I bought a $200 Leupold Freedom scope that I liked for squirrels but for range shooting you are going to have to upgrade. I have 4 Arken EPL4's, 1 Vortex Diamond back, 2 Athlon Ares ETR's. Of those 3, bang for the buck is Arken. I like the Athlon's most but twice the price or more. I prefer MIL to MOA but that is me. Buy once cry once.
