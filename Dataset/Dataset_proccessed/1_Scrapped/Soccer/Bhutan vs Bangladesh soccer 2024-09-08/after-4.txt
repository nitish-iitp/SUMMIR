Bangladesh suffer defeat to Bhutan in last minute goal

From the start of the match, both teams played with attacks and counterattacks. However, no team goat the desire goal in the first half due to the determination of the goalkeepers of the two teams and the poor finishing. In the second half, Bangladesh increased attacks but Javier Cabrera's side lost 1-0 to Bhutan in the last-minute goal.

The game starts at 6 pm Bangladesh time on Sunday at the Changlimithang Stadium in Thimpur. Two changes have been made to the visiting team's starting XI. It was reported earlier that forward Rakib Hossain was ruled out due to an ankle injury. Shahriar Emon replaced him while Isa Faisal was in for Vishwanath Ghosh.

Like the first match, coach Javier Cabrera did not keep regular captain Jamal Bhuiyan in the starting eleven. He arranged the team in a 4-3-3 formation. Midfielder Sohail Rana wears the captain's armband.

Although there were several opportunities to score, the hosts could not capitalize on them as the red and green representatives managed the defence and attacked several times. Goal opportunities were also created. Bangladesh kept the net intact in the first half due to the determination of goalkeeper Mitul Marma.

In the second half, Bhutan's attack increased. Most of the time the visiting team has to be busy defending. The footballers of Bangladesh entered the opponent's defence several times but could not utilise the opportunity.

At the end of the scheduled time, a match that was heading for a draw suddenly saw a goal. In the first minute of added time, substitute Kinga Wangchuck netted the ball from D box with a right-footed kick from a team-mate's cross. Bangladesh left the field with a disappointing 1-0 loss.   

Before this, Bangladesh won by 1-0 goal against the hosts in the first game of the series on September 5. After more than 10 months, the red-green team won an international match through that win. The two-match series ended 1-1 draw.
