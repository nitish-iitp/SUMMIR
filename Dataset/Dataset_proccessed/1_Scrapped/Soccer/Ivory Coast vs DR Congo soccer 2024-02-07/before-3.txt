Bafana Bafana had to rely on the stunning heroics of keeper Ronwen Williams to get past Cape Verde in Saturday’s Afcon quarter-final, with the 32-year-old once again underlining his status as one of the most talented shot stoppers.

Williams produced four historic penalty saves in the shootout to lead Bafana to the final four of the Afcon tournament, a position very few thought they would be in before the tournament started.

Interestingly, his father Rodney has shared an interesting anecdote about his son, suggesting he was a striker first and foremost, and that he could still add value in this role.

“Ronwen was at about the age of seven when he joined Shatterprufe Rovers [amateur club in Gqeberha], but not as a goalkeeper, as a striker. He started as a striker, and that is what many people don’t know,” Rodney told the truBreakfast team.

“I wish that one day he will get a chance to play in-field, then South Africa will see the different side of Ronwen – I can guarantee you, he’s a striker.”

Williams also credited team analyst Sinesipho Mali for providing him with plenty of key information ahead of the penalty shoot out.

“I don’t think anything can top this unless we go on and win it,” he added.

“I’m over the moon, I’m ecstatic. But once again, it’s not me, it’s the team. You know the analyst, he studied the penalties, they sent me so many penalties.

“Credit to the analyst as well.”
