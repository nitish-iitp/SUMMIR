Multi Contaminant Removal Through Ion Exchange Resins

JUN 10, 2016 / BALA CYNWYD, PA

Purolite ion exchange resins for multi-contaminant removal drastically reduce contaminants found in residential, commercial and industrial drinking water. Unlike traditional multi-tank systems that require a large footprint and are expensive to operate, Purolite resins work together in layered-bed, single-tank designs that can remove multiple contaminants at once. This approach not only saves on system footprint, but also reduces the costs associated with water consumption, regeneration chemicals and wastewater disposal. 

What to do When Ion Exchange Resins Become Fouled?

JUN 4, 2016 / BALA CYNWYD, PA

Suspended solids and other contaminants can wreak havoc on IEX system performance. Regular cleaning can prevent accumulation of solids and extend resin life. Ensuring proper regenerant quantity and proactively following step-by-step procedures for tackling fouling by bacteria, algae, iron, manganese, organics and oil can help get your system back to operating efficiently. Taking time to learn about procedures for cleaning fouled or contaminated resins can lead to better system performance.
