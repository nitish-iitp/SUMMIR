Lebanon are unbeaten in their last two games (PC: Getty Images)

Lebanon and Tajikistan lock horns at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday for the 2024 Merdeka Tournament. With hosts Malaysia and the Philippines being the only other participating teams, this is the first of the two semi-finals.

Playing for the first time since their disappointing World Cup qualifier campaign, Lebanon are looking to pick themselves up here with a fresh start. In their last official clash, the Middle Eastern side crushed Bangladesh 4-0, powered by a hat-trick from Hassan Ali Maatouk.

However, it wasn't enough to seal their progress into the next round of the qualifiers, as Lebanon's World Cup dream was crushed once again. Nonetheless, it demonstrated their frightening attacking ability on their day.

Head coach Miodrag Radulović has called up 24 players for the Merdeka Tournament in Malaysia, including the sole uncapped player Mohammad Safwan. Veteran midfielder Mohamad Haidar will captain the squad.

On the other hand, Tajikistan are looking to make a fresh start too following their own poor qualifier campaign that also ended in the second round. The Crowns won only twice in six games to finish behind Jordan and Saudi Arabia in Group G, but they still managed to reach the next round of the Asian Cup qualifiers.
