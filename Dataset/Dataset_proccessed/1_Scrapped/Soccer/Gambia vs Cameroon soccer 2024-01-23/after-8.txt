Cameroon boss Rigobert Song has benched Andre Onana for his side's must-win clash with The Gambia in the African Cup of Nations.

Onana not selected
Man Utd star seemingly out of favour
Fabrice Ondoa plays instead
WHAT HAPPENED?

Cameroon currently sit third in Group C with one point and must win to have any hope of finishing in the top two spots. However, their destiny is not entirely in their own hands, as they must also hope Guinea, in second, lose to Senegal.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Onana has flown directly from Manchester to the AFCON, with the club even chartering a private jet to whisk him to the competition, but he was absent from the first game of the tournament, and was left fuming despite arriving in time to play. Cameroon drew that game 1-1 with Guinea, and were then beaten 3-1 by Senegal in their second game, with Onana, having been restored to the team, making a dismal error in the defeat.

DID YOU KNOW?

Onana is an experienced campaigner with 37 caps to his name. His replacement for Tuesday's game, Fabrice Ondoa has 49 caps, but plays his football in the French third-tier with Nimes Olympique, and is actually Onana's cousin.

WHAT NEXT FOR ONANA?

His omission is likely to be a severe blow to the goalkeeper's confidence. He has struggled internationally and domestically, making a catalogue of mistakes during his time with United under Erik ten Hag.
