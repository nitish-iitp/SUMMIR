Gambia vs Cameroon LIVE!

Cameroon won a remarkable five-goal thriller against Gambia to reach the Africa Cup of Nations knockout stage. A lacklustre, goalless first half led to a remarkable second, which saw Cameroon take the lead three times in between Gambia's first two goals in their history against the Indomitable Lions.

Gambia thought they had equalised again in the 94th minute, only for the goal to be disallowed by handball. Cameroon finished ahead of Guinea in Group C on goals scored while Gambia were eliminated after a third successive loss.

The Indomitable Lions had to claw their way back in a game of relentless attack and end-to-end action to keep alive their hopes after falling 2-1 behind with only five minutes left. Cameroon will now face Nigeria in the last-16 in Abidjan on Saturday, where Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana will be hoping to be reinstated after being dropped by Rigobert Song for today's game.
