Preview: Mozambique vs. Ghana - prediction, team news, lineups

Group B at the Africa Cup of Nations will draw to a close this week, and Ghana will be looking to keep their qualification hopes alive when they face Mozambique at Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara on Monday night.

Ghana are staring down a second consecutive AFCON group-stage exit, currently in third place in the group and level on one point with their opponents in this match, who are at the bottom of the group standings.

Mozambique have had to wait 12 years to return to the AFCON, having failed to qualify for the last six editions, and the requirements for them to remain in the competition are exactly the same as their opponents in this match.

However, history is certainly not on the Mambas' side since they have never won a group-stage match in an AFCON, losing 12 and drawing two of their 14 matches over five tournaments, including this one.

In addition, Mozambique have never kept a clean sheet in the premier continental competition, conceding 31 goals to date and allowing two or more goals in 13 of their 14 AFCON matches.

Failure to keep a clean sheet on Monday will see the Mambas draw level with Zimbabwe as the sides that have gone the longest period of time (15 games) without keeping a single clean sheet in this competition.

Chiquinho Conde's side did come agonisingly close to breaking their AFCON duck, though, when they faced Egypt in their opening match and came from behind to take a 2-1 lead but were heartbroken when a penalty was given against them deep in stoppage time, which Mohamed Salah stuck away to save The Pharaoh's blushes.

Unfortunately, the Mambas were unable to follow up on that performance in match two against Cape Verde, as individual mistakes in defence led to them being comfortably beaten 3-0 and on the verge of elimination.

Ghana were sent crashing out of the tournament two years ago when they finished bottom of their group, and they will end at the foot of Group B this year if they lose this crunch match.

The Black Stars got their tournament underway in the worst way possible as they found themselves outplayed by group leaders Cape Verde and slumped to a 3-0 defeat, putting them under immense pressure early on.

Matchday two against Egypt brought out a better performance from Chris Hughton's side, who went into the match as the underdogs, but despite taking the lead twice, they were unable to hang on and had to settle for a share of the spoils.

That result marked Ghana's sixth consecutive AFCON match without a win, which is their longest-ever winless run during their over six-decade history in this competition.

A win over Mozambique here will still not be enough to see the Black Stars claim an automatic qualification spot if Egypt beat Cape Verde in the other match, but four points will almost certainly be good enough to finish as one of the best third-placed teams.

Lau King and Domingues were brought on at the interval during Mozambique's loss to Cape Verde, and the pair will be vying for places in the starting lineup in the upcoming game against Ghana.

Conde also altered his side's formation in their last match, deploying Atletico Madrid's Reinildo in a back three, and it will be interesting to see if they continue with that on Monday.

Mohammed Kudus missed Ghana's opening match against Cape Verde due to injury, but the West Ham United midfielder marked his arrival at the tournament with a stunning opener against Egypt before bagging a second goal midway through the second half.

The Black Stars have no injury concerns at the moment and could turn to veteran Andre Ayew to provide extra strength in attack after the Le Havre attacker remained as an unused substitute in the last match.


Mozambique possible starting lineup:
Ernani; Mandava, Dove, Mexer, Macandza; Guima, Amade, Witi, Bauque; Gildo, Ratifio

Ghana possible starting lineup:
Ofori; Odoi, Djiku, Salisu, Mensah, Ashimeru; Paintsil, Konigsdorffer; Ayew, Kudus, Williams



We say: Mozambique 1-2 Ghana

Ghana would have got some much-needed confidence from their performance against Egypt last week and the return of Kudus has given them a genuine attacking threat at the top end of the pitch. Mozambique will certainly not back down here, but we are backing the Black Stars to get the victory they need in this one.
