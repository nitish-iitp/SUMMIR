Preview: Suriname vs. Costa Rica - prediction, team news, lineups

Suriname can move into a top-two position in Group A of the CONCACAF Nations League when they host Costa Rica on Friday at Dr Ir Franklin Essed Stadium.

Natio dropped down to third in the group with a 1-0 defeat at Guadeloupe on matchday two, putting them a point behind Los Ticos, who collected a 0-0 draw in Guatemala.

A lengthy unbeaten run of six matches in all competitions came to an end for Suriname last month, as they failed to find the back of the net for the first time since a 1-0 defeat to Cuba at this tournament over a year ago.

It was the first loss for Stanley Menzo as head coach, with the former Ajax goalkeeper guiding them to three successive victories by a combined margin of 11-2 before that.

Suriname are in danger of losing successive games in normal time on Friday for the first time in over two years when they followed up a 3-1 Nations League defeat versus Jamaica in 2022 with a 3-0 loss to Mexico a few days later.

In their last three Nations League home fixtures, Suriname have avoided defeat each time, collecting a 4-0 triumph over Grenada in their previous match played at Dr Ir Franklin Essed Stadium.

Not since March 2023 have they suffered a defeat in Suriname, losing 2-0 versus Mexico on matchday five of that Nations League campaign.

Their previous triumph against a Central American opponent came in September 2022, when they defeated Nicaragua 2-1 in a friendly.

Two matches into Claudio Vivas' tenure as interim Costa Rican coach, it is difficult to know what this team's identity will be going forward.

Following a convincing 3-0 victory over Guadeloupe in his opening match at the helm, Costa Rica were suffocated by the Guatemalan's defensive approach the last time out but were compact on the back end themselves.

Since a 3-0 defeat versus Colombia at the Copa America this past summer, Los Ticos are unbeaten in three successive competitive fixtures while losing just one of their last eight matches.

The Costa Ricans have won just one of their last four Nations League affairs away from home, coming from behind to claim a 2-1 triumph versus Martinique in March 2023.

Los Ticos have won their only three matches played this year against Caribbean teams, failing to concede a single goal in any of those games.

Friday will be the sixth time they face Suriname on the international stage, with the Costa Ricans winning each of those previous meetings, including the last one, which took place in the United States at the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup (2-1).

There were four newcomers in the Suriname starting 11 against Guadeloupe as Warner Hahn replaced Etienne Vaessen in goal, with Liam van Gelderen, Ridgeciano Haps and Jaden Montnor coming in for Anfernee Dijksteel, Stefano Denswil and Gyrano Kerk.

Jayden Turfkruier, Silvinho Esajas and Jonathan Fonkel are all seeking their first caps with the national team, while Gleofilo Vlijter can become the nation's all-time leading goalscorer, currently even with Stefano Rijssel on 14.

In their 0-0 draw with Guatemala, the Costa Ricans brought in Gerald Taylor, Sebastian Acuna, Manfred Ugalde and Warren Madrigal to replace Haxzel Quiros, Alejandro Bran, Alonso Martinez and Josimar Alcocer.

Rashir Parkins is the only player selected for this window still seeking his first senior cap for Los Ticos, after Acuna picked up his first on matchday two, while their third-most capped player all-time, Joel Campbell, can surpass Celso Borges and Juan Ulloa for fifth in all-time goals, seeking his 28th strike on Friday.

Suriname possible starting lineup:
Hahn; Van Gelderen, Abena, Pinas, Haps; Pherai, Van der Kust; Jubitana, Kerk, Paal; Vlijter

Costa Rica possible starting lineup:
Sequeira; Mitchell, Vargas, Calvo; Aguilera, Bran, Brenes, Lassiter; Madrigal, Martinez, Campbell



We say: Suriname 0-1 Costa Rica

One of the main constants with the Costa Ricans, regardless of who is in charge, has been their solid defensive structure, and we believe they will narrowly defeat an improved Suriname side, who have played a little more aggressively under Menzo and tend to leave themselves exposed to a counter.
