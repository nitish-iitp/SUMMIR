AFCON 2023: Namibia and Mali make it through to Round of 16
By:

January 24, 2024

Namibia and Mali secured their places in the Round of 16 at the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals after playing out a hard-fought 0-0 draw at the Stade Laurent Pokou.

This historic day marked a significant achievement for the Brave Warriors, progressing from the group stages for the first time in their AFCON history.

Namibia entered the match with the momentum of their inaugural AFCON finals win, aiming to build on that success against a formidable Mali side unbeaten in their last 10 international matches.

In the early stages, Mali controlled possession, but it was Namibia who threatened first. Prins Tjiueza’s attempt to slot a shot into the far-bottom corner was expertly denied by Mali’s goalkeeper Djigui Diarra, tipping the ball onto the post.

As the game progressed, Mali began to assert themselves, testing Namibia’s goalkeeper Lloyd Junior Kazapua with a powerful shot from Nene Dorgeles. Lassine Sinayoko also came close with a header that narrowly missed the left post.

The second half proved scrappy, with both teams struggling to create clear-cut chances. The best opportunity fell to Kamory Doumbia, breaking past the defense and attempting to square the ball to Ibrahim Sissoko, but the cross eluded the striker.

In the final 10 minutes, Mali intensified their efforts, with Amadou Dante’s free-kick from distance forcing a crucial save from Kazapua. Despite the late pressure, Namibia held on to secure a valuable draw, securing their passage to the AFCON knockout stages.

Mali, finishing at the top of the group with an unbeaten record, also advanced to the Round of 16.
