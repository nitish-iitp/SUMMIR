VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B2Gold Corp. (TSX: BTO, NYSE AMERICAN: BTG, NSX: B2G) (“B2Gold” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce its gold production and gold revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, its gold production and cost guidance for 2024, preliminary 2025 production outlook, and a gold prepayment arrangement. All dollar figures are in United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. Canadian dollars are converted to United States dollars at an exchange rate of 1.35 to 1.


2023 Highlights

Strong quarterly total gold production in Q4 2023: Higher than anticipated total gold production in the fourth quarter of 2023 of 288,665 ounces, including 18,054 ounces of attributable production from Calibre Mining Corp. (“Calibre”).


Achieved upper half of 2023 annual gold production guidance: Total gold production for 2023 was 1,061,060 ounces (including 68,717 ounces of attributable production from Calibre), achieving the upper half of 2023 guidance and marking the Company’s eighth consecutive year of meeting or exceeding annual production guidance.


Strong quarterly gold revenue to finish 2023: Consolidated gold revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $512 million on sales of 256,921 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,993 per gold ounce. For the full year 2023, consolidated gold revenue was $1,934 million on sales of 994,060 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,946 per gold ounce.


Re-affirm full year 2023 total consolidated cost guidance: Total consolidated cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the year (including attributable results for Calibre) are still expected to be slightly below the guidance range of $670 and $730 per ounce and total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the year (including attributable results for Calibre) are still forecast to be at the low end of the guidance range of between $1,195 and $1,255 per ounce.


Achieved significant safety milestone of 5 years without a Lost Time Injury at Masbate: On November 17, 2023, the Masbate Mine, located in the Philippines, achieved a major safety milestone, exceeding 32 million hours, 1,826 days, worked without a Lost Time Injury. B2Gold has a longstanding commitment to continuous safety improvement at all of its sites, and its goal of sending everyone home safe at each of its operations and projects.

2024 Guidance and 2025 Preliminary Outlook Highlights

Total gold production is anticipated to be 860,000 to 940,000 ounces in 2024: Total gold production guidance for 2024 of 860,000 to 940,000 ounces, including 40,000 to 50,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre. The expected decrease in gold production relative to 2023 is predominantly due to lower production at the Fekola Complex as a result of the delay in receiving an exploitation license for Fekola Regional from the Government of Mali, delaying the 80,000 to 100,000 ounces that were scheduled in the life of mine plan to be trucked to the Fekola mill and processed in 2024. The contribution of this gold production from Fekola Regional is now assumed to start at the beginning of 2025.
