We said: Liechtenstein 2-1 Hong Kong
This may just be a friendly, but Liechtenstein will throw everything into trying to end their four-year run without a win. Although Hong Kong will be the far more confident side heading into this fixture, we are backing the home team to get over the line with a hard-fought triumph. Read more.
