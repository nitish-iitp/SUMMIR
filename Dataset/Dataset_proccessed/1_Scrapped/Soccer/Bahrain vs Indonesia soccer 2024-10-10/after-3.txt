Hoping for fairer matches, RI coach after Bahrain controversy

Jakarta (ANTARA) - National football team coach Shin Tae-yong said he is hoping for fairer match management in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers following the team's recent controversial draw against Bahrain. "I hope that future matches, regardless of the opponent, will be fair and reasonable," he said at a press conference before Indonesia's match against China. An audio recording of the press statement was received in Jakarta on Monday.

The World Cup qualifier match between Indonesia and Bahrain on October 10, 2024, sparked much controversy.

Indonesia was leading 2-1 until the final moments of stoppage time, when Omani referee Ahmed Al-Kaf extended the match beyond the initially indicated six minutes of extra time.

Al-Kaf's decision ignited widespread anger among Indonesian fans as Bahrain scored an equalizer in the additional time.

Many fans accused the referee of deliberately prolonging the match to benefit Bahrain and questioned his impartiality.

The Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) sent a letter of complaint to FIFA, protesting what it described as an error by referee Al Kaf.

At the press conference on Monday, Coach Shin once again alluded to the Indonesian team's recent 2-2 draw against Bahrain.

He said he believed that Team Indonesia should have secured a victory in Bahrain, but refrained from discussing the match in detail.

He attributed the team's loss to a lack of focus and emphasized that the issue had been thoroughly evaluated so it would not recur when the team plays against China.

"We have carefully analyzed and reflected on this, and I have also had in-depth discussions with the players," he said.

In their fourth match of the third round of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, the Indonesian team will take on the Chinese team at the Qingdao Youth Football Stadium, Qingdao, Shandong, China, at 7 p.m. Western Indonesian Time (UTC+7) on October 15.

Tom Haye and his teammates are currently ranked fifth in Group C with three points, while China has yet to accumulate any points.

Japan is leading the group standings with nine points, followed by Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, each with four points.
