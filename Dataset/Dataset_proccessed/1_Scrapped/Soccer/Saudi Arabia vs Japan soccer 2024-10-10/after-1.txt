Daichi Kamada and K. Ogawa scored a goal in each half to give Japan a 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia in the 3rd round of the Asian qualifiers played at King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Jeddah on Thursday.

With this win Japan lead Group C with a maximum 9 points, while Saudi Arabia are in second place with 4 points.

The Samurai Blue will take on Australia next week at home. Tony Popovic’s reign as coach got off to a winning start as his boys came from behind to beat China 3-1 earlier in the day and resurrect their World Cup qualifying campaign.

The Aussies now have 4 points, while China on the other hand were consigned to their third straight qualifying defeat.

Bahrain are in fourth position with 3 points, followed by Indonesia on 2 points.

The top two teams from each of the three groups will qualify directly for the 2026 World Cup, while the teams who finish third and fourth will advance to the fourth round of qualification.

Earlier, Japan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia IWAI Fumio posted a video on X where he expressed his excitement for tonight’s match.

He said: “I am honestly not sure who to support. Do I support my country Japan or the country close to my heart, Saudi Arabia? I will support both. The most important is our spirit.”

Iwai added that next year will be the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Japan. He said he hoped the two nations would cooperate further and strengthen their relations on all fronts.
