No fewer than 21 players from the first eam and the Academy will join their national teams during the month of October. A busy schedule awaits them, including the Nations League and qualifiers.

The Performance Centre will be quite empty during this October international break. As is the case during every break, many Monegasques will indeed join their respective national teams. After 19 players in September, this time 21 players have been callled to represent their countries.

Two returns and a first

And among them are three newcomers: Philipp Köhn, Vanderson and Kassoum Ouattara. The goalkeeper, who had not been present with Switzerland since the 2022 World Cup, will thus participate in the rest of the Nations League with Breel Embolo.

For his part, the Brazilian full-back, selected for the last time in September 2023 (two caps) will play in the qualifiers for the next World Cup with Brazil. On the other hand, it will be a big first for his counterpart on the left flank, who will discover the French U-21 team, after having already been in U18, U19 and U20.

Qualifiers in focus

The Golden Boy Web nominee has indeed been called up  will be reunited with his club teammate, Maghnes Akliouche, for the end of the qualifiers for the U-21 Euros, aualifiers that also will involve Eliot Matazo with Belgium.

Still on this subject, Wilfried Singo (Côte d’Ivoire), Lamine Camara (Senegal), Mohammed Salisu (Ghana) and Eliesse Ben Seghir (Morocco) will participate in the qualifiers for the next AFCON, as will Takumi Minamino with Japan, with a view to the 2026 World Cup.

Friendly and reunions for the youngsters of La Diagonale

The youngest call-ups  will all play friendly matches. This is the case for example of the U19s of Joan Tincres and Aladji Bamba who will participate in three matches that will serve as preparation for the Euro 2025 qualifiers, scheduled for next month. Finally, the French U20 team of Mawissa, Benama Michal and Bouabré will play against the Morocco U20 of… Yanis Benchaouch —  a reunion between players from La Diagonale.
