Aiming to keep their impressive winning run intact since the Asian Cup, Japan will travel to Saudi Arabia for an AFC World Cup qualifier on Thursday night at the King Abdullah Sports City, Jeddah.

The Green Falcons are unbeaten in Group C of the third round following a productive September schedule, whilst Samurai Blue are boasting a perfect record in the section.

After guiding Italy to continental success at Euro 2020 during a five-year spell in charge of the European powerhouses, former Inter Milan and Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is now at the helm of Saudi Arabia, who have commenced the third round of World Cup qualifying in positive fashion.

A less-than-ideal share of the spoils with Group C minnows Indonesia was not the greatest result for the Green Falcons during the opening round of fixtures, but they were soon to secure their first win of the section five days later, beating China 2-1 in Dalian.

Saudi Arabia managed victory despite Al-Hilal midfielder Mohamed Kanno receiving a straight red card within the opening 19 minutes, with goals either side of the half-time break from centre-back Hasan Kadesh - who had never previously scored on the international scene - sealing maximum points for the visitors.

Collecting a respectable tally of four points from their opening two third-round fixtures, the Green Falcons are currently occupying second position in the Group C standings, two points behind flawless leaders Japan and a single point ahead of third-placed Bahrain.

Bidding to make football's grandest stage for a third time running, Saudi Arabia have serious recent pedigree in the World Cup, beating eventual champions Argentina during a group-stage match in November 2022, when Salem Al-Dawsari and Saleh Al-Shehri netted the most memorable goals of their careers.

Alongside from Group A pacesetters Uzbekistan and Iran, Japan are one of three nations in the third round of AFC World Cup qualifying to still have their 100% record intact after the first two rounds of fixtures, with Thursday's visitors making lightwork of both China and Bahrain in September.

After former Liverpool attacker Takumi Minamino starred in the 7-0 drubbing of China on September 5, Samurai Blue were at their ruthless best once again just five days later, battering Bahrain 5-0 courtesy of goals from Ayase Ueda, Hidemasa Morita and substitute Koki Ogawa.

Earning a maximum of six points from their opening pair of third-round contests - scoring 12 goals in the process - Japan are deserved leaders at the head of a six-team Group C, with the top two in the section automatically booking a spot at the 2026 World Cup in North America.

Guiding Samurai Blue out of a 2022 World Cup group containing Germany, Spain and Costa Rica, Samurai Blue manager Hajime Moriyasu has credit in the bank in charge of his country, with the 56-year-old looking for his 60th win as head coach during his 85th game on Thursday night.

Japan will be striving for a repeat of their most recent meeting with Saudi Arabia in February 2022, when goals from Monaco man Minamino and Reims winger Junya Ito secured a two-goal success over the Green Falcons during the final stages of qualification for the 2022 World Cup.

After seeing red during the early stages of the win over China last month, Saudi Arabia's Kanno will be unable to feature in Jeddah on Thursday night.

As a result, Abdulelah Al Malki will require a new partner in the Green Falcons' engine room, with Musab Al-Juwayr representing a likely candidate for the role.

Despite netting an own goal in September versus China, Ali Lajami should retain his spot in the hosts' back three alongside Kadesh and Hassan Tambakti.

Enduring a difficult start to life in the Premier League with Crystal Palace, Daichi Kamada will be looking for some relief on the international stage with Japan this month.

Scoring a brilliant brace during the thumping of Bahrain, Sporting Lisbon star Morita should continue in midfield, partnering Liverpool's Wataru Endo.


Saudi Arabia possible starting lineup:
Al Owais; Tambakti, Lajami, Kadesh; Abdulhamid, Al-Juwayr, Al Malki, Al Dawsari; Al Hamddan, Al-Dawsari, Al-Buraikan

Japan possible starting lineup:
Suzuki; Itakura, Taniguchi, Machida; Doan, Endo, Morita, Mitoma; Minamino, Kamada, Ueda



We say: Saudi Arabia 0-1 Japan

With two wins apiece from their last four meetings, we are expecting a close battle between Saudi Arabia and Japan in Jeddah on Thursday night.

That being said, Samurai Blue's winning run since their Asian Cup disappointment is hard to ignore, so we are backing the visitors for three points in this one.
