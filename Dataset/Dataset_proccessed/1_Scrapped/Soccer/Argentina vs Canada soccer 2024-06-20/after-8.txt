Marsch calls for Argentina fine for second-half delay

After the match, Jesse Marsch spoke about Argentina's significant delay in returning to the field for the start of the second half: "When they were waiting, I knew that they were looking at video and they were analyzing how they wanted to play against us. Now, I wish again, the referees would manage that. If we were five minutes late, we'd get a fine. There'd be a big problem.

"Let's see what happens with Argentina. I think they have to be fined. How late were they? You guys? 20 minutes? 30? I don't know. It was a long time. But they had that time to prepare how they wanted to play against us in the second half, which if we would have known ahead of time that we could have an extra 10 minutes then we could have prepared some things more. But in the end, I just made sure that the players knew that they were going to come out with a new plan and they basically rotated a little bit more to three, but we still dealt with it."

Marsch then joked with reporters in the press conference: "Argentina should be fined. OK? Fined. Write that. Olé. La Nacion," Marsch said, a wide grin on his face. "They should be fined for coming out 20 minutes late for the second half."

'Fearless performance from Canada'

Getty Images

Canada supporters have been praising the performance of their team on our discussion page.

Artem K.: I don't think I remember a more fearless performance from Canada. It's fun to watch, but a lot of work for our goalie who has been on fire today.

Dom M.: Canada really coming on strong. A very good showing by Canada considering they are facing the world’s number one team. Canada should be proud of this effort no matter the outcome.

Simar: Shaffelburg really impressed me, plays with no fear, takes people on, it's exactly what we need but the whole team is missing the finishing needed to win these types of games. Lots of positives but we neeeeed our first goal under Marsch soon.

Simar makes a good point, as Canada have been outscored 6-0 in their three games under Marsch so far...

Hello this is Lionel, how may I assist you?

Lionel Messi's first career assist at the Copa America came in 2011. Since then, he has racked up 17 total assists in the competition while no other player has registered more than five!

His Argentina teammate Angel Di Maria and Alexis Sanchez are the two players to record five Copa America assists in that time.

Messi calls match tough, physical and complicated

Speaking after full time, Lionel Messi spoke about his side's performance: "We knew it was going to be a tough match, very physical. In the first half there was little space. Luckily we found the goal quickly in the second half, but even so it was complicated.

"We have the patience to have the ball, to move it from one side to the other. Most opponents play differently against us, we have to keep control."

Canada created plenty of chances

Classic Argentina, kind of. Lionel Scaloni’s side have now won six of their seven competitive games since lifting the World Cup: 1-0, 3-0, 1-0, 2-0, 1-0 and 2-0 – but this was far from a total defensive shutout.

Canada had their moments, Jonathan David and Stephen Eustaquio both squandering headed opportunities from close range, while their total of nine shots on goal are the most that Argentina have faced in 15 games.

The defending champions will take the result, and the debutants will probably take the performance.

Davies gets Messi's shirt

The FS1 broadcast shows Alphonso Davies was the lucky player to swap shirts with Messi after the match. Neither team captain will be thrilled with their individual performance on the night, but at least they’ll have a memento of their night together in Atlanta.

Cornelius booked

90+4' Argentina 2-0 Canada

Cornelius takes out Messi with a late sliding tackle and is the latest player to be shown a yellow card.

Why Messi is still in this match after suffering that injury scare is anybody's guess.

Julian vs Lautaro

90' Argentina 2-0 Canada

Lautaro Martinez was a surprise omission from today’s lineup, with Julian Alvarez the preferred man up top. The two strikers are now this tournament’s first pair of goalscorers — suppose we’ve got a position battle on our hands for the next few games!
