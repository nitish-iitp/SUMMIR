A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections.

Argentina 2-0 Canada: summary, score, goals, highlights | Copa América 2024

As it happened: Argentina - Canada

Argentina kick-start their Copa America defence with a 2-0 victory over Canada. 

The holders created plenty of first half chances, particular an early one-on-one for Angel Di Maria, but they were all squandered. Canada, too, fashioned some openings but failed to find the back of the net. 

The breakthrough came early in the second half when Julian Alvarez pounced on a loose ball in the box and fired home. Both teams had opportunities to score but none were taken, until substitute Lautaro Martinez latched onto a Lionel Messi through-ball in the final minutes and doubled Argentina's advantage. 

Three takeaways

- Lionel Messi doesn't look match-sharp 

- Canada will cause teams problems in this tournament

- Argentina will pack stadiums wherever they go

Argentina get the win against Canada

It wasn't easy, but Argentina managed to get the job done against an impressive Canadian team. Both sides created plenty of chances but we had to wait until the second half for the first goal of the game, a consequence of some wasteful finishing. 

Lionel Scaloni will demand improve from his team but Argentina have started the tournament with a win, and that's all that matter right now.

Well, Canada fans. That wasn't so bad, was it?

A spirited performance form Jesse Marsch's men in the first half saw them fashion two or three very presentable chances, one of which they really should have scored. They've looked resolute at the back and goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau has already made some sharp saves.

Davies provides the spark!

It's that man again, burning around the outside on the left and sending a teasing low cross into the box. This time Larin tries a clever flick at the front post but it's blocked.

More promising play from Alphonso Davies.

Big chance Canada!

Blistering pace from Davies sends him free down the left wing. He gets to the byline and pulls a ball back to Larin, who can't quite reach it. 

The loose ball falls to Buchanan but his spin-shot is dragged wide. 

A good chance for Canada, and a showcase of Davies' talents.

Big chance Argentina!

Messi whips the ball out to Acuna on the left of the box, drawing Crepeau out from his goal. The Canadian keeper misjudged it terribly and watches on as Acuna plays a low ball across the empty goal. 

Fortunately for Canada, there is no one there to convert.

Will this be Lionel Messi's final tournament?

Argentina captain Lionel Messi will undoubtedly be one of the players to watch this summer, in what could well be his last ever international competition. The Inter Miami star is the reigning Ballon d’Or winner but, as he prepares to turn 37 next month, is no longer the player that he once was.

In a recent interview Messi admitted that he is unsure if he will be able to feature in the 2026 World Cup, admitting that it will depend on his fitness coming into that summer. He has been able to ration his gametime since moving to MLS last summer but he was played well over 1,000 professional games already.

This could well be Lionel Messi’s ‘Last Dance’ with this talented generation of Argentinian players.

He's won it all, but Lionel Messi will be desperate to add another international triumph with the Argentina national team. Messi already boasts a very impressive record in this tournament. During his six previous Copa Americas Lionel Messi has scored 13 goals, enough to league him just four away from Brazil’s Zizinho and Leo’s compatriot Norberto Méndez at the top of the all-time rankings.

Few would bet against him breaking the scoring record this tournament and he is already on the cusp of another piece of history. He is level with Chile’s Sergio Livingstone at the top of the appearance chart, with 34 each. As soon as Messi takes to the field on Thursday, he will be out on his own as the record-holder.

Jesse Marsh takes charge of talented Canada team

Nearly a year had passed since Canada parted ways with former head coach John Herdman last August. The team had drifted slightly, without a full-time head coach in charge, but last month they unveiled former RB Leipzig and Leeds United boss Jesse Marsh as their ‘MLS Canada Men’s National Team Head Coach’.

Yep, that’s right. Due to a rather desperate call for funding to Canada’s three MLS clubs the national team head coach will bear the name of the United States’ soccer league. It’s not ideal, but they have at least managed to secure the services of a leader with real prestige to lead this talented generation.

"We are talking about things that have already passed. [Winning the World Cup and the Copa America] was very nice but it's over… Football matches are all different, there are no easier games than others. A lot of things can happen. The difficulty of France, Brazil or Canada can be the same."

Lionel Scaloni, Argentina head coach

"It will be a difficult Copa America as always, we are prepared for what is to come. We are doing well, with clear ideas and knowing the difficulty of this tournament."

Lionel Scaloni's incredible Argentina career

Lionel Scaloni had precious little coaching experience when, in the dark days of 2018, he was named interim head coach of the Argentina national team. After being derided by Argentina legend Diego Maradona as “unqualified”, Scaloni led the team to a barely acceptable third-place in the 2019 Copa America, before his tenure really got going to years later.

His team clinched the 2021 Copa America, beating Brazil in the final and bringing Argentina’s first international trophy in 28 years. They went on to lift the World Cup 18 months later, but Scaloni knows that all that success is now in the past.

This is the first time that Canada have competed in Copa America, traditionally a South American-only tournament, and it's fair to say that they have a tough ask from the start. 

They take on the reigning world champions, Argentina, but there's plenty of reason to think that they could cause some problems. They have Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, two incredibly talented attackers with impressive records in European soccer. 

They boast a new head coach, former RB Leipzig boss Jesse Marsch, and will undoubtedly benefit from his elite-level experience and high-octane style of play. Marsch only took over the job last month so has had little time to impart his ideas but he has plenty of talent to work with.

Argentina go in search of a third consecutive international title

It's difficult to think know, but the proud sporting nation of Argentina once went 28 years without winning a major trophy in soccer. The nation's main sport - it's obsession - had brought so much joy for so many years but that winning sensation deserted Argentinians until surprisingly recently. 

Under rookie head coach Lionel Scaloni Argentina finally ended their drought in 2021 with the Copa America. It was the first major trophy for Lionel Messi in an Argentina jersey and the team has certainly developed a taste for the high life. 

In 2022 Messi led his team to the World Cup, securing a thrilling penalty shoot-out victory over France in the final. Messi was named the tournament's best player two years ago but, now aged 36, knows that this summer's Copa America could be his final international tournament.
