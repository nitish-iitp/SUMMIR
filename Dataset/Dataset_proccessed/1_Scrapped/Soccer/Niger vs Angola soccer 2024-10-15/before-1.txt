Niger and Angola return to action in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they go head to head at the Stade Larbi Zaouli in the second of their Group F double-header on Tuesday.

Zaki Badou's side set out in search of their first win of the campaign while the Black Sable Antelopes head into the game on a run of seven straight wins across all competitions and will be looking to keep the juggernaut rolling.

Niger were condemned to their second defeat in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers as they were beaten 2-0 by Angola when the two sides squared off at the Estadio 11 de Novembro on Friday.

While Angola dominated proceedings and saw over 60% of the ball possession, they needed a 75th-minute penalty from Mabululu to break the deadlock before substitute Milson gave them breathing space with an 85th-minute strike.

Sandwiched between the two defeats, Niger played out a draw with Ghana on September 9, when Oumar Sako netted in the 81st minute to cancel out Alidu Seidu's first-half opener and force a share of the spoils in Berkane.

Badou's men have now gone five straight matches without a win across all competitions, losing four and picking up one draw since with a 2-1 victory over Zambia in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, where they currently sit third in Group E with three points from four matches.

While Niger will look to find their feet on Tuesday, they will need to show their mettle against an opposing side who have won each of the last three meetings between the two nations, scoring seven goals and conceding twice since June 2008.

With Friday's result, Angola have now maintained their 100% record in the race for a place in Morocco as they edge closer to securing back-to-back AFCON appearances, following their quarter-final finish in Ivory Coast.

Pedro Goncalves's side had secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Ghana in their Group F curtain-raiser on September 5 thanks to a 93rd-minute strike from Milson four days before seeing off Sudan 2-1 at the Estadio 11 de Novembro.

Angola head into Tuesday's clash on a run of seven consecutive victories across all competitions, including a 5-0 hammering of Namibia in the 2024 COSAFA Cup final, and have gone 11 straight games without defeat since losing 1-0 against Morocco in a friendly tie on March 22.

This blistering run of results has been owing to the impressive display in attack, where the Black Sable Antelopes have netted 20 goals since their defeat against Morocco in March while they have kept six clean sheets in that time.

Former Rio Ave striker Gelson Dala, who has netted 20 goals since his debut in June 2015, started off the bench on Friday and could be handed a starting role at the Stade Larbi Zaouli.

Should that be the case, the 26-year-old should team up with veteran forward Mabululu and Cagliari's Zito Luvumbo in the final third, while Fredy and Show should retain their roles in midfield.

At the defensive end of the pitch, we expect a back three of Kialonda Gaspar, Bastos and Olympiacos man David Carmo shielding 30-year-old Neblu between the sticks.

Badou made just three substitutions all in the second half in Friday's reverse leg and we expect the 65-year-old to name an unchanged XI here, with Boubacar Hainikoye and FC Kryvbas man Daniel Sosah leading the attack.

Mohamed Abdouramane and 21-year-old Philippe Boueye should form the centre-back pairing while Ousseni Badamassi, Ousmane Diabate, Youssouf Oumarou and Najeeb Yakubu should start in the centre of the park.


Niger possible starting lineup:
Neblu; Gaspar, Bastos, Carmo; Modesto, Fredy, Show, Cruz; Mabululu, Luvumbo, Dala

Angola possible starting lineup:
A Hainikoye; Alhassane, Abdouramane, Boueye, Badamassi, Ousmane Diabate, Youssouf Oumarou and Najeeb Yakubu; Sosah, B Hainikoye


We say: Niger 0-1 Angola

While Niger will be looking to stop the rot and get their quest for a ticket to Morocco back on track, they are in for a tough 90 minutes against Angola who are currently firing on all cylinders. Goncalves's men have put together a fine run of results this year and we fancy them to extend their dominance over Niger.
