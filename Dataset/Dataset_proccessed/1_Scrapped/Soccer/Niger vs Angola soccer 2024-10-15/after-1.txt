Angolans jubilate after scoring a goal against opponents

Ghana’s Group F opponents Angola have booked their qualification to the 2025 African Cup of Nations after recording their fourth consecutive win in the qualifiers over Niger on Tuesday, October 15, 2024.

The Palancas Negras won 1-0 in Morocco, with their striker Zini scoring the only goal after just 48 seconds of action.

The goal scorer picked up a long pass from his teammate inside the Nigerian half and rounded the goalkeeper, Abiboulaye Hainikoye, before squaring it into the net.

The victory extended Angola’s lead at the top of Group F to 12 points, automatically handing them a ticket to next year’s AFCON, which will be hosted in Morocco.

Coach Pedro Goncalves’s side’s qualification comes after beating Ghana 1-0 in their first match and going on to defeat Sudan in their second match.

Ghana’s hopes of reaching the 2025 AFCON have hit a snag after losing 2-0 to Sudan. The Black Stars are without a win after four matches, having recorded two draws and two defeats.

The four-time AFCON champions will have to win their remaining matches with the hope that Sudan doesn’t pick up a point in their final two matches.
