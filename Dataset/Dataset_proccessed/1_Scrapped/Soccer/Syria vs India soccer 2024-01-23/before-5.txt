Three goals from the opponents before the interval condemned India to their second successive loss of the AFC Asian Cup 2023 and left their knockout stage qualification hopes dangling by a thread. In their previous four attempts, India had never marched past the group stage, but their displays four years ago in the United Arab Emirates had provided the Indian football faithful with a glimmer of hope that this might be the year they break their barren streak.

Two losses in two games have left a significant dent in those hopes - but, as it happens, India are still very much alive in the competition. However, they can no longer finish in one of the top two spots after being left adrift mathematically.

Four years ago, when the Asian Cup expanded to include 24 teams instead of 16, it added a round to the knockout stage - round-of-16 - and provided four extra progression slots for the competing teams to occupy. As such, the four best third-placed teams were to join the six group winners and runners-up, completing a 16-strong roster for the next round. Thanks to Syria's first two results, that law may still apply to India, provided the results go their way in round three of matches. Here are how the scenarios are shaping up: 

Scenario 1 - India Lose To Syria: The outcome in this instance will be painfully simple; India will exit the tournament ranked bottom of their group without a point to their name.

Scenario 2 - India Draw With Syria: While the result would, in theory, be better than a loss, it would be of no use to India. They will still finish fourth in their group - since Syria are a point better off the Blue Tigers - but with a point to their name.

Scenario 3 - India Beat Syria: Here's where things get interesting. Should Igor Stimac's men beat Syria, they will leapfrog them in the table and secure the third spot. India currently have a goal difference of negative five (-5), which makes progression far more complicated than it would seem. As such, not only will they need to beat Syria, they must do so by a good margin. For context, in the previous edition, Vietnam qualified as the fourth-best third-placed team for the knockouts with three points and a goal difference of negative one (-1).
