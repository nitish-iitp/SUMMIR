Indian Football Team Would Love To But...: Igor Stimac On Possible India vs Argentina Friendly Match in Kerala
A possible India vs Argentina football match in Kerala can generate a lot of excitement but several challenges need to be addressed before Kerala can officially host Argentina. However, the Kerala government has assured fans that they are working to overcome obstacles. If Kerala's bid to host Argentina is successful, it would be a momentous occasion for the state and India.

After Kerala Sports Minister V Abdurahiman claimed that the Argentina national football team had confirmed its intent to play in Kerala, India head coach Igor Stimac responded to a query on the possibility of such an opportunity for the national side and said, "I would love to see Kerala government investing into licensing the actual football stadium there for a FIFA World Cup qualifying game so we can come there and enjoy together a national team game.
"We have lots of passion about coming to Kerala with the national team and playing official games, but that is not possible until licensed ground by FIFA," he added while speaking on the sidelines of the India vs Syria pre-match press conference.
Stimac's comments come against the backdrop of the sports minister saying, "We have received mail from Argentina FA confirming their interest to play in Kerala," Abdurahiman announced on social media. "We are thinking about which month to play as July is rainy season in Kerala. We will have a face-to-face meeting to decide the dates."
This development marks a significant moment for Kerala, a state known for its passionate football fans and vibrant sporting culture. The mere prospect of Lionel Messi and his star-studded teammates gracing the lush green fields of Kerala has sent the local football community into a frenzy.
Al Bayt Stadium awaits to witness India's last-ditch effort against Syria
It's a do-or-die situation for the Blue Tigers as they get ready to take the field against Syria in their last game of Group B at the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023.
India currently stands at the bottom of Group B, having lost their first two matches against Australia (0-2) and Uzbekistan (0-3). Syria, who had earned a stalemate against Uzbekistan in their first game, currently have the advantage in the race to the third spot in the group. The four best third-placed teams from six groups and the top two teams from each group will make it to the round of 16.
The equation is simple for the Blue Tigers – they must get three points against Syria to secure the third spot and hope for the results in the other groups to go in their favour.
“We will try to keep playing our football,” said India head coach Igor Stimac on the eve of the game. “We have worked on changes in mindset and our philosophy. Defeats are a part of the process, but our strength needs to be to bounce back from it.
India are set to face Syria at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor at 5 pm IST on Tuesday, January 23, 2024.
