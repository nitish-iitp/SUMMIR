Hello and welcome to the India vs Syria, AFC Asian Cup 2023, Live Blog. 

India's start to the AFC Asian Cup campaign has been less than desired. Having succumbed to successive losses against Australia and Uzbekistan, the Blue Tigers are now facing the prospect of elimination. Nothing short of a big win would stave off the spectre of an early knockout, but even then, India's fate will be reliant upon the results elsewhere. Syria, meanwhile, have the second spot in their sight. Should they beat India by a decent score and Australia defeat Uzbekistan, they will qualify for the next stage directly, while leaving the Uzbeks at the mercy of the competition. Follow all the build-up and the action here, live. (Streaming | More Football News)

Kick Off! IND 0-0 SYR
 23 Jan 2024, 05:05:17 pm IST
First Half, 5' - IND 0-0 SYR 

An early problem for India as centreback Rahul Bheke is booked with seconds into the match; Bheke's foot was adjudged to be dangerously high while he attempted to win the ball back from his mark. Minutes later, a sensational bit of play from Mahesh Singh Naorem provides India their first chance of the match - and it is a good one. Mahesh's quick feet create an inch of space in the box, but his shot is palmed away by Syrian goalkeeper Ahmad Madania. 

 23 Jan 2024, 05:11:02 pm IST
First Half, 10' - IND 0-0 SYR

First chance for Syria and nearly the first goal. A corner kick is swerved dangerously into the Indian box and is met by Pablo Sabbag, who plays his football for Alianza Lima in Peru. Sabbag derives a stop from Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, but his weak clearance enables a second cross, which is headed over by Aiham Ousou. 

 23 Jan 2024, 05:20:42 pm IST
First Half, 20' - IND 0-0 SYR

Stats so far: 

Possession - IND 49%; SYR 51%

Shorts - IND 1; SYR 4

Shots On Target - IND 1; SYR 2

Yellow Cards - IND 1; SYR 0

An even game this. 

 23 Jan 2024, 05:33:31 pm IST
First Half, 30' - IND 0-0 SYR

Syria, presently, the more dominant side of the two, which explains some of the desperation in the Indian challenges. Meanwhile, a closer inspection of the squads reveals a stark difference between their respective make-ups, with the Syrian team spread out over the globe - only eight individuals on the roster play domestically at the time of writing - while India entirely sourced from the local leagues.

 23 Jan 2024, 05:40:56 pm IST
First Half, 40' - IND 0-0 SYR

Five to go till the interval in this one, it stays 0-0. Meanwhile, miles away, Australia are drawing Uzbekistan by the same scoreline. The Socceroos have been notoriously slow to start games so far in the AFC Asian Cup; both their previous games stayed 0-0 at half-time, before, coincidentally, Jackson Irvine opened the scoring in each.

 23 Jan 2024, 05:52:02 pm IST
Half Time - IND 0-0 SYR
 23 Jan 2024, 06:08:46 pm IST
Second Half - IND 0-0 SYR 

Omar Khribin and Nikhil Poojary are on for Syria and India, respectively. Udanta Singh, too, has entered the action.

 23 Jan 2024, 06:17:32 pm IST
Second Half, 55' - IND 0-0 SYR

A huge chance for India! A glaring miscommunication between Oues and Madania allows Chhangte a shot at goal, albeit from a tight angle. His first attempt at goal his blocked while his second try, a cut-back toward the centre of the box, is defended well by a recovering Oues. Syria survive. 

Meanwhile, the referee has shown a yellow card to India head coach Igor Stimac. 

 23 Jan 2024, 06:26:36 pm IST
Second Half, 65' - IND 0-0 SYR 

Omar Khribin, alone at the back post, misses a glorious opportunity to put his team ahead; the striker heads his attempt marginally over the bar! India can breathe easy for now. 

Meanwhile, more changes for India as Suresh Wangjam replaces Deepak Tangru and Sahal Abdul Samad comes on for Manvir Singh. Igor Stimac has used four of his five substitutes and two substitution windows. 

 23 Jan 2024, 06:40:27 pm IST
Second Half, 76'- IND 0-1 SYR 

Goal! Syria Score! Substitute Omar Khribin has given them the lead! A brilliant goal by the forward, who collects the ball from Hesar, dances around Nikhil Poojary, and slams it into the bottom corner. What a significant goal that could prove to be for Syria, who could be minutes away from their maiden knockout stage appearance! 

Khribin earns a booking for removing his shirt in the aftermath. 

 23 Jan 2024, 06:46:30 pm IST
Second Half, 85' - IND 0-1 SYR

Uzbekistan have equalised against Australia in the pair's match, meaning that they are, currently, on five points - one ahead of Syria. Still, four points from three games *should* be enough for Syria to qualify for the next round of the competition. 

 23 Jan 2024, 07:01:59 pm IST
Full Time - IND 0-1 SYR 

A brief delay but the referee blows his whistle, confirming India's exit from the AFC Asian Cup. The Blue Tigers finish their group campaign with no points, no goals scored, and six conceded.  Syria, meanwhile, can dream of the round-of-16, even if their place among the elite hasn't been confirmed yet. Four points from three games should be enough to take them through to the next round. What an achievement for Hector Cuper's side!
