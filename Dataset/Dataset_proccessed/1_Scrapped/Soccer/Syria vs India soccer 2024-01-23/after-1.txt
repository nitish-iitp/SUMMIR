India vs Syria AFC Asian Cup Highlights: Syria scored in the last 15 minutes of regular time to qualify to the knockouts of the Asian Cup for the first time.
India vs Syria AFC Asian Cup Highlights:

India vs Syria AFC Asian Cup Highlights: A breathless first half ended goalless with India making a good start to the match and Syria then dominating towards the end. The second half has started off ominously for India with the very important Sandesh Jhingan picking up an injury and being taken off for Nikhil Poojary. The second half was almost as frantic as the first half with both sides coming close to scoring at various points. However, it was Syria who broke the deadlock with substitute Omar Khrbin scoring in the 76th minute. India attacked right until the last second of the match though but in the end, they lost 1-0. It meant that India have been knocked out the 2023 Asian Cup without scoring a goal or winning a point.

India vs Syria AFC Asian Cup Live Score: FULL TIME! India 0-1 Syria

India vs Syria AFC Asian Cup Live Score: The ref blows the whistle with the Syrian players asking him to do that instead of asking them to take a goal kick. Their bench stream on to the field, it is a historic moment for a country that has had so, so very little to celebrate in the last decade and more. India can walk off the field with their heads held high. They threatened right till the last second of the match, the only things missing really was the finishing move, which seems to be a plague that India just can't find a cure for. India finish the tournament off with no points or goals, which is not a good look on them at all. But it hasn't been for the want of trying. Everyone knew that they have been handed a devilish group and the fact that they managed to make Australia work for their goal and keep Syria on their toes right till the end is credit to them. The match in between against Uzbekistan, well that's one to forget isn't it. A mixed bag in the end for India, hopefully a bag that'll be useful for them when the World Cup qualifiers comes around later this year, which Stimac said is their real target. That's it from us here as well, thanks for joining!

He runs out of the inner box to collect a nonchalant ball, spills it and the only reason why that hasn't resulted in a goal is because there was a Syrian defender shadowing Chhangte. Corner for India that comes to nothing.
