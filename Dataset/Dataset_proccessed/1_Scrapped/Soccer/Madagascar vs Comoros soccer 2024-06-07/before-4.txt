As I sit down to pen this reflection, it’s hard to fathom just how far this journey has taken me. Day 1 feels like a lifetime ago—a time when the idea of me, an average dad with no prior soccer experience, stepping onto the field was as foreign as scoring the winning goal in the World Cup final. But here I am, on the cusp of something truly extraordinary. From those early first steps on the pitch to the exhilarating highs of joining a pro tryout, each milestone has been a testament to the power of determination, resilience, and the unwavering belief that anything is possible. The road has been riddled with setbacks, doubts, and moments of frustration, but it’s also been full of triumphs, breakthroughs, and the sheer joy of progress and becoming a better man, father, and husband. And then came the opportunity of a lifetime: training with a pro team in the footballing capital of the world—Brazil. The mere thought of it sent shivers down my spine, a dream I never dared to entertain until now. Surrounded by the infectious energy of São Paulo, the lush green of the training pitch became my sanctuary, a place where I could push my limits, hone my skills, and soak in the wisdom of those who have walked this path before me. The journey hasn’t been easy. It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions, a whirlwind of highs and lows, but through it all, one thing has remained constant: the unshakeable resolve to chase my dream of playing in the 2026 World Cup. With each passing day, that dream feels more tangible, more within reach than ever before. As I look back on this unlikely journey, I’m filled with a profound sense of gratitude—for the opportunities that have come my way, for the lessons learned along the journey, and for the unwavering support of those who have believed in me every step of the way. The road to the World Cup may be long and challenging, but I’m ready to embrace every twist and turn, every challenge and opportunity that lies ahead. Stay tuned for a crazy announcement later this week. 😉⚽️ #worldcup2026 #Soccer #DreamChaser #worldcupdad #football
