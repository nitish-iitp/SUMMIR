Tunisia FC squad

The TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers were played on Friday, September 6, 2024, with mixed results across five matches as teams sought to make their mark in the journey to Morocco 2025.

DR Congo secured a narrow win over Guinea, with Edo Kayembe’s 27th-minute strike giving Sébastien Desabre's team a solid start to their qualification campaign. Guinea will look to bounce back against Tanzania.

Tunisia left it late to grab victory, with Ferjani Sassi scoring in the eighth minute of stoppage time. The match was tight, with Madagascar’s strong defensive performance undone in the dying moments.

South Africa rescued a draw at the last minute in a thrilling contest against Uganda. Lyle Foster gave Bafana Bafana an early lead, but two quick goals from Uganda turned the game around. However, Thalente Mbatha salvaged a point for South Africa with a late strike.

Togo took the lead through Kevin Denkey, but Liberia equalised deep into stoppage time, with Wesley Gibson ensuring the points were shared.

Sierra Leone and Chad played out a goalless draw, with both teams failing to break the deadlock in a tightly contested encounter.
