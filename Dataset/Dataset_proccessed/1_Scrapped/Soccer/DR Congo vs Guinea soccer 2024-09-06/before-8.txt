Preview: Egypt vs. Cape Verde - prediction, team news, lineups

Egypt will welcome Cape Verde to the Cairo International Stadium on Friday as both teams kick off their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign.

Both teams met for the first time during the AFCON 2023 group stage, with the game ending in a dramatic 2-2 draw that saw each team score a goal in stoppage time .

The most successful team in the Africa Cup of Nations, Egypt, will begin their journey to another edition of the competition, looking to appear for the 27th time.

The Pharaohs failed to make it past the round of 16 in Ivory Coast at the last edition earlier this year, losing via penalties to DR Congo after a 1-1 draw in normal time.

Having last won the competition in 2010, the seven-time champions, marshalled by record scorer Hossam Hassan, will be hoping to replicate their seamless qualifying campaign for the last edition, having won five and losing just one of six matches.

Egypt were in competitive action during the last international window in June, beating Burkina Faso 2-1 before a 1-1 draw with Guinea-Bissau in World Cup qualifying matches, leaving them in pole position in their group.

Hassan will hope his side can replicate their form in the World Cup qualifiers as they kick off the AFCON qualifiers - the Pharaohs have three wins and a draw in four World Cup qualifying matches.

However, the potential of appearing in three consecutive AFCONs for the first time in history will be too good for Cape Verde to pass up on, making this a stern test for the hosts.

The Blue Sharks performed admirably in the last AFCON, reaching the quarter-final where they lost to South Africa via penalties after a goalless draw. Their form has since extended beyond the competition, having won three of their four matches since then, including a 1-0 victory over Libya last time out in a World Cup qualifying match.

It will be a huge test for Bubista's men who have struggled for consistency on the road during qualification matches, with their recent away wins coming against Eswatini, while losing to Cameroon and Togo.

Cape Verde will be counting on their disciplined defence once again, as the Blue Sharks barely concede goals – the four goals conceded away to Cameroon is an exception for the visitors who have kept five clean sheets in their last six matches across all competitions.

Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush has returned to the Egypt squad after missing the June matches due to a hand injury.

Al Ahly goalkeeper Hamza Alaa, who made a tournament-high 21 saves during the Paris Olympics, has earned a first senior call-up alongside Mohamed Shehata (Zamalek) and Khaled Sobhi (Ceramica Cleopatra).

Liverpool star Mohamed Salah will be aiming to score in consecutive matches after netting the only goal against Guinea-Bissau.

Cape Verde are likely to retain their attacking quartet of Jovane Cabral, Bebe, Joao Monteiro, and Ryan Mendes for this encounter.

Diney Borges, who scored the winning goal in the last game against Libya, is expected to partner with Logan Costa in central defence.


Egypt possible starting lineup:
El Shenawy; Rabia, Fathi, Abdelmonem; Hany, Attia, Zizo, Ashour, Trezeguet; Mohamed, Salah

Cape Verde possible starting lineup:
Vozinha; Fernandes, Costa, Diney, Moreira; Andrade, Pina; Mendes, Monteiro, Cabral; Bebe



We say: Egypt X-Y Cape Verde

Egypt are seasonal performers when it comes to the AFCON qualifiers, losing just one of the last 12 AFCON qualifying matches making them favourites in this clash.

Cape Verde have a solid defence and are now a force in African football. However, they have found it difficult to pick up results on the road against top oppositions, which is why we think the hosts will win this one.
