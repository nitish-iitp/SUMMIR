Ireland 0 Switzerland 1 (FT)

277 days ago

Well, it was okay-ish until Xherdan Shaqiri planted a free-kick into the corner of Gavin Bazunu’s net. The ghosts of Brian Kerr’s past had come back to haunt him. Remember?

“Hasn’t he the funniest shape of any player in the Premier League? He’s like a bloke that you might see standing outside the pub on a Sunday morning with his boots in his bag, saying ‘I wonder where we’re playing today?’ And a white van comes along and picks him up. He’s a little chunky fellah, about 5ft3in, he’s wide at the hips – that’s probably being generous to him – and the jersey looks like it’s bed in to him. If he lived in Dublin, he’d be called a ‘Barreller’.”

Half-time: Ireland 0, Barreller 1.

—  Mary Hannigan

Mary Hannigan’s TV column can be read here. Safe to say, the script wrote itself in terms of Shaqiri silencing the criticism of Brian Kerr, now an Irish technical advisor.

We’ll see

—  John O'Shea

John O’Shea’s response when asked if he has done enough to throw his hat into the ring for the permanent Ireland manager role.

277 days ago

Questions will immediately turn to John O’Shea’s replacement. Who is it? Is O’Shea going anywhere? Will the new manager continue the long-ball and set piece reliance displayed by Ireland tonight?

Eight shots for Ireland is a number they’d be reasonably happy with, but only one was on target. Half-chances, but few quality ones.

Full-time: Ireland 0 Switzerland 1

Ireland fall to defeat. It’s not a horror show, if anything they will be frustrated to have conceded just off a Shaqiri free-kick but John O’Shea’s side just could not fashion a quality enough opportunity to equalise.

There were plenty of half-chances, blocks on the edge of the box and bicycle kicks high and wide, but ultimately Mvogo in the Swiss goal went relatively untested for most of the evening.

277 days ago

90+3 mins: Ferguson looks to break after a beautiful touch from Idah. He waits for support instead of bursting forward and duly gives the ball away. That, you would think, is that.

277 days ago

90+1 mins: CHANCE! Azaz again finds space on the edge of the box but his shot is blocked. Sykes is furious he didn’t play him in behind. There will be three minutes of added time.

90 mins: A lovely touch on the counter sees Sykes played in behind. However, his cross looking for Idah is poor and Switzerland clear.

277 days ago

87 mins: Late change for Ireland. Finn Azaz comes on for Josh Cullen.

Azaz is immediately involved, opening up a chance to shoot on the edge of the box. He doesn’t pull the trigger, instead laying it of. A dangerous cross is headed behind for a corner.

CHANCE! Mvogo comes to punch the ball clear but not convincingly so. Ireland are pushing hard here for an equaliser.

277 days ago

85 mins: Seamus Coleman has his name taken as he sees yellow. He looked to have gotten the ball when sliding in on Omeragic, but his studs were a bit high, dangerously so.

Ireland 0 Switzerland 1

277 days ago

81 mins: CHANCE! What a goal that would have been. Idah picks up the ball just inside the Swiss half and drives forward with it. Once he shrugs off one defender, no one else comes out to close him down and he takes aim. It’s a good strike, but always rising as it sails over the bar.

Tonight’s attendance at the Aviva is confirmed as 35,742. That’s about 3,000 fewer people than the Belgium game on Saturday.

277 days ago

78 mins: Switzerland have to be alert to the danger after Cullen almost plays Szmodics in behind. Ireland have looked the better side in the last 10 minutes.

Two changes being made by O’Shea: O’Dowda is on for Brady, Sykes is on for Szmodics.

Switzerland replace Schar with Becir Omeragic.

277 days ago

75 mins: This time Ireland do get a foul. Elvedi bundles Idah over on the counter and duly sees yellow. Switzerland make another change, the goal-scorer Shaqiri is off. He’s replaced by Noah Okafor.

277 days ago

74 mins: NO FOUL! Doherty and Idah link up well to send the wide man into space on the edge of the box. He goes down under a challenge, looks back at the referee, play on. Home fans are incensed.

277 days ago

69 mins: PENALTY APPEAL! Fans scream for a hand ball as Idah’s header on a corner is blocked. On replay, it may well have hit a Swiss arm... play continues.

277 days ago

66 mins: CHANCE! The long ball is definitely Ireland’s best chance of a goal. Brady launches it into the box where Doherty does well just to get a head on it and keep the ball alive. It loops up invitingly for Idah six yards out, he tries an acrobatic bicycle kick but he cannot hit the target.

64 mins: Ireland’s longest passage in possession results in a free-kick as Idah is fouled down the right flank. Switzerland make three subs before the ball comes in: Mbabu for Widmer on the right, Zakaria for in midfield and Kutesa for Ndoye up front.

Smallbone this time launches the free-kick into the box and it is a dangerous one. It just about takes a flick off a Swiss head before rolling clear.

277 days ago

61 mins: Bazunu is called into action. Cullen is beaten far too easily by Amdouni who sets up Aebischer for the strike on the edge of the box. It’s straight at the Ireland ‘keeper.

277 days ago

59 mins: Not for the first time today, Ireland pass up the opportunity to play someone in behind. This time it’s Brady who took too long to feed Szmodics in space, meaning his pass is easily cut out when it does eventually come. Brady does win a free moments later though, Silvan Widmer seeing the game’s first yellow for cutting him down late.

277 days ago

57 mins: Three changes for Ireland. Knight is gone for Will Smallbone, Omobamidele is off as Matt Doherty comes on while Johnston makes way for Adam Idah. Can understand the Omobamidele move since he’s been guilty of breaking up a few attacks by giving the ball away, but that looks harsh on Johnston who has been the only bright spark going forward.

277 days ago

56 mins: Ireland break forward as Johnston wins the ball back, playing it up to Szmodics. He tries to pick a pass to Ferguson in the box but it’s underhit and a red jersey gets there first. Ireland don’t look like they’re incapable of creating something, but they also don’t look like they will create either.

277 days ago

54 mins: Ireland nearly get caught after coughing up possession high up the pitch. Amdouni looks to find a through ball but Collins and Brady just about combine to clear the danger.

277 days ago

51 mins: Coleman this time has it high up the pitch. He does well to break to the box, cutting the ball back from the byline. It’s deflected behind for a corner. Brady, for once, puts in a shocking ball which flies over the head of everybody.

277 days ago

50 mins: Ferguson goes down in a heap near the corner flag but no foul is given. Coleman down the other end screams for a free-kick when tustling for the ball close to his own box. Ireland aren’t getting the decisions at the moment!

277 days ago

46 mins: Ireland get the second half underway. One change at the break. Switzerland have taken off Granit Xhaka as Remo Freuler replaces their skipper in midfield.

277 days ago

With the second half moments away, this is the Shaqiri free-kick that currently stands as the difference between the two sides.

Ireland have largely resorted to forcing Switzerland into mistakes high up the pitch and set-pieces for their goal threat. Robbie Brady, as always, has been a menace with his left foot from dead ball situations. He set up the best Ireland chance of note thus far when Andrew Omobamidele headed straight at Yvon Mvogo in the Swiss goal.

A nice moment at half-time as former Ireland kitman Charlie O’Leary is welcomed onto the pitch to celebrate his 100th birthday. Gordon Manning recently interviewed Charlie to reflect on his many, many stories travelling with Ireland. You can find it here.

This just in from soccer correspondent Gavin Cummiskey. A former Chelsea manager is attending tonight’s match, but the FAI have confirmed he is not in the running for the Ireland job.

Half-time: Ireland 0 Switzerland 1

The half ends with a dead end Johnston run down the flank trying to stop the ball from going out for a goal-kick. Not horrendous from Ireland, they’ve probably created the marginally better chance when Omobamidele headed straight at the ‘keeper from yards out.

Shaqiri’s excellent free-kick is the difference between the two sides at the break, but the visitors could have had another if not for the post denying Xhaka from distance.

43 mins: Chance! Coleman sticks a ball into the box which Johnston does get to, but he can’t control his header. It was well wide in the end, but he did have a decent sight of goal.

ANOTHER CHANCE! This time Ferguson gets on the ball high up the pitch, chasing a lost cause which ends up coming good. He tees up Cullen for a strike from the edge of the box but he sends it wide. Mvogo had his near post covered in any case.

277 days ago

40 mins: Wow, Ireland almost concede ANOTHER goal from outside the box. This time they give it away straight to Xhaka, and with Bazunu off his line, only the posts saves him from conceding to the former Arsenal man.

Ireland 0 Switzerland 1

277 days ago

39 mins: Once again, Brady’s left foot causes no end of issues. This time it’s off a corner, but Omobamidele and Ferguson get in each other’s way both trying to get a head on it. They collide and the ball rolls out for a goal kick. If Ferguson heard the shout coming from his defensive colleague and ducked out of the way, it would have been a free header yards out.

277 days ago

37 mins: CHANCE! The first time tonight Ireland have worked Mvogo in the Swiss goal. Brady swings in a beautiful free-kick which pin-balls around the box. Switzerland can’t get it clear, and after O’Shea heads it back across goal Omobamidele finds himself in space. His header is on target, but not powerful enough to threaten Mvogo.

277 days ago

33 mins: Ireland get into the Swiss box for the first time tonight but they are wasteful. Szmodics makes a run down the right on the counter, launching a lovely cross-field ball to pick out Johnston. He runs past a defender and into the area, but his ball across the six-yard box is poor as Switzerland clear easily.

277 days ago

28 mins: Ireland have a chance to get in behind but a lack of vision costs them. Knight has Szmodics in acres of space, defender well beaten, down the right, but with his back to his wide man he doesn’t see him. Instead, he switches it to Johnston down the left where there are more red jerseys. Johnston cuts in off the left to try and shoot but is unceremoniously pushed off kilter. No foul, bizarrely.

277 days ago

25 mins: Knight gives the ball away with a poor pass when trying to play in Coleman as Ireland break. The hosts have been very sluggish since their bright start with a few dangerous long balls.

277 days ago

23 mins: O’Shea catches Amodouni with a rash challenge right on the edge of the box. Big chance here with the free-kick for Switzerland, Xhaka and Shaqiri standing over it...

GOAL XHERDAN SHAQIRI! The former Liverpool man buries the free-kick into the bottom corner. Bazunu had no chance. What a strike

21 mins: Switzerland try to set up a clever set play to open up a volley off a corner. However, Brady spots the run and is alert to the danger, allowing Ireland to clear.

277 days ago

18 mins: Half an opportunity for Ireland as Omobamidele’s high press forces Schar to give the ball away. It was probably a foul from the Irish defender, but he gets away with it. Johnston is first to the ball close to the Switzerland box but he is dispossessed as he tries to open up an avenue for a shot.

277 days ago

15 mins: First shot on target of the game. Sierro tests Bazunu from distance but it’s poorly struck, an easy save for the Southampton man.

277 days ago

10 mins: Something you don’t see everyday. Ndoye beats Coleman all ends up on the flank, Ireland fortunate that Collins got a leg out to block his strike from the edge of the area. Omobamidele then needs to head clear a follow up chance, but Ireland deal with the corner and break upfield through Johnston.

277 days ago

9 mins: A quiet few minutes after Ireland started brightly. A clever Shaqiri lay-off nearly allowed the Swiss to get in behind but the ball over the top was overhit.

277 days ago

5 mins: Ireland are taking a direct approach, with some success. A long ball to Ferguson allows him to link with Johnston before feeding Brady out wide. Seconds later, Knight threatens again after a long ball down the right. Both attacks come to nothing, but Ireland are getting in behind them.

277 days ago

3 mins: A bit of attacking life from Ireland. Szmodics’ first-time ball on the turn is a good one that ends Knight in behind. He looks to by a foul close to the corner flag, the linesman eventually giving it to him. Ireland free from a dangerous position...

Brady’s ball in is a good one but it’s a Swiss head that gets to it first.

277 days ago

2 min: Szmodics gets bundled over chasing a high ball but no foul comes. Shaqiri and Xhaka get early touches as Switzerland look to break, but Ireland drop back into shape well. Collins has to rush into action to stop Aebischer from breaking in behind but the pass had too much on it to threaten. Ireland clear.

277 days ago

1 min: We are underway in the Aviva! Switzerland, wearing all red, start with the ball. Ireland are in their new green home kit with Sky emblazoned on the front and white shorts.

277 days ago

Right then, anthems done. I do like how the FAI get a singer to do Amhrán na bhFiann, rather than just a band. Gives it a bit more oomph.

A crowd below 38,000 is expected at the Aviva Stadium, seemingly due to school holidays and general disinterest in a side that has failed to secure a win of substance since beating Scotland in June 2022.

—  Gavin Cummiskey

It’s safe to say these friendlies have not captured the imagination of the footballing public. As Gavin Cummiskey writes, though, it is important for Ireland to rediscover a winning habit given they have not come across a “win of substance” since beating Scotland in 2022.

You can read our full match preview here.

At half-time, I met an Ireland fan on his way out the gate with his family, headed for home. Four months ago, at the last Ireland game, I had been standing in the same place when I met the same Ireland fan on his way home at half-time.

—  Ken Early

Of course on Saturday, the first game of the O’Shea mini-era, a 0-0 draw with Belgium. Despite the lack of goals and some fan apathy, Ken Early writes of how Ireland’s performance was surprisingly encouraging.

Given it’s the final match of John O’Shea’s interim tenure - supposedly - and the FAI has refused to announce a permanent successor to Stephen Kenny, plenty have started wondering if the current boss will be kept on. After all, the FAI has previous in this area, saying Eileen Gleeson would categorically not be kept on as permanent women’s manager before she ultimately was given the job.

At a press conference yesterday, defender Dara O’Shea said that the next manager must have a deep connection to Irish football. When it was pointed out to him that such a description matched his current boss, he did not disagree. Is tonight the last we will see of John O’Shea in the Ireland hotseat?

Team news is expected in roughly one hour before kick-off, but the one thing we do know is that Chiedozie Ogbene will not feature for John O’Shea’s side. He’s gone back to Luton with an unspecified injury, as Gavin Cummiskey reports.
