Former Manchester United player and Ireland assistant O'Shea was given the helm approaching two friendly matches (Belgium on Saturday and Switzerland on Tuesday) as the FAI failed to secure the services of a permanent manager.

The vacancy arose after Stephen Kenny's term in charge was not renewed last November after a run of poor results. O'Shea's first game in charge was the 0-0 draw with Belgium on Saturday evening. 

He now turns his attentions to Switzerland, again at the Aviva, on Tuesday night where a win could be the catalyst for O'Shea being offered the job on a full-time basis after long-term target Lee Carsley ruled himself out last week.

Liam Scales and Troy Parrott were ruled out for these two games and O'Shea and Ryan Manning was a late call-up. Chiedozie Ogbene is out through injury after playing on Saturday night and has flown back to the UK. Joe Hodge and Andy Moran have been promoted to the squad following the Ireland under-21s 7-0 win over San Marino last Friday.
