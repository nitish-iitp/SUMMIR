After a tight first half of Saturday afternoon’s game against Rock Springs, Broncs freshman Ruby Hoelscher stepped up for a set piece with about 15 minutes remaining in the game.

She had been working on curling the ball with her brother, and this was the perfect opportunity to give her newly honed skill a try. She stepped a little to the right, charged toward the ball and booted it as hard as she could.

Broncs senior Piper Lee winds up for a throw-in during Saturday’s game against Rock Springs. Jackson’s 4-1 victory brought its total goal differential up to 14-2.
