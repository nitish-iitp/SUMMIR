Preview: Congo vs. Niger - prediction, team news, lineups

Congo and Niger return to action in Group E of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers when they go head to head at the Stade des Martyrs on Thursday.

Having failed to win any of the last five meetings between the two nations, the Mena will head into the game aiming to get one over the home side and pick up back-to-back wins in the qualifiers.

Match preview

Former Nancy striker Mons Bassouamina came up clutch for Congo in their first outing of the year as he netted a 74th-minute equaliser to force a 1-1 draw with Gabon in a friendly at the Stade des Marais on March 25.

Prior to that, Isaac Ngata's men kicked off their quest for a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup as they suffered a 4-2 hammering against Zambia when the two nations squared off at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium on November 17.

Despite the efforts of Silvere Ganvoula and Bassouamina, Congo were denied a dream start to the qualifiers as Lameck Banda, Fashion Sakala and a brace from Leicester City man Patson Daka inspired Zambia to a huge opening-day victory.

The Red Devils head into Thursday's clash without a win in any of their most recent four games across all competitions and have won just one of their last seven competitive matches since September 2022.

However, Congo will be backing themselves to get up and running in the qualifiers on Thursday as they take on an opposing side who have failed to win any of their previous five encounters, losing twice and claiming two draws since June 2012.

Having lost 1-0 to Senegal in their first outing of the year, Niger were condemned to a second consecutive defeat in 2024 on March 22 when they were beaten 2-1 by Togo after giving up their lead in the final half-hour at the Stade El Bachir.

Zaki Badou's men now turn their attention to the World Cup qualifiers, where they kicked off their campaign with a somewhat disappointing 1-0 defeat at the hands of Tanzania on November 18.

However, Niger bounced back three days later when they held their own to see out a 2-1 victory over Zambia courtesy of goals from Amadou Moutari and 23-year-old Boubacar Goumey.

With the defeat against Togo, the Mena have now lost nine of their last 11 matches across all competitions while conceding 17 goals and scoring just seven since January 2023.

While Niger will be looking to find their feet on Thursday and pick up back-to-back qualifying victories, they have failed to win any of their last eight competitive away matches, losing five and claiming three draws since beating Djibouti 4-2 in September 2021.

Team News

Congo have called up 27 players for their upcoming qualifying matches, with the likes of Ravy Tsouka, Antoine Makoumbou and Boavista midfielder Gaius Makouta headlining the squad.

Ngata has opted for a relatively inexperienced group, with 12 players earning their first-ever senior call-up, including Strasbourg's 18-year-old midfielder Rabby Nzingoula and Northampton Town man Will Hondermarck.

Young Boys striker Ganvoula has netted six goals in 17 international matches and we expect the 27-year-old to lead Congo's attack once again, alongside Bassouamina, who has scored in the nation's last two games.

Goumey was involved in both goals in the victory over Zambia back in November and we expect the Al Karkh striker to spearhead Niger's attack once again.  

Ousmane Diabate and Sheriff Tiraspol man Abdoul Moumouni should team up at the centre of the park while skipper Abdoulaye Boureima Katkore should retain his role at the heart of the defence.


Congo possible starting lineup:
Vimalin; Illoy-Ayyet, Andzouana, Passi, Tsouka; Makoumbou, Dembi, Avounou Makouta; Ganvoula, Bassouamina

Niger possible starting lineup:
Djibo; Yakubu, Katkore, Massoudi, Alhassane; Moumouni, Diabate; Moutari, Moussa, Djibrilla; Goumey


We say: Congo 2-1 Niger

Having lost their opening match in Group E, Congo will head into Thursday's clash looking to get their qualifying campaign back on track. The Red Devils have enjoyed the better of this fixture, and given their home advantage, we fancy them to extend their dominance over Niger.
