France lineup vs. Israel: Predicted XI for Nations League clash including Kylian Mbappe replacement

France manager Didier Deschamps has been deprived of two of Les Bleus' greatest-ever attackers for this month's UEFA Nations League fixtures, starting with Thursday's clash with Israel in Budapest.

The 2018 World Cup winners - who sit second in League A Group 2 on three points - were rocked by the news of Antoine Griezmann's international retirement after 137 appearances and 44 goals for his nation at the end of September.

Furthermore, Deschamps decided against calling up Kylian Mbappe for this month's fixtures, as the Real Madrid man has only just returned from a muscular problem and will be given a couple of weeks to get back to optimal fitness.

Nevertheless, Mbappe and Griezmann were only substitutes in the 2-0 win over Belgium last month, where Randal Kolo Muani, Ousmane Dembele and Marcus Thuram joined forces in the attack.

Despite Dembele's recent falling out with Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique - which seems to have been quickly rectified - he remains an integral cog in the France machine and should start over the in-form Michael Olise on Thursday evening.

However, as Kolo Muani has struggled to impress domestically, Deschamps could move Thuram to a central role and introduce Bradley Barcola, who has excelled for PSG at the start of the current season.

None of the three midfielders from the win over Belgium - Matteo Guendouzi, Manu Kone and N'Golo Kante - should be retained, as Warren Zaire-Emery, the fit-again Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni enter the fray.

As Dayot Upamecano has been sent home with a thigh problem, Ibrahima Konate and William Saliba could form the central pairing in front of Mike Maignan, as Jules Kounde and Theo Hernandez start in the wide areas.

France possible starting lineup:
Maignan; Kounde, Saliba, Konate, Hernandez; Zaire-Emery, Tchouameni, Camavinga; Dembele, Thuram, Barcola
