On Thursday, the third round of the UEFA Nations League Division A will feature a match between Israel and France!

Israel, competing in Group A2, is seen as the underdog, with its participation in the elite division considered a significant achievement. Despite earlier losses to Belgium (1-3) and Italy (1-2), Israel has not appeared to be entirely outmatched in either game.

France, meanwhile, began the tournament with an unexpected 1-3 defeat to Italy but quickly recovered, displaying their class with a 2-0 victory over Belgium. This result places them second in the group, with three points and a goal difference of 3:3, which is fitting for a team of their stature.

Although France possesses a stronger and deeper talent pool, the team often opts not to pursue high-scoring victories at any cost. It is expected that the French side will confirm its status as favorites in a closely fought, low-scoring contest.

France to win and under 4.5 goals in the match 1.63
