Israel vs France

Chelsea's Christopher Nkunku scored his first goal for France as Didier Deschamps' side secured a comfortable 4-1 Nations League win over Israel.

TELL ME MORE

Eduardo Camavinga gave France the lead in the sixth minute when the Real Madrid star's long-range shot inexplicably squirmed past goalkeeper Omri Glazer. Just when the French looked to press home their advantage, Omri Gandelman directed a superb header in off the post as he capitalised on some slack marking from William Saliba in the 24th minute.

The Israelis weren't level for long, however, as just four minutes later, Nkunku held off some would-be defenders and fired past Glazer to restore their advantage. Two quickfire breakaway goals from substitutes Matteo Guendouzi and Bradley Barcola in the 87th and 89th minute respectively put some extra gloss on a game that was closer than the scoreline suggested.

A Kylian Mbappe-less France took a step closer to the quarter-finals of the competition with a clinical display at Bozsik Arena in Hungary on Thursday night.

THE MVP

On what was his first start for France for more than two years, Nkunku was a smooth operator for his side for much of the night. He showed good strength to hold off the defence and took his goal with aplomb. The Chelsea man showed his versatility as he played on the left and in a more central attacking role. His performance will be food for thought for Deschamps going forward.

THE BIG LOSER

France were deserved winners but it could have been very different if Israel keeper Glazer had not made such a calamitous attempt to keep out Camavinga's effort. Arguably, he was beaten too easily for Nkunku's goal, too, as the 26-year-old easily slotted his strike under the Red Star Belgrade stopper.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

France, who are one point behind League A Group 2 leaders Italy, travel to Belgium on Monday in their next Nations League encounter. A win against Domenico Tedesco's side will put them in a very strong position to reach the last eight of the tournament.
