New international break and Italy, led by Luciano Spalletti, returns to the field for the Nations League. The coach is preparing for two home matches: the one at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome against Belgium and the one on October 14 against Israel, scheduled at the Bluenergy Stadium in Udine. Meanwhile, the first withdrawal has already occurred: Fiorentina's forward Moise Kean had to leave the training camp due to back pain. In his place, Spalletti has called up Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese, who will have the opportunity to play in his stadium in the second match. First call-up for Pisilli and Daniel Maldini, two potential pieces of the new Azzurri cycle. 

 

Italy, Moise Kean leaves the training camp: Lorenzo Lucca called up

Italy has regained confidence in the last two matches of the competition (the victories against France and Israel), and now has a chance to secure qualification for the quarter-finals.

 

Italy-Belgium: time

The match between Italy and Belgium, valid for the third day of Group B of the UEFA Nations League League A, will be held at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome today, Thursday, October 10 at 20:45. 

 

Where to watch on TV and streaming

Italy-Belgium will be broadcast live on TV by Rai on channel Rai Uno and, in HD version, on 501. It will also be available for streaming in Italy via RaiPlay, also accessible through the app. 

 

Italy-Belgium: official lineups

Luciano Spalletti has confirmed the lineup that challenged and defeated France in Paris on September 6 in the Nations League. The entire eleven is being fielded again against Belgium tonight at the Olimpico with the 3-5-2 formation featuring Donnarumma in goal and a trio of central defenders composed of Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, and Calafiori. Cambiaso and Dimarco as wing-backs, while Frattesi, Ricci, and Tonali are in midfield. Pellegrini acts as a second striker behind Retegui.

ITALY (3-5-1-1): Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori; Cambiaso, Frattesi, Ricci, Tonali, Dimarco; Pellegrini; Retegui. Coach: Luciano Spalletti.

BELGIUM (4-2-3-1): Casteels; Debast, Faes, Theate, De Cuyper; Tielemans, Mangala; De Ketelaere, Trossard, Doku; Openda. Coach: Tedesco.

 

The referee

The referee for Italy-Norway in the Nations League will be the Norwegian Espen Eskas, 36 years old, international since 2017. He officiated the Champions League match Milan-Liverpool on September 17.

 
The new Nations League format

Compared to the previous edition, which allowed the group winner direct access to the Final Four, the top two teams in the group will advance this time. The eight teams will compete in the quarter-finals (home and away) in March 2024. The winners of the quarter-finals will then secure a place in the Finals, scheduled for June 2025 in the country of one of the four finalists. The fourth-placed team in the group will be relegated to League B, while - another novelty - the third-placed team will play a playoff to avoid relegation with one of the second-placed teams from League B. The ticket to the 2026 World Cup playoffs, reserved for the four finalists, is highly coveted.

Pisilli called up to the National team, who is the new star of Roma: the relationship with Totti and De Rossi, passion for journalism, age, career, and role

 

The group of Italy

The Italy-Belgium match could be decisive for the Azzurri's progress in the Nations League. A victory would bring qualification to the quarter-finals very close. A double victory, also against Israel, could even guarantee it, with a favorable result in the match between France and Belgium.

Standings: Italy 6 points France 3 points Belgium 3 points Israel 0 points

Words from Pisilli 

"It's an honor to be here, a great satisfaction. Spalletti's words are very pleasing and I hope to turn them into concrete actions. I found out about the call by reading the pre-call. At first, I didn't expect it at all, then after the pre-call, I said 'We'll see...' without too many expectations. Now I will try to learn from all my teammates, they are the best of the best."

 

 

Words from Daniel Maldini

It's always nice to be called up to the National team. My family has always been close to me, we talked little about this call-up and more about other things as we always do." Daniel admitted that he could have been called up by Venezuela: "I was contacted but I always preferred to wait for the right moment for me and I think the call-up came at the ideal moment, I feel very good. With my dad, I talked little, I know he is happy and everyone is happy about this call-up. That's what's important. I didn't ask my dad for any advice on how to skip defenders. It feels great to enter here and see photos of my dad and grandfather. I am focused on my training camp here. I live day by day."
