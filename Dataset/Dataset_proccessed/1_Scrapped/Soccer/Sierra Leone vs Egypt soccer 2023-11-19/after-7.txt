Nine-man Sierra Leone suffer 2-0 defeat to Egypt
 November 19, 2023

Mahmoud Trezeguet scored a brace as Egypt dislodged nine-man Sierra Leone in match day two of the 2026 World Cup qualifier in Liberia on Sunday.

Coach Amidu Karim started brightly but was unable to take advantage of half-cut chances in the opening minutes of the game at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Stadium.

The visitors took the lead in the 18-minute after a decent finish as Egypt maintained their perfect start to the 2026 World Cup qualifiers with a 2-0 away win against Sierra Leone in Liberia on Sunday.

His second came in the 62-second minute from a clever pass from Liverpool’s striker Mohamed Salah, who fines Trezequet to double the visitors lead.

Sierra Leone frustratedly finished the match with nine players on the field, as Tyrese Fornah and Abdul Jarju Kabia were sent off – with only a point from their opening two games. 

The victory bookmarked Egypt’s first victory over Leone Stars in three meetings as Leone Stars played two games in the qualifiers with no goals, one draw and a loss and two goals conceded,

Egypt sits atop Group A with an impeccable six points from two games, leading ahead of Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone, each having amassed only one point after one game.

How qualifying works

The nine group winners will qualify automatically for the FIFA World Cup 26™. The four best runners-up will compete for one place at the FIFA Play-Off Tournament.
