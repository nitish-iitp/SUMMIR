Egypt have defeated Sierra Leone 2-0 away from home in the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches.

The Pharaohs had earned a dominant 6-0 victory over Djibouti last week with Mohamed Salah scoring a hat-trick for his country.

With an away clash against Sierra Leone, Egypt were looking to capitalise on their perfect start to the qualifiers but had to do without a number of key players.

Emam Ashour, Hussein El-Shahat, and Tarek Hamed were all excluded from their travelling squad for disciplinary reasons according to the Egyptian Football Association.

The game had a slow start from both sides due to poor pitch conditions and needed some time for each team to find their early on.

Mahmoud Trezeguet gave Egypt the breakthrough after 18 minutes following a sublime linkup play with Salah and Mostafa Mohamed.

Sierra Leone were later reduced to 10 men before the end of the first half with Tyrese Fornah receiving a red card for a lunge on Hamdy Fathi.

In the 62nd minute, the visitors managed to double their lead with Trezeguet getting on the scoresheet once again after finishing off a quick counter-attack initiated by Salah.

The victory cemented Egypt’s place at the top of Group A with six points as they are set to resume their qualification campaign following the end of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations next year.
