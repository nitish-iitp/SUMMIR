Euro 2024 Fantasy team previews: Switzerland
ROCKY7
57 CommentsSHARE

Our Euro 2024 Fantasy team previews continue apace with Switzerland.

The Swiss are in a tough group but will be buoyed by their Euro 2020 showing, when they overcame France and made it through to the quarter-finals.

In these country-by-country guides, we’ll be looking at the best players from each nation, taking a stab at predicted line-ups, reviewing the road to Germany and more.

To do this, we’ll be calling on the help of correspondents from each country.

Here, we enlist the assistance of X user and Swiss national Mertens_Is_Life.

All prices given are from the official Fantasy Euro 2024 game.

THE ROAD TO QUALIFICATION
Post	Team	P	W	D	L	GF	GA	Diff	Pts
1	Romania	10	6	4	0	16	5	+11	22
2	Switzerland	10	4	5	1	22	11	+11	17
3	Israel	10	4	3	3	11	11	0	15
4	Belarus	10	3	3	4	9	14	-5	12
5	Kosovo	10	2	5	3	10	10	0	11
6	Andorra	10	0	2	8	3	20	-17	2

Switzerland are growing in pedigree as an international force. They first appeared in this competition at Euro ’96 and the Schweizer Nati are now looking forward to their sixth appearance in the competition, after a best-ever finish last time out, when they reached the quarter-finals.

Switzerland qualified for the short trip to Germany with one match to spare when a 1-1 draw with Kosovo ensured they finished as runners-up in their group behind Romania.

They came through largely thanks to a strong start to their campaign, smashing Belarus and Israel 5-0 and 3-0 respectively before making it three wins on the spin with a 2-1 victory over Andorra.

Thereafter their momentum slowed as they managed only one win in their next six matches, but their fifth draw of the campaign proved enough to see them over the line. A 1-0 reverse against Romania in their final match was academic.

Murat Yakin can count on players of class and experience such as Yann Sommer (€5.0m), Manuel Akanji (€5.0m), Granit Xhaka (€6.0m) and Xherdan Shaqiri (€6.5m) – proven winners who will not be fazed by the prospect of facing Germany, Hungary and Scotland.

QUALIFICATION IN NUMBERS
Most starts: Manuel Akanji, Granit Xhaka (10)
Most goals: Zeki Amdouni (6)
Most assists: Xherdan Shaqiri (3)
Clean sheets: 3 from 10

RECORD SINCE QUALIFYING
Date	Competition	Opposition	Result	Score	Goalscorers	Assists
23 March	Friendly	Denmark (a)	D	0-0		
26 March	Friendly	Republic of Ireland (a)	W	1-0	Shaqiri	Amdouni
4 June	Friendly	Estonia (h)	W	4-0	Zuber, Amdouni, Elvedi, Shaqiri pen	Amdouni, Schar, Vargas
8 June	Friendly	Austria (h)	D	1-1	Widmer	Vargas

Switzerland have played four times since qualifying for Euro 2024.

They shared a goalless draw with Denmark before beating Republic of Ireland 1-0 in Dublin courtesy of Shaqiri’s 30th international goal.

Switzerland warmed up for Euro 2024 with a 4-0 victory over Estonia, before playing out a 1-1 draw with Austria on Saturday.

The Swiss have lost only once since December 2022, when they were knocked out of the World Cup by Portugal at the Round of 16 stage. Their dead-rubber defeat to Romania has been their only reverse in 14 matches.

MOST RECENT INTERNATIONAL LINE-UPS

04/06/2024 – Estonia (h)

(3-4-2-1): Mvogo; Schar, Akanji, Elvedi; Widmer (Stergiou 61), Freuler (Sierro 46), Xhaka (Aebischer 74), Ndoye (Rieder 61); Shaqiri, Zuber (Vargas 46); Duah (Amdouni 46)

08/06/2024 – Austria (h)

(3-4-2-1): Sommer; Elvedi, Akanji (Stergiou 76), Rodriguez (Zesiger 76); Widmer, Freuler, Xhaka (Sierro 76), Ndoye; Vargas (Okafor 66), Zuber (Aebischer 42); Amdouni (Shaqiri 67)

GROUP FIXTURES

15 June: Hungary
19 June: Scotland
23 June: Germany
HOW FAR WILL THEY GET?

“The last 16. I don’t expect us to top the group, so if we finish second we will then have to play against the second-placed team from the group of Spain, Italy, Croatia and Albania.

“So, it’s definitely not an easy task. However, I can see us finishing second or third in the group and we can be a tough opponent for anyone.” – Mertens_Is_Life

STRENGTHS

“Switzerland love to play in tournaments and are usually tough to beat. Giants like Spain, France and Brazil have struggled to win against us in the last few years, so don’t expect us to lose big against Germany.

“We have a solid defence with an amazing shot stopper in Sommer.” – Mertens_Is_Life

WEAKNESSES

“Since the arrival of Yakin they have lost their consistency. They struggle to create good chances in attack and without Embolo it’s going to be even more difficult to score goals.” – Mertens_Is_Life

BEST EURO 2024 FANTASY PLAYERS: SWITZERLAND

“Xherdan Shaqiri (€6.5m): He is the focal point of our attack, on nearly all set pieces and nailed. With the uncertainty of minutes in the attack, he is the only one with guaranteed minutes. Also he loves to perform at these tournaments.

“Yann Sommer (€5.0m) is a great shot stopper with an incredible season at Inter. He always turns up for the national team and has a crazy good penalty record.

“Manuel Akanji (€5.0m)/Fabian Schar (€4.5m): Another route into the defence where there are points for recoveries. Akanji also offers a decent attacking threat from set pieces, which could be important as I don’t see many goals through open play. However, if Schar is likely to start I like him more. He has better attacking threat and an outside chance of going for a penalty. But of course there is a minutes risk.” – Mertens_Is_Life

FAN’S PREDICTED LINE-UP

(3-4-2-1): Sommer; Rodriguez, Akanji, Elvedi; Widmer, Xhaka, Freuler, Ndoye; Shaqiri, Vargas; Okafor

Are Switzerland really as solid as we used to expect? A few eyebrow-raising qualifying results:
2-2 v Romania
2-2 v Kosovo
3-3 v Belarus
1 clean sheet in their final 7 qualifiers.

Thinking about this mainly from the perspective of Hungary attackers (I might have 2)

Italy are slow starters but don't let friendlies put you off - they won't be in the winning mentality until they know there is something at stake in an actual Euro 24 match.

How often can I change the captain during the matchday?! Is it just the once like the World Cup fantasy or can I do it multiple times until matchday over?! Thanks

Once per matchaday. Not per game

Everyday inside matchday one captain before matches start.

For example you have Havertz on friday and he blanks, you can switch it to Morata before kick off of first game that day.

Yes, you have 5 captains on md1, that is why balanced team is the way to go. First find yourself good 5 captains and then fill the rest.

Pick one captain per day as in Friday, Saturday, Sunday etc. Can't pick two captains on the same day as in early kickoff then change to late kickoff. So 5 captain max per round.

Please remember a ‘Matchday’ can last several days. For instance Matchday 1 runs from 14 - 18 June. You can change your captain on each of those days but only before the kick off of the first game on that day. Hope that makes sense.

Yes perfect thanks. It’s becuase on the World Cup once they capped it at 1 captain change per matchday and previously was unlimited to once per day at the tournaments before

Think Lukaku will score more than Kane so next choice is which mid , again I think Shaqiri/rodri will score more than Saka buts that's just my opinion.

Best combo from these?
A) Verbruggen, Theo Hernandes, Xhaka
B) Lunin, VVD, Jorginho

I will already have Dumfries and Xavi Simons from Holland in the team either way.
Cheers.
