Austria hold Switzerland to draw in last Euros warm-ups
ByReuters
Updated: Jun 8, 2024, 06:17 pm

Switzerland were held to a 1-1 home draw by Austria in a friendly match on Saturday as both sides concluded their warm-ups for the European Championship.

Austria got off to a lightning start thanks to attacking midfielder Christoph Baumgartner, who ran through the home defence and unleashed a shot into the bottom right corner to open the scoring within five minutes of play at St. Gallen.

Switzerland then picked up the pace and found their equaliser when right back Silvan Widmer netted from close range 21 minutes later. The second half was a much quieter affair, with neither side finding the winner.

Switzerland kick off their Euro campaign against Hungary on June 15, followed by games against Scotland and hosts Germany in Group A. Austria will face heavyweights France on June 17 before playing Poland and the Netherlands in Group D.
