Switzerland vs Austria Predictions
Switzerland vs Austria: Tactical Brilliance and Key Player Duels Set to Shape the Outcome
Key Stats

– Austria have won 12 of their last 15 matches, including four consecutive away victories.

– Switzerland have scored at least four goals in a match only once since March 2023.

– Austria’s Michael Gregoritsch has netted four goals in the Euro 2024 qualifiers, showcasing his scoring prowess.

Switzerland and Austria are set to conclude their Euro 2024 preparations with an intriguing friendly at St Gallen this Saturday evening. Both teams come into this fixture with a strong run of form, each aiming to extend their unbeaten streaks before heading to Germany for the tournament. This article delves deep into the tactical setups, expected gameplay, key player duels, and ultimately provides well-founded predictions for the match.

Switzerland’s Recent Form and Tactical Setup

During 2023, Switzerland experienced a mixed bag of results, often appearing to be in a decline under Murat Yakin. Despite ending the year with only one win in seven matches against Andorra, they had accumulated enough points early in the qualification campaign to secure their place at Euro 2024. This year, however, has seen a marked improvement in their performances.

A goalless draw against Denmark in March was followed by a hard-fought 1-0 victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. The Swiss then demolished Estonia 4-0, marking their first time scoring four goals in a match since March 2023.

Yakin’s side, known for their solid defensive organisation and disciplined midfield, have recently shown a more dynamic approach in attack. Their 3-4-3 formation often transitions into a 5-2-3 when defending, ensuring stability at the back. The possible starting lineup for this match features Mvogo in goal, backed by a defensive trio of Stergiou, Zesiger, and Elvedi. The wing-backs, Mbabu and Ndoye, are crucial for providing width, while Xhaka and Freuler will anchor the midfield. Upfront, Vargas, Amdouni, and Zuber are expected to spearhead the attack.

Austria’s Impressive Streak and Tactical Approach

Austria, under Ralf Rangnick, have been one of the standout mid-tier teams heading into Euro 2024, winning 12 of their last 15 matches, including victories against Germany, Turkey, and Serbia. They have shown resilience and tactical flexibility, often switching between a 4-2-3-1 and a 3-4-3 formation, adapting to the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents.

Austria’s probable lineup sees Pentz between the posts, with a backline comprising Lainer, Lienhart, Wober, and Prass. In midfield, Seiwald and Laimer are set to control the tempo, while the trio of Wimmer, Weimann, and Schmid will support lone striker Gregoritsch. Rangnick’s side excels in high pressing and quick transitions, making them a formidable force, especially in counter-attacking scenarios.

Key Player Duels and Field Dynamics

One of the most critical areas where this match could be decided is the midfield battle. Granit Xhaka and Remo Freuler’s ability to control the midfield for Switzerland will be tested against Austria’s dynamic duo of Seiwald and Laimer. Xhaka’s leadership and passing range are vital for Switzerland’s ball retention and transition play, while Freuler’s work rate and defensive contributions provide balance. On the other hand, Laimer’s tenacity and Seiwald’s creative spark can disrupt Switzerland’s rhythm and create scoring opportunities for Austria.

Another key duel will be on the flanks, where Switzerland’s wing-backs Mbabu and Ndoye will face Austria’s wide players Wimmer and Schmid. The success of Switzerland’s wing play and their ability to deliver crosses into the box will depend heavily on Mbabu and Ndoye winning these wide battles.

Expected Gameplay and Strategic Analysis

Switzerland are likely to adopt a cautious approach, focusing on maintaining possession and building attacks patiently from the back. Their emphasis will be on exploiting the wide areas through their wing-backs while ensuring defensive solidity with their back three. Austria, conversely, will look to impose their high-pressing game, aiming to force errors in Switzerland’s defensive third and capitalize on quick turnovers.

Switzerland’s strengths lie in their disciplined defensive structure and the experience of players like Xhaka and Freuler in midfield. However, their occasional struggle to convert possession into clear-cut chances can be a weakness, especially against a high-pressing side like Austria.

Austria’s strengths include their ability to adapt tactically and their clinical finishing in front of goal. Their potential weakness could be their defence when faced with sustained pressure, particularly if Switzerland’s wide players manage to deliver quality crosses into the box.

Managerial Tactics and Criticism

Murat Yakin has managed to stabilise Switzerland’s performances in recent months, but his conservative tactics have sometimes led to a lack of creativity in the final third. The Swiss side has been overly reliant on their midfield for both defensive and offensive duties, which can lead to fatigue and decreased effectiveness as the game progresses.

Ralf Rangnick, on the other hand, has successfully instilled a high-pressing, fast-paced style of play in the Austrian team. His tactical flexibility and ability to adapt to different opponents have been key to Austria’s impressive run. However, Rangnick’s aggressive approach can sometimes leave his team vulnerable to counter-attacks, particularly against sides capable of quick transitions.

Betting Predictions and Rationale

Best Bet: Austria to Win

Given their recent form and tactical setup, Austria appear to have the upper hand in this encounter. They have won 12 of their last 15 matches and have been particularly strong in away games, winning their last four on the road. Their high-pressing game and clinical finishing make them a formidable opponent, and Switzerland’s occasional struggles against aggressive pressing sides further tilt the balance in Austria’s favour.

Correct Score Prediction: Switzerland 1-2 Austria

Switzerland’s solid defensive setup and Austria’s attacking prowess suggest a closely contested match. However, Austria’s superior form and tactical flexibility give them the edge. Switzerland are likely to score, given their recent attacking improvements, but Austria’s ability to capitalise on defensive lapses could see them edging out a 2-1 victory.

Goalscorer Prediction: Michael Gregoritsch

Michael Gregoritsch has been in fine form for Austria, scoring four goals in the qualifiers. His role as the focal point of Austria’s attack makes him a prime candidate to score in this match. Given Switzerland’s vulnerability to quick transitions, Gregoritsch’s positioning and finishing skills will be crucial.

Corner Prediction: Total Corners Over 10.5

Both teams have shown a propensity for attacking play and generating corners. Switzerland average 5.9 corners per game, while Austria average 5.3. Considering the attacking styles of both sides, this match is likely to see a high number of corners, exceeding the 10.5 mark.

Innovative Market Prediction: Xherdan Shaqiri to Assist

Xherdan Shaqiri’s vision and passing ability make him a key playmaker for Switzerland. His knack for creating scoring opportunities, particularly from set-pieces, positions him as a likely candidate to provide an assist in this match. Given Austria’s aggressive pressing, Shaqiri’s ability to unlock defences with precise passes will be vital.
