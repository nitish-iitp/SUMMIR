Why does everyone say Foden has to start?

If he played another position he would be a sure starter, but he doesnt. He plays in the same spot as 1 of only 2 players in the squad that are better than him. There is nothing wrong with having really strong bench players

He’s never done it for England really. He got his shot at no. 10 last night and flopped.

We’re not planning on playing a system with two 10s like Pep does and a winger like Gordon naturally balances this side more while Shaw is out and the one legged Trippier is playing.

I agree, shouldn’t be a dead cert to start!

With Jude obviously having the no. 10 role on lockdown in this side* forgot to add!

You are so right UJ. Trying to shoehorn Foden into the 11 by playing him wide reminds me of the Gerrard/Lampard dilemma years ago when they were both selected but Lampard was often played out of position. Square pegs in round holes doesn’t work.

He’ll start given the season he’s had. Whether he deserves to is another story. Personally I’d start him wide left. Jude behind Kane and Saka right. A progressive mid (Trent or Wharton) partnering Rice

I’m liking my current experimental draft which is all in on attack MD1. 3x 4m defenders and 1x cheap forward to add funds in midfield. Some punts but the last round of friendlies will dictate if I stick or twist. WC in MD2 likely plan.

Almost, considering Nego over Lang if it looks like he is starting. Seems further forward.

0.5 over budget here, who would you downgrade here and to whom?

Strakosha Moldovan

Cancelo Frimpong Mittelstadt Dimarco Hernandez

Bellingham Gundogan Rodri Szobozlai Kvaratskhelia

Mbappe Kane Havertz

Saka over Bellingham and perhaps get 4.5 m keeper such as Verbruggen or Wirtz over Gundogan

You also have no Belgian players- given fixtures you might want to consider even Lukaku over Kane- based on last night’s performance can’t see England scoring too many v Serbia or Denmark!

Ronaldo instead of Kane.

Excellent, last nights result seems to make people think England are going to be awful v Serbia. That result will have given them a kick, see 3 goals easily

Hernandez to likes of Faes, Kerkez and upgrade keepers to likes of Verbruggen or Dubravka.

I think that Austria game looks a little bit tricky; it's been a couple years since anyone shut them out (although it was France who were the last to do so) and they're on quite a hot streak. So maybe Theo - Grimaldo / Dalot?

I think Slovenia and Denmark are low block teams, a system England struggle against.

Reminds me of last season when people started with Man Utd players and ignored the bad form. Rashford and Bruno were flops.

England expectation is huge but I'm not seeing alot of goals in those games.

Sounds about right. Getting gung-ho signals from Serbia so will have Kane as a captaincy option MD1 but think I'll go without England MD2 & then see how things stand / how Slovenia look for MD3
