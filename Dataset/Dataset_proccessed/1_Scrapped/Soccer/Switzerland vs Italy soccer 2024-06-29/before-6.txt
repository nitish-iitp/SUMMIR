Italy lineup vs. Switzerland: Predicted XI for Euro 2024 last-16 contest

After scraping through the Euro 2024 group stage, reigning champions Italy head for Berlin on Saturday evening, when they kick off the knockout rounds with a last-16 tie against Switzerland.

Despite putting his name in lights by netting a crucial late leveller versus Croatia, which effectively kept the Azzurri's title defence alive, Mattia Zaccagni must again battle it out with fellow forwards Giacomo Raspadori and Federico Chiesa to start in support of one main striker.

Head coach Luciano Spalletti has come under fire for his tactics and selections thus far, but he may again turn to Gianluca Scamacca - who the ex-Napoli boss openly branded 'lazy' earlier this year - for inspiration up front.

Genoa's Mateo Retegui spearheaded the Italian attack on Monday night, missing a couple of half-chances, so it remains to be seen which misfiring striker is chosen this weekend.

Spalletti will certainly make at least one change to his defensive line, with Riccardo Calafiori - who impressively set up Zaccagni's goal in Leipzig - picking up two yellow cards in three games to incur a costly suspension.

Gianluca Mancini is expected to deputise alongside Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Inter Milan duo Alessandro Bastoni and Matteo Darmian, although Torino's Alessandro Buongiorno may also come into Spalletti's thinking; Darmian is set to start on the left due to an ongoing calf problem for another Inter star, Federico Dimarco.

As experienced engine-room co-ordinator Jorginho has received widespread criticism this summer, Juventus youngster Nicolo Fagioli may now replace him.

Elsewhere in midfield, Roma teammates Bryan Cristante and Lorenzo Pellegrini could be in competition for one place - the latter's inclusion would indicate a more attacking approach.

Italy possible starting lineup: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Mancini, Bastoni, Darmian; Cristante, Fagioli, Barella; Chiesa, Scamacca, Zaccagni
