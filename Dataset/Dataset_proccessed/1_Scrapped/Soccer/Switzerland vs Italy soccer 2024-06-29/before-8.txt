Switzerland vs. Italy prediction, odds, betting tips and best bets for Euro 2024 Round of 16

Switzerland take on Italy in the first knockout game of the 2024 European Championship.

Italy qualified by finishing second in their group, only bettered by Spain who were the only side to win all three group games. 

Switzerland come into this one on the back of a monumental performance against the hosts of the tournament, Germany.

Switzerland vs. Italy prediction, odds
Moneyline lean: Tie (+195) but also Italy to qualify (-145)
Score prediction: Switzerland 1-1 Italy

While Switzerland looked incredibly good versus Germany, Italy are the reigning champions and even though they've looked vulnerable at times, their experience should get them through to the quarterfinals. 

History is also on their side as the last European Championship tournament that didn’t feature Italy in the quarterfinals was back in 2004, when they went out in the group stage.

Excluding shootouts, Switzerland have failed to win any of their seven Round of 16 matches at major international tournaments.

Last meeting: Italy 1-1 Switzerland (Nov.12, 2021 | FIFA World Cup qualifying)
Switzerland vs. Italy best bet
Pick: To go to extra time
Odds: +225 (BetMGM)

Overall, the Italian national team has played more games that have gone to extra-time (21) in World Cup and European Championship history than any other nation. Additionally, only Spain (11) has participated in more penalty shootouts than Italy (10).

Italy are an incredibly tough team to beat, with their matches frequently going to extra-time. Of their last 26 knockout games in major international tournaments, 15 have gone to extra-time, including four of their last five.

Switzerland vs. Italy prop bet
Pick: Dan Ndoye anytime goalscorer 
Odds: +350 (BetMGM)

Dan Ndoye is coming into this game fresh after putting Switzerland ahead versus Germany. His goal was a precise finish after a wonderful cross from Remo Freuler.

He consistently found space behind Germany's backline and will look to do so against Italy. 

Pick: Under 2.5 goals
Odds: -210 (FanDuel)

Knockout games are ridiculously tense and with neither side wanting to slip up, this can see few goalscoring opportunities or chances created.

Italy's record for matches heading to extra-time says it all, as previously mentioned, and Switzerland's determination will help them defensively. 

Expect it to be cagey and tight right until the final whistle.
