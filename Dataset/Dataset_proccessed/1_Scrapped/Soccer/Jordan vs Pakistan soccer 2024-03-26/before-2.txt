Jordan will attempt to get the better of Pakistan for the second game in a row when the two sides face off in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.

The hosts currently sit in third position in Group G, while the visitors are languishing at the bottom of the table without a point to their name.

Jordan made a sluggish start to their qualifying campaign, playing out a 1-1 draw against Tajikistan before losing 2-0 in their home meeting with Saudi Arabia.

However, Hussein Ammouta's side were able to build a significant amount of confidence with an impressive performance in the Asian Cup earlier this year.

After progressing from the group phase, they eliminated Iraq, Tajikistan and South Korea, before they fell to a 3-1 defeat in the final against tournament hosts Qatar.

In their first game since the final loss, Jordan eased to a 3-0 victory in Thursday's away clash with Pakistan thanks to a Mousa Al-Tamari brace and an Ali Olwan effort.

While they remained in third place, the win moved them level on four points with Tajikistan, who kept hold of second position due to their superior goal difference.

In contrast to their hosts, Pakistan had to negotiate a first-round tie against Cambodia to secure their spot in the second stage of qualifying.

After claiming a narrow 1-0 aggregate win over Cambodia, Pakistan began the second round with a 4-0 loss in their away fixture against Saudi Arabia.

They then slumped to a demoralising 6-1 home loss to Tajikistan in their final outing of 2023, before they kicked off the current calendar year with another heavy defeat in Thursday's meeting with Jordan.

Having lost their three qualifiers by a combined 13-1 scoreline, the Falcons will be eliminated with two games to play if they suffer a fourth consecutive defeat on Tuesday.

Pakistan will certainly have their work cut out to clinch all three points, having won just one of their last 17 matches (D1, L15).

After seeing his side ease to victory on Thursday, Ammouta could be tempted to select an unchanged starting lineup for Tuesday's reverse fixture.

Bara' Marie is poised to retain his place in a back three alongside Yazan Al-Arab and Salem Al-Ajalin, with the trio hoping to claim a second straight clean sheet.

At the opposite end of the pitch, Al-Tamari and Ali Owan will continue to provide support to forward Yazan Al-Naimat.

As for Pakistan, Imran Kayani is in contention to start following his appearance as a half-time substitute on Thursday.

Midfielder Harun Hamid is also pushing for a starting spot after being introduced just after the hour mark in Islamabad.

Adeel Younas, who turned 18 on Sunday, could retain his place in the side following his international debut in Thursday's defeat.


Jordan possible starting lineup:
Abulaila; Marie, Al-Arab, Al-Ajalin; Haddad, Al-Rashdan, Al-Rawabdeh, Al-Madri; Al-Tamari, Al-Naimat

Pakistan possible starting lineup:
Butt; Rao, Suliman, Iqbal, Saddam; Hamid, Ghazi, Nabi; Ullah, Younas, Kayani



We say: Jordan 4-0 Pakistan

After claiming a commanding victory in Islamabad on Thursday, we expect Jordan to produce another dominant performance in Tuesday's return meeting with the added advantage of playing on home soil.
