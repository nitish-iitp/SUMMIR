With their tournament fate hanging in the balance, the Nigerian team will be seeking to avoid defeat to advance to the Round of 16.

Head to Head Records

The Falconets of Nigeria are set to face Venezuela in their final group stage match of the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Colombia. 

This encounter marks the first meeting between the two teams in the tournament's history. Nigeria has had a mixed bag of results so far, defeating Korea Republic 1-0 and losing to Germany 3-1. 

Venezuela, on the other hand, has struggled, losing 5-2 to Germany and drawing 0-0 with Korea Republic.

Match Preview

Nigeria's Falconets have shown flashes of brilliance in their previous matches, with Flourish Sabastine's late goal against Korea Republic and Chiamaka Cristabel Okwuchukwu's equalizer against Germany being notable highlights. However, they have also struggled to maintain consistency and have conceded crucial goals. 

Venezuela, led by Floriangel Apostol's impressive free-kick against Germany, will be looking to capitalize on Nigeria's defensive vulnerabilities.

Venue and Kick-Off Time

The match is scheduled to take place at the Estadio Pascual Guerrero in Cali, Colombia, on Saturday, September 7, at 9 PM. 

The game will be broadcast live on Supersport, following the AFCON qualifier between Nigeria's Super Eagles and Benin Republic's Cheetahs.

Expectations

With the Falconets' needing to avoid defeat and their opponents needing a win to advance to the Round of 16, this encounter promises to be an intense and thrilling match. 

Nigeria's Falconets will be looking to build on their victory against Korea Republic and improve on their performance against Germany.
