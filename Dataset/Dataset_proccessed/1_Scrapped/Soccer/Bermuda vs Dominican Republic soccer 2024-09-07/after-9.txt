Crichlow And Lambe Score For Bermuda
September 7, 2024 | 0 Comments

Kane Crichlow and Reggie Lambe scored for Bermuda in today’s match against the Dominican Republic in their opening League B group D match of the Concacaf Nations League in Antigua and Barbuda, which saw the Dominican Republic claim the 3-2 win.

The Dominican Republic were reduced to ten men in the tenth minute when Edarlyn Reyes stopped a dangerous breakaway after pulling back Blaiz Hall.

In the seventeenth minute, Crichlow opened the scoring with a left-footed shot after a neat pullback by Blaiz Hall down the left channel.

The equaliser came in the 35th minute when the Dominican captain Jean López released Dorny Romero who beat the offside trap before delicately chipping the ball over the stranded Eve.

After the break, Kole Hall forced a fine save from the Dominican goalkeeper Xavier Valdez after turning and shooting with his left foot from the edge of the box.

Moments later, Lambe restored Bermuda’s lead with a deflected shot from an angle inside the area.

At the other end, Eve saved well with his legs after livewire Romero had broken free of the Bermuda backline.

Kole Hall was offering Bermuda a launchpad as the lone striker and rattled the woodwork with a powerful left-footed effort on the hour mark.

However, the Dominican Republic levelled a minute later through Mörschel after a misjudged pass by Chikosi Basden.

The Dominican Republic threatened again through Ronaldo Vásquez but Eve was equal to it with a superb one-handed diving save.

Vasquez found the winner in the 83rd minute to give his side the lead with a close-range finish after good work by Romero.

Bermuda take on host nation Antigua and Barbuda on Tuesday.
