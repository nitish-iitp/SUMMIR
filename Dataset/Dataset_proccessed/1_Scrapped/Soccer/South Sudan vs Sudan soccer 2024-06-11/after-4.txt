South Sudan and Sudan will trade tackles in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Tuesday. The hosts are coming into the game on the back of a 1-1 draw away to Togo last week.

They went behind to Khaled Narey's strike just past the hour-mark but drew level through Roger Aholou's own goal seven minutes later.

Sudan, meanwhile, claimed maximum points with a routine 2-0 away victory over Mauritania. Saifeldin Bakhit broke the deadlock in the 15th minute while Aly Abeid scored an unfortunate own goal in the 29th minute.

The win saw The Secretarybirds climb to the summit of Group B, having garnered seven points from three games. South Sudan are fifth on two points.

South Sudan vs Sudan Prediction

South Sudan have drawn their last four games on the bounce and will be looking to get back to winning ways in a high-stakes game.

Sudan have overcome political instability to emerge as one of the surprise packages in the World Cup qualifiers. They currently hold a two-point advantage at the summit ahead of heavyweights Senegal. Another victory here would further solidify their grip on top spot as they seek qualification for a maiden World Cup. James Kwesi Appiah's side will go all out for the victory.

More than three points are at stake when these two sides take to the field. There is a long political history between the two nations and neither team would want to lose the game. Sudan are the favorites and the more in-form side. We are backing the visitors to claim a narrow win in addition to a clean sheet.

Prediction: South Sudan 0-1 Sudan
