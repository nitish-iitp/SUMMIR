'Strange' night for Clarke
published at 22:31 Greenwich Mean Time 22 March
22:31 GMT 22 March

FT: Netherlands 4-0 Scotland

Scotland boss Steve Clarke tells BBC Scotland: "It's a strange one. Obviously sore, losing 4-0 you can't really dress it up, it was painful.

"For 70 minutes it was really good then we concede a poor second goal. The biggest difference between the sides was clinical finishing. We created a lot against a good side.

"It is one to go away and digest but not get too emotional. The lads are disappointed with the way the game turned out, I am disappointed with the way the game turned out.

"There are plenty of positives but straight after the game you tend to forget about the positives. The scoreline is sore. We allowed the game to become too open, it suited the Netherlands more than it suited us and we paid for it.

"Lawrence can be pleased with his contribution. He's a striker he wants to score goals. He only had one big chance in the game and normally you'd expect Lawrence to score it but there will be another day.

"I have got to clear my head. I had an idea in mind what I might do on Tuesday night but the game tonight might have just changed that."

Well, it's safe to say the next three games will present a slightly easier challenge than Scotland have faced in the last few matches.

It doesn't get much tougher than England, France, Netherlands.

It's Northern Ireland up next, on Tuesday at Hampden. Then it's Gibraltar and Finland in June.

A chance to rebuild some momentum after a six-game winless run.

'Unbelievable' Scotland didn't score - Koeman
published at 22:18 Greenwich Mean Time 22 March
22:18 GMT 22 March

FT: Netherlands 4-0 Scotland

Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman tells Viaplay: "We know we can create a lot of good chances.

"During the first hour the Scottish team were the better team, they created more chances to score, it was a little bit unbelievable that they didn't score because they had so many chances.

"I think we need to play better football. we had many mistakes and we have to do that better in Germany.

"We knew before that Scotland would fight, they are a really aggressive team with good players like John McGinn who played very well tonight."

I think when Souttar came on and Tierney went off it disrupted things. I've seen the replay of the second goal and Souttar is uncertain about the man at the back post.

But he wasn't the danger man he's got to realise the danger and get goal side.

He tries but he's too late. That wasn't long after the change.

More from Scotland captain Andy Robertson's interview on Viaplay: "When you go to major tournaments then you have to be a lot better than that.

"If you do get beat, you have to keep your goal difference down. We do not want to be the team that just qualifies for tournaments, we want to be competing.

"We have to get back to winning ways and it needs to start quickly.

"Today we tried to treat it like a rehearsal for the Euros and for large parts we did well but the game is over 90 minutes.

"We have got the energy, it is not as if we tired, we kept the ball really well and we just switched off. In a game we played well we could have walked off at 6-0."

Scotland captain Andy Robertson tells Viaplay: "You can't come away to these big teams and play the way we did. We have to take heart from the 60, 70 minutes but the last 20 minutes is not how we want to play.

"The fact that we have walked off that pitch 4-0 is unbelievable. We can't keep doing this, going into our old ways against the big teams. There is no way we can play like that because people will look at that result and think it is very one sided.

"You go 1-0 down to a wonder strike but we didn't panic, started the second half extremely well, had some great chances. At this level it is all about putting the ball in the back of the net.

"Lads can miss chances but what we can't do is open up as what we did. That is a collective thing, all of us can change that and sort it out."

'Shankland can play in this team'

FT: Netherlands 4-0 Scotland

James McFadden
Former Scotland forward on Sportsound

I thought Shankland's overall play was excellent and we looked better when he was on because he held his position and brought others into play.

He gets his chance, he doesn't snatch at it or look tense. He knows what he's trying to do.

If anything he was trying to be too precise by putting it right in the top corner. Then you run the risk of slightly overhitting it.

But he showed in his all round play he can play in this team. Sometimes you don't get another chance at this level and he has to score.

But I'd back him to bounce back.

'We have to be more streetwise'

FT: Netherlands 4-0 Scotland

Scotland midfielder John McGinn tells Viaplay: "We're all experienced players now, most of us are playing in European football.

"We had good chances, one of them has got to go in.

"We have got to be more streetwise when it goes to 2-0, shut up shop a little bit more. And that's the thing that hurts the most.

"I think over the piece we can take positives in the sense that we didn't feel the Netherlands were a million miles away from us.

"Those last 20 minutes of the game are not something we'll look back fondly on.

"Tonight up until a certain point was one of our best away performances that' I've experienced but it doesn't feel that way. They will be in the dressing room wondering how they've scored so many

"It has happened to us too many times in the past and we had been changing that.

"I thought Lawrence Shankland was outstanding, it is not easy playing against Virgil Van Dijk.

"I think the goals will always come when you are a player like him and we are all proud of him

"The chances will come and the next one will be in the back of the net."

I think Steve Clarke will be concerned, even if he doesn't say it. Scotland have played a lot of brilliant teams with loads of firepower recently.

But they've conceded a bucket loads of goals.

Confusing night

A real head-scratcher that. Does it sound a bit crazy to say that's some of the best football Scotland have played in years?

When Billy Gilmour and Kieran Tierney went off they seemed to struggle. And the defending late on was pretty shocking.

Confusing stuff for Scotland fans!

The whole performance is destroyed with the second and third goals. These are goals that just shouldn't have happened.

These goals turned what was a magnificent performance into a performance to be depressed about.

I hope Scotland can learn from it.

We are talking about taking these games to build confidence, to give you practice for going into the tournament.

A 4-0 defeat, it is very hard to take the positives required going into a massive tournament.

FULL-TIME - Netherlands 4-0 Scotland
published at 21:41 Greenwich Mean Time 22 March

That's it in Amsterdam. What was looking like a positive night for Scotland for 70 minutes, turned a bit sour in the final quarter.

Yes Tijjani Reijnders smashed the Dutch in front before the break, but Scotland had so many chances and hit the woodwork twice.

However, after Gini Wijnaldum headed in Netherlands' second goal they started to enjoy themselves.

Wout Weghorst and Donyell Malen added the gloss. A tough one for Scotland to take. A real lesson in taking your chances.

Just thinking about that Lawrence Shankland chance at 1-0. Honestly, he usually rolls those into the net.

He lifted it a tad too high and it crashed off the bar. A real turning point. As were the subs from both sides.

A chance for the fifth goal for the Dutch. Donyell Malen picks out Teun Koopmeiners witha beautiful cross, but the first-time finish flies over.

An average of three a game. Top class opposition have found it a bit too easy against Scotland at times.
