Kuwait host Afghanistan on Tuesday

Kuwait welcome Afghanistan to the Sabah Al Salem Stadium for a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Tuesday. The home side are coming off a goalless draw away to India on Thursday.

Afghanistan, meanwhile, also played out a goalless draw at home to Qatar on the same day.

The draw left The Lions of Khorasan in third spot in Group A, having garnered five points from as many games. Kuwait are bottom of the standings on four points.

Kuwait vs Afghanistan Prediction

Kuwait ended their four-game losing streak with their draw last week. However, they are still in the running for progression to the next round of the qualifiers. The sole win they have managed in the qualifiers so far came in the reverse fixture but they have not won a game since then.

Afghanistan are just one point better off than their hosts and will be seeking revenge for the bashing they received at their hands last year. Ashley Westwood's side are unbeaten in three games since that wallopping and will be keen to keep this run going.

Qatar have already booked their spot in the next round of the qualifiers as group winners. However, second spot in the group is still up for grabs, with just one point separating second-placed India from fourth-placed Kuwait. The winner of this game would advance to the next round if India fail to beat Qatar.

There is a lot on the line and we are unlikely to witness a repeat of the goal-fest that played out in the reverse fixture. We are backing the two sides to cancel each other out in a goalless stalemate.

Prediction: Kuwait 0-0 Afghanistan
