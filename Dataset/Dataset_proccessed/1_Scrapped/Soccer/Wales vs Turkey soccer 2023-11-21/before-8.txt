How Wales can qualify for Euro 2024

Wales can still qualify automatically from Group D, but their fate now largely depends on results elsewhere.

Winning against Turkey is now a must, but Wales will also have to hope that Croatia drop points against Latvia and Armenia.

Should Croatia beat Latvia in the late game on Saturday, Wales would have to beat Turkey on Tuesday, and hope Luka Modric and co don't beat Armenia.

In all likelihood, Wales will now surely have to rely on the play-offs to reach Germany.

Page's men are more or less guaranteed a play-off spot as the majority of the 15 teams ranked higher than them in the Nations League are all currently on course to qualify automatically.

The 12 best-ranked teams who fail to finish in the top two of their groups are set to compete in the play-offs, with three of the 24 places at next summer's tournament up for grabs.

The play-offs are pencilled in for March 21 and 26, 2024. The line-up will be determined by a series of draws. In total, there will be six semi-finals on March 21 and three finals on March 26, with the three winning teams in those games completing the 24-team finals line-up.
