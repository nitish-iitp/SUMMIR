That's it from us... until March

FT: Wales 1-1 Turkey

So that's it from us for tonight and indeed, the entire Euro 2024 qualifying campaign.

Wales when they've been good - at home to Croatia and in the first half tonight - have been absolutely outstanding, as good as I can remember them playing in 19 years of covering them.

But the rest of the campaign? It's been bad. As high as the ceiling has been, the floor has been low.

Now we move on to the unpredictability of the play-offs.

A Uefa draw on Thursday will decide whether it is Finland, Ukraine or Iceland that Wales will face in a single leg semi-final in Cardiff on Thursday, 21 March.

The final would be five days later, with the hosts also decided by a draw.

If Wales win their semi-final, they would play Estonia or Poland.

So all we know for sure is that there is still a long way to go for Wales.

Thank you for following along with us tonight and indeed, throughout the campaign.

It really is a pleasure to share the experience with football fans across the globe.

See you soon.

Wales will have to navigate the play-offs in March to reach Euro 2024 after missing out on automatic qualification following a fiery draw at home to Turkey.

I do [think Rob Page will stay], absolutely. I think he's got a right to be very upset with decisions tonight.

It's been an inconsistent qualifying campaign but there have been some good performances, Croatia being the highlight.

Expectation has risen among fans and we put in a really flat performance in Armenia.

That consistency is what Rob is going to look for.

They've got another chance, that's the best way to describe it.

We took advantage of the play-offs to reach the World Cup.

The players know what to expect, they've had the experience before, and I think that's a good thing for the dressing room.

I think the Armenia defeat is the standout result of this qualifying campaign, in a negative fashion.

The two games against Armenia, you should be winning at least one of them.

You can look at those two performances and say that's probably where it was lost because we did something special in Croatia and beat them hands down with a fantastic performance at home.

Page confident over play-offs

Wales manager Rob Page told S4C: "We're disappointed, but I've said to the players, Ben [Davies] said it in the huddle on the pitch, we put in a great performance.

"I've got to be careful what I say, we could've had two penalties and it seemed like a soft penalty. Sometimes it goes for you, sometimes it doesn't.

"That level of performance is what we need to do. If we do that when we come back together in March we'll be okay.

"I said before the game, to come into this camp still in with a chance of qualification is an incredible achievement.

"We're disappointed we haven't qualified automatically, but I'm off tomorrow to find out who we've got in the draw for the play-off.

"We'll get together in March and build on what we saw tonight, and against Croatia."

I'm looking at this game and it's a reflection of the campaign.

Just a lack of consistency. Very good for about 35 minutes but, second half, we just didn't turn up.

We were just so flat and slow. The passing wasn't there.

It's a one-off, a game we have to win. It's as simple as that.

I wouldn't say I have a preference in there.

In the last three games, two very positive performances and one iffy performance.

We've got to find that consistency.

Wales captain Ben Davies told S4C: "It's hard to take.

"The one [penalty] they got, there wasn't a lot in it. But I can't say much on camera now.

"I think we need to keep the standards we showed tonight. We'll have to pick ourselves up and go again."

I think Wales had the better opportunities.

Overall as a campaign it's been frustrating, but despite a couple of really disappointing performances, there have been glimpses.

Going into the play-offs, if they can step it up then you don't know what can happen.

First half you'd say Wales were much the better team, a great goal as well.

Second half, Turkey were the better team and got back on level terms through a poor refereeing decision, for me.

I think they gave a good account of themselves tonight. This was more the type of performance I was expecting to see in Armenia, although they couldn't sustain it over 90 minutes.

Kath Morgan

We can only blame ourselves that we didn't perform well enough in games.

This was a game of two halves.

The gaps between the units were just too big in the end and you can probably argue a draw is a fair result.

It's not over, we've got the play-offs.

But is Noel Mooney going to give Rob Page the chance in March in the play-offs?

That's the big question, there's been talk that he's been looking for a new manager just in case we don't make the Euros.

We might not know the answer for a few weeks.

Wales a couple of minutes behind that game.

We wait to see how much time the referee will add on.

I have a feeling we will be talking about the referee after the game.
