England earned the right to be a top seed for the Euro 2024 draw | Football Digest

Wales' 1-1 draw with Turkey in their Euro 2024 qualification campaign ended in chaos as a mass brawl ensued when the full-time whistle blew in Cardiff. The Welsh players were incensed that several refereeing decisions appeared to go against them, as Brennan Johnson saw two penalty claims turned down before the visitors were awarded a spot-kick of their own.

In the first half, Johnson appealed for two penalty decisions that were waved away. The second in particular saw the Spurs forward seemingly pushed over inside the box following a corner, but his appeals were made in vein after Neco Williams had given the hosts with a stunning curling effort from the edge of the area after seven minutes.

The visitors were given a golden opportunity to equalise, however, after Davies was adjudged to have fouled substitute Kenan Yildiz by pushing him in the back when the teenager chased a cross into the area. Their penalty was duly despatched by Yusuf Yazici.

"It's hard to take," Davies told S4C. "The one [penalty] they got, there wasn't a lot in it. But I can't say much on camera now. I think we need to keep the standards we showed tonight. We'll have to pick ourselves up and go again."

While former Wales striker Robbie Earnshaw blasted the refereeing on display. "I'm bemused. For me, this is weak. He's dived pretty much," he told Sky Sports when reacting to Turkey's penalty.

"The three that Wales had turned down looked way more penalty than this. Unbelievable. He's literally just nudged him, a weak, weak penalty. Devastating bow as Wales looked solid, this is a very bad decision, very weak. That is very, very poor."
