EURO QUALIFYING
WALES 1-1 TURKEY - WALES FORCED TO SETTLE FOR PLAY-OFFS AFTER DRAW WITH TURKEY AND WIN FOR CROATIA
BYDANIEL HARRIS

UPDATED 21/11/2023 AT 22:44 GMT

Wales will be forced to go into the play-offs to qualify for UEFA Euro 2024 as they had to settle for a 1-1 draw with Turkey on Tuesday. Elsewhere in the group Croatia beat Armenia 1-0 to ensure that the 2018 World Cup finalists secured the final qualification spot. Wales will now have to go through the play-offs route to try to earn their place in the finals in Germany next summer.

Wales will have to qualify through the play-offs if they are to reach UEFA Euro 2024 following a 1-1 draw against Turkey on Tuesday.
The result means that they finished third in Group D, with Croatia and already-qualified Turkey sealing the automatic qualification spots.

Turkey clawed a goal back from the penalty spot through Yusuf Yazici in the 70th minute after Ben Davies shoved Kenan Yildiz to the floor.
Brandon Williams thought he’d put Wales back in front late on when he dinked the ball over Ugurcan Cakir, but the assistant referee quickly raised his flag for offside.
Wales will play for a spot in Germany next year in the qualification play-offs in March.
With Wales needing a win against Turkey and Croatia to drop points at home to Armenia, it was always going to be a tough ask for Rob Page’s side to wrap up qualification in the final group game.
Things couldn't have started better for Wales when Neco Williams lifted the roof off the Cardiff City Stadium with a wonderful goal.
He received the ball on the left, cut in onto his stronger right foot and curled a low effort across Cakir and into the far corner.
After a largely positive first half for Wales, they had three penalty appeals turned down as frustration began to grow.
News then filtered through just before the break that Ante Budimir had put Croatia into the lead against Armenia.
And things got tougher for Wales. Turkey came out in the second half with their tails up and applied lots of pressure on Danny Ward’s goal.
Ward made a fantastic stop to deny a Samet Akaydin header from point-blank range, but the visitors’ persistence would eventually pay off.
In a nervy moment, Ben Davies shoved Yildiz to the floor as a Turkey cross floated into the box and the referee gave no hesitation and pointed to the spot.
Yazici sent Ward the wrong way the level the score and double Wales’ problems.
Brandon Williams found the net with a lovely dinked finish from a tight angle late on as the Cardiff stadium began to erupt, but celebrations were quickly cut short when the assistant referee raised his flag.
Turkey managed to hold on for the draw while Croatia sealed a 1-0 win in Zagreb as the long road to Germany was confirmed for Wales.
TALKING POINT - NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM FOR WALES
It isn’t all doom and gloom for Wales, who will have another crack at the whip for a spot in Germany when they play for a place at the tournament in March’s play-offs.
The fans, however, have every right to be disappointed because although it was out of their hands in the end, their team couldn’t do their part by capping qualification off with a win.
Wales were the superior team in the first half and despite having the advantage, couldn’t show the same levels in the second to see the game out on a frustrating night in Cardiff.
It remains to be seen whether Rob Page will be in charge in four months’ time, but one thing is certain - Wales will find out who they’ll come up against in the play-offs on Thursday.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - HARRY WILSON (WALES)
The Welsh fans were perplexed by the decision to take Wilson off with 10 minutes to go when Wales needed a goal, and understandably so.
Wilson looked bright throughout the game and produced an excellent assist for Neco Williams to strike the hosts ahead.
He created the most chances in the match and also drew the most fouls, which shows just how difficult he was to handle.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
5’ - GOOD WORK FROM BROADHEAD - He seizes onto a loose pass and bursts forward, weaving inside before producing a curled effort which Cakir saves easily enough
7’ - GOAL! WALES 1-0 TURKEY (WILLIAMS): This is a lovely goal. Wilson receives a pass from Roberts, takes a terrific touch and turns his man before feeding a quick ball out to Williams on the left. He cuts inside onto his stronger foot, then arcs a fine low curler across Cakir and into the far corner!
57’ - BIG SAVE! Turkey have a corner and Ward denies a Samet Akaydin header from point-blank range! How crucial could that turn out to be?
68’ - PENALTY TO TURKEY! Oh no… Ben Davies shoves Yildiz to the floor as a Turkey cross floats into the box and the referee points to the spot. Davies is booked for the challenge.
70’ - GOAL!! WALES 1-1 TURKEY (YAZICI PENALTY): Yazici converts from the spot and Wales have work to do! It's 1-1.
74’ - WHAT A HIT! Sari cuts in from the right onto his left foot and sends a shot from long-range fizzing past the top left corner. That could have been a Puskas contender if it found its way past Ward. It was inches away!
84’ - WALES HAVE THE BALL IN THE NET! But the assistant referee has his flag up! The Spurs forward is played through on goal and he dinks the ball over Cakir from a tight angle, but celebrations are quickly cut short.
KEY STATS
Wales are unbeaten in their four previous home games against Türkiye (W2 D2). This was the first time they played on Welsh soil since December 1996 - a goalless draw in a World Cup qualifier - and only the third meeting this century.
Turkey have avoided defeat in just three of their 14 away internationals against home nations (Wales, England, Northern Ireland – never faced Scotland away from home).
