Yellow card for Vinícius Júnior

07': Colombia 0, Brazil 0

The match started off with a lot of contact on both sides, and Brazil's Vinícius Júnior received a yellow card early in the first half, which gave Colombia a free kick.

Júnior had previously received a yellow card in the team's last game against Paraguay, which means he will miss Brazil's next matchup.
