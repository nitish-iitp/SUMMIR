Brazil player ratings vs Colombia: Raphinha rescues stagnant Selecao but Vinicius Jr shockingly suspended for Copa America knockouts

Brazil vs Colombia

A silly foul from the Real Madrid star will deprive the Selecao of their talisman heading into the quarterfinal clash against Uruguay

In tournament soccer, all that truly matters is the result. It can be ugly, it can be physical and it can be uneventful - but if you get a result, it supersedes everything else.

That sums up Brazil's Copa America 2024 thus far. It hasn't been beautiful, but they've got the job done. They're through to the knockout rounds of the tournament, securing a clash with Uruguay in the quarterfinals.

Colombia, meanwhile, remain simply sensational. They are playing some of the best soccer across all teams competing in Copa America. James Rodriguez clearly spoke with Father Time and they made a deal that the 2016 version of the player at Real Madrid would be allowed to feature during this tournament.

And there's zero reason as to why they shouldn't be seen as favorites to claim the title at this point - that's what happens when you go 26 matches unbeaten.

Brazil and Colombia battled to a 1-1 draw Tuesday night in the final group-stage match, with a sensational direct free kick from Raphinha securing the Selecao a point. The Barcelona winger opened the scoring just 12 minutes into the game, but Brazil stagnated for the 78 minutes that followed.

Los Cafeteros equalized just before the halftime whistle, and that told the story. With the point, Colombia topped the group, and Brazil secured second place, with both teams advancing further in the tournament.

The match didn't come without setbacks, though. Most importantly, the Selecao will be without superstar attacker Vinicius Jr against La Celeste in the quarterfinals. The Real Madrid winger picked up his second yellow card of the group stage and, as a result, will now be suspended.

Midfielders Bruno Guimaraes and Joao Gomes were also given yellows during a match that had a total of 33 fouls. That said, it doesn't always need to be pretty and both sides will feel it's a case of job done. Now it's time to focus on the knockouts.

GOAL rates Brazil's players from Levi Stadium.

Goalkeeper & Defence

Alisson (6/10):

Will be frustrated to have been beaten by a free kick, but it was a sensational hit. Not much he could do about it.

Danilo (6/10):

Continues to underwhelm in transition, but was defensively sound.

Marquinhos (7/10):

Vintage performance from the Selecao veteran. Was untouchable defensively and acted as a wall for the back line.

Eder Militao (6/10):

Did his job, but didn't truly stand out. Not a bad showing by any means, though.

Wendell (6/10):

Often found himself on the wrong end of a pass. Not a great showing.

Midfield

Bruno Guimaraes (7/10):

Solid as usual in the center of the pitch. Ran the show, but picked up an unnecessary yellow.

Joao Gomes (6/10):

Continues to impress and show why Dorival is selecting him ahead of others. Sloppy yellow in the first half, though.

Lucas Paqueta (4/10):

Subbed off at halftime. Completely ineffective.

Attack

Raphinha (8/10):

Stunning free kick and a menace all evening. Showed why he deserves to be in the XI.

Rodrygo (5/10):

Once again: he's not a striker, and Dorival should stop playing him there. Not a good showing, but he's out of position. Has been a theme in this tournament.

Vinicius Jr. (5/10):

Suspended for the quarterfinals vs Uruguay after picking up his second yellow of the tournament. Sloppy from Brazil's leader. Could be a significant blow.

Subs & Manager

Savio (6/10):

Didn't bring that spark like he did on matchday one.

Ederson (6/10):

Made his Selecao debut in the tournament. Congrats to the kid, but he didn't bring much to the pitch.

Andreas Pereira (5/10):

Did absolutely nothing to help them in the second half.

Endrick (N/A):

Subbed on late.

Dorival Junior (5/10):

It was fine. Set pieces can truly win you games, and Raphinha's free kick was sensational. However, their attack was once again lifeless beyond that moment. It's disappointing given the amount of talent they have.
