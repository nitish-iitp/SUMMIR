Vanuatu has caused a huge upset in beating New Zealand 4-2 in the final match of round three at Hindmarsh Stadium 

Vanuatu led 1-0 at the break courtesy of a brilliant goal from midfield general Seimata Chillia. 

The All Whites hit back with a goal to replacement striker Vaughan Coveny after the break. But Vanuatu stole the lead back through defender Lexa Bula Bibi who through the middle to follow through a Chillia pass. 

Vanuatu extended the lead to 3-1 when Jean Maleb struck in the 72nd minute but Coveny kept his team in touch with his second goal not long after to make the score 3-2. 

But rather than caving in under the pressure of the last quarter, Vanuatu hung on and were rewarded when Alphose Qorig scored the winner four minutes from the end. The 4-2 winning margin confirmed the result as a historic victory for the island nation over Oceania’s second ranked nation.
