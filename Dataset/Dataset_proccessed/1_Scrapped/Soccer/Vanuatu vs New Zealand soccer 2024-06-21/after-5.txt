All Whites soar as Vanuatu falls: New Zealand’s dominant 4-0 victory crushes local hopes at OFC Nations Cup

New Zealand clinched the top spot in Group A of the OFC Men’s Nations Cup with an emphatic 4-0 victory over Vanuatu at the VFF Freshwater Stadium in Port Vila. The match, attended by a spirited crowd of nearly 10,000, highlighted New Zealand’s dominance and resilience despite a spirited challenge from the home side.

Vanuatu faced an uphill battle, having only once defeated New Zealand in their previous nine encounters—a memorable 4-2 victory in the 2004 OFC Men’s Nations Cup. The youthful and enthusiastic home crowd, many of whom were not born during that historic win, packed the stadium, with ticket sales boosted by free entry for children under 12.

Both teams had already secured their spots in the semi-finals, allowing New Zealand Coach Darren Bazeley to rotate his squad. Goalkeeper Max Crocombe replaced Alex Paulsen, and striker Max Mata came in for Ben Waine. Captain Liberato Cacace also returned to the starting eleven after serving a suspension. Vanuatu, coached by Juliano Schmeling, fielded their strongest lineup, with Michel Coulon replacing the injured Tasso Jeffrey.

Vanuatu’s Alex Saniel ignited early excitement with a powerful shot that forced a save from Crocombe. However, New Zealand quickly subdued the home crowd when Elijah Just’s precise cross found Max Mata, who headed in his first senior international goal just before the ten-minute mark. Mata continued to pose a threat, scoring the second in the 26th minute, albeit with an assist from an unfortunate deflection off Vanuatu captain Brian Kaltak that was awarded as an own goal from the Central Coast Mariners defender.

Despite some promising attacks from Vanuatu, including a near-goal by Bong Kalo, New Zealand’s defense, led by Finn Surman and Tyler Bindon, held firm. The Kiwis could have extended their lead further, but efforts from Mata and Kosta Barbarouses were thwarted by the crossbar and offside rulings.

The second half saw a determined Vanuatu pushing hard, with Johnathan Spokeyjack almost scoring immediately after the restart. However, New Zealand’s tactical discipline and defensive solidity, exemplified by Crocombe’s crucial saves, kept Vanuatu at bay. The physicality of the match increased, resulting in a yellow card for Bindon following an off-the-ball incident.

Elijah Just then cemented New Zealand’s dominance with a spectacular long-range goal in the 63rd minute, effectively ending Vanuatu’s comeback hopes. Just continued his impressive performance by assisting Ben Old, who netted his first international goal, leading to an early departure of disheartened Vanuatu fans.

Despite the heavy defeat, Vanuatu can take pride in their performance and look forward to their semi-final clash against the winner of Group B. New Zealand, with two wins in two games, showcased their depth and strategic flexibility, setting a strong precedent as they advance in the tournament. The comprehensive win underscored New Zealand’s status as a powerhouse in the OFC Men’s Nations Cup, while Vanuatu’s spirited effort highlighted their potential and passion, promising an exciting semi-final encounter ahead.
