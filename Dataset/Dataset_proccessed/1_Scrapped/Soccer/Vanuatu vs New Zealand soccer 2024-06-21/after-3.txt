A 61-year-old former law enforcer and football fan, Michel Juliano Buleban, shared his high hopes for the Vanuatu national team’s chances of winning the OFC Nations Cup, aiming to repeat the historic victory over the All Whites in Adelaide, Australia, back in 2004.

Buleban, who has preserved a newspaper article from the Daily Post for 20 years, showed a photo of former national player Lexa Bule Bibi on his knees celebrating one of the four goals that led Vanuatu to triumph that day.
