It doesn't have to match exactly. It can be several shades of brown as long as they shades blend.

If it were my preference I would leave it factory and pocket the savings. I think it would look better anyways.

Optic is fde from nightforce and cerakote is figured in the price of the build. Wouldn't matter if it was black or some shade of brown or bronze. If the optic was black, then I would probably make the action and barrel black.

Sometimes colors are better off being complimentary whilst intentionally not matching, rather than looking like they should match but don’t.

I think a darker brown like Patriot, or even a dark green like MilSpec or ODG would tie the optic and the stock colors together quite nicely.

Main colors I have been looking at are midnight bronze, burnt bronze, Barrett Bronze, or possible vortex bronze. They should have the swatches of these 4 in about a week to compare with the scope and stock.

I’d personally take straight BB of your list, but it’s just an opinion. Vortex/Midnight/Smoked Bronze would all look better imo. No real wrong decision.

That's kinda what Altus said so far. Burnt Bronze has a bit too much pearl in it or metallic shimmer. If that's the case I would agree.

I'd go with a few shades darker than your scope and do it all in that color.

They’re all full metallics, just the Burnt will be the loudest. TBH I’ve used that much BB in the last few years I’m kinda burned out on it haha.

Altus said in person they think the Barrett bronze matches the stock a bit better. In person they said the Barrett has a bit of red that shines through a bit. The midnight bronze does match the optic a little better.

You didn't get a burnt swatch? It'd match the area under the receiver cutout near perfectly- unless it's lighting/angle making that area look like a different color than the area behind the bolt handle.

No. It was suggested that burnt bronze would be too metalic and not go well.

A real man chooses pink and green every time. A smart man chooses black and Flat Dark Earth. I prefer red, but the Tiger Stipe on my GT really caught my eye without being super flashy.

When I built my Vudoo I was having a hard time deciding if I wanted Blue with black accents or red with black accents. I really prefer red, but never had a blue firearm, so after much head scratching, I went with the Red. It stands out. After it arrived, when discussing colors with Brenda, I learned she hates blue. Guess I chose right for once (and she always complained about my IHMSA Stocks painted red….So, go figure. All that said, she’s a shooter and she likes FDE and black, so her rebuilt RPR is FDE and black and she loves it.

My choices. If not mistaken, midnight bronze is the base color of the MPA Tiger Stripe



Her Choice

I still think Smoked Bronze is a solid choice to consider.

I think smoked bronze is lighter than I wanted to go with. It's closer to sand or lighter fde.

Fair, I think it’d look sharp though. Out of all the newer colors it’s definitely one of my favs.

Altus just sent me pics of my rifle. Just need to get the custom foam cut for the case and it should be headed my way.
