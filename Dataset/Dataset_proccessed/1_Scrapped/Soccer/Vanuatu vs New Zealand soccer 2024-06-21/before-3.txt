After some feedback on what people are using . Mounts has to have at least 20moa of cant available . Fixed or QD doesn't matter.

In all the years i have been using Sphur , primarily.... I also have Era -Tac and they have been fantastic but here in Aus obtaining them is very very difficult..

Any input and recommendations appreciated..

I really like the MDT with the stepped cap interface but then I tried a couple ARC mounts and the singe bolt makes that basically obsolete, currently the ARC M-Brace is my go to

Moved to ARC M-Brace after a few cracked Spuhr clamps.

Mile High shooting will replace the Spuhr clamp free of charge. But I'd rather not deal with the hassle or find a cracked clamp when pulling a rifle out of the safe.

Received a Audere Adversus Gen 2 mount with the purchase of a Zeiss S3 from MK Machining. No issues with it. Audere is not a very well known brand out of San Marino. Or perhaps I should say that I had never heard of them. Several different heights, diameters, cants and colors are available.

I went with the ARC M-Brace on my last two rifles.
They are super strong and precisely built; I like them a lot.

I use one Spuhr for looks and own two Arc Mbrace. Love the Mbrace. So easy.

But I have been thinking about buying a Near Manufacturing Alphamount with the Spuhr accessories compatible ring cap.


Reg ring caps



Richard, the owner, can make you whatever you want. He’s some genius machinist/designer. I own some of his Rem700 bases and they are amazing. He loves TRG’s.

One thing he’s not is a web designer or e-commerce wizard. He runs two sites (below). Call him, trust me, call and don’t email. He loves to chat and ships fast.

Spuhr for years.

But the new hotness is GrayOps. Next Tangent will sit in a GrayOps.

I have NF, M Brace, Audere, and an A419. All have been non-issue. Love the top single screw hinge on the mbrace, it'll never twist your scope off cant when torquing the rings.

I have used MDT, MPA, Warne, Spuhr and ARC mounts on my rifles over the years. The Spuhr is nice but more expensive than it needs to be. I really like the ARC after trying my first one and the ease of the single screw clamping system. Bottom line is all have worked and held the scope securely. I want to try a Seekins next as it looks interesting with the rail wedge.

OP don't get a QD.

ARC M-10 mounts are all I use anymore just make sure the hinge pins are centered before you clamp the ring screw down.

Imo all mounts do the same job, hold your scope securely. I haven't had a need to add any accessories so that doesn't play a factor for me but might for some. It seems like most agree the easy mounting of the ARC just makes life that much easier. The MDT works well also but single screw is titties

Same here. I have several Spuhrs, and an Audere that was rebranded for "Hoplite" arms (now that was a train wreck), and have recently gotten an M-Brace. I'll be moving to M-Brace from here on out.

The key discriminator is the ease of set up. With the single screw through the top of the rings, once the scope is leveled, it doesn't move as you tighten down the ring.

The Spurh's wedge thing helps, but it still nowhere as easy as the M-Brace. And the wedge doesn't work on scopes with wide turret knobs, unless you grind the point off. AMHIK

I used spuhr exclusively for about 12 years, but after dealing with 5 cracked clamp bars between 11 Spuhr mounts over that time period I switched them all out to ARC M Brace on the guns that didn't need cantilever mounts and badger C1 on those that needed a cantilever mount. (Before the thread sidetracks about my 45% failure rate with spuhr, I was not adding lube to the hardware and my mountz torque drivers get checked 3-4 times a year in the NIST-traceable calibration lab at work, so it's not user error or a crappy out of spec torque driver overtightening the hardware.)

Happy with both the ARC and badger mounts, although I wish the badger C1 cantilever mounts had the clamp bar and low profile clamp hardware from the non-cantilever C1 max mounts instead of the smaller individual clamps and protruding nuts.

One negative to the ARC mounts is that if your scope has a very low profile elevation turret, the thicker top of the ARC rings can block your view of the turret and the alignment hash mark when behind the rifle. Some aren't happy that ARC doesn't offer any accessories for them yet (offset red dot mounts, etc) but for me that's not an issue. Also, their LRF mount is really stout and doesn't impart any additional load into the front ring cap or scope tube (unlike pretty much every other LRF mount out there.)

While I haven't used any yet, the gray ops, A419, MPA, Audere, Era Tac, Near, Tier 1, Hawkins, MDT, and the new Seekins mounts all look good as well.

I've been back and forth on mounts. Spuhr was good, but pricey. ARC M-BRACE was great, and the level was great, but the rings got in the way of my turrets. Not an issue for some, but my turrets are very low profile (USO). MPA BA mounts are very nice, and technically take Spuhr accessories on the side. I like that they mount with two Hex screws. They just work. Lately, I've been using Warne mounts. I like their heights, they're simple, they're cheap with a PRS discount, and they've got good mounting options for pic rails, etc.

Best I've ever been behind is Nightforce. Their top half of the rings just disappear and give an actual good view of the turret. I know a lot of companies claim to have a clear view of the turrets, but nothing comes close to beating Nightforce.

Picked up a Sphur one piece hunting mount for the 7-08. I think it’s the only Sphur mount that actually looks decent.
Other than that, I run Badger C1s and unimounts.

And no, I don’t believe Aadmount is out of business. He usually makes things only after people order them, so much of his stuff appears out of stock.

He also takes a bit to ship. It’s a side hustle for him.

Near Mfg. Alfa Mount for Weatherby
I have a Near Manufacturing Alpha mount for a Weatherby MK V. This mount fits the 9 lug long action only. It is a 1” mount the color is Matt black and it’s a 10 MOA. The screws and mounting instructions from Near will be included. I am going to a 30mm Scope so that’s why I’m selling this mount...

These links are hardly proof, but there you have it.

i can vouch for the unmatched scope grip

i mocked up my scope to figure out placement and eye relief , and then took it shooting without torquing down the cap screws 

with the ring cap screws just finger tight/snug the zero never wandered that whole afternoon

He has not been making mounts for a bit. Every once in a while I try to convince him to start again, but not luck so far.

On the higher end of things, I think I like the Area 419 mount the most for a non-cantilevered design. For a light cantilevered design, I have been very impressed with Reptilia AUS.

There are other good mounts there, obviously, and I have several, but if I had to just pick two, these would be it.

I've had/run a few MPA BA mounts (a PRS staple for a long time) and have been happy with them for the most part, if one can't decide, don't overlook them just because they've been out for a while. They're a good no-nonsense mount that Phil has incrementally updated over the years. There are all kinds of accessories out there like diving boards and shit that work with them, and more recent ones will accept many of the Spuhr gadgets too.

That said, the next mount(s) I buy will be Gray Ops (like @NiteQwill said, new hotness).

I don't care about that, I just mount them so the excess threads don't end up on the same side of the gun as the bolt. But, on second thought, yeah, skip the MPAs now that better options are available.

Because, what did annoy me (and what I'd forgotten about) is: I went through a bit of a phase where I was trying different height mounts a while back... I had bought 3 new MPA mounts at different heights, and found out the hard way that one of them was machined incorrectly/flawed when it slightly dented/crushed my scope tube! I emailed MPA about it telling them it fucked up my scope (figuring they might want the mount sent in to take a look at it, see if I was full of shit, maybe correct the problem) and nothing, crickets... they just completely blew me off! I ended up having to return the mount to EuroOptic (where I bought it) as defective due to MPA sticking their head in the sand. On my own with the (now worthless) scope.

I was lucky that it happened to be a Razor, it had been in excellent condition and I was planning to sell it when my newer version showed up until it went from being worth ~$1700 to $0, and if it wasn't for Vortex's kick-ass warranty and CS, I'd have been fucked! (Vortex fixed it, tested it, gave it a whole new scope body, at no charge.)

It appears Global Defense is about to ship the new hotness to those of us doing the group buy, and they look as great as all their other products under their two companies GDI/Global Defense Initiatives Precision and ADM/American Defense Manufacturing.

Spuhr mounts.... I personally have never had an issue with their IMS mounts and i have had a lot of them over the years ..

Who has first hand experience with Spuhr "issues" and what were/are they ??
