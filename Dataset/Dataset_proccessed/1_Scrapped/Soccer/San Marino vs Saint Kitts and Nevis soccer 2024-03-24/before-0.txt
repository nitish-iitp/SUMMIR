HTX Soccer is pleased to announce that Coach Miguel Becerra ('07 ECNL Boys/Academy GK Director) was selected to be the Goalkeeper/Assistant Coach for the St. Kitts-Nevis Senior Men's Football Team for a pair of international friendly matches against San Marino.

- San Marino vs. St. Kitts-Nevis, March 20, 2024 (Won 3-1)

- San Marino vs. St. Kitts-Nevis, March 24, 2024 (TBA)

"I am honored to be chosen as part of the coaching staff for the St. Kitts-Nevis Men's National Team," said Miguel Becerra. "It will be very exciting to travel to San Marino and help the team prepare and play the games in Europe. It's a great challenge and I look forward to helping the team progress and gain success on the road."

Coach Becerra, who's playing career in Liga MX included stops with Chivas de Guadalajara and Santos Laguna, is part of HTX Soccer’s fully professional coaching staff of over 170 U.S. Soccer and UEFA licensed coaches. The experience of coaching at the senior international level will no doubt bring a unique perspective to his ‘07 ECNL Boys squad and all goalkeepers in the Boys Academy program.

"We are very proud that Coach Miguel was selected to be part of this set of games. He continues to bring a great deal of coaching experience to the Boys Academy,” said Boys Academy Director Alex Cardenas. "He's an integral part of the coaching staff within the club and we're fortunate to have him working with our players on a daily basis."
