LIONEL MESSI SCORES HAT-TRICK FOR ARGENTINA AGAINST BOLIVIA AS HE REFUSES TO SET ‘DEADLINE’ FOR POSSIBLE RETIREMENT
BYBECKY HART

PUBLISHED 16/10/2024 AT 11:31 GMT

Lionel Messi played a big part in Argentina’s 6-0 drubbing of Bolivia, scoring a hat-trick with two further assists in the South American qualifier. It means Argentina remain on top of the standings as they seek to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, where they will be defending their title. But it remains unknown how much longer Messi will play for his country, as he refused to set a "deadline".

Argentina moved three points clear at the top of the South American World Cup qualifying group after beating Bolivia 6-0 at the Monumental de Nunez Stadium, with Lionel Messi scoring a hat-trick on a night to remember for the home fans.
Messi scored his opener after just 19 minutes, before Lautaro Martinez made it 2-0, with Julian Alvarez adding a third in injury time at the end of the first half.

Thiago Almada opened up the scoring in the second half, before Messi added his second in the 84th minute, with the 37-year-old completing his hat-trick just two minutes later.

It takes Messi to 112 international goals, and his joy was clear to see after the match – although he refused to be drawn on exactly when he might play for the last time in Argentinian colours.
“It is very nice to play here feeling the affection of the Argentina fans," Messi said, according to ESPN. 
"It makes me emotional to listen how they shout my name. We all enjoy this connection with the fans and we love playing at home.
"I didn't set any date or deadline about my future. I'm just enjoying all this. I am more emotional than ever and taking all the love from the people because I know these can be my last games."
The next World Cup takes place in 2026, with the expanded tournament set to be played across Canada, the USA and Mexico. There are two further qualifiers for Argentina in November, as they take on Paraguay on November 14, before facing Peru on November 19.

“It's a joy to be present and appreciate this moment. Being surrounded by younger teammates, given my age, makes me feel like a kid again," Messi continued. 
"I find myself doing silly things because I feel so comfortable. As long as I maintain that feeling and can continue contributing to the team, I plan to be here enjoying [the national team]."

BRAZIL CLAIM CONVINCING WIN OVER PERU
While Argentina top the standings, Brazil find themselves down in fourth place in the table, trailing behind Colombia and Uruguay. 
But a comfortable 4-0 victory over Peru has taken them level on points with Uruguay, with the top six set to qualify, while the seventh placed team will enter a play-off tournament. 
Barcelona’s Raphinha scored a penalty in each half to give Brazil a comfortable 2-0 lead, before Andreas Pereira and Luis Henrique added a goal each late on.

Brazil had made a stuttering start to World Cup qualifying, having lost four of five matches, but after beating Chile 2-1, they seem to be growing in confidence and finding their feet.
They trail Uruguay by just one goal on goal difference, and next head to Venezuela on November 14 before taking on Uruguay at home on November 19.
