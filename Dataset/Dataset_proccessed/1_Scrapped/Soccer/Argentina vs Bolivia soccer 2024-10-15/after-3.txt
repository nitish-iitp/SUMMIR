A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users.

Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.

Argentina - Bolivia: As it happened

Argentina return to winning ways with dominant Messi performance.

Lionel Scaloni's men were left frustrated by last week's draw against Venezuela but their quality showed in Tuesday's 6-0 victory over Bolivia. 

More precisely, Lionel Messi's quality showed. The Argentina captain scored three goals and assisted two more of Argentina's six, taking his international tally to an astonishing 112 goals. 

Playing in a slightly withdrawn role behind Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez, Messi had the time and the space to exert his influence on the game and he did just that.

The world champions bounce back from a draw in Venezuela to swat aside Bolivia at Estadio Monumental.

Lionel Messi is continuing to demand the ball in the final moment, dropping deep to link the play and even launching late attacks. He's missed a lot of soccer this year due to injury but Messi looks fresh and firing now.

GOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAL! Lionel Messi

Another one for Messi!

Another loose ball falls at the feet of the Argentina captain on the edge of the box. This time he moves the ball onto his left foot but the result is the same, rifling a low shot past Viscarra and into the bottom corner.

It's been all Argentina so far. Lionel Scaloni's side look much more comfortable than they did in the waterlogged trip to Venezuela last week.

Decent opening for Argentina as Lionel Messi tries to find Julian Alvarez rushing through on goal. The pass is a little overhit and it rolls out for a Bolivia goal kick.

Cheeky nutmeg from Lionel Messi midway into the Bolivia half. He's fouled as he skips past the helpless defender, winning his team a free kick.

Nahuel Molina seemed to clash with goalkeeper Viscarra in that play and he's in some discomfort. 

Medical staff give the full-back a quick once-over. He'll be fine to continue.

Clever ball over the Bolivia backline sets Molina racing in on goal. He does well to bring the ball down but can't find a teammate in the middle. 

Good pass from De Paul to open the Bolivian defence.

Argentina team news: Why isn’t Emiliano Martínez playing against Bolivia?

Bolivia arrive at Estadio Monumental.

The visitor look focused as they prepare to take on the world champions this evening. The history books certainly suggest that this is Argentina's game to lose. 

La Albiceleste have won the last four times these two have met, and eight of their past nine fixtures. Bolivia have never won in Argentina.

Lionel Messi complained about Venezuelan conditions.

Argentina Lionel Messi was not happy that his team were forced to play in sodden conditions against Venezuela last week. 

"It was very difficult, it makes for very ugly matches," Messi told Argentinian media after the game. "We could not complete two passes in a row. In the second half we did it on the right a little more, but it is difficult to play like that. Very little is played."

Messi and his teammates will have no such problems today with perfect conditions in Buenos Aires from this evening's game.

Here's how the visitors line up tonight. La Verde go into the game as clear underdogs but they will be buoyed by recent good results.

Argentina can perform without Messi, Scaloni insists.

Speaking earlier this week Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni was asked about the team's principles when Lionel Messi is not available. Scaloni admitted that Messi remains a key part of the team, but pushed back on the implication that Argentina may struggle without his generational talents. 

 “For the game, it's important that Messi is there because almost all of the team's attack goes through him," Scaloni said.

"In a goal-scoring play he's almost always there, but the idea of the game is always the same, whether he's there or not. We prefer him to be there, logically, but our football concept doesn't change, we already have a way of playing.”

Argentina return to home soil.

Last week's trip to Venezuela did not go as planned for the world champions.

The game was delayed by 30 minutes to allow a little extra time for the flooded pitch to drain. Conditions improved slightly but what followed was a scrappy game that ended 1-1, a key point for the hosts.
