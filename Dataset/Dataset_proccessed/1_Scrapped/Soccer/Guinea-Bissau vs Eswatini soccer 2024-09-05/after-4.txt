[FESTIVAL REVIEW] NORTH COAST 2024 RETURNS TO CHICAGO FOR AN UNFORGETTABLE WEEKEND OF ELECTRONIC MUSIC AND CULTURE
Ally Leomporra | September 05, 2024

Of all the ways to spend Labor Day weekend, nothing compares to North Coast. Held just outside of Chicago in Bridgeview, IL from August 30 to September 1, North Coast Music Festival 2024 was an immersive, multi-sensory journey that every EDM fan should have on their bucket list.  And after experiencing the magic of the weekend, I know I'll never do Labor Day Weekend any other way.

As I stepped into the festival grounds on day 1, I was greeted with a kaleidoscope of colors, sounds and smiling faces. My first stop was Ship Wrek’s set, which was already in full swing with the crowd losing their minds to the ubiquitous track "Baddadan,” that still hasn’t lost its charm. In the middle of the set, the sun began to set beautifully, creating a stunning backdrop.

The evening continued with a stop at The Vega, where Łaszewo had the crowd dancing and singing along with infectious energy. I then ventured over to The Silent Disco, which was a unique, immersive experience where festival-goers were locked into their own world of beats—an addition that you don’t see at many festivals, but one that North Coast nailed.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, I returned to The Vega to catch ACRAZE. To everyone’s surprise, he brought out rapper Lil Mabu, who electrified the crowd by climbing atop the DJ booth as ACRAZE spun "MR. TAKE YA B*TCH." The collaboration was unexpected but wildly entertaining.

I caught the end of Dr. Fresch at The Shipyard, where the crowd was headbanging in a trance-like state. Shortly after, SIDEPIECE took the stage, mixing familiar songs with fun beats and delivering a standout sing-along moment by mixing “Somebody That I Used to Know.” 

After the set, I headed to The Stadium to see Sullivan King, who delivered jaw-dropping build-ups and bass drops. His blend of dubstep with live electric guitar, especially during "Ecstasy of Soul," was an exhilarating experience.

The night culminated with Subtronics, whose set was a visual and auditory explosion, featuring mind-bending visuals, an array of lasers and flashing lights and a surprise guest appearance from his wife, Level Up. It was a perfect high to end the first day.

Day 2 began with a trip to The Chill Dome, where Tape B had amassed an impressive crowd for a 4 PM set. The Chill Dome itself was a marvel—a full soccer field-sized oasis of lasers, cushions, air conditioning and trippy projections. 

 After an incredible set from Tape B, I stopped by a paint station to dip my arm in vibrant swirls color, creating a playful sleeve, and made some new friends at the adjacent Kandi-making station before heading over to Deathpact.

Deathpact’s set at The Vega was a wild mix of mosh pits and pure vibes that were followed by a serene sunset ride on the Ferris wheel.

After my much-needed chill time on the Ferris wheel, I had to check out the The NC Yacht Club Boat near The Shipyard. The boat provided a perfect aerial view of AC Slater’s set and offered a secret bar below deck, a hidden gem of the festival.

The night’s main stage lineup was pure gold. Dab the Sky, Seven Lions and Illenium delivered sets that had the crowd headbanging in a state of euphoric bliss. During Illenium's closing set, he brought out Seven Lions and Said the Sky for a moment of pure magic.

Day 3 was hands down the best day of the festival. It started with some downtime in The Chill Dome, a welcome respite before the beautiful madness of the day. Levity’s set at The Shipyard was packed and full of energy, with the crowd going wild for tracks like "Come a Little Closer" and the creatively remixed "The Less I Know The Better."

Disco Lines kept the momentum going at the main stage with groovy beats and of course, his signature dolphin visuals, while Alan Walker’s subsequent ethereal set at the main stage, featuring my personal-favorite “Alone,” was a beautiful moment. 

But the standout set of the entire festival was BUNT. at The FirePit. The combination of the stage’s mesmerizing geometric domes, shooting flames and BUNT.’s infectious energy created an atmosphere like no other.

With bubbles flying, fans clacking and fire erupting, the crowd was in a state of pure ecstasy for all 60 minutes. His set, including hits like "Clouds" and "TRIPPIN," had everyone dancing like there was no tomorrow.

The fire bursts during his mix of Flume’s "You & Me" were the cherry on top, with fireworks from the other stages conveniently going off at the same time. 

The festival concluded with ISOKNOCK’s insane performance on a floating shipping container stage. As the container lifted into the air, the crowd went wild and stayed that way for the entire set, bringing North Coast 2024 to an unforgettable close.

 

Overall, North Coast 2024 was a beautiful celebration of music, art and community. From surprise guest appearances to breathtaking visuals and a lineup that delivered non-stop energy, the festival solidified its place as a must-attend event for any electronic music lover.

If you weren’t there, you missed out on something truly special. Until next year, North Coast—you’ve set the bar impossibly high.
