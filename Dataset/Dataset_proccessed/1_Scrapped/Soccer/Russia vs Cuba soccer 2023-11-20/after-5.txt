William Pozo, player to follow!

The FC KTP winger will seek to continue being a fundamental piece of the team, he is one of the orchestrators of the offensive and comes to this duel after being the maximum reference in the forward part of the Cuban team. Pozo arrives as one of the recent signings of the Finnish team and will seek to contribute offensively to the team. During last season with the team he played 26 games and scored 6 goals and gave 3 assists. The most important thing for him is to begin to have greater consistency on the field of play and to fit in better with players like Daniel Díaz to form a lethal forward.

How does Cuba arrive?

The Cuban team enters the Volgograd Arena, to face the Russian team and continue its path of preparation towards the future CONCACAF competitions in 2024. These will be part of the CONCACAF qualifiers towards the 2026 World Cup starting in March 2024.

Daniil Khlusevich, player to watch!

The Spartak Moscow midfielder has become one of the great leaders of the Russian team and started all the matches in the process leading up to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Now, after having been left without any chance, Khlusevich is running to be the top reference in The offensive generation that Russia needs and its contribution will be very important for the future and the search to continue improving with this group of players, while they hope to return to some UEFA and FIFA competition. This is one of the jewels of the new generation of Russian football.

How does Russia get here?

Those from Russia appear in this friendly duel without any possibility of participating in any FIFA championship due to the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian government. The Russians present a list with interesting players such as Stanislav Agkatsev, Daniil Khlusevich, Stepan Oganesyan, Daniil Denisov, Aleksandr Golovin and Nikita Saltykov. Russia is not a power in the UEFA zone, but it will seek to continue maintaining the football rhythm with friendlies, hoping that one day it will be able to participate in intercontinental tournaments again. Russia wants to take advantage of the friendly duel to continue improving as a team for their next duel. As long as the war conflict with Ukraine is not resolved, they will continue to be banned from all official competitions.
