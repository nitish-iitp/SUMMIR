The Socceroos have qualified for the Asian Cup quarterfinals after a 4-0 win over Indonesia in Doha, setting up a blockbuster clash against tournament heavyweights Saudi Arabia or South Korea next weekend.

Jackson Irvine's cross forced an own goal from Elkan Baggott to give Australia the lead in the 12th minute, their earliest of the tournament.

Martin Boyle doubled Australia's lead, and took the wind out of Indonesia's sails, in the 45th minute with a terrific diving header.

Craig Goodwin returned from injury to add a third in the 89th and Harry Souttar buried another in injury-time for Australia's heaviest win of the tournament in front of 7,863 fans. 

But despite the scoreline, there will be some concerns for coach Graham Arnold.

Realistically, only a lack of end product stopped Indonesia from scoring early, while Australia did not have a shot until Boyle's goal just after half-time. They also didn't record a second until the 80th minute.

With a pro-Indonesia crowd bringing a loud, parochial atmosphere, Australia's defence looked panicked.

Veteran striker Bruno Fornaroli replaced Kusini Yengi up top and started brightly, but faded.

Just three minutes into the game, Indonesia's Rafael Struick flicked a close-range effort over the bar — one of five first-half shots from the world No.146.

Australia drew first blood when Irvine burst down the right and into the box, before his attempted cross took a heavy deflection off Baggott and beat goalkeeper Ernando Ari.

Australia relieved the pressure with one of their best goals of the tournament as Keanu Baccus slipped a lovely reverse pass to Riley McGree, who fed the ball out wide to Gethin Jones.

The full-back launched a wonderful cross-field ball towards the far post, where Boyle flung himself forward to head home.

Indonesia faded in the second half as Mitch Duke (hamstring) and Goodwin (knee) returned from injury in the 61st and 86th minutes respectively.

Jones, who replaced Nathaniel Atkinson in the starting line-up, came off holding his groin in the 69th minute.

In the dying minutes, Australia broke through again when Irvine's header was brilliantly saved by Ari, only for Goodwin to pounce on the rebound and bury a skidding shot.

Two minutes later, from a free kick, Goodwin turned provider for Souttar, who turned home a lovely flick-header.

South Korea and Saudi Arabia play on Tuesday (3am Wednesday AEDT), with the quarterfinal scheduled for Friday (2:30am Saturday AEDT).

Final thoughts

By Samantha Lewis

Well, that sure was a rollercoaster.

The Socceroos have emerged from a crash-and-bash game 4-0 winners, including two goals in three minutes towards the very end of the second half.

Indonesia were far better than this scoreline implies, really taking it to Australia in the first half, and were unlucky to be down 1-0 after a Jackson Irvine cross was deflected into their own net in the 12th minute.

The Socceroos struggled to create their own attacking chances throughout the first half - which has been the story of their Asian Cup so far, really - but, thanks to a couple smart substitutions, were able to add something different to the back third of the game to extend their lead as Indonesia faded.

Martin Boyle, Craig Goodwin, and Harry Souttar all got on the score-sheet in the second half, which has got to encourage head coach Graham Arnold heading into the quarterfinal leg against either Saudi Arabia or South Korea: two teams which you'd think will pose a much more difficult challenge than the 144th-ranked Indonesians did tonight.

That also means I get one more night with you all! Until then, have a great couple of days, and I'll see you again on the ABC Sport liveblog in the early hours of Saturday morning.

93' Atkinson is shoved over

By Samantha Lewis

The defender was beaten to the ball as he tried to work it backwards, flying in to try and win it back from Rafael Struick.

The Indonesian forward doesn't take kindly to the tackle, though, and shoves Atkinson over as he tried to get up to take the throw-in. Red shirts flood around the sideline, tempers potentially reaching boiling-point, but the referees are able to throw a blanket on the emotions and get the game back underway.

90' GOAL AUSTRALIA

By Samantha Lewis

Big Harry Souttar makes it four!

A Craig Goodwin in-swinging free kick from the yellow-card tussle a second ago is fizzed in at the front post, where the towering centre-back is charging in.

He beats everybody around him to the ball, redirecting it into the far corner of the net.

4-0.

89' Yellow card Indonesia

By Samantha Lewis

Stand-in captain Jordi Amat earns another slice of cheese after a tussle with (I think) Martin Boyle on the right wing. The Socceroo doesn't take it well, standing up to the experienced defender, puffing out their chests at one another. But the linesman intervenes and calms things down.

88' GOAL AUSTRALIA

By Samantha Lewis

And the substitute Craig Goodwin's first contribution is putting the ball in the back of the net to make it 3-0.

Another great cut-back cross from Nathaniel Atkinson on the right wing curls back onto the head of Jackson Irvine, whose header is brilliantly saved by the goalkeeper, but he slaps it right into the path of Goodwin, who volleys it low and hard into the bottom corner.

3-0.

83' Atkinson has a crack

By Samantha Lewis

The right-back had advanced far up the field into the pocket of space left just beyond the top of the box as the Socceroos tried some combos down the left.

None of them come off - the players running into a cul-de-sac of red - so the play is switched across to Atkinson, who takes a steadying touch before opening up his body and shooting low and hard through two diving Indonesian defenders.

It's just off target though and bangs off the advertising boards to the right of the post.

82' Irvine is mad

By Samantha Lewis

He flew into a tackle alongside Jordy Bos to squeeze it away from an Indonesian player, who's sandwiched between the two Aussies, and the referee blows his whistle to signal a free kick.

Irvine is pissed, feeling he won the ball fairly. He picks it up and walks away with it for a couple of steps before throwing it behind him back towards where the foul happened.

He's gotta be careful.

80' Mitch Duke almost makes it three!

By Samantha Lewis

The Socceroos substitute zips in behind Indonesia's two centre-backs to latch onto a gorgeous diagonal through-ball by Martin Boyle from the right.

He's one-on-one with the goalkeeper, who sprints off his line to try and make himself as big as possible, throwing his big arms wide like a starfish.

Duke tries to chip him, but his technique isn't quite right and his shot has too much power, flying over the crossbar instead.

Duke will be filthy at that. A golden chance missed.

78' Indonesia corner

By Samantha Lewis

It's their first of the whole game, I think!

A rare attack down the left wing sees the ball cut back but not controlled well in the box, with a backtracking Keanu Baccus coming in to support his team-mates, only for the ball to bounce off him and out for a corner.

The set-piece is quick and dangerous, an out-swinging corner that is almost lost in the sun by Mat Ryan, but Indonesia isn't able to meet it at the back post and it's cleared.

The second half in a nutshell

75' Australia 2 - 0 Indonesia

By Samantha Lewis

Indonesia haven't been as threatening in this second half, though they haven't stopped coming.

Australia have done better to hold them at bay and shut down the passing shapes they were finding freely in the opening 45.

The Socceroos haven't been much better going forward, though. Mitch Duke has been chasing shadows since he came on, while Connor Metcalfe has struggled to get his foot on the ball and create very much for his wingers.

Jackson Irvine has done a mountain of running to try and keep Indonesia's midfielders at bay, but he could run out of legs soon.
