Daniil Medvedev has pulled off a stunning comeback to beat Alexander Zverev in five sets and reach the Australian Open final against Jannik Sinner, who took down 10-time reigning champion Novak Djokovic in their semifinal.

The 10-time champion's title defence ended at the hands of fourth-seeded Italian Sinner, who won their clash 6-1, 6-2, 6-7(8/6), 6-3 on Rod Laver Arena.

It was Djokovic's first loss at the Australian Open since the fourth round in 2018, while Sinner became the first Italian to reach a singles final at the tournament.

But the remarkable result served as an appetiser to a thrilling late clash between Medvedev and Zverev, who were meeting in a major for the first time.

Zverev appeared set for a regulation victory as he took the first two sets, but Medvedev, for the second time in the tournament, roared back from the brink to get the five-set win.

"I was a little bit lost, but I just said to myself 'if I lose this match I just want to be proud of myself'," Medvedev said after the 5-7, 3-6, 7-6(7/4), 7-6(7/5), 6-3 victory.

Neither player broke serve for two-and-a-half sets after Zverev made it 2-0, meaning Medvedev had to win successive tiebreaks to extend the match into a fifth set.

After four easy service games, the Russian then capitalised on some untimely errors from his opponent to break for the first time since the opening set, taking a 3-2 lead and infuriating Zverev, who clobbered the net with his racquet to earn warning from the umpire.

Medvedev did not surrender his advantage as he emulated his second-round win over Emil Ruusuvuori by coming back from 2-0 down to win a match in five sets, while Zverev no doubt had flashbacks to the 2020 US Open final when he relinquished the same lead to Dominic Thiem.

After four hours and 18 minutes on court, Medvedev made it through to the Australian Open final for the third time in four years.

"Third time lucky," he said hopefully in his on-court interview.

Good night all

By Jon Healy

We'll be back tomorrow for women's final day, when we'll see Aryna Sabalenka defend her crown against rising star Qinwen Zheng.

There will also be two Aussies in action, with Emerson Jones in the girls' singles final and Mat Ebden in the men's double decider.

I look forward to seeing you then!

A quick look ahead to the final

By Jon Healy

Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev has the 6-3 edge in the head to head with final opponent Jannik Sinner, but the 22-year-old Italian's three wins all came in their last three meetings, in October and November last year.

Sunday's final will be their first five-setter and first grand slam showdown, with Sinner shooting for his first major title in his first major final, while Medvedev is trying to add an Aussie crown to his 2021 US Open win.

It should be a banger.

DANIIL MEDVEDEV PULLS OFF THE COMEBACK OF A LIFETIME!

By Jon Healy

(Getty)

The Russian is into the Australian Open for the third time after a miraculous comeback after trailing Alex Zverev two sets to love, winning two straight tiebreaks and wrapping up the 5-7, 3-6, 7-6(7/4), 7-6(7/5), 6-3 in a whopping four hours and 18 minutes.

This is Medvedev's third four-hour five-setter of this tournament. What an effort.

The third seed is pointing at his head and the mental effort was perhaps even more impressive than the physical.

So, what was he thinking after losing that second set?

"I was a little bit lost, but I just said to myself if I lose this match I just want to be proud of myself."

Medvedev says he made an effort to be more aggressive and it worked.

He says this is the most physically draining tournament of his life.

"I'm happy. A month ago I wanted to change to be stronger mentally and think less about one guy in the crowd who screams something or when I think the referee has done something wrong.

"I'm still far from perfect, but I'm trying."

Medvedev will meet fourth seed Jannik Sinner when he plays his third Australian Open final in the past four years, but he's yet to get a win on this court.

"Third time lucky," he says hoepfully.

Zverev serving to stay in the match

By Jon Healy

Medvedev gets the first point as Zverev sends another ball long. 0-15

And he's dumped a forehand into the net, prompting a racquet change. He hasn't broken a string, so the serve clock should still be counting, but I think the umpire's sensing now's not the time. 0-30

Zverev lands a first serve and follows it in, bashing home the backhand winner. 15-30

CLUUUUUUUUTCH! A booming forehand winner clips the back of the baseline and gets Zverev back to 30-30.

But a backhand sails long to set up a Medvedev match point. 30-40

AND THERE IT IS!!!

Daniil Medvedev is playing from in front for the first time in four hours

By Jon Healy

Medvedev has been playing catch-up since being broken in his second service game.

Now he's playing with the lead, serving at 4-3 in the fifth.

And he barely has to work to hold serve as Zverev sprays four straight unforced errors.

Medvedev is one game away now.

Zverev breaks the net and Medvedev breaks his serve

By Jon Healy

Zverev sends a volley long and gives Medvedev a look at two break points at 2-2, and he belts the net with his racquet, detaching the anchor in the middle of the court.

After some repairs, Zverev saves the first break point.

Gutsy from Zverev, getting up to the net again off a cross-court backhand (typically a no-no) and knocking home the high forehand volley this time.

STUNNING! Medvedev finally finds that running, dipping cross-court backhand passing shot. He's been trying it all night and hasn't landed it until now.

Zverev nets a forehand and surrenders the break. And the frustration is showing now.

What a shot from Alex Zverev: Volleying King

By Jon Healy

Alex Zverev gets in to the net again and Daniil Medvedev plays the perfect running backhand in at his toes, but once again Zverev digs out a majestic half-volley that sneaks over the net for a winner.

Zverev comes to the net for three straight points and wins them all, then gets in again but tries to go back behind Medvedev with his volley, but it's his undoing.

Alas. An ace gets Zverev a pretty standard hold of serve to reach 2-1.

Fourth-set tiebreak

By Jon Healy

Medvedev 1-0 Zverev: Medvedev steps in after a big serve and draws the error.

Medvedev 1-1 Zverev: Big serving from the German once again.

Medvedev 1-2 Zverev: Medvedev gets himself into an awkward position as he hunts a backhand return on a second serve, and Zverev capitalises.

Medvedev 2-2 Zverev: Medvedev gets in to the net and finishes the point with a calm volley into an open court as Zverev tries and almost pulls off a brilliant running pass.

Medvedev 3-2 Zverev: An off backhand winner from Medvedev. Brilliantly played in the clutch.

Medvedev 3-3 Zverev: Zverev makes the volley into the open court, just. And it's all square at the change of ends.

Medvedev 3-4 Zverev: Power on the wide serve from Zverev and he follows it in, finishing with a drive backhand volley.

Medvedev 4-4 Zverev: The Russian has his serve humming now and he's getting some free points off it.

Medvedev 4-5 Zverev: A DOUBLE FAULT OUT OF NOWHERE! Medvedev's first since the first set at the worst possible time. Zverev can win two points on serve to win the match.

Medvedev 5-5 Zverev: A gentle first serve from Zverev allows Medvedev to dictate and a ripping off forehand into the corner sets up a winner at the net.

Medvedev 6-5 Zverev: Oh my word. The ever-unconventional slice forehand return catches a bit of frame and sneaks over the net to set up set point for Medvedev.

Ace! Medvedev takes the breaker 7-5!

Zverev holds to go to a tie-break as tensions rise

By Jon Healy

(Getty)

A hint of gamesmanship from Medvedev as he holds up Zverev after the German won the first point on his serve. Medvedev is requesting a replay of a winner that was well in and Zverev is frustrated with the delay.

"He's doing a show here," Zverev says to the umpire.

(Getty)

I have to agree. There really isn't much point in requesting the replay when all the line calls are automated.

But after all the drama, Zverev holds to love and we're off to a tie-break.

Medvedev misses out on two break points at 4-3

By Jon Healy

(AP)

He gets the first point on Zverev's serve with a ripping backhand passing shot, but Zverev gets back to 15-15 with an ace.

Zverev had the third point on his racquet too, but sprayed his backhand wide with Medvedev on the run. But again Zverev recovers, this time with a well-executed serve and volley, forcing the running forehand error from Medvedev.

A brilliant lunging volley from Medvedev sneaks over the net and gives the Russian a break point at 30-40! It's the first break-point chance either player has had in this set.

But against Zverev's serve saves him.

AIR-SWING! Medvedev puts up a lob and Zverev thinks he has it covered, but he just can't get enough lift from his legs on the smash and it drops in.

Another break point saved by Zverev with a bomb down the T. Back to deuce.

Medvedev thought he had the brilliant cross-court backhand passing shot, but it was just wide. Advantage Zverev

And he holds with another unreturnable serve. Tense stuff and clutch serving from Zverev.

Four straight love holds to start the fourth set

By Jon Healy

Daniil Medvedev is serving first in this one, so Alex Zverev will have to serve to stay in the set if we stay on serve.

It does feel like these two just resettle in the opening games of each set and get ready for the slugfest later on.

Daniil Medvedev is still alive in this semifinal, taking the third set in a tiebreak!

By Jon Healy

(Getty)

Daniil Medvedev extends this semifinal into a fourth set at least.

He upped his game in that set, landing his first serve at a better right, cutting out the double faults, and cutting down the length of the points, playing them on his terms more often than in the first two frames.

Will it be a blip, or the start of a proper turnaround?

We're into a third-set tiebreak

By Jon Healy

Alex Zverev trying to win the match and reach the final. Daniil Medvedev trying to extend this match.

Zverev 0-1 Medvedev: The Russian gets the mini-break with a slapped cross-court forehand return that Zverev can't get back.

Zverev 1-1 Medvedev: Zverev follows a deep shot into the net and finishes another point with the volley.

Zverev 1-2 Medvedev: Medvedev follows suit, dictating from the baseline and getting into the net. Zverev tries the looping, swinging passing shot, but Medvedev volleys into the open court.

Zverev 1-3 Medvedev: Shocking missed volley from Zverev, who approached on a powerful forehand and got the return he wanted, but couldn't finish it off.

Zverev 2-3 Medvedev: Medvedev sends a backhand wide after Zverev skimmed the baseline with his forehand.

Zverev 3-3 Medvedev: We change ends on the back of a badly missed backhand from Medvedev, dumping a middle-of-the-court shot straight into the net. Not the time for an unforced error.

Zverev 3-4 Medvedev: Unreturnable serve from Medvedev. Always nice to get a freebie.

Zverev 4-4 Medvedev: A booming forehand sets up a simple overhead for Zverev, and this time he puts it away into the open court.

Zverev 4-5 Medvedev: Zverev sees Medvedev rushing the net and tries to put a little extra on his slice backhand, but he can't get it over the net.

Zverev 4-6 Medvedev: Horrible time for a forehand error for Zverev, giving his opponent two set points.

And Medvedev gets the tiebreak 7-4!

Medvedev serving to stay in it

By Jon Healy

We're still 100 per cent on serve in this set and Daniil Medvedev will serve at 5-6, trying to send this set to a tiebreak.

He starts perfectly, with an ace down the middle. 15-0

Zverev shanks a wide-open drive volley with the entire court at his mercy, once again pointing to the lights or the big screen and suggesting it's hampering him on high balls. 30-0

A brilliant drop shot takes Medvedev to 40-0 and he finishes things off as Zverev nets a forehand return.
