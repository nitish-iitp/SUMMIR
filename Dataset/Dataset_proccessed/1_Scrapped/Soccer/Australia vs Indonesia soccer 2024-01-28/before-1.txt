Lionel Messi mania at Inter Miami remains in full swing, with the MLS franchise now said to be valued at $1 billion (£787m).

Only four MLS teams in the $1 billion club
WHAT HAPPENED?

The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner moved to the United States as a free agent in 2023 after reaching the end of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain. Within weeks of his arrival, Inter Miami were celebrating a historic Leagues Cup triumph. They also reached the U.S. Open Cup final before coming unstuck against the Houston Dynamo.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

The Herons were unable to reach the MLS play-offs, as Messi picked up an untimely injury, but positive progress continues to be made on and off the field. They now have a marketing dream at their disposal, with co-owner David Beckham and the club’s board making the most of that.

DID YOU KNOW?

A first international tour is being taken in at the start of 2024 – which includes a meeting with Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr – and Sportico claims that the club has joined the $1 billion club. Only four MLS sides are said to have hit that mark, with the others being LAFC at $1.15billion (£903m), Atlanta United on $1.05billion (£825m) and the $1 billion (£787m) valued LA Galaxy.

WHAT NEXT?

Nobody gets close to Inter Miami when it comes to annual value increase, as they surge by 74%, with LAFC only up by 28%. In 2023, the Florida-based franchise sat 10th on the MLS chart, but the presence of Argentine all-time great Messi at DRV PNK Stadium has seen them soar up the rankings.
