Superstar striker Erling Haaland had yet another phenomenal season in front of goal in 2023-24 - scoring 38 goals across all competitions for Manchester City.

Of those 38 goals - Haaland netted seven braces, one hat-trick and a further two games where he scored four and five goals respectively.

For those tipping Haaland to find the back of the net on multiple occasions in Norway's international friendly against Kosovo in Oslo tonight - let's take a look at Sky Bet's Multi Scorers market.

For Haaland to score a brace - that is currently priced at 7/2 according to Sky Bet.

He is predictably the shortest-priced in the market - with his team-mate Jorgen Strand Larsen the next best-backed from either side at 10/1.
