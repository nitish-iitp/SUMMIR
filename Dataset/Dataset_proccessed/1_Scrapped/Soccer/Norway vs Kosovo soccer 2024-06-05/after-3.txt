Norway beat Kosovo 3-0 in a friendly
Haaland scored all three goals
It was his 22nd career hat-trick
WHAT HAPPENED?

The Manchester City striker was simply unstoppable as he ran riot against Kosovo's defence on Wednesday afternoon at the Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo. He took just 15 minutes to open the scoring and netted two more goals after the break to complete his sensational hat-trick. The Norwegian had four shots on target, out of which three found the back of the net.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Haaland was phenomenal for City in the 2023-24 campaign as he went on to score 38 goals across all competitions - including one hat-trick, one four-goal haul, and a further five-goal glut. He has carried on that menacing form to international football and a hapless Kosovo were the victims on this occasion.

DID YOU KNOW?

It was Haaland's 22nd career hat-trick at just 23 years of age. Moreover, he has taken just 32 games to reach 30 international goals for Norway.

WHAT NEXT FOR HAALAND?

Haaland will be missing in action in Euro 2024 as Norway failed to qualify for the continental tournament. However, he will take the pitch on June 8 in another friendly against Denmark before heading for his summer break.
