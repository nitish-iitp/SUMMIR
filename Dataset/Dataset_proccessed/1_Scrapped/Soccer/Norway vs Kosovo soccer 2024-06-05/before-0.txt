Preview: Norway vs. Kosovo - prediction, team news, lineups

Both preparing for next season's UEFA Nations League, Norway and Kosovo meet for an international friendly at Oslo's Ullevaal Stadion on Wednesday.

Neither nation made it through to Euro 2024, so they will instead use this month's get-together to build towards the future.

Having finished third in European Championship qualifying Group A, behind Spain and Scotland, Norway's long wait to take part at major finals continues - the Nordic nation have not reached any of the past six Euros and last featured at the World Cup finals in 1998.

Stale Solbakken's side are therefore casting their eye towards the next challenge, as they will take on Austria, Kazakhstan and Slovenia in the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League, competing in the competition's second tier.

Last time around, Norway finished second to Serbia in League B Group 4, and gaining promotion will again be a lot to ask - yet a squad featuring stars such as Erling Haaland, Alexander Sorloth and Martin Odegaard holds plenty of promise.

During the spring international period, the Lions were beaten 2-1 at home by the Czech Republic, then held to a 1-1 draw by Slovakia; nonetheless, they have won five of their last eight friendly fixtures heading into Wednesday's game.

Before tackling neighbours Denmark at the weekend, Norway's first summer outing will bring a first-ever senior match against Kosovo, who also came up short on the road to Germany.

Hoping for a first major finals appearance since independence - and their subsequent entry into UEFA back in 2016 - Kosovo could only finish second-bottom of Group I in Euro 2024 qualifying.

With just two wins from 10 games, they ended up six points shy of second-placed Switzerland, wrapping the campaign up with a dismal 1-0 home defeat to Belarus.

Head coach Primoz Gliha then stepped down, and former Austria manager Franco Foda was appointed by the Football Federation of Kosovo, before experiencing mixed fortunes during his first camp in charge.

The Dardenet's two March friendlies saw them beat Armenia but then lose in Hungary, as the German coach ran the rule over his new troops, including all-time top scorer Vedat Muriqi.

Now, this week's trip to Norway will help Foda's squad tune up for the next Nations League: after finishing second to Greece in League C Group 2 last time around, Kosovo must try to top a section also featuring Cyprus, Lithuania and Romania.

If Stale Solbakken had planned to pair Erling Haaland with Alexander Sorloth again, the Norway coach's hopes were scuppered when the latter - who narrowly missed out on the Pichichi award for La Liga's top scorer - was ruled out of this month's friendlies by a hamstring injury.

Therefore, Manchester City's Oscar Bobb and uncapped Malmo striker Erik Botheim are among several men in contention to support Haaland up front on Wednesday evening.

Experienced winger Mohamed Elyounoussi has not been called up, but Benfica prospect Andreas Schjelderup is in line for his first senior cap - either in midweek or against Denmark at the weekend.

While Martin Odegaard captains the home side, Napoli defender Amir Rrahmani is Kosovo's skipper - and their most capped player.

He should start in front of Burnley goalkeeper Arijanet Muric, while namesake Albion Rrahmani was recently named in the Romanian Super League team of the season after racking up 19 goals and five assists from 30 appearances.

However, the latter faces a tough task to supplant record goalscorer Vedat Muriqi in attack, where the Mallorca striker is set to link up with Edon Zhegrova, who impressed in Lille's run to the Europa Conference League quarter-finals; fellow winger Milot Rashica misses out due to injury.


Norway possible starting lineup:
Nyland; Ajer, Hanche-Olsen, Ostigard, Wolfe; Odegaard, Thorstvedt, Berge; Larsen, Haaland, Bobb

Kosovo possible starting lineup:
Muric; Vojvoda, Am. Rrahmani, Aliti, Paqarada; Idrizi, V. Berisha; Zhegrova, B. Berisha, Rashani; Muriqi



We say: Norway 2-0 Kosovo

With only three goals from their last five games - and sitting some 55 places below their hosts in the FIFA World rankings - Kosovo are not expected to cause an upset in Oslo.

Norway boast the firepower required to take care of business, before moving on to meet Denmark in a more high-profile contest later this week.
