By adhering to this standard, organizations can ensure the availability and functionality of these life-saving devices. To gain a deeper understanding of the importance of emergency eyewash and shower systems and the specifics of the ANSI Z358.1-2014 standard, read on.

What is ANSI Z358.1?

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) plays a pivotal role in the American engineering standards community. As a private non-profit organization, ANSI oversees the creation, promulgation, and use of thousands of norms and guidelines that directly impact businesses in nearly every sector. Originating from the United States and known earlier as the America Standards Institute, ANSI coordinates the voluntary standards development process in the U.S. This process involves a range of stakeholders, including government agencies, private companies, and academic institutions, collaborating to draft standards for consideration.

The ANSI Z358.1 serves as a comprehensive guideline for the standardization of emergency eye wash and shower equipment in the workplace. Authored and released by the International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA), an organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to develop standards, this guideline sets forth the basic requirements and standards for the performance and usage of eyewash and shower equipment, aimed at the emergency treatment of individuals exposed to hazardous substances.

Integration with OSHA Regulations

OSHA is the national organization responsible for enforcing health and safety legislation in the United States, but it does not formally incorporate ANSI standards into its voluntary standards and regulatory framework. However, it frequently cites ANSI Z358.1 as a trusted guideline for the correct installation and maintenance of emergency eye wash and shower stations. Specifically, OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.151(c) mandates that facilities be equipped with appropriate means for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body in areas where exposure to harmful corrosive materials is possible, to be used during emergencies.

Benefits of Compliance

Legal Compliance: Adhering to standards of the American National Standards Institute or ANSI Z358.1 helps companies and other organizations meet regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of penalties and fines associated with non-compliance.
Improved Worker Safety: Compliance ensures the availability of effective emergency decontamination facilities, decreasing the likelihood and severity of injuries from hazardous material exposure.
Reduced Downtime From Injuries: By minimizing the severity of injuries, compliance with ANSI Z358.1 can lead organizations to quicker recovery times and less operational disruption, saving costs on lost business productivity and worker compensation.

ANSI Z358.1-2014 Updates

While the core of the ANSI Z358.1 standard remained largely unchanged from the 2009 version, the ANSI Z358.1-2014 revision introduced specific international standards and updates to existing standards to enhance usability and safety. Here are the notable changes, with references to the specific sections of the standard:

Hands-free operations: Section 4.1.5 states that, “Emergency showers shall be designed, manufactured and installed in such a manner that, once activated, they can be used without requiring the use of the operator’s hands.”

Weekly visual checks of self-contained emergency showers: Section 4.6.3 states that “Self-contained emergency showers shall be visually checked weekly to determine if flushing fluid needs to be changed or supplemented. Such inspection shall be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.”

Height of the flushing fluid stream: Sections 5.4.4 and 6.4.4 state that Eyewashes and eye/face wash stations shall “be arranged such that the flushing fluid flow pattern as described in Section 5.1.8 (and 6.1.8) is not less than 33 in. and no greater than 53 in. from the surface on which the user stands and 6 in. minimum from the wall or nearest obstruction.” The 2009 international standards limited nozzle height to 45", while the 2014 revision focuses on the fluid flow pattern, setting its maximum height at 53".

Weekly visual checks of self-contained eyewashes: Section 5.5.3 states that "Self-contained eyewashes shall be visually checked weekly to determine if flushing fluid needs to be changed or supplemented. Such inspection shall be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions."

 

ANSI Z358.1-2014 Safety Considerations

In compliance with ANSI Z358.1-2014 international standards, several key safety considerations must be addressed regarding emergency eye wash and shower units.

Personal Wash Unit

American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards acknowledge the use of personal wash units, such as bottled eyewashes, as supplements to compliant fixtures outlined in the guide. While they are vital in highly hazardous environments, they do not offer the same level of protection as ANSI-compliant drench safety showers or eye/face washes.

First Aid Devices

Emergency eye wash and shower units are essential first aid devices designed to rinse contaminants from the eyes, face, or body during accidents. However, they are not substitutes for primary protective devices like eye and face protection or safe handling procedures for hazardous materials.

Wastewater Disposal

Implementing a plan for wastewater disposal is crucial. This can include drains in new construction or dedicated waste containment systems. Failure to dispose of flushing fluid properly can create slip hazards and pose risks to impaired workers. Compliance with local ordinances and regulations is necessary when planning disposal methods.

Identification

Eyewash and shower equipment should be clearly identified with signage that meets the requirements of ANSI Z535.4. The signage should be highly visible, making it clear, and use recognizable symbols and appropriate wording to ensure quick recognition during emergencies.

Emergency Response

Mere installation of emergency equipment is insufficient for ensuring worker safety. Employees must be trained in the location and proper use of emergency equipment. Regular maintenance of equipment is also crucial. Ultimately, employers should develop a comprehensive response plan focused on providing prompt assistance to injured workers in case of accidents.

Emergency equipment should be installed within 10 seconds of walking time from the hazard, approximately 55 feet. It should be on the same level as the hazard, with an unobstructed and straight path to access the equipment. In high-risk areas handling strong acids or caustics, emergency eyewash equipment should be adjacent to the hazard. Laboratory environments may require recessed eyewash/shower cabinets and dual-purpose units at lab sinks.

Water Capacity, Flow Rate, & Temperature

Safety showers and eyewashes must have a minimum pressure of 30 psi (207 kPa), ideally supplied at 45 psi (310 kPa). Water temperature should be tepid (60-100ºF), but consultation with medical professionals may be needed for chemicals sensitive to warm water.

Valve Operation

Valves should remain open for easy access during emergencies, allowing injured individuals to use their hands freely. In some cases, self-closing ball valves may be allowed in less hazardous environments, with proper shut-off valve security measures in place.

Corrosion Resistance

All components of the emergency eye wash and shower equipment, including pipes, fittings, valves, and accessories, should be made of materials that are resistant to corrosion. Materials like epoxy-coated galvanized steel, chrome-plated brass, stainless steel, and PVC are highly recommended to users for durability.

Anti-Freeze Equipment

Freeze-resistant emergency eyewash equipment is essential in cold climates. Options include temperature-actuated bleed valves, remote-activated valves, electrically heated units, and heated enclosures to protect both equipment and users from freezing temperatures.
