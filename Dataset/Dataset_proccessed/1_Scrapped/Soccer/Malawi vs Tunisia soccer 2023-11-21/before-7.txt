The Flames start their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign with a mission to get their first win in West Africa as they face Liberia at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex in Monrovia from 6pm.

Malawi have never won a match in West Africa but Coach Patrick Mabedi says with the right mentality and approach the story will change today.

The former Flames captain says the team need to build on their unbeaten run in the last seven matches under his leadership to start on a good note and stand a chance of qualifying for their maiden World Cup out of group H which also has Tunisia, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome Principle and Namibia.

“The players are ready physically and mentally. We have adjusted to the weather here and are looking forward to the game.

“Struggling in West Africa is a mental thing. We always have that mind that when we come here it’s a problem. Secondly, we don’t adjust quickly and manage time during the game. Tactically we also didn’t plan very well in the past.

“So, I think it’s time to get the basics right with modern approaches to the game and must adjust accordingly. If we manage all the aspects, we will be successful.

“I have watched Liberia in their previous matches. They are a good side if you give them time and space and can hurt you, but at the same time they are vulnerable if you take your opportunities and not allow them to play. So basically, it is a team that you need to manage tactically,” he said.

After their clash against Liberia, Malawi will face Tunisia on 21 November, 2023 at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe.
