Two goals in the opening three minutes proved enough to hand Wales their first win under Craig Bellamy out in Montenegro.

Kieffer Moore struck inside the opening minute of another absorbing evening, before Harry Wilson's stunning strike doubled their advantage two minutes later. Driton Camaj pulled one back for the hosts deep into the second half, but Wales weren't to be denied a first win of the new UEFA Nations League campaign.

It perhaps wasn't as swashbuckling a performance as seen against Turkey on Friday, but this was perhaps a time to admire the character of Bellamy's side, who were surely stifled by the driving rain at the Stadion Gradski.

Then again, the hosts might well feel they deserved something from this encounter.

Stevan Jovetic's effort from the halfway line came back off the crossbar early in the first half, while Vladimir Jovovic also curled an effort against the woodwork after the interval shortly before Camaj's strike.

But Wales will, on the whole, feel they were good value for this victory, and have every reason to look back with satisfaction at the progress made under their new boss so far.

Bellamy had promised to make changes for the trip to Niksic, and duly delivered with five alterations from what was a hugely promising opening gambit.

Darlow was handed his first cap. Ollie Cooper and Lewis Koumas started from the off for the first time. Aaron Ramsey and Sorba Thomas, both of whom were hugely impressive in Bellamy's first game, started from the bench.

The sight of Moore starting at number nine felt almost unnervingly conventional after Friday's antics. A sight that caused us to all question whether what we saw last time was just in our heads. A wild collective fever dream.

Montenegro, a stereotypical 'difficult place to go' always felt more likely to be a little more nip and tuck. A little more reserved. A little more, well, normal.

All of those musings would eventually become increasingly prophetic as the evening wore on, but looked potentially ridiculous after the opening 37 seconds as Moore, sporting his trademark red bandage, gobbled up a loose ball inside the box before slotting home.

A dream start was then compounded just two minutes later. Neco Williams teeing up Wilson, who curled home a delicious long-range effort into the top corner of the net

We weren't even five minutes in, and already Wales had done enough to get most of us out of our seats. It was another frantic start, and felt like the foundation of what was going to be a Wales away performance for the ages.

But after stumbling their way out the blocks, Montenegro turned up to the party five minutes later. Chris Mepham, another of the five changes, laboured to get across his penalty area as Stefan Mugosa's ball fizzed its way to Nikola Krstovic, who would have surely scored had he managed to hit the target.

Jovetic nearly left Darlow's debut dreams in tatters a few minutes later, catching him off his line before clanking an audacious effort off the crossbar from the halfway line.

Darlow was called into action again to gather Jovovic's low effort, just after Wilson had fired high and wide from a short freekick routine.

The Leeds United star was called upon again on the half-hour mark, keeping out Krstovic's deflected cross, before denying Jovetic, whose effort on the rebound was thumped clear off the line by Ben Davies.

Bellamy surely won't have been best pleased by some of the defending on show from his side, but Wales remained a threat, particularly on the counter.

Indeed, Williams might well have added a third following one of several sweeping attacking moves, but was denied by a brilliant last-ditch tackle from Andrija Vukcevic.

But still the hosts asked questions. Jovetic was convinced his side should have had a penalty when his header appeared to come off the arm of Davies, but referee Georgi Kabakov was unmoved.

Conditions worsened as an intriguing first half approached its conclusion, and it clearly proved a challenge for the players.

Connor Roberts was forced to pull out just before the break, making way for Brennan Johnson, while Thomas was brought on to replace youngster Koumas for the second half.

Johnson stung the palms of goalkeeper Milan Mijatovic as Wales stepped up their efforts to kill off the game, which Moore really should have done just after the hour, somehow guiding the ball over the bar after Davies had squared to tee him up for an open net.

Jovovic nearly made the visitors pay for their profligacy, curling a long-range effort against the post, while Darlow produced a smart save to turn Jovetic's stooping header round the post moments later.

But Montenegro weren't to be denied, and grabbed what was, by now, a deserved goal 17 minutes from time.

Krstovic got the better of Joe Rodon and then pulled back for Camaj, who shrugged off the attention of Williams to slot home.

However, it wasn't enough to spoil the party for Wales, who are now firmly up and running under their new boss.
