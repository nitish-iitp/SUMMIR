GRAVITY BALLISTICS​


GRAVITY BALLISTICS APP FEATURES​
Spend less time plugging in data and more time behind the glass. Gravity Ballistics walks you through building your DOPE by working with initial drop values (whether in MILs or MOA).
Save your profile for later use! Testing different loads? Shooting multiple rifles? Shooting in a new region with unfamiliar weather factors? Create unlimited profiles and store them for future reference!
Ready for even the most remote locations. Gravity Ballistics doesn't require an internet connection to work; access your profiles and add new ones even when you're not near a cell tower!

A Simplified Ballistic Calculator that uses the difference in gravity between yard lines to determine the elevation change. Gravity Ballistics works with any rifle zeroed at 100 yards. From 5.56 to .50 if you zero it at 100 yards, the App will work to dope your rifle.


DITCH THE COMPLEX FORMULAS FOR BALLISTIC CALCULATIONS​
Are you spending more time poking at your Kestrel than you are shooting? Or are you still calculating your DOPE by hand? Take out the complexity of ballistic calculations with Gravity Ballistics.

Gravity Ballistics' ballistic calculator app operates on a KISS philosophy. No need to worry about bullet weight, powder loads, muzzle velocity or barrel twist here. Calculate your drop based on actual performance data, adjusting it as you go to match your rifle & ammo profile!

The App is super straightforward, and if you don't travel and prefer to shoot on a home range, it is perfectly capable of being your primary calculator.

It works in Meters or Yards, and trues the data as you move out.

Bought it, FYI google Play store seems to be playing fuck fuck games with finding it.
Searching the app name even with exact capitalization won't find it. Searching "snipers hide" shows the forum app which then allows you to see other apps from the same publisher.

Love that this is out.

I can't get it on the play store as I have de-Googled my phone for obvious reasons.

The biggest Android non Google platform is APKpure. If you could put it up on there, I am an instant buy.

Love it Frank. Best of luck and I think this will do really, really well.

Got it and it is looking really awesome!

On the dope chart, How do I remove the  on the right side if i made a mistake or don’t want the input I entered?
I can set it back to what it says is “predicted drop” but it then still has the . can I erase or clear my input? Without erasing and or making a new profile?
Thanks!

And when I enter a new profile I can’t see the bottom two inputs while I type. Like the keyboard is in the way. Do I need to just update my iOS maybe?





Found a fix for this part. I turned off “predictive” in my iPhone keyboard settings.

If you delete the input (leave it Blank) the check mark will go away and the program will auto-calculate the predicted drop again.

Guys - Remember that although we cannot resolve .05 through the scope, that half-of-a-tenth goes a long way toward getting everything lined up correctly at the farther ranges. Try that at your 300 and 400 range inputs and notice the difference it makes at 800-1000.

Am I in dork mode again?

Email doesn’t send the range card, but instead sends the dope chart. Not a big deal there.

But the email Key description says “the drop is the difference in inches between the current range and previous range.”

It seems instead that the drop column is simply “the difference between the current range and the previous range.”

Just omit the “in inches” part in the email?

You are correct. Difference but not difference in inches. Ap designer probably did NOTunderstand that nuance

The difference is not inches, it was supposed to be generic as its the difference in the unit of adjustment you are using, Mils or MOA

So the difference is in that format

Just downloaded the app and went to build a profile for my Vudoo. But it appears I have to use 100 yards as my baseline. Am I missing something? Is there a way to modify the zero 25 or 50 yards?
