Anyone used these? I've read and seen some impressive results for the money on wilson barrels from a good friend of mine whom I trust. Seeing as Cooper owns Wilson barrels I have no doubt they'll shoot. I'm curious if anyone has used the raggedholed carbon wrapped wilson barrels though? We have a 700 KS Custom in 300wby that I'm going to rechamber in 7PRC since it is collecting dust and am wanting to keep it light weight without going pencil thin so it's still a decent suppressor host.

I see, they're very well priced, know of anyone that has used their carbon fiber barrels?

Buddy of mine who’s a hider also has had great success with them. Which has me sold just not sure how the carbon fiber performs. Granted my proof and Carbonsix have been fine but this would be thinner for a CF wrapped barrel

I had less than steller results with the proof ss barrel I tested a while back. This Wilson shot measurably better...

Probably not i saw some proofs for $600 but the issue for me is fitting a CF into this browns precision stock on our 700 KS custom. Which is an ultralight build. #4 will be pushing it. John at ragedholes says the carbon fiber barrels are nearly a 1 to 1 contour match.

Agree. Proof seems to be hit or miss lately. I’ve had some great barrels and some meh barrels

So after talking to Brown's precision that stock can't be opened up without getting into the foam shell. I pivoted changed it to a #4 6.5mm for finish at 22" and am having LRI open up my Sako 85 bolt face to fit a 6.5 SAUM, and will rebarrel my Sako 85 to 6.5 SAUM. So i should be getting it sooner rather than later.

For the 7 PRC I'm going to have to sell the Brown's precision stock and pick up a Manners UC and then likely a bartlein #4 for finish at 23".
