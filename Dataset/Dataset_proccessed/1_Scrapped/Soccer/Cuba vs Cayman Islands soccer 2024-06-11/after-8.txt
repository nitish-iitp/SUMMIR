Cayman forfeits Cuba game after first match win in WC
Cayman News | 11/06/2024 | 74 Comments
Moment of the winning goal (from social media)

(CNS): The Cayman Islands Mens National Football Team was riding high on the road to the 2026 World Cup after a dramatic and historic win at the weekend over visitors Antigua and Barbuda in the second round qualifiers. But hopes of actually getting through this round have now been dashed after a decision has been made not to play in Cuba. US travel restrictions pose a risk to Cayman’s players, many of whom are in college or training in the United States.

Cayman secured a fantastic win on Saturday evening at the Truman Bodden Sports Complex in front of a thrilled local crowd. This was the first time the national men’s squad won a qualifying game for the World Cup, and 18-year-old Joshwa Campbell’s header during stoppage time clinched the one-nil victory.

However, Cayman Islands Football Association (CIFA) President Alfredo Whittaker said that despite every effort to move the game to another island, CONCACAF could not help because Cuba is entitled to a home match.

The US routinely cancels ESTA visa waivers for anyone who has travelled to Cuba. This would impact several of the national team players who are under 23, on student visas to attend college in the US and have ESTAs in their British passports. Whittaker told the Cayman Compass that the team had discussed the options and decided they could not play in Cuba and would have to forfeit the match.

“I don’t want to risk any of these boys’ ESTAs being removed or their student visas removed for one game,” the president said.

It’s a long wait until the next game. The CONCACAF qualifiers will be next June when Cayman takes on Bermuda and Honduras.

See Campbell’s winning header here.

Sounds like rubbish to me. Direct from the US government website…

“The 12 categories of authorized travel to Cuba are: family visits; official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments, and certain intergovernmental organizations; journalistic activity; professional research and professional meetings; educational activities; religious activities; public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, …”

“I don’t want to risk any of these boys’ ESTAs being removed or their student visas removed for one game,” the president said.
5 mins research on the State Department website would tell him a) you cannot enter the US on an ESTA to study – you need a visa b) if you have a visa you don’t need (and won’t get if you apply for) a visa c) the Cuba visit rule only applies to entry on an ESTA. President Whittaker is either badly informed, or is trying to divert attention from the failure to obtain exemptions for the match visit or visas for the non-student players by angling at the sympathy vote – we couldn’t endanger the education of the players (which isn’t actually affected unless they are studying illegally in the US!).

That restriction has been in place since 2021 and is not exactly targeted at young Caymanians – or Caymanians at all. You may as well say the requirement to have a passport is an obstacle or block. Entirely foreseeable and easily resolvable – all they needed to do was obtain a waiver or get a visa, either of which could have been dome well before the competition. And some of the players apparently already have student visas, which would be in no way endangered by visiting Cuba, despite what

I thought travel to Cuba for sporting competition was one of the exemptions granted by the US Govt. You would have thought that many USA colleges would have done their homework on behalf of all of their students, and fully equipped them with the info, the process, and consequences, whether they were Americans or holders of student or work visas, including ESTAs. There might come a time that the USA has a fixture in Cuba, so I doubt they would forfeit. Just sounds like insufficient planning on the part of CIFA. Did CIFA not rely upon Concacaf guidance either ? Or maybe a 3-0 forfeit was always going to be a smaller defeat than actually playing there.

This only seems to effect persons using the ESTA system in their passport not a regular Visa. The UK is one of the passports where that is possible. A Caymanian passport is not so all citizens should get one and a Visa.
Note that an ESTA only works on scheduled commercial flights. So it is NO GOOD for travel on an emergency flight, e.g. Air ambulance, hurricane evacuation, etc.

Castro raised the country out of poverty when the revolution came and seized the wealthy landowners properties and dispersed them to the people. Millions learned to read too. The salty Cubans who fled to Miami were the oligarchs and rich landowners he targeted.

Castro refused to cower to the Americans and he called them out for their hypocrisy, oppression of the poor and institutional racism.

The U.S. chose to punish the Cubans with neverending embargos that continue to this day.

6:32, I have been all over Cuba 3 times in past 20 years. I saw poverty everywhere with collapsing buildings, subsistence farming and infrastructure collapse everywhere. You should take a visit there and see for yourself.

The people who are doing great are the Castro family and the people with close links to the highest levels of the Communist Party. They live a nice life with their nice summer homes in Spain. They are certainly not in poverty and the majority are millionaires.

Of course, that would not fit your narrative.

Bit confused because it seems we were aware Cuba was in our group from January, but only contacted the Department of Sports for potential assistance two months ago. Surely this also impacts Bermuda, Honduras, and Antigua and Barbuda, who likely have players with similar concerns. I assume they resolved their issues in a more timely manner?

Countries like Honduras may have players that play pro in the US, but they are not 21-year-olds attending college in the USA like many of the Cayman players are. The adults get a work visa and can travel wherever they want in the world. This only affects these smaller nations with a lot of under 23 players on their national roster that depend on the benefit their players receive by playing in the USA.
