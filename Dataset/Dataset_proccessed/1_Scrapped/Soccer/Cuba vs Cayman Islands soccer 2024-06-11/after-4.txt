Political complications force Cayman out of match with Cuba

Local football team caught in the crosshairs of US and Cuba travel ban

The Cayman men’s football team will forfeit their scheduled fixture against Cuba in the World Cup CONCACAF qualifiers due to travel restrictions – set by the US.

The call by the Cayman Islands Football Association to withdraw from the match takes the gloss off a brilliant start to the qualifying group with Cayman emerging victorious in a dramatic finish against Antigua and Barbuda on 8 June.

CIFA president Alfredo Whittaker told the Compass that the association had done everything in its power to persuade tournament organisers – CONCACAF – to move the game out of Cuba but instead, they were told that the decision was not theirs to make because Cuba is entitled to a home match.

The US has been cancelling ESTA visa waivers for anyone who has travelled to Cuba – a situation stemming from 2021 when the Trump administration placed Cuba back on its ‘sponsor of terrorism’ blacklist.

However, it is possible for Caymanians and residents to get full visas, but it is a lengthy and uncertain process that requires an in-person appointment in Jamaica. Obtaining a visa from the US Embassy there could take anywhere from 21 working days to three months from the date on which the application is received.

Risk to players’ student visas

The association knew the possible complications in facing Cuba since the group stage preliminary draw, which took place on 25 Jan. The particular challenge for this Cayman squad is that many of them are under-23 and on student visas to attend college in the US, but also have ESTA in their British passports.

Whittaker said the squad had discussed the options and decided they could not travel to Cuba.

“I don’t want to risk any of these boys’ ESTAs being removed or their student visas  removed for one game,” the president said.

Whittaker added that Cayman had been willing to play the game in the Dominican Republic but the Cubans wanted to keep their home fixture. He said he had contacted the Ministry of Sports and FIFA to find an alternative way to play the match.

A representative from the Ministry of Sports did confirm to the Compass that CIFA reached out two months ago, and the two parties tried to find a solution but were unsuccessful.

“This is bigger than the Cayman football association, they should not be blamed,” the ministry said.

The issue is one that transcends sports. Numerous Cayman Islands residents have found themselves blocked from travelling to the US because of prior travel to Cuba.

The Compass has sought clarity from Customs and Border Control over the issue and is awaiting a response.

With heavyweights Honduras off to a running start, thrashing Bermuda 6-1, qualification was always a long shot, although not impossible for Cayman, who is in a new era, according to new head coach Joey Jap Tjong.

Cayman’s next scheduled fixture in the World Cup CONCACAF qualifiers will be 4 June 2025 against Bermuda followed by Honduras on 7 June.

The US embargo and other restrictions on Cuba really needs to end! It’s such an embarrassing failure and only acts to harm the common people. Bullying over reach is what it amounts to.
