Officials with and supporters of Bay Football Club, the professional women’s soccer team that kicked off its inaugural season earlier this month, say they’re hopeful the third time’s the charm for the sport in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Bay FC’s debut in the National Women’s Soccer League, they said, already feels strikingly different from its predecessors, the now-defunct San Jose CyberRays and FC Gold Pride. Those clubs folded in 2003 and 2010, respectively, as did the leagues in which they played.
