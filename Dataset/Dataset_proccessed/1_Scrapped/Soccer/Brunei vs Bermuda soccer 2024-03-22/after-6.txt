You could say it was a tasteful event at the 2nd annual Men Who Cook event, where men put on their aprons, delved into their recipe books, and created some delicious dishes for the crowd to enjoy. 

Hundreds attended the event, held Thursday at the West Chambers Side Complex, and sampled the “celebrity” chef’s best cuisine. The event was presented by the Baytown Chamber of Commerce and ExxonMobil and also included a wine pull, a silent auction and live entertainment.
