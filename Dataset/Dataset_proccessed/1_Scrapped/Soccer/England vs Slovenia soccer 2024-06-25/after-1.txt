A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users.

Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections.

Euro 2024: England - Slovenia live text updates

England 0-0 Slovenia: full-time thoughts

Despite winning Group C, England’s status as favourite to win Euro 2024 has been thrown into doubt by three unconvincing performances, which have resulted in a win over Serbia and draws against Denmark and Slovenia.

Gareth Southgate’s side once again lacked the urgency required to break down the opposition defence, creating no more than a few half chances. They did inject some pace into their play on one or two occasions, most notably when Saka rounded off the best move of the first half from close range, only for Foden to be flagged offside in the build-up.

Other than that, late efforts from outside the box from Palmer and Alexander-Arnold were the best they could muster.

Slovenia, meanwhile, never tested Pickford at all, and were on the back foot for almost the entirety of the second half in particular. However, they defended resolutely, and rarely looked in danger of conceding and losing their spot in the last 16.

England 0-0 Slovenia: half-time thoughts

England were criticised for being too slow and ponderous in possession in their first two fixtures, and it was much of the same for long spells of the first half in Colonge.

They did inject some pace into their play on one or two occasions, most notably when Saka rounded off the best move of the half from close range, only for Foden to be flagged offside in the build-up.

Slovenia have defended relatively comfortably and ventured forward sporadically, without creating any clear-cut openings either.

Tripper's in-swinging cross from the left looks perfect for Gallagher, who misses his header in front of goal. Kane tries to react and launches himself at the ball, but also fails to connect. Goal kick.

A flurry of attacks from the Slovenians. Gnezda Cerin jinks into the box and floats up a cross, with Janza going down at the far post under next to no pressure from Saka. That's what you might call 'looking for it'.

We are still masters of our destiny, with all due respect to England, who are an outstanding team. This will be the biggest challenge for this generation of players. But I am sure it will not be the last. We have calmed the nerves after Serbia, we have analysed the positives and negatives from that match. We are ready.

Matjaz Kek, Slovenia coach

Southgate: "We haven't played the way we want to yet"

It's been good to have some time since the last game. We've been able to have more meetings and training time, but also talk with the players about the state of play at the moment: where we are, where our performances are, and we're all working together to try to improve that. We've got huge motivation. We haven't played the way we want to yet and we have the opportunity to win the group. That could be very important. Our motivation level is never in doubt, especially not for this game.

Slovenia suffer heartbreak against Serbia

Slovenia were within seconds of qualifying for the last 16 in their second group game against Serbia (although they didn't know it at the time).

After Erik Janza had secured a point in their opener against Denmark, they led through Zan Karnicnik's goal heading into injury time against the Serbs. However, Luka Jovic equalised in the 95th minute and means their fate will now come down to their last group game with England.

Lacklustre England display in Denmark draw

If Bellingham doesn't get you, the Harry Kane invariably will. And he did against Denmark, putting England 1-0 ahead inside 20 minutes. But things unravelled once again, with Southgate's men sitting back and not going for the kill. That ended up biting them on the bottom as the Danes equalised before half time, and they were unable to raise their game again in the second half. 

England fans in Frankfurt booed the team off, which tells you everything you need to know.

Bellingham the match-winner as England beat Serbia

Although my earlier post on England might've been a little downbeat, they have already qualified for the round of 16 with a game to spare, so it's not all doom and gloom. 

Jude Bellingham scored the only goal in their Group C opener against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on 20 June, and they rarely looked like being pegged back in that game. They rarely looked like adding to their lead either, which was disappointing considering the talent they have in the final third.

What's gone wrong for England so far at Euro 2024?

England were hyped up by many as one of the red-hot favourites to win the competition, alongside France. Which is ironic, as both teams have disappointed in equal measures. 

There is an argument to suggest The Three Lions' relative struggles have been as a result of Gareth Southgate's insistence of copying Didier Deschamps' "winning" formula of keeping things tight, limiting risks and using elite-level attacking players to make the different in attack. 

The issue is that, like with France, those attacking players haven't made much of an impact as a result of lethargic play in possession and overly cautious tactics after taking a 1-0 lead. 

Any chance of that changing against Slovenia, I wonder?
