Barbados face Bahamas on Saturday

Bahamas and Barbados will battle for three points in a CONCACAF Nations League fixture on Saturday. The hosts are coming into the game on the back of a 3-3 draw away to the US Virgin Islands on Wednesday.

They were 2-1 up at the break, with Lesly St. Fleur and Julmis Wood scoring either side of Naqwan Henry's 27th-minute goal. They went 3-1 up through Brandon Adderley's 58th-minute strike while Rakeem Joseph and Gabriel Catone-Highfield scored to ensure the spoils were shared.

Barbados, meanwhile, have not been in action since falling to a 3-1 defeat at home to Haiti in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier in June 2024. They were 2-0 down at the break, with Louicius Deedson and Duke Lacroix scoring for the Haitians. Niall Reid-Stephen halved the deficit in the 73rd minute but Bryan Labissiere made sure of the result with six minutes left on the clock.
