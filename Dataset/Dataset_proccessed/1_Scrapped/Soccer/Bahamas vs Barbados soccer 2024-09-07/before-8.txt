Six debutants on Concacaf Nations League roster
Barbados senior men's national team coach Kent Hall has called up six newcomers 
         Six new faces headline the recently announced Barbados senior men’s team roster for the upcoming fixtures of the Concacaf Nations League.
Barbados will compete in Group A of League C after suffering relegation from League B in the last edition of the competition.
Recently appointed Head Coach Kent Hall selected Barbados Soccer Academy duo Jaylan Gilkes and Khimani Cox, Canadian-based defender Nathan Walters, United States collegiate pair Nathan Sealy and Justin Griffith and former University of the West Indies (UWI) Blackbirds winger Justin White.
   After their most recent results of 4-1 versus Curacao and 3-1 against Haiti in the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, Barbados has an opportunity to turn their fortunes around.The Tridents are the highest ranked team in the group at 177th, followed by the Bahamas who are ranked 203rd and the United States Virgin Islands  who are just five places below the Bahamas, therefore all attention and expectations are on them to win the group and earn promotion to League B.
  There are some notable absences who have been a part of the national programme for a lengthy time, players such as Akeem Hill, Elijah Downey and Jomo Harris. Along with recent call-ups who would have made an impact such as Nadre Butcher and Rommel Bynoe are also out of this specific assignment.
  Barbados will kickoff their 2024-25 Nations League campaign versus the Bahamas on Saturday (7-9-24) evening at 4 pm at the Bethlehem Soccer Stadium in St Croix.
