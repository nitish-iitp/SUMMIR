Tridents face "Baha Boyz" today in Concacaf Nations League

A youthful Barbados' contingent will take on the Bahamas today in Concacaf Nations League, League C action in St Croix.

Renaldo GilkesSeptember 7, 2024 12:41 PM ET
Barbados will face Bahamas this evening at 4 pm in their first match of the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League.

Barbados ‘journey to restoration on the football circuit begins today, as they kickoff their 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League campaign.

The Tridents take on regional neighbours Bahamas today at 4 pm at the Bethlehem Soccer Stadium in St. Croix in their opening encounter of League C Group A.

Barbados is competing in the bottom tier of the Concacaf competition after being demoted last season, following six successive defeats in League B.

Tridents unbeaten in CFU U14 Challenge Series

August 19, 2024 05:03 PM ET

Since those unfavourable results a new coach has arrived, our first local one since the appointment of Colin “Heavy Foot” Harewood in 2015.

Recently appointed Head Coach Kent Hall, like Harewood, a former national midfielder, has been offered the opportunity and accepted the responsibility of resurrecting the senior men’s team and more specifically, getting back into League B of the Concacaf Nations League.

Sheran Hoyte (right) and Zach Applewhite compete during a training session ahead of their duel with the Bahamas.

One may consider this an easy task, as the Tridents fall fortunately in a group with lower ranked countries Bahamas (203rd) and the United States Virgin Islands (208th), but international football has proven not to be as predictable as it appears.

Barbados won’t want to take any team lightly at this stage, for the memory of losing to Montserrat twice in the last Nations League campaign is still quite fresh.

Despite the 26 places between Barbados and Bahamas, they are some similarities between the teams.

Barbados has not won in eight matches, while Bahamas have been equally starved of success, with their last victory being 13 games ago versus St Vincent & the Grenadines in 2022.

Nicoli Brathwaite receives a pass during a training session ahead of today's encounter.

They are also both quite generous with their defending.  Barbados has conceded 33 goals in their last eight matches and Bahamas just one less than the Tridents.

Bahamas opening game in the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League revealed instances of their defensive woes.  After taking a two-goal lead, they succumbed to a last run of pressure from home team USVI which saw them concede twice in 10 minutes and had to settle for a 3-3 draw.

Coach Hall has selected a balanced unit of who is available to him, and he has seemingly rewarded consistency and work ethic.

These variables have seen debut call-ups for forward Khimani Cox, midfielder Jaylan Gilkes, defensive duo Nathan Sealy and Nathan Walters and United States-based winger Justin White.

It will be interesting to see the construct of the team as Hall has selected players who can function in various roles, perhaps intentionally, seeing that there is another opponent waiting in the wing just two days later.

Head Coach Kent Hall (right) and Manager Ortis Williams.

Defensively Barbados has been subpar, but they can feel more assured with the return of right back Carl Hinkson, also Hall has the option of playing captain Andre Applewhaite as a center back, as opposed to his favoured left back position, or give Altitude FC center back Walters a start on his debut.

The midfield options are more straight forward, with options such as Hadan Holligan, Ethan Taylor and the ever-consistent Niall Reid Stephen.  However, Hall may have filled the void of a holding midfielder via the selection of Gilkes; his composure in possession, passing ability and bravery can serve the Tridents well going forward not just in this competition but beyond.

Offensively, we have struggled in the recent past, and a lot of goal-scoring responsibility will fall on the shoulders of Reid-Stephen who scored in Barbados’ last two outings.  He is also the most senior of the attacking guard, with Cox and Khalil Vanderpool-Nurse only having junior international experience.

Weymouth Wales custodian Khismar Primus has found favour with the selectors again and is likely to start between the sticks ahead of teenagers Jireh Malcolm and Justin Griffith.

The last time these two teams met, Barbados were 2-1 victors in the 2006 Caribbean Cup.  Goals were scored by Youth Milan duo Norman Forde and Kenroy Skinner.

Prediction: 3-1 (Barbados)
