Portugal player ratings vs Croatia: No Ronaldo, no party! CR7 forced to watch on as Roberto Martinez's toothless Selecao fall to concerning defeat in Euro 2024 warm-up

Friendlies

The Al-Nassr star was an unused substitute as one of the favourites this summer in Germany slipped to a disappointing loss

In their penultimate warm-up game before Euro 2024, Portugal went toe-to-toe with another potential dark horse at the tournament in Croatia, but were ultimately undone by their own profligacy. Roberto Martinez made some bold selections - particularly when it came to leaving Cristiano Ronaldo out - but Portugal struggled to find any fluency throughout.

Croatia were awarded a penalty within six minutes, as Mateo Kovacic was fouled in the box by Vitinha. Luka Modric stepped up and scored, smashing his effort into the bottom corner.

At half-time, Martinez rang the changes and Nelson Semedo and Diogo Jota, two subs, combined, as the right-back fed the Liverpool star, and he tapped in just two minutes after the restart.

Ante Budimir hit back quickly, though; Diogo Costa brilliantly tipped Mario Pasalic's shot onto the crossbar but the rebound was headed in by the opportunistic striker.

It was a performance characterised by Portugal having plenty of the ball, doing nothing with it, and relying on Diogo Costa in goal to bail them out at the other end. On another day, they may have lost much more convincingly.

Goalkeeper & Defence

Diogo Costa (7/10):

Went the right way for Modric's penalty but it was too firmly struck to save. Made some excellent saves to keep Portugal in it. So unlucky for Budimir's goal, as he made a brilliant save initially and was let down by the rebound off the crossbar. Despite the scoreline, probably Portugal's best player.

Diogo Dalot (4/10):

Drifted away from his right-back position far too often. Subbed at half-time. A poor showing.

Ruben Dias (6/10):

Put his body on the line when needed. A reliable operator even if he was stretched on the counter more than he is used to.

Goncalo Inacio (5/10):

Very front-footed in his defending, regularly stepping into midfield, which often left Dias needing to cover. Maybe that's tactical, but it can be alarming to watch.

Nuno Mendes (5/10):

Couldn't press forward as he wanted as he was closely marked by Croatia. Frustrating. Subbed at half-time.

Midfield

Vitinha (5/10):

Conceded an early penalty after fouling Kovacic in the area. Struggled to keep pace with the game, particularly out of possession.

Joao Palhinha (4/10):

Nowhere near Modric in midfield throughout his time on the pitch. Completely outclassed by the Real Madrid legend.

Bruno Fernandes (7/10):

Worked tirelessly, getting up and down the pitch. Was a blade of grass away from equalising, as his long-range shot zipped just wide. Substituted on 70 minutes; comfortably Portugal's best outfield player, and their best chance of winning Euro 2024.

Attack

Bernardo Silva (5/10):

Always involved. Some lovely touches but as frustrated as his team-mates.

Goncalo Ramos (5/10):

A potent frontman and a physical specimen but struggled to carve out a chance. Subbed at half-time.

Joao Felix (4/10):

Peripheral in the first half before his substitution. Couldn't cut in and get on the ball, where he can hurt teams. His anonymity was a key reason why Portugal couldn't get a shot on target in the first half.

Subs & Manager

Diogo Jota (6/10):

On at half-time for Ramos. Scored within two minutes, tapping home after Semedo's cross. Less physical than Ramos, but some lovely interplay with his fellow attackers.

Rafael Leao (5/10):

On at the interval for Felix. Such a gifted wide-man but seemed too timid in the final third; maybe he's saving himself for the tournament proper.

Joao Cancelo (6/10):

On at half-time for Mendes. More dynamic than his countryman, even finding himself in the penalty area on occasion.

Nelson Semedo (6/10):

Replaced Dalot at half-time and immediately made an impact, assisting Jota with a fine cross. Did okay during his time on the pitch, and is more positionally disciplined than the man he replaced.

Pedro Neto (5/10):

Came on for Bruno Fernandes. Nowhere near as effective as the Manchester United star.

Matheus Nunes (N/A):

A late introduction.

Roberto Martinez (4/10):

This was deeply concerning for the former Belgium boss. Portugal didn't have a shot on target in the first half and only clicked for a five-minute period. He still seems to be working out his best team, and that doesn't bode well for Euro 2024.
