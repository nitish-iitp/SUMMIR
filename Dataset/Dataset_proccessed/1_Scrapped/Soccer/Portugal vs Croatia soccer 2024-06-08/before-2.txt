Preview: Portugal vs. Croatia - prediction, team news, lineups

Portugal will continue their preparations for this summer's European Championship with a glamour friendly against fellow Euro 2024 participants Croatia on Saturday evening.

Roberto Martinez's side recorded a 4-2 victory over Finland last time out, while Croatia will enter the contest off the back of a 3-0 win over North Macedonia.

Martinez's record since arriving as Portugal head coach after the 2022 World Cup reads 12 wins and one draw from 13 matches, and the 50-year-old will be bidding to guide his side to success at Euro 2024.

France and England are regarded by many as the favourites for the tournament, but Portugal simply cannot be discounted due to the quality and experience in their squad, and they know what it takes to win the competition, having lifted the trophy back in 2016.

The Iberian nation were knocked out in the last-16 stage of Euro 2020 before making the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup, and it would be a surprise if they did not advance deep into this competition.

Portugal will face Czech Republic, Turkey and Georgia in Group F at Euro 2024, with their opening match coming against the former on June 18.

Before then, Martinez's side will tackle Croatia and the Republic of Ireland in friendly matches, and they will enter this match off the back of a 4-2 success over Finland on Tuesday night.

Croatia, meanwhile, were 3-0 winners over North Macedonia on Monday, and the clash with Portugal will represent their final fixture before opening their Euro 2024 campaign.

Zlatko Dalic's side will play in Group B, beginning their challenge against Spain on June 15, before facing Albania and Italy in their final two games of what is a very difficult group.

Croatia will bring a five-game winning run into this match, including successes in their last three friendlies against Tunisia, Egypt and North Macedonia.

The Checkered Ones have never been past the quarter-final stage of a European Championship, achieving a last-eight spot in 1996 and 2008, and they were knocked out in the round of 16 at Euro 2020.

Croatia finished third at the 2022 World Cup, though, and they will be expecting to be present in the knockout round, even if it means qualifying as one of the best third-placed finishers.

Cristiano Ronaldo was not involved in Portugal's 4-2 win over Finland last time out, but the Al-Nassr forward is expected to be in the squad for this match and should start.

Head coach Martinez will make changes from the side that started Tuesday's contest, with Diogo Costa, Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot all in line for starts.

The fact that Portugal have one more friendly after this before beginning Euro 2024 means that Martinez will utilise his squad once again, but Antonio Silva and Ruben Dias should continue in the middle of the defence.

As for Croatia, Dalic's team is taking shape for the European Championship, so it would not be a surprise to see close to the same XI that started against North Macedonia.

There should again be changes at the interval, but the likes of Mateo Kovacic, Ivan Perisic and Andrej Kramaric are in line to keep their spots in the side.

There is expected to be a notable alteration at the back, though, with Josko Gvardiol, who was not involved in the clash with North Macedonia, set to come into the starting side.


Portugal possible starting lineup:
Costa; Dalot, A Silva, Dias, Cancelo; Fernandes, Palhinha, Bernardo; Jota, Ronaldo, Leao

Croatia possible starting lineup:
Livakovic; Juranovic, Vida, Gvardiol, Sosa; Baturina, Kovacic; Majer, Kramaric, Perisic; Petkovic



We say: Portugal 2-1 Croatia

Portugal are unbeaten in their seven previous games with Croatia, and we are expecting that run to be extended this weekend. Three of Portugal's last four wins over Croatia have been by the odd goal, and we are predicting a narrow success for Martinez's team in this glamour international friendly.
