The organizers of the LPBank CUP 2024 have officially confirmed the cancellation of the International ‘A’ Match between Russia and Thailand.

In light of the severe weather conditions, the Vietnamese government issued travel restrictions, prompting the tournament organizers to hold an emergency meeting. After discussions, it was determined that the match should be canceled for the safety of everyone involved. Initially, the organizers proposed postponing the game to September 8. However, the Russian national team informed the organizers that due to political circumstances, Russian flights require special permission to fly, making it impossible to reschedule the match.

The organizers will notify FIFA that the cancellation was due to force majeure, meaning that the rankings for the match between Thailand and Russia will not be affected.

Despite this cancellation, the match between the Thai national team and Vietnam, scheduled for September 10, 2024, at 8:00 p.m., will proceed as planned. This match will be classified as an International ‘A’ Match, with FIFA ranking points being counted.
