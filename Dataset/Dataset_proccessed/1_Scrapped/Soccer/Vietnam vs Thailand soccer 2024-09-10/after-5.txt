Tuesday, 23:04, 10/09/2024
VOV.VN - Hosts Vietnam lost 1-2 to visitors Thailand in a LPBank Cup friendly match at My Dinh National Stadium on September 10 evening despite their first goal.
Vietnamese players (in red jersey) find it difficult to score goals in front of the Thai defence line.

Striker Tien Linh gave Vietnam the lead before the Thai players equalized and then went on to take the lead in the end.

The Vietnamese striker did not hit the ball much at the start of the match but took full advantage of his first scoring chance. In the 21st minute, the striker broke through two Thai defenders and finished accurately, beating goalkeeper Khammai.

Thailand earned an equalizer five minutes later. After a teammate’s assist, Suphanat headed the ball from close range, giving goalkeeper Nguyen Filip no chance to save it.

In a tightly contested match, Vietnamese defenders made a surprising mistake. In the 41st minute, Hong Duy’s failed clearance presented an opportunity for Patrik Gustavsson to score from close range, extending Thailand’s lead.

The first half ended with a promising chance for midfielder Quang Hai. However, his shot was not difficult enough to beat goalkeeper Khammai.

After the break, coach Kim Sang-sik made some changes to the lineup by sending in Van Thanh and Vy Hao, and sending out hung Dung and Xuan Manh.

Through the Vietnamese players carved out several scoring chances, they failed in the end.

The hosts pushed their formation too high and nearly paid the price in the 88th minute. Channarong raced down to face the goalkeeper but placed his shot wide.

Thailand extended their unbeaten streak away from home against Vietnam for the past nearly 20 years.

This is Vietnam’s second loss in the tripartite football tournament as part of FIFA Days 2024. On September 5, they lost 0-3 to Russia.
