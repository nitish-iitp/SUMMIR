Thailand have not lost this fixture since 2019

Vietnam host Thailand at the Mỹ Đình National Stadium in Hanoi on Tuesday for the 2024 LPBank Cup, looking for a win to salvage some pride. The Golden Star Warriors suffered a heavy loss in their first game against Russia, which inflicted a 3-0 loss upon them.

Daler Kuzyayev opened the scoring for the National Team after 24 minutes before an own goal from Vu Van Thanh after the hour mark doubled their advantage. Tamerlan Musayev then added a third to consolidate their win and sink their hosts further.

The loss was their eighth of the year from nine games, compounding an already miserable run. With the 2024 Tri-Nations Series and 2024 ASEAN Championship coming up, the Southeast Asian side must really step up now.

On the other hand, Thailand will be playing their first game here after their clash with Russia was canceled due to the threat of Typhoon Yagi.

The War Elephants have also struggled this year, winning just two of their nine games. One of them came at the 2023 AFC Asian Cup group stages as they beat Kyrgyzstan 2-0 in their opening match, while they also saw off Singapore in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in their last official clash.

Vietnam vs Thailand Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been 28 clashes between the southeast Asian neighbors, with Thailand winning on 17 occasions and losing just thrice.
The Golden Star Warriors last beat the War Elephants in June 2019 in the King's Cup.
In the last six games between the sides, four have ended in stalemates.
Thailand have won just twice from nine games this year but also lost only thrice. Their opponents, though, have seen eight defeats in nine outings.
The Golden Star Warriors have conceded at least thrice in their last two games and at least twice in their last four.
Vietnam vs Thailand Prediction

The hosts of the event have been in terrible form this year, as their results show. Russia had no issues dispatching them, and we do not expect the War Elephants to struggle as they put Vietnam to the sword.

Prediction: Vietnam 0-2 Thailand
