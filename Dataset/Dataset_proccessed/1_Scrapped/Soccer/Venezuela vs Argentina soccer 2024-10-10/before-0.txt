When it comes to major international honours, there is no comparison at all between the might of Argentina, and the minimal achievements of Venezuela.

La Vinotinto have never even reached a World Cup, while the Albiceleste have won three of them, but there is no disputing Venezuela are becoming a more competitive outfit, and have provided Argentina with quite a very problems in recent years, despite once having a hopeless record against the their fellow South Americans.

Here, Sports Mole takes an in-depth look at the head-to-head record and previous meetings between the two sides.

Head-to-head record

Previous meetings: 29
Venezuela wins: 2
Draws: 3
Argentina wins: 24

As often the whipping boys of CONMEBOL, Venezuela have very rarely tasted success against Argentina, and the earliest meetings between the two all went in one direction.

Between the first meeting in 1956 up until 2011, Argentina won all 19 of their encounters with Venezuela, conceding just 10 goals, and scoring a staggering 77, averaging just over four goals-per-game.

However, times changed in the eight years following that dismal run for Venezuela, as they lost just two of the following six meetings.

The turning point came in a 2011 World Cup qualifier, when Fernando Amorebieta scored the only goal to hand Venezuela their first, and to date, only, competitive win over Argentina.

A 2019 friendly in Madrid also ended in a Venezuela victory, as the likes of Lionel Messi and Lautaro Martinez were stunned in a 3-1 defeat.

The 2018 World Cup proved difficult for Argentina to qualify for, as they limped over the line late in the section, partly thanks to dropping four points against Venezuela across the lengthy qualifying campaign.

Venezuela finished last on that occasion, but Argentina needed a late Nicolas Otamendi equaliser to salvage a point on the road after going 2-0 down, and they also briefly trailed at home, before drawing 1-1.

On the big occasion, though, Argentina have come out on top, as they met in the quarter-finals of the Copa America in 2016 and 2019, with the Albiceleste reigning supreme in both.

A 4-1 win in 2016 saw Messi steal the show with a goal and two assists - a goal which at the time brought him level with Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina's highest goalscorer.

Three years later, just months after losing that friendly in Madrid, Argentine ensured there were no repeats, with Lautaro Martinez and Giovani Lo Celso scoring in a 2-0 win.

Argentina completed the double over Venezuela on their way to a comfortable qualification for the finals in Qatar, which ultimately ended in glory for the Albiceleste, but in their most recent meeting in 2026 World Cup qualification, Lionel Scaloni's side were frustrated by an ever-improving Venezuela side, who held them to a 1-1 draw in Maturin.
