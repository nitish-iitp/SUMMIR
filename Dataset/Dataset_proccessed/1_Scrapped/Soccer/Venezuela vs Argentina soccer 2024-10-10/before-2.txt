Lamine Yamal, one of Barcelona’s most promising young talents, is currently focused on his commitments with the Spanish national team as they prepare for their upcoming fixtures. In an interview with “Radiogaceta” on RNE, Yamal reflected on his progress this season, especially after his performance against Alavés.

Confidence and Freedom Under Flick’s Leadership

Yamal expressed his satisfaction with the style of play introduced by coach Hansi Flick, highlighting the sense of freedom and confidence that the team experiences on the field. “We are happy with the style of play that the ‘mister’ provides us, along with the freedom and trust he gives us, especially when it comes to winning,” Yamal said, clearly appreciating the balance between structured play and creative freedom.

Personal Performance and High Standards

Despite his positive outlook on the team’s approach, Yamal is critical of his own recent performances. “I wasn’t satisfied with my performance; I believe I could have played better. I always hold myself to high standards,” he admitted, demonstrating a desire for continuous improvement and setting the bar high for himself.

Life Changes and Rising Recognition

Since his breakout at Euro 2024, Yamal’s life has undergone significant changes. “Everything has become more complicated. I can’t go out with my mother as often because people recognize us everywhere,” he shared, highlighting the challenges that come with fame at such a young age.

Admiration for Iniesta and Support for Carvajal

During the interview, Yamal also expressed admiration for football legend Andrés Iniesta, though he admitted that he was too young to fully remember Iniesta’s iconic goal in the 2010 World Cup final. “He’s a true legend of the sport, and his retirement will be a huge loss for football,” Yamal said, reflecting on Iniesta’s legacy.

Finally, Yamal sent his thoughts and support to his fellow national team player Dani Carvajal, who is currently sidelined with an injury. “Carvajal’s injury is very sad for the national team and football in general,” he remarked, wishing his teammate a speedy recovery.
