A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Venezuela 1-1 Argentina: summary, score, goals, highlights CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers

Venezuela - Argentina: As it happened.

Venezuela hold Argentina in crazy conditions.

The World Cup qualifier between Venezuela and Argentina looked in danger of being postponed ahead of kick-off as groundstaff struggled to clear standing water on the field. The start time was pushed back by 30 minutes to give the Estadio Monumental greater chance to drain but, when the game was able to begin, the on-field action was predictably scrappy. 

The two goals were produced by crosses into the box. The first was an Argentina corner kick that landed at the feet of Nicolas Otamendi, who poked the ball home from close range. The second, a clever clipped cross from Yeferson Soteldo that was powered into the back of the net by Salomon Rondon. 

The game ends all square, although Venezuela will feel that they actually generated the better chances.

As we head into the final 15 minutes of the 90, it's difficult to know which way this will go. 

Venezuela have been a more consistent threat with the aerial dominance of Salomon Rondon. But Argentina have shown flashes of quality.

They may be ahead, but Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni must be considering a half time substitution. Their fleet-footed frontline of Lionel Messi, Julian Alvarez and Thiago Almada are struggling to get into the game in these sodden conditions. 

Someone like Lautaro Martinez, a more physical presence, might act as a better focal point.

The visitors lead! Lionel Messi curls in a cross from the left and Venezuela can't clear it. Goalkeeper Rafa Romo comes out to punch but it lands at the feet of Otamendi, who pokes the ball home.

Good play from Thiago Almada to drift in from the left flank and fire a low shot on goal. It's well-hit, but is blocked by a diving Venezuelan defender.

Both teams are getting caught on the ball in the defence when it gets stuck in the standing water on the surface. Fortunately, neither attack is able to take advantage because the same happens to them.

Argentina enjoy their first spell of considered possession. They've got the hang of the tactic now, clipping passes off the ground to their intended target.

Rodrigo de Paul is lucky to avoid a booking for hacking down Jose Martinez on the halfway line. It's going to be that type of game.

Venezuela try to play a few passes around in the midfield, forced to play most of the passes off the ground to prevent the ball getting stuck. 

You sense that Argentina are not too happy with these conditions.

Every single stride is met with huge splashes and standing water spray from the sodden turf.

This is crazy. The rainwater is still having a huge affect on the ball and players are having to flick the ball off the ground with each touch, just to get it to move.

Pitch update: Still not great.

The surface has certainly improved after another 30 minutes of strenuous work from the Venezuelan groundstaff but it's far from perfect. There are areas where standing water is visible. On one half, in particular. 

Nevertheless, it looks like we're nearly ready for the off.

Flooded pitch threatens Venezuela - Argentina.

So, to recap. 

Heavy rainfall for much of the day has seen standing water gather on the surface at the Estadio Monumental in Maturin, Venezuela. There have been plenty of groundstaff working on the turf in the last hour of so but they are struggling to shift the water. 

A pre-game test found that the ball would not freely roll on the surface, forcing officials to delay the kickoff for 30 minutes. However some - reportedly including Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni - are now wondering whether this game can be played today.

Lionel Scaloni unhappy with conditions at Estadio Monumental.

Argentina insider Gaston Edul reports that the Argentina head coach does not believe that the game will be played today. There's certainly a lot of water just below the surface, preventing a true roll of the ball across the turf.

POSTED AT: 17:15 EDT 10/10/2024

Venezuela - Argentina delayed for 30 minutes.

The latest news from the Estadio Monumental suggests that the game will be able to go ahead at 5:30pm ET, half an hour later than initially planned. 

That's the current estimate, but it's difficult to see how the pitch can be sufficiently dried in the next 18 minutes. Things are still pretty damp down there.

When will Venezuela - Argentina begin?

The good news is that the rain in Maturin, Venezuela has now stopped. 

The bad news is that the surface still seems to be completely sodden, despite the best efforts of around 15 people with brooms and rollers. Officials are testing the surface by rolling a ball around but it's getting bogged down in the turf. 

Central areas look particularly affected.

All hands on deck at the Estadio Monumental.

There's at least a dozen members of the groundstaff out on the field with rollers and brooms, desperately trying to disperse the areas of heavy rainwater. The skies do look to be clearing now, but the on-field conditions are not great.

Work underway at Estadio Monumental to prepare the surface.

The groundstaff at the Estadio Monumental has had a real battle on their hands to ensure that Venezuela - Argentina goes off as planned today. Periods of heavy rain left standing water on the field but it looks like they've managed to keep the pitch in good playing condition. 

Not long to go until kickoff now.

Can Lionel Messi add to incredible Argentina record?

Of course, he's starting. Lionel Messi never turns down the chance to represent his country and retains home of leading Argentina into the 2026 World Cup. 

Of the course of his stellar international career, Messi has played 187 games, scored 109 goals and provided 58 assists for his teammates. Oh, and he's won two Copa America and the World Cup.

We're expecting a full house at the Estadio Monumental but the crowds will have to withstand some pretty bleak conditions as rain pours down in Maturin. There were umbrella's aplenty as the first fans arrived at the venue. 

Nevertheless, officials have confirmed that today's game will go ahead at the scheduled kickoff time.

Argentina’s Hurricane Milton odyssey: All plans in doubt

Hurricane Milton remains a real threat to parts of the Southern United States and it had a real bearing on Argentina's preparations for the game against Venezuela. They were based at a training camp in Miami earlier this week and were forced to alter their travel arrangements.

Lionel Scaloni reveals Messi fitness status and gives hurricane update

Being the head coach of the Argentina national team can't be easy, but things have got even tougher for Lionel Scaloni this week. Not only has he had to contend with Hurricane Milton at their base in Miami, his team's travel plans have been affected by political tensions. 

“We can’t land directly in Maturín. We’ll have to make a stopover since flights from U.S. soil aren’t allowed to land directly in Venezuela. These are things beyond our control, just bad luck. The most important thing is the safety of everyone here and the well-being of the people affected by the hurricane,” Scaloni explained.
