New Caledonia looks set to claim another Pacific Games overall title as they consolidated their lead at the top of the medal tally.

The French territory has won 13 out of the last 16 editions of the Games, with Papua New Guinea winning twice (1991, 2015) and Fiji once (1963 - inaugural).

They lead in Honiara with 62 gold medals and a total haul of 142 - currently standing at 33 gold medals clear of second placed Australia, who have 29, and 35 gold medals clear off Samoa in third place.

Another French territory Tahiti is on fourth place with 25 gold medals while Fiji has 12 gold to show for what they have achieved so far.

Niue and Tokelau are the only countries yet to win any medals at the Games.

Tonga leads netball campaign with two wins

The Tongan Tala netball team lead the netball competition at the 2023 Pacific Games with two wins from two games as the sport rolled off matches in Honiara on Monday.

The world number eight thrashed Niue 90-17 in the morning before holding off a Papua New Guinea comeback in their second game on Monday afternoon to win 62-54.

Goal-shooter Unique Palavi led the Friendly Islanders scoring, dominating in the circles in both matches.

Tonga Netball chief executive officer Salote Sisifa said the wins was what they needed to kick start their campaign for gold at the Games.

"Grateful to the team for the wins. They played their hearts out there and to close the day with two wins is more than we can ask for," she said.

The Cook Islanders started their title defense with a strong performance, thrashing Vanuatu 84 -13 in their opener.

In Pool B the Fiji Pearls annihilated a spirited host side 90-25.

Local fans did not worry about the scoresheet as they cheered each and every point the team managed to net.

Samoa also started well with a big win over Norfolk Islands 73-14.

All matches in Honiara contribute to the World Netball rankings for participating teams.

Competition continues on Tuesday.

Karan wins 10,000 gold

Fiji's Pacific Mini Games gold medalist, Yeshnil Karan, claimed the old in the men's 10,000m event.

He clocked an impressive time of 32 minutes 32.30 seconds.

Karan pulled away from the pack right from the opening rounds and kept his momentum going until the final dash home.

But he was not able to break the Games record of 30:30:96s set by former New Caledonian runner Alain Lazare at the 1989 South Pacific Mini Games in Nukualofa, Tonga.

Guam's Hugh Kent won silver in a time of 33:48:60s.

Kent overtook the pack as he tried to stick close to Karan.

He told the Pacific Games News Service that he was excited to win silver.

"I'm very excited right now even though I can't feel anything, I'm very numb after the race. I did not expect to have received the results and win silver tonight," he said.

"Overall, I wasn't thinking of my pace and what placement I was at. My idea was just to stick with the others, and once I saw they settled down, and I felt comfortable only then would I go. I was waiting for Karan to come over and overlap me, and from there I had someone to stick with in pace and it was very motivating."

The 17-year-old also said winning silver in his first ever Pacific Games debut is a confidence-boosting start to his remaining events at Sol2023.

"This is my first Pacific Games, and I don't usually run on a track for 10k. However, this win has really boosted my confidence and motivated me to win more medals in my upcoming races. I'm participating in the 5000 meters, which is usually what I'm comfortable in, and the half marathon."

The bronze went to Papua New Guinea's Dilu Goiye Bob, with a time of 33:57.08s.
