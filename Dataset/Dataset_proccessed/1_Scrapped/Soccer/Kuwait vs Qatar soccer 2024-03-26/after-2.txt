WHAT HAPPENED?

Videos emerged on social media seemingly showing the teenager celebrating in night clubs after Ecuador beat Guatemala 2-0 in an international friendly - as The Daily Mail reports. The video has sparked controversy because the law in the United States forbids anyone under the age of 21 being present at such clubs.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

The Ecuadorian Football Federation (FEF) has confirmed that the players were given free time after their recent win but the governing body has condemned the footage and warned players they face suspension if they repeat the behaviour.

WHAT ECUADOR SAID

A statement read: "Given the facts of public knowledge, the FEF expresses the following: The official delegation had free time on Friday, March 22, from 2pm to 8.30pm, a schedule that was fully complied with. Images of events contrary to the values and principles that we defend and promote as an institution have been disseminated, which will be the subject of analysis for future calls. We reiterate our commitment to Ecuadorian soccer."

WHAT NEXT?

Following the controversy, Paez will return to Ecuador to continue his development with Independiente del Valle before he leaves to join Chelsea when he turns 18 years old in 2025.
