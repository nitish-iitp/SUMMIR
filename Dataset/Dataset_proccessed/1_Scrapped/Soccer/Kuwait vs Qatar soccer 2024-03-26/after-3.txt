KEEP AN EYE ON THEM

In the next meeting, the players to watch will be Rodrigo Huescas for Mexico and Valentín Barco for Argentina. Huescas, recognized for his outstanding performance with Cruz Azul in Liga MX, is emerging as a promising player for the Mexican senior national team, while Barco, a talented left back, represents a hope for the Albiceleste and is projected as a future player in Europe. These two players are the ones to watch out for tomorrow's match.

BACKED UP

On Friday, Andres Lillini, who is Mexico's Director of Youth National Teams, made a statement after El Tri's U-23 team lost to Argentina in a friendly match in Mazatlan. During the conference, Lillini addressed a question related to Emilio Lara, a player who made certain mistakes in the 2-4 loss to the Albicelestes.
"I think Emilio has very good conditions. I think that sometimes we, the clubs, the national team, are responsible for accompanying a player's process... because I say, they are not footballers, they are human beings. Many lose their heads, there are some who drop out of college, others who make other decisions in their lives."

A POSITIVE VISION

Likewise, Andres Lillini said that despite this bad result, they must work on correcting as a whole and that no one should be left alone in this beginning of the process. 
"We do not have to abandon anyone in the process, we have to correct them. We do not discover players, we accompany the formative processes and make the player better. Between all of us, we have to improve the player's shortcomings, whether they are soccer or non-football.

ABOUT THE LAST GAME

Mexico failed to adapt to the atmosphere of 'El Encanto', where a solid South American team shone. Unfortunately, they let the victory slip away, and the Argentinean National Team scored a resounding victory over Mexico U-23. This friendly match ahead of Paris 2024 highlighted the Mexican team's lack of effectiveness on the field. The Mexican U-23 National Team suffered the consequences of its own mistakes in Mazatlan and ended up being defeated in a resounding manner (2-4) by Argentina.

Watch out for this Argentina U-23 player

The player to watch for this match will be Pablo Solari, the Argentinean who plays in the midfield or in the forward zone has become a fundamental piece of the team coached by Javier Mascherano, Solari has great skills to carry the ball close to the foot and at the same time dribble the defenders like cones to generate spaces and look for the goal in favor of Argentina.

Watch out for this Mexico U-23 player

The player to watch for this match will be Ramón Juárez del Castillo, the central defender who plays for the América Eagles is one of the most experienced elements on the field, as the fact of playing for the current champion of Mexican soccer, where he has seen activity and has performed well, has earned him the trust of his teammates. Ramón also has a great capacity to be a leader in the defensive zone.

Seeking to even things out

The Argentinean team wants to repeat the dose of medicine they used to beat the Mexican team to add another victory, this time in the city of the Angelópolis. Last game, Argentina was able to recover after letting a two-goal lead slip away in the last minutes of the first half, however, the Albiceleste were able to recover and take the first victory of these two preparation games for the current CONMEBOL representative in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. However, the statistics on Mexican soil favor the home team, since out of 3 games played in Mexico, 2 victories have been in favor of El Tri and one in favor of the South Americans (the most recent being on March 22), so if they win this game in Puebla, the balance of power will be in their favor.

There are errors to be corrected

Ricardo Cadena's Mexican U-23 national team could not pass the first test in Mazatlan, the Mexican team started very well the last match against the "albiceleste", having control of ball possession and not giving opportunities for the Argentines to offend the Mexican goal, however, a series of mistakes and good South American successes ended up putting Javier Mascherano's team 0-2 up on the scoreboard. After that, Mexico did not give up and with goals from Etson Ayon and Jordan Carrillo tied the game to go to the locker room with an exciting 2-2, however, the second half would bring the same story of the first with a different outcome, because again the mistakes took their toll on Mexico with 2 goals from the visitors, however, this time the Mexican team had no reaction, losing at home and with their people.

Another reunion

After having met at the "El Encanto" Stadium, Mexico and Argentina U-23s will meet again in a friendly match at the Cuauhtémoc Stadium for the Albiceleste team led by Javier Mascherano to close ranks in their preparation for Paris 2024. This will also be an opportunity for the Mexican squad to avenge the previous game where they lost by a score of 2-4, leaving a bad feeling in the project led by Ricardo Cadena, as it should be remembered that the Mexican national team will not be present at the Olympic Games, so the U-23 team will not see any activity until the call for players is reopened to face the qualification for the next Olympic Games.
