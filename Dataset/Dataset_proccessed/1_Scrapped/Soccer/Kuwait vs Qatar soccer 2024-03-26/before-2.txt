Preview: Morocco vs. Mauritania - prediction, team news, lineups

Morocco will look to make it two successive victories when they face Mauritania at Adrar Stadium on Tuesday night.

Both sides were present at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and both exited the competition in the round of 16.

Morocco returned to the pitch for the first time since the 2-0 defeat to South Africa in the AFCON 2023 round of 16, facing Angola on Friday.

However, a David Carmo own goal in the 72nd minute secured a win for the Atlas Lions, suggesting they are still struggling to rediscover the form that saw them reach a historic World Cup semi-final in 2022.

With qualification for the 2025 AFCON already secured as hosts, Walid Regragui's team will hope the friendlies and 2026 World Cup qualifiers will help them prepare for a strong showing in the Nations Cup on home soil.

The North Africans will get another chance to make a statement when they face Mauritania on Tuesday in their sixth meeting between the two nations.

The Atlas Lions will hope to maintain their unbeaten record in this fixture, having won three and drawn two of their five meetings.

Mauritania have now lost their last two matches, following Friday's 2-0 defeat against Mali at Stade de Marrakech.

The Lions of Chinguetti conceded two goals within three minutes in the first half and could not find a way back into the game, making it their fourth defeat in the last five.

Despite reaching the round of 16 at the last AFCON, Amir Abdou's men lost three of their four games, only progressing as one of the best third-placed teams.

However, they can draw inspiration from their two previous draws against Morocco to put in a solid performance on Tuesday and avoid a third consecutive defeat.

Real Madrid's Brahim Diaz opted to represent Morocco instead of Spain and made his debut in the win over Angola.

The 24-year-old is expected to continue in a midfield three alongside Sofyan Amrabat and Azzedine Ounahi when the Atlas Lions take to the pitch on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Romain Saiss and Sofiane Boufal are notable absentees from the squad.

Aboubakary Koita scored twice during the AFCON, the most by anyone in the Mauritanian side, but he is not in the squad for the friendlies this month.

Pape Ibnou Ba and Papa Ndiage Yade are expected to start in attack for the Lions of Chinguetti.


Morocco possible starting lineup:
Bounou; Hakimi, Abqar, Aguerd, Allah; Diaz, Amrabat, Ounahi; Ziyech, En-Nesyri, Adli

Mauritania possible starting lineup:
Niasse; Yali, Bodda, Fofana, Abeid; Gassama; Bouna, Houeibib, Keita, Mahmoud; Ba, Yade




We say: Morocco 2-0 Mauritania

The Atlas Lions are unbeaten in exhibition games since a 3-0 loss to the USA in June 2022, an almost two-year run they hope to continue on Friday. We expect them to continue this run next Tuesday as they will be too strong for Mauritania.
