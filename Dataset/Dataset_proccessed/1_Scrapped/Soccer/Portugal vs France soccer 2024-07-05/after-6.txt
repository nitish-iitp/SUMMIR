Two teams who would not have scored all weekend finally found their range in the shootout but, eventually, somebody had to miss. It was harsh on João Félix that his aberration, a crisp but fractionally wayward penalty that rapped Mike Maignan’s right post, was decisive given he was not on the pitch for most of the fare that had preceded it. But it was fitting that this protracted, oddly absorbing tie went the distance and entirely in keeping with their performance over the past three weeks that France somehow pulled through.

Théo Hernandez ensured that, making it five successful conversions from five. As he stepped up Kylian Mbappé, withdrawn during extra time and clearly uncomfortable from an earlier blow to his broken nose, had crouched on the touchline and wrung his hands. The entire night had been imbued with an anxious, skittish, taut quality more befitting of a final. Mbappé watched his teammate convert and Spain now stand between him and the real thing.

Presumably the prospect of an unfulfilled tournament’s work had been racing through Mbappé’s mind. He has done his best given, in his own words, the view through his mask reminds him of 3D spectacles. This affair had, once a slow-burning first half was put aside, certainly been anything but flat and examples were served up regularly of the impotence that both sides had surmounted in getting this far.

The biggest reminder of all came three minutes into extra time after Francisco Conceição, the Portugal substitute, had scorched to the right byline and served the ball up on a plate. There was an era when its recipient, Cristiano Ronaldo, scored these in his sleep but his body shape was all wrong and he effected a rugby conversion from eight yards. Conceição, 18 years Ronaldo’s junior, ran over to console his captain. Heaven forfend a repeat of Monday night’s tears.

It was the closest Ronaldo came to goal all night, save for a successfully converted penalty to open Portugal’s set. An earlier free-kick, afforded him without quarrel because Bruno Fernandes had been withdrawn, was planted into the wall. There remain a subset who will not want to hear it but the fact he was still on the pitch after two hours made no sense. Persisting with Ronaldo against most available logic has become akin to drunkenly calling a former partner; little good has come of it for Roberto Martínez and Portugal.

He had attempted a first-half sprint before being shepherded away by an almost apologetic William Saliba; the rest of his contribution had amounted to the occasional lay-off in midfield and it felt unbecoming for a genuine icon of the sport, once the second-best player in the world, to remain in situ while an accomplished and mobile young forward in Gonçalo Ramos was unused.

That is not a blanket comment on footballing old age. For a complete contrast witness Pepe, who at 41 put on a masterclass here. One passage of play, which came towards the end of normal time straight after the equally exceptional Saliba had made a heroic block, encapsulated him better than words ever could. The blisteringly quick Marcus Thuram had just arrived on the scene for France and blazed a trail down the wing but Pepe, brain and legs in glorious sync, kept pace over fully 60 yards and was able to avert danger. Pepe ensured his pleasure was made fully known to Thuram; advanced years have, in his case, certainly not brought docility.

It was an evening to admire defensive arts far more than any of the attacking play that, while swinging from end to end like a basketball match for much of the second hour, generally ended in head-banging frustration. How to analyse two teams who, stacked with talent and so utterly accomplished in most of their movements, simply froze every time the chance came to convert? Portugal, the better side overall, will not enjoy poring over the component parts of their failure.

For all Ronaldo will be under the microscope there was the moment when, with virtually the last action before penalties, the left-back Nuno Mendes shot straight at Maignan from 16 yards when a finish to either side would have sparked delirium.

Maignan had earlier worked harder in denying the hugely impressive Vitinha, who should nonetheless have scored, and repelling an angled strike from Fernandes. Even Félix, deployed midway through extra time, had time to avoid his later ignominy but headed into the side netting. Portugal had the game’s best forward in Rafael Leão but his endeavours, repeatedly tormenting Jules Koundé, came to nothing.

What Mbappé would have given for any such opening. He was clearly not at full tilt, João Cancelo marshalling him adeptly before Nélson Semedo took on the job. That did not deter him from attempting a number of shots from around the penalty area; in his best nick at least one of them would surely have troubled Diogo Costa, who saved well from Hernandez in the opening period, but his end product was tentative.

The most painful moment for Mbappé came when, early in the second half, he strained to defend a corner and felt the full impact of a Bernardo Silva header. Obviously in discomfort, he removed the mask and sought treatment before carrying on until his eventual removal. France, without a goal in open play from any of their own players, soothed the agony later on but will need him badly from here.
