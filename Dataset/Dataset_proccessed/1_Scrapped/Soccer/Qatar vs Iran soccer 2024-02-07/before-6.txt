IN THE THICK OF THINGS—Wanderers and Silver

Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (Macra) has warned local broadcasters to refrain from relaying and syndicating sports, news and programme content from international and local content providers without the authorisation of the owners.

This follows complaints from international and local content producers over some local broadcasting stations’ tendency of relaying content without getting broadcasting rights from material owners.

In a letter dated February 5 2024, Macra prohibits local stations from providing commentary on sports content that requires authorisation or rights before airing.

“Macra observed that there are some broadcasters who are relaying and syndicating sports, news and programme content from international and local content providers without the authorisation (broadcasting rights) of the owners.

“This also includes providing commentary on sports content that requires authorisation or rights to be broadcast, for instance local sports and the English Premier League,” reads the letter signed by Macra Director General Daud Suleman.

The letter further states that under Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions for Content Licences, which form any part of broadcasters’ licences, service providers are prohibited from violating the intellectual property rights of any person.

“It is therefore a serious breach of your licence to broadcast other broadcasters’ content without acquiring authorisation or broadcasting rights from owners.

“Further, Section 21 of the General Terms and Conditions of your licence prohibits you from syndicating, relaying or re-broadcasting any programme material from any other source or station without the authority [Macra]’s written authorisation,” the letter reads.

Macra also asks broadcasters that are relaying or syndicating content from local and international content providers to furnish the institution with authorisation or broadcasting rights.

The content providers include the Super League, British Broadcasting Corporation, Deutsch Welle, Aljazeera, CNN, New World Television (for Africa Cup of Nations tournament), SuperSport, Sky Sports (for English Premier League) and others.

Meanwhile, local big stations have touted Macra for the move.

Times Television Manager Wonder Msiska said Macra is exercising powers within its mandate to bring sanity to the industry.

“That is what the regulation says. You cannot syndicate or relay content with authorisation from the content owners. The regulator is acting within its mandate. There is so much piracy out there and the regulator should make sure that it’s regulating the industry.

“You have some radios and TVs pirating Afcon, for example. You need strong regulations to guard against such malpractices,” Msiska said.

MBC Director General George Kasakula said Macra has moved to stop theft.

“On our part, we comply. Just imagine, we secured Africa Cup of Nations broadcasting rights and yet some local stations are stealing from us,” he said.
