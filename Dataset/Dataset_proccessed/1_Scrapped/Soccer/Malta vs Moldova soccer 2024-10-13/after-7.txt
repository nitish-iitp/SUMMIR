MALTA…1
MOLDOVA…0
(HT 0-0)

1-0 Teuma, pen, 87.

On a night with several positives, Malta managed to beat Moldova thanks to a late Teddy Teuma penalty, a highly deserved victory for the boys in red over a defensive minded Moldova team. Under the guidance of interim coach Davide Mazzotta, re-installed in the MFA technical staff after serving as right-hand man of Devis Mangia, Malta played their hearts out against the group leaders, who proved to be so dominant in their home match but were tonight playing second fiddle to the Maltese.

Mazzotta chose to start with two debutants in the starting eleven. Gzira United central defender Gabriel Mentz’ naturalisation process has been successfully rounded off recently, while Australian born Trent Buhagiar of Brescia was also awarded a starting place. Both Henry Bonello and Joseph Mbong made their 60th cap for the national team, Matthew Guillaumier his 40th and his 10th as captain. For Moldova, all-time top scorer Ion Nicolaescu was missing through injury, with Vitalie Damascan as logical replacement up front.

The opening 20 minutes were rather balanced, with neither side taking any risks. The first shot on target was recorded on 21 minutes when Kurt Shaw picked up a loose ball just outside the area from a bad Moldovan clearance, with Dumitru Celeadnic saving the grounder of the Hibernians defender without much difficulty. Four minutes later from a Buhagiar free-kick, a header by Mentz from the edge of the box ended up on the roof of the net.

On 32 minutes, a Teddy Teuma free-kick was remarkably missed by everyone in the box which forced Celeadnic into a rigorous save. Bonello was called into action for the first time on 36 minutes, parading a Damascan grounder. In stoppage time, Artur Ionita came close to break the deadlock in favour of the guests but his close-range effort was turned into a corner.

Mazzotta brought on Kemar Reid and 19-year-old Reading-based Basil Tuma, a third debutant, clearly showing the attacking intensions, with Montebello and Buhagiar making way. On 50 minutes, an in-swinging Teuma corner nearly got the better of Celeadnic, fisting away the top-corner effort.

Malta were much in control of the match but stumbled countless times on the Moldovan fort, who clearly were happy obtaining a point from this match. On 72 minutes, a Camenzuli cross from the left wing created havoc in the Moldovan rear-guard with Victor Mudrac clearing with difficulty but none of the Maltese strikers were at the right place to round of.

The match exploded in the final phase as with three minutes regular time left, Malta were awarded a penalty. Satariano set up Reid in the box, with the danger initially being blocked by the Moldova custodian but Tuma picked up the ball on the edge of the six-yard box and was consequently brought down by Vladislav Baboglo. Teuma made no mistake to put Malta 1-0 up, much to the delight of the numerous support. Moments later, Malta could have doubled when the lively Tuma was sent through but his attempt missed the necessary direction, another incredible opportunity.

In the very end of stoppage time, Malta were awarded a second penalty for a hands ball infringement in the Moldova box. Knowing a 2-0 victory would totally open the outcome of this group, Teuma stepped up a second time but blasted his spot-kick high over the bar.

That did not stop the party however as the victory was warmly welcomed by the crowd. Malta and Moldova now share top spot in the group with six points from three games and with both nations playing Andorra next month in the last match, the group is far from decided.
