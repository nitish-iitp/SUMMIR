The Bears go for their third straight win on Sunday when they take on the Jaguars in London. Watch the game free on Fubo.

The Chicago Bears battle the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday in London, England. The Bears come across the ocean looking to win their third straight game. The Bears got off to a rocky start as they had lost two of three, but they have bounced back with wins over the Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers. Quarterback Caleb Williams has started to play better as he has thrown for 304 yards and two touchdowns against the Panthers. Williams has started to build a good rapport with DJ Moore as they connected for 105 yards and two touchdowns last week. D’Andre Swift has also started to come alive as he rushed for 73 yards and had two catches for 47 yards in the win over Carolina. The Bears will get a bye week next week and are looking to head into their break with a 4-2 record.

The Jaguars, though, are looking to send the Bears home with a loss as they try and win a second straight game.

The Jaguars finally got in the win column on Sunday when they beat the Indianapolis Colts 37-34. They looked in control of the game when they went up 24-10 with 5:09 left, but they gave up two touchdowns in under two minutes to give away the lead.

Fortunately for the Jaguars, they were able to drive back down the field to get a game-winning field goal with 17 seconds left to finally get their first win.

They had started the year with four straight losses and had not looked good, but they continued their dominance of the Colts at home to push their record to 1-4.
