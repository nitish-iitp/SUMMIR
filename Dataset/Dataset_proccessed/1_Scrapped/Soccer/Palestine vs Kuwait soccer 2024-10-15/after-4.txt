Updated: 08:01am Oct 18, 2024
As the September FIFA Men's international window fast approaches, here is an overview of the remaining 2024 match schedule involving Australia's Men's National Teams.


The Subway Socceroos have six FIFA World Cup 2026™ Third Round Asian Qualifiers to close out the year with two games each in September, October and November.

The Subway Australian U23s will be in action early next month for two matches against the senior national team of Vanuatu as part of their Pacific Aus Football Tour.

Later in September, the Subway Young Socceroos have their AFC U20 Asian Cup China PR 2025™ Qualifiers in Saudi Arabia, while the Subway Joeys tackle their AFC U17 Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2025™ Qualifiers in October in Kuwait.

Some details are still to be confirmed, and any updates will be communicated via our official channels. Relevant broadcast information will also be shared closer to the matches. 

The CommBank Pararoos will also learn their opponents for the 2024 IFCPF Men’s World Cup competition when the draw takes place on 10 September. The tournament runs from 6 November until 24 November in Salou, Spain.
