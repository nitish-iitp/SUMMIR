Uzbekistan defeats UAE in crucial 2026 World Cup qualifiers

Uzbekistan’s national football team secured a crucial 1-0 victory over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the fourth round of the 2026 World Cup qualifying matches, gaining three crucial points in their quest for qualification.

The match saw both teams competing intensely. The game took a decisive turn in the second half when a UAE defender was sent off with a red card, leaving the visitors to play with ten men. Uzbekistan capitalized on this advantage, winning a penalty in the 76th minute.

Otabek Shukurov confidently converted the penalty, putting Uzbekistan ahead 1-0. Despite further efforts from both sides, no additional goals were scored, and the Uzbek team held on to claim the win, bringing their total points to 10.

This victory strengthens Uzbekistan's position in Group A, where they currently lead with 10 points. Iran follows with 7 points, while Qatar and UAE both have 4 points. Kyrgyzstan and North Korea are tied at 3 points each.
