Uzbekistan

The Uzbekistan national team has shown remarkable results in the third stage of qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the moment, they lead Group A with seven points in the standings, but Iran, which has the same number of points, is pushing it from the bottom. The Uzbeks had drawn with Iran the previous day (0:0). Before that, Uzbekistan had two victories - a 1:0 win over North Korea and a 3:2 win over Kyrgyzstan.

UAE

The UAE national team got off to a satisfactory start in the third round of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. The Arabians managed to beat Qatar 3:1 in three rounds, then lost to Iran 0:1, and on the previous day secured a 1:1 draw with North Korea. Therefore, the UAE national team is in third place in the Group A standings with four points, and the key task for it is to stay in the knockout zone, which will give them the right to play in the fourth stage.

Expert Betting Tips

In the upcoming meeting we suggest betting on the Uzbekistan national team. They held the stages of qualification in an excellent way, and in the last seven matches, they won five times, and twice they were stopped only by a strong Iranian team. The UAE team is strong, but we don't believe in its success, especially in Tashkent. We bet on the victory of the home team and the total under.
