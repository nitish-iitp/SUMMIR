Uzbekistan’s team, led by head coach Srečko Katanec, enters this home match aiming to secure a vital victory after their goalless draw against Iran in the previous round. Both Uzbekistan and Iran currently sit at the top of their group with 7 points each, but Uzbekistan leads the group due to a better goal difference.

The UAE, along with Qatar, North Korea, and Kyrgyzstan, are also competing in the same group, with the teams battling for a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

This match is crucial for Uzbekistan as they look to maintain their lead and strengthen their chances of qualifying for the tournament.
