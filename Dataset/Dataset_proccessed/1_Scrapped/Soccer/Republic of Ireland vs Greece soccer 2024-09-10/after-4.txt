Heimir Hallgrimsson on RTÉ: “We needed only to give them a sniff of a chance and they scored, that’s what happens to a team without confidence. They are like a snake if you give them a chance to bite, they will.

“I know it’s going to be tough, but I definitely saw improvements, especially in structure. When we were in good structure, we looked really good. We need to find this relationship between the players. When you haven’t played the system or the players around you, there is uncertainty.”

That’s all from me for tonight, good night!

Will Smallbone on RTÉ: “Played with 4 at the back, we were more attacking. We definitely created more in the first half but we need to start winning games. We want to win as much as anyone, we just want to get results. We will give our all against Finland, we need to be more killer in the final third.”

Full-time: Ireland 0 Greece 2

Poor result, disappointing performance at home. More solid in the first half but they did not create anywhere near enough. A lot to ponder for the new management.

Here was the second Greece goal:

🇮🇪 0-2 🇬🇷: That's game over for Ireland and it's far too easy for Greece as Tzolis chases down a simple ball over the top from Bakasetas before firing home.

Ireland 0 Greece 2

96 days ago

87 mins: Goal for Greece! Great run from Tzolis in behind after a pass beats the line. A one-on-one with Collins and he turns him with a deft touch and then fires it low past Kelleher in the corner. He is subbed off to delight and congratulated with a delighted coaching staff.

Ireland 0 Greece 2

85 mins: A bit of life from the subs! McAteer runs at the defender and lays off to edge of the box, Brady’s shot is blocked then Robinson gets a shot away, it’s deflected and just goes past the post.

Ireland 0 Greece 1

84 mins: Dangerous free-kick by Greece nearly sneaks in to a Greek player after a good ball by Bakasetas but Kelleher collects. Callum Robinson comes on. Just over 37,000 attending the game tonight.

Two more subs for Ireland, Doherty and McAteer are on.

Ireland 0 Greece 1

Harry Kane scored again for England, 2-0 to them in the other game in the group.

70 mins: Sloppy play at the back from Dara O’Shea, then Knight pushes Siopis over and it’s a free-kick from around 30 yards for Greece. Decent effort from Bakasetas but can’t keep it down.

Ireland 0 Greece 1

50 mins: Goal for Greece! It’s Ireland’s typical weakness, long-range shots. Ioannidis curles one into the top corner from the D. Defenders backed off too much you could argue. Good pass to him from Bakasetas.

🇮🇪 0-1 🇬🇷: Greece take the lead against the run of play as Ioannidis is gifted far too much time and space on the edge of the Irish penalty area. Some finish though.

48 mins: Ireland opting for long throw tonight but not much joy with them. Collins won the first ball, but nobody there for the knock on.

Half-time: Ireland 0 Greece 0

Not a great game, but came to life in the last five minutes of the half with Ogbene almost scoring a screamer. Hallgrimsson won’t be too unhappy with that though, all to play for second half.

🇮🇪 0-0 🇬🇷: Chiedozie Ogbene has the ball in the net after a stunning strike, but the Irishman had strayed just offside and the goal won't count.

On the sheet, it says Ireland will line up in a 4-4-1-1 formation with Knight behind Szmodics. Hallgrimsson says on RTÉ, Ireland will have more of the ball. “We need to find the right players, and keep playing them, and more confidence in them playing.”

🗣️ “It’s a pretty equal squad, a lot of players can stake a claim that they should be playing”

There is every reason for Ireland to be braced for tough Greek test, writes James McDermott.

“Appropriately, this feeling is strongest when they face Greece, who have won four and drawn one of their five matches against Ireland, with the Republic only scoring a single goal. Last year Greece completed a double over Ireland, winning 2-1 in Athens and 2-0 at the Aviva Stadium to secure a play-off spot for Euro 2024.

“The chasm between the countries is even more pronounced at club level, as illustrated in August when PAOK eased past Shamrock Rovers on a 6-0 aggregate scoreline to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League. Things were much closer in 2021 Europa Conference League when Bohemians were unlucky to fall to PAOK on a 3-2 aggregate scoreline.”

FT: Ireland 2 Latvia 2. 29 shots, 71% possession but a draw in Tallaght for the under-21s. Could be crucial unfortunately in not qualifying with Norway and Italy to come. Not over yet, but a big slip up at home. Here was the equalising goal:

Ireland 2-2 Latvia: Ireland are only behind for a couple of minutes as they get the response they need through Sean Ronan's classy angled finish.

An unusual line-up there, hard to tell what formation it will be. Looks to be bolstering the midfield anyway with Browne, Knight coming in and Idah dropped, it looks like Szmodics could be up front.

The Greece team:

Odysseas Vlachodimos; Lazaros Rota, Ntinos Mavopanos, Konstantinos Koulierakis, Kostas Tsimikas; Manolis Siopis, Andreas Bouchalakis; Taos Chatzigiovanis, Tasos Bakasetas (capt), Christos Tolis, Fotis Ioannidis

Ireland are drawing 2-2 with Latvia in the Euro Under-21 qualifying match in Tallaght, still 20 minutes to go but they really need to win that one for qualification.

96 days ago

Gavin Cummiskey focuses his pre-match preview on the not so rosy financials for the FAI:

“The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) need a win tonight against Greece as much as their new manager Heimir Hallgrímsson and the put upon players.

“The association’s cash balance at the end of 2023 was €1.6 million, down from €10.9 million in 2022, as the annual general meeting on Saturday will explain, to service a legacy debt that currently stands at €43.2 million.

“These figures should not directly impact a Nations League fixture where Ireland seek to avoid a third defeat to Greece inside 15 months, but the debt explains why Irish football is knee deep in a decade of austerity.

Hello and welcome to live coverage of Ireland’s second Nations League game, against Greece at the Aviva Stadium. Saturday was a sobering day against old rivals England as they outclassed Ireland in a 2-0 result that flattered the boys in green. Beating Greece at home is a more realistic aim, but already the pressure is building on the management team after a difficult start. A defeat would put Ireland on the back foot and looking over their shoulder at League C.

Gus Poyet is no longer at the helm as Greece, under new manager Ivan Jovanovic, beat Finland 3-0 in Athens on Saturday with two goals from Panathinaikos striker Fotis Ioannidis. They are a tricky side that had Ireland and Stephen Kenny’s number in the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign, beating Ireland home and away

Evan Ferguson will not be fit to start the game, according to manager Heimir Hallgrímsson. Saturday was Ferguson’s first game since sustaining an ankle injury last March. Captain Séamus Coleman will miss the match through injury, his place in the squad is taken by Festy Ebosele. Without Josh Cullen in midfield, a big responsibility lies on Will Smallbone to carry a weak midfield, while if the management continues with five at the back, Ireland need to see more from the wing-back positions. Kick-off is at 7.45pm.
