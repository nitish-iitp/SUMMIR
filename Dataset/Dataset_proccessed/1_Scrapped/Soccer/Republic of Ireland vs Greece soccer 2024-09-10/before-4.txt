September 10, 2024, at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland and Greece will square off the UEFA Nations League with a capacity of 51,700 spectators. The game will start at 18:45 local time and be watched by Eskas E. from Norway. League B, Round 2 in the Nations League, this game is part of which both teams will be eager to grab important points.

Greece is full of confidence following their outstanding 3-0 triumph over Finland; Ireland is off a dismal 2-0 loss to England. The result of this game might have major consequences for both sides regarding their advancement to the next level of the competition. Let’s explore further the betting analysis and forecasts for this significant game.

BETTING TIPS AND MATCH INSIGHTS

We will examine both teams’ recent performance as well as head-to-head history in this part to give you pertinent analysis for the Ireland against Greece prediction today. With just three wins in their last 14 games and two of those against less strong opposition, Ireland’s form has been erratic. Conversely, Greece has shown more consistency under fresh coach Ivan Jovanović; they won their first game 3-0. Greece has traditionally dominated this game since they have won four of their past five meetings. Based on form and historical dominance, the Ireland vs Greece match prediction points to a closely contested game whereby Greece is somewhat favoured to edge out the triumph.

Ireland Recent Results

Ireland’s recent performances have been underwhelming, struggling to find consistency both at home and on the road. Below is a summary of their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
07.09.24	UNL	Ireland vs England	0-2	L
11.06.24	Friendly	Portugal vs Ireland	3-0	L
04.06.24	Friendly	Ireland vs Hungary	2-1	W
26.03.24	Friendly	Ireland vs Switzerland	0-1	L
23.03.24	Friendly	Ireland vs Belgium	0-0	D

Ireland has struggled against stronger teams, as seen in their recent losses to England, Portugal, and Switzerland. Their only win came against Hungary, but their overall form points to difficulties in maintaining momentum. Their defense has been vulnerable, and their attack has lacked sharpness in key moments.

Greece Recent Results

Greece enters this match with a more positive outlook, having won their last two fixtures comfortably. Below are their recent results:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
07.09.24	UNL	Greece vs Finland	3-0	W
11.06.24	Friendly	Greece vs Malta	2-0	W
07.06.24	Friendly	Germany vs Greece	2-1	L
26.03.24	EURO Qualifier	Georgia vs Greece	0-0	D
21.03.24	EURO Qualifier	Greece vs Kazakhstan	5-0	W

Greece has been strong in their recent fixtures, particularly in their 3-0 win over Finland. Their defense has been solid, keeping three clean sheets in their last five games. The attack has also been firing, with notable contributions from Fotis Ioannidis, who netted a brace against Finland.

Ireland vs Greece Head-to-Head Results

The history between these two teams heavily favors Greece, as Ireland has failed to win in their last five encounters. Below are the head-to-head results from their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
13.10.23	EURO Qualifier	Ireland vs Greece	0-2
16.06.23	EURO Qualifier	Greece vs Ireland	2-1
14.11.12	Friendly	Ireland vs Greece	0-1
20.11.02	Friendly	Greece vs Ireland	0-0
25.04.00	Friendly	Ireland vs Greece	0-1

Greece has clearly dominated this matchup, winning four out of the five games, including a 2-0 victory in Dublin last year. Ireland has struggled to break through Greece’s defense, failing to score in four of these encounters.

Free Tips on Ireland vs Greece

When preparing for the Ireland vs Greece match, it’s essential to analyze several key factors that can impact the outcome. By reviewing recent statistics, team form, and other influencing aspects, bettors can make more informed decisions. Below is a list of strategic tips based on statistical insights and past performances that could be crucial in shaping the result of this encounter.

Recent Form: Greece comes into this match after a strong 3-0 victory over Finland, while Ireland has struggled, losing 9 out of their last 14 games. Confidence levels will likely play a key role, and Greece’s momentum could give them the upper hand.
Head-to-Head Advantage: Historically, Greece has dominated this fixture, winning four of the last five encounters. This consistent performance against Ireland suggests that Greece could have the psychological edge going into the match.
Impact of Weather and Conditions: Dublin’s unpredictable weather could affect the pace of the game. Rain or windy conditions may slow down ball movement on the pitch, favoring more defensively organized teams like Greece.
Player Fitness and Scheduling: Both teams are coming off games just three days prior, which could lead to fatigue, especially for Ireland, whose squad depth may not be as robust as Greece’s. This could influence the second half performance of both teams.
Managerial Influence: Ivan Jovanović’s recent appointment as Greece’s head coach has already shown positive results with their big win against Finland. His fresh tactical approach might surprise Ireland, which could struggle to adapt to new strategies under Heimir Hallgrímsson.
