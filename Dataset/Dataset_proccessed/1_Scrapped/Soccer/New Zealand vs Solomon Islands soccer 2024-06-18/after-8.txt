How Are World Rugby Rankings Calculated?

Here is how the rankings are done, according World Rugby: 

CALCULATION

Men’s and Women's World Rugby Rankings are calculated using a 'Points Exchange' system, where sides gain or lose points based on the match result. Other criteria include the relative strength of each team, the margin of victory, and an allowance for home advantage.

MEMBER UNIONS

All member countries have a rating, typically between 0 and 100. The top side in the world will normally have a rating above 90. Any match that is not a full international between two member countries does not count at all.

RWC RANKING

Points are doubled during the World Cup Finals to recognize the importance of this event, but all other international matches, friendly or competitive, are treated the same across the world.
