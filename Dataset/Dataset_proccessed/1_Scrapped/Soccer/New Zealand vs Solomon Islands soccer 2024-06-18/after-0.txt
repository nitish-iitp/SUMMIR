OFC Nations Cup: New Zealand commanding win sends Solomon Islands home

The Solomon Islands’ campaign in the OFC Men’s Nations Cup 2024 came to an end following a 3-0 defeat to a youthful New Zealand side at Freshwater Stadium on Tuesday. This result eliminated the Solomon Islands from the tournament, leaving them without a goal scored and four conceded after a previous 1-0 loss to hosts Vanuatu.

New Zealand’s victory was spearheaded by an outstanding performance from Ben Waine, who netted two goals within the first 11 minutes, securing the Kiwis‘ semi-final spot alongside Vanuatu. Both teams will clash on Friday to determine the top position in Group A.

Coach Darren Bazeley’s strategy paid off early when Waine, a Plymouth Argyle forward, found the net twice in quick succession. His first goal came at the five-minute mark, turning a defender to score from close range. Six minutes later, he doubled his tally with an assist from Tim Payne, effectively dashing Solomon Islands’ hopes of progressing.

New Zealand’s third goal arrived in the 40th minute when Finn Surman’s header from a corner was saved by Solomon Islands’ goalkeeper Phillip Mango, only for Kosta Barbarouses to capitalize on the rebound. Despite increased pressure and tactical adjustments from Solomon Islands’ coach Jacob Moli, including the introduction of key player Raphael Le’ai, New Zealand’s young defense, featuring Finn Surman and Tyler Bindon, held firm.

The Solomon Islands, known for causing New Zealand problems in the past, struggled to make an impact. Coach Jacob Moli’s decision to bench star player Raphael Le’ai initially and field a more conservative line-up with five defenders drew criticism. Moli introduced Le’ai in the first half after New Zealand’s quick double but to no avail. Despite courageous efforts, including a stinging shot from Gagame Feni that nearly found the top corner, the Solomon Islands could not break through New Zealand’s defense.

In the second half, Moli switched to a more attacking formation, bringing on additional forwards, but the Kiwi defense remained resolute. The Solomon Islands worked hard to get back into the match, with Le’ai coming close in stoppage time, hitting the post, but they ultimately failed to score.

The match began with a minute of silence in honor of former New Zealand Football Chief Executive Bob Patterson. The New Zealand side featured debutants Alex Paulsen and Sam Sutton, while the Solomon Islands made four changes from their previous match.

Coach Moli, also the interim coach of the Solomon Islands national team and current coach of Central Coast FC, faced backlash for his initial team selection. His adjustments during the game highlighted the talent in the Solomon Islands squad, with players like Feni and John Orobulu showing promise but unable to change the outcome.

With this result, New Zealand and Vanuatu advance from Group A, with their upcoming match determining the group leader. The Solomon Islands exit the tournament with a spirited but ultimately unsuccessful campaign.
