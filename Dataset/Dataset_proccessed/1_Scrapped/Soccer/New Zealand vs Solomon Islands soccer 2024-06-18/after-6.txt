The Local Organising Committee (LOC) for the OFC Men’s Nations Cup Group A stage in Port Vila has decided that ticket sales will be reduced from 5,000 to 4,000, for the remaining games.

This decision follows feedback from match day 1, where the VFF Freswota Stadium experienced overcrowding, prompting concerns about safety and security. An estimated over 6,000 fans secured tickets last Saturday.
