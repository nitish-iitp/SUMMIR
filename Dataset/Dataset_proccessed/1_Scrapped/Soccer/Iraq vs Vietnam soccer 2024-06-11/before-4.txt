Indonesia's midfielder, Marselino Ferdinan (center), undergoes a training session at Football Field B, Gelora Bung Karno, Jakarta, Tuesday (May 28th, 2024). Indonesia is preparing for the World Cup 2026 qualifying match against Iraq and the Philippines.

1. What is Indonesia's strategy to conquer Iraq?

2. What is the record of previous meetings between the two teams?

3. The role of naturalized players in the Indonesian national team squad

4. What is the 2026 World Cup qualification system for the Asian zone?

Indonesia has an open opportunity to advance to the third round of the 2026 World Cup qualification as well as the final round of the 2027 Asian Cup. The additional three points from the last two matches, against Iraq on June 6, 2024, and the Philippines on June 11, 2024, will ensure the progress of the Garuda team.

The team coached by Shin Tae-yong is currently in third place in the second round of Group F with a score of seven points behind Iraq, who have already confirmed themselves through with 12 points. Vietnam is in third place with three points, while the Philippines is in the last position with one point. The top two teams will qualify for the third round as well as qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup finals in Saudi Arabia.

What is Indonesia's strategy to conquer Iraq?

The Indonesian squad is highly motivated to maintain their positive home playing trend in the 2026 World Cup Qualifying event. However, Iraq is a much stronger opponent compared to the other two opponents in Group F.

However, two consecutive defeats to Iraq have doubled Asnawi Mangkualam and his colleagues' motivation to seek revenge at Gelora Bung Karno. The support of tens of thousands of supporters is an important asset for Garuda to break their negative record and seal their ticket to the next round. The quota of around 60,000 match tickets has already sold out.

So, what strategy has Shin Tae-yong prepared to take him to overthrow Iraq? Indonesia has a game control "professor", namely Thom Haye. Thom's debut in the away match against Vietnam in the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers showed that he was a puzzle complementary to Shin's game strategy. The former Heerenveen player is a player who can regulate the tempo of the game and provide accurate passes to the front line.

The 29-year-old midfielder has a rare ability that is impossible to find in local Indonesian players today. Thom's skill in providing progressive passes is the "recipe" that can be utilized by the Garuda squad to end their negative trend against Iraq.

What is the record of previous meetings between the two teams?

After suffering two consecutive defeats against Iraq, Indonesia is set on a mission for revenge in the World Cup 2026 Qualifiers on Thursday (6/6/2024) at 4:00 PM Western Indonesia Time, at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium in Jakarta.

Indonesia must admit Iraq's superiority 1-5 in the first meeting at the Basra International Stadium, Iraq, in November 2023, and then fell 1-3 in the group stage of the 2023 Asia Cup in January 2024 in Qatar. These two defeats show that Iraq is able to maintain the quality of its performance in front of its own supporters and in a neutral location.

Throughout the history of Indonesia's meetings with Iraq, the last competitive meeting of the two teams was held at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium in November 2013. At that time, Indonesia was defeated 0-2 in the qualifying match for the 2015 Asian Cup.

The Indonesian squad is highly motivated to maintain their positive streak at home in the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers. Asnawi Mangkualam and his teammates have already secured two victories at the SUGBK stadium. This was achieved by defeating Brunei Darussalam 6-0 in the first round in October 2023, and then defeating their Southeast Asian rival, Vietnam, 1-0 on March 21st.

The role of naturalized players in the Indonesian national team squad

Since the naturalization program was approved by Minister of Youth and Sports Zainudin Amali - who later became the Vice Chairman of PSSI for the 2023-2027 period - as well as Chairman of PSSI (2019-2023) Mochamad Iriawan in 2020, a total of 14 players have undergone naturalization that has been approved by the DPR.

During that period, Indonesia made history by qualifying for the knockout phase of the 2023 Asia Cup for the first time, and reaching the semifinals of the 2024 U-23 Asia Cup. In addition, the Garuda team only needs one more win out of the remaining two matches to advance to the third round of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

The three achievements were not created before the naturalization program took place. The second volume of the naturalization program has a clearer goal. It is aimed specifically at the needs of the national team and therefore must be approved by the coach. In addition, the players sought after must have Indonesian blood or have ancestral lineage that was born in Indonesia.

What is the qualification system for the 2026 World Cup in the Asian zone?

Teams in Asia benefit from the addition of the number of participants in the 2026 World Cup. For the first time, the participants will increase to 48, adding 16 teams from the seven previous editions of the World Cup. Asia will get a quota of 8.5 in the tournament that will be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

The Asian zone qualifiers are also winding, but provide quite a lot of opportunities for the fighting teams. Indonesia, which has a FIFA ranking that is not very good, had to start the struggle from the first round. After qualifying for the second round, there is still a third round, and if necessary, through the fourth, fifth and playoff rounds with other confederations.

The top two teams in the second round, consisting of nine groups, automatically qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup and also advance to the third round of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers. A total of 18 teams that qualify for the third round will be divided into three groups.

The top two teams in each group in the third round qualify for the World Cup finals. Meanwhile, the third and fourth ranked teams from the third round have the opportunity to qualify by advancing to the fourth round, which will be divided into two groups. The two group winners in the fourth round qualify for the final round and the runners-up go to the fifth round to compete for a place in the inter-confederation playoffs.

In this last round, the Asian representative team must compete against one team each from the CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC zones, and two teams from CONCACAF to vie for one ticket to the final round. The 2026 World Cup will be held in three countries, namely Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
