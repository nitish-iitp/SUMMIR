Team Philippines is preparing to do whatever it takes to bow out in style. 




Head coach Tom Saintfiet vows to go all-in whatever the outcome is as the Philippine Men’s National Team battle Indonesia in their final match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers tonight at 8:30 p.m.




“We will do everything to get a result. A draw would be fantastic, a win would be a miracle,” Saintfiet said. 




The Pinoy booters are still in search of a breakthrough win in the tournament, coming off a heartbreaking 3-2 loss against rivals Vietnam in their last outing that officially ended our country’s hopes of advancing to the next round. 




The PMFT are currently sitting at the bottom of Group F with a 0-1-4 record behind group leaders Iraq, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Saintfliet then emphasizes their duty to the Filipino fans of finishing strong in the tournament regardless of any circumstances. 




“But it is our duty for the Philippine fans – for our development, our country – to try and get the maximum points here, even if we know that Indonesia will be the favorite.”




The Nationals and Indonesia figured in a 1-1 stalemate in their first meeting back in Manila in November of last year, with veteran Patrick Reichelt scoring the lone goal for the Philippines.

“I felt we dominated the game in November. I felt we were the better team and should've won. I’m confident after the [last] game with only [a] little time. With a little bit more time now and chemistry, we can achieve something,” Reichelt said. 




Reichelt, who scored the Philippines first goal in that heartbreaking loss to Vietnam last Thursday, June 6, expects the challenge that lies ahead of playing in a hostile crowd. 




“It’s always exciting to play here. Indonesia is a football crazy country, so for us players it’s always an experience to come here and show ourselves. 




“They’re going through a huge change, we’re going through a big transition, so it’s just exciting to see where the two of us stand today."

As the 2026 FIFA World Cup dreams have ended, the Philippine Men’s National Team can now start to look and prepare for the 2027 Asian Cup, with the third round of qualifiers starting in March 2025.

 

 You can watch the game between the PMFT and Indonesia at 8:30 p.m. LIVE via livestream on the official Facebook page of the Philippine Men's National Football Team.
