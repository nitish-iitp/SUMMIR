NETHERLANDS 2-1 TURKEY: DUTCH SET UP EURO 2024 SEMI-FINAL AGAINST ENGLAND AFTER CLINICAL COMEBACK VICTORY
BYDESMOND KANE

UPDATED 08/07/2024 AT 05:28 GMT

Netherlands set up a Euro 2024 semi-final clash against England following a 2-1 comeback victory over Turkey. Turkey took the lead in the first half through Samet Akaydin after a fine cross from Arda Guler. However, the Dutch completed the turnaround after the break through Stefan de Vrij and a Mert Muldur own goal. It is the first time the Dutch have reached the last four since Euro 2004.

Netherlands set up a Euro 2024 semi-final clash with England after mounting a rousing second-half comeback to end Turkey's hopes with a 2-1 quarter-final victory in Berlin.
A shock looked on the cards when Samet Akaydin rose to nod home the opener for an energised Turkey side on 35 minutes from Arda Guler's pinpoint cross.

But Ronald Koeman's men cut a different side in the second half as they struck twice inside six minutes to advance to the last four with their opponents clearly tiring.

LEWELING FIRES GERMANY TO NARROW WIN OVER NETHERLANDS

14/10/2024 AT 21:12

Stefan de Vrij rose to power a header into the net for the equaliser on 70 minutes from Memphis Depay's cross before Mert Muldur flicked the ball into his own net under pressure from Cody Gakpo via a probing ball from Denzel Dumfries.
England advanced to the last four earlier on Saturday by edging Switzerland 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw after extra-time in Dusseldorf.
TALKING POINT: NETHERLANDS V ENGLAND IS A EUROPEAN CLASSIC
Neither side have hit peak form in this tournament, yet here we are with old foes England and Netherlands meeting again in the semi-finals of a major competition.
The Dutch hold the edge with seven wins to England's six and nine draws, but their two meetings at the Euros remain iconic with Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten inspiring a 3-1 win as their side went all the way to the European crown in Germany in 1988.
And who can forget England strikers Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer in their pomp in a 4-1 Wembley dismantling of the men in orange at Euro 96?
Whatever happens on Wednesday in Dortmund, the history of the fixture suggests it is unlikely to be dull.

PLAYER OF THE MATCH: BART VERBRUGGEN (NETHERLANDS)
The young Dutch goalkeeper came up with an incredible close-range reflex stop to deny Turkey a certain equaliser late on when the ball came off the frame of Semih Kiliçsoy and sped goalwards. Also seemed to get a vital touch on a free-kick from Arda Guler in the second half that was creeping into the net before he touched it onto a post with Turkey leading 1-0.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
35' GOAL! (AKAYDIN) TURKEY 1-0 NETHERLANDS Akaydin rises at the back post to power a header into the net. A 1-0 lead for Turkey. What a fine finish. Güler with a fabulous ball and his team-mate couldn't miss. Lovely goal.
66' NETHERLANDS ALMOST SHIP A SECOND GOAL Verbruggen with a solid stop to half the shot by Muldur before Weghorst somehow sticks out a leg to deny Ayhan a certain second goal on the rebound with a tap-in. So close for Turkey. One more goal surely finishes this contest.
70' GOAL! TURKEY 1-1 NETHERLANDS (DE VRIJ) Brilliant goal from the Netherlands as Stefan de Vrij rises unmarked to power a header into the net from 12 yards. Super ball from Depay. Poor marking, but it is all level at 1-1.
76' GOAL! TURKEY 1-2 NETHERLANDS (MULDUR OG) And there is the second goal for the Dutch. What a change in this quarter-final as Gakpo arrives at the back post to race ahead of Muldur to clip home the finish. Dumfries with cross to back post.
90+1' HUGE SAVE FROM THE DUTCH KEEPER Five added minutes. Bart Verbruggen with an incredible stop for the Dutch to keep his side ahead in this match. Came off Semih Kiliçsoy in a packed box and Turkey can't believe it stayed out.
