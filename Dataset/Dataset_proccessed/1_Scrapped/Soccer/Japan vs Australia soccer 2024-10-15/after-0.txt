Match report: Japan 1-1 Australia

That’s all for tonight’s blog. Joey Lynch was our man in Tokyo for the game; I’ll leave you with his report.

“Popovic will be satisfied but the game was perhaps there for the taking,” says Chris Paraskevas. “At 1-0, the changes weren’t quite adventurous enough and Irankunda’s night on the bench betrayed a lack of ambition.

“It worked tonight but might not at a World Cup.”

It’s such a difficult balance, especially when you’re 15 minutes away from such a famous victory. And it’s not like there was loads of pressure before the equaliser; it came almost out of nothing.

Jackson Irvine's reaction

My experience as part of this team is that the boys stand up in the most difficult moment: no excuses. I’m very proud of that performance – the calmness and composure that we showed in defence. It’s a top foundation for us to move forward.

[On the delay getting to the ground] It is what it is. When circumstances are out of your control, it makes it simple: you’ve just gotta do it. I can’t speak highly enough of all our stuff for the way they prepare us. They gave us the best opportunity to perform tonight and we did that.

[On being captain] It’s tough to put into words. I’ve got a very strong emotional connection to this team and it’s a very proud moment. [Starts choking up a bit] I’ve got some family here which makes it even better.

“Over the line and a great result,” says Rob Haigh. “To get anything off this machine is outstanding, well done Oz.”

Absolutely. In the medium term they need to be better on the ball but in the circumstances that’s a terrific effort.

A crimson-faced Harry Souttar looks utterly spent at the final whistle. He’d be my player of the match, though you could also make a good case for Kaoru Mitoma, Jackson Irvine and Jason Geria among others.

Never mind the individual stuff, that completes a very good week for Australia. Four points from six was realistically as good as it was going to get, and it sets them up for the double header against Saudi Arabia and Bahrain next month.

FT | We take a valuable point from our away day in Japan. 💪

Full time: Japan 1-1 Australia

What Australia lack in quality, they make up for in heart. That was a seriously hard-earned point, the result of an outstanding defensive performance. They didn’t manage a shot on target all game but took the lead when Shogo Taniguchi sliced Lewis Miller’s cross into his own net after 58 minutes.

Just as Japan were getting desperate, the substitute Keito Nakamura forced an own goal from Cam Burgess. It got a bit hairy for the Socceroos after that but they held on for a terrific result.

90+6 min Ito’s inswinger is claimed well by the backpedalling Gauci. For a horrible second I thought he’d gone too far and was going to fall into the net, but he was fine.

90+5 min The free-kick leads to a brief of game of pinball before a shot from the edge of the area is smothered at source. Japan come again, Ito curls a very dangerous cross that is headed behind by the heroic Souttar.

90+4 min Burgess takes one for the team, cynically pulling back Mitoma and nodding in acceptance when the referee shows him a yellow card. The resulting free-kick might be Japan’s last chance.

90+2 min Goodwin tries to run Machida, thinks he’s fouled and goes over. The assistant gives a throw-in to Japan, who are ready for one last push.

90 min There will be five minutes of added time.

89 min Goodwin’s first act is a high tackle on Machida that is punished with a yellow card. That means he’ll miss the big match against Saudi Arabia next month.

87 min Mitoma can’t quite control Tamaka’s cross after another bewitching dribbled from Nakamura on the left. It was a difficult ball to take in a crowded area but Mitoma usually has such a velvet touch.

80 min Yazbek is booked for a lunging foul on Ueda. Australia aren’t happy becuase they thought they should have had a free-kick moments earlier.

78 min Mitoma controls a long crossfield pass, cuts across Geria in the area and whacks a shot that hits Yazbek and flies behind.

Australia looked relatively comfortable at 1-0. They do not look comfortable at 1-1.

The goal was made beautifully by the substitute Keito Nakamura. He cut inside from the left, twisted Yazbek one way and then the other before sidefooting a fast low cross that was turned into his own net by Burgess. He had to play the ball with Ueda waiting behind him to score.

74 min Japan have won their last eight home games, scoring almost 40 goals in the process. Most were against inferior opposition, it’s true, but this would be still be a helluva result for Australia.

73 min: Double substitution for Australia Aziz Behich and Nishan Velupillay, who scored on his debut against China, replace Jordy Bos and Mitch Duke. Poor Duke worked his socks off on the graveyard shift.

68 min That’s Australia’s best bit of interplay all night, some neat one-touch football on the edge of the Japan area. It doesn’t amount to anything but maybe it’s a reflection of their growing confidence.

67 min Since the goal, Japan have been treading the line between understandable impatience and unhelpful desperation. There’s still a long way to go.

The @Socceroos take the lead in Japan!

64 min Ito’s clipped cross is met by Ueda, running away from goal, and he heads straight at Gauci. For all Japan’s pressure, Gauci still hasn’t had a difficult save to make.
