Reggie Lambe On Antigua And Barbuda Game
September 10, 2024 | 0 Comments

[Written by Stephen Wright]

Reggie Lambe has urged Bermuda to put the disappointment of losing to the Dominican Republic behind them as they prepare to face host nation Antigua and Barbuda in the Concacaf Nations League today [September 10].

Lambe said his team-mates were determined to make amends after losing 3-2 to ten-man Dominican Republic, having relinquished a 2-1 lead in their opening League B group D match on Saturday.

The experienced midfielder stressed the importance of returning home with at least one win from their opening two games and believes they were the protagonists of their own downfall against the Dominican Republic.

“After the game against Dominican Republic we were all disappointed, but we have to bounce back against Antigua and leave here with at least three points,” Lambe told Bernews.

“A few minor errors allowed the Dominican Republic to gain a foothold in the game they probably didn’t deserve.

“We need to be more structured, defensively sound as a whole team, and stop opportunities because we know we can do the business at the other end.”

The island’s most-capped player netted Bermuda’s second goal against Dominican Republic to make it 2-1 with a deflected shot and believes he still has plenty to offer the national team both on and off the pitch.

“It’s always great to score for your country and it was a good feeling to score in that moment,” said Lambe, who plays for English non-league side Braintree Town.

“Some of the boys lack a bit of international experience, so I’m trying to give them confidence and reiterate to them that they belong at this level.

“I’ve tried to pick everyone up and hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.

“We lacked a bit of concentration, and you can’t afford those moments in international football because you’ll get punished.”

Although Lambe did not play in Bermuda’s 1-1 draw away to Antigua and Barbuda in a World Cup qualifier back in June, he said he has analysed that match closely in preparation for today.

He also expressed his desire to keep on playing for as long as he is physically able.

“We know their strengths and weaknesses, but will focus on what we need to do,” added Lambe, who helps coach AFC Sudbury Women in England.

“I’m still enjoying my football, and I’ll continue playing until I can no longer.”
