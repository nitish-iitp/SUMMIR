Updates: Bermuda Defeat Antigua & Barbuda
September 10, 2024 | 0 Comments

[Updating] Bermuda’s footballers are facing Antigua and Barbuda in a match today [Sept 10] in CONCACAF Nations League action. The match against the host country follows on Bermuda’s opening 3-2 loss to the Dominican Republic this past Saturday [Sept 7].

Update | Match report from Stephen Wright: A moment of brilliance from Kane Crichlow earned Bermuda a well-deserved 1-0 victory against host nation Antigua and Barbuda in the Concacaf Nations League at the ABFA Technical Centre today [September 10].

Crichlow, who found the back of the net in Bermuda’s narrow 3-2 loss to the Dominican Republic just days earlier, delivered again in the 56th minute.

Displaying quick footwork inside the box, he expertly evaded his defender before calmly slotting the ball past the Antigua and Barbuda goalkeeper.

Coach Michael Findlay’s men dominated the game, crafting numerous scoring opportunities and should have won by a greater margin.

In the first half, Crichlow came close to breaking the deadlock when he connected with a pinpoint cross from Luke Robinson, heading just wide after an impressive jinking run from the left-back.

Robinson continued to be a threat, unleashing a venomous long-range effort that stung the palms of the Antigua and Barbuda goalkeeper.

Bermuda’s relentless pressure finally paid off shortly after the break. Crichlow, with dazzling footwork, nutmegged his marker before coolly finishing to give his team the lead.

Kole Hall narrowly missed doubling the lead, poking a shot just wide after some fine work down the right flank by the lively Crichlow.

At the other end, Bermuda goalkeeper Dale Eve was largely a spectator throughout the game but had a heart-stopping moment late on when Antigua and Barbuda forward Keon Greene squandered a golden chance, dragging his shot wide.

In a tense finish, Antigua and Barbuda’s frustrations boiled over deep into stoppage time when Vashami Allen was shown a straight red card for a violent push on Roger Lee.

Bermuda are second in the group after two games, with three points, three behind leaders Dominican Republic.
