The Ukrainian Football Association (UAF) has officially presented the new home and away kits for the national football team ahead of the 2024/2025 season.

According to UAF, the partnership with Adidas marks a return to the brand for the UAF, which previously collaborated with Joma from 2017 to 2024. The new long-term contract with Adidas reinforces the brand’s commitment as the exclusive supplier for all national teams, including the men’s, women’s, and youth squads.

The design of the new kits is inspired by the national flag of Ukraine and is crafted from 100% recycled materials. The technology used in the kits includes AERO READY, which features moisture-wicking properties and breathable mesh inserts for enhanced comfort, ensuring players and fans remain dry and comfortable during matches.

The Ukrainian national team will debut the new kits on October 11, 2024, during a UEFA Nations League match against Georgia.
