Ukraine-Georgia: Nations League match

The Ukrainian national football team will play a match against the Georgian team as part of the UEFA Nations League. Bookmakers believe that Ukrainians will win. «Glavkom» gathered information and predictions for you on this match. 

The match between Ukraine and Georgia will take place in Poznan at the «Poznan» stadium. The game will start at 21:45 Kyiv Time. This will be the third match for the Ukrainian team in the tournament. The Ukrainians lost the first two matches.

Bookmakers have set odds on the most likely goal scorer in this match. Experts expect Artem Dovbyk to score his first goal for the national team since June, with odds of 3.00. The odds for Yaremchuk scoring are 3.6, and for Georgia's leader Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to score a goal, – 3.5.

Ukraine ranks last in the group with zero points. The third Czech Republic has three points, the second Albania – three points, and the leader Georgia scored the most points – 6.

The Ukrainian betting company Favbet recognized the Ukrainian national team as a minimal favorite. The odds for the victory of the «blue-yellows» is 2.24, while the victory of the Georgian team is 3.45. The probability of a draw is estimated slightly higher with an odds of 3.35.

Lovers of open football can try a bet on a productive 2:2 draw, which has an attractive odds of 14.00. In addition, Artem Dovbyk's double will increase the winnings 13 times.

The Austrian company Bwin offered similar odds. They set odds of 2.15 on Ukraine's victory and 3.40 on Georgia's victory. A draw is estimated at 3.30.

A risky bet that both teams will score in each half has an attractive odds of 14.50. A bet on Ivan Kalyuzhny’s goal with Ukraine's victory will bring players a win 20 times more.

Recall that earlier we reported where and when to watch the Nations League match Ukraine-Georgia on October 11.

By the way, more than a quarter of a century ago, on October 9, 1999, one of the most emotional matches of the Ukrainian national team took place. In the last round of the qualification for the 2000 European Championship, the team played an away match against Russia and won. 

Recall, in the eighth round of the Second German Bundesliga, a strange event occurred. This league rarely gives rise to discussion, but a very strange match recently took place, which simply cannot be overlooked.
