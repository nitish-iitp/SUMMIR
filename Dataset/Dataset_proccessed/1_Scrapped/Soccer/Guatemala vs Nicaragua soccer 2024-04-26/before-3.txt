Brighton:

Brighton is currently winless in four Premier League matches and has slipped to 10th in the standings.
They have secured only two points from their last four games, with draws against Brentford and Burnley, alongside losses to Liverpool and Arsenal.
Roberto De Zerbi’s side struggled in their recent draw against Burnley, conceding late in the match before salvaging a point through a Burnley own goal.
Brighton’s injury list is extensive, with forwards Kaoru Mitoma, Evan Ferguson, and Julio Enciso all unavailable, along with midfielders Solly March, Jack Hinshelwood, James Milner, and Billy Gilmour. Defenders Adam Webster, Tariq Lamptey, and Pervis Estupiñán are also sidelined.

Man City:

Man City is on an impressive unbeaten streak of 29 matches, winning 23 of those games.
They have won their last three league matches convincingly, defeating Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, and Luton.
Despite a draw against Real Madrid and a narrow FA Cup win over Chelsea, Pep Guardiola’s side has maintained their dominance.
Man City displayed control and patience in their recent FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea, ultimately securing victory with a late goal from Bernardo Silva.
However, they will be without the services of striker Erling Haaland due to injury.
