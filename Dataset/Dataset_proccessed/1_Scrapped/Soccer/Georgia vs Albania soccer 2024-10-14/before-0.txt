Georgia will be bidding to return to winning ways when they continue their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign with a clash against Albania on Monday night.

The hosts will enter the match off the back of a 1-0 defeat to Ukraine, but they remain top of Group 1 in League B, while Albania are third, with the visitors losing 2-0 to the Czech Republic in their last game.

Georgia made a huge impression at Euro 2024, making it to the last-16 stage of the competition in their first-ever major tournament, and they famously recorded a 2-0 win over Portugal in the group stage.

Willy Sagnol's side then beat Czech Republic 4-1 in their opening 2024-25 Nations League fixture, before recording a 1-0 victory over Albania to move onto six points in Group 1 of League B.

The Crusaders will enter this match off the back of a 1-0 loss to Ukraine, with Mykhaylo Mudryk netting the only goal of the contest in the 35th minute, and it was a frustrating night for Sagnol's team.

Georgia remain top of their section, though, and they will be bidding to record a third win in the group ahead of their November fixtures with Ukraine and Czech Republic.

The Crusaders need to finish first to guarantee promotion, and they have been joined on six points by the Czech Republic, so there will be pressure on the hosts to return to winning ways on Monday night.

Albania actually opened their 2024-25 Nations League campaign with a 2-1 success over Ukraine, but they have lost their last two games in Group 1 of League B to Georgia and Czech Republic.

A total of three points from three matches has left them in third spot in the section, which would see them take part in a relegation playoff, but there is still plenty of football to be played over the next month.

Sylvinho's side have two home matches against the Czech Republic and Ukraine in November, so a positive result in this match would leave them in a position to finish in the top two.

The Red and Blacks were also present in the finals of this summer's European Championship, but they were unable to make it out of the group stage, collecting only one point from three matches.

Albania have not actually overcome Georgia since June 2005, but two of the last three meetings between these two sides have finished all square, while there was only one goal between them in the reverse game last month.

Georgia have not reported any injury problems from their clash with Ukraine last time out, so head coach Sagnol is expected to have the same squad available for what is likely to be a tricky fixture.

Giorgi Mamardashvili and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia were two of their stars at Euro 2024, and the pair will once again be among the starters on Monday night, while captain Guram Kashia will be another notable inclusion.

Georges Mikautadze was actually the joint-top goalscorer at Euro 2024 with three goals, and he will again feature in the final third of the field, with the forward bidding to add to his impressive total of 14 goals in 32 caps.

As for Albania, there is once again expected to be a spot through the middle for Mirlind Daku, with the 26-year-old aiming to add to the one goal that he has scored for his country.

Elseid Hysaj is the captain and standout player, with the Lazio defender again set to feature in the XI, while the experienced Thomas Strakosha will be a notable inclusion between the sticks.

Kristjan Asllani, who plays his club football for Inter Milan, will continue in midfield, while there should also be a starting role for Rangers attacker Nedim Bajrami.


Georgia possible starting lineup:
Mamardashvili; Gvelesiani, Kashia, Dvali; Kakabadze, Kochorashvili, Kiteischvili, Chakvetadze, Lochoshvili; Mikautadze, Kvaratskhelia

Albania possible starting lineup:
Strakosha; Hysaj, Ismaili, Kumbulla, Mitaj; Laci, Ramadani; Asani, Asllani, Bajrami; Daku



We say: Georgia 1-0 Albania

This is a tough match to call, with Albania certainly capable of picking up a positive result, but Georgia will be bidding to bounce back from a disappointing result last time out, and we are backing the hosts to navigate their way to all three points.
