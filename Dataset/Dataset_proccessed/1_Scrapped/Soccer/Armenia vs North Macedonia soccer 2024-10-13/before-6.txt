Armenia and North Macedonia face off on Sunday in UEFA Nations League action. Watch for free on Fubo today.

Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium is set to host the exciting weekend matchup between home side Armenia and visiting nation North Macedonia on Sunday in UEFA Nations League action. The tournament has gotten off to a thrilling start so far in the first couple matchdays of the 2024 edition. In League A, reigning champion Spain was unable to break the deadlock against a formidable Serbian national team. The Spanish side did dominate in terms of ball possession (74%) as has been the case for years now, but couldn’t convert its 21 shots and five on target into any goals.

Spain then bounced back on matchday two to take a dominant 4-1 victory. Joselu, Ferran Torres, Fabián Ruíz and Robin Le Normand all got on the scoresheet to get la Furia Roja into the win column.

Meanwhile, last year’s runner-up France also got off on the wrong foot on matchday one, losing to fellow powerhouse Italy 3-1. Bradley Barcola scored the French team’s lone goal, while Federico Dimarco, Davide Frattesi and Giacomo Raspadori got the Italians on the board.

Portugal looks like an early favorite after winning both of their matches in September. The first was a 2-1 finish over Croatia, where Diogo Dalot and Cristiano Ronaldo secured all three points with their strikes.

The Portuguese found another 2-1 victory on matchday two over Scotland, thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Ronaldo again.

The action continues on Sunday when Armenia and North Macedonia face off at Vazgyen Sargsyan Republican Stadium to continue matchday four of the competition.

Regional restrictions may apply.
