Panel. Sustainability: ridiculously choppy road to 2030

Sponsored roundtable. Doubling down on value: legal department as a business partner

Panel. Legal teams and the future of work

In-house legal departments and their leaders must satisfy the endless business demand to provide “more for less” while facing exhausted and change-weary teams, fierce competition for the most skilled workers and the prospect of an economic downturn. Success will take creativity and collaborative thinking about internal talent mobility, non-linear career paths, improving skills for new requirements, organisational change, team resilience and iterations of the hybrid work model. How is the legal department faring? What are the key capabilities of the future legal team? How are they being built?
