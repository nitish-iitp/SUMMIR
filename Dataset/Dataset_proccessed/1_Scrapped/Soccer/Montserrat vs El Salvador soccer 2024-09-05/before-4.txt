5 Reasons Not to Choose a Side Stone Engagement Ring
5 Reasons Not to Choose a Side Stone Engagement Ring
3 September 2024

If you’re thinking about popping the question with a side stone engagement ring this summer, you’re in good company. Many couples are fans of these sparkling beauties, which feature shimmering accent stones flanking the center diamond or gemstone. These additional stones help to highlight and complement the center stone, creating a more intricate and eye-catching design.

While their glam factor is undeniable, side stone engagement rings supposedly have some down sides that may make you think twice about buying one. The question is - are these drawbacks accurate? In this blog, we highlight five reasons why you might have second thoughts about choosing a side stone engagement ring (and why those reasons might be wrong).

What is a Side Stone Engagement Ring?

As their name suggests, side stone engagement rings are special and unique pieces that include smaller gems on either side of the center stone, enhancing the overall sparkle and design of the ring. Depending on the design, they can be halfway or all around the band. Choosing the right size and cut for the dazzling side diamonds is crucial to ensure they complement rather than overpower the main attraction. Typically, they should be a quarter to a third of the center diamond's size, with popular cuts including baguette, marquise, round, and pear.

Despite earning fans like A-listers Meghan Markle, Heidi Klum, and Priyanka Chopra, some hesitate when considering diamond rings with side stones, fearing it may not be their perfect fit. Let's explore the top five misconceptions surrounding these stunning diamond engagement rings and set the record straight.

Reason #1: Side Stones Steal the Spotlight from the Center Stone

Imagine this: you’ve found the perfect diamond, a dazzling gem that symbolizes your unique love story. Now, why would you want anything to steal its spotlight? Side stones, by adding extra sparkle, might draw attention away from your stunning centerpiece- won’t it?

Here’s the twist: side stones don’t overshadow the center stone—they enhance it! By framing your main diamond, side stones add depth and brilliance, making it look like a larger diamond. By adding more glam and sparkle, they ensure that the entire ring captures the light from every angle.

The Kristen is a captivating and brilliant example of this classic engagement ring style. Its band is adorned with round and marquise-cut lab grown diamond accents while twin round brilliant stones flank the larger center diamond, strategically enhancing its size and presence. This design not only amplifies the sparkle of the central gem but also creates a symphony of light, making it an exquisite choice for those who adore both classic beauty and contemporary sophistication.

Reason #2: Side Stones Can Be Overpowering

This one is partly true. We all love a bit of bling, but there’s a fine line between dazzling and overpowering. Some couples are concerned that side stones, if not sized correctly, can overshadow the center stone, creating a look that’s more chaotic than chic.

Reason #3: Side Stone Rings Are Trendy, Not Timeless

Trends come and go, and the last thing you want is for your engagement ring to feel dated in a few years. Aren’t side stones a little more than a trend that’s here today and gone tomorrow?

Reason #5: Side Stones Are Fragile and High Maintenance

Adding more stones means more potential for damage and higher maintenance, doesn’t it? The thought of constantly checking and cleaning multiple stones might seem daunting enough for you to choose a simpler engagement ring setting.
