Football/CAN&#39;2023: Bubista “delighted” with the performance of the Cape Verde team
The national coach, Bubista, was today “delighted” with the performance of the Cape Verde team, in the 1-0 victory against Mauritania, which dictated passage to the quarter-finals of the African Cup of Nations ( CAN&#39;2023).

Football/CAN&#39;2023: Bubista “delighted” with the performance of the Cape Verde team

“We are charting our path; We know that there are many teams bigger than us, but we are trying to concentrate on our game to have the opportunity to face the African powers”, said Bubista, in a press conference, after the triumph over Mauritania.

“Our goal is to work to become stronger and stronger,” he added.

In contrast, Mauritania coach Amir Abdou was left very disappointed after his team conceded a “ridiculous” late goal.

“We are a little disappointed to come away with this result, especially due to an individual error like that. We didn’t deserve this”, lamented Abdou.

Cape Verde won its third game at CAN, more than all the victories it had achieved in the sum of its three previous appearances.

The national team now awaits the winner of the duel between Morocco and South Africa, which takes place this Tuesday, at 7 pm, to find out their opponent in the quarter-finals.

It should be noted that Cape Verde reached this stage of the competition for the first time in 2013, when the competition was contested by 16 teams, and was eliminated at the time by Ghana (2-0).
