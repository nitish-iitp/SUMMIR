SA vs Cape Verde: Will Bafana wear ‘winning’ white kit?

Which kit should Bafana Bafana wear in their Afcon quarter-final clash against Cape Verde? For many supporters, the answer is white!

Bafana Bafana will face off against Cape Verde in the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) quarter-final clash on Saturday, 3 February.

While they’re known to wear traditional colours of yellow and green, could the South African squad be switching up by wearing their white alternative kit?

Or could they perhaps don their striped retro kit instead?

The match will take place at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium and will be aired at 22:00 SA time.

WHITE IS A WINNER!

While it’s unclear at this stage which jersey Bafana Bafana wears, it will undoubtedly be one that doesn’t clash with Cape Verde’s home, away, and third kits in blue, white, and red, respectively.

But fans are hoping SA brings out their “Real Madrid – inspired” all white look, which helped them beat Afcon favourites Morocco last week.

According to an iDiski poll, the Afcon alternative kit was a clear favourite amongst South Africans.

“In white we win,” tweeted one fan. Another added: “It’s white for me since it restored joy, faith and pride”.
