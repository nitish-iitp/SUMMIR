AFCON 2023
African Cup of Nations is into the quarter-final stage with eight countries left in the competition, following a successful completion of the Round of 16 Knockout stage yesterday, Tuesday, January 30th, 2023.


Eight countries, and four matches are left in the competition, and below are the full Quarter-Finals fixtures with venue, date, and time.

1. Nigeria vs Angola

Date: Friday, February 2, 2024

Venue: Felix Houphouet-Boigny

Time: 6:00 pm

2. DR Congo vs Guinea

Date: Friday, February 2, 2024

Venue: Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara

Time: 9:00 pm

3. Mali vs Cote d'Ivoire

Date: Saturday, February 3, 2024

Venue: Stade de Bouaké

Time: 6:00 pm

4. Cape Verde vs South Africa

Date: Saturday, February 3, 2024

Venue: Stade Charles Konan Banny de Yamoussoukro

Time: 9:00 pm.


Analysis


The Cabo Verde vs South Africa match is projected to be the most interesting game we are looking out to watch at the 2023 Quarter-Final Stage of Ivory Coast 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.


Nigeria vs Angola will have Nigeria combine its performances when it used a 5-4-1 formation against Ivory Coast and 3-4-3 to knock out the Indomitable Lion of Cameroon at the Round of 16 if defeating the determined Angolans will come to pass.

Mali vs Ivory Coast may be too close to call for the two sides are up for something. Not that Ivorians play a fantastic football but the spirit of Host Nation may keep them to match up the feet of Mali.

Dr Congo vs Guinea is a game of luck and luck. Congo is in the quarter-final of AFCON 2023 with no single win in its over 360 minutes of Football normal playing time, so far in the competition. That's lucky. However, Guinea is so luckily determined, as well, that it thrashed the Republic of Guinea out of the competition at the [98th minute] stoppage time. Meaning Guinea never calls it a day until the last second of the clock ticks.

Very Interesting #AFCON 2023, the VAR has been doing great, I think better than what the European Football competitions have tapped from the innovative football sporting software.

Besides AFCON Referees have been doing wonderfully well, so far, only that they are easily predictable when it comes to VAR and guess what that is the beauty of the innovation.

Easily predictable in the sense that when a Referee decides to contact VAR on a disputed goal, all scenarios at the ongoing AFCON have led to the goals being canceled by the referee, arguably, there is no exception so far.

Also, checking VAR for a tackle on an opponent inside box 18 has always led to penalties.


These are not the downside, rather they are the beauty of introducing VAR to the sporting competition, which has been fully utilized at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations.
