Aiming to record their maiden victory of 2024, Denmark will welcome a relatively in-form Faroe Islands side to Brondby Stadion on Tuesday night for an international friendly.

The Red and Whites played out a goalless draw versus Switzerland during their first match of the international period, whilst Landslioio won handsomely against minnows Liechtenstein.

Following a disappointing 2-0 loss against Northern Ireland to round off a decent 2023, Denmark started the new calendar year with a goalless draw against Switzerland at Parken on Saturday night, with neither Kasper Schmeichel, Inter Milan stopper Yann Sommer nor Yvon Mvogo being breached in their respective nets.

After a run to the semi-finals of the belated Euro 2020 - in which they were cruelly dumped out in extra time versus Gareth Southgate's England - the Red and Whites will be dark horses to go two steps further this summer and lift their second-ever European Championships following the 1992 success in Sweden.

Kasper Hjulmand's men lost just twice in the entirety of 2023 as they finished at the top of their Euro qualifying section, finishing ahead of Slovenia on head-to-head and four points clear of third-placed Finland, who saw their chances of qualification dashed by Rob Page's Wales in the playoff on Thursday night.

Looking ahead, the Red and Whites face a tricky-looking group at Euro 2024, facing Southgate's Three Lions, the aforementioned Slovenia and Aleksandr Mitrovic's Serbia - a side which Denmark will face at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena on the final day of that particular section.

Starting 2024 off on an extremely-strong note, the Faroe Islands produced a magnificent performance against Liechtenstein, with a first-half brace from Paetur Petersen - alongside second-period strikes from Adrian Justinussen and Arnbjorn Svensson securing a four-goal success.

Having last won an international fixture all the way back in September 2022 against Euro 2020 dark horses Turkey, fans of the Landslioio can be forgiven for being a little shocked at the moment, especially considering their woeful record in the calendar year of 2023.

In a tight Euro 2024 qualifying group that was hotly-contested by Albania, Czech Republic, Poland and Moldova, the Faroe Islands were certainly placed in the category of section whipping boys, drawing two and losing six of their eight matches Group E, scoring on just two occasions.

Interestingly, all of the goalscorers for Hakan Ericson's men in the win over Liechtenstein last time out had failed to make the net ripple in any of their previous appearances for the national side, with hopes that a change in fortunes can lead to a positive 2024 for the team.

After failing to find the net last time out, Denmark could rotate their attacking lineup for Tuesday night, with the likes of Jonas Wind and Kasper Dolberg pushing for starts.

Despite dropping down to the Championship with Leicester City last year, Jannik Vestergaard is still a key figure for the Red and Whites, meaning that he should play alongside Simon Kjaer and Crystal Palace's Joachim Andersen once again.

Playing the full 90 minutes in the stalemate versus the Swiss, Manchester United's Christian Eriksen could be dropped to the bench for this one.

Having netted a brace in the last game, 25-year-old Petersen should retain his spot in the XI, with Joan Edmundsson hoping to keep his place in attack also.

Centre-back Svensson could be rewarded with a starting berth on Tuesday after scoring last week, meaning that Andrias Edmundsson is likely to make way.


Denmark possible starting lineup:
Schmeichel; Andersen, Kjaer, Vestergaard; Maehle, Hjulmand, Jensen, Delaney; Kristiansen; Wind, Hojlund

Faroe Islands possible starting lineup:
Gestsson; Sorensen, Wardum, Svensson, Davidsen; Joensen, Vatnhamar, Hendriksson, Justinussen; Petersen, Edmundsson



We say: Denmark 2-0 Faroe Islands

After failing to find the net against Switzerland, Denmark will be raring to rake in the goals versus a visiting side who have only won once in the past 18 months.

Faroe Islands enjoyed a morale-boosting victory over Liechtenstein last time out, however we do not believe that Landslioio will be able to make it back-to-back successes in this international period.
