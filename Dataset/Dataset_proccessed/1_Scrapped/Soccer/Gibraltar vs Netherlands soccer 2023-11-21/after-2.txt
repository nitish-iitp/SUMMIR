EURO QUALIFYING
GIBRALTAR 0-6 NETHERLANDS - CALVIN STENGS SCORES HAT-TRICK AS DUTCH SIGN OFF QUALIFYING IN STYLE WITH THUMPING WIN
BYMICHAEL HINCKS

UPDATED 21/11/2023 AT 22:24 GMT

The Netherlands signed off their Euro 2024 qualifying in style as they thumped Gibraltar 6-0 in their last game thanks to a hat-trick from Calvin Stengs. Mats Wieffer, Teun Koopmeiners and Cody Gakpo were the other names on the scoresheet. The Dutch had already wrapped up second place in the group after their win earlier in the same break and will now look ahead to see who they are drawn against.

FARO, GIBRALTAR - NOVEMBER 21: Calvin Stengs of Holland celebrates 0-1 with Jordan Teze of Holland, Mats Wieffer of Holland, Donyell Malen of Holland, Wout Weghorst of Holland during the EURO Qualifier match between Gibraltar v Holland at the Estadio Alga

Calvin Stengs scored a hat-trick as the Netherlands cantered to victory in their final UEFA Euro 2024 qualifier on a night where Gibraltar will be somewhat content with the 6-0 scoreline as well.
Victory for the Dutch, who qualified for the Euros from Group B when beating the Republic of Ireland on Saturday, was never in doubt – but just by how many was the real question after Gibraltar’s record 14-0 defeat at France on the weekend.

As it was, the Dutch “only” led 3-0 at half-time, with Stengs and Mats Wieffer scoring their first-ever goals for the Netherlands before Teun Koopmeiners scored their third.

After the break, Stengs - making his first international appearance for more than two years - completed his hat-trick in front of a crowd largely dominated by Dutch fans in southern Portugal, the Feyenoord forward certainly making a statement as Ronald Koeman considers his options ahead of next summer.
Cody Gakpo then came off the bench to make it six, and for Gibraltar it compounded another forgetful campaign; without a goal and without a point as eight defeats made for a goal difference of -41.
TALKING POINT - THE POT 3 TEAM TO AVOID?
Little was going to be learned from this night, although Ronald Koeman will be delighted with the contributions from Stengs and Wieffer, but despite falling a distant second best to France in this group you would argue the Netherlands remain the team to avoid when it comes to Pot 3 for the Euro 2024 draw on December 2.
With England in Pot One along with hosts Germany, Portugal, France, Spain and Belgium, all six will surely want to avoid the Dutch in their group – on their day still capable of grinding out results.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - CALVIN STENGS (NETHERLANDS)
How could it not be? Though Donyell Malen was a constant threat, Stengs gets the nod for his quality finishing – all three goals coming from his left boot. The opposition matters not, getting your first, second and third goals for your nation goes down as a night to remember for the 24-year-old.
PLAYER RATINGS
Gibraltar: Coleing 5, Sergeant 5, R. Chipolina 4, Olivero 5, Mouelhi 4, J. Chipolina 5, Walker 4, Pozo 4, De Haro 5, Casciaro 4, De Barr 4. Subs: Jolley 5, Badr 5, El Hmidi 5, Coombes 5, Peacock n/a.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
10’ - GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-1 NETHERLANDS - There’s the first for the Dutch, and it comes after some decent build-up play with Calvin Stengs finding the bottom corner with a first-time effort from inside the area.
23’ - GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-2 NETHERLANDS - And just like that, Wieffer makes amends. The Feyenoord midfielder makes no mistake this time, heading in from a Veerman corner to put the Dutch two up.
38’ - GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-3 NETHERLANDS - This time it’s Teun Koopmeiners and it’s another cross that is the undoing for Gibraltar, as Hartman plays it along the ground and Koopmeiners opens his body to place it beyond Coleing.
50’ - GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-4 NETHERLANDS - And it’s a second for Stengs! Five minutes into the second half and it’s four for the Netherlands as Stengs plays a lovely one-two with Malen before firing home, wrongfooting Coleing as he places it into the near corner.
62’ - GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-5 NETHERLANDS - It’s a hat-trick for Stengs! The Feyenoord forward is certainly enjoying his night, getting his third with his left foot once more, placing the ball into the top corner. The smile says it all.
81’ - GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-6 NETHERLANDS - And Gakpo gets In On The Act © ® ™. The Liverpool forward sends in an in-swinging cross and it evades everyone to bounce into the far corner.
KEY STATS
Stengs was playing his first match for the Netherlands since a 7-0 away win against Gibraltar in March 2021. He played just nine minutes that night.
Koopmeiners scored his second goal for the Netherlands, a year after netting against Wales.
