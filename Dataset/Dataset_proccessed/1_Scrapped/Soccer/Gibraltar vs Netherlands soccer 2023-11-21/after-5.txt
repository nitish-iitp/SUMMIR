REPORT
Calvin Stengs scored a hat-trick as the Netherlands cantered to victory in their final Euro 2024 qualifier on a night where Gibraltar will be somewhat content with the 6-0 scoreline as well.
Victory for the Dutch, who qualified for the Euros from Group B when beating the Republic of Ireland on Saturday, was never in doubt – but just by how many was the real question after Gibraltar’s record 14-0 defeat at France on the weekend.

STENGS SCORES HAT-TRICK AS DUTCH SIGN OFF QUALIFYING IN STYLE WITH THUMPING WIN

FT
FULL-TIME
A campaign that started with a 4-0 defeat in France ends in a routine win for the Dutch, who had already sealed second and a place in Euro 2024 before tonight – with this match just about how many.
As it was, it was six, with Gibraltar ending another forgetful campaign on zero points, zero goals, and -41 goal difference overall.
90'
TIME ADDED ON
Just the three minutes…
88'
‘JUST’ SIX?
In a November where they’ve conceded 20 goals, perhaps Gibraltar will take this. It had the makings for double figures once more, so keeping the Dutch to “just” six might be about par.
84'
DID DALLINGA GET A TOUCH?
Replay after replay but it remains unclear. It matters little, but to Gakpo and Dallinga arguably - they'll both watch that one again and again later and have a little desbate as to whether Dallinga gets the slightest of touches on that cross.

GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-6 NETHERLANDS
And Gakpo gets In On The Act © ® ™. The Liverpool forward sends in an in-swinging cross and it evades everyone to bounce into the far corner.

GAKPO ON
Klopp will have been delighted to se Van Dijk go off at half-time, he may be crossing his fingers for 15 minutes with Gakpo coming on now.
Malen goes off - he's been quality all night.

DID YOU KNOW
Stengs is playing his first match for the Netherlands since... a 7-0 away win against Gibraltar in March 2021.
He played just the nine minutes that night.

ALMOST
Almost an own goal to forget from De Haro, as he slices his kick from a corner just a whisker wide of his own near post.

GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-5 NETHERLANDS
It’s a hat-trick for Stengs! The Feyenoord forward is certainly enjoying his first appearance for the Netherlands since March 2021, getting his third with his left foot once more, placing the ball into the top corner. The smile says it all.
VAR is checking if there’s anything wrong with the build-up… but there ain’t. Goal stands.

POT 3?!
Just looking at the pots, which are of course still taking a bit of shape tonight...
BUT, the Netherlands are going to be in Pot 3 for the Euro 2024 draw - surely the team you want to avoid in that pot.
50'
GOAL! GIBRALTAR 0-4 NETHERLANDS
And it’s a second for Stengs! Five minutes into the second half and it’s four for the Netherlands as Stengs plays a lovely one-two with Malen before firing home, wrongfooting Coleing as he places it into the near corner.
