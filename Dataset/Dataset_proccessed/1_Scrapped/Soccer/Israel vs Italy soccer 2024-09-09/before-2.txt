Italy lineup vs. Israel: Predicted XI for UEFA Nations League fixture

Shaking off a Euro 2024 hangover, Italy commenced their latest UEFA Nations League campaign with a superb win in Paris, and they will meet Israel in their second League A Group 2 match on Monday.

Luciano Spalletti has overhauled his squad and his tactics for the challenge ahead - namely securing a top-two finish in a group also featuring France and Belgium - and after making eight changes to the team that crashed out of the Euros for Friday's win, less turnover is now expected.

Ahead of captain Gianluigi Donnarumma, the Azzurri field a three-man defence, which will be without Arsenal's Riccardo Calafiori, who sustained an unfortunate injury in their opener.

As Calafiori is ruled out, Napoli's big-money signing Alessandro Buongiorno should step into a defence led by another left-footer, Inter Milan centre-back Alessandro Bastoni.

Spalletti recently said he will stick to either a 3-5-2 or 3-4-2-1 formation from now on, and his wing-backs are set to play a major part.

On the left, Destiny Udogie will find it hard to supplant Federico Dimarco, who combined with Sandro Tonali to score a brilliant goal against France, while Andrea Cambiaso and Raoul Bellanova are in competition to start on the right.

A mid-20s trio gave Italy plenty of energy in midfield at Parc des Princes, and the recalled Tonali may again join Samuele Ricci and Davide Frattesi in the engine room; after winning his first cap as a substitute, though, a start for Marco Brescianini cannot be ruled out.

While further news of Calafiori's condition is awaited, Spalletti will definitely be without Nicolo Barella (sinus surgery) and Gianluca Scamacca (ACL). In the latter's absence, his Atalanta BC teammate Mateo Retegui will vie with Moise Kean to start up front.

Italy possible starting lineup: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Buongiorno, Bastoni; Bellanova, Ricci, Tonali, Frattesi, Dimarco; Raspadori, Retegui
