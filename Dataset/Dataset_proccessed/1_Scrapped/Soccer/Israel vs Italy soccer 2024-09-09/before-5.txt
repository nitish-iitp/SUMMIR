Can Italy Maintain Their Momentum Against Israel?
Israel’s defensive struggles: Israel have conceded three goals per game on average in their last four matches, reflecting significant defensive issues. This was further highlighted against Belgium, where they allowed three goals despite only conceding 10 shots, exposing their susceptibility to clinical attacks.
Italy’s midfield dominance: Italy’s midfield trio of Tonali, Frattesi, and Ricci were instrumental in their win against France. With a passing accuracy of 85.9% across the team, they controlled the tempo and are expected to do the same against an inexperienced Israel side, which averages only 36% possession.
Israel’s lack of creativity: Israel have averaged just two shots on target per game, indicating their struggles in attack. Against Belgium, their 10 shots produced just one goal, and they only managed one corner throughout the match, showing how ineffective they are at creating chances.
Best Bet


Italy to Win and Under 2.5 Goals @ 27/10




BET HERE


Reasoning
The best bet for this match is Italy to win with under 2.5 goals. Italy's superior quality should secure victory, but Israel's likely deep defensive setup and Italy's controlled, low-scoring approach point to a tactical, modest-scoring affair.
Odds subject to change



	

Italy head into their second UEFA Nations League match brimming with confidence after a commanding 3-1 victory over France. Now, they face Israel, a team struggling to find their feet in this campaign after a 3-1 defeat to Belgium. The game will take place in Hungary, due to security concerns in Israel, and it represents a crucial moment for both teams. Italy, eager to build momentum under new manager Luciano Spalletti, seek to continue their resurgence, while Israel will aim to avoid relegation from League A, having recently been promoted from League B.

Israel’s task is daunting. Not only do they lack home advantage, but they are also up against a rejuvenated Italy side who appear to be finding their rhythm after a lacklustre Euro 2024 campaign. Despite Italy’s history of recent defensive frailties, their quality in attack and midfield suggests they could be too strong for an inexperienced Israel team.

The standout bet for this clash is for Italy to win and under 2.5 goals. Italy’s superior quality in both attack and midfield is expected to secure them the victory, but the relatively low-scoring nature of this prediction stems from various key factors. While Italy managed to score three goals against a much stronger French side, this upcoming match against Israel is expected to be a different tactical affair.

Israel, for all their defensive issues, are likely to sit deep and focus on frustrating the Italians by limiting spaces. This could keep the scoring in check, especially given that Italy are not necessarily known for high-scoring matches in recent competitions. Their recent trend of lower-scoring games, particularly against teams of a lower calibre, suggests that this encounter could be more about control than a goal-fest.

Italy will probably dominate possession, just as they did against France with 46% of the ball, but may find it harder to break down Israel’s low block. Israel’s weakness lies in their defensive structure, as they have conceded an average of three goals per game so far. However, they are likely to play cautiously, especially knowing that their chances of keeping up with Italy in an open match are slim.

One of the main reasons for backing this bet is Italy’s recent performances. They’ve found a new impetus under Spalletti, who made eight changes from the side that lost to Switzerland in the Euros. With players like Frattesi and Tonali stepping up, Italy have become more tactically versatile. However, they are not yet a free-scoring team. The Azzurri are more likely to take control early and manage the game to avoid risks, particularly given Israel’s limited attacking threat.

Furthermore, Israel, who will rely heavily on players like Manor Solomon and Oscar Gloukh to create chances, have shown little ability to break down well-organised defences. Their 36% possession and lack of creativity in the final third against Belgium demonstrate how they struggle when faced with a disciplined backline.

“Italy are playing with a new sense of purpose, but this is still a team rebuilding its foundations. Against an Israel side likely to sit deep, expect a controlled performance but not a goal extravaganza,” says BettingTips4You.com expert Luca Semproni. “Backing Italy to win with under 2.5 goals gives you the best value here.”

Correct Score Prediction: Italy 2-0 Israel

Given the rationale for the best bet, a 2-0 victory for Italy seems a logical correct score prediction. Italy’s defence may not have been at its sharpest recently—conceding in five consecutive matches—but Israel’s limited attacking threat suggests that a clean sheet is possible for the Azzurri.

Israel, despite their attacking options in players like Khalaili and Solomon, have struggled to create clear-cut chances. In their match against Belgium, they managed only two shots on target from ten attempts, illustrating their lack of cutting edge in front of goal. Against a far more disciplined Italian backline, their opportunities are expected to be even fewer.

Italy, on the other hand, will look to control the game with their midfield trio of Frattesi, Tonali, and Ricci. With Raspadori and Retegui up front, the Azzurri have the firepower to score more than once, but it is likely that their approach will be more pragmatic, aiming to secure the points with minimal fuss. A second-half goal to seal the victory after taking the lead early on seems highly plausible.

Given Israel’s lack of goals from open play and their defensive vulnerabilities, a 2-0 scoreline fits the expected narrative of the game—Italy dominating but not pushing for a high-scoring affair.
