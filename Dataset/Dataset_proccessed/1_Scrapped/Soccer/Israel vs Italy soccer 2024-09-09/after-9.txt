Davide Frattesi and Moise Kean’s first Italy goal in three years sealed a 2-1 win over Israel, as the Azzurri take control of their Nations League group.

Belgium capitulated 2-0 to France in Lyon this evening, so this puts the Italians three points clear at the top of Group A2.

The Azzurri began a new era with their 3-1 victory away to France on Friday, but lost Riccardo Calafiori and Lorenzo Pellegrini to injury. Luciano Spalletti made several changes, bringing in Federico Gatti, Alessandro Buongiorno, Raoul Bellanova, Moise Kean and Giacomo Raspadori. Israel were beaten 3-1 by Belgium, so brought Gavriel Kanichowsky, Roy Revivo and Dor Peretz into the starting XI.

The game was played on neutral turf at the Boszik Arena in Budapest.

See how it unfolded on the Liveblog.

Raoul Bellanova had to make a crucial interception to stop Manor Solomon being sent clear by Gavriel Kanichowsky’s intelligent through ball, while Federico Dimarco fired over from a tricky angle on a free kick.

Alessandro Bastoni was taking the more advanced role usually held by Calafiori and whipped a cross from the left that was inches beyond a Davide Frattesi tap-in from six yards.

There was a big chance for Israel on 31 minutes with a rapid counter-attack, finalised by Manor Solomon blasting off target.

Italy broke the deadlock with a curious goal, as Dimarco got down the left and whipped in a cross that his Inter teammate Frattesi cushioned in from six yards off his chest, as it was too low for the header and too high for a volley. It consolidated Frattesi’s status as top scorer under Luciano Spalletti with six goals.

Moments later, Raspadori cut inside and his deflected effort was smothered. After the restart, Frattesi almost got another when sent through by his Inter teammate Alessandro Bastoni in a very advanced role, forcing a save at the near post.

Gianluigi Donnarumma was called into action too on 54 minutes, as Dor Peretz’s scuffed finish was flicked on from close range by Sagiv Jehezkel.

Soon after, Federico Gatti had to make a decisive block on Liel Abada, who had managed to turn and shoot from eight yards.

Instead, Italy doubled their lead when Frattesi sent Raspadori through the centre, his effort was parried into the path of Kean to score from eight yards. It was the new Fiorentina striker’s first Italy goal in precisely three years.

Tonali also tested the shot-stopper from the edge of the box and had the ball in the net on 75 minutes, but was offside on the Kean assist.

Marco Brescianini went on a solo run to go down between two defenders, but Revivo got the ball.

Italy again failed to keep a clean sheet, because a free kick was flicked on by two Israeli heads until Mohammad Abu Fani was quickest to react, firing through a sea of legs from 14 yards.

Disappointed not to score another goal at least and with the silly goal at the end. A decent performance. 2 wins out of 2 good start. Would still like to see Lucca and pinamonti given a chance to see how they do. Overall a lot more positive, also got barella to come back, hope going forward.
