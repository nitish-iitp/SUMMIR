Preview: North Macedonia vs. Armenia - prediction, team news, lineups

North Macedonia are set to host Armenia in the UEFA Nations League C on Tuesday at Tose Proeski Arena in each side's second game of the 2024-25 iteration of the tournament.

The home side are in second place in Group 1 with one point after they drew 1-1 with Faroe Islands on September 7, while the visitors are first with three points after they beat Latvia 4-1 on the same date.

The hosts dominated the ball against Faroe Islands, but despite having accumulated 68% possession, they were unable to make the most of the numerous chances they created.

Viljormur Davidsen managed to capitalise on a spell of early pressure when he gave Faroe Islands the lead in the ninth minute from the penalty spot, but Enis Bardhi equalised for North Macedonia after converting his own spot kick in the 49th minute.

Though Lions boss Blagoja Milevski will be pleased that his side were able to generate four big chances and 17 shots, he will be concerned that they faced 11 attempts and three big chances.

The result means that Milevski's team have now failed to win any of their last seven matches, as well as 16 of their last 20 fixtures.

In their last eight competitive games, North Macedonia have won just once, drawn three times and lost on four occasions.

Opponents Armenia come into the clash after a convincing win against Latvia, in which goals from Vahan Bichakhchyan, Lucas Zelarayan and Eduard Spertsyan, as well as an own goal from Kaspars Dubra, gave them a much deserved victory.

Latvia were restricted to just three shots and one attempt on target in the entire game and in fact only managed to score due to an own goal from Georgii Arutiunian in the ninth minute.

Armenia had 60% possession and were able to produce 16 shots but interestingly only managed to create two big chances despite their undoubted superiority.

If there was anything to nitpick about his side's performance, Havakakan boss Oleksandr Petrakov could point to the fact that his team have kept no clean sheets in their last 22 matches.

However, Petrakov might also highlight that his side have scored in each of their last four games and have also won their two most recent fixtures by a cumulative score of 6-2.

Armenia will have to improve their away form if they hope to win on Tuesday considering they have lost their last five on the road and have only won once in their last 19 away matches.

Midfielders Enis Bardhi and Isnik Alimi started in a double pivot for North Macedonia against Faroe Islands, and they are likely to feature once again.

Centre-back Ahmed Iljazovski was substituted at half time of that match for Ezgjan Alioski, who has played as a left-back, wing-back and in a more advanced position, and he could come into the team from the start on Tuesday.

As for the visitors, centre-back Andre Calisir was taken off in the 76th minute due to injury, and he may be replaced in the starting lineup by Sergey Muradyan.

Elsewhere, Armenia could select a similar XI to the one that beat Latvia, so expect the likes of Ugochukwu Iwu and Eduard Spertsyan to feature in midfield.


North Macedonia possible starting lineup:
Dimitrievski; Dimoski, Serafimov, Musliu, Alioski; Bardhi, Alimi; Miovski, Qamili, Churlinov; Elmas

Armenia possible starting lineup:
Cancarevic; Muradyan, Haroyan, Harutyunyan; Hovhannisyan, Spertsyan, Iwu, Tiknizyan; Bichakhchyan, Zelarayan, Serobyan



We say: North Macedonia 1-3 Armenia

Although Armenia have been poor away from home for some time, they could take advantage of North Macedonia if they are as defensively susceptible on Tuesday as they were against Faroe Islands.

It would not be surprising if Armenia were to continue their winning form considering their goalscoring exploits in their last two games.
