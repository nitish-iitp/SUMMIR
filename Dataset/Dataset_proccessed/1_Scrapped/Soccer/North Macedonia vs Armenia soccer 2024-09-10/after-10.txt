Armenia is set to take on North Macedonia on Tuesday in a UEFA Nations League contest. Watch this soccer match live on Fubo.

One could hardly have expected Armenia to make a much stronger start to life in this year’s UEFA Nations League than a 4-1 annihilation of Latvia in its opener. However, the National Team will nonetheless look to replicate that feat when it travels to North Macedonia in its second Group C4 outing, targeting another scalp as it looks to finish top of the pool and gain promotion to League B. Standing in its way is a North Macedonia side that settled for a share of the spoils after drawing 1-1 away to the Faroe Islands on Saturday, targeting a marked improvements come Tuesday.

Armenia travels to Tose Proeski Arena with a spring in its step after hammering Latvia on the weekend, and a repeat result in Skopje will really set the team on a path to first place.

Latvia put up some initial resistance and equalized after Armenia took a lead within six minutes on Saturday, but a Kaspars Dubra own goal helped put the icing on the cake:

There can be no guarantee Oleksandr Petrakov’s side will benefit from the same sort of gift in midweek, with North Macedonia liable to put up a much stronger fight.

That’s despite the fact the Lynxes are seven games without a win, albeit at least managing a share of the points from their trip to Scandinavia over the weekend.

While that may be the case, it’s worth noting North Macedonia hasn’t lost a game—friendly or otherwise—on home soil in almost 18 months, holding each of Italy and England to draws over the past year.

Regional restrictions may apply.
