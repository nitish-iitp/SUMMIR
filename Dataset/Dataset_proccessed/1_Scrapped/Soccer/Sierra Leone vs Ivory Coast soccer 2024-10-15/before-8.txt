Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast will face off for just the second time in a matter of days when they go head-to-head in Tuesday's clash at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Stadium in Monrovia.

The hosts will be looking to produce a positive response after they fell to a heavy 4-1 defeat in Friday's reverse fixture in San-Pedro.

After failing to reach the 2023 tournament, Sierra Leone will be desperate to secure a spot at the 2025 tournament in Morocco.

However, Sierra Leone have their work cut out to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations for the fourth time in their history, having taken just one point from their three qualifiers.

Amidu Karim's side began their qualifying campaign with a goalless draw against Chad, before they fell to a narrow 3-2 defeat in their away meeting with Zambia in the final match of the September international window.

They fell to another defeat in Friday's away meeting with Ivory Coast despite going into the break on level terms following Alhassan Koroma's equaliser.

Sierra Leone subsequently conceded three goals without reply in the second half as they fell to a disappointing 4-1 loss, leaving them bottom of the group with three points separating them from the top two.

Tuesday's hosts will be desperate to avenge that result with a victory in Tuesday's return fixture, but that may be easier said than done, having failed to win any of their last four home games in the Africa Cup of Nations (D3, L1).

Ivory Coast are looking to qualify for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations to defend the title that they won in their home tournament earlier this year.

Having taken maximum points from their three qualifiers, Ivory Coast are confident of securing qualification for a tournament that will take place from December 2025 to January 2026.

Emerse Fae's side kicked off their campaign with a 2-0 home win over Zambia, before they repeated that scoreline in their away meeting with Chad on September 10.

They then extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches with a commanding 4-1 win in Friday's home game against Sierra Leone thanks to a Franck Kessie brace and goals from Nicolas Pepe and Oumar Diakhite.

That result moved the group leaders onto nine points, ensuring that they will head into matchday four with a five-point gap over Zambia and a seven-point buffer to Chad.

Tuesday's visitors know that a win will guarantee them qualification with two games to spare, while a draw will be enough if Chad fail to take anything from their meeting with Zambia.

Crystal Palace youngster Hindolo Mustapha is pushing for a starting spot after coming off the bench in the first half to provide an assist in Friday's defeat.

Mustapha Bundu was introduced alongside Mustapha in the first period, and he will hope to earn a starting spot for Tuesday's fixture.

Amadou Bakayoko is set to retain his place in the forward line, with the striker looking to add to the three goals that he has scored for his country.

As for Ivory Coast, they are unable to call upon Manchester United attacker Amad Diallo and Leganes striker Sebastien Haller after the pair were forced to withdraw from Fae's initial squad.

Fae is set to name a backline of Wilfried Singo, Emmanuel Agbadou, Evan Ndicka and Christopher Operi for the fourth consecutive game.

In the final third, Diakite may be considered for a starting spot after he came off the bench to score an 87th-minute penalty in Friday's outing.


Sierra Leone possible starting lineup:
Kamara; Jalloh, Jarjue Kabia, Caulker, Samadia; Mustapha, Fornah, Alu. Koroma; Bundu, Alh. Koroma, Bakayoko

Ivory Coast possible starting lineup:
Fofana; Singo, Agbadou, Ndicka, Operi; Fofana, Seri, Kessie; Diakhate, Krasso, Pepe



We say: Sierra Leone 1-3 Ivory Coast

Ivory Coast will be full of confidence after recording a commanding win in Friday's reverse fixture, and while they may not have home advantage for Tuesday's contest, we think that they will have the extra quality required to clinch another comfortable victory.
