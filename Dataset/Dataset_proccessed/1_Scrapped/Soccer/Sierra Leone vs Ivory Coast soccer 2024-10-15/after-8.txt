The qualifiers for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) continue on Tuesday, October 15. However, several teams have already secured their place in the finals, which will take place in Morocco from December 21, 2025, to January 18, 2026.

In addition to Morocco, the host nation that has already qualified and leads its group, Burkina Faso was the first team to book its ticket to the finals. The Burkinabés defeated Burundi 2-0 last Sunday. With 10 points from four matches, they are guaranteed to top Group L. Similarly, Algeria secured their qualification after beating a vulnerable Togo side with a narrow 1-0 victory.

Other teams could clinch qualification by the end of matchday 4, which began on October 13 and concludes on Tuesday, October 15. The results so far show that Angola, Ivory Coast, Egypt, and DR Congo are well-positioned to secure their spots in the finals.

For instance, Cameroon earned a crucial 1-0 victory against Kenya in their fourth qualifying match, played at Nelson Mandela Stadium in Kampala on Monday. This win keeps the Indomitable Lions at the top of Group J with 10 points, just one point away from securing their place in Morocco. Meanwhile, the Harambee Stars face a significant challenge in the upcoming matches of this qualifying campaign.

Other teams, such as Senegal, South Africa, Uganda, Benin, and Mali, also have a chance to qualify in the next matchday. In Group L, Senegal could join Burkina Faso with a victory against Malawi, while Mali is just three points away from qualification and could secure it by beating Guinea-Bissau.

Nigeria faced a difficult situation upon landing in Libya, where the Mediterranean Knights kept the Super Eagles waiting for 12 hours at Al-Abraq Airport before transporting them to Benghazi on Monday, October 14. The Nigerians complained of being held without food or water in a deserted airport. Their captain, William Troost-Ekong, called the situation "shameful" and urged the Nigerian government to intervene. After winning the first leg 1-0 against Libya, the Nigerian team is considering refusing to play the return leg for "security reasons" and has requested intervention from CAF.

Libya's return to hosting AFCON matches after nearly a decade has started poorly with this incident. Another notable football upset came with Tunisia's home loss to Comoros (0-1), ending a 12-year unbeaten streak in home AFCON qualifiers for the Carthage Eagles. Despite this slip, Tunisia remains top of their group with 6 points, just ahead of Comoros (5 points). Comoros, after two draws, have reignited their hopes of qualification and could top the group if they beat Tunisia in the return leg on October 15 in Ivory Coast.

Elsewhere, Cape Verde's home loss to Botswana has opened up the race for second place behind Egypt, who lead the group with 9 points. Gabon also disappointed with a goalless draw against Lesotho, leaving them trailing behind Morocco in their group. The Atlas Lions have been unstoppable, netting goals in abundance.

The final stretch of matchday 4 promises to be crucial for struggling teams. Ghana, with just 2 points from 3 matches, must win against Sudan to avoid elimination. Meanwhile, Guinea bounced back with a 4-1 victory over Ethiopia and will be looking to solidify their position in Group H in the return leg.

These qualifiers involve 48 of the 54 countries on the continent, divided into 12 groups of 4 teams each. The top two teams from each group will qualify for AFCON. In Group A, the highest-ranked team after Morocco will also qualify.

The 5th and 6th matchdays will take place from November 13 to 19, 2024, and all 23 qualified nations are expected to be confirmed by November 19, on the final matchday.
