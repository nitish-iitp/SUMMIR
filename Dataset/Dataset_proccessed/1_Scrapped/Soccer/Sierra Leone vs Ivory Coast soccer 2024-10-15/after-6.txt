Sierra Leone secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory against the African Champions Ivory Coast in their round four Group G qualifiers at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Stadium on Tuesday afternoon.

Amadou Bakayoko, a striker based in Japan, scored a last-minute header to secure the win for the West African team, marking their first victory in the qualifiers and against Ivory Coast.

Sierra Leone aimed to bounce back from their previous two defeats and they demonstrated resilience to keep their qualification hopes alive.

The match remained level until the 85th minute when Sierra Leone won a free-kick, which was successfully converted by Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo striker, resulting in their first win in the qualifiers and moving them above Chad with four points from four matches.

Meanwhile, Zambia also claimed a 1-0 victory in their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium on Tuesday afternoon. The win placed them just two points behind Group G leaders Ivory Coast, who have a game in hand.

Zambia initially struggled in the match, with Chad having more shots on goal in the first 20 minutes.

However, Zambia found their rhythm by the half-hour mark and began to dominate possession. Kennedy Musonda scored the only goal in the 70th minute, and despite a late scare with a penalty awarded to Chad, Zambia held on to secure all three points in Cameroon.

As it stands in Group G,  Ivory Coast on nine points, Zambia on seven, Sierra Leone amassed four points and Chad on two points ahead of the final two matches.
