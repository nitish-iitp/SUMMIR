On the strength of an avalanche of scoring in the second quarter, the Bakersfield High football team overwhelmed host Highland, cruising to a 55-14 victory on Friday in the South Yosemite Valley League opener for both teams.

The Drillers (6-0) are off to their best start since 2011 when BHS won all 14 games and captured the Central Section Division-I championship.
