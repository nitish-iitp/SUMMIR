Cape Verde will be looking to keep up the pressure as they gear up to face Mozambique in their next Group B encounter at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium on Friday.




Date: 19 January 2024




Kick-off: 16h00 CAT




Head-to-head: At the AFCON, this will be Cape Verde and Mozambique’s first meeting.




Nonetheless, they have met four times in AFCON qualifying rounds, with Mozambique winning once (D1) and Cape Verde winning twice. In their most recent match, which took place at Estádio Nacional do Zimpeto in March 2021, Cape Verde prevailed 1-0 due to an own goal by Faisal Bangal.




Cape Verde last three results: Before heading to the Cup of Nations, Cape Verde won their World Cup qualifying match against Eswatini 2-0. They lost a friendly to Tunisia 2-0 before they arrived at the tournament and impressively beat Ghana 2-1.




Mozambique last three results: Mozambique won a friendly against Lesotho 2-0 and following that drew 1-1 against Botswana in another friendly match. Their last match saw them hold AFCON favourites Egypt to a 2-2 draw, causing an upset. 




Team news: The Blue Sharks could rely on the same group that avoided injuries on Sunday to start on Friday. After making an impact as a substitute against the Black Stars, Rodrigues might make a case for a starting position.




It is unclear if Mozambique’s Clesio’s hamstring injury from the match against Egypt might keep him from starting, but if he is fully recovered, the attacker is expected to feature.




Key player – Cape Verde: Garry Rodrigues – Having already scored a goal in the tournament, Rodrigues will be crucial in Cape Verde’s attack as the 33-year-old brings his experience into the side.




Key player – Mozambique: Clesio Bauque – Clesio will also be key as he scored against Egypt and will be looking to build on from that performance should he recover from his hamstring issue.
