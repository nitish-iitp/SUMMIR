Rogers Mato's early goal as enough to not only sink the Somalis but also hand Cranes head coach Paul Put his first win since taking charge less than a month back.

Uganda Cranes picked their maiden victory in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers after beating Somalia 1-0 at the Berkane Municipal Stadium, Morocco on Tuesday.

Uganda has thus managed to bounce back from Friday's heartbreak where they lost 2-1 to Guinea.

The Cranes made the start of their dreams after Rogers Mato buried debutant Allan Oyirwoth's shot, following a counter-attack led by Travis Mutyaba and Elvis Bwomono in the fourth minute.

Midway through the first half, Uganda nearly made it 2-0, but Oyirwoth struck inches wide from the edge of the box.

With Uganda probing more, Mutyaba almost handed Uganda a second in the 42nd minute, but he shot wide.

Two minutes later, Mato was denied by custodian Mustaf Yuusuf after being presented with a goalkeeper-to-beat opportunity.

At the stroke of half-time, Somalia's captain, Mohamed Abdi, was sent off for an early shower following a foul that attracted a second yellow card.

Ten minutes into the second half, Uganda should have been two to the good, but Fahad Bayo failed to guide Mutyaba's cutback in goal.

The Cranes were then on, hapless and often times lost concentration in the final third, despite the numerical advantage over their opponent..

Following the result, Uganda have stayed fifth in Group G with three points, level with Mozambique, Botswana and Guinea.
