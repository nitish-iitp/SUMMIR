Mato guides Uganda past 10-man Somalia
Kigozi Abdusalam  November 21, 2023 Less than a minute Coffee Trade Centre

• Somalia 0-1 Uganda

Coffee Trade Centre

Mato Rogers was the difference, as Uganda Cranes edged past resilient Somalia to record the first win in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers at Stade Du Municipal in Berkane, Morocco, on Tuesday.

In the fourth minute, Mato was well positioned to freely tap home a pass by debutant Allan Oyirwoth, who was played through by Elvis Bwomono in the buildup to the goal.

Somalia ended the game with a man down after a direct red card to Ahmed Mohammed as the first half approached the final bend.

This becomes the first win for Belgian coach Joseph Paul Put, who took over the helm from Milutin Sredojevic, and the first for the Cranes in this qualification window.

Uganda Cranes lost the first game 2-1 to Guinea last week at the same Stadium in Morocco.

The Cranes expect to return to action next year in March, hosting Group G opponents Mozambique and Algeria between 3rd and 11th at the Mandela National Stadium, Namboole.

Uganda ends the first window of the World Cup Qualifiers with three points from two games.

The Uganda Cranes will return to action in June next year with two home games against Botswana and Algeria.
