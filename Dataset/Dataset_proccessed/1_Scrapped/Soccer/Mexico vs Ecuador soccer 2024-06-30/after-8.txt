Mexico's struggles against South American teams continue

Mexico have now won just one of their past 11 games against CONMEBOL opponents at Copa America, suffering six losses alongside four draws dating back to 2011.

They have also failed to score in each of their past three such games.

Venezuela are flying

Before this tournament began, Venezuela had played 70 games all-time at Copa America, winning just eight of them.

In three games at Copa America 2024, they've brought that win total up to 11.

Ecuador becoming knockout-stage regulars

In stark contrast to Mexico's regression, Ecuador are experiencing one of the better periods in their team's history.

After failing to make it out of the group stage in six straight editions of Copa America from 1999 to 2015, Ecuador have now reached the quarterfinals in three of the past four editions.

Mexico's long-term regression

Mexico's declining results in Copa America over the years have mirrored the overall regression the team has suffered.

Between 1993 and 2007 Mexico appeared in the tournament seven times, reaching at least the semifinals five times and finishing as runners-up twice.

But in four appearances since then, Mexico have made it out of the group stage only once, and that run immediately ended in the quarterfinals with a 7-0 drubbing at the hands of Chile.

More on Mexico's lack of offense

Mexico took 57 shots across their three games at Copa America but still only managed to score once. That's almost hard to do.

Mexico's toothless attack

Getty Images

Mexico scored just one total goal across their three games at Copa America, and readers on our discussion page had differing opinions as to who is to blame for that.

Adrian B. said: Mexico needs a forward who can finish plays

Prompting Max Z. to respond: Missing more players that can give options to said forward

Adrian B. had more to say: Will the coach be fired if Mexico doesn’t make it past the group stage?

Venezuela and Ecuador move on, Mexico and Jamaica head home

Homophobic chant mars tonight’s Copa America match

Tonight’s game between Mexico and Ecuador was marred by repeated incidents of homophobic chanting.

There were three separate announcements over the stadium speakers at State Farm Stadium, Arizona late into the goalless draw.

A message was also displayed on big screens around the stadium calling for a halt.

The message said: “The referee has indicated that the match could be suspended due to discriminatory behavior among spectators. Discrimination in football stadiums is not tolerated. If this continues, the match will be suspended, and eventually canceled.”

The homophobic chant, in which fans shout a slur at the opposing goalkeeper during his run-up to take a goal kick, has been heard at Mexican football matches for many years, with differing stories as to its origins.

Mexico were unable to find a late goal with the draw costing them their place at the tournament.

A big, big win for Venezuela. They were head and shoulders above Jamaica, dominating possession and creating countless chances in the second half.

That's nine points from the group and you imagine confidence will be sky high.

Canada beware!

VAR reviewing Mexico's penalty

90+8' Mexico 0-0 Ecuador

Torres makes leg-on-leg contact with Martinez and the Mexico striker makes sure to hit the ground. Replays show the contact likely didn't warrant Martinez going over, and more importantly, they also show that Torres got the ball with his leg.

VAR has summoned the referee to the monitor...
