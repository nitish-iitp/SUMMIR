Mexico exit Copa America after disappointing group stage finale against Ecuador

This was a disastrous tournament from Mexico. It's time to be real, look in the mirror and admit this program has hit rock-bottom.

Jaime Lozano will likely be out of a job within days. He pushed out the veterans of El Tri, attempting to usher in a new era for the national team, but it was a major disappointment.

One cannot help but think that someone like Chucky Lozano would have been a beneficial asset here. A midfielder like Hector Herrera, even.

Mexico drew Ecuador 0-0 in a bland, uninspiring and uneventful showing in their third and final group stage match at Copa American Sunday night.

Acoss three matches, El Tri managed just one goal, and it came off a one-in-a-million strike from fullback Gerardo Arteaga on matchday one against Jamaica. Despite having a superstar striker like Santiago Gimenez, a dynamic winger in Julian Quinones and many other talented attackers, they couldn't get the job done.
For a team who is co-hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, this Copa America showing was an embarrassment. Nothing went right, they were outclassed in nearly every match, and they looked like they didn't belong.

In must-win territory, Mexico faltered. Now, they exit Copa America on a low, with their heads hanging.

GOAL rates Mexico's players from State Farm Stadium.

Goalkeeper & Defense

Julio Gonzalez (6/10):

Nobody expected him to be starting this tournament, but the opportunity came his way and he played well. Kept a clean sheet against a talented Ecuador attack.

Gerardo Arteaga (5/10):

Gave away the ball far too much when trying to push forward. Not a great showing form their matchday one hero.

Johan Vasquez (6/10):

Solid as usual, did what he was tasked with. His attack let him down.

Cesar Montes (6/10):

Strong and composed, he played his role and kept the Ecuador attack quiet.

Jorge Sanchez (5/10):

Failed to provide any sort of dynamic to the left flank of the pitch. Didn't connect well going forward, but was solid defensively.

Midfield

Luis Chavez (6/10):

Struggled against a physical Ecuadorian side. Was a solid partner with Romo, though.

Luis Romo (7/10):

A dynamic showing in the midfield, he was Mexico's best player on the night.

Orbelin Pineda (5/10):

Failed to link the attack with the midfield. Lacked creativity and urgency.

Attack

Julian Quinones (4/10):

Was supposed to be Mexico's x-factor on the wing, but he was a ghost nearly the entire match. A truly disappointing showing.

Santiago Gimenez (4/10):

A rough performance to end a rough tournament. There was never a system to benefit him, and it showed.

Cesar Huerta (4/10):

Didn't provide width or any attacking threat, really. Subbed off in second half.

Subs & Manager

Guillermo Martinez (6/10):

Came on to try and spark a goal to life, but failed. An unfortunate cameo.

Uriel Antuna (6/10):

Was benched for Huerta, but replaced him in second-half. Failed to spark any attacking momentum, though.

Erick Sanchez (N/A):

Came on as a late sub.

Alexis Vega (N/A):

Came on as a late sub.

Jaime Lozano (2/10):

Disaster from Lozano. Zero attacking momentum all tournament, and an uninspiring midfield display. He'll may well be out of a job due to this showing, and while that's unfortunate, Mexico were beyond subpar Sunday.
