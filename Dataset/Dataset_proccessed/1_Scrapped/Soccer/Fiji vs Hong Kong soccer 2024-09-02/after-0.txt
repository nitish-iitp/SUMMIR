Hong Kong conclusively ended their seven-match winless run with a 3-0 victory over a rotten Solomon Islands team in Fiji on Thursday.

On a pitch that was scarcely fit for international football, Juninho opened the scoring with his first goal for the city after 22 minutes.

Matt Orr and the excellent Wong Wai scored penalties either side of half-time following hare-brained challenges in the box, before Poon Pui-hin and Orr went close to extending Hong Kong’s lead.

Wolfgang Luisser, managing the team while new head coach Ashley Westwood watched from the sparsely populated stands, gave debuts from the bench to goalkeeper Ng Wai-him, 22, and the 18-year-old pair of Timothy Chow and Ng Yu-hei.

“I am proud of the team – it was not easy to play on this ground,” Luisser said. “We had to adapt our style and did well. It was pleasing to not concede goals, and nice that some young players got their debuts.”
