CONWAY — With good numbers out for the program and many players who have honed their skills over the past year, the Kennett High boys’ soccer team comes into the 2024 campaign with lofty goals including a return to postseason play.

The Eagles opened their season after nine days, the shortest in the program’s history, on the road in Amherst against Souhegan on Friday night. In an evenly played match, the host Sabers netted the game’s lone goal just before halftime.
