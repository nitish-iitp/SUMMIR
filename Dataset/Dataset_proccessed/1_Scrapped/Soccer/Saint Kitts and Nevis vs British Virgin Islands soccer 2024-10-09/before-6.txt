Cherry Hill school board members listen to the community relations plan presentation.

During a presentation at the Cherry Hill school board meeting on Tuesday on improving community relations, board members requested enhancements that they said would ensure more voices would be heard. 

The presentation came after a district communications audit released in June indicated that about one in 10 parents surveyed felt the district does a "below average" or "poor" job communicating with the public. Members of the public also have sometimes chastised the board at previous meetings for announcing decisions such as relocating the district’s alternative high school with little or no public feedback.

Carole Roskoph, the district's new supervisor of special projects who also serves as a member of Cherry Hill Township Council, said during her presentation that her "fluid" plan involves using videos, blogs, podcasts, listening sessions, town hall meetings and communications advisory panels to inform the community of district happenings.

Initiatives will involve district parents, teachers, staff, community members, businesses and higher education institutions, she said.

"One of the pieces that we kept coming back to was this idea of, 'Know your own, grow your own,'" Roskoph said. "We established this idea sort of as the overarching theme or guiding principle that would help us through whatever programs or efforts that we were going to be doing moving forward."

Board members who commented on Roskoph’s plan appeared to support her efforts.

However, board member Renee Cherfane also suggested that Roskoph "try to find the smaller voices, or maybe the ones that are a little bit more intimidated by settings like this, that would not necessarily speak up or give their perspective (since that is) a population of this community that we desperately need to target."

Board member Gina Winters added another suggestion: "All of us are volunteers on the board, but we are all also volunteers in lots of other places…we can all be part of helping you reach out to those aspects that you may not personally have a connection."

Board Vice President Joel Mayer said a new district website and an online district data dashboard, which he said "will be much easier to for people to access information quickly (and) to see exactly where to go" will be available for public use on January 1, 2025.

The communications audit found that the current district website is "difficult to navigate, (has) poor search capability, too many links to PDFs and content often out of date."

Business trip comes under fire

Several community members questioned the district covering the cost of sending Farrah Mahan, assistant superintendent of pre-k through 12th grade, to a Head Start conference in Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands from October 27 to November 1.

"Why are we going to those events…when our grades are in a free fall downward?" asked Rick Short, a community member. "Why is all our focus not put on high school? How could Head Start possibly help any of the other grades?"

Added Jeff Podowitz, another community member: "Only a small fraction of the students are involved with Head Start. …We have enough problems and issues in our school district."

Board Members Cherfane, Adam Greenbaum, Mayer, Quadsia Niaz, Miriam Stern, Sally Tong and Winters approved Mahan's trip. Board Members Kimberly Gallagher and Benjamin Rood were absent.

After the vote, Superintendent Kwame Morton defended Mahan's trip, stating that when the district preschool expansion is complete, more than 1,700 children aged 3 to 5 years in the Cherry Hill school district attend "the well-known and reputable" Head Start, which is more than some area district's total enrollment across all grades.

"It is important that we build a knowledge base for the individuals that are charged with building this program," Morton continued. "Dr. Mahan has got us off to a great start and is building a foundation where we can potentially grow."

Parents target class size

Morton also addressed individuals who requested a new district policy that would reduce class sizes in fourth and fifth grades from a cap of 26 students to 22.

Morton said there is not a lot of free space in district buildings and that the salaries, benefits and equipment needed to implement such a policy would cost about $1.9 million annually.

Board President Stern added the district has faced significant aid cuts from the state in recent years. She said that although the district's health insurance provider did not raise costs for the 2024-25 school year, "we definitely know that is not going to happen" for the 2025-26 school year, suggesting that other budget line items may need to take priority over suggested class-size reductions.

Other news:
Against protocol, Director of Elementary Education George Guy, the director of elementary education, and not school principals, assisted with the recent first-round interviews tied to a first-grade teaching vacancy at Cooper and a fourth-grade teaching vacancy at Bret Harte that he said occurred "quite suddenly."
The district received a grant that will allow the high schools to offer advanced placement (AP) courses to more students and could, in the future, spur the return of AP classes that were previously canceled due to low enrollment, according to Winters.
Supply chain issues may hinder meeting some timelines for completing some of the construction projects spurred by the district’s 2022 bond referendum, according to Greenbaum.
