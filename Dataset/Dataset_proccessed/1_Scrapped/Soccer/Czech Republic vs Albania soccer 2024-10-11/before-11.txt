Preview: Czech Republic vs. Albania - prediction, team news, lineups

Locked together on three points from two matches, Czech Republic and Albania meet in Prague on Friday night, as they resume their UEFA Nations League campaigns.

Both teams trail League B Group 1 leaders Georgia heading into this month's fixtures, following one win and one loss in September.

Becoming the latest victims of an enterprising Georgia side, Czech Republic were on the wrong end of a 4-1 scoreline in their opening Nations League fixture, after finding themselves four goals down inside 66 minutes.

Ivan Hasek's side had exited Euro 2024 in the group stage so were hoping to start their quest for promotion back to League A with a win, but they soon recovered from that setback by beating Ukraine in a five-goal thriller three days later.

Pavel Sulc scored twice during the first half to secure a 2-1 lead, before Tomas Soucek's late penalty seemed to make the points safe; however, the Ukrainians hit straight back and set up a tense finale.

From winning each of his first four games after taking the reins in January, Hasek has now overseen just that one win from the last five - though the Czechs' downturn has not been confined to his time in charge.

Relegated from the Nations League's top tier in 2023, they now occupy third place in their League B group, with only the winners earning automatic promotion and the runners-up being handed a playoff.

With Bundesliga stars Patrick Schick and Adam Hlozek being backed by several home-based attackers, at least scoring goals has not proved a problem: they are on a 12-match scoring sequence since being shut out by none other than Albania last November.

These nations last met in Euro 2024 qualifying, when Albania won 3-0 at home and drew 1-1 in Prague, with Nedim Bajrami netting the equaliser on their most recent visit to the Czech capital.

Like Friday's hosts, Sylvinho's side were beaten by Georgia last month but also defeated Ukraine, so they trail top spot in Group 1 by three points.

They share further common ground with the Czechs, having also gone out at the group stage of Euro 2024, where the Red and Blacks ultimately failed to break new ground by reaching the knockout phase in their second European Championship finals.

In September, Albania turned their attention to a second successive League B campaign in the Nations League, after previously finishing third with a mere two points on the board, only avoiding relegation due to the expulsion of Russia.

Ahead of their latest road trip - a visit to Georgia also awaits next week - the Balkan nation have won just two of 14 away matches since the end of 2021, so even avoiding defeat would represent something of a success.

Czech coach Ivan Hasek has offered star striker Patrik Schick a chance to recover from several minor injuries that have hampered his hopes of breaking into Bayer Leverkusen's starting XI, so Tomas Chory is favourite to start up front on Friday.

Defensive duo David Zima and Jaroslav Zeleny have both withdrawn due to injury, but centre-back Tomas Holes returns after missing last month's matches.

Jan Boril, Milan Havel, Robin Hranac and Ondrej Zmrzli were all late call-ups to the hosts' squad, while Albania have drafted in a Czech-based forward as cover.

Sparta Prague striker Indrit Tuci will be on familiar soil this week, as Armando Broja is still sidelined and Myrto Uzuni pulled out with a calf problem. However, Mirlind Daku - now back from suspension - is set to lead the line.

Defensive rock Berat Djimsiti, of Atalanta BC, is also unavailable, but another Serie A star, Inter Milan midfielder Kristjan Asllani, could recover from a muscular issue that has kept him out of full training.

In the absence of Djimsiti, the visitors' centre-back pairing should comprise Ardian Ismajli and Marash Kumbulla, with Mario Mitaj featuring on the left and Elseid Hysaj expected to start on the right.


Czech Republic possible starting lineup:
Kovar; Coufal, Krejci, Holes, Boril; Sulc, Soucek, Kalvach; Cerny, Chory, Hlozek

Albania possible starting lineup:
Strakosha; Hysaj, Kumbulla, Ismajli, Mitaj; Asllani, Ramadani; Asani, Bajrami, Seferi; Daku



We say: Czech Republic 2-1 Albania

Approaching the midpoint of this Nations League campaign, there is plenty at stake: winning Group 1 offers a potential route into the next World Cup.

As Albania do not tend to travel well, Czech Republic should continue their scoring streak on home turf, and victory will put them back in the hunt for top spot.
