Chory double leads Czechs to Nations League win over Albania
ByReuters
Updated: Oct 11, 2024, 09:00 pm

Tomás Chorý scored in each half to lead the Czechia to a 2-0 win over visitors Albania in the Nations League on Friday, as the home side dominated after taking the lead inside three minutes.

Slavia Prague striker Chory put the Czechs ahead when he latched onto a pass from Václav Cerný and gave the Albanian keeper no chance with a precise finish.

The Czechs continued to push forward while limiting chances for Albania and Chory doubled the lead in the 63rd minute when he found himself alone in the penalty area and headed home a cross from West Ham United defender Vladimír Coufal.

The win puts the Czechs level on six points with Georgia at the top of Group B1 with Ukraine and Albania both on three points. The Czechs face Ukraine on Monday while Georgia host Albania.
