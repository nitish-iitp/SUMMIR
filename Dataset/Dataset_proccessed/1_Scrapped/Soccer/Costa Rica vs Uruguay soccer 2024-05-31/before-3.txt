If you have been to our studio here in Boston, you have seen our massive library of sands, rocks, bones and all other earthy materials from around the globe.  Any material on this great planet can be crushed into an inlay in your wedding ring.  CALIFORNIA is a popular place to source earthy loveliness.

I'm not ashamed to say I have a real love affair going with sand right now.  Just like falling in love with a person, my love for sand and other unconventional ring materials keeps me up at night.  I lose my train of thought over it.  I daydream about it.  I wonder what it's doing right now and if it's thinking about me too.  Every time I get a new beach sand or earthy material from some spot on the globe, I get so excited to add it to our studio display of materials.  We have them organized by state or country so visitors can immediately search for the place they fell in love or where they were raised.  And don't forget!  If we do not have the beach sand or earthy material you are looking for, it is likely we can source it for you.  Even better than that, you can bring in (OR SHIP!) your own personal sand or rocks to be used in your rings.  We generally ask for about 1/2 cup of materials so that we can file them under your name.  With our Premium Lifetime Care, we promise to re-make your ring for free if you lose it.  If we have your sand on file, that makes that very easy to do.

CALIFORNIA is, as we all know, a tremendously beautiful state with massive amounts of gorgeous sands, rocks, to be used in your wedding rings.  One of my favorite CALIFORNIA Beach Sands is from Lake Tahoe.

Just look how beautiful other CALIFORNIA materials look when combined with CALIFORNIA beach sand.

VENICE BEACH AT SUNSET | Venice Beach Sand & Bronzey Pink Mokume - Unique Wedding Rings Rings

I am always searching the planet for unconventional ring materials.  We have so many beautiful sands to choose from in our unconventional ring materials Ring Room/Materials Library here at Minter & Richter Designs.

As with many of our sands, woods, and stones, I often find myself sitting on unconventional ring materials just waiting until some couple comes along wanting it in their rings.  That was the way with Beach Sand as well.  

Symbolically, Beach Sand as an inlay in your wedding ring is a no-brainer.  It is beautiful, timeless, and full of raw energy.  What could be more symbolic of passion than beach sand?  Any ring you see on our entire site could have one or more of its inlays replaced with beach sand from Arkansas or anywhere else on earth. How will you design yours?

FAQs

 

Q: How do I get sized?

 

A: WE STRONGLY SUGGEST PURCHASING MINTER & RICHTER CUSTOM SIZERS to guarantee you get the absolute perfect fit for your ring. The industry-wide standard for ring size carries many variables (different measuring tools, ring widths, ring materials, and design). Factory-made bands are sized LESS accurately than our handmade bands. Therefore, getting sized at a factory jewelry store does not guarantee that the size will be correct. We offer Sizing Exchanges for life for half price. But getting Custom Sizers ensures that you will not need a sizing exchange. A sizing exchange is 50% the cost of the original if you were not sized on our custom sizers.

 

Minter & Richter Custom Aluminum Sizers ($45 for a set of 3 sizers): If you have a general idea of what your ring size might be, we can make you a set of custom aluminum sizers (plain aluminum bands) in three different sizes at your preferred width. This allows you to spend time wearing each sizer for a day or two and finding out which one offers the most comfortable fit. Finger size can fluctuate slightly throughout the day due to water intake, temperature, etc. so this is an excellent way to get an accurate representation of exactly how your final ring will fit. We request that customers purchase their final ring(s) at the same time as the sizers. We will ship you the sizers along with a SASE for convenient return (domestic only – international must pay for return shipping). Once you confirm your ring size we begin making your rings with unconventional ring materials! 

(**Please note that sizers can add approximately 2 weeks to order processing.)
