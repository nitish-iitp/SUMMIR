TUPELO — What was a normal Thursday afternoon for most people in Lee County was also the day Jasmine Penro had been waiting for months. She officially got the keys to the home she helped build with her own two hands.

Northeast Mississippi Habitat for Humanity held a dedication ceremony for its first house of the year, Thursday afternoon. The house, located on Fifth Street in Verona, was built almost entirely through the help of volunteers and the sponsorship of Nettleton-based furniture company Homestretch.
