GOAL breaks down what the U.S. team will look like for this summer's tournament on home soil

The Copa America is heading back to the United States and, for the hosts, this summer's tournament will be a vital measuring stick as we reach the halfway point on the road to the 2026 World Cup.

The U.S. men's national team will be looking to build on the successes of the 2022 World Cup cycle, and on the road to 2026, this summer's Copa America will be their biggest test. For years, this group has been desperate to prove that they can hang with the world's elite; well, here's their chance. Teams like Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are up there with the best on the planet, and if the U.S. wants to be considered among them, an extended run in this tournament is the only way to prove it.

Back in 2016, the last time the tournament was hosted stateside, a U.S. team under Jurgen Klinsmann put forth a respectable showing, making it all the way to the semifinals before being trounced by Lionel Messi's Argentina, and eventually fell in a third-place game against Colombia, too.

Article continues below

A run to the semis will feel like the bare minimum for Gregg Berhalter and co. this summer. He has a talented young group at his disposal, perhaps more talented than any U.S. team we've ever seen. As such, Berhalter has needed to make some tough choices this summer in terms of his roster selection as he looks to guide the U.S. through a big moment in this group's history.

So who is on the USMNT Copa America squad? GOAL takes a look at the official 26-man roster.

GOALKEEPERS

Matt Turner remains the USMNT's No.1, and despite his lack of minutes at club level for Nottingham Forest, it doesn't feel like that'll change any time soon. There isn't quite anyone in position to challenge him at the moment, and his U.S. performances have never shown any sign of dropping off.

Behind him, Ethan Horvath remains the clear backup, with Johnson behind him.

Name	Club
Ethan Horvath	Cardiff City
Sean Johnson	Toronto FC
Matt Turner	Nottingham Forest

DEFENDERS

At right-back, Sergino Dest was set to be the go-to starter before his untimely injury. Joe Scally is his replacement, though Tim Weah and Shaq Moore provide alternative options. Antonee Robinson, meanwhile, is a lock at left-back, while Kristoffer Lund will provide backup.

Centrally, Tim Ream and Chris Richards seem are the starters, but all three of Cameron Carter-Vickers, Mark McKenzie and Miles Robinson will be competing for minutes.

Name	Club
Cameron Carter-Vickers	Celtic
Kristoffer Lund	Palermo
Mark McKenzie	Genk
Shaq Moore	Nashville SC
Tim Ream	Fulham
Chris Richards	Crystal Palace
Antonee Robinson	Fulham
Miles Robinson	FC Cincinnati
Joe Scally	Borussia Monchengladbach

MIDFIELDERS

The MMA midfield of Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams carried the USMNT through the 2022 World Cup, and that trio could very well return this summer. However, Gio Reyna still has his role to play, and it will likely move Musah to the bench.

Behind Adams, the U.S. has a new backup No.6 in Johnny Cardoso, while Luca de la Torre is the player to come in if McKennie or Musah are absent.

Malik Tillman, meanwhile, will still have his say after an outstanding season with PSV.

Name	Club
Tyler Adams	Bournemouth
Johnny Cardoso	Real Betis
Luca de la Torre	Celta Vigo
Weston McKennie	Juventus
Yunus Musah	AC Milan
Gio Reyna	Nottingham Forest

FORWARDS

Haji Wright, Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi and Josh Sargent will all be vying for a starting role at striker, but it's more likely now that we see Wright played in a wide role.

With Sargent carrying a knock, it's more than likely one of Pepi or Balogun get the nod for game one vs Bolivia, now, too.

Out wide, the options essentially pick themselves. Christian Pulisic will start on the left, while Weah will be on the right, with Wright available off the bench alongside Brenden Aaronson.

Name	Club
Folarin Balogun	Monaco
Ricardo Pepi	PSV
Christian Pulisic	AC Milan
Josh Sargent	Norwich City
Tim Weah	Juventus
Haji Wright	Coventry City
Brenden Aaronson	Leeds United

EXPECTED XI

Much of the USMNT XI is pretty locked in, and the two-pre Copa friendlies vs Brazil and Colombia largely spoke for themselves.

That said, we'll almost certainly see a 4-3-3. with the following group rolled out to begin the tournament.

USMNT XI (4-3-3): Turner; Scally, Richards, Ream, A.Robinson; Adams, McKennie, Reyna; Weah, Balogun, Pulisic.

NOTABLE ABSENTEES

Sergino Dest is the major one, with his absence robbing the U.S. of the team's starting right-back. Losing Dest is a brutal blow, one which will dramatically alter what this team can do tactically.

Daryl Dike, meanwhile, is also out for the rest of 2024 after suffering his second Achilles injury in as many years.

Name	Club	Reason
Drake Callender	Inter Miami	Not selected
Sergino Dest	PSV	Injury
Daryl Dike	West Brom	Injury
Auston Trusty	Sheffield United	Not selected
