Two teams competing at this summer's Copa America will lock horns in a friendly on Saturday evening, with Colombia taking on Bolivia in Connecticut.

Colombia will enter the contest off the back of an impressive 5-1 victory over the United States, while Bolivia suffered a 3-1 defeat to Ecuador in their last fixture, with both sides now concluding their preparations for the Copa America, which officially starts on June 20.

Colombia will enter Saturday's friendly off the back of a 5-1 success over the United States, which made it seven straight victories for La Tricolor in all competitions.

Nestor Lorenzo's side have not lost a single match for over two years, and they will certainly be expecting to be among the challengers for the Copa America title this summer.

Colombia will begin their campaign against Paraguay on June 24, before also tackling Costa Rica and Brazil in the group stage of the competition.

La Tricolor have finished third in two of their last three participations in the tournament, while they were champions back in 2001; a challenge this summer cannot be ruled out, but Argentina and Brazil will naturally be the favourites to lift the trophy next month.

Colombia are actually unbeaten against Bolivia since September 2003, and they recorded a 3-0 victory when the two teams last locked horns in March 2022.

Bolivia have won just one of their last 16 matches against Colombia, but the result is not too important in this contest, with head coach Antonio Carlos Zago instead focusing on his team's Copa America opener.

La Verde will begin their campaign against the United States on June 23, before also facing Uruguay and Panama in the group stage of the competition.

Bolivia were Copa America champions back in 1963, while they were also runners-up in 1997, but the national side have been eliminated in the group stage of the last three tournaments.

Just once have La Verde been past the first round in their last nine participations, which is an indication of the size of their task when it comes to advancing to the knockout stage.

Bolivia have lost four of their last five matches, meanwhile, including defeats in their last two friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador, but they did beat Andorra in a friendly at the end of March.

Three of Colombia's goals against the United States came from second-half substitutes, with Jorge Carrascal, Luis Sinisterra and Richard Rios on the scoresheet.

All three could start on the bench once again here, though, with the likes of Luis Diaz, Jhon Arias and James Rodriguez featuring in the attacking positions.

Rafael Santos Borre led the line against the United States last time out, and the 28-year-old is again set to operate in the final third of the field, while Jefferson Lerma should continue in central midfield.

As for Bolivia, head coach Zago could potentially name the same side that started against Ecuador last time out before making six changes in the second period.

Carmelo Algaranaz has scored twice for his national side and is again expected to feature in the final third of the field, while Pablo Vaca could again feature in midfield.

Roberto Fernandez is another likely starter for Bolivia, while Miguel Terceros, who scored his first international goal against Ecuador, should also be involved at some stage of the contest.


Colombia possible starting lineup:
Vargas; Munoz, D Sanchez, Lucumi, Mojica; Uribe, Lerma; Arias, J Rodriguez, Diaz; Borre

Bolivia possible starting lineup:
Viscarra; Medina, Jusino, Sagredo, Suarez; Cuellar, Villamil, Cespedes, Vaca, Fernandez; Algaranaz



We say: Colombia 2-0 Bolivia

Colombia are on a roll at the moment, and we are finding it difficult to back Bolivia to pick up a positive result. La Tricolor have so much quality in their squad, and there is no question that they have the potential to emerge victorious at the Copa America this summer.
