WHY IS AUSTRALIA PLAYING?

Australia has been participating in the 2024 Asian Cup as a member of the Asian Football Confederation since June 2005. This decision was made due to the lack of clear direction in the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) for the Socceroos, as well as the absence of a full World Cup quota allocated to the OFC.
Australia's official debut as a member of the Asian Confederation came in February 2006, when they participated in the qualifiers for the 2007 Asian Cup. Since then, Australia has been an integral part of Asian soccer, participating in competitions and contributing to the development of the sport in the region.

THE CHAMPIONS

Japan holds the record as the most successful team with 4 titles (1992, 2000, 2004 and 2011) in the Asian Cup. They are followed by Saudi Arabia (1984, 1988 and 1996) and Iran (1968, 1972 and 1976) with 3 titles each. South Korea has achieved glory on 2 occasions (1956 and 1960). Meanwhile, Israel (1964), Kuwait (1980), Iraq (2007), Australia (2015) and Qatar (2019) have one title each in their competition history.

THE NO. 1 CONTENDER

Japan is positioned as the top favorite. Since their elimination in the round of 16 at the World Cup against Croatia on penalties, they have suffered only one defeat and have accumulated eight consecutive victories, including a resounding 4-1 win over Germany. Beyond their excellent results, the team has shown remarkable play and impressive offensive power, scoring a total of 40 goals in 10 games during 2023.

To beat the Titan

On the other hand, Thailand also arrives at the Asian Cup of Nations with the illusion of making a great performance and looking to fight to reach the knockout stages where they can fight to win the Cup. As in the previous and upcoming match, Thailand arrives as the victim on paper of the match as they do not usually have great performances in the history of these tournaments, however, this match can serve as a test for the next stage of the tournament as getting the three points would put them into the knockout stages with enormous confidence to be able to aspire to be the new champions of the Asian Cup.

In search of victory

The Saudi Arabian national team comes to this game with the obligation to impose conditions to stay at the top of the group against an opponent that threatens to take it to qualify for the final stages as group leader, however, in the statistics, the Saudi Arabian team arrives as the favorite to win the three points and celebrate a three-point victory in the group stage. It is also important to mention that Saudi Arabia arrives at this Asian Cup as one of the favorite teams to win the championship, since what they did in Qatar 2022 ended up sowing the necessary confidence in the Arab team, which threatens to become one of the most powerful teams in the future in the Asian continent.

The Asian Cup of Nations is here

The new edition of the Asian Nations Cup is back with the best actions, emotions, controversies, plays, goals, players and matches of one of the biggest continents in the world where soccer has grown by leaps and bounds. Little by little, the continent's nations began to export several players to the world's top leagues and the project bore fruit as they gathered their best players to represent the colors of their flag with dignity on the pitch in the search for eternal glory in Asia. In this group stage match between Vietnam and Indonesia, both teams will be able to test the level they will face in the next match and the level they will have to be at in order to face a great challenge such as this tournament. Also, after a long time away from national competitions, these 90 minutes will be useful for the players to polish and fine-tune minimum details, improving their collective and individual game.
