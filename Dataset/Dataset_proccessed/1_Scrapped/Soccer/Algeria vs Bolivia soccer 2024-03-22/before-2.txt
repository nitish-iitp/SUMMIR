Preview: Algeria vs. Bolivia - prediction, team news, lineups

Algeria will begin their road to redemption this week when they take on Bolivia in an international friendly at the Nelson Mandela Stadium in Algiers on Friday evening.

Both these sides will be looking forward to getting some much-needed game time under their belts ahead of their respective World Cup qualifiers later this year.

Algeria will be returning to the spotlight for the first time since their dismal Africa Cup of Nations campaign at the start of the year, where they failed to make it out of a favourable group that featured Angola, Burkina Faso and Mauritania.

To add insult to injury, the Desert Foxes lost their final match of the group stages to Mauritania, which saw them end with just two points and led to them missing out on the four best third-placed qualification spots that were up for grabs.

Following their exit from the continental competition - their second in succession - the team dropped as many as 13 places in the FIFA world rankings, which contributed heavily to the Algerian Football Federation opting to part ways with now-former head coach Djamel Belmadi.

Bosnian tactician Vladimir Petkovic, who is best known for his work with the Swiss national team and Lazio, was the man selected to replace Belmadi, and the 60-year-old will be hoping to make a positive impression on debut in this match.

Prior to their AFCON disaster, Algeria were in good form, with six wins in their seven preceding matches and while that defeat against Mauritania proved to be a costly one, it is the only loss they have conceded in their last 15 games in all competitions.

Meanwhile, Bolivia's last match ended in a 3-0 defeat to Uruguay in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers back in November, which left them in ninth place in the standings and four points behind Brazil, who currently sit in the final automatic qualification spot.

However, before returning to World Cup qualification later in the year, Bolivia will face a huge task in just three months from now when they head to the US to compete in the 2024 Copa America.

La Verde have only advanced beyond the group stage of that competition three times in the last four decades and will need all the preparation they can get, having been drawn into a very difficult group that features the host nation, Uruguay and Panama.

Bolivia have dropped a spot in the world rankings, now down to 86th overall, and their record of 14 defeats in their last 17 games suggests they are likely to find it tough to get a result in this one.

Petkovic has already raised a few eyebrows with his first squad selection for the upcoming friendlies by leaving out several veterans and bringing in five relatively new faces.

Among the regulars who will not feature this week are Sofiane Feghouli, Rais M'Bolhi, Youcef Belaili and the team's all-time top scorer Islam Slimani. In addition, Riyad Mahrez will also miss the friendlies though he requested to be left out.

Coming into the squad in place of the aforementioned are Mohamed Amine Madani, Anis Hadj Moussa, Rafik Guitane, Ahmed Kendouci and Monsef Bakrar.

For Bolivia, Jose Sagredo and Luis Haquin are the most likely to make up the centre-back partnership with Roberto Fernandez and Jairo Quinteros at full-back.

With the retirement of Marcelo Moreno, the starting centre-forward position in the squad is likely to go to Bolivar's Carmelo Algaranaz, who will look to Club Always Ready's Pablo Vaca to provide the creativity from midfield.


Algeria possible starting lineup:
Mandrea; Atal, Tougai, Bensebaini, Mandi; Bennacer, Aouar, Boudaoui; Bounedjah, Brahimi, Amoura

Bolivia possible starting lineup:
Viscarra; Sagredo, Quinteros, Fernandez, Haquin; Ramallo, Vaca, Villarroel, Arrascaita, Villamil; Algaranaz



We say: Algeria 2-1 Bolivia

While Algeria have not been at their best this year, they still possess a roster packed with talent and will be looking to welcome their new manager to the side with a good performance. Bolivia will not make this easy, but we fancy the hosts to edge the result.
