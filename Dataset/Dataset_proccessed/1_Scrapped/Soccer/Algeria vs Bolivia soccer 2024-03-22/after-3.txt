Julien Duranville celebrated an important victory with Belgium's U21s on Thursday evening. The young Red Devils ran out 3-1 winners against Malta's U21s. Ian Maatsen and the Netherlands, on the other hand, lost 2-1 to Norway's U21s. Eight more Borussia players will be in action for their national teams this weekend.

Julien Duranville came on as a substitute in the 63rd minute of Belgium's match against Malta at the Den Dreef Stadium in Leuven. BVB's Belgian youngster may have missed a good chance to score in the 79th minute, but he delivered an impressive performance and helped his team on their way to three important points in EURO qualification. With 13 points from six games, Belgium are currently in third place in Group B, level on points with second-placed Scotland.
