ZEBRAS SHOCK GUINEA IN QUALIFIER

 21 Nov 2023

A 79th minute strike by Kabelo Seakanyeng sent Zebras supporters into jubilation and shocked Guinea as the goal handed the Zebras their first victory of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers campaign.

The solitary goal by Seakanyeng helped the Zebras defeat Syli Nationale at the game played at the Obed Itani Chilume Stadium in Francistown on Tuesday afternoon.

Zebras has never won against Guinea head to head, and the visitors, who pride themselves with having their entire squad plying their trade in Europe, found the going getting tough as Zebras head coach, Didier Gomes Da Rosa seemed to have planned for them very well.

The coach made five changes to his starting 11 from the Mozambique game a week ago, and introduced Goitseone Phoko, Kabelo Seakanyeng, Tebogo Kopelang, Molaodi Tlhalefang and Mogakolodi Ngele, who started on the bench against Mozambique.

During the opening minutes of the game, Guinea had first two goal attempts by Morgan Guilavogui and Serhou Guirassy.

The Zebras also made own attempts but Gape Mohutsiwa missed a golden scoring opportunity to tap in the ball after receiving a cross from Seakanyeng.

Guinea continued to pile pressure and in the 11th minute of the game, Phoko was forced to make a save in the box from a free header by Aguibou Camara.

In the 24th minute, Zebras supporters nearly celebrated the first goal of the day, but Tlhalefang’s shot from outside the 18 yard area went wide, irking his fellow strikers Tumisang Orebonye and Seakanyeng who were better positioned to attempt a goal.

Zebras continued to pose a threat to their opponents and in the 28th minute, Ngele missed a golden opportunity to convert with only the goalkeeper to beat.

The game went into a recess with the score line reading 0-0 but credit should go to the Zebras players in the first half as they were sharp and alert, more especially the backline marshalled by captain Thatayaone ‘TT’ Ditlhokwe.

After half time, both sides launched attacks but in the 58th minute, Guirassy’s free header from a throw hit the crossbar, and Ditlhokwe, who was closing him down landed awkwardly on his shoulder, forcing his substitution and replaced with Thato Kebue.

In the dying minutes of the game, Orebonye could have increased the score line but lack of composer was his main undoing.ENDS
