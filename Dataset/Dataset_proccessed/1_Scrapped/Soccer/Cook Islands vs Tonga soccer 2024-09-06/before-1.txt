Cook Islands national men’s football team is in Apia, Samoa, for the FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifiers from September 6-9, 2024.

The national side will face a critical knockout match against Tonga in a contest that could pave the way for their first-ever World Cup appearance.

For the Cook Islands, currently ranked 186th in the FIFA Men’s World Rankings, the 2026 World Cup represents a rare and historic opportunity. With Oceania guaranteed a spot in the tournament for the first time, the door is open for smaller nations like the Cook Islands to compete on football’s biggest stage. Victory in this preliminary round would be a major step towards achieving what was once considered an unattainable dream.

Head coach Tuka Tisam and his team have been working tirelessly in preparation for this decisive moment.

“Our focus is on ensuring every player is ready to give their best for the Cook Islands,” said Tisam. “The knockout format means there’s no room for error, so our preparations have centred around building a team that’s physically and mentally equipped for what’s to come.”

The squad features a blend of seasoned veterans and promising young talent, with Tisam noting that selecting the final lineup is always a tough decision.

“We’ve got a great mix of experience and youthful energy. Our decisions are based on who can best execute our game plan and how well they work together as a unit,” he explained.

Tonga, the Cook Islands’ first opponent, presents a formidable challenge, but Tisam believes his team is ready.

“Tonga is a tough side, but we’re confident in our strategy. Our plan is to play to our strengths and take our chances when they come.”

In the lead-up to the qualifiers, the team was scheduled to participate in warm-up matches in Auckland, New Zealand. These games were seen as crucial in fine-tuning tactics and sharpening match fitness.

“The Auckland games are an important part of our final preparations,” said Tisam, before leaving for Auckland. “They’ll give us the opportunity to build the match sharpness we need while solidifying our playing style.”

The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the players are fully aware of the significance of this campaign.

“The team is motivated and determined,” said Tisam. “There’s a strong sense of pride in representing the Cook Islands, and we’re approaching each match with the belief that anything is possible if we stay focused and work together.”

CIFA president, Grover Harmon, who is also a key player in the team, emphasised the importance of this campaign.

“This is a defining moment for football in the Cook Islands. The chance to compete for a World Cup spot is something we’ve been striving toward for years. As both a player and the president, I’ve seen the dedication within the team, and I believe we have the potential to achieve something special. The support from our community and the drive within this squad give us the confidence to aim high.”
