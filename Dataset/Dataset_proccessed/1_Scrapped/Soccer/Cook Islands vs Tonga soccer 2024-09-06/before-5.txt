The 26-year-old's impressive season, including 17 goals and 11 assists for Atalanta earns him a spot among the world's best footballers.

In a groundbreaking achievement, Nigerian winger, Ademola Lookman has been shortlisted for the coveted 2024 men's Ballon d'Or prize. The 26-year-old's impressive performances for Atalanta and the Super Eagles have earned him a spot among the world's top footballers.

The 26-year-old's remarkable season with Atalanta, where he scored 17 goals and provided 11 assists, caught the attention of France Football Magazine, the organizers of the Ballon d'Or award.
