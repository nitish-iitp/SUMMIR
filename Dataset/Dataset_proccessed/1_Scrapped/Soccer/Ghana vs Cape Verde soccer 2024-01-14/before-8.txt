Cape Verde have steadily become a consistent presence at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), following initial difficulties in qualifying for the tournament.

The Blue Sharks made their debut in 2013, leaving a lasting impression by advancing from Group A alongside hosts South Africa. They secured their spot in the knockout stage by defeating Angola in the third group game, but their journey came to an end in the quarter-final against Ghana, with Mubarak Wakaso’s brace sealing their fate.

In 2015, their return to Equatorial Guinea proved more challenging as they finished third in a tough group, trailing behind Tunisia and DR Congo. The 2017 and 2019 editions saw Cape Verde absent from the competition, but they made a comeback in 2021, held in Cameroon.

After navigating through a group that included the hosts, Burkina Faso, and Ethiopia, they advanced to the round of 16 as one of the best third-placed teams.

Their journey was once again halted by a formidable opponent, Senegal, who eventually went on to win the tournament. As they approach the 2023 AFCON, Cape Verde face the formidable challenges of Egypt and Ghana, along with the unpredictable Mozambique, making their path to success uncertain but hopeful.

The 33-year-old, renowned for his goal-scoring prowess across multiple clubs in Europe and Asia, aims to enhance his goal tally for the national team.

Vozinha (Josimar Dias):

Goalkeeper Josimar Dias, known as Vozinha and the eldest among the squad, is poised to leverage his experience to aid Cape Verde’s ambitions in the tournament.
