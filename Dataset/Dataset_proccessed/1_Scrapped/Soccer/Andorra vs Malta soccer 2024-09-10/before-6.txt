Andorra get their UEFA Nations League campaign underway on Tuesday when they host Malta in a League D encounter.

Malta played their first match of the current edition on Saturday night, falling to defeat away in Moldova.

In a three-team section, Andorra had no opponents on matchday one, so their UNL campaign begins here on home soil, looking to end a two-year winless run.

Not since a win over Liechtenstein in this competition back in 2022 have Andorra tasted success, losing 14 of the 18 games since.

The most recent of those defeats came last Wednesday, losing 1-0 to League D's other inactive team on matchday one, Gibraltar.

After taking just two points from their eight Euro 2024 qualifiers, Andorra will hope for more success in a competition that provided some promising results last time out.

The Tricolors remained unbeaten at home across the last campaign, beating Liechtenstein here, and drawing with Moldova and Latvia, as Koldo Alvarez's side ended on eight points - their best-ever tally.

Andorra are yet to make their way out of the bottom tier though in the three previous iterations of the Nations League, but this could be their best chance yet.

Moldova will provide a stern test, but starting at home to Malta, the section's lowest-ranked outfit, gives them the opportunity to make a bright start.

The two nations met in the 2020 Nations League, and it was Malta who came out on top, winning 3-1 in Ta'Qali after a 0-0 draw here in Andorra la Vella.

Malta have faltered since then though, losing all eight Euro 2024 qualifiers, and scoring just four goals in their last nine outings.

Their last competitive wins also came in the previous Nations League campaign, home and away against San Marino, and this is likely going to be their best chance to end that run.

That is after Michele Marcolini's side were comfortably beaten in Chisinau by group-favourites Moldova on Saturday, going down two goals to nil, creating a meagre 0.15 xG across the 90 minutes.

Keeping tight at the back is going to be their only route to success, given their troubles in attack, but Malta have proven tough to break down for other sides in League D.

They may have lost on the road at the weekend, but in their previous five UNL matches, Malta have kept three clean sheets, including one on their trip here in 2020.

The man to watch in the Andorra team will be attacker Berto Rosas, who plays in the Spanish third tier for the club of the same name, and has four goals already in just 16 caps.

Captain Marc Pujol continues to lead his nation in midfield, as the 42-year-old made his 118th cap against Gibraltar, but he is still 19 short of matching the Andorra record set by Ildefons Lima.

Villarreal B goalkeeper Iker Alvarez plays at the highest level of any player in the squad, and may be in for a quieter evening than he is accustomed to in the Andorran net here.

Malta are without one of their standout individuals, as Notts County's Jodi Jones refused a call up yet again this week, after also opting to turn down his nation during the summer.

Reims' Teddy Teuma was only fit enough to start from the bench in Saturday's defeat, having only just returned from injury, but the midfielder could be included from the start this time around and will be a great addition to the side.

Defender Zach Muscat also got his first minutes since the last international break, as he is yet to find a club since leaving Farense over the summer.


Andorra possible starting lineup:
Iker Alvarez; Joan Cervos, De Olivera, Llovera, Borra Font, Guillen; Adri Gomes, Marc Vales, Marc Pujol; Berto Rosas, Ricard Fernandez

Malta possible starting lineup:
Bonello; Muscat, Shaw, J. Borg; J. Mbong, Guillaumier, Yankam, Camenzuli; Teuma, Montebello, P .Mbong


We say: Andorra 0-0 Malta

On paper, this is Andorra's best chance of claiming a victory in the section, but they are not in the best of shape after a defeat to Gibraltar last week and 18 matches without a win.

Likewise, Malta suffered a disappointing loss in Moldova at the weekend, creating next to nothing in attack, as these two sides could cancel each other out in a low-quality encounter.
