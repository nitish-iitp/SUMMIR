Euro 2024 Fantasy team previews: Hungary
ROCKY7
61 CommentsSHARE

Hungary are the latest nation we’re profiling in our Euro 2024 Fantasy team previews.

In these country-by-country guides, we’ll be looking at the best players from each nation, taking a stab at predicted line-ups, reviewing the road to Germany and more.

To do this, we’ll be calling on the help of correspondents from each country.

Here, Fantasy Football Scout user deyell answers questions about his homeland.

All prices given are from the official Fantasy Euro 2024 game.

THE ROAD TO QUALIFICATION
Pos	Team	P	W	D	L	GF	GA	Diff	Pts
1	Hungary	8	5	3	0	16	7	+9	18
2	Serbia	8	4	2	2	15	9	+6	14
3	Montenegro	8	3	2	3	9	11	-2	11
4	Lithuania	8	1	3	4	8	14	-6	6
5	Bulgaria	8	0	4	4	7	14	-7	4

After failing to qualify for a major international tournament for 44 years, Hungary have now reached their third in a row.

And they did so with plenty to spare this time around, going unbeaten in a qualifying group that included Serbia and Montenegro to finish top after five wins and three draws.

Marco Rossi’s side were particularly strong at home, where they recorded four wins out of four, the pick of them a 3-1 comeback win over Montenegro in which Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai (€7.0m) scored two goals in three second-half minutes.

Though their qualifying section was not exactly the group of death this is possibly the best national side Hungary have produced since the 1960s – and they will fancy their chances of getting past Germany, Switzerland and Scotland.

QUALIFICATION IN NUMBERS
Most starts: Denes Dibusz, Adam Nagy, Attila Szalai, Dominik Szoboszlai (8), Adam Lang, Milos Kerkez (7)
Most goals: Dominik Szoboszlai, Barnabas Varga (4)
Most assists: Dominik Szoboszlai (5), Loic Nego, Roland Sallai (2)
Clean sheets: 3 from 8

RECORD SINCE QUALIFYING
Date	Competition	Opposition	Result	Score	Goalscorers	Assists
22 March	Friendly	Turkey (h)	W	1-0	Szoboszlai (pen)	
26 March	Friendly	Kosovo (h)	W	2-0	Szoboszlai, Zs Nagy	Schafer, Lang
4 June	Friendly	Republic of Ireland (a)	L	1-2	Lang	Orban
8 June	Friendly	Israel (h)	W	3-0	
Sallai, Varga x2
	Varga, Bolla, Sallai

Hungary kept their unbeaten record going with friendly victories over Turkey and Kosovo in March. Szoboszlai scored from the spot in the 1-0 home win over Turkey and was on target again at the Puskas Arena four days later in a 2-0 win in which Adam Nagy (€5.5m) also scored.

The Magyars had been unbeaten since September 2022, when they suffered a 2-0 Nations League defeat to Italy in Budapest. Indeed it is worth remembering that in that Nations League campaign in June 2022 Hungary beat England twice including a 4-0 thrashing at Molineux.

However, that 14-match run came to an end last week thanks to a last-minute Ireland winner in Dublin. The hosts had only two shots on target all game, with their winner being their only effort of the second half, so there was an element of bad luck for the Magyars.

Budget defender Adam Lang (€4.0m) was on target for Hungary at the Aviva Stadium. Don’t get too excited: that was his first international goal since 2016.

That loss to Ireland was quickly forgotten about four days later, with an early three-goal blitz seeing off Israel in Debrecen. Forward Barnabas Varga (€6.0m) was involved in all three goals, assisting once and scoring a brace.

An injury scare surrounding Szoboszlai in that match has been downplayed.

GROUP FIXTURES

15 June: Switzerland
19 June: Germany
23 June: Scotland
HOW FAR WILL THEY GET?

“Round of 16. Although all of our group opponents have a stronger squad on paper, the Hungarian national team has a tendency to show up big for the Euros. I think we will edge out Scotland and qualify for the next round as one of the four best third-placed teams.” – deyell

STRENGTHS

“Hungary’s biggest strength is grit and playing above our level. Our players take tournaments like this very seriously and play their hearts out. The backline, anchored by RB Leipzig centre-back Willie Orbán, is disciplined, which allows the talented Szoboszlai to show off his playmaking abilities.

“Freiburg winger Roland Sallai is also a standout for the national team with his dribbling abilities and high work rate. Barnabás Varga, the striker from Ferencváros, has scored six goals in 11 matches for Hungary, two of which came against Serbia in qualifying.” – deyell

WEAKNESSES

“Defensive midfield and depth in general.

“The defensive midfield, where we play a double pivot, lacks talent. Ádám Nagy plays in Serie B, while Callum Styles plays for Sunderland in the Championship. Although these two players usually perform better for the national team than for their clubs, they can be exposed by good teams.

“If we have to rely on substitutes, that can also be a problem due to the lack of quality depth.” – deyell

I’ve been to Hungary, mine friend and I bathed in the Gellert baths. They made us wear shower caps! Mine friend, bald as a badger, took his off and the life-guard blew his whistle loudly and repeatedly gesticulating that he put it back on! T’was a very embarrassing episode.

They are when barbers steal their backside hair to make shaving brushes! The original saying is bald as a badger’s backside, but I didn’t want mine post modded by using the risqué term ‘backside’!

I also went to bathe at Egerzalok after too much bikavar (Bull’s Blood). I thought it a fine idea to bathe fully armoured, including with mine passport! It went very wrinkly after being dried but somehow still worked!

Might be a stupid question but I can't find the answer explicitly stated in the rules...
Captaincy... can you change your captain more than once within a Matchday as long as they play on a different weekday or is it one twist and you get what you get ?

Once a day during Matchday so matchday 1 you could potentially have had 5 captains but you only get double points on your final choice and can not pick a player who has already played

as far as i can tell you can make any changes to your team after all matches on a day have finished, before the earliest KO the next day. so the former, you can have 5 different captains in matchday 1.

Scamacca vs mitro vs Dovbyk is tough. scamacca best team, serbia with very attacking philosophy and dovbyk most in form striker. iirc dovbyk goal scoring record for Ukraine isnt very good though

Nowhere near what he hit for Girona this season, but he does have Tsyhankov to link up with, and Sudakov now bringing some extra creativity so I think Ukraine attack could be on the uptick. I wouldn't go near Scamacca personally; think might you be overrating Italy attack a bit

Considered it, had him in for a while, but now that I've had a look at Romania they seem pretty solid & now I think that game looks like a 1-0.

We usually get a few days of "price reveals" first, so that's what to look out for. I suspect it will be before the Euros finish.

Saka nailed for MD1? seems a little bit of doubt if hes only playing 25 mins 1 week out. Even if he starts he will likely be subbed off.

Not sure, but I've taken everyone out but Kane now. They haven't been convincing and I think there are a lot of other options for a cheaper price which allows for expanding in other areas.

I like the attacking defence, but feel your midfield is underpowered. I think Lukaku is enough for Belgium and that extra cash saved on KDB can be spread to improve cheaper mids slightly.
