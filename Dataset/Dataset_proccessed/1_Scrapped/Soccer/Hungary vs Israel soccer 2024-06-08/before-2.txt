About Singapore Events
Singapore Sports Events

As a sovereign island city-state, all of the country’s national teams are based in Singapore. These include the national cricket, softball, basketball, and men's and women's football teams who play their home games at the National Stadium. The Tampines Rovers F.C., who play their home games in the Tampines Sports Hall, are a Singapore Premier League team along with Young Lions F.C., who play their home games at Jalan Besar Sports Centre. Singapore’s professional basketball team, the Singapore Slingers compete in the ASEAN Basketball League and play their home games at the Singapore indoor Stadium.

Singapore Ticket Prices

Adult ticket prices including fees for events in Singapore start from as low as SGD $S20 for basic tickets to SGD $S25,869 for the most premium tickets; with the average starting ticket price at SGD $S56. The price depends on a range of factors including the type of event, performers, venue, and ticket category.

Visiting Singapore

Despite modern Singapore only being founded in 1819 as a trading post of the British Empire, it was quickly becoming one of the wealthiest countries in the world by the 1960s. Today, this tax haven has the second-highest GDP per capita after Luxembourg, thanks to its role in global finance and shipping. From its avant garde theatres and cutting-edge art exhibitions to its futuristic architecture, it’s clear Singapore isn’t shy about flaunting its wealth. The Marina Bay skyline, featuring the three iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel towers and the Supertree Grove at Gardens by the Bay, have become synonymous with the city. But while it is suffused with modern high-end shops, hotels, and restaurants, there are pockets that have remained true to its Chinese and Muslim origins that charm you with their rich history and culture.

KFF Singapore Badminton Open, Singapore Indoor Stadium

This was my first BWF event and it was an awesome experience. Some feedback. 1. Checks and entering the event venue was smooth and well done. 2. There were many events like, meet and greet, games, practice courts, t-shirt,s and other good sales, etc outside and near the mall. However, there was no information about them, like a list or directory anywhere. We would have never known if we had not stepped out for a break! 3. A scoreboard outside may also help patrons plan their breaks better on when to return.

KFF Singapore Badminton Open, Singapore Indoor Stadium

The chairs are horrible. The floor boards are detached so whoever walks on it creates prolonged trembling sensation for everyone. The food is horrible. Never mind it’s overpriced, I can understand and accept the over pricing but I cannot accept the atrocious quality of food and coffee. Axiata Malaysia is a ton better than SG open’s event.

KFF Singapore Badminton Open, Singapore Indoor Stadium

Overall, I felt this year volunteer or committee members to not be as sporting and helpful as last year. There are some volunteer who are lovely and helpful but the rest (mostly) made us feel as though we attended free event. Worst part of all days throughout the tournament were we felt like being chased out from the stadium, understand the stadium needed to clean and prep for next day but we faced the same situation until the last day on final game. No complain on the facilities and we were very comfortable at our seats but we always leave the tournament with unhappy feelings every day. It made us reconsider whether or not to attend next year Singapore Badmitnon Open again.
