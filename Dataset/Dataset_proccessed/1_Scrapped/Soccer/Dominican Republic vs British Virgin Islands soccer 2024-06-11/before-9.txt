‘Celebrate America Concert’ will return to Washington two days later

Along with being a staple community event, it’s the biggest fundraising event of the year for the Sperryville fire department. Organizers, company volunteers and licensed pyrotechnists Mike Leake, Chucky Jenkins and Greg Williams grew up attending the annual event and are trying to “keep the tradition going.” 

The Sperryville Volunteer Fire Department recently purchased a "brush truck" using funds raised by the annual Fourth of July celebrations.

Col. John R. Bourgeois, for decades the director of "The President's Own" U.S. Marine Band, once again will conduct his American Festival Concert band Saturday, July 1 on the grounds of Avon Hall.
