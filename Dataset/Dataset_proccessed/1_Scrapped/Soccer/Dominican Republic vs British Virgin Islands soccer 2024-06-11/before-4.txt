ROAD TOWN, Tortola, VI- The [British] Virgin Islands put up a strong showing against Guatemala in their debut match of the group stages of the CONCACAF leg of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers at A. O. Shirley Ground on Saturday, June 8, 2024.

Many thought the VI, ranked 39 in CONCACAF, would have been dealt a humiliating defeat by 9th-ranked Guatemala; however, the home side showed courage in restricting the visitors from Central America to just 3 goals.

Óscar Castellanos’ right-footed shot from outside the box to the top left corner in the 23rd minute gave Guatemala the lead.

Rubio Rubín’s left-footed shot from very close range to the centre of the goal in the 45th+3-minute saw Guatemala close halftime with a 2-nil lead.

The Virgin Islands were then unfortunate to concede a penalty shortly after the resumption when Jadon Abrams handled the ball in the penalty area.

José Pinto converted the penalty with a right-footed shot to the high centre of the goal in the 47th minute.

VI hit by injury woes

There was more misfortune for the Virgin Islands, as three of their top players, Luka E. Chalwell, Tyler Forbes and Miguel Marshall picked up injuries in the match.

The VI now play the Dominican Republic at the Estadio Panamericano on June 11, 2024.

VI host highly ranked Guatemala in FIFA World Cup Qualifier tomorrow

The [British] Virgin Islands Senior National Team will be hosting Guatemala in their debut match of the group stages of the CONCACAF leg of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers at A. O. Shirley Ground tomorrow, Saturday, June 8, 2024.

The home side had defeated US Virgin Islands (USVI) in their home and away tie in March to earn a slot in Group E alongside Guatemala, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Dominica.

The game at 3:00 PM is like a David and Goliath match-up with Guatemala ranked 9th in CONCACAF while the VI is ranked 39, only above US Virgin Islands and Anguilla.

Guatemala started its qualifying campaign with a 6-nil victory over Dominica on Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

According to the BVI Football Association (BVIFA), this match is a crucial step for the VI national team as it aims to make its mark on the international stage.

'Difficult match' expected

The BVIFA also said the team has been training rigorously under the guidance of Head Coach Chris Kiwomya, and the players are determined to showcase their skills and dedication.

"It's going to be a very difficult match playing against a team that's in the top 10 of a CONCACAF ranking. That's something we've wanted to do, since I've become head coach, is bring a big team to the islands and try to qualify to the next round in any competition that we do......with all the people on the island behind us, who knows what might happen," Kiwomya stated in a BVIFA press release on June 5, 2024.

The BVIFA said this match is not only a chance for the team to advance in the World Cup qualifiers but also an opportunity to inspire young athletes and fans across the territory.

Tickets for the match are available for purchase at BVI Football Association, Hazeem Beauty Supply, and Mr Nice Guy-Virgin Gorda.

Tickets cost $15.00 per adult and $5.00 per child.

NEEDS TO PLAY TOGETHER AS A TEAM , PASSING THE BALL EARLY AND GETTING INTO POSITION TO INTERCEPT AND BE PREPARED YO EXECUTE EVEN FROM DIFFICULT ANGLES , WHICH CAN CATCH SOME GOALKEEPERS OFF GUARD SOMETIMES , AND DON'T EXPECT EVERY BALL TO COME TO YOU ,THE WAY YOU WOULD LOVE IT TO COME TO YOU , AND WHILE WAITING ON THE BALL A GOOD OPPOSING PLAYER CAN COME AND TAKE POSESSION OF IT , AS A FORMER PLAYER I KNOW THAT THE BALL DON'T ALWAYS COME AS YOU WOULD LOVE IT TO COME , FOR SOME REASON , LIKE - /
MIS KICK / OVER YOUR HEAD OR TOO WIDE ETC SO YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE NESSARY ADJUSTMENTS AND EXPRESS YOUR SKILLS IN THAT MOMENT , ITS THE COACH'S DUTY TO GET THAT . MESSAGE ACROSS TO THE PLAYERS AND LAST NO SELFISHNESS , IF ANOTHER PLAYER IS IN THE RIGHT POSITION SIMPLY PASS THE BALL ITS CALLED TEAMWORK

The future lies in the hands of a new elected BVIFA administration. New blood is required for BVI to get to the next level. The old administration had done as much as they can and we should thank them
