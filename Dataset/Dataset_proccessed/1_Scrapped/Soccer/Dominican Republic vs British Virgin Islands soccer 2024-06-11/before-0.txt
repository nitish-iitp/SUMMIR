Why the USA and West Indies are Co-Hosting the T-20 World Cup 2024?

Many common people and cricket lovers are still unaware of the rationale behind choosing the USA and the West Indies as the T20 World Cup 2024 venue.

Well, the decision to host the T-20 World Cup in the United States of America (USA) and the West Indies is a strategic move by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to globalise the sport and tap into new markets.

The USA, with its vast diaspora of cricket fans and growing interest in the sport, offers an untapped potential for expanding cricket's reach. Hosting matches in cities like New York, Miami, and Los Angeles not only caters to the existing fanbase but also introduces cricket to a broader audience in a country dominated by other major sports.

Known for producing some of the greatest cricketers in history, the Caribbean islands are synonymous with a festive cricketing culture. Venues in Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica, and other islands offer a carnival-like atmosphere, complete with vibrant music, colourful costumes, and enthusiastic crowds.

This blend of new and traditional cricketing territories ensures a diverse and memorable tournament experience for fans and players alike.
