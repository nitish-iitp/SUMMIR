Dominican Republic vs British Virgin Island Prediction

Neither of these two sides are renowned on the international scene and both started their qualification campaign on a losing note. However, the Dominican Republic are heavy favorites here and having home advantage gives them an extra edge. The victory they registered in the sole head-to-head meeting 14 years ago highlights the difference between these two sides.

British Virgin Island are minnows on the international scene by every metric and anything other than a resounding defeat would be a surprise. They needed penalties to see off the United States Virgin Island in the last round following a 1-1 aggregate draw.

We are backing Dominican Republic to claim a comfortable win in addition to a clean sheet.

Prediction: Dominican Republic 4-0 British Virgin Island
