Senegal made light work of Malawi in their latest 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Group L on Friday night following a dominant 4-0 win at Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade.

Senegal immediately assumed possession of the ball and manufactured a couple of corners during the first three minutes of the game, which prompted Malawi to sit back on the edge of their own area.

Malawi were reduced to 10 men in the 16th minute of the match after Brighton Munthali fouled Sadio Mane in a one-on-one situation toward the goal.  

Patrick Mwaungulu was then summoned as the sacrificial lamb to replacement goalkeeper George Chokooka, while Senegal continued to apply pressure going forward.  

The Flames were placed under immense pressure by Senegal throughout the first half, especially after Munthali’s sending off in the 16th minute.

After regrouping from a cooling break at the half-hour mark, Senegal immediately went on the attack.

Senegal’s pressure eventually paid off in the 35th minute after Pap Gueye added his name on the scoresheet.

After a squared run across the box, Iliman Ndiaye picked out the midfielder who subsequently placed his left-footed shot in the top right-hand corner of the goal.

Following wave after wave of attacks by Senegal en-route to the half-time whistle, the referee eventually called time on the first 45 with the Indomitable Lions’ slender lead intact.

Mane and company remained on the front foot after the restart while Malawi struggled to string consecutive passes together for much of the tie.

With Senegal in the driving seat, Malawi battled to keep up with the pace set by the African giants.

Senegal doubled their advantage in the 68th minute of the match as Mane joined Gueye on the scoresheet with a left-footed effort from the center of the 18-yard-area.

It was raining goals at Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade after the 70th minute, as Boulaye Dia slotted home Senegal’s third with a close-range finish in minute 71, while Nicolas Jackson added a fourth just six minutes later.

The Chelsea star’s effort proved to be the final bit of action in the tie as Senegal cantered to a 4-0 win in their latest Group L assignment.
