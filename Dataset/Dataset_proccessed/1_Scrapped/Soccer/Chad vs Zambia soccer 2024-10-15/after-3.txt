The Republic of Chad will face off against the Chipolopolo of Zambia at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Cameroon tomorrow. Zambia will be confident of securing one of the two spots on the standings following their win over Sierra Leone, and a win here would further strengthen their chances of making it to the next phase.

Chad

FIFA Ranking: 177th


Last five games: LLDLD

Les São team march here with another stalemate against Zambia. They have drawn twice over their last three games, with a negative stalemate against Sierra Leone in their opening group game and (0-0) against Zambia. They have lost once against Ivory Coast on their ground. Chad have not had any success in continental football since they were founded in 1962. Chad made it to this group after eliminating Mauritius in the preliminary stage. The back-to-back wins over their opponent were their first since 2015.

Chad presently sit in third place on the log, picking up two points from a combined six. 

Zambia

FIFA Ranking: 93rd


Last five matches: LLLWD

The guests were below par against Chad, failing to convert any of their three shots at goal. Zambia were nowhere near their best as their lead striker, Kennedy Musonda, failed to impress. 


Avram Grant men are aware that three points are non-negotiable against their guests, and with the quality on board, we expect a positive response from the guests. 

Patson Daka, who have scored three goals each in this qualifying round to ensure their team remain in the second spot on the log, have been absent for his side in recent games. 

Zambia have picked up four points from a combined nine, conceding four and scoring three. 

Expert Betting Tips

Zambia fired three shots at goal on their ground and none found the back of the net against Chad. The Chipolopolos have been terrible at the back but managed to keep a clean sheet after twelve games without one. 


We think the guests will strive to win here, and since both teams will play on a neutral ground; we expect them to win or draw and score more than a goal for 1.67.

We expect the guests to win here for 1.72.

A total of under 2.5 goals might surface here for 1.60.

Good luck!
