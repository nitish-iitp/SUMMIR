Preview: Chad vs. Zambia - prediction, team news, lineups

Chad will be aiming to secure their first victory in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series when they host Zambia at Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo on Tuesday afternoon.

Meanwhile, the Chipolopolo boys will hope to extend their lead over their opponents, as they currently occupy second place, two points ahead of Chad, who are in third place.

Chad survived the onslaught from the Chipolopolo of Zambia last Friday to pick up a point in a goalless draw, despite facing 14 shots on goal with three on target.

Les Sao's defensive solidity has seen them concede just two goals in the 2025 AFCON qualifiers in three matches, the second-fewest in Group G, but they remain the only side in the group yet to find the net, which has left them with two points and in third place.

The North-central Africans, who have never qualified for the World Cup finals or Africa Cup of Nations in their history, will be hoping to pick up a win on Tuesday, which would take them to second place in the group, in position to clinch one of the two automatic AFCON tickets in the group.

However, Chad have not won any of their last five matches across all competitions, losing three matches and drawing the other two, since a 2-1 win over Mauritius in March in an AFCON qualifying preliminary round game.

Within that time frame, Les Sao conceded five goals and scored none, highlighting their attacking deficiency, an issue Kevin Nicaise will hope to address when they face a side they have not beaten in three meetings between them.

Meanwhile, Zambia will be ruing their lack of cutting edge in attack last Friday despite having 66 percent of the ball and hitting the woodwork once.

The draw left Avram Grant's men in second place with four points, five behind group leaders Ivory Coast, but it was their first clean sheet in 16 games.

A win for the Chipolopolo in the second leg on Tuesday could potentially see them pull five points clear of the chasing pack before heading into the final two games next month.

Zambia won 2-0 in their only trip to Chad in 2006, in what was coincidentally an AFCON qualifying match, but a four-match winless streak on the road, with the last three being defeats, puts some doubt in their ability to replicate this result.

Nicaise deployed a back five in the first leg, which paid off, and he is likely to stick to the same plan with Gabin Allabatna between the sticks.

With Les Sao yet to find the net after three AFCON qualifiers, the front two of Amine Hiver and Marius Mouandilmadji will have all eyes on them to produce the spark on Tuesday.

Kennedy Musonda led the line for Zambia in the absence of Leicester City forward Patson Daka, who sustained an ankle injury during August's pre-season friendly against Lens.

Songa Chipyoka registered one shot on target, which is more than what Joseph Sabobo, whom he replaced, could muster in over an hour of playing time, and this could leave the coach with a decision on who starts.


Chad possible starting lineup:
Allabatna; Osee, Thiam, Tchouplaou, Mbangossoum Ngouyamsa; Damba, Tchouplaou; Damba, Yeo, Youssouf; Hiver, Mouandilmadji

Zambia possible starting lineup:
Mulenga; Chepeshi, Chongo, Sakala, Chisala; Chama, Chaiwa, Kangwa; Chipyoka, K. Musonda, Kampamba


We say: Chad 0-1 Zambia

Chad survived the first-leg scare, but they may not be as fortunate in the return leg if they allow Zambia that many attempts on goal without creating enough themselves, and that is why we believe the visitors will edge the game at the final whistle.
