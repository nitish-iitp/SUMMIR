17-year-old Brazilian sensation Endrick scores stoppage-time winner for Brazil

Brazil has a history of young, prolific goalscorers. Its latest may be peaking just in time for Copa America, the next major international tournament.

Endrick, Brazil’s next teen prodigy, scored the winner for his country in the 96th minute against Mexico on Saturday. The goal helped Brazil avoid disaster after letting a two-goal lead against El Tri slip away in the second half.

Earlier this year, the newly minted Real Madrid forward became the youngest Brazilian goalscorer since Pelé in 1957. He then became the only player under 18 to score in two consecutive international matches since Pelé, finding the back of the net against England and Spain. And now, he’s made it three goals in three appearances just before the start of Copa America later this month. For the second consecutive match, his future Real Madrid team-mate Vinícius Júnior provided the assist.

The play started with a Brazil set piece in Mexico’s defensive third. After it was initially cleared out of danger, the ball ended up at the feet of Vini Jr, who placed a well-weighted pass into the box for the jumping head of Endrick.

After the goal, Endrick ran to the corner flag to celebrate, ripping his shirt and tossing it in the process. Before he was finished, the teen picked up his No. 9 shirt and held it up for the crowd to see. While the goal wasn’t his first for Brazil, it was his first while donning the number that many great strikers have worn before him — chief among them Ronaldo, nicknamed “O Fenomeno” (The Phenomenon).

At 15 years old, Endrick was the standout player at Brazil’s biggest under-20 tournament. He made his senior debut for Palmeiras in Sao Paulo in October 2022, two months after his 16th birthday. By the end of that year, he had won a Brazilian championship medal. Since then, he has added another to his collection and signed for Champions League winners Real Madrid. He’ll officially join the team after his 18th birthday, which isn’t until next month.

He may not be the first-choice No. 9 just yet, but Endrick is definitely making it difficult for head coach Dorival Júnior to ignore him. Brazil’s final test before Copa America comes on Wednesday, June 12, against the U.S. men’s national team, which fell to Colombia 5-1 after a second-half defensive collapse.
