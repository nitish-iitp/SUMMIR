Ready for a crazy weekend in Aggieland?

Not only will the Fightin' Texas Aggies face the Oregon Ducks for a best-of-three super regional at Blue Bell Park, but the historic Kyle Field will host an international soccer match as Mexico battles Brazil.

Here's what you need to know for each event...

Beginning with this weekend's schedule:

Baseball

Game 1 - Saturday, June 8, at 1 p.m. CT
Game 2 - Sunday, June 9, at 6:30 p.m. CT
Game 3 (if necessary) - Monday, June 10 - Time TBD

Soccer

Saturday, June 8, at 7:30 p.m. CT (kickoff will be closer to 8 p.m. CT)

That’s the easy stuff. It’s the other logistics that get a little trickier.

Obviously, this is TexAgs, so we'll begin with the baseball.

If you've attended a ballgame at Blue Bell Park this season, you probably know the gates open 90 minutes first pitch. That will remain true for the 2024 Bryan-College Station Super Regional.

When it comes to baseball parking, Lot 100J (right next to the ballpark) will continue to operate as it has all season — serving baseball parking pass holders and RVs.

The biggest change for baseball parking will obviously come on Saturday when the rest of Lot 100 surrounding Reed Arena will be used for both baseball and soccer fans.

ICYMI: College Station will use a paid parking program for street parking in the neighborhoods south of Kyle Field (KBTX)

Lot 100 sections A-G surround A&M's on-campus coliseum, and it will cost $35 per vehicle to park there on Saturday. Additionally, any valid Texas A&M parking permit will provide access to all $35 lots around campus.

NOTE: If you present your Saturday baseball ticket to the parking attendant at Reed Arena, you will be able to park for $5 instead of $35.

West Campus Garage, Gene Stallings Blvd. Garage, University Center Garage and South Side Garage, as well as lots 100T, 30A, 30C, 40 and 60, will charge $40 per vehicle. These options will NOT grant valid A&M permits access on Saturday.

However, parts of Houston St., Joe Routt Blvd., Old Main Dr. (tunnel under Wellborn Rd.) and Olsen Blvd. (next to West Campus Garage) will be closed beginning at 2 p.m. CT.

Lot 30 must be entered via University Dr.
Lot 40 must be entered via Coke St.
Gene Stallings Blvd. Garage must be entered by using Old Main Dr. and Lamar St. by Albritton Bell Tower.
South Side Garage must be entered via. Spence St. from Bizzell St. and Lewis St.

As opposed to Texas A&M football game day, on-campus shuttles will NOT run for the soccer match. A City of Bryan Shuttle will provide service from Downtown Bryan.

For those hoping to use ride-share options, Lot 30E will provide pick-up and drop-off options.

For more information regarding parking on campus, visit transport.tamu.edu.

On-campus parking for Saturday can be purchased HERE for June 8 and June 15’s George Strait concert

For soccer fans, the posted kickoff for 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup champion Mexico and five-time FIFA World Cup champion Brazil is set at 7:30 p.m. CT.

Despite being a friendly, superstars are expected to play on the Aggieland pitch as Saturday’s MexTour match serves as a key tune-up to the 2024 Copa América, which begins June 20 in the United States.

Possible selections include Edson Álvarez (West Ham), César Montes (Almería) and Luis Chávez (Dynamo Moscow) for “El Tri” and “Canarinha” players Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid), Danilo (Juventus) and Alisson (Liverpool).

While approximately 60,000 (and counting) tickets have been sold, there is hope that Saturday’s match at the 102,733-seat Kyle Field can surpass the MexTour attendance record of 90,526 at the Rose Bowl in 2010.

The ticket windows at Kyle Field will NOT be selling tickets on the day of the event. All tickets must be purchased online.

Tickets to Mexico-Brazil can be purchased through the 12th Man Foundation HERE

Kyle Field’s gates will open two hours before the posted kickoff time, which means fans can enter the stadium beginning at 5:30 p.m. CT.

NOTE: Sources have said the game will not begin until closer to 8 p.m. CT to allow time for pregame ceremonies and team introductions.

Additionally, a “Fútbol Fiesta” will be held in Aggie Park prior to the match. The pregame event is open to the public and will operate from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday. Details surrounding the Fútbol Fiesta are limited.

Plan ahead. Leave earlier than usual.

And PLEASE do yourself a favor: Start hydrating NOW!

Forecasts call for a lot of sun and highs in the mid-to-upper 90s with plenty of humidity.
