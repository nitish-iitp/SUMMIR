Brazil player ratings vs. Mexico: Endrick plays hero to save sloppy Selecao with match-winning cameo

Mexico vs Brazil

Endrick stepped up for the Selecao off the bench, netting a stoppage-time winner to defeat El Tri

Endrick played hero for Brazil, the teenager nodding home a 97th minute winner for the Selecao to snatch a 3-2 victory over Mexico after a sloppy defence surrendered a 2-0 lead.

A heavily rotated Brazil side almost crumbled in the second half, conceding twice in the last 20 minutes - including a 93rd-minute equalizer - and seemed certain to settle for a tie. But Endrick, having come on as a substitute, responded with a neat header to salvage a pre-Copa America friendly win.

Dorival Jr.'s side didn't need long to take the lead, Andreas Pereira strolling through the Mexico defense before finishing into the bottom corner. El Tri had their moments in the first half, forcing Alisson into a handful of smart saves.

But Brazil made it two after the break. A well-constructed move did the work, Yan Cuoto beating his man on the right wing before cutting back to Martinelli - who poked the ball into an open net. Mexico pulled one back, though, Yan Cuoto turning the ball into his own net.

El Tri had few further chances - but took advantage of their best one. The ball broke to Guillermo Martinez, who lashed past Alisson from a tight angle. Still, there was enough time for Endrick to make the difference, the teenager providing the first of what Selecao fans hope will be many big moments in his nation's colors.

Goalkeeper & Defense

Alisson (6/10):

Made a few neat saves, moved the ball well. Couldn't do anything about the Mexico goals.

Yan Couto (5/10):

Really shaky defensively, and put one into his own net. But his assist for Martinelli was a thing of beauty.

Eder Militao (6/10):

Dealt with Santiago Gimenez effectively, was good in the air. Showing signs of his pre-ACL tear self.

Gleison Bremer (6/10):

Moved the ball well from center back, won his duels. Solid, if unspectacular.

Guilherme Arana (6/10):

Put in a decent shift, but left space behind, which Mexico exploited to pull one back.

Midfield

Douglas Luiz (6/10):

Steady in central midfield, without being particularly effective.

Ederson (5/10):

The Atalanta midfielder flew into his tackles and was up for the right - but some of his passing was woeful.

Andreas Pereira (7/10):

Took his goal well - even if the Mexico defense crumbled around him. Orchestrated effectively in central midfield when everyone else seemed to lack composure.

Attack

Gabriel Martinelli (6/10):

Largely ineffective on the left wing in the first half. Took his goal well, though.

Evanilson (4/10):

17 touches, eight completed passes, no real look on goal. Anonymous.

Savio (6/10):

Assisted the opener wonderfully, and did a lot of pretty things. But he was otherwise a bit aimless in some of his dribbling.

Subs & Manager

Endrick (9/10):

Almost scored within seconds of coming on. Actually scored in the 97th minute. A special, special talent.

Pepe (5/10):

Didn't influence the game much.

Lucas Paqueta (6/10):

A few nice touches, but made the wrong decision once or twice.

Vinicius Jr (7/10):

Offered pace and quality on the left. Forced a couple of saves.

Bruno Guimaraes (7/10):

Flew into tackles, passed well. He should be one of the first names on the teamsheet.

Dorival Junior (7/10):

Put out a team consisting mostly of backups with one eye on Wednesday's friendly with the US. His team looked good, threw it away, and then were saved by a teenager. Not convincing, but not a bad warmup.
