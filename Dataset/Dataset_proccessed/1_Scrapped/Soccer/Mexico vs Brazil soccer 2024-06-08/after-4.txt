If the match against Brazil was supposed to be a test to diagnose how Mexico would do in the Copa America, then the diagnosis is serious.

On Saturday at Kyle Field in College Station, El Tri fell 3-2 to the five-time world champion in front of 85,249 spectators. This was the largest crowd in Texas for a Mexico exhibition match.

The defeat against Brazil was preceded by an embarrassing 4-0 that Uruguay foisted on Mexico on Wednesday in Denver.

The situation of the Mexican team led by Jaime Lozano is critical leading up to the Copa America that starts on June 20 and will be played in 14 United States venues, including AT&T Stadium in Arlington.

Mexico’s first match in the Copa America will be against Jamaica in Houston on Saturday, June 22.

After barely five minutes of play, Brazil scored the game’s first goal when Andreas Pereira entered Mexico’s box and, with a powerful shot, beat goalkeeper Julio González.

El Tri’s defeat was accompanied by rumors spread by some Mexican outlets saying that Lozano would resign as Mexico’s coach.

“I’m not going to quit,” Lozano said.

“I believe in long processes; I know there are some versions out there regarding my possible resignation, but I would never do something like that. I know that we need good results, but we are preparing this team for a Copa América,” Lozano said.

Brazil scored their second goal of the night in the 53rd minute when Yan Couto assisted Gabriel Silva.

Mexico’s first goal was scored by Julián Quiñones in the 71st minute, and Guillermo Martínez tied the score in stoppage time with a header.

Brazil achieved victory with an agonizing goal from Endrick Sousa in the last play of the match.

At Kyle Field, Mexican fans showed their discontent by booing their team and shouting a homophobic chant. In the 59th minute, the fair play protocol was activated, the match was stopped by the referee for three minutes, and a warning was issued to the fans.

When the match ended, #FueraJimmy became a trend on social media, with Mexican fans calling for Lozano’s dismissal.

The Mexico coach said he understands fans’ annoyance and frustration but hopes his team improves in Copa America.

“I know that people are sad and very upset by the results, but what matters most is having a united group of players who believe in this process and want to be successful”, Lozano said.

Lozano said that his players’ reaction to tying the game gives him hope that things will begin to improve.

“I am very proud of my players. They left everything on the field,” said Lozano, who was hugged by all his players in the center of the field at the end of the game.
