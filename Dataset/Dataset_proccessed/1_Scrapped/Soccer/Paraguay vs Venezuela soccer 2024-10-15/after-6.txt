WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFICATION
PARAGUAY
VENEZUELA

October 15, 2024 at 23:00 local time at the Estadio Defensores del Chaco in Asunción, Paraguay is the World Cup Qualification encounter between Paraguay and Venezuela slated for. Maza P. from Chile will officiate this pivotal Round 10 game; both teams are keen to land a place in the top six to increase their chances for World Cup qualification.

Looking to qualify for their first World Cup since 2010, Paraguay recently took a significant point away from Ecuador and presently ranks outside the top seven. Conversely, Venezuela kept their place in the inter-confederation playoff spot after managing a somewhat impressive 1-1 draw against world champions Argentina. Given only one point separating these two clubs, this game looks to be a fiercely fought struggle for vital qualifying points.

BETTING TIPS AND MATCH INSIGHTS

Today’s Paraguay vs Venezuela prediction depends on both teams’ recent performance and their World Cup qualifying aim. Paraguay has been perfect in their past three games, including an amazing triumph over Brazil that will inspire their confidence. Venezuela has also proved they can compete with the best; they hold Argentina to a draw and show great defensive force. Given both clubs’ defensive skills, this might be another low-scoring game where both sides probably have more of an eye towards securing a point than towards launching a winning attack. Although Paraguay’s home advantage could provide them a small boost, Venezuela’s fortitude should not be undervalued.

Paraguay Results

Paraguay has been gradually improving their form in recent weeks, remaining unbeaten in their last three World Cup qualifiers. Below is a summary of their recent matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
10.10.24	WCQ	Ecuador vs Paraguay	0-0	D
11.09.24	WCQ	Paraguay vs Brazil	1-0	W
06.09.24	WCQ	Uruguay vs Paraguay	0-0	D
03.07.24	Copa America	Costa Rica vs Paraguay	2-1	L
29.06.24	Copa America	Paraguay vs Brazil	1-4	L

Paraguay’s recent results highlight their defensive strength, with three clean sheets in their last three World Cup qualifiers. Their ability to frustrate teams like Brazil and Uruguay shows they have developed a sturdy defense, though their attacking output remains a concern, as they have struggled to score consistently.

Venezuela Results

Venezuela has had a solid qualification campaign so far, with only one loss in their last eight matches. Below are their most recent results:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
10.10.24	WCQ	Venezuela vs Argentina	1-1	D
10.09.24	WCQ	Venezuela vs Uruguay	0-0	D
05.09.24	WCQ	Bolivia vs Venezuela	4-0	L
06.07.24	Copa America	Venezuela vs Canada	1-2	L
01.07.24	Copa America	Jamaica vs Venezuela	0-3	W

Recent form for Venezuela shows their defensive ability, particularly in games against bigger clubs like Argentina and Uruguay. Their 4-0 loss to Bolivia, however, indicates that they might be vulnerable away from home, especially when up against opponents with aggressive attack capability.

Paraguay vs Venezuela Head-to-Head Results

Paraguay and Venezuela have had several competitive matches in recent years. Here’s a summary of their last five head-to-head encounters:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
12.09.23	WCQ	Venezuela vs Paraguay	1-0
09.09.21	WCQ	Paraguay vs Venezuela	2-1
13.10.20	WCQ	Venezuela vs Paraguay	0-1
10.10.17	WCQ	Paraguay vs Venezuela	0-1
08.10.15	WCQ	Venezuela vs Paraguay	0-1
