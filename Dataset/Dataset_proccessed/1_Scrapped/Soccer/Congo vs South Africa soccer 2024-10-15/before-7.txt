South Africa’s national soccer team, Bafana Bafana, is all set to take on Congo Brazzaville in a highly anticipated 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier. The match will be held at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Gqeberha on Friday, 11 October 2024, at 7 PM.

Bafana Bafana Ready for the Challenge

After a week of intense training in Gqeberha, the South African squad appears to be in top form and fully prepared to face their Congolese opponents. The team, led by coach Hugo Broos, has been focused on improving their game following less-than-ideal performances in recent matches against Uganda and South Sudan. Despite managing to secure four points from those games, Broos emphasized the importance of seizing this opportunity to bounce back with a stronger performance.

Speaking to the media, Coach Hugo Broos expressed his confidence in the team’s readiness:
“I’m more comfortable now than I was at the beginning of our camp. I saw a very hungry team this week. We trained well, prepared ourselves thoroughly, and I like this attitude. Our games against Uganda and South Sudan were not our best, and we were lucky to achieve those points. Now, I see a group eager to progress, especially on the mental level. The team is motivated to achieve two good results against Congo.”

Broos has been emphasizing mental resilience and teamwork throughout the training sessions. The team’s tactical preparations and enhanced focus on fitness were evident during practice sessions held at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, where the players showed a renewed commitment to winning.

Ronwen Williams Calls for Local Support

Bafana Bafana captain Ronwen Williams also spoke about the positive atmosphere in the camp and the dedication shown by the entire squad. Williams acknowledged the fresh energy brought in by the new players, who quickly adapted and embraced the team spirit.

“There’s been a change in mentality, and you could see it this week in training. The brotherhood, the joy, the happiness—it’s all been there. The new players have settled in well and are looking good. We’re looking forward to the game tomorrow and urge the whole of Eastern Cape and Gqeberha to come out and support us. Show love to the boys tomorrow night,” Williams encouraged.
Congo Brazzaville’s Arrival and Preparations

The Congolese team arrived in Gqeberha on Thursday afternoon and had their first training session at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium later in the evening. Congo Brazzaville, led by their coach, is determined to secure points in this qualifier, knowing that their performance against South Africa could be decisive for their AFCON 2025 campaign. The team is reported to have a mix of seasoned players and emerging talents, making them a challenging opponent.

A Look Back: South Africa vs. Congo in Past Encounters

Historically, matches between Bafana Bafana and Congo Brazzaville have been fiercely competitive. South Africa has maintained a slight edge over Congo in recent years, but the Congolese team has also shown resilience, making these fixtures unpredictable. Fans can expect a thrilling and closely contested match as both teams strive for victory.

Importance of the AFCON Qualifiers

The 2025 AFCON qualifiers are crucial for both South Africa and Congo Brazzaville, as they aim to secure their places in the continental tournament. Bafana Bafana is determined to avoid past disappointments and qualify for AFCON 2025, a goal that requires consistent performance in the qualifiers. Coach Broos has been vocal about the need for his team to focus on winning their home games, which are essential for building momentum in the campaign.
