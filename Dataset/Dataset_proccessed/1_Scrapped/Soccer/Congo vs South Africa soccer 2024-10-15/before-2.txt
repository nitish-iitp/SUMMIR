Having spent almost a week in Gqeberha, Bafana Bafana face Congo Brazzaville in a highly anticipated 2025 AFCON Qualifiers at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium this evening, with the match set to be broadcast on SABC2 and SABC Sport.

Hugo Broos and his charges are hoping that the early result between Uganda and South Sudan ends in their favour so that they can leapfrog the Cranes into top spot ahead of their travel to Congo to play the return match on Tuesday, 15 October 2024.

The visitors only finally arrived in the Eastern Cape on Thursday afternoon, with their first training session also happening at the match venue in the evening.

South Africa sits in second place with four points behind Uganda on the same number of points though the latter holds a slight superior goal difference.

The match will kick off at 19:00 from the 2010 FIFA World Cup venue.
