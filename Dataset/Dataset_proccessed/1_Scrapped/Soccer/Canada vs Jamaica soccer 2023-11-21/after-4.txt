Canada fails to qualify for Concacaf Nations League

The Canadian men’s team won’t be playing in the continental tournament next year after Tuesday’s home loss to Jamaica.

Canada 2 (Davies 25’; Koné 69’), Jamaica 3 (Nicholson 62’, 66’; De Cordova-Reid 78’) 
Canada finished 2023 with 5 wins, 4 losses and 2 draws 
Canadians suffered their 1st loss at BMO Field since 2010 

TORONTO – The immediate future of the Canadian men’s team looks pretty bleak. 

Canada suffered a shocking 3-2 loss to Jamaica in the decisive leg of its Concacaf Nations League qualifier on a drizzling Tuesday night before an announced crowd of 17, 588 at BMO Field, a result that was an absolutely brutal outcome for the home side.

The two-legged Nations League playoff finished 4-4 on aggregate, but the Jamaicans won the series on the away goals rule. That means the Reggae Boyz clinched a berth for the 2024 Nations League finals and next summer’s Copa América that'll be hosted by the United States at the expense of the Canadians who only needed a draw on Tuesday to qualify for both competitions. 

Canada is eliminated from Nations League contention and would need to win a one-game playoff next March against Trinidad & Tobago in order to advance to the Copa.
