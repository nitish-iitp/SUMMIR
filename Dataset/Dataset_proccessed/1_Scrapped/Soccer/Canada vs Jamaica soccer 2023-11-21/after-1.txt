How to watch the Concacaf Nations League match between Canada and Jamaica, as well as kick-off time and team news.

Canada and Jamaica lock horns in the second leg of the CONCACAF Nations League quarter finals with both teams vying to make it through to the next round of the competition.

Canada won the first leg 2-1 riding on the back of goals from Jonathan David and Stephen Eustaquio as they'll be looking to make it through to the semi-finals. Canada have been a very dominant side playing in their own backyard winning 100% of their home games and interim manager Mauro Biello would want to maintain his side's scintillating streak.

Despite Shamar Nicholson equalising the billing in the second-half Jamaica were heartbroken in the dying minutes of the game as Canada restored the lead once again. The Reggae Boyz have lost their last two quarter-finals against North American outfits but with the home side just possessing a single goal lead, Jamaica would be confident of turning around the scoreline.

Here, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch, including TV channel, streaming details and more.
