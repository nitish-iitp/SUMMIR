Andorra and South Africa face off in a friendly match at the May 19th Stadium in Algeria on Thursday.

The fixture is part of the pilot phase of the FIFA Series, seeing teams from different confederations square up in exhibition games keen to unlock technical development opportunities previously unavailable to many of them.

Andorra hope for a positive outcome in Thursday's friendly game in Algeria, seeking their first victory in competitive or non-competitive games since 2022.

That 2-0 triumph came against Liechtenstein in September 2022, and the European nation have since fallen to 10 losses in 13 matches.

Managing draws against Latvia (1-1), Kosovo (1-1) and Belarus (0-0) in competitive games have prevented a whitewash, but Koldo Alvarez is well aware that goalscoring has been an issue before this week's game.

The Tricolours have lost the last five matches without scoring, while the goalless match with Belarus extends the European nation's run without a goal to six games.

Without a goal since the 2-1 loss to Israel in June 2023, Andorra seek to end that run against one of Africa's finest sides at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Hugo Broos's men hope to secure a win in their first match since securing bronze at AFCON 2023 and are keen to extend Andorra's misery, even if Thursday's game is non-competitive.

Bafana Bafana are undefeated in friendly games since losing 5-0 to France in March 2022 — a nine-game streak that has witnessed four wins.

The South African side have been undone by their inability to score in these games, highlighted by minimal wins during their run despite conceding three times — 2-1 against Mozambique, 1-1 vs Algeria and 1-1 when they played Cote d'Ivoire.

Keeping clean sheets ideally should be enough to guarantee victories, but Bafana Bafana's six in nine friendly matches have not resulted in ample wins for the 1996 African champions.

With World Cup qualifying to resume in June, Broos is keen to secure a positive outcome against Andorra and distract from the continued questions about his future in the job.

Josep Gomez is expected to start in goal ahead of Francisco Pires, who has had to accept a substitute role in the national team.

Marc Vales is not in the squad, thus forcing Andorra into a change at centre-back.

Despite netting 12 times in 18 league appearances for NK Krka in the Slovenian second tier, Ricard Fernandez has netted only one goal for Andorra — a 3-0 win over San Marino in October 2021, and the forward seeks his first goal for his country in almost three years.

As for South Africa, a grumpy Broos is on a collision course with Mamelodi Sundowns boss Rhulani Mokwena, who claims that AFCON 2023 heroes Ronwen Williams and Teboho Mokwena are injured and might not travel.

Percy Tau is not expected to participate on Thursday, having not been selected in the squad.

Several players in the group, like Khanyisa Mayo, Iqraam Rayeners, Bruce Bvuma, Tapelo Xoki, Patrick Maswanganyi and Mlondi Mbanjwa hope to make a case for regular selection if they get game time.


Andorra possible starting lineup:
Gomez; De Pablos, Llovera, Guillen, Nicolas, Garcia; Alaez, Vales, Pujol, Cervos; Fernandez

South Africa possible starting lineup:
Bvuma; Mobbie, Kekana, Sibisi, Modiba; Sithole, Mosele; Mayambela, Zwane, Appolis; Rayners



We say: Andorra 0-1 South Africa

South Africa should eke out a victory against Andorra to extend the European nation's winless run.
