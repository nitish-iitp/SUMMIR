The Portland Thorns picked up where they mostly left off before the two-week international break with a 1-0 win over the visiting North Carolina Courage on Saturday, June 8 at Providence Park.

The Thorns weren’t able to create many chances on the day, but a strong pass from Marie Muller to Hina Sugita in the box in the 78th minute led to Sugita getting fouled from behind.
