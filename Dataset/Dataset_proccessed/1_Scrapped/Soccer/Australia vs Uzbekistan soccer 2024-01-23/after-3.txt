Martin Boyle converted controversial first-half penalty
But White Wolves were well worth their equaliser

In the end, Azizbek Turgunboev’s 78th-minute equaliser felt like cosmic justice for Uzbekistan. Sprinting in from his position on the right, the 29-year-old soared to meet a ball lofted in by Jaloliddin Masharipov, rising, fairly, over the top of Aziz Behich and giving Maty Ryan no chance of keeping the ball from nestling into the back of the net. It ensured that the White Wolves would progress as the second-placed finisher in group B, advancing alongside the top-of-the-tree Socceroos, who topped the standings after Tuesday evening’s 1-1 draw at the Al Janoub stadium in Qatar.

It also ensured that the Uzbeks would be rewarded for a performance in which they were the better side across the 90 minutes, and prevented Martin Boyle’s controversial penalty in first-half stoppage from proving the difference. Because never was a round of applause delivered with more contempt than the ovation Uzbekistan coach Srečko Katanec gave the fourth official in the moments before the Scottish-born Socceroo drilled a penalty into the bottom corner of the net, sending Utkir Yusupov the wrong way and converting the game’s only shot on target.

Katanec’s side were in the ascendancy at that point, stifling the Socceroos’ attempts to fashion looks on goal and increasingly keying in opportunities to break from their disciplined defensive shape, pounce on wayward passes and stream forward with the numbers and intent that harkened to their White Wolves nickname. In the minutes prior, a desperate last-ditch sliding challenge from Harry Souttar had been the only thing standing between Otabek Shukurov and driving in a dangerous shot at Ryan’s goal.

But now they were about to go down, falling afoul of a VAR intervention that adjudged Odiljon Hamrobekov to have handled the ball in the penalty area as he tried to slide in and dispossess Kusini Yengi. Replays showed that the contact with the 27-year-old’s arm came as it provided support to his bodyweight as he challenged the Socceroo striker – contact not enough to stop him from skipping onward and delivering the ball to an open Riley McGree at the top of the box.

By the letter of the law, it may have been correct. Even if the arm was supporting and it was completely unintentional, it still technically was creating a barrier between Yengi and the goal. The Socceroos could also perhaps argue that it was the karmic scales re-balancing after Umar Eshmurodov had escaped VAR upgrading his yellow card to a red after seemingly denying Boyle a clear goalscoring opportunity on the counter in the 25th. But it still would have been an incredibly harsh way to lose a game.

With a new level of feeling in the game, Masharipov flashed a lethal-looking free kick just wide of Ryan’s goal in the 50th minute as Australia increasingly sat off with their lead before Eshmurodov had a headed effort chalked off for offside ten minutes later after being just unable to time his run to beat Australia’s offside trap from a free kick. And when the goal did arrive, the Uzbeks were good value for it, having kept coming at the Australians and not allowing themselves to settle for a narrow defeat and scoreboard-watching.

Australia, again, hadn’t been very good with the ball. Creating just a single shot on target and struggling to find a connection in the final third. Their past 180 minutes of football, in fact, have produced a combined total of just two shots on target, only one of which was from open play and even that one, Jackson Irvine’s goal to secure a 1-0 win over Syria, came after a fortunate deflection fell to him.

In previous games, the talent gap and more conservative approaches from their opponents allowed the Socceroos to take the win anyway. Against a better quality side in Uzbekistan, however, a foe that didn’t just retreat into their shell, a lack of cohesion and inspiration in the final third was punished. A hint, perhaps, of what may await them in the knockout stages unless they can find their way.
