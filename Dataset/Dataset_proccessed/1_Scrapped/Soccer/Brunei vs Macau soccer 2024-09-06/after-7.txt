Brunei have never beaten Macau before (PC: Getty Images)

Brunei host Macau at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium in Bandar Seri Begawan on Friday for the first leg of their 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifier playoff clash. Ranked 190th in the world, Brunei are one of the weakest sides, according to the FIFA Ranking, but have been posting improved results lately.

Having lost all four official games since the start of 2023, the Wasps have won their next three.

They beat Vanuatu 3-2 in a FIFA Series friendly back in March, followed by a pair of 1-0 wins over Sri Lanka. As such, Brunei could feel they have the momentum here, and will look to reach the second round of the qualifiers.

Macau, who are only five places above them in the world rankings, have only played two unofficial friendlies so far this year, against Southern District and Taichung Futuro.

Their last official game was back in October 2023 when the Lotus' Team played Myanmar in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier first round. A 5-1 defeat away from home was followed by a drab 0-0 draw in the return.

Brunei vs Macau Prediction

Brunei have never beaten Macau but look best placed to break the jinx given their form right now, having won their last three consecutive games.

The Lotus' Team haven't played an official game in almost a year now, and this lack of gametime can hurt them here. We expect Brunei to secure a narrow victory.

Prediction: Brunei 2-1 Macau
