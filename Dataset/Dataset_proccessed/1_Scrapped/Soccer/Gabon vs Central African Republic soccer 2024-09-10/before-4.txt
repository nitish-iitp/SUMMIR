Gabon will host Central African Republic in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match at Stade de Franceville (new) on Tuesday.

The hosts are seeking their first points in this campaign, while the visitors aim to build on their opening-round victory.

Gabon were thrashed 4-1 by Morocco at the Stade Adrar last Friday, kick-starting their AFCON qualifying series on a losing note.

The first half of the game saw four penalties awarded, with both sides getting two each, while Hakim Ziyech netted both for Morocco, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed his first spot kick but stepped up to convert the second, leaving the Gabonese trailing 2-1 at the break.

The Panthers had several opportunities to grab a second and level the game, but goals from Brahim Diaz and Ayoub El Kaabi took the result beyond the reach of Thierry Mouyouma's side.

Gabon, who are bottom of Group B, will hope the situation changes when they take on Central African Republic on Tuesday in what will be the first-ever meeting between both sides.

The hosts have enjoyed good results on home soil in recent times, having won their last two home games, which were against Gambia and Kenya in the World Cup qualifiers.

Meanwhile, the Central African Republic, who have never qualified for the AFCON, have made a promising start to their qualifying campaign.

Les Fauves secured a 3-1 home victory over Lesotho last Thursday, thanks to a first-half brace from Amiens SC forward Louis Mafouta and a second-half goal from Goduine Koyalipou.

With Morocco the clear favourites in Group B, the CAR will be hoping to secure second place ahead of Gabon. Tuesday's clash against Gabon, therefore, appears to be a crucial battle for that position.

Raoul Savoy's side have enjoyed a strong run of form in 2024, with four wins in five matches - their only defeat during this period came against Ghana in the World Cup qualifiers.

Prior to that, they had recorded victories over Bhutan and Papua New Guinea in friendlies and a win over Chad in World Cup qualifying. However, the visitors have struggled on the road in recent matches, going winless in their last four away games, which included two defeats to Ghana, a loss to Comoros, and a draw against Mali.

We expect an unchanged front three of Aubameyang, Warren Babicka Shavy and Denis Bouanga from Gabon, and they will hope to deliver the goods.

A midfield three of Brimau Nziengui, Guelor Kanga and Medwin Biteghe started last time out, and they will hope they retain their spots once again.

Mafouta has scored five goals in his last two appearances for Central African Republic, and he is expected to start in a front two alongside strike partner Koyalipou, who is also looking to score in consecutive matches.

Marseille's Geoffrey Kondogbia and Slavia Sofia's Isaac Solet are expected to partner up at the heart of midfield for the visitors.


Gabon possible starting lineup:
Mbaba; Ekomie, Appindangoye, Moucketou-Moussounda, Oyono; Biteghe, Kanga, Nziengui; Bouanga, Aubameyang, Babicka

Central African Republic possible starting lineup:
Youfeigane; Gambor, Youga, Ndobe, Tatolna; Baboula, Kondogbia, Solet, Namnganda; Koyalipou, Mafouta



We say: Gabon 3-1 Central African Republic

Gabon have won their last two home matches, while Central African Republic are winless in their last four away games. Taking these forms into consideration, we expect the home side to win this match.
