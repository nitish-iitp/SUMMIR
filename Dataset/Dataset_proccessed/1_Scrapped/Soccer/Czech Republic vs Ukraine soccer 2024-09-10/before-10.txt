Costco had an Astro Bot + Astro Bot controller bundle for $120 this morning, sold out in less than an hour. Might swing by the store and see if they have it but it may have been online only. The disc is in stock for $53 so that’s nice.

I've never been a Costco member, didn't know they sold video games, might have to check that out. Can you preorder a game from them or just go pick something off the shelf?

I preordered Astro Bot (the game) from Target and they are only just preparing it for shipment. Target is kinda slow to ship any preorders, but I get discounts there for using the store card, so its a give and take...

I ordered the controller from PlayStation Direct though and got a notification that it is supposed to arrive today

I don’t think Costco does pre-orders, but it looks like you can order a lot of their stuff w/o being a member. Games and consoles tend to be stocked pretty well but the selection is extremely limited. Discounts on some things like PSN cards usually say “member only item” but a lot of games and accessories don’t have that notice.

Watching that DF video briefly to see some highlights, this looks really awesome and will be a great game no doubt. They said it's on the level of Nintendo's best Mario games. That's how I feel about Astrobot Rescue Mission VR, which is a 10/10 video game.

I'm glad Asobi Sony went back to the varied themes like Haunted, Desert, Construction, etc., instead of just everything computer console themed like Astrbot Playroom PS5.

Target used to be a "Free Delivery on the release date" retailer like Best Buy also used to be, but I think those days are gone unfortunately for disc games, now instead arriving a day or more later most times. That is frustrating since the weekend is the best time to often play a new game if not working.

Years ago, most games in the US anyway, released on a Tuesday, but now, most times it's on a Friday it seems.

Question for anyone who pre-ordered the physical version:

Does the pre-order bonus code come inside the box or is it e-mailed to you?

I ordered it from Amazon (U.S.) and never received an e-mail, but I don't want to open the box if they screwed me out of a code.

Update: Can confirm it comes with a code sheet.

I don't think physical Astro Bot has any preorder bonus (except the poster in the case). I believe the digital goodies all come with the Digital Deluxe version.

EDIT: nevermind, did some more research. The preorder bonuses are unlocked during gameplay apparently, linked an article here.

I have it now - I can confirm it comes with a code sheet for the preorder bonuses, but I think you're right that you still have to unlock some of them.

I hope this game takes a more linear path like the original.






Well described about ducking under obstacles in the VR version, headbutting the soccer ball, or using the controller as a weapon or tool for Astrobot in the VR version. I still play it any time I boot up the PSVR1.
Yes, it (VR and Astrobot) felt like being a kid again, rushing down the stairs on Christmas morning, and opening the Nintendo NES or Sega Megadrive, then looking forward to playing every day for the rest of the holidays.
VR as a whole did that to me, made gaming exciting and fresh again. So much so, it pulled me out of my gaming slump, and I bought a PS5, Switch and have been playing constantly ever since.

I have a lot to be grateful for when it comes to VR. Astrobot was the pinnacle, along with Statik, and RE7.

It’s also came in handy with the PS plus extra subscription, as I had my head buried in VR for a whole six years, so now I have a great back catalogue of regular PS4 and PS5 games to play!

What was your favourite Astrobot level in VR? Mine was the beach for sure.


Even talking about it has me hyped for this new game. Mario move over, there is a new kid in town.

My wife is not a fan of games but she asked me several times today why I’m not playing the one with the cute robots. Guess I need to finish up SW:O and move on to Astro Bot.

PC players want this. I won't buy a PS5 and want to play it on my computer as well. (Before this, Astro's Playroom was the only PS5 game that interested me.) But it should stay exclusive. They should look at the small but worthwhile success of the game and make more like it. Diversify their portfolio with smaller games that can afford to stay exclusive again, so that even if a game doesn't sell well, it adds to a variety of games that players still want to buy the useless machine with expensive online access and overpriced junk controllers for.

https://store.steampowered.com/devel...stationstudios

Putting everything on PC is just making the console irrelevant to too many people, a problem that will become worse as the years pass. Having to push a console drives the second parties and in-house studios to make better games with the backing of the company. I enjoyed The Last Guardian for all its faults and doubt that a third party like Capcom or Konami would have supported its development for that long. They'd have rushed it out the door or cancelled it. I miss Team Ico and the rest of Japan Studio. They didn't have so many big successes. They struggled in the PS3 generation and, sadly, had been underfunded for years before the closure. But having smaller teams and lower budgets allowed them to make different kinds of games without taking on so much of the risk that the 200 million dollar slop is so averse to. Again, exclusivity can drive quality. Sega became less productive and much more boring after they went third party. I know that what I'm talking about is a pipe dream for the time being. Publishers are still far too invested in the huge projects that take eight years to make. I understand the irony of mentioning The Last Guardian, whose prolonged development hell was an outlier for Japan Studio.

"But, Mr. Gun, a PC port a year or two later is fine. There's no need to forever exile games to a certain generation of console."

Let's pretend that the PS5 has a nice variety of exclusive games. If we only have to wait two years for ports, if you've made it such a sure thing by porting almost all other newer releases, we're still not gonna buy the 500 dollar console. I don't know how many people I'm speaking for, but the number will grow as more games go to PC.

30 hours to get Platinum.

No spoilers. I’ll just say that last “challenge” almost made me give up on Plat. They hint at a umm new controller skin coming soon..

As for the game. It’s a 9/10. Cool fan service. Very polished except for that 1 game crash I had in 30 hours, + poor HDR. With raised blacks which I have a fix for LG OLED owners. I figured out way too late that I can correct the HDR on this game with my TV thanks to LG’s game optimization settings. Anyone with OLED? If you have the C1 or later choose Default in game brightness + on your TV change Black Stabilizer from 10 to 7.

Some challenges require luck, not skill. However the normal story levels are fine & don’t have this issue.

I’d say it has a strong case for GOTY. We’ll see.

The naming of these games is probably my only concern with this fun series.

Astrobot Rescue Missions VR. Not an inspiring title.
Astrobot Playroom. Sounds trivial.
Astro Bot. Sounds like they couldn't think of anything else.

Astrobot's Adventure 1, 2, 3 sounds better IMO. No big deal but a good title can draw in an audience.

I remember a game called Alpha Protocol. What does a gamer imagine when they hear that name in a list of new games? Or Syphon Filter? That's when actually seeing the game makes the difference beyond the title.

Cool that it helped get you back into gaming.
Favorite levels would be the Haunted levels, the sand beach levels, lava levels, cave levels, cliff levels, cloud levels, underwater levels, in other words, all the levels. Awesome game.

The amount of interactivity with the controller as a gadget and using your PSVR mask to headbutt all the obstacles was a lot of fun in the game.

I remember that one Dandelion flower that you had to force wind into the controller microphone to get it to disperse. Really clever stuff in that game and no doubt this one too.

Playroom PS5 was good but I didn't really think the Console theme was that interesting.

Same here. When I heard this was announced, that's when I finally went back and completed the remaining levels.

Yeah, the challenges in the original and sequel could be tough compared to the regular levels.
I think it'll win some game of the year awards for sure if it's on par or better than the first two.

I bought this but won’t be playing until I complete RDR2 and Alien Isolation (around December is my guess), but my goodness, this game looks absolutely superb.

Yes, every level is superb, you are quite right. I loved it when we were all playing it at the same time in the PSVR thread, talking about each moment as we discovered it. The studio/creators put so much thought into every detail.

This PS5 looks freaking awesome as well.

I wanted to buy the game+controller bundle from Costco for my son's bday next month but it was sold out. I kept randomly refreshing the product page today and it randomly came back in stock. Quickly placed an order and it seems to have gone through. It's sold out again but if you're looking for the controller I'd recommending compulsively checking the Costco page in case it comes back up.

It looks very cool to be fair.
