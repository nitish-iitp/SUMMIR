Hello! By the close of play, we want you showboating like Kerlon. Three, two, one, go…

On the way:

🔁 The Seal Dribble rebooted

🤕 Arsenal’s Odegaard injury scare

⚽ Gibraltar; the political football

🟥 A comedy red card

Seal Of Approval: The boy who could juggle the ball on his head… during a game

Ronaldinho the man has his flaws but Ronaldinho the showman was Brazil’s coolest export.

He used to do this trick where he pinged a ball 20 yards above his head and watched it drop before killing it dead on his big toe. He’d do it on repeat with perfect results, a flawless pre-match habit.

It was my favourite party piece — until I stumbled across footage of Kerlon Moura Souza, or Kerlon as he was better known, defying gravity in a way which Ronaldinho couldn’t. Ronaldinho made the ball stick to his boot. Kerlon made it stick to his head. And not pre-match either.

Both of them in that respect were made for the social media age, with electric skill designed to go viral. But while Ronaldinho went properly global, Kerlon was a white-hot star who burned out before he was 30. He should have been a Brazil international. Instead, he retired at 29, battered and beaten by injuries.

Today, he lives near Charlotte in North Carolina. He runs a local football school. Little did he know that he had become a pet project of The Athletic’s Jack Lang.Desperate to write about him properly, Jack tried everything to get Kerlon to speak to him. But Kerlon would not respond. So Jack took the only option available to him and turned up on the Brazilian’s doorstep. It worked.

‘A real process to learn’

Kerlon’s unique knack of running while controlling a football with his head was dubbed ‘The Seal Dribble’. He was duly nicknamed O Foquinha — the Little Seal.

He would do it unashamedly in competitive matches. Some opponents took umbrage. Some, to coin a good Scottish phrase, absolutely halved him as a means of retribution. YouTube has footage of players brazenly taking him out.

At first, his dad had to check that the tactic was within the laws of the game. “We worked on it every day in order to perfect it,” Kerlon told Jack. “It was a real process.”

It was also the mid-2000s and a time when European clubs were dipping into the South American talent pool. Kerlon was far more than a performing seal. Inter Milan brought him to Italy in 2008. But Kerlon’s body failed him, and he damaged his ACL six times. Four years later, he was on the slide, en route to retirement in 2017.

“I didn’t want to be in pain anymore,” he said. “That’s why I stopped.”

Can he still do it?

Since retirement, he’s settled for a quiet life, but Jack would have missed a trick if he hadn’t asked Kerlon — now 36 — to give the Seal Dribble another go. Kerlon would have missed a trick by refusing.

Bless him. He’s not lost it.

News Round-Up: Odegaard a doubt for derby after ankle injury
Arsenal’s Martin Odegaard picked up what looked like a bad ankle injury playing for Norway last night. As it stands, Mikel Arteta is going into Sunday’s North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur minus Odegaard, Declan Rice and Mikel Merino. That’s a whole midfield. Advantage Spurs?
Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher is actively seeking a way out of Anfield, in search of more game time. Nottingham Forest tried to get him for £7m ($9m) plus USMNT star Matt Turner last month — but that was way off Liverpool’s valuation.
This could have been a big year for Marc Bernal. Instead, Barcelona’s teenage midfielder will spend it recuperating from an ACL injury. He’s had surgery — and the poor lad is looking at a full 12 months out.
Chelsea are attempting to pull in a little more cash by selling 21-year-old striker David Datro Fofana to AEK Athens in Greece. They’re likely to take a hit on the £8.4m ($11m) they paid for him in January 2023.
Harry Kane should win his 100th England cap against Finland today. He says Cristiano Ronaldo is his inspiration, which is interesting because there’s an on-going debate about whether either player is worthy of an international starting place anymore. Look out for Lille’s Angel Gomes too. He’s set for a full England debut.
That outlandish coaching move we covered yesterday — Stockport County’s Andy Mangan to Real Madrid? It’s off! He’s been denied a Spanish work permit. Gutted.
Rock And A Hard Place: What do Gibraltar fans think of Rodri chants?

Gibraltar don’t figure much in coverage of international football. They’re not at San Marino levels — their record contains a small stack of victories — but a territory with a comparable population of 33,000 is as competitive as you’d imagine.

They exist in a strange political orbit, though. To recap briefly, Gibraltar (on the Mediterranean Sea) is a sovereign United Kingdom state and has been since the 18th century. It was previously Spanish land, and Spain has since attempted to reclaim it — without success.

Needless to say, that makes Gibraltar contentious. Spain blocked the national team’s bid to secure UEFA membership until 2013. The matter flared up after Spain beat England in the final of Euro 2024. In the midst of their celebrations, Rodri and Alvaro Morata were heard chanting “Gibraltar is Spanish” to the crowd around them. UEFA banned both players for “violating the basic rules of decent conduct”.

Both examples show how Gibraltar is a bit of a political football — used by the Spanish and, often, the English to score petty points against each other. The Athletic’s Dermot Corrigan decided to go there last week, to watch Gibraltar, where the landscape is dominated by the eponymous ‘Rock’ (above) — in action. He wanted to ask how the most important people in this dispute — the people who actually live there — felt about it.

His conclusion? That Gibraltarians are Gibraltarians, plain and simple. They might be British but they certainly don’t want to be seen as English. They don’t want to be seen as Spanish either. As one local said: “Imagine telling a proud Scot that he is English, see what that gets you.”

Around The Athletic FC
Chelsea’s boardroom is in crisis. Do joint ownership projects at football clubs ever work? Simon Hughes, who watched U.S. pair Tom Hicks and George Gillett run into trouble at Liverpool back in the day, doesn’t think so.
His X account got hacked and started throwing shade at Lionel Messi. He was slow in scoring in La Liga. Kylian Mbappe hasn’t set the house on fire at Real Madrid. But hey, don’t bet against him.
There’s a chance Ajax defender Jorrel Hato winds up at Arsenal. It helps that he loves Jurrien Timber. Jacob Whitehead went to interview the 18-year-old.
Belgian football is awash with Americans and potential USMNT stars. Greg O’Keeffe is keeping tabs on them for us in his player tracker.
From English team nicknames yesterday to French team nicknames today. The first round’s on me if you can tell me which Ligue 1 side is known as ‘Les Pirates’.
Most clicked in yesterday’s TAFC: our takedown of the USMNT’s woeful showing against Canada. I bet you were looking for Jesse Marsch’s quotes…
Meanwhile, we mentioned that most clicked last Friday was our list of club-less players. One of them has found a move. Ex-Manchester United and Barcelona forward Memphis Depay is off to Corinthians in Brazil.

And Finally…

TAFC doesn’t often dip into Italy’s regional leagues but today we’re making an exception, because Italy’s regional leagues saw an incomparable red card over the weekend.

ASD Pontassieve were playing M.M. Subbiano in La Promozione (tier six). It was 0-0. Pontassieve broke away on the counter-attack so one of Subbiano’s coaching staff did what anybody would do… by sneaking onto the pitch and clipping the heels of striker Monsef Bourezza.

Obviously we don’t condone the offence. But it’s very funny. And good on Pontassieve for granting us permission to reproduce their video.

You won’t see a more hopeful use of the universal ‘hands up, not guilty’ gesture…
