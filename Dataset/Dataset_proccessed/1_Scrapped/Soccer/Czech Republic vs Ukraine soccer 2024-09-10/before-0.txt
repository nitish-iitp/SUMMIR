Preview: Albania vs. Georgia - prediction, team news, lineups

Albania are set to host Georgia in each side's second UEFA Nations League B game on Tuesday at Air Albania Stadium.

The home side are in second place in Group 1 with three points after they won 2-1 against Ukraine on September 7, while the visitors are first with three points after they beat the Czech Republic 4-1 on the same date.

The hosts had to come from behind to earn all three points against Ukraine after Yukhym Konoplia opened the scoring in the 49th minute, before goals from Ardian Ismajli in the 54th minute and Jasir Asani in the 66th minute completed a comeback.

Despite only having 41% possession, Albania had five shots on target and generated two big chances, the same number as Ukraine, who managed just three attempts overall.

Boss Sylvinho was unable to lead his side out of the group stage of Euro 2024, though it was only the Red and Blacks' second ever Euros campaign and qualifying should be seen as a sizeable achievement itself.

In their most recent Nations League tournament in 2022-23, Albania finished third with two points in a four-team group that also featured Israel, Russia and Iceland, and they have failed to win their last four matches in the competition.

Sylvinho's team have won just three times in their last 10 fixtures, losing four times and drawing on three occasions.

Opponents Georgia come into the clash having beaten the Czech Republic 4-1, with three of their goals coming between the 53rd and 66th minutes.

Though the Czech Republic had 56% possession, they failed to create any big chances in the game while Jvarosnebi produced four of their own in what was a strong counter-attacking display.

The result means that manager Willy Sagnol, who has been in charge since February 2021, has won twice, drawn once and lost twice in his last five games.

The visitors made their European Championship debut in 2024, and while they were eliminated by eventual winners Spain in the round of 16, the fact they finished third in their group and qualified for the next stage is laudable.

Georgia's record in the Nations League is impressive, with the team having won six of their last seven fixtures in the competition.

In fact, the home side have lost just once, drawn six times and won 12 of their 19 games in the Nations League.

Sagnol's side have been poor away from home for some time considering they have lost six of their last eight matches on the road, a record that stretches back to November 2022.

Right-back Elseid Hysaj captained Albania against Ukraine, and he may be joined in defence by centre-backs Ardian Ismajli and Marash Kumbulla, as well as left-back Mario Mitaj.

In attack, Qazim Laci, Nedim Bajrami and Jasir Asani could be selected to start behind striker Rey Manaj.

As for Georgia, Liverpool-bound Giorgi Mamardashvili will start in goal and could be shielded by centre-backs Giorgi Gvelesiani, Guram Kashia and Lasha Dvali.

The visitors will no doubt look to pair Georges Mikautadze with talisman Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, especially considering that both scored against the Czech Republic.


Albania possible starting lineup:
Strakosha; Hysaj, Ismajli, Kumbulla, Mitaj; Ramadani, Asllani; Asani, Laci, Bajrami; Manaj

Georgia possible starting lineup:
Mamardashvili; Gvelesiani, Kashia, Dvali; Kakabadze, Chakvetadze, Kochorashvili, Kiteishvili, Lochoshvili; Mikautadze, Kvaratskhelia



We say: Albania 1-2 Georgia

Given Georgia's impressive counter-attacking display against the Czech Republic, it would not be surprising if they opted for a similar strategy against Albania and found success.

However, the visitors have been poor away from home of late, and the hosts could cause difficulty for their opponents on Tuesday.
