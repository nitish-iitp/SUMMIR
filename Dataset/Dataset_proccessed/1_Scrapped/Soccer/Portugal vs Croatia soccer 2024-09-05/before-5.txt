Croatia’s late sports legends get their own stamps
by croatiaweek September 4, 2024 in Sport

(Croatian Post)

On 5 September 2024, Croatian Post will release new commemorative stamps as part of the “Croatian Sport” series.

These stamps pay tribute to two legendary figures in Croatian sports: Miroslav Ćiro Blažević and Dražen Petrović.

The stamps, each with a nominal value of €1.70, will be issued in sheets of nine stamps with an additional label, with 25,000 copies printed for each design. A special First Day Cover (FDC) will also be available.

This commemorative edition was designed by Tomislav Vlainić, a Zagreb-based designer, using photographs by Robert Valai and Radiša Mladenović.

The release was created in collaboration with the Croatian Sports Museum and the Dražen Petrović Memorial Centre.

Miroslav Ćiro Blažević: The Unforgettable Football Maestro

Miroslav Ćiro Blažević is widely regarded as one of Croatia’s most influential football managers.

Born on 9 February 1935 in Dolac, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Blažević had a remarkable career that began as a talented footballer playing for clubs such as Dinamo Zagreb, Lokomotiva, Sarajevo, and Rijeka.

His move to Swiss club Sion in 1963 marked the beginning of his illustrious managerial career.

Blažević returned to Croatia in 1979 to manage Rijeka, and in 1980 he took over Dinamo Zagreb, leading them to win the Yugoslav First League title in 1982—ending a 24-year drought for the club.

His iconic image, often with a white scarf around his neck, became a symbol of that victory.

Blažević’s legacy is perhaps best remembered from his time as the Croatian national team manager from 1994 to 2000. He led Croatia to the quarter-finals of the 1996 European Championship and, more famously, to third place at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, a historic achievement for the nation.

His influence persisted even after his passing on 8 March 2023, leaving an indelible mark on Croatian football.

Dražen Petrović: The Basketball Mozart

Dražen Petrović, often referred to as the “Basketball Mozart,” remains one of the greatest basketball players Croatia has ever produced.

Born on 22 October 1964 in Šibenik, Petrović began his professional career at just 15 years old with Šibenka, quickly becoming the team’s star player.

His career took off when he joined Cibona Zagreb in 1984, where he achieved tremendous success, including winning two European Championships.

Petrović’s international career was equally impressive. He won silver and bronze Olympic medals with the Yugoslav national team and later achieved silver with Croatia at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. His move to the NBA in 1989 marked a new chapter, where he played for the Portland Trail Blazers and the New Jersey Nets, breaking barriers for European players in the league.

Tragically, Petrović’s life was cut short in a car accident on 7 June 1993. His legacy was immortalised when he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002, securing his place as a legend in the world of basketball.

The commemorative stamps celebrating the legacies of Miroslav Ćiro Blažević and Dražen Petrović will be available from 5 September 2024 at post offices or online at www.epostshop.hr.
