Portugal vs Croatia

The Portuguese legend showed he still has plenty more to give for his country as he netted his 900th career goal on Thursday

Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 900th goal of his career as his Portugal side secured an entertaining 2-1 win over Croatia in their Nations League opener.

The hosts started the brighter and took the lead in the seventh minute when Manchester United team-mates Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot combined in the box, before the latter slotted past Dominik Livakovic. After withstanding a sustained spell of possession, Portugal then doubled their lead in the 34th minute as Ronaldo volleyed in Nuno Mendes' delicious cross to hit another remarkable career milestone.

The visitors pulled a goal back four minutes before the break as Dalot stabbed the ball into his own net following a sliding effort from Borna Sosa. Both teams then cancelled each other out in the second half as Portugal earned three points in Group A1, with Scotland next up on Sunday.

GOAL rates Portugal's players from Estadio da Luz...

AFP
Goalkeeper & Defence

Diogo Costa (7/10):

Was at full stretch to deny Kramaric's well-struck drive but there was little he could do for his team's own goal. A solid pair of hands in between the sticks.

Diogo Dalot (7/10):

Showed the predatory instincts of a striker with a clinical strike early doors but was unfortunate to score at the other end as the ball flicked off his ankle and past the despairing Costa. Pulled off a stunning sliding tackle to halt a dangerous Croatia attack in the game's final quarter.

Ruben Dias (8/10):

The Manchester City star largely dealt with whatever came his way and had a swagger about him in possession.

Goncalo Inacio (6/10):

Was solid enough but didn't look as assured at the back as defensive partner Dias.

Nuno Mendes (8/10):

Bagged a stunning assist with an inch-perfect cross into the box, as Ronaldo did the rest. The marauding full-back nearly scored a goal of his own but his rifled effort was straight at the keeper. This was an impressive, all-round display from the 22-year-old.

Midfield

Bernardo Silva (6/10):

Had a quiet first half by his lofty standards and despite getting a bit more of the ball in the second period, the City ace seemed under-used on the night.

Vitinha (7/10):

Anchored Portugal's midfield well and drove out from deep nicely. The Paris Saint-Germain player was a smooth operator in the centre of the park.

Bruno Fernandes (8/10):

Neatly set up Dalot with some quick feet and a lofted pass, before the right-back tucked away a composed finish in a creative performance. Also did his fair share of defensive work, too.

Attack

Rafael Leao (7/10):

Looked a threat coming off the left wing and linked up with Ronaldo well, before being replaced at the interval.

Cristiano Ronaldo (8/10):

His powerful low drive was well saved by keeper Livakovic but he got his goal not long after with a poacher's finish from six yards out for his 131st international strike. The Al-Nassr man was always looking for work and linked up well with his team-mates.

Pedro Neto (7/10):

Was unlucky not to make it 3-1 just before half-time as his powerful strike cannoned off the bar. He too was withdrawn for the second half.

Subs & Manager

Joao Neves (5/10):

Gave the ball away cheaply and had little impact when he came on. Is unlikely to start soon based off this display.

Nelson Semedo (8/10):

Showed a lot of attacking intent and was a threat every time he gallivanted forward.

Antonio Silva (7/10):

Was neat and tidy at the back when introduced.

Diogo Jota (N/A):

Didn't get much of a chance to have a say on the contest.

Pedro Goncalves (N/A):

Had no time to make an impact.

Roberto Martinez (7/10):

His side was on song and looked slick for much of the game while his substitutes, especially Semedo, worked nicely.
