Senegal vs Gambia LIVE!

Senegal began their Africa Cup of Nations title defence with a 3-0 victory over 10-man Gambia helped by Lamine Camara's double in Group C on Monday, bringing an end to a sequence of surprise results at the tournament in the Ivory Coast.

After a shock-filled Sunday at AFCON where the minnows had the upper hand over heavyweight opponents, Senegal restored faith in the form book as Pape Gueye scored early and Camara added two more to ensure victory in the opening Group C encounter.

Gueye put Senegal ahead in the fourth minute at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium, while 20-year-old Camara underlined his promise with a fine finish seven minutes after the break and a sublime second into the top corner four minutes from time.

Senegal 3-0 Gambia | 90+4 mins

Just the one venture into the box for Gambia in this period of added-on time, they look set to leave this one empty handed.

Such a big win virtually puts Senegal on the brink of the last-16 already, and only a last-ditch defensive header denies a chance for 4-0.
