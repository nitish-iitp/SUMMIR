After years of relentless pursuit, Senegal enters the upcoming AFCON tournament as the reigning champions, having clinched victory in Cameroon during the 2021 edition.

The Lions of Teranga have overcome past disappointments, notably losses in the 2002 and 2019 finals. In 2002, then-captain Aliou Cissé, now the team’s coach, led Senegal to a heartbreaking 3-2 penalty defeat against Cameroon. In 2019, Cissé, as coach, experienced another final defeat, narrowly losing to Algeria by a lone goal.

However, redemption finally came during the 2021 edition as Senegal secured their first AFCON title.

The journey to glory featured a pivotal moment with Sadio Mane converting a 97th-minute penalty in their opening game against Zimbabwe. Subsequent draws against Guinea and Malawi saw them through the group stage. Senegal showcased their prowess in the knockout stages, with victories over Cape Verde (2-0), Equatorial Guinea (3-1), and Burkina Faso, setting up a highly contested final against Egypt.

In a goalless draw that extended to extra time, Senegal emerged victorious in the penalty shootout with a 4-2 scoreline, sealing their AFCON triumph.

The defending champions, still under the leadership of Coach Aliou Cissé, are eager to maintain their remarkable form as they face tough competition in the upcoming tournament, battling against teams like Gambia, Cameroon, and Guinea.

The quest for back-to-back titles awaits the Lions of Teranga as they aim to etch their name in AFCON history once again.

2023 AFCON Fixtures:

15 January 2024: Senegal vs Gambia
19 January 2024: Senegal vs Cameroon
23 January 2024: Guinea vs Senegal

Key Players to Watch:

Sadio Mane: The former Liverpool star, now with Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, is a pivotal force for Senegal. Mane’s exceptional performances earned him the Best Player award in the 2021 AFCON, and the 31-year-old remains one of Africa’s top attackers.
Kalidou Koulibaly: Regarded as one of the continent’s best defenders, Koulibaly played a crucial role in Senegal’s 2021 AFCON victory. Despite his recent move to Al Ahli in Saudi Arabia, the 32-year-old continues to be a linchpin for the Teranga Lions.
Ismaila Sarr: A prolific forward currently with Olympique Marseille, Sarr is known for making an impact in critical moments. With 54 appearances for Senegal, the 25-year-old is expected to play a vital role in Senegal’s title defence.

Coach: Aliou Cisse: Former captain Aliou Cisse, who experienced both heartbreak and triumph with Senegal, has silenced doubters with his coaching prowess. After leading Senegal to victory in the 2021 AFCON, Cisse aims to further solidify his reputation with another triumph.

Team Statistics:

Appearances: 16
Best Results: Champions in 2021 AFCON
Worst Results: Group Stage in 1968, 1986, 2008, 2012, and 2015
Most capped player: Idrissa Gueye with 102 appearances
Captain: Kalidou Koulibaly
