Senegal Statements

Aliou Cissé spoke before starting his participation in the African Cup of Nations: “The pressure that exists is a positive pressure that motivates us to win, but I have a lot of experience because I will have my fourth experience with Senegal as a coach during the African Cup of Nations” .

“There are many candidates for the continental title and Senegal is not the only favorite to win the title.”

“Now we have a new challenge, yesterday already happened, which was the 2021 African Cup of Nations and today is the 2023 African Cup of Nations.”

   The most important thing is to start the competition well. I am very focused on the first match against Gambia to achieve a positive result in the first match. "The Gambia is a strong and united team, with strong players."

How does Gambia get there?

Gambia failed to prepare previously because its match against Morocco ended up being cancelled, so its last match it played was in 2020, a match that ended in favor of the rival, Ivory Coast, who dominated and ended up winning categorically.
