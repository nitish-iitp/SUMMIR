Wat H out for this player from Madagascar

One of Madagascar's most unbalanced players is midfielder and left winger Tokinantenaina Randriatsiferana, also known as Tsiry, who plays for Fosa Juniors FC of the local Madagascar League. His short height of 1.63, good ball handling and change of pace in midfield make him a difficult player to mark. Already with national team experience, he has become one of the regulars and favorites in Rakotondrabe's starting eleven.

Wat H out for this player from Chad

The player to watch is the number 10, the 25-year-old striker Marius Mouandilmadji, who plays for Samsunspor in the Turkish Super League and has already scored his first goal in the qualifier against Mali. His speed and eye for goal are just some of the main virtues of the former Porto striker.
