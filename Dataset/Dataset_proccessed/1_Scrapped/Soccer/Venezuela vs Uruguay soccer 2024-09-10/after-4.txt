Venezuela and Uruguay meet on Tuesday in a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifying match. Watch live on Fubo.

The 2026 World Cup CONMEBOL qualification process is nearing its midway point as Venezuela prepares to host a challenging Uruguay team on Matchday 8. La Celeste will officially begin the post-Luis Suarez era after one of the most iconic strikers of the 21st century announced his retirement from international duty following Saturday’s 0-0 stalemate against Paraguay, which marked a second consecutive draw for his team after such a strong streak of form this year. And his remaining Uruguay team-mates would like to do nothing more than triumph in his honor and potentially move within a single point of qualification standings leader Argentina.

There wasn’t a dry eye in the house after Suarez finished his final match with the Uruguay squad on Saturday, accompanied by a hero’s send-off in Montevideo that was only befitting the man himself.

He retires as Uruguay’s top scorer of all time having scored 69 goals for his country, and former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi (whom he currently plays with at Inter Miami) was on hand to pay tribute:

Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez is the obvious candidate to take over from Suarez, though the hotheaded forward is still suspended after jumping into the crowd to defend his family following a Copa America match against Colombia.

Marcelo Bielsa is limited in terms of natural striker options to fill in up front against Venezuela, with Tuesday’s host coming off the back of a stunning 4-0 defeat against Bolivia. 

La Vinotinto is still fifth in the qualification table, however, and well within a chance of making the cut if it can regain winnings ways, though Uruguay won’t be an obliging test subject.

Regional restrictions may apply.
