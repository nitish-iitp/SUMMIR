Uruguay will travel to Estadio Monumental de Maturin for Tuesday's 2026 World Cup qualifying clash against Venezuela.

The hosts are in fifth place with nine points to their name, while Uruguay are five points better off in second position in the CONMEBOL standings.

Venezuela would have been satisfied with their efforts at the 2024 Copa America despite losing on penalties in their quarter-final tie against Canada.

While their campaign may have ended in penalty-shootout heartbreak, Venezuela would have taken confidence from the fact that they topped their group following three consecutive victories over Ecuador, Mexico and Jamaica.

Unfortunately for La Vinotinto, the belief built by their group-stage performance was quashed by Thursday's heavy 4-0 away defeat against Bolivia.

The result extended Venezuela's winless away run in World Cup qualifying to 13 matches, so they will be keen to return to home comforts for Tuesday's fixture.

Venezuela have taken seven points from their three home games in the current qualifying cycle, keeping clean sheets in each of those three matches against Paraguay, Chile and Ecuador.

Uruguay would have been pleased with their efforts in summer's Copa America, with La Celeste finishing in third place in Marcelo Bielsa's first major tournament in charge.

They won their group and ousted Brazil in the quarter-final, before they fell to a narrow defeat in their last-four clash with Colombia.

La Celeste went on to beat Canada on penalties to clinch third spot and wrap up their most successful Copa America since winning the tournament in 2011.

The 2024 Copa America proved to be the final major tournament of Luis Suarez's international career after the veteran forward played his final game for his national side in Friday's goalless draw against Paraguay, representing a fourth consecutive clean sheet in World Cup qualifying.

Suarez was unable to get on the scoresheet in his farewell match, but he still retired as his country's all-time record scorer with 69 goals in 142 appearances.

Uruguay, who sit in second place in the standings, will begin the post-Suarez era with a trip to Maturin, and the visitors will be determined to extend their unbeaten run in World Cup qualifying to six matches.

Venezuela remain without Jhon Chancellor and Yangel Herrera, who withdrew from the squad before Thursday's heavy defeat to Bolivia.

Toulouse midfielder Cristian Casseres will serve a one-match ban, having picked up two yellow cards in the qualifying campaign.

Darwin Machis and Yeferson Soteldo are both in contention to start after featuring as half-time substitutes on matchday seven.

As for Uruguay, they can no longer call upon the experience and goalscoring ability of Suarez following his retirement from international football.

Real Madrid's Federico Valverde and Al Qadisaya's Nahitan Nandez are both suspended due to an accumulation of yellow cards.

Ronald Araujo, Jose Maria Gimenez, Mathias Olivera, Rodrigo Bentancur and Darwin Nunez all remain suspended due to their involvement in the altercation with spectators following the Copa America semi-final against Colombia.


Venezuela possible starting lineup:
Romo; Aramburu, Ferraresi, Osorio, Navarro; Segovia, Martinez, Pereira; Machis, Soteldo, Rondon

Uruguay possible starting lineup:
Rochet; Rodriguez, Bueno, Cacares, Olaza; Martinez, Ugarte, Rodriguez; Pellistri, Araujo, Rodriguez



We say: Venezuela 1-1 Uruguay

Uruguay are still having to cope without the services of several key players, and we think that they will have to settle for a draw, especially as Venezuela have avoided defeat in all three of their home matches in 2026 World Cup qualifying.
