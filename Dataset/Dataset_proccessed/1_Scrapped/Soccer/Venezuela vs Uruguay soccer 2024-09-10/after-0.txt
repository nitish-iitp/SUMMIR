Venezuela Recent Results

Venezuela’s recent performances have been a mixed bag, showing both promising results and some setbacks. Their ability to secure wins against strong opposition has been inconsistent, and they come into this match with a need to regain momentum.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
05.09.24	WC Qualifiers	Bolivia vs Venezuela	4-0	L
06.07.24	Copa America	Venezuela vs Canada	1-2 (1-1)	D/L (after penalties)
01.07.24	Copa America	Jamaica vs Venezuela	0-3	W
27.06.24	Copa America	Venezuela vs Mexico	1-0	W
22.06.24	Copa America	Ecuador vs Venezuela	1-2	W

Venezuela has had mixed results in their last five games, winning three and losing two. Their performance in the Copa America was relatively strong, with victories over Mexico and Ecuador, but their heavy defeat to Bolivia in the World Cup Qualifiers highlights their defensive vulnerabilities. The team will need to tighten up their backline if they hope to contend against Uruguay.

Uruguay Recent Results

Uruguay has also experienced a range of results in recent matches, showing moments of brilliance but struggling to maintain consistency. Their defensive stability has been a positive, but their goal-scoring has left much to be desired.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
06.09.24	WC Qualifiers	Uruguay vs Paraguay	0-0	D
01.09.24	Friendly	Guatemala vs Uruguay	1-1	D
14.07.24	Copa America	Canada vs Uruguay	2-3 (2-2)	D/W (after penalties)
11.07.24	Copa America	Uruguay vs Colombia	0-1	L
07.07.24	Copa America	Uruguay vs Brazil	1-0 (0-0)	D/W (after penalties)

Uruguay’s recent results show a pattern of defensive resilience, with two goalless draws in their last three matches. However, their victories against Brazil and Canada demonstrate their ability to step up in important games. To secure a win against Venezuela, Uruguay will need to find a balance between solid defense and more productive attacking play.

Venezuela vs Uruguay Head-to-Head

The previous head-to-head encounters between Venezuela and Uruguay have generally favored the latter, with Uruguay winning the majority of matches. These games have often been low-scoring affairs, with Uruguay’s defense proving difficult for Venezuela to break down.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
01.02.22	WC Qualifiers	Uruguay vs Venezuela	4-1
08.06.21	WC Qualifiers	Venezuela vs Uruguay	0-0
05.10.17	WC Qualifiers	Venezuela vs Uruguay	0-0
06.10.16	WC Qualifiers	Uruguay vs Venezuela	3-0
09.06.16	Copa America	Uruguay vs Venezuela	0-1

Uruguay has the upper hand in their recent matchups, with three wins and two draws from the last five encounters. Venezuela’s sole victory came during the Copa America in 2016, and since then, they have struggled to find the net against Uruguay. Given this history, Uruguay will likely enter this game as favorites.

Venezuela vs Uruguay – Player Absences

Absences due to injuries, suspensions, and other factors can greatly affect a team’s performance and game strategy. For the upcoming clash, both Venezuela and Uruguay face challenges with key players missing, which may influence the overall outcome of the match. Below is a summary of unavailable players for both teams.

Venezuela Player	Reason	Uruguay Player	Reason
Jhon Chancellor	Injured	Luis Suarez	Retired
Yangel Herrera	Injured	Federico Valverde	Suspended (yellow cards)
Cristian Casseres	Suspended (yellow cards)	Nahitan Nandez	Suspended (yellow cards)
–	–	Ronald Araujo	Suspended (altercation)
–	–	Jose Maria Gimenez	Suspended (altercation)
–	–	Mathias Olivera	Suspended (altercation)
–	–	Rodrigo Bentancur	Suspended (altercation)
–	–	Darwin Nunez	Suspended (altercation)

Both Venezuela and Uruguay are missing key players, with Venezuela’s Jhon Chancellor and Yangel Herrera unavailable due to injury, and Cristian Casseres suspended. Uruguay faces a larger number of suspensions, including influential players like Federico Valverde and Darwin Nunez, which could impact their overall game plan. Uruguay’s reliance on younger talents might make their lineup less experienced, while Venezuela will also need to adjust for absences in their midfield.

Key Points to Watch: Form, Injuries, and Trends

As we approach this crucial World Championship Qualifier, several key factors could influence the outcome. Both teams have had inconsistent form recently, and their squads may be dealing with injuries and fatigue. Here are the main points to keep in mind:

Venezuela’s defense was heavily exposed in their recent 4-0 defeat to Bolivia;
Uruguay has struggled to score goals, with only four goals in their last six matches;
Venezuela’s home advantage could play a significant role in the game;
Uruguay’s historical dominance over Venezuela in past encounters gives them confidence;
Key players like Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez are expected to lead Uruguay’s attack;
Venezuela’s attack has been inconsistent, scoring only seven goals in their last six games;
Injuries or suspensions for either team could shift the balance of power;

Free Tips on Venezuela vs Uruguay

When it comes to making an informed prediction on the upcoming Venezuela vs Uruguay match, there are several crucial factors to consider. Studying team dynamics, past encounters, and current conditions can give you a clearer picture of how the game might unfold. Below, we highlight some essential tips to help guide your betting decisions, taking into account specific aspects of both teams and their performances leading up to the match.

Head-to-Head Statistics
Uruguay has a clear historical advantage in past meetings with Venezuela, having won three of their last five encounters. These results suggest that Uruguay has consistently outperformed Venezuela, which could indicate a psychological edge heading into this match.
Home vs. Away Performance
Venezuela will be playing at home, where they’ve managed to secure important wins in the past, such as their victory over Mexico in the Copa America. Uruguay, on the other hand, has shown resilience in away matches, which makes the home advantage for Venezuela less significant but still worth considering.
Recent Team Form
Venezuela comes off a heavy defeat to Bolivia, which could have impacted their morale, whereas Uruguay’s defensive strength, shown in their goalless draw against Paraguay, might give them the upper hand. Always assess a team’s recent form to gauge their confidence level heading into a game.
Weather Conditions and Pitch State
The weather in Maturín can influence the pace of the game. If the conditions are less than ideal, Uruguay’s stronger defensive style might thrive, while Venezuela’s attack could struggle to find consistency on a slick or heavy pitch.
Team Motivation
Uruguay will likely enter the match with the motivation to secure a direct spot in the World Cup, whereas Venezuela, already struggling in qualification, might play more defensively to avoid another big defeat. This contrast in motivation can shape how both teams approach the game strategically.
