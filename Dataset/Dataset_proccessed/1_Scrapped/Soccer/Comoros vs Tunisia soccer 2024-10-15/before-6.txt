Preview: Comoros vs. Tunisia - prediction, team news, lineups

In the fourth round of fixtures in Group A of Africa Cup of Nations qualifying, Comoros are set to host Tunisia at Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny on Tuesday.

The home side are second with five points and occupy one of their group's two qualification spots, while the visitors are first with six points and lost 1-0 against Tuesday's opponents in their last qualifying match on October 11.

Comoros are the only unbeaten nation left in their four-team group having drawn their first two qualifying matches in September against Gambia and Madagascar.

In their most recent qualifying match, Les Coelacantes beat Tunisia thanks to a 60th-minute winner from Rafiki Said.

Les Coelacantes had just 32% possession in that match but managed to limit their opponents to just one big chance.

If Comoros were to qualify for AFCON 2025, it would be just the second time they have reached the finals of the competition in the last 12 editions of the tournament.

Manager Stefano Cusin's side have won three, drawn two and lost two of their seven most recent games, though it should be noted that they have lost three, drawn two and won just one of their last six home fixtures.

Meanwhile, Tunisia will be disappointed with the loss last time out considering they had won four and drawn one of the previous five matches.

The Eagles of Carthage narrowly beat Madagascar 1-0 on September 5th thanks to a 98th-minute winner from Ferjani Sassi and also only beat Gambia 2-1 due to Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane's 75th-minute goal.

Tunisia have qualified for the last 16 AFCON tournaments, and boss Faouzi Benzarti will be confident that his team can qualify for the finals of the 2025 edition, though he will hope to better his side's group-stage exit from AFCON 2023.

The visitors have been excellent from a defensive standpoint given they have kept 10 clean sheets in their last 14 games.

Benzarti's side have won 12 of their 16 most recent AFCON qualifying matches, including three of their last four.

Tunisia have also been difficult to beat away from home in qualifying, with the side winning seven, drawing three and losing two of their last 12 fixtures on the road.

The hosts are unlikely to make many changes from the team that beat Tunisia last time out, so expect goalkeeper Yannick Pandor to be shielded by centre-backs Warmed Omari and Kassim M'Dahoma.

Iyad Mohamed and Faiz Selemani could be selected to play in a double pivot, flanked by Said Bakari on the right and Yacine Bourhane on the left.

Up front, goalscorer Rafiki Said is certain to feature, while Myziane Maolida could partner him in the forward line.

As for the visitors, Benzarti may name a similar backline given the team's strong defensive displays, so Raed Bouchniba, Yassine Meriah, Montassar Talbi and Amine Ben Hamida are probable candidates to play in a back four.

Ellyes Skhiri could be selected to start ahead of Ferjani Sassi in midfield, and he may be joined by Aissa Laidouni in a double pivot.

Elsewhere, Hannibal Mejbri could come in for Youssef Msakni, while Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane and Hamza Rafia may start as wingers.


Comoros possible starting lineup:
Pandor; Youssouf, Omari, M'Dahoma, Abdallah; Bakari, Mohamed, Selemani, Bourhane; Maolida, Said

Tunisia possible starting lineup:
Memmiche; Bouchniba, Meriah, Talbi, Hamida; Skhiri, Laidouni; Rafia, Mejbri, Ben Romdhane; Jaziri



We say: Comoros 0-1 Tunisia

While Comoros defended excellently against Tunisia in their last clash, it is difficult to ignore the visitors' strong overall form.

However, the hosts could frustrate Tunisia given the away team have relied on late winners in their two wins in the group stage so far.
