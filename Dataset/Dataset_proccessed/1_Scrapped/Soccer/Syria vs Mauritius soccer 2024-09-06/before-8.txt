Intercontinental Cup 2024, When And Where To Watch India Matches: The Intercontinental Cup 2024 is set to take place from September 3 to September 9 at the GMCB Stadium in Hyderabad. This year's edition of the tournament will see host nation India compete against Mauritius and Syria, both of whom are making their first appearance in the competition. Football fans can catch all the action live exclusively on JioCinema and Sports18 – 3.

India will enter the tournament without their iconic all-time leading goal scorer, Sunil Chhetri, who retired earlier this year. The absence of Chhetri marks a significant change for the Indian team as they look to build on their recent successes.

The tournament kicks off with India facing Mauritius, a team currently ranked 179th in the FIFA World Rankings. Mauritius is coached by former French footballer Guillaume Moullec and captained by goalkeeper Kevin Jean-Louis. Despite their lower ranking, Mauritius will be eager to make a strong impression in their debut at the Intercontinental Cup.

Syria, the highest-ranked team in the tournament at 93rd in the FIFA World Rankings, will also be a formidable opponent.

India has won two out of the last three editions of the Intercontinental Cup.
