Day in life of a Guide and Tracker at Monwana

September 6, 2024

Words written by Field Guide Taya Maasch

"As guides, our role is not just to navigate but to interpret, sharing insights into animal behaviour and the delicate balance of this unique ecosystem"

As the hints of dawn paint the sky, another day begins at Monwana Game Lodge in the heart of the Thornybush Private Nature Reserve. For us, the guides and trackers, we embrace each sunrise as a promise of adventure and discovery.

5:00 AM - Rise and Shine

The day starts early for both guides and trackers. The trackers prepare the essentials - the hot box, vehicle, blankets and hot water bottles. Meanwhile, the guides gather in the main area to discuss our plans for the morning game drive, fine-tuning our route based on recent sightings and guests' interests.

5:30 AM - Wake-Up Call

With plans set, it's time to wake our guests. A gentle knock on the door, a warm smile and the inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee greets them as they prepare for the safari ahead.

6:00 AM - Morning Game Drive

As the sun peeks over the horizon, casting a golden glow across the bush, we embark on our morning drive. As guides, our role is not just to navigate but to interpret, sharing insights into animal behaviour and the delicate balance of this unique ecosystem. Each drive is a journey of surprises, from tracking elusive leopards to witnessing the playful antics of elephant calves.

9:00 AM - Breakfast and Relaxation

Back at the lodge, our guests head for a hearty breakfast while the trackers clean and prepare the vehicles for the afternoon adventure. Guides take the time to handle administrative tasks, ensuring everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.

Guests may choose to join us for a guided bush walk, exploring the intricacies of the flora and fauna up close. Others might opt to indulge in a rejuvenating spa treatment, finding serenity amidst the wild beauty.

For families, there is a wealth of activities for the children to enjoy:

Tracking sessions: Children can participate in tracking activities, learning to identify animal prints and signs with their expert guide and tracker.

Family fun: Families can gather for board games or friendly matches of rugby, soccer and volleyball in the riverbed, surrounded by the natural wonders of the African bush

"For us, unveiling the secrets of nature is more than a profession – it’s our passion"

Preparing for Afternoon Drive

As the day progresses, preparations for the afternoon game drive begin. Trackers pack the cooler box and blankets, ensuring every detail is in place. Guides convene to plan routes and await our eager guests.

3:00 PM - Afternoon Game Drive

After a delightful high tea where guests indulge in freshly baked treats and aromatic teas, the anticipation for the afternoon adventure builds.

6:00 PM - Dinner

As the day winds down, dinner becomes a time of shared stories and experiences, recounting moments of awe and laughter. For the trackers, cleaning the vehicle and preparing for tomorrow's drives is a ritual that ensures each day begins afresh.

For us, unveiling the secrets of nature is more than a profession – it’s our passion. As guides and trackers at Monwana Game Lodge, each day offers a new chapter in our ongoing love affair with the African bush.
