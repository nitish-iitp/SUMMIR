Qatar beats Uzbekistan and qualifies for Semi-Finals of AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023™

Qatar played against Uzbekistan in the Quarter-Final match of the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023™ at the Al Bayt Stadium on 3 February 2024. The match kicked off at 6:30 pm.

Al-Haydos breaks through from the right corner flag and heads into the area in the 27th minute. His attempted cross is lifted to the hands of the keeper, who inexplicably spills the ball into his own net on the goal line.

After the deflection on the cross to begin with, it was hard to see how the Qatar captain could have been given the goal and confirmation comes in that it’s an own goal by the Uzbekistani keeper Utkir Yusupov.

Odiljon Hamrobekov from Uzbekistan scored a goal in the 59th minute and extra time was awarded to the match, however, no goals were made in the first and second half.

The match proceeded to a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner.


Qatar won the match with a score of 3-2 in the penalty shoot-out and secured their spot in the Semi-Finals.

Qatar won the match with a score of 2-1 and advanced to the Semi-Finals on 7 February 2024 at 6 pm at Al Thumama Stadium
