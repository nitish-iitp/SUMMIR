Uzbekistan have beaten Qatar in their last three clashes

Qatar face off with Uzbekistan at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor on Saturday in the quarter-finals of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Having failed to impress at the 2022 FIFA World Cup on home turf, hosts Qatar have certainly made a mark at the continental tournament.

The Maroons won all three of their group matches to secure the top spot in Group A before seeing off Palestine in a 2-1 comeback win in the round of 16.

Oday Dabbagh scored in the 37th minute as Palestine went 1-0 up but Hassan Al-Haydos equalized for Qatar in added time. Early into the second half, Akram Afif converted a penalty to turn the match around as the reigning Asian champions continued their title defense.

On the other hand, Uzbekistan overcame Thailand 2-1 in the last-16. Azizbek Turgunboev's first-half opener for the White Wolves was canceled out by Supachok Sarachat just before the hour mark, but Abbosbek Fayzullaev restored the lead for Uzbekistan just seven minutes later.

Qatar vs Uzbekistan Prediction

Qatar are the in-form team in this match, maintaining a 100% record at the tournament. Their attacking game has been strong and they will rely on their talismanic goalscorers such as Akram Afif and Almoez Ali to get them past Uzbekistan. The White Wolves are no pushovers, but we expect them to lose this knockout encounter.

Prediction: Qatar 2-1 Uzbekistan
