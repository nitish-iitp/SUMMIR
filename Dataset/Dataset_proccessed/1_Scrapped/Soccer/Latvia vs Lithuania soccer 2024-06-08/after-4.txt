Kristaps Porzingis headlines 24-man Latvia pool vs Gilas in FIBA OQT

Sidelined at the 2023 FIBA World Cup and even for most of the 2023-24 NBA Playoffs, Kristaps Porzingis is back on court with a vengeance.

The Unicorn is definitely back.

Sidelined for most of the 2023-24 NBA Playoffs due to a strained calf, Kristaps Porzingis came back with a vengeance and was a key player in the Boston Celtics' dominance during Game 1 of the finals.

This could very well be a sign of things to come for KP and Latvia when it comes to FIBA, as Porzingis was named to the 24-man national pool for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in July.

Porzingis was unable to suit up for Latvia in the 2023 FIBA World Cup held in Manila due to a foot injury, but he was present at the sidelines.

  

He was also there when Latvia fell short in the semifinals, as Davis Bertans missed what would have been the game winner against eventual World Cup champions Germany.

  

It was still a Cinderella run for the 11-man Latvia and coach Luca Banchi. The tournament was also a revelation, as 24-year-old point guard Arturs Zagars tallied a World Cup single-game record 17 assists in the fifth place game triumph over Lithuania.

  

Now they would have a golden chance to enter the Olympic Games for the first time since 1936. Only the winner of the Riga OQT will get the Paris 2024 ticket.

Latvia will play in Group A at the OQT with Georgia and the Philippines, while Brazil, Montenegro and Cameroon will be in Group B.
