In their Group C match at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) on Friday night at the Stade Charles Konan Bank de Yamoussoukro, Guinea defeated Gambia 1-0.




Date: 19 January 2024




Guinea (0) 1 (Camara 70′) Gambia (0) 0




Guinea: I. Koné, I. Diakité (Diawara 85′), M. Diakhaby, J. Jeanvier, I. Sylla, I.M, A. Touré, M. Guilavogui (Keita 76’), A. Camara, S. Sylla (F. Conte 76’), M. Bayo

First 45’: Guinea dominated possession and showed promising signs in the attack in the first half. Both teams tried to break the deadlock to no avail but Guinea looked the more convincing side. The first half ended goalless as both teams went into the break with the optimism to score in the second half.




Second 45’: Guinea continued to make more shots on goal and kept possession as Gambia struggled to find their feet. Eventually in the 70th minute, Aguibou Camara took advantage of a defensive error and made the score 1-0. Gambia were unable to equalise and ultimately lost the match.




What’s next: Guinea will be looking forward to their next fixture against Group C leaders Senegal as they continue their quest to qualify for the next round. Gambia will play against Cameroon in their next match, who will be looking for a positive result after a disappointing start to the tournament.
