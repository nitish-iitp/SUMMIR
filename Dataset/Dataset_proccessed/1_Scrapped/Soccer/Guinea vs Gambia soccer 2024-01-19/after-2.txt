How is Guinea doing?

Guinea comes from drawing one goal against Cameroon. After 90 minutes full of intensity, where Francois Kamano received the red card, Mohamed Bayo scored the goal for Guinea and Cameroon tied it at 51 through Frank Magri. A victory would help them be second, because if Cameroon loses they would take second place in the group.

How is Gambia doing?

Gambia has just lost to Senegal by 3 goals to 0. With a great display from Lamine Camara and Pape Gueye. They even got the red card due to the work of Ebou Adams. Matchday 2 will be of utmost importance, a defeat would send them out of the tournament, a victory would be necessary, because a draw would leave them with great chances of elimination.
