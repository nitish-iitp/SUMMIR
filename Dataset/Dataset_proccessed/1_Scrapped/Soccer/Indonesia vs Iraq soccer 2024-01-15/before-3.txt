JAKARTA - Good news includes the Indonesian national team ahead of the inaugural Group D match of the 2023 Asian Cup against Iraq on January 15, 2024. The Mesopotamian Lions team, nicknamed Iraq, actually lost their mainstay defenders.

Saad Natiq has been absent for the past three days in Iraqi training sessions. Even so, Iraqi Manager Mehdi Karim denied the 29-year-old defender was seriously injured.

However, it is reported that the Iraqi coach, Jesus Casas, will not field the defender who plays at the Saudi Arabian club, Abha FC, against the Indonesian national team.

Launching Winwin on Friday, January 12, 2024, it is known that Jesus Casas did not want to take the risk to continue playing Natiq which was not 100 percent fit when he met the Garuda Squad.

That's because Iraq still has to face a stronger opponent, namely Japan, in the second match of Group D, January 19, 2024.

"In the Iraq vs Indonesia match, Casas will lose his professional defender Saad Natiq who suffered a muscle injury and has been absent from training for three days," wrote Winwin's narration.

"Although he received assurances from the medical team that Natiq will be able to train in the next 48 hours, Casas will not take any risks."

"He wants Natiq to be fully prepared for the second match against Japan," the statement continued.

"Casas will only use players who are 100 percent ready for the Indonesia vs Iraq match, especially important matches are usually important for a team."

"Moreover, he has to look at the next match better. Therefore, changes in players from match to game can happen," Winwin wrote.

Indonesia vs Iraq's match is a very important match for both teams. Shin Tae-yong's Garuda squad must achieve at least a draw to open up opportunities for qualifying for the last 16 of the 2023 Asian Cup through the best third-placed line.

Meanwhile, Iraq must win over Indonesia in order to go lighter because it will fight Japan and Vietnam in its last two matches.

The Indonesia vs Iraq national team match will be held at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, Ar Rayyan on Monday, January 15.
