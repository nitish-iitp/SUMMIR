It was a game some 56 years in the making and for Hong Kong, no matter the outcome, a moment of which to be proud.

The city’s team returned to Asian Cup finals for the first time since 1968, and started their campaign on Sunday with a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Group C rivals the United Arab Emirates.

Jorn Andersen’s side are the lowest ranked team in the competition, but still pushed their Middle East opponents all the way, and but for a couple of harsh penalty decisions and some luck could well have caused an upset.

There was plenty of evidence to suggest Hong Kong aren’t just there to make up the numbers, and if the Asian Games taught us anything, it’s that Andersen knows how to prepare a team for the big day. A place in the next stage is not beyond the realms of possibility.
