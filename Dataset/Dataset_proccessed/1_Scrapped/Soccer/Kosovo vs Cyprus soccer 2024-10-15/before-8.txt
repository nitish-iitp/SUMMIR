EURO 2025 (U-17): UKRAINE CLAIMS SECOND VICTORY IN ROUND 1 AND ADVANCES EARLY FROM THE GROUP

12.10.2024 16:56

In the second match of the EURO 2025 (U-17) Round 1, Ukraine's U-17 team (players born no later than 2008) faced Kazakhstan.

In the opening game of the qualifying mini-tournament in Belgium, Yuriy Moroz's squad won a hard-fought 4:2 win over Kosovo. Today, they faced Kazakhstan in Eupen.

The first half saw the Blue and Yellows dominate possession, creating numerous chances, but the ball stubbornly refused to find the back of the net. Shots from Zalypka, Melnyk, Zudin, and Lyusin either missed the target or were brilliantly saved by Kazakhstan’s goalkeeper.

The second half started similarly, but everything changed in the 69th minute. Ukraine delivered a blistering four-minute spell. First, Ivan Andreyko opened the scoring, followed by a second from Arsen Zalypka three minutes later, and then Muhammad Dzhurabaiev added a third just one minute after that.

Following these quick strikes, Ukraine calmly saw out the match for a 3:0 victory. With Belgium also winning their match against Kosovo, Ukraine secured early qualification for the next round.

Ukraine’s final game in the EURO 2025 (U-17) qualifiers will be against Belgium on October 15.
