I will never stop beating the drum 
 of the truth in my community ~Twic Mayardit.
...........................…...................................
Iam writing and appealing to my people ~Twic Mayardit living in the Juba city of South Sudan. I would like to put some few remarks on the below 
 two documents.
Allowed me to talk on the first document issued by #TMPT's technical committee concerning the complaint of Pan -nyok Payam football team against Turalei Payam football team and the case was put before the technical committee.
My dear people, football association or body is the one of the department guided by the rules and regulations all over the global. Any mistake done or committed within their activities is always justify by the rules and regulations.
Let's first identify the mistake done by the player of Turalei football team and refer it to the rules and regulations. The issue of two yellow 
 cards given to any player in the difference matches played is very clear and easy to be handled.
In any football 
 match on live,referees are the only one responsible for that match and both administration of the teams are also observing the mistake or the punishment given to their players by the referees.
The administration of Turalei football team have to know who's that player has red card,one yellow cards, two yellow cards among their players and verify them before the next match.
What do the rules and regulations say about the player who received red card, one yellow,two yellow cards before the next match is played. Let's give room for the peace and unity. #TMPT became most enjoyable tournament more than Twic Olympic Association #TOA.
Dear technical committee, you're not much to be advised because you're the technical body doing the technical jobs in the football 
 activities. You have solved Pan -nyok Payam complaint and you ruled out three points for them according to the rules and regulations.
Turalei football team has condemned and rejected the decision and justification you have made. Please recall them back again for more convenient through peaceful means of understanding. Involved other technical body within the association of Juba for more help and witness.
Thank you very much for the consideration and understanding of this note advice. May the Living God bless the #TMPT and bless Twic Mayardit in general
