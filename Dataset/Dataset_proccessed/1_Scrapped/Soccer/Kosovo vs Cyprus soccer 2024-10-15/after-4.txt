Kosovo

Kosovars are Romania's only rivals for the top spot in the group, but the team made the chase much more difficult. At home, Kosovo lost 0:3 to Romania. Kosovars won the other two matches - 4:0 away to Cyprus and 2:1 to Lithuania - and actually booked at least the second place in the quartet.

Cyprus

The Cypriots have a different goal - not to drop to the last place and not to leave the C division. So far, the team won the most important match in this fight for survival - 1:0 away to Lithuania. In other matches Cyprus lost - 0:4 at home to Kosovo and 0:3 at home to Romania.

Expert Betting Tips

In this group everything is very clear. There are two favorites - Romania and Kosovo, and two outsiders - Cyprus and Lithuania. So far there have been no sensations, so we bet on the favorite in the upcoming game. Both the Romanians in the match with Lithuania and the Kosovars in the game with the Cyprots will surely win and continue the race for the leadership in the group.
