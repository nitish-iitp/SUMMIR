India vs Vietnam Live Score: FULL-TIME, HONOURS SHARED

India vs Vietnam Live Score: And that is all after a Vietnam free-kick leads to nothing! An entertaining back-and-forth match, but it ends all even as neither team quite succeeded in finding that second goal.

Still no result for Manolo Marquez, but plenty to take away for the Blue Tigers from this match in Nam Dinh, as it ends 1-1.

Oct 12, 2024 6:24 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: One last chance for India but can't convert!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Golden opportunity for India to steal away the match in the fifth minute of injury time! Liston Colaco runs in on goal with one teammate on his right and another on his left. He decides not to pass and that's perhaps the wrong decision, as a great opportunity is blocked by a defender.

Oct 12, 2024 6:18 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: 6 minutes of injury time

India vs Vietnam Live Score: 6 minutes for India to hang on, with Vietnam looking the more likely to find a winner now. Can the Blue Tigers find a chance on the counter-attack?

Oct 12, 2024 6:15 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Two more big saves by Gurpreet

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Vietnam knocking on the door. A good flat corner is fired at goal, but Gurpreet can get behind it and hold on. A few moments later, a shot from range bobbles dangerously in front of him, but he does well to keep his wits and push it away for nothing more than a corner.

1-1, 87'

Oct 12, 2024 6:11 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: GOAL-LINE CLEARANCE BY ANWAR ALI!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: WOW! Vietnam finally finding their first half-form, as they work the ball around superbly to create what looks to be a certain goal. However, Anwar Ali is present at the right place at the right time to head it off the line. India hanging on by a thread as Vietnam regain their footing!

Oct 12, 2024 6:09 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Sharp save from Gurpreet!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: India find themselves short-staffed at the back as Vietnam counter-attack up the pitch, and a square ball into the box is met by Quan Hai once again. His shot is on target this time, but too central. Gurpreet sticks a hand out and turns it over the crossbar.

Colaco and Vikram Partap also on to add some pace to the frontline. 1-1, 81'

Oct 12, 2024 6:04 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Vietnam nearly generate something from nothing!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Out of nowhere, Vietnam generate a huge chance for themselves! They work it around well in and around the box, before substitute Nguyen Quan Hai unleashed a lethal-looking left-footed shot across goal. Gurpreet can only watch and breathe a sigh of relief at it flashes past his far post. A warning for India with 15 minutes left in the game.

1-1, 76'

Oct 12, 2024 5:58 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: India keeping Vietnam quiet as Farukh subbed off

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Farukh Choudhary earns another corner for India, and earns a breather right after. His name is on the board, as Edmund Lalrindika comes on to replace him after a terrific shift leading the line.

India's defence has been much more staunch in this half, not letting their hosts generate chances with the ease of the first 45. Lots of positives to take from this second half performance so far with 20 minutes to play.

1-1, 70'

Oct 12, 2024 5:53 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: India close to taking the lead!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: India playing some very good football now! Brandon wraps a pacy pass into the feet of Chhangte, playing more centrally in this second half. He looks up and finds himself in a pocket of space, and chips through a dinked pass for Farukh. It is an inch away from being a very similar finish to his first, but is just beyond his reach.

India in the ascendancy. 1-1, 64'

Oct 12, 2024 5:47 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: India dominating now, looking much-improved

India vs Vietnam Live Score: A much better start to the second half by the Blue Tigers, as Roshan nearly manages to squeeze in a square pass for Chhangte, forced away for a corner.

A couple of substitutions for the hosts, looking slightly nervous as India have grown into this game.

1-1, 59'

Oct 12, 2024 5:42 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: FARUKH EQUALISES! IT'S 1-1 WITH. A DELICIOUS LOB

India vs Vietnam Live Score: India find their goal! Suresh with a sublim long ball over the top, Farukh outmuscles the Vietnam defender, and finds himself 1v1 with the goalkeeper. With the goalie charging, Farukh coolly lobs the ball over his head, and is off celebrating even before it's in the net. What a moment and what a well-taken goal!

1-1, 54'

Oct 12, 2024 5:39 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Chance for India but Chhangte can't find the cross!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Golden chance for India as Chhangte is released down the wing. He does well to run speedily into space, but his cross is weak and behind Farukh.

Vietnam can't clear, however, and Chhangte regains the ball. He slides in a through all successfully for Farukh this time, but the striker gets it caught in his feet and doesn't release a shot.

India need to try and convert the few chances they are creating!

0-0, 50'

Oct 12, 2024 5:34 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: SECOND HALF BEGINS

India vs Vietnam Live Score: 45 minutes for India to get back into it. No changes at half-time from either team.

Oct 12, 2024 5:19 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: HALF-TIME, HOSTS LEAD 1-0

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Vietnam were much the stronger side in the first half, generating plenty of shots and troubling Gurpreet. In all honesty, could and should have had more to show for this performance so far.

India had some bright moments, but were lacklustre defensively and second-best to too many situations in their own half. They will need to shore up their play in the second half if they want to get back into it.

Oct 12, 2024 5:16 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: India create a chance but can't get a shot off!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Suresh creates a sudden turnover in the Vietnam half, and slides through Chhangte on the right side of the box. He is too slow with the ball though, and is dispossessed in a golden area for India!

India ending the half with some decent football.

0-1, 44'

Oct 12, 2024 5:11 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Vietnam take the lead!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: India's defence finally gives way! Bui latches on to and volleys a powerful shot at goal from the edge of the box. It takes a deflection, and Gurpreet gets a leg to it. However, Hoang Duc is there to poach a simple tap-in on the line. The Golden Star Warriors have certainly earned this opening goal.

1-0 for Vietnam, 39 minutes played.

Oct 12, 2024 5:08 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: India midfield continues to be overrun

India vs Vietnam Live Score: The hosts finding it too easy to generate space and chances in the final third, either with passes in behind, switches of play, or quick passing moves through midfield. Something Marquez will need to look at in the interval.

Oct 12, 2024 5:04 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Ngoc Quang comes close for Vietnam

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Incredible half-turn on the edge of the box by Ngoc Quan, who finds room on his left foot and tries to curl it into the side netting. A very small deflection according to the referee, taking it agonisingly wide. The hosts playing very well.

0-0, 34'

Oct 12, 2024 5:02 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: India's defence struggling against Vietnam's pace

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Vietnam finding it far too easy to release their frontline behind India's defence, consistently winning duels and races up the pitch, with striker Bui in particular making it an uncomfortable evening so far.

Freekick out wide for Vietnam, which Gurpreet punches clear.

Oct 12, 2024 4:59 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Farukh with another chance, strong save by Filip

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Nearly 1-0 for India! Cheap giveaway at the back by the hosts. Farukh Chaudhury combines Brandon Fernandes before taking a snapshot at the near-post from a tight angle. Strong save with his boot by the Vietnamese keeper.

0-0, 28'

Oct 12, 2024 4:54 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Van Toan spurns another chance

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Right wingback To Van Vu picks up a big long ball down the wing, and finds Van Toan with a beautifully created reverse pass in a crossing opportunity. With two men in the box for him, the number nine overhits it and spurns another golden chance for a Vietnam lead.

0-0, 23'

Oct 12, 2024 4:49 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Vietnam come close! Narrowly wide

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Van Toan with another strong run down the inside-right channel to create some space in the box, but his low shot slices wide.

Seconds later, the same player finds a tiny pocket of space surrounded by four Indian defenders, but manages to release another strong shot, this time past the other post. Warning signs for India with the hosts finding too much space.

0-0, 19'

Oct 12, 2024 4:47 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: Smooth move from India, looking high in confidence

India vs Vietnam Live Score: A swift play to work their way up the pitch from the Indian right hand-side, as quick one-touch passing and off-ball runs allow the team to generate some space. Chhangte nearly whips in a great pass for Farukh, but the linesman says the ball was out of play.

Oct 12, 2024 4:43 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: PENALTY FOR VIETNAM… GURPREET SAVES!!!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Vietnam gain a penalty after a clumsy shove in the box by Rahul Bheke, who upturns the Vietnam attacker and conceded a spot-kick.

It is captain Que Ngoc Hai who steps up, but it is a poor penalty, and Gurpreet guesses correctly, even hanging on to the football! Big moment!

Still 0-0, 13'

Oct 12, 2024 4:40 PM IST
India vs Vietnam Live Score: FARUKH WITH A SHOT ON TARGET!

India vs Vietnam Live Score: Farukh with his first India cap in 3 years, and it's nearly a moment of magic! He picks up the ball and nutmegs a Vietnam centreback, before releasing a stinging left-footed shot low to the keeper Filip's left. It's a solid save but an excellent piece of play by Farukh to precede it. Bright start.

0-0, 9:32
