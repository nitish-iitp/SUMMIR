European champions Spain weren't on their best form yet again as they struggled to create chances throughout the match against a well-set-up Denmark. However, it was through a Kasper Schmeichel mistake in the Danish goal that Spain got their winning goal on the night to leapfrog into the lead of their Nations League group.

Luis de la Fuente's men looked lethargic in possession through the first half of the crucial group stage clash as the defending Nations League champions seemed to struggle to pierce through the Danish defence despite Fabian Ruiz's best efforts in midfield. Schmeichel kept Denmark in the game though through a couple of saves before half-time.

While Spain seemed to kick into second gear after the break, they were still struggling to create much threat against Denmark's goal as teenager Lamine Yamal struggled to show off his typical form from the right. However, Zubimendi was able to break the deadlock with a perfect volley which was fumbled by Schmeichel into his own goal to give Spain the win on the night.

THE MVP

Ruiz was the major standout on a rather dull afternoon for both sides as Denmark and Spain seemed to struggle to find their feet at the Estadio Nueva Condomina. Ruiz managed to bypass the Danish midfield multiple times for La Roja but a struggling Alvaro Morata and Yamal were unable to capitalise on the chances.

THE BIG LOSER

Yamal was not nearly as effective for De la Fuente against Denmark as he looked to struggle from the demands of the never-ending football calendar. The Barcelona starlet could have given Spain the lead in the first half after going through on goal against Schmeichel but skied his chip attempt over the former Leicester goalkeeper. Victor Kristiansen and Victor Nelsson kept the 17-year-old far from goal at all times, leaving him unable to create any more threat until the Spain number 10 was hooked off near full-time.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Spain will now face off against Serbia on October 15 in the fourth match of the group stage and a win on the night will see they safely qualify for the knockout stages of the competition.
