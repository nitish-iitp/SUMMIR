How to Watch Spain vs. Denmark: Stream UEFA Nations League Live, TV Channel

European champion Spain is surprisingly playing catch-up to UEFA Nations League leader Denmark when the teams collide.

Spain finds itself in an unexpected position as the reigning champion of the continent finds itself looking to leapfrog UEFA Nations League rival Denmark when the teams face off on Saturday. The Danes have compiled a perfect two wins from two thus far in Group A4 of the competition and are already two points ahead of La Roja, which opened its campaign with a 0-0 stalemate in Serbia. Victory in Murcia would peg Spain back even further and put Denmark firmly in the driver’s seat entering the home stretch, but a first win on Spanish soil since 1979 is required in order to do so.

The last four meetings between these teams have each gone in favour of Spain, though it’s been 16 years since the nations last met in any setting.

Xabi Alonso bagged a goal either side of Barcelona icon Xavi converting in that most recent 2008 matchup, seeing out a dominant 3-0 win for Spain in a year that they also happened to win the Euros:

That could be a positive omen heading into this weekend’s encounter, which will see Luis de la Fuente’s side seek to extend their 12-match undefeated streak.

Denmark has dusted itself off since exiting Euro 2024’s last 16 at the hands of host Germany, embarking on a two-win streak to open its Nations League quest in confident fashion.

That being said, a first away trip of the tournament doesn’t get a lot harder than flying south to Spain, who will be eager to restore order and move to the Group A4 summit for the first time.

Regional restrictions may apply.
