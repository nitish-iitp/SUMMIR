SPA – DEN: H2H

This will be the first meeting between Spain and Denmark. The Red Fury won the Nations League in 2023, and the bookmakers in Spain are listing them as a top favorite for the World Cup 2026, while the Danish team are yet to reach the Nations League finals.

Standings	Group A4 Teams	Matches Played	Points
1	Denmark	2	6
2	Spain	2	4
3	Serbia	2	1
4	Switzerland	2	0

Spain and Denmark have been convincing so far, and they should make it to the playoffs ahead of Switzerland and Serbia. The Swiss team has lost their first two games of the Nations League and their goal will be to avoid an automatic relegation. The top-two clash will be the most interesting in this group, although the Spain vs Denmark odds suggest a big advantage for La Roja.

BETTING PREVIEW: LATEST RESULTS AND ROSTER UPDATES
SPAIN NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM

Spain’s last defeat in a competitive game was more than a year ago – a 2-0 loss against Scotland in the European Championship qualifiers. The Red Fury went on to win the EURO 2024 Championship, beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France, and England to become European Champions. Their focus returns to the Nations League, where they have one draw and one win from their first two games, with the most recent being a 4-1 thrashing of Switzerland last month.

Luis de la Fuente will be missing some big names for this clash as Dani Carvajal joins Rodrigo Cascante on the sidelines until the end of the season. Ferran Torres is also ruled out for a month but the Spanish team has a lot of options in attack.

DENMARK NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM

The Danish Dynamites secured two consecutive 2-0 wins against Switzerland and Serbia, but they are still heavy underdogs on the best bookies in Denmark. Lars Knudsen’s team picked up three draws in three group-stage games at the EURO 2024, which was enough to see them reach the knockouts, but they were beaten 2-0 by Germany in the last 16. Denmark is top of their Nations League group and even a draw against Spain would be a good result for the visitors.

Jannik Vestergaard has played just two games for Leicester City and he is a doubt for the game against Spain this weekend. Yussuf Poulsen started in the 2-0 win against Serbia, but we could see some fresh energy like Kasper Dolberg in attack.

Luis de la Fuente has made a good start to his career as the manager of the Spain national team, winning the Nations League and European Championship, and taking his team to third on the FIFA rankings. Spain has won four of their last five matches, and they were able to beat Switzerland 4-1 despite receiving an early red card. Denmark isn’t a very good side away from home, and their only away wins in the last year were against Finland and San Marino. The Red Fury had a good squad and with the home advantage, a big home win is a good option on Spain vs Denmark predictions.

Lamine Yamal is one of the best creators in Europe and he already has five assists for Barcelona in the league this season. This is Spain’s biggest game of the group stage and the young winger loves to play in these kinds of games. Lamine Yamal has two assists in his last three games for the national team and he can be a valuable bet on Spain vs Denmark betting tips.

Spain has assembled one of the most efficient attacks in European football, and they have scored 10 goals in their last five matches. Four of their last five games have ended with over 2.5 goals, and we could be on for another high-scoring game here. Denmark has improved in attack, scoring twice in each of their last two games, and they could get along the goals here. A bet on this game to end with over 2.5 goals is a good offer on Spain vs Denmark betting predictions.
