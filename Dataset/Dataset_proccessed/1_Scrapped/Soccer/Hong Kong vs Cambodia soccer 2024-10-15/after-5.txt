Englishman Westwood had joked that Hong Kong Stadium would be in for a bumper crowd if all the people who wanted to voice their dislike for him showed up, after last week’s defeat by Liechtenstein.

As it transpired, only 5,289 paid through the gates and, save for a few boos when Westwood’s name was announced before kick-off, those who turned up gave vociferous and unstinting backing for their team.

In return, they received bang for their buck, as the hosts comprehensively outplayed a flimsy, compliant Cambodia team.

Asked before the game whether he viewed facing world No 180 team Cambodia as a chance to end his wait for a Hong Kong goal, Matt Orr bristled slightly as he pointed out he had scored in both his side’s matches last month.

Orr did, however, treat the fans to a long-awaited strike at home with his third in four international games, following a barren 20-match run. His 29th-minute goal gave Hong Kong a lead their superiority deserved.
