As Guinea gear up for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament, the Syli National are determined to rewrite their AFCON history with a strong showing against top-notch African teams.

Despite facing group stage exits in numerous AFCON appearances, totalling 14, Guinea’s memorable runner-up finish in 1976 fuels their ambition for success in Ivory Coast. Their best-ever campaign in 1976 showed promise, with a string of impressive performances against Egypt, Ethiopia, and Uganda in the group stage. Although falling short of clinching the trophy, Guinea gave their competitors a run for their money.

Notable achievements between 2004 and 2008 saw Guinea reach the quarter-finals in three consecutive editions. In the upcoming tournament, Guinea faces formidable opponents like Senegal and Cameroon, aiming to surprise critics and surpass expectations, aspiring to progress beyond the knockout stages. As the tournament unfolds, Guinea’s football enthusiasts eagerly anticipate a spirited performance that could redefine the nation’s AFCON legacy.

2023 AFCON Matches:

15 January 2024: Cameroon vs Guinea
