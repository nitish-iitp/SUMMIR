The Indomitable Lions of Cameroon have solidified their status as a football powerhouse in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), ranking as the second most successful side. Their influence extends globally, being the first African team to reach the World Cup quarterfinals in 1990.

Despite a group stage exit in their AFCON debut in 1970, Cameroon swiftly rebounded, securing third place in the subsequent edition. The turning point arrived in 1984 when they clinched their maiden title, defeating Nigeria 3-1 in the final.

A setback in 1986 against Egypt was followed by a triumphant return to dominance in 1988, defeating Nigeria once again in the final. After a brief decline, Cameroon staged a remarkable comeback in 2000, securing their third title by overcoming co-hosts Nigeria 4-3 on penalties. They defended their crown in Mali in 2002, defeating Senegal in another penalty shootout, becoming joint record-holders with Ghana and Egypt at the time, each boasting four trophies.

In 2017, Cameroon secured their fifth trophy, triumphing over Ghana and Senegal in the knockout stages, before a dramatic 2-1 comeback victory against Egypt in the final.

Despite finishing third as hosts in the last edition, Cameroon showcased exceptional performances, with Vincent Aboubakar earning the Golden Boot for his eight goals. As they aim for a sixth title, the Indomitable Lions aspire to build on their legacy of dominance and triumph in the upcoming AFCON.

2023 AFCON Fixtures:

15 January 2024: Cameroon vs Guinea
19 January 2024: Senegal vs Cameroon
23 January 2024: Gambia vs Cameroon

Key Players to Watch:

Vincent Aboubakar (Captain): The Besiktas forward stands as a pivotal figure in Cameroon’s pursuit of AFCON glory. His decisive goal in the 2017 AFCON final played a crucial role in securing the title. The 31-year-old is set to lead the charge in his fourth AFCON appearance.
André Onana: The Manchester United goalkeeper returns to the national team after a brief hiatus, signalling his readiness to contribute to Cameroon’s quest for a sixth AFCON title. Onana has been a stalwart presence between the posts.
Karl Toko Ekambi: The striker, gearing up for his fourth AFCON appearance, is poised to be a go-to striker for the Indomitable Lions. With a wealth of experience, Ekambi’s contributions were evident in the 2021 tournament, where he scored five goals.

Coach: Rigobert Song: Former Cameroon defender Rigobert Song, now the coach, aims to guide the team to another AFCON triumph. After managing the local-based national team and the U-23 side, Song led Cameroon to the 2022 World Cup but faced challenges progressing from the group stage. The 47-year-old, part of the team that won back-to-back AFCON titles in 2000 and 2002, hopes to achieve similar success as a coach.

Team Statistics:

Appearances: 20
Best Results: Champions in 1984, 1988, 2000, 2002, and 2017
Worst Results: Group Stage in 1970, 1982, 1990, 1996, and 2015
Most capped player: Rigobert Song with 137 appearances
Captain: Vincent Aboubakar

The AFCON tournament will start on January 13, 2024 and conclude on February 11.
