After their training session at the South field of the National Polytechnic Institute Houphouet Boigny on Thursday, players of Cameroon senior men’s national team were in a joyful mood heading to their hotel.

Players and officials sang and were in a jubilant mood.

Amid around 50 accredited journalists who covered the first 15 minutes of their training, Vincent Aboubakar and his teammates took advantage of the second day of training to perfect coach Rigobert Song’s directives.

The Indomitable Lions will open their campaign at AFCON 2023 against Guinea on January 15, 2024.

The clash is expected to take place at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium, Yamussoukro.

The Central African side will train behind closed doors in Yamussoukro.

The training session will be held between 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm.

It will take place 72 hours before their opener against Guinea.

Song’s side will also face holders, Senegal and Gambia in Group C.
