The Cameroon Football Federation, FECAFOOT, has confirmed that, the captain of the Indomitable lions of Cameroon, Vincent Aboubakar is injured but can still play in this Africa Cup of Nations that opens this January 13, 2024, in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire.

In the Press Release made public by the team, it was revealed that Vincent Aboubakar during training on January 12, 2024 in Yamoussoukro felt a pain in his left thigh.

In an MRI conducted on January 13, 2024, it was discovered that the player is suffering from from a slight grade 1 musculo-aponeurotic detachment, which according to the medical team is a minor injury and cannot affect the players participation in the competition.

The Press Release also indicates that Vincent Aboubakar who is the most experienced player in the squad will continue training under the supervision of the medical team.

Tongues have been wagging in Cameroon as many had considered that Aboubakar will not be able to take part in the competition.

However, the press release indicates that Vincent Aboubakar maintains high spirits and has a determined mindset as he is ready to rigorously follow treatment protocols to join his teammates and defend the colors of Cameroon in the competition.

Cameroon gets into action on Monday January 15, 2024, against Guinea.
