THE EXPLANATION

Mbappe, the star of the PSG project, has historically faced hostile responses in the Velodrome, given the intense rivalry between his club and Marseille. Both he and the rest of Les Bleus' Parisian contingent are set to receive nothing less this evening - despite wearing the colours of the national team.

WHAT MBAPPE SAID

In a press conference, Mbappe admitted it might be an uncomfortable evening: "If I am not whistled, I will be pleasantly surprised. I know very well that I am not on conquered territory there! But I don't have a problem with it, I don't take it personally. I understand too. Even if it's the selection, I remain a PSG player, I don't expect the red carpet to be rolled out for me. They know very well that this is not going to change the way I play."
