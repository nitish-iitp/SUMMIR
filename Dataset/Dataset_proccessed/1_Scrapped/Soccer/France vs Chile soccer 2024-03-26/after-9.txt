Arsenal's Saliba not yet ready to start for France - Deschamps

France manager Didier Deschamps has said Arsenal defender William Saliba needs to iron out some kinks in his game before he can be brought into France's starting lineup.

Saliba, 23, has started in six of his 12 appearances for France but was left on the bench during their 2-0 home defeat to Germany in a friendly on Saturday, though he is expected to feature in Tuesday's friendly against Chile.

Dayot Upamecano, Ibrahima Konaté, and Benjamin Pavard have been given the nod ahead of Saliba in recent games, with the defenders also contending for a spot on France's Euro 2024 squad.

"Saliba is playing a good season [with Arsenal]," Deschamps told reporters on Monday. "But I see him alternating things which I like a bit less. With the French national team, he gets less playing time.

"When he has got some, it hasn't always gone well. I'm aware that I put him in a context that wasn't always easy. The current pecking order doesn't favour him, but he's there. He'll get some game time on Tuesday."

Saliba has started all 28 of Arsenal's Premier League games so far this season, with Mikel Arteta's team boasting the best defence in the division.
