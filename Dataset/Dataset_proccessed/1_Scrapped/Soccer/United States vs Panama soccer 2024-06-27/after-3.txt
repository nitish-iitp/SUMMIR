A drama-filled Group C match ended with a 2-1 Panama win over the United States — and the USMNT suddenly has a tough road to avoid elimination from the 2024 Copa América that they host.

The United States played undermanned for most of the match after Tim Weah was shown a red card after shoving a Panama player in the head in the 18th minute. Folarin Balogun opened the scoring with a beautiful strike from the corner of the box, only for Panama to equalize less than four minutes later. After a stalemate for much of the second half, Panama scored the eventual winning goal on a short José Fajardo shot in the 83rd minute.

The U.S. now faces an uphill battle to qualify for the knockout stage, likely needing a win against Group C favorite Uruguay on Monday.
