GAME NOTES | FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT PANAMA

USMNT Starting XI Cap Numbers (including this match): Christian Pulisic (70), Tim Ream (60), Weston McKennie (55), Antonee Robinson (45), Matt Turner (43), Tyler Adams (41), Tim Weah (41), Gio Reyna (30), Chris Richards (20), Folarin Balogun (14), Joe Scally (13).

USMNT Starting XI Cap Numbers in Official Competition (including this match): Christian Pulisic (49), Matt Turner (33), Weston McKennie (32), Tim Ream (31), Antonee Robinson (29), Tyler Adams (23), Tim Weah (21), Gio Reyna (18), Chris Richards (11), Folarin Balogun (8), Joe Scally (7).

Today’s Starting XI has an average age of 25 years, 343 days.

The Starting XI’s average of 23 caps in official competition is the highest number under Gregg Berhalter. The lineup also averages 38.3 caps overall.

Berhalter starts the same XI that faced Bolivia on Sunday night. It’s the first time he has started the same lineup in back-to-back matches since the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup Quarterfinal and Semifinal against Jamaica and Qatar, respectively.

The backline of Antonee Robinson, Tim Ream, Chris Richards and Joe Scally start together for the fourth-straight match, marking the first time since the 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup the USMNT has used the same back four in four consecutive matches.

Nearly 14 years after making his international debut, veteran defender Tim Ream earns his 50th start in his 60th cap for the USMNT.

Midfielder Tyler Adams starts back-to-back matches for the first time since the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Christian Pulisic becomes the seventh player to captain the USMNT 25 times. The USA is 17W-3L-4D when Pulisic wears the armband.

Pulisic’s four career goals against Panama are tied for the most all-time among USMNT players, joining Jozy Altidore, Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan and Eddie Johnson. The attacker tallied the opening goal in a 4-0 World Cup qualifying win on Oct. 6, 2017 and then put home a hat trick in the team’s 5-1 qualifying win on May 27, 2022.

Tonight’s match marks the 10th time the forward trio of Folarin Balogun, Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah will start together. Through their first nine matches starting together, the three players have combined for 19 goal contributions (12 goals, 7 assists), and have had at least one player involved in 14 of the 23 goals scored by the USMNT in that time.

Midfielder Gio Reyna has six goal contributions (two goals, four assists) in his last five appearances against Concacaf opposition.

Reyna also tallied his first international goal against Panama, scoring in the 18th minute of the USA’s 6-2 win on Nov. 16, 2020 in Wiener Neustadt, Austria.

Chris Richards also made his debut in the 2020 friendly against Panama.

CAUTION WATCH: Midfielder Weston McKennie carries a yellow card into this match. Should he receive another tonight, he would serve a one-game suspension in next Monday’s group finale against Uruguay.

Gregg Berhalter is 44W-15L-13D in 72 matches as USMNT head coach and 29W-7L-7D in 43 matches in official competition.

The USMNT is 17W-2L-7D all-time against Panama and 13W-2L-7D against La Marea Roja in matches in official competition. After Mexico, Panama is the USA’s second-most common opponent since 2010, with tonight’s match marking the 19th meeting in the last 14 years.

A U.S. win tonight against Panama combined with a Uruguay win or draw against Bolivia would see the USMNT advance to the 2024 Copa América Quarterfinals.

Five substitutions are allowed in three different moments. Halftime does not count as a substitution moment.

Tonight’s match will be officiated by Iván Barton of El Salvador. This is the seventh USMNT match Mr. Barton has officiated with the USA going 5W-0L-1D in the previous six. His last three U.S. matches include the 2-0 World Cup Qualifying win against Mexico on Nov. 12, 2021, the 5-1 World Cup Qualifying win against Panama on March 27, 2022, and the 3-0 Concacaf Nations League Semifinal win against Mexico on June 15, 2023.
