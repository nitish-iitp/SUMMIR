TRANSFER NEWS AND RUMORS
John Textor: I’ll submit offer for Thiago Almada on Tuesday
Sydney Hunte6 Months Ago773 Mins

John Textor, the owner of Brazilian side Botafogo — as well as Lyon and Crystal Palace — went on the record on Tuesday morning in the wake of reports that his Eagle Football Group had already agreed terms with Atlanta United on a transfer.

Cesar Luis Merlo said late Monday evening that a verbal agreement was in place for “close to $20 million” that will see Almada sign for Botafogo ahead of a future transfer to one of Textor’s European clubs. Merlo on Saturday reported that talks were in “advanced” stages, with Garth Lagerwey denying any conversation between him and Eagle Football Club “in several months”.

In an exclusive conversation with insider Thiago Franklin on Tuesday, Textor denied an agreement was in place, but confirmed that he will submit an offer that day and reach out to Lagerwey to discuss.

“Cesar Merlo, I’m sure he’s a nice guy, just has it wrong. I haven’t made an offer yet.” Textor said. “I think a lot of journalists are trying to get in front of the story. Maybe they anticipate that we’re going to get a deal done.”

Textor mentioned that he enjoyed speaking with Almada’s family, as well as his relationship with Atlanta United’s leadership.

“We’re doing this the right way,” he added.

There’s certainly interest, and there has been for a while, but as of this writing, no agreement’s been made. But things seem to be heating up: we’ll wait to see what offer Textor and his group makes for the services of Almada. It probably won’t be the $30 million+ many surmised last season, but it won’t be for nothing, either. Stay tuned.

If it wasn't already official, I think this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLBOG4WXMAM makes it 99.999999999% that this deal goes through. I mean they post this video the day before what would be his last game in an ATL shirt. I mean this would be there way of saying goodbye to him and bidding him farewell. This documentary was really good and towards the end I was really fighting back tears. I mean I think I am going to start preparing for this transfer in my heart and in my soul. Goodbye Thiago, you have been one of the best Atlanta United players in our history and I am very thankful for your service. Remember us when you are a star on the world stage! Gracias Thiago!!!

Kind of… From what I can tell, final negotiations are still going on (for Atlanta’s sake praying that something falls through) and he isn’t officially gone yet as he is also available this Saturday. But tbh he more than likely is. I would say this deal is 95% going to go through.

On Copa America x World Cup
Sorry to chang the subject for a second, but one thing that is having repercussion during Copa America is the fact that many games are played in NFL stadiuns, poorly adapted to our game, and that many fields are too small – mininum size allowed – which is really harming the games for lack of space.
Are these stadiums going to be used for the World Cup? I don´t believe that FIFA is as weak as Conmebol, to accept these structures. But I remember that your field was replaced by grass just two days before the Argentina game, which is crazy.

I read earlier that the stadiums will have to be adjusted for World Cup games. Metlife Stadium in NY/NJ is spending $16 million to get theirs to regulation. There will be a longer lead-in time for the WC too, however I expect teams to complain about the grass because that is what they do.

Disclaimer for this post *** Transfermarkt is not necessarily reliable on a player-by-player basis due to their highly subjective valuation process but can be an intriguing tool for comparing perceived valuations of clubs within their leagues ***

With that said, this roster with Giakoumakis and Almada on it is valued at 2nd in the league behind Miami (95.78 million euros) with a value of 63.25 million euros. Without Almada and Giakoumakis, Atlanta is worth 28.25 million euros which puts us in the bottom 3 between Sporting KC at 28.33 million and DC United at 24.03 million. Without Almada and Gregersen, the most valuable players based on Transfermarkt’s metric are Almada and Slisz at 5 million, Saba and Abram at 3 million, and Lennon at 2.5 million.

What does this tell y’all about underperforming/overperforming this season?

Tommy has talked recently about how much change could come to this team by the start of 2025. That is very true with players like Guzan, McCarty, Westburg, Hernandez, McFadden, Ibarra, and Sosa all on expiring contracts this winter and Abram, Cohen, Lennon, Mosquera, Silva, and Williams all entering the final year of their guaranteed contracts in 2025 (not counting option years for some).

With another expansion draft this December for San Diego, we could potentially lose another player there. The rules for the last draft in 2022 protected all Homegrown and Generation Adidas players under the age of 25 plus an additional 12 players on each roster. Based on who could realistically be retained from the current group, I made a list of 10 protected players with 2 open spots for summer signings.

Cohen
Gregersen
Lennon
Lobjanidze
Muyumba
Silva
Slisz
Williams
Firmino
Hibbert
(TBD)
(TBD)

That leaves 11 players potentially available for selection by San Diego if none of these players leave this summer. Only one player from each club can be selected. Some of these players are out of contract or could be signed by another overseas club so the selection would be for the right of exclusive negotiation.

Abram (under contract through 2025, option 2026)
Guzan (option year in 2025)
Hernandez (option year in 2025)
Mosquera (under contract through 2025, option 2026)
McCarty (option 2025)
Thiare (option 2025)
McFadden (out of contract)
Westburg (out of contract)
Rios (out of contract)
Ibarra (option 2025)
Sosa (option 2025)

Who would you protect and who do you think could be picked by San Diego? And which of these unprotected players could realistically be on the roster in March of 2025?

I guess it would sort of depend on who our next head coach is, but I would personally protect Thiare. Hernandez could be a player that San Diego could grab as a veteran role and he does have a green card, so no international slot necessary.

Allow me to pollute the conversation with my poorly built thoughts: more important than the eventual sale, is the fact that Atlanta was not good for Almada´s, or Big Greek Guy Whose Names Escapes Me.
Atlanta was not a good the step in their careers that the club has initially positioned itself to be. As it was not for Josef´s second phase, or Pity. That club that sold Almiron (I just him in the Paraguay game) is no more. And that is the issue that needs to be adressed. To be a destination for these good, global players, you need to be that Atlanta again, with a coach and a brand that match the expectations.
Or else, you become the club that is good enough for Soviet Mechanics, Xandes, and Muyumbas in this world. A B team.
What is it going to be?

that’s the question, isn’t it? the club that eales built is not the club that boca dismantled and “rebuilt”. now that a new gm is in charge, i have seen a few glimmers of hope. but the next 6 months will speak volumes about what this club wants to be.

2017/18 magic and different than anything mls has ever seen
2019-2023 a middling mess of confusion and lack of true strategy (at least for success)
2024 and beyond…more of the same? become a traditional, mls-style club, recapture 17/18 identity?

this is what i am waiting to see. and the answer won’t determine my love for the club or my following of the club. but it will affect my decisions of financial involvement, as i’ve been a sth since (before) the beginning.

The “club that Eales built” was based on tons of marketing buildup and the ability to outspend everybody else on account of being an expansion side. It wasn’t a sustainable model. They did a great job with it, and it was a helluva fun ride, so don’t get me wrong I’m not throwing stones as far as that goes. The 2017/18 “magic” under Eales was great. But the 2019-23 “middling mess” was also under Eales watch.

I always got the sense that Eales is more of a builder/promoter type of GM (which is exactly what a new team needs, so great hire) than a sustainer/dynasty-builder type of GM. My hope is this is why Lagerway was hired and that he can get the organization headed in that direction. It will be interesting to see how Newcastle progresses/sustains under Eales, although of course it’s nowhere near an apples to apples comparison given it’s EPL and with the crazy Saudi money over there.

As far as Boca, I’m not exactly sure how much value or detriment he brings to the organization. I think the contrast between Boca-under-Eales vs. Boca-under-Lagerway will be telling.

The problems after 2019 are super easy to explain. None of you above me has it right.

After winning MLS Cup, Tata left mostly because he couldn’t stand his boss, Carlos Bocanegra. Darren Eales made it clear that Boca was his BFF and if he had to choose between Boca and any manager, it would ALWAYS be Boca. This empowered Boca to let his ego go nuts and he hired Frank de Boer mostly because FdB was both a big name as a player and manager and a bit down on his luck as a manager, so he couldn’t push back on Boca like Tata did over players. After the 2019 season, Boca decided to rebuild the team in his image so that he could get 100% of the credit for the future success and that’s when the problems began. Eales didn’t care because to him, Boca was always right. This is why I’ve been saying for years that until Boca is fired, nothing else matters. It’s just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Garth told us when he was hired that he took the job because he basically didn’t want to do GM stuff any more, yet things are spiraling out of control and he’s had to go back on that. It’s really simple – End the Boca reign of terror and things can get better.

Actually, we agree on that one. Mostly because Brazilians like to know their football, and to be able to assess their national team without the limitations that visionless love, or patriotism bring about. We are completely unimpressed with our Seleção. Costa Rica didn´t do anything, other than defend properly. Brasil looked like a bunch of not particularly smart robots.

I disagree about Atlanta being “not good for Almada and Giakoumakis“. Prior to Amada being signed by Atlanta he had been under investagation for sexual assult in Argentina. Atlanta did their homework, and were willing to sign him even though many were questioning if he met their moral standards (you all know who you are). Atlanta was willing to take a calculated risk and it paid off for both the club and the player. Before Giakoumakis signed with ATLUTD he was sitting on the bench for Celtic. Atlanta gave him a nice contract and an oppurtunity to play real minutes and he flourished when healthy.

I do have some concerns about the club’s direction and if it will continue be precieved as a destination moving forward. If the new coach isnt an internationally recoginized recruiter, and some top notch replacements for Almada and Giakoumakis are not brought in, I see the team may continue to spiral from its highest standard into just another MLS club with great facilities and a world class (half full) stadium.

Much of AU’s struggles this year are because Thiago Almada didn’t perform as the breakthrough talent he was supposed to be. He failed to live up to last season’s performance. It’s like whatever shine he gathered from playing with Messi in the World Cup faded and he forgot how to do those things for long spurts of time.

Much of AU’s struggles this year and last is because Giakoumakis couldn’t stay on the pitch. He was on the injured list as often as he was starting up top.

Don´t think so. I guess young, talented players from South American just need a good team to play in, something like Miami. For other comparisons, I wait eagerly for the day when MLS clubs will win the CCL, and get past their first game in the FIFA Club Championship, so as to meet Brazilian clubs in a competitive environment. That unfortunately is taking a lot longer than I hoped for.

I think this is mostly right but I would frame the question differently. Its not that Atlanta hasnt been good enough for Almada. He had something like 12 goals and 19 assists last year under a non-coach.

Its can Atlanta have alignment between coach and front office. Look at Tata and Almiron. I would argue that Almiron didnt need Tata. However Tata was extremely useful in getting a second high quality season out of Almiron before selling him.

Then Tata didnt care to stick around for the next iteration of players when the front office wanted to make those calls.

Many years later we end up with Pineda, who doesnt carry near as much weight when it comes to convincing Almada to give it his all for one more season.

So I think Atlanta needs to decide if winning is more important than profiting off of players first. That was Tata’s greatest attribute in my opinion. Not his superior tactical acumen, but his ability to gain the respect of players and keep the front office in check for a short time.

I think Tata only reinforces the importance of the coach in this system. He adds in so many dimensions. With his prestige, he helps to attract global players, or with higher potential (though MLS has increased a lot in visibility since 2017). His own little notebook is filled with young talent, he helps recruit. His gravitas helps to manage egos, and avert conflict. And he is a fine tactitian, and strategist, specially in his usage of the talent available to design the team for each game.
Probably, Bocanegra was jealous, and wanted to prove that that success was his.
You need another Tata, because your brand was too damaged by these last couple of years. A reallyh good coach can bring you back fast.

That’s a great question. And I have no idea what the answer is. But I will say that sometimes, maybe even a lot of times, these sell on rights expire at some point. They usually don’t last until the end of time. I think they are there mostly to make the fans feel better about the sale coming in at a lower price than expected. So 50/50 rights or whatever if he goes to Europe at a lower price… Somebody wake me up when we actually see a dollar from those “rights” down the road.

I still think there is little chance Almada will agree to go to Botafogo unless he gets some kind of guarantee that he is absolutely going to Europe in January. My hope is he goes to Olympique Lyon.

They aren’t there for the fans. The benefit is financial or risk-mitigation. The buying team can up the offer without really increasing their cash outlay for the initial transfer with the promise of more money if/when they sell on. In the situation with AUFC and Almada, they can kind of cash in on Almada’s “today value” of maybe the $20m with cover in case he gets sold for much more in the short term. Also, for AUFC now in a bit more of a re-build than maybe they thought they’d have this year, it’s probably better to just move Almada now for less than get Giako’s replacement and maybe a new coach then deal with another major move in the winter or next summer.

I do believe you are correct that these sell-on deals do have sunset clauses attached, but I believe we paid out on Miggy’s sale to Newcastle. Many of these sell-on clauses do come good. What is interesting is some are based on the total sell on transfer fee, and others are a percentage of profit made.

It’s best for both parties for him to take any step forward he can though. But wow, we really wasted the 2nd most talented AU roster ever.

Your last sentence x100. Hindsight is 20/20 and all, but the further away Pineda gets in the rearview mirror, the more frustrated I am that we wasted so much time on him. It’s probably irrational since it’s not like we’ve been setting the world on fire without him, but jeez.

But that’s impossible because Boca! Right?

Boca brought Almada and Pineda.

Garth/analytics brought GG, Saba, Silva, Williams, Gregersen, Slisz, and Muyumba.

Who deserves credit for the roster? I know my opinions.

Also, I wanna add, because I think this comment could be partly driven by a common misunderstanding of my name:

The “Carlos” refers to “Carlos Vela”, not Boca
