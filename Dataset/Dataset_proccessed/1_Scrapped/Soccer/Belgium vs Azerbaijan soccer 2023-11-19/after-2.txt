Lukaku sets new goals record
Brecht SchelstraeteReporting from King Baudouin Stadium

More from Tedesco: "It was an outstanding performance by Romelu. He scored with every shot. You can't do better. It is a pleasure for us to have him in the team, as a player and as a person. He is very important to us. I am proud of him."

Domenico Tedesco, Belgium coach: "Our first goal has been achieved. We are very happy with qualification. Now we have time to analyse: we still have a lot of work to do."


The Red Devils take the acclaim after topping their group.

More from Lukaku: "We don't lose any matches. This is important. I try to give the young players confidence. They have the mentality. We must continue like this – I think we can go far."

More from De Biasi: "We were mainly reactive. But the team was not able to play as would in Azerbaijan or did against Sweden. It was a difficult situation after we conceded a goal early."
