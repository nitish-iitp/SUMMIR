EURO 2024: ROMELU LUKAKU HITS FOUR AGAINST AZERBAIJAN FOR RECORD, DOMINIK SZOBOSZLAI HELPS HUNGARY TO MONTENEGRO WIN
BYTHE EDITORIAL TEAM

UPDATED 19/11/2023 AT 21:50 GMT

In the final round of Euro 2024 qualifying games, Belgium went 4-0 up in the first half against Azerbaijan with the goals all scored by Romelu Lukaku before they rounded off a 5-0 victory to end up top of Group F. Elsewhere, Liverpool playmaker Dominik Szoboszlai scored a brace as Hungary finished top of their group following a 3-1 win against Montenegro.

Romelu Lukaku hit four goals for Belgium as they beat Azerbaijan 5-0 in Euro 2024 qualifying on Sunday evening.
Lukaku scored all of his goals in the first effort as he moved on to 83 goals in his 113 international appearances, against a side that finished the game with 10 men.

His first goal was set up by a cross from Manchester City’s in-form winger Jeremy Doku before the visitors had Eddy Israfilov sent off, and then converted Timothy Castagne’s assist for the second.

He then headed in a cross from Wout Faes, and was then set up by Orel Mangala for the fourth before being taken off at half-time.
Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard grabbed a late fifth, also set up by Doku.
The haul in Belgium means Lukaku has now scored 14 goals in qualifying so far, clear of Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo (10) and France’s Kylian Mbappe (nine). It is also a record for a European Championship qualifying campaign, with the previous record of 13 jointly held by Northern Ireland’s David Healy and Poland and Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski.

The win means Belgium top Group F ahead of Austria, already certain of qualifying. Elsewhere in the group, Sweden - already out of the running to appear at next year’s tournament - defeated Estonia 2-0.
In Group G, Serbia drew 2-2 at home with Bulgaria, while in the group’s other match on Sunday, Liverpool playmaker Dominik Szoboszlai scored two goals in two minutes to help Hungary beat Montenegro 3-1.
Hungary finish the group as winners on 18 points with Serbia second on 14.
Group A was topped by Spain as they beat Georgia 3-1, who sit fourth, while Scotland finished second after a 3-3 home draw with Norway.
In Group J, Bosnia lost 2-1 at home to Slovakia, but Slovakia had already qualified in second spot before kick-off.
Luxembourg did brilliantly to come third in the group as they beat Liechtenstein 1-0 away, their fifth win of the campaign, where they suffered just three defeats.
Portugal finished with a perfect record after 10 games, as Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes scored first against Iceland in a 2-0 win.
