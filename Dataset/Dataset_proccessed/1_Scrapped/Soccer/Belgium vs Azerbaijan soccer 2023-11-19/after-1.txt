WHAT HAPPENED?

Lukaku was essentially a one-man wrecking crew against Azerbaijan on Sunday and scored four within 37 minutes. His first goal came in the 17th minute, and he completed his hat-trick within 13 minutes, before then adding a fourth for good measure. Lukaku made it four with a powerful laced finish after taking a pass in his stride brilliantly, all but ending the game as a contest.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Lukaku endued a tumultuous summer as he flirted with a variety of clubs before joining Roma on loan from Chelsea. Since then, he has scored nine goals in 14 games for the club, and his form shows no signs of abating.

WHAT NEXT FOR LUKAKU?

One has to think that Lukaku will be heading back to Roma full of confidence. They face Udinese on Sunday but their form leaves something to be desired, with Jose Mourinho's side currently down in seventh in Serie A.
