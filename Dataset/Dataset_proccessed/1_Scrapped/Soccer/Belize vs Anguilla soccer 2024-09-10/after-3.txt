Belize v Dominican Republic - CONCACAF Nations League

Belize will play host to Anguilla at TCIFA National Stadium in the CONCACAF Nations League on Tuesday. Both teams are set to face off against each other for the first time.

Belize vs Anguilla Preview

Belize could not sustain their division in 2023-34. They won only two matches out of six and finished bottom of their group, to face a drop from League B to C. Their main objective for this campaign is certainly a promotion back to League B, and they seem to be on track following a promising start in Group B (League C).

The Jaguars crushed Turks and Caicos Islands 4-0 on the road in their first match, which leaves them atop the standings with three points. They will hope to replicate that success in the upcoming meeting to strengthen their position. However, Anguilla are as good this term and could be a hard nut to crack for the hosts.

Anguilla will attempt once again to push for promotion in this campaign. They have been unsuccessful in their previous bids, and thus remain stuck in League C since they entered the competition. Anguilla never won a match in their previous three CONCACAF Nations League campaigns but they look better this year.

The visitors opened their campaign in Group B (League C) with a 2-0 win over Turks and Caicos Islands, which leaves them second in the group on three points. That win was their first in three outings, following a two-game losing streak against Suriname and Puerto Rico in the CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers.
