The United States men’s national team look to exorcise any remaining demons from the most embarrassing night in their history as they head down to Trinidad & Tobago looking to clinch a spot in next summer’s Copa America.

Gregg Berhalter’s side struggled mightily breaking down the Soca Warriors’ bus on Thursday night but eventually notched three huge goals to take a commanding lead into leg two.

With a big aggregate advantage, it will be interesting to see how the U.S. approach this match tactically. A wrench has also been thrown into potential plans with Weston McKennie departing the squad with an injury. Does Berhalter choose to go ultra-conservative? Or will he look to go for the killer blow knowing just one goal should secure the quarterfinal tie with the away goals rule in affect?

United States lineup:

TBA

Trinidad & Tobago lineup:

TBA
