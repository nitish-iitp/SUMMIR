Zimbabwe pulled off an impressive performance and defeated Namibia 2-0 in their Afcon qualifier at the Orlando Stadium on Monday evening.

The result sees the Warriors retain second place in Group J, strengthening their chances of participating in the tournament in Morocco next year.

The match started off evenly balanced, however Zimbabwe were clearly the better team in terms of creating attacking patterns and breaking the lines to find an opportunity.

Namibia had most of the possession in the first half, and it ended goalless with both teams still having the opportunity to do better in the second stanza.

Walter Musona opened the scoring for Zimbabwe within five minutes of the second half and 10 minutes later, he completed his brace when he netted a penalty kick.

Prince Dube delivered the final blow on the Brave Warriors in the 89th minute and it looked like the job was done, with the three points guaranteed to be in the bag.

Godwin Claudius Eiseb pulled one back in the 90th minute shortly after coming off the bench, but it was a little too late for a comeback and Zimbabwe walked away with all three points in Soweto.

Zimbabwe (0) 3 (Musona 50’, 61’ (P), Dube 89’)
