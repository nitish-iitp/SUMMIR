Zim Take Massive Step Towards AFCON

Zimbabwe have celebrated back-to-back wins over Namibia to take a massive step towards qualifying for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.

The Warriors have been inspired by the return of Khama Billiat, who netted Zim’s 1-0 winner over Namibia last week.

On Monday, it was former Polokwane City and Sekhukhune United forward Walter Musona, who netted two goals in the 3-1 win over Collin Benjamin’s side.

Musona scored the opener in the 50th minute before making it 2-0 from the penalty spot 11 minutes later.

Prince Dube made it 3-0 in the 89th minute, while Godwin Eiseb pulled one back for Namibia in injury-time.

The successive wins saw the Warriors climb to second place with eight points in Group J, two behind Cameroon booked their AFCON ticket earlier on Monday after a 1-0 win over Kenya.

Zimbabwe now have their fate in their own hands and a point in their next match at home against Kenya, who are in third on three points, would seal their participation at next year’s showpiece.
