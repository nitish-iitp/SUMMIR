Warriors Set Sights On Victory Against Namibia
2 months ago
Mon, 14 Oct 2024 05:07:27 GMT

The Warriors are aiming for a victory this Monday at Orlando Stadium as they take on the Brave Warriors of Namibia.

This comes on the heels of their 1-0 triumph in the first of back-to-back AFCON qualifying matches last Thursday.

Khama Billiat scored the only goal from the penalty spot, securing Zimbabwe’s first three points of the qualifying campaign and briefly elevating them to the top of the group with five points.

However, the Warriors have since been surpassed by Cameroon, who now lead Group J with seven points following their 4-1 win against Kenya on Friday.

Currently, Kenya holds four points, while Namibia remains at the bottom of the table without a win and zero points.

Speaking ahead of the match against Namibia today, Warriors vice-captain Marshall Munetsi said:

Getting a win was crucial. We have been progressing well, and we knew we needed to win the first game by all means. Namibia tried to play mind games, but we were happy with the three points.

The confidence was already there after our results in Uganda. We know Kenya and Cameroon will cancel each other out. Namibia aren’t an easy pushover, but we need six points from these two games.

Zimbabwe’s match against Namibia last week was played behind closed doors and Munetsi believes having fans in today’s match will be an advantage for the Warriors. He said:

Our fans can show their support by coming to the stadium. We’d love to see nice faces cheering us on.

Morocco will host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, having previously hosted it in 1988.

In 1988 only eight teams were at the Africa Cup of Nations, which Cameroon won.

In 2025, 24 teams are set to compete at the tournament after CAF has expanded the competition.

Morrocco hosting this tournament twice before other nations have even hosted once says a lot about our African situation.

The Zimbabwe vs Namibia match is today, and it's going to be an exciting one! The kick-off time is 3 p.m. CAT (GMT+2) or 17:00 BST ¹ ². If you're planning to catch the game, note that it's being played at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa ¹ ². Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the match will be televised in the UK, but you can still stream it live ². Zimbabwe is looking to complete a double after winning 1-0 against Namibia just a few days ago ³. This win moved them up to second in the group, while Namibia is still struggling to pick up a point ³. Will Zimbabwe keep their momentum going?
