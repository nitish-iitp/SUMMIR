Onana produced a double save as Man United went away with a point against Crystal Palace

BUEA, Cameroon – Manchester United’s goalkeeper and Cameroon goalkeeper Andre Onana has clinched the Premier League Save of the Month award for September, recognizing his incredible double stop in a goalless draw against Crystal Palace.

Onana’s brilliance was on full display in the match, where he pulled off a stunning sequence of saves to keep United level. After parrying an initial shot from Palace’s Eddie Nketiah, the Cameroonian shot-stopper reacted with lightning speed to deny a rebound attempt from Ismaila Sarr, securing his team a crucial point.

The remarkable double saves showcased Onana’s sharp reflexes, composure, and resilience under pressure, earning widespread praise from fans and pundits alike. His performance has been one of the bright spots in a challenging period for Manchester United, who have struggled to find form during a five-game winless run.

It was a defining moment in the game, and former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel gave his expert opinion on the save on the official Premier League website.

“You don’t expect the ball to go through him [Matthijs de Ligt]," the Dane said. "So not only does he have to react, he has to lean in and put a firm hand on it. The save is just incredible. It's an exceptional save. He stands out and gets his team points."

In addition to the Premier League accolade, Onana also recently won the Manchester United Fan's Player of the Month award for his consistent displays, further cementing his status as a key figure in the squad. Despite the team’s overall struggles, Onana has proven to be a reliable force at the back, often single-handedly keeping his side in the game with crucial saves.

This is the second time he has won the Premier League Save of the Month award, the previous time being in April when he stopped Burnley striker Lyle Foster's effort at Old Trafford.

"I know the country, I know the league, I know the city. I will take a lot of risks like I used to do in the past before I was here. You guys are going to see a different Andre Onana,” Andre Onana told the club website.

Andre Onana has kept four clean sheets in the Premier League, which is more than any other keeper in the top flight this season.

September was a poor month as far as results are concerned, although Onana did well on a positive note, being voted United’s Player of the Month by the fans. The Cameroonian stopper has kept four clean sheets in the Premier League, which is more than any other keeper in the top flight this season.

Andre Onana is currently on international duty with Cameroon. He was on hand on October 11 as Cameroon defeated Kenya 4-1 at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaoundé in the AFCON 2025 Qualifiers. He is equally expected to be in goal again this Monday as Cameroon faces Kenya in the return leg in Uganda.
