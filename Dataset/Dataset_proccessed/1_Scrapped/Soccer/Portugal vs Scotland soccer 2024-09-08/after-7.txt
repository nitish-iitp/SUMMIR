UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
PORTUGAL 2-1 SCOTLAND - CRISTIANO RONALDO COMPLETES UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE COMEBACK WIN AFTER EARLY SCOTT MCTOMINAY GOAL
BYBEN GODDARD

UPDATED 08/09/2024 AT 21:18 GMT

Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed the all-important goals in the second half to salvage a 2-1 victory for Portugal as they hosted Scotland in their UEFA Nations League encounter at the Estadio da Luz. It looked to be a disastrous evening for Roberto Martinez's side early on after Scott McTominay netted for the visitors in just the eighth minute, but they eventually recovered well.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late winner two minutes from time as Portugal came from a goal down to beat Scotland 2-1.
The 39-year-old, who netted his 900th goal for club and country on Thursday night, was on hand to slide home a Nuno Mendes cross to complete a fightback which broke Scotland’s hearts.

Ronaldo was only introduced at half-time after Scott McTominay’s header had given Scotland an early lead.

RONALDO NETS LANDMARK 900TH GOAL AS PORTUGAL BEAT CROATIA TO MAKE WINNING START

05/09/2024 AT 22:01

Portugal dominated the possession and chances but only equalised in the 54th minute when Bruno Fernandes’ effort snuck through goalkeeper Angus Gunn.
Gunn redeemed himself with a fine double-save to deny substitute Joao Felix late on as Ronaldo rattled the post twice.
However, Gunn was helpless as Ronaldo steered home the winning goal.
Scotland’s defeat will feel tougher after having two penalty claims before the winning goal, which were both waved away from referee Maurizio Mariani.
Steve Clarke’s side have suffered back-to-back Nations League defeats after Poland scored a late penalty to beat them 3-2 on Thursday night.
Meanwhile, Portugal sit top of the Nations League Group 1 following two wins in as many matches.
Scotland are pointless and bottom of Group 1, but just three points behind both Croatia and Poland.
TALKING POINT – CRISTIANO RONALDO SHOWS CLASS TO SPARK FIGHTBACK
Portugal boss Roberto Martinez introduced Cristiano Ronaldo from the bench at half-time and he provided the experience to guide his nation to victory.
After failing to take advantage of their possession and shots on goal during the first half, with Ronaldo on the pitch the hosts looked a different side.
The 39-year-old watched on as Bruno Fernandes levelled and then almost assisted Joao Felix with a winner, only for Angus Gunn to make a fine save.
Ronaldo then rattled the post twice in one breathtaking move, not deterred he went on to find the late winner.
PLAY OF THE MATCH - NUNO MENDES (PORTUGAL)
The wing-back was rarely in trouble at the back as he kept Scotland at arm’s length throughout the game.
With the game heading into its final moments Mendes showed the vision to race forward and provide a vital assist for Ronaldo to tap home from close range.
