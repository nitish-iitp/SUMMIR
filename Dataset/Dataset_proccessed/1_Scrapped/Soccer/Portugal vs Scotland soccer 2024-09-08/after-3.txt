RONALDO STRIKES LATE TO BREAK SCOTTISH HEARTS
Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late winner two minutes from time as Portugal came from a goal down to beat Scotland 2-1.
The 39-year-old who netted his 900th goal for club and country on Thursday night was on hand to slide home Nuno Mendes cross to complete a fightback which broke Scotland’s hearts.
Ronaldo was only introduced at half-time after Scott McTominay’s header had given Scotland an early lead.
Portugal dominated possession and chances but only equalised on the 54th minute when Bruno Fernandes’ effort snuck through goalkeeper Angus Gunn.
Gunn redeemed himself with a fine double save to deny substitute Joao Felix late on as Ronaldo rattled the post twice.
However, Gunn was helpless as Ronaldo steered home the winning goal.
Scotland’s defeat will feel tougher after having two penalty claims before the winning goal, which were both waved away from referee Maurizio Mariani.
Steve Clarke’s side have suffered back-to-back Nations League defeats after Poland scored a late penalty to beat them 3-2 on Thursday night.
Meanwhile, Portugal sit top of the Nations League Group 1 following two wins in as many matches.
Scotland are pointless and bottom but just three points behind both Croatia and Poland.
