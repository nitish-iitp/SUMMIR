It's fair to say optimism for the national team is at one of its lower ebbs of recent times - but how about a fairytale result in Lisbon to get the fire roaring again?

That will be the main aim of the game tonight as Steve Clarke and co as they look to put their travel misery behind them by picking up a famous one on the road. The Nations League A campaign got off to a deflating start for Scotland after THAT late Poland winner at Hampden after responding from going two goals down - but this is a team known for standing up to be counted when the chips are down.

But it's another big ask for the Dark Blues as they face down a star-stuffed Portugal side feature Cristiano Ronaldo, who just passed the 900 career-goals mark. A victory on the road at arguably in the toughest game in the section would do wonders for the squad, the fans, and the nation as a whole as we gear up for a tough Nations League campaign with World Cup qualifiers coming down the tracks too. Here Record Sport has all the details on how to watch the game..

When and where will the game take place?

Scotland will be going head-to-head with Portugal in Lisbon on Sunday, September 8. Kick-off is at 7:45 pm UK time. The match will be played at Estádio do SL Benfica.
