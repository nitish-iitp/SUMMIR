PORTUGAL 2-1 CROATIA: CRISTIANO RONALDO NETS LANDMARK 900TH GOAL TO HELP PORTUGUESE MAKE WINNING START TO NATIONS LEAGUE
BYDARREN BEATTIE

UPDATED 05/09/2024 AT 22:01 GMT

Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 900th career goal to help Portugal beat Croatia 2-1 and make a winning start to the Nations League. The 39-year-old struck in the 34th-minute to double his side’s lead after Diogo Dalot gave Roberto Martinez’s charges the opener. It was a night of mixed fortunes for Dalot as his own-goal gave Croatia a way back into the game, but Portugal held on for victory.

Cristiano Ronaldo became the first footballer to score 900 career goals to help Portugal overcome Croatia 2-1 in the UEFA Nations League.
Portugal were the better side throughout but only held a two-goal lead for a matter of minutes, as Diogo Dalot turned the ball past his own goalkeeper in the same half that he opened the scoring for the hosts.

Yet even without the weight of history, Ronaldo’s goal was the pick of the bunch as he burst onto a Nuno Mendes cross and volleyed past Dominik Livakovic to trigger raucous celebrations in Lisbon.

RONALDO COMPLETES COMEBACK WIN FOR PORTUGAL AFTER SCOTLAND TAKE EARLY LEAD

08/09/2024 AT 21:18

Dalot’s first goal looked set to precipitate a rout after neat work by Bruno Fernandes at close quarters set up his Manchester United team-mate to fire home, and though Croatia didn’t concede for the last hour of the game they offered precious little going forward as Luka Modric’s star continues to wane.
However, it’s Poland who will top Group A1 after a seesaw affair at Hampden Park. Scotland had fought back to 2-2 in the second half but Nicola Zalewski’s 97th-minute penalty undid Billy Gilmour and Scott McTominay’s efforts meaning the Poles will slot ahead of Portugal on goals scored.
Portugal completed their main objective of claiming three points though, with Ronaldo linking up more play in the second half and Mendes and Nelson Semedo had opportunities to put the game to bed.
Dalot’s own goal four minutes before half-time kept Croatia in the game and they had chances of their own, belatedly growing into the game in the final 20 minutes.
Andrej Kramaric was instrumental in the build-up to his side’s score and was given a shot at stealing a point in the dying seconds of the game, but shinned it past the post as Portugal ran out deserved winners.
TALKING POINT - RONALDO AND MODRIC IN STARK CONTRAST
Ivan Perisic, now aged 35 and without a club since he was released from Hajduk Split in the summer, took the captain’s armband from Modric with 10 minutes to go as coach Zlatko Dalic attempted to freshen up his side in search of an equaliser.
It was the end of Modric’s 179th cap for Croatia, five months younger than Ronaldo, but as the Portuguese captain made way for 26-year-old Pedro Goncalves to lead the line it was a difficult reminder to see a fellow 2018 World Cup finalist trot on from the other dugout.
Ronaldo is surrounded by compatriots entering or in their prime and he enjoyed a profitable partnership with Mendes throughout the game, that crescendoed in the goal that proved to be the winner.
While Martinez has kept the same nucleus that sputtered in Germany in the summer, they only seem to be improving as a team while Croatia are heading the other way. Martin Baturina was a bright spark in the centre of midfield before being replaced by fellow 2003 baby Igor Matanovic, who genuinely shone in the final stages with plenty of touches in the penalty area.
But they are isolated beacons in an aging Croatian team who must undergo a revolution if they’re to have any chance of keeping their recent World Cup record going in 2026.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - CRISTIANO RONALDO (PORTUGAL)
Ronaldo’s clearly not the player he once was with time finally catching up to one of the fittest athletes in world sport.
But he was still the quickest thinker in the penalty area as Mendes was given space and the opportunity to drive the ball forward, with Ronaldo showing he’s picked up more than a few smarts in 1,235 professional games.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
7' - GOAL! PORTUGAL 1-0 CROATIA (DALOT): What a start for Portugal! It's Fernandes at the heart of things again as he ghosts in from the left and has plenty of options to choose from, finding the Manchester United full-back's perfectly timed run with a deft flick. Dalot still had a bit to do running away from goal and was tracked by Borna Sosa but he's able open up his body and fire under Livakovic to take the lead!
23' - ALMOST NUMBER 900! The crowd are desperate to see history made tonight and they almost get their moment as Ronaldo latches onto a cute Rafael Leao backheel at full speed. Though he produces a well-placed low shot, it's a tight angle, and Livakovic positions himself perfectly to make the save and concede only a corner.
34' - GOAL!! PORTUGAL 2-0 CROATIA (RONALDO): It's the moment they all came to see, goal number 900 for Cristiano Ronaldo! And it was brutally simple too, a fizzing Nuno Mendes cross from deep that the legend reacts quickest too of anyone in the penalty area, latching onto the ball with his right boot straight past a helpless Livakovic.
41' - GOAL!!! PORTUGAL 2-1 CROATIA (DALOT OG): He's scored in both nets today and out of nowhere, Croatia are back in this! Livakovic's quick thinking sparks a break and Kramaric - who was caught offside earlier - times his run perfectly to take the ball on the right of the penalty area. He holds it up well before scything a low cross to the onrushing support, it looks like the chance has gone but Borna Sosa slides to nudge the ball back into the six-yard box and Dalot unknowingly fires it over Costa.
45' - HIT THE BAR! What a finish to this half! Neto is flying down the left and as the defence scrambles he just keeps on trucking, before launching an laser from close range. It has Livakovic beaten but slams into the bar and away from Ronaldo.
