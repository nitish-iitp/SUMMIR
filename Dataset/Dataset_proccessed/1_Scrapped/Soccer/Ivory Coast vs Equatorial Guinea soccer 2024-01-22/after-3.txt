That group table makes grim reading for the hosts. They must wait to see if their distant hopes remain alive. But should they play like today they’ll have little chance.

The #AFCON hosts Ivory Coast have been humiliated by Equatorial Guinea.

They are now forced to wait until Wednesday to see if their third-placed finish in Group A is enough to progress.#BBCFootball pic.twitter.com/ZnSSSEN2LI

Full-time: Equatorial Guinea 4-0 Ivory Coast

What a match, what a scoreline, and what misery for the hosts. Still, Equatorial Guinea were inspired, superb and played such great attacking football, and defended like a team. The contrast with the hosts could not be greater.

Full-time: Guinea Bissau 0-1 Nigeria

This game has five minutes added on. Both teams know their fate as they are played out. It’s second place for Nigeria, who seem happy enough.

Equatorial Guinea 4-0 Ivory Coast: It might have been five. Adam K gets in touch..”What a pair of games -- and what a performance from Equatorial Guinea. This game feels really Brazil-Germany 2014 to me with how flimsy the Ivorians’ defence appears to be; every single time Equatorial Guinea come forward they look like scoring. The hosts are clearly feeling immense pressure and (for whatever reason) not able to handle it -- this will be a long, painful evening of reflection for those poor players. Take nothing away from Equatorial Guinea, who have been outstanding today; their gameplan executed to perfection. We’re truly witnessing African football history! Absolutely love this competition.”

Equatorial Guinea 4-0 Ivory Coast: Kari Tulinius gets in touch: “What a time to be Emilio Nsue! He’s 34 and is winding down his career at third tier Spanish club CF Intercity in Alicante. Now he’s top scorer at the Africa Cup of Nations and is captaining the national team into the second round.”

Equatorial Guinea 4-0 Ivory Coast: It’s the heaviest home defeat in history and surely no host has been humiliated in this manner. This is embarrasssing. There are seven minutes to be added on. Seven minutes of misery unless two goals arrive from somewhere.

Equatorial Guinea 4-0 Ivory Coast (Buyla, 86)

While the ball keeps ending up in the net across Abdijan and being ruled offside, Equatorial Guinea can’t stop scoring. Ivory Coast can’t defend, either. Buyla is allowed to run on to the ball and scuff his shot in. That’s surely the felling blow.

Guinea Bissau 0-1 Nigeria: The Nigerians are heading for second place now. Still, it coud be worse, they could the hosts. They’re looking for another goal, and Osimhen heads wide from a beauty of a cross from Aina.

Equatorial Guinea 3-0 Ivory Coast: Make no mistake, this is an all-time Afcon sensation. Konate misses a chance but the Ivorians have to go in search of a goal. They will spend an anxious week waiting for the other groups to play out, but with little hope.

Goal! Equatorial Guinea 3-0 Ivory Coast (Nsue, 76)

The Ivorians are heading out out out. Nsue was laid his fifth goal of the tourney from a brilliant run from midfield from Jose Machin.

Goal! Equatorial Guinea 2-0 Ivory Coast (Ganet, 73)

A free-kick from miles out is thrashed into the net. Boly handballs outside his area. Ganet scores like Beckham at his best and Fofana had no answer. The hosts are in deep, deep trouble.

Ivory Coast have a goal chalked off!

Just after a triple change is made, Seko Fofana plays the ball through and Krasso scores…but no, offside. There’s a mutinous atmosphere in the stadium.

Osimhen has a goal chalked off!

There looks to be a foul on Bassey, and then, after a melee, the ball is put in. Offside and play on says the referee. That was chaotic and not necessarily clear as to what really happened.

Osminhen misses a late chance against Guinea Bissau though at least they are leading. Ivory Coast, even if their three points might be enough to qualify, are on sudden death. Equatorial Guinea have been a tad lucky but they scored a fine goal.

Ivory Coast have a goal chalked off!

An equaliser? Or was he offside? Sanagare’s celebration is wide. VAR is taking a look and so is the ref. It’s looks clear. The shock is still very much possible.
