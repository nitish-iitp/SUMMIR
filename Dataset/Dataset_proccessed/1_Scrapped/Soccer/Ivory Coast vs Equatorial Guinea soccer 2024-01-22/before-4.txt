CHANG’ANAMUNO—The government is encouraging adequate exploration

By Deogratias Mmana:

The mining sector’s share to gross domestic product (GDP) has for years stagnated at a meager one percent, a rate line minister Monica Chang’anamuno has decried as low.

She said it is the desire of the government to improve the contribution to 20 percent.

Chang’anamuno said this on Friday when she welcomed and opened the office of Tanzanian firm Azurite Management and Consultancy.

Azurite Management and Consultancy firm is a professional and technical advisor for mining and exploration of oil and gas.

“This is the more reason why the government is encouraging adequate exploration, sustainable exploration of these abundant mineral resources and in-country mineral beneficiation for the economic growth and development of the country,” Chang’anamuno said.

She said the government has adopted an agriculture, tourism and mining strategy to realise the full benefits of mining through job and wealth creation.

She said there is a need to raise the per capita income, create decent and sufficient rural and urban jobs and viable entrepreneurship opportunities for both men and women.

“Therefore, the mining sector has a critical role to play in transforming Malawi to an upper middle income economy in line with Malawi 2063,” Chang’anamuno said.

According to Chang’anamuno, some of the gaps in the mining sector include technological advancements, environmental concerns, regulatory compliance and public perception.

“It is a recognition of these challenges that Azurite has found space to provide these solutions through their extensive knowledge and experience in mining operations,” the minister said.

She cautioned the company to respect the country’s laws and urged it to demonstrate that it can produce quality work.

Some of the services the company offers include exploration drilling, country risk assessment, geology technical services, mineral exploration management and tenement management and mineral licencing.

Azurite Management and Consultancy Business Development Manager Siziwe Mkandawire said the company will provide solutions to the challenges Malawi has been facing in the mining sector.

“We are branching out to Malawi so that we can provide mining needs to our clients. We saw mining problems in Malawi. We want to explore possibilities of mining in Malawi. For example, there are mines in Karonga and Balaka,” Mkandawire said.

She said with electricity challenges in Malawi, the company can find solutions for mining companies, notably getting them solar companies.

“As for water problems, we can get a drilling company for the clients,” she said, adding that Azurite can also source protective gear for miners.

Germany Ambassador to Malawi Ute Konig said mining is a sector that has the potential to create more jobs and bring more forex which is in line with MW2063.
