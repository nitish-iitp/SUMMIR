National team coach confident ahead of Nations League kickoff

Joey Jap Tjong, head coach of the Cayman Islands men’s national football team, is expecting a ‘good challenge’ at the upcoming 2024-25 CONCACAF Nations League tournament.

The regional showcase will feature Cayman footballers kicking off group stage gameplay at the Truman Bodden Sports Complex against British Virgin Islands on Wednesday, 4 Sept.

The last two games between Cayman, currently sitting at 195 in the FIFA rankings, and BVI, ranked 207, both ended in 1-all draws and though Jap Tjong sees a path to victory, he admits that nothing in life or on the pitch is guaranteed.

“I underestimate nobody and no team, but we are also not afraid; we are always focused to go on the field and win,” Jap Tjong told the Compass on Monday, 2 Sept.

“I know that BVI have great players, very good quality. It’s not going to be easy but if we stick to the plan, keep our efforts and quality in place, we will get the win.”

The local men will return to their home pitch three days later to face 146th-ranked St. Kitts and Nevis – a nation the locals haven’t opposed since 1991, with that game also concluding 1-1.

Cayman fans are hoping their team will build off their historic win against Antigua and Barbuda in the World Cup qualifiers, after a last-minute header by Joshwa Campbell, who told the Compass ahead of the upcoming Nation League fixture that it’s a new era of football in Cayman.

“The people expect a lot from us after the win,” Jap Tjong said. “I have confidence. The players are very eager to play, they’re motivated, and we are going with a plan, and I expect a good match.”

The teams will play each other twice, with Cayman playing their last two games away in the Nations League tournament.

Matches for all three Leagues (A, B, and C) will be played across three upcoming men’s FIFA match windows (September, October and November 2024), followed by the CONCACAF Nations League finals in March 2025.

“Our focus is to advance out of the group,” Jap Tjong said, but noted that with the added pressure on Cayman after their success in the World Cup qualifier, should the team fail to win, he asked for continued support.

“Even when we are not successful at times, we still need the support. Nothing is perfect but the closer you come to perfection, the closer the victory will be.”

In addition, Cayman will host the fixture between St. Kitts and Nevis and BVI on 10 Sept.

All matches are scheduled to begin at 3:30pm.
