The Nature Boys will enter this game on the back of two consecutive defeats, against Guatemala (3-0) and Dominican Republic (4-0) in the World Cup qualifiers. The hosts have won twice in their last 10 matches in all competitions. They will take confidence from their two previous homes wins into Wednesday’s clash.
