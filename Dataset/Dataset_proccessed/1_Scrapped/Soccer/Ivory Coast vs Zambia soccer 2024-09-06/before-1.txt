Dr. Abdulai highlighted the critical role sports play in transforming lives in Sierra Leone, particularly for the country’s youth, who make up 62 percent of the population.

He emphasized that sports have become the largest employer, offering opportunities for boys and girls from marginalized communities and helping to reduce crime while providing jobs. “We go into ghettos and shanty communities, taking young people to international platforms where they can grow and thrive,” he said.
