Reigning Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) champions Ivory Coast began their qualification campaign for the 2025 edition of the tournament with a hard-fought 2-0 home win over Group G rivals Zambia at Stade de la Paix in Bouake on Friday night.

The Elephants had to sweat to overcome Chipolopolo in a repeat of the 2012 Afcon final, claiming all three points thanks to second-half goals from substitute Jean-Philippe Krasso.

Ivory Coast dominated the first half and enjoyed the majority of possession, but they managed just two shots on target, both of which were repelled by Zambia goalkeeper Tresford Mulenga.

The visitors offered little in the way of attacking response, and also suffered an injury blow when Edward Chilufya was forced off the field and replaced by Clatous Chama just 26 minutes into the match.

The second half followed a similar pattern, with the Elephants dictating terms but struggling to break through against a resilient Chipolopolo defence.

However, the West African heavyweights finally had some fortune with just under 20 minutes of regulation time to play when Simon Adingra teed up substitute Jean-Philippe Krasso, who netted shortly after his introduction to put Ivory Coast 1-0 up.

And a second goal quickly followed the first, with Krasso converting from fellow substitute Benie Traore’s assist in the 84th minute to wrap up all three points for Ivory Coast.

The teams will return to Group G action on Tuesday 10 September, with Ivory Coast ‘away’ to Chad in Abidjan, and Zambia hosting Sierra Leone in Ndola.
