Georgia take on Montenegro in a friendly on Sunday

Georgia wrap up preparations for the upcoming European Championship when they take on Montenegro in a friendly at the Podgorica City Stadium on Sunday. This will be the first meeting between the two nations since October 2009, when Robert Prosinečki’s men picked up a 2-1 victory.

Montenegro were denied a third win on the bounce on Wednesday as they suffered a 2-0 friendly defeat against Belgium at the King Baudouin Stadium.

Prior to that, Prosinečki’s side finished third in Group G of the Euro 2024 qualifiers before picking up consecutive friendly wins over Belarus and North Macedonia.

Montenegro now return home, where they are on a four-game winning streak, scoring eight goals and keeping two clean sheets since September 2023.

Georgia, on the other hand, booked their spot in the European Championship last time out when they beat Greece on penalties in the playoff final.

With that result, Willy Sagnol’s men have now gone unbeaten in five of their last six matches across all competitions, claiming four wins and one draw since October 2023.

Georgia will look to return to action on a positive note before heading into the Euro, where they have been drawn in Group F alongside Turkey, Czech Republic and Portugal.
