Had agreed deal with French giants
WHAT HAPPENED?

Per Gazzetta dello Sport, Kvaratskhelia had agreed a deal to join PSG after discussing a potential move with the French club. However, he is now locked in negotiations with Napoli over a contract extension that could see him earn as much as €5 million per season (£4m/$5.4m).

THE BIGGER PICTURE

The club are unwilling to lose both the Georgia international and Victor Osimhen in the same summer and there is plenty of interest in the Nigerian striker. Napoli expect bids and as a result, want to extend the winger's stay, ideally with a potential release clause that protects both parties. Osimhen could move to PSG instead.

DID YOU KNOW?

The 23-year-old's current contract runs until 2027 but Napoli are set to extend that, although it is not clear what the duration will be. Last season, he scored 11 goals in all competitions and provided nine assists, a significant drop-off from the season prior in which he scored 14 and laid on 17 assists.

WHAT NEXT?

Kvaratskhelia will be involved at Euro 2024 with underdogs Georgia. They face a final warm-up game against Montenegro on Sunday and will then head to Germany, where they will play Turkey, Czech Republic and Portugal in the group stages.
