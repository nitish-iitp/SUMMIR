We said: Montenegro 1-2 Georgia
Georgia have scored 14 times in their last two friendlies against Mongolia and Thailand, but this will be a tougher examination. We are expecting a tight match on Sunday but believe that Georgia will be able to navigate their way to a win in their final fixture before their Euro 2024 campaign. Read more.
