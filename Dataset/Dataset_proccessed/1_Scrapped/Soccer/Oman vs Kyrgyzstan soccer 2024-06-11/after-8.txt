Oman have already qualified for the next round

Oman host Kyrgyzstan at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex in Muscat on Tuesday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with their progression to the third round already secured.

With four wins in five games, the Reds have 12 points in the bag and sit two clear of second-placed Kyrgyzstan, the only side to have beaten them in this round.

After opening their campaign on a winning note against Chinese Taipei, Oman were beaten 1-0 by the White Falcons on matchday two. Since then, the Middle Eastern side have built themselves up again and won thrice in a row.

Going into the final day, Jaroslav Silhavy's side will aim to wrap up their campaign in style as Oman are looking to reach the World Cup finals for the first time.

Oman vs Kyrgyzstan Prediction

Oman are the stronger team on paper but they have not beaten their rivals from Central Asia in their last two encounters. The Reds could therefore approach the game cautiously and play to avoid a loss, as their qualification to the third round has long been secured.

The White Falcons should be able to hold them once again.
