PETALING JAYA: Malaysia ended their World Cup 2026-Asian Cup 2027 second-round qualifiers campaign by beating Taiwan 3-1 at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil on Tuesday (June 11).

Taiwan drew first blood through striker Yu Yao-Hsing in the 19th minute.

Malaysia responded well in the second-half with two goals from winger Safawi Rasid (53rd) and striker Paulo Josue (68th).

Winger Adib Abd Raop applied the icing on the cake with a third goal in injury time.

Coach Kim Pan-gon had said that the team needed to score seven goals to improve the goal difference but he had to be content with the three on the night.

The win sees Harimau Malaya ending their Group D campaign with 10 points from six matches.

Their fate for the next round will only be known after the Oman-Kyrgyzstan match, which starts at midnight.
