Ghanaian coach Kwasi Appiah

The Sudanese national team, led by Ghanaian coach Kwasi Appiah, are flying high in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, having won two and drawn one of the three matches played so far.

On Thursday, June 6, 2024, Sudan secured their second win of the campaign with a 2-0 victory over Mauritania.

Two goals in the first half ensured that Kwasi Appiah and his team moved to the top of Group B with seven points from three games.

Sudan's first goal was scored by Saif Thierry in the 15th minute. The second Sudanese goal resulted from an own goal by Mauritania’s Aly Abeid.

With Senegal drawing 1-1 with DR Congo in the other group game, Sudan now tops Group B with seven points, two more than second-placed Senegal.

Kwasi Appiah and his Sudanese players will face South Sudan in an away fixture on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.
