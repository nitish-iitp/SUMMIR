Got a CZ-457 came with one 5rnd polymer mag. I am trying to get 10rnd Steel Mags

I got 5 from a site part number 5133-1200-01ND - box says 455-452

https://alflahertys.com/cz-455-or-452-magazine-22lr-10-round-steel-5133-1200-01nd/

Well they don’t fit, they won’t insert all the way in.

found few on another site same part Number but says 457 on it. so I am confused now


I ordered this same part number they say 455/452 on them and don’t Fit.

I can get these but they have the same part number what if these also don’t fit?

trying find correct part number for 457 Steel 10rnd mags

Thanks in advance

Figured out the issue the Steel mags are same for 455 and 457 but the polymer are different to steel.
My gun is set up for polymer mags, I have ordered some.

Last year I ordered the 10 round polymer magazine for my 455 and it did not fit. After a lot of sanding it still would not insert without a lot of force, then it would not feed correctly. Chalked it up to poor CZ quality and put it in my junk parts box. When I get a chance I will revisit the problem to see if I can get to work. Hope you have better results.

Try the mags from L3I, they're made from aluminum and they fit and work in the half dozen 457's in my group, better than polymer or the steels others have been trying...

Seems like the bolt guide is preventing the steel mag from seating all the way uo, no issue with polymer mag since the have the cut out in the front. I modified one steel and it worked.

BTW the problem is the Anarchy outdoors extended mag release, I didn’t read the fine print. It is not compatible with factory CZ metal mags….lol
I ordered the L3l mags
I will have some CZ factory metal mags for sale it seems they are like dinosaurs I had to source mine from outside the Country
The polymer ones will work too.
I am learning so much from trial and error.

You made a good choice with the L3i Mags. They work really well, look great, and the quality is phenomenal.

Appreciate you sharing about the metal magazine compatibility issue. That's really surprising as I have the same latch and it works fine on the factory 5 round magazine.

I think that it may have to do with the curvature of the factory CZ 10-round mags and the heavy ribs on the front contacting the extended mag release. I ordered some of them from CZ also and had the same issue with them. Since I’m using them for comps, I didn’t want to give up the extended mag release. So they sit in a drawer somewhere.

Surprise to me too. it's that front notch that is on the polymer ones that is needed for it to work with Anarchy extended latch. I think the DPI extended latch works but can't get a hold of one.

The L3I mags look great with extended capacity but looks like I may not receive them in time before my match on the 21st so I may have to switch back to the factory latch or cut up another mag.

You can also order 15rd CZ factory mags now, but the only place I've seen them is from overseas, but the price really isn't bad even with shipping.

The only thing I'd say about the 15rd factory mags is while they've functioned perfectly, they are pretty long compared to say the 10rd factory with a 2-3 round extension, but I've had that combo not run reliably in the past either.

I’ve found that the trick with the Anarchy Outdoors mag extension is that it needs minor inside trimming and fitting on the inside at the transition. Once you do that, there should be no more feeding issues and they work fine.

I have 5x 5-round poly and 2x 10-round poly and 1x 10-round metal mags - and ALL work fine in both my 455 and 457-VMTR. The 457 has the anarchy ext release, too.

The 10 rnd metal factory don’t work with Anarchy Extended release - this is listed on the Anarchy website as well. I tested the 10rnd oem metal with MDT extended mag release and not go. Its the same of the metal mags. The metal mads don’t seat and hit the bolt guide in the front.

The 10rnd oem polys I tested today all worked flawlessly so I’ll be fine.

I visited my FFL yesterday and he cleared a few things about NJ law - in short L3I 13rnd mags or extensions are no go but he is allowed to modify and cap them to 10rnd.

I have asked Leon @Thesepaperwings not to ship them but if they are already shipped then my FFL will modify them.

I bought another CZ457 Varmint MTR for Base factory class so the 10rnd factory ones will work fine in that.

SK Rifle Match below just for testing mags - does better with Lapua or Eley

L3i also has them in 10 round capacity for regulated states. Not sure if you requested him to change the order to that or cancel but figured I'd mention it just in case.

NDR shooting sells 15 round alum mags, I took a chance and ordered one and an l3i 13 rounder for a build coming up to see if I can make them both work, or whichever one works easier
Thanks for the info on NDR, since they have 15-rounders for Tikka T1s. I’ve had a couple guys come and shoot those in production class and they gripe that there are no mags for 12-round stages.

I do recommend the l3i 13-rounder for CZ. Not having used nor previously heard of any other good metal mag that fits into the improved mag wells.

Is that the MDT extended catch release?


MDT Extended Mag Latch and Spacer Kit CZ452/CZ455/CZ457 - BLK

ETA: have you ever tried the 10-round steel mags from Czech Republic CZ in yours with that mag catch release? Just curious.

Hi and forgive me if I'm not asking the right person.... I'm new to the Hide and still trying to figure out how to find things and ask the right questions to the right people.

I just got a CZ 457 MDT Chassis and as mentioned earlier, it only came with one 5rd steel magazine.

Will top with Area 419 30 MOA rail (if it ever gets here) and an ARKEN EP-5 to start with and test my skills.

I'd like to purchase additional magazines and the L3I aluminum magazines look very good.

My question is: Will these work well with the MDT Chassis, and should I also buy an extended latch? (L3CZ-LTCH)

I have been shooting a Ruger Precision RF in .22LR and finally decided, after adding a Shaw 20 in barrel and a Timney 649 Trigger, that I should have probably spent more $$ up front and gone with a CZ, B14, Vudoo or RimX to begin with. (The Vudoo and RimX were and, most likely still are, a bit out of my price range, but .....) I want to see how I do with the CZ.

Really appreciate any and all suggestions as I get started with this new rifle.

p.s.
If I dumped too much info here, feel free to guide me in the "ways of the Hide?"

Thanks,

everything I've seen says you should be good to go with the l3i 13 round magazine. they seem like the best for us, plus they sponsor my local range. the mag release is personal preference and I don't have that stock so I don't know if it's easy to access as is.

Thanks Cody! Great to hear it's a company that supports your local range. The mag well seems roomy enough, but since I don't have the 10 rd mags and I haven't shot it (no rail yet) I don't know how well it will work. I think I'll order a couple and see!

Appreciate your response!

The L3i work fine on the ACC, but the longer mags do make it harder to get to the mag release (extended release only helps so much). That's why a lot of people notch the magwell or increase the opening size to make it easier to get to. The Gen 2 ACC has this build in for the CZ, but the Gen 1 didn't.

Womfat shows it in his video comparing the two chassis.

Do you know his reasoning? The actual law in NJ defines a “large capacity magazine” as “a box, drum, tube or other container which is capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition to be fed continuously and directly therefrom into a semi-automatic firearm.”

What is your question? The law you quoted just said the exact same thing as @Cyberbug007 posted and you quoted.

In short, NJ will not allow magazines with a greater capacity than 10 rounds. You may have higher capacity mags that have been permanently altered to hold 10 rounds or less.

he's saying because the cz457 is not semi automatic that law does not apply to that firearm, which would be correct if that's exactly what the law states.
one thing to watch out for is does that magazine latch into any semi auto firearm because that could be a dangerous loophole.
I don't care enough to look it up personally.

Fair enough. I’d have to read the whole statute section to know for sure though, and not just a cherry-picked excerpt. It doesn’t matter much to me though, since I’m not in PRNJ.

The issue for us shipping them to those states is that it also fits a semi auto rimfire . So we actually have 10rds that are in final assembly now as well.

Legal issues aside…

The L3i 13 rounders work perfectly fine in the ACC gen1 - in fact they are the best 13 round mags for that chassis as they intrude on available room to access the mag release the least.

If you can’t run over 10 round mags, then one of my mag couplers with the plastic 10 round mags is a great alternative.

I highly recommend an extended mag latch of some sort. I like the rounded paddle style from Anarchy, but my MDT one works great too. L3i is a great company - I wouldn’t hesitate to support them either.
