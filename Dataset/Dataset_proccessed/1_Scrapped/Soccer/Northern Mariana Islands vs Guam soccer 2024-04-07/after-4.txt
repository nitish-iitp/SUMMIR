Jay Eric Pfannstiel played trumpet in the New Braunfels High School band. He enjoyed music, but halftime shows at football games and band concerts didn’t satisfy the musical desire inside him. During his senior year in 1981, he decided to take up guitar and learn how to play some of his favorite country songs. Not long after that, his brother Matt Pfannstiel and friend Bruce Schwartz talked about forming a country western band. That was the venue his music passion was looking for.

Jay’s guitar skills were not ready for the performing stage yet, so he became the lead singer. With the addition of a few more friends, all New Braunfels residents, they decided to call themselves Blieders Creek, after the creek that runs through the northwest quadrant of New Braunfels. Later that same year, they played their first gig for a wedding held at the American Legion Hall in New Braunfels. The group, officially named “Jay Eric and Blieders Creek,” was now legit.
