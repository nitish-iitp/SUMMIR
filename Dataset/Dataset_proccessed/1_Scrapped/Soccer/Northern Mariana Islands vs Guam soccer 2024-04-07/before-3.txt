LKN vs GT (Lucknow Super Giants vs Gujarat Titans), 21st T20 Match Preview

Devdutt Padikkal has not been playing well. So, another player, Deepak Hooda, might get a chance to play instead. But, except for this change, there shouldn’t be any other changes in the team unless a player is injured. Unfortunately, Shivam Mavi is injured and won’t be playing any more games.

The team called Titans recently lost a game because their bowling was not good enough. They might change one of their bowlers, Umesh Yadav, for Kartik Tyagi. Also, they might replace one of their other players, Vijay Shankar, with either Shahrukh Khan or Abhinav Manohar. Finally, if David Miller is healthy, he will replace Kane Williamson.

Our prediction favours Lucknow Super Giants to win.

Pitch Report for LKN vs GT of Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow

Venue: Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow

Surface Nature – Neutral Surface

The pitch for the game is expected to be balanced for both the batting and the bowling teams. In the beginning, the fast bowlers might get some help due to the surface conditions. However, as the game progresses and the ball gets older, the spinners might get some assistance due to the ball gripping the surface. Batters will be happy to know that the outfield is quick and the boundaries aren’t too far away, which can help them score runs more easily.
