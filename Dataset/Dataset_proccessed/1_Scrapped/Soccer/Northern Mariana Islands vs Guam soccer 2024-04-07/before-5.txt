TO OPEN THE STAGE—Bullets take on Dedza
SHARE

The stage is set for the 2024 TNM Super League as four matches have been lined up on the opening day of the season.

But the peak of the day is the match between champions FCB Nyasa Big Bullets and Dedza Dynamos at Dedza Stadium this afternoon.

This is the official opening match of the season. Surely, expectations are high from the football fans this season In all fairness, the fans deserve to watch exciting, and entertaining football for their hard-earned money.

Over the years, domestic football has suffered from poor attendance due to several factors including poor quality of football and lack of marketing strategy.

For Bullets, they would be hoping to start their title defence on a high this season.

On the other hand, Dynamos have been tough customers and can crash any force especially at home.

Bullets go into the opening fixture, searching for their first win at Dedza Stadium having lost by 1-0 margins to Dynamos and Mafco in their last two visits.

There might be renewed hope in Bullets camp which has assembled a squad of experienced and young talent.

Coach Kalisto Pasuwa has signed seven new players ahead of the season including Nigerian Babatunde Adepoju, Zimbabwean duo Collin Mujuru and Ronald Chitiyo as well Lloyd Aaron, Innocent Nyasulu, Mathews Masamba and Sean McBrams.

However, McBrams is out for this afternoon’s clash due to injury.

Bullets Assistant Coach Michael Ngore said his troops are exercising caution ahead of the match.

“We have been winless in Dedza but that does not define anything coming into the new season. Every dog has its own day. We always strive to do well,” Ngore, who was drilling the team after Pasuwa travelled to Zimbabwe to sort out personal issues, said.

Bullets go into the match in high spirits after winning a seventh record straight Charity Shield following 7-6 win post-match penalties over Silver Strikers.

For Dynamos, despite losing their top goal-scorer Clement Nyondo to Mighty Mukuru Wanderers, they are not pushovers at any stage. They have also assembled a good squad.

Coach Andrew Bunya believes his side has all it takes to beat Bullets.

“This is a crucial match and we want to start with a win. We have done our preparations so the boys are ready,” he said.

Elsewhere this afternoon, Silver will begin their campaign against Chitipa United at Silver Stadium. Coach Peter Mponda will be looking for a perfect response from his players after last week’s post-match penalties defeat to Bullets in a Charity Shield match.

Moyale Barracks will host Mafco at Mzuzu Stadium whereas rookies Fomo will meet Bangwe All Stars at Mulanje Park.
