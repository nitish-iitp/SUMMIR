HUNTINGTON -- Marshall University women's basketball coach Kim Caldwell is the new coach at the University of Tennessee.

Marshall athletic director Christian Spears confirmed Sunday Caldwell had accepted the job with one of the most storied programs in women's basketball. The Vols have won eight national championships, second only to Connecticut's 11, and made 18 Final Four appearance, the last in 2008. All those titles were under legendary coach Pat Summitt.

Tim Stephens is a sports writer with The Herald-Dispatch.
