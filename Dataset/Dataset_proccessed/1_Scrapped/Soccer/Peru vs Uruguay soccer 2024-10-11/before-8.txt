5 - 9 October | Chicago, USA
Society For Neuroscience

Scientists from around the world congregate to discover new ideas, share their research, and experience the best the field has to offer.

Conference website

Listen to our product showcase, view our posters and meet our team!

Come and visit the team at our booth number #1545 to discuss how bit.bio offers partnering opportunities that affords access to the most relevant parental human cell types and corresponding disease models. These models are physiologically relevant and highly characterised, offering predictive, in vitro, human cells for early drug discovery, phenotypic screening, and high-content imaging applications.  

Panel Discussion | Monday 7th October 2:30 PM EST | Located Product Theatre #2, 1500 Aisle (Exhibit Hall)

"Tackling the reproducibility crisis: the need for standardised human cell models for neuroscience research, drug discovery, and therapies."

Dr Nicole Polinski, Director of Research Programs, The Micael J Fox Dr Foundation for Parkinson's Research
Dr Phil Mitchell, Director of Integrated Biology, Charles River Laboratories
Dr Paul Morrill, Chief Business Officer, bit.bio


This panel will explore how standardising human iPSC-derived cells can address the reproducibility crisis in neuroscience, potentially transforming research outcomes through enhanced consistency, improved reproducibility, andå streamlined regulatory compliance across drug discovery and therapeutic development.
