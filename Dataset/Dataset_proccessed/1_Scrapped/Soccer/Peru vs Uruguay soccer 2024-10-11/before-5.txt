Zygo Team Members Honored With Prestigious Aspe Awards At 39th Annual Meeting



(Middlefield, CT, USA – October 10, 2024) Zygo, a business unit of AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME), is proud to announce that two of its distinguished team members, Dr. Peter de Groot and Dr. Vivek G. Badami, have been recognized by the American Society for Precision Engineering (ASPE) for their significant contributions to the field of precision engineering. The awards will be presented during the 39th ASPE Annual Meeting, taking place from November 4-8 in Houston, Texas.

Dr. Peter de Groot, Zygo Chief Scientist, will be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award. This prestigious accolade recognizes his extensive expertise in optics and interferometry, as well as his unparalleled contributions to research, development, and education within the optics, physics, and precision engineering communities. Dr. de Groot’s remarkable career spans over fifty years, beginning with hands-on experience building reflecting telescopes and progressing through innovative work in experimental physics.

Throughout his career, Dr. de Groot has authored over 140 U.S. patents and more than 200 technical publications, tutorials, and book chapters, significantly advancing optical instrumentation and precision measurement techniques. His esteemed positions as a Fellow of SPIE, Optica, the Institute of Physics, and the International Academy of Engineering and Technology, along with his recent role as the 2024 President-Elect of SPIE, highlight his leadership and dedication to the field. Dr. de Groot’s ongoing commitment to education and his role as an honorary professor and keynote speaker within the precision engineering community showcase his passion for inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers.

Dr. Vivek G. Badami, Zygo Technology Fellow and Director of Engineering, will be inducted into the ASPE College of Fellows. This recognition celebrates his sustained advancements in ultra-precision nanometrology systems and subsystems for stage positioning in the semiconductor photolithography industry. Dr. Badami has made notable contributions to the development of high-end laser displacement interferometers, optical encoder systems, and metrology calibration fixtures for ultra-high precision measurement instruments. His leadership roles within ASPE, including President, Board Member, and Chair of the Education Committee, have earned him the society’s Distinguished Service Award.

Zygo is honored to have both Dr. de Groot and Dr. Badami as part of its team, continuing the company’s legacy of innovation and excellence in precision engineering. It is noteworthy that the three founders of Zygo — Paul F. Forman, Sol Laufer, and Carl A. Zanoni — were also recipients of the ASPE Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997, making this recognition even more significant for the company.

The ASPE Annual Meeting is renowned for its precision engineering tutorials, technical presentations, poster sessions, and business forum. This year’s theme, “Monetizing Precision,” will provide attendees with insights into identifying markets and strategies for achieving product-market fit for precision products and technologies.

Zygo is a global leader in the design and manufacture of advanced optical metrology systems and ultra-precision optical components and assemblies. The company’s products enable advanced manufacturing and testing in industries ranging from semiconductor and aerospace to research and development. The company extends its congratulations to Dr. Peter de Groot and Dr. Vivek G. Badami on their well-deserved awards and looks forward to their continued contributions to the field of precision engineering.
