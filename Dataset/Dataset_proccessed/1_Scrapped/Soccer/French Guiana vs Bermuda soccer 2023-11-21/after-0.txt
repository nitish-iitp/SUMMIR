Leverock On Upcoming Match, Team & More
November 21, 2023

[Written by Stephen Wright]

Danté Leverock insists the Bermuda national team are embracing the pressure as they prepare for their “must-win” promotion clash against French Guiana away in the Concacaf Nations League today [November 21].

Bermuda are top of group C, one point ahead of French Guiana and Belize and two points ahead of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines heading into the final round of fixtures.

Leverock, who was part of the Bermuda team that qualified for League A and the Gold Cup after beating the Dominican Republic 3-1 away in 2019, said his team-mates are confident of completing their promotion objective.

“We’ve probably made it a bit hard for ourselves, but it shows how far we’ve come in a short period that if we win, we’re in League A,” Leverock told Bernews.

“It’s a cup final for us. These are the games you want to be involved in – winner-takes-all matches. There’s so much at stake. It reminds me of the Dominican Republic game we played to qualify for the Gold Cup.

“A bit of pressure is good for us. We rise to the occasion. League A is where we want to be. We’re a small island, but we’re ambitious.”

The defender is one of the few remaining faces from the previous League A campaign, along with Dale Eve, Justin Donawa, Zeiko Lewis, Reggie Lambe, Lejuan Simmons and Roger Lee, and believes coach Michael Findlay’s new-look squad is taking shape and has been encouraged by the impact made by the newcomers.

“It’s pretty much a new group of players, and the young guys have come in and proved themselves,” he said. “Guys like Jai Bean, Keziah Martin, Ne-Jai Tucker and Remy Coddington, to name a few, have done really well.

“It shows the hard work put in during the past few years [by the Bermuda Football Association], getting these guys in environments where they can excel.

“They’re all technical and fit the way we play. It’s been a learning curve for the entire group – the players and coaches.

“We’re playing attractive football, and that’s encouraging to see. The future is bright for these guys.”

Leverock also saved special praise for his teenage defensive partner Harry Twite, who signed for English non-league team King’s Lynn Town earlier this season.

“Harry has a bright future,” he said. “He’s a modern-day centre-back. He’s cool, calm, collected, smart and quick. He’s in a good environment and will be playing league football very soon; I’m sure of that.”

The 31-year-old, who retired from international football before performing a U-turn, said he is enjoying his “renaissance” and will be available for Bermuda for as long as needed.

“It’s a different role being a mentor, and I want to be around for as long as possible,” he added.

“I’m in great shape, and I’ve worked hard for this renaissance. I’m playing locally, staying fit, and trying to win trophies with Dandy Town.”
