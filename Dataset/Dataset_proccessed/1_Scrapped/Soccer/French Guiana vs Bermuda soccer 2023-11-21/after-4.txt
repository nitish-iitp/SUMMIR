French Guiana Defeat Bermuda 3-0
November 21, 2023

[Updating] The French Guiana and Bermuda football match is getting underway and you can watch the action live here on YouTube, and we will update with the results once the match concludes.

Update: French Guiana defeated Bermuda, 3-0, at the Pierre-Aliker Stadium in Fort-de-France, Martinique.

The Concacaf match report said, “French Guiana goalkeeper Marvin Golitin intercepted a free kick service in the 17’ to deter any positive momentum from the visitors.

“French Guiana’s Albert Ajaiso struck inside the box in the 29’ on a second opportunity from a long-range hit by Zedan Charlec. Arnold Abelinti had a hit from outside the box in 45’+1 but was just wide of the mark.

“Loic Baal added the second in the 49’ with a header at the right post. Abelinti was influential in keeping the play alive prior to the cross in from left field.

“Joel Sarrucco added a third in the 90+4’ after heading in a contested ball inside the box.”
