Haïti - FLASH : World Cup 2026 Qualifiers : Haiti wins 2-1 against Saint Lucia (Video)
07/06/2024 06:43:09


	
Thursday June 7, 2024 for its entry into the 2nd qualifying phase of the Confederation of North, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF) for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Haiti faced Saint Lucia on the field at Widley Turf Stadium (Bridgetown, Barbados).

Starting eleven :
For this first match, French coach Sébastien Migné revealed the composition of his first eleven in official competition since his appointment.

1 Johnny Placide (C)
2 Carlens Arcus
4 Ricardo Ade
7 Fabrice Picault
9 Duckens Nazon
10 Derrick Etienne
13 Duke Lacroix (New to Competition)
14 Leverton Pierre
18 Carl-Fred Sainthe
20 Frandzy Pierrot
22 Jean Kevin Duverne (New to competition)

An excellent start for our Grenadiers who won [2-1] despite a difficult start to the match where the midfielder seemed confused and an uninspired game from the Grenadiers.

Ginola Elva, following a defensive error by Jean Kevin Duverne, opened the scoring for Saint Lucia, visibly more comfortable in his game [0-1] unfavorable score unchanged for Haiti at half-time

Returning from the locker room, the Grenadiers finally showed themselves to be more enterprising after the return of Danley Jean Jacques (46') in place of Carl-Fred Sainthé and Jean-Kévin Duverne made us forget his mistake in the first period by scoring a goal on a corner taken by Fafa Picault in the 47' [1-1] before being replaced by Mondy Prunier. More offensive, the Grenadiers put Saint Lucia under pressure but we had to wait until the 77' for the winning goal [2-1] from Duckens Nazon (his 30th goal in 52 selections) allowing the Grenadiers to collect 3 points.



Group C standings :
Curaçao occupies 1st place after its victory over Barbados [4-1] and Haiti 2nd place.

Calendar :
Haiti vs Barbados, June 9, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. at Widley Turf Stadium.
