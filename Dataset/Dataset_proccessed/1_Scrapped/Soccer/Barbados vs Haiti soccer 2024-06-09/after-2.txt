Break relations with apartheid Israel

The following is reblogged from the Caribbean Empowerment website – David, Barbados Underground
By A. T. Freeman

The inhuman savagery of Israel’s genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza has shocked the conscience of millions of people around the world, including in the Caribbean. From a policy of deliberate starvation and blocking access to water to bombing hospitals and ambulances, even going so far as killing thousands of children, Israel’s crimes have had no limits.

As a result, millions have come to understand the true nature of the state of Israel. This has been particularly so in the Caribbean, where for many years, there has been widespread confusion and misunderstanding that the current state of Israel is somehow connected to Biblical Israel.

Much of this confusion is the result of the deliberate campaign of disinformation that has been spread by the Zionist movement and its supporters, some of whom occupy prominent positions within Christian churches across the region. First, it is necessary to understand that the Zionist movement is a political movement that emerged in 19th century Europe in response to the centuries long practice in that continent of persecuting followers of the Jewish religion. This tendency towards persecuting people on the basis of their religion is not unique to Europe but it was certainly very strong there. However, it is also important to note that in other regions of the world, including Ethiopia, North Africa, the Middle East, India and Iran for example, followers of Judaism were not subjected to the type of persecution that was common in Europe.

IF YOU WANT TO HIDE KNOWLEDGE FROM BLACK FOLKS PUT IT IN A BOOK – THEN BURN THE PLACE TO THE GROUND – FOR WE KNOW THAT SINCE THE FIRES @ GREAT ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY (#PtolemyIII – 246-221 BCE) & AGAIN IN THE REIGN OF #JuliusCaesar IN (48 BCE) & THE UNIVERSITY OF TIMBUKTU FOUNDED IN THE 13TH CENTURY – HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS BEEN HIDDEN IN PLAIN SITE CONTINUES TO UNDERMINE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

Most Black people find themselves in a quagmire over what is going on in the land of Palestine, with many “UNABLE” to “OPENMINDEDLY” look at the veracity of the “EVIDENCE”, (both historically & “BIBLICALLY) & to do a really serious “DEEP DIVE” into how the world got here!!!

We didn’t just end up here – there are profound geo-poLIEtical factors, #ReLIEgiousEngineering & the last bastion & frontier of so-called #CivilizedMan: “HUMAN IGNORANCE” of the “SACRED PROPHECIES” as aptly noted in the “ORACLES OF HOLY SCRIPTURE” – subsumed by millions as just “HOCUS-POCUS”, until they themselves have the “ULTIMATE ENCOUNTER” – then suddenly, the wool is ripped from their blinded eyes!!!

The “CARNAGE” in the land of Palestine maybe an anomaly for most, where the world sits by and allows “ISRAHELL” to do as it pleases without “INTERVENTION”, but unknown to most (WITH A CAREFUL EXEGESIS OF ZECHARIAH CHAPTER 14 & VERSE 2) – #Prophecy tell us what will happen in the land of Palestine not long from now!!!

In Matt 24:2, MESSIAH told His disciples after they were trying to show Him the beauty of the “TEMPLE” in the afternoon sunlight – He opined: “Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another”!!!

THIS PROPHECY CAME TO PASS IN AD 70

General Titus, #EmperorVespasian’s son, “SACKED”, “PILLAGED”, “RAPED”, & “MURDERED” in vainglorious “RAGE” all who were left in Jerusalem & this was after that 3 year window, where 1000s escaped the city & “MIGRATED” to “EAST AFRICA”, “CENTRAL AFRICA” & to lands and islands afar off!!!

This time around, “JERUSALEM WILL BE AXIS OF WORLD WAR III” – where “ALL NATIONS (#NotSome) will be “GATHERED” to fight to the death…” Multi-MILLIONS* will die (notwithstanding the fiendish assaults upon the major cities of the world, where “BEDLAM, ANARCHY & CHAOS” will rain down into a “HELLSCAPE”, devouring many millions more – as brotha’ murders brotha’, in a clandestine “ORGY” of “BLOOD-LETTING”; according to Scripture: “the blood shall run down to a distance of 1600 furlongs – referenced to the size of the land of IsraHELL, which was often described as being approximately 160 miles long!!! (Rev 14:20)

MOST HUMAN COMMENTATORS REFUSE TO TOUCH THESE ISSUES DUE TO THE FALLOUT – BUT LET GOD BE TRUE & EVERY MAN A LIAR***

What we are seeing in 2024, is merely the handwriting on the wall for those who “KNOW” & “UNDERSTAND” the “SIGNS” & the “SEASONS” – for #TheLordGOD* does nothing without revealing to “HIS SERVANTS” – #TheProphets those things that “SHALL” soon come to past!!!

NOTHING IS GONNA’ GET BETTER – BUT CATASTROPHICALLY WORST AS WE NEAR THE LAST MINUTES IN EARTH’S HISTORY – BEFORE THE KINGDOM OF GOD APPROACHES & THIS CURSED, SIN-FILLED, & PAST-IT-SELL-BY-DATE WORLD IS WIPED CLEAN OF BOTH MAN & BEAST (leaving a “REMNANT” as it was in the #DayzOfNOAH*)!!!

With Russia’s Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine, Mia Mottley was quick to join the bandwagon of American propaganda in condemnation of Russia for seeking to protect its peoples from openly fascist neo-nazis in the West of Ukraine, acting as Western agents.

Some here then called for Putin’s death!

The same Mottley who is the leading cheerleader, presenting a Black face, as if a minstrel, for the war being conducted on Haití.

On the American-Zionist, settler-colonial war on the Palestinian people this same Mottley nor Thorne, for that matter, who prides himself as having gone to the Zionist state, on pilgrimage we suppose, have had nothing to say.

Readers tend to see what empire does abroad as dissimilar to what it has and continues to do at home.

Readers tend to conflate the wall to wall Western propaganda narrative with the true and brutal face of this wicked American empire.

In truth and in fact, whether it’s the genocidal wars which killed up to 100 million in the Western Hemisphere alone, its insistence that chattle slavery was to continue in Brazil long after 1865, the Jim Crow which came after or the racist attempts, especially in Texas and Oklahoma, but more generally, to maintain White supremacy at home and around the world, using fascist principles, nothing much as changed in 2024, as Biden had promised his racist oligarchs, while fascism continues to impose itself, at home and abroad.

The great professional historian Gerald Horne has adroitly made these connections in a recent interview while contending that the events of January 6 followed a long historical path and maybe be apocryphal of what’s to come.

Thank goodness, Horne is not a neoliberal sellout like Hilary Beckles and Mia Mottley. For both Mottley and Beckles emminently qualify as members of that misleadership class too liberally sprewn along the corridors of the Afrikan experience.

Certainly, the genocide in Palestine cannot be properly understood unless located with its historical context. Such a context clearly demonstrates the levels of wickedness constituting the tapestry of lies around us.

We are all Palestine!

¡Enter Gerald Horne!

Barbados will never break whatever diplomatic relationships it has with the Zionist state.

Unless, there is a stampede away from it.

Unless, it gets permission from international Whiteness.

Even as Belize, has not broken but has long withdrawn its ambassador from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem.

Instead of sending 600 soldiers or policemen to Haiti for the proxy war, it should deploy its considerably military might to free the Palestinians from bondage and genocide.

We’re talking about Barbados’ war planes, its submarines, its nuclear bombs, its fleets of drones, its hypersonic missiles, etc

I am hoping the result of the soccer match influence our decision about sending soldiers to Haiti. One cut-ass is enough.

Weeeee long predicted the destruction, collapse, of the Zionist state.

These conditions are now clear.

Historically, the only White settler-colonies which have survived are those which have totally or near totally genocided the majority or all of the indigenous populations.

America, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, most of South and Central America, North Africa, are the best examples.

With the Palestinians, equal to the Zionists in population terms, and with a demographic bomb firmly on their side, it’s just a matter of time.

Of course, the correlation of military forces have been dramatically shifted to their side. Of the Palestinians.

It was the Arabs who gave succor to these so-called Jews when Europeans were conducting pogroms against them, when acting on behalf of Europeans Hitler attempted to rid the world of them.

In this lies a lesson for Barbados – no good deed goes unpunished.

Of course, the British, the Portugués, the Americans, the Germans, the Dutch, the French, the Europeans more generally, committed gross atrocities against many populations in the global south not quite meeting the mark of completion.

It matters not how much trouble Netanyahu’ is in, the cabinet.

There’s a long history here.

Further, about 80 percent of Zionists either think that Netanyahu is doing the right thing in Gaza and the West Bank or he should kill more Palestinians.

Indeed, a good percentage thinks he should kill them all. Amolek!

Believe it or not Netanyahu is the moderate in this far, far, far right regime. A fascist state.

This is the direction of travel of all these democracies, so-called! Including Barbados!

@Pachamama,
Macron announces a general election after a poor showing in the European elections. For those of us not familiar with French politics. Macron’s party was relatively new when they won the general election. France like Barbados was governed by the big two: The party of François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac.

The Front National have been on the scene for a very, very long time. Le Pen was a storm trooper during France’s occupation of Algeria.

France like Europe has always flirted with fascism.

Kidacki Amsterdam

Will Mia Mottley sever relations with Guyana.

Several years ago Mia Mottley, Owen Arthur, Hilary Beckles and others, acting as agents of the American government, went to Georgetown and performed functions which supported the present Indo-Guyanese government, the then opposition, which brought them to power.

We warned them then that they were doing Shiite. That their actions would have led to the resurgence of hot racial tensions.

The case of Kidacki Amsterdam unearths a deprivations which Black people in Guyanese have suffered since they came to power with the help of Mia Mottley.

It must not be mere happenstance that similar features from the cyber crime bill as introduced in Barbados appears in Guyana and is seeking to criminalize Black Guyanese for describing the nature of the racist system being imposed by an Indo-Guyanese government on Black Guyanese, even if they are not in Guyana.

A cyber crime bill introduced by the last administration in Guyana. A party led by former president David Granger. A man lacking common sense.

This is what we warned Mottley about when she was imbued with an excessive zeal to interfere into the internal affairs of Guyana as a factotum for empire.

This Hindu racist Guyanese government is generally threatening to kill Black people, burn their homes, and inflicts all kinds of state sponsored anti-Black racism by a party which has a history, dating back to the 1960s against Black Guyanaese.

Mottley should be made to answer for this.

Miko Peled is the son of a famours Israeli general in the 1967 war. Peled also served his required period of serice in the Israeli army, the first year in an elite paratrooper, “red beret” regiment. Over many years he gradually became an advocate for a one state solution where Palestinians and Jews live in the land together and with equal rights for boths. After his young niece was killed in a suicide bomb attack, it left a deep mark on him and was an event which played a signifcant5 part in motivating him to look for a just and peaceful solution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

Peled says he first met with Palestinians on a regular one to one basis after he moved to the US and and got in touch with Palestinian immigrants or refugees in the US. As he met with these Palestinians he was struck with how normal these people were in their attitudes and behaviours, more or less he found he was encountering people who were really not that much different than he was, people who had the same concerns about loved ones living back in Israel/Palestine and wanting to find an equitable solution to end the seemingly neve-ending confict.

Peled says after meetings and discussions with Palestinians in the US, on his trips back to Israel he was warned by friends and family not to try going into Palestinian territories to meet with Palestinians, as if he was recognized as Jewish he was at great risk of being attacked and possibly killed by angry and vengeful Palestinians. He says he ignored the advice and drove his car, clearly identified by the license plate as being owned by an Israeli, into the Palestinian areas and started to meet and talk with Palestinians actually living in the region on a regular basis. He claims he never felt concerned that there was any threat to his life or safety. He says on occasion he takes Palestinian taxis and rides in Palestinian busses where he can start conversations with random Palestinians. He says he speaks some Arabic, but with a noticeable Israeli accent, so there was no way to hide his origins as a Jewish Israeli. He says contrary to the expectations of Israeli friends and relatives, he was not greeted with resentnent, anger or hatred by the everyday Palestinians he encountered in the territories, he was actually met with friendliness and hospitality.

Over the years he says he came to identify with the Palestinian cause and became an overt advocate for peace with the Palestinians, but on the basis of a “one state” solution rather than two seperate states one for Israelis and one for Jews.

This is a link to a recent interview with Miko Peled in which he and Kim Iversen debate the viability of a one state solution to resolve the conflict.

Where diplomacy intersects with hard power projection.

This week we ‘welcome’ a Russian flotilla of war ships and submarines to engage with their counterparts in Cuba as William Skinner’s Caribbean as a Zone of Peace again confront realpolitik.

Hard power projection appears where diplomacy fails. As Russia responds to similar deployments by the American led NATO’s similar expressions or perceived threats within the northeastern Atlantic.

For the Caribbean however there maybe more meanings, implicit. With the Mia Mottley led proxy war nearby in Haiti.

Added, the desire of the USA to turn Haiti into a sweat shop in the expectation that the coming war on China over the Chinese province of Taiwan would curtail consumer goods.

More distant, are the growing hemispheric-Eastern relationships with Nicaragua and others within the wider region.

More prescient, are President Putin’s determination to approach another context not dissimilar to the events of 1963 where Soviet nuclear weapons were stationed in Cuba.

Of course, this feign, and it’s only that so far, is intended to bring front of mind the similarity of the position the Russians find themselves in again.

Those circumstances relate to NATO’s intentions to checkmate Russia thereby making it more difficult for Russia to come to the side of China should these conditions become a hot war, as is planned.

Again, we must consider how there is any peace when our leaders continue to advance the proxy war aims of the Americans within this region.

Where American war ships and submarines are constantly traversing our region.

Where political leaders in Caricom continue to be factotums of an empire which only knows war as a way of being.

An empire which continue to argue that it has some divine right to rule the universes forever.

For peace has never been the absence of war alone. For war is the expression within the smiling face of a Mia Mottley as she acts to further destabilize Haiti, as an agent of empire.

Destabilize Guyana.

This weekend the Zionist regime continued its genocidal intentions with the slaughter of up to 300 civilians in a single incident, including many children and women, within a refugee camp in Rafah.

Rafah, the place where Palestinians were concentrated, in concentration camp terms, similar to Auschwitz, we imagine.

A joint American-Zionist operation meant to find captives held by Hamas, it always possessed the likelihood of advancing the genocidal aims of the leading genocidal regime the world has ever seen.

Plus its poodle in West Asia.

Well, reports state that they found three or four captives, killed another three and again sent the clear message to the world that the captives are immaterial to their war aims.

And their military doctrine clearly states this, clearly!

How many stinking Christians have said that this near nine-month genocide is so steeped with contradictions that their religion could only centralize these brutes if the most divine pact of lies ever told.

A set of lies written with the hand of these devils, under the pretense that some shy god had something to do therewith.

The deeper truth is that these Khazars were always like this.

THE 2 IMPORTANT TIMES OF ANY PERSON’S LIFE IS ONE’S BIRTH: THE OTHER IS WHAT ONE DOES WITH THAT LIFE

IN CHAPTER 9 OF JOSEPHUS’ WORK ON THE JEWS HE CITES THE DESTRUCTION OF THE JEWISH SODOMITES BY THE ASSYRIAN WAR

Josephus opined that “At this time, when the Assyrians had the dominion over Asia, the people of Sodom were in a flourishing condition, both as to riches and the number of their youth. There were five kings that managed the affairs of this county: Ballas, Barsas, Senabar, and Sumobor, with the king of Bela; and each king led on his own troops: and the Assyrians made war upon them; and, dividing their army into four parts, fought against them…”

“Now every part of the army had its own commander; and when the battle was joined, the Assyrians were conquerors, and imposed a tribute on the kings of the Sodomites, who submitted to this slavery twelve years; and so long they continued to pay their tribute: but on the thirteenth year they rebelled, and then the army of the Assyrians came upon them, under their commanders Amraphel, Arioch, Chodorlaomer, and Tidal…”

“These kings had laid waste all Syria, and overthrown the offspring of the giants. And when they were come over against Sodom, they pitched their camp at the vale called the “Slime Pits”, for at that time there were pits in that place; but now, upon the destruction of the city of Sodom, that vale became the “Lake Asphaltites”, as it is called. However, concerning this lake we shall speak more presently. Now when the Sodomites joined battle with the Assyrians, and the fight was very obstinate, many of them were killed, and the rest were carried captive; among which captives was Lot, (THE NEPHEW OF ABRAHAM) who had come to assist the Sodomites…”

MEN FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THAT ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES – FOR WHAT DOMINION HAS DARKNESS WITH LIGHT

“About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards God, insomuch that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with Sodomitical practices. God was therefore much displeased at them, and determined to punish them for their pride, and to overthrow their city, and to lay waste their country, until there should neither plant nor fruit grow out of it…”

THIS IS THE LOOMING FATE OF PALESTINE & THE OCCUPIERS OF THAT LAND – ALONG WITH ALL OTHER NATIONS WHO CONTINUE TO CURSE THE LAND WITH THEIR NEFARIOUS ACTIONS & BEHAVIOUR

Isaiah 24:3 makes it crystal clear: “People and priest alike, servant and master, maid and mistress, buyer and seller, lender and borrower, creditor and debtor… The earth will be utterly laid waste and thoroughly plundered. For the LORD has spoken this Word. The earth mourns and withers; the world languishes and fades; the exalted of the earth waste away.”

MASS DESTRUCTION IS COMING WHETHER THE NAYSAYERS, SKEPTICS OR DENIERS CHOOSE TO BURY THEIR HEADS IN THE SAND – FOR THE CURRENT ECOLOGICAL FALLOUT IS MERELY A SYMPTOM OF A MUCH GREATER LOOMING TRAGEDY ON THE HORIZON

Some time ago this writer was contradicted here in relationship to the new BRICS currency Unit.

SPIEF has just ended with agreement and firm determination that the New Development Bank will likely issue the replacement for the USD sometime in October 2024.

For it has been determined that the Unit will be issued by the New Development Bank (NDB) backed by 40 percent bullion and 60 percent of the currencies of BRICS+ members.

Indeed, BRICS has another 59 countries in thr application process. We are therefore likely to see a massive expansión. Not that it really has to.

Already it has 46 percent of global populations. A collective GDP larger than the G7. An industrial capacity times greater than the US and EU combined. And on and on.

So yes, it will not take the expected 10 years as many had anticipated but this year we will begin to see US 100 dollar bills blowing in the streets of Bridgetown with no one caring to pick them up. Weeeeeee jest!

But there shall a big sound as the giant tree is fell! Of this there is no doubt.

This represents a quantum leap in de-dolllarization. For it leapfrogs the alternative.

That alternative which attacks the primacy of the dollar by trading in national currencies between BRICS members, like has been the basis of Russia’s monumental economic rise, as measured by purchasing power parity, accordingly to the World Bank, rising to the fourth largest in the world. And this has happened under no less than 18,000 sanctions imposed on the country to cripple it.

Sanctions have always been a weapon of war. Yet there’s a man here from the North who still contends that sanctions against Cuba for 70 years have not be economically deleterious.

They have sown the wind by using a fiat dollar to steal the rest of the world’s production. Now reap the whirlwind.

The UNSC met today.

To consider a proposal said to be agreed by Israel and Hamas. This was a bald faced lie.

For both Netanyahu, a few days ago, and the Iraeli representative, at the meeting, gave the lie to Biden’s effort to impose a proposed agreement written with American hands.

What comedy.

An administration in Washington itself a function of AIPAC, the jewish lobby, after covering and sharing the genocidal intent of the Zionist now decides to act in the names of Israel and Hamas, by forging a proposal, against the express wishes of Israel, as a way of throwing Israel under the bus, as it tries to salvage Biden’s reelection hopes.

If the West is not collapsing, and real fast, then the sun shall rise in the West. Indeed, Asar is rising in the East.

Russia was the sole abstention as not even Hamas had agreed to the text of this deal. They too said several times that no deal was presented to them. However, all the elements demanded by Hamas have been included.

A dictator always get a his way!

This is amazing. Never in the history of the UNSC has such a parlour trick become established in law.

The vote passed 14 -0. Russia abstained.

@ Pacha
Be careful what you ask for !We all know the role Russia played during the Cuba revolution and defended the rights of the Cuban people as the wicked USA tried to destroy the will of the Cuban people.
This was an ideological battle with significant economic issues as well.
However we will not tolerate Russia , the USA or any other country turning the Caribbean into a war zone because we will send a clear message to all that the Caribbean will remain a zone of peace.
We are firm in our view that in terms of racism and the manner both Russia and America view Black people we must remain “friends of all and satelites of none.” the major war Black people should be fighting is against those who believe that the Black race is inferior.
Russia’s hands are just as dirty as America when it comes to racism against Blacks.
So is Germany and the whole of Europe.
We have work to do and rest assured that we would be fooling ourselves if we think that there is some godfather out there who is going to do it for us.
We must do it ourselves.

While we may firmly agree on your central point about the nature of international racism.

Knowing that Russia, since Peter the Great, has always tried to see themselves as Europeans even as the Anglo-Saxons continue to deny them that.

Weeee must say that this matter requires a more considered approach.

One, Russia over centuries refused participation in chattel slavery, colonialism.

Two, its recent Communist past gave it an entirely different orientation towards the third world. Ask a dead Paul Robeson.

Three, it was Russia which supported the Cuban led efforts in Angola which led to the liberation of Southern Afrika from Aparthied.

Fourth, Russia has a population made up of 192 ethnic groups. Most of whom are Asiatics types.

Fifth, Russia is in an area where Slavs are aplenty. They history has thrown up a, what we would call, a limited tendency towards racism.

Indeed, Putin and Lavrov have cited the racism Russia itself was subjected to in relationship to the Western backed fascist in Ukraine.

And we may go on and on.

But we, as Afrikans, cannot approach these matters expecting anybody to protect our interests. Assert our culture. This does not occur in international relations.

Saying we want a Zone of Peace in the region cannot have real meaning when the hegemon has long declared the Monroe Doctrine, still active.

Under these conditions we then can’t say that they are right, been right, nobody else must enter. The Caribbean as a militarized areas has been long declared. In World War 2 a British ship was sank off Barbados by a German submarine.

As men we must fight our own battles.

But to equate the history of Russia with that of the West, the Anglo-Saxons, seems an intemperate determination.

War games are the least of your worries.
What empire is worried about are the sophisticated weapons Putin has promised to send his friends in the region – Nicaragua, Venezuela and Cuba – as a response to what America and NATO have been surrounding Russia with.

These weapons will be as powerful as those surrounding Russia.

Where were these pleadings when Russia, for 30 years, was being so surrounded. And if that was unimportant then, how could it be so important now.

Did any Zone of Peace advocates act to avoid the obvious from repeating itself?

Why is it that nobody cares when weapons of war kill people in other places but when where they live comes under threat there’s a care?

Why is Mia Mottley able to destabilize Guyana, Haití, as an American proxy war agent and that’s alright, should not the chickens come home to roost

@ David
That’s our point exactly. Once we remain fragmented , we open ourselves to another round of slavery and economic strangulation. As we have repeated over and over , the best way to determine and or declare that we will remain a Zone of Peace , is to become one true Caribbean Nation State, and to speak in one voice.
No amount of intellectual hop scotch , can seriously deny this simple fact.

The region will never have a one foreign policy. You will recall when POTUS called a meeting of SOME regional leaders and the some attended causing embarrassment to the whole.

@ David ; @ Pacha
It is patently obvious that you are both determined to follow the same internationalists policies that you both to despise. @ David , when you say
that we will “never” have one common foreign policy, it shows an unfortunate negativity toward the regional project.
We therefore have hit a fundamental difference in how the three of us see
the future of the Caribbean.
We are reminded of some returning nationals, who find nothing positive in the islands because they have got so accustomed to eight lane highways that they forget it was our free labour that built those highways, They forget that all the roads built in the islands were original designed to carry cotton and sugar cane to the ports for export.
Those who refuse to acknowledge their past are destined to relive it. We assure that the future of the Caribbean will not be in the hands of the USA, Russia or China. A new leadership will arrive in the Caribbean and our region will not only feed itself ; we will also feed others.
You both seem to see our future via the same super powers that care absolutely nothing about us.
We prefer to see it through our people. We survived slavery , we will certainly survive and overcome our struggles.

Well, Pacha has been previously accused of being nostalgic about Afrikan history, cosmogeny.

You have our best wishes with this project.

Because others don’t see the possibilities for this like you do, let’s agree to disagree. However, good international relations with all country and a One Caribbean ideal are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

As a foot note. Is Martinique, Guadeloupe, and other none English speaking countries seen as the part of the Caribbean or France.

The Dutch territories.

This idea of Caricom could not even deal with Haiti, earlier on because of certain problems. Too many Haitians, failure to accommodate French. These problems can be multiplied.

Would there be Central or South American countries, not Guyana, to be in your One Caribbean? What about Cuba, Dominican Republic. And we go on and on!

We wish you more success than Grantley Adams had! This writer has other interests.

You are talking about a region that can’t agree to a common air space to support a regional transportation. A common single market etc to support a common monetary framework. There is a reality to support the skepticism.

“We are reminded of some returning nationals, who find nothing positive in the islands because they have got so accustomed to eight lane highways that they forget it was our free labour that built those highways, They forget that all the roads built in the islands were original designed to carry cotton and sugar cane to the ports for export.”

Technically slaves did not build eight lane highways. It was the working class.
The most radical black movement in US History was the Black Panthers who embraced Chinese Communism and Marxist principles.

“If revolution does not occur almost immediately, and I say almost immediately because technology is making leaps (it made a leap all the way to the moon), and if the ruling circle remains in power the proletarian working class will definitely be on the decline because they will be unemployables and therefore swell the ranks of the lumpens, who are the present unemployables. Every worker is in jeopardy because of the ruling circle, which is why we say that the lumpen proletarians have the potential for revolution, will probably carry out the revolution, and in the near future will be the popular majority. Of course, I would not like to see more of my people unemployed or become unemployables, but being objective, because we’re dialectical materialists, we must acknowledge the facts.”

— Huey P. Newton (1970)

Excellent observation again…

It is a CURSE boss! AKA- ‘brassbowlery’!
A spiritual affliction of idiocy, affecting otherwise normal folks, that defies BASIC logic.

Only a BB Jackass could even contemplate the current status quo – in the face of such OBVIOUS, COMPELLING logic, for a common political, economic and cultural TOGETHERNESS between a set of people with such SIMILAR backgrounds….
indeed, between peoples who are literally FAMILY.

The solution THEREFORE must obviously be a SPIRITUAL one,
..that deals with the shiite CURSE
..that removes the BLINKERS
..and that re-enables COMMOM SENSE to prevail…

“If my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, END THEIR ALBINO-CENTRIC ORIENTATION, and seek my face…… THEN….” (and ONLY then…)

As of tomorrow US dollars and Euros are banned from the Russian Stock Exchanges.

It was the insightful Bushie who appropriately coined these times as being the best to be alive.

These are empire killers.

Of course, some here will demure and locate them as at least of marginal import to the region.

However, the Spirit of the Ancestors have coded differently.

These death blows are the end of the end for the demons preying on humanity for toooo long!

The State of Palestine or the Palestinian National Authority has been recognized since Israel was 1948/9.

As a state!

It’s recognized by up to 143 members of the United Nations.

In annual votes this UN Resolution is forever being reconfirmed within the General Council.

The weakness of the system of international has prevented enforcement of sovereign rights.

This continues because the Zionists have 300 nuclear weapons and it would take superior military might to overcome these illegal weapons and enforce the rights of Palestinians.

Characteristic of states, since 1648, is the demarcation of boundaries. Again military force is the only practical means because negotiation has been, all this time, used by Israel’s protectors to kick this issue into the tall grass as more and more Palestinian lands are illegally taken by the Zionist devils and the settler-colonialists in the West.

Some here have remarked that Pacha always talking bout war. Well, how can such an issue be settled otherwise?

Evidence mounts that Netanyahu and top Israelil military brass had knowledge of the Hamas plans to invade Southern Israel, yet reduced surveillance along the border with Gaza and withdrew Israeli troops from the area just before the date of the attack.
