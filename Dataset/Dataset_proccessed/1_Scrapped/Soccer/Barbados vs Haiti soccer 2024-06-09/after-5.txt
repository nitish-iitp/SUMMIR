The sides meet for the first time in 10 years

Barbados host Haiti at the Wildey Turf in Wildey on Sunday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, looking to pick themselves up from their disastrous opening-day result. Ranked 177th in the world, the Bajan Tridents were crushed 4-1 by Curacao on Wednesday, powered by a hat-trick from Rangelo Janga.

Niall Reid-Stephen pulled one back for them in stoppage time from the penalty spot, but it was too little, too late.

It also extended their losing run to seven games in all competitions.

But on the other hand, the Red and Blues are playing their first qualifying games here. It also marks just their second outing of the 2024 calendar year, having last been in action against French Guyana in a friendly. The match ended in a 1-1 stalemate.

Head coach Sébastien Migne has called up a massive 31-player squad for this month's qualifying double-header against St. Lucia and Barbados, including key attacker Mondy Prunier, who has scored five goals in 10 games.

There are a staggering nine uncapped players in the squad.

The Red and Blues are winless in their last seven games, drawing four times and losing thrice.
Barbados have lost their last seven games in a row.

Barbados vs Haiti Prediction

Having beaten Barbados in both their previous encounters, Haiti will have the psychological advantage here, even if the sides are meeting after almost a decade.

On the other hand, the Bajan Tridents are on a low ebb following their crushing defeat to Curacao in their first qualifier. However, this has become a pattern for them since last year, having lost their last couple of games by a huge margin.

The Red and Blues, sitting 87 places above their rivals, should be able to nick this one comfortably.

Prediction: Barbados 0-3 Haiti
