Two FIFA friendly matches were played between Sri Lanka National Football Team and Myanmar National Football Team at the Thuwunna Youth Training Centre stadium in Yangon, on 10 and 13 October 2024.

In addition, football fans of Myanmar and Sri Lanka including the Sri Lankan community members in Myanmar were in attendance.
