How Turkey could line up against Portugal

Turkey manager Vincenzo Montella will make a late call on the fitness of Real Madrid starlet Arda Guler ahead of Saturday's Euro 2024 Group F encounter with Portugal at Westfalenstadion in Dortmund.

Montella celebrated his 50th birthday in style as his Turkey side secured a 3-1 victory over Georgia on matchday one, inspired by 19-year-old Guler who scored a goal-of-the-tournament contender midway through the second half.

However, Montella has revealed that Guler is "not 100% fit" and may not be ready to retain his place in the starting lineup. Kerem Akturkoglu, who scored as a substitute against Georgia, is waiting in the wings if needed, while Kenan Yildiz is set to continue on the left flank.

Baris Yilmaz will hope to keep his place as the central striker, although he faces competition from experienced frontman Cenk Tosun, while Feyenoord's Orkun Kokcu should get the nod to start again in the number 10 role ahead of Lille's Yusuf Yazici.

Turkey captain Hakan Calhanoglu is set to continue in a deeper midfield role alongside Kaan Ayhan, although the latter could be replaced by either Borussia Dortmund's Salih Ozcan or West Bromwich Albion's Okay Yokuslu.

Mert Muldur scored a superb goal in the win over Georgia and he is expected to continue at right-back, joining Samet Akaydin, Abdulkerim Bardakci and Ferdi Kadioglu in a four-man defence, meaning that Zeki Celik and Merih Demiral will likely have to settle for a place on the substitutes' bench once again.

Turkey possible starting lineup: Gunok; Muldur, Akaydin, Bardakci, Kadioglu; Ozcan, Calhanoglu; Akturkoglu, Kokcu, Yildiz; Yilmaz
