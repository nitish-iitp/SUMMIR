Group E final table

UEFA

Looking at this, it is pretty obvious to see why the Belgium players have left the pitch to boos.

They only just scraped second place in Group E and their gameplan certainly didn't safeguard them against a shock elimination today.

Extraordinary scenes at full time

Extraordinary scenes really: Belgium's captain instructing his players not to go to applaud the Belgians. De Bruyne has just been announced as the man of the match.

More boos, more whistles.

Tedesco not willing to face Southgate repeat

No repeat of the cup throwing incident from last night. Tedesco and his team did not get as close as Southgate did with the disgruntled England support.

Boos from the Belgium fans at full time

The Belgium fans aren't happy: lots of whistling and boos. De Bruyne was about to lead the players over but then though better of it.

Not a European Championship classic

Until the last five or 10 minutes, that was a really poor game.

Belgium were the overwhelming favourites to top Group E and they were awful again. Their fans, rightly, were very unhappy to see them holding the ball in the corner towards the end when they needed a win to top the group.

Ukraine can count themselves extremely unfortunate to be eliminated with four points, but they have been punished for their horrendous performance against Romania in their Group E opener.

Belgium are through; Ukraine are out!

FT Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

And that was the chance for Ukraine, it had to go in from Sudakov!

He and his team-mates are crestfallen in Stuttgart as their elimination from Euro 2024 has been confirmed. Belgium, meanwhile, have confirmed their place in the last 16 as Group E runners up.

Rebrov thought that was the moment

90+3' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

What a chance for Sudakov. Belgian opened up and allowed him to thunder towards the box, only for his attempt to scuttle straight at a grateful Casteels.

Rebrov thought that was the moment.

Sudakov shoots straight at Casteels after brilliant run!

90+2' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

Was that Ukraine's moment?

Sudakov ran and ran and ran right into the heart of the Belgium penalty area, but his effort — when excellently placed — was too central and far too easy for Casteels to save.

Arguably the biggest chance of the match, it had to go in for Sudakov and Ukraine!

Openda on for Lukaku

Getty Images

90' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

A late change for Belgium who seemingly want more pace on the counter attack as Lois Openda is on in place of Lukaku.

The wait for a Euro 2024 goal goes on for Lukaku.

Belgium playing for time

Getty Images

89' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

The Belgians are playing for time, much to the frustration of their own fans as well as the Ukrainians, but they could yet prosper on the counter. Players are cramping up. Castagne has just summoned a fine block and is on his knees.

The tension is mounting.

Bakayoko shoots just wide!

88' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

That should have probably been the game — and the group — wrapped up for Belgium.

Another counter attack, this one led by Carrasco, was worked to De Bruyne and he laid the ball off to Bakayoko. The substitute cut back onto his favoured left foot 15 yards out and aimed for the top corner, but could only watch it drift wide.

De Bruyne and Lukaku combine well, but Ukraine survive

Getty Images

86' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

De Bruyne has been the best player on this pitch by an absolute country mile.

His latest foray towards the Ukraine penalty area was an effective one and ended with him picking out Lukaku on the right-hand side of the box.

He then showed some sharp footwork of his own to get to the byline but his square pass towards Bakayoko was blocked. It feels increasingly likely that we'll have a winning goal here...

Casteels saves from Malinovsky's direct corner attempt!

83' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

Nearly the goal of the tournament from Malinovsky!

Noticing that Belgium were without a near-post defender, the Ukraine substitute swung his left-footed inside the near post and almost over the goal line, but for a sharp reaction from Casteels.

Some of the ball had gone over the line but, crucially, not all of it.

Ukraine are going for it!

81' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

Yep, they're certainly going for a winner.

Centre-back Svatok is withdrawn for right-sided forward Andriy Yarmolenko who has 46 goals for Ukraine. Oh, how he'd love a 47th here.

Dovbyk smashes into the side netting

80' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

It does seem that this was part of Ukraine's gameplan for the second half: trust in their defence for half an hour and then look for a winning goal.

More good, positive attacking play ended with Dovbyk twisting and turning in the penalty area before smashing a right-footed effort into the side netting.

Doku replaced by Bakayoko

Getty Images

77' Ukraine 0-0 Belgium

This should liven things up for Belgium a bit!

The very exciting Bakayoko is on from the bench and has replaced Doku on the left wing. Ukraine will have to be very wary of the threat posed by the PSV forward.
