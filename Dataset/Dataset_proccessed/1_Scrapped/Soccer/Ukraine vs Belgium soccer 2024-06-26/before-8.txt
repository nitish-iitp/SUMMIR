How Ukraine could line up against Belgium

Ukraine manager Serhiy Rebrov should have almost every player at his disposal for Wednesday's Euro 2024 Group E finale against Belgium, which takes place at the MHPArena in Stuttgart.

Despite finding themselves at the bottom of the pile, the Blue and Yellow need only win to guarantee their place in the knockout stages, as all four sides boast three points from their first two matches.

Friday's 2-1 success over Slovakia saw Vitaliy Mykolenko return to the matchday squad following an injury, and Rebrov may now see fit to recall the Everton man to the starting XI at left-back.

Mykolenko would form part of an otherwise unchanged backline with Mykola Matvienko, Ilya Zabarnyi and Oleksandr Tymchyk, who should protect goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin after he vindicated Rebrov's decision to drop Andriy Lunin.

Oleksandr Zinchenko has featured as a left-back for his nation so far due to Mykolenko's problem but could now revert to his regular position at the base of the midfield, slightly behind Georgiy Sudakov and Mykola Shaparenko.

Substitute striker Roman Yaremchuk was the man who kept Ukraine's Euro 2024 bid alive with a sublime touch and finish versus Slovakia, but Artem Dovbyk should continue to hold the fort up front from the first whistle, especially as Yaremchuk is one booking away from suspension.

The Girona marksman will no doubt join Mykhaylo Mudryk in the final third, but his club-mate Viktor Tsygankov is dealing with some discomfort, so Andriy Yarmolenko should reprise his role in attack.

Ukraine possible starting lineup:
Trubin; Tymchyk, Zabarnyi, Matvienko, Mykolenko; Sudakov, Zinchenko, Shaparenko; Yarmolenko, Dovbyk, Mudryk
