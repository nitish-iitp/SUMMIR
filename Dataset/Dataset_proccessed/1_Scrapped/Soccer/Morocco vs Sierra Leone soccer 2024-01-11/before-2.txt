Leone Stars have returned to effective training on Monday after their 5-1 defeat to Ivory Coast on Saturday. According to Coach Alhaji Foray he has cautioned his boys to avoid another defeat on Thursday against Morocco, describing the friendlies as a great opportunity provided by the SLFA to represent Sierra Leone.

He urged the players to improve on their game and always make use of the chances they have in life, especially representing the country in friendlies and international competitions.

Speaking on behalf of the players, Emmanuel Samadia and Kwame Quee said: “It’s very sad for our dismal performance against Ivory Coast. We would like to apologize to the SLFA, coaches, and fans. We promise to do out utmost best in the up game against Morocco on Thursday 11 January 2024, in San Pardo.”

I don’t know how many times I must say this, Leone Stars is a waste of national resources and we have seen quite enough to acknowledge the facts! Please let’s redirect the resources to somewhere it can do the greater good
