In preparation for the forthcoming AFCON Tournament, Morocco will face off against Sierra Leone at the Stade Laurent Pokou Stadium on Thursday. Leone Stars are geared up for a challenging encounter against the Atlas Lions, seeking to prove their mettle and establish a strong foundation.

Sierra Leone suffered a humbling 5-1 defeat to former African champions Ivory Coast on Saturday and are looking to bounce back with a strong win against Morocco.

A total of four times the Moroccan national team and Sierra Leone have met with a balance of three victories for the Moroccan team, while one duel between these two teams ended in a draw. The last time they met was in June 2003 in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier where Morocco won 1-0 against Sierra Leone.
