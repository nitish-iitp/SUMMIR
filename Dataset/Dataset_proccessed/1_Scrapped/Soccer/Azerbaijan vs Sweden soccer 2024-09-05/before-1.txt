Current UEFA Nations League Standings for Azerbaijan vs Sweden September 5, 2024

Sweden and Azerbaijan will play in the UEFA Nations League on September 5, 2024. Each squad will be attempting to climb the group standings. Group 1 is now led by Azerbaijan, with Sweden in fourth place and hoping to climb the standings with a big win.

Azerbaijan Results

Azerbaijan’s recent performance has been inconsistent, which may have an impact on how they play against Sweden. A rundown of their previous five games is as follows:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
11.06.2024	FI	Azerbaijan vs Kazakhstan	3-2	W
07.06.2024	FI	Albania vs Azerbaijan	3-1	L
25.03.2024	FI	Azerbaijan vs Bulgaria	1-1	D
22.03.2024	FI	Azerbaijan vs Mongolia	1-0	W
19.11.2023	EUR	Belgium vs Azerbaijan	5-0	L

Azerbaijan has shown resiliency in their home games against Kazakhstan and Mongolia, managing to clinch two victories in their previous five games. However, heavy losses to Belgium and Albania highlight their defensive frailties. The draw against Bulgaria suggests that Azerbaijan can be unpredictable, making it hard to gauge their performance against stronger opponents like Sweden.

Sweden Results

Sweden has also experienced a series of mixed outcomes in their recent fixtures. A rundown of their previous five games is as follows:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
08.06.2024	FI	Sweden vs Serbia	0-3	L
05.06.2024	FI	Denmark vs Sweden	2-1	L
25.03.2024	FI	Sweden vs Albania	1-0	W
21.03.2024	FI	Portugal vs Sweden	5-2	L
12.01.2024	FI	Sweden vs Estonia	2-1	W

In recent games, especially against elite opponents like Serbia and Portugal, Sweden has struggled defensively and let up many goals. But their victories over Estonia and Albania indicate they can take advantage of weaker opponents. This disparity must be considered when comparing today’s prediction between Sweden and Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan vs Sweden Head-to-Head

Sweden has a strong head-to-head record against Azerbaijan, suggesting that team has performed well in previous meetings. Below is a rundown of their previous five meetings in person:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
16.11.2023	EUR	Azerbaijan vs Sweden	3-0
27.03.2023	EUR	Sweden vs Azerbaijan	5-0
07.10.2001	WC	Sweden vs Azerbaijan	3-0
02.09.2000	WC	Azerbaijan vs Sweden	0-1

In this meeting, Sweden has won four of the previous five games, maintaining their historical dominance. Since Azerbaijan emerged victorious in their most recent meeting in November 2023, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming game.

Free Tips on Azerbaijan vs Sweden

There are a number of things to take into account when placing a wager on a game like Sweden vs. Azerbaijan because they could affect the result. You may make an educated choice by taking into account crucial elements such as the team’s performance in the last few games, past match statistics, and other relevant information. We’ve given some free picks to help you plan your wager for this UEFA Nations League match between the teams.

Head-to-Head Performance: Having won the majority of their previous confrontations, Sweden has a stronger record against Azerbaijan in head-to-head competitions. But as their most recent triumph against Sweden demonstrated, Azerbaijan is a formidable foe, particularly at home. This mixed record should be taken into account when predicting the outcome.
Impact of Injuries and Suspensions: Prior to placing a bet, always make sure you are informed on the most recent team news. The absence or injury of a key player can have a big impact on how well a team performs. For instance, Azerbaijan may have better scoring opportunities if Sweden’s starting defenders are out.
Home vs. Away Performance: Due to the familiarity of their own ground and the backing of the home fans, Azerbaijan usually performs better at home. However, Sweden hasn’t played well away from home lately, which could give Azerbaijan the advantage in this match.
Team Motivation and Stakes: Because of how important this match is to the UEFA Nations League, both teams will be playing with a lot of motivation. Sweden needs to win points in order to progress up the table, while Azerbaijan, the group leader, will be eager to maintain their position. The stakes may make the match intensely competitive.
Weather Conditions and Pitch State: The game’s outcome could be significantly impacted by the state of the field at Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium and the Baku climate. Sweden might be more vulnerable to rain and other bad weather that could hinder player footing and ball movement than Azerbaijan because they are not used to these situations.

You might be able to place smarter bets and understand the various facets of the Sweden vs. Azerbaijan game better if you keep these pointers in mind.
