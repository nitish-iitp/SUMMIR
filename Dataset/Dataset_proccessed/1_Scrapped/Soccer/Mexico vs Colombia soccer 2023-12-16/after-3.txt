HE HAS THE CONFIDENCE OF AN EXPERT

The striker, formerly with MLS Galaxy, Javier 'Chicharito' Hernández, shared his perspectives on Jaime Lozano's process with the Mexican national team, expressing his confidence that it will be successful. In addition, he pointed out that the 'Tri' players need to take one more step to reach the status of leaders in the national team. 
"There is a good group of players, I think that right now it's just a process, Jimmy needs to develop a little more. The national team is in a transition, in which there are many young players, there are also consolidated players, but I think they need to take that little step for Héctor Herrera, Memo Ochoa, Andrés Guardado, Miguel Layún, Héctor Moreno to exist".

HIS PLACE IS AT STAKE

With less than a year to go before the tournament, Jaime Lozano, the coach of the Mexican national team, known as 'El Tri', has admitted that the fate of his career with the Mexican National Team will be determined by his team's achievements at the tournament. This tournament will be held in the United States, and Lozano recognizes that the performance and results obtained in this event will be a crucial factor that will influence his continuation as coach of the national team.
"Surely (it will be in play). That's why I always say since the Gold Cup that I take it one game at a time, because you'd think this one is already through to the World Cup and I don't believe it."

A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

Pepe Toño highlighted the inclusion of new faces, as well as returnees, in the call-up, giving them the opportunity to showcase themselves ahead of next year, which will host the Copa América 2024.
"The new faces and the new faces that are here will be a great opportunity for many, a great opportunity for many people who have never worn this jersey before, you have to see it that way, it is a blessing to be here and when you have the chance to wear this jersey, whether it is a World Cup or a friendly match, you go out and give it your all.

SENSITIVE LEAVE

The Mexican National Team has experienced a significant loss, as Fernando Hierro has made the decision to withdraw from the project led by the commissioner president of the Mexican Football Federation (FMF), Juan Carlos Rodríguez. This development represents a significant loss for the national team and reflects Hierro's departure from the group of experts who supported and contributed to the development of the soccer project.

Watch out for this player from Mexico:

For this match, the player to watch for the Azteca squad will be the great Memo Martinez. The Puebla center forward is enjoying one of the best moments of his career, being an offensive reference of "La Franja" and possible new reinforcement of the Guadalajara Chivas, since in recent weeks the rumor about his arrival to Verde Valle has gained more strength, so the Mexican could shine in this friendly match and show that he has the makings of a national team player.

About the Stadium:

It is located in Exposition Park in downtown Los Angeles, California, United States and was inaugurated in 1923 and has hosted several major sporting events, concerts and ceremonies over the years. The Coliseum has twice hosted the Summer Olympic Games. The first in 1932 and the second in 1984. It has been home to several sports teams, including the NFL's Rams and the temporary Raiders, as well as the University of Southern California (USC) Trojans soccer team. The Coliseum was designed in classical style by John Parkinson and Donald B. Parkinson. It can seat over 78,000 spectators, although the capacity has varied throughout renovations and modifications. The name "Memorial" in its title refers to the fact that it was dedicated as a memorial to World War I veterans.

On the other hand, the Colombian national team arrives at this match with the goal of continuing to work on the current project, which is to qualify for the 2026 World Cup by the end of 2025 without having to risk their lives in the playoffs, as well as to arrive with the best possible level, idea and goal for the next competition in America, where the Colombians will seek to demonstrate that the time has come for the Cup to stay in Colombia. Likewise, this duel against Mexico will serve to measure the level at which they will face the CONCACAF teams.

Liga MX power with nods to the starting roster

It is worth remembering that due to the tightness of the 23/24 season, neither European players nor players who will play in the Grand Final of the Apertura 2023 will be called up to the Mexican national team, so now it will be possible to enjoy a totally different selection from previous calls, full of the best talent in Liga MX. Likewise, coach Jaime Lozano will be able to better visualize which elements could be integrated in an emerging way to the call for the next Copa América.
