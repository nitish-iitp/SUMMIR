Key player in Togo

Togo's best player at present is Djene Dakonam, a central defender who plays for Getafe CF of La Liga in Spain. Djene is known for his defensive solidity, speed and ability to read the game, which has made him one of the most consistent players on his team and a key part of the Togolese national team. He has been instrumental in keeping Togo competitive at the international level, and his experience in European soccer makes him one of the country's most important players.

Key player in Equatorial Guinea

One of Equatorial Guinea's best players is Emilio Nsue, a player with experience in European leagues, who has captained the national team.

Togo

The current soccer news in Togo is marked by its participation in the qualifiers for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Togo is currently looking to improve its performance after failing to qualify for the CAN since 2017. In their first match of the CAN 2025 qualifiers, they drew against Liberia, which earned them a point. They are now preparing to face Equatorial Guinea in a crucial match, as both teams are looking for their place in the tournament, with Algeria as the strongest opponent in the group

Equatorial Guinea

The team's coach, Juan Micha, has been instrumental in consolidating the team's collective spirit, which has allowed them to stand out despite not having world-class players. Names such as Emilio Nsue, captain of the team, and Jesús Owono are some of the figures that have maintained the competitive level of the team, which has historically been underestimated.
