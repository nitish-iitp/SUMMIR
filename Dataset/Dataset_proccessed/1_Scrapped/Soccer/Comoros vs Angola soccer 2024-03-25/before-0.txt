Comoros maintained their excellent form as they crushed Uganda 4-0 in an international friendly match at Stade de Marrakech on Friday evening.

Stefano Cusin's team scored two goals in each half with Rafiki Said and Faiz Selemani both bagging braces to help the Coelacanths to their biggest victory since beating Seychelles 7-1 in 2021.

It was a fourth consecutive win for Comoros, who remain undefeated since being eliminated from the group stage of the COSAFA Cup back in July 2023.

Since losing to Malawi in the COSAFA Cup, Cusin's side have drawn 1-1 with Zambia in the final game of the 2023 AFCON qualification series before recording a 2-1 win over Cape Verde in a friendly match, and victories over Central African Republic and Ghana in the World Cup qualification matches.

Having found the back of the net 11 times across their last four games, Comoros will be looking to enjoy another successful outing in front of goal when they face Angola on Tuesday.

The only time both teams met, the Coelacanths lost 3-1 to them during the 2022 COSAFA Cup.

Angola performed well at the last AFCON, but they have now lost two matches in a row heading into this clash with Comoros.

Pedro Goncalves's men lost 1-0 in the Cup of Nations quarter-final against Nigeria and have followed it up with another 1-0 defeat to Morocco in an international friendly match on Friday night.

Having won more games at AFCON (three) than they managed in the previous 12 games (two), Angola will be hoping they can build on that solid showing going forward.

However, they have now failed to score in their last two games despite scoring nine goals in their first four games at the Cup of Nations, an issue Goncalves will be keen to address when they face Comoros on Tuesday.

Twenty-five-year-old Myziane Maolida has netted in two of Comoros' last three games, making him a player to watch.

Said, who made his debut for the Coelacanths against CAR in November 2022, has scored three goals and will be looking to add to his tally against Angola.

Gelson Dala and Fredy reportedly asked to be omitted from the Angola squad for their two games in March, while Zito Luvumbo is missing because of a thigh injury.

However, they still have the threat of their marksman Mabululu, who scored three times during the last AFCON.


Comoros possible starting lineup:
Boina; Youssouf, M'Dahoma, Soilihi, Abdallah; Youssouf, Bourhane, Bakari; Said, Selemani, Maolida

Angola possible starting lineup:
Neblu; Afonso, Gaspar, Carmo, Fortuna; Estrela, Show, Maestro; Banza, Mabululu, Bela




We say: Comoros 1-1 Angola

Comoros' impressive form in the last four games is something to take note of and this will make their stock rise in the minds of their opponents. However, we think Angola have what it takes to stop them in this match.
