I remember when you first showed up, and like many wondered WTF is the Hide coming to. Over the years I like many others have watched you change into a totally different, & productive member. Your age back then gave you a much needed pass on here to achieve where you're at now, and many have commented off board, too your change.
The question still going around is have you sent those Baby Momma picks to @lowlight yet?
The one question I have now is how did so many here now that are double & triple your first day Hide age, achieve the amount of brain damage they have, yet found their way here? My guess is the wantabee meal teams 6 types from COD, are passing out maps.

People don't get shit just because they're new. They get it for being a gullible, stupid, spaz, and for lacking any common sense...just like in the real world among men.

"Remember, when you get to the barracks the guys who come up to you and want to be your friend are the shit-birds who suck and don't have any. The guys who ignore you or treat you like shit are the ones it's worth knowing and hanging with. It won't come quickly. You have to earn your place." - Any random E4+.

I wanted to fucking kill the guy who ended up my best friend at my first command. He was fucking brutal and treated me like total crap. They were all going out on liberty and asked me if I wanted to come. "Not if that motherfucker is going." Lol. I was in his wedding.

New guys, if they don’t ask really stupid questions or act like Rambo normally get treated rather decently. Best plan is to be quiet, make few but sensible posts, and don’t act like the billy badass, and any noob will do all right.

Seen lots of both kinds. Fellows that show up, ask a question (that hasn’t been already asked a thousand times) get treated as peers, new peers but peers. Rambo types get put in their place QU?ICK.

Persistence (right or wrong) is something that holds water with me. The question is where would he be today, w/o some of the shit as well as guidance, he received for here? Many are being raised in single parent homes & some in just foster homes. It could be the guidance they are seeking or need comes from other than family or day to day types.

Guess the reason I have more compassion for that type, was if not for a caring Cop & Judge digging deep in home issues I'd most likely been given a bullet or electric chair long long ago, had they not intervened, and changed my path.

Until you have walked that path its hard to fathom how just how far a little kindness & compassion will go.

Nobody was "mean" to me when I joined up.

At least I don't think so. Maybe they were. Hard to say. After nearly 20 years working with the animals in my trade... You usually just chuckle at a good insult.

I find the immaturity of this place endearing. I think I shall stay.

This is a place to learn. Sometimes, the hard way. Definitely will test your attitude and willingness to learn. Or, at least, STFU once in a while.

I have had Dunning-Kruger effect, now and then but not nearly as bad as others. But, at times, I can see where I was wrong and owned up to it and moved on.

It helps to remember this. You have a bad day in the Hide. Now, imagine yourself describing to others IRL that you are pissed because som guy called Senor Pendejo or Hugh Jaynus, or shortshriveledcockhangingtotheleft said something you didn't like or agree with. Go ahead and say it out loud. You are not getting through the second name without a snicker or giggle.

Perspective. We have different levels of experience and knowledge and yeah, mistakes will be caught at every turn. And some guys here excel at saying nasty things. Who cares?

When it gets to be too much, grab some commie targets and shoot them to smithereens.

You know why Texas does not float off into the Gulf?

Because Oklahoma sucks.

(I have to say that. I was at UT @ Arlington in 1982 and I have to give the Sooners grief whenever.)

I am confused. Are only unfriendly faggots welcomed here? You could have easily been a french bundle of kindling. I once knew a guy who was gay and he (not french, he was from Texas) would call a cigarette a fag. So, he said he was going to light a fag, which brought a different image to mind.

Or is false advertising? You were not the friendliest faggot but claimed to be friendly.

Or, friendliness has nothing to do with it and you are not a faggot.

All a bunch of damn words from old men on the internet pissing each other off.

The "friendliest faggot" moniker I gave myself was suppose to be a shot at Milo Yiannopoulos because he called himself the "dangerous faggot". He was in the media quite a bit at that time so figured I'd bring faggotry back to a more friendly level. As far as me being an actual faggot goes, the proof was the last time I did karaoke at a bar and my song was "Whatta Man" by Salt N Pepa. I fucking killed!
