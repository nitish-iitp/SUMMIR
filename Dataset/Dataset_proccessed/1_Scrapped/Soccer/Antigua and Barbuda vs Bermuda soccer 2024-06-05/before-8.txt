Bermuda football coach Michael Findlay is confident that his squad will acquit themselves well in World Cup qualifiers this week.

The team face two crucial matches, away against Antigua & Barbuda on Wednesday and at home to Honduras on Sunday, as they begin their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign.

Defender Caleb McDowall, who plays for Anderson University, has been called up to the squad for the first time and Findlay is pleased with the continued focus on youth.

“Myself and the rest of the staff are very pleased about our progress and the key steps we have taken as we look to continue to evolve into a top-12 ranked national team within the Concacaf region,” Findlay said.

“Our squad continues to develop as we merge experience with the youth so we may position ourselves in a long-term perspective and be able to transition effectively through multiple competitions and cycles.

“We continue to see advancements and the23-man squad we have selected for the June matches represents this vision.”

While Findlay is pleased at introducing more young players, he must do without the services of the experienced Lejuan Simmons, who was injured during the Fifa Series in Saudi Arabia, and Justin Donawa.

“It is unfortunate that we will be without two key individuals in Lejaun Simmons and Justin Donawa due to injury, but this is also why our continued expansion of our long list of players is essential to building depth in every position,” Findlay said.

“We are looking forward to building on the success of our March participation in the Fifa Series in Saudi Arabia both off and on the field of play, where we were able to focus on a number of key matters, which we feel will benefit us in our upcoming matches against some very formidable teams in Antigua & Barbuda, and Honduras who will provide us with a different set of challenges which we will encounter.”
