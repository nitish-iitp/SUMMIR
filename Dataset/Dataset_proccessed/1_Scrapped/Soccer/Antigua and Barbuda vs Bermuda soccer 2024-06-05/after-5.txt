Costa Rica v Bermuda: Group B - 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup

Antigua will play host to Bermuda at ABFA Technical Center in the CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers on Wednesday.

Antigua vs Bermuda Preview

The second round of the Concacaf World Cup qualifiers gets underway this week. The top two teams in each group of five teams will progress to the third round. Antigua and Barbuda and Bermuda are pitted against each other in Group A alongside Honduras, Cuba and Cayman Islands.

The Benna Boys are set to return to action for the first time this year following a disappointing run in 2023. They managed two wins in nine matches, drawing one and losing six others. However, they will take confidence from their previous two successful clashes against Bermuda (3-2, 4-0) as they take on the visitors.

Bermuda have played two matches this year, beating Brunei 2-0 and losing to Guinea 5-1 in friendly matches. Their last visit to Antigua took place in March 2018, ending in a 3-2 defeat. However, Bermuda have succeeded at the ABFA Technical Center once, snatching a 3-0 win in a World Cup qualifier.

Gombey Warriors are in a better shape ahead of this meeting. With three wins, two draws and four defeats recorded in nine outings, they could be a tough side to handle. The visitors will be looking to exploit Antigua’s weak form to claim an early momentum in Group A. Both sides were unable to progress beyond this round in the previous edition.
