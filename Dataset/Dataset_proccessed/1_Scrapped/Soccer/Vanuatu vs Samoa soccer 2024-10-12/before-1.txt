Headland got off to an inauspicious start in their 63-0 hiding against Montgomery Catholic. The Rams elected to receive the opening kickoff, but failed to bring the ball to midfield. There was steady loss of yardage until a tricky fake punt got them a first down. However the cheese continued to slide off the cracker. A fumble on the real punt put the Knights in charge of the ball at the border of Headland’s red zone. Catholic managed to bring in the opening touchdown in only two plays.

Catholic tied on 21 points each during the first two quarters, 13 points in the third and eight points in the final quarter. Under mutual agreement by the coaches the clock ran throughout the second half but the Knights still managed to top the 60-point total for the third consecutive game, a first in school history.
