At least 10 persons have been killed this Tuesday November 21 morning in Bamenyam, a village in the Bamboutos division of the West region border to the North West region of Cameroon.

Reports on the ground confirm that about 50 armed men believed to be separatist fighters raided the market square at about 7am, leaving at least 10 dead on the spot. An unconfirmed number of persons were also abducted, 3 shops burnt, a cargo vehicle burnt and others injured.

An eye witness CNA got on phone says the armed men alerted security forces before arriving but the gendarmes only arrived an hour later.

The attack comes less than 24 hours after Governor Awa Fonka Augustine declared that the West region is enjoying a relatively calm and serene atmosphere. He made the declaration in Baham Upper Plateaux division on Monday November 20, 2023 while opening the second semester administrative and security coordination meeting for the year 2023 in the region.
