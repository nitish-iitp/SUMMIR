World 2026 (Q): Cameroon upset in Libya
World 2026 (Q): Cameroon upset in Libya

A win and a draw: that's the result for Cameroon and Libya after the first two days of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers. After their respective victories over Mauritius and Eswatini, the two teams shared the points this Tuesday in Benghazi (1-1). Things had started well for the Indomitable Lions after Olivier Tcham opened the scoring from the penalty spot (34th).

But Rigobert Song's men were unable to hold on to their lead until the interval, when Abdelmunem Aleiyan equalised just before half-time (43rd). In the second half, the two teams were unable to make the difference, and ended up sharing the spoils. In the standings, Cameroon and Libya join Cape Verde at the top of Group D with 4 points. They are followed by Angola (2 points), Eswatini (1 point) and Eswatini (0 points).
