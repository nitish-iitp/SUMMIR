GAME NOTES | FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT COLOMBIA
• USMNT Starting XI Cap Numbers (including this match): Christian Pulisic (67), Tim Ream (57), Weston McKennie (52), Antonee Robinson (42), Matt Turner (40), Tim Weah (38), Gio Reyna (27), Chris Richards (17), Johnny Cardoso (12), Folarin Balogun (11), Joe Scally (10)

• Today’s Starting XI has an average age of 25 years, 237 days, making it the ninth oldest lineup deployed under Gregg Berhalter and third oldest since 2021.
• The lineup also averages 32.9 caps, making it the seventh most experienced Starting XI during Berhalter’s tenure, and second most experienced since 2019. Only the lineup that began March’s CNL Final against Mexico had a higher average cap number in that time (36.5).
• Gregg Berhalter makes three changes from the lineup that started the Concacaf Nations League Final against Mexico on March 24, inserting defender Joe Scally, midfielder Johnny Cardoso and forward Folarin Balogun.
• Christian Pulisic captains the team for the 22nd time tonight. The USA is 16-2-3 when Pulisic wears the armband. He also earns his squad-leading 67th cap, tying him with 1994 FIFA World Cup alum Mike
Sorber for 37th on the USMNT’s all-time caps list.
• Five starters will make their first appearances against South American opposition: Folarin Balogun, Johnny Cardoso, Gio Reyna, Chris Richards and Matt Turner.
• Making his 40th career appearance tonight, goalkeeper Matt Turner has earned starts in 25 of the last 27 USMNT matches for which he has been available in a run that dates back to Sept. 23, 2022 vs. Japan
in Düsseldorf, Germany.
• Midfielder Johnny Cardoso earns his third career start tonight and first since the 4-0 win against Ghana on Oct. 17, 2023 in Nashville.
• Tonight’s match marks the first time the back four of Joe Scally, Chris Richards, Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson will start together. It’s also the fourth time and second consecutive match that Richards and
Ream will pair in central defense.
• Tim Ream has earned 11 of his 57 caps after his 35th birthday, ranking him third most among USMNT field players after turning 35. He comes in behind Fernando Clavijo (41 of 61 caps) and Thomas Dooley (24 of 81 caps).
• Antonee Robinson starts his fifth-consecutive USMNT match, while Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah start their third consecutive matches of 2024.
• Gregg Berhalter is 43-14-12 in 69 matches as USMNT head coach. The USA is 1-1-3 in five matches against South American opposition under Berhalter.
• With 53,575 tickets sold as of Saturday afternoon, today’s match ranks third all-time for U.S. Soccer- controlled USMNT matches in the D.C. / Maryland/ Virginia (DMV) area.
• The USMNT is 3-13-5 all-time against Colombia, with the team’s last win coming in a 3-0 victory on March 9, 2005 in Fullerton, Calif. The team’s seven-match winless streak against Los Cafeteros is
currently the second longest of any opponent after Brazil (11 matches).
• Forward Josh Sargent (foot injury), is the only U.S. player not dressed tonight. Six substitutions are allowed in three different moments. Halftime does not count as a substitution moment.
• Today’s match will be officiated by Fernando Hernandez of Mexico. The USMNT is 2-0-0 in two matches refereed by Hernandez, which includes a 2-0 friendly win against Costa Rica on Feb. 2, 2019 in the second match under Gregg Berhalter, and the 4-1 World Cup qualifying win at Honduras on Sept. 8, 2021.
