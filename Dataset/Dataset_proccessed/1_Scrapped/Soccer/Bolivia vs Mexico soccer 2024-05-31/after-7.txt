Álvarez game winner pushes youthful Mexico to 1-0 victory over Bolivia

A 47th minute game-winning goal from Club Tijuana midfielder Efrain Álvarez secured a 1-0 friendly victory for Mexico over Bolívia on Friday.

Held at Chicago's Soldier Field, the match featured experimental and alternate XIs from both sides. Notably from Mexico's youthful lineup, eight players made their senior debuts.

Ricardo Monreal, one of the debuts, collected the first dangerous opportunity of the evening after his header hit the woodwork in the sixth minute. By the 11th minute, another El Tri debutant tested the net after striker Ettson Ayón forced Bolivian goalkeeper Carlos Lampe to make a crucial save.

Despite Mexico's early pressure, Bolivia would eventually take control.

Gradually gaining possession, the South Americans held the ball on Mexico's end of the field. In the 38th minute, that would lead to Bolivia's most clear-cut opportunity in the first half after Ramiro Vaca sent a shot that narrowly went over the bar of El Tri's net.

Mexico responded with two additional shots of their own but failed to alter the scoresheet which was held to 0-0 at the halftime whistle.

Eager to make an early impact after the break, Mexico hit the ground running with Álvarez's goal in the 47th minute. After a pass across the 18-yard box from Monreal, Álvarez controlled the ball and casually found the back of the net.

With tactical changes and substitutions, Bolivia once again began to wrestle back possession and momentum of the game. Nonetheless, head coach Antonio Carlos Zago and his men weren't able to register a single shot on target until the 86th minute through an opportunity from Cesar Menacho.

Moments later and after injury time, Mexico secured a 1-0 result in their favor by the final whistle.

Following Friday's result, both teams will each have two more additional U.S.-based friendlies ahead of the 2024 Copa America. While Mexico will take on Uruguay (at Denver's Empower Field on June 5) and Brazil (at College Station's Kyle Field on June 8), Bolivia will face Ecuador (at Chester's Subaru Park on June 12) and Colombia (at Denver's Empower Field on June 15).

At the Copa America, which kicks off on June 20, Mexico are in Group B with Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica. Bolivia are in Group C with the United States, Uruguay and Panama.
