Interesting duels to come

If facing a rival from the CONMEBOL area is something that really excites Mexico, we must remember that this is the beginning of a great preparation for the Copa América. The next friendly matches will be against Brazil and Uruguay, two of the three best teams in South America, and it should also be remembered that these two teams are making waves in the World Cup qualifiers, so they will surely be very interesting duels for the tricolor team.

Bolivia wants to spoil the party

The Bolivian national team will also be in the Copa America and although this South American team is more familiar with what is really the oldest competition at the national team level, they will have to start preparing themselves because they will face rivals from the CONCACAF area, so they need to study the enemy and the level they have in the northern part of the American continent. For this reason, there will be no better way to prepare than by playing a friendly game against the Mexican national team, one of the great powers of the Confederation.

Let's talk about Mexico

Without a doubt, Jimmy Lozano surprised everyone with his call-up for the Copa América because for the first time in a long time, the priority of starting with the generational change and finally saying goodbye to the Sacred Cows such as Guillermo Ochoa, Gallardo, Chucky Lozano, etc., was reflected. Likewise, this preparation game is very important so that the coach of the Mexican national soccer team can begin to make a prototype of the starting eleven when the Copa America begins. Also, playing against CONMEBOL teams will help Mexico to measure the levels it will face and be able to be at the level of the requirements.

Welcome to all of you!

Hello, how are you? Welcome to this preview of the Mexico vs Bolivia game, corresponding to the international friendly match to be held at Soldier Field on U.S. soil. In this game, the national team begins its preparation for the Copa America, a competition from which we have been absent since the 100th edition that took place in the United States and where we suffered a 7-0 defeat against Chile, so it is of vital importance to have a better role in this new edition of the oldest tournament at the level of selections in soccer.
