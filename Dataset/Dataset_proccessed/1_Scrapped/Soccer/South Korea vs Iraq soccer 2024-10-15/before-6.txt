Ninefold budget increase requested for Seoul World Cup Stadium's grass maintenance

SEOUL, Oct. 10 (Yonhap) -- Seoul City's facilities management agency has requested a ninefold increase in the budget for grass maintenance at Seoul World Cup Stadium, the agency's report showed Thursday.

Poor grass condition at Seoul World Cup Stadium in western Seoul, which hosts K League 1 and national football matches, has recently been a subject of criticism from both players and fans.

South Korea was scheduled to face Iraq in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying match next Tuesday at the stadium, but the game was relocated to an alternative venue in Yongin, south of Seoul, due to poor grass condition.

According to a report from the Seoul Facilities Corp., submitted to Seoul Metropolitan Council member Yun Young-hee, the agency requested a city budget of 1.55 billion won (US$1.1 million) for grass maintenance of Seoul World Cup Stadium for next year.

The amount represents nine times the corresponding budget of 170 million won allocated for this year,

Next year, the facilities agency plans to replace 8,500 square meters of the grass field at the stadium, a 4.5-fold increase from this year's replacement of only 1,885 square meters in the central part of the field.

The agency plans to stick to the same grass types for next year, consisting of 70 percent Kentucky bluegrass and 30 percent tall fescue.
