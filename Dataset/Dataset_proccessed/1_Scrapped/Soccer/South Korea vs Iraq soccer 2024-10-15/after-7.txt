We said: South Korea 2-0 Iraq
After keeping clean sheets against Oman, Kuwait and Palestine, the defence of Iraq will face one of the sternest tests in AFC football on Tuesday night. Even with Spurs' Son out of action, we expect that South Korea will have too much quality for the visitors, resulting in a third win of the Group B campaign for the Taegeuk Warriors. Read more.
