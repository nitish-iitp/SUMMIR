South Korea’s national football team beat Iraq 3-2 in a 2026 World Cup qualifier at Yongin Mireu Stadium in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, on Oct. 15. This marks the team’s third straight win under new manager Hong Myung-bo.

Striker Oh Se-hun (25, Machida Zelvia) scored the first goal, and his replacement in the second half, Oh Hyeon-gyu (23, Genk), scored the second goal. Midfielder Lee Jae-sung (32, Mainz) added the last goal to end the game at 3-2.

The victory brings Korea closer to securing their 11th consecutive World Cup qualification. Korea must finish the third round of qualifiers as Group B winners or runners-up, as only the top two teams from the three groups in Asia can qualify for the 2026 World Cup.

Next month, the national football team will play two Group B matches: against Kuwait on Nov. 14 and Palestine on Nov. 19.
