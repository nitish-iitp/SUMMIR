<image:caption>Bridgerton agreed to 'mentor' Featherington - who's secretly social pamphlet author Lady Whistledown - 'in the ways of confidence to help her find a husband, but when his lessons start working a little too well, Colin must grapple with whether his feelings for Penelope are truly just friendly'</image:caption>

<image:caption>For a young man who has spent so much of his life kept fiercely out of the spotlight, Barron Trump made his TV debut at a shockingly young age. (Pictured: 10-months old with his parents in 2007).</image:caption>

<image:caption>Eighteen years later, Barron is rather bigger - at 6'7, he looms over his 6'3 father - but still very much tied to Mom. He comes of age today, after a high-profile childhood that, if physically pampered, cannot have been emotional plain-sailing with such a polarizing man for a dad.</image:caption>

<image:caption>While some claimed to see a strong resemblance between Donald and Barron, nicknamed 'Little Donald', when he was a baby, others now insist that in one crucial respect he's very different. (Pictured: in 2020 at the White House).</image:caption>

<image:caption>He soon became bilingual, learning to speak his mother's native Slovenian so well that he could phone his grandmother - who died in January - and not have to resort to English. (Pictured: Barron held by his grandmother, next to his grandfather, in 2007).</image:caption>

<image:caption>In a since deleted post to Musk's X platform, Def Jam rapper Big Sean, 35, posed next to his new Cybertruck nearly two months after publicly complaining of delays with his preorder.

<image:caption>Meanwhile, among Cybertruck's less famous and influential aspiring customers, gallows humor about wait times has become one of many coping mechanisms. 'I ordered mine on October 1st, 2023,' one said. 'I'm hoping it will be ready no earlier or later than July 2027'</image:caption>

<image:caption>In a stark warning, England's chief medical officer Professor Sir Chris Whitty (pictured), claimed children's lives are at risk without the drastic plan and said it has 'enormous public health benefit'. Under the crackdown, which will be formally unveiled today in Parliament, kids born after 2009 will never legally be able to buy tobacco. The law would also hand ministers power to restrict the flavours and promotion of vapes in an effort to thwart the UK's child e-cig epidemic</image:caption>

<image:caption>Figures show one in five children has tried vaping despite it being illegal for under-18s, while the number of children using vapes has tripled in the past three years. Yet the smoking proposals have long been criticised as 'illiberal' by critics, led by former PM Liz Truss (pictured). Lobbyists now believe as many as 80 to 100 MPs are uncomfortable about the plans ¿ although it is unclear how many would actually vote against them</image:caption>

<image:caption>The Government believes that, if enacted, the phased ban will lead to 1.7million fewer people smoking by 2075 ¿ saving tens of thousands of lives, and avoiding avoid up to 115,000 cases of strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and other lung diseases. Mr Sunak has also insisted that smoking will not be criminalised, suggesting that Brits subject to the ban won't be fined for buying them abroad</image:caption>
