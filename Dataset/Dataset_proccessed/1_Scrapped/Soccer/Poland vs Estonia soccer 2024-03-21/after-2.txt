We said: Poland 4-0 Estonia
To say that Estonia earned a golden ticket to the Euro 2024 playoffs would be an understatement, and the gulf in quality between the two clubs should be apparent from the get-go. The visitors may have pulled off a giant killing of Poland 12 years ago, but with the Eagles recently proving to be an unbeatable force at home in Euros qualifiers, a straightforward passage to the final should await the hosts on Thursday.
