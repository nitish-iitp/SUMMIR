ITALY 2-2 BELGIUM: LEANDRO TROSSARD RESCUES POINT FOR VISITORS AFTER THRILLING NATIONS LEAGUE CLASH
BYEUROSPORT

UPDATED 10/10/2024 AT 21:29 GMT

It's all set up intriguingly in League A's Group 2 of the UEFA Nations League after Italy and Belgium played out a thrilling draw in Rome. The hosts were ahead inside a minute after Andrea Cambiaso gave the Azzurri the lead, and they went further ahead when Mateo Retegui doubled their lead. But back came Belgium, who got their equaliser from Arsenal's Leandro Trossard.

Belgium recovered from two goals down to draw with ten-man Italy in a thrilling match in Rome.
Italy were completely dominant in the first forty minutes and well worth the two-goal lead through Andrea Cambiaso and Mateo Retegui, but Lorenzo Pellegrini's red card totally changed the game.

The ensuing set-piece was as well-executed as any free kick you could see and Maxim De Cuyper's finish sublime.

17/11/2024 AT 23:11

The second half was completely different with Belgium on the attack, though Italy far from shut up shop, and a fine instinctive finish from Leandro Trossard saw the archetypal game of two halves end even.
Italy remain top of Group B, a point clear of France, with Belgium two points further adrift.
TALKING POINT - BOTH SIDES CAN TAKE MUCH FROM GAME OF TWO SIDES
Italy have rarely played as free-flowing and exhilarating football as they did for most of the first half.
Sandro Tonali has made a real difference returning to the side and his link-play with Retegui and Federico Dimarco had Belgium in desperate straits. The summer's travails seem a long time ago.
Belgium hardly got the ball until the pivotal minute on the match from when the referee returned to the pitch after viewing the sideline video and showed Pellegrini a red card, followed by De Cuyper's sublime finish.
After the naval gazing prompted by their skipper Kevin De Bruyne following their poor display in France, they will have seen much to like about their play in the second half in the Stadio Olimpico, albeit with the caveat of it being played with an extra man.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - FEDERICO DIMARCO (ITALY)
Italy's left wing-back is known for his freakish ability to shoot arriving high up the field, but this game showed playmaking acumen perhaps he has not always been credited with.
He played a perfect slide-rule low ball to find Cambiaso for the first goal and then a stupendous first-time volleyed pass to his fellow wing-back again led to Retegui's goal.
PLAYER RATINGS
Italy: Donnarumma 6; Di Lorenzo 6, Bastoni 6, Calafiori 7; Cambiaso 7, Ricci 6, Tonali 7, Frattesi 6, Dimarco 8*; Pellegrini 4; Retegui 7.
Subs: Udogie 7, Fagioli 6, Pisili 6, Raspadori 6, Bellanova 6.
Belgium: Casteels 6; Debast 6, Faes 7, Theate 7, De Cuyper 7; Mangala 6, Tielemans 6; Doku 7, De Ketelaere 6, Trossard 7; Openda 6.
Subs: Castagne 6, Lukebakio 6, Vranckx 6, Ngonge 6, Fofana 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
1' GOAL! ITALY (CAMBIASO) 1-0 BELGIUM! After exactly a minute the Azzurri go in front. A swift breakaway sees Dimarco exchange passes with Retegui then slide a perfect ball between keeper and defence. Cambiaso's shot was initially stopped by Casteels, but he netted the rebound.
20' GOAL! ITALY (RETEGUI) 2-0 BELGIUM! Brilliant first-time cross-field ball fizzed by Dimarco to Cambiaso and he turned inside his man before forcing a full-length save from Casteels. Retegui from a narrow angle finished off.
38' PELLEGRINI GETS A YELLOW CARD! Very much deserved, as he raised his boot in a challenge and his studs caught the Achilles of Theate. The referee is now checking for a potential red card though...
41' RED CARD! Pellegrini has been sent off. This is what Belgium needed to have a chance in this game. Roma's iconic star is sent off at home.
41' GOAL! ITALY 2-1 BELGIUM (DE CUYPER)! As good a set piece as you'll see. Tielemans took the free kick, passing to Trossard on the D of the penalty area and he teed the ball up for De Cuyper to curl low just inside the post.
61' GOAL! ITALY 2-2 BELGIUM 2 (TROSSARD)! An impudent finish from Trossard. The corner is headed back from the back post into the six-yard box by Faes and the Arsenal man flicks a finish inside the post.
