UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
BELGIUM 1-2 FRANCE: RANDAL KOLO MUANI STRIKES TWICE AS LES BLEUS EARN NATIONS LEAGUE DOUBLE OVER RED DEVILS
BYWILL CONROY

UPDATED 14/10/2024 AT 22:51 GMT

France claimed a hard earned 2-1 victory over Belgium in the UEFA Nations League in Brussels on Tuesday. Randal Kolo Muani scored a first-half penalty after Youri Tielemans missed from the spot at the opposite end before Lois Openda levelled on the stroke of half-time. Kolo Muani restored Les Bleus’ lead and Didier Deschamps’ side held on after Aurelien Tchouameni was sent off.

Randal Kolo Muani scored twice as France survived going down to 10 men to hold on for a crucial 2-1 win over Belgium in an enthralling UEFA Nations League encounter in Brussels.
The Paris Saint-Germain forward opened the scoring for Les Blues thanks to a penalty following a Wout Faes handball just 12 minutes after Youri Tielemans had blazed over from the spot for the hosts after a rash challenge from William Saliba.

As France looked set to go into half-time with the lead, a sublime Timothy Castagne cross from the left picked out Lois Openda who headed home the equaliser for Domenico Tedesco's men in the third minute of stoppage time.

FRANCE WIN IN ITALY TO SNATCH TOP SPOT IN GROUP FROM AZZURRI

17/11/2024 AT 23:11

Upon the hour mark, France had a Manu Kone goal ruled out for a handball in the build-up but just two minutes later saw their lead restored as Kolo Muani's header squirmed past Koen Casteels.
The pressure on France mounted late on as Aurelien Tchouameni picked up a second yellow for a foul on Tielemans, but Didier Deschamps' men remained resolute to earn their fifth successive win against Belgium and reach the brink of qualification from the group stage.
The result sees France remain in second after Italy's 4-1 win against Israel, but crucially it takes them five points clear of Belgium in Group A2 with just two fixtures left to play, including a tie with Israel who are yet to pick up a point.

It was an eventful encounter from the get-go in Brussels with five yellow cards dished out in the opening period alone - France picking up four of those as Jeremy Doku looked in menacing form.
It looked to be Tedesco's side who were going to open the scoring as Saliba slipped before slicing down Openda after the striker had cut back onto his right foot when seemingly in on goal.
After a VAR check overturned the incorrect offside call that came at the end of the move, Tielemans stepped up but saw his effort fly over as he searched for the top-left corner.
It was just 12 minutes later when Kolo Muani had the chance from the spot down the other after Faes' handball as he scrambled from the floor to make a challenge on the oncoming Bradley Barcola.
The PSG forward went for a lower-risk approach than the Belgium skipper as he swept his penalty into the bottom-left corner.
Openda's header on the brink of half-time brought Belgium level but it was just 17 minutes into the second period when Kolo Muani scored his and France's second with a header of his own following a brilliant Lucas Digne cross.
With captain Kylian Mbappe controversially absent from the squad and Antoine Griezmann recently hanging up his international boots, there was pressure on France's attack to step up and Kolo Muani did that with this brace.
In this end-to-end contest it was never going to be straightforward for France, and Tchouameni's dismissal made sure of that but Saliba and Ibrahima Konate rose to the challenge and protected their one-goal lead excellently in the closing stages.
The result all but confirms Belgium's spot as the third-placed team in the group meaning they will likely face a side from League B in a relegation/promotion play-off.
TALKING POINT - A TALE OF TWO PENALTIES
Belgium started the game the better side, with Doku causing Digne all sorts of problems, while Openda troubled an unsure-looking Saliba in the opening period.
They looked to have their reward for their bright start as the Arsenal defender brought down the willing striker but it was not to be as Tielemans saw his penalty rocket over the bar.
That felt a significant moment in the first half as the momentum quickly shifted to the visitors and in what felt like no time at all, they had their own chance from the spot and made no such mistake.

While Belgium were able to level proceedings, they were unable to take the lead and never threatened to restore the pattern of the game to its early stages.
If Tielemans had found his desired target of that top corner, Belgium would have perhaps had the wind in their sails and a confidence to pile the pressure on France, rather than suffer a momentary wilt that saw an almost lead turn to a one-goal deficit.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - RANDAL KOLO MUANI (FRANCE)
In a game of chaos, cards and questionable decision making, it required a calm head to make the difference and Kolo Muani provided that from the spot before using it to nod France in front. A crucial contribution in the absence of captain Kylian.
