Kylian Mbappé Should’ve Made This Decision Instead of Nightclub Outing Controversy, Pundit Reveals

Former Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappé has caused a stir in France after Didier Deschamps left the 25-year-old out of the squad for the UEFA Nations League matches against Israel and Belgium.

While Mbappé is recovering from a thigh injury, which likely affected his omission, it wasn’t the only factor. He was named in the squad for PSG’s match against Villarreal and even started the game before the international break.

However, the 2018 FIFA World Cup winner has faced further criticism after reports emerged that he had been spotted in a nightclub in Sweden on the night France secured a UEFA Nations League win over Israel.

For some, the French media might seem to be blowing the situation out of proportion. While the forward is in his right to enjoy the time off, the FIFA break offers players this week off before club football resumes.

Nonetheless, one pundit believes the Frenchman should’ve stayed in Madrid instead of traveling to Sweden.

“Kylian Mbappé clearly needed a moment to take a break, and that makes sense,” Kevin Diaz said Saturday on After Foot RMC. “If you’ve ever been an athlete or even just dealt with everyday life, you know how it can be… And especially for him, the level of exposure and pressure he faces must be enormous.

“We shouldn’t focus too much on his age or anything else, but that situation just didn’t seem to add up. It’s understandable that he feels pressure and needs a breather. But after the controversy, even if he had plans, honestly… He could have adapted to the situation. If I were his friend, I’d tell him to cancel it. He could’ve just chilled in Madrid.

“If he wanted to go out, do it in Madrid, but stay at home. Because, you know… Or maybe he doesn’t care, and maybe he doesn’t. But I think, once again, it just gives people the chance to stir things up. I won’t say we’re the worst, but the media is doing its job, analyzing and questioning everything. As supporters, we question too, and we have every right to do so.”
