Neighbours Belgium and France meet for the second time in the space of a month on matchday four in the UEFA Nations League on Monday night.

France have recovered from an opening day defeat by winning their last two, while Belgium have slipped from first to third since their win over Israel on matchday one.

A real Jekyll-and-Hyde performance from Belgium saw them take a point from the Stadio Olimpico against Italy on Thursday night, and they will have been massively disappointed not to come away with a win.

Domenico Tedesco's men were utterly dominated in the opening 30 minutes, going 2-0 down and at threat of conceding more, but Lorenzo Pellegrini's rash challenge saw him dismissed, and changed the entire shape of the game.

Belgium pulled one back instantly thanks to Maxim De Cuyper, Leandro Trossard then equalised on the hour mark, and the Red Devils claimed they should have a penalty and a red card to Alessandro Bastoni, after he chopped Lois Openda down in the area just moments later.

Italy kept 10 on the field, though, and would keep Belgium at bay for the remaining half-hour, but the draw does leave Tedesco's men in a decent position after three games, even if it could have been better.

Everyone has beaten Israel so far, and Belgium still have the two heavyweights to play at home, so they will feel as though they have the ascendancy, despite currently sitting outside of the top two.

These two neighbours are becoming very accustomed to meeting each other, as they faced off in France last month, and in Germany over the summer.

France won 2-0 in the reverse just over four weeks ago, and Les Bleus were successful too at the Euros, in a very forgettable 1-0 last-16 success.

Didier Deschamps has always had one over Belgium when it comes to competitive meetings, as his France side also beat Belgium 3-2 in the Nations League semi-finals in 2021 despite going 2-0 down, and they also got the better of the Red Devils in the 2018 World Cup semis.

If that was not enough to make the French feel confident heading into this short away trip, the fact they won 4-1 away to Israel in a completely dominant performance on Thursday should.

In neutral Hungary, France were in complete control for 90 minutes, as Israel's equaliser came with their only shot of the game, and after re-taking the lead four minutes later, the two late goals put some much-deserved gloss on the scoreline.

Deschamps needed a response from his team after the 3-1 home defeat to Italy on matchday one, and that is what he has got, with two wins from two, and another here should almost guarantee a top-two berth considering they still have to face the group's whipping boys Israel at home.

Romelu Lukaku was not called up yet again despite showing promising form at Napoli, with the striker claiming he had to stay at Naples to continue to build his fitness after missing much of preseason.

The ongoing rift between manager Tedesco and Thibaut Courtois means the Real Madrid keeper would have not been called up, but he is out with an injury at present anyway, while Matz Sels has also pulled out late with a knock.

Kevin De Bruyne is the other notable absentee, meaning Youri Tielemans is the only member of the 2018 World Cup squad still in the side at the moment.

It appeared as though Tedesco was experimenting with a three-at-the-back system in the first half against Italy before the red card, and even though they struggled, the lack of midfield options available could see him start with that again.

France are without Kylian Mbappe after he was perhaps rushed back too soon by his club following a recent setback, and he has therefore pulled out of this squad.

After being dropped following their 3-1 defeat to Italy, Antoine Griezmann then announced his international retirement late last month, stating he does not want to be part of the setup if he is not a regular starter, despite being one of Deschamps's favourites.

N'Golo Kante was not called up after missing his club side's most recent fixture in Saudi Arabia, while Adrien Rabiot's lack of game time at Marseille has also cost him his place.

After scoring off the bench on Thursday, both Bradley Barcola and Matteo Guendouzi could come into the side, especially if Deschamps decides to revert to three in midfield, after picking a very attacking lineup against Israel.


Belgium possible starting lineup:
Casteels; Castagne, Debast, Faes, Theate, De Cuyper; Tielemans, Mangala; Trossard, Openda, Doku

France possible starting lineup:
Maignan; Kounde, Konate, Saliba, T. Hernandez; Tchouameni, Camavinga, Guendouzi; Olise, Kolo Muani, Barcola


We say: Belgium 1-2 France

In more testing environments, France have not been great recently, with just six wins in 90 minutes across their last 14 matches, but they should just have enough to beat a weakened Belgium side here.

When playing 11 versus 11 against Italy, Belgium could not compete, and the 2-0 defeat in Lyon last month suggests they could struggle again here, despite home advantage.
