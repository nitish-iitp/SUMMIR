Nepal lose 2-0 to Yemen
  
2023-11-21

Nepal lost 2-0 to Yemen in the second match of the second round of World Cup Qualifiers at the Dasharath Stadium on Tuesday.

Yemen scored both the goals in the second half of the match as Nepal still look for their first points in the second round. Nepal had lost their first match to UAE on November 16 in Dubai.

After a dull first half display, the game thrust in the second half. Substitute Hisub Thapaliya shot straight at the keeper when he had the best of chances to give Nepal the lead in the 61st minute of the game. Yemen's goal in the 65th minute was ruled off for offside.

Yemen took the lead in the 73rd minute of the match through a wonder strike form Omar Abdullah Al-Dahi. Dahi wiggled past Nepali defender to bury the ball into the top corner with a sweet left-footed strike.

Rajesh Pariyar debuted for the national side when he replaced Anjan Bista in the 79th minute.

Yemen doubled the lead and ensured victory in the 90th minute when Mohammed Abdullah Al-Dahi dinked the ball over Nepali skipper Kiran Chemjon for the second goal.

The remaining matches of the Qualifier will now be played in March.
