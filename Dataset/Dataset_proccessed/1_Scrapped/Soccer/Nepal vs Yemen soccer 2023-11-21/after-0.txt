Nepal has lost in the first two matches of the group stage under the second round selection tournament of FIFA World Cup 2026 and AFC Asian Cup 2027.

Nepal, which is in Group H, was defeated by 2 goals against Yemen in the first home match on Tuesday.

Despite the strong support of the supporters at Dasharath Rangshala, Nepal held Yemen to a goalless draw in the first half but could not hold on at the end of the second half.

For Yemen, Mohammad Al-Dahi scored two consecutive goals in the 72nd and 90th minutes to give the visiting team an important victory.

Nepal will play its next match against Bahrain on March 21, 2024.

UAE, Yemen and Bahrain are included in Nepal's group for the qualifying tournament. Nepal is scheduled to play a total of 6 matches on home and away basis.

It is to be remembered that Nepal suffered a 4-0 defeat against UAE in their first match of the group stage only last week.
