We said: Italy 2-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina
Italy have not scored more than one goal in in five of their last six internationals, but they will fancy their chances of success in the final third against a Bosnia outfit who have conceded 16 goals in their last five matches, shipping at least two goals on each occasion. Seeking to enter Euro 2024 on a positive note, the Azzurri should have few problems securing a routine victory in front of their home supporters. Read more.
