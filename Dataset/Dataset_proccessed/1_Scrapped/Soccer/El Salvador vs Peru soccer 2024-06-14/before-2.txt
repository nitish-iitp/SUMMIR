Imagine a future where renewable energy powers our homes, businesses, communities and even our food production, creating a sustainable and prosperous world for generations to come. The solar renewable energy industry is leading the charge towards this vision and it needs talented and skilled professionals to make it a reality. This article offers a levelling ground for an ideal comprehensive apprenticeship programme which I envision to be suitable for solar renewable energy in Malawi.

With a duration of 12 to 18 months, an ideal solar renewable energy apprenticeship programme can provide a personalised learning experience that adjusts to your individual needs and progress. The programme can be structured into four phases, each carefully designed to build the apprentice’s expertise and confidence. The Initial Training Phase (three to six months) can provide intensive classroom instruction and hands-on training, covering the fundamentals of solar energy, electrical theory, safety protocols and industry overview. This phase can prepare an apprentice for initial certifications and on-the-job training, setting you up for success from the start.

The on-the-job training phase (six to nine months) is where an apprentice can gain real-world experience and develop practical skills, working alongside experienced solar technicians and engineers or renewable energy specialists. The apprentice shall be required to assist with installations, maintenance and troubleshooting, applying their knowledge and learning from experienced professionals. This phase is critical in developing skills and building the apprentice’s confidence in the field.

The advanced training phase (three to six months) offers specialised training in specific areas of solar renewable energy, such as irrigation and energy storage. The apprentice will also have the opportunity to earn advanced certifications and industry-specific courses, preparing them for leadership and specialised roles. This phase is designed to challenge the apprentice and help them reach their full potential.

Finally, the final project and assessment phase (three to six months) allows the apprentice to showcase their skills and knowledge by completing a comprehensive final project. The apprentice shall also be required to undergo final assessments and evaluations, culminating in certification and graduation.

The ideal solar renewable energy apprenticeship programme is meant to offer a comprehensive curriculum that covers everything one needs to know to succeed in this exciting and rapidly growing field. From the fundamentals of solar energy to advanced applications, the programme should provide a well-rounded education that prepares one for a successful career.

First, the curriculum should cover the basics of solar energy, including solar radiation, photovoltaic systems and solar panel types and configurations. The apprentice should learn about system sizing and design principles and how to apply them in real-world scenarios. The electrical theory and applications course should not be missed out to give the apprentice a solid understanding of electrical circuits, wiring and safety best practices, ensuring they are confident and competent when working with electrical systems.

Next, the curriculum should dive into the specifics of solar panel installation and maintenance, including roofing and racking systems, solar panel mounting and grounding, and electrical connections and wiring. The apprentice should learn how to troubleshoot and repair solar energy systems, and how to design and configure systems for optimal performance. The industry regulations and standards course should keep the apprentice up-to-date on the latest Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority standards, building codes and permitting requirements so that the apprentice can navigate the industry with confidence.

But the programme should not stop there. The apprentice should also be taught the business skills they need to succeed, including marketing and sales strategies, customer service and communication, and business planning and financing. The apprentice will need to learn how to navigate the industry as an entrepreneur or small business owner, and how to stay ahead of the competition.

In conclusion, the ideal solar renewable energy apprenticeship programme can offer a unique and comprehensive learning experience that sets apprentices up for success in the exciting and rapidly growing field of solar renewable energy. With expert instruction, hands-on training, and industry-recognised certifications, apprentices shall gain the knowledge, skills and confidence to thrive in this rewarding career.—Feedback: kennethbeni35@gmail.com
