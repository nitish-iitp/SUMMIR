We said: Gambia 1-1 Tunisia
While Tunisia are still ranked in the top 10 sides in the CAF region, their performances over the last year have been well below expectations. Gambia, on the other hand, have been steadily improving over the same period, and if they can find a way to tighten up defensively, we could see them moving up the rankings in the coming months. The Carthage Eagles are considered the favourites here, but we feel the Scorpions will be able to earn a share of the spoils in this one. Read more.
