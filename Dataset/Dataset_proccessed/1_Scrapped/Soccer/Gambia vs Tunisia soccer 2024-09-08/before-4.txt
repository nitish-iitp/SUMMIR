Omar Colley to miss Gambia, Comoros AFCON clash

Sep 4, 2024, 11:28 AM | Article By: Lamin Darboe

Captain Omar Colley is set to The Gambia and Comoros Islands 2025 Total Energies Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match today, Wednesday, 4th September 2024 at the Stade Abdi.

Colley was omitted from the squad to face Comoros Islands in the continent’s biennial biggest football fiesta qualifier match due to his late arrival at the camp.

He will be available for The Gambia and Tunisia qualifier clash on Sunday 8th September 2024 at the Stade Abdi at 3pm.

Coach Jonathan Mckinstry will be hoping to assemble a formidable defence line to contain Comoros Islands strikers during their crunch qualifier match.
