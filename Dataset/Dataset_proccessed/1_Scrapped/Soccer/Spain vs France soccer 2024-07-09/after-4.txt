Lamine Yamal and Dani Olmo overturned France's lead to send La Roja to the Berlin final and stay on course for a record fourth European title.

Spain have reached the Euro 2024 final after beating France 2-1 to remain on course for a record fourth European title.

La Roja went down after just nine minutes but quickly overturned the score with two stunners by Lamine Yamal and Dani Olmo in the space of four minutes only.

They will face England or the Netherlands in the Berlin June 14 final act.

They have now become the only team to have won six consecutive games in a single Euro tournament. Spain also broke another record, as Lamine Yamal became the youngest player to ever score in the history of the Euro championship.

Les Bleus got off to a good start as Kolo Muani snuck in between Spanish defenders Laporte and Cucurella to head in an early 1-0 after following a cross into the penalty area by the maskless French captain Kylian Mbappé.

Spain quickly found the leveller with Lamine Yamal with a stunning goal in the 21th minute.

The soon-to-be 17-year-old winger swang past Rabiot outside the penalty area to send a twirling strike into the top corner. Just four minutes later, Spain took the lead with Dani Olmo, who found his second goal in two consecutive games.

The midfielder masterfully snagged a headed-away ball inside the penalty area to bang a low shot that France's Kounde deflected into the net.

France rushed to find the equaliser but Spain sucked up all the air into their half leaving very few pockets of space to exploit.

The game got interrupted in the 58th minute as a man stormed the pitch in an attempt to take a selfie with Mbappé.

Deschamps ordered three substitutions at once in the 62nd minute trying to increase France's firepower as Barcola, Camavinga and Griezmann were sent on. Giroud too went in later as Dembélé made room despite being the most dangerous Frenchman till then.

Spain's goalie Unai Simon sent shivers down the teammates' spine in the 76th as he clumsily cleared away a ball directly onto France's Camavinga, potentially setting up an opportunity, which however Les Bleus failed to materialise.

Mbappé had a good chance to equalise with a speedy incursion towards the goal in the 86th minute but he slammed the ball over the bar.

Les Bleus dominated possession in the second half but couldn’t make it count. They seemed tired and lacking ideas towards the last minutes as Spain cruised towards the final whistle accompanied by the public's "Ole" to mark their dominance.

France's coach Deschamps: 'Spain deserved to win'

“We knew they were a great team, and they proved it again tonight," France coach Didier Deschamps said.

"Even though we were fortunate to open the scoring, Spain made things difficult for us.

"They were superior in terms of control and technique. The team that gave the best impression was Spain. So they deserve to win tonight.”

There was surprise in Munich when Mbappé took to the field without the mask he has been wearing since getting his nose broken in France’s opening group game at Euro 2024.

Mbappé had been complaining the mask was impeding him, and ditching it appeared to have an immediate effect as he created the game’s opening goal in the ninth minute.

That was the first goal France had scored at Euro 2024 that wasn’t a penalty or an own goal.

'I wanted to put it right there' says jubilant Yamal

Lamine Yamal was one of Spain's best men and sealed his performance with an outstanding net that made him the youngest scorer in the history of the tournament.

“We were in a difficult stretch after not expecting to concede so early. I just took the ball and wanted to put it right there. I am very happy," Yamal said.

“I don’t try to think about it too much, just enjoy myself and help the team, and if it goes my way, then I am happy (for the goal) and for the win.”

Dani Olmo was also key in Spain's triumph. “We are very close, just one more step to go" he said after the game.

"It is incredible what the team is doing. We deserve to be in the final, one step from glory,” Olmo said. “Whether it is my goal, or Koundé’s, it doesn’t matter. A goal is a goal. The important thing is that we are in the final."
