San Marino 1-2 Finland

“Joyous scenes all over the Italian peninsula, as San Marino scored their third goal in as many matches, Filippo Berardi slotting home a last minute penalty against Finland,” writes Kári Tulinius. “Pyry Soiri had gotten a brace for the Eagle-Owls, sparing their blushes.”

Italy were the better team for most of the game: dynamic, aggressive and desperate to score, even though they knew a goalless draw was enough. But Ukraine came on strong in the last 20 minutes and had a very strong penalty appeal turned down in added time when Mykhailo Mudryk went flying after a challenge from Bryan Cristante.

VAR wasn’t interested, so Ukraine have to settle a place in the playoffs next March. Italy will defend their trophy in June and, hopefully for them, July.

90+4 min: No penalty! I’m not even sure it was checked by VAR. Cristante looks pretty fortunate there – Mudryk may have been looking for it but Cristante seemed to trip him.

90+3 min: Huge penalty appeal for Ukraine! Mudryk beats Cristante to Zubkov’s low cross in the area and goes over. The referee waves play on but it will be checked by VAR. That looked like a foul to me.

62 min “How is this game still 0-0,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “By the way, do I see three or four Chiesas on the field - he is everywhere.”

You can see why Liverpool are linked with him all the time. As well as being indecently talented, his energy and hunger are right up Jurgen Klopp’s street.

“I agree with you that the story of the match so far is Italy’s baffling inability to score, but Ukraine have shown flashes of quality while generally conserving energy,” says Kári Tulinius. “If Italy keep playing at that kind of tempo, they’ll eventually get tired, and Ukraine could hurt them.”

Indeed. It really is beautifully poised.

Half time: Ukraine 0-0 Italy

A 0-0 draw is enough for Italy to reach Euro 2024, so plenty of people will nod sagely upon seeing this scoreline. But anyone who watched an exhilarating first half knows that a goalless draw is the last thing on Italy’s mind. They attacked relentlessly and had a number of near misses. Ukraine struggled to get out – but when they did the pace of Mudryk and the craft of Sudakov made them dangerous, and Donnarumma had as many saves to make as his opposite number Trubin.

See you in 10 minutes for the second half, when one team will qualify for next summer’s tournament and the other will be catapulted into the playoffs.

44 min Jorginho is robbed in a dangerous area by Sudakov, who moves from centre to right and clips a cross that takes a slight touch off an Italian defender, thus wrongfooting the unmarked Mudryk at the far post.

42 min Chiesa goes on another thrilling run into the area from the left. Eventually he’s crowded out but Ukraine struggled to clear the ball. Barella hits a rasper from the edge of the D that is blocked by Svatok, then Frattesi’s follow-up hits his teammate Raspadori.

39 min “Hagler v Hearns could be many teams, but Italy and Ukraine have been involved in some of the worst games of all time,” says Justin Kavanagh. “The world has gone mad when you can’t even rely on the Italians for 90 minutes of cagey fliphousery and a late stolen goal. But Sir Alex did warn us to always check under the sauce.”

Or under the bald head of Luciano Spaletti, whose teams have always played aggressive, often exhilarating football.
