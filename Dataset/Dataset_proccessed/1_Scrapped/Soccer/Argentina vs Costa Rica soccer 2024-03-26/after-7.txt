Ángel Di María, Julián Álvarez and Alejandro Garnacho all start for Argentina vs. Costa Rica.

Argentina national team coach Lionel Scaloni has made changes to the team which won 3-0 vs. El Salvador. Ángel Di María starts with Julián Álvarez and Alejandro Garnacho in attack.

Emiliano Martínez is on the bench with Walter Benítez getting his first start for Argentina. The back line is the same one that started the World Cup final.

Enzo Fernández, Gio Lo Celso and Alexis Mac Allister are the three players in front of them. Here is the starting eleven:

Walter Benítez, Nicolás Tagliafico, Nicolás Otamendi, Cristian Romero, Nahuel Molina; Enzo Fernández, Gio Lo Celso, Alexis Mac Allister; Alejandro Garnacho, Julián Álvarez and Ángel Di María

My favorite thing about this team is how we press and try to win the ball back when we lose it. This disrupts the play of the opposition. I’m so glad we finally have a lot of midfield options available. I hope we can discover more wing backs who are as good as Zanetti and Sorin.

Lisandro martinez fitness will be crucial for copa



shOvwar March 27, 2024 At 1:06 am

El Toro our Poacher Royale is back.



Tony Montana March 27, 2024 At 1:06 am

•Garnacho > Nico Gonzalez
•we need Dimaria to play longer than just this summer. STILL ELITE
•Otamendi will start until Lisandro Martinez is consistently healthy. He may be slower than before but his awareness is STILL world class. (Because of our attacking style with our center backs playing up; all opponents will go over the top of our center defenders to exploit the movement up the field.)
•Player of the match was Navas. the game would have been 8-0 without him.
•Benitez had one job to do and failed. He should have punched it outside and not into path of opponent.
• disappointed in Julian Alvarez’s performance
• locelso is our 4th best midfielder behind Enzo, DePaul, macallister.



FalCon March 27, 2024 At 1:12 am

bro stop the job of complaining walter has nothing to do with that goal.. in case of reflex saves goalkeeper doesn’t predicts where the ball is going after the save.. its otamendi’s fault that he is not tracking that number 9 properly… the only thing that walter has to work on is his ball catching ability…



Godin11 March 27, 2024 At 1:04 am

Carboni is better than Buonanotte, Scaloni should take carboni to copa instead of Buonanotte



Tony Montana March 27, 2024 At 1:06 am

He played much better tonight than buonanotte Friday.



Nabeelamigoz March 27, 2024 At 1:08 am

I was surprised to see buonanotte in the squad carboni, matias soule,nico paz, echveri are mills ahead of him
Just bcz he was lucky to pick by brighton doesnt mean he is superior talent



Ricky Villa March 27, 2024 At 1:44 am

Carboni



Asaph Mark March 27, 2024 At 3:37 am

I agree. Bounanonte is just ok player. Carboni, Echeverri,Soule are superior c/f to Bounanonte.



Nabeelamigoz March 27, 2024 At 1:04 am

V. Cabini showing what he is capable of  he and nico pazz gonna rule football
Nico gonzales unprofessional casual walking gonna be trend on football fun videos he deserve that



FalCon March 27, 2024 At 1:03 am

that hilarious from nico gonzalez…



Ricky Villa March 27, 2024 At 1:47 am

Yes, how come he just did not finish his run til’ the end ? As if u don’t play your chances til’ the end, well that’s what u will end up! Pootår Nico indeed



karl March 27, 2024 At 1:03 am

Carboni looks very sharp and mature. He fits our styles perfectly and should be ahead of Garnacho in our squad.



FalCon March 27, 2024 At 1:07 am

thats not true..garnacho is a pure raw talent.it’s true that his playing still in united is way different from the national team.. if he moves to madrid he will be benifitted…



Albiceleste_Seattle March 27, 2024 At 1:01 am

Valentin Carboni will be our star at World Cup 2030



karl March 27, 2024 At 1:03 am

He will be a star in 2026.



Avi March 27, 2024 At 1:01 am

Nico Gonzalez = Talented Joker



Cleanball March 27, 2024 At 12:59 am

El Toro is back to find the net



Cleanball March 27, 2024 At 12:55 am

Angel Di Maria’s freekick absolutely brilliant !
A good game, a lot of learning lessons and time to be well prepared, few names have to write off from the team



Nabeelamigoz March 27, 2024 At 12:38 am

Molina+marria is gold wish to see barco+garnacho



shOvwar March 27, 2024 At 12:26 am

Thats more like a champion. 2-1. Came back.
Lets get more now.
That was a musical head passing.



San Isidro March 27, 2024 At 12:22 am

I don’t understand the Garnacho hate. Of all our problems he is the least. Start with Otamendi, and then Lo Celso who isn’t a good fit with Enzo and MacAllister. And yes MacAllister needs to be further up and Enzo a bit back.
The other thing that is killing us is Lautaro can’t buy a goal to save his life



shOvwar March 27, 2024 At 12:24 am

Garnacho is raw and doing good so far. Lets get RDP take off GLC.
Perez for Otamendi. Also get Barco at some point.



Albiceleste_Seattle March 27, 2024 At 1:02 am

The kid tried and had some good plays! That’s very encouraging!



karl March 27, 2024 At 1:04 am

Garnacho worked very hard today. I like him 1000000 times more than fraudulent Nico.



shOvwar March 27, 2024 At 12:21 am

Angel to the rescue again 
What a strike.



soumya March 27, 2024 At 12:18 am

Enzo is playing as per expectations these days. To play as a DM you need defensive skills.



shOvwar March 27, 2024 At 12:13 am

I see Garnacho can run but no one is picking on it and utilize it. Missing the GOAT.



iman March 27, 2024 At 12:07 am

It seems we have to search new coach after copa,scaloni fear to play new talented young player



FalCon March 27, 2024 At 12:04 am

what a game by paolo maldini’s heir (otamendi)…still scaloni and co belives that he will be in his prime in the upcoming copa america.. if it would have been spain or gemany they would have scored 2-3 goals by now… no creativity from midfield only sideways passing.. enzo’s game is degrading day by day.. the only thing to cherish about is garnacho’s performance..that kid way way better than nico gonzalez..



Godin11 March 27, 2024 At 12:06 am

Otamendi been first choice centre back for Argentina nt it’s criminal it self



FalCon March 27, 2024 At 12:09 am

if scaloni still rely on him.. it’s difficult for us to defend the copa america..
I am feeling bad for walter benitez some nonsense will blame him for that goal..



Danieldani March 27, 2024 At 12:03 am

Otamendi is done. But he does not even talk about retirement like Angel what a selfish prick. I hate him never liked him he almost cost us the World Cup but he keeps playing. and there is Lo Celso people treat him as if he has the talent of Aimer, Ortega, or Pastore but he is the biggest fraud. Molina has lost form recently it happens there should be a backup. Alvarez and Lautaro need to start scoring we need to start thinking about playing CBs in fullback position because there seems to be a lack of up-and-coming FBs other than Barco



Nabeelamigoz March 26, 2024 At 11:59 pm

RDP coming out and talking with officials his sprit is missing from the team
Lo celso trying to be cute looks to dribble 11
And enzo trying to be a super star shooting at everything 
Otta is slowing for sure we must find a company for cuti
And ofcs we miss martinez



SulaV March 26, 2024 At 11:57 pm

Garnacho and Enzo’s poor finishing in the final third is hurting us. Otamendi has been the worst of all so far. He is unable to keep up with the young Costa Rican players. However, I am glad that they are putting pressure on us and exposing our weaknesses. MacAllister needs to play closer to the goal, not Enzo. I am looking forward to Scaloni’s tactics in the second half.



Nabeelamigoz March 27, 2024 At 12:00 am

Yaa exaclty what i was thinking too maclisters attacking games are better than enzo and lo celso
We saw that in WC FINAL
ENZO getting attacking job only bcz of that goal against mexico



Gonzalo March 27, 2024 At 12:02 am

Garnacho is trying… u sound like a cr7 fan hating on him..



FalCon March 27, 2024 At 12:11 am

bro garnacho is the only player in the field who is trying desparately. if messi would have been there he would have surely pick those garnacho’s run..



Godin11 March 26, 2024 At 11:57 pm

Otamendi can’t run it’s criminal that he is istill undisputed starter he is way f…king too slow



Gonzalo March 26, 2024 At 11:56 pm

Lo celso is so slow.. OMG… HE AND OTAMENDI IS THE REASON WE ARE BEHIND



shOvwar March 26, 2024 At 11:54 pm

I only see Garnacho running and trying.



San Isidro March 26, 2024 At 11:50 pm

I think Gallardo not developing players is going to hurt our youth greatly cause you sure as shit can’t count on Masche other than to teach them how to clean their rooms and learn English



San Isidro March 26, 2024 At 11:48 pm

Every fucking time I turn around Ota is beat. I’d put in Barco, DePaul, and Lautaro and Anybody it Ota



karl March 26, 2024 At 11:46 pm

Otamendi is playing grandma football. He better to announce retirement in half time.



Godin11 March 26, 2024 At 11:55 pm



San Isidro March 26, 2024 At 11:45 pm

Not getting anything from Otamendi either. The guy is washed. Lisandro needed badly. The midfield isn’t working, and we can’t seem to finish lately



karl March 26, 2024 At 11:47 pm

Lo Celso is the culprit. Every time he plays, our offense looks sloppy and clueless.



Cleanball March 26, 2024 At 11:42 pm

Down 0-1 , Only Garnacho runs



karl March 26, 2024 At 11:33 pm

Lo Celso is showing us why no teams want him in Europe. Lmfao!!! He isn’t even a threat to a Costa Rican U23 team.

Thank God him and Nico were not in 2022 WC squad. We would have exited in group stage if they played.

Scaloni needs to cut these two frauds asap.



Gonzalo March 26, 2024 At 11:57 pm

Yes … thank God he was injured
