Argentina, the reigning FIFA World Cup champions, face off against Costa Rica in an international friendly on March 27th, 2024. This match, held at the United Airlines Field in Los Angeles, USA, serves as crucial preparation for Argentina ahead of the upcoming Copa America in June. With Lionel Messi out with an injury, the world champions would be looking to close out the international friendlies with a strong win before having to defend their Copa America title later this year.
Argentina comes into the game in top form as they defeated El Salvador 3-0 in another friendly. Their focus will be on maintaining their winning momentum and experimenting with tactics under coach Lionel Scaloni.
Costa Rica, on the other hand, aims to use this match to test their mettle against a world-class opponent. They qualified for the Copa America and are looking to build confidence before the tournament. Their recent performance against Honduras saw them win 3-1. Against Argentina, a strong defensive performance will be key to a positive result.
Historically, Argentina dominates the head-to-head record. They have never lost an official match to Costa Rica, winning four and drawing two out of their six encounters. The most recent meeting, in 2011, resulted in a comfortable 3-0 victory for Argentina.

Martinez (GK), Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico, De Paul, Paredes, Fernandez, Mac Allister, Martinez, Alvarez
