The Argentina national team will play play Costa Rica on Tuesday night and will make a few changes to the team which started against El Salvador.

Argentina national team coach Lionel Scaloni stated on Tuesday that he will make changes for the match against Costa Rica, stating that Alejandro Garnacho could start and that he wants to give the opportunity to Walter Benítez.

Lionel Scaloni did not confirm the starting eleven but a rumored eleven has been put together by the media in Argentina. Here is the rumored eleven:

Emiliano Martínez or Walter Benítez; Nahuel Molina, Cristian Romero or Nicolás Otamendi, Germán Pezzella, Nicolás Tagliafico; Enzo Fernández, Alexis Mac Allister, Gio Lo Celso; Ángel Di María, Alejandro Garnacho and Julián Álvarez

Anyone know where I can watch this in the US?

Definitely scaloni needs to revamp defense and improve set piece chances..also need a backup for Emi Martinez – be it Benitez or Gazzaniga..

Counter Attack – i think we are good for now..we have pacy wingers and forwards..

I wish we could fast track agustin roberto just like what brazil did with endrick,



ElCholo March 26, 2024 At 7:54 pm

Endrick has played a full year is Brazil’s top league. Roberto hasn’t played a match in Argentina’s. Their players often develop more quickly and flame out.

Why Pezella? I thought his story was over. Without De Paul who would be the work horse? 4 4 2 would have been a better choice keeping De Paul in the team. Garnacho and Alvarez are the future but perhaps not together. Garnacho and Lautaro would have been better with Garnacho’s floaters coming into the box like what happena at Inter.



SulaV March 26, 2024 At 4:26 pm

Exactly! Why Pezella? When a manager has an experienced defender in the team it is usually to close out matches or as a back up for instance like Johny Evans from United. Their experience will help the team to not make any silly mistakes and keep posession of the ball so that there is no last min goal conceded but Pezella against Netherlands did opposite of everything I have mentioned. Not only he made a stupid silly tackle , he did it right at the edge of the box and literally in the last min of the injury time. After that blunder he should never even be picked let alone start a friendly match before the upcoming COPA.



Delpetro March 26, 2024 At 5:56 pm

When it comes to defense selection,Scaloni can’t emphasize enough on heights. If not, Medina is heads and shoulders above Pezella. Atleast, Senesi seems to ‘ve a future. May be it is a right strategy. After all, Samuel, Ayala, & Scaloni himself knows one or two about defense strategy considering thier resumes.



Asaph Mark March 27, 2024 At 3:59 pm

Inclusion of Pezella is what annoys me most . His performance vs Colombia in Copa America tells it all. Luis Diaz equalizing goal against Argentina was Pezella’s fault. He had similar bad performance against Brazil at home in 2022 WCQ.

Argentina lineup to face Costa Rica:
Walter Benítez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico; Alexis Mac Allister, Leandro Paredes, Enzo Fernández; Di María, Julián, and Garnacho. 

Exciting lin up , looking forward how our midfielder do without de Paul plus how Garnacho and Alvarez link up with each other



SorinXcrespO March 26, 2024 At 2:12 pm

I like this lineup, but would feel more comfortable with depaul involved.



ElCholo March 26, 2024 At 7:49 pm

It’s a very good passing midfield cause Lo Celso is a better passer than RDP. Mac and Enzo are excellent passers. But it might lack a big if energy. Garnacho and Alvarez are hard workers. Di Maria still is despite his age. Very interesting.



Dinucci March 26, 2024 At 12:15 pm

Pezzella should be phased out. No disrespect but when he came in in the World Cup semis I thought he would fuck up and he did.



Fahim March 26, 2024 At 10:00 am

Why Pezzella.. Why….??? 



iman March 26, 2024 At 9:40 am

Pezzella?is a joke  



Dfox1942 March 26, 2024 At 8:11 am

” Argentine police and prosecutors are investigating an anonymous death threat to soccer star Ángel Di Maria delivered in his hometown of Rosario early Monday”. (ESPN)
This nonsense that never ends in South America, you would think he didn’t win the WC for his country!!!!



SorinXcrespO March 26, 2024 At 2:12 pm

After you win is when the threats and ransoms start.
That’s why I miss Pablo. His people will kill u if you lose. If you win you get a motorcycle and a hippopotamus.
