Friendlies

The 2022 World Cup winners survived a poor first half before running riot in the second 45.

Halftime must have been a bit awkward in the Argentina dressing room. Through 45 minutes, the reigning world champions found themselves down a goal to a youthful Costa Rica team. Without Lionel Messi in the squad, those outside that locker room wondered which player in it would step up and lead a comeback.

Someone did step up: Angel Di Maria. One of the most experienced players in this title-winning Argentina team, the veteran winger provided the stunning goal that his side needed to escape Los Angeles with a hard-fought win.

Di Maria's brilliant free-kick built the momentum and equalized the game, paving the way for an Alexis Mac Allister winner and a slump-busting Lautaro Martinez finish for good measure in a 3-1 win. The Liverpool star's goal sealed Argentina a 2-1 advantage they'd never relinquish before Martinez's goal off the bench, one that ended a year-and-a-half-long dry spell.

Without Messi, Argentina faced an unlikely test and, at times, they struggled. Part of that was due to a big game from Costa Rican icon Keylor Navas, who kept the 2022 World Cup winners at bay for large stretches. Argentina, though, were also at fault as they did struggle with decisiveness early on.

It all worked out in the end, though. Tuesday night's match ended as another win for Argentina as they continue to build momentum towards this summer's Copa America.

GOAL rates Argentina's players from the LA Memorial Coliseum....

Goalkeeper & Defence

Walter Benitez (6/10):

Unlucky on Costa Rica's goal as his initial save fell right into the path of Manfred Ugalde. It happens.

Nicolas Tagliafico (6/10):

Nearly got a goal, only to see it smash off the crossbar. His misfortune was Mac Allister's good luck, though, as the Liverpool star pounced to score right after.

Nicolas Otamendi (6/10):

Won the initial header to set up Mac Allister's goal. Defensively, could have done much better on several parts of Costa Rica's goal.

Cristian Romero (7/10):

A solid shift from the Spurs defender, who was tidy on the ball and did well to win it back when his side didn't have it.

Nahuel Molina (6/10):

Did well getting forward. Could have been a bit better on the other side of the ball, though.

Midfield

Enzo Fernandez (7/10):

Continues to put in strong shifts for his national team. Did a little bit of everything in the win.

Alexis Mac Allister (8/10):

Got the goal to highlight a tidy performance from a player that is just so important for both club and country.

Giovani Lo Celso (8/10):

Did so many good things, particularly defensively. Was probably the best of the three midfielders on the day.

Attack

Alejandro Garnacho (7/10):

Had Costa Rica's defenders running in circles all night. Wasn't quite able to create a big moment in the final third, but he surely got close as he dribbled through the Ticos backline over and over again.

Julian Alvarez (6/10):

Worked hard, but it never really came off for him.

Angel Di Maria (9/10):

Led from the front all night long. His free kick was absolutely stunning, but it wasn't the only bright moment of a standout performance from the wily veteran.

Subs & Manager

Leandro Paredes (6/10):

You know what you get from the midfielder, who came in and held down the fort in the second half.

Lautaro Martinez (8/10):

Finally! His goal drought is over as he scored his first since pre-World Cup. That'll feel good for a player that's too talented to go that long without a goal.

Rodrigo De Paul (7/10):

Put the ball on a platter for Martinez as the Argentina midfielder flexed the playmaking abilities that go with his physical presence in the center of the park.

Nicolas Gonzalez (6/10):

Was so close to getting a goal, only to see it cleared off the line. Could he have followed it up with a bit more effort to make sure it went in? Probably.

Valentin Carboni (N/A):

A memorable night for the youngster, who earned his first cap.

German Pezzela (N/A):

Replaced Otamendi late, but didn't really need to do much.

Lionel Scaloni (7/10):

An ugly first half, but pulled all the right strings in the second. Got the win his team came for while getting a few players some much-needed feel-good moments.
