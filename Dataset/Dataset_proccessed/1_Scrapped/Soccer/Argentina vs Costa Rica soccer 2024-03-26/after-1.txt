THE BIGGER PICTURE

Messi pulled out of the international friendlies for March after suffering an injury during Inter Miami's CONCACAF Champions Cup clash against Nashville. Since then, the former Barcelona star has missed his club's MLS clash against DC United and then decided not to join Lionel Scaloni's side for the friendly matches.

WHAT ALEXIS MAC ALLISTER SAID

Speaking to ESPN, Mac Allister said: "We always focus a lot on the group and the team. We know that when Leo is not there, we have to become even stronger because we don't have that player who, when things go wrong, can save us.

"We know that when Leo is there, they (rivals) are a little more afraid, it is normal. We also have players who play in big clubs in Europe and when they see the Argentine National Team, they know that it is not going to be an easy match and that's what we want. We want to do our best so that the rival has a difficult day."

WHAT NEXT FOR ARGENTINA?

The reigning world champions are high on confidence after a 3-0 win over El Salvador, and they will next take on Costa Rica in a second friendly clash on Wednesday as their preparations for the 2024 Copa America continue.
