The Argentinian national team heads to Los Angeles on Tuesday night for a friendly encounter against Costa Rica. With both sides gearing up for the upcoming Copa America this summer, this match serves as a tune-up.

While fans in Los Angeles won’t get a glimpse of the legendary Lionel Messi, who’s recovering from injury back in Argentina, La Albiceleste still boasts a star-studded lineup. The likes of Lautaro Martinez, Paulo Dybala, and Angel Di Maria will be eager to impress in Messi’s absence and continue Argentina’s exceptional recent form.

Argentina is riding a ten-game winning streak, keeping an impressive ten clean sheets in the process.
