Ivory Coast vs Nigeria LIVE!

A huge match-up in the Africa Cup of Nations group stage took place in Abidjan as hosts Ivory Coast were defeated by three-time winners Nigeria. The Super Eagles improved on a poor opening result in the tournament, putting the pressure on the Ivorians ahead of the final round of Group A games.

Les Elephants were again without injured striker Sebastien Haller in their team after he missed their win over Guinea-Bissau, whereas changes were made by Nigeria following a draw against Equatorial Guinea. They switched formation and brought Samuel Chukwueze and Calvin Bassey into their starting line-up.

William Troost-Ekong's second-half penalty was the difference after Victor Osimhen was fouled by Ousmane Diomande, in an incident first spotted by VAR. Ivory Coast need a result in their final game to ensure they avoid an embarrassing early exit from their own AFCON.
