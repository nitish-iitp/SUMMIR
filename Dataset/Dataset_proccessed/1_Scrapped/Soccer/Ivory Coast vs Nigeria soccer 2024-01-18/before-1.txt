AFCON: CAPE VERDE GET 'REVENGE' OVER GHANA IN SHOCK WIN, NIGERIA HELD BY EQUATORIAL GUINEA IN OPENER
BYARAMIDE OLADIPO

PUBLISHED 15/01/2024 AT 22:52 GMT

The Africa Cup of Nations produced a number of shock results during the second day of the competition. Cape Verde opened their campaign with a stunning 2-1 victory over Ghana thanks to a stoppage-time winner from Garry Rodrigues. Fellow African giants Nigeria also endured a stuttering start to their campaign as they were held to a 1-1 draw by a battling Equatorial Guinea side.

Cape Verde opened their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a shock 2-1 victory over four-time winners Ghana on Sunday.
The islanders opened the scoring in the first half through Jamiro Monteiro before Ghana equalised after the break with a header from Alexander Djiku.

With the match looking set to finish in a draw, Cape Verde capitalised on a defensive mistake which led to Garry Rodrigues tapping into an empty net in the 92nd minute.

'WE DREAMED OF THIS MOMENT' - MATCH-WINNER HALLER REVELS IN AFCON ‘FAIRYTALE’

It was a demoralising start for the Black Stars, who endured heartbreak at the previous 2021 edition when they failed to make it past the group phase.
Cape Verde were knocked out of the 2013 competition in South Africa by Ghana and winger Ryan Mendes said his nation could enjoy some payback for that result.
"When we lost in South Africa, we didn't deserve to lose this game, but tonight we take our revenge," he said after the game.
"Back then, they had big name players like Asamoah Gyan and it was difficult for us in South Africa.
"But tonight, we take our revenge and we need to continue like this because we have a target to go into the next round.
"It's important to win the first game and tonight for us, it's very important to take these three points. It's not finished now, we have to continue and work tomorrow to get another three points."
For Ghana, it was another underwhelming performance under manager Chris Hughton, who has only won four out of his 11 matches since taking charge in March.
“We are incredibly, hugely disappointed with the result," Hughton explained after the game.
"We came into the game with a gameplan. We changed the way of playing, the system a bit so that we could start on the front foot.
"We thought the team that were put out was certainly a more offensive team. This was our intention. I think it rocked us the [first] goal that we conceded but I thought we got back into the game.”
He added: "At that stage [when Ghana equalised] it looked like we could go on and win it. We are hugely, hugely disappointed with our result. And I know, and this group of players also know, how the Ghanaian people see this game, see this tournament and our expectations going into this one.”
Ghana will face Egypt in their next group-stage match on Thursday with both sides in desperate need of a positive result.
Egypt needed a stoppage-time penalty from Mohamed Salah to rescue a 2-2 draw against Mozambique on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Nigeria also endured a stuttering start to their campaign with a 1-1 draw against Equatorial Guinea.
The underdogs took a shock lead after 36 minutes with Iban Salvador finishing off a fine move with a clinical finish.
However, Nigeria responded just two minutes later with Napoli striker Victor Osimhen getting them back on level terms with a header at the back post.
"We played a good game, we created many chances and clear opportunities, especially in the second half, and I think we deserved to win," Nigeria coach Jose Peseiro told a press conference.
"If we keep up this dominance we will do well. Of course I'm not happy we drew but if the other side deserved their point, then I'd be concerned."
Nigeria face a tough task in their next match when they face host Ivory Coast at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium.
