#KenesCommunity🌐 Our #KenesOriginalEvents✨ Account Manager & Director of our Bulgarian Office Julieta Trifonova was a panellist at the Mediterranean Chapter Annual Meeting of the International Congress and Convention Association - ICCA, from June 2 -4 in #Istanbul #Turkey

𝗠𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲: 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲𝘀, was the theme of the meeting and Julieta Trifonova participated in the panel 𝘔𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘰𝘤𝘪𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘣𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘩 𝘌𝘶𝘳𝘰𝘱𝘦 – 𝘬𝘦𝘺 𝘢𝘥𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘴: 𝘗𝘊𝘖 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘈𝘔𝘊 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦.

Read her input: “Our core business at Kenes Group is managing and organising the congresses of our clients – the International Associations –, while we are also focused on developing new original brands, Kenes Original Events.

This is aligned with our Kenes Group mission statement of #EmpoweringKnowledge and professional development. We look for emerging topics, new technologies, and subspecialties which do not compete with the established events of our #KenesAssociations.

Creating new brands to invest heavily is challenging; it requires a lot of courage and commitment. Therefore, we look for partners in different directions: we approach the destinations and venues to partner with them and share both the benefits and the risks. On the other hand, we look for Key Opinion Leaders or organisations that can contribute with their knowledge and networks.

We believe that strategic partnerships have significant potential, and the success of an emerging brand is frequently determined by the ability to identify and collaborate with the right people".

Slovakia's accession to the European Union was one of the most significant events in the country's modern history. That is why we were very pleased to attend the 20th anniversary celebrations of this event, which were organised in Bratislava by the AHK Slowakei (German-Slovak Chamber of Commerce) in cooperation with six other chambers of commerce and their representatives. It was a wonderful evening full of inspiring talks, optimistic plans for the future and visions of prospective collaborations. We are glad to have been there.

Very much looking forward to speaking tomorrow (Friday) at the IIBA Poland Summit. 

My session "From Skepticism to Advocacy" discusses how to build credibility and help spread awareness of business analysis... even amongst seemingly "skeptical" stakeholders... but highlights how it's *our* job to do that. (And that they might be right to be skeptical, if we haven't aligned what we do to things they value)

I'll blend in BA techniques, but also some ideas from the world of selling and sales. 

If you're at the conference, I hope to see you there!

PS:

As last minute preparation, like any good BA, I am reading a 1963 edition of "Soccer Star" magazine. This has direct relevance.

And I might just mention why in my session tomorrow...

Intrigued? If you're at the summit, come along to my session, 09:30 on the main stage. Hope to see you there 😊.

I am happy to have the opportunity to be on the organising team for BA & Beyond in Copenhagen again in 2025. The call for speakers is now open for anyone who would like to present at the conference - also inexperienced speakers. The most important part is that you have a good case or story to share about how you have applied business analysis. In other, we would love to hear about everyday life in your office.

For inspiration, topics might evolve around:
- Rock solid business analysis tools and techniques that stand the test of time
- Ensuring effective collaboration and co-creation
- Strategic business analysis and business architecture
- Business analysis in different project and product contexts
- How to match new approaches and technologies with legacy processes and systems
- The role of the business analysis in digital transformation, design thinking, innovation, data analytics, machine learning, generative AI, etc.
- Genuine stories of struggles and successes in organisational change

➡️ Despite rising labor costs, the value of business services provided in Poland to foreign companies continues to rise. The export of modern business services in Poland increased last year to nearly $37 billion.
➡️ Last year, the business services sector already accounted for more than 34% of Poland's commercial services exports.
➡️ This is largely a result of the structure of Poland's modern business services sector, which is highly internationalized and has a global reach and scope. 

How do ABSL Poland experts Dariusz Kubacki, VP BI ABSL Poland, and Pawel Panczyj, Strategy and Business Director & Board Member ABSL Poland, comment on the sector's growth?
