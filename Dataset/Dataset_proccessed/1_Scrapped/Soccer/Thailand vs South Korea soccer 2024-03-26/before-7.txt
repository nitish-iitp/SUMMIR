An official AFC statement read: “The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has confirmed today that the upcoming FIFA World Cup 2026 ™- Preliminary Joint Qualification Round 2 and AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ Qualifiers Group B fixture between DPR Korea and Japan, scheduled to be played on March 26, 2024, will not take place as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances.

“The decision, taken in consultation with FIFA and relevant stakeholders, comes after the AFC was informed on March 20 by the DPR Korea Football Association of the need to move the match to a neutral venue due to unavoidable circumstances.

“The matter will now be referred to the relevant Committees in FIFA with further updates to be communicated in due course.”

Japan had won 1-0 at home to North Korea on Thursday in their latest qualifier, with that result leaving them top of Group B, having won all three of their matches so far.

Endo, who is the Japan captain, only came on as a 58th minute substitute in Tokyo. He is now free to make an unexpected, premature return to the AXA Training Centre ahead of Liverpool’s return to action after the March international break against Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday 31 March.
