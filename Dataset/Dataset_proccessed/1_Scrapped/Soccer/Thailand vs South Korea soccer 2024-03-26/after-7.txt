SEOUL, March 26 (Yonhap) -- Son Heung-min scored in his second straight match as South Korea defeated Thailand 3-0 on Tuesday in Bangkok to remain unbeaten in the Asian World Cup qualifying tournament.

Son's 46th international goal doubled South Korea's lead in the second half at Rajamangala Stadium, after Lee Jae-sung opened the scoring 19 minutes into the Group C match in the second round of the Asian qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Substitute Park Jin-seop added an 82nd-minute goal for the comfortable win.

South Korea stayed atop Group C in the second round with 10 points from three wins and a draw.

This was a bounceback performance for the Taegeuk Warriors, who were held by Thailand 1-1 at home last Thursday.

Son has now scored in all four matches so far in the second round. He sits four back of Hwang Sun-hong, caretaker boss for the national team, for second place on the South Korean scoring list. Cha Bum-kun, a Bundesliga star from the 1980s, is the all-time leader with 58 goals.

This was Son's 125th international appearance, giving him the sole possession of fifth place. Cha and former defender Hong Myung-bo are tied at the top with 136 caps each.

There are nine groups of four in the second round. The top two countries from each group will advance to the third round.

South Korea have played at every World Cup since 1986.
