Striving to keep their Group A unbeaten status intact, Uzbekistan will welcome United Arab Emirates to Milliy Stadion in Tashkent for an AFC World Cup qualifier on Tuesday night.

The Whites Wolves secured a share of the points with Iran last time out, whilst Al Abyad also picked up a neutral result, drawing at home to section strugglers North Korea.

After three matches of the third round of qualifying in AFC, Uzbekistan have collected seven points and currently sit top of the pile in Group A, level on points with second-placed Iran and three points ahead of third-placed United Arab Emirates, who are the visitors to Tashkent on Tuesday night.

Although a highly-respectable result, the White Wolves did drop points for the first time in this section on Thursday night, when both Utkir Yusupov and Alireza Beiranvand kept clean sheets at Milliy Stadion as Group A pacesetters Uzbekistan and Iran shared the hard-fought honours.

As a result of Thursday night's stalemate, Uzbekistan extended their unbeaten run during home matches to over 16 months, with Tuesday's hosts last suffering defeat in front of their own supporters in June 2023, when they lost a summer friendly to Iran.

Taking the reins of the White Wolves in August 2021, Srecko Katanec has enjoyed a success-laden time in charge so far, losing just seven of his 38 matches in the dugout, with the 61-year-old looking to set to be the man to take Uzbekistan back onto the World Cup stage.

With North Korea and Kyrgyzstan yet to enjoy a win at the bottom of Group A, United Arab Emirates are in a good place as they aim to secure a top-four finish at minimum, with Tuesday night's visitors to Uzbekistan earning four points from their opening three matches across the third round of qualifying.

That being said, Al Abyad would have sensed a missed opportunity following the full-time whistle in Al Ain on Thursday night, when Paulo Bento's side were forced to share the spoils with a struggling North Korea due to a 86th-minute equaliser from Jong Il-Gwan for the visitors.

Although UAE dominated possession last time out, they were only able to register one shot on target throughout the course of the 90 minutes, meaning that there is certainly room for improvement in attacking areas as they make the daunting trip to Milliy Stadion on Tuesday night.

Al Abyad will be looking to replicate the stellar performance and result from their most recent away fixture on September 5, when goals from Harib Abdalla Suhail, Khaled Aldhanhani and Ali Saleh secured a comeback victory at the home of Asian Cup holders Qatar.

After keeping a clean sheet against group favourites Iran on Thursday, Uzbekistan should stick with a centre-back trio of Khusniddin Alikulov, Abdukodir Khusanov and Rustamjon Ashurmatov.

Failing to breach the net of Team Melli last time out, the White Wolves could introduce Oston Urunov into the XI to freshen up the attack in Tashkent.

Replaced during the half-time break versus Iran, right-back Farruh Sayfiev is a doubt for Tuesday night's all-important clash at Milliy Stadion.

Providing an excellent assist from the engine room against North Korea, UAE youngster Abdulla Hamad should retain his spot in midfield versus Uzbekistan.

There could still be some alterations in the middle of the park for Al Abyad, though, with Ali Salmeen likely to make way for Isam Faiz.


Uzbekistan possible starting lineup:
Yusupov; Alidzhanov, Alikulov, Khusanov, Ashurmatov, Nasrulloev; Fayzullaev, Khamrobekov, Shukurov, Masharipov; Shomurodov

United Arab Emirates possible starting lineup:
Eisa; Aldhanhani, Al Hammadi, Autonne, Idrees; Hamad, Faiz, Al Zaabi; Suhail, Caio, Bruno



We say: Uzbekistan 1-0 United Arab Emirates

Recording a shutout versus the dangerous Iran last time out, Group A leaders Uzbekistan will be extremely confident of grinding out a win against the UAE on Tuesday night.

Al Abyad were marvellous during their away trip to Qatar last month, but we feel that Bento's troops will fall short of repeating the trick in Tashkent.
