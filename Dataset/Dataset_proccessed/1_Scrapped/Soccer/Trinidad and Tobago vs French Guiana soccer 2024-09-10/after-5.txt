Trinidad and Tobago interim head coach Derek King is set to make changes to his starting XI for their Concacaf Nations League match against French Guiana on Tuesday at the Dwight Yorke Stadium in Tobago.

The Soca Warriors went down 4-0 to Honduras on Friday and must beat French Guiana in a bid to qualify for the quarterfinals of the tournament.

King told TTFA Media that all of his players are fit and ready with tweaks to the starting XI.

"We'll make some slight changes to the starting team and the system as well," he said.

"At international level, you don't get away with some of the mistakes that you will make in the local league and stuff. So I think the guys will learn from their mistakes. They will be eager to go and they know how important the three points is," King added.

French Guiana lost 1-0 to Nicaragua in their opening match on 6 September.

"We want to play football, entertaining football because I think T&T deserves a victory," King said.

Kick-off time is at 7pm.
