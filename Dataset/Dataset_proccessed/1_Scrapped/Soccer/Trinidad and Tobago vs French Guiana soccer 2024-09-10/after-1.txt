Trinidad and Tobago face French Guiana

Trinidad and Tobago welcome French Guiana to Dwight Yorke Stadium for a CONCACAF Nations League fixture on Tuesday (September 10th). The hosts will be looking to bounce back from the harrowing 4-0 defeat they suffered away to Honduras over the weekend.

They were two goals down at the break courtesy of strikes from Alexander Lopez and Kervin Arriaga. Edwin Rodriguez and David Ruiz scored second half goals for Honduras to complete the rout.

French Guiana, meanwhile, fell to a 1-0 defeat at home to Nicaragua. Widman Talavera stepped off the bench to score the match-winner for the visitors in the fifth minute of injury time.

The respective losses left both sides at the bottom of Group B on zero points after one game.

Trinidad and Tobago were thrashed by Honduras in their opening game of the Nations League. The Soca Warriors will have to put that behind them as they seek to put their first points on the board. Derek King's side are the heavy favorites here and have a 100 per cent record in this fixture.

French Guiana, for their part, are competing in League A of the CONCACAF Nations League for the first time in their history. They finished with 10 points from six games to top their group and advance to the top-flight last season. They were outplayed in their opening game to Nicaragua but held on until the end, conceding a heartbreaking goal deep into injury time.

We are backing Trinidad and Tobago to claim a comfortable win with goals at both ends.
