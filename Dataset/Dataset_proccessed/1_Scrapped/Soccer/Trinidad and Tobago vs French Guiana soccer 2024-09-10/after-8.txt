I feel sheltered

Andre Raymond spoke before this game: “The people, the coaches and my teammates have helped me integrate very well into the team.”

“Even though people there think ‘it's hot today’, for me it's not hot.”

“I've been ranked along with Jason Scotland as one of the fan favorites because I think he was the fan favorite when he was there.”

“I didn't know he had played there or that there were so many Trinidadians playing in Scotland.”

“It's been really good to hear the history and the background. Mentally and tactically I have grown a lot since I have been there.”
