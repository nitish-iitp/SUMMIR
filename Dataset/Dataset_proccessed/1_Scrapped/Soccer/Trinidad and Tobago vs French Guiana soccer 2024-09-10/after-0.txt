NOTHING comes easy these days. And Trinidad and Tobago’s senior men’s footballers were made to work for a share of the points, when held goalless by French Guiana in a 2024-2025 CONCACAF Nations League match at the Dwight Yorke Stadium, in Bacolet, Tobago, last night.

The route to a quarter-final spot got harder, with just one point gathered from two matches and only a home and away series coming up against Cuba next month, to complete the four-match preliminary round.

The top two of each five-nation group teams will advance to the quarters, where they will be joined by four seeded teams; United States, Mexico, Canada and Panama.

Despite plenty effort and a few nervous moments for the 2,000 fans who showed up, there were no goals. The Soca Warriors almost had the perfect start with Tobagonian Kevon Woodley finding the back of the net in the opening minute, but it was ruled offside.

But after that bright start, there seemed at times too much a search for perfection, thus allowing French Guiana into the match. After that stagnant period, Duane Muckette provided a lift when working well with Woodley and stinging the keeper’s fingertip.

Meanwhile, T&T keeper Denzil Smith kept the defensive end safe, when swallowing up the only first half shot at his goal. The Soca Warriors were unlucky not to be ahead after the first period.

England-based Daniel Phillips hit the post from long range, and after beating his man Woodley’s low shot missed the far corner. So close, yet so far.

And subs Reon Moore and Noah Powder both ought to have scored early in the second half, with Moore hitting the side netting and Powder shooting low and straight at the keeper.

Both T&T and French Guiana lost their opening match. T&T going down 4-0 away to Honduras on Friday night, while a late goal saw French Guiana defeated 1-0 on home turf by Nicaragua.

Last night was the first time the Caribbean nations had faced each other in Nations League play, although Trinidad and Tobago had won three of five previous meetings, including twice at the Caribbean Cup.

T&T:

17. Justin Garcia, 15. Dantaye Gilbert, 18. Andre Rampersad, 2. Aubrey David (captain), 22. Denzil Smith (GK). 7. Ryan Telfer, 12. Steffen Yeates, 6. Andre Raymond, 11. Real Gill, 16. Alvin Jones, 13. Reon Moore. 3. Triston Hodge, 19. Noah Powder, Kaïlé Auvray, 9. Nathaniel James; 7. Ryan Telfer, 23. Kevon Woodley, 1. Christopher Biggette (GK), 21. Aaron Enill (GK), 4.Daniel Phillips, 5. Leland Archer, 8. Isaiah Lee, 10. Duane Muckette, 14. Shannon Gomez.

Coach: Derek King.

Four from four for ‘Bongo’

BIG Brent Sam netted a brace as the Densill Theobald-coached Defence Force took an outright lead in Tier One of the Trinidad and Tobago Premier Football League (TTPFL), when hammering a youth-laden Terminix La Horquetta Rangers 6-2, before a big crowd on Boxing Day at the Arima Velodrome.

Also, it is now four goals in as many matches for Defence Force striker Isaiah ‘Bongo’ Leacock, who normally comes on as a replacement for Sam.

‘Gunners’ move above Chelsea into 2nd place

Arsenal moved up to second in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Liverpool, as Kai Havertz’s first-half goal secured a narrow 1-0 win over Ipswich at the Emirates Stadium, yesterday.

It seemed Arsenal were set for a comfortable night when Havertz turned home Leandro Trossard’s cross from close range in the 23rd minute for his seventh Premier League goal of the campaign.

WI WOMEN SWEPT

West Indies women’s skipper Hayley Matthews has hailed the fight shown by her charges as one of the positives to be taken from their five-wicket defeat to their Indian counterparts in the final game of a three-match ODI series, at Kotambi International Cricket Stadium, yesterday.

Deepti Sharma and Renuka Singh ripped through the West Indies women’s batting to lead the hosts to another comfortable win.

Player-of-the-Match Sharma bagged six wickets-- her second five-wicket haul in ODIs --while Singh, who was named Player-of-the-Series, captured the other four as the home side dismissed the Windies for a modest 162 in 38.5 overs.

CHAMPIONS WIN

CHAMPIONS AC Port of Spain were among the first winners of Boxing Day football in Trinidad and Tobago after edging early front-runners Central FC Reboot 2-1 at Arima Velodrome last evening.

The first edition of Boxing Day football was a hit at the Arima Velodrome, where a big crowd turned up and only a second half goal from striker Sedale “Skem” McLean separated two hard-battling Tier One contenders.

Corneal earns FIFA diploma

Trinidad and Tobago Football Association Technical Director Anton Corneal is one of a select group of technical leaders from across the globe to graduate from the first edition of FIFA’s Technical Leadership diploma.

Corneal attended the final block of the 18 month-long course which concluded with a series of assessment presentations and a graduation ceremony at the FIFA museum in Zurich from December 5-6.

National Championships kick off boxing in 2025

The Trinidad and Tobago Boxing Association (TTBA) will begin its rebuilding process early next year, starting with the National Boxing Championships in January.
