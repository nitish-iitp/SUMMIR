TELL ME MORE

From the opening whistle, it was clearly going to be Uruguay's night. Marcelo Bielsa's side were dominant agains Panama, controlling the tempo of the match throughout the majority of the contest.

A belter of an effort from Maxi Araujo just 16 minutes in handed them the advantage, and they doubled it late, through Darwin Nunez in the 86th minute. The Liverpool striker had a plethora of chances throughout the match, but finally found his groove late.

His moment opened a brief floodgate, with Uruguay adding a 93rd-minute goal - Flamengo's Matias Vina headed home a brilliant delivery to secure a 3-1 victory on the cusp of the final whistle.

Well, sort of.

Panama also found a consolation goal, just one minute later, with the match ending 3-1 after Michael Murillo bagged a clean effort.

A rather composed match from both sides, Bielsa's team just outclassed the Panamanians in front of goal.

THE MVP

Maxi Araujo:

The Toluca winger was sensational, and often sparked the attack for Bielsa's side. Araujo often found himself in the right place at the right time, which was exactly how he found the back of the net Sunday.

The effort? Brilliant - a genuine, potential Goal of the Tournament contender.

You could not ask more from an attacker than Sunday from Araujo.

THE BIG LOSER

Panama's knockout round hopes:

Los Canaleros are now sitting in a position where they need results over the next two games - and that is no easy task.

Winning against the USMNT is never easy, but, they have has success of late - notably in the 2023 Gold Cup. However, this is a different roster, and the U.S. look like a team to beat.

They'll need a draw at worst on Thursday against Christian Pulisic and Co. if they want a chance at the knockouts.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Uruguay will take on Bolivia Thursday night in game two of Group Stage action. They'll look to earn another victory, before they take on the USMNT on July 1 in what is expected to be a battle for the top of the group.
