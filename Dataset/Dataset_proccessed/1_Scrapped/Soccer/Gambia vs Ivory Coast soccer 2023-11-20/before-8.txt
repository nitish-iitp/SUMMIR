LIVE Updates – 08:30
Good morning! The Seychelles national team players are making their way back home after their journey in the World Cup 2026 Qualifiers. Despite facing two defeats in the past days, our young team has shown tremendous progress. In the second match, it became evident that the players were grasping the instructions from their coaches and displaying an improved understanding of the game. Looking ahead, our next two games in the World Cup Qualifiers are scheduled for June 2024 against Gambia and Burundi, while the remaining six games will take place in 2025.

Currently, our team is en route from Ethiopia, making their way back to Seychelles.

Rohan Orphe (Rovers FC)

For me, it has been a great journey with the national team. I’ve gained a lot of experience these past few weeks, training with a former professional goalkeeper. It’s a dream come true for me. He helped me realize the potential I have to go further in football. Now, I have a better understanding of what I need to do to reach my full potential. We are a young team with a lot of potential, and we need to trust the process to fulfill it. We need our nation to get behind us.

Helton Monnaie (La Passe FC)

I’m happy as we managed to make more passes in the second game. In football, everything is possible. We are highly motivated, and we are still working hard to move forward.

Seychelles 0-5 Kenya | World Cup Qualifiers (Group F)

Seychelles faced a difficult beginning to their Group F campaign, suffering a record-breaking 9-0 loss against Ivory Coast in Abidjan during the African World Cup Qualifiers. Despite a 2-1 defeat to Gabon in their opener, Engin Firat’s squad exhibited unwavering determination and fought back with great spirit.

Michael Olunga opened the scoring just three minutes into the game, taking advantage of a defensive mistake. He doubled his tally soon after, capitalizing on another Seychelles error.

Kenya continued their relentless attack, keeping Seychelles pinned in their own half. Masoud Juma extended the lead just before halftime, while Rooney Onyango and Benson Omalla added two more goals in the second half.

Although Kenya pushed for more, some wayward passing and saves from Seychelles goalkeeper Carlos Simeon prevented further goals.

With this victory, Kenya climbed to third place in the group standings, trailing Ivory Coast and Gabon. Seychelles, on the other hand, find themselves at the bottom after conceding 14 goals in their first two matches.

Seychelles Starting XI: C. Siméon, H. Monnaie, G. Waye-Hive, L. Panayi, M. Payet, M. Bristol-Cissoko, E. Sopha, N. Labiche, R. Damoo, I. Raheriniaina, R. Henriette

Substitutes: K. Nourrice, N. Bibi, B. Labrosse, M. Adrienne, F. Renaud, M. Freminot, L. Ernesta, B. Esparon, S. Ladouce, S. Morgan, R. Orphe, S. Larue

Statistical Highlights:

Ball Possession: Seychelles 28% – 72% Kenya

Corners: Seychelles 2 – 8 Kenya
Goalkeeper Saves: Seychelles 7 – 1 Kenya

Kenya’s anticipated starting XI for tonight’s match against Seychelles:

Goalkeeper – Patrick Matasi:
Matasi’s impressive performance in the previous match makes him the likely choice to start against Seychelles. As Engin Firat’s trusted goalkeeper, he will play a crucial role in ensuring a solid defense.

Right back – Amos Nondi (Ararat Armenia)
Despite a somewhat shaky display, Nondi’s assist in the last match earns him a probable starting spot at right back. With Seychelles expected to pose less threat on the flanks, Nondi’s presence will be valuable.

Centre backs – Johnstone Omurwa and Dennis Ng’ang’a (Estrela de Amadora & Mahia)
Omurwa, the only fully fit preferred defender, is expected to retain his place despite a missed interception leading to a goal. Ng’ang’a, eager for his first win with Harambee Stars, will aim to impress and secure future call-ups.

Left back – Abud Omar (Police FC)
With Erick Marcelo Ouma’s injury, Omar’s experience is vital at left back. He will play a crucial role in guiding Harambee Stars towards victory.

Central midfielders – Richard Odada and Teddy Akumu (Aalborg & Sagan Tosu)
Odada’s consistent presence in midfield under Firat’s guidance makes him a likely starter. Akumu, Odada’s long-standing partner, is expected to retain his position as well.

Right winger – Rooney Onyango (Mahia)
Onyango’s impressive performances in recent matches make him a strong candidate to start on the right wing. His crossing ability and overall contribution have made him one of Kenya’s standout players.

Left winger – Masoud Juma (El Jadidi)
Juma’s scoring form in his last two appearances ensures his place as a left winger. Firat values his ability to take on opponents, adding a dynamic element to the team’s attack.

Striker – Michael Olunga (Al-Duhail)
Despite facing criticism for his goal drought, Olunga will lead the attack against Seychelles, hoping to find the back of the net and regain his scoring form.

Attacking midfielder – Duke Abuya (Singida Gate)
Abuya may be favored over Kenneth Muguna in the number 10 role, as Firat seeks to inject creativity into the team. His inclusion aims to secure Firat’s first win in charge since the game against Qatar.

LIVE Updates – 14:25
Insights from world sports portals on upcoming match: With an impeccable head-to-head record, winning four out of five meetings against Seychelles, Harambee Stars enters their upcoming match with high expectations. The last encounter in 2015 saw Kenya secure a 2-0 victory. Kenyan fans are confident in their team’s abilities and eagerly anticipate another successful performance.

LIVE Updates – 14:05
Darrel Damoo (Saint Louis FC): With our young amateur team against the professionals of Ivory Coast, a loss was certain, although I did not envision it to that margin. However, plenty of exposure and experience was amassed by the boys especially for the majority of the team debuting for Seychelles in that match. Going forward, I would urge each and every player to take this as a learning curve and move forward to the next match ahead.
Our Team needs to keep more possession of the ball and move our opponents using the same and build confidence on perfecting individual mistakes so as to progress collectively. I have no doubt this has been a talking point within the camp and I am hopeful that betterment is inbound from our boys. #AllezSesel🇸🇨

LIVE Updates – 12:40
Majid Freminot: Based on my own perception, I can say that we are not focusing on the negative side of the game but rather looking forward to achieving more in our team objectives.

Ryan Henriette (Foresters FC)

Yes, I think those guys in front of us had a huge advantage. They seemed like robots. However, this is something we will work on. When we return to Seychelles, the whole team will focus on gym training to level the playing field.

Regarding support, the player highlights the varying opinions among Seychellois towards the team.

Ryan Henriette (Foresters FC)

For me as a player, I don’t really bother with what people say about the team because, in my opinion, Seychellois don’t support each other. Not all Seychellois, though. There are some who trust this process and like the idea that Seychelles is preparing a team for the future. However, there are many who speak negatively about the team.

We have received some good advice from our doctor and therapist, and it has certainly helped a lot. The team’s goal is to improve our play and capture as much as possible from these matches so that we can perform even better next time as a team.

LIVE Updates – 10:30
In a World Cup qualifier match, Ivory Coast achieved a 9-0 victory over Seychelles in Abidjan, setting a new record for the largest winning margin in an African qualifier. The mismatch was evident as Group F’s matchday one paired the top-ranked teams against the bottom-ranked ones due to the seedings for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Africa.

With a considerable ranking difference, Seychelles sits at 195th position in the FIFA rankings, a significant 121 places below Ivory Coast. It comes as no surprise that the outcome of the match was in line with this notable disparity.

Football is a sport that operates on various levels, and Ivory Coast has consistently dominated the top tier for more than a decade. Hence, it was no surprise to witness a high-scoring match. Our aim was to score a goal, but we must refrain from blaming our players. The substantial gap between the two teams is undeniable, emphasising the importance of further developing football in Seychelles for future growth and competitiveness.

Seychelles Starting XI: #23 C. Simeon, #16 B. Esparon, #37 S. Ladouce, #13 K. Nourice, #8 Lucas Panayi, #15 M. Payet, #20 I. Raheriniaina, #6 E. Sopha, #2 G. Waye-Hive, #17 Ryan Henriette, #7 B. Labrosse
Substitutes: #22 M. Freminot, #21 S. Larue, #9 R. Damoo, #18 R. Orphe, #11 N. Bibi, #5 H. Monay, #4 S. Morgan, #19 N. Labiche, #10 L. Ernesta, #3 M. Cissoko, #14 F. Renaud, #1 M. Adrienne

Statistical Highlights:

Ball Possession: Ivory Coast 68% – 32% Seychelles
Shots on Target: Ivory Coast 9 – 0 Seychelles
Shots off Target: Ivory Coast 17 – 0 Seychelles
Corners: Ivory Coast 14 – 1 Seychelles
Dangerous Attacks: Ivory Coast 126 – 10 Seychelles

According to football game analysis websites, our goalkeeper Carlos Simeon stood out as the top performer. He made an impressive achievement by saving 9 shots on target, earning a high rating of 3.6. His exceptional performance played a crucial role in the game.

Our team gave their all in the match, surpassing their limits with every player on the field. Despite the wide gap in levels, we managed to keep a clean sheet for 20 minutes. Unfortunately, there was a mistake by referee Adalbert Diouf from Senegal, resulting in an undeserved penalty for Ivory Coast. Out of the three penalties awarded, the second one was a controversial decision. Winning was a distant possibility, but our focus now shifts to the game against Kenya, who performed well against Gabon.

Pre-Match Press Conference | Head Coach Ralph Jean-Louis Shares Insights and Objectives

Interviewer: How do you plan to approach your duel with Côte d’Ivoire with a team that was put together a short time ago?

Coach Ralph Jean-Louis: We have already participated in the qualifiers for a World Cup. However, we have never won a match. Playing against Ivory Coast is historic for us. We approach this match with complete humility, knowing that regardless of the outcome, we will consider ourselves winners if we achieve the objectives set by our team, which we have already communicated.

Interviewer: What is ultimately your objective against Ivory Coast?

Coach Ralph Jean-Louis: Before any match, the goal for every team is to secure a victory. However, we are playing against Ivory Coast, and while it is not impossible, we approach the match with a level-headed mindset. Our main objective is to score a goal against Ivory Coast, but we have other objectives that we have extensively communicated. This is a new project with a young group. It’s important to have ambitions, but we also need to be realistic.

Interviewer: You traveled with a very young team. Is this match against Ivory Coast a kind of learning experience for you?

Coach Ralph Jean-Louis: Not necessarily. We also have older players who are based in Europe and have participated in various competitions. However, it is true that we have new talents who will gain experience from this match and understand the path Seychelles needs to take to reach the level of Côte d’Ivoire.

Interviewer: We have noticed some issues surrounding the national team in the Seychelles press. Some clubs refused to release players, and some players boycotted the national team. Could these problems disrupt your work with the team?

Coach Ralph Jean-Louis: I believe that all federations face problems with their national teams. Yes, we have encountered challenges with clubs holding control over players. However, we wanted to continue with this project. After these two matches, we will try to work with the teams and have individual conversations with the players. Every country aims to have a strong team for international competitions like the World Cup.

Interviewer: We also heard that you are uncertain about leading this team after the two matches, including the one against Ivory Coast and Kenya. Do you feel you are in the right position to work with this young team for an extended period and strengthen them for the future?

Coach Ralph Jean-Louis: I agree with you. We are currently under a temporary contract for these two matches. However, like any group, we intended to establish a long-term project. This team is formed to achieve our goals within two to four years. We will assess this aspect when we return. Ultimately, it will be the federation’s decision regarding who will continue with the team.

Interviewer: Tomorrow you play against Ivory Coast, a team that you respect. How will you approach this match against a team with such quality?

Coach Ralph Jean-Louis: We will decide on the game plan during tonight’s training session. As I mentioned earlier, this is a new project, and we cannot disclose all the information. We understand that playing against Ivory Coast on their home ground will be challenging. We anticipate difficulties, but we will remain focused on our objectives and strive to leave the match with our heads held high.

Good morning! It’s match day for the young Seychelles team! As the day begins, our guys are slowly waking up and making their way to a well-deserved breakfast.

Despite the rainy afternoon in Abidjan yesterday, they successfully completed their initial field sessions. To maintain their focus, we chose not to provide updates during the afternoon. Don’t worry, we’ll share the highlights once they’ve finished their task.

Gabon – Kenya
Gabon is favored in their match against Kenya. Led by Marseille’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Gabon’s attack features Denis Bouanga, the top scorer in the MLS, and Red Star Belgrade’s Gelor Kanga. Kenya’s key player is Michael Olunga from Al Duhail. Gabon’s recent form includes three losses and a draw.

Burundi – Gambia
In their first-ever official meeting, Burundi and Gambia face off. Gambia comes in with an unbeaten run, led by Ablie Jallow’s attacking skills. Burundi relies on Bonfils-Caleb Bimenyimana’s goal-scoring ability. It’s an exciting matchup between these two teams.

LIVE Updates – 12:45
We are reading world sports news, and now, here is what the world thinks and predicts about the upcoming match.

Ranked ninth among all African teams, Ivory Coast enters the World Cup qualifiers with high hopes of securing a spot in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In the previous edition, they narrowly missed out on qualification by two points, losing to Cameroon, who went on to deny Algeria a place in the tournament. However, Ivory Coast has shown improvement, reaching the last 16 of the African Nations Championship and finishing second in their AFCON qualifying group. The team is currently on an unbeaten streak, including draws against South Africa and Morocco.

While Ivory Coast is favored to win, it’s important not to overlook Seychelles. Despite recent struggles, with three consecutive losses in the COSAFA Cup, Seychelles’ players are motivated to put on a good performance and, if possible, score a goal. It’s worth noting that theirs only victory in the last 50 matches, spanning several years, came against Bangladesh in a friendly.

As the World Cup qualification campaign begins, both teams will definitely give their all. It promises to be an exciting contest between Ivory Coast’s experience and Seychelles’ determination to overcome their winless run and create an upset.

LIVE Updates – 11:40
After a long journey, players recognised the need for rest and went to bed early. They were advised by the coaching staff to get at least 8 hours of sleep and avoid using their phones before bedtime, which helps improve sleep quality.

The team’s staff has arranged a special diet plan for the players during their stay in Abidjan. Carefully selected meals will provide them with the necessary nutrition to compete at their best against their opponents.

In preparation for the matches, the team conducted video analysis sessions and held a brief meeting to discuss upcoming plans and maintain a positive mindset. The players are feeling refreshed and ready to put in the hard work required.

Today’s agenda consists of light exercises to combat the effects of their long flights, followed by video analysis to refine their strategies.

One thing that stands out is the pleasant and chilled atmosphere among the players. The Seychelles team not only shows great teamwork on the field but also off the field, as seen through their interactions on social media.

Team member Nick Labiche is highly confident in the group’s motivation and performance for the upcoming games. He believes they are well-prepared and poised to give their best.

Under the guidance of head coach Ralph Jean-Louis, the national team enters a new era filled with hope and potential. With a youthful and talented squad, Seychelles aims to make a lasting impact on the international stage. The players are eager to showcase their skills and demonstrate the progress they’ve made.

However, the coaching staff has faced last-minute changes, leading to uncertainties. Sadly, striker Matthew Rouillon, a footballer from Rovers FC, sustained an injury just two days ago, ruling him out of the plans. Despite this setback, the team remains resilient and determined to overcome challenges.

As Seychelles sets its sights on World Cup qualification, the nation stands united in support of its national team. The journey to Abidjan signifies a defining moment in the country’s football history. Fans can expect thrilling encounters and fierce competition as the team faces off against strong opponents.

Ralph Jean-Louis (Head Coach)

We want to prepare Seychelles for the future and give some international experience to young players with the objective of performing well in the next Indian Ocean Games.

Lead coach Jean-Louis has outlined the team’s objectives for the upcoming matches. The first goal is to score at least one goal in both matches, particularly against Côte d’Ivoire, to boost the confidence of the young players and motivate them to perform better.

The second objective is for the players to cover a specific distance during the matches. Initially set at 100km, the target has been adjusted to between 70 and 80km per match, which would be a significant accomplishment.

The team’s third objective is to achieve a total of 150 passes during the match. According to Jean-Louis, these objectives are realistic, and the players have the capability to achieve them.
