Cover Story (view full-size image): In the delicate equilibrium between health and disease, the gut microbiota emerges as a pivotal player, orchestrating far more than metabolic functions. Recent scientific revelations have unveiled its unsuspected role in regulating sleep homeostasis, a fundamental pillar of well-being. This narrative takes us into the depths of our own biology, where the ancient, microbial inhabitants of our gut communicate with the brain, influencing our sleep patterns together and through the microbial influence on metabolic functions. As modern lifestyles skew sleep rhythms, they simultaneously nudge our gut microbiota, setting the stage for a cascade of health implications, including metabolic syndrome (MetS) and sleep disorders.
