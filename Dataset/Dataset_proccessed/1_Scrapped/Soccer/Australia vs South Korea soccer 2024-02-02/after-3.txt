You should probably go back to bed, and I should probably wrap this blog up. Commiserations to Socceroos fans, and thanks for your company throughout their campaign; congratulations to South Korea’s unconquerable optimists. Bye!

It must be a weird experience preparing a composite image like this ahead of a game you are desperate for your country to win.

It wasn’t the the ending we imagined or wanted.

Thank you Australia for your support throughout the @afcasiancup! 💚💛#Socceroos #AsianCup2023 #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/jlpfKWqdO5

South Korea’s run in this tournament is starting to evoke Ken Doherty’s run to the final of the 2003 World Snooker Championship. In the sphere of dramatic comebacks, there’s no higher praise than that.

By the end, all the key stats were in South Korea’s favour

Possession 73-27

Shots on target 9-5

Goals 2-1

But most of those shots on target came in extra time when Australia had nothing left. Had Australia won 1-0 or 2-0 it would have been a textbook rope-a-dope victory.

“Although Arnie’s decision to bring on Miller proved catastrophic, it was his faith in the normally reliable twin pillars of Duke and Souttar that did for him in the end,” says Chris Paraskevas. “While Souttar was desperately nursed back to match fitness, it was perhaps 45 minutes too late, his legs giving way a little early tonight. The preference for Duke was understandable - strong, selfless, good in the air - but he looked out of sorts in this tournament (and especially tonight) and isn’t mobile or clinical enough. Aa penny for Jamie McClaren’s thoughts.

“Maybe this is the game that epitomised the positives and limitations of Arnold’s tactical style: his Socceroos will always give you a game, but when required... they simply aren’t set-up to run the game. Nonetheless... you feel for him.”

Quite. Despite watching all five games in this tournament, I still don’t know whether he’s shackling a potentially good team or getting the best out of a limited one. I guess we’ll find out under the next manager.

Craig Goodwin, whose fine volley put Australia ahead, gives his reaction

It’s pure disappointment at the moment. We’re one minute away from going through. We had chances to put the game away in the second half; there were a few times we should have scored the second goal. There’s nothing but disappointment at the moment. To be honest, I don’t know what to say.

Korea are a great team with great players and we gave them opportunities from set-pieces that we didn’t need to. For [Lewis Miller], it’s a learning curve – not just for him, for anyone. He’s unlucky to give away the penalty, because I thought it was one that could have gone the other way. It’s done now. We’re disappointed and that’s it.

When the immediate pain starts to abate, Australia will reflect on a strange tournament. They were never convincing in attack, yet they were two minutes of injury-time away from reaching a very winnable semi-final.

South Korea will play Jordan in the semi-final after another improbable comeback. The Australian players look devastated: they gave everything they had, and it was this close to being enough. But Son Heung-min - who is on his haunches, haemorrhaging tears of joy - bent the game to his will and his skill. He forced an injury-time penalty, converted nervelessly by Hwang Hee-chan, and scored the winner in extra-time with a majestic free-kick.

119 min: Outstanding double save by Ryan! How are Australia still alive? South Korea broke four on three, with Son on the ball. He played in Seol (I think), whose stinging shot was beaten away by Ryan. leaping to his left. The ball ran loose and Ryan sprang to his feet to block the follow-up shot on the line.

113 min: Chance for Son! South Korea break three on two, with Australia’s defenders looking very weary. It’s played to the right for Son, who drags a low shot wide of the far post from the edge of the area. For him, though not everyone, that’s a pretty good chance.

112 min “Slept through my alarm and only saw the last 15 minutes but I saw that coming from 90 minutes away,” says James Paraskevas. “Classic Graham Arnold defending on a lead. Was always going to happen? Miller thinks he’s playing for St Mirren against Falkirk on a wet and windy Sunday afternoon - what was he thinking?”

It’s easy for me to say, as I’m not invested, but if Miller doesn’t make that tackle or Duke scores one of his two chances, I think it would be seen as a superb performance tactically – an homage to those old Mourinho masterclasses.

108 min “Not only did Australia have 48 hours extra rest, but Korea went an extra 30 minutes on Tuesday,” says Joe Pearson. “They should be Luka Modric-level tired.”

This game has been a good advert for letting the ball do the work. The margins are gossamer-thin, though. Had Miller not made that tackle in injury time, Australia would have been deserved winners. Since then, they’ve been overwhelmed to such an extent that it’s hard to argue against South Korea being the better team overall.

Half time in extra time: Australia 1-2 South Korea

Australia were 1-0 up after 95 minutes of normal time. Now they are a goal and a man down after a chastening first period of extra-time. South Korea dominated throughout and took the lead through a terrific free-kick from Son Heung-min. If that was bad enough, Aiden O’Neill’s red card has left the Socceroos needing a minor miracle.

105+5 min Australia are down to 10 men; Hwang pumps the air in celebration. O’Neill wasn’t happy with the yellow card, but he keeps his counsel as he walks off the field.

105+3 min It’s still being checked, and the player – it was Hwang Hee-chan – is still down. In the Premier League that would be a red card, because his studs plunged into Hwang’s ankle. The referee is going to the monitor.

105+1 min O’Neill is booked for a crunching challenge on … I’m not sure who it was actually. He won the ball but was penalised for an aggressive follow-through, and there’s a VAR check for a possible red card.

105 min Australia look broken. I really feel for Lewis Miller, who conceded the penalty and the free-kick that led to both goals.

12.46 EST

For 90+4 minutes, Son Heung-min was a relatively peripheral figure in this game. Then he won a penalty to keep South Korea in the competition, and now he has put them in front! It was a superb free-kick, clipped over the wall towards the near post. Ryan flew across his goal and got a hand to the ball but could only help it into the net.

Could Ryan have done better? Not with the save, maybe with his positioning because it wasn’t right in the corner. But it was a beautiful free-kick, curled over the ball with enough dip to make the save extremely difficult for Ryan.

102 min Miller trips Hwang just outside the area, a foul for which he might have been booked. The free-kick is a fair way to the left of centre, though not enough to rule out a shot from Son…

101 min “As a Wolves fan I’m delighted that Hwang Hee-chan put away that last-minute penalty, as I was very nervous for him when you said that he would be taking it,” writes Chris Redston. “Some fans want countries with players of their Premier League team to go out early, so they can come back to play for their clubs, but I’m delighted that Channy has kept Korea in the match and hope he goes on to score the winner in the final. He’s a lovely, humble guy and deserves all the success he can get for his country.”

The dominant attitude towards Afcon and the Asian Cup, certainly in England, has a whiff of something not entirely fragrant.
