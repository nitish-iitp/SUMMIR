The second round of FIFA World Cup qualifying in Oceania has kicked off in Fiji, with wins for the home side over Solomon Islands, and for New Caledonia over Papua New Guinea. 

A red card just beffore half time left the Bula Boys down to 10 men for more than half the match, but the Solomons couldn't break them down and Fiji held on for a 1-0 win.

And after nearly a year away from the international scene because of the political problems at home, New Caledonia didn't appear to have suffered any ill effects winning 3-1 over the Kapuls. 

 The underdogs among the eight competing  teams in Oceania, will be Samoa.

After narrowly defeating American Samoa and Tonga in round one to get this far, the Samoans begin the next stage of their campaign against Vanuatu tomorrow, before taking on Tahiti and then New Zealand next month.

The squad have been warming up in Fiji where they took on club side Lautoka, and the Fijian national team in a match played behind closed doors, which the Bula Boys won, but only 2-1, compared to 9-1 when the sides last met in the OFC Nations Cup.

So there's some encouragement there for Samoa, and Head Coach, Jess Ibrom, says they have nothing to lose, but he concedes they will still have to play above themselves to achieve positive results.
