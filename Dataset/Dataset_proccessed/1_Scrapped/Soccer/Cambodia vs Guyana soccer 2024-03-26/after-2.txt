FIFA Series: Omari Glasgow leads Guyana’s 4-1 triumph over Cambodia

Omari Glasgow scored a double as Guyana defeated Cambodia 4-1 in their final match of the inaugural FIFA Series at the Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Stadium in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Leo Lovell and Ryan Khedoo were the other two men on the scoresheet for the Golden Jaguars, who should leave the series full of confidence after two commendable performances against teams outside of CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football).

Just over a quarter of an hour into the contest, Guyana had a clear chance when Kadel Daniel made an unchallenged cross on goal but it met no one’s feet.

However, the impressive Glasgow capitalised on another cross by Daniel as he leaped over the defender at the far post to head Guyana’s first goal of the match.

Sieng Chanthea scored in the 53rd to level proceedings for the Southeast Asian side, currently ranked 179th by FIFA.

After that, his teammates were guilty of bringing down Jalen Jones in the penalty area.

Glasgow completed his brace and 16th goal for Guyana in 22 matches with an ice-cool penalty to reassert Guyana’s dominance.

The Golden Jaguars’ confidence grew, and the Cambodian keeper parried Deon Moore’s shot on goal into the path of an alert Lovell, who extended the lead in the 80th.

But that was not the end, as there was more agony for Cambodia and joy for Guyana as Khedoo controlled a well-directed pass from Elliot Bonds to seal Guyana’s faith in the 91st.

The outstanding performance was a rebound for the agonizing 1-0 defeat to Cabo Verde in the opening match on March 21.

These matches are part of a new initiative approved by the FIFA Council in 2023, where in every even-numbered year, the world governing body will host matches across the six confederations.

The Golden Jaguars return home, and their focus will shift to the FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers, which commence with a clash against powerhouses Panama on June 6.
