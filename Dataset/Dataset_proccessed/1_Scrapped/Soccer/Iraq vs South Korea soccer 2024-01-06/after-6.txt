SEOUL, Jan. 6 (Yonhap) -- South Korea held off Iraq 1-0 in their final tuneup match before the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Midfielder Lee Jae-sung scored the first goal late in the first half at New York University Abu Dhabi Stadium, but the Taegeuk Warriors were unable to add to that lead in the second half despite dominating the run of play.

South Korea played the final handful of minutes a man down after Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Lee Kang-in was sent off on two consecutive yellow cards after some shoving match with Ahmed Yahya, who only received one yellow card despite initiating contact.

South Korea have now won six straight matches. They have scored 20 goals and conceded none during this stretch.

Coached by Jurgen Klinsmann, South Korea set up pre-Asian Cup training camp in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. They will travel to the Asian Cup host country of Qatar next Wednesday.

South Korea will try to win their first Asian Cup since 1960. The top AFC men's tournament kicks off next Friday, and South Korea's first Group E match is Jan. 15 against Bahrain.

They will then play Jordan on Jan. 20 and Malaysia on Jan. 25.

There are six groups of four nations. The top two teams from each group, plus four best third-place teams, will advance to the knockouts.

Iraq will play in Group D against Japan, Indonesia and Vietnam. If South Korea win Group E and Iraq finish second in Group D, they will square off in the round of 16 on Jan. 31 in Doha.
