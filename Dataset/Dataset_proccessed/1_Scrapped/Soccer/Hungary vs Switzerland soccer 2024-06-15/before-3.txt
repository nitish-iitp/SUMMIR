EURO 2024: ROY KEANE CRITICAL OF ANDY ROBERTSON’S ‘RUBBISH’ RESPONSE TO SCOTLAND DRUBBING AT HANDS OF GERMANY
BYANDREW WRIGHT

UPDATED 14/06/2024 AT 22:27 GMT

Roy Keane said Andy Robertson was talking “rubbish” after Scotland’s 5-1 loss to Germany in the opening game of Euro 2024. Robertson conceded that Scotland were well below their best and that Germany’s gameplan “worked a million times better”. Scotland face Switzerland next as they bid to bounce back, while hosts Germany take on Hungary.

Roy Keane was left bemused by comments made by Andy Robertson after 10-man Scotland were thrashed 5-1 by hosts Germany in the opening game of Euro 2024.
Robertson, the Scotland captain, admitted the visitors “weren’t aggressive enough” and that the gameplan of their opponents “worked a million times better”.

“First half we just got it all wrong,” Robertson told ITV. “We didn’t really show up, weren’t aggressive enough, let good players on the ball and they obviously had a gameplan and we did and their gameplan worked a million times better than ours, but it wasn’t because of the practise, it’s because we didn’t put it together on the pitch.

“When big occasions come like this you have to do that and unfortunately we didn’t do that in the first half.”
In response, Keane dismissed Robertson’s remarks as “rubbish”.
“It’s all well and good having a plan,” Keane began. “It’s no good talking after the game about we had a gameplan. It’s rubbish from Andrew Robertson. It’s just rubbish coming out.
“You knew before the game what was at stake. It’s no good after the game saying we’ll regroup and we’ll be angry tomorrow. No, you should be angry for a long time.
“He said that we weren’t aggressive enough. You have to be aggressive in a game of football. But you are up against opposition who are much stronger than you.
“The talent we saw with the German players because they were given time is great to watch. But my goodness, when you’re playing football at this level, you’ve got to hit people. Hit them properly, hit them aggressively, do it the right way.”

The Scots, competing in a second successive European Championship, fell behind in the 10th minute when Florian Wirtz found the net and it quickly went from bad to worse.
Jamal Musiala doubled Germany’s lead nine minutes later before Scotland were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of half-time when Ryan Porteus was sent off and conceded a penalty.
Kai Havertz converted from the spot to make it 3-0 in a dismal opening period before Niklas Fullkrug and Emre Can found the net in the second half either side of a consolation Antonio Rudiger own goal.
Robertson praised the fighting spirit Scotland displayed after the break before turning his attention to the crucial clash against Switzerland on Wednesday.
“In the second half we’re down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well to be fair to them,” Robertson added. “We lose a sloppy goal at the end, but we could have drawn the second half.
“It’s no consolation. We’re well backed over here, we’ve got so many good supporters and yeah, today was hugely disappointing, but you’re playing against the host nation and it’s the first game.
“You don’t get much tougher than that. We have to bounce back quickly because there was a lot of things wrong about today and we have to sort it because it’s a quick turnaround to Wednesday.”
