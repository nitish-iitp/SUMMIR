The next round of fixtures in the qualification stage for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations is heating up, with a number of countries going head-to-head in crucial clashes which could all but confirm their spot in the continental showpiece.

The Gambia is set to go up against Madagascar at the El Abdi Stadium, in their fourth fixture in group A. For Gambia, a win is necessary to keep their fight alive to qualify for the next Afcon and play in the competition for a consecutive time.

Northern Irishman Johnathan McKinstry took over as Scorpions boss in May, and his mandate is clear. Gambia’s targets are to qualify for the next Afcon as well as the 2026 World Cup.

Elsewhere, Kenya will have a go again against Cameroon at the Mandela National Stadium after they faced a heavy defeat against the Indomitable Lions with a 4-1 scoreline on Friday.

Kenya coach Engin First is demanding much-improved results from the Harambee Stars in this re-match.

"The first half was the worst in my time in Kenya. We made too many mistakes, especially with the first goal, but in the end, Cameroon played well,” he said.

"[Christian] Bassogog was exceptional today. I've never seen him so active as he was in this match. We trained for these transitions, but it didn't matter in the final moments."

Liberia is also set to play against Equatorial Guinea, Zimbabwe faces off against Namibia, Togo will lock horns with Algeria and the last fixture of the day will be Eswatini taking on Mozambique at the Mbombela Stadium.
