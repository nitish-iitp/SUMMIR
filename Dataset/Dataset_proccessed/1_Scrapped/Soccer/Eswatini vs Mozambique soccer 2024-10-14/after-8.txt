Mozambique ended their latest 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying assignments on a high note following a convincing 3-0 victory over Eswatini in Group I at the Mbombela Stadium on Monday night.

Mozambique dominated the ball possession count in the first 10 minutes of the match and gave Eswatini little time on the ball. With a couple of attempts at goal, Mozambique were clearly the better outfit early on.

After piling on the pressure inside the Eswatini half, Mozambique broke the deadlock moments after the 10-minute mark as Domingues got his name on the scoresheet with a right-footed shot inside the area.

Mozambique came agonisingly close to doubling their advantage in the 18th minute through a headed effort by Clesio following a corner situation. However, the winger’s effort went wide of the mark. Os Mambas continued to boss proceedings in Mbombela midway through the first-half while Eswatini battled to string passes together under pressure.

Mozambique’s pressure paid moments before the break as Stanley Ratifo added his name to the scoresheet with a towering header from the middle of the 18-yard-area. With two goals to the good, Os Mambas headed into the break in pole position to bag maximum points.

Eswatini looked lively after the restart and created two scoring opportunities before the 52nd minute. Mozambique on the other hand, looked shaky during this period but did well to ward off Eswatini’s attacks.

Mozambique remained on the front foot for much of the second-half and had little to do on a defensive front, especially after scoring their third goal. With the clock ticking down, Eswatini’s chance at getting a result from the tie diminished rapidly.

Nevertheless, Mozambique ended their latest 2025 Afcon qualifying encounter in victory, putting Mali and Guinea-Bissau on high alert in the process.

Eswatini: (0) 0

Mozambique: (2) 3 (Domingues 11’ Ratifo 41, Catamo 59’)
