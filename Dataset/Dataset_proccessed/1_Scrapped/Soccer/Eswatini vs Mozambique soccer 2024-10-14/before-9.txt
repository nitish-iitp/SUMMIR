Now in the last chance saloon to qualify for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, Eswatini entertain the challenge of Mozambique at the Mbombela Stadium on Monday evening.

Mozambique, meanwhile, make the journey in search of a victory that could all but confirm their place in next year's continental showpiece.

Eswatini just about kept their pursuit of an AFCON place alive with a 1-1 stalemate against Mozambique in Friday's meeting between the teams at Estadio da Machava.

Zdravko Logarusic's men found themselves behind for a fourth match running as they trailed to Stanley Ratifo's opener before Thubelihle Mavuso restored parity 10 minutes from the end of regulation time.

That snapped a three-game losing run for the Sihlangu Semnikati since their last meeting against Mozambique, which ended in a goalless COSAFA CUP draw back in June.

As the teams renew hostilities on Tuesday, the bulk of the pressure will definitely be on Eswatini, who have recorded just one point from their three outings and sit bottom of Group I.

Having failed to qualify for any of the previous 34 editions, anything less than a win for the home side in this one would see their wait for a first taste of AFCON action continue.

Mozambique were guilty of throwing away a lead for the second time in three matches as they dropped two points in the final knockings of their clash against Eswatini last time out.

Nonetheless, Chiquinho Conde's men are now unbeaten in 13 of 15 outings across all competitions since the turn of the year, including a win and two draws from three AFCON qualifiers.

A tally of five points from a possible nine has left Os Mambas currently second in the group, two points shy of Mali and two clear of Guinea-Bissau in third midway through the qualifiers.

Off the back of yet another group-stage exit in Ivory Coast earlier this year, Mozambique are eyeing consecutive AFCON appearances for the first time since 1998 and are well-placed to make it through.

Taking on an opposing side who had drawn five consecutive blanks prior to Friday's game, the visitors will fancy their chances of coming away with a victory on enemy territory.

Stanley Ratifo continued his hot streak in front of goal with a fifth strike in six games last time out, and the striker will be aiming to come up trumps once again.

Despite only just making his debut appearance in early June, Pepo Santos has already nailed down a starting berth in the heart of the away side's midfield.

Thubelihle Mavuso could be rewarded with a place in the Eswatini lineup here after coming off the bench to net a crucial equaliser against Mozambique.

Sandile Gamedze is in the biggest danger of dropping to the bench for Mavuso, having not found the back of the net on the international scene since July 2022.


Eswatini possible starting lineup:
Gama; Thwala, Quiton, Mkhonta, Manana; Matsebula, Matsenjwa, Magagula; Mavuso, Figuareido, Mkhontfo

Mozambique possible starting lineup:
Ivane; Matola, Nene, Reinildo, Langa; Amadu, Santos; Catamo, Domingues, Gildo; Ratifo




We say: Eswatini 1-1 Mozambique

Eswatini have struggled at the top end of the pitch of late, but we are backing them to register for a second game running here.

That said, we can also see the teams cancelling each other out to settle for a point apiece in the end.
