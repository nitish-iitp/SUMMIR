Eswatini will face off against Mozambique at Mbombela Stadium in a bid to secure their first win of the group tomorrow. The hosts will be determined to make it out of the group phase for the first time this campaign, and it’s going to be an arduous task against the guests.

Eswatini

FIFA Ranking: 159th


Last five games: LDLLD

The King's Shield secured their first point of the group a against Mozambique on the road. Eswatini were lucky to have split points on the road as they were the second-best in the encounter. The hosts have lost twice and drawn once over their previous three group matches, scoring once and conceding three. 


Eswatini are yet to grace the AFCON tournament in their history and it will be a dream come true if they manage to cement one of the two spots in the group. 


Eswatini have won twice over their last eighteen games in all competitions. 

Mozambique

FIFA Ranking: 99th


Last two games: WWDWD

Chiquinho Conde's men settled for a share of the spoils against Eswatini in a game they dominated from the start to the end. After scoring their first goal in the 73rd minute, the guests responded seven minutes later to secure a point. 

Mozambique have been extremely aggressive in their approach to securing a space in the next AFCON Tournament, picking up five points from a possible nine. Mozambique have drawn twice and won three in their previous five games in all competitions. They occupy the second spot on the log, and a win here will boost their morale. 

Expert Betting Tips

The reserve leg ended in a (1-1) stalemate as Mozambique failed to protect their lead. Mozambique have been at the top of their game in this competition, winning once and settling for two stalemates. 


This game will be played in South Africa, and we think the guests will get it right this time after their poor game management a few days ago; bet on an away win or draw and over 1.5 goals for 1.91.

We expect both teams to settle for a halftime stalemate for 1.87.

This game will produce more goals after the break for 2.23.

Good luck!
