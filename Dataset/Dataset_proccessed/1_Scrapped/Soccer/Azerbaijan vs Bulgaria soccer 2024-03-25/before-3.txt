<image:caption>The one person I'm thinking about in all this, the one person my heart goes out to in every way, is William. From his parents' separation when he was only ten years old, to their subsequent divorce, followed swiftly by his mother's untimely death, we have continued to witness life throwing hardships at him, over and over. (Pictured: Harry and William with Diana).</image:caption>

<image:caption>In more recent years, he's weathered mounting discord with his only sibling Harry and sister-in-law Meghan, most recently his father's cancer, and now this - an unexpected and tragic burden on top of everything else.</image:caption>
</image:image>

<image:caption>Undoubtedly, the distance with Harry is felt particularly keenly. After all, he is the only person who might fully understand what this is like. The only person who also endured both divorce and the death of a parent, in such a devastatingly public setting, is irreconcilably estranged.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Surely too many rocks have been thrown, too much hurt, too much wounding for Harry to offer any solace or strength to William.</image:caption>

<image:caption>William's pain right now is even more profound given his three young children: George, 10, Charlotte, 8, and Louis, just 5. They are not much younger than William was when his mother passed, and that trauma and grief, the specific fear of losing a mother, is no doubt something he will bend heaven and Earth to shield them from.</image:caption>

But, after dropping the weekly injections, users would put back on two-thirds of the weight within the next year</image:caption>

<image:caption>Despite being hailed as one of the most powerful pharmaceutical tools to date, experts have warned it is not a 'magic pill' or miracle fix all. Trials have shown that users can rapidly pile pounds back on once they stop taking the drug and it can trigger a variety of nasty side effects. Users commonly complain of nausea, constipation and diarrhoea</image:caption>

<image:caption>This week Stephen Fry also admitted his 'astonishing' weight loss came at a price, after Ozempic caused him to vomit up to five times a day. He said: 'The first week or so, I was thinking, "This is astonishing. Not only do I not want to eat, I don't want any alcohol of any kind. This is going to be brilliant. 'Then I started feeling sick, and I started getting sicker and sicker and sicker. I was throwing up four, five times a day and I thought, "I can't do this". So that's it. The new variant, Tirzepatide Mounjaro, makes it even worse apparently'</image:caption>

<image:caption>A spike in demand for the jabs, fuelled by celebrity endorsements, has also seen global stocks run low. Shortages are expected to last until mid-2024 at the earliest. Boy George and Sharon Osbourne are among other celebs who have admitted to taking the medication</image:caption>

<image:caption>Mounting evidence, however, suggests that in the real world, the drugs' side-effects such as vomiting and diarrhoea are proving so common and overwhelming that it makes the current versions impractical for most patients to stay on for very long. The result is very high patient drop-out rates in real life because of side-effects. Pictured, Oprah Winfrey who has also admitted to taking Ozempic</image:caption>
