India vs Afghanistan Live: India defeated!
Sunil Chhetri in tears as India lose the match 1-2 despite taking the lead. The skipper could not have done more and in his absence, the team ended up conceding twice. A big loss for the team and more importantly, head coach Igor Stimac.

India vs Afghanistan Live: AFG take the lead
What a turnaround and Afghanistan have taken the lead. A moment of madness from Gurpreet as he crashed into the Afghanistan striker. Penalty for Afghanistan and Sharif Mukhammad made no mistake. India will be shattered right now.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Tough period of play
India are constantly trying to find a space in the opponent box but the compact defense from Afghanistan has been quite impressive. A couple of threatening crosses but except from a wayward header from Manvir, not much to show for the hosts.

India vs Afghanistan Live: What a save!
Skandari received the ball in midfield and following a solid run, he took a brilliant long-range shot. However, Gurpreet was wary of the danger and a brilliant diving save made sure that the score remained 1-1. What a match this is turning out to be!

India vs Afghanistan Live: AFG make it 1-1
 Rahmat Akbari scores the equaliser and Afghanistan have made it 1-1. A huge defensive error from India and incidentally, it came just minutes after Sunil Chhetri was substituted by head coach Igor Stimac. Tough time ahead of the hosts.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Big chance for Afghanistan
A good shot from Afghanistan and probably the best chance of the game for the visitors but it was not on target. It sailed way above the goal and relief for India. The past five minutes have seen a lot of attack from Afghanistan and India need to find their rhythm once again.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Setback for India
Apuia has picked up an injury. Not a great news for India but they have the necessary reinforcements on their bench. However, it looks like he will be able to continue.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Wasted opportunities
Two short corners but the strategy did not work out well for India. It has been a good start for the hosts in the second half but as usual, the finishing has been less than satisfactory.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Time for second half
Time for the second half. Advantage India as of now but it takes a few seconds for the situation of any match to completely change. Sunil Chhetri will be looking for more goals while the rest of the team will have to provide proper support.

India vs Afghanistan Live: First half done
It is half-time and advantage India. Cometh the hour, cometh the man - A line apt for Sunil Chhetri. 150th appearance for the national side and he did not fail to score from the spot. A shaky show from India but the goal will be a massive boost.

A penalty for India and Sunil Chhetri has done it. 25th, 50th, 75th, 100th, 125th and now 150th - He has scored on every major occasion now. What a fabulous player!

End-to-end stuff in the match with both sides creating terrific chances in front of the goal. An effort from Subhasish was just wide of the target while Afghanistan striker's header was saved brilliantly by Gurpreet.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Yellow card
First booking of the match and the yellow card goes to Brandon Fernandes. Afghanistan were starting to look dangerous on the attack and Brandon had no other choice but to drag the Afghanistan football down near the half-way line.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Testing times
Afghanistan are not going to be completely defensive in this game and they found themselves in a good position in front of the Indian goal. A solid long-range effort but it was thankfully blocked by Anwar Ali and the rebound was wasted by the opposition.

An early intent from India and the ball found Sunil Chhetri in an absolutely brilliant position but the veteran striker was just offside. Afghanistan also tried to create a couple of attacks but right now, the game is mostly being played in the midfield.

We are minutes away from the match and a victory will be very important for the Indian football team. If they can even finish second in Group A, it will guarantee their passage to the next round of qualification.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Other goal threat
All eyes will certainly be on Sunil Chhetri who will be playing his 150th match but the other major goal threat for India will be Manvir Singh. Considered by many as the favourite to succeed Chhetri as the main striker, Manvir has shown glimpses of genius in the past and a good performance will further strengthen his case.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Tricky opponent
Afghanistan have been a tricky opposition for India in the past few years as was evident in their previous meeting. Afghanistan mainly depend on their compact defense in order to keep the Indian wingers at bay and that can once again be their strategy.
