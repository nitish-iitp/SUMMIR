Ghana, nicknamed Black Stars, go into the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with a 41-year title drought weighing on their shoulders, a significant contrast to their previous dominance in the tournament.

Their most notable achievements include winning the title in their first two appearances in 1963 and 1965, followed by a third title in 1978. However, their success was short-lived, as they failed to qualify for the next three editions.

They did manage to win the title again in 1982 but have since struggled to replicate that success. In recent years, they have suffered heartbreaking losses, including a defeat to Egypt in the 2010 final and a loss to Ivory Coast in the 2015 final.

Under the leadership of coach Chris Hughton, Ghana hopes to turn their fortunes around and regain their status as a top contender in African football. They face a tough challenge in Group B, where they will compete against Egypt, Cape Verde, and Mozambique.

22 January 2024: Mozambique v Ghana

Key Players to Watch:

Mohammed Kudus:

At just 23 years old, Mohammed Kudus is set to make his debut in the AFCON, yet his impact on the Black Stars has been palpable across all aspects.
His remarkable free-kick against the Central African Republic set the stage for a memorable comeback in Ghana’s last AFCON qualifier at the Baba Yara Stadium.

Inaki Williams:

The Athletic Bilbao forward brings a dynamic and explosive attacking style to the team.
Known for his speed and goal-scoring ability, Williams will be a key asset in Ghana’s quest for success in the tournament.

Antoine Semenyo:

The Bournemouth attacker has swiftly become a go-to figure for Ghana’s attack when clinicality is needed.
His pivotal goal against Angola in Kumasi played a crucial role in Ghana’s qualification success, and his brilliant cameo against CAR contributed to securing crucial points for Ghana.

Coach: Chris Hughton

Initially appointed as a technical advisor to the Black Stars in 2022, Hughton played a key role in Ghana’s victory over Nigeria in the final World Cup qualification playoff in March 2022. Following a disappointing World Cup campaign, he took over from former coach Otto Addo.

However, questions have been raised about Hughton’s tactical acumen, particularly after defeats to Mexico, USA and Comoros. With criticisms looming, Hughton is expected to seek vindication through stellar performances as Ghana approaches another major tournament.

Team Statistics:

Appearances so far: 23

Best Results: Champions in 1963, 1965, 1978 and 1982.

Worst performance: Group stage in 1980, 1984, 1998, 2006 and 2021.

Most capped player: Andre Ayew with 115 appearances

Captain: Andre Ayew

Top scorer: Asamoah Gyan 51 goals in 109 appearances

 

The AFCON tournament will start on January 13, 2024 and conclude on February 11.
