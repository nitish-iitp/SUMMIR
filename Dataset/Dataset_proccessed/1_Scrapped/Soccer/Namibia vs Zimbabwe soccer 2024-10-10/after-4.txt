Zimbabwe senior national team coach Michael Nees celebrated his first win as the Warriors gaffer following his appointment at the start of September.

The German tactician led the team to a narrow 1-0 victory over Namibia in an AFCON qualifier at an empty Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa.

Yadah FC midfield maestro, Khama Billiat was the match winner after converting a penalty in the first half.

The penalty kick was awarded after Udinese’s defender Jordan Zemura was fouled inside the box.

Billiat stepped up to convert the spot kick, hitting the net although he almost spoiled the day for the Zimbabweans after his penalty was almost saved.

Despite Zimbabwe’s win which is their first in AFCON and World Cup qualifiers since their FIFA ban was lifted, their performance was far from convincing.

The Warriors struggled to maintain ball possession, a consistent rhythm and lacked creativeness in the final third.

Namibia could have equalised had they been clinical in front of goal, with one of their chances hitting the upright.

On the other hand, a lackadaisical Warriors side almost doubled the lead through Daniel Msendami whose shot in the second half also hit the upright.

Apart from Msendami, substitute Douglas Mapfumo could have scored the second goal in the final stages of the match.

However, the Polokwane City forward opted to shoot instead of passing Zemura, who was in a better position to find the net.

Mapfumo went for goal but his effort was pushed out for a corner by the Namibian shot stopper whose ball distribution proved dangerous in most of the Brave Warriors’ counter attacks.

With the victory, Zimbabwe now top Group J with five points.

They are one point ahead of Kenya and Cameroon who are second and third respectively but are yet to play each other.

Zimbabwe will play Namibia again on Monday in the second leg of the AFCON qualifier.
