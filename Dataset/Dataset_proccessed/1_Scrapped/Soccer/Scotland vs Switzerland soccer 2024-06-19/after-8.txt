EURO 2024
SCOTLAND 1-1 SWITZERLAND - SCOTLAND STILL ALIVE AT EURO 2024 AFTER NERVE-WRACKING DRAW WITH SWITZERLAND
BYRHYS JONES

UPDATED 19/06/2024 AT 21:50 GMT

Steve Clarke’s Scotland side are still alive at Euro 2024 after a nerve-wracking 1-1 draw with Switzerland after Xherdan Shaqiri’s stunner cancelled out Scott McTominay’s opener. The result means that Scotland sit third in the group on one point but know that a win in their last group game over Hungary would potentially send them through depending on the other groups.

Scotland and Switzerland drew 1-1 in Cologne on Wednesday in a chaotic game in Group A of Euro 2024, which saw Scotland keep their hopes of qualification alive.
The Scots were a changed side compared to the team that were demolished in Munich five days ago. They opened the scoring after a 10-minute passage that saw them show more intensity and astuteness than they did in the entire 90 minutes against Germany.

Scott McTominay’s shot capped off a quick counter-attack, with Fabian Schar getting in the way and turning it into his own goal although the goal was later given to the Manchester United man.

But a stunner from Xherdan Shaqiri levelled the scores roughly 13 minutes later with the winger profiting from Scotland’s poor attempt to play out from the back.
While Scotland will be buoyed by taking a point, a hamstring injury to Kieran Tierney could end his tournament and sees Steve Clarke’s side robbed of one of their most valuable pieces.
After being thumped 5-1 by Germany in the competition's opening game, Scotland emerged lively and threatening straight from kick-off against Switzerland. Unlike against the hosts, this side, marshalled by Brighton’s Billy Gilmour in midfield, were much sharper in all facets of play and that was instantly noticeable.
If their improved quality was not clear from the opening 10 minutes in which they balanced intensity and calmness, it was by the 13th when Scotland took the opening goal with pure incision and a fine move down the left.
McTominay headed away a Swiss corner and Robertson, in trademark style, raced from one end to the other with the ball. He passed to John McGinn, who slipped the ball inside to McTominay and he fired a shot at Yann Sommer only for Schar to get in the way, deflecting it into the goal. The goal was initially ruled as an own-goal, despite it looking set to be on target even if Sommer would have saved it. Eventually UEFA went back on that decision, awarding it to McTominay.
But that lead lasted about 13 minutes before Shaqiri popped up with a rocket of a goal - something he does at seemingly every international tournament that exists. The 32-year-old has had an underwhelming season for Chicago Fire in the MLS but provided a timely reminder of the quality he still possesses. Head coach Murat Yakin still has some work to do in how he can fully fit the talisman in with the likes of Breel Embolo and KKwadwo Duah, but his quality is obvious.
Shaqiri's goal emerged after some poor play at the back from the Scots - something that defined their first half in which they conceded what felt like an obscene number of corners due to slack passes.
Scotland managed to keep the score level in the first half however, despite the Swiss compounding the pressure and threatening with that growing number of corners. Scotland tightened it up even further coming into the second after being put under pressure for the closing act of the first half.
The second 45 minutes was intense and, at times, crazy. With each passing minute and near-miss upping that craziness even more. Scotland came close numerous times while Switzerland's Embolo had the winning goal disallowed for offside.
But it was half with a moment of devastation too, as key player Tierney was stretchered off after hurting his hamstring. The defender attempted to stop Embolo's disallowed goal and hurt himself in the process, grabbing his hamstring as Embolo muscled him to the ground.
It's not only incredibly unlucky for Scotland, who need all the help they can get to secure qualification, but immensely unlucky for a player who has faced many injuries in his young career. Scott McKenna was decent value in his stead but he has huge shoes to fill when Scotland take on Hungary in Stuttgart.
TALKING POINT - GILMOUR THE DIFFERENCE
Why was Billy Gilmour left out against Germany? Why?
The 23-year-old made a huge difference to Scotland here. Alongside Callum McGregor in the centre of the park, the pair ensured Scotland could build and retain possession when they needed to.
Sure, the side are still lacking in a number of areas, but when Gilmour gets his feet on the ball there's an air of calmness that this Scotland side had none of in Munich five days ago.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - MANUEL AKANJI (SWITZERLAND)
The Manchester City and Swiss defender was imperious tonight, blocking McTominay in the 89th minute from executing a tap-in and surely the winner.
His 49 successful passes were more than anyone else on the pitch while he also managed five clearances, three recoveries and one block. Scotland made it hard work, but the 28-year-old relished it and performed admirably to give his side a point and a step closer to the next round.
PLAYER RATINGS
Scotland: Gunn 8, Ralston 5, Hendry 6, Hanley 7, Tierney 6, Robertson 7, McGregor 6, Gilmour 7, McGinn 7, McTominay 7, Adam 6. Subs: McKenna 6, McLean 6, Shankland N/A, Christie N/A.
Switzerland: Sommer 6, Rodriguez 7, Akanji 7, Schar 5, Aebischer 6, Xhaka 6, Freuler 6, Widmer 6, Vargas 6, Ndoye 6, Shaqiri 7. Subs: Embolo 6, Rieder 6, Sierro 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
13’ - GOAL! SCOTLAND 1-0 SWITZERLAND - Scotland fans are going wild! An incisive counter-attack from Scotland from a Swiss corner sees Robertson make a tremendous run. The ball is worked to McTominay on the edge of the box and his shot takes a deflection, but it's a goal for the United man nonetheless!
26’ - GOAL! SCOTLAND 1-1 SWITZERLAND - Of course it was Xherdan Shaqiri! Even more poor play at the back and a slack pass gifts the ball to Shaqiri, who fires an insane shot into the top corner. Gunn had no chance. A beautiful curling left-footed shot.
60’ - TIERNEY STRETCHERED OFF - Ndoye takes the ball from the air and beautifully spins past Kieran Tierney. He somehow shoots wide. But Tierney clutched his hamstring during that and on comes the stretcher. It doesn't look good for him. Poor guy cannot catch a break.
83' - GOAL DISALLOWED! - Breel Embolo is caught offside after breaking in behind and dinking over Gunn. It's disallowed but what a smooth finish it was.
89' - AKANJI DENIES SCOTLAND - McTominay had a tap-in set up for him and Akanji denies him after Robertson's head to the back post.
