City officials have rebranded the Camellia Bowl, changing the name of the December bowl game to reflect the wishes of the game’s new sponsor.

The bowl’s new sponsor, Huntsville-based Integrated Solutions for Systems (IS4S), is an engineering firm that works with the U.S. military and was announced as the bowl’s new corporate sponsor at its kickoff luncheon in July.
