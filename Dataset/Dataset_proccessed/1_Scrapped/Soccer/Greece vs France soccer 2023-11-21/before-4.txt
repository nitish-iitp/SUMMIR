Gibraltar

The Gibraltarians completely failed to prove themselves in the current tournament. Not only did they not earn a single point, but they didn't even score a single goal against their opponents. This autumn, Julio Ribas' team lost to Malta (0:1), Greece (0:5) and Wales (0:4) on the road, after which they lost to Ireland (0:4) at home. Last Saturday, the Gibraltar national team set an anti-record for the European qualifying cycles, losing to France with a humiliating score (0:14).

Netherlands

The Netherlands national team is in second place in the Group B standings, 6 points behind the leader, and 3 points ahead of the nearest pursuer. In the last six rounds, the Dutch have made only one setback, losing at home to France (1:2). It happened between away wins over Ireland (2-1) and Greece (1-0). At the current training camp, Ronald Koeman's team beat Ireland minimally at home (1-0).

Statistics and figures
Gibraltar has a 9-match losing streak without scoring a single goal in them;
In the last four matches Gibraltar has conceded at least 4 goals;
Gibraltar has a 3-match losing streak at home;
The Netherlands has won 4 matches out of the last five, losing only once;
In the last five matches of the Netherlands, the "Total less than 3.5 goals" bet was held;
The Netherlands have won 5 of their last six away matches, losing only once.
Forecast

In the first round match, the Netherlands beat Gibraltar at home modestly enough – with a score of 3:0. The Orange will probably want to finish the tournament brighter, especially on the handicap of the French victory over their rivals with a score of 14:0.
