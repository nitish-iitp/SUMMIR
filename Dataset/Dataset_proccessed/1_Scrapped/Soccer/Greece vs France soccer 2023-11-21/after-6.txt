The PSG star failed to make an impact, but Arsenal's main man was as effective as ever at the back

Kylian Mbappe was given 30 minutes to turn things around for France, but couldn't change the game in a timid cameo, as Les Bleus were forced to settle for a draw against an expansive Greece side. Didier Deschamps' men took the lead, but swiftly surrendered it in the second half, and didn't deserve more than a 2-2 draw despite William Saliba's solid efforts at the back.

Antoine Griezmann came close after 33 minutes, scuffing an effort off the post with the goal gaping. Kolo Muani made no such mistake when afforded a chance right before the break, latching onto Griezmann's through ball and lashing a shot into the roof of the net from a tight angle.

Greece bagged an unlikely equaliser after 55 minutes. Tasos Bakasetas provided it, catching a volley from outside the box that proved unstoppable for reserve goalie Brice Samba. They snatched a second shortly after, Fotis Ioannidis completing a sweeping team move with a tidy finish. But France had a response, with Monaco's Youssouf Fofana lashing in a long-range effort to level the game.

Les Bleus were handed one last chance to win it late on, but Kingsley Coman's spinning dink across the box flicked off the post and somehow avoided a number of swinging legs to seal an ultimately-fair point for either side.

GOAL rates France's players from the Agia Sofia Stadium...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Brice Samba (6/10):

Couldn't do anything about either goal. Won't ever have the No.1 shirt, but didn't exactly slip up.

Jules Kounde (5/10):

Skinned for the Greece second, and unconvincing going forward. Doesn't seem to fit in as a centre-back or right-back when his side plays with a back four.

William Saliba (8/10):

Some nice defensive work halted a few Greece counter-attacks. Probably deserves to be a starting centre-back for this side.

Lucas Hernandez (5/10):

A bit shaky for the most part. Moved the ball well, but was often outmuscled by Greece's physical attacking duo.

Theo Hernandez (6/10):

Direct on the left, and moved the ball well. Beaten in individual duals on a few occasions.

Midfield

Adrien Rabiot (5/10):

Did a lot of running around, and was on the ball consistently. But he didn't do much other than dump it off to Griezmann. A truly puzzling player.

Youssouf Fofana (7/10):

Did all of his defensive work well. Bashed an equaliser in with 20 minutes remaining. Far behind others in the pecking order, but a performance that suggested he could be in the squad come the summer.

Antoine Griezmann (6/10):

Played in his 84th straight international game. Missed a sitter in the first half and never really got out of second gear — even if he did orchestrate things well.

Attack

Ousmane Dembele (6/10):

Lots of pretty turns and sharp cuts. Made a few defenders look silly. Wasteful in crucial areas, though.

Olivier Giroud (5/10):

Assisted Kolo Muani's opener with a delightful flick. Didn't see much of the ball, otherwise.

Randal Kolo Muani (7/10):

Bagged his second goal for Les Bleus, and in emphatic style, too. Some of his runs were dangerous. Another showing to stake his claim for more playing time.

Subs & Manager

Kylian Mbappe (6/10):

As dangerous as expected around the 18-yard box. Missed a free header, wacked one off the bar. Not the hero this time.

Jonathan Clauss (6/10):

Didn't do much in a 30-minute showing.

Kingsley Coman (6/10):

Offered reliable service from the right wing after he came on.

Marcus Thuram (6/10):

A solid central presence, more mobile than Giroud.

Axel Disasi (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Didier Deschamps (5/10):

Selected an understandably weakened lineup, leaving out Mbappe while giving Samba and Saliba a chance to impress. His side performed well in the first half, but were outgunned after the break. Didn't deserve anything more than a point, which will be frustrating.
