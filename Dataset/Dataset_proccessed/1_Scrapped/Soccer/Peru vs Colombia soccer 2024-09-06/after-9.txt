Peru’s World Cup qualifying campaign is off to a dismal start, with just two points from their first six matches. The pressure is mounting as they look to turn things around. If Peru have any hopes of competing for a spot in the next World Cup, they must start collecting victories immediately to stay in the race.

Standing in their way are Colombia, the team that finished as runners-up in the Copa America, eager to move past their loss to Lionel Messi’s Argentina. Colombia enter this matchup as favorites, but they know that overconfidence could be costly in a must-win game for both sides.
