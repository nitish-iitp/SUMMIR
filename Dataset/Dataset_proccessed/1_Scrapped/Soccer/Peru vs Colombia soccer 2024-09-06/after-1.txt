The key player in Colombia

Luis Díaz is a Colombian soccer player born on January 13, 1997 in Barrancas, La Guajira. He plays as a winger and has been one of the main figures of the Colombian national team and international soccer in recent years. Diaz is known for his speed, dribbling ability and his ability to score goals in decisive moments. His great performance at Porto led him to be signed by Liverpool FC in January 2022. Since his arrival, Diaz has had an immediate impact on the English team, contributing with goals, assists and playmaking moves. He was instrumental in winning the FA Cup and Carabao Cup in 2022, and helped the team reach the UEFA Champions League final that same year.

The match will be played at the National Stadium of Peru

The National Stadium of Peru, popularly known as Estadio José Díaz, Estadio Nacional de Lima or simply Estadio Nacional, is a multipurpose stadium located in the Santa Beatriz neighborhood, in the district of Lima, capital of Peru.

According to ITSE certificate No. 701-2023, it has a capacity of 43,7812 (40,272 in its four grandstands and 359 in the box-suites). Many people, including sports reporters, call it “El Coloso de José Díaz”, due to the adjacent street named after that military man, who belonged to the Army of the Andes.

The National Stadium is the venue where the Peruvian National Soccer Team plays its home games. It also hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the Lima 2019 Pan American Games and the opening ceremony of the Lima 2019 Parapan American Games.
