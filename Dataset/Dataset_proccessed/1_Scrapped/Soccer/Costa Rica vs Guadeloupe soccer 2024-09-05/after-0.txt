Costa Rica face Guadeloupe on Thursday

Costa Rica and Guadeloupe will battle for three points in a CONCACAF Nations League clash on Thursday. The hosts have not been in action since claiming a 2-1 victory over Paraguay in the 2024 Copa America in July 2024.

Francisco Calvo and Josimar Alcocer scored to put them two goals ahead by the seventh minute while Ramon Sosa pulled one back for Los Ticos 10 minutes into the second half. However, the victory was not enough to see the Costa Ricans advance from the group as they could only finish third with four points.

Guadeloupe, meanwhile, have not been in action since claiming a 5-0 home win over Saint Kitts and Nevis in the Nations League in November 2023. Matthias Phaeton, Killian Bevis and Jerome Roussillon scored a goal each while Tairyk Arconte scored a brace in the rout. The victory saw Les Gwada Boys gain promotion to League A with 15 points from six games.
