Belgium commence their final preparations for Euro 2024 with an international friendly against Montenegro on Wednesday evening.

While the Red Devils have a major tournament to look forward to, the visitors to Brussels are preparing for the next edition of the UEFA Nations League.

Over the past decade, Belgium have started major tournaments as one of the fancied teams to challenge for the trophy due to the presence of an array of star names.

However, with no Thibaut Courtois in the squad and the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku now over 30 years of age, some bookmakers have Belgium as the eighth favourites to prevail in Germany.

That will suit Domenico Tedesco, but the betting odds are misleading with Belgium yet to lose under the Italian's watch, with eight wins and four draws coming from 12 matches.

Although Belgium have been a class above many of those teams, that run includes a win in Germany in March 2023 and a 2-2 draw with England in their most recent outing.

With another home friendly with Luxembourg to follow, Tedesco will expect that undefeated run to be extended to 14 games ahead of facing Slovakia in their Euro 2024 opener on June 17.

As for Montenegro, they have recently started a new era under Robert Prosinecki, who was appointed as their latest coach in February.

The former Croatia star got off to a perfect start during the March internationals, overcoming Belarus and North Macedonia by 2-0 and 1-0 scorelines respectively.

Montenegro had been in solid form under his predecessor, with the Brave Falcons recording five victories from their last eight outings, only losing away in Serbia and Hungary.

A match with Georgia follows later this week before Montenegro meet Turkey, Wales and Iceland in the UEFA Nations League.

These two nations have only squared off on one occasion, with a 2-2 draw played out all the way back on May 25, 2012 when a young Eden Hazard was among the scorers for Belgium.

De Bruyne looks likely to start for Belgium in what will be his 100th game for his country, with the Manchester City playmaker potentially replacing Orel Mangala or Amadou Onana.

Depending on the fitness of the squad after a long season, that may prove to be the only change, with fringe members more likely to start against Luxembourg.

Axel Witsel has made his return from the international wilderness and should feature at some point of the game at the King Baudouin Stadium.

Montenegro will make at least three changes from the team that started against North Macedonia with Stefan Savic, Risto Radunovic and Stefan Loncar all absent from the squad.

Meldin Dreskovic and Andrija Vukcevic appear likely to come into the backline, while Marko Jankovic is in line to start in central midfield.

Stevan Jovetic is expected to captain the side despite featuring for Olympiacos in last week's Europa Conference League final.


Belgium possible starting lineup:
Sels; Castagne, Debast, Vertonghen, Theate; Onana, Tielemans; Trossard, De Bruyne, Doku; Lukaku

Montenegro possible starting lineup:
Sarkic; Vukcevic, Vujacic, Dreskovic, Vukcevic; Jankovic, Bakic; Jovovic, Jovetic, Camaj; Mugosa



We say: Belgium 3-0 Montenegro

Montenegro will be motivated to cause a surprise in Brussels with no pressure on their shoulders. Nevertheless, this Belgium squad have a point to prove over the coming weeks and will want to make a major statement in the games ahead of the competition in Germany.
