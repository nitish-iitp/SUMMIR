The Bahamas picked up its first victory in CONCACAF Nations League play in 2024, turning back the US Virgin Islands (USVI), 3-1, at the Wildey Turf inside the Sir Garfield Sobers Sports Complex in Wildey, Barbados, on Saturday.

Brandon Adderley was the player of the match for The Bahamas, scoring two of the three goals. Left wing Adderley struck first in the 13th minute of the game on an assist from Peter Julmis. The Bahamas took a 2-0 lead when Adderley found the back of the net again, this time in the 23rd minute of the game on an assist Jordan Cheetham.

The Bahamas’ Senior Men’s National Soccer Team, known as the Junkanoo Boyz, continued to pile it on as right winger Omari Bain got in on the action. Bain gave The Bahamas a 3-0 lead when he scored in the 30th minute of the game on an assist from Quinton Carey.

The Bahamas went into the break up 3-0.

The Bahamas didn’t score again, but played substantial defense throughout. The US Virgin Islands completed the scoring with a goal from Hasani Edgar in the 69th minute of the game.

The Bahamas now has a 1-1-1 win/loss/draw record in CONCACAF Nations League, League C, Group A action for 2024-2025. Just the winning team in the group is confirmed of a promotion to League B for the 2025 CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football) Nations League.

Now, it’s on to Barbados for The Bahamas. The two nations will play each other tonight with The Bahamas looking to bounce back from a 3-2 setback in September. At 3-0, Barbados has already clinched the best record in the group.

The games in this window are home games for The Bahamas, but due to ongoing renovations at the Thomas A. Robinson National Stadium, they are being played in Barbados.

In September, The Bahamas got 2024 CONCACAF Nations League competition underway with a 3-3 tie with the US Virgin Islands and a 3-2 loss to Barbados.

The head coach for The Bahamas’ 18-member team is Nesly Jean, and he is being assisted by Kevin Davies.
