Prediction: 3-1

	

Hungary

Germany take on Hungary at Merkur Spiel-Arena in the opening match of their UEFA Nations League campaign. The Germans failed to impress at the EURO 2024 finals, but they did well to beat Hungary in their opener. Julian Nagelsmann’s men are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but they will have to prove their worth on the field. Both Manuel Neuer and Toni Kroos have retired from the Germany national football team, while goalkeepers Oliver Baumann and Alexander Nubel, and midfielder Angelo Stiller have received their first call-ups.

Arsenal ace Kai Havertz is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts. The visitors, on the other hand, were beaten by Switzerland and Germany at the European Championship, while beating Scotland in their last group game. A man to watch in the away team will be Liverpool ace Dominik Szoboszlai, who has netted 12 goals in 45 appearances for the Hungary national team.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (LEROY SANE):

Leroy Sane began his senior career at Schalke 04. The pacey winger, who is capable of playing as attacking midfielder as well, made his debut for die Knappen on 20 April, 2014 against Stuttgart. Sane came as a substitute in the second half of the match, replacing Max Mayer 13 minutes before the final whistle.

He scored 11 goals in 47 league appearances for Schalke and on 2 August, 2016 he signed a deal with big-spending Premier League side Manchester City. The former Schalke footballer joined the Citizens on a five-year deal for a fee of £37 million. Sane was born in Essen on 11 January, 1996, but his father is Senegalese.

Souleymane Sane used to play for the Senegalese national football team in the past, while his mother Regina Weber was a rhythmic gymnast. Speaking of his international career, Leroy Sane has 6 caps for Germany U21 and he made his debut for the senior team on 13 November, 2015 in a 2-0 loss to France.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (HUNGARY):

Widely known as the Mighty Magyars during the 1950’s, Hungary national team had the world at its feet as the team featuring Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis and Zoltan Czibor reached the final of the 1954 World Cup, while recording several impressive wins over England and other top sides in international friendlies.

Hungary also made it to the semi-final at the Euro 1964 and Euro 1972, but they have since largely struggled to return to old glory days. The barren run finally came to an end as Foci defeated Norway in the play-off to qualify for the Euro 2016 finals, but there still appears to be a huge gap behind the top European sides.

Long-serving goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly has managed to break a 58-year record held by Jozsef Bozsik, having surpassed the 101-cap mark, but Ferenc Puskas still remains the top goalscorer in the history of the national team with an unbelievable record of 84 goals in 85 caps, followed by Sandor Kocsis, who has 75 goals in 68 appearances.
