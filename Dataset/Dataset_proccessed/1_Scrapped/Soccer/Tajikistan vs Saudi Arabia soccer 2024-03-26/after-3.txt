Tajikistan vs Saudi Arabia Prediction

Tajikistan (ranked 99th) made history by qualifying for the Asian Cup for the first time and made it all the way to the quarterfinals in January.

The Crown have continued their upward trajectory and held their own in a narrow defeat in the reverse fixture, contrary to pre-game expectations. Gela Shekiladze's largely held their own for most of the game and were the better side for large swathes.

Saudi Arabia (ranked 53rd) had a disappointing Asian Cup campaign. Roberto Mancini's side have turned their focus to the FIFA World Cup qualifiers and have made light work of the group so far.

They have won all three games, scoring seven goals without conceding. A win will guarantee them progression to the next round, and they will be expected to claim maximum points.

Tajikistan's recent games have tended to be close-knit affairs, and that could be the case here. Saudi Arabia's games have also been cagey and their defensive solidity could come to the fore. Expect the visitors to claim all three points with a narrow victory while also keeping a clean sheet.

Prediction: Tajikistan 0-1 Saudi Arabia
