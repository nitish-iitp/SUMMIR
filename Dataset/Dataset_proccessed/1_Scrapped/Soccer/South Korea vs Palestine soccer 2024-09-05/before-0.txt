Australia and Bahrain commence the third round of Asian World Cup qualifying when they square off on the Gold Coast on Thursday.

While the home side came through their previous group with a 100% record, the visitors had to make do with a runners-up spot.

Having lost out in the Asian Cup quarter-finals at the start of the year, there was renewed motivation within the Australia ranks to get back on track in their World Cup qualifiers.

Two victories had already been recorded before they made light work of their remaining four games, scoring a further 14 goals and keeping four more clean sheets.

Although context is required with Lebanon, Bangladesh and Palestine the opposition, Graham Arnold will be encouraged by the run of shutouts.

Australia are now on a run of just one defeat in 13 games, that loss to South Korea in the Asian Cup also coming in extra time.

While the level of opposition will step up in the third phase of World Cup qualifying, confidence is high in the camp ahead of attempting to make a positive start.

From the perspective of Bahrain, they will be delighted to have built on their encouraging Asian Cup by reaching this round of the qualification process.

Dragan Talajic's side defeated eventual finalists Jordan in that competition before losing to Japan in the last 16, and that run has been backed up with a four-game unbeaten run.

After routine victories over Nepal, a goalless draw with Yemen secured a top-two spot before they posted a 1-1 stalemate against group winners United Arab Emirates.

Given the Asian powerhouses, including Japan and Saudi Arabia, in their group, further progression is unlikely, yet Talajic will be eager to see how his squad can cope in games of this magnitude.

Team News

Having had the leeway to tinker with his Australia XI of late, Arnold's starting lineup is somewhat of an unknown.

Star names such as Mathew Ryan, Harry Souttar and Jackson Irvine should all take their spots in the side, with Adam Taggart in line to lead the attack.

With Nathaniel Atkinson not part of the squad, Lewis Miller could get the nod at right-back.

Barring any injury issues, Talajic may be prepared to select the Bahrain side that started the draw in the UAE.

Despite conceding a 10th-minute leveller, Bahrain were able to hold out for a share of the spoils, their goal coming from Mahdi Abduljabbar who netted his 10th strike for his country.


Australia possible starting lineup:
Ryan; Miller, Souttar, Burgess, Rowles; Metcalfe, Baccus, Irvine; Yengi, Taggart, Goodwin

Bahrain possible starting lineup:
Lutfalla; Saeed, Al-Hayyam, Baqer, Adel; Al-Aswad, Haram, Marhoon, Al-Shaikh; Madan, Abduljabbar



We say: Australia 3-1 Bahrain

Although we expect Bahrain to pose Australia far more of a challenge than the Socceroos faced in the previous round, the home side should still have far too much quality on the Gold Coast. If Bahrain do get on the scoresheet, it could be a mere consolation at the back end of the game.
