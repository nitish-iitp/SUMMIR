Uruguay looked to be offside after review, but the call stood.

Knockout Bracket

Here's a look at the latest knockout bracket. By virtue of finishing first, Uruguay will play the second-place finisher in Group D. Panama will play the Group D winner.

Given Panama's 3-1 win over Bolivia, the United States would have needed to beat Uruguay to advance through to the knockout stage.

The Uruguay match proved to be the stiff test it appeared on paper. Obviously, falling behind 1-0 on a goal that appeared to be offside hurt, but the United States couldn't get much going on the attack with just three shots on goal all evening.

Both teams also suffered injuries. Sadly, Uruguay's Maximiliano Araújo was stretchered off with his neck in a brace after a collision while going up for a header. Uruguay confirmed that he suffered a head injury but would be fine.

A hobbled Folarin Balogun also was subbed off for Ricardo Pepi in the 40th minute for the U.S.

It was a disappointing result, but the U.S. could have been in a better shape with a tie versus Panama. The team's tournament ultimately comes down to that performance, a 2-1 loss that put the United States in a brutal spot going into the match against Uruguay, a pre-tournament favorite.

Tim Weah was sent off with a red card in the 18th minute against Panama, putting the United States down to 10 men early. The U.S. scored a goal four minutes later but quickly conceded one back before allowing a dagger in the 83rd minute.

And now the USMNT has now been eliminated in the group stage of a senior men's tournament it hosted for the first time in team history.
