Six teams to contest Qualifiers Playoff for Saudi Arabia 2027

https://www.the-afc.com/en/national/afc ... _2027.html

Kuala Lumpur: Three prized slots in the AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ Qualifiers Final Round are on offer via Playoffs with the official draw on May 9, 2024, set to chart the path forward for six teams.

Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Macau, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste will be paired in a matchup of the six lowest-ranked losing teams from the FIFA World Cup 2026 – Preliminary Competition and the AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ Preliminary Joint Qualification Round 1 with home and away encounters scheduled for September 5 (first leg) and September 10 (second leg).

The winning trio will join Bhutan, Maldives and Laos, who punched their tickets to the Qualifiers Final Round as the three best-ranked losing teams from the Preliminary Joint Qualification Round 1, alongside 18 teams (all third and fourth-placed teams from across nine groups) from Round 2.

In line with the AFC Competitions Committee’s decision, the seedings for the draw will be based on the latest FIFA Ranking available prior to the draw, which happens to be the one released on April 4, 2024. The six teams will be seeded into two pots of three teams each, as below:

Pot 1: Cambodia (ranked 179th), Macau (186th), Mongolia (191st)
Pot 2: Brunei Darussalam (194th), Timor-Leste (198th), Sri Lanka (204th)

Teams from Pot 2 will be drawn first and placed as the home team for the first leg, with teams from Pot 1 to host the second leg.

The Qualifiers Final Round will be contested over six match days, starting March 25, 2025 and culminating on March 31 2026, in a home-and-away format between six groups of four teams each. The winner of each group (six teams) will advance to the AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ Finals, joining the 18 (top two teams from across nine groups) that qualified from the Preliminary Joint Qualification Round 2.

Watch the Qualifiers Playoff Draw ceremony on Thursday, May 9, 2024 at 3pm (GMT+8) here!

Probably the FAs not entering to save money. For these two teams travel is very costly.

Westwood takes charge of Hong Kong, China
WED, 28 AUGUST, 2024

Hong Kong: Hong Kong, China have appointed former Afghanistan coach Ashley Westwood to replace Jorn Andersen as the representative team’s new head coach.

Westwood takes over after Andersen left in June to coach China League One side Yunan Yukun having qualified Hong Kong, China for the finals of the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023, the first time the association had qualified for the championship since 1968.

The 47-year-old former defender previously worked in club football in India and Malaysia before taking over as Afghanistan coach in November 2023 and has signed a two-year contract.

“I think first and foremost we'll set a good culture and we will make sure the environment that we bring them into is one that they'll want to play, they'll want to come and learn, they'll want to come and improve,” Westwood said.

“I don't have any reservations about the quality in Hong Kong. I've played here before with my Indian sides, I've seen their standard. I think there's good players here."

Westwood started his playing career in Manchester United’s academy before appearing for Crewe Alexandra, Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday.

He moved into coaching in 2012 when he was appointed Kettering Town’s player-manager and took over as Bengaluru FC head coach in 2013. Westwood then worked at the Penang FA, ATK and RoundGlass Punjab before working with Afghanistan.

His first task with his new employers will see him lead Hong Kong, China into a friendly match against Lichtenstein on October 10. Interim coach Wolfgang Luisser will take charge of the team during a tri-nations friendly tournament in Fiji next month.

Saintfiet leaves the Philippines
FRI, 30 AUGUST, 2024

Manila: Tom Saintfiet has resigned as head coach of the men’s national team, the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) has announced.

Saintfiet, who replaced former head coach Michael Weiss in February, is returning to Africa to lead the Mali national team.
The departure comes days before the Philippines are set to compete in the Merdeka Cup 2024 where they will face hosts Malaysia on September 4.

“From my first meeting with Tom, this is something we had discussed — that if a bigger opportunity came to him, I wouldn’t stand in his way. Tom came into the Philippine job with every intention of helping with our project, but his heart has always been in Africa. We thank him for his service and wish him well in his new role,” said PFF National Teams Director Freddy Gonzalez in a statement via X.

Under Saintfiet's stewardship, the Philippines finished the Preliminary Joint Qualification – Round 2 for the FIFA World Cup 2026 and AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ with a point from six matches.

Before taking the reins in the Philippines, Saintfiet led the Gambian national team from 2018 to 2024, steering them to a quarter-final appearance at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.

Preview - Qualifiers Playoff (1st leg)
WED, 04 SEPTEMBER, 2024

Kuala Lumpur: Six nations will battle it out in the playoffs to reach the AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ Qualifiers Final Round with the first leg matches set to take place on Thursday.

The-AFC.com previews the three ties involving Timor-Leste, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Brunei Darussalam and Macau who are all looking to seize one final opportunity to be part of Saudi Arabia 2027.

Timor-Leste v Mongolia

Timor-Leste's Simon Elissetche and Mongolia's Bayasgalan Garidmagnai will both be aiming for their respective sides to take a significant advantage away from the first leg to be played at the Kapten I Wayan Stadium in Bali.

Elissetche will look to PSM Makassar player Joao Pedro Freitas for inspiration in attack while Garidmagnai can count on Slovakia-based Ganbold Ganbayar to do the same.


The last time these two sides faced off was in the first round of the AFC Preliminary Joint Qualification World Cup 2018 and AFC Asian Cup™ 2019 First Round in March 2015.

Timor-Leste v Mongolia
Venue: Kapten I Wayan Stadium (Bali)
Kick-off: 15:30 (UTC+8)

Sri Lanka v Cambodia

Abdulla Almutairi only had slightly more than a week to work with his players, having been appointed as interim head coach by Sri Lanka.

However, the Kuwaiti national can rely on the experience of Brisbane Roar defender Jack Hingert in the heart of Sri Lanka’s defence.


Almutairi's counterpart Felix Dalmas has added 17-year-old Lim Lucca in the squad, the only player who plays his club football outside of Cambodia with Yudai Ogawa and Mizuno Hikaru also among the new faces in the team.

Sri Lanka v Cambodia
Venue: Racecourse International Stadium (Colombo)
Kick-off: 15:45 (UTC+5:30)

Brunei Darussalam v Macau

History favours Macau in this clash against Brunei Darussalam as they have won all four of their previous meetings, with Lazaro Oliveira determined to continue that good run for the East Asian side.

The 57-year-old head coach geared up his side by taking on Hong Kong Rangers in a closed-door friendly match on August 25.


Brunei Darussalam will want to maximise playing in front of their home crowd and with the Brunei Super League having kicked off last week, will have players who are match fit and ready for the challenge.

Brunei Darussalam v Macau
Venue: Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium (Bandar Seri Begawan)
Kick-off: 21:00 (UTC+8)
