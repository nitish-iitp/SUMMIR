Mongolia have lost all three games against Timor-Leste

Mongolia host Timor-Leste at the MFF Football Centre in Ulaanbaatar on Monday for the second leg of their clash in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying playoff round. The Blue Wolves are left with an uphill battle following a crushing 4-1 defeat in the first leg earlier this week. Joao Pedro powered a sensational hat-trick for the Rising Sun, coupled with another goal from Zenivio.

Oyunbaatar Mijiddorj had pulled one back for the Mongols in the first half, but it was completely eclipsed amid their rivals' frightening attacking display. Now, Bayasgalangiin Garidmagnai's side are on the brink of an elimination, unless they miraculously pull off a three-goal win at home.

However, their form so far this year doesn't hold them in good stead. Mongolia have lost four of their five games this year, with the slender 2-1 friendly win over Cambodia being their only positive result of the calendar year.

Meanwhile, Timor-Leste, ranked 196th in the world, picked up a memorable win, and have one leg in the next round of the Asian Cup qualifiers. A draw here is enough to seal their progression.

Coming into the fixture, the side hadn't played an official match since October last year, but the lack of game time didn't stop them from putting up a dazzling display in the first leg.

Mongolia vs Timor-Leste Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
Timor-Leste have a 100% win record against their rivals from East Asia, beating them in all three of their clashes so far.
The Rising Sun have scored nine goals against the Blue Wolves in three games, conceding just twice.
The Mongolians have lost four of their five games this year, with the 2-1 win over Cambodia being their only positive result so far.
They have also conceded 11 goals in five official games, scoring only thrice.
Timor-Leste are ranked 196th in the world, while their playoff rivals are just seven places above them, according to the latest FIFA Ranking.
Mongolia vs Timor-Leste Prediction

The Blue Wolves need a big performance here to keep their progression hopes alive, but they do not seem up to the task right now. We expect them to fare better than the first leg, but Timor-Leste will still advance on aggregate.

Prediction: Mongolia 1-1 Timor-Leste
