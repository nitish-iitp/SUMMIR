The case of the Brazilians in East Timor

In 2015, East Timor was involved in a controversy. It was the Asian qualifiers for Russia 2018, and East Timor and Palestine faced each other. The game had ended 1-1, and the next day, the Palestinian leaders sent a complaint to FIFA accusing their rival of playing with Brazilian players whose documents had been altered. Initially there was talk of nine players, but in the end the number rose to twelve. When the issue became known, the players themselves gave details of what had happened. They confessed that since they had no future in their country, they were offered to play in the local East Timorese league with salary and accommodation. In the end, the FIFA sanction was that they were disqualified from the Russia 2018 qualifiers, had to pay a fine of 70,000 Swiss francs and the AFC disqualified them from the next editions of the Asian Cup.ﾂ
