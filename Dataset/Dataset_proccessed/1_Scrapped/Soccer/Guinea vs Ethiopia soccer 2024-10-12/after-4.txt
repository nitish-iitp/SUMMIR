Guinea Results

Guinea’s recent form has been underwhelming, with a series of defeats in both the AFCON Qualifiers and World Cup matches. They have struggled to maintain momentum and control, conceding late goals and missing out on valuable points. Below are Guinea’s latest results:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
10.09.24	AFCON	Guinea vs Tanzania	1-2	L
06.09.24	AFCON	D.R. Congo vs Guinea	1-0	L
10.06.24	WC	Guinea vs Mozambique	0-1	L
06.06.24	WC	Algeria vs Guinea	1-2	W
25.03.24	Friendly	Guinea vs Bermuda	5-1	W

Guinea’s recent performance has been far from ideal, with three consecutive losses in competitive fixtures. Despite an encouraging victory against Algeria, they have struggled to capitalize on their chances and have conceded goals in critical moments. This poor form leaves them in desperate need of a turnaround in their AFCON campaign.

Ethiopia Results

Ethiopia has also had a tough time in their recent matches, particularly struggling in front of goal. Despite a goalless draw against Tanzania, their inability to score in key moments has been a recurring issue. Below are Ethiopia’s latest results:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
09.09.24	AFCON	Ethiopia vs D.R. Congo	0-2	L
04.09.24	AFCON	Tanzania vs Ethiopia	0-0	D
09.06.24	WC	Djibouti vs Ethiopia	1-1	D
06.06.24	WC	Guinea Bissau vs Ethiopia	0-0	D
24.03.24	Friendly	Ethiopia vs Lesotho	2-1	W

Ethiopia has managed only one victory in their last five matches. Their inability to score consistently has left them in a vulnerable position. With just one goal in their last five outings, Ethiopia will need to find solutions quickly if they hope to stay competitive in their AFCON qualifying campaign.

Guinea vs Ethiopia: Head-to-Head Results

Guinea and Ethiopia have faced each other multiple times in AFCON qualifiers, with Guinea dominating the encounters. Below are the results of their recent head-to-head matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
27.03.23	AFCON	Ethiopia vs Guinea	2-3
24.03.23	AFCON	Guinea vs Ethiopia	2-0
04.09.11	AFCON	Guinea vs Ethiopia	1-0
05.09.10	AFCON	Ethiopia vs Guinea	1-4
02.03.76	AFCON	Guinea vs Ethiopia	2-1

Guinea has maintained an excellent record against Ethiopia, winning all five of their previous encounters. This historical dominance may give Guinea a psychological edge going into the match, though they must remain cautious given their recent struggles.
