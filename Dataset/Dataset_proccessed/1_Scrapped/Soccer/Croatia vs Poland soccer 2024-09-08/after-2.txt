NEWS.08/09/2024

Modrić played a key role in Croatia's win over Poland at the Opus Arena in Osijek. The Real Madrid man capped off a great performance by scoring a fantastic free-kick in the 52nd minute to secure all three points for his side in the second matchday of the Nations League.

Following a first half in which Croatia dominated but were unable to break the deadlock, with Modrić driving his side forward, the Real Madrid captain was on hand to put his side ahead in the opening minutes of the second half. Modrić's brilliant direct free-kick sailed into the top corner of the net beyond the grasp of Poland goalkeeper Skorupski. Three important points for the Croatians in Group A1.
