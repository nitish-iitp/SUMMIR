Fam President Fleetwood Haiya made the promise after hosting the team to dinner at Douglas Hotel in Lilongwe on Sunday.

According to the Fam website, Haiya has promised to support the team as it has potential to qualify for the World Cup.

“He pledged K500,000 to each squad member as a token of appreciation for the achievements at Cosafa,’’ the website reports.

Fam is also expected to pay game bonuses to the players. The players already got travel allowances.

Beach Soccer Association President Gift Chimbalanga hailed Fam for its support to the game.

“We are happy that Fam is doing a lot to take the game to the next level. We need to invest more resources in the game,” Chimbalanga said.

The team won bronze after beating Saudi Arabia 5-4 at South Beach Arena.

Meanwhile, Malawi captain Isaac Kajamu has been included in the Cosafa Best Five Team.

Kajamu had a good tournament after finishing as a joint top goal scorer with Mozambique’s Antonio Jose Namape Jnr. They scored eight goals each.
