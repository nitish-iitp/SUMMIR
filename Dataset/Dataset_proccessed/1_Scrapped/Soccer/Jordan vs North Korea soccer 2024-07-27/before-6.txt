<image:caption>The 62-year-old voiceover actor said in the video posted by X user @DominoDeerGirl on Tuesday: 'SpongeBob's kind of on the spectrum too as a character. This last con that I did in McAllen, TX - it was the first time I'd ever been asked this question — a person who was obviously on the spectrum came up to me and said, "I have a question for you, Tom Kenny.
