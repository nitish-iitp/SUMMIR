Preview: Spain vs. Denmark - prediction, team news, lineups

UEFA Nations League holders Spain will endeavour to knock Denmark off the top of League A Group 4 when they do battle at Estadio Nueva Condomina on Saturday night.

While the Danes have picked up a maximum six points from their opening two games, La Roja sit two points further back in second place.

After being crowned European champions in the summer, courtesy of a 2-1 victory over England in the Euro 2024 final, Spain were held to a frustrating goalless stalemate by Serbia in their opening Nations League match last month.

However, La Roja returned to winning ways on matchday two as they put Switzerland to the sword 4-1 despite going down to 10 inside the opening 20 minutes. Fabian Ruiz scored twice either side of Robin Le Normand's dismissal, while Joselu and Ferran Torres were also on the scoresheet.

Luis de la Fuente's side have extended their unbeaten run across all competitions to 12 matches, including 10 wins and two draws, and have not lost since suffering a 1-0 friendly defeat to Colombia in March.

Spain have particularly impressing in front of goal, as they have scored at least two or more goals in nine games during this unbeaten streak, beating the likes of Germany, France and England along the way.

Ranked third in the world by FIFA, Spain will fancy their chances of success on Saturday, as they have won each of their last four meetings with Denmark by an aggregate score of 10-2.

Denmark failed to win a single game at Euro 2024, drawing all three group-stage fixtures and scraping through to the last 16 where they suffered a 2-0 defeat to host nation Germany.

The Danes' disappointing campaign resulted in the departure of manager Kasper Hjulmand, and caretaker boss Lars Knudsen has since made a bright start to his reign with the senior national team, winning his opening two Nations League matches against Switzerland and Serbia.

Denmark's 2-0 victory against a nine-man Switzerland outfit was followed three days later by success against Serbia by the same scoreline, with the Danes somewhat gaining revenge over the Serbs after being held to a frustrating 0-0 draw at Euro 2024.

Ranked 20th in the world by FIFA, Knudsen's side sit top of League A Group 4, and after finishing second in their previous two Nations League campaigns, they will be keen to consolidate their place at the summit this time around.

Success on Saturday could prove challenging for Denmark, though, as they have only won two of their previous 16 meetings with Spain across all competitions - their most recent triumph was back in March 1993 when they beat La Roja 1-0 in a World Cup qualifier.

Spain will be without a plethora of senior stars including key duo Rodri and Dani Carvajal, who are ruled out for several months with ACL injuries.

Le Normand - who would have been suspended for this match anyway - suffered a 'traumatic brain injury' while representing Atletico Madrid earlier this month and is also sidelined along with Ferran Torres, Dani Olmo, Gavi, Nico Williams and Bryan Gil.

Pedro Porro and Oscar Mingueza are set to battle for a start at right-back, while 17-year-old Pau Cubarsi could be handed just his second senior international start in central defence alongside Aymeric Laporte.

In the absence of Rodri, in-demand Real Sociedad star Martin Zubimendi will likely operate as Spain's midfield anchor in between Pedri and Fabian Ruiz, while Lamine Yamal and Alex Baena could support Alvaro Morata in attack.

As for Denmark, they will have to cope without Joachim Andersen, Mikkel Damsgaard, Christian Norgaard and Morten Frendrup due to injury, while uncapped Toulouse defender Rasmus Nicolaisen has also been forced to withdraw.

However, Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has returned to the senior squad after missing last month's international break through injury, and he is in contention to start up front, either alongside or instead of Yussuf Poulsen, who scored against Serbia last time out.

Christian Eriksen is set to earn his 137th international cap in midfield alongside Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Morten Hjulmand, while Jannik Vestergaard could be joined in a back three with Rasmus Kristensen and Victor Nelsson.


Spain possible starting lineup:
Raya; Porro, Cubarsi, Laporte, Cucurella; Pedri, Zubimendi, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata, Baena

Denmark possible starting lineup:
Schmeichel; Kristensen, Vestergaard, Nelsson; Bah, Hojbjerg, Hjulmand, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Poulsen, Hojlund




We say: Spain 3-1 Denmark

Denmark have made a positive start under caretaker boss Knudsen, but their mettle is sure to be tested away against a Spain outfit who still boast plenty of strength in depth, despite the absence of some key players through injury.

Indeed, La Roja will be regarded as favourites to come out on top in Saturday's contest and we expect the hosts to outscore their opponents en route to claiming the three points that they need to leapfrog the Danes to the top of the group.
