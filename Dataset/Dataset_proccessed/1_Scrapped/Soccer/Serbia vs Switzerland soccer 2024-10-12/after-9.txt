The Nations League A continues with an intriguing matchup between Serbia and Switzerland on Saturday, October 12, 2024, at 21:45 GMT+3. This fixture, set to take place at the Gradski stadion Dubočica, marks the third matchday of the competition and promises to be a closely contested affair. Both teams have had a challenging start to their Nations League campaigns, with Serbia managing to secure a single point from their opening two matches, while Switzerland is yet to get off the mark.

Serbia currently occupies the third position in the group, having drawn one and lost one of their matches so far. Their goal difference stands at 0:2, indicating a struggle to find the back of the net. On the other hand, Switzerland finds themselves at the bottom of the group, having suffered defeats in both of their opening fixtures. The Swiss have conceded six goals while only managing to score once, leaving them with a -5 goal difference.

The history between these two sides adds an extra layer of intrigue to this encounter. In their last direct meeting across all competitions, Switzerland emerged victorious with a 3:2 away win. However, there is no recent head-to-head data available specifically for Nations League A encounters between Serbia and Switzerland.

Our betting tip: Home win Serbia – Tip 1 or DC 1X

Our betting prediction for this match leans towards a home win for Serbia. Despite their slow start to the Nations League campaign, Serbia’s home advantage and slightly better form compared to Switzerland make them the favorites. The odds for a Serbia win stand at 2.67 with Betwinner, offering good value for punters.

An alternative tip is a double chance 1x (Serbia or draw) with an attractive odd of 1.46 at Paripesa. This bet offers the safer version for us!

Our second betting tip: Both teams will score

Given the recent defensive vulnerabilities of both teams, we predict that both Serbia and Switzerland will find the back of the net in this match. The odds for “Both Teams to Score: Yes” are 1.85 at Betwinner, presenting an attractive option for bettors.

Do not forget to inform about the bookmakers in detail! Here is our best betting sites overview.


Serbia: Seeking Redemption on Home Turf

Serbia enters this fixture with a point to prove after a disappointing start to their Nations League A campaign. Under the guidance of manager Dragan Stojković, the team has shown flashes of potential but has struggled to convert opportunities into goals. Their recent form across all competitions reads 0 wins, 3 draws, and 2 defeats in their last 5 matches, highlighting the need for improvement.

In their last outing, Serbia suffered a 2:0 away loss to Denmark in the Nations League, a result that will have undoubtedly stung the pride of Stojković’s men. This defeat came on the heels of a draw in their opening fixture, leaving Serbia with just one point from two matches and a goal difference of 0:2.

Stojković, known for his tactical flexibility, will likely be looking to shake things up for this crucial home fixture. The Serbian manager may opt for a more aggressive approach, aiming to capitalize on Switzerland’s defensive frailties while shoring up their own backline. With the backing of the home crowd at Gradski stadion Dubočica, Serbia will be eager to secure their first win of the campaign and climb up the league table.


Switzerland: In Search of a Turnaround

The Swiss national team, led by manager Murat Yakin, finds itself in a precarious position heading into this match. With two defeats from their opening two fixtures in Nations League A, Switzerland is in desperate need of a positive result to kickstart their campaign. Their recent form across all competitions shows 1 win, 1 draw, and 3 defeats in their last 5 matches, indicating a team struggling to find consistency.

Switzerland’s last outing in the Nations League ended in a disappointing 4:1 home loss to Spain, a result that laid bare the defensive issues plaguing the team. This defeat followed another loss in their opening fixture, leaving Switzerland pointless after two matches with a concerning goal difference of 1:6.

Yakin, known for his pragmatic approach, faces a significant challenge in turning Switzerland’s fortunes around. The manager may need to reconsider his tactical setup, possibly opting for a more defensive formation to stem the flow of goals conceded while looking to hit Serbia on the counter-attack. The Swiss will be aware that a positive result in this away fixture could be crucial in their bid to avoid relegation from Nations League A.




Last Direct Encounters

The head-to-head statistics for the last two encounters between Serbia and Switzerland show a clear advantage for the Swiss side. Switzerland has emerged victorious in both matches, with no wins for Serbia and no draws. The most recent encounter saw Switzerland secure a 3:2 away win, demonstrating their ability to perform on Serbian soil.


Recent Form

Looking at the last five fixtures for both teams:

Serbia: 0 wins, 3 draws, 2 defeats
Switzerland: 1 win, 1 draw, 3 defeats

These statistics suggest that both teams have been struggling for form recently, with Serbia showing slightly more resilience in avoiding defeats.


Latest Results

Serbia: 0:2 Away loss vs. Denmark
Switzerland: 1:4 Home loss vs. Spain

Both teams are coming into this fixture on the back of defeats, adding extra pressure to secure a positive result.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this Nations League A fixture between Serbia and Switzerland promises to be an intriguing contest. While both teams have struggled in their opening matches, Serbia’s home advantage and slightly better recent form give them the edge. The motivation to secure their first win of the campaign, combined with Switzerland’s defensive issues, makes a home victory the most likely outcome. To be on the safer side we suggest a double chance 1x. However, given the attacking capabilities of both sides, we expect goals at both ends, making “Both Teams to Score” an attractive betting option. As always, we encourage responsible betting and remind readers that odds are subject to change.
