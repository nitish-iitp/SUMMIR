Hezbollah leader pledges a 'weakened Israel'

Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah is close to wrapping up a long speech in Beirut that was scheduled before the senior Hamas figure Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike when he was at the Hamas offices in Beirut on Tuesday.

But he asserted that the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October, with militants bursting out of Gaza, has damaged Israel and the effects were not yet done.

“What has happened since 7 October and what will happen in the future has weakened Israel,” he said.

He is now warning that if Israel [further] attacks Lebanon the resistance from Hezbollah, the anti-Israeli militant group and political force based in Lebanon will know no limits.

Hezbollah and Hamas blame Israel for the killing of Arouri on Tuesday, while Israel has not formally declared responsibility.

Nasrallah accuses US of 'preventing the end of the war in Gaza'

Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah has addressed his remarks in an ongoing speech towards the Israeli military, declaring “God willing, you will not be able to achieve the goals of your war” against Hamas in Gaza and Hamas leaders more widely.

He also said “it is the Americans who are preventing the end of the war in Gaza” in its full-throated governmental support for Israel in its retaliation prompted by the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, including the snatching of hostages, many of whom are still being held in Gaza.

Israel has killed more than 22,000 people in Gaza, mostly Palestinian civilians, and wounded more than 60,000, according to the Hamas leaders who govern the besieged Gaza Strip.

Earlier Nasrallah called out passionately: “From the river to the sea the land of Palestine is for the Palestinians and the Palestinian people only.”

The phrase “from the river to the sea” is interpreted by many as an antisemitic and anti-Zionist calling for the destruction of the state of Israel, but by others as a simple plea for the liberation of the Palestinian people and the establishment of a universally recognised state of Palestine.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas fighters on 7 October “dealt a severe blow to normalisation efforts” that had been taking place between various Arab governments and Israel in recent years.

The latest country that had been moving closer to normalising relations with Israel prior to the Hamas attacks was a giant traditional enemy of the Jewish state, Saudi Arabia, under the auspices of the United States, now led by Joe Biden in a Democratic administration but accelerated by his Republican predecessor (and rival for the presidency again in 2024, Donald Trump).

Since 2020, in agreements brokered by Trump’s administration, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan have agreed to normalise relations despite the ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories.

In his speech that is still ongoing in Beirut, Nasrallah said that the Hamas attacks, which he referred to by the Islamist militant forces’ favoured name of Operation al-Aqsa Flood, was not just a strike against such normalisation but also had caused Israel’s deterrence capability to collapse.

The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is accusing Israel of holding “the real objective” in its attacks on Gaza of driving all the Palestinians out of the territory.

“The objective is quite clear,” the leader said in his speech being delivered in Beirut, according to the English interpreter of his speech.

Nasrallah pointed to the “people forced to leave their homes in Gaza and the West Bank, to some extent, and southern Lebanon”.

“We have seen the great dangers … but at the same time we have seen the resistance and the defiance … the refusal to surrender of Gaza,” he said.

Nasrallah accused Israel of “starving people and inflicting the largest war of genocide during this century” against the Palestinians in Gaza.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s speech in Beirut is on a lengthy passage focusing further on the late Iranian commander Qassem Suleimani, the fourth anniversary of whose assassination by US forces was marked by fatal explosions at a memorial event in central Iran earlier on Wednesday.

Nasrallah said Suleimani was a driving force in uniting various forces against Israel and western support for Israel in Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Yemen “and other countries”.

He said Suleimani led coordination and collaboration between elements of what Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli figures call the ”axis of resistance”.

Hezbollah blames ‘flagrant Israeli aggression’ for death of Hamas figure in Lebanon

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s speech in Beirut is under way and he has extended condolences to the family of the senior Hamas figure Saleh al-Arouri who was killed in a drone strike in Lebanon on Tuesday.

Nasrallah said he would come back to the topic of the assassination later in his speech.

Hezbollah and Hamas have blamed Israel for the killing of Arouri although the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has not officially declared responsibility for the strike on Arouri in Beirut or the explosions in Iran earlier on Wednesday.

He called the killing of Arouri “flagrant Israeli aggression on Beirut’s Dahiyeh”.

Dahiyeh is a predominantly Shia Muslim suburb to the south of central Beirut, where Hamas had an office.

Hezbollah supports Hamas and is backed by Iran in its aggressive existential opposition to Israel.

This blog is quoting Nasrallah in English as provided by an interpreter giving a live voiceover on Al Jazeera TV as the Hezbollah leader delivers his speech.

The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has begun a speech in Beirut. He has flagged that he will talk about the explosions in Iran earlier on Wednesday, the Israeli battle being waged in Gaza and Tuesday’s killing of a senior Hamas leader, who was in Beirut when he was hit with a drone strike.

First Nasrallah extended “our congratulations and condolences” for the “martyrdom” of Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s al-Quds force, who was killed four years ago. At a memorial event for that death earlier today, more than 100 people were killed in two explosions.

Hezbollah blamed Israel for the explosions in Iran and for the killing on Tuesday of Saleh al-Arouri, a senior Hamas leader, in Lebanon at the Hamas office in Beirut. Israel has not been confirmed as the perpetrator of either event.

Suleimani was killed in Baghdad by US forces in 2020. Hezbollah supports Hamas and is backed by Iran.

There are big demonstrations going on in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to protest the assassination of a senior Hamas leader, Saleh al-Arouri, on Tuesday.

Arouri was killed in Beirut by a drone strike widely attributed to Israel.

The event threatens a significant and dangerous escalation of Israel’s war against Hamas and its related conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

The Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is due to give a speech in Beirut right now, in which he is expected to address the fact that the strike occurred inside Lebanon.

Here are some images from Ramallah.

Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, has said more about the attacks in central Iran earlier on Wednesday at the memorial event for the US killing of Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s al-Quds force, four years ago.

After condemning “terrorism in all its forms” and sending condolences to Iran, Putin also said the attack, which has killed many members of the general public attending the event, was “shocking in its cruelty and cynicism”, Reuters reports.

No entity has yet declared responsibility for the explosions at the event. Russia and Iran are strategic allies.

The explosions occurred close to the tomb where Suleimani is buried, in the central Iranian city of Kerman.

Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has just condemned “terrorism in all its forms” and sent condolences to its ally Iran after the violent events there today.

Two explosions killed at least 103 people and injured scores more at a memorial ceremony in Iran marking the fourth anniversary of the US killing of Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s al-Quds force and one of the most powerful men in the Middle East.

Putin is speaking out after the attack that took place at the cemetery in the central Iranian city of Kerman, Reuters is reporting, citing the Russian domestic news agency RIA.

A senior official there has called the blasts a “terroristic” attack, without elaborating on who could be behind them. No one has immediately claimed responsibility for what appeared to be the deadliest attack to target Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.

We’ll bring you more of Putin’s statement shortly.
