I want to hold them captive, says Australian Mining CEO as he bans coffee breaks

Ellison's strict office policy contrasts sharply with the flexible work options common in Australia, where many companies allow remote work at least two days a week. He insists employees should be in the office full-time.

Billionaire Chris Ellison, CEO of Mineral Resources Ltd., has made headlines with his strong stance against remote work and his determination to keep employees on-site. Known for his no-nonsense approach, Ellison has already banned work-from-home arrangements at his mining company, and now, even the simple act of stepping out for a coffee could become a thing of the past.

"I want to hold them captive all day long," Ellison declared during a recent call with analysts following an earnings update. He emphasized that he doesn't want employees leaving the building, even for a quick coffee run, citing the costs associated with such breaks. "We kind of figured out a few years ago how much that costs," he added, underscoring his commitment to maximizing productivity.

Ellison's strict office policy stands in stark contrast to the flexible work arrangements that have become the norm in Australia, especially among white-collar workers. While many companies now offer the option to work remotely at least two days a week, Ellison remains firm in his belief that employees should be present in the office full-time.

"We can’t have people working three days a week and picking up five days a week pay," Ellison stated, expressing his frustration with the shift towards remote work. He even went as far as to wish that other companies would adopt a similar stance, saying, "I wish everyone else would get on board with that, the sooner the better."

To support his employees in maintaining a full-time office presence, Ellison has equipped the company's two-year-old Perth headquarters with a range of amenities designed to keep staff engaged and comfortable. The facility boasts a café, restaurant, gym, crèche, reflection room, and wellness center. According to Ellison, these perks have been well-received by employees, who "loved working" in the building and found its offerings to be sufficient to "keep them glued" there throughout the day.

One of the standout features of the headquarters is the on-site daycare center, which charges just A$20 ($13.58) per day—significantly lower than the external cost of around A$180 per day. Ellison sees this as a major benefit for working parents, stating, "Drop the little tykes off next door. We’re going to feed them, but mum and dad will be working in our office." This initiative reflects Ellison's desire to minimize distractions and ensure that parents can fully focus on their work without the need to leave the office.

Ellison's approach, however, is not without its critics. In a country where work-from-home flexibility has been embraced by many, his rigid policies may be viewed as out of touch with the evolving expectations of the modern workforce. Yet, for Ellison, the focus remains on productivity and keeping his team together in a controlled, distraction-free environment.

As remote work continues to gain traction globally, Ellison's stance serves as a reminder that not all business leaders are willing to adapt to this trend. Whether his hardline approach will pay off in the long run remains to be seen, but for now, employees at Mineral Resources Ltd. should prepare to spend their workdays entirely within the confines of the company's Perth headquarters.
