On May 17, 2024, I was honored to deliver the commencement speech to the 2024 Graduating Class of Gupton-Jones College of Funeral Service. Being asked by my alma mater to impart words of wisdom to its current graduates was a moment I will forever cherish. I wanted to share this speech with hope that it will relate to all mortuary science graduates: past, present, and future. I hope that it provides the words of encouragement you need to continue on the path that has been paved specifically for you. In the words of Alabama Funeral Directors Association Executive Director, Ken Hammock: Onward!

Good morning future funeral professionals. What a journey this has been! I am honored to stand before you today to celebrate the giant sigh of relief you are finally able to take and the excitement of knowing that this challenge did not defeat you. Give yourselves a round of applause because this was no easy feat, but you did it! Judging by the crowd in this room, I think it’s safe to say that I am not the only one who is so very proud of you for starting the next stage of your career. I do want to take a moment to thank the ones who showed up to support and celebrate the success of these graduates. Believe me, your support will always be remembered so thank you for bearing through the process and showing up. Thank you to the staff of Gupton-Jones for continuing to strive for excellence in the molding of our profession’s future and for giving me the opportunity to stand here today to impart words of wisdom.

Warmth, kindness, and compassion. These three words often come up in conversations about the work and life of Jennifer Lindell-Roys. Inspired by the TV show “Quincy” at the age of 8, she pursued her interest in anatomy and her passion for serving families to become a funeral director, serving the families of Dade and Polk counties, Florida, for over 38 years.
