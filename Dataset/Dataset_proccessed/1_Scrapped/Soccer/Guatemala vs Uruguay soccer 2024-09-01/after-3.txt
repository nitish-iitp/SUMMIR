The Opta Analyst FCS coverage includes the Stats Perform FCS Top 25 Poll, which is voted on by a national panel of 56 voters each Monday.

How teams in the Stats Perform FCS Top 25 Poll fared during Week 1 of the 2024 college football season:

1. South Dakota State (0-1, 0–0 MVFC): 44-20 loss at Oklahoma State

South Dakota State’s 44-20 loss at Oklahoma State marked the first FCS preseason No. 1-ranked team to drop its opener since North Dakota State fell at Montana in 2015.

In that time, one other preseason No. 1 opened against an FBS team (James Madison beat East Carolina in 2017).
