Sevilla vs. Girona - Game Highlights

Goals in each half by Ivan Martin and Abel Ruiz gave Girona a comfortable 2-0 win at Sevilla in a LaLiga clash on Sunday.

Last season's surprise package Girona dominated proceedings from early on against a tame Sevilla, who are winless in four games to start the season.

Girona dominated possession throughout the match but needed goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga to make a handful of critical saves to deny efforts by Sevilla.

Girona fullback Miguel Gutierrez was a menace running up and down the left channel and almost scored with a strike from long range that Sevilla goalkeeper Orjan Nyland palmed round the post in the 30th minute.

However, Gutierrez created the counter-attack that gave Girona the lead in the 41st minute, bursting up the left wing before crossing to the six-yard-box where Martin only had to tap in to the empty net.

Sevilla thought they had the equaliser two minutes later with a strike by Chidera Ejuke but the goal was ruled out for being offside.

Girona kept dominating after the break and Arnaut Danjuma wasted a great chance to extend their lead in the 50th minute, missing a close-range effort from a rebound.

It was forward Ruiz who secured the points in the 73rd minute from the penalty spot following a handball inside the box by Sevilla forward Isaac Romero.

Girona withstood the pressure as the locals desperately tried to make a late run, with boos greeting the final whistle in the scorching Andalusian heat.

Girona moved to fourth in the LaLiga standings on seven points, five behind leaders Barcelona who they face next. Sevilla are second from bottom on two points.
