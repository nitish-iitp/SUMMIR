WHAT HAPPENED?

After kick-off, Toni Kroos briefly moved backwards before lofting a pass towards Wirtz. The German attacker spotted a huge space in France's midfield and took a couple of touches before launching a long-range piledriver that went straight into the goal, via the crossover.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Kroos was playing in his first international match for the German national team since Euro 2020 in June 2021 on Saturday. After his country's early exit from the continental competition, the veteran midfielder announced his retirement from international football only to return recently.

Wirtz's goal on Saturday was only the second-fastest goal ever scored in international football, with the fastest being Austria's Christoph Baumgartner, who netted the opener within six seconds. Incredibly, both happened on the same day.

DID YOU KNOW?

Per Germany's men's official page, Wirtz's effort is the fastest goal in German international history.

WHAT NEXT FOR GERMANY?

Julian Nagelsmann's side will try and hold on to their first-half lead, which was added to by Kai Havertz in the second period, and clinch the tie against the 2018 world champions. They will next play Netherlands on March 26 in a second international friendly.
