Euro 2024 team preview: Can Slovakia be the ‘Dark Horses’ of Europe?
UEFA Euro 2024: With Slovakia providing a few exquisite performances in the Euro Qualifiers, all eyes will be on how Francesco Calzona manages to get past the group stage.

Slovakia has now earned a spot in three consecutive European Championship competitions. They advanced to the round of 16 at Euro 2016 but were eliminated in the Euro 2020 group stage.

The Falcons only qualified for the World Cup finals once, in 2010, when they made it to the round of 16. They were not present at the most recent World Cup in Qatar.

Despite the setbacks, the appointment of Francesco Calzona turned the ordeals in the Slovakia camp. The Italian coach has led the team to remarkable success since taking over in November 2022. They hope their solid core puts them in the running for the knockout phase after giving Portugal two close games during the qualifiers.

From being a coffee seller to making Slovakia qualify for the UEFA Euro 2024 by grinding results among heavy hitters like Portugal and Croatia, Francesco Calzona has been a revelation over the past few years. Even though they lost both matches to the football giants, they capitalised on getting results against teams of similar profiles.

Calzona had a meager playing career; in reality, he spent his formative years selling coffee and playing amateur football. Eventually, he joined the coaching staff of Maurizio Sarri at five different clubs, including Napoli, where he enjoyed his greatest success and where the seeds of his selection as Slovakia’s manager were planted.

He developed a great friendship with Marek Hamsik, the midfielder who made record-breaking appearances for Slovakia while he was captain of Napoli. Thus, in 2022, when the national team was searching for a new manager, Hamsik suggested his former mentor, who Luciano Spalletti then employed.

Let’s look at the players that Francesco Calzona has called up for the Euro 2024, taking place in Germany.

UEFA Euro 2024: Slovakia squad list

Goalkeepers: Martin Dúbravka (Newcastle), Marek Rodák (Fulham), Henrich Ravas (New England Revolution)

Defenders: Peter Pekarík (Hertha Berlin), Norbert Gyömbér (Salernitana), Denis Vavro (FC Copenhagen), Milan Škriniar (Paris Saint-Germain), Adam Obert (Cagliari), Dávid Hancko (Feyenoord), Vernon De Marco (Hatta Club), Sebastián Kóša (Spartak Trnava)

Midfielders: Matúš Bero (Bochum), Juraj Kucka (Slovan Bratislava), Tomáš Rigo (Baník Ostrava), Patrik Hrošovský (Genk), Stanislav Lobotka (Napoli), Ondrej Duda (Hellas Verona), László Bénes (Hamburg)

Strikers: Dávid Duriš (Ascoli), Tomáš Suslov (Hellas Verona), Ivan Schranz (Slavia Prague), Róbert Boženík (Boavista), David Strelec (Slovan Bratislava), Lubomír Tupta (Slovan Liberec), Leo Sauer (Feyenoord), Lukáš Haraslín (Sparta Prague).

Player to watch out for in the Slovak side: Stanislav Lobotka

Stanislav Lobotka will play a key role in Calzona’s 4-3-3 formation. The defensive midfielder was one of the few consistent performers in Napoli’s disappointing 2023/24 season.

The Slovak juggernaut averaged winning 63.9% tackles and 53.6% duels per 90 minutes in the 2023/24 season. Moreover, his prolific footwork has helped keep possession at crucial times at the Naples and the Euro Qualifiers for Slovakia. With a 6.45 recovery rate and a minimal 0.11 yellow cards rate per 90 minutes, Calzona’s tactics will highly depend on the discipline and work rate of the Slovak.

Lobotka featured in 49 matches across all competitions for Napoli in the 2023/24 season, providing one assist. Despite his low attacking lineage up-front, his tempo-controlling and defensive abilities can make the winning difference for the Slovak side.

Young shining star in the Slovak side: Tomas Suslov

Tomas Suslov has been a revelation for Calzona’s side throughout the Euro Qualifiers. With players like Juraj Kucka and Ondrej Duda being the veterans of the midfield, this 22-year-old speedster provides an energetic profile up-front for Slovakia.

Suslov can settle into multiple roles including, attacking midfield, central midfield, right-wing, striker, and left-wing, making him a crucial component of the squad. His versatility in playing multiple roles makes him the key player for Calzona’s chances against strong teams like Belgium and Ukraine in Group E. His 3.04 shot rate and 60% cross-accuracy per 90 minutes make him the main attacking threat up-front.

He has made nine goal contributions in 35 appearances for Serie A side, Hellas Verona. His prolific consistency helped Verona numerous times throughout the season, with Suslov being a key starter for the side.

Prediction: Can Calzona create an upset?

Group E features Belgium, Romania, and Ukraine. Slovakia does possess the ability to win against the inexperienced Romanians. With Lobotka-Kucka-Duda in the middle and Milan Skriniar at the back, Calzona can opt to use their defensive prowess to take the matches to the deep waters. Players like Suslov and Haraslin possess quick-counter traits that can be used to hurt their opponents at the very end of the matches.

However, they must be cautious of Belgium, and if they can secure a draw against de Bruyne’s team, Slovakia can expect to qualify for the Round of 16.
