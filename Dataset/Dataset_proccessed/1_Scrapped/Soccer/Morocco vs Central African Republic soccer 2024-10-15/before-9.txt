Preview: Central African Republic vs. Morocco - prediction, team news, lineups

Morocco will be looking to continue their perfect record in Group B of their Africa Cup of Nations 2025 qualifying campaign when they travel to face Central African Republic on Tuesday at Stade d'Honneur d'Oujdain.

The hosts are third with three points after three matches and lost 5-0 against Morocco on Saturday, while the visitors are first with nine points from three games and occupy the first of the four-team group's two qualifying spots.

Central African Republic started their qualifying campaign with a 3-1 win against Lesotho on September 5, a match in which they produced three big chances and conceded one themselves.

However, the hosts subsequently lost 2-0 against Gabon on September 10, before being beaten comprehensively against Morocco and even conceding four first-half goals in that match.

The loss means that Raoul Savoy's side have now conceded 12 goals and scored four times in their last four games, and they have now lost four of their last five qualifying matches.

Savoy's team have lost three of their four most recent fixtures, though they did win the prior three games by a cumulative score of 11-0.

Central African Republic boast a strong home record considering they have won their last four matches at Stade d'Honneur d'Oujdain and have won six of their last seven at home in all competitions.

The visitors come into the clash having beaten Gabon 4-1 in their first qualifying game of the campaign on September 6, as well as having defeated Lesotho 1-0 on September 9.

Morocco have an incredible qualification record given they have won 13, drawn four and lost just one of their last 18 AFCON qualifiers.

Manager Walid Regragui also has a strong record as head coach of the national team, with the Atlas Lions boss having won 19, drawn seven and lost seven of his 33 matches in charge.

Despite Regragui achieving largely positive results during his tenure, he has been criticised by some for struggling tactically against deep blocks.

Having said that, the Atlas Lions have won their five most recent games and scored 18 goals while only conceding twice in that time.

Morocco have also won their last four away games, keeping four clean sheets and scoring 10 goals in that period.

The home side may be unable to select centre-back Dylan Mboumbouni, who was forced off last time out as a result of injury, and he could be replaced by Sadock Ndobe.

Noah Kevin Ato-Zandanga was substituted on for left-back Severin Tatolna, who struggled against Morocco's forwards in his nation's first-half routing.

Central African Republic could name a front three consisting of Karl Namnganda, Louis Mafouta and Goduine Koyalipou.

Morocco are unlikely to make many changes from the team that won 5-0 against Tuesday's opponents, though goalkeeper Bono was substituted due to injury and Munir Mohamedi may be selected in his place.

Mohamedi could be shielded by centre-backs Nayef Aguerd and Jamal Harkass, while Azzedine Ounahi and Sofyan Amrabat seem certain to start in a double pivot.

Soufiane Rahimi, Eliesse Ben Seghir, Abdessamad Ezzalzouli and Ayoub El Kaabi found success against Savoy's side previously, and they will likely start once again.


Central African Republic possible starting lineup:
Youfeigane; Yangao, Yambere, Ndobe, Ato-Zandanga; Kondogbia, Pirioua, Solet; Namnganda, Mafouta, Koyalipou

Morocco possible starting lineup:
Mohamedi; Hakimi, Harkass, Aguerd, Belammari; Ounahi, Amrabat; Rahimi, Seghir, Ezzalzouli; El Kaabi



We say: Central African Republic 0-3 Morocco

It is difficult to see how Central African Republic can avoid defeat given the strong form of Morocco.

It would not be surprising if the hosts once again generated numerous chances and emerged as comfortable victors.
