The Moroccan national football team decisively defeated the Central African Republic 4-0 on Tuesday evening at the Honor Stadium in Oujda during the fourth round of the CAN 2025 qualifiers.

Already qualified for the final tournament as the host country, Morocco retained most of the players who excelled in their previous 5-0 victory.

Goals were scored by Eliesse Ben Seghir (35′, 38′), Youssef En-Nesyri (50′, penalty), and Abdessamad Ezzalzouli (66′).

Although Morocco struggled to find its rhythm at the start, maintaining 60% possession without any shots on target, the determination of players like Youssef En-Nesyri and Eliesse Ben Seghir quickly made an impact.

Ben Seghir opened the scoring in the 35th minute with a goal following a cross from Soufiane Rahimi, then doubled the lead shortly after. In the second half, En-Nesyri converted a penalty, followed by a fourth goal from Ezzalzouli, sealing a convincing win for Morocco.

Coach Walid Regragui utilized the second half to rotate the squad while maintaining control of the match. This performance boosts the team’s confidence as they prepare for the CAN 2025, set to take place in Morocco.
