Morocco’s national football team, the Atlas Lions delivered a strong performance in its Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2025 qualifier against the Central African Republic, securing a 4-0 victory in the second leg match on Tuesday, in Oujda.

From the opening whistle, Morocco mounted heavy pressure, driving the ball in search of scoring opportunities. Despite their offensive approach, it took time for the Atlas Lions, to break through the Central African Republic’s defense.

In the 36th minute, Morocco broke the deadlock with a precise strike from Eliesse Ben Seghir to give his team a 1-0 lead.

Morocco maintained possession and controlled the pace of the game as CAR failed to mount any meaningful attacks, without a single shot on target.

The second half started with Morocco maintaining control and pushing for further goals. In the 54th minute, Youssef En-Nesyri scored a penalty to extend the team’s lead to 3-0 in the 57th minute.

Abde Ezzalzouli added a fourth and final goal of the game, in the 72nd minute to finalise the 4-0 victory.
