Preview: Lesotho vs. Gabon - prediction, team news, lineups

In their fourth match of their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign, Lesotho will be hoping to pick up their first win in Group B on Tuesday at Moses Mabhida Stadium, when they host Gabon.

The home team are last in fourth place with one point and drew 0-0 with the visitors last time out on Friday, while Gabon are second with four points and currently occupy one of the group's two qualification spots.

Lesotho managed to earn their first point of their qualifying campaign against Tuesday's opponents after defending brilliantly in Friday's match, limiting Gabon to no big chances despite them having 72% possession.

The hosts lost 3-1 against Central African Republic on September 5 and lost 1-0 against Morocco on September 9, and have produced just two big chances in their three matches so far.

Boss Leslie Notsi, who has taken charge of 10 games since June 2023, has the daunting task of trying to qualify Likuena for their first AFCON tournament in their history,

Notsi's side are in poor form having lost five and drawn two of their last seven matches, scoring four times and conceding on 11 occasions.

Lesotho have drawn three and lost six of their nine most recent home games, though they did win three of the prior four home fixtures.

The visitors began their qualifying campaign with a 4-1 defeat against Morocco on September 6, a match in which they conceded two penalties by the 26th minute.

Gabon then beat Central African Republic 2-0 on September 10 and managed to produce 10 shots from inside the penalty area, six more than their opponents.

Manager Thierry Mouyouma was appointed in late 2023 and took over from previous boss Patrice Neveu, who failed to qualify the side for the 2023 edition of AFCON.

Mouyouma has been in charge for nine matches, winning four, drawing two and losing three, and he has led his side to two wins in their last four games - talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored three of his team's six goals in that period.

Gabon's away form in recent weeks has been poor considering they have lost their last three fixtures on the road and have been defeated in five of their last seven away games.

Lesotho are likely to name a similar starting XI to the side that drew with Gabon last time out, though Thabang Malane did come on at half time for winger Teboho Letsema.

Goalkeeper Sekhoane Moerane could start behind centre-backs Thabo Makhele and Rethabile Rasethuntsa, while Lisema Lebokollane and Tsepo Toloane may start in a double pivot.

Malane could start on the right of attack alongside Tshwarelo Bereng, Jane Thaba-Ntso and striker Katleho Makateng.

Meanwhile, the away team may start a similar defence to the one that drew against Lesotho, with goalkeeper Loyce Mbaba likely to be shielded by defenders Anthony Oyono, Aaron Appindangoye, Alex Moucketou-Moussounda and Urie-Michel Mboula.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is set to miss out on his side's match on Tuesday due to persistent knee discomfort, and Shavy Warren Babicka could replace the forward.

Babicka may be partnered in attack with Jim Allevinah on the right and Denis Bouanga on the left.


Lesotho possible starting lineup:
Moerane; Sefoli, Makhele, Rasethuntsa, Matsoele; Lebokollane, Toloane; Malane, Bereng, Thaba-Ntso; Makateng

Gabon possible starting lineup:
Mbaba; Oyono, Appindangoye, Moucketou-Moussounda, Mboula; Baboue, Lemina, Kanga; Allevinah, Babicka, Bouanga



We say: Lesotho 1-1 Gabon

Without Aubameyang leading the line, Gabon could struggle to finish many of their chances in front of goal, and it would not be surprising if the visitors failed to score more than once.

If Lesotho are as defensively resilient as they were in their previous encounter with Gabon, it is plausible that they can earn their second point of their qualifying campaign.
