Real Madrid's winger overcame a rough game one performance to put on a brilliant show as Brazil earned first Copa America 2024 victory

When you hear the name Selecao, you often think of Brazilian greats, and that often correlates with sensational footballing skill. A goal, footwork, a certain skill move - there's a certain aura around that aspect of the game.

It's called Samba Football, or locally, it's referred to as Ginga. There are two main influences on Brazilian footballing style. First, a martial art called Capoeira: an ancient technique originating from Angola, including skills such as kicking, headbutting, deception and evasion. Secondly, the samba dance: a solo dance that is typically performed standing with a straight leg movement involving a slight bending of the knees.

Friday evening, Vinicius Jr. found his inner-samba.

It was a sensational display from the Real Madrid superstar, and it felt like a moment in which he truly showed the world he has what it takes to be the face of the next generation of the Selecao.

It began with a ridiculous rainbow near the sideline, and it was followed by a first-half brace.

After a disappointing matchday one showing, a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica, Brazil bounced back against Paraguay Friday night. With a stunning 4-1 result, the Selecao finally found a sense of identity on the pitch.

Although things started on a low note, a missed penalty kick attempt from Lucas Paqueta, Brazil fought until they broke the deadlock - three goals in 15 minutes. Vini opened the scoring in the 35th minute, with Savio following suit eight minutes later for his first international goal. The Real Madrid winger's brace arrived in first-half stoppage-time, just second before the whistle.

Paraguay, however, handed the Selecao a scare just three minutes into the final 45 minutes. A long-distance effort from Omar Alderete earned them a goal back, but that's all it was. One goal. In the 65th minute, Paqueta redeemed himself, handed another opportunity from the penalty spot and this time, finding the back of the net.

It wasn't the prettiest performance, and some horrendous defending from Paraguay gifted at least two goals, but in the end? A win is a win.

Brazil are officially up and running at Copa America, but now their biggest test of the tournament yet awaits on matchday three: Luis Diaz and Colombia, for a chance at winning the group stage,

Goalkeeper & Defense

Alisson (6/10):

Got a hand on Paraguay's opener - will be upset to not have kept it out. Otherwise, played his role effectively.

Danilo (6/10):

Played his role well as captain, de-escalating multiple scuffles. Not sure he's still the best option on the right, though. Little to zero high-quality overlap play with Savio.

Marquinhos (6/10):

Was exposed multiple times centrally by Paraguay's attack, but was absolutely pin-point with passing out of the back.

Eder Militao (6/10):

Not his most intimidating performance defensively, but was effective in moments.

Wendell (6/10):

A bit sloppy going forward, but looked more comfortable than Arana on matchday one.

Midfield

Bruno Guimares (7/10):

Showed veteran leadership across the match, and was cool, calm and composed all match.

Joao Gomes (7/10):

Another slick evening in the midfield. Did well to link the two ends of the pitch and was solid centrally.

Attack

Savio (7/10):

Never a bad night to bag your first international goal. Showed why he deserved the nod over contenders on the right wing.

Lucas Paqueta (5/10):

Missed his first penalty, scored his second. Wasn't particularly effective at the 10, otherwise.

Vinicius Jr. (9/10):

There was something special about Vini's performance. From a first-half rainbow flick to some silky footwork in the box, he was feeling himself. Add in a first-half brace, and it's a strong night.

Rodrygo (6/10)

It's incredibly hard to judge someone being forced to play in an unnatural position. He certainly was a threat, and tied up with defenders, but nothing truly came as a result of his showing at the 9.

Subs & Manager

Raphinha (6/10):

Replaced Savio, but didn't do much.

Douglas Luiz (6/10):

Replaced Guimares, locked down the midfield.

Endrick (N/A):

Late sub to close out the match.

Andreas Pereira (N/A):

Replaced Paqueta late, was rather lively.

Gabriel (N/A):

Subbed on late for Militao.

Dorival Junior (5/10):

Without Vini's brilliance, this result isn't as one-sided as the scoreline makes it look. The Selecao still look like square blocks trying to be put into round holes at times. Dorival needs to figure out what to do at the striker spot, because Rodrygo is not successful there.

To beat Colombia, a performance like this will not be good enough, regardless of the scoreline.
