Some additional detail from Associated Press.

The police spokesman said there was no initial indication that the incident was related to the soccer game.

German authorities have put police on high alert during the tournament, which began on Friday and runs through July 14, for fear of possible fan violence and terrorist attacks.

On Friday, police shot to death an Afghan man after he fatally attacked a compatriot and later wounded three people watching the televised game between Germany and Scotland in a town in eastern Germany. Police said Sunday that the motive for that attack was still unclear.

Here’s a translated version of the Bild story on this incident.

Hamburg – A major police operation took place on Hamburg’s Reeperbahn on Sunday afternoon. A man armed with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail was struck down by police near Silbersackstrasse.

40,000 fans celebrated peacefully at the Dutch fan march before the European Championship match between Poland and the Netherlands. Then, at 12.30 p.m., police had to take action against a rioting man who “came out of a bar with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail and threatened the police,” according to a spokesman.

The incident occurred near the Reeperbahn S-Bahn station, over a kilometer away from the official fan zone.

The police first used pepper spray against the attacker, then a firearm. According to police, one officer initially fired a warning shot to stop the attacker. Then several shots were fired until the man finally fell to the ground.

The man was injured in the leg by the shots. “He is currently receiving medical treatment in hospital.” There was no mention of any other injuries. “There is no indication that there is a football connection,” the spokesman continued.

The attacker also had a Molotov cocktail in his hand. The police assume that he wanted to set off the incendiary device in the hustle and bustle of the fans.

Man with pickaxe shot by police in Hamburg

Hamburg Police have released a tweet about the incident at the Reeperbahn, which roughly translates as follows:

A person threatened police officers with a pickaxe and an incendiary device. The emergency services then made use of their firearms. The attacker was injured and is currently receiving medical treatment.

Barney Ronay on Gareth Southgate

Yet the talk, the chat, is once again about a hand of talent that is “the envy of the world”, about righteous attack, about not just releasing the handbrake but wrenching it off and hurling out of the window, “overwhelming” other very competent football teams who also have good players. For all the mannered humility, the process, the care taken along the way, this is basically a reboot: Golden Generation 2: This Time We’re Convinced We’re Not Really Like That.

We play Germany in four days. I dare anybody to bet one Hungarian forint on us. As of today that looks impossible. Germany are a different team than the last Euros, they proved it against Scotland. In my opinion they are the biggest favourite of the European Championship.

England team news: Alexander-Arnold and Guehi expected to start

John Stones and Bukayo Saka are reportedly fit, so this is the probable XI that will start against Serbia.

England (4-2-3-1) Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold, Rice; Saka, Bellingham, Foden; Kane.

For all the talk of England’s youngsters, that’s a pretty experienced team. Marc Guehi is the only player who doesn’t have at least 25 caps.

Serbia are managed by the great Dragan Stojkovic, and he couldn’t care less who they’re playing against.

I am here to talk about Serbia, not England. They are a team that tries to be the champion of Europe, but to achieve that they have to do it on the pitch… I think the game is going to be very open. Serbia will not just wait and watch England play. On the contrary we will try to create as many problems for them. If we score first, the order is going to be score the second. It’s very simple.

Harry Kane on England’s chances

It is a fantastic squad. I think it is hard to say if it is the most talented, we have had talented squads throughout the whole of England’s history. But it is probably the most in-form squad we have had when you look at the players and the seasons they have had for their clubs, I think everyone is really ready.

We have all had great seasons so time will tell, you have to turn club form into international form and that is what we will be looking to do and we have had a couple of weeks now to prepare with each other and we have got to go and show that.

“Morning Rob,” says Andrew Benton. “I think this new England team will be collectively quite fragile as a playing unit, and if they get pooped today they’ll have less confidence for the next game... and so on. Let’s hope for a set of brilliant individual performances a la Michael Owen 1998 so they don’t need to worry.”

Six months ago I was convinced England would win the tournament. Now I’m not so sure, mainly because of the defence. If I was an England fan I’d also be worried about the lack of width in the team, especially when they come up against a low block.

Gareth Southgate on Trent Alexander-Arnold

Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to play as a midfielder – pure bred, no hybrid – tonight. Many pundits have criticised his lack of defensive nous, most notably Wayne Rooney and Roy Keane, and Gareth Southgate was asked the question during his press conference.

Everybody’s more than entitled to opinions. I spoke to Trent about playing in this role over a year ago. It’s not something he’s been doing for the last five years. There is an element of the unknown. But I think it’s an opportunity that’s worth grasping because he could be incredibly special.

So, England. You can read all our preview pieces on our dedicated Euro 2024 site, but we’ll dot them here throughout the day as well. Let’s start with David Hytner on Harold Kane esq.

Kane made the point that the squad stood apart from previous vintages because of the form that many of the players were taking into the finals. Phil Foden, for example, is the player of the year in England; Jude Bellingham in Spain. Kane also backed himself to win the Golden Boot, which he secured at the 2018 World Cup. “There is no reason why I cannot be the top scorer,” he said. “If we do well, I expect myself to be up there. That confidence is still there.”

Germany are basking in the afterglow of their impressive performance against Scotland on Friday. Here’s what Kai Havertz had to say about it.

I hope there is more to come. Obviously when you win 5-1 it is a statement but it is just the start and you can see how much quality there is in the team, how many good players that we have.

Although Scotland were a very good team with a great coach, the opponents are going to get tougher. It was actually a tough match. But as you go further and further into a tournament, the matches get harder and harder. We keep on going, train good, sleep good. And play with confidence.

Preamble

Hello and welcome to our live blog for day three of Euro 2024. It’s the big one, the day when our heroes enter the tournament. Denmark play Slovenia at 5pm, hoping to emulate the boys of 1984, 1992 or even 2021.

England are also involved: they meet an attacking Serbian side in Gelsenkirchen tonight. And first up, Poland play the Netherlands in Hamburg. That game is in an intriguing Group D, which also includes France and a fast-improving Austria. I was going to say the Netherlands can’t afford to slip up, but it didn’t do them any harm when they lost their first game of the last European Championship to be played in Germany.

If you prefer these things in list form, here are today’s games.

Poland v Netherlands (Group D, 2pm)

Slovenia v Denmark (Group C, 5pm)

Serbia v England (Group C, 8pm)
