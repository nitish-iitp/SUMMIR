Austria pick up a vital win in Berlin to keep alive their hopes of progressing to the Euro 2024 last 16. Check out the best facts and analyse the Opta data with our Poland vs Austria stats page.

Second-half goals from Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic gave Austria a vital victory over Poland in Berlin. After a defeat to France in their opening game, three points were much needed to give them a chance of progressing to the knockout stage of Euro 2024.

Gernot Trauner opened the scoring for Austria after only nine minutes – their earliest European Championship goal of all-time. Meeting Phillipp Mwene’s dinked cross, Trauner had to both direct the header and generate enough power on it to beat Wojciech Szczesny in the Polish goal. It was an excellent finish, and one that brought the Feyenoord defender just his second international goal for Austria.

Ralf Rangnick’s side failed to build on their lead, however, and Poland equalised on the half-hour mark. After some pinballing in the Austria box following a corner, Krzysztof Piatek fired into the back of the net to score his first international goal since November 2022.

With Robert Lewandowski still only on the bench due to injury, the pressure was on the other Polish strikers to find the goals at Euro 2024, and Piatek’s goal today followed Adam Buksa’s in the Matchday 1 loss to the Netherlands.

Poland attempted to tilt the game in their favour by bringing Lewandowski off the bench on the hour mark, but it was Austria who capitalised to go back ahead in the 66th minute via the excellent Baumgartner.

His fifth international goal of 2024 came after a clever dummy from captain Arnautovic saw the ball reach him on the half-turn, before he took a touch and slotted past Szczesny. That took him to 16 goals overall for Austria, which is more than any other player since winning his first cap in September 2020.

The RB Leipzig attacking midfielder entered the tournament in good form, scoring two of their three goals across the two warm-up matches versus Serbia and Switzerland, and this strike gave him his second major tournament goal for his country after his winner against Ukraine at Euro 2020.

Arnautovic scored himself with a 78th-minute penalty, sending Szczesny the wrong way after the goalkeeper had conceded the spot-kick, fouling Marcel Sabitzer after he raced through on goal. Arnautovic moved to 37 goals for his country, now just seven away from Toni Polster’s record tally of 44.

Regardless of the result in the match later on Friday between Netherlands and France, Austria know that a win in their final game versus the Dutch next Tuesday will be enough to send them to the last 16 – even if it’s via being one of the best third-place teams in the group stage.

For Poland, this result means they have lost two European Championship matches in a row for the first time ever and are on the verge of exiting the tournament. Few will be expecting them to upset France next week, and the Opta supercomputer seems to agree. Following this game, it projects Poland to reach the last 16 in just 2.0% of simulations.
