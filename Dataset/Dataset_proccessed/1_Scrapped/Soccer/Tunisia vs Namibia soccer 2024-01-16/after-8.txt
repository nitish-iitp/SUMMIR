Tunisia vs Namibia LIVE!

Namibia are celebrating securing their first-ever Africa Cup of Nations victory. The Brave Warriors produced an excellent display to thwart fancied Tunisia in Tuesday night's Group E opener at the Amadou Gon Coulibaly Stadium in Korhogo, with the impressive Deon Hotto popping up with a close-range header in the 89th minute to write his name into Namibian football folklore.

Namibia had never previously won an AFCON game on three previous appearances at the finals, drawing two and losing seven of their nine matches on the biggest continental stage, exiting at the groups on each occasion. But now they have real hope of reaching the knockouts for the first time, with South Africa and Mali to come next.

Tunisia certainly created enough chances to secure a positive result on Tuesday, but the Eagles of Carthage could not find a way past inspired goalkeeper Lloyd Kazapua to leave head coach Jalel Kadri with plenty of work to do already to rescue this campaign.

Match report

Namibia made history by stunning Tunisia to record their first-ever Africa Cup of Nations win.

Deon Hotto popped up with an 89th-minute header from close range in Monday's entertaining Group E opener for the impressive Brave Warriors, who continued a theme of upsets during the initial stages of the latest AFCON tournament in Ivory Coast.

It follows Cape Verde's stunning last-gasp victory over Ghana on Sunday, with seven-time winners Egypt also having needed a late penalty to avoid a shock loss to Mozambique.

Nigeria and Algeria were also held by Equatorial Guinea and Angola respectively in their opening matches as the bigger nations continue to struggle early on.
