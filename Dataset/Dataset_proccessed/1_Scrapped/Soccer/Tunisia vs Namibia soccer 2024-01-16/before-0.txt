Namibia’s journey in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) has been marked by perseverance and setbacks, making only three appearances since their debut in 1998. Despite the challenges, they have faced premature exits in each tournament, finishing at the bottom of their groups.

Their debut in 1998 showed promise with a draw against Angola, but subsequent losses to Ivory Coast and South Africa left them at the group’s bottom. A decade later in 2008, Namibia returned, hoping for improvement. However, losses to Morocco and Ghana, along with a draw against Guinea, resulted in another early exit.

The most recent AFCON saw the Brave Warriors facing familiar foes – Morocco, South Africa, and Ivory Coast – ending with defeats in each group stage match, marking their worst performance.

As they prepare for the 2023 AFCON in Group E against Tunisia, Mali, and South Africa, the Brave Warriors aim to rewrite their AFCON history. Breaking free from the group stage has become their rallying cry, with fans hopeful for a turning point in this edition.

Led by coach Collin Benjamin, Namibia’s squad blends experience and determination, ready to tackle the formidable challenges ahead. The football world watches eagerly to see if the Brave Warriors can defy the odds and make a triumphant stride in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.
