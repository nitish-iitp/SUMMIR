That’ll do for tonight. Absolutely chuffed for my fellow Southern African brethren. Now for South Africa to get the job done over Mali and complete the double!

With this win, their first ever in Afcon, Namibia go top of Group E. A simply astounding result.

As for Tunisia, well, they were pretty dire for the most part though they still had chances to win it. Sharper shooting, greater urgency in midfield and more visible desire is what’s needed as they navigate a tough road to qualification for the next round.

Taraa.

No question about this decision. He was fantastic.

Full-time: Namibia 1-0 Tunisia

Oh yes they can! One of the great upsets in a tournament now being defined by upsets. Namibia’s first ever win in this competition and they fully deserved it. Both ‘keepers had storming games but it was Namibia who created more, were sharper in attack and hurried in midfield like a team that wanted it more. A brilliant night and a victory for the south of the continent over the more storied north.

90+5 min: Several Namibian players are out on their feet. We’re past the five minute mark. Can they hold on?

90+4 min: Tunisia on the attack but running into traffic. Namibia are defending for their lives.

18.56 GMT

90+3 min: Namibia have the ball in the net but it’s off-side. Namibia broke and Hotto slotted the ball in after collecting a wonderful ball against the grain. He was clearly off-side. I’m not sure why the player (I missed who that was, this is getting hectic) didn’t shoot. Anyway, Namibia are on fire!

90+2 min: Srarfi replaces Achouri who seemed to have run out of steam. Three minutes to go.

90 min: Tunisia have a chance themselves. A ball from the left has Namibian defenders panicking. But no Tunisian can meet it and Kazapua collects. Five minutes added on.

Goal! Namibia 1-0 Tunisia

Finally they’ve done it! They deserve it. Hotto with a header from a deep cross on the left. Poor marking leaves him clear near the back post. The ball came from a long way out. Tunisia perhaps tried to play the off-side trap but it didn’t work. Hotto climbs into the header and smashes it into the net. He celebrates with a cartwheel and now Namibia are just a few minutes away from a historic first Afcon win.

87 min: Deflected just wide! Aprocius Petrus wafts at a loose ball from the corner and a Tunisian face diverts it wide. Another corner for Namibia.

18.50 GMT

86 min: Hotto goes for goal. It’s a decent effort. Whipped with real pace. But Ben Said gets a first hand on it and tips the ball over. This has been a game for fans of quality goal keeping. Still, Namibia will press again with a corner.

85 min: Nifty footwork from Hotto – who has been the best player on the park – wins Namibia a free-kick on the right of Tunisia’s box. A decent ball and they could be in.

83 min: Slimane is off. There goes the sole Premier League rep. Ltaief comes on. Attacker for attacker. Tunisia know they have to win this.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.45 GMT

80 min: A free-kick for Namibia now. It’s short but it sits up for a shot from Bethuel Muzeu on the edge of the area. It’s wide. But shows how delicately this is poised.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.42 GMT

78 min: My goodness! Another world class save from Namibia’s keeper Kazapua. A clever overhead hook at the near post tees up an onrushing Msakni who couldn’t time his header any better. It looks destined for the top corner until Kazapua leaps and tips it over the bar. A brilliant save keeps this level.

Share

18.40 GMT

76 min: Corner for Namibia. They’re loading bodies around the near post. An interesting tactic. There are four of them jostling for space in front of that post. Plenty of space elsewhere in the box. The ball is too long and is punched away by Ben Said. Legs are hacking at a loose ball and the whistle goes. Was there a hand-ball by a Tunisian player? No says the referee. In fact it’s a Namibian hand-ball so it ends with a Tunisian free-kick from their own box.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.37 GMT

74 min: A cute ball from a central position by the Tunisian captain Msakni finds Slimane in open space inside the box to the left of the goal. But a poor touch sees it out for a goal-kick. Not for the first time, a better touch from a Tunisian player could have seen them get a clear shot away.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.33 GMT

71 min: Another top save from Kazapua! Achouri on the gallop can’t get to the through ball before the angle becomes acute and his side-footed effort is smothered by the ‘keeper who makes himself big as he covers ground. Excellent save.

And time for a drinks break.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.32 GMT

70 min: So close again for Tunisia! A good free-kick from the left draws Kazapua out. He flaps at it and there’s a flick-on that just evades the far post. Again I ask, how is this goalless.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.30 GMT

68 min: Namibia have seemingly settled into a more defensive pattern. Or Tunisia have come out of their shells.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.27 GMT

66 min: Slimane shoots from distance and there’s an appeal for a hand-ball. Shot was never on and it’s a credit to Namibia’s defence that forced the skipper’s hand/boot.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.26 GMT

64 min: Oh crazy! Kazapua’s clearance booms upfield and now Namibia have a chance. A low ball into the box by Hotto sits nicely for Shalulile who spins and shoots but it’s blocked. How is this still goalless? Fair play to both teams. They’ve really upped the entertainment value in this second half.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.24 GMT

63 min: Outstanding sweeping from Kazapua who exploded off his line to deny Maaloul a chance to shoot. The left-back suddenly found himself in acres of space on the overlap and were it not for the ‘keeper, he’d have had a clear run on goal from just outside the box.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.23 GMT

62 min: Petrus Shitembi is hooked for Ngero Katua. It’s a defensive switch on paper but could see Namibia assert dominance in midfield.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.21 GMT

60 min: Namibia on the ball again after a ropey spell. Petrus puts his foot on it to slow things down. But Tunisia start clattering into tackles. Namibia do likewise. Neither side can get control. Madness in the middle. Game needs a goal.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.19 GMT

58 min: Jouini with another shot from inside the box. This wasn’t an easy one. On the volley and the half-turn, he drags it wide. Was called for off-side though I don’t think he was. Tunisia starting to flex a little. A greater sense of urgency from the Eagles of Carthage (don’t you just love that name?)

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.16 GMT

55 min: Jouini with a golden chance. The ball breaks in the box and the striker pulls his shot. He was about six metres from goal. Sure, he was on the angle to the left of the goal, but he missed by some distance. Watching the replay I actually have no idea how he didn’t at least find the target. A shocking miss!

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.13 GMT

53 min: A rare chance for Tunisia. Half a chance actually. A long ball finds Achouri in space on the left deep in Namibian territory. He can’t control and it comes to nothing. A better first touch and he had a clear path to goal.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.12 GMT

52 min: No they can’t. But before Tunisia can counter they have the ball nicked off them. Namibia operating at a faster speed.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.12 GMT

50 min: INCHES! Maybe just an inch. Shalulile ought to have scored. Hotton on the right blitzes round his defender and delivers a wicked low ball. Shalulile, diving in, gets the ball stuck under his feet and it squirts towards the goal but just won’t go in. Tunisia scramble it away for a corner. They must defend another corner. And another. Namibia hammering the front post with these deliveries. Can they make it fourth time lucky?

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.10 GMT

49 min: It’s still early in the half but this looks better from Tunisia. They’re less rushed on the ball and showing more respect to Namibia’s high defence. Though, as I type that, a wayward pass allows Namibia to counter. Nothing comes of it, but that’s a template for Namibia.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.09 GMT

48 min: Namibia seemed spooked by that chance. Scrambling defence gets it clear. Now they’re settled and on the front foot. But their attack came to nothing.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.07 GMT

46 min: Oh, almost a goal immediately! A corner to Tunisia is brilliant met by a firm flick off the head of Msakni at the near post. He’s kept out by a sharp save by a leaping Kazapua who tips over.

Share
16 Jan 2024
18.05 GMT

Half-time change for Tunisia. Hertha Berlin midfielder Laidouni replaces Romdhan to, hopefully, establish some control in that midfield.

Share
16 Jan 2024
17.54 GMT

Don’t let a goalless first-half turn you off. In fact, don’t let a goalless 95 minutes turn you off because the day’s earlier game between Burkina Faso and Mauritania was settled in the 96th minute with what was effectively the last kick of the match.

Half-time: Tunisia 0-0 Namibia

It wasn’t a classic. Far from it. But it did show that the underdogs have come to play. Namibia, unfancied before kick-off, bossed that half and perhaps should have been ahead. Tunisia were pretty dire. A major rethink is needed during the break.

Share
16 Jan 2024
17.50 GMT

45+3 min: A dribbler of a shot near the corner of the box by Shalulile. Before that Namibia played some nifty football to make the space but it was a snatched shot that harmlessly dribbled wide.

17.48 GMT

45+1 min: Four added minutes. Might be more as Jouini has clattered on the half-way line.

Share
16 Jan 2024
17.46 GMT

44 min: Slimane hacks Nyambe’s calf. A chance for Namibia to get it in the box. It’s a deep cross which isn’t cleared. It almost falls for a man in red but it’s hoofed away in a hurry by one in white.

Share
16 Jan 2024
17.45 GMT

42 min: The in-swinging corner is defended well. Namibia get the counter going but swift work from Ben Said sweeps away the danger.

Share
16 Jan 2024
17.42 GMT

40 min: Corner for Tunisia. A bouncing ball eventually ricochets off a Namibian with Sheffield United’s Slimane causing problems. Achouri needs a wad of tissue to mop the blood up his nose after the ball smashed his nose.

Share
16 Jan 2024
17.40 GMT

39 min: Tunisia try to hack their way out of trouble but there’s no space to do even that. Namibia charge forward and get a block on the hoof. The ball bounces out for a throw but that’s yet another example of Namibia’s tenacity.

Share
16 Jan 2024
17.39 GMT

38 min: Tunisia have the ball in midfield for the first time in an age. Namibia are closing space down before it opens and Msakni feels he has no choice but to launch it long. It’s a bit aimless. Namibia back in possession and firmly in control of this now.
