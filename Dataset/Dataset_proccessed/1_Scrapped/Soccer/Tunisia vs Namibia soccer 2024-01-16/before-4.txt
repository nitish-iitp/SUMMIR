The Carthage Eagles of Tunisia, a stalwart presence in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), are driven by determination as they aim for redemption in the 2023 edition following their quarterfinal exit in the previous tournament.

In the early years of AFCON, Tunisia emerged as a formidable force, achieving a third-place finish in 1962 and experiencing a heartbreaking loss to Ghana in the 1965 final. Undeterred, the North African nation showcased their prowess by reaching the semifinals three times in their first five appearances, establishing their relevance and competence on the continental stage.

The pinnacle of Tunisia’s AFCON journey arrived in 2004 when they hosted the tournament. The Carthage Eagles soared to victory by overcoming challenges in the group stage and navigating the knockout stage with a slim win against Senegal and a nerve-wracking penalty shootout victory against Nigeria in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. In a thrilling final, Tunisia emerged triumphant, defeating Morocco 2-1 to clinch their first and only AFCON title.

Since their historic win, Tunisia has consistently been a force to be reckoned with, regularly reaching the quarterfinal stage except for a fourth-place finish in 2019. However, the recent edition saw them exit in the quarterfinals at the hands of Burkina Faso, motivating the Carthage Eagles to bounce back in the upcoming competition.

With a rich AFCON history and the taste of glory still fresh from 2004, Tunisia is poised to make a statement in the 2023 AFCON. Football enthusiasts around the globe eagerly await the performance of the Carthage Eagles as they aim to reclaim their status as champions of African football.

Key Players to Watch:

Youssef Msakni: Youssef Msakni, the captain of the Tunisian national team, has been a linchpin since his international debut in 2010. The Al Arabi forward boasts an impressive record, with 22 goals in 97 appearances. Notably, his AFCON journey spans seven editions, making 26 appearances and contributing seven goals with four assists. At 33, Msakni remains a vital force in Tunisia’s lineup, aiming to lead his team to success once again.
Ellyes Skhiri: Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Ellyes Skhiri, at 28, is anticipated to be a key player for the Carthage Eagles, drawing on his exceptional club form. With 60 caps for Tunisia, including 12 AFCON appearances from 2019 onwards, Skhiri’s consistency is expected to play a crucial role in Tunisia’s pursuit of success. His midfield prowess and experience make him a valuable asset for the team.
Ferjani Sassi: Central midfielder Ferjani Sassi, absent in the 2021 edition, is set to make a comeback in the 2023 AFCON. With 80 appearances for the North African side, the 31-year-old brings a wealth of experience to the team. Sassi, a former Zamalek midfielder, has had a noteworthy season in the Qatar Stars League, scoring two goals and providing three assists in 12 league appearances. His return is expected to bolster Tunisia’s midfield and contribute to their campaign success.

Coach Jalal Kadri: Jalal Kadri, who took charge during the 2021 AFCON, stepped up to lead the team after replacing Mondher Kebaier due to COVID-19 infection. Following a successful stint as an interim boss, Kadri secured Tunisia’s spot in the 2022 World Cup by eliminating Burkina Faso.
