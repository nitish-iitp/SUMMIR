In a battle of two long-time foes, Germany lead the Netherlands 2-1 at the break, with fans of both sides treated to an all-action encounter in the UEFA Nations League.

Ronald Koeman's side initially exposed some shoddy defending by the Germans, who were without West Ham United striker Niclas Fullkrug due to an Achilles injury so Deniz Undav started up front.

An eventful half got off to the best possible start for the hosts, as Brian Brobbey - replacing Joshua Zirkzee in the starting XI - cleverly chested the ball down for Ryan Gravenberch, who then released Tijjani Reijnders to open the scoring within two minutes of kickoff.

Soon after, Kai Havertz was denied by Bart Verbruggen's smart save, before a dangerous Xavi Simons free kick was met by an unmarked Dumfries, who somehow sent his header agonisingly wide of the post.

Ter Stegen then denied Simons the Oranje's second goal midway through a wide-open half, not long before Die Nationalmannschaft came close to equalising through Jamal Musiala.

Then, Florian Wirtz saw his angled shot saved, but Undav followed up to turn home the rebound, netting his first goal for his national team and levelling the match.

However, a buoyant atmosphere inside Johan Cruijff Arena was quelled when Nathan Ake was forced off with a serious-looking injury, to be replaced by fellow defender Jurrien Timber.

With the half-time whistle nearing, Germany captain Joshua Kimmich pounced from close range to turn the game on its head and set up a mouthwatering second half.

HALF-TIME PREDICTION: NETHERLANDS 1-2 GERMANY

Two old foes meet in the second game of their UEFA Nations League campaigns on Tuesday, as the Netherlands welcome Germany to Johan Cruijff Arena.

Both sides smashed five past their opponents on the opening matchday, so they will now battle it out for top spot in League A Group 3.

Ultimately aiming to win the Nations League and end their decades-long wait for a trophy, the Netherlands kicked off their latest quest on Saturday evening, as they took on Bosnia-Herzegovina in Eindhoven.

Starting up front in the absence of Memphis Depay, Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee quickly scored his first international goal with a clever flicked header, and despite conceding an equaliser, the Oranje were back in front when Tijjani Reijnders converted Zirkzee's assist just before half time.

During the second half, Ronald Koeman's side scored three more - through Cody Gakpo, Wout Weghorst and Xavi Simons - as they ran out 5-2 winners in their first match since exiting Euro 2024.

The Netherlands were beaten in the semi-finals this summer, suffering late heartbreak against England, who they also met when last coming close to finally claiming some silverware.

After slaying the Three Lions in the inaugural Nations League semi-finals five years ago - during Koeman's first spell in charge - the Oranje lost to Portugal in the decider; more recently, they finished fourth when hosting the finals tournament in 2023.

To get that far, they saw off Belgium, Poland and Wales, but only a top-two finish is required for entry into the Nations League's new quarter-final stage this season.

That reduces the stakes when they reconvene with Germany, a nation forever linked with their football history: Johan Cruyff's Dutch side lost out in the World Cup final of 1974, but during his playing days, Koeman's team beat their hosts en route to glory at Euro '88.

While Germany came out on top in the nations' most recent friendly - winning 2-1 at home in March - competitive contests over the past few years have been edged by the Netherlands.

The teams shared 18 goals across four games across the first Nations League and Euro 2020 qualifying, and Julian Nagelsmann's current squad joined their old rivals in firing home five on Saturday night.

Missing several retired stalwarts, new-look Germany thrashed Hungary in Dusseldorf, with Kai Havertz becoming the fifth different scorer from a late penalty, having already struck the woodwork twice.

After coming up short at their home Euros, Die Nationalelf are targeting a first Nations League finals appearance next summer, before building towards the 2026 World Cup, where they aim to regain the global title.

Since succeeding Hansi Flick, Nagelsmann has won eight of his first 14 matches, and with Havertz leading an attack featuring stars such as Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, the 37-year-old Bundestrainer will expect to take at least a point home from Amsterdam.

Having scored his first Netherlands goal at the weekend, Joshua Zirkzee will expect to keep his place on Tuesday evening, though Brian Brobbey and Wout Weghorst are also contenders to start up front - or Cody Gakpo could fill in as a false nine.

Alongside midfielders Marten de Roon and Georginio Wijnaldum, plus veteran defender Daley Blind, Ronald Koeman has left out two regular forwards this month: he has been embroiled in a public row about Steven Bergwijn's recent switch to the Saudi Pro League, while star striker Memphis Depay is still searching for a new club.

Micky van de Ven and Joey Veerman pulled out with injuries, but Arsenal's Jurrien Timber made his comeback against Bosnia, as he and brother Quinten Timber both came off the bench to represent their country together for the first time.

Meanwhile, Germany continue their transition to a more youthful squad: with Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller, Ilkay Gundogan and Toni Kroos no longer available, Julian Nagelsmann appointed Joshua Kimmich as captain.

Kimmich will skipper his national side for a 10th time on Tuesday, when an exciting front four could start again. Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala should support either one or both of Kai Havertz and Niclas Fullkrug - the latter has now scored 14 times in just 22 international appearances.

Leroy Sane is still struggling with an injury so was not called up, while Antonio Rudiger has been rested; the Real Madrid man's absence should see Jonathan Tah partner Nico Schlotterbeck in defence.


Netherlands possible starting lineup:
Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Gravenberch, Reijnders; Simons, Gakpo; Zirkzee

Germany possible starting lineup:
Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Schlotterbeck, Tah, Mittelstadt; Andrich, Pavlovic; Musiala, Havertz, Wirtz; Fullkrug



We say: Netherlands 2-2 Germany

Given recent history and their free-scoring starts to this Nations League campaign, the Netherlands and Germany are set to share a few goals on Tuesday night.

Both teams have some bright attacking talent, while doubts remain about either side's defence, so it should be an entertaining encounter between Group 3's top two.
