Netherlands vs Germany Prediction & Betting tips

The derby on the last day of the UEFA Nations League will be played on Tuesday from 19:45 at the Johan Cruijff Arena stadium in Amsterdam, where the Netherlands will receive the visit of Germany, in a match from League A, Group 3. In this group there are also Bosnia & Herzegovina and Hungary, but the main favorites are the two national teams that are going to face each other. The Netherlands and Germany met most recently this year, in a friendly match in which although the Netherlands opened the scoring in the 4th minute, they were defeated by Germany 2-1 in the end. The two also met in 2018 in this competition and then the Netherlands won 3-0 in the round match and in the return leg a draw was recorded, score 2-2.

Netherlands:

The Netherlands made a spectacular start to this new edition of the UEFA Nations League, winning 5-2 at home against Bosnia & Herzegovina. The Netherlands was at one point tied at 1-1, and Bosnia again came within a goal difference at the score of 3-2, but in the end the Netherlands scored twice in the 88th and 92nd minutes and managed to win. The Netherlands was a semi-finalist at Euro 2024, where it was defeated on the way to the final by England, after a 2-1 defeat, despite the fact that it was the team that had opened the score first. The Netherlands played the very first final of this UEFA Nations League competition, being defeated 1-0 by Portugal, and in the previous edition it was eliminated in the semi-final by Croatia.

Germany:

On the other hand, Germany also started strongly this edition of the UEFA Nations League, achieving a 5-0 victory at home against Hungary, and in this way took revenge after the defeat suffered in the previous edition of the UEFA Nations League, score 0-1. Germany has so far failed to win this competition and has never qualified beyond the groups. Germany is coming after the disappointment of Euro 2024, where even though it was the host, it failed to go beyond the quarter-finals, being defeated by Spain, the winner of the competition.
