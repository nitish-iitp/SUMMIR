NETHERLANDS PREVIEW: ORANJE CONTINUING GOOD FORM

Ronald Koeman is a controversial and often aggravated personality but the Netherlands, after reaching the semi-finals of UEFA EURO 2024, are continuing to improve and they put in a strong performance against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Eindhoven the other day.

The Dutch took the lead after 13 minutes via Joshua Zirkzee before Ermedin Demirovic equalised about 14 minutes later. Tijjani Reijnders and Cody Gakpo made it 3-1 before Edin Dzeko pulled a goal back and then Wout Weghorst and Xavi Simons completed the rout.

GERMANY PREVIEW: DIE MANNSCHAFT REBUILDING

Following on from the retirements of Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos, Ilkay Gundogan and Thomas Muller since the summer, Die Mannschaft enjoyed an impressive victory as they hammered Hungary by five goals to nil at Merkur Spiel-Arena the other day.

The Germans opened the scoring in the 27th minute via Niclas Fullkrug before then running riot in the second-half with strikes coming from Jamal Musiala, Florian Wirtz, Aleksandar Pavlovic and a penalty by Kai Havertz.

NETHERLANDS TEAM NEWS: NO CHANGES TO BE MADE

Following the UEFA European Championships, Ronald Koeman is likely going to name an unchanged eleven for this one against Germany after an extremely impressive performance against the Germans the other day.

PREDICTED XI (4-3-3): Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Reijnders, Gravenberch; Simons, Zirkzee, Gakpo

GERMANY TEAM NEWS: FIT AND AVAILABLE

Germany head to the Netherlands with no injury concerns or suspension issues so Julian Nagelsmann is expected to name an unchanged side for this one with Niclas Fullkrug getting a deserved start for them against Hungary.

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Tah, Schlotterbeck, Raum; Andrich, Gross; Wirtz, Havertz, Musiala; Fullkrug

NETHERLANDS VS GERMANY PREDICTION

This should be quite an entertaining encounter with both teams currently in a positive and upward trajectory. Ronald Koeman still does not perhaps convince many but the Oranje played some good football this summer and have begun this international cycle in good form. Germany were excellent until their loss to eventual winners Spain at UEFA EURO 2024 and they are expected to get straight onto the front foot here. Both teams scoring seems a good bet.
