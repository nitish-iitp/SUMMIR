Nathan Ake had started the game against Germany

Manchester City defender Nathan Ake was taken off on a stretcher during the Netherlands' Nations League draw with Germany in Amsterdam.

Ake was carried off on the stroke of half-time after picking up what appeared to be a hamstring injury.

The 29-year-old made his first Premier League appearance of the season for Pep Guardiola's side in the 3-1 win against West Ham just before the international break, coming on as a late substitute.

Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman said further tests were needed to diagnose the injury.

"It looks like a muscle injury for Nathan, though I am not certain," he said.

The Netherlands had taken the lead after just two minutes in Tuesday's game when Tijjani Reijnders slotted in after good work by Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch.

Deniz Undav then marked his first start for Germany with a first goal for his country, finishing with a cool first-time strike.

Joshua Kimmich then put the visitors ahead on the stroke of half-time when he scored at the back post.

But just five minutes into the second half the Netherlands were level when Denzel Dumfries scored from inside the area.

David Raum missed the chance to secure victory for Germany when he sent a header from Kai Havertz's cross over the bar.
