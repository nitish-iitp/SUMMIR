Slovenia will face Kazakhstan at the Stocize Stadium on Monday in another round of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign. The home side have struggled for results in recent games and had to settle for a point in their Nations League opener on Friday.

Facing Austria on home soil, Matjaz Kek's men began the game on the front foot and were rewarded for their efforts after 16 minutes, with Benjamin Kallman opening the scoring from the spot before their opponents leveled the scores later in the half.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan traded tackles with Norway in their group opener on Friday and held on for a goalless draw to record a positive start to life under new boss Stanislav Cherchesov. They now sit third in their group with one point and will be hopeful for a favorable result on the road next Monday as they continue their quest for safety.
