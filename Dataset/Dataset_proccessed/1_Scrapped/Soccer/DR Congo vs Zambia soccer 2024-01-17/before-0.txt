Freetown, SIERRA LEONE – In their final preparatory match ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations, Sierra Leone experienced their second consecutive defeat, this time against Morocco, with Youssef En-Nesyri showcasing a standout performance by scoring a brace. The match follows Sierra Leone’s recent 5-1 loss to Ivory Coast, resulting in a cumulative score of 8 goals conceded against 2 scored in both friendly encounters.

Morocco, in their official match profile, detailed the scoring sequence, with En Nesyri netting the first goal in the 30th minute, followed by Boufal’s contribution just five minutes later. In the second half, Sevilla FC striker En Nesyri secured his brace in the 55th minute, while Abu Komeh managed to score Sierra Leone’s second goal for the national team.

Notably, Hakim Ziyech and Saiss were absent from the match against Sierra Leone due to discomfort, participating in individual training sessions. The closed-door match was not broadcast.

Morocco, placed in Group F for the Africa Cup of Nations, is scheduled to play their opening match against Tanzania on January 17, 2024, followed by a match against DR Congo on January 21, and their final group stage encounter against Zambia on January 24, 2024.

Sierra Leone, however, failed to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations, finishing third in Group A with five points. Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau secured the top two positions, leading to Sierra Leone’s elimination. Looking ahead, Sierra Leone is set to face Djibouti on June 5, 2024, and Burkina Faso on June 8, 2024, in the 2026 World Cup Qualifying Matches. BT/12/1/2024
