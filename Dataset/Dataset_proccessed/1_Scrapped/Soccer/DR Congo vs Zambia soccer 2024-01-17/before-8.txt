The Chipolopolo of Zambia, celebrated for their resilience in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), are poised for the 2023 edition with a fervent desire to relive the glory that crowned them champions in 2012.

Zambia’s AFCON history is rich, highlighted by their remarkable debut in 1974, reaching the final only to lose to Congo in a replay after a 2-2 draw. After securing third place in 1982 and 1990, they were runners-up in 1994. The breakthrough came in 2012 with a thrilling campaign, triumphing against powerhouses like Ghana and Ivory Coast to claim their first AFCON title.

Now, in the 2023 edition, facing DR Congo, Morocco, and Tanzania in a formidable group, Chipolopolo aims to showcase their historic resilience. Fans eagerly anticipate Zambia’s football prowess, hopeful for another memorable AFCON campaign as they set their sights on continental glory.

With five goals and three assists in 21 caps for Zambia, his goal is to enhance his country’s chances in the AFCON tournament.

Patson Daka: Leicester City forward Patson Daka emerges as a crucial figure for Zambia, bringing an impressive record of 18 goals in 40 games for his country. The 25-year-old has already made a mark in the English Championship, recording four goals and two assists in seven games this season. Daka’s goal-scoring prowess is anticipated to play a pivotal role as Zambia seeks success on the international stage.

Lubambo Musonda: As the captain of Zambia, Lubambo Musonda is set to lead the team with determination and experience. Currently playing on loan at Silkeborg IF from AC Horsens, the 28-year-old winger has made 44 appearances and is eager to make a mark in the upcoming tournament. Musonda’s leadership will be crucial, particularly as one of the few players with prior AFCON tournament experience.

Coach Avram Grant: The seasoned coach, Avram Grant, takes charge of Zambia, marking his third national team assignment after successful stints with the Black Stars of Ghana and the Israel national team. Grant led Ghana to the AFCON finals in 2015 and has extensive coaching experience with top-flight teams including Chelsea, West Ham United, and Portsmouth.
