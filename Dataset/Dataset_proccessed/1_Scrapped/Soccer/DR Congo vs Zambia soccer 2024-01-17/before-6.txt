DR Congo have hopes of excelling at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations, drawing inspiration from their past triumphs where they were crowned champions on two occasions.

The journey began with a group stage exit in 1965, but the Leopards quickly rebounded, securing their maiden AFCON title in 1968. DR Congo triumphed over Ethiopia in the semifinals and avenged their group stage loss against Ghana with a 1-0 victory in the final.

Despite facing elimination in the group stage in 1970 and finishing fourth in 1972, the Leopards roared back in 1974, claiming their second AFCON trophy. Their journey included a remarkable 4-1 victory against Mauritius and a memorable comeback against Egypt in the semifinals, leading to a final against Zambia that ended 2-2 after extra time. DR Congo capitalized on the replay, winning 2-0 and securing their second AFCON title.

Since their last triumphant campaign in 1974, DR Congo has navigated between group stage and quarterfinal exits, with two third-place finishes being their best. Now, in the 2023 AFCON, the Leopards are determined to recapture the glory of their past successes and make a mark in the storied legacy of DR Congo football.

Key Players to Watch:

Chancel Mbemba: Currently captaining Marseille, Chancel Mbemba stands out as one of Africa’s most reliable defenders. With an illustrious career that includes stints at FC Porto and Newcastle United, Mbemba’s defensive prowess has been acknowledged with the Marc Vivien Foe award – a prestigious accolade bestowed upon the best-performing African player in the French Ligue 1 each season.
Cédric Bakambu: Galatasaray’s skilled winger, Cédric Bakambu, has evolved into a linchpin for the Leopards. With an impressive record of 15 goals in 42 games for DR Congo, the former Villarreal forward is geared up for his third AFCON, aiming to further bolster his goal-scoring tally.
Yoane Wissa: Brentford’s dynamic attacker, Yoane Wissa, has been in stellar form in the ongoing 2023/2024 English Premier League season. The 27-year-old, yet to participate in a major tournament, is primed to seize the opportunity with both hands, adding a potent dimension to DR Congo’s attacking lineup.

Coach Sébastien Desabre: Guiding this talented ensemble is the experienced French coach, Sébastien Desabre. With a wealth of experience managing top African football clubs, Desabre brings a strategic and tactical edge to DR Congo. Having previously coached Uganda between 2017 and 2019, Desabre embarks on his second international stint, aiming to make a resounding statement with DR Congo’s national team.
