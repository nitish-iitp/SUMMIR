Game Preview

 

On January 17th at Laurent Pokou Stadium, the Democratic Republic of Congo will play Zambia during their Africa Cup of Nations Group F opening.

 

Despite having a wealth of talent, DR Congo’s AFCON experience has been dismal: three group stage eliminations, not qualifying for three straight tournaments between 2008 and 2012, an unexpected round of 16 loss to Madagascar in 2019, and not enough to make it to the last iteration. Enter Sébastien Desabre, a man accustomed to operating with limited resources. Héctor Cúper left the 47-year-old with a DR Congo team in a bit of a predicament, and the Leopards were at the bottom of their qualification group. After taking charge, Desabre led his team to 4 consecutive AFCON qualifying victories and a first-place position in Group I, despite the team being without a point after two losses to Gabon and Sudan and a seven-match losing skid. This team’s defense is by far its biggest flaw. Their set-piece shortcomings will be exposed against a more formidable team, despite their mere 4 goals conceded throughout qualification. Their full-backs are overly cautious or overly adventurous; they require equilibrium.

 

 

The trophy traveled with Zambia to Lusaka after their previous AFCON victory. That was in February of 2012, and the Chipolopolo lost the next two tournaments in the group stage. More sorrow followed when they were not selected for the next three editions. For the initial time since 2015, they are returning, accompanied by former Chelsea manager Avram Grant. When Grant took over in December 2022, Lameck Banda had recently relocated from Israel to Italy, and the speedy forward was now a viable offensive option. However, midfielder Kelvin Kapumbu, who competes for Zesco United in Zambia’s premier division, is the poster man of the Grant period. Kapumbu, who was once prone to receiving yellow and red cards, now directs his enthusiasm into smart runs, supporting his teammates’ creative play and defensive duties. His absence from the two games against Congo and Niger in November due to injury was noticeable.
