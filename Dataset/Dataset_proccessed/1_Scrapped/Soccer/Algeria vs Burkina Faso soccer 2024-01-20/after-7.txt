Algeria netted a stoppage-time equaliser to escape defeat at the Africa Cup of Nations finals on Saturday in an exciting 2-2 draw with Burkina Faso in Group D in Bouake that spared the 2019 champions yet another disappointing result at the tournament.

Baghdad Bounedjah netted from a corner five minutes into stoppage time at the end to ensure a share of the spoils and deny Burkina Faso early progress to the next stage.

Bounedjah scored both Algeria's goals while Mohamed Konate and Bertrand Traore netted for the Burkinabe, who remain top of the group on four points to two for Algeria

The two other teams in the group - Angola and Mauritania - were playing later on Saturday in Bouake.

Bounedjah brace keeps Algeria alive in AFCON

Baghdad Bounedjah's late goal kept 2019 winners Algeria alive at this year's Africa Cup of Nations in a thrilling draw with Burkina Faso.

Bounedjah netted from a corner five minutes into stoppage time at the end to ensure his side a share of the spoils and deny Burkina Faso early progress to the next stage.

Bounedjah scored both Algeria's goals while Mohamed Konate and Bertrand Traore netted for the Burkinabe, who remain top of the group on four points compared with two for Algeria.

Burkina Faso came desperately close to a smash-and-grab victory that would have seen them through to the last-16 with a guaranteed top two finish. They were under pressure for much of the match but had two VAR decisions go in their favour.
