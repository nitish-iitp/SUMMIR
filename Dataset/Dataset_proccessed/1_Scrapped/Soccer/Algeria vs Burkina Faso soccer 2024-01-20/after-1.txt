ALGERIA 2-2 BURKINA FASO: BAGHDAD BOUNEDJAH SCORES DRAMATIC LATE EQUALISER AS ALGERIA RESCUE LATE DRAW
BYCIARAN BAYNES

UPDATED 20/01/2024 AT 17:23 GMT

A dramatic late goal from Baghdad Bounedjah saw Algeria snatch a 2-2 draw in the dying minutes when Burkina Faso thought they had emerged triumphant. A penalty from Aston Villa’s Bertrand Traore looked to have given Burkina Faso the win but in added time Bounedjah, who had scored Algeria’s first equaliser earlier, scored his second to complete an astonishing game.

Baghdad Bounedjah's equaliser deep into injury time secured a draw for Algeria, denying Burkina Faso a second straight victory in the Africa Cup of Nations.
It appeared Bertrand Traore's second-half penalty had Algeria in real danger of a first-round exit from the tournament until the dramatic ending when Adam Ounas set up Bounedjah to score his second of the match.

Algeria came into the match the favourites and had more of the play, but Burkina Faso looked dangerous on the break throughout and would not have been flattered by victory.

The opening goal came just before half-time and it was a brilliant one as Abdoul Fessal Tapsoba clipped an inch-perfect diagonal ball behind the Algerian defence which Mohamed Konate met with a header that crashed into the roof of the net. Initially it was ruled offside but VAR showed the striker to be just on.
Algeria came out in the second half with added purpose and were level after six minutes when half-time substitute Youcef Belaili's half-blocked free-kick eventually found its way to Bounedjah, who coolly netted from close range.
Once more a VAR decision found in favour of the underdogs as Issa Kabore went down under the challenge of Rayan Ait-Nouri and after reviewing the sideline video, the referee awarded a spot-kick.
Substitute Traore, who came on for Konate after he received a booking, sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot and it appeared more likely they would add another as Algeria brought off stars Youcef Belaili and Riyad Mahrez - the latter who was anonymous throughout.
But Bounedjah, the tournament's top scorer with three goals, ensured Algeria are well-placed to reach the last 16 with a victory over Mauritania in their last group match.
Algeria have a solitary point from two games after drawing their first match with Angola.

TALKING POINT - ALGERIA SURVIVE TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY
There are sure to be inquests into the poor performance of Riyad Mahrez in particular, but the fretting over their star man and their coach Djamel Belmadi's call to take off their best player on the day, Youcef Belaili, will be somewhat quelled by the late equaliser. They may point to having more possession and shots on goal, but it was Burkina Faso who looked the more purposeful going forward and victory would not have flattered them. Few things get managers out of trouble more than a sublime goal poacher and Baghdad Bounedjah, who netted the winner in the AFCON final four years ago, once more came to his side's rescue. Instead of the pressure of facing elimination going into the final match, they will have the natural boost of getting more from a game than appeared likely and the knowledge that if they create chances, their number nine will finish enough to keep them a contender.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - ABDOUL FESSAL TAPSOBA (BURKINA FASO)
Tapsoba was a key reason why Burkina Faso looked so threatening on the break. On a stifling hot day, his ability to change from walking pace to bursting past the opposition midfield created openings for his side on the break. His inch-perfect ball - and Mohamed Konate's finish - was a moment of excellence which lit up an already memorable match, and was worthy of the award itself.
PLAYER RATINGS
Algeria: Mandrea 6; Atal 6, Bensebani 6, Mandi 6, Ait Nouri 6; Bentaleb 6, Feghouli 6, Zerrouki 6; Mahrez 5, Belail 7; Bouedjah 7.
Subs: Amoura 7, Ounas 7, Chaibi 6, Slimani 6.
Burkina Faso: Koffi 6; Nagalo 6, Dayo 7, E Tapsoba 6, Yago 6; Toure 6, Guira 6; Kabore 6, AF Taposoba 8*, Sangare 6; Konate 7.
Subs: Oudraogo 6, Traore 7, Djiga 6, Salou 5, Badolo 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
26' BOUNEDJAH JUST WIDE OF THE TARGET! An awful header from Dayo played in the Algerian spearhead who went round the keeper and shot just wide. Replays show Koffi got a slight touch to the effort.
45' FEGHOULI WITH A FINE EFFORT! It didn't look like he had space to squeeze in a shot, but he managed an effort which was headed for the far top corner but Koffi pushes away.
45+3' GOAL FOR BURKINA FASO - NO! It was a brilliant goal with Konate heading home a clipped diagonal ball from Tapsoba. VAR are checking now.
45+4' GOAL FOR BURKINA FASO! The goal is given! And rightfully so. Konate was just onside as the ball was played. It was a fantastic pass and deserved to stand just for that.
51' GOAL FOR ALGERIA! Bounedjah scores from close range after Belaili's free kick was half blocked and Koffi could only push away Bentaleab's shot. The Algerian number nine coolly turned away from the keeper before turning home.
52' HOW DID BOUNEDJAH MISS? Brilliant play from second half substitute Amoura who weaved down the left then clipped in a perfect ball over the keeper to the back post when Bounedjah saw the ball all the ay but headed wide at the near post.
69' PENALTY FOR BURKINA FASO! For the second consecutive game Algeria have conceded a penalty.
71' GOAL FOR BURKINA FASO! Traore takes a short run up and sends Mandrea the wrong wya from the spot.
90+5' GOAL FOR ALGERIA! Bounedjah comes to the rescue for Algeria heading home Adam Ounas' corner to break Burkina Faso hearts.
KEY STAT
16 - Burkina Faso have extended their run of scoring in consecutive games in the competition to 16 - second only to Egypt's record of 27 between 1957 and 1980.
5 - Algeria have not won in their last five AFCON games.
