END OF 2ND HALF
FULL TIME
ALGERIA GET OUT OF JAIL!
A fine game and a great advert for the tournament but Burkina Faso will be kicking themselves they did not come away with victory. Thanks for following it with us.
90+8'
TOURE GOES INTO THE BOOK
Frustration gets the better of him.
90+6'
BOUNEDJAH GOES INTO THE BOOK
A little excessive with his celebrations.
YELLOW CARD
B. BOUNEDJAH
ALGERIA

GOAL FOR ALGERIA!

GOAL
B. BOUNEDJAH
ALGERIA
90'
KABORE BURSTS THROUGH THE MIDDLE
But he is denied by a good challenge from Alt-Nouri. It is Burkina Faso who look more likely to get another.
88'
TRAORE BURSTS INTO THE BOX
But then blasts high and wide from a narrow angle.
87'
OUNAS GOES DOWN IN THE AREA
He was challenged by Yago who cleared a the second attempt, he was not far from clipping the substitute but not enough contact for a spot kick.
84'
BADOLO ON FOR TAPSOBA
84'
DJIGA ON FOR NAGALO
84'
TRIPLE SUBSTITUTION FOR BURKINA FASO!
Salou replaces Sangare.
81'
SLIMANI COMES ON FOR BENTALEB
Time for Algeria's record scorer to net a crucial equaliser.
80'
AMOURA CROSSES FROM THE LEFT FLANK
And it is met by Bounedjah at the near post but he cannot direct his header on target.
78'
CHIABI SWINGS CORNER IN
Traore boots the ball out to safety after Mandi got an initial touch on the outswinger.
74'
BELAILI ALSO COMES OFF
He was anything but anonymous. A strange call that one. Chaibi comes on for him.
74'
MAHREZ COMES OFF FOR ALGERIA
He has been pretty anonymous. He is replaced by Ounas.
71'
GOAL FOR BURKINA FASO!
Traore takes a short run up and sends Mandrea the wrong wya from the spot.
PENALTY
B. TRAORÉ
BURKINA FASO
69'
PENALTY FOR BURKINA FASO!
For the second consecutive game Algeria have conceded a penalty.
68'
REF IS CHECKING SIDELINE VIDEO
You know what this means...
66'
KABORE DOWN IN THE BOX
He seemed genuinely hurt by the challenge from Alt-Nouri. And replays show the defender got none of the ball.
64'
TRAORE COMES ON FOR KONATE
Konate had just received a yellow card and the Burkina Faso will be keen to have him available for the Angola game - and happy to have the Aston Villa striker to call upon.
