Mauritania and Angola will go one-on-one at the Stade Bouake on Saturday in matchday two of their Africa Cup of Nations Group D action, with kickoff slated for 17:00 GMT.

Tunisia vs Mali Prediction: Africa Cup of Nations Match on 20.01.2024
KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Mauritania have not won a match since they beat Madagascar 2-1 five matches ago. The subsequent matches have seen two consecutive defeats against Burkina Faso (1-2) and DR Congo (2-0) and consecutive draws against South Sudan (0-0) and Tunisia in the opening match of their Group D AFCON action (0-0).

Expert football predictions show that Mauritania’s last two matches have been goalless draws, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, they are robust and solid at the back, making it hard for the accomplished Tunisia to create and take chances. On the other hand, they have not yet shown sufficient potency in the final third to power them to the knockout stages.

Angola has been a ‘draw’ specialist, as evidenced by their five consecutive draws in their last five international outings, including their Group opener against Algeria, which ended in a 1-1 stalemate.

BET HERE

The previous four draws were all goalless stalemates. Like Mauritania, Angola have a robust defensive structure and are regimented to minimize concession of chances. However, this advantage comes at the expense of their attacking threat.

INJURY REPORT

Neither side has reported fresh injury worries in the lead-up to their Saturday clash.

PREDICTION

Football bet predictions on 22bet provide all the pre-match odds and live predictions football action after kickoff on Saturday. 

Mauritania and Angola will fight to a draw and share the points.
