Shockers, Stunners, and Stunning Results: The Thrilling Start of the AFCON Group Stage
 JANUARY 18, 2024  0 COMMENTS
  

The first round of the AFCON group stage games ended yesterday with an impeccable performance from World Cup semi-finalists, Morocco, and a stalemate between DR Congo and Zambia. Senegal and Morocco have been the most impressive teams, with 3-nil victories over their opponents.

There have been shockers and stunners in the first round of group-stage games. We’ve seen giants fall and underdogs rise and African Football fans can only be expectant of huge dramas and actions. Perhaps, you missed any of the first-round games, we’ve got you covered with the results of each AFCON group stage game:

ROUND 1 GROUP STAGE RESULTS

Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea Bissau
Nigeria 1-1 Equatorial Guinea
Egypt 2-2 Mozambique
Ghana 1-2 Cape Verde
Senegal 3-0 Gambia
Cameroon 1-1 Guinea
Burkina Faso 1-1 Mauritania
Angola 1-1 Algeria
Mali 2-0 South Africa
Namibia 1-0 Tunisia
Morocco 3-0 Tanzania
DR Congo 1-1 Zambia

From Thursday, 18th January 2024, the second round of group stage games begins with two of the biggest games of the tournament, Ivory Coast vs Nigeria and Egypt vs Ghana. Both games are likely to end up in draws, as most of these teams have surprisingly struggled in the competition.

Ghana surprisingly lost to Cape Verde and Egypt was only rescued from a loss by a stoppage-time penalty against Mozambique. Everything surrounding this fixture bespeaks a draw.

Owing to their wastefulness, Nigeria drew to Equatorial Guinea. However, should they be able to turn things around and be more clinical in front of the goal, they may put in a more assuring performance. Ivory Coast are buzzing from a win against Guinea Bissau and they’ve got the advantage of playing in front of their home fans. This could be decisive and obstructive to a Nigerian side who are desperately in search of a win to qualify for the next round. This game is also likely to end up in a draw.

Equatorial Guinea and Guinea Bissau haven’t been so impressionable. Equatorial Guinea were only lucky in their first fixture, thanks to Nigeria’s wastefulness. Except if one of the teams steps up their game, the outcome may end in a stalemate.
