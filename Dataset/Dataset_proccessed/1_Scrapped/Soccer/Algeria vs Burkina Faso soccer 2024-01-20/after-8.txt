Baghdad Bounedjah rescues Algeria against Burkina Faso
 January 20, 2024
 Alie Bittar @bittar32

Al Sadd striker Baghdad Bounedjah scored a brace as Algeria and Burkina-Faso played to a 2-2 all draw at the Stade de Bouake in their Cup of Nations match day two on Saturday.

As a result, the Stallions remain on top of Group D on four points, followed by Algeria on two points as Angola and Mauritania face off later in the day.

Baghdad Bounedjah bundles in Algeria’s leveller in the 51st minute from close range to cancel out Mohamed Konaté’s powerful header that was allowed to stand after a VAR check.

Bertrand Isidore Traoré’s 71st-minute spot-kick looked like they were on the verge of booking their Cup of Nations’ last sixteen spot – but another goal from Baghdad Bounedjah saw both teams share the spoils.

Bounedjah’s brace keeps his side’s chances of reaching the knockout phase of the Africa Cup of Nations 2023 alive.
