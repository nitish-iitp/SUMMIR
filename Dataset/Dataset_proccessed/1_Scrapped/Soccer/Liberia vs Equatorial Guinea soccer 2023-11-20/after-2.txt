Coach Keita Not Part of Lone Star Game Against Equatorial Guinea

The Liberia’s National football team, the Lone Star, head coach Ansumana Keita has been asked to stay away from the national team following Liberia’s 0-1 defeat to Malawi last Friday at the Samuel K. Doe Sports Stadium at home soil.

The decision was made by the Liberia Football Association Technical Committee on Saturday following hours of meeting with Coach Keita and his technical staff.

According to the committee that comprised Ivan Browne, former national soccer star, Anthony Laffor, Roselyn Konneh and others football stakeholders, their decision was as the result of threats on Keita’s life by fans after Friday’s disappointing defeat at home.

The angry fans disrupted the post-match press conference saying they were tired of Keita as head coach of the Liberia National Football team because of his poor run of results.

Keita has yet to win a game with the national team since taking over from Peter Butler in January.

What is more disappointing is at home Keita lost all three games played against Senegal in the African National Championship, South Africa in the AFCON qualifier and Malawi in the World Cup qualifiers.

Our source revealed that the Committee suggested that Thomas Kojo take charge of the national team but Keita refused and insisted that his deputy Cooper Sannah take charge of the team for today’s match against Equatorial Guinea.

Keita however prior to the Malawi game invited Kojo to help him technically but now to over-sea the team he is afraid that Kojo could perform well and could be given the team. Meanwhile, Coach Keita could not be reached as his mobile phones ran endlessly on several occasions.
