Watch out for this Congo player:

There is no other man from the Congo national team who can be the player to watch throughout the 90 minutes more than Silvère Ganvoula, the Congo star is one of Young Boys' most important strikers and he will want to prove it in this match by being the goal man to give his national team the win.

Watch out for this Gabon player:

In this match, the player to watch will be Gabon national team center forward and star of MLS team Los Angeles FC, Denis Bouanga. The killer of the area has been characterized by his great agility to break free and break the defensive lines, also, his great performances abroad have made him worth a name of respect as Denis Bouanga has grown a lot as a footballer and has shown it every time his name goes up on the scoreboard.

Time to make corrections

Unlike their similar team, the Congolese team cannot be so relaxed and must take this friendly match with all the seriousness in the world because they are not so stable in the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. To begin with, they lost their opening match 4-2 against the Zambian national team, then their match on day 2 was suspended, so they had no chance to get three points. After this match, they will face two more rounds of the World Cup qualifiers, against Niger and Morocco, two complicated opponents, so the margin for error is minimal.

Preparation is fundamental

In the African soccer confederation, the excitement of the African Cup of Nations is over and now, all the national teams must focus on one thing; preparing to face the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, which in fact, had already begun with the first two rounds in which Gabon did very well because in round 1 they beat Kenya 2-1 and in round 2, they beat the Burundi national team 2-0. After this match, Gabon will face Côte d'Ivoire in the continuation of the World Cup qualifiers.

The FIFA date has arrived

The FIFA date is here again with all the international emotions that it brings us every time it arrives to put the different teams of the world to dispute a victory in a soccer field and these same teams can measure themselves against different rivals from anywhere in the world to continue growing collectively and globally with a soccer without borders. Likewise, the national teams should take advantage of this break in the leagues around the world to continue with their national project, since little by little the summer is approaching and it will be full of international soccer and therefore, the national teams should be polishing things to arrive in their best version to each of these competitions.
