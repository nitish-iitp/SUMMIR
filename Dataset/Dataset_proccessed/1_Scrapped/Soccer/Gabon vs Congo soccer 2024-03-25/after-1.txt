After a tight first half of Saturday afternoon’s game against Rock Springs, Broncs freshman Ruby Hoelscher stepped up for a set piece with about 15 minutes remaining in the game.

She had been working on curling the ball with her brother, and this was the perfect opportunity to give her newly honed skill a try. She stepped a little to the right, charged toward the ball and booted it as hard as she could.

From the right side of the field, the ball curled left and tipped off the Rock Springs goaltender’s hands and into the net. The Broncs already were ahead by a goal, but Hoelscher’s allowed the team to break away for good — just as the team attempts to break away from the rest of the field this season.

Last year, Jackson won regionals and then appeared in its first-ever 4A state championship game but fell to Kelly Walsh 2-0. Poised to make another run for the title as the early No. 1 team in the state (according to WyoPreps coaches and media polls), Jackson already is off to a strong start with three wins against Lander (4-1), Evanston (6-0) and Rock Springs (4-1).

The Broncs’ total goal differential so far is 14-2.

“It’s been building, which is really what you want to see, your program getting better,” said co-coach Nate McClennen. “Mary and I are committed to what it looks like for the next five years.”

McClennen and Mary Hoelscher are taking on co-coaching roles this season and have put together a set of team values for the girls to follow: joy, intensity and teamwork. Their team’s identity will be focused on attacking and playing in opponents’ defensive third, and such was the case on Saturday.

Dealing with several injuries, including a rehabbing all-state midfielder Taya McClennen and junior forward Karoline Montes, the Broncs had to reach back into their deep JV squad for help, but the called-on girls, including center back sophomore Sita Yeomans, handled the pressure aptly. Rock Springs was Jackson’s first real challenge of the season, and the Tigers kept it interesting, but as the Broncs kept to their game plan, the game went out of reach.

“Our goal was to stay positive, which is honestly hard for me,” Ruby Hoelscher said. “But once I talk to my teammates and I realize that we’re in a good situation, I can wrap my mind around that it’s possible that we win, and we just have to keep playing how we play.”

Coaches McClennen and Hoelscher used the game to test out different systems and different players in different places, but even with the rotating roster, the Broncs got it done. Just as the freshman Hoelscher said, for the remainder of the season, this team should be in a good situation.

After the girls wrapped up, the boys’ team stepped out onto the green turf field, still surrounded by snow.

Last season, the Broncs lost in the first round of the 4A state tournament to Thunder Basin, which went on to win the title. Injuries had piled up, but with everyone healthy this year, the boys look to join the girls once more at the top of the state.

“I think we’re at the caliber where our goal is to compete for a state championship,” said head coach Matt Hoelscher. “There’s been years where I think that’s a really lofty goal, but I think that’s a realistic goal for us.”

In their three games this season, the boys’ goal differential is 29-1.

As the starting 11 were introduced, each Jackson player stepped out one at a time, giving a jovial wave to the crowd, disguising the fact that they were about to tactically dismantle their Rock Springs opponents. The Broncs had beaten Lander 9-0 earlier that week and Evanston 16-1 the day before Rock Springs.

Adding to the Hoelscher family’s already impressive day, junior Augie Hoelscher opened the scoring about 10 minutes into the game by dribbling through an entire back line of Tiger defense and finishing past the goaltender. Several minutes later, all-state forward Teddy Opler found the net from a near-impossible angle at the left goal line. Opler, who wears the orange captain’s band, now has an astounding nine goals for an average of a hat trick per game thus far.

Nearly the entire first half was played in the Broncs’ attacking third, and after senior Isaac Zarate Carrilo knocked in the team’s third goal, Jackson turned to defense for the rest of the game.

Similar to the girls’ team, the Jackson boys still are figuring out where some players are best, as they manage illnesses and injuries, but one rock-steady constant on whom they can rely is all-state senior center back Braden Hills, “a force,” as Coach Hoelscher calls him.

Hills and company held it down the rest of the way, putting together another shutout, but legs became tired throughout the second half, as Saturday was the second of back-to-back games. Freshman Finn Beninga scored the only goal of the final 40 minutes.

“When we’re moving the ball and being dynamic, we’re pretty darn good,” Matt Hoelscher said.

The two teams have outscored their opponents 43-3. The next two contests at Natrona County and No. 2-ranked Kelly Walsh will be statement games for the girls and boys, but for now the Broncs are sitting pretty headed into spring.

“The girls are positive, we’re positive, and we’re excited for a couple hard games after break,” Nate McClennen said.
