Kosovo will travel to Budapest on Tuesday to meet Hungary in an international friendly at the Puskas Arena.

The hosts got the better of Turkey in a friendly last time out, while their visitors prevailed in a trip to Armenia on Friday.

Hungary return to action at the Puskas Arena on Tuesday with the aim of making it back-to-back wins in a pair of international friendlies in March and extending a fine run of form across all competitions.

Indeed, the Magyarok have gone unbeaten in their last 13 outings, dating back to a UEFA Nations League defeat to Italy in November 2022, picking up eight wins and playing out five draws since.

That streak included a successful Euro 2024 qualifying campaign, in which Marco Rossi's team booked their place in the upcoming tournament by topping their group, collecting 18 points from eight matches with the bid culminating in a 3-1 home win over Montenegro in November, with Dominik Szoboszlai turning the game on its head with a second-half brace before Adam Nagy added a third in injury time.

Ahead of the commencement of the continental competition in June, the Magyarok returned to action for the first time in 2024 at home to Turkey in a friendly on Friday, and they extended their hot streak with a 1-0 victory in Budapest, as Szoboszlai made the only difference from the penalty spot early in the second half.

Now playing their final game before the June warm-ups and commencement of the Euro 2024 group stage in under three months, Hungary will bid to keep building momentum with a third straight win at the Puskas Arena on Tuesday.

Their visitors, meanwhile, will also aim to make it consecutive triumphs in their March international friendlies, having prevailed on their travels last week after an unsuccessful Euro 2024 qualifying bid last year.

Aiming for a first appearance at the continental tournament in their history, the Dardanet fell short, finishing fifth in their group with 11 points from 10 matches, having rounded off the bid in impressive fashion with consecutive triumphs over Andorra and Israel and a draw with Switzerland before suffering a home defeat to Belarus in the final round of fixtures.

The end of that campaign triggered a change in management, as Franco Foda stepped in to replace Primoz Gliha, and his tenure began with their first fixture of 2024 last week as the Dardanet travelled to Armenia for an international friendly.

Milot Rashica put his nation ahead in the 25th minute of that contest, and Kosovo stood strong to see out the victory in Yerevan, with their sights now set on taking an impressive scalp in Budapest on Tuesday before the beginning of the UEFA Nations League in September.

Marco Rossi has a strong Hungary squad at his disposal for Tuesday's friendly, although he is unable to call on key defender Willi Orban, who was forced to withdraw due to an injury concern picked up before their win over Turkey.

In his absence, Botond Balogh, Adam Lang and Attila Szalai should continue in a back three after their clean sheet on Friday in front of RB Leipzig stopper Peter Gulacsi.

Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai is the talisman and captain for the the Magyarok, having netted 11 goals in his 39 caps thus far, and he will likely join Roland Sallai in support of a lone striker, with Barnabas Varga again hoping to get the nod having already scored four times in his eight Hungary caps.

Kosovo should also field a similar starting XI to the one from their friendly triumph last week, with Milot Rashica bound to continue on the wing in their 4-2-3-1 shape having netted his 12th international goal in their win over Armenia.

The attack will be spearheaded by talismanic front man Vedat Muriqi, who has netted 26 goals in his 52 caps for the Dardanet, while Edon Zhegrova and Florent Muslija should again complete the forward line.

Captain and Napoli defender Amir Rrahmani was an unused substitute last time out but should come in from the outset on Tuesday, while Burnley's Arijanet Muric will continue between the sticks.


Hungary possible starting lineup:
Gulacsi; Balogh, Lang, Szalai; Nego, Nagy, Schafer, Kerkez; Sallai, Szoboszlai; Varga

Kosovo possible starting lineup:
Muric; Vojvoda, Rrahmani, Aliti, Paqarada; Loshaj, Berisha; Zhegrova, Muslija, Rashica; Muriqi



We say: Hungary 3-1 Kosovo

Hungary are certainly in a rich vein of form, and with more quality throughout their ranks and home advantage in Budapest, we back them to record another victory on Tuesday.
