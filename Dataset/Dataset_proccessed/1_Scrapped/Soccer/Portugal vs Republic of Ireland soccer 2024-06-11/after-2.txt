Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice within the space of 10 minutes, as Portugal warmed up for Euro 2024 against the Republic of Ireland.

Fired Portugal to a 3-0 lead
Portuguese talisman now has 130 international goals
WHAT HAPPENED?

The Al-Nassr forward took just five minutes in the second half to score his first of the night. Ronaldo took down Ruben Neves' long ball with finesse, completed a couple of brisk step-overs to eke out a bit of shooting space, and then unleashed an incredible left-footed shot that flew past Caoimhin Kelleher into the top corner.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Ronaldo's next goal was a sublime one-touch finish after Diogo Jota set him up on a platter following a bamboozling run down the left flank. There had been some doubt over whether the 39 year old should still be leading the line for his country at Euro 2024 and this brace will play a significant role in answering his doubters.
