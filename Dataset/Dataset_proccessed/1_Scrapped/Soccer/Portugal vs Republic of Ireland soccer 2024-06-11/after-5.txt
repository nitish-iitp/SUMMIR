The legendary forward will head into this summer's tournament in Germany with a head full of steam

Portugal ended their Euro 2024 warm-up games on a high with a comprehensive 3-0 win over a sorry Ireland side on Tuesday night.

Joao Felix put the hosts ahead with a drilled shot from inside the box after John O'Shea's side went to sleep from a corner in the 18th minute.

Ronaldo lit up the contest with a magnificent strike five minutes after the break and then clinically put away Diogo Jota's pass 10 minutes later as Roberto Martinez's men headed off to the Euros in style.

GOAL rates Portugal's players from Estadio Municipal de Aveiro...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Diogo Costa (6/10):

Had virtually nothing to do as Ireland were run ragged. Bigger tests lie ahead for the goalkeeper.

Diogo Dalot (7/10):

Carried on his strong form for United with Portugal. The 25-year-old is coming into his own right now

Adrien Silva (7/10):

Like his keeper team-mate, wasn't really troubled apart from a couple of pressing runs from Adam Idah and Sammie Szmodics.

Pepe (7/10):

It almost beggars belief that this man is still a huge asset for FC Porto and his country at the grand old age of 41. Was unflappable against the Irish.

Goncalo Inacio (7/10):

Kept Ireland's attack at arm's length and perhaps should have scored at the other end from Bruno Fernandes' pinpoint cross in the first half..

Joao Cancelo (6/10):

Was not quite as effective as some of his team-mates in dealing with Ireland's subpar attack. Not quite at top gear tonight.

Midfield

Bruno Fernandes (9/10):

The Manchester United man may be playing the best football of his career. His passing is crisp, his vision is remarkable, and he looks hungry for goals. Although he didn't get one against Ireland, the midfielder ran the show and certainly deserved a goal.

Joao Neves (7/10):

The 19-year-old did not grab the headlines in the same way Fernandes did but quietly went about his work well.

Joao Felix (8/10):

Looked sharp and was a threat during his first-half display. Took his goal with real class and is likely to start for Portugal in the Euros going off that display.

Attack

Cristiano Ronaldo (9/10):

Some critics believe the 39-year-old should not be starting games for Portugal these days but this display showed the veteran can really hurt opposition defences. Took his two goals in excellent fashion and could have had more. A statement outing.

Rafael Leao (8/10):

Ireland didn't really know what to do with the AC Milan star. His pace and trickery caused them lots of problems; he is a great option for Portugal to have but perhaps he needs to add some goals to his game internationally.

Subs & Manager

Nelson Semedo (7/10):

Linked up nicely on the right with Ronaldo and wasn't far away from getting on the scoresheet himself.

Danilo Pereira (7/10):

Looked very comfortable at the back when he came on at the break for Pepe.

Ruben Neves (8/10):

Delivered a sumptuous long ball to Ronaldo, who took his first goal of the night in stunning style. Showed off his impressive array of passing, too.

Diogo Jota (7/10):

Played a delightful outside of the boot pass to Ronaldo inside the box, before the 39-year-old dispatched his second goal with aplomb.

Nuno Mendes (6/10):

Didn't really make much of an impact when introduced as the game was already won.

Matheus Nunes (N/A):

Not on for long at all.

Roberto Martinez (8/10):

His Portugal side managed to outmanoeuvre Ireland's high press time and time again as he won the tactical battle with managerial counterpart John O'Shea. His five, second-half substitutes added even more attacking threat for the hosts, with the result stretching his run as manager to 13 wins and two losses from 15 games.
