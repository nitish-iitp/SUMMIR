Training of the Stallions of Burkina Faso

At the top of its group, Egypt did not tremble against Burkina Faso and logically won (2-1) in these qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, this Thursday in Cairo. The Pharaohs distanced themselves thanks to an express double from Trezeguet (3rd, 8th) while Traoré (57th) reduced the gap to the score for the Stallions. Each team therefore had its half-time in this game. In the 35th minute, the referee was generous in not whistling a penalty for Egypt after a foul by goalkeeper Kilian Nikiéma.

The match was played in a packed stadium. Tickets had sold out 48 hours before the match. Even before the start of hostilities, a question was on the lips of some Egyptians. It was about the 3 absentees (Bertrand Traoré, Issoufou Dayo and Hervé Koffi), who apparently are the best known and the most feared. Their absences seem to delight the Egyptian supporters. No matter, this important match for both countries begins with a 4-4-2 concocted by Brama Traoré. But, Steeve Yago, the captain for the evening, and his teammates will only last 3 minutes.

In the standings, Egypt occupies the first place in Group A thanks to its three victories in as many outings. Burkina Faso is 3rd with 4 points, one unit behind Guinea-Bissau, 2nd. The Stallions' next outing is scheduled for June 10, 2024 against Sierra Leone in Mali.
