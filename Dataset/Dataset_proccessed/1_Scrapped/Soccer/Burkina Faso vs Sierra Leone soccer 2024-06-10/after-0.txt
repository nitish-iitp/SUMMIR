Sierra Leone head coach Amidu Karim is brimming with confidence ahead of their crucial World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso on Monday.

Speaking after their final training session, Karim revealed the team is highly motivated and prepared to face their strong opponents at the Stade du 26 Mars.

While Karim kept the names and positions of the two changes to the starting lineup under wraps for tactical reasons, he emphasized their readiness for the challenge.

Burkina Faso, meanwhile, come into the match desperate to stop their own slump. The Stallions have lost their last five games across all competitions, including a recent defeat to Egypt in the qualifiers. Their leaky defense has been a major concern, conceding 10 goals in those five matches.

Despite their recent struggles, Burkina Faso remain a formidable opponent. They will be eager to bounce back and climb the Group A standings, currently sitting just one place above Sierra Leone on goal difference.

This encounter promises to be a tense battle between two teams desperate for points. Sierra Leone will be hoping to continue their newfound momentum, while Burkina Faso will be determined to end their losing streak.
