Sierra Leone’s head coach Karim reflects on victory over Djibouti
 June 6, 2024

Sierra Leone’s head coach, Amidu Karim, expressed his satisfaction with the team’s 2-1 win against the Sharks of Djibouti in their match-day three 2026 World Cup qualifier in Morocco – on Wednesday.

It was his first win in the group. The victory marks a significant step in Sierra Leone’s quest to secure a spot in the global tournament. However, Karim also urged his players to remember that African football is rapidly improving.

Following their departure from Morocco, the team is set to continue their preparations for the upcoming match against the Les Étalons of Burkina Faso in Bamako, Mali, on Monday.

Karim’s squad is set to receive a substantial boost with the acquisition of Huddersfield Town’s attacker, Josh Koroma. His arrival is poised to provide essential momentum for the team as they gear up for a challenging match against Burkina Faso.

“I was pleased with the victory as it was much-needed. However, as I’ve always said, teams in African football are rapidly improving,” Karim told Football Sierra Leone.

“I understand that fans were expecting more goals from the team, but the determination from the players was evident. Djibouti proved to be a tough side, but we fought back and secured the win.

“In today’s African football landscape, there are no underdogs. Djibouti’s recent performance exemplifies this shift. As we prepare to face Burkina Faso, we recognize the need for a revised game plan, and we are committed to beginning our preparations as soon as we arrive in Mali.”
