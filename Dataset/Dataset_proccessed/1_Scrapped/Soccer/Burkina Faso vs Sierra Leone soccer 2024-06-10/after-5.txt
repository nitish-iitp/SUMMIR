 FSL News

Abdul Jarju Kabia, Hapoel Kfar Saba defender, has been reinstated to the back four for the match day four tie against Burkina Faso. He joined Curtis Davies, Emmanuel Samadia, and skipper Osman Kakay in the defensive lineup.

Defender J Kabia was previously suspended for the Djibouti game but is now back in action.

In a tactical change, Abu Dumbuya has replaced Mustapha Bundu, and Daniel Kanu has come on for Amadou Bakayoko in the attack for Sierra Leone. Defender J Kabia in for midfielder Mahamed Kabia.

Davies, a seasoned player who first represented the England under-21 team in 2006, will make his second international appearance for Sierra Leone against the Stallions of Burkina Faso after scoring his first international goal against Djibouti.

The kickoff at the Stade du 26 Mars is at 19:48 as both West Africans meet for the second time in their history.

Attacker Joshua Abdulai Koroma, who plays as a forward for EFL League One club Huddersfield Town, is named on the bench.

Coach Karim has stressed the crucial importance of securing a victory for qualification and has spoken highly of the players’ preparedness to showcase their best performance.

The nine group winners will automatically qualify for the FIFA World Cup 26™. The four best runners-up will then compete for one spot in the FIFA Play-Off Tournament.
