In a thrilling World Cup Qualifier match, Sierra Leone’s Leone Stars staged a remarkable comeback against Burkina Faso, securing a dramatic 2-2 draw on Monday.

The first half saw Burkina Faso dominate, scoring two quick goals in quick succession. Dango Outtara capitalized on a defensive error in the 41st minute, putting his team ahead. Just before halftime, Lassina Traore doubled their lead, sending the Stallions into the break with a seemingly comfortable advantage.

However, the Leone Stars refused to give up. The tide began to turn in the 58th minute when Augustus Kargbo found the net from a corner kick. The goal reignited Sierra Leone’s fighting spirit, and they pushed relentlessly for an equalizer. Their efforts paid off in the 87th minute when Amadou Bakayoko unleashed a powerful shot from outside the area, leaving the Burkina Faso goalkeeper with no chance.

Congratulations to my honourable Leone Stars players and the entire nation. I appreciate your efforts yesterday regardless of the outcome of the game. Guys, your performance was good in the second half of the play.

Fellow citizens, let’s put our differences aside and support our guys no matter what happens, we remain Sierra Leoneans.
