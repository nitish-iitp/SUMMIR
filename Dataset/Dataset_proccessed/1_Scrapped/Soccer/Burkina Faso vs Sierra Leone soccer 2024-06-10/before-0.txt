Kakay led coach Karim’s side to a well-deserved win against Djibouti on match-day three of their 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Morocco.

Securing a second win at the Stade du 26 Mars would significantly enhance the Leone Stars’ chances of earning their first-ever World Cup appearance.

“It was our first win in the group, a major milestone in Sierra Leone’s journey to qualify for the global tournament. We are delighted to have secured our first win in the group.

The team performed well, and while no game is easy, our main objective was to secure the result, which will boost our confidence for Monday,” Kakay shared.

Following their departure from Morocco, the team is focused on diligently preparing for the upcoming match against Burkina Faso in Bamako, Mali on Monday.”

After three matches in the group stage, Egypt leads with 9 points, Guinea-Bissau has 5 points after drawing with Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone have 4 points each, and Ethiopia is on 2. In contrast, Djibouti has yet to earn a point.
