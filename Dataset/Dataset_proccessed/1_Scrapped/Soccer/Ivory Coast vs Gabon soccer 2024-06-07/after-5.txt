The sides meet after over six years

Kenya and Burundi lock horns at the Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi on Friday in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Both sides have accumulated three points each from two games and will be looking to remain on the coattails of the top two.

Ranked 107th in the world, Kenya began their campaign with a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Gabon, followed by a 5-0 thrashing of Seychelles that got their qualification campaign up and running.

The Harambee Stars added more wind to their sails with two friendly victories in March this year, a 4-0 beating of Malawi and a 3-1 defeat of Zimbabwe. That's three wins in a row for the East African side, who will look to translate that form into positive results in this month's double-header against Burundi and table-toppers Ivory Coast.

Meanwhile, Burundi have gone in the opposite direction. Although the side began their qualifiers with a 3-2 defeat of Gambia, they lost 2-1 to Gabon in the next. This year, the Swallows have failed to win any of their three friendly games, losing twice before a goalless stalemate.
