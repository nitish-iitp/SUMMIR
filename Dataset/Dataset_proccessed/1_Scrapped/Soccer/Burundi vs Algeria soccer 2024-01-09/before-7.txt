Former African champions, Algeria defeated Togo 3-0 in a friendly match preparatory to the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) at the Stade de Kegue, Lome, Togo on Friday.

A brace from Ramy Bensebaini lifted the Desert Foxes to a comfortable win over their host.

The 2019 AFCON winners opened the scoring thanks to Bensebaini in the 20th minute of play.

Ten minutes into the second half, Islam Slimani doubled the lead for the Fennecs Foxes.

Bensebaini scored his second goal of the encounter in the 70th minute to complete the scoring for the Greens.

Algeria is using the friendly match to prepare for this month’s AFCON taking place from January 13 to February 11 in Cote d’Ivoire.

Up next for the Djamel Belmadi side is a clash with Burundi on January 9, 2024.

They will face Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Angola in Group D at the Buake centre.

Togo on the other hand didn’t qualify for the tournament but will see the game as a testing one ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers in a tough group that have Senegal, Sudan, DR Congo, Mauritania, and South Sudan.
