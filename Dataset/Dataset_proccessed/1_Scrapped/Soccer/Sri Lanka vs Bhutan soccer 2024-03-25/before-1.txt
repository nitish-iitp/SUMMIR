•Width adjustable to clear external weights or extremely wide forends.

•Made from PET-CF to handle any temps 

•Free replacement warranty. If it breaks or fails you in any way I will send you a new one and will thank you for your feedback.

Call or text me at 4804678090 to place an order.

Thanks

Thanks guys.

I’m sending out two with every order while my hardware lasts.

If you get two in the mail please give me some honest feedback on them, you won’t hurt my feelings, I want to improve them any way I can. I’m actually having a lot of fun doing this for some reason. I’m still trying to break one of prototypes and can’t . My fingers hurt from tightening the damn knob 500x today.


I have some neat upgrades I’m working on so we’ll see how those go.

They’re now PET-cf. The 50mm long guide rods are 304stainless, the springs are 304 stainless, the 1/4x20 anchor is brass, and the steel clamp-bolt is 40mm long(so they reach all the way through the mount to the other side of the clamp).

The first batch of mounts are going out today so by end of the week hopefully some guys will have them in-hand and be able to give some independent reviews. Im sending free ones out with these orders so guys can feel free to torture test one.

Is the spring in a simple counter bore placed over the guide rod? That's a good simple fix.

Edited due to design change:
The springs are 40mm long, 4mm diameter, and have .5mm diameter wire. I planned to need to have them sleeve over steel rods but they absolutely don’t need to after increasing the spring size.

From original post: I need to get a new computer now, and play with some different materials. With any luck, and I have none with computers, I’ll be having fun with it again in a week or two tops.

New computer already shipped, various new PET-CF and PAHT-CF filaments are on the way to try, second printer is on the way, and I’ve ordered more hardware from multiple sources to combat the shortage/delays.

Oh and also figured out how to make them all width adjustable to clear external weights. I’m embarrassed I didn’t think of it before. The design is painfully simple I just didn’t think the printers would be able to do it, but they do it well.

These should be looking good in a couple weeks.

Thanks again

Shot with mine all day. Couldn't be happier, simple design. Any improvement made going forward is all the better.

Got a chance to test it this morning. Excellent product, went on easy and stayed on. Screw never backed off and Garmin picked up all the shots just fine. Ultra light weight and seemed very solid made. Being able to still attach the bipod is a plus if you're lending it to someone without a arca rail. Totally worth the price even if I had received 1 and not 2.

The mounts are now width adjustable and should clear any stock or chassis.
The new material is working great.
Some other improvements made too.

The Garmin came in clutch this weekend for a buddy at a match whose barrel is now shot out. He noticed it two stages in and chronod while shooting the next stage. His velocity had dropped 60fps. After seeing that, he adjusted and it was fixed for the rest of the day.

This Garmin chrono and these mounts have been fun. Very nice additions to my kit.

Looks like the new version will start shipping next week! They’re now width adjustable to clear wide forends or chassis with forend weights. Everything has been improved, even the material it’s made from.

$38 shipped.

Shoot me a text, or message me on here, to order. 4804678090
I can run cards while I’m at the shop(add 2.9% for cards), but prefer to take Venmo, or Zelle for payment. You can even send a check and I’ll ship before getting it.

To anyone who ordered the first version mount, shoot me a text or message me to get this new version sent to you free. I want you to have the newer version.

Thanks very much!
Keith

The guide rods are 50% larger in diameter, even though I couldn’t bend the old size when I tried. The 1/4x20 anchor for the Garmin tripod has 3x the surface area now, to bond to the mount better. The springs are 50% larger, even though the smaller ones applied enough spring pressure to reliably open it. And the new material is PET with 15% carbon fibers.

My phones camera makes them look a little beat up but they look fine in person. I swear this camera will make any contrast stand out more than it does to the naked eye 

Like I said they look the same, but everything is improved and these things really are overkill.
The width adjustment gives about 3/4” of side to side adjustment, but it holds the garmin tight and secure in any position along that adjustment range.
I always keep my Garmin on the mount, since the mount can connect to the rifle or tripod.

Have I sent you the new version?

Next change that’s planned is larger clamp-bolt knobs.

Don’t be afraid to put some force into these guys, the D ring that holds the Garmin on and clamp bolt… make em tight, you won’t hurt it.

I found some slightly larger thumbwheel bolts that look identical. I’ll be making small changes and improving these any way I can, as I get feedback, and as I use it more myself.

On Amazon there’s a variety of picatinny to ARCA adapters available from $22 to $39.

To keep these Garmin mounts as cheap as they are, I can’t offer multiple variations. Picatinny guys might consider a way to run ARCA hardware on their rifle.

Used the newest version today attached to my MDT ACC and XLR envy pro, as well as with the tripod attached on a rifle without the Arca rail.

The new version is a large improvement over the original. Fit over the weights on my envy pro and I like the spring loaded clamp.

It was so nice to be able to get chrono data while doing barricade practice so I wasn’t wasting ammo.

Well done Keith and thank you for the great product and service!
