SHARE

Malawi Under-21 National Netball Team Coach Christina Mkwanda has called for early preparations, having qualified for the 2025 Netball World Youth Cup finals in Gibraltar.

The junior Queens finished second behind hosts South Africa during continental qualifiers in Pretoria.

Zambia sealed the last slot, having edged out Zimbabwe in a third-fourth place play-off.

Mkwanda said the team has potential to do well at the tournament.

“We need to prepare thoroughly and also play friendly matches before the World Cup finals,” she said.

Netball Association of Malawi General Secretary Isaac Chimwala promised to provide resources to the junior Queens before the World Cup finals.

“This team was in camp for three weeks. We have a year and some months to prepare,” he said.

During the qualifiers, Stella Matelezi and Shabel Bengo were some of the junior Queens’ outstanding performances.
