Niger and Ghana square off in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Monday

Niger and Ghana return to action in Group F of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they lock horns at the Stade Municipal de Berkane on Monday. Both sides head into the game off the back of disappointing opening-day defeats and will be looking to bounce back.

Niger were denied a dream start to their quest for a return to the AFCON as they fell to a 1-0 loss against Sudan in the Group F curtain-raiser last Wednesday. Former Shrewsbury Town man Abo Eisa came up clutch for Sudan as he netted six minutes into the second half to fire them to all three points.

Niger, whose last AFCON appearance came in South Africa back in 2013, have lost their three games across all competitions in 2024, conceding four goals and scoring just once so far.

Like Niger, Ghana suffered a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Angola in their Group F opener at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on Thursday.

The Black Stars were guilty of a lack of cutting edge in front of goal as Milson struck in the third minute of stoppage time to hand Angola a famous victory in Kumasi.

Having crashed out of the 2023 AFCON in the group stages, Ghana will look to bounce back on Monday as they eye an 11th straight appearance at the continental showpiece since missing out in 2004.

Niger vs Ghana Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
Ghana have been utterly dominant in the history of this fixture, having won 11 of the last 14 meetings between the two nations.
Niger have picked up just two wins in that time, while both sides have settled for a share of the spoils on two occasions.
Ghana have failed to win their last 14 matches on their travels, losing eight and claiming six draws since December 2022.
Niger have lost eight of their last nine competitive games, with a 2-1 victory over Zambia in November 2023 being the exception.
Niger vs Ghana Prediction

The last five meetings between Niger and Ghana have seen a combined 16 goals scored and we expect another action-packed contest at the Stade Municipal de Berkane.

While the Black Stars have struggled for results away from home, they boast the firepower needed to get the job done here and we are backing them to secure all three points.

Prediction: Niger 1-2 Ghana
