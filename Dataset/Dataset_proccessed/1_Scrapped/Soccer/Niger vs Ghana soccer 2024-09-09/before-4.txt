Black Stars lost to Angola

The Black Stars have arrived in Morocco ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Niger on Monday, September 9, 2024.

A team of 23 players and members of the technical bench touched down in Oudja in the early hours of Saturday morning for the second Group C game.

Meanwhile, winger Joseph Paintsil could not travel with the team due to passport issues and will not be available for the game against Niger.

The Black Stars will be hoping to recover from the defeat to Angola in Kumasi by beating the Menas of Niger and getting their qualifying campaign back on track.

The team will hold its first training at the RS Berkane Stadium on Saturday as preparations begin in the North African country for Niger's home game.

The 23 players who travelled to Morocco are Lawrence Ati-Zigi, Joseph Wollacott, Frederick Asare, Alidu Seidu, Tariq Lamptey, Jerome Opoku, Mohammed Salisu, Abdul Mumin, Abdul Fatawu Issahaku, Thomas Partey, Antoine Semenyo, Brandon Thomas-Asante, Ebenezer Annan, Jonas Adjetey, Jordan Ayew, Elisha Owusu, Ibrahim Osman, Inaki Williams, Kingsley Schindler, Majeed Ashimeru, Abu Francis, Forson Amankwah, and Mohammed Kudus.
