Coach Otto Addo has made two changes to the starting line-up for this afternoon’s Africa Cup of Nations Group F qualifier against Niger in Berkane. Majeed Ashimeru and Inaki Williams have been selected in place of Elisha Owusu and Jordan Ayew.

The backline is unchanged – Tariq Lamptey, Alidu Seidu will play as full backs with Salisu Mohammed and Abdul Mumin set to partner in Central defense.

Captain Thomas Partey will lead the side from the heart of the pitch alongside Majeed Ashimreu and Mohammed Kudus while Abdul Fatawu Issahaku, Antoine Semenyo and Inaki Williams operate in the front three.

The Black Stars are in search of a win to get their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign back on track after the defeat to Angola on Thursday.

The game is scheduled for 16H00 Hrs. Kick-Off at the Municipal Stadium in Berkane on Monday, September 9, 2024.
