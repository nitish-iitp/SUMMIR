Black Stars winger Joseph Paintsil has withdrawn from Ghana’s squad ahead of their crucial 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Niger in Morocco.

Paintsil, who plays for Los Angeles Galaxy, encountered passport issues that prevented him from traveling with the team to Morocco. His absence is a significant blow to the team as they prepare for the important match scheduled for Monday, September 9, 2024.

The Ghana Football Association (GFA) confirmed Paintsil’s withdrawal in an official statement. “Twenty-three players made the trip after Joseph Paintsil pulled out due to passport issues.

The Los Angeles Galaxy forward has been left in Accra to sort out his passport issues before returning to the United States to join his club,” the statement read.

Paintsil’s withdrawal comes at a critical time for the Black Stars, who are looking to bounce back from a recent defeat. The team is focused on their next challenge, facing Niger in the second round of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers.

The match will take place at the RS Berkane Stadium on Monday, September 9, 2024. The team is determined to secure a victory despite the setback of losing one of their key players.

As the team prepares for the match, all eyes will be on how they adapt to this unexpected challenge. The Black Stars have a history of overcoming adversity, and supporters are hopeful that they will rise to the occasion once again.

The outcome of the game will be closely watched by fans and analysts, eager to see how the team performs against Niger. The match against Niger is seen as a critical test for the Black Stars, who need a win to keep their qualification hopes alive.
