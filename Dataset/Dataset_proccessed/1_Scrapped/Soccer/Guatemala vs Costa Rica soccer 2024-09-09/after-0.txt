Costa Rica Set for Showdown Against Guatemala in CONCACAF Nations League: Can Los Ticos Keep Their Winning Streak Alive?
written by Admin 2024/09/09

After Friday’s commanding 3-0 victory over Guadeloupe, Costa Rica now faces a tougher challenge as they head to Guatemala City to take on Guatemala in the next round of the CONCACAF Nations League. Both teams are entering the game with a 100% record in the competition, but only one will walk away with the top spot in the group after this highly anticipated clash. The stakes are high, and Costa Rica will need to be at their best to overcome a motivated Guatemalan side in their own backyard.

Guatemala: A Proud but Complex Footballing History

Guatemala, the most populous country in Central America with 18 million inhabitants, has always been considered a sleeping giant in CONCACAF football. Despite a mixed year in 2024, with four wins, four losses, and three draws in 11 matches, Los Chapines still possess a roster filled with quality players capable of giving any team a run for their money.

Key players for Guatemala include goalkeeper Nicholas Hagen, who currently plays for Columbus Crew in the MLS, and defender Aaron Herrera, a standout for D.C. United. However, the biggest threat to Costa Rica’s defense will likely be striker Rubio Rubin, a former USA international who now plays for Querétaro in Mexico. Rubin opened the scoring for Guatemala in their 3-1 win over Martinique last week and boasts an impressive 10 goals in 24 international appearances.

Another player Costa Rica’s backline will need to keep an eye on is Oscar Santis, the tricky winger from Dinamo Tbilisi. Santis’ ability to create dangerous opportunities down the wing will keep the Costa Rican defense on its toes throughout the match.

For fans of Costa Rican club football, a few familiar faces will line up for Guatemala as well. Rodrigo Saravia of A.D. Municipal Pérez Zeledón and Darwin Lom of C.S. Cartaginés—teammates of Costa Rica’s reserve goalkeeper Kevin Briceño—will feature in the Guatemalan squad, adding an extra layer of intrigue to this Central American showdown.

The Tena Effect: Discipline and Stability

Since Mexican coach Luis Fernando Tena took over as head coach of Guatemala in 2021, he’s brought much-needed stability and discipline to a national team that was banned from international football between 2016 and 2018 due to governance issues within the Guatemalan Football Federation. Tena’s emphasis on defensive organization, tactical discipline, and a cohesive team structure has helped Guatemala achieve a respectable 16 wins out of 39 games under his leadership.

Playing at the Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores has been a significant advantage for Guatemala. The 26,000-seater stadium in Guatemala City has become something of a fortress for Los Chapines, who have never lost a Nations League game on home turf. In fact, they’ve only conceded one goal at home in the competition—a 1-1 draw against Panama in September 2023. Costa Rica can expect a hostile and intense atmosphere, with Guatemala’s passionate supporters looking to spur their team to victory.

Costa Rica: Maintaining Momentum After Guadeloupe Win

For Costa Rica, interim coach Claudio Vivas has a pleasant selection headache after the 3-0 win over Guadeloupe. Forward Warren Madrigal impressed with a goal to seal the victory, and he’ll be pushing for a starting spot. Meanwhile, midfielder Brandon Aguilera and striker Manfred Ugalde, two key figures in Costa Rica’s national setup, will also be hoping to break into the starting 11.

One player who won’t make the trip to Guatemala is right-back Haxzel Quirós, who suffered a tear in his right thigh. Gerald Taylor is expected to step in as his replacement. Winger Kenneth Vargas is also a doubt, leaving Vivas with a few important decisions to make as he looks to field the strongest possible team.

Despite playing away from home, Costa Rica is still the favorite going into this matchup. Ranked 58 spots higher than Guatemala in the FIFA World Rankings, Los Ticos are expected to walk away with all three points, although history shows that this fixture can be unpredictable.

Head-to-Head History and Recent Encounters

Costa Rica and Guatemala have faced off 64 times since their first meeting in 1921. Costa Rica holds the advantage with 32 wins, compared to Guatemala’s 17, while 15 matches have ended in draws. However, recent history is not in Costa Rica’s favor—Guatemala has won the last two encounters between these sides, each by a 1-0 scoreline. The most recent victory came in June of last year, so there’s no doubt that Costa Rica will be out for revenge this time around.

Predicted Costa Rica Starting Lineup

Here’s a look at how Costa Rica might line up for this crucial CONCACAF Nations League fixture:

GK: Sequeira
DEF: Mitchell, Vargas, Calvo (C), Taylor
MID: Aguilera, Brenes, Lassiter
FOR: Alcocer, Ugalde, Madrigal

With this lineup, Costa Rica will be looking to control the game early and exploit Guatemala’s defense through the pace and creativity of their forward players.

The Importance of Victory

Winning this match is about more than just maintaining a perfect record in the Nations League. For Costa Rica, it’s an opportunity to assert their dominance in the region and build momentum ahead of future international tournaments. A victory over Guatemala would also erase the bitter memory of last year’s defeat and prove that Los Ticos are still a force to be reckoned with in Central American football.

For Guatemala, a win would mark a significant milestone in their resurgence under coach Luis Fernando Tena. With a passionate home crowd behind them, they’ll be doing everything in their power to continue their unbeaten run at the Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores and send a message to the rest of CONCACAF.

Kick-Off Details

The match kicks off tonight at 20:00 CDT (20:00 UTC−6) at the Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores in Guatemala City. Whether you’re tuning in for the tactical battle, the electric atmosphere, or just to see some of Central America’s finest footballing talent, this is one game you won’t want to miss.

Are You Ready for the Showdown?

With both teams looking to keep their perfect Nations League records intact, this is set to be a thrilling contest. Can Costa Rica overcome the hostile environment and exact revenge for last year’s defeat? Or will Guatemala continue their home dominance and frustrate their higher-ranked rivals? Only time will tell.
