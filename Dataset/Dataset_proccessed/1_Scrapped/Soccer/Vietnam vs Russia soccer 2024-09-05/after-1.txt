World press predicts the result of the match between Vietnam and Russia
Dan Tri Newspaper
September 5, 2024
(Dan Tri) – Many newspapers around the world have predicted the result of the match between Vietnam and Russia at 20:00 p.m. on 5/9 at My Dinh Stadium.
At 20:00 on 5/9, the Vietnamese team will have a friendly match with a very strong opponent, the Russian team, at My Dinh Stadium. On the FIFA rankings, the Vietnamese team is only ranked 115, which is far behind Russia (ranked 33).

Fans understand the difficulties that coach Kim Sang Sik and his team are about to face, but still believe in the team's ability to create miracles.

Before this match, many newspapers on world also tilted the prediction towards the possibility of the Russian team winning. Sportskeeda (India) commented: “The Vietnamese team is ranked 115 in the world. They are going through an extremely difficult period in the year 2024 when they lost to 7/8 in the most recent match. The only positive result was the victory of 3-2 against the Philippines in the World Cup qualifiers.

With the V-League about to start and the AFF Cup 2024 set to take place at the end of the year, the Vietnamese team wants to create psychological momentum with two wins at home.

Coach Kim Sang Sik has called up 26 players to prepare for the two matches against Russia and Thailand. Notably, striker Tien Linh, who has scored 20 goals in 46 matches for the Vietnamese team, is included.

Meanwhile, Russia will not be allowed to play in an official match from 2022. They have been playing well recently, winning 4-0 against Serbia and 4-0 against Belarus in friendly matches. Before that, late last year, Russia defeated Cuba 8-0.

This is the first time the two teams have met in an official match. But it is clear that the Russian team is superior to the Vietnamese team. Coach Kim Sang Sik's team will find it difficult to escape from a series of bad performances.

Sportskeeda predicts that the Vietnamese team will lose 0-3 to Russia.

Football Predictions predicts: “We believe that Russia are superior to Vietnam. They can aim for an easy victory and a clean sheet against Vietnam. Coach Kim Sang Sik’s team is having problems in attack.”

Football Predictions predicts Vietnam will lose 0-2 to Russia.

Nobartv (Indonesia) newspaper believes that the Vietnamese team is not good enough to compete with European-level teams like Russia. They predict that coach Kim Sang Sik will field a 4-4-2 formation with Tien Linh and Phan Van Duc playing the highest.

Regarding the match result, Nobartv newspaper predicted that the Vietnamese team would lose 1-2 to Russia.

Another Indonesian newspaper, Bola, assessed that the Vietnamese team is still on the journey to regain its strength. They have not really stabilized under coach Kim Sang Sik. Meanwhile, Russia is stable with a force that mostly plays football domestically. A special note is that Russia did not concede a goal in the recent 4/5 matches.

Bola newspaper predicts that the Vietnamese team will lose 1-3 to Russia.
