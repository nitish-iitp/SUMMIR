We need to keep the conversation going about how universities across Canada help to drive and diversify our regional economies, particularly those in smaller urban centres. Federal investments in research, scholarship and creativity create quick wins for faculty and students, as well as local businesses, industry, and communities.

Pleased to have shared the perspectives of the Alliance of Canadian Comprehensive Research Universities (ACCRU) last week for the House of Commons Standing Committee on Science and Research as a witness for the study on the distribution of federal government funding among Canada's post-secondary institutions. We have an opportunity to chart a new course that results in a research ecosystem that is more inclusive, innovative, and impactful for all of Canada's post-secondary institutions.

Dr Tao Lei, Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Sciences and Policy Studies, has been honoured with the prestigious William E. Mosher and Frederick C. Mosher Award for his exceptional contribution to the field. The award recognises his co-authored article entitled ‘Advancing the Frontiers of Genomic Public Administration: From Genetics to Administrative Attitudes, Behaviors, and Practices’.   

The article was selected as the best academic article of 2023 in Public Administration Review, a top 5%-ranked journal in its field. This research proposes a new research sub-field, Genomic Public Administration, with the aim of bridging behavioural genetics and public administration research.   

This is the first time an Asian scholar has received this award.

UNE's Professor Yihong Du has received the most prestigious scientific award for excellence in Australia, being named as a 2024 Australian Laureate Fellow by the Australian Research Council (ARC).

This fellowship is awarded to only 17 world-class researchers each year and means "that many of my ambitious research plans can now become possible,” says Prof Du, the first UNE researcher to receive this competitive accolade. 

“This achievement has been built upon the strong support I’ve received from UNE leadership teams and colleagues over many years.”

With the help of $2.45 million in ARC funding over 5 years, Prof Du will undertake a project to develop new mathematical theories that will improve our knowledge of complex environmental concerns, such as ecological invasion and the spread of disease.

Not only will this help us better predict spread, but it will significantly improve our ability to control diseases that could have catastrophic impacts on health and biosecurity. 

Our story about this impressive honour, and Prof Du's thoughts on it, via the link in comments.

ERA Chair in Science and Innovation Policy

The Chair and his group will aim to create significant impact in Cyprus, sharing expertise and research policy advice

How should research be assessed? Scholars across disciplines have been trying to revolutionize research assessment (see DORA and CoARA statements) by focusing on qualitative criteria.  Critics of this movement argue that misuses of scientometric indicators require the involvement of quantitative experts, rather than reducing the role of such indicators. 

In September 4-5 of 2024 SInnoPSis together with TWIN4MERIT are organizing its second conference at University of Cyprus, focusing on research assessment.  An active debate about the reform initiatives will take place with members from CoARA and the International Society for Scientometrics and Infometrics.

If you want to know more about Lepton Annihiliations and why they produce High-Energy  Gamma Rays, visit massquerade.com where you will learn that ALL Leptons are composed of TWO Photons each.  Photons are not formed at the site of collisions, they are merely released. This is the Heart of Mass'Querade: the Theory of Everything. Don't miss it.

MBIE has announced the Science System Advisory Group, which will develop a set of evidence-based recommendations for the future of the science, innovation, and technology system. MBIE has highlighted the members' fields of expertise. We all want our area of interest to be represented, so let's take a high-level look at the subject/field representation.

Biology x3
Health x3
Food x1
Te Ao Māori x1
Innovation x1 

As a physical scientist, I clearly don't see anyone in my colleagues corner. However, I also see zero representation for many of Aotearoa's critical needs and global expertise. 
• Environmental Science and Conservation ZERO
• Agriculture and Forestry ZERO
• Climate Change and Sustainability ZERO
• Renewable Energy and Clean Tech ZERO
• Data Science, AI, IT and Cybersecurity ZERO
• Earth Sciences, Geology, Volcanology, Sysmology ZERO
• Physics, Meteorology, Math, Oceanography ZERO
• Economics ZERO
• Emergency Management and Disaster Resilience ZERO

Sigh. I just hope that the memberships highlighted backgrounds matter not and their systems insight is equitably transformative.

Shedding light on the annual ERC review - a proof of scientific excellence & academic prestige 🎓 

1) 20% of projects achieved groundbreaking scientific results and 58% contributed to major advances
2) Over 70% yielding cross-disciplinary results, fostering collaborations between once-separate research fields
3) Institutions with few ERC grants are significant contributors to excellent scientific results
4) Nearly half of the projects made impact beyond scientific knowledge
5) ERC-funded projects have led to diverse commercial products and startups
6) ERC-funded projects have provided scientific knowledge that sparked global debates on issues like social and economic inequality, immigration, food scarcity, fertility patterns, and climate change
