In just over 48 hours, TI13 will kick off in Copenhagen with 16 of the best teams competing for the lion's share of the prize pool and the Aegis of Champions. 

The International 2024 is finally here and GosuGamers has you covered with a comprehensive, one-stop guide to all things TI13 to keep you in the know. 

No other event rivals The International and this year will be no exception. Prime-cut games between teams of the highest caliber, gut-wrenching action, emotional storylines, top-notch production, unique and engaging content, and perhaps a surprise or two will create the landscape that fans around the world will talk about for the rest of the year, and aspiring players will etch into their hearts as their goal and dream for next year. 

Ten days of glorious Dota 2 action will kick off on Wednesday, September 4th with the Group Stage. Sixteen will begin the journey, and only one will seize the Aegis of Champions and the lion's share of the $2+ MILLION prize pool.

The International 2024 (TI13)

The International 2024 is set to take place in Copenhagen, Denmark in September at the Royal Arena. This will mark the second time The International is returning to Europe after TI1, but the first time when, hopefully, fans will be able to attend. The first time Valve tried to bring its most prestigious tournament back to Europe was in 2020 when the pandemic hit the world. TI10 was postponed for 2021 and moved from Sweden to Romania. Although tickets were sold, a new wave of coronavirus forced Valve to refund all tickets and hold the tournament in an empty stadium in Bucharest. Since then, TI moved to Singapore in 2022 and last year it returned home, to Seattle.
